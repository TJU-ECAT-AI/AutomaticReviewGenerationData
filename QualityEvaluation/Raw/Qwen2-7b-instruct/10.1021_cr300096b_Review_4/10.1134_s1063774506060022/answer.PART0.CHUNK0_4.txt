The literature discusses the theoretical fundamentals, practical methods, and experimental setups of EXAFS spectroscopy, which is used to determine short-range order parameters in multicomponent amorphous and quasicrystalline media with high accuracy. It also describes the analysis of EXAFS spectra while accounting for multiple scattering effects and provides details on the requirements for radiation beam monochromatization. An example application is provided through the experimental investigations of tungsten and molybdenum oxides and fullerides.
