[1] "Several in situ techniques are known which allow investigations of catalysts and catalytic reactions under real reaction conditions using different spectroscopic and X-ray methods."
[2] "In order to gain a realistic picture of the working catalyst it is advantageous to combine the in situ techniques with simultaneous analysis of product composition (operando techniques)."
[3] "It has to be mentioned that each of these methods has its own potentials, limitations and special requirements."
[4] "In the case of UV-vis spectroscopy, broad and overlapping absorption bands can complicate the spectrum interpretation and quantitative measurements are only possible at low metal oxide loading of supported catalysts."
[5] "The crucial point in relation to the realisation of a multiple technique approach for studying catalysts at work is an appropriate set-up which allows the monitoring of the catalytic system under realistic conditions."
[6] "This operational set-up was applied for probing the stability of iron molybdate and MoO3 catalysts during methanol oxidation."

The CO and H2 chemisorption techniques are complementary for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. CO chemisorption provides information on the active metal sites and metal dispersion, whereas H2 chemisorption helps determine the metal-support interaction. Both techniques are essential for understanding the catalytic activity of bimetallic systems. Key considerations include the methodology used, the specific conditions under which the chemisorption takes place, and the normalization of reaction rates to account for differences in the catalyst's surface area or composition. Data interpretation often involves comparing the results with theoretical models or other experimental data to gain insights into the catalyst's structure-function relationship.

CO和H2化学吸附技术是表征二元催化剂的互补方法。CO化学吸附提供了活性金属位点和金属分散的信息，而H2化学吸附有助于确定金属-载体相互作用。这两种技术对于理解二元体系的催化活性至关重要。关键考虑因素包括所使用的实验方法、化学吸附发生的特定条件以及对反应速率进行归一化以考虑催化剂的表面积或组成差异。数据分析通常涉及将结果与理论模型或其他实验数据进行比较，以获得催化剂结构-功能关系的见解。
