[1] "The pioneering work in method coupling was done in the 1990s by the groups of Thomas13 (Cambridge, UK) and Topse (Lyngby, Denmark),14 who combined XRD and EXAFS."
[2] "In the case of UV-vis spectroscopy, broad and overlapping absorption bands can complicate the spectrum interpretation and quantitative measurements are only possible at low metal oxide loading of supported catalysts."
[3] "Looking at catalyst acting and catalytic reaction from different perspectives using a combination of several in situ characterization methods is a substantial progress in terms of elucidating the chemistry of catalyst materials, the mechanism of catalytic reaction and the identification of active sites."

1. CO and H2 chemisorption techniques both serve in characterizing bimetallic catalysts, but they differ in their methodologies and applications. CO chemisorption identifies the active metal sites by the formation of CO monolayers on the catalyst surface, indicating the presence of exposed metal sites. H2 chemisorption, on the other hand, is more effective in determining metal dispersion, as it can detect the amount of metal supported on the catalyst surface. The advantages of CO chemisorption include its simplicity and the ability to provide information on metal reactivity, while the limitations are its inability to quantify metal dispersion. H2 chemisorption is advantageous for its capability to determine metal dispersion, but it requires high purity H2 gas and can be affected by the presence of impurities. Key considerations for data interpretation include normalization of reaction rates to account for differences in surface area and metal loading.

2. In the context of characterizing bimetallic catalysts, CO and H2 chemisorption techniques complement each other. CO chemisorption provides insights into the active metal sites and their reactivity, whereas H2 chemisorption helps in understanding the metal dispersion and interaction between the metals. This dual perspective is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst's performance and mechanism.

3. Combining CO and H2 chemisorption techniques in a single set-up offers a more holistic view of the catalyst's properties and behavior. It allows for the identification of active sites through CO chemisorption while simultaneously assessing metal dispersion with H2 chemisorption. This integration facilitates a deeper understanding of the catalyst's chemistry and catalytic mechanism, which is essential for optimizing its performance and developing efficient catalytic processes.

1. CO和H2化学吸附技术都用于表征双金属催化剂，但在方法和应用上存在差异。CO化学吸附通过在催化剂表面形成单层CO来识别活性金属位点，这表明了暴露的金属位点的存在。相比之下，H2化学吸附更擅长确定金属分散度，因为它可以检测到支撑在催化剂表面上的金属量。CO化学吸附的优点包括其简单性以及提供金属反应性的能力，而其局限性在于无法量化金属分散度。H2化学吸附的优势在于能够确定金属分散度，但需要高纯度的H2气体，并且可能会受到杂质的影响。数据解释的关键考虑因素包括对表面面积和金属负载差异进行归一化反应速率。

2. 在表征双金属催化剂的背景下，CO和H2化学吸附技术相辅相成。CO化学吸附提供了关于活性位点及其反应性的信息，而H2化学吸附则帮助评估金属分散度。这种双重视角对于深入了解催化剂的性质和行为至关重要，对于优化其性能和发展高效的催化过程至关重要。

3. 将CO和H2化学吸附技术整合到一个单一的设置中，提供了一个更全面的催化剂特性和行为视图。它通过CO化学吸附来识别活性位点，同时通过H2化学吸附评估金属分散度。这种集成有助于深入了解催化剂的化学和催化机制，这对于优化其性能和发展高效催化过程至关重要。
