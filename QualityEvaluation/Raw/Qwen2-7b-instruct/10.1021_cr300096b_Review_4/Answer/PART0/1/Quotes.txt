"CO chemisorption and H2 chemisorption techniques both play crucial roles in characterizing bimetallic catalysts. CO chemisorption primarily helps in determining the number of active metal sites by measuring CO uptake. H2 chemisorption, on the other hand, aids in estimating the dispersion of metals on the catalyst surface."
          "For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst."
          "The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites."
          "However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature."
          "Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is a quantitative technique used to measure the absorption of light by free atoms in the gaseous state."
          "Inductively coupled plasma atomic/optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES/OES) is also used to quantify the concentration of trace metals within a bimetallic catalyst."
          "Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) is used to measure the temperatures at which metals and/or supports are reduced in a catalyst."
          "Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) is similar in theory to TPR, but it is used to measure the amount of coke deposited on the surface of a catalyst."
          "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are two primary forms of electron microscopy to characterize the morphology of catalysts."
          "Recently, there have been advances to correct intrinsic imperfections in the lenses of electron microscopes to improve resolution at very high magnification."
          "Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a very useful technique to determine the bonding configuration of reaction intermediates adsorbed on catalysts."
          "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a synchrotron-based technique used to characterize the local atomic and electronic structures of a catalyst under in situ conditions relevant to catalytic reactions."
