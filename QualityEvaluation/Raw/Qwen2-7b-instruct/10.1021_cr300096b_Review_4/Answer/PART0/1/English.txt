"CO and H2 chemisorption techniques are essential for characterizing bimetallic catalysts, focusing on determining the number of active metal sites, estimating metal dispersion, and identifying reaction intermediates. Normalizing reaction rates by CO uptake values allows for proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts. Caution is needed when using H2 chemisorption due to hydrogen desorption from some surfaces at room temperature. Elemental analysis methods, including AAS and ICP-AES/OES, quantify metal concentrations. TPR and TPO measure reduction and oxidation temperatures, respectively. TEM and SEM provide detailed morphological insights, and recent improvements enhance their resolution. IR spectroscopy determines the bonding configuration of adsorbed intermediates, while XAS characterizes local atomic and electronic structures under relevant in situ conditions."
