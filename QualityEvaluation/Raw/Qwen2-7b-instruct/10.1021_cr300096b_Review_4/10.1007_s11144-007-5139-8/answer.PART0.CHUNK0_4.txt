[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "The TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO and XPS data showed that introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3 – 0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The study focused on the influence of the Pt/Ni ratio on the surface characteristics and catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for methane reforming with CO2. It was found that adding a slight amount of Pt (0.3 to 0.5 wt.%) to the Ni catalyst results in a reduction of NiO particle size, easier reduction, and a more even distribution of nickel metal particles.

研究集中在双金属PtNi催化剂对甲烷CO2重整的表面特性和催化性能的影响上，Pt/Ni比例。研究发现，在镍催化剂中加入少量的Pt（0.3到0.5 wt.%）可以减小NiO颗粒的尺寸，使其更容易还原，并且镍金属颗粒分布更加均匀。
