[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "The TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO and XPS data showed that introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3  0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The study focused on the impact of the Pt/Ni ratio on the surface characteristics and catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi catalysts used for methane reforming with CO2. The researchers observed that adding a minor proportion of Pt (between 0.3 to 0.5 weight percent) to the Ni catalyst resulted in a reduction of the NiO particle size, facilitated its easy reduction, and ensured an even distribution of nickel metal particles.

研究主要探讨了铂/镍比例对用于甲烷与二氧化碳重整的双金属铂镍催化剂表面特性和催化性能的影响。研究者发现，向镍催化剂中添加少量的铂（在0.3到0.5质量百分比之间）导致NiO颗粒尺寸的减小，使其易于还原，并且实现了镍金属颗粒的均匀分布。
