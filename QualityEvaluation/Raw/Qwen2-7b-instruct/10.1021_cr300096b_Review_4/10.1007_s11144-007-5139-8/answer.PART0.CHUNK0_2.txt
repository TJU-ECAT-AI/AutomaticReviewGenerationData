[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "The TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO and XPS data showed that introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3 – 0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The study focused on the impact of the Pt/Ni ratio on the surface characteristics and catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi catalysts used for methane reforming with CO2. The researchers utilized Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of adsorbed CO, and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) data to analyze the catalysts. The introduction of a slight amount of Pt (0.3 to 0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst resulted in a diminution of the NiO particle size, easier reduction, and an even dispersion of nickel metal particles.

研究着重探讨了铂镍比对用于甲烷与二氧化碳重整的双金属铂镍催化剂表面性质和催化行为的影响。研究人员通过温度程序化还原（TPR）、吸附CO的傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）以及X射线光电子能谱（XPS）数据来分析催化剂。向镍催化剂中加入少量铂（0.3到0.5 wt.%）导致NiO颗粒尺寸减小，更容易还原，并且镍金属颗粒均匀分布。
