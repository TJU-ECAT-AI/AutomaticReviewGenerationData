Answer: There are no specific comparisons made in the document regarding the effectiveness of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. However, the document discusses the use of TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO, and XPS data as methods to study the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic catalysts. These techniques can provide insights into the active metal sites and metal dispersion, which are crucial for understanding the performance of catalysts in reactions such as methane reforming. For a direct comparison between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques, one would need to refer to literature specifically addressing these methodologies and their applications in catalyst characterization.

答案：文献中没有具体比较CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征双金属催化剂时的有效性。然而，文献讨论了使用温度程序还原(TPR)、吸附CO的FTIR以及XPS数据作为研究双金属催化剂表面性质和催化行为的方法。这些技术可以提供有关活性金属位点和金属分散的信息，这对于理解反应如甲烷重整时催化剂的性能至关重要。对于直接比较CO和H2化学吸附技术，需要参考专门针对这些方法及其在催化剂表征应用的文献。

[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "The TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO and XPS data showed that introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3 – 0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study focused on the impact of the Pt/Ni ratio on the surface characteristics and catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi catalysts used for methane reforming with CO2. The researchers utilized Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of adsorbed CO, and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) data to analyze the catalysts. The introduction of a slight amount of Pt (0.3 to 0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst resulted in a diminution of the NiO particle size, easier reduction, and an even dispersion of nickel metal particles.

The study focused on the impact of the Pt/Ni ratio on the surface characteristics and catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi catalysts used for methane reforming with CO2. The researchers observed that adding a minor proportion of Pt (between 0.3 to 0.5 weight percent) to the Ni catalyst resulted in a reduction of the NiO particle size, facilitated its easy reduction, and ensured an even distribution of nickel metal particles.
