Answering the first question, the document does not specifically compare CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. However, it discusses EXAFS, SEXAFS, and XANES methods used for studying surfaces and structures of materials, which could potentially be applied to analyze bimetallic catalysts. The document emphasizes the importance of these methods for understanding interactions within materials and provides insights into their theoretical foundations, experimental setups, and data analysis techniques. These techniques allow researchers to make statements that are only possible with these methods, particularly due to the availability of new, tunable X-ray sources such as synchrotron radiation.

Answering the second question, the document does not directly address CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. It focuses on EXAFS, SEXAFS, and XANES methods for studying surfaces and structures of materials. These methods enable researchers to understand the interactions within materials, which is crucial for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. The document highlights the use of these techniques in various fields, including biochemistry, catalysis, and materials science, which could indirectly inform the application of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques. The text also mentions that the book covers applications in biochemistry, catalysis, and materials science, which might provide some context for understanding how these techniques could be adapted for bimetallic catalyst characterization.
