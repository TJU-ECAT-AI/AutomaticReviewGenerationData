[1] "The book is written for users of the named methods, and - to say it upfront - it has been successfully achieved."
[2] "The theoretical chapters are well readable and systematically lead from a simple EXAFS model to multi-body effects, similar applies for the chapter on XANES."
[3] "Particularly noteworthy is that section, where questions of experimental setup and data analysis are dealt with in several contributions, as there are discussions of all experimental problems of measurements."

The document does not provide specific comparisons between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. It focuses on general information about the principles, applications, and techniques of EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure), SEXAFS (Surface Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure), and XANES (X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure). These techniques are used for studying the structure of solid materials and surfaces, particularly in the context of understanding the arrangement of atoms around a nucleus and their interactions. The document also discusses the use of these methods in various fields such as biochemistry, catalysis, and materials science. However, it does not delve into the specifics of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts.

文档没有提供有关CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征双金属催化剂方面的具体比较。它主要关注EXAFS（扩展X射线吸收精细结构）、SEXAFS（表面扩展X射线吸收精细结构）和XANES（X射线吸收边附近结构）这些方法的基本原理、应用和技术的一般信息。这些方法主要用于研究固体材料和表面的结构，特别是理解围绕核的原子排列及其相互作用。文档还讨论了这些方法在生物化学、催化和材料科学等领域的应用。然而，它并没有深入探讨CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征双金属催化剂的具体细节。
