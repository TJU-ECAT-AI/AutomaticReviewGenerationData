[1] "The theoretical chapters are well-readable and systematically progress from a simple EXAFS model to multi-body effects, similar applies to the chapter on XANES."
[2] "In particular, that section where all experimental problems of measurements are discussed in several contributions dealing with questions of experimental setup and data analysis is of great importance."
[3] "This book is written for users of the mentioned methods, and - to say it upfront - it has succeeded very well."
[4] "The handbook covers the theoretical foundations of EXAFS (E. A. Stern) and XANES (P. J. Durham) in two introductory chapters. A comprehensive second part describes in four chapters the setup of the EXAFS experiment (S. M. Heald), EXAFS with synchrotron radiation (S. M. Heald), laboratory EXAFS (D. C. Koningsberger), and the evaluation of the obtained data (D. E. Sayers and B. A. Bunker)."
[5] "In the final part, applications in the field of biochemistry (S. P. Cramer), catalysts (R. Prins and D. C. Koningsberger), amorphous and liquid systems (E. D. Crozier, J. J. Rehr, R. Ingalls) are presented."
[6] "This book is recommended for all users of EXAFS, SEXAFS, and XANES without restrictions, especially also those who want to get acquainted with these procedures."

The document does not provide specific comparisons between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. It discusses the theoretical foundations and experimental setups of EXAFS (Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure) and XANES (X-Ray Absorption Near Edge Structure) as well as their applications in various fields such as biochemistry, catalysts, and amorphous and liquid systems. However, it does not delve into the specifics of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for bimetallic catalysts.

该文档并未提供关于CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征双金属催化剂方面的具体比较。它讨论了EXAFS（扩展X射线吸收精细结构）和XANES（X射线吸收近边结构）的理论基础以及在生物化学、催化剂、非晶态和液态系统等领域的应用。然而，它并没有深入探讨CO和H2化学吸附技术在双金属催化剂中的具体应用。
