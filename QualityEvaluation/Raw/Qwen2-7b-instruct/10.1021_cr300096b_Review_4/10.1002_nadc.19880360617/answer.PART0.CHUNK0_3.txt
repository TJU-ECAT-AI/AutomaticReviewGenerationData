[1] "The theoretical chapters are well readable and systematically progress from a simple EXAFS model to multi-body effects."
[2] "The book is written for users of the mentioned methods, and - to say it upfront - it has been successfully achieved."
[3] "The section dealing with experimental setup and data analysis questions is of particular importance, as it discusses practically all experimental problems of measurements."

The document does not provide direct comparisons between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. However, it does highlight the importance of understanding the experimental setup and data analysis when working with EXAFS (Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure), SEXAFS (Surface Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure), and XANES (X-Ray Absorption Near Edge Structure) methods. These techniques are used for studying the structure of materials at the atomic level, which can indirectly inform on the effectiveness of chemisorption techniques such as CO and H2 for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. The book emphasizes the systematic progression from simple models to more complex phenomena in its theoretical chapters, which could be applied to understand the mechanisms involved in chemisorption processes. For detailed comparisons between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques specifically, additional literature or experimental studies would be required.

文档没有提供直接比较CO和H2化学吸附技术在表二金属催化剂表征中的有效性。然而，它确实强调了在使用EXAFS（扩展X射线吸收精细结构）、SEXAFS（表面扩展X射线吸收精细结构）和XANES（X射线吸收边缘结构）方法时理解实验设置和数据分析的重要性。这些技术用于在原子水平上研究材料的结构，这可以间接地告知CO和H2化学吸附技术表征表二金属催化剂的有效性。该书籍强调了从简单模型到更复杂现象的理论章节的系统进展，这可能被应用于理解化学吸附过程的机制。对于CO和H2化学吸附技术的具体比较，需要额外的文献或实验研究。
