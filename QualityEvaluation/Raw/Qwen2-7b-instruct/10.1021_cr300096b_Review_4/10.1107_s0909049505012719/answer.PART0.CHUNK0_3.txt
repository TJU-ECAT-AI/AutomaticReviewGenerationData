[1] "The development of this software project has been directed by a number of equally important motivations: Versatile XAS and numerical algorithms."
[2] "ATHENA and ARTEMIS use the programmers interface to IFEFFIT, as described by Newville (2001)."
[3] "Thus both programs have complete access to all the features of IFEFFIT, including all the capabilities of the programs AUTOBK (Newville et al., 1993) and FEFFIT (Newville et al., 1995)."
[4] "In this article, any analytic functionality ascribed to ATHENA or ARTEMIS is actually performed by IFEFFIT via its programming interface."
[5] "Versatile XAS and numerical algorithms."

These software programs, namely ATHENA, ARTEMIS, and HEPHAESTUS, are designed to provide comprehensive and versatile capabilities for X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data analysis. They are built upon the IFEFFIT library, which offers a wide array of numerical algorithms, and are written in Perl, utilizing Perl/Tk for the graphical user interface. This setup enables the programs to access and utilize the functionalities of IFEFFIT, including those from AUTOBK and FEFFIT, through an API. The primary goal is to cater to both novice and expert users in the field of XAS, offering tools for data processing, analysis, and visualization that are accessible and powerful simultaneously.
