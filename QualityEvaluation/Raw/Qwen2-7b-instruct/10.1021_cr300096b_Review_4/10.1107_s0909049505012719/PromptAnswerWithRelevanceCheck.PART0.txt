The document describes the development of a software suite aimed at enhancing the analysis of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data. The suite consists of three programs: ATHENA, ARTEMIS, and HEPHAESTUS, each designed to address specific aspects of XAS data processing and analysis. 

ATHENA is primarily used for data processing, including conversion of raw data, background subtraction, Fourier transformation, and plotting. It offers versatile preprocessing capabilities and handles data visualization both at the beamline and for offline data analysis. The program supports a wide range of data types and offers tools for energy calibration, alignment, reference spectra usage, deglitching, and merging of datasets.

ARTEMIS focuses on the analysis of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data, utilizing the FEFF program's multiple-scattering path expansion. It simplifies the complex process of FEFF-based analysis through a graphical interface that streamlines tasks such as path generation, fitting, and plotting. ARTEMIS also facilitates the creation and examination of fitting models, offering automated parameter generation and evaluation tools.

HEPHAESTUS is a collection of utilities that utilize databases of atomic absorption data for various tasks related to XAS, including absorption and fluorescence line energies, sample preparation calculations, and chemical data visualization.

The software suite emphasizes accessibility for novices and power for experts, enabling high-quality data analysis that is both efficient and adaptable. The programs are designed to be user-friendly, with extensive documentation and examples, and are freely available under a free software license, promoting transparency and reproducibility in scientific research.
