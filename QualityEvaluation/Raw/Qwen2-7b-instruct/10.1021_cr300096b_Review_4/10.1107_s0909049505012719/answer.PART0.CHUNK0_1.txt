[1] "In this article, any analytic functionality ascribed to ATHENA or ARTEMIS is actually performed by IFEFFIT via its programming interface."
[2] "Those already familiar with analysis of XAS data will find ATHENA and ARTEMIS quite easy to begin using and will quickly familiarize themselves with the many features of those programs."
[3] "Novices to absorption spectroscopy find that a usable graphical user interface combined with excellent analytic algorithms considerably lowers the barrier of entry into their new field of research."
[4] "For the expert practitioner of the art of XAS data analysis, ATHENA and ARTEMIS provide sophisticated capabilities allowing the user to exploit deeply the information content of their measured data."
[5] "ATHENA provides tools for the analysis of near-edge spectra. There are utilities for calculation of difference spectra, for fitting line shapes (arctangent, Gaussian, Lorentzian) to spectra, and for fitting linear combinations of standard spectra to unknown spectra."

These programs are designed to be accessible to novices while still offering power for expert practitioners. They provide tools for XAS data processing, including conversion of raw data to energy spectra, background subtraction, Fourier transformation, and plotting. They also offer utilities for analyzing near-edge spectra, such as calculating difference spectra, fitting line shapes to spectra, and fitting linear combinations of standard spectra to unknown spectra.
