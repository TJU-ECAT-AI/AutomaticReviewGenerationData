[1] "The development of this software project has been directed by a number of equally important motivations: Versatile XAS and numerical algorithms."
[2] "ATHENA uses the programmers interface to IFEFFIT, as described by Newville (2001)."
[3] "Simple for novices, powerful for experts. Those already familiar with analysis of XAS data will find ATHENA and ARTEMIS quite easy to begin using and will quickly familiarize themselves with the many features of those programs."
[4] "Novices to absorption spectroscopy find that a usable graphical user interface combined with excellent analytic algorithms considerably lowers the barrier of entry into their new field of research."
[5] "ATHENA provides utilities for most common chores involved in the preparation of EXAFS data for analysis."
[6] "The most powerful feature of ATHENA is that processing and displaying many data sets simultaneously is as simple as for a single data set."
[7] "ARTEMIS organizes all these tasks for the users. It integrates wrappers for ATOMS and FEFF and helps organize the paths from the FEFF calculation."
[8] "An extensive log file is presented upon completion of the fit, allowing the user to evaluate the quality of the fit, the reasonableness of the fitting parameters and the effects of the fitting parameters on the FEFF paths used in the fit."

ATHENA is designed to facilitate the processing of XAS data through versatile algorithms and a user-friendly interface. It simplifies tasks like background subtraction, Fourier transforming, and plotting, making it accessible for novices while still offering advanced features for experienced practitioners. ARTEMIS, on the other hand, streamlines the complex process of EXAFS data analysis by integrating tools for fitting models and organizing FEFF calculations. Upon completion of a fit, it provides a detailed log file that helps users assess the quality of the fit and understand the impact of fitting parameters on the analysis outcomes.
