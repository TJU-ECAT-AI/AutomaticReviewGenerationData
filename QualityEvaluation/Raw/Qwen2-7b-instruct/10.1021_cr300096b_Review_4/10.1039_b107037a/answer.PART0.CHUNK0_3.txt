<p>In order to decrease the cost of catalytic materials, understanding the microstructure of a variety of Pt-based d-transition metal alloy films is an important issue for fuel cell applications.</p>
<p>The small peak at 0.71 V indicated by an arrow is assigned to the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox process.</p>
<p>Fig. 2A shows a typical STM image of the film with well-crystallized grains in a size range from 50 to 100 nm.</p>
<p>After recording the STM image shown in Fig 2A, a 0.1 M HClO4 solution was injected into the electrochemical STM cell and the PtFe film kept in the electrolyte solution for 5 min under potential control at 0.5 V, which is within the double-layer potential region.</p>
<p>It is clear that the edges which were formed occasionally on the film surface, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 2C, have become oriented crystalline steps.</p>
<p>The characteristic image strongly indicates that the terrace surface has a close-packed structure, i.e. a Pt(111)-(1 × 1) structure.</p>

The document discusses the use of in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to investigate the dissolution and rearrangement of a PtFe alloy electrocatalyst in electrolyte solution. The PtFe alloy, containing 64% Pt and 36% Fe by weight, is prepared by magnetron sputtering. The study reveals that the dissolution of Fe atoms leads to the formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets, which is protective against corrosion. The dissolution process is associated with the redox process of Fe2+/Fe3+. The STM images show the evolution of the surface morphology over time, indicating the formation of oriented crystalline steps and well-ordered (111)-oriented facets. The terrace surface has a close-packed structure, resembling the Pt(111)-(1 × 1) structure.

文档讨论了使用原位电化学扫描隧道显微镜（STM）研究PtFe合金电催化剂在电解质溶液中的溶解和重构。所制备的PtFe合金含64%的Pt和36%的Fe，通过磁控溅射制备。研究表明，Fe原子的溶解导致形成以（111）晶面为主的Pt薄层，对腐蚀具有保护作用。溶解过程与Fe2+/Fe3+的氧化还原过程相关联。STM图像显示随着时间的推移表面形态的变化，表明形成定向晶面步骤和有序的（111）晶面。台阶表面具有紧密堆积结构，类似于Pt(111)-(1 × 1)结构。
