1. Cyclic voltammetry, EXAFS, XPS, and other methods are used by Watanabe et al. to investigate the catalytic properties of Pt-based alloys. These methods provide macroscopic information but lack atomic-scale models for film structures.
2. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is a powerful technique capable of obtaining atomic resolution images in both ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and electrolyte solutions.
3. In situ STM was employed in the current study to elucidate the surface processes occurring during the dissolution and rearrangement of a PtFe alloy.
4. The atomic resolution STM images demonstrate that the terrace surface has a close-packed structure, specifically a Pt(111)-(1 × 1) structure.

1. Watanabe等人使用循环伏安法、EXAFS、XPS和其他方法来研究Pt基合金的催化性能。这些方法提供了宏观信息，但缺乏对薄膜结构的原子尺度模型。
2. 扫描隧道显微镜（STM）是一种强大的技术，能够在超高真空(UHV)和电解质溶液中获得原子分辨率图像。
3. 在当前的研究中，利用原位STM技术揭示了在酸溶液中PtFe合金溶解和重构过程中的表面变化。
4. 原子分辨率的STM图像表明，台阶表面具有紧密堆积的结构，具体为Pt(111)-(1×1)结构。
