How do CO and H2 chemisorption techniques compare in their effectiveness for characterizing bimetallic catalysts, including their respective methodologies, applications in determining active metal sites and metal dispersion, advantages, limitations, and key considerations for data interpretation and normalization of reaction rates?

The literature does not directly compare CO and H2 chemisorption techniques specifically for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. However, it provides insights into the use of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in studying the surface structures and interactions of catalytic materials, which indirectly relates to the characterization of catalysts through techniques like CO and H2 chemisorption. STM offers atomic-resolution images that can reveal details about the surface morphology and structure of catalysts, aiding in understanding the active sites and dispersion of metals. The methodologies involve examining surface features, such as grain sizes, terrace-step structures, and crystal orientations, which are crucial for interpreting the catalytic activity and efficiency. Advantages of STM include its ability to provide detailed structural information under controlled environments. Limitations might include the need for specialized equipment and the potential for surface modifications during the imaging process. Key considerations for data interpretation involve correlating the observed surface features with the catalytic performance, such as reaction rates and selectivity. Normalization of reaction rates typically requires accounting for factors like surface coverage and kinetic barriers associated with different adsorbates.

如何比较CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征双金属催化剂的有效性，包括它们各自的实验方法、在确定活性金属位点和金属分散方面的应用、优势、局限性和数据解释及反应速率归一化的关键考虑？

文献没有直接比较CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征双金属催化剂的具体应用。然而，它提供了使用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）研究催化材料表面结构和相互作用的见解，这间接与通过CO和H2化学吸附来表征催化剂相关。STM提供原子分辨率的图像，可以揭示催化剂表面的细节，帮助理解活性位点和金属的分布。实验方法涉及检查表面特征，如晶粒大小、台阶结构和晶体取向，这对于解读催化活性和效率至关重要。STM的优势在于能够提供受控环境下的详细结构信息。局限性可能包括需要特殊设备以及在成像过程中表面可能发生变化。数据解释的关键考虑是将观察到的表面特征与催化性能相关联，例如反应速率和选择性。归一化反应速率通常需要考虑到不同吸附剂相关的表面覆盖率和动力学壁垒等因素。

The literature discusses the use of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) for studying the surface structure of Pt-based alloy films, specifically focusing on a PtFe alloy. It highlights the importance of STM in examining surface features at an atomic level, providing insights into the dissolution and rearrangement of the alloy's components in electrolyte solutions. The document also mentions cyclic voltammetry (CV) as another technique used to investigate the catalytic properties of the alloy, particularly noting the formation of a Pt skin layer through the dissolution of Fe atoms, which modifies the electronic structure and enhances CO tolerance. The in situ STM study allowed for the observation of the surface processes, such as the formation of Pt(111) facets and the modification of the surface morphology due to the dissolution and redeposition of elements.

The document discusses the use of in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to investigate the dissolution and rearrangement of a PtFe alloy electrocatalyst in electrolyte solution. The PtFe alloy, containing 64% Pt and 36% Fe by weight, is prepared by magnetron sputtering. The study reveals that the dissolution of Fe atoms leads to the formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets, which is protective against corrosion. The dissolution process is associated with the redox process of Fe2+/Fe3+. The STM images show the evolution of the surface morphology over time, indicating the formation of oriented crystalline steps and well-ordered (111)-oriented facets. The terrace surface has a close-packed structure, resembling the Pt(111)-(1 × 1) structure.

1. The study of fuel cells has led to the development of efficient catalytic electrode materials, particularly through the use of Pt-based alloys prepared via magnetron sputtering. These alloys exhibit high CO-tolerance for both H2oxidation and O2reduction, thanks to the electronic structure modifications that occur when Fe atoms leach out of the alloy and form a surface layer.

2. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) has been widely employed to examine the surface structure of single crystals, revealing atomic features of films to understand the interactions between electrodes and adsorbates. Recently, Watanabe et al. initiated an in situ STM study on a Pt film in solution, providing insights into the film's atomic structure and its interaction dynamics.

3. No study has been conducted on Pt alloys containing non-precious metals until now. The in situ STM investigation on a PtFe alloy film in acidic solution demonstrated that repeated potential cycles led to the dissolution of Fe atoms, rearrangement of Pt at the surface, and formation of a protective Pt skin layer, enhancing the corrosion resistance of the underlying PtFe alloy.

4. Prior to STM imaging in the electrolyte solution, the PtFe film was observed under nitrogen atmosphere, revealing a surface with well-crystallized grains and step-terrace structures. The film's surface morphology changed dramatically upon immersion in the electrolyte solution, transforming from an ordered surface to a rough surface with cauliflower-like features.

5. After multiple potential cycles, the STM images showed the formation of Pt(111) facets with terrace-step structures, indicating the rearrangement of the alloy's surface. The atomic structure analysis revealed hexagonal patterns and interatomic distances similar to the lattice of Pt(111), providing new insights into the electrode material study for fuel cells.

6. Further research is ongoing to investigate the Pt skin layer formed on the PtFe alloy electrode, focusing on the adsorption and oxidation of CO. These studies aim to improve the understanding of electrocatalytic activity and optimize the performance of fuel cell catalysts.

1. 燃料电池的研究促进了高效电极材料的发展，特别是通过磁控溅射方法制备的Pt基合金。这些合金在H2氧化和O2还原时表现出高CO容忍度，这归功于合金中Fe原子泄漏到溶液中并在表面形成具有修改电子结构的表面层。

2. 扫描隧道显微镜（STM）广泛用于单晶表面结构的检查，揭示了薄膜的原子特征以及电极与吸附剂之间的相互作用。最近，Watanabe等人启动了一项在溶液中对Pt薄膜的原位STM研究，提供了关于薄膜原子结构及其动力学互动的新见解。

3. 直到目前为止，没有对含有非贵金属金属的Pt合金进行过研究。在酸性溶液中的PtFe合金薄膜的原位STM调查表明，重复的电位循环导致Fe原子的溶解、表面Pt的重组，并形成保护性Pt表皮层，从而增强了底层PtFe合金的抗腐蚀性能。

4. 在电解质溶液中的STM成像之前，PtFe薄膜在氮气气氛下被观察到，显示有结晶颗粒和台阶结构的表面。当薄膜浸入电解质溶液后，其表面形态发生了显著变化，从有序表面转变为粗糙表面，带有花椰菜状特征。

5. 经过多次电位循环后，STM图像显示出以（111）晶面形式排列的Pt台阶结构，表明合金表面的重新排列。原子结构分析揭示了六边形图案和与Pt(111)晶格相似的原子间距，为燃料电池电极材料研究提供了新见解。

6. 进一步的研究正在进行中，旨在研究形成在PtFe合金电极上的Pt表皮层，重点是CO的吸附和氧化。这些研究旨在提高对电催化活性的理解并优化燃料电池催化剂的性能。
