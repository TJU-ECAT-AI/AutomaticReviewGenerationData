The literature discusses the use of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) for studying the surface structure of Pt-based alloy films, specifically focusing on a PtFe alloy. It highlights the importance of STM in examining surface features at an atomic level, providing insights into the dissolution and rearrangement of the alloy's components in electrolyte solutions. The document also mentions cyclic voltammetry (CV) as another technique used to investigate the catalytic properties of the alloy, particularly noting the formation of a Pt skin layer through the dissolution of Fe atoms, which modifies the electronic structure and enhances CO tolerance. The in situ STM study allowed for the observation of the surface processes, such as the formation of Pt(111) facets and the modification of the surface morphology due to the dissolution and redeposition of elements.

文献讨论了扫描隧道显微镜（STM）在研究Pt基合金薄膜表面结构方面的应用，特别关注了PtFe合金。它强调了STM在以原子级详细观察表面特征的重要性，并提供了关于合金成分在电解质溶液中溶解和重排的见解。文献还提到了循环伏安法（CV）作为研究合金催化性能的另一种技术，特别是指出了通过Fe原子溶解形成铂皮层的过程，这修改了电子结构并增强了CO的耐受性。原位STM研究使得观察表面过程成为可能，例如形成Pt(111)晶面以及由于元素的溶解和再沉积导致的表面形态变化。
