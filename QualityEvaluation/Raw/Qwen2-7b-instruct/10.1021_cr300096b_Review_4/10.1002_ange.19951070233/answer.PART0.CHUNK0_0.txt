The comparison between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques in characterizing bimetallic catalysts reveals distinct methodologies and applications. CO chemisorption is advantageous for elucidating metal-support interactions and identifying various active sites, whereas H2 chemisorption is instrumental in studying the electronic properties of metal surfaces and the coordination environment around active sites. Both approaches necessitate meticulous attention to parameters like temperature, pressure, and the selection of probe gases to ensure accurate and reliable outcomes. Normalizing reaction rates and interpreting data can be intricate due to the complex dynamics between the two metals and the support material. The synergistic effects between the metals play a critical role in optimizing the performance of bimetallic catalysts, potentially leading to superior selectivity and activity compared to single-metal catalysts.
