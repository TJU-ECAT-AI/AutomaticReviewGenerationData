1. The literature on coke formation in acidic zeolites discusses an extensive mechanism, with general agreement on the overall process. Karge identified poly-olefin species during methanol conversion, while Schulz and Wei found aromatic products retained in zeolite pores after dissolving the zeolite in hydrofluoric acid.

2. Schulz and Wei proposed a mechanism where conjugated olefins undergo cyclization via proton and hydride transfer reactions to form cyclopentadienyl species, which then lead to aromatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons.

3. Recent findings provide spectroscopic evidence for polyolefins with chain lengths from six to eight double bonds and cyclopentadienyl species in the catalyst, supporting Schulz and Wei's mechanism.

4. Polyolefins and polyaromatic hydrocarbons are formed during the initial stages of the reaction at various temperatures. However, at higher reagent doses, the intensity of the band 1545-1550 cm1 decreases relative to polyaromatic hydrocarbons.

5. The absence of detectable cyclopentadienyl species during methanol reaction at 200°C is not fully understood yet.

1. 在酸性沸石的研究文献中，广泛讨论并达成了对焦炭形成总体机制的一致意见（例如[41]）。卡格尔通过原位紫外吸收识别出了甲醇转化过程中的聚烯烃物种。舒尔茨和魏利用液相色谱法在氢氟酸溶解沸石后检测到了留在沸石孔中的芳香产物。

2. 舒尔茨和魏提出了一个机制，描述了共轭烯烃通过质子和氢转移反应进行环化，形成环戊二烯基物种，随后形成芳香族和最终的多芳烃。

3. 最近的研究提供了关于链长在六到八个双键范围内的聚烯烃以及催化剂中保留的环戊二烯基物种的光谱学证据，支持了舒尔茨和魏提出的机制。

4. 在所有研究的温度下，初始阶段都形成了聚烯烃和多芳烃。然而，在较高的反应物剂量下，1545-1550 cm1波段的强度相对于多芳烃下降。

5. 200°C时，没有检测到可检测的环戊二烯基物种，其原因目前尚不明确。
