[1] "The literature on coke formation in acidic zeolites is extensive, and there is general agreement on the overall mechanism (see, for example, [41])."
[2] "Karge identified the presence of poly-olefin species under methanol conversion conditions using in situ UV absorption."
[3] "Schulz and Wei identified the aromatic products retained in the zeolite pores by liquid chromatography after dissolving the zeolite in hydrofluoric acid."
[4] "Based on these results Schulz and Wei proposed a mechanism wherein conjugated olefins undergo cyclization via proton and hydride transfer reactions to form cyclopentadienyl species which subsequently form aromatic and, ultimately, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (Scheme 2)."
[5] "Our results strongly support this mechanism by providing specific spectroscopic evidence for polyolefins with chain lengths in the range from six to eight double bonds and for a cyclopentadienyl species in the hydrocarbons retained in the catalyst."

The literature on coke formation in acidic zeolites discusses the general mechanism of the process. Karge identified the presence of poly-olefin species during methanol conversion. Schulz and Wei, on the other hand, identified the aromatic products retained in the zeolite pores after dissolving the zeolite in hydrofluoric acid. They proposed a mechanism involving the cyclization of conjugated olefins via proton and hydride transfer reactions to form cyclopentadienyl species, which then lead to the formation of aromatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The current study provides specific spectroscopic evidence supporting this mechanism, including the detection of polyolefins with chain lengths ranging from six to eight double bonds and a cyclopentadienyl species in the retained hydrocarbons.

关于酸性沸石中的焦炭形成，文献中讨论了整体机制。Karge 在甲醇转化条件下识别到了聚烯烃物种的存在。Schulz 和 Wei 通过将沸石溶解在氢氟酸中并进行液相色谱后识别出了保留于沸石孔中的芳香产物。他们提出了一种机制，其中涉及共轭烯烃通过质子和氢转移反应进行环化以形成环戊二烯基物种，随后形成芳香物和最终的多芳烃。当前的研究提供了支持这一机制的具体光谱证据，包括检测到链长范围在六到八个双键的聚烯烃和催化剂中保留的环戊二烯基物种。
