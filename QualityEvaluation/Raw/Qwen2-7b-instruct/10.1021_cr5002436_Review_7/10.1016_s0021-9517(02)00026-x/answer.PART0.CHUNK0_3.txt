[1] "In situ UV Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed using a fluidized bed reactor/Raman cell."
[2] "Since recording the Raman spectra required lengthy signal averaging and the fluidizing gas contained no hydrocarbon reagent during the measurements, the spectra characterize only the stable, nonvolatile carbonaceous species in the zeolite after various contact times."
[3] "At all the reaction temperatures studied, a weak band at 2910 to 2940 cm1 was observed in the CH stretching region. The position of this band is consistent with an alkyl hydrocarbon CH stretch rather than an aromatic hydrocarbon CH stretch, which appears near 3050 cm1."
[4] "The spectra shown in Figs. 14 are clearly from a complex mixture of chemical species. However, it is possible to make band assignments to general classes of molecular vibrations and chemical species."
[5] "The literature on coke formation in acidic zeolites is extensive, and there is general agreement on the overall mechanism (see, for example, [41])."

The study utilized in situ UV Raman spectroscopy to investigate the formation of coke in the conversion of methanol and dimethylether to hydrocarbons over zeolite H-MFI. The researchers were able to identify polyolefin, cyclopentadienyl species, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons among the retained hydrocarbons from the Raman spectra. The findings strongly supported a previously proposed reaction mechanism that suggested cyclopentadienyl species play a key role in the formation of aromatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons through ring expansion. The results also indicated that the polyaromatic hydrocarbons have a chain-like topology, similar to polycenes, rather than a two-dimensional, sheet-like topology. This study provided direct evidence for two of the chemical species proposed in the mechanism and suggested the topology for the polyaromatic hydrocarbons that are the ultimate products of coke formation chemistry.

该研究使用原位紫外拉曼光谱技术来研究甲醇和二甲醚在H-MFI沸石催化剂上转化为烃类化合物时焦炭的形成。研究人员通过拉曼光谱识别出了聚烯烃、环戊二烯基物种以及聚芳烃等残留烃类。研究结果强有力地支持了一个之前提出的反应机制，即环戊二烯基物种在环扩展现象中起关键作用，进而形成芳香烃和聚芳烃。研究发现，这些聚芳烃具有链状拓扑结构，类似于多环分子，而非二维的片状结构。这项研究为该机制中的两种化学物种提供了直接证据，并推测了聚芳烃作为焦炭形成化学最终产物的结构特性。
