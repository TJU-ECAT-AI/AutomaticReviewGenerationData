[1] "The formation of retained hydrocarbons or coke in the conversion of methanol and dimethylether to hydrocarbons over zeolite H-MFI was studied using ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy."
[2] "These spectra provide direct evidence for two of the chemical species proposed in Scheme 2 and suggest a topology for the polyaromatic hydrocarbons that are the ultimate products of coke formation chemistry."
[3] "The detection of cyclopentadiene species has implications for the MTH reaction mechanism as well."

The study utilized ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy to investigate the formation of coke in the conversion of methanol and dimethylether to hydrocarbons over zeolite H-MFI. The results provided direct evidence for certain chemical species involved in the coke formation process and suggested a specific topology for the resulting polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Additionally, the detection of cyclopentadiene species has implications for understanding the mechanism of the MTH reaction itself.
