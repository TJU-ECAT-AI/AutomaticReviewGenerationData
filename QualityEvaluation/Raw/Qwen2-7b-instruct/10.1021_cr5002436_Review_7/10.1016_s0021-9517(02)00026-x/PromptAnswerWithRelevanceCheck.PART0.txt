[1] "The literature on coke formation in acidic zeolites is extensive, and there is general agreement on the overall mechanism (see, for example, [41])."
[2] "Karge identified the presence of poly-olefin species under methanol conversion conditions using in situ UV absorption."
[3] "Schulz and Wei identified the aromatic products retained in the zeolite pores by liquid chromatography after dissolving the zeolite in hydrofluoric acid."
[4] "Based on these results Schulz and Wei proposed a mechanism wherein conjugated olefins undergo cyclization via proton and hydride transfer reactions to form cyclopentadienyl species which subsequently form aromatic and, ultimately, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (Scheme 2)."
[5] "Our results strongly support this mechanism by providing specific spectroscopic evidence for polyolefins with chain lengths in the range from six to eight double bonds and for a cyclopentadienyl species in the hydrocarbons retained in the catalyst."
[6] "The spectra in Figs. 1-4 show that polyolefins, in a specific range of chain lengths, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons are formed in the initial stages of reaction at all three temperatures studied."
[7] "At the highest reagent doses, the intensity of the band 1545-1550 cm1 generally decreases relative to those of the bands assigned to polyaromatic hydrocarbons."
[8] "The absence of detectable cyclopentadienyl species during methanol reaction at 200 C is not understood at this time."

1. The literature on coke formation in acidic zeolites discusses an extensive mechanism, with general agreement on the overall process. Karge identified poly-olefin species during methanol conversion, while Schulz and Wei found aromatic products retained in zeolite pores after dissolving the zeolite in hydrofluoric acid.

2. Schulz and Wei proposed a mechanism where conjugated olefins undergo cyclization via proton and hydride transfer reactions to form cyclopentadienyl species, which then lead to aromatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons.

3. Recent findings provide spectroscopic evidence for polyolefins with chain lengths from six to eight double bonds and cyclopentadienyl species in the catalyst, supporting Schulz and Wei's mechanism.

4. Polyolefins and polyaromatic hydrocarbons are formed during the initial stages of the reaction at various temperatures. However, at higher reagent doses, the intensity of the band 1545-1550 cm1 decreases relative to polyaromatic hydrocarbons.

5. The absence of detectable cyclopentadienyl species during methanol reaction at 200°C is not fully understood yet.

1. 在酸性沸石的研究文献中，广泛讨论并达成了对焦炭形成总体机制的一致意见（例如[41]）。卡格尔通过原位紫外吸收识别出了甲醇转化过程中的聚烯烃物种。舒尔茨和魏利用液相色谱法在氢氟酸溶解沸石后检测到了留在沸石孔中的芳香产物。

2. 舒尔茨和魏提出了一个机制，描述了共轭烯烃通过质子和氢转移反应进行环化，形成环戊二烯基物种，随后形成芳香族和最终的多芳烃。

3. 最近的研究提供了关于链长在六到八个双键范围内的聚烯烃以及催化剂中保留的环戊二烯基物种的光谱学证据，支持了舒尔茨和魏提出的机制。

4. 在所有研究的温度下，初始阶段都形成了聚烯烃和多芳烃。然而，在较高的反应物剂量下，1545-1550 cm1波段的强度相对于多芳烃下降。

5. 200°C时，没有检测到可检测的环戊二烯基物种，其原因目前尚不明确。

2. The product distribution from the MTH process can be somewhat controlled by adjusting reaction conditions within certain limits.
3. A detailed reaction scheme for coke formation under low-temperature conditions was proposed.
4. The reaction scheme is based on observations of UV absorption bands indicative of highly unsaturated hydrocarbons, the recovery of alkyl-substituted benzenes from used catalysts, and sensible organic chemistry under acidic conditions.
5. UV Raman spectroscopy provides direct evidence for two of the chemical species involved in the coke formation process and suggests a chain-like topology for the final polyaromatic hydrocarbons.
6. The number of carbenium ions is directly proportional to the density of acid sites in the H-MFI zeolite.
7. At higher temperatures used in the study compared to those used by Haw, the equilibrium population of neutral species might surpass that of the carbenium ion.

[1] "In situ UV Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed using a fluidized bed reactor/Raman cell."
[2] "Since recording the Raman spectra required lengthy signal averaging and the fluidizing gas contained no hydrocarbon reagent during the measurements, the spectra characterize only the stable, nonvolatile carbonaceous species in the zeolite after various contact times."
[3] "At all the reaction temperatures studied, a weak band at 2910 to 2940 cm1 was observed in the CH stretching region. The position of this band is consistent with an alkyl hydrocarbon CH stretch rather than an aromatic hydrocarbon CH stretch, which appears near 3050 cm1."
[4] "The spectra shown in Figs. 14 are clearly from a complex mixture of chemical species. However, it is possible to make band assignments to general classes of molecular vibrations and chemical species."
[5] "The literature on coke formation in acidic zeolites is extensive, and there is general agreement on the overall mechanism (see, for example, [41])."

The study utilized in situ UV Raman spectroscopy to investigate the formation of coke in the conversion of methanol and dimethylether to hydrocarbons over zeolite H-MFI. The researchers were able to identify polyolefin, cyclopentadienyl species, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons among the retained hydrocarbons from the Raman spectra. The findings strongly supported a previously proposed reaction mechanism that suggested cyclopentadienyl species play a key role in the formation of aromatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons through ring expansion. The results also indicated that the polyaromatic hydrocarbons have a chain-like topology, similar to polycenes, rather than a two-dimensional, sheet-like topology. This study provided direct evidence for two of the chemical species proposed in the mechanism and suggested the topology for the polyaromatic hydrocarbons that are the ultimate products of coke formation chemistry.

The literature on coke formation in acidic zeolites discusses the general mechanism of the process. Karge identified the presence of poly-olefin species during methanol conversion. Schulz and Wei, on the other hand, identified the aromatic products retained in the zeolite pores after dissolving the zeolite in hydrofluoric acid. They proposed a mechanism involving the cyclization of conjugated olefins via proton and hydride transfer reactions to form cyclopentadienyl species, which then lead to the formation of aromatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The current study provides specific spectroscopic evidence supporting this mechanism, including the detection of polyolefins with chain lengths ranging from six to eight double bonds and a cyclopentadienyl species in the retained hydrocarbons.
