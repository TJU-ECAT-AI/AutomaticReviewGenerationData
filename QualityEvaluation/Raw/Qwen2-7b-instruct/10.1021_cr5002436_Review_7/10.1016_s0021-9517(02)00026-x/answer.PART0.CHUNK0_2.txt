[1] "Coke formation during this reaction has also been studied extensively."
[2] "The product distribution can be controlled, within limits, by the reaction conditions."
[3] "Coke formation under low-temperature reaction conditions."
[4] "This reaction scheme is based (1) on previous observations of UV absorption bands that are consistent with the presence of highly unsaturated hydrocarbons retained in the zeolite [12], (2) on the recovery of alkyl- substituted benzene from used H-MFI catalysts [11], and (3) on sensible, acid-catalyzed organic chemistry [11]."
[5] "These spectra provide direct evidence for two of the chemical species proposed in Scheme 2 and suggest a topology for the polyaromatic hydrocarbons that are the ultimate products of coke formation chemistry."
[6] "The density of carbenium ions is directly related to the acid site density in the zeolite H-MFI."
[7] "At the elevated temperatures used in our experiments compared to Haws (200 C vs 25 C), the equilibrium population of the neutral species may exceed that of the ion."

1. Coke formation during the methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) process has been extensively studied.
2. The product distribution from the MTH process can be somewhat controlled by adjusting reaction conditions within certain limits.
3. A detailed reaction scheme for coke formation under low-temperature conditions was proposed.
4. The reaction scheme is based on observations of UV absorption bands indicative of highly unsaturated hydrocarbons, the recovery of alkyl-substituted benzenes from used catalysts, and sensible organic chemistry under acidic conditions.
5. UV Raman spectroscopy provides direct evidence for two of the chemical species involved in the coke formation process and suggests a chain-like topology for the final polyaromatic hydrocarbons.
6. The number of carbenium ions is directly proportional to the density of acid sites in the H-MFI zeolite.
7. At higher temperatures used in the study compared to those used by Haw, the equilibrium population of neutral species might surpass that of the carbenium ion.

1. 甲醇到烃类（MTH）过程中焦炭形成的研究非常广泛。
2. MTH过程的产品分布可以在一定程度上通过调整反应条件来控制。
3. 提出了在低温条件下形成焦炭的详细反应方案。
4. 该反应方案基于对紫外吸收光谱带的观察，这些带与留在沸石中的高度不饱和烃的一致性，从使用过的H-MFI催化剂中回收的烷基取代苯以及合理的酸催化有机化学。
5. UV拉曼光谱直接提供了两种在焦炭形成过程中涉及的化学物种，并且表明最终的多芳烃具有链状拓扑结构。
6. 碳正离子的数量直接与H-MFI沸石中的酸位密度成正比。
