[1] "This study provides operando spectroscopic information on the short- and long-term deactivation process of the catalyst."
[2] "It is clear that no major peak intensity changes can be observed. On the other hand, the overall absorbance of the sample increases and this is related to the formation of coke."
[3] "Coke formation is evident from the Raman spectra in Fig. 2d."
[4] "In industry, this loss of propane is often circumvented by a short catalystreduction using hydrogen immediately before switching to propane."
[5] "Since in industrial processes the alkane dehydrogenation is often carried out with some excess catalyst to obtain the equilibrium conversion of the reaction, this loss in catalyst activity cannot be determined immediately from the conversion of the reactor."
[6] "It has been shown that the different techniques provide complimentary pieces of information, which are in excellent agreement with each other."

Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have led to a significant increase in demand for olefin production through dehydrogenation technologies. Key technological advancements include the development of more efficient catalysts, improved reactor designs, and enhanced analytical tools for real-time monitoring of reaction progress and catalyst performance. Current limitations involve maintaining catalyst stability and activity over long periods, especially in the presence of impurities and high-temperature conditions. Areas for improvement focus on enhancing catalyst selectivity, developing sustainable catalysts, and optimizing process conditions to maximize efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Real-time monitoring techniques, such as operando spectroscopy, offer insights into the dynamic behavior of catalysts and reaction intermediates, aiding in the optimization of dehydrogenation processes.
