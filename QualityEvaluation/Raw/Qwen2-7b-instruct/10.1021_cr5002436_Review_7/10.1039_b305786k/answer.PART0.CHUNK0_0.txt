[1] "In this work, we present a novel experimental set-up, which combines two operando time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, namely UV-VIS and Raman, directly coupled to a regular fixed-bed catalytic reactor via optical fiber technology."
[2] "The aim of this study is to demonstrate the advantage of the multi-technique approach in catalytic testing and analysis. It will be shown that the information collected has good potential to be used as a tool to more efficiently operate a propane dehydrogenation process."
[3] "Since in industrial processes the alkane dehydrogenation is often carried out with some excess catalyst to obtain the equilibrium conversion of the reaction, this loss in catalyst activity cannot be determined immediately from the conversion of the reactor."

The document highlights the development of a novel experimental setup that integrates UV-VIS and Raman spectroscopy with mass spectrometry for real-time monitoring of catalyst performance during propane dehydrogenation. This multi-technique approach offers significant advantages for more efficient process control in industrial applications. The setup allows for the continuous monitoring of catalyst activity, coke formation, and the redox cycle of chromium oxide species, providing insights into catalyst deactivation mechanisms. This information can be utilized to optimize the process parameters, such as adjusting cycle times for dehydrogenation and regeneration phases, to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. Additionally, the document suggests that the loss in catalyst activity, which might not be directly reflected in reactor conversion rates, can be detected through operando UV-VIS measurements, offering a crucial tool for predictive maintenance and catalyst management.
