[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers) (Tullo, 2003). Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."
[2] "A Catofin plant usually contains 5 cyclically operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst. The process is run at a temperature of around 850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar."
[3] "Especially, if the catalyst reaches a high temperature during coke combustion, this migration occurs more rapidly."
[4] "During the first 2 h it increases and then goes down slowly. The initially high conversion at t = 0 is caused by the combustion of some propane as it reduced the catalyst. This also explains the initially lower selectivity."
[5] "The UVVis absorbance at 1000 nm, where no specific absorption bands are present. The absorbance at this wavelength was used to characterize the darkening of the sample."
[6] "Since this front of complete coke coverage of the catalyst starts at the exit of the reactor and then moves forward only slowly towards the entrance, the overall conversion only drops slowly."
[7] "Using UVVis measurements to determine the coke content by determining its darkness shows that there is a link between the moment the catalyst loses activity and the moment the catalyst becomes fully covered by coke."

The surge in shale gas production has led to an increased interest in dehydrogenation technologies for olefin production due to the abundance of propane. Technological advancements have focused on improving catalyst efficiency, reducing energy consumption, and enhancing the sustainability of these processes. However, challenges remain, including managing coke formation, which can deplete catalyst activity. The Catofin process uses chromium oxide on alumina catalysts in a series of reactors. Coke formation is a critical parameter affecting catalyst performance, with small amounts benefiting activity but excessive amounts leading to deactivation. Monitoring coke content through spectroscopic techniques like UVVis and Raman can aid in process optimization and control, allowing for adjustments in cycle times, pressure, temperature, and feedrates to maintain optimal catalyst activity.

[7] "The most remarkable in the behavior of the catalyst is that the activity passes through a maximum."
[8] "Since the catalyst performance is per- fectly reproducible when consecutive cycles are measured,both the increase and decrease in activity must be caused by reversible/regenerable changes to the catalyst, i.e. the result of changes to either the oxidation state of the catalyst or the coverage of coke on the catalyst."
[9] "While after 2 h the UVVis mea- surements indicate an increase in the rate at which coke is be- ing built up on the catalyst, the Raman measurements show one coke band (1577 cm1) remaining at the same level,while the other main coke species (1320 cm1) decreases in intensity."
[10] "Both UVVis and a carbon mass-balance showed a continuous coke formation, while the intensity of the coke bands observed by Raman decreases after 5 min."

1. The surge in shale gas production has led to a significant increase in demand for propene, outpacing the supply from traditional sources like ethane steam crackers and fluidized catalytic crackers. This has driven the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production.
2. The Catofin process, developed by ABB Lummus, is one of the available dehydrogenation processes for converting propane to propene.
3. The process typically involves five cyclically operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst, operating continuously in a sequence that allows for efficient processing.
4. The initial high conversion rate is due to the combustion of some propane upon contact with the catalyst, reducing its activity.
5. The amount of hydrogen produced surpasses the amount of propene by 15%, confirming the formation of coke on the catalyst.
6. The obtained conversion and selectivity values (30% conversion and 80% selectivity) are notably different from industry-reported values for comparable conditions (4865% conversion, 8287% selectivity at 860-920 K, 3350 kPa, 0.42 h1 LHSV).
7. The catalyst activity exhibits a peak before declining, indicating reversible changes related to either the oxidation state or coke coverage on the catalyst.
8. The increase in activity during the early stages of the process can be attributed to the beneficial role of coke on the catalyst, possibly facilitating the adsorption of propane.

Answer: The surge in shale gas production has led to a significant increase in the availability of propane, making the dehydrogenation of propane more economically viable for olefin production. This shift in supply dynamics has encouraged the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies, as they become more cost-effective and competitive compared to traditional methods. The key technological advancements include the optimization of reactor design and operation parameters, such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition, to enhance the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Additionally, the integration of advanced spectroscopic techniques like UVVis and Raman spectroscopy allows for real-time monitoring of catalyst health and activity, enabling more precise control and adjustment of process variables to maintain optimal performance. Current limitations include the potential formation of coke on the catalyst, which can deplete its activity over time. Areas for improvement involve refining catalyst materials and designs to reduce coke formation, as well as developing more sophisticated analytical tools to predict and mitigate catalyst degradation. Overall, the combination of abundant propane supply, technological advancements, and innovative process control strategies aims to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production.

Cycle times can be extended if one observes that a larger amount of coke will utilize the catalyst longer in a more active state, or cycle times can be reduced if the amount of coke accumulating on the catalyst will be resulting in too much heat liberated during the regeneration phase."

This has made the dehydrogenation of propane more attractive. The Catofin process, developed by ABB Lummus, is one of the available propane dehydrogenation methods. Currently, the cycle times for the Catofin process are set based on past experiences, with the reaction temperature gradually increased over the catalyst's lifetime of about 2 years to maintain the desired conversion level. Knowledge of coke formation on the catalyst can assist in adjusting the cycle times. Longer cycle times can be implemented if more coke is observed, as it may prolong the catalyst's active state. Conversely, cycle times can be shortened if the accumulation of coke leads to excessive heat release during the regeneration phase.
