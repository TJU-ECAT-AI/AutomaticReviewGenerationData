1. The surge in shale gas production has led to a significant increase in the demand for propene, surpassing the supply from traditional sources like ethane steam crackers and fluidized catalytic crackers. As a result, dehydrogenation technologies for propane have become more attractive.

2. The Catofin process utilizes 5 cyclically operated reactors containing chromium oxide on alumina catalysts. These reactors operate at temperatures around 850 K and pressures of 0.2 to 0.5 bar.

3. Each reactor in the Catofin process undergoes a cycle consisting of 12 minutes of propane dehydrogenation, 3 minutes of purge/evacuation, 12 minutes of catalyst regeneration with air, and an optional 3 minutes of purge/evacuation followed by catalyst reduction.

4. UVVis spectroscopy is an effective method to monitor the redox cycle of the catalyst and track the chromium's oxidation state. It can also detect the migration of chromium into the alumina support, causing absorption bands to shift to shorter wavelengths.

5. Raman spectroscopy is utilized to track the different types of coke being deposited on the catalyst, providing complementary information to UVVis spectroscopy.

6. The catalyst activity changes during the dehydrogenation cycle due to two primary factors: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III).

7. High temperatures during coke combustion can accelerate the migration of chromium into the alumina support.

8. Using both UVVis and Raman spectroscopy simultaneously offers the advantage of providing complementary information on the electronic properties of the catalyst through UVVis and vibrational properties through Raman.

9. The focus of the study is on the role of coke in relation to the bed height for a commercially used chromium on alumina catalyst.

10. The reactor was heated at a rate of 10 K per minute to reach a catalyst temperature of 823 K in a gas mixture of 10 ml/min of oxygen and 40 ml/min of helium.

11. The catalyst temperature was monitored using a thermocouple placed in the center of the catalyst bed.

12. There is a clear trend in the conversion of the catalyst over time during the dehydrogenation cycle.

13. The coke formation is confirmed by the observation that the hydrogen produced exceeds the amount of propene by 15%.

14. The catalyst reduction occurs almost immediately upon feeding propane to the reactor.

15. De Rossi et al. (1993) found that various reduction treatments did not impact the catalytic performance.

16. Both the increase and decrease in activity during consecutive cycles suggest reversible/regenerable changes to the catalyst.

17. Using UVVis spectroscopy to measure the darkness of the sample provides a means to quantify the amount of coke on the catalyst.
