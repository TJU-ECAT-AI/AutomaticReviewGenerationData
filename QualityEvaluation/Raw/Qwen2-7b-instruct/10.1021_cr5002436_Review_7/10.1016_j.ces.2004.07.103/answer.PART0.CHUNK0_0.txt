[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers) (Tullo, 2003). Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."
[2] "A Catofin plant usually contains 5 cyclically operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst. The process is run at a temperature of around 850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar."
[3] "Especially, if the catalyst reaches a high temperature during coke combustion, this migration occurs more rapidly."
[4] "During the first 2 h it increases and then goes down slowly. The initially high conversion at t = 0 is caused by the combustion of some propane as it reduced the catalyst. This also explains the initially lower selectivity."
[5] "The UVVis absorbance at 1000 nm, where no specific absorption bands are present. The absorbance at this wavelength was used to characterize the darkening of the sample."
[6] "Since this front of complete coke coverage of the catalyst starts at the exit of the reactor and then moves forward only slowly towards the entrance, the overall conversion only drops slowly."
[7] "Using UVVis measurements to determine the coke content by determining its darkness shows that there is a link between the moment the catalyst loses activity and the moment the catalyst becomes fully covered by coke."

The surge in shale gas production has led to an increased interest in dehydrogenation technologies for olefin production due to the abundance of propane. Technological advancements have focused on improving catalyst efficiency, reducing energy consumption, and enhancing the sustainability of these processes. However, challenges remain, including managing coke formation, which can deplete catalyst activity. The Catofin process uses chromium oxide on alumina catalysts in a series of reactors. Coke formation is a critical parameter affecting catalyst performance, with small amounts benefiting activity but excessive amounts leading to deactivation. Monitoring coke content through spectroscopic techniques like UVVis and Raman can aid in process optimization and control, allowing for adjustments in cycle times, pressure, temperature, and feedrates to maintain optimal catalyst activity.

天然气产量的增长促使人们更加关注丙烷脱氢技术，以利用大量丙烷生产烯烃。技术进步集中在提高催化剂效率、降低能耗以及增强这些过程的可持续性。然而，仍存在一些挑战，例如管理焦炭形成，这会耗尽催化剂活性。Catofin工艺使用铝酸盐上的铬氧化物催化剂在一系列反应器中运行。焦炭形成是影响催化剂性能的关键参数，少量焦炭能提高活性，但过多会导致失活。通过光谱技术如紫外可见光和拉曼监测焦炭含量可以为过程优化和控制提供帮助，允许对循环时间、压力、温度和进料率进行调整，以保持最佳催化剂活性。
