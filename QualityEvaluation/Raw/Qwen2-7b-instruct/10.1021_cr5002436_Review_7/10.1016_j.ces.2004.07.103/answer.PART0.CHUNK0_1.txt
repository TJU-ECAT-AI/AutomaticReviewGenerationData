[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has in- creased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers) (Tullo, 2003)."
[2] "One of the propane dehydrogenation processes available is the Catofin process (ABB Lummus) (Bhasin et al., 2001)."
[3] "The 5 reactors are switched in such a manner that the overall plant operates in a 5488"
[4] "During the first 2 h it increases and then goes down slowly. The initially high conversion at t = 0 is caused by the combustion of some propane as it reduced the catalyst."
[5] "This coke formation is confirmed by the fact that the hydrogen produced exceeds the amount of propene by 15%."
[6] "Comparison of the obtained conversion (30%) and se- lectivity (80%) values to those reported in industry for this system (4865% conversion,8287% selectivity at 860920 K, 3350 kPa, 0.42 h1 LHSV, Buonomo et al.,1997) shows that the conversion obtained here is signifi- cantly different."
[7] "The most remarkable in the behavior of the catalyst is that the activity passes through a maximum."
[8] "Since the catalyst performance is per- fectly reproducible when consecutive cycles are measured,both the increase and decrease in activity must be caused by reversible/regenerable changes to the catalyst, i.e. the result of changes to either the oxidation state of the catalyst or the coverage of coke on the catalyst."
[9] "While after 2 h the UVVis mea- surements indicate an increase in the rate at which coke is be- ing built up on the catalyst, the Raman measurements show one coke band (1577 cm1) remaining at the same level,while the other main coke species (1320 cm1) decreases in intensity."
[10] "Both UVVis and a carbon mass-balance showed a continuous coke formation, while the intensity of the coke bands observed by Raman decreases after 5 min."

1. The surge in shale gas production has led to a significant increase in demand for propene, outpacing the supply from traditional sources like ethane steam crackers and fluidized catalytic crackers. This has driven the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production.
2. The Catofin process, developed by ABB Lummus, is one of the available dehydrogenation processes for converting propane to propene.
3. The process typically involves five cyclically operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst, operating continuously in a sequence that allows for efficient processing.
4. The initial high conversion rate is due to the combustion of some propane upon contact with the catalyst, reducing its activity.
5. The amount of hydrogen produced surpasses the amount of propene by 15%, confirming the formation of coke on the catalyst.
6. The obtained conversion and selectivity values (30% conversion and 80% selectivity) are notably different from industry-reported values for comparable conditions (4865% conversion, 8287% selectivity at 860-920 K, 3350 kPa, 0.42 h1 LHSV).
7. The catalyst activity exhibits a peak before declining, indicating reversible changes related to either the oxidation state or coke coverage on the catalyst.
8. The increase in activity during the early stages of the process can be attributed to the beneficial role of coke on the catalyst, possibly facilitating the adsorption of propane.
9. The coke formation rate as observed by UVVis measurements increases after 2 hours, whereas Raman measurements show the intensity of one coke band remaining stable while another decreases.
10. Continuous coke formation is confirmed by both UVVis and carbon mass-balance methods, while the intensity of coke bands detected by Raman decreases over time.

1. 石油页岩产量的增长导致了丙烯需求的显著增加，超过了传统裂解装置（如乙烷蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解）的供应能力，这推动了在烯烃生产中开发和采用脱氢技术。
2. ABB Lummus公司开发的Catofin工艺是可用于丙烷转化为丙烯的一种可用脱氢工艺。
3. 这个过程通常涉及五个循环操作的反应器，每个反应器包含氧化铬在氧化铝上的催化剂，以连续方式运行并按顺序切换，实现高效处理。
4. 初始高转化率是由于接触催化剂时部分丙烷燃烧，降低了催化剂的活性。
5. 产生的氢气量超过丙烯量的15%，证实了催化剂上形成了焦炭。
6. 获得的转化率和选择性值（30%转化率和80%选择性）与类似条件下的行业报告值（4865%转化率、8287%选择性，在860-920 K、3350 kPa、0.42 h1 LHSV下）存在显著差异。
7. 催化剂活性在达到峰值后逐渐下降，表明了可逆变化，可能是催化剂氧化状态或催化剂表面焦炭覆盖层的变化所导致。
8. 在早期过程中活动增加的原因可能归因于焦炭对催化剂的有益作用，可能有助于丙烷的吸附。
9. 根据UVVis测量结果，在2小时后焦炭形成速率增加，而根据拉曼测量结果，一个焦炭带的强度保持不变，另一个主要焦炭物种的强度降低。
10. 通过UVVis和碳质量平衡方法证实了持续的焦炭形成，而拉曼检测到的焦炭带强度随时间降低。
