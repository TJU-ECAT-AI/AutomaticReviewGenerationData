[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)."
[2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."
[3] "One of the propane dehydrogenation processes available is the Catofin process (ABB Lummus)."
[4] "A Catofin plant usually contains 5 cyclically operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst."
[5] "During the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst activity changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)."
[6] "Spectroscopy is an excellent manner to track the state of the catalyst during the process."
[7] "UVVis spectroscopy is a good method to track the oxidation state of the catalyst and thereby see the chromium go through its redox cycle."
[8] "Especially, if the catalyst reaches a high temperature during coke combustion, this migration occurs more rapidly."
[9] "Raman spectroscopy is an excellent method to track the different types of coke as they are being deposited on the catalyst."
[10] "The advantage of using both UVVis and Raman spectroscopy simultaneously is that they provide complementary information: electronic for UVVis and vibrational for Raman."

Answer: The surge in shale gas production has led to a significant increase in the availability of propane, making the dehydrogenation of propane more economically viable for olefin production. This shift in supply dynamics has encouraged the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies, as they become more cost-effective and competitive compared to traditional methods. The key technological advancements include the optimization of reactor design and operation parameters, such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition, to enhance the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Additionally, the integration of advanced spectroscopic techniques like UVVis and Raman spectroscopy allows for real-time monitoring of catalyst health and activity, enabling more precise control and adjustment of process variables to maintain optimal performance. Current limitations include the potential formation of coke on the catalyst, which can deplete its activity over time. Areas for improvement involve refining catalyst materials and designs to reduce coke formation, as well as developing more sophisticated analytical tools to predict and mitigate catalyst degradation. Overall, the combination of abundant propane supply, technological advancements, and innovative process control strategies aims to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production.
