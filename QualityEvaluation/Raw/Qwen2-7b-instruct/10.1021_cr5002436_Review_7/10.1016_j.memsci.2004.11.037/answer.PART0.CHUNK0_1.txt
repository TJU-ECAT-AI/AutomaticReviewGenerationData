[1] "Only a few authors have reported on the problem of propane dehydrogenation in membrane reactors since 1993."
[2] "The catalyst bed increases membrane reactor overall dimensions, increases the resistance of the tubeside or shellside area and can probably increase the final cost of the process."
[3] "In this work, we tried to make the step in another approach to the membrane catalysis application for alkanes dehydrogenation reactions."
[4] "Such membranes could be a valuable substitution for the present noble metal-coated membranes for dehydrogenation process. Being catalytically active and possessing gas separation properties at the same time, Mo-coated membranes could prevent from using granulated catalyst bed in membrane reactor."
[5] "In membrane reactor reaction chamber two processes can take place simultaneously: chemical reaction and separation of products on the membrane."
[6] "The principle of widespread method of permselectiviy increase is to decrease an average pore size in the selective layer."
[7] "It is worth mentioning that during the study of separation properties of Mo-ceramic membranes using the binary mixture methanehydrogen the maximum permselectivity occurred only when the flow ratio equaled 0.28."
[8] "Figs. 9 and 10 give the comparison of S and X for Mo-ceramic catalyst and Mo-ceramic CMR. The CMR S and X values exceeds there of for conventional reactor."
[9] "The reason is the effect of shifting the equilibrium for propane dehydrogenatiom reaction by selective hydrogen permeance through the membrane (removing from the reaction volume)."
[10] "The optimum combination of gas and catalytic properties will lead to less capital intensive light alkanes processing technologies."

Recent economic factors, especially the surge in shale gas production, have driven the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. The key advancements include the use of more efficient catalysts and the integration of reaction and separation in a single unit operation, which can reduce the cost and complexity of the process. However, current limitations include the need for further improvements in membrane separation properties, stability of the catalytic layers, and the optimization of the combination of gas and catalytic properties. Areas for improvement involve enhancing the selectivity to main products, reducing energy consumption, and increasing operational flexibility to handle a wider range of feedstocks. Technological advancements in this area aim to make light alkane processing technologies more capital-intensive and sustainable.
