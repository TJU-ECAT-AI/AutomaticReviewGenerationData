[1] "In fact high temperature catalytic membrane reactors (CMRs), which combine reaction and separation in a single unit operation, may solve the yield problems of equilibrium-limited reactions [2]."
[2] "In these reactions, the ther- modynamic equilibrium conversions are less than 20% even at 500 C; therefore, the high temperatures and low pressures that produce the acceptable olefin yields often create techni- cal complications and require expensive process equipment or specialized catalysts."
[3] "The pioneering work in this field (except Bitter patent [6]) was made by Ziaka et al. [3,4], then a few works of Weyten et al. [5] and Gobina and co-workers followed [7], and fi- nally we can find Quicker et al. [8], a few Korean researches [2] and Hou and Hughes work [9] devoted to propane de- hydrogenation in membrane reactors."
[4] "The catalyst bed increases membrane reactor overall dimensions, increases the resistance of the tubeside or shellside area and can probably increase the final cost of the pro- cess."
[5] "From this point of view membrane with catalytically active selective layer prevents from using another granulated catalyst."
[6] "In this work, we tried to make the step in another approach to the membrane catalysis application for alkanes dehydro- genation reactions."
[7] "Such membranes could be a valuable substitution for the present noble metal-coated membranes for dehydrogenation process. Being catalytically active and possessing gas sep- aration properties at the same time, Mo-coated membranes could prevent from using granulated catalyst bed in mem- brane reactor."

1. Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have led to a shift in focus towards more efficient and sustainable olefin production methods. This includes the development of dehydrogenation technologies that aim to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of these processes. Key technological advancements focus on improving the performance of catalytic membranes, reducing the reliance on expensive noble metals, and integrating reaction and separation in a single unit operation.

2. Current limitations in dehydrogenation technologies include high operational temperatures and pressures required to achieve acceptable olefin yields, which can lead to technical complications and increased costs. The use of noble metals like palladium and platinum, while effective, is costly and limits the economic feasibility of these processes.

3. Areas for improvement include developing more efficient and cost-effective catalysts, enhancing membrane separation properties, and optimizing the integration of reaction and separation processes in membrane reactors. There is a particular interest in using cheaper, more abundant metals in catalytic membranes to reduce the overall cost of the process.

4. The use of inorganic membranes with molybdenum (Mo) selective layers, obtained through chemical vapor deposition, is proposed as a promising alternative to noble metal-coated membranes. These Mo-coated membranes are expected to offer catalytic activity and gas separation capabilities, potentially eliminating the need for additional granulated catalyst beds in membrane reactors.

5. The shift towards using molybdenum-based membranes is driven by the desire to reduce the cost of membrane modules and make the process less capital intensive. By utilizing these cheaper, catalytically active materials, the goal is to develop more efficient, sustainable, and economically viable processes for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes.
