[1] "In fact high temperature catalytic membrane reactors (CMRs), which combine reaction and separation in a single unit operation, may solve the yield problems of equilibrium-limited reactions."
[2] "The catalyst bed increases membrane reactor overall dimensions, increases the resistance of the tubeside or shellside area and can probably increase the final cost of the process."
[3] "Only a few authors have reported on the problem of propane dehydrogenation in membrane reactors since 1993."
[4] "In these reactions, the ther- modynamic equilibrium conversions are less than 20% even at 500 C; therefore, the high temperatures and low pressures that produce the acceptable olefin yields often create technical complications and require expensive process equipment or specialized catalysts."
[5] "The optimum combination of gas and catalytic properties will lead to less capital intensive light alkanes processing technologies."

1. Economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have led to a significant increase in demand for olefin production, driving the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies. The high cost and complexity of traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, have encouraged the exploration of alternative and more efficient techniques. High-temperature catalytic membrane reactors (CMRs) offer a promising solution by combining reaction and separation in a single unit operation, potentially solving the yield issues associated with equilibrium-limited reactions. However, these systems face challenges including increased reactor dimensions, resistance, and costs due to the presence of a catalyst bed.

2. The current limitations of dehydrogenation technologies include the need for high temperatures and pressures, which can be technically challenging and costly. Additionally, the use of noble metals like palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) in catalysts adds to the capital expenses. There is a significant area for improvement in developing more efficient, sustainable, and industrially viable processes that can reduce the reliance on these expensive catalysts and optimize the overall performance of the systems.

3. Technological advancements in dehydrogenation technologies aim to address these limitations by improving the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of the processes. Key advancements include the development of high-temperature catalytic membrane reactors, which integrate reaction and separation, potentially enhancing yield and reducing energy consumption. Efforts are also directed towards the optimization of membrane separation properties to improve the productivity of composition catalytic membranes and membrane reactors. Furthermore, there is a focus on finding alternatives to noble metals in catalysts, aiming to make the processes less capital-intensive and more economically feasible.
