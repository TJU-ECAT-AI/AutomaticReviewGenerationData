<p>Light alkanes dehydrogenation is a thermodynamically limited process, leading to problems like low yield at low temperatures and coke formation at high temperatures. Propane dehydrogenation is a typical example of such catalytic reactions, crucial for propylene production.</p>
<p>The high temperature catalytic membrane reactors (CMRs) combine reaction and separation in a single unit operation, solving the yield problems of equilibrium-limited reactions.</p>
<p>Only a few authors have reported on propane dehydrogenation in membrane reactors since 1993. Palladium-coated membranes with Pt catalysts were mainly used in these works due to their high cost.</p>
<p>Replacing noble metals with cheaper, catalytically active metals like molybdenum (Mo) could reduce the cost of the membrane module and make the process less capital intensive.</p>
<p>Molybdenum-based composite membranes were used in the experiments, providing both catalytic activity and gas separation properties.</p>
<p>Propane conversion experiments were conducted in a membrane reactor with a schematic representation consisting of a feed gas delivery system, a high-temperature membrane reactor, and a gas chromatograph.</p>
<p>The influence of the support and Mo selective layer material on conversion to propane and selectivity to propylene was studied. The ceramic support was found to contribute to the conversion process, but the Mo layer on the ceramic support significantly increased the conversion to propane and selectivity to propylene.</p>
<p>The effect of flow ratio on catalytic activity was determined to achieve the maximum values when flow ratio equaled approximately 0.3.</p>
<p>The Mo-ceramic membrane separation properties allowed for the shifting of the equilibrium for propane dehydrogenation reaction by selectively removing hydrogen, resulting in higher propylene concentration in the retentate.</p>
<p>The selectivity and conversion values for Mo-ceramic CMR exceeded those for conventional reactors, demonstrating the membrane separation properties' advantage.</p>
<p>The use of carbon support instead of ceramic support resulted in better porous properties for the Mo layer, absence of acid centers, improved thermal stability, and higher selectivity to propylene.</p>
<p>The conclusions highlighted the importance of obtaining the optimum combination of gas and catalytic properties for enhancing the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation processes.</p>

The development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production have been influenced by economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production. This has led to a need for more efficient and sustainable processes to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of these processes. Key technological advancements include the use of high-temperature catalytic membrane reactors (CMRs) that combine reaction and separation in a single unit operation. However, current limitations include the high cost associated with noble metal catalysts like palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt). To address these issues, efforts are directed towards replacing these expensive metals with cheaper, catalytically active metals such as molybdenum (Mo) for composite membranes. These advancements aim to reduce the cost of the membrane module, make the process less capital intensive, and improve the overall efficiency and sustainability of light alkane dehydrogenation processes.
