[1] "In fact high temperature catalytic membrane reactors (CMRs), which combine reaction and separation in a single unit operation, may solve the yield problems of equilibrium-limited reactions."
[2] "In these reactions, the ther- modynamic equilibrium conversions are less than 20% even at 500 C; therefore, the high temperatures and low pressures that produce the acceptable olefin yields often create technical complications and require expensive process equipment or specialized catalysts."
[3] "In this work, we tried to make the step in another approach to the membrane catalysis application for alkanes dehydrogenation reactions."
[4] "Propane dehydrogenation in a catalytic membrane reactor using composite Mo-based membranes is reported in this article. Such membranes could be a valuable substitution for the present noble metal-coated membranes for dehydrogenation process."
[5] "In membrane reactor reaction chamber two processes can take place simultaneously: chemical reaction and separation of products on the membrane."
[6] "That is why before the Mo membrane efficiency reveal, using different temperature regimes, we defined the flow ratio, under which the S and X could achieve the maximum values."

The recent surge in shale gas production has led to a shift in the economics of olefin production. Shale gas has become a cheaper feedstock, which has influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies aimed at converting light alkanes into olefins. Key technological advancements focus on improving the efficiency and sustainability of these processes. Current limitations include the high temperatures required for dehydrogenation, which can lead to technical complications and the need for expensive process equipment or specialized catalysts. Areas for improvement aim to reduce costs and enhance the performance of catalysts, particularly by developing more efficient and cost-effective catalytic materials. For instance, the use of molybdenum (Mo)-based catalysts in composite membranes offers a promising alternative to noble metal-coated membranes, potentially reducing the cost of the membrane module and making the process less capital-intensive. The integration of reaction and separation in a single unit operation through catalytic membrane reactors (CMRs) is highlighted as a potential solution to overcome yield limitations in equilibrium-limited reactions, such as propane dehydrogenation, which is crucial for propylene production, a key monomer for polypropylene. The optimization of flow ratios and the use of different temperature regimes are considered critical for maximizing conversion to propane (X) and selectivity to propylene (S) in CMRs. The absence of acid centers in carbon supports, thermal stability of the catalytic layer, and improved porous properties of Mo-carbon membranes contribute to enhanced efficiency and sustainability in the dehydrogenation process.
