The catalyst employed in the experiments was 0.5% platinum (Pt) loaded onto alumina pellets. The hydrogen permeability of the membrane was approximately 0.8 to 1.0 millimoles per square meter per second Pascal. The membrane demonstrated a hydrogen/nitrogen selectivity ranging from 1200 to 1500, depending on the pressure differential. After the initial experiments, the membrane's hydrogen permeability decreased due to contamination from the feed and product gases. The membrane reactor exhibited a significantly higher yield of isobutene compared to a fixed bed reactor. The addition of hydrogen to the isobutane feed contributed to more stable catalyst activity in both the fixed bed and membrane reactors. The membrane reactor showed a higher selectivity, with all selectivities ranging from 75 to 92%. Simulations for the membrane reactor consistently yielded slightly higher values than experimental results. Reaction kinetics rather than hydrogen permeability dictated the isobutene yield in the membrane reactor. As the reaction rate increased, the yield of isobutene also increased in the membrane reactor. Pressure in the fixed bed reactor accelerated the reverse reaction, thus decreasing selectivity. In the membrane reactor, higher pressure assisted in the removal of hydrogen, which in turn influenced selectivity.
