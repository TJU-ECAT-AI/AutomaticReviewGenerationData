          [1] "The process limitations are currently faced by employing serial systems where catalytic reaction and catalyst regeneration take place in different batch reactors that provide a semicontinuous propylene production."
          [2] "Other industrial configurations consist of supplying hydrogen with propane feed with an aim of reducing coke formation in reaction but reaching lower yield to propylene."
          [3] "The use of a two-zone fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR) has been proposed to carry out continuous catalyst regeneration (Figure 1)."
          [4] "This multifunctional reactor could provide very important process intensification, where three different operations could take place: reaction, regeneration, and molecular separation."
          [5] "The advantage of using PtSn/MgAl2O4, instead of PtSnK/γAl2O3 as in previous study, comes from its lower coking tendency."
          [6] "The limitation is the operation range of palladium membranes, which is different from the desirable reaction temperature range of the catalytic propane dehydrogenation."

          Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have significantly influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. The abundance of shale gas has led to a shift in the raw materials used for olefin production, with propane being increasingly utilized as a feedstock. This shift has prompted the need for more efficient and sustainable dehydrogenation processes capable of converting propane into propylene, a key feedstock for the petrochemical industry. Key technological advancements in this field include the introduction of reactor configurations such as the two-zone fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR) and the incorporation of palladium membranes within these reactors. The TZFBR facilitates continuous catalyst regeneration, enhancing process efficiency and stability. Palladium membranes, specifically, enable hydrogen removal, which shifts the reaction equilibrium towards propylene production while maintaining steady-state operation.

          Current limitations in these processes include the operational constraints of palladium membranes, particularly their temperature limits, which do not align with the ideal reaction temperatures for catalytic propane dehydrogenation. This necessitates the development of new palladium alloy membranes that can operate within the desired temperature range for optimal efficiency.

          Areas for improvement focus on enhancing the catalyst's selectivity and reducing the coke formation rate, which negatively impacts catalyst activity. Additionally, optimizing the regenerative agent flow, especially the oxygen supply in the TZFBR, is crucial for maintaining constant catalytic activity without net deactivation. The integration of palladium membranes within the TZFBR configuration has demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional reactors, achieving higher yields of propylene and demonstrating process intensification potential.

          To further enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation processes, ongoing research should concentrate on developing more robust catalysts with lower coking tendencies, improving the operation range of palladium membranes, and refining reactor designs to better manage heat and mass transfer, thereby optimizing energy usage and reducing environmental impact.

          近期经济因素，尤其是页岩气产量的激增，对烯烃生产中的脱氢技术的发展和采用产生了重大影响。页岩气的丰富为烯烃生产提供了新的原料来源，尤其是丙烷作为原料用于生产丙烯，这促使了更高效和可持续的脱氢过程的发展。这一领域的关键技术进步包括引入如双区流化床反应器（TZFBR）以及在这些反应器中使用钯膜。TZFBR能够实现连续催化剂再生，提高了过程效率和稳定性。钯膜特别能实现氢气的去除，将反应平衡向丙烯生产方向移动，同时保持稳态操作。

          当前这些过程的局限性主要体现在钯膜的操作范围，它们的温度限制与催化丙烷脱氢的理想反应温度范围不匹配。这就需要开发能够在所需温度范围内高效运行的新型钯合金膜。

          改进的重点在于提高催化剂的选择性并减少焦炭生成速率，后者会降低催化剂活性。此外，优化再生剂流量，尤其是在TZFBR中的氧气供应，对于保持恒定的催化活性并避免净失活至关重要。在TZFBR配置中集成钯膜已显示出优于传统反应器的性能，实现了更高的丙烯产率，并展示了过程强化潜力。

          为了进一步提高效率、可持续性和工业可行性，持续的研究应集中在开发具有更低结焦倾向的更耐用催化剂、改进钯膜的操作范围以及优化反应器设计以更好地管理热和质量传递，从而优化能量使用并减少环境影响。
