          [2] "Other industrial configurations consist of supplying hydrogen with propane feed with an aim of reducing coke formation in reaction but reaching lower yield to propylene."
          [3] "The use of a two-zone fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR) has been proposed to carry out continuous catalyst regeneration (Figure 1)."
          [4] "This multifunctional reactor could provide very important process intensification, where three different operations could take place: reaction, regeneration, and molecular separation."
          [5] "The advantage of using PtSn/MgAl2O4, instead of PtSnK/γAl2O3 as in previous study, comes from its lower coking tendency."
          [6] "The limitation is the operation range of palladium membranes, which is different from the desirable reaction temperature range of the catalytic propane dehydrogenation."

[1] "The recent surge in shale gas production has led to a growing demand for olefins and olefinic products, driving the development of various catalytic dehydrogenation processes."
          [2] "Current processes for propene and butenes production from the corresponding alkanes employ mainly fixed bedoperation, but because of the necessarily high temperatures involved in these reversible endothermic reactions, catalyst coking rapidly occurs, so that frequent catalyst regeneration is required."
          [3] "An alternative is the use of a membrane reactor. In recent years, the possibility of overcoming the equilibrium constraint in reversible reactions such as dehydrogenations has attracted wide attention. Separation of the hydrogen product permits a higher conversion or better selectivity to be achieved."
          [4] "Porous membranes such as glass and alumina [6,7] have been used to study the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and conversions as high as two to seven times the equilibrium level have been observed for some reactions [810]."
          [5] "However, these membranes exhibit poor selectivity, due largely to the nature of the flow process in their pore structure."
          [6] "Dense metallic membranes on the other hand, such as palladium and its alloys possess exclusive selectivity to hydrogen and if they can be made sufficiently thin can provide adequate fluxes for hydrogen [11,12]."

          [9] "Results and discussion Initial experiments were made with a commercial chromia/alumina catalyst located within the reactor tube of the fixed bed reactor, but this failed to produce significant yields of isobutene within the temperature range of interest (450520 8C)."
          [10] "Clearly the addition of hydrogen has provided a more stable catalyst activity, although a slow decrease is still observed."
          [11] "The activity of this catalyst was tested in the fixed bed mode and a sharp drop of activity was observed, the conversion of isobutane falling to less than 5% over a period of 6 h."
          [12] "However, through the period of a measurement (up to 23 h) the activity was essentially constant."
          [13] "The activity decrease for the membrane reactor was slightly greater than that for the fixed bed mode even with hydrogen addition; this is due mainly to the removal of hydrogen by permeation from the tube side in the membrane reactor giving a higher concentration of olefin which has a greater potential for coke deposition than the isobutane."
          [14] "The product stream from the membrane reactor was found to consist of isobutane, isobutene, hydrogen, methane, propane/propene and very small amounts of C2 and C4 hydrocarbons."
          [15] "The simulation of the fixed bed reactor is based on the following assumptions: flow within the reactor tube is in plug flow; operation is isothermal and isobaric."
          [16] "Permeation measurements had shown a decline in hydrogen permeability after the first few experiments, which was attributed to contamination from feed and product gases."
          [17] "Confirmation of this is given in Fig. 9, where simulations have been made of isobutene yield versus space time for three assumed reaction rates, based on multiples of the measured experimental reaction rate, rA1."

          [19] "A simple isothermal model of the process was developed, which although giving good agreement with the fixed bed results, indicated that transport in the membrane reactor was not limited by the permeability of the membrane to hydrogen, but was caused by the relatively low values of the reaction rate produced by the catalyst."
