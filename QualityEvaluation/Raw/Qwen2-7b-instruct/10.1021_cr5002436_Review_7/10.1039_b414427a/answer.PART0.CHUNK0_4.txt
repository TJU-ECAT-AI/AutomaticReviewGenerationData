[1] "Recent technical developments have tremendously increased the popularity of Raman spectroscopy as a characterization tool to obtain physico-chemical information on heteroge- neously catalized reaction systems."
[2] "This methodology allows measurement of the amount of carbonaceous deposits on a catalyst material inside a reactor as a function of reaction time and catalyst bed height."
[3] "We believe it can be generally applied for studying supported metal oxide catalysts in a quantitative manner under working conditions."
[4] "The new method, in which a UV-Vis correction factor is applied, allows with an estimated error of 10% to quantify the amount of coke formed in a propane dehydrogenation reactor as a function of catalyst bed height as well as reaction time."
[5] "Comparing the results to TGA/TEOM data has proven the validation of the method. They all are in good agreement with each other."

The document discusses the application of Raman spectroscopy in the context of dehydrogenation reactions, specifically focusing on the quantification of coke formation on supported metal oxide catalysts. The authors introduce a novel method that uses a UV-Vis correction factor to accurately determine the amount of coke formed during the reaction, with an estimated error of 10%. This method is validated by comparing the Raman spectroscopy results with those obtained from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and thermal emission optical microscopy (TEOM) techniques. The method is considered suitable for studying supported metal oxide catalysts under working conditions, allowing for the measurement of coke deposition as a function of reaction time and catalyst bed height. The integration of Raman spectroscopy with UV-Vis spectroscopy offers an elegant solution for monitoring the amount of coke in a propane dehydrogenation reactor, providing insights into the catalytic process and potential for developing an expert system for online process control.
