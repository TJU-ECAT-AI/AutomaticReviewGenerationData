[1] "The formation of coke was confirmed with TEOM, TGA and Raman."
[2] "As the dehydrogenation proceeds, the catalyst gradually darkens due to coke formation and consequently the UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance and Raman scattered signal progressively decrease in intensity."
[3] "The amount of coke seems to increase up to 30 min (Fig. 2e) followed by a gradual decrease."
[4] "It was found that the mass of the catalyst during a propane dehydrogenation cycle at 550 1C gradually increases with increasing reaction time up to 40 min-on-stream and then remains constant."
[5] "The new method, in which a UV-Vis correction factor is applied, allows with an estimated error of 10% to quantify the amount of coke formed in a propane dehydrogenation reactor as a function of catalyst bed height as well as reaction time."

The dehydrogenation of propane over an industrial-like 13 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst was studied using real-time quantitative Raman spectroscopy without the need for an internal standard. The catalyst was continuously monitored during reaction. The dehydrogenation led to coke formation, causing a decrease in the intensity of the UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance and Raman scattered signal. The amount of coke formed was quantified using a correction factor derived from the UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra. The methodology allowed for the measurement of the amount of coke on the catalyst surface as a function of reaction time and catalyst bed height, providing insights into the on-line process control of industrial propane dehydrogenation reactors.

在工业级13 wt% Cr/Al2O3脱氢催化剂上进行了丙烷脱氢的实时定量拉曼光谱研究，无需使用内部标准。在反应过程中持续监测催化剂。随着脱氢的进行，催化剂逐渐变黑，形成焦炭，导致UV-Vis-NIR漫反射和拉曼散射信号强度逐渐降低。通过从UV-Vis-NIR漫反射光谱中得出的校正因子，焦炭的形成量得到了量化。该方法允许根据反应时间和催化剂床高度测量催化剂表面的焦炭量，为工业丙烷脱氢反应器的在线过程控制提供了见解。
