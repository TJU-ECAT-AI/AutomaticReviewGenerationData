<p>As stated in the Introduction, two different approaches to quantify the time-resolved Raman spectra are compared in this work. The first method makes use of a correction factor based on the UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra, further denoted as the G(RN) correction factor. This correction factor is determined for each Raman spectrum by calculating the G(RN) value using eqn. (2) at 580 nm (580532 nm E 18 800 cm1 E 1580 cm1) as illustrated in Fig. 3. This position in the UV-Vis-NIR spectrum corresponds to the coke band at a Raman shift of 1580 cm1 in case a Raman laser wavelength of 532 nm (18 800 cm1) is used.</p>
<p>In a second step, the corresponding Raman spectra of Fig. 2 were divided by the corresponding values of G(RN) according to eqn. (1) to obtain the true Raman intensities. The result of this mathematical operation is shown in Fig. 6. It is evident that the Raman bands due to coke formation at 1580 and 1330 cm1 gradually develop as a function of reaction time, while the Raman band of BN decreases during the first 30 min (Fig. 6ae) and remains constant thereafter. On the other hand, Fig. 7 shows the Raman spectra of Fig. 2 obtained after normalizing the Raman bands of the carbonaceous deposits to those of the inert internal standard BN. Here, a shoulder next to the BN Raman band readily appears at around 1330 cm1 due to the formation of coke and this band grows in intensity during the whole dehydrogenation period indicating that the amount of coke increases.</p>
<p>It was found that RN and thus G(RN) are decreasing as the reaction time proceeds except for the first minutes-on-stream. Here, the reduction of Cr61 to Cr31 is mainly responsible for a small increase in G(RN). Both a reduction and blackening of the catalyst influence the color. However, this does not influence the correctness of the G(RN) values since G(RN) is only dependant on the color of the catalyst. So, the origin of this changing color does not matter. Although RN only drops from values of around 0.35 to 0.19, still this corresponds with a decrease of G(RN) of more than 50%.</p>
<p>The main advantage of the developed method is that no additional compound is required to quantify the measured Raman spectra. In this particular set of experiments, boron nitride, although catalytically inert, is not a good internal standard since its Raman peak clearly overlaps with one of the coke bands. In general, all methods of referencing to an internal standard are highly specific to the systems to which they are applied.</p>
<p>Comparing the results to TGA/TEOM data has proven the validation of the method. They all are in good agreement with each other. The new method, in which a UV-Vis correction factor is applied, allows with an estimated error of 10% to quantify the amount of coke formed in a propane dehydrogenation reactor as a function of catalyst bed height as well as reaction time.</p>
<p>It was also found that propene is the precursor for coke formation at the catalyst surface and the first coke made is beneficial for propane dehydrogenation. This is due to a facilitated adsorption of propane. As the reaction proceeds, the increased amount of coke formed in the neighbourhood of the alkane dehydrogenation sites becomes more graphitic, preventing the formation of propene and as a consequence the activity drops. Thus, the amount of coke formed seems to be critical for the catalyst performance.</p>

1. The G(RN) correction factor is determined by calculating the G(RN) value using eqn. (2) at 580 nm, corresponding to the coke band at a Raman shift of 1580 cm1 in case a Raman laser wavelength of 532 nm is used.
2. The Raman band of boron nitride decreases during the first 30 min, while the Raman bands due to coke formation gradually develop over time.
3. The reduction of Cr61 to Cr31 causes a slight increase in G(RN) and does not significantly affect the color or the correctness of the G(RN) values.
4. The developed method uses a UV-Vis correction factor, allowing for quantitative determination of the amount of coke formed in a propane dehydrogenation reactor with an estimated error of 10%.
5. Propene is the precursor for coke formation, which initially benefits propane dehydrogenation. However, as more coke forms and becomes more graphitic, it prevents propene formation and reduces catalyst activity.

5. 丙烯是焦油形成的前体，初期对丙烷脱氢有益。然而，随着更多焦油形成并变得更像石墨，它阻止了丙烯形成并降低了催化剂活性。

2. Quantifying Raman spectra can be achieved by normalizing the bands of the species of interest to those of a scattering species that is assumed to stay constant over time.
3. Progressive darkening of the catalytic material, such as coke formation, causes a reduction in RN, making it difficult to maintain the proportional relationship between Raman band intensities and species concentration.

5. The primary benefit of the developed method is that it doesn't require additional substances for quantifying measured Raman spectra.
