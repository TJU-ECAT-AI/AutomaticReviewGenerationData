[1] "In continuation to the possibility of using a combined operando Raman/UV-Vis-NIR set-up for conducting qualitative Raman spectroscopy, the possibilities for quantitative Raman spectroscopic measurements of supported metal oxide catalysts under working conditions without the need of an internal standard have been explored."
[2] "The dehydrogenation of propane over an industrial-like 13 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst was used as a model system."
[3] "During reaction, the catalytic solid was continuously monitored by both UV-Vis-NIR and Raman spectroscopy."
[4] "As the dehydrogenation proceeds, the catalyst gradually darkens due to coke formation and consequently the UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance and Raman scattered signal progressively decrease in intensity."
[5] "The formation of coke was confirmed with TEOM, TGA and Raman."
[6] "It will be shown that the proposed methodology allows measurement of the amount of carbonaceous deposits on a catalyst material inside a reactor as a function of reaction time and catalyst bed height."
[7] "The validity of the approach is compared with one, in which an internal boron nitride standard is added to the catalytic solid."
[8] "The main advantage of the developed method is that no additional compound is required to quantify the measured Raman spectra."

The recent advancements in dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production have been significantly influenced by the surge in shale gas production. This has led to the development of more efficient and sustainable processes. Key technological advancements include the use of combined operando Raman/UV-Vis-NIR set-ups for quantitative measurements of supported metal oxide catalysts under working conditions without the need for an internal standard. These advancements enable the continuous monitoring of catalyst performance, allowing for the precise quantification of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface. This helps in understanding the deactivation mechanisms and improving the efficiency and sustainability of the dehydrogenation processes. Current limitations include the specificity of certain methods to the systems they are applied to, and the potential for long-term deactivation phenomena, such as ruby formation. Areas for improvement include enhancing the accuracy and reliability of quantitation methods, developing more robust catalysts that can withstand the harsh conditions of industrial processes, and optimizing the integration of spectroscopic data for real-time process control. These advancements pave the way for the development of expert systems that can monitor and control industrial dehydrogenation reactors based on spectroscopic data, leading to enhanced efficiency and sustainability.
