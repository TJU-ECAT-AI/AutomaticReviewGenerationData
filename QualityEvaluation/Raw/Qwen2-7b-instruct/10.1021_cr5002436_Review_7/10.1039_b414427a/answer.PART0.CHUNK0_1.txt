[1] "Recent technical developments have tremendously increased the popularity of Raman spectroscopy as a characterization tool to obtain physico-chemical information on heteroge- neously catalized reaction systems."
[2] "One way to quantify Raman spectra is by normalizing the Raman bands of a species of interest to those of a specific scattering species, which is assumed to remain unaffected with reaction time."
[3] "Progressive darkening of the catalytic solid due to e.g. coke formation during reaction leads to a decreasing RN and the proportionality between the Raman band intensities and the concentration of the corresponding species is no longer valid."
[4] "Fortunately, eqns. (1) and (2) then allow the calculation of the true Raman intensity (rI0) of such species assuming s to be constant."
[5] "The main advantage of the developed method is that no additional compound is required to quantify the measured Raman spectra."

1. Recent advancements in technology have significantly increased the usage of Raman spectroscopy as a tool for characterizing heterogeneous catalytic reaction systems.
2. Quantifying Raman spectra can be achieved by normalizing the bands of the species of interest to those of a scattering species that is assumed to stay constant over time.
3. Progressive darkening of the catalytic material, such as coke formation, causes a reduction in RN, making it difficult to maintain the proportional relationship between Raman band intensities and species concentration.
4. Equations (1) and (2) permit the determination of the true Raman intensity (rI0) of species, assuming the scattering coefficient s remains unchanged.
5. The primary benefit of the developed method is that it doesn't require additional substances for quantifying measured Raman spectra.

1. 最近的技术进步极大地增加了拉曼光谱作为表征异质催化反应系统物理化学信息工具的使用。
2. 量化拉曼光谱可以通过将感兴趣的物种的拉曼带归一化到假设在反应时间内保持不变的特定散射物种来实现。
3. 催化剂固体的渐进变暗，例如由于焦炭形成，导致RN减少，使得维持对应物种浓度与拉曼带强度之间的比例关系变得困难。
4. 方程(1)和(2)允许在假设散射系数s保持不变的情况下确定物种的真实拉曼强度(rI0)。
5. 开发的方法的主要优势是不需要额外的物质来量化测量的拉曼光谱。
