The document discusses the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) properties of various metal oxide catalysts, focusing on their ability to oxidize hydrogen in the presence of light hydrocarbons such as propane and propene. It highlights that In2O3/SiO2 and unsupported Bi2O3 are capable of selectively combusting hydrogen in a gas mixture containing propane and oxygen. Bi2O3/SiO2, in particular, demonstrates high activity and 90% selectivity for hydrogen combustion at low oxygen flows and 80% selectivity at stoichiometric amounts of oxygen. When propene is introduced into the gas mixture, Bi2O3/SiO2 and PbOx/SiO2 lose their selectivity for hydrogen combustion, instead favoring the combustion of propene. The selectivity for hydrogen combustion is attributed to differences in the electronic structure of the metal oxides, which influence their catalytic properties. This research contributes to the development of new dehydrogenation technologies by providing insight into the selection of efficient catalysts for hydrogen combustion processes.

The selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) properties of various metal-oxide catalysts have been studied under temperatures of 500°C and 550°C at atmospheric pressure. Some catalysts can selectively combust hydrogen in the presence of light hydrocarbons under specific reaction conditions. Among them, In2O3/SiO2 and unsupported Bi2O3 are capable of selectively combusting hydrogen in a gas mixture containing propane and oxygen. In2O3/SiO2 exhibits the highest activity. When propene is added to the gas mixture, Bi2O3/SiO2 and PbOx/SiO2 lose their ability to selectively combust hydrogen. In2O3/SiO2 demonstrates a high activity, with 90% selectivity at low oxygen flows and 80% selectivity at stoichiometric amounts of oxygen to water. The reasons for the selectivity of certain oxides remain unknown, but differences in their electronic structures correlate with their SHC properties.

These studies have focused on the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) properties of metal oxide catalysts, particularly at temperatures of 500°C and 550°C under atmospheric pressure. The research explores the potential for using these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, specifically aiming to improve the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in converting hydrogen in the presence of hydrocarbons. 

Metal oxides such as In2O3/SiO2 and unsupported Bi2O3 have shown the ability to selectively combust hydrogen in a gas mixture containing propane and oxygen. These catalysts demonstrate high selectivity, with In2O3/SiO2 achieving 90% selectivity at low oxygen flows, and both catalysts maintaining selectivity even in the presence of a high concentration of propene.

However, the behavior of other catalysts, like Bi2O3/SiO2 and PbOx/SiO2, changes significantly when propene is introduced into the gas mixture. These catalysts lose their selectivity towards hydrogen combustion, favoring the combustion of propene instead. The reason for the differing behavior of the indium catalyst compared to others remains unclear, and the studies suggest that further reaction investigations and characterizations of the catalysts' properties are needed to fully understand and optimize these processes.

The key technological advancements lie in identifying catalysts that maintain high selectivity for hydrogen combustion even in the presence of hydrocarbons. Areas for improvement involve refining the catalysts' electronic structure and understanding how different oxidation states and surface reactions influence their performance in selective hydrogen combustion.

这些研究重点探讨了金属氧化物催化剂的择性氢燃烧（SHC）特性，特别是在500°C和550°C下的大气压力下。研究旨在探索这些催化剂在氢气存在下使用时改善脱氢过程的催化效率和选择性。

金属氧化物，如In2O3/SiO2和无支撑的Bi2O3，在含有丙烷和氧气的气体混合物中显示出能够选择性地燃烧氢气的能力。这些催化剂表现出高选择性，在低氧流下可达到90%的选择性，并且即使在丙烯含量高的情况下也能保持选择性。

然而，其他催化剂，如Bi2O3/SiO2和PbOx/SiO2，在引入丙烯到气体混合物后其行为发生显著变化。这些催化剂失去对氢燃烧的选择性，反而倾向于燃烧丙烯。对于In催化剂与其他催化剂行为差异的原因仍不清楚，研究建议进一步进行反应研究和催化剂性质的表征，以全面理解并优化这些过程。

关键的技术进步在于识别出能够在含有碳氢化合物的情况下维持高选择性氢燃烧的催化剂。需要改进的领域包括改进催化剂的电子结构，以及理解不同氧化态和表面反应如何影响其性能。

These studies have shown that certain metal oxide catalysts can selectively combust hydrogen in the presence of hydrocarbons, such as propane. For instance, In2O3/SiO2 and unsupported Bi2O3 have demonstrated high selectivity in hydrogen combustion with propane and oxygen. However, the presence of propene significantly affects the selectivity of these catalysts, with Bi2O3/SiO2 and PbOx/SiO2 showing moderate properties under propene conditions but losing selectivity completely. The electronic structure of the metal oxides plays a crucial role in determining their SHC properties. The research suggests that materials with more reactive hydrogen compared to propane or propene are suitable for selective hydrogen combustion, with materials like Bi2O3, In2O3, and Sb2O4 being identified as potential candidates.

The literature focuses on the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) properties of metal oxide catalysts, particularly in the context of dehydrogenation technologies involving hydrogen and hydrocarbon gases. It highlights the ability of In2O3/SiO2 and unsupported Bi2O3 to selectively combust hydrogen in a gas mixture with propane and oxygen, with In2O3/SiO2 being the most active catalyst. The study also discusses the moderate properties of Bi2O3/SiO2 and PbOx/SiO2 in the presence of propane, and the inability of these catalysts to selectively combust hydrogen when propene is present. The literature suggests that the selectivity of these catalysts is linked to their surface reactions and electronic structures, indicating potential for further reaction studies and catalyst characterization to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of dehydrogenation processes. 

A recent study demonstrated that over a Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst at 500°C, 90% selectivity was achieved using a gas mixture with large amounts of propene. This highlights the potential of certain catalysts to provide in situ heating by oxidizing hydrogen, thereby improving the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

The paper aims to explore the SHC properties for metal oxide systems previously investigated by Grasselli and co-workers. It emphasizes the importance of understanding and improving the catalysts' properties, such as their oxidation states and other characteristics, to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of dehydrogenation processes.

In2O3/SiO2 is noted as the only catalyst tested that maintains good selectivity in the presence of propene. At low oxygen flows, it achieves a 90% selectivity to water, but this selectivity decreases with increasing oxygen flow. This behavior indicates the need for further studies on reaction dynamics and catalyst properties to optimize the use of these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

The necessity for additional research on the catalysts' active sites, oxidation states, and other properties is stressed to gain a deeper understanding and improve the performance of these catalysts. This includes detailed investigations into the electronic structures and surface reactions that contribute to the selective combustion of hydrogen and hydrocarbons.

Overall, the literature presents a comprehensive examination of metal oxide catalysts for selective hydrogen combustion, highlighting their potential applications in enhancing dehydrogenation technologies and suggesting avenues for future research to refine these catalysts' performance and broaden their industrial applicability.

文献主要关注金属氧化物催化剂在氢气和烃类气体环境下的选择性氢燃烧（SHC）性质，特别是在脱氢技术背景下。它强调了In2O3/SiO2和无支持的Bi2O3在丙烷和氧气存在的气体混合物中选择性燃烧氢气的能力，其中In2O3/SiO2被认为是活性最高的催化剂。研究还讨论了Bi2O3/SiO2和PbOx/SiO2在仅含丙烷的情况下表现良好，但在丙烯存在时无法选择性燃烧氢气。文献表明这些催化剂的选择性与其表面反应和电子结构有关，暗示有必要进行进一步的反应研究和催化剂表征，以提高脱氢过程的效率和可持续性。

最近的一项研究表明，在500°C下，使用大量丙烯的气体混合物，Pt-Sn/SiO2催化剂实现了90%的选择性。这凸显了某些催化剂通过氧化氢提供内部加热的潜力，从而改善轻烷烃的催化脱氢。

该论文旨在探索Grasselli及其同事之前研究的金属氧化物系统的选择性氢燃烧（SHC）性质。它强调了理解并改进催化剂性质，如氧化状态和其他特征的重要性，以提高脱氢过程的效率和可持续性。

In2O3/SiO2被指出是唯一在丙烯存在下仍能保持良好选择性的催化剂。在低氧流速下，它实现了90%的水选择性，但随着氧流速增加，选择性会下降。这种行为表明需要进一步研究反应动力学和催化剂特性，以优化这些催化剂在脱氢过程中的使用。

文献强调了对催化剂活性位点、氧化状态和其他特性的深入研究的必要性，以加深对选择性燃烧氢气和烃类的作用机制的理解，并改进这些催化剂的性能。这包括详细调查电子结构和表面反应如何影响氢和碳氢化合物的选择性燃烧。

总的来说，文献全面考察了金属氧化物催化剂的选择性氢燃烧性质，提出了它们在增强脱氢技术方面的潜在应用，并提出了未来研究方向，以精炼这些催化剂的性能并扩大其工业应用范围。
