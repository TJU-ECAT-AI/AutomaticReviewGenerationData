These studies have focused on the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) properties of metal oxide catalysts, particularly at temperatures of 500°C and 550°C under atmospheric pressure. The research explores the potential for using these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, specifically aiming to improve the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in converting hydrogen in the presence of hydrocarbons. 

Metal oxides such as In2O3/SiO2 and unsupported Bi2O3 have shown the ability to selectively combust hydrogen in a gas mixture containing propane and oxygen. These catalysts demonstrate high selectivity, with In2O3/SiO2 achieving 90% selectivity at low oxygen flows, and both catalysts maintaining selectivity even in the presence of a high concentration of propene.

However, the behavior of other catalysts, like Bi2O3/SiO2 and PbOx/SiO2, changes significantly when propene is introduced into the gas mixture. These catalysts lose their selectivity towards hydrogen combustion, favoring the combustion of propene instead. The reason for the differing behavior of the indium catalyst compared to others remains unclear, and the studies suggest that further reaction investigations and characterizations of the catalysts' properties are needed to fully understand and optimize these processes.

The key technological advancements lie in identifying catalysts that maintain high selectivity for hydrogen combustion even in the presence of hydrocarbons. Areas for improvement involve refining the catalysts' electronic structure and understanding how different oxidation states and surface reactions influence their performance in selective hydrogen combustion.

这些研究重点探讨了金属氧化物催化剂的择性氢燃烧（SHC）特性，特别是在500°C和550°C下的大气压力下。研究旨在探索这些催化剂在氢气存在下使用时改善脱氢过程的催化效率和选择性。

金属氧化物，如In2O3/SiO2和无支撑的Bi2O3，在含有丙烷和氧气的气体混合物中显示出能够选择性地燃烧氢气的能力。这些催化剂表现出高选择性，在低氧流下可达到90%的选择性，并且即使在丙烯含量高的情况下也能保持选择性。

然而，其他催化剂，如Bi2O3/SiO2和PbOx/SiO2，在引入丙烯到气体混合物后其行为发生显著变化。这些催化剂失去对氢燃烧的选择性，反而倾向于燃烧丙烯。对于In催化剂与其他催化剂行为差异的原因仍不清楚，研究建议进一步进行反应研究和催化剂性质的表征，以全面理解并优化这些过程。

关键的技术进步在于识别出能够在含有碳氢化合物的情况下维持高选择性氢燃烧的催化剂。需要改进的领域包括改进催化剂的电子结构，以及理解不同氧化态和表面反应如何影响其性能。
