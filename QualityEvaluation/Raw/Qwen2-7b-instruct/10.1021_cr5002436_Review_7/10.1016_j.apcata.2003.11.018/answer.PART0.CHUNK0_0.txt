[4] "Some catalysts were found to show the ability to combust hydrogen in a gas mixture with propane and oxygen with good selectivity."
[5] "Bi2O3/SiO2 and PbOx/SiO2 show moderate properties as selective hydrogen combustion catalysts in the presence of propene, but are unselective with propene in the gas phase."

The document discusses the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) properties of various metal oxide catalysts, focusing on their ability to oxidize hydrogen in the presence of light hydrocarbons such as propane and propene. It highlights that In2O3/SiO2 and unsupported Bi2O3 are capable of selectively combusting hydrogen in a gas mixture containing propane and oxygen. Bi2O3/SiO2, in particular, demonstrates high activity and 90% selectivity for hydrogen combustion at low oxygen flows and 80% selectivity at stoichiometric amounts of oxygen. When propene is introduced into the gas mixture, Bi2O3/SiO2 and PbOx/SiO2 lose their selectivity for hydrogen combustion, instead favoring the combustion of propene. The selectivity for hydrogen combustion is attributed to differences in the electronic structure of the metal oxides, which influence their catalytic properties. This research contributes to the development of new dehydrogenation technologies by providing insight into the selection of efficient catalysts for hydrogen combustion processes.

本文探讨了几种金属氧化物催化剂的选择性氢燃烧（SHC）特性，重点关注它们在轻烃如丙烷和丙烯存在的条件下氧化氢的能力。研究指出，In2O3/SiO2和无支撑Bi2O3能够选择性地在含有丙烷和氧气的气体混合物中燃烧氢气。其中，In2O3/SiO2尤其表现出高活性和在低氧流下的90%氢选择性燃烧率，在与水反应时为80%的氧流比。当丙烯被引入到气体混合物中时，Bi2O3/SiO2和PbOx/SiO2失去了对氢燃烧的选择性，反而更倾向于燃烧丙烯。氢燃烧选择性的差异归因于金属氧化物的电子结构差异，这影响了它们的催化性能。这项研究为高效催化剂的选择提供了见解，促进了氢燃烧过程的新脱氢技术的发展。
