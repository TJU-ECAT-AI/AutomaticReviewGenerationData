[1] "Grasselli and co-workers [57] investigated oxide catalysts for SHC. Several catalyst candidates (metal oxides and mixed metal oxides) were com- pared using a gravimetric investigation of reduction rates in hydrogen and hydrocarbon gases, respectively [5]."
[2] "Over a Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst at 500 C 90% selectivity was achieved using a gas mix- ture with large amounts of propene."
[3] "The main difference be- tween our experiments compared to the results of the other groups, is that we had a co-injection of hydrogen in the feed."
[4] "The 50 wt.%In2O3/SiO2 was found to be the most active and selective catalysts for the SHC under these conditions."
[5] "The unsupported Bi2O3 shows an excel- lent selectivity in the desired SHC reaction in the presence of propane, but its activity is not as high as the case is for the indium catalyst."
[6] "In2O3/SiO2 is the only catalyst tested here that is a good SHC catalyst also in the presence of propene."
[7] "It has been suggested [6,7] that the SHC properties of the metal oxides are linked with a certain electron configuration."

These studies have shown that certain metal oxide catalysts can selectively combust hydrogen in the presence of hydrocarbons, such as propane. For instance, In2O3/SiO2 and unsupported Bi2O3 have demonstrated high selectivity in hydrogen combustion with propane and oxygen. However, the presence of propene significantly affects the selectivity of these catalysts, with Bi2O3/SiO2 and PbOx/SiO2 showing moderate properties under propene conditions but losing selectivity completely. The electronic structure of the metal oxides plays a crucial role in determining their SHC properties. The research suggests that materials with more reactive hydrogen compared to propane or propene are suitable for selective hydrogen combustion, with materials like Bi2O3, In2O3, and Sb2O4 being identified as potential candidates.

这些研究发现，某些金属氧化物催化剂可以在烃类气体如丙烷的存在下选择性地燃烧氢气。例如，In2O3/SiO2和无支撑Bi2O3在丙烷和氧气的存在下表现出高选择性。然而，在丙烯存在下，这些催化剂的选择性会受到显著影响，Bi2O3/SiO2和PbOx/SiO2在丙烯条件下显示适度的性能，但在丙烯条件下完全失去选择性。金属氧化物的电子结构在决定其选择性氢燃烧性质方面起着关键作用。研究表明，与丙烷或丙烯反应更活跃的材料更适合选择性氢燃烧，材料如Bi2O3、In2O3和Sb2O4被确认为潜在候选者。
