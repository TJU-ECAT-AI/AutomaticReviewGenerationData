The selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) properties of various metal-oxide catalysts have been studied under temperatures of 500°C and 550°C at atmospheric pressure. Some catalysts can selectively combust hydrogen in the presence of light hydrocarbons under specific reaction conditions. Among them, In2O3/SiO2 and unsupported Bi2O3 are capable of selectively combusting hydrogen in a gas mixture containing propane and oxygen. In2O3/SiO2 exhibits the highest activity. When propene is added to the gas mixture, Bi2O3/SiO2 and PbOx/SiO2 lose their ability to selectively combust hydrogen. In2O3/SiO2 demonstrates a high activity, with 90% selectivity at low oxygen flows and 80% selectivity at stoichiometric amounts of oxygen to water. The reasons for the selectivity of certain oxides remain unknown, but differences in their electronic structures correlate with their SHC properties.

在500°C和550°C的温度以及大气压下，研究了几种金属氧化物催化剂的选择性氢燃烧（SHC）性质。一些催化剂能够在特定反应条件下选择性地燃烧氢气与轻质烃类共存。其中，In2O3/SiO2和支持的Bi2O3能够选择性地在丙烷和氧气存在的气体混合物中燃烧氢气，In2O3/SiO2表现出最高的活性。当丙烯添加到气体混合物中时，Bi2O3/SiO2和PbOx/SiO2丧失了选择性燃烧氢气的能力。In2O3/SiO2表现出高活性，在低氧流速时具有90%的选择性，在氧气与水的化学计量比下具有80%的选择性。选择性氧化的原因尚不清楚，但这些氧化物的电子结构差异与其SHC性质相关联。
