Olefins are easily functionalized by oxidation, coupling reactions, halogenation, and form important value chains. Propylene, for example, forms the basis for important chemicals and products such as polypropylene, oxo alcohols, propylene oxide, acrylic acid, cumene, and many others. Since the principal method of producing olefins is by steam cracking of naphtha, the ratio of propylene to ethylene is limited by chemical equilibrium to approximately 35:100 to 65:100 [1]. Because of the increase in production of polypropylene, there is therefore a gap between supply and demand. As such, the production of olefins from alkanes is an important goal. However, the reactions leading to the olefin must be economical and technically feasible.
Propylene is produced by four principle means [1]: (1) as a by-product from steam cracking of naphtha; (2) from fluid catalytic cracking off-gas; (3) by dehydrogenation of propane and; (4) metathesis of butylene and ethylene. A potentially viable method of producing propylene is by oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane (Eq. 1) $$ {\text{C}}_{3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} \left({\text{g}} \right) + {{1/2}{\rm{O}}_{{\rm{2}}}} \left( {\text{g}} \right) \to {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 6} \left( {\text{g}} \right) + {\text{H}}_{ 2} {\text{O}}\left( {\text{g}} \right)\quad\Updelta {\text{H}} = - 1 3 9\,{\text{kJ}}/{\text{mol}} $$ (1) The reaction is exothermic and the potential yield is not thermodynamically limited. The high severity of the endothermic propane dehydrogenation by conventional means is overcome and the process could be operated under mild conditions. The main problem that catalysts for the ODH reaction for propane face is how to activate selectively the CH bond in propane without oxidizing the weaker CH bond in propylene or oxidize the reactive double bond. Because of the consecutive nature of these reactions (see Fig. 1), the maximum yield of propylene in practice is modest.
Fig. 1 Reaction network observed over V-catalysts Full size image Vanadium containing catalysts have been intensely investigated for the ODH reaction since the late 1980s (see [24] and references therein). The reaction network commonly accepted is shown in Fig. 1. In order to maximize the propylene yield, one has to minimize the parallel and consecutive reactions leading to CO/CO2 as the reaction products.
The top reaction leading to formation of methane and ethylene from cracking of propane is known to be caused by acid sites on the catalysts. The deep oxidation pathways (k2 and k3) can also be caused by the support having excess hydroxyl groups (Brnsted acidity). Therefore these reactions should be influenced by the type of support used for vanadium catalysts and also the vanadium loading. Indeed, this is observed in previous experimental studies [5]. On the other hand, the ratio of k4/k1 largely determines the amount of consecutive reactions and is mainly influenced by the nature of the active site. Khodakov et al. [6] did not see a shift in the ratio of these rate constants with a change of the support material. On the other hand, Shee et al. [7] concluded that V2O5 supported on titania of high surface area was a promising system because of maximal k4/k1 ratio expected to be achieved with these materials. However, among the tested catalysts, 10% V2O5/alumina had the highest ratio.
We have focused on silica supported vanadia catalysts because of the absence of cracking and deep oxidation reactions observed over this support. High surface areas enable the dispersion of significant amounts of vanadia at low surface densities (V/nm2). We investigated the kinetics of the ODH reaction of propane over such catalysts and found a surprisingly high propylene formation rate per gram vanadium at low vanadia loadings and high surface area of the support. 2 Experimental
2.1 Sample Preparation
Merck grade 10181 Silica Gel (Aldrich; 200500 micron particle size; SA = 675 m2/g) or MCM-41 (purchased from Aldrich; SA = 906 m2/g) is impregnated to incipient wetness with an aqueous solution of ammonium vanadate in 1.5 M aqueous oxalic acid. Incipient wetness impregnation and calcination is done twice for high vanadia loadings (15%). As synthesized catalysts are dried at 353 K for 4 h, and 393 K for 4 h. Finally the samples are calcined at 873 K for 2 h. 5 wt.% Niobia is deposited in a second impregnation step using an aqueous solution of ammonium niobium oxalate (CBMM Brazil), followed by drying and calcination as above.
Other vanadium precursors were used as well. Preparations included incipient wetness impregnation using the solution of the precursor (see list below, with solvent in parentheses), followed by drying and calcination as described above. Vanadium precursors were VOSO4 (H2O), V(acac)3 (CH3OH), NH4VO3 (H2O or CH3OH), V(i-propoxide)3 (i-propanol). In the case of NH4VO3 several impregnations were done to achieve the desired metal loading. The chemicals were obtained from Aldrich.
2.2 Characterization
The vanadium content of the samples was determined using inductively coupled plasma analyses of dissolved catalysts using standard wet chemical methods.
Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of catalysts was measured on a Micromeritics Autochem II unit. Approximately 10 mg of sample was heated in 0.5% O2/He to 773 K to remove any water from the surface and to oxidize the sample. After cooling to room temperature the sample is heated in 50 mL/min of 5% H2/N2 at 10 C/min to 973 K while the hydrogen consumption is recorded using a TCD detector.
For X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) a PANalytical MPD XPert Pro diffraction system was used to collect data. CuKÎ± radiation was used in the analysis. The samples were first prepared by grinding in a mortar and pestle and then backpacking the sample into a round mount.
2.3 Activity Measurements
Activity measurement were done in a vertically mounted fritted quartz tube reactor of 10 mm inner diameter (o.d. is 12.5 mm (1/2)). 0.1 to 1.0 g of catalyst was loaded. In case of catalyst amounts smaller than 1.0 g, the catalyst was diluted with Davisil grade 646 silica gel to 1.0 g total amount to keep the linear velocity constant. Control experiments with only silica showed propane conversion below 0.3% at 773 K, increasing to 2% at 848 K. The feed gas 10% propane, 5% oxygen, balance nitrogen was mixed via a manifold of mass flow controllers, and then fed via a secondary mass flow controller to the reactor. The excess of feed gas could also be analyzed via gas chromatography (GC). Analysis was done using a Varian 3800 GC equipped with HaysepQ/Mol Sieve 5A (TCD for H2, CO, CO2, N2, O2) and Porabond-Q columns (flame ionization detector for hydrocarbons).
Conversion and selectivity are reported on a C3 mol% basis based on all products formed. $$ {\text{C}}_{3} \;{\text{Conv.}}={\text{all carbon containing products formed (calculated on a}} \;{\text{C}}_{3} \;{\text{basis)}} / {\text{(propane fed)}} \times 100\%$$ $$ {\text{C}}_{3}{=}\;{\text{Sel.}} ={\text{propylene formed/all C-containing products formed (on a}} \;{\text{C}}_{3} \;{\text{basis)}} \times 100\%$$ Nitrogen was used as the internal standard since water could not be detected with this GC so the volume dilution is taken into account. If the analysis is done based on the converted propane a larger error occurs due to the high excess of nitrogen as the internal standard and small conversion. 3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Influence of V2O5 Loading on the Performance of Supported Vanadium Catalysts
Several vanadium containing catalysts based on a commercially available silica gel were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using vanadium oxalate in aqueous solution as the vanadium oxide precursor. The vanadium loading, surface area and resulting vanadium surface density are listed in Table 1. The surface density (V/nm2) is calculated using the weight% V2O5 loading and the BET surface area of the catalysts. For monolayers of monovanadate (R3V=O) and polyvanadate (R2V(O)OV(O)R2) the theoretical surface densities are 1.3 and 7.5 VOx/nm2, respectively [8]. Therefore, the surface density should give an indication of the vanadium species present on the catalyst [6, 8]. The vanadium loading was varied between 1.25 and 12.5%. The surface area of the catalysts decreases with increasing vanadium loading from 541 m2/g (1.25-V) to 258 m2/g (12.5-V), and the resulting surface loadings vary from 0.23 to 4.85 V/nm2 (Table 1).
Table 1 Physical properties of V-silica catalysts supported on silica gel Full size table Khodakov et al. [6] have found by XRD and Raman spectroscopy that no V2O5 crystallites are formed below 1.0 V/nm2. XRD data for the catalysts 2.5-, 5- and 10-V is shown in Fig. 2. No crystalline V2O5 is seen in samples up to 5% V2O5 loading. At higher V2O5 loading peaks for crystalline V2O2 appear, as seen for the sample 10-V in Fig. 2. XRD is a relatively insensitive method for the detection of crystallites [9], and does not give the relative distribution of crystalline versus dispersed vanadia. We decided to characterize the materials also by H2-TPR, shown in Fig. 3. TPR shows the reduction temperature of vanadium and the relative amount of material in each state. Arena et al. have correlated the vanadia dispersion directly with relative intensity of the lowest temperature reduction peak in the TPR [10]. The TPR of catalysts 1.25- to 12.5-V is shown in Fig. 3. Peak fitting results are shown in Table 2. A single reduction peak is observed at 809818 K for the samples 1.25-, 2.5- and 5-V. For the 3.5-V sample there is a small contribution from a peak at 906 K. At higher loading than 5% multiple peaks are detected. The TPR can be fit to three peaks for the 10-V sample and four peaks for 12.5-V sample. The low temperature peaks (<830 K) are assigned to isolated V=O tetrahedral species on the support [1014]. At higher loadings peaks appear at >830 K which are assigned to the reduction of polymeric VOV (830900 K) and bulk V2O5 crystallites (>900 K) [10]. These results are consistent with the observance of V2O5 crystallites in V/silica samples of higher than 1 V/nm2 loading in XRD (Fig. 2) and also by Khodakov using Raman spectroscopy [6]. The calculated monolayer V2O5 coverage for polymeric V2O5 is 7.5 V/nm2 and for isolated V2O5 is 2.3 V/nm2. Thus only 4050% of the monolayer coverage of isolated V2O5 can be achieved on this particular silica support before V2O5 crystallites begin to form.Fig. 2 XRD of samples with 2.5, 5 and 10% V2O5 loading Full size image Fig. 3 H2-TPR of V-silica catalysts shown in Table 1 Full size image Table 2 Peak-fitting results for the TPR traces shown in Fig. 3 Full size table The catalysts were measured for propane ODH using 10% propane, 5% O2, balance N2 as the feed gas at reaction temperatures between 723 and 873 K. A conversionselectivity plot for the described catalysts is shown in Fig. 4. The data is provided in numeric form in Table 3. Catalysts with vanadium oxide loadings above 5% (>1 V/nm2) showed lower propylene selectivity, and even at low propane conversion, combustion of propane can be detected. Catalysts with vanadium oxide loading below 5% show high selectivity for the ODH reaction at low conversion. Greater than 90% selectivity to propylene is achieved only at propane conversions below 5%. The reaction rate per gram of vanadium for the catalysts was determined at 773 K at propane conversions below 10%. The normalized propene formation rate (per gram V) is shown in Table 3 and it is plotted in Fig. 5 against the vanadium loading. Based on the results from the TPR and XRD as well as the conversionselectivity plot one would expect a constant propene formation rate up to 5% V2O5 loading and a decline in the rate above 5% loading. This is based on the conjecture that dispersed vanadia seen by TPR on catalysts below 5% V2O5 loading should contribute equally to the reaction rate. However, we see that the propylene formation rate decreases with increasing V2O5-loading strongly even below 5% V2O5 loading and further declines with increasing the loading to 12.5%. In fact, a catalyst containing 1.25% V2O5 has a propylene formation rate per gram of vanadium about 80% higher than a catalyst containing 2.5% V2O5. This is a surprising result, given that at these low loadings the surface coverage is only 1020% of monolayer coverage for isolated V2O5, no second reduction peak in the TPR is observed, and the selectivity for all the low-loading vanadia catalysts is very high at low conversion. Interestingly, the sample 3.5-V which displays a small second reduction peak also shows lower selectivity in the reaction compared to the 2.5- and 5-V samples. Thus, we speculate that primarily isolated V=O groups are active sites in the ODH reaction. Crystalline V2O5 leads to significantly reduced selectivity in the ODH reaction. Even though we are below the calculated monolayer loading of isolated V=O groups, a considerable amount of polymeric VOV may form at low vanadia loadings. The polymeric VOV groups may have lower activity in the ODH reaction.Fig. 4 Conversionselectivity plot of V2O5/silica catalysts shown in Table 1 with different V2O5 loading.

3.2 Influence of Vanadium Precursor, Niobium Addition and Type of Silica Support on Catalytic Performance
We prepared V2O5/silica using various V2O5-precursors to see any influence on the reaction rate or selectivity. In addition, we prepared vanadia catalysts on high surface area silica support material to see if the reaction rate could be further increased by simply increasing the surface area of the support. Niobium oxide was deposited after vanadium to see the influence on the reactivity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Niobium oxide is known to have acidic properties and was previously incorporated into MCM-41 materials by impregnation [15]. Even though acid sites may lead to propane cracking and combustion, niobium was used as support for vanadia catalysts with good results as well [1618]. Properties of a selected number of materials are shown in Table 4.
Table 4 Properties of selected catalysts; performance of 1 g catalyst measured (except values denoted *) Full size table The surface area of 5% vanadia/silica gel materials (519611 m2/g) is dependent on the vanadia precursor. The lowest surface areas were found for the impregnation with solutions in organic solvents (methanol, i-propanol). The highest surface area was actually found for a sulfur containing vanadium (IV) compound (VOSO4) as the vanadia precursor. The vanadium is oxidized in the calcination step to V2O5.All materials besides V2O5/MCM-41 showed high selectivity to propylene at low propane conversions, similar to the observations for catalysts above with vanadium surface densities of <1 V/nm2 (see Fig. 4). No influence of the precursor was found on the conversionselectivity curve for any of the catalysts besides V2O5/MCM-41. The propylene formation rates at 773 K are similar for all vanadia precursors as well, but vary with the surface area of the final catalyst. The reaction rate is slightly lower for bi-metallic catalysts as compared to pure vanadium catalysts. Interestingly, a linear trend is seen if the vanadium surface density of the catalysts is plotted against the propylene formation rate (Fig. 6). The only exception is the V-MCM-41 material. The propylene selectivity for V2O5/MCM-41 was low even though the propane conversion rate was very high (Fig. 6). This catalyst catalyzed predominantly the propane combustion reaction (k2 or k3 in Fig. 1 was very high). The selectivity to propylene was only 16%, even at low propane conversion (<10%).Fig. 6 Propylene formation rate over V-silica and V-Nb-silica catalysts with 5% V2O5 loading (samples shown in Tables 3, 4) Full size image Temperature programmed reduction data for the MCM-41 supported catalysts is shown in Fig. 7. Besides the familiar reduction at around 770820 K a new low temperature reduction at 520550 K is seen for this material. Interestingly, such a low temperature feature was not reported by other authors working with V2O5/MCM-41 before [9, 19, 20]. In the same way, other authors did not find low ODH selectivity and high combustion activity for these catalysts. These vanadium atoms must be in a form which favors their reduction, i.e. having a strong support interaction, being in a strained environment or coordinatively unsaturated.Fig. 7 H2-TPR of 5% V2O5/MCM-41 (black) and 5% V2O5-5% Nb2O5/MCM-41 (grey) Full size image The addition of niobium to the material reduces the contribution of this reduction peak significantly and also reduces the propane combustion activity. The surface area of the bimetallic vanadium-niobium catalyst is actually slightly increased from 899 to 933 m2/g. This unusual behavior could be caused by niobium inducing structural changes in MCM-41 as previously observed by Kilos et al. [21]. The changes observed in the TPR after niobium incorporation are shown in Fig. 7. The conversionselectivity curves and oxygen conversion for V/MCM-41 and V-Nb/MCM-41 are shown in Fig. 8. The propylene selectivity for V-Nb/MCM-41 is similar to the pure vanadium catalysts supported on silica gel at propane conversions above 15% (temperature > 773 K). Since the surface area of the material is very high, the unique structure of the supported vanadia (see Fig. 7) results in an extremely high propylene formation rate per gram vanadium for this catalyst. The deposition of niobium oxide inhibits, but does not eliminate the fast propane combustion reaction.Fig. 8 Propane and oxygen conversion for 5% V2O5/MCM-41 (triangles) and 5% V2O5-5% Nb2O5/MCM-41 (squares) Full size image The addition of niobium to silica gel supported vanadium catalysts only reduces the surface area of the material and therefore reduces the reaction rate (see Table 4 and Fig. 6). Since the vanadium is deposited in a first impregnation step, this second impregnation should not influence to vanadium dispersion, but may bury some of vanadium present in closed pores and under niobium oxide. This is not the case for the V-Nb/MCM-41 catalyst. Here, niobium selectively deactivates the sites responsible for propane combustion. 4 Conclusions Vanadium catalysts supported on silica gel show high selectivity in the propane ODH reaction at low vanadia loadings, as previously reported in the literature. An increasing propylene formation rate per gram vanadia is seen at low vanadia loading (<5 wt%), even though no change in the state of vanadia is seen by XRD, TPR or by the catalytic behavior of the catalyst. This may be due to the presence of increasing fraction of isolated V=O sites on catalysts at the lowest loadings. Deposition of niobia on the catalysts reduced the propylene formation rate, but does not change the selectivity for the ODH reaction. The propylene formation rate for all catalysts, irrespective of the vanadia precursor, and independent of the presence of niobia could be fit to a linear plot of propylene formation rate versus surface density of vanadia.Vanadia supported on MCM-41 is an exception, as new sites appear with an unusually low reduction temperature in TPR. This leads to low propylene selectivity in the ODH reaction. By depositing niobia in a second step the number of these new sites is diminished and high selectivity to propylene is restored at a much higher propylene formation rate per gram vanadium because of the high surface area available for supporting vanadia. We therefore speculate that isolated tetrahedral vanadia sites may be responsible for the high reaction rates at low vanadia loading, and condensed surface oxide layers have a lower reaction rate. None of the catalysts could overcome the low selectivity at conversions higher than 10%, as the active sites did not change fundamentally (ratio of k4/k1 and k3/k1 in Fig. 1), but only the propylene formation rate per gram vanadium was influenced.
