Platinum-based materials are widely used in petrochemical and refining processes, such as alkane dehydrogenation.1 Sn inhibits cracking, isomerization, and coke formation on Pt supported on Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2,24 MgAl2O4,5 and KL zeolite.6 Sn also increases Pt dispersion and catalyst stability in Pt/g-Al2O3,2 but dehydrogenation rates decrease rapidly with time. PtGa/ MgAl2O4,7 Pt/silicalite, and PtZn/silicalite8 also show higher selectivity and stability than Pt/g-Al2O3. Here, we report a novel catalyst with unprecedented site activity and stability for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. Exchanged Pt cations (0.10 wt%) in ZSM5 with Fe3+ in framework positions and Na as balancing cations lead to high alkene selectivities, near- equilibrium alkene yields, and turnover rates and stability significantly higher than previously reported. Deactivation rate constants during C3H8 dehydrogenation are more than ten times smaller than on PtSn.2 [Fe]ZSM5 was prepared in NH4+ form using known methods {0.44 wt% Fe, (Si/Fe)at = 200}.9 Al was present in trace amounts (0.03 wt%). The NH3/Fe ratio during NH4+-[Fe]ZSM5 decomposition was 1.1, indicating that Fe was located at framework positions. NH4+-[Fe]ZSM5 was exchanged thrice with 0.024 M NaNO3 (Fisher, 0.5 l g21) at 353 K for 15 h to form Na+-[Fe]ZSM5. Pt cations were introduced by exchange from 0.001 M Pt(NH4)4(NO3)2 (Johnson-Mathey/Aesar) aque- ous solutions. The Pt dispersion measured from uptakes of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen at 293 K was 0.95, indicating that Pt clusters are small ( < 1 nm). Rates and selectivities were measured in a tubular plug-flow reactor. Samples (0.03 g) were treated in 40% H2/He at 773 K for 3 h before rate measurements.Rates are reported as reactant conversion or product formation rates (mol/g-atom Pt-s), which represent turnover rates because of the nearly complete dispersion of Pt clusters. Selectivities are reported on a carbon basis. Forward reaction rates (rf) were obtained from measured rates (rnet) using rf = rnet/(1 2 h),where the approach to equilibrium (h) depends on reaction thermodynamics and on prevalent pressures of reactants and products. Deactivation first-order rate constants (kd) were determined from forward rates; mean catalyst life (t) is defined as the reciprocal of the first-order deactivation rate constant.C3H8 dehydrogenation rates were measured on 0.10 wt% Pt/ Na-[Fe]ZSM5 at 793 K and 25 kPa C3H8. C3H6 yields were near equilibrium (Table 1; 35% vs. 36%) at 4.1 mol C3H8/g-atom Pt- s space velocity and the C3H6 selectivity was 97%. The net C3H6 formation turnover rate was 1.4 mol C3H8/g-atom Pt-s,which exceeds rates on 0.35 wt% PtSn/g-Al2O3 (1.1 mol C3H8/g-atom Pt-s at 31% conversion; 30 kPa, 792 K, 3.5 mol C3H8/g-atom Pt-s).2 Net C3H6 formation rates decreased as dehydrogenation approached equilibrium with increasing resi- dence time, but forward reaction rates did not change sig- nificantly (Table 1). C3H6 selectivities were very high (97%) and similar to those reported on 0.35 wt% PtSn/g-Al2O3 (9598%).2 C2H4/C2H6 ratios were above equilibrium values (e.g. 0.31 vs. 0.14, at 78.9 mol C3H8/g-atom Pt-s), indicating that C2H4 forms together with CH4 in slow b-scission reactions on weak acid sites in [Fe]ZSM5, while C2H6 forms by C2H4 hydrogenation. Acid sites form during reduction of exchanged Pt cations in Na-[Fe]ZSM5. Hydrogenolysis reactions were not detected, confirming the presence of small Pt clusters.10 Larger hydrocarbons were formed in trace amounts ( < 1% selectivity, Table 1), suggesting that Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 does not effectively catalyze oligomerization-cracking cycles, which occur on H- [Al]ZSM5 and form larger alkenes and aromatics.11 Fig. 1 shows C3H6 formation rates and selectivities on 0.1 wt% Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 at 793 K for 160 h. C3H6 selectivities initially increased sharply and then more gradually with time on stream (98.3% to 99.8%, Fig. 1), because weak acid sites responsible for b-scission deactivate during reaction. Forward C3H6 formation rates decreased from 16.7 to 3.0 moles C3H8/g- atom Pt-s during 160 h (Fig. 1). Forward reaction rates are also shown for 0.35 wt% PtSn/g-Al2O3 at 792 K and 3.5 mol C3H8/ g-atom Pt-s space velocity.2 Deactivation rates decreased with time on stream on both catalysts, apparently because concentra- tions of alkenes and acid sites also decreased as deactivation Table 1 C3H8 dehydrogenation reactions on 0.1 wt% Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5a Carbon selectivity (%) Space velocity (mol C3H8/ g-atom Pt-s) Residence time (s g-atom Pt/mol C3H8)

occurred. Deactivation rate constants then reached constant values of 0.008 h21 (t = 125 h) on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 and 0.11 h21 (t = 9 h) on PtSn/g-Al2O3.
Table 2 compares C3H8 dehydrogenation rate, selectivity,and stability for the best reported catalysts. Non-acidic supports and PtSn clusters led to higher stability and C3H6 selectivity than Pt clusters on g-Al2O3 or SiO2 supports.5 PtGa/MgAl2O4 shows higher rates, selectivity, and stability than PtSn/ MgAl2O4.8 These catalysts were more stable (t  20 h) than Pt Sn/g-Al2O3 (t = 9 h) but much less stable than Pt/Na- [Fe]ZSM5 (t = 125 h, Table 2). Pt/silicalite gave very low rates, even at temperatures much higher than for Pt/Na- [Fe]ZSM5.9 Pt/Zn/silicalite showed very high stability (t = 100 h), only slightly lower than Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 (Table 2),suggesting that Pt clusters within protective 10-ring channels and the substantial absence of acid sites inhibit deactivation processes. Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 gave substantially higher reaction rates and catalyst stability than these state-of-the-art Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts.
Fig. 2 shows isobutane dehydrogenation rates and selectiv- ities (793 K, 33 kPa i-C4H10, 7 kPa H2, 22 mol i-C4H10/g-atom Pt-s) on 0.1 wt% Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 for 130 h. H2 was used to inhibit deactivation near the bed inlet, as also used in previous studies.3,6 Initial C4H8 selectivities were 96.5% and increased gradually with time to 98.6% (Fig. 2). i-C4H8 selectivities within C4 alkene products also increased (94% to 96%), because of deactivation of acid sites responsible for b-scission and isomerization. Initial forward i-C4H8 formation rates were 9.3 mol i-C4H8/g-atom Pt-s at 20% conversion (46% equilibrium conversion). The deactivation constant was 0.004 h21 between 20 and 470 ks (t = 250 h). Similar data on (0.58 wt%) PtSn/ KL zeolite,6 which exhibits the best previously reported activity, selectivity, and stability in i-C4H8 dehydrogenation,are shown in Fig. 2 at 873 K, 33 kPa i-C4H10, 67 kPa H2 pressure, and 2.1 mol i-C4H10/g-atom Pt-s space velocity,6 conditions leading to equilibrium conversions of 58%. Initial forward rates on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 at 793 K were higher than on PtSn/KL at 873 K (7 mol i-C4H8/g-atom Pt-s). Deactivation constants were lower on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 (0.004 h21) than on PtSn/KL (0.008 h21) even at the lower H2 pressures (7 kPa vs. 67 kPa) on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5. Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 gave higher rates at 80 K lower temperature, as well as better stability with much lower H2 addition requirements.
Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 used previously in C3H8 (Fig. 1) and i- C4H10 reactions (Fig. 2) were treated in 1% O2/He at 723 K for 2 h. Then, dehydrogenation was carried out on each catalyst for 50 h. These treatments restored initial rates (16.1 vs. 16.7 mol C3H8/g-atom Pt-s, 8.8 vs. 9.3 mol i-C4H10/g-atom Pt-s) and selectivities (98.7% vs. 98.3% C3H6, 97.0% vs. 96.5% C4H8).
Mean catalyst lives for regenerated catalysts were also similar to those of fresh catalysts (112 h vs. 125 h for C3H8, 220 h vs. 250 h for i-C4H10).
We conclude that replacing Al3+ with Fe3+ in the ZSM-5 framework retains exchange sites required for anchoring of Pt precursors. This leads to well-dispersed Pt clusters, which can be accommodated within the protected environment of 10-ring zeolite channels in ZSM5. The weaker acidity of {FeOHSi} compared with {AlOHSi} leads in turn to higher alkene selectivity and catalytic stability. These weaker acid sites give lower rates of acid-catalyzed alkene oligomerization and cyclization reactions, and consequently lower yields of aro- matics and unreactive organic residues, as recently reported for H-[Fe]ZSM5.12 We achieve these improvements without rely- ing on bimetallic clusters, which can unmix during oxidative regenerations, and without significant H2 partial pressures in alkane reactant streams. These novel materials can be fully regenerated using mild-oxidative treaments without a detect- able decrease in Pt dispersion, zeolite crystallinity, or catalytic selectivities and to lower rates of undesired side reactions.
