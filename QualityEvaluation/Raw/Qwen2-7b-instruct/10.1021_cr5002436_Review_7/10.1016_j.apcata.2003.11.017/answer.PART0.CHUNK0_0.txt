[1] "In this communication we present experimental results showing that under certain reaction conditions the selective combustion of hydrogen in the presence of light hydrocarbons is possible over a PtSn/SiO2 catalyst."
[2] "If propene is added to the gas mixture, Sn is no longer able to selectively combust hydrogen."
[3] "As soon as the oxygen flow exceeds half the amount of hydrogen, the selectivity to COx increases at the expense of water."
[4] "The results show that a metallic catalyst system like supported PtSn can provide a similar effect as the oxide catalysts described earlier [57]."
[5] "Based on this it is possible to speculate that the PtSn/SiO2 system used here has adsorption properties favouring hydrogen adsorption in competition with hydrocarbons, and thereby promoting subsequent reaction with adsorbed oxygen."

Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have significantly influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. Shale gas production has led to an abundance of inexpensive feedstocks, which has driven the demand for efficient dehydrogenation processes capable of utilizing these resources effectively. Key technological advancements in this area include the development of more selective and stable catalysts, improved reactor designs, and enhanced process integration strategies. Current limitations include high energy consumption, particularly for endothermic dehydrogenation reactions, and the challenge of achieving high product purity while maintaining high conversion rates. Areas for improvement focus on enhancing catalyst performance, optimizing operating conditions, and developing more sustainable process routes that minimize environmental impact and reduce costs. These advancements aim to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation processes for olefin production.
