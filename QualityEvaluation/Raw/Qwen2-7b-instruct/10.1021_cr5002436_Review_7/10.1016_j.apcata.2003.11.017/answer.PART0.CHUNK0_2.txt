[1] "The selective production of light alkenes, especially propene, via catalytic dehydrogenation (DH), reaction (1),is an important reaction, but the process often suffers from poor economy."
[2] "The strong endothermic character of the equilibrium limited Eq. (1) (H= 124 kJ/mol)"
[3] "Catalytic stability of the PtSn is shown for the different gas mixtures (propane,propane/H2, propane/O2 and propane/H2/O2)."
[4] "The reason for this could be that oxygen (or the water formed in the reaction) continuously removes coke or coke precursors deposited on the catalyst."
[5] "The conversion of propane over PtSn is higher than the case is for the other gas compositions."
[6] "Sn appears to have a stabilising effect on the activity of the catalyst, irrespective of the gas composition."
[7] "The main product is always CO2."
[8] "This could indicate a higher activity in the CO oxidation reaction over Pt, especially since the CO-selectivity drops when excess O2 is fed to the reactor (O2 flows above 1 ml/min)."

1. The economic challenges associated with catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) reactions, particularly the endothermic nature of the equilibrium, have driven efforts to develop more efficient and cost-effective processes. These issues include the high energy requirements for achieving high conversion rates, the complexity of product separation due to small boiling point differences, and the high cost of catalysts and processes.

2. The reaction equation (1) for catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) has a significant endothermic character, with a heat of reaction (H) of 124 kJ/mol, which limits its economic viability without substantial energy input.

3. The catalytic stability of the PtSn system is demonstrated across various gas mixtures containing propane, propane with hydrogen, propane with oxygen, and propane with both hydrogen and oxygen.

4. The presence of oxygen or water formed in the reaction aids in the continuous removal of coke or coke precursors deposited on the catalyst surface, potentially enhancing its stability.

5. The conversion of propane is notably higher when using the PtSn catalyst compared to other gas compositions, suggesting improved performance under specific conditions.

6. Sn incorporated into the catalyst displays a stabilizing effect on the catalyst's activity, regardless of the gas mixture used in the dehydrogenation process.

7. The main product generated in the catalytic combustion process is carbon dioxide (CO2).

8. The catalyst's performance in the CO oxidation reaction might be enhanced over platinum (Pt), especially when exposed to excess oxygen, as evidenced by a decrease in the CO selectivity as the oxygen flow surpasses 1 ml/min.

1. 与催化脱氢化（DH）反应相关的经济挑战，特别是其强热力学势垒，促使人们寻找更高效和成本效益更高的工艺。这些问题包括高能需求以实现高转化率，产品分离的复杂性由于沸点差异微小，以及催化剂和过程的高昂成本。

2. 某种特定的催化脱氢化反应方程（1）具有显著的热力学势垒，热效应为124 kJ/mol，这限制了在不大量输入能量的情况下实现经济可行性的可能性。

3. PtSn系统的催化稳定性在不同气体混合物中得到证明，这些混合物包含丙烷、丙烷与氢气、丙烷与氧气，以及丙烷与氢气和氧气的组合。

4. 氧气或反应中形成的水有助于持续去除沉积在催化剂表面的焦炭或焦炭前体，可能增强其稳定性。

5. 与其它气体组成相比，使用PtSn催化剂时的丙烷转化率更高，表明在特定条件下表现出更好的性能。

6. 纳入的Sn对催化剂活性具有稳定作用，无论使用的气体混合物如何。

7. 催化燃烧过程中产生的主要产物是二氧化碳（CO2）。

8. 当氧气流超过1 ml/min时，Pt催化剂在CO氧化反应中的性能可能会增强，尤其是当暴露于过量氧气时，CO选择性会下降。
