[1] "The selective production of light alkenes, especially propene, via catalytic dehydrogenation (DH), reaction (1),is an important reaction, but the process often suffers from poor economy."
[2] "The strong endothermic character of the equilibrium limited Eq. (1) (H= 124 kJ/mol)"
[3] "Catalytic stability of the PtSn is shown for the different gas mixtures (propane,propane/H2, propane/O2 and propane/H2/O2)."
[4] "The reason for this could be that oxygen (or the water formed in the reaction) continuously removes coke or coke precursors deposited on the catalyst."

1. The economic challenges associated with catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) reactions, particularly the endothermic nature of the equilibrium, have driven efforts to develop more efficient and cost-effective processes. These issues include the high energy requirements for achieving high conversion rates, the complexity of product separation due to small boiling point differences, and the high cost of catalysts and processes.

2. The reaction equation (1) for catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) has a significant endothermic character, with a heat of reaction (H) of 124 kJ/mol, which limits its economic viability without substantial energy input.

3. The catalytic stability of the PtSn system is demonstrated across various gas mixtures containing propane, propane with hydrogen, propane with oxygen, and propane with both hydrogen and oxygen.

4. The presence of oxygen or water formed in the reaction aids in the continuous removal of coke or coke precursors deposited on the catalyst surface, potentially enhancing its stability.

5. The conversion of propane is notably higher when using the PtSn catalyst compared to other gas compositions, suggesting improved performance under specific conditions.

6. Sn incorporated into the catalyst displays a stabilizing effect on the catalyst's activity, regardless of the gas mixture used in the dehydrogenation process.

7. The main product generated in the catalytic combustion process is carbon dioxide (CO2).

8. The catalyst's performance in the CO oxidation reaction might be enhanced over platinum (Pt), especially when exposed to excess oxygen, as evidenced by a decrease in the CO selectivity as the oxygen flow surpasses 1 ml/min.

<p>In conventional dehydrogenation there are two side-reactions that compete with dehydrogenation; hydrogenolysis and coke formation [12]. The addition of Sn improves the properties of the Pt catalyst, but the mechanism depends on the interaction with the support. We have previously shown that Pt in the PtSn/SiO2 system has a low support interaction, and has properties (in catalytic dehydrogenation) that can be explained by PtSn alloy formation. In the alloy, the surface properties of Pt are changed. The Pt surface is diluted, giving small ensembles of Pt, with different electronic properties than pure Pt particles. This leads to a more stable catalyst, but these effects also give a lower activity for dehydrogenation of propane, probably due to a weaker adsorption of propane [11].</p>
<p>Based on this it is possible to speculate that the PtSn/SiO2 system used here has adsorption properties favouring hydrogen adsorption in competition with hydrocarbons, and thereby promoting subsequent reaction with adsorbed oxygen.</p>

The document discusses the possibility of selectively combusting hydrogen in the presence of hydrocarbons, specifically over Pt-based catalysts. The key findings are that under specific conditions, where the amount of oxygen is limited relative to the available hydrogen, the selective combustion of hydrogen becomes feasible, even in the presence of high concentrations of propene. The PtSn catalyst is highlighted as capable of providing similar results to oxide catalysts. However, the underlying mechanisms, particularly explaining why PtSn and Sn offer higher selectivity to water compared to pure Pt, are not clearly elucidated. The addition of tin (Sn) to the Pt catalyst improves its properties, which is attributed to the formation of a PtSn alloy. This leads to changes in the surface properties of Pt, resulting in a more stable catalyst but potentially reduced activity for propane dehydrogenation due to weaker adsorption. The speculation is that the PtSn/SiO2 system favors hydrogen adsorption over hydrocarbons, thus promoting reactions with adsorbed oxygen.

本文讨论了在某些条件下，通过限制氧气相对于可用氢气的量，氢气的有选择性燃烧成为可能，特别是在丙烯等轻烃的存在下。关键发现是，在特定条件下，如果氧气的量相对氢气有限，则可以实现氢气的有选择性燃烧。PtSn催化剂被指出能够提供与氧化物催化剂类似的效果。然而，背后的机制，特别是为什么PtSn和Sn相较于纯Pt具有更高的水生成选择性尚不明确。添加锡（Sn）到Pt催化剂中改善了其性能，这归因于PtSn合金的形成。这导致了Pt表面性质的变化，形成了Pt的小集合体，具有不同于纯Pt粒子的不同电子性质。这导致了催化剂更加稳定，但可能降低了丙烷脱氢活性，因为氢吸附较弱。推测的是，PtSn/SiO2系统有利于氢吸附超过烃类，从而促进与吸附氧的反应。

<p>In the conventional dehydrogenation system, the unpromoted Pt is more active initially, but deactivates faster compared to the PtSn catalyst, as observed previously in the conventional dehydrogenation system.</p>
<p>Sn alone is not active for the dehydrogenation or combustion of hydrocarbons at these conditions. At 500 C the conversion is very low, and at 550 C the conversion of propane is less than 1% when the 1% Sn/SiO2 is used as a catalyst (data not shown).</p>
<p>Over Pt the CO-selectivity drops off with increasing O2 flow, whereas for Sn and PtSn the trend is opposite. This could indicate a higher activity in the CO oxidation reaction over Pt, especially since the CO-selectivity drops when excess O2 is fed to the reactor (O2 flows above 1 ml/min).</p>
<p>The results show that under certain reaction conditions and in an excess of hydrogen the selective combustion of hydrogen in the presence of light hydrocarbons over Pt-based catalysts is possible. Sn has a stabilising effect on the catalyst activity, PtSn being more stabile than Pt. Both Sn and PtSn seem to be able to selectively combust hydrogen in a gas mixture with propane and oxygen. Pt does not show this quality.</p>
