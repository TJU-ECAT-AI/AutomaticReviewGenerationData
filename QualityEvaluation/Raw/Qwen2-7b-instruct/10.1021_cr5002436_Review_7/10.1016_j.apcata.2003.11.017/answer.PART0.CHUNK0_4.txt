<p>In the conventional dehydrogenation system, the unpromoted Pt is more active initially, but deactivates faster compared to the PtSn catalyst, as observed previously in the conventional dehydrogenation system.</p>
<p>Sn alone is not active for the dehydrogenation or combustion of hydrocarbons at these conditions. At 500 C the conversion is very low, and at 550 C the conversion of propane is less than 1% when the 1% Sn/SiO2 is used as a catalyst (data not shown).</p>
<p>Over Pt the CO-selectivity drops off with increasing O2 flow, whereas for Sn and PtSn the trend is opposite. This could indicate a higher activity in the CO oxidation reaction over Pt, especially since the CO-selectivity drops when excess O2 is fed to the reactor (O2 flows above 1 ml/min).</p>
<p>The results show that under certain reaction conditions and in an excess of hydrogen the selective combustion of hydrogen in the presence of light hydrocarbons over Pt-based catalysts is possible. Sn has a stabilising effect on the catalyst activity, PtSn being more stabile than Pt. Both Sn and PtSn seem to be able to selectively combust hydrogen in a gas mixture with propane and oxygen. Pt does not show this quality.</p>

1. The unpromoted Pt catalyst is more active initially in conventional dehydrogenation but deactivates faster compared to the PtSn catalyst. 
2. Sn catalyst alone is not active for dehydrogenation or combustion of hydrocarbons at specified conditions, showing low conversion even at 500°C.
3. The CO-selectivity over Pt decreases with increased oxygen flow, suggesting higher CO oxidation activity over Pt. 
4. Under specific conditions, selective hydrogen combustion is possible with Pt-based catalysts, exhibiting stability and selectivity improvements with Sn addition.

1. 在传统的脱氢系统中，未促进的Pt催化剂在最初时更为活跃，但比PtSn催化剂更快失去活性。
2. 在指定条件下，Sn催化剂自身不适用于烃类的脱氢或燃烧，即使在500°C下其转化率也很低。
3. 随着氧气流速的增加，Pt催化剂的CO选择性下降，这表明Pt对CO氧化具有更高的活性。
4. 在特定条件下，Pt基催化剂表现出可能的、通过添加Sn来提高稳定性和选择性的选择性氢燃烧能力。
