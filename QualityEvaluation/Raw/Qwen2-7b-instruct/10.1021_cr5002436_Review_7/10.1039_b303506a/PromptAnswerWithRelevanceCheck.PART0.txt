The development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production have been significantly influenced by recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production. The abundance and cost-effectiveness of natural gas have driven a shift towards more efficient and sustainable production methods. Key technological advancements include the use of platinum-based catalysts, such as Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5, which offer high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and unprecedented stability in the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes. This catalyst system surpasses previous state-of-the-art catalysts in terms of reaction rates and stability, making it highly suitable for olefin production. However, current limitations include the potential for side reactions and the need for mild oxidative treatments to regenerate the catalyst without compromising its performance. Areas for improvement involve further optimization of catalyst design to enhance stability, reduce energy consumption, and minimize environmental impact. As the demand for olefins continues to grow, ongoing research aims to develop catalysts that can efficiently convert natural gas to olefins while maintaining high selectivity and stability over extended periods.

The literature discusses the development and use of platinum-based materials in petrochemical and refining processes, specifically focusing on their application in dehydrogenation reactions. Platinum clusters in a Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst system are highlighted for their ability to provide high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and unprecedented stability in the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The study notes that the replacement of aluminum ions (Al3+) with iron ions (Fe3+) in the ZSM-5 framework helps retain exchange sites necessary for anchoring platinum precursors, resulting in well-dispersed platinum clusters that can be accommodated within the protected environment of 10-ring zeolite channels. The weaker acidity of the FeOHSi structure compared to AlOHSi contributes to higher alkene selectivity and catalytic stability. The authors conclude that these catalysts offer improvements over existing materials, including enhanced stability and selectivity, without the need for bimetallic clusters or significant hydrogen pressures in alkane reactant streams. The materials can be fully regenerated through mild oxidative treatments, preserving platinum dispersion, zeolite crystallinity, and catalytic selectivities while reducing the occurrence of undesired side reactions.

文献讨论了铂基材料在石油化工和精炼过程中的应用，特别是它们在轻烷烃脱氢反应中的应用。文中重点介绍了在Na-[Fe]ZSM5催化剂系统中铂簇的存在，这些铂簇能够提供高烯烃选择性、接近平衡的烯烃产率以及在轻烷烃脱氢催化反应中前所未有的稳定性。研究指出，将铝离子（Al3+）替换为铁离子（Fe3+）在ZSM-5框架中有助于保留用于锚定铂前体的交换位点，结果产生了分散良好的铂簇，这些簇可以被容纳在ZSM5的保护环境中，即10环沸石通道内。FeOHSi结构的较弱酸性与AlOHSi相比导致更高的烯烃选择性和催化稳定性。作者总结指出，这些催化剂相对于现有材料提供了改进，包括增强的稳定性和选择性，无需使用双金属簇或烷烃反应物流中的显著氢压力。这些材料可以通过温和的氧化处理完全再生，同时保持铂的分散度、沸石晶体结构和催化选择性，减少不希望发生的副反应的发生。

The literature discusses the development of a novel catalyst, specifically Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5, which exhibits high alkene selectivity, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and unprecedented stability in the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The catalyst's performance surpasses other platinum-based materials commonly used in petrochemical and refining processes. The study highlights the importance of catalyst stability, selectivity, and deactivation rate in the context of dehydrogenation reactions. The catalyst's stability is notably superior to that of PtSn clusters on various supports, with deactivation rate constants being more than ten times smaller. The literature also suggests that non-acidic supports and PtSn clusters offer higher stability and selectivity compared to Pt clusters on conventional supports like g-Al2O3 or SiO2. Furthermore, the novel catalyst can be fully regenerated using mild-oxidative treatments without compromising its dispersion, crystallinity, or catalytic selectivities, making it potentially more sustainable and industrially viable.
