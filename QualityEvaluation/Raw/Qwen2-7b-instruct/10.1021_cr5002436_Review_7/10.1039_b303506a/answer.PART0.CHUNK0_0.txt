The development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production have been significantly influenced by recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production. The abundance and cost-effectiveness of natural gas have driven a shift towards more efficient and sustainable production methods. Key technological advancements include the use of platinum-based catalysts, such as Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5, which offer high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and unprecedented stability in the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes. This catalyst system surpasses previous state-of-the-art catalysts in terms of reaction rates and stability, making it highly suitable for olefin production. However, current limitations include the potential for side reactions and the need for mild oxidative treatments to regenerate the catalyst without compromising its performance. Areas for improvement involve further optimization of catalyst design to enhance stability, reduce energy consumption, and minimize environmental impact. As the demand for olefins continues to grow, ongoing research aims to develop catalysts that can efficiently convert natural gas to olefins while maintaining high selectivity and stability over extended periods.
