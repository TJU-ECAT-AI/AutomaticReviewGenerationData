The literature discusses the development of a novel catalyst, specifically Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5, which exhibits high alkene selectivity, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and unprecedented stability in the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The catalyst's performance surpasses other platinum-based materials commonly used in petrochemical and refining processes. The study highlights the importance of catalyst stability, selectivity, and deactivation rate in the context of dehydrogenation reactions. The catalyst's stability is notably superior to that of PtSn clusters on various supports, with deactivation rate constants being more than ten times smaller. The literature also suggests that non-acidic supports and PtSn clusters offer higher stability and selectivity compared to Pt clusters on conventional supports like g-Al2O3 or SiO2. Furthermore, the novel catalyst can be fully regenerated using mild-oxidative treatments without compromising its dispersion, crystallinity, or catalytic selectivities, making it potentially more sustainable and industrially viable.

文献讨论了一种新型催化剂，即Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5，在轻烷烃脱氢反应中表现出前所未有的活性、选择性和稳定性。该催化剂在石油化工和精炼过程中被广泛使用。研究强调了脱氢反应中催化剂稳定性、选择性和失活速率的重要性。与各种支撑材料上的PtSn簇相比，该催化剂的稳定性显著更高，失活速率常数比PtSn低十倍以上。文献还表明，非酸性支撑材料和PtSn簇比传统支撑材料如g-Al2O3或SiO2上的Pt簇提供更高的稳定性和选择性。此外，这种新型催化剂可以通过温和氧化处理完全再生，而不损害其分散度、晶体结构或催化选择性，这可能使其在可持续性和工业化方面更具可行性。
