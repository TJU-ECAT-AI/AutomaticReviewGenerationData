Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<quotes>
[1] "A composite membrane consisting of palladium thin film and a microporous-glass tube was applied to a membrane reactor."
[2] "In the water gas shift reaction, the membrane reactor gave the conversion level exceeding the equilibrium one for the closed system as a result of the separation of hydrogen produced."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The application of a composite membrane made of palladium thin film and a microporous-glass tube in a membrane reactor was used for the water gas shift reaction. This resulted in a higher conversion rate than the equilibrium level in a closed system due to the effective separation of hydrogen produced.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
将由钯薄膜和微孔玻璃管组成的复合膜应用于膜反应器，用于水煤气变换反应。这导致在封闭系统中的转化率超过平衡水平，原因是有效分离了产生的氢气。
