[1] "A composite membrane consisting of palladium thin film and a microporous-glass tube was applied to a membrane reactor."
[2] "In the water gas shift reaction, the membrane reactor gave the conversion level exceeding the equilibrium one for the closed system as a result of the separation of hydrogen produced."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The application of a composite membrane made of palladium thin film and a microporous-glass tube in a membrane reactor was used for the water gas shift reaction. This resulted in a higher conversion rate than the equilibrium level in a closed system due to the effective separation of hydrogen produced.
