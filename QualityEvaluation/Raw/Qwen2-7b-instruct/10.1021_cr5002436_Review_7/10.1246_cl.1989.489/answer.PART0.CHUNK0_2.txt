[1] "A composite membrane consisting of palladium thin film and a microporous-glass tube was applied to a membrane reactor."
[2] "In the water gas shift reaction, the membrane reactor gave the conversion level exceeding the equilibrium one for the closed system as a result of the separation of hydrogen produced."
