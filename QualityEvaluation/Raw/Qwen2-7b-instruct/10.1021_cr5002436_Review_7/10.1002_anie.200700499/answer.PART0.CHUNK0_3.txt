[1] "For this reason, as a first example we have chosen a methodology to perform real-time quantitative coke analysis on a catalytic solid by using combined in situ RamanUV/Vis spectroscopy with online calibration."
[2] "The novelty of the present work is linked to the use of in situ spectroscopy for the online control of different heterogeneous catalytic systems."
[3] "Currently, for the industrial Catofin process, the real state of the catalyst material is not taken into consideration and the cycle times are based on the overall performance of the unit."
[4] "The developed methodology, the catalytic solid is automatically regenerated when the amount of coke exceeds a predefined level (determined from the intensity of the Raman peak at 1580cm1, see insert in Figure1)."
[5] "This lower temperature reached during regeneration by controlled burn-off (Figure2) proves the benefits of this regeneration procedure; the possibility of reducing the formation of hot spots in an industrial reactor, and thus suppressing the irreversible deactivation of the catalyst (that is, migration of Cr3+ into the Al2O3 support), could offer a simple way to extend the catalyst lifetime."
[6] "In the second example, we explored the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride over an industrial-like VPO catalyst."
[7] "The experiment was carried out by alternating the reaction, oxidizing, and reducing conditions for five React-Ox-React-Red cycles, as shown schematically at the bottom of Figure3, where the presence/absence of butane and/or oxygen is reported."
[8] "The increased/decreased intensity of the 989cm1 Raman peak was clearly reversible and, after each Ox or Red step, the maleic anhydride concentration could be rapidly reestablished when the catalyst was reexposed to React conditions."
[9] "The benefit of this online control of phase composition can be applied to prolong the life of the VPO catalyst, thus avoiding in time any dramatic phase changes that could not only decrease the catalyst performance, but also result in permanent catalyst deactivation, as explained above for the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst system."

The development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production have been significantly influenced by recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production. This has led to an increased demand for olefins, driving the need for more efficient and sustainable dehydrogenation processes. Key technological advancements include the use of in situ spectroscopy for real-time monitoring and control of catalyst states. This method allows for the automatic adjustment of reaction conditions based on the current state of the catalyst, which enhances efficiency and sustainability. Current limitations include the need for robust and accurate online calibration methods and the development of more stable catalyst materials. Areas for improvement involve refining the control algorithms to better predict and respond to changes in catalyst state, optimizing cycle times, and extending catalyst lifetimes through effective management of catalyst degradation mechanisms such as coke formation and phase transformations. The integration of advanced spectroscopic techniques offers a promising avenue for addressing these challenges and enhancing the industrial viability of dehydrogenation processes.
