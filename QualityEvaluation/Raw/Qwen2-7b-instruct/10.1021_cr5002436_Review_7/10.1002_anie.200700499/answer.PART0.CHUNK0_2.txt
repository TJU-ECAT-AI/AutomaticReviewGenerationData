[1] "Large-scale reactors loaded with catalytic solids are employed in a wide variety of chemical plants all over the world for the production of transportation fuels, bulk and fine chemicals, and pharmaceutical intermediates."
[2] "These reactors are commonly controlled by monitoring the chemicals that are leaving the catalytic process."
[3] "Often such corrective scenarios are based on empirical models, which are obtained from plant test runs."
[4] "A better approach is to monitor online the physicochemical phenomena of the catalyst material in the reactor by in situ spectroscopy,25 and if possible to develop an expert system based on such spectroscopic measurements."
[5] "This procedure is faster than monitoring the off-specification product leaving the reactor."
[6] "Indeed, monitoring the catalyst allows the possibility of dynamically tuning the cycles while the process runs."
[7] "In this manner, one can keep the catalyst material in its optimal state in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability."
[8] "The novelty of the present work is linked to the use of in situ spectroscopy for the online control of different heterogeneous catalytic systems."
[9] "The studied process is based on the Catofin propane dehydrogenation reaction over Cr/Al2O3 catalyst."
[10] "Currently, for the industrial Catofin process, the real state of the catalyst material is not taken into consideration and the cycle times are based on the overall performance of the unit."
[11] "The cycles performed at the highest temperatures (590 and 600C) presented some coke-level overshoots, which are related to the delay between the flushing and regeneration steps."
[12] "The developed methodology, the catalytic solid is automatically regenerated when the amount of coke exceeds a predefined level."
[13] "Further details on the developed methodology can be found in the Supporting Information."
[14] "Ten reaction-regeneration cycles are reported for temperatures in the range of 550600C."
[15] "The regeneration procedure was alternated between controlled burn-off and a standard regeneration procedure in air, which is currently employed in industrial propane dehydrogenation plants."
[16] "In each case, at the beginning of the regeneration step we noticed a sharp increase in the temperature of the catalyst bed."
[17] "The increased/decreased intensity of the 989cm1 Raman peak was clearly reversible and, after each Ox or Red step, the maleic anhydride concentration could be rapidly reestablished when the catalyst was reexposed to React conditions."
[18] "The first propane dehydrogenation cycle was carried out at 550C until the coke level exceeded a predefined limit (250 in these experiments)."
[19] "After ten days of activation (400C, 30mLmin1, He/O2/C4H10=77:21:2) the transformation towards (VO)2P2O7 was complete, and the Iox/Ired ratio and maleic anhydride concentration in the reaction steps showed a constant trend."
[20] "On the basis of both examples it is clear that in situ spectroscopy of a catalytic solid can be used to control online the amount of a specific catalyst material as well as that of coke deposits during a reaction process."

Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have significantly influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. These advancements aim to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of these processes. Key technological advancements include the utilization of in situ spectroscopy for real-time monitoring and control of catalyst materials, which allows for dynamic tuning of processes and ensures the optimal state of catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability. Current limitations involve the need for more sophisticated empirical models and the development of advanced expert systems based on spectroscopic measurements. Areas for improvement include refining methodologies for coke analysis and control, optimizing cycle times, and enhancing the reversibility of phase transformations in catalysts. The integration of in situ spectroscopy offers faster and more precise control mechanisms compared to traditional methods, enabling industries to maintain high performance and reduce waste.
