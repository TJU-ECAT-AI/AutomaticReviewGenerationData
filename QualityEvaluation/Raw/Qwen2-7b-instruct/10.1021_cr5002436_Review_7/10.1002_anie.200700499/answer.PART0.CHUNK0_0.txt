[1] "In many industrial catalytic processes, coke deposition is the primary cause of catalyst deactivation."
[2] "An example of the controlled coke burn-off procedure is illustrated in Figure1, in which coke and propane conversion levels are plotted versus time on stream, and the upper coke level set-point is also indicated."
[3] "The developed methodology, the catalytic solid is automatically regenerated when the amount of coke exceeds a predefined level (determined from the intensity of the Raman peak at 1580cm1, see insert in Figure1)."
[4] "The regeneration procedure was alternated between controlled burn-off (as in Figure1) and a standard regeneration procedure in air, which is currently employed in industrial propane dehydrogenation plants."
[5] "Examples of the characteristic Raman spectra acquired in the different steps are reported in Figure3C."
[6] "On the basis of both examples it is clear that in situ spectroscopy of a catalytic solid can be used to control online the amount of a specific catalyst material as well as that of coke deposits during a reaction process."

The document illustrates the development and application of real-time control systems for catalytic solids in fixed-bed reactors using in situ spectroscopy. The methodologies allow for monitoring and adjusting the state of the catalyst to prevent deactivation caused by coke deposition and other phenomena. Key technological advancements include the use of Raman and UV/Vis spectroscopy for online analysis, enabling dynamic adjustments to reaction conditions. Current limitations involve the need for further optimization and integration of expert systems for more efficient control. Areas for improvement include enhancing the accuracy and speed of spectroscopic measurements, expanding the range of catalyst materials for which these methods are applicable, and improving the robustness of the control algorithms to handle various disturbances and feedstock variations in industrial settings.
