The use of in situ spectroscopy for online control of different heterogeneous catalytic systems represents a significant advancement. Coke deposition, a major cause of catalyst deactivation in industrial processes, is often overlooked. The methodology developed for real-time coke analysis involves monitoring the intensity of the Raman peak at 1580cm1 to determine the coke level. This approach leads to a more efficient regeneration process, resulting in a smaller temperature increase compared to conventional methods. The behavior of the VPO catalyst during reactions, oxidizing, and reducing conditions can be closely monitored using in situ Raman spectroscopy, allowing for the real-time control of phase compositions and improving catalyst performance. This technology offers a way to prolong catalyst life by preventing phase changes that could reduce performance or lead to permanent deactivation.
