[1] "In many industrial catalytic processes, coke deposition is the primary cause of catalyst deactivation.6,14 Therefore, any means of directly measuring the amount of coke on the catalyst surface would be welcomed, especially for the purpose of online control of a chemical process."
[2] "For this reason, as a first example we have chosen a methodology to perform real-time quantitative coke analysis on a catalytic solid by using combined in situ RamanUV/Vis spectroscopy with online calibration."
[3] "In the developed methodology, the catalytic solid is automatically regenerated when the amount of coke exceeds a predefined level (determined from the intensity of the Raman peak at 1580cm1, see insert in Figure1).15,16"
[4] "This procedure is faster than monitoring the off-specification product leaving the reactor. In particular, for catalytic processes in which the catalyst is operated with alternating reactive and regenerative cycles, the use of in situ spectroscopy will have specific advantages."
[5] "Based on both examples it is clear that in situ spectroscopy of a catalytic solid can be used to control online the amount of a specific catalyst material as well as that of coke deposits during a reaction process. Based on this input the catalyst performance and its long-term stability can be automatically controlled."

The recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have significantly influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. These advancements aim to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of processes through several key technological developments. One major focus is the real-time monitoring and control of catalyst performance, particularly in addressing issues like coke deposition, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. The use of in situ spectroscopy, specifically RamanUV/Vis spectroscopy, enables continuous analysis of the catalyst's state, allowing for dynamic adjustments to the process parameters. This technology facilitates the automatic control of catalyst performance and stability, improving the overall efficiency of the catalytic reactions. The integration of online calibration methods further optimizes the accuracy of these analyses, providing a faster alternative to traditional off-line monitoring techniques. By continuously adapting the process based on real-time data, the industry can mitigate catalyst deactivation risks and optimize operational conditions, leading to enhanced efficiency and sustainability in olefin production processes.
