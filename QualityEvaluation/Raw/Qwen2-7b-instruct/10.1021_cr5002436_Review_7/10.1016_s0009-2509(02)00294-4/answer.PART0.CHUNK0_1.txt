The development of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production has been significantly influenced by the surge in shale gas production. Economic factors have led to a greater emphasis on efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability. Key technological advancements include the use of micro-structured reactors with catalytic filaments. These reactors offer high surface-to-volume ratios, low pressure drops, and narrow residence time distributions, which control reaction times and improve selectivity. However, the introduction of catalytic active phases remains challenging due to issues like high pressure drops and maldistribution. Addressing these limitations and exploring new methods for depositing active layers onto materials are crucial areas for improvement.
