<p>Micro-structured reactors are characterized by three-dimensional structures in the sub-millimeter range.</p>
<p>Mainly multichannel reactors are currently used with channel diameters between ten and several hundred micrometers.</p>
<p>One of the main features of micro-structured reactors is their high surface to volume ratio, being 12 orders of magnitudes higher as compared to traditional chemical reactors.</p>
<p>Due to the small reactor dimensions, diffusion times are short and the influence of mass transfer on the rate of reaction is substantially reduced.</p>
<p>The narrow residence time distribution in microchannel reactors allows to optimize the contact time and to suppress formation of by-products in complex reactions.</p>
<p>The drawbacks of using micro-structured reactors for heterogeneously catalized reactions include the introduction of a catalytic active phase and the high pressure drop.</p>
<p>Research is focused on the development of thin catalytic layers deposited on the reactor walls within the micro-structure.</p>
<p>In the present paper, a novel concept of a micro-reactor system is proposed and tested in the catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.</p>
<p>Production of propene via non-oxidative catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has technological constraints due to the high endothermicity and the unfavourable thermodynamic equilibrium conversion under the same conditions.</p>
<p>To regenerate the catalyst, the formed coke has to be burned off periodically in oxidative atmosphere.</p>
<p>The micro-structured membrane reactor with filamentous catalyst was used in the continuous production of propene from propane via non-oxidative dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>A Pd/Ag membrane, permeable to hydrogen, separates two concentric zones of the tubular reactor.</p>
<p>On one side of the membrane, the dehydrogenation takes place with simultaneous coke formation on the catalyst surface and diffusion of hydrogen to zone II.</p>
<p>On the other side of the membrane, hydrogen is oxidized by air, thus generating heat for the endothermic dehydrogenation in zone I.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with the hydrogen oxidation, the deactivated catalyst is regenerated by burning off coke from the catalyst surface.</p>
<p>The feeds of air and propane are switched periodically between the two zones to produce propene continuously.</p>
<p>Aluminoborosilicate glass fibers in woven form were used as starting material for the catalyst preparation.</p>
<p>By treating the fabrics with 1:0 N aqueous solutions of HCl, the specific surface area is increased up to 290 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<p>The specific surface area was determined by the BET method.</p>
<p>The active metals (Pt and Sn) were deposited via two-step impregnation from aqueous ammonia solutions (pH = 10).</p>
<p>The concentrations of the solutions were adjusted to obtain a catalyst formulation of 0.5%Pt1%Sn on ASF.</p>
<p>The catalytic filaments were introduced into the tubular reactor in the form of threads.</p>
<p>The micro-structured membrane reactor with filamentous catalyst was used in the continuous production of propene from propane via non-oxidative dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The pressure drop measured under laminar flow for the structured reactor can be used to estimate the equivalent diameter of the channels based on the well-known relationship of Hagen-Poiseuille.</p>
<p>The estimated hydraulic diameter of 70 μm is in the same order of magnitude as for conventional multichannel micro-reactors.</p>
<p>Propane conversion was found to be similar on powdered and on filamentous catalyst.</p>
<p>Deactivation due to coke formation is slow in both cases.</p>
<p>But the selectivity towards propene is higher over the filamentous catalyst.</p>
<p>The pressure drop through the filamentous packing was found to be IP = 7 hPa, which is roughly 5 times lower compared to fixed bed packed with spheres of 100-160 μm diameter with the same volume and 3.5 times lower if compared with reactors with the same mass of catalyst.</p>
<p>The residence time distribution is characterized by the mean residence time, T<sub>t</sub>, and the variance around the mean value, σ<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>For the three packings shown in Fig. 5, the numerical results are shown in Table 1.</p>
<p>Compared to industrial processes with selectivities in the range of 80-90%, the observed propene selectivity of 95-97% is relatively high.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the selectivity is not affected by the catalyst deactivation being independent on time-on-stream and the different reactor zones.</p>
<p>A novel micro-structured catalytic bed was reported, which is made of long threads consisting of fine filaments of 7 μm in diameter.</p>

Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. The abundance and low cost of natural gas have driven the interest in technologies that can efficiently convert natural gas to higher-value products, such as propylene. The key technological advancements include the development of micro-structured reactors, which offer a high surface-to-volume ratio and optimized mass transfer properties, leading to shorter residence times and reduced pressure drop. These features are crucial for enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of dehydrogenation processes. However, current limitations include the introduction of catalysts into such microstructures, which requires precise control and uniformity to maintain optimal performance. Additionally, the regeneration of catalysts, particularly through the removal of coke, presents a challenge that needs to be addressed to ensure the long-term viability of these processes. Future areas for improvement focus on developing more efficient catalysts, optimizing reactor designs, and improving the integration of catalyst regeneration systems within the overall process flow.
