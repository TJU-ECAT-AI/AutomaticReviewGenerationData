<p>Micro-structured reactors are characterized by three-dimensional structures in the sub-millimeter range. Mainly multichannel reactors are currently used with channel diameters between ten and several hundred micrometers. One of the main features of micro-structured reactors is their high surface to volume ratio, being 12 orders of magnitudes higher as compared to traditional chemical reactors.</p>
<p>Due to the small reactor dimensions, diffusion times are short and the influence of mass transfer on the rate of reaction is substantially reduced. As heat transfer is greatly improved if compared to conventional systems, higher reaction temperatures are admissible allowing reduced reaction volumes and amount of catalysts.</p>
<p>Therefore, micro-structured reactors are particularly suitable for fast endo- and exothermic reactions and for the design of autothermal systems. Furthermore, the narrow residence time distribution in microchannel reactors allows to optimize the contact time and to suppress formation of by-products in complex reaction.</p>
<p>The micro-structured system reported consists of a two-zone tubular reactor of few millimeters in diameter filled with catalytically active filaments placed parallel to the tube walls. The filaments are introduced in the form of threads. The two zones are separated by a Pd-membrane allowing to eliminate hydrogen from the reaction mixture, thus exceeding equilibrium conversion.</p>
<p>Parallel filaments of few micro-meters in diameter (310 μm) form micro-channels with flow hydrodynamics similar to multi-channel micro-reactors. The equivalent diameter (deq) of the channels for gas flow between the filaments depends on the diameter of the filaments (df) and their geometric arrangement.</p>
<p>The micro-structured membrane reactor with filamentous catalyst was used in the continuous production of propene from propane via non-oxidative dehydrogenation. A Pd/Ag membrane, permeable to hydrogen, separates two concentric zones of the tubular reactor.</p>
<p>Aluminoborosilicate glass fibers in woven form were used as starting material for the catalyst preparation. The fibers were treated at 90°C in 1:0 N aqueous solutions of HCl to leach out the non-silica components of the glass, then the material was rinsed in distilled water and dried in air at 50°C overnight.</p>
<p>The catalytic filaments were introduced into the tubular reactor in the form of threads. Each thread with a diameter of about 0.5 mm consists of a bundle of 100 filaments, with a diameter of 7 μm. The catalytic threads were placed in parallel into the tube to form a cylindrical catalytic bed of different lengths in the range of 10-200 mm.</p>
<p>The reaction was carried out at a temperature of T = 823 K and a pressure of 0.14 MPa. Before reaction, the catalyst was heated under nitrogen flow at 10 K/min up to the reaction temperature. After 15 min of temperature stabilization, nitrogen was replaced by a flow of pure propane and the reaction products were monitored.</p>
<p>Hydrodynamics of gas flow through the micro-structured filamentous catalytic bed was studied and compared to different conventional packings. Experimental results are presented in Figure 5.</p>
<p>Applied to non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, it allowed a better control of reaction time due to the narrower residence time distribution leading to increased propene selectivity from 88% to 95%.</p>
<p>In a reactor with a hydrogen permeable membrane, the propene selectivity was increased up to 97% due to the removal of H2 suppressing hydroisomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions. As the hydrogen is oxidized in a second compartment integrated in the system, autothermal reactor behavior can be realized.</p>

1. Microstructured reactors offer several advantages over traditional chemical reactors due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, shorter diffusion times, improved heat transfer capabilities, and ability to optimize contact time while suppressing the formation of by-products. They are particularly suited for fast endo- and exothermic reactions and for designing autothermal systems.

2. The microstructured system described uses a two-zone tubular reactor filled with parallel filaments placed along the tube walls. The filaments are introduced as threads, forming micro-channels between them. A Pd-membrane separates the two zones, allowing hydrogen elimination and achieving equilibrium conversion.

3. The filaments are typically around 3-10 μm in diameter, and their geometric arrangement affects the equivalent channel diameter. The reactor has a hydraulic diameter in the micron range, ensuring laminar flow and efficient suppression of axial dispersion.

4. The microstructured membrane reactor was utilized for continuous propene production from propane via non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The Pd/Ag membrane permeable to hydrogen enables hydrogen oxidation in a separate zone, facilitating autothermal reactor behavior.

5. Glass fibers were treated to prepare catalysts, enhancing the specific surface area. Active metals such as Pt and Sn were deposited on the catalyst support via impregnation, achieving selectivity towards propene and acceptable long-term stability.

6. The filamentous packed bed had a porosity of 0.8, with a specific surface area per volume about 50 times higher than washcoated tubes of the same inner diameter. The reactor setup included a quartz tube and a Pd/Ag membrane, facilitating hydrogen oxidation and regeneration of the catalyst.

7. The residence time distribution (RTD) was determined by measuring the response on a step function via a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The RTD was significantly narrower in the filamentous packed bed compared to randomly packed beds, indicating improved control over reaction time.

8. The reactor was operated at 823 K and 0.14 MPa, with propane conversion exceeding equilibrium conversion. The propene selectivity was increased to 97% due to the removal of hydrogen, suppressing hydroisomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions.

9. The microstructured packings provide opportunities for designing more efficient heterogeneous catalytic reactors, offering better control over reaction kinetics, improved selectivity, and enhanced sustainability compared to traditional reactor designs.
