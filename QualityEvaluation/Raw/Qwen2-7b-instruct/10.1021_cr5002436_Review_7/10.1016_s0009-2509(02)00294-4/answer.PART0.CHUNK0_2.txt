<p>One of the main problems in using micro-structured reactors for heterogeneously catalyzed reactions is the introduction of a catalytic active phase. The easiest way would be to fill micro-channels by catalyst powder, as proposed by Tonkovich and collaborators for hydrogen generation.</p>
<p>The drawback of this method is the high pressure drop. In addition, each channel must be packed identically to avoid maldistribution.</p>
<p>Therefore, research is focused on the development of thin catalytic layers deposited on the reactors walls within the micro-structure.</p>

Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production by providing abundant feedstock. Key technological advancements include the development of microstructured reactors that utilize catalyst threads instead of powders to reduce pressure drop and ensure uniform distribution. These advancements aim to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation processes. Current limitations involve the need for further optimization of catalyst performance, particularly in terms of stability and selectivity, and addressing challenges related to scale-up and economics. Areas for improvement include refining catalyst deposition techniques to achieve more consistent and efficient layer formation, as well as exploring alternative catalyst supports and materials that can withstand higher temperatures and improve reaction kinetics.
