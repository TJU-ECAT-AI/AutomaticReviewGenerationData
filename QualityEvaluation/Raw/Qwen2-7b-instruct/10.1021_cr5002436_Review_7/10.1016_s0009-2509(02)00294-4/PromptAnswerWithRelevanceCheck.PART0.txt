<p>Micro-structured reactors are characterized by three-dimensional structures in the sub-millimeter range.</p>
<p>Mainly multichannel reactors are currently used with channel diameters between ten and several hundred micrometers.</p>
<p>One of the main features of micro-structured reactors is their high surface to volume ratio, being 12 orders of magnitudes higher as compared to traditional chemical reactors.</p>
<p>Due to the small reactor dimensions, diffusion times are short and the influence of mass transfer on the rate of reaction is substantially reduced.</p>
<p>The narrow residence time distribution in microchannel reactors allows to optimize the contact time and to suppress formation of by-products in complex reactions.</p>
<p>The drawbacks of using micro-structured reactors for heterogeneously catalized reactions include the introduction of a catalytic active phase and the high pressure drop.</p>
<p>Research is focused on the development of thin catalytic layers deposited on the reactor walls within the micro-structure.</p>
<p>In the present paper, a novel concept of a micro-reactor system is proposed and tested in the catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.</p>
<p>Production of propene via non-oxidative catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has technological constraints due to the high endothermicity and the unfavourable thermodynamic equilibrium conversion under the same conditions.</p>
<p>To regenerate the catalyst, the formed coke has to be burned off periodically in oxidative atmosphere.</p>
<p>The micro-structured membrane reactor with filamentous catalyst was used in the continuous production of propene from propane via non-oxidative dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>A Pd/Ag membrane, permeable to hydrogen, separates two concentric zones of the tubular reactor.</p>
<p>On one side of the membrane, the dehydrogenation takes place with simultaneous coke formation on the catalyst surface and diffusion of hydrogen to zone II.</p>
<p>On the other side of the membrane, hydrogen is oxidized by air, thus generating heat for the endothermic dehydrogenation in zone I.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with the hydrogen oxidation, the deactivated catalyst is regenerated by burning off coke from the catalyst surface.</p>
<p>The feeds of air and propane are switched periodically between the two zones to produce propene continuously.</p>
<p>Aluminoborosilicate glass fibers in woven form were used as starting material for the catalyst preparation.</p>
<p>By treating the fabrics with 1:0 N aqueous solutions of HCl, the specific surface area is increased up to 290 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<p>The specific surface area was determined by the BET method.</p>
<p>The active metals (Pt and Sn) were deposited via two-step impregnation from aqueous ammonia solutions (pH = 10).</p>
<p>The concentrations of the solutions were adjusted to obtain a catalyst formulation of 0.5%Pt1%Sn on ASF.</p>
<p>The catalytic filaments were introduced into the tubular reactor in the form of threads.</p>
<p>The micro-structured membrane reactor with filamentous catalyst was used in the continuous production of propene from propane via non-oxidative dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The pressure drop measured under laminar flow for the structured reactor can be used to estimate the equivalent diameter of the channels based on the well-known relationship of Hagen-Poiseuille.</p>
<p>The estimated hydraulic diameter of 70 μm is in the same order of magnitude as for conventional multichannel micro-reactors.</p>
<p>Propane conversion was found to be similar on powdered and on filamentous catalyst.</p>
<p>Deactivation due to coke formation is slow in both cases.</p>
<p>But the selectivity towards propene is higher over the filamentous catalyst.</p>
<p>The pressure drop through the filamentous packing was found to be IP = 7 hPa, which is roughly 5 times lower compared to fixed bed packed with spheres of 100-160 μm diameter with the same volume and 3.5 times lower if compared with reactors with the same mass of catalyst.</p>
<p>The residence time distribution is characterized by the mean residence time, T<sub>t</sub>, and the variance around the mean value, σ<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>For the three packings shown in Fig. 5, the numerical results are shown in Table 1.</p>
<p>Compared to industrial processes with selectivities in the range of 80-90%, the observed propene selectivity of 95-97% is relatively high.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the selectivity is not affected by the catalyst deactivation being independent on time-on-stream and the different reactor zones.</p>
<p>A novel micro-structured catalytic bed was reported, which is made of long threads consisting of fine filaments of 7 μm in diameter.</p>

Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have significantly influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. The abundance and cost-effectiveness of natural gas as a feedstock have driven the expansion of petrochemical industries, including olefin production. This has led to a greater focus on dehydrogenation technologies that can efficiently convert lower-value hydrocarbons into higher-value olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, which are essential feedstocks for downstream polymer manufacturing.

Key technological advancements include the development of micro-structured reactors with improved mass and heat transfer properties, which allow for more efficient dehydrogenation processes. These reactors feature short diffusion times and narrow residence time distributions, enabling higher reaction temperatures and reduced catalyst usage while maintaining or improving product selectivity. The introduction of hydrogen permeable membranes in these systems further enhances selectivity by controlling hydrogen concentration gradients, suppressing unwanted reactions such as hydrogenolysis and hydroisomerization.

However, the current limitations of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production include challenges related to catalyst deactivation, particularly due to coke formation, which requires periodic regeneration in oxidative atmospheres. This process can be energy-intensive and may affect the long-term stability of the catalyst. Additionally, the design and optimization of these processes require careful consideration of reactor geometry, catalyst loading, and operating conditions to balance efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability.

Areas for improvement include developing more durable catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation, exploring alternative feedstocks and reaction conditions that reduce the environmental impact of these processes, and enhancing process integration to achieve autothermal behavior, where the heat generated during the dehydrogenation process is used to maintain the reaction temperature, thereby reducing the need for external heating sources.

To enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation processes, future developments should focus on:

1. **Catalyst Development**: Improving catalyst stability and selectivity, especially in the presence of challenging feedstocks and reaction conditions.
2. **Process Integration**: Optimizing reactor designs and process flowsheets to achieve higher energy efficiency and reduced emissions.
3. **Automation and Control Systems**: Implementing advanced control strategies and machine learning algorithms to dynamically adjust operating conditions and predict catalyst performance.
4. **Environmental Impact Mitigation**: Reducing the environmental footprint of dehydrogenation processes through the use of renewable energy sources, waste heat recovery, and efficient solvent recycling.
5. **Economic Viability**: Addressing the economic challenges associated with catalyst regeneration and maintenance, aiming for lower lifecycle costs and improved return on investment.
6. **Safety and Regulatory Compliance**: Ensuring compliance with safety standards and regulations while maintaining high operational reliability and minimizing risks to human health and the environment.

These advancements are crucial for driving the continued growth and competitiveness of the petrochemical industry, enabling the sustainable production of olefins and supporting the development of new, innovative materials that drive global economic and technological progress.
