[1] "The conversion achieved in the counter-current flow operation method is the highest amongst all modes with a maximum of 85% at 500C."
[2] "The obtained membrane-reactor conversions are compared with the simple PFR conversions and not with the equilibrium conversions, since equilibrium has not been reached in the PFR (Fig. 5)."
[3] "The discrepancy may be due to experimental factors, but may also result from the assumption of constant transport selectivities, that was incorporated into the model."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The maximum conversion achieved in the counter-current flow operation method reaches up to 85% at 500°C.
2. The membrane-reactor conversions are compared with the PFR conversions, not the equilibrium conversions, due to the unachieved equilibrium in the PFR.
3. The differences between the experimental results and the model predictions might stem from experimental variables or the assumption of constant transport selectivities in the model.

1. 在逆流操作方法下，最大转化率达到了85%，温度为500°C。
2. 膜反应器的转化率与简单PFR转化率进行比较，而不是与未达到平衡的PFR转化率，因为PFR中未实现平衡。
3. 实验结果与模型预测之间的差异可能源自实验因素，也可能源于模型中假设了恒定的传输选择性。
