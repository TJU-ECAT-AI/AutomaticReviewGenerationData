[1] "Operating with a sweeping stream of nitrogen led to undesired increase in conversion due to dilution; even if nitrogen permeation could be avoided the dilution of hydrogen will reduce its economic contribution."
[2] "The economics of this process will depend, among other factors, on the properties on the membrane, as re5ected in its permeability and selectivity, as well as on hydrogen eco- nomics."
[3] "Whether better results could be achieved under pressure (with atmospheric pressure on tube side) will await further experimentation or better modeling of transport."

1. The surge in shale gas production has significantly influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. This has led to a shift towards more sustainable and efficient processes, driven by the availability of abundant and relatively cheap feedstocks. Key technological advancements include the optimization of catalysts, the development of more energy-efficient reactor designs, and the integration of renewable energy sources for power supply. However, current limitations include the need for more cost-effective and selective membranes, the optimization of process integration with existing infrastructure, and the reduction of environmental impacts.

2. The key areas for improvement to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation processes include enhancing the selectivity and permeability of membranes, developing more efficient catalysts, reducing energy consumption through process optimization, integrating waste heat recovery systems, and improving the overall process economics by considering the lifecycle costs and environmental footprints. Additionally, the development of innovative control strategies and the use of digital twins can contribute to more precise process control and predictive maintenance.

3. Experimenting with operating the membrane reactor under pressure with atmospheric pressure on the tube side might potentially offer better results in terms of hydrogen concentration and economic viability. However, this will require further experimentation and the development of accurate models that can predict the behavior of the system under such conditions, including the effects of pressure gradients on membrane performance and the dynamics of the gas phase.
