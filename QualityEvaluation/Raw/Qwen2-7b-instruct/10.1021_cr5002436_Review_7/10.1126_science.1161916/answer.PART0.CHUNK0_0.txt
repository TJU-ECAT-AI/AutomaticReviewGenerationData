The scientific literature discusses various aspects of dehydrogenation technologies, particularly focusing on the modification of carbon nanotubes for catalyzing oxidative processes. It introduces a scheme for achieving subwavelength resolution, which depends on the existence of surface states derived from a mathematically postulated boundary. The literature also explores the potential of reversing the sign of refraction in positively refracting media by coating their surfaces with phase-reversing sheets, suggesting possibilities for curved lenses that could magnify objects. Additionally, it mentions the challenge of creating a 2D hologram and achieving the ideal resolution depicted in Figure 3, which could benefit from enhancing the nonlinearity of existing materials, potentially through the use of plasmonic or metamaterial layers to boost local fields.

文献讨论了脱氢技术的多个方面，特别是对碳纳米管表面改性以催化氧化过程的关注。它介绍了实现亚波长分辨率的方案，这依赖于从数学上假设的边界派生的表面状态的存在。文献还探讨了在正折射介质的表面涂覆相反转层以反转折射率的可能性，这为具有放大物体能力的非球面透镜提供了可能性。此外，它提到了创建2D全息图和达到如图3所示的理想分辨率的挑战，这可能通过增强现有材料的非线性，尤其是通过使用等离子体或超材料层来增强局部场来实现。
