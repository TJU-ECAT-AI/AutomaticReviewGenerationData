[3] "Our original discussion (illustrated in Fig. 2) assumes a single-step transition from +w to w."
[4] "At optical frequencies, perhaps the best system for the realization of these ideas is a four-wave mixing experiment: One of two counterpropagating pump beams of the same frequency as the signal writes a hologram. The second pump beam then reads the hologram to produce a time-reversed signal."
[5] "In other words, there is a two-step process in which there first occurs a transition +w 0 and then a second transition 0 w."
[6] "As a consequence of the 3D nature of the hologram, the second phase-reversed beam (shown on the right of Fig. 1C) is not seen, but if the left-hand surface of the medium is half silver (Fig. 4), reflection of the phase-reversed beam will generate an image to the right of the system reproducing the effect predicted in Fig. 1C and mimicking the Veselago negatively refracting lens."

The document discusses a theoretical framework for achieving subwavelength resolution through the use of time-reversing sheets and four-wave mixing experiments. It explains that a two-step process is involved, where the first step is writing a hologram and the second step is reading it to produce a time-reversed signal. The document also mentions the potential for curved lenses that can magnify objects by reversing the sign of their refractive index, which could lead to improvements in optical systems. Practical challenges, such as creating a 2D hologram and enhancing the nonlinearity of existing media, are highlighted as areas for further research to achieve ideal subwavelength resolution.
