[1] "Butane n Dehydrogenation of Surface-Modified Carbon Nanotubes Catalyze Oxidative"
[2] "Our original discussion (illustrated in Fig. 2) assumes a single-step transition from +w to w."
[3] "Any positively refracting medium can have the sign of its refraction reversed by coating the surface with a phase-reversing sheet."
[4] "As a consequence of the 3D nature of the hologram, the second phase-reversed beam (shown on the right of Fig. 1C) is not seen, but if the left-hand surface of the medium is half silver (Fig. 4), reflection of the phase-reversed beam will generate an image to the right of the system reproducing the effect predicted in Fig. 1C and mimicking the Veselago negatively refracting lens."

The scientific literature discusses the use of surface-modified carbon nanotubes for catalyzing oxidative dehydrogenation of butane. It introduces a scheme for achieving subwavelength resolution through the use of phase-reversing sheets in positively refracting media, which can mimic negatively refracting lenses. The text explains how this concept applies not only to electromagnetic waves but also to acoustic waves, highlighting the development of time-reversal studies in acoustics. It also suggests potential challenges and future directions for realizing such concepts, such as enhancing nonlinearity through plasmonic or metamaterial layers to improve the efficiency of the processes.
