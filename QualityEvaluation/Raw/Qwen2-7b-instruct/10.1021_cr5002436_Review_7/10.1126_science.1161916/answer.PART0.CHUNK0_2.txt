[1] "A scheme for subwavelength resolution was also proposed in (9) but, as noted above, this scheme depended on the existence of surface states derived from a mathematically postulated boundary for which no physical realization has so far been suggested."
[2] "At optical frequencies, perhaps the best system for the realization of these ideas is a four-wave mixing experiment: One of two counterpropagating pump beams of the same frequency as the signal writes a hologram. The second pump beam then reads the hologram to produce a time-reversed signal."
[3] "Any positively refracting medium can have the sign of its refraction reversed by coating the surface with a phase-reversing sheet. This leads to the possibility of curved lenses that can magnify an object."
[4] "Creating a 2D hologram and attaining the ideal shown in Fig. 3 will be a challenge. Enhancing the nonlinearity of existing media possibly through the use of plasmonic or metamaterial layers to enhance the local fields (17) may offer a route to realizing a 2D version and hence subwavelength resolution."

The scientific literature discusses the potential for creating a time-reversing sheet that could enable subwavelength resolution in optical experiments, specifically referencing four-wave mixing experiments for achieving this goal. It also mentions the possibility of using phase-reversing sheets to create curved lenses capable of magnifying objects. Furthermore, it outlines challenges and potential solutions for creating 2D holograms that could lead to subwavelength resolution, suggesting enhancements in the nonlinearity of existing media through the use of plasmonic or metamaterial layers.

文献中讨论了创建能够实现亚波长分辨率的时间反转层的可能性，特别是在光学实验中，特别提到了四波混合实验作为实现这一目标的最佳系统。它还提到可以通过在表面上涂覆相位反转层来使用正折射介质，以反转其折射率，这使得能够制造可以放大物体的曲面透镜成为可能。此外，它概述了创建二维全息图的挑战和潜在解决方案，这些全息图可以导致亚波长分辨率，建议通过使用等离子体或 metamaterial 层增强局部场来增强现有介质的非线性。
