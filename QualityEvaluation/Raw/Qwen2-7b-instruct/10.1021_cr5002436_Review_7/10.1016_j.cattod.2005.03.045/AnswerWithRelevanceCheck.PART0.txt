          [1] "The recent surge in shale gas production has led to a growing demand for olefins and olefinic products, driving the development of various catalytic dehydrogenation processes."
          [2] "Current processes for propene and butenes production from the corresponding alkanes employ mainly fixed bedoperation, but because of the necessarily high temperatures involved in these reversible endothermic reactions, catalyst coking rapidly occurs, so that frequent catalyst regeneration is required."
          [3] "An alternative is the use of a membrane reactor. In recent years, the possibility of overcoming the equilibrium constraint in reversible reactions such as dehydrogenations has attracted wide attention. Separation of the hydrogen product permits a higher conversion or better selectivity to be achieved."
          [4] "Porous membranes such as glass and alumina [6,7] have been used to study the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and conversions as high as two to seven times the equilibrium level have been observed for some reactions [810]."
          [5] "However, these membranes exhibit poor selectivity, due largely to the nature of the flow process in their pore structure."
          [6] "Dense metallic membranes on the other hand, such as palladium and its alloys possess exclusive selectivity to hydrogen and if they can be made sufficiently thin can provide adequate fluxes for hydrogen [11,12]."
          [7] "Isobutane dehydrogenation using catalytic membrane reactors has been studied previously by a number of researchers."
          [8] "In the present paper, the performance of a palladium/ silver membrane reactor containing a platinum catalyst within the membrane tube, is compared with a conventional fixed bed reactor under the same operating conditions."
          [9] "Results and discussion Initial experiments were made with a commercial chromia/alumina catalyst located within the reactor tube of the fixed bed reactor, but this failed to produce significant yields of isobutene within the temperature range of interest (450520 8C)."
          [10] "Clearly the addition of hydrogen has provided a more stable catalyst activity, although a slow decrease is still observed."
          [11] "The activity of this catalyst was tested in the fixed bed mode and a sharp drop of activity was observed, the conversion of isobutane falling to less than 5% over a period of 6 h."
          [12] "However, through the period of a measurement (up to 23 h) the activity was essentially constant."
          [13] "The activity decrease for the membrane reactor was slightly greater than that for the fixed bed mode even with hydrogen addition; this is due mainly to the removal of hydrogen by permeation from the tube side in the membrane reactor giving a higher concentration of olefin which has a greater potential for coke deposition than the isobutane."
          [14] "The product stream from the membrane reactor was found to consist of isobutane, isobutene, hydrogen, methane, propane/propene and very small amounts of C2 and C4 hydrocarbons."
          [15] "The simulation of the fixed bed reactor is based on the following assumptions: flow within the reactor tube is in plug flow; operation is isothermal and isobaric."
          [16] "Permeation measurements had shown a decline in hydrogen permeability after the first few experiments, which was attributed to contamination from feed and product gases."
          [17] "Confirmation of this is given in Fig. 9, where simulations have been made of isobutene yield versus space time for three assumed reaction rates, based on multiples of the measured experimental reaction rate, rA1."
          [18] "Sweep flow rate plays an important role in increasing the conversion in the membrane reactor, a 10-fold increase in sweep rate producing a conversion increase of between 45 and 55%."
          [19] "A simple isothermal model of the process was developed, which although giving good agreement with the fixed bed results, indicated that transport in the membrane reactor was not limited by the permeability of the membrane to hydrogen, but was caused by the relatively low values of the reaction rate produced by the catalyst."
          [20] "Conclusions A comparison has been made between experimental results obtained for a Pd/Ag composite membrane reactor and a fixed bed reactor for the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene using a Pt/alumina catalyst."

          Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have significantly influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. Key advancements include the utilization of membrane reactors, which offer improved selectivity and higher conversion rates compared to traditional fixed bed reactors. These developments aim to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation processes. However, current limitations and areas for improvement include the high energy consumption associated with endothermic reactions, the risk of catalyst deactivation, and the environmental impact of by-product generation. Additionally, optimizing reaction conditions, developing more sustainable catalysts, and integrating waste heat recovery systems are crucial for the ongoing development and implementation of these technologies. The use of dense metallic membranes, specifically palladium and its alloys, has gained prominence due to their exclusive selectivity to hydrogen, which allows for efficient separation of hydrogen products. Optimization of sweep gas flow rates can significantly increase conversion in membrane reactors, with a 10-fold increase leading to a conversion increase of 45-55%. Despite these advancements, limitations and areas for improvement include refining the permeability data for the membrane and adjusting models to account for potential contamination issues. Moreover, the ability of membrane reactors to operate under less severe conditions reduces the extent of catalyst coking and the need for frequent regeneration.

          [1] "The catalysts used in the experiments were 0.5% Pt/alumina pellets."
          [2] "The hydrogen permeability of the membrane was about 0.8 to 1.0 m mol/(m2 s Pa)."

          [6] "The addition of hydrogen to the isobutane feed provided more stable catalyst activity in both the fixed bed and membrane reactors."
          [7] "The membrane reactor's selectivity was greater than that of the fixed bed reactor, with all membrane reactor selectivities lying in the range from 75 to 92%."

          [11] "Pressure increased the rate of the reverse of the main reaction in the fixed bed reactor, thus reducing the selectivity."
          [12] "In the membrane reactor, higher pressure facilitated the membrane's removal of hydrogen, which affected selectivity."

          The catalyst employed in the experiments was 0.5% platinum (Pt) loaded onto alumina pellets. The hydrogen permeability of the membrane was approximately 0.8 to 1.0 millimoles per square meter per second Pascal. The membrane demonstrated a hydrogen/nitrogen selectivity ranging from 1200 to 1500, depending on the pressure differential. After the initial experiments, the membrane's hydrogen permeability decreased due to contamination from the feed and product gases. The membrane reactor exhibited a significantly higher yield of isobutene compared to a fixed bed reactor. The addition of hydrogen to the isobutane feed contributed to more stable catalyst activity in both the fixed bed and membrane reactors. The membrane reactor showed a higher selectivity, with all selectivities ranging from 75 to 92%. Simulations for the membrane reactor consistently yielded slightly higher values than experimental results. Reaction kinetics rather than hydrogen permeability dictated the isobutene yield in the membrane reactor. As the reaction rate increased, the yield of isobutene also increased in the membrane reactor. Pressure in the fixed bed reactor accelerated the reverse reaction, thus decreasing selectivity. In the membrane reactor, higher pressure assisted in the removal of hydrogen, which in turn influenced selectivity.

          实验中使用的催化剂是0.5%的铂（Pt）负载在氧化铝球形颗粒上。膜的氢渗透率为每平方米每秒帕斯卡大约0.8到1.0毫摩尔。膜的氢/氮选择性范围为1200到1500，具体取决于压力差。在最初的实验后，膜的氢渗透率由于来自进料和产品气体的污染而下降。膜反应器的异丁烯产率比固定床反应器高得多。向异丁烷进料中添加氢气为固定床和膜反应器中的催化剂活性提供了更大的稳定性。膜反应器显示出更高的选择性，所有选择性范围在75到92%之间。膜反应器的模拟结果始终略高于实验结果。在膜反应器中，反应动力学而不是氢渗透性决定了异丁烯的产率。随着反应速率的增加，膜反应器中的异丁烯产率也相应增加。固定床反应器中的压力加速了主反应的逆反应，从而降低了选择性。在膜反应器中，较高的压力有助于氢的去除，这反过来又影响了选择性。
