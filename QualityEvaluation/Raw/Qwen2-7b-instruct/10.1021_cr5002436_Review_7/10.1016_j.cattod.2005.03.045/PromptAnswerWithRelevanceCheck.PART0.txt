[1] "The demand for olefins and olefinic products continues to increase and commercially has resulted in a number of catalytic dehydrogenation processes."
[2] "Current processes for propene and butenes production from the corresponding alkanes employ mainly fixed bedoperation, but because of the necessarily high temperatures involved in these reversible endothermic reactions, catalyst coking rapidly occurs, so that frequent catalyst regeneration is required."
[3] "An alternative is the use of a membrane reactor. In recent years, the possibility of overcoming the equilibrium constraint in reversible reactions such as dehydrogenations has attracted wide attention. Separation of the hydrogen product permits a higher conversion or better selectivity to be achieved."
[4] "Porous membranes such as glass and alumina [6,7] have been used to study the catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and conversions as high as two to seven times the equilibrium level have been observed for some reactions [810]."
[5] "However, these membranes exhibit poor selectivity, due largely to the nature of the flow process in their pore structure."
[6] "Dense metallic membranes on the other hand, such as palladium and its alloys possess exclusive selectivity to hydrogen and if they can be made sufficiently thin can provide adequate fluxes for hydrogen [11,12]."
[7] "Isobutane dehydrogenation using catalytic membrane reactors has been studied previously by a number of researchers."
[8] "In the present paper, the performance of a palladium/ silver membrane reactor containing a platinum catalyst within the membrane tube, is compared with a conventional fixed bed reactor under the same operating conditions."
[9] "Results and discussion Initial experiments were made with a commercial chromia/alumina catalyst located within the reactor tube of the fixed bed reactor, but this failed to produce significant yields of isobutene within the temperature range of interest (450520 8C)."
[10] "Clearly the addition of hydrogen has provided a more stable catalyst activity, although a slow decrease is still observed."
[11] "The activity of this catalyst was tested in the fixed bed mode and a sharp drop of activity was observed, the conversion of isobutane falling to less than 5% over a period of 6 h."
[12] "However, through the period of a measurement (up to 23 h) the activity was essentially constant."
[13] "The activity decrease for the membrane reactor was slightly greater than that for the fixed bed mode even with hydrogen addition; this is due mainly to the removal of hydrogen by permeation from the tube side in the membrane reactor giving a higher concentration of olefin which has a greater potential for coke deposition than the isobutane."
[14] "The product stream from the membrane reactor was found to consist of isobutane, isobutene, hydrogen, methane, propane/propene and very small amounts of C2 and C4 hydrocarbons."
[15] "The simulation of the fixed bed reactor is based on the following assumptions: flow within the reactor tube is in plug flow; operation is isothermal and isobaric."
[16] "Permeation measurements had shown a decline in hydrogen permeability after the first few experiments, which was attributed to contamination from feed and product gases."
[17] "Confirmation of this is given in Fig. 9, where simulations have been made of isobutene yield versus space time for three assumed reaction rates, based on multiples of the measured experimental reaction rate, rA1."
[18] "Sweep flow rate plays an important role in increasing the conversion in the membrane reactor, a 10-fold increase in sweep rate producing a conversion increase of between 45 and 55%."
[19] "A simple isothermal model of the process was developed, which although giving good agreement with the fixed bed results, indicated that transport in the membrane reactor was not limited by the permeability of the membrane to hydrogen, but was caused by the relatively low values of the reaction rate produced by the catalyst."
[20] "Conclusions A comparison has been made between experimental results obtained for a Pd/Ag composite membrane reactor and a fixed bed reactor for the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene using a Pt/alumina catalyst."

The recent surge in shale gas production has led to a growing demand for olefins and olefinic products, driving the development of various catalytic dehydrogenation processes. These processes aim to convert alkanes into olefins efficiently. However, traditional fixed-bed operations suffer from catalyst deactivation due to coking at high temperatures, necessitating frequent regeneration. An alternative approach is the utilization of membrane reactors, which have gained attention for their potential to overcome equilibrium constraints in reversible reactions, thereby enhancing conversion or selectivity.

The literature highlights the use of porous membranes, like glass and alumina, for catalytic dehydrogenation studies, achieving conversion levels up to seven times the equilibrium level for certain reactions. However, these membranes often exhibit poor selectivity due to the nature of fluid flow within their pore structures. Dense metallic membranes, specifically palladium and its alloys, offer exclusive selectivity to hydrogen and can be made thin enough to provide adequate hydrogen fluxes.

The performance of a palladium/silver membrane reactor, incorporating a platinum catalyst within the membrane tube, was compared with a conventional fixed bed reactor under similar operating conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency and selectivity of the membrane reactor for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene.

The initial experiments with a commercial chromia/alumina catalyst in the fixed bed reactor did not yield significant isobutene yields within the desired temperature range. However, adding hydrogen to the isobutane feed improved catalyst stability and activity, albeit with a slight decrease over time. The membrane reactor showed higher yields and better selectivities compared to the fixed bed system, mainly due to the efficient hydrogen removal facilitated by the sweep gas flow.

The literature emphasizes the importance of sweep flow rate in increasing conversion in the membrane reactor, demonstrating a conversion increase of 45-55% with a tenfold increase in sweep rate. A simple isothermal model was developed for the process, indicating that transport in the membrane reactor was not limited by hydrogen permeability but rather by the relatively low reaction rates produced by the catalyst.

In conclusion, the study showcases the enhanced efficiency and selectivity of the palladium/silver membrane reactor for isobutane dehydrogenation, offering a promising alternative to traditional fixed bed operations. Key technological advancements include the utilization of dense metallic membranes for efficient hydrogen permeation and the optimization of reactor design to maximize conversion and selectivity.

The limitations highlighted in the document include the potential for catalyst deactivation in fixed bed systems and the need for further research to improve the selectivity and efficiency of membrane reactors. Areas for improvement include refining catalyst formulations, optimizing membrane materials, and enhancing the understanding of reaction kinetics within the membrane reactor. Additionally, addressing the challenges of membrane contamination and ensuring sustainable operation practices are crucial for the industrial viability of these processes.

近年来，页岩气产量的激增推动了对烯烃和烯烃产品的需求增长，进而促进了各种催化脱氢化过程的发展。这些过程旨在高效地将烷烃转化为烯烃。然而，传统的固定床操作由于在高温下会发生催化剂结焦问题，需要频繁再生，因此存在局限性。膜反应器的使用则为克服可逆反应的平衡限制提供了可能，从而提高了转化率或选择性。

文献提到，使用玻璃和氧化铝等多孔膜进行催化脱氢化研究，某些反应的转化率可达均衡水平的七倍之多。然而，这些膜通常具有较差的选择性，主要是因为流体在它们的孔结构中的流动特性所导致。另一方面，由钯及其合金构成的密实金属膜具有专一的氢选择性，并且如果能做得足够薄，则可以提供足够的氢通量。

比较了包含铂催化剂的钯银复合膜反应器与传统固定床反应器的性能，在相同操作条件下进行了实验，目的是评估膜反应器用于异丁烷脱氢制异丁烯的效率和选择性。

最初在固定床反应器中使用商业氧化铬/氧化铝催化剂进行实验时，并未在目标温度范围内获得显著的异丁烯产率。然而，向异丁烷进料中添加氢气改善了催化剂的稳定性和活性，尽管在一段时间内活性仍会缓慢下降。与固定床系统相比，膜反应器表现出更高的产率和更好的选择性，主要归因于由扫流气体流速促进的高效氢去除。

文献强调了扫流速率在提高膜反应器转化率方面的重要性，证明了扫流速率增加十倍可使转化率提高45-55%。开发了一种简单的等温模型来描述该过程，表明膜反应器中的传输并非受限于氢渗透性，而是由催化剂产生的相对较低的反应速率所导致。

总结而言，研究表明钯银复合膜反应器在异丁烷脱氢制异丁烯方面的表现优于传统固定床操作，提供了有前景的替代方案。关键技术进步包括利用密实金属膜高效渗透氢以及优化反应器设计以最大化转化率和选择性。

文献中指出的局限性包括固定床系统中催化剂活性的潜在损失和膜反应器选择性和效率改进的必要性。需要进一步的研究来改进催化剂配方、优化膜材料，并增进对膜反应器内反应动力学的理解。此外，解决膜污染挑战和确保操作实践的可持续性对于这些过程的工业可行性至关重要。

Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have led to a significant shift in the chemical industry towards more efficient and sustainable dehydrogenation technologies. These advancements aim to enhance olefin production processes, focusing on reducing energy consumption, minimizing waste, and improving product selectivity. Key technological improvements include the development of membrane reactors that offer the potential to surpass equilibrium constraints in reversible reactions, enabling higher conversions and better selectivities. 

The use of dense metallic membranes, specifically palladium and its alloys, has gained prominence due to their exclusive selectivity to hydrogen. These membranes, when made thin enough, can facilitate adequate hydrogen flux while allowing for efficient separation of hydrogen products. This separation technique helps in achieving higher conversion rates or better selectivity compared to traditional fixed-bed reactors.

Furthermore, the optimization of sweep gas flow rates plays a crucial role in increasing conversion in membrane reactors. An increase of 10-fold in sweep rate has been observed to produce a conversion increase of between 45 and 55%. This enhancement suggests the pivotal importance of proper flow management in maximizing the efficiency of these reactors.

Despite these advancements, there are still limitations and areas for improvement. The simulation of the membrane reactor often overestimates the yields of isobutene, indicating that the actual hydrogen permeability of the membrane might be lower than initially assumed. This discrepancy could be attributed to contamination from feed and product gases, affecting the membrane's performance over time. Efforts to refine the permeability data and adjust the models accordingly are necessary to achieve more accurate predictions and optimize reactor design.

Moreover, while pressure adjustments influence the yield differently in fixed-bed and membrane reactors, the overall reaction in the latter remains less affected by equilibrium constraints. This property highlights the potential of membrane reactors to operate under less severe conditions, reducing the extent of catalyst coking and the need for frequent regeneration.

In conclusion, the integration of advanced membrane technology in dehydrogenation processes offers promising avenues for enhancing efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability. Ongoing research aims to address technological limitations, optimize reactor designs, and further refine modeling techniques to maximize the benefits of these innovative approaches in olefin production.
