<p>The catalysts used in the experiments were 0.5% Pt/alumina pellets.</p>
<p>The hydrogen permeability of the membrane was about 0.8 to 1.0 m mol/(m2 s Pa).</p>
<p>The membrane had a hydrogen/nitrogen selectivity of 1200 to 1500 depending on the pressure difference.</p>
<p>The membrane reactor's hydrogen permeability declined after initial experiments due to contamination from feed and product gases.</p>
<p>The yield of isobutene in the membrane reactor was much higher compared to the fixed bed reactor.</p>
<p>The addition of hydrogen to the isobutane feed provided more stable catalyst activity in both the fixed bed and membrane reactors.</p>
<p>The membrane reactor's selectivity was greater than that of the fixed bed reactor, with all membrane reactor selectivities lying in the range from 75 to 92%.</p>
<p>The simulation results for the membrane reactor gave consistently slightly higher values than those for experiments.</p>
<p>In the membrane reactor, the reaction kinetics rather than hydrogen permeability limited the yield of isobutene.</p>
<p>The yield of isobutene continued to increase as the reaction rate was increased in the membrane reactor.</p>
<p>Pressure increased the rate of the reverse of the main reaction in the fixed bed reactor, thus reducing the selectivity.</p>
<p>In the membrane reactor, higher pressure facilitated the membrane's removal of hydrogen, which affected selectivity.</p>

The development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production have been influenced by recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production. Key technological advancements include the use of membrane reactors, which offer improved selectivity and higher conversion rates compared to traditional fixed bed reactors. These advancements aim to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation processes. However, current limitations and areas for improvement include the need to optimize catalyst performance, manage the risk of catalyst deactivation, and ensure the robustness of the membrane's hydrogen permeability over time. Additionally, addressing the potential environmental impact and optimizing energy consumption are critical aspects for the ongoing development and implementation of these technologies.
