1. The 3 and 6% CrO3/ZrO2 catalysts possess equal amounts of monochromate and polychromate species, leading to monolayer coverage of about 3% CrO3 on the ZrO2 support. During reaction conditions, the polychromate species is preferentially reduced, while the monochromate species is slightly affected. Cr2O3 crystals, corresponding to the remaining 3% CrO3, are not affected during the reaction. The catalytic activity of both catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is similar, consistent with equal amounts of molecularly dispersed chromia present. Propane ODH results in propene, CO, and CO2 as primary products. Structural-reactivity studies indicate that Cr6+ monochromate and polychromate species are the most effective catalytic active sites for propane ODH.

1. 在3和6% CrO3/ZrO2催化剂中，单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐物种的数量相等，导致ZrO2支持上的单层覆盖率为约3% CrO3。在反应条件下，多铬酸盐物种被优先还原，而单铬酸盐物种受到轻微影响。对应剩余3% CrO3的Cr2O3晶体不受反应影响。两种催化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）活性相似，与存在相同量的分子分散铬酸盐一致。丙烷ODH产生丙烯、CO和CO2作为主要产物。结构-反应性研究表明，Cr6+单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐物种是参与丙烷ODH反应的最有效催化活性位点。
