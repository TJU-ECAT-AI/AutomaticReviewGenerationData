The in situ Raman spectroscopic studies show that the 3 and 6% CrO3/ZrO2 catalysts have an equal amount of monochromate and polychromate species, leading to a monolayer coverage of approximately 3% CrO3 on the ZrO2 support. The 6% CrO3/ZrO2 catalyst has an additional Raman band due to Cr2O3 crystals corresponding to the remaining 3% CrO3. During the reaction conditions, the polychromate species is preferentially reduced, while the monochromate species is slightly affected. The in situ UVvisNIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy indicates that the extent of reduction and the edge energy position of surface Cr6+ cations increase with an increase in the reduction environment. The propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) studies demonstrate that the catalytic activity, expressed as moles of propane converted per gram catalyst per second, is similar for both catalysts, which is consistent with an equal amount of molecularly dispersed chromia present. The propene selectivity remains unaffected by the C3H8/O2 ratio for both catalysts.

在原位拉曼光谱研究下，3%和6% CrO3/ZrO2催化剂具有等量的单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐物种。这导致ZrO2支持上约3% CrO3的单层覆盖。6% CrO3/ZrO2催化剂具有额外的Raman带，对应于剩余的3% CrO3的Cr2O3晶体。在反应条件下，多铬酸盐物种被优先还原，而单铬酸盐物种受到轻微影响。原位UVvisNIR漫反射光谱显示，在稳定态反应条件下，表面Cr6+离子的还原程度和边缘能量位置随降低环境的增加而增加。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）研究表明，催化剂活性以每克催化剂每秒转换的丙烷摩尔数表示，对于两种催化剂来说是相似的，这与存在相同量的分子分散铬氧化物一致。无论C3H8/O2比例如何变化，丙烯选择性均不受影响。
