[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes provides an attractive alternative for the production of alkenes."
[2] "For example, vanadia- and molybdena-based catalysts supported on Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, SiO2, and so forth have been widely studied for alkane ODH reactions."
[3] "Recently, Gao et al. studied the influence of the propane/oxygen ratio on the reduction extent of surface VV cations and the possible effect of reduction extent on the reactivity and selectivity of V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts during propane ODH."
[4] "Grabowski et al. carried out the ODH of isobutane over chromia supported on different oxide supports and observed that the intrinsic activity is high for chromia supported on TiO2 and ZrO2 catalysts."
[5] "Various characterization techniques have been applied to gain an insight about the nature of the chromium oxide species on zirconia, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), in situ Raman, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), electron spin resonance (ESR), and UVvisdiffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) studies."
[6] "In the present study, the ODH of propane over CrO3/ZrO2 catalysts is carried out to better comprehend this system."
[7] "For a better understanding of the CrO3/ZrO2 catalysts, the influence of the propane/oxygen ratio on the reduction of surface Cr cations and the possible effect of reduction extent on the reactivity and selectivity of CrO3/ZrO2 catalysts during propane ODH is studied."
[8] "The propane ODH studies for the 3 and 6% CrO3/ZrO2 catalysts were also performed at 360 and 380 C and propane/oxygen (C3H8/O2) molar ratios of 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1."
[9] "It is observed that an increase in C3H8/O2 results in a marginal increase in activity at 360 and 380 C."
[10] "The product distribution during propane ODH shown in Table 4 is 3340% to propene, 4855% to CO2, and 1016% to CO."
