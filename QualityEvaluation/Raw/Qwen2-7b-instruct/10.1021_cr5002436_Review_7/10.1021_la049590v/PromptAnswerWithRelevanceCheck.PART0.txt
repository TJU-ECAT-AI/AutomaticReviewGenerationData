The molecular structures, oxidation states, and reactivity of 3 and 6% CrO3/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation were examined under different conditions. The in situ Raman spectroscopic studies under dehydrated conditions reveal that the 3 and 6% CrO3/ZrO2 catalysts possess equal amounts of monochromate and polychromate species. Consequently, monolayer coverage on this ZrO2 support is about 3% CrO3. The 6% CrO3/ZrO2 possesses an additional Raman band due to Cr2O3 crystals corresponding to the remaining 3% CrO3. Furthermore, during reaction conditions the polychromate species is preferentially reduced, the monochromate species are slightly affected, and the Cr2O3 crystals are not affected. The in situ UVvisNIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy results reveal that under steady-state reaction conditions the extent of reduction and edge energy position of surface Cr6+ cations increase with an increase in reduction environment for the 3 and 6% CrO3/ZrO2 samples. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) studies reveal that the catalytic activity expressed in moles of propane converted per gram catalyst per second is similar for the two catalysts, which is consistent with equal amounts of molecularly dispersed chromia present. The turnover frequency for the 6% CrO3/ZrO2 catalyst is, however, smaller than that for the 3% CrO3/ZrO2 sample due to the presence of Cr2O3 crystals, which are relatively inactive for propane ODH. For this catalytic system and for the experimental conditions used, propene, CO, and CO2 are primary products. Furthermore, the 3339% propene selectivity is not affected by the C3H8/O2 ratio for both catalysts.

In the study, the researchers examined the molecular structures, oxidation states, and reactivity of 3 and 6% CrO3/ZrO2 catalysts under various conditions. The Raman spectroscopy under dehydrated conditions showed that both catalysts contain equal amounts of monochromate and polychromate species, leading to a monolayer coverage of approximately 3% CrO3 on the ZrO2 support. The 6% CrO3/ZrO2 catalyst additionally has a Raman band due to Cr2O3 crystals, representing the extra 3% CrO3. During reaction conditions, the polychromate species is primarily reduced, while the monochromate species is slightly affected, and the Cr2O3 crystals remain unchanged. The UVvisNIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy indicated that under steady-state conditions, the reduction level and edge energy position of surface Cr6+ ions increase with an increase in the reduction environment for both catalysts. The ODH studies demonstrated that the catalytic activity, measured in moles of propane converted per gram catalyst per second, is similar for both catalysts, reflecting equal amounts of molecularly dispersed chromia. The 6% CrO3/ZrO2 catalyst has a lower turnover frequency compared to the 3% CrO3/ZrO2 sample due to the presence of Cr2O3 crystals, which are less active for propane ODH. Under the experimental conditions, propene, CO, and CO2 are the primary products, and the propene selectivity remains unaffected by the C3H8/O2 ratio for both catalysts.

在研究中，研究人员对3%和6% CrO3/ZrO2催化剂在不同条件下的分子结构、氧化态和反应性进行了检查。在脱水条件下进行的拉曼光谱显示，两种催化剂均含有等量的单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐物种，导致在ZrO2支持上形成一层大约3% CrO3。6% CrO3/ZrO2催化剂还具有一个由于额外的3% CrO3而产生的拉曼带，代表Cr2O3晶体。在反应条件下，多铬酸盐物种主要被还原，单铬酸盐物种受到轻微影响，而Cr2O3晶体保持不变。UVvisNIR漫反射光谱表明，在稳态条件下，表面Cr6+离子的还原程度和边缘能量位置随减少环境的增加而增加，对于两种催化剂都是如此。ODH研究表明，以每克催化剂每秒转换的丙烷摩尔数表示的催化活性相似，这与两种催化剂中均存在的分子分散的铬酸盐一致。6% CrO3/ZrO2催化剂的周转频率低于3% CrO3/ZrO2样品，这是由于Cr2O3晶体的存在，它们对于丙烷ODH活性较低。在实验条件下，丙烯、CO和CO2是主要产物，并且两种催化剂的丙烯选择性不受C3H8/O2比例的影响。

在原位拉曼光谱研究下，3%和6% CrO3/ZrO2催化剂具有等量的单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐物种。这导致ZrO2支持上约3% CrO3的单层覆盖。6% CrO3/ZrO2催化剂具有额外的Raman带，对应于剩余的3% CrO3的Cr2O3晶体。在反应条件下，多铬酸盐物种被优先还原，而单铬酸盐物种受到轻微影响。原位UVvisNIR漫反射光谱显示，在稳定态反应条件下，表面Cr6+离子的还原程度和边缘能量位置随降低环境的增加而增加。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）研究表明，催化剂活性以每克催化剂每秒转换的丙烷摩尔数表示，对于两种催化剂来说是相似的，这与存在相同量的分子分散铬氧化物一致。无论C3H8/O2比例如何变化，丙烯选择性均不受影响。
