The recent surge in shale gas production has led to a significant interest in dehydrogenation technologies for olefin production due to the availability of inexpensive feedstock. Key technological advancements include the development of more efficient catalysts and membrane separators, which allow for better separation of olefins from paraffins. However, current limitations include the need for improvements in catalyst stability and membrane durability, especially under high-pressure conditions. Areas for improvement include enhancing the permselectivity of membranes without compromising hydrogen permeance, and developing more stable catalysts that can withstand harsh reaction conditions without deactivating rapidly. Palladium-based membranes show promise due to their potential for infinite hydrogen permselectivity, but stability issues need to be resolved to realize their full potential.
