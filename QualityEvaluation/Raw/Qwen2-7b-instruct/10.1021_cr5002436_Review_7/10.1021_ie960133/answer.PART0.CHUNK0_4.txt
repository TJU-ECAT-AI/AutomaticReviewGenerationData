[1] "Moderate improvements in propylene yields were obtained with the membrane reactors compared to conventional reactors operated under similar conditions."
[2] "Improvements in both catalyst and membrane stability are needed for the silica-based membrane reactors to be a feasible alternative for propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "The supported palladium membrane was not stable when exposed to the reaction conditions for propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "It is reasonable to assume that improvements in the hydrogen/propane and hydrogen/propylene permselectivities can be obtained while still maintaining the desired hydrogen permeance."
[5] "Thermodynamic equilibrium for propane dehydrogenation strongly favors operation at atmospheric pressure or below."
