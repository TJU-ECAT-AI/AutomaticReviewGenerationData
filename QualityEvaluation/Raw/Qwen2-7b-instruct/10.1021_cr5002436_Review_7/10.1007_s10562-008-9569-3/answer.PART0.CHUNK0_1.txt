[1] "Chromium oxide supported on SBA-15 was modified with Ce species by an incipient method. The effect of Ce on the activity of Cr/SBA-15 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 was investigated. The activity is enhanced for Ce modified Cr/SBA-15 catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2."
[2] "Many research results [1, 3, 4] showed the supported Cr-based catalysts exhibited excellent performances for the ODH reaction."
[3] "The addition of Ce species to Cr/SBA-15 catalysts remarkably changes the redox properties and enhances the catalytic activity of Cr species in the 5.0CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts."
[4] "In the ODH of ethane with CO2 reaction, the Cr6+ species as the active phase is reduced to Cr3+ as a less active species by the dehydrogenated process, simultaneously, the reduced Cr3+ species can be reoxidized to Cr6+ species by CO2, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species play an important role in the ODH of ethane with CO2 reaction over the catalysts."

The document discusses the development of a catalyst that utilizes chromium oxide supported on SBA-15 with cerium species for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. The addition of cerium to the chromium catalyst increases its activity for the dehydrogenation of ethane. The research highlights that supported chromium-based catalysts demonstrate excellent performance for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document explains that the redox properties of the chromium species are significantly altered by the addition of cerium, enhancing the catalytic activity. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide, the chromium (VI) species act as an active phase, which is reduced to chromium (III) species as a less active phase during the dehydrogenation process. Simultaneously, the reduced chromium (III) species can be re-oxidized to chromium (VI) species by carbon dioxide, forming a reduction-oxidation cycle that plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction over the catalysts.

文献讨论了一种用于乙烷与二氧化碳氧化脱氢的催化剂，该催化剂基于SBA-15上支持的铬氧化物，并添加了铈物种。铈的添加提高了铬基催化剂的活性，适用于乙烷的氧化脱氢。研究强调了支持的铬基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的出色性能。文献解释了铈的添加显著改变了铬物种的还原性，从而增强了催化剂的催化活性。在乙烷与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢反应中，六价铬物种作为活性位点，被脱氢过程还原为三价铬物种，这是一种活性较低的物种。同时，还原的三价铬物种可以通过二氧化碳重新氧化为六价铬物种，形成一个还原-氧化循环，在催化剂上的氧化脱氢反应中起着重要作用。
