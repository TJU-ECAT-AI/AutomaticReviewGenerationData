[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene by O2 was an important process as an alternation to thermal cracking of ethane."
[3] "However, the challenge of this reaction was to avoid over-oxidation in order to obtain high selectivity towards ethylene."
[4] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to serve as a medium for supplying heat to the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction, (2) to increase equilibrium conversion by diluting light alkanes, and (3) to maintain the activity of the catalyst over a long time by removing coke formed on the catalyst."
[5] "In the present work, a series of catalysts using Cr as activity species, based on SBA-15 as the support and CeO2 as the promoter, were prepared by the impregnation method, and their catalytic activity for ODH of ethane with CO2 were investigated."
[6] "The main goal is to explore the CeO2 effect on the activity behavior of the catalysts for the ODH of ethane with CO2."
[7] "The 5Cr10Ce/SBA-15 with maximum Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio displays the best catalytic activity for ODH of ethane with CO2."
[8] "For the ODH of ethane over Cr-based catalyst, Chromium species with the high oxidation state were the key to higher catalytic activity during the ODH of ethane."
[9] "This means that CO2 has a function of maintaining chromium oxide in higher oxidation states."
[10] "In addition, for the ODH of ethane with CO2, considerable amounts of CO and H2O are formed during the reaction, demonstrating the occurrence of a reaction between CO2 and H2 (water gas shift reaction)."
[11] "After the reaction for 5 h, the gas flow of the mixture of C2H6 and CO2 was replaced with a gas flow of CO2 at 30 mL/min to treat with the catalysts for 12 h."
[12] "This suggests the interaction between Cr species and SBA-15 or Ce/SBA-15 has changed in the reaction and regeneration treatment."
[13] "This may be caused by the addition of Ce species which can supply mobile oxygen species, as a result, Cr6+ are easer reduced to serve as the active sites in the 5Cr10Ce/SBA-15 catalyst."

The document does not provide information about how recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. The document focuses on the development of a catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using chromium and cerium oxide supported on SBA-15. The document discusses the impact of cerium oxide on the activity of the catalyst, the effect of cerium loading on the dispersion of chromium species, and the catalytic activity of the catalysts in the presence of carbon dioxide. It also mentions the role of carbon dioxide in maintaining the activity of the catalyst over time and its function in the dehydrogenation reaction. The document does not address the broader economic context or the specific impacts on olefin production.
