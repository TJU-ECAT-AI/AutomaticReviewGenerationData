[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene by O2 was an important process as an alternation to thermal cracking of ethane."
[2] "Carbon dioxide is a promising oxidant for dehydrogenation of ethane."
[3] "The 55.0% ethane conversion and 52.8% C2H4 yield can be obtained on the 5Cr10Ce/SBA-15 catalyst."
[4] "This result indicates that the higher Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio can increase the redox potential and has been reflected in the above the TPR profile."
[5] "The 5Cr10Ce/SBA-15 with maximum Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio displays the best catalytic activity for ODH of ethane with CO2."

The document discusses the development of catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using carbon dioxide as an oxidant. It highlights the importance of the chromium-ceria/silica (CrCe/SBA-15) catalyst system, which shows enhanced activity due to the promotion of cerium. The highest conversion of ethane and yield of ethylene are achieved with the 5Cr10Ce/SBA-15 catalyst, which has the highest Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio. This ratio is crucial for the redox activity and catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation process.
