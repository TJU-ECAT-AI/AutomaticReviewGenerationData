The recent surge in shale gas production has led to significant advancements in dehydrogenation technologies for olefin production. These advancements focus on improving efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability. Key technological improvements include the utilization of carbon dioxide as an oxidant in dehydrogenation reactions, which helps in providing heat, increasing equilibrium conversion, and maintaining catalyst activity over long periods. One of the main challenges in dehydrogenation processes is avoiding over-oxidation to ensure high selectivity towards ethylene products. 

In terms of catalyst modification, the incorporation of cerium (Ce) into chromium (Cr)-based catalysts has shown promise. Ce enhances the dispersion of Cr species, improves redox properties, and boosts catalytic activity. This is attributed to the redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, which is crucial for the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. The Ce-Cr interaction facilitates the maintenance of chromium oxide in higher oxidation states, thereby supporting efficient dehydrogenation reactions. 

Despite these advancements, there are still areas requiring improvement. The efficiency and selectivity of dehydrogenation processes need optimization, and sustainable catalysts that can withstand long-term operation without deactivation are still sought after. Additionally, the economic feasibility of these processes, especially regarding energy consumption and cost-effectiveness, remains a critical area of focus for enhancing their industrial viability.

近期，页岩气产量的激增推动了乙烯生产中裂解技术的重大进展。这些进展侧重于提高效率、可持续性和工业可行性。关键技术改进包括将二氧化碳用作裂解反应中的氧化剂，这有助于提供热量、增加平衡转化率，并在催化剂上长期维持活动性。在裂解过程中，避免过氧化以确保乙烯产品的高选择性是主要挑战之一。

在催化剂改性方面，将铈（Ce）引入铬（Cr）基催化剂显示出潜力。Ce显著提高了Cr物种的分散性、改善了还原性质并提升了催化活性。这是由于Cr6+和Cr3+物种之间的氧化还原循环对于使用二氧化碳裂解乙烷至关重要。Ce-Cr相互作用有助于维持铬氧化物处于更高氧化态，从而支持高效的裂解反应。

尽管取得了这些进步，但仍有一些领域需要改进。裂解过程的效率和选择性需要优化，能够长时间运行而不会失活的可持续催化剂仍需寻找。此外，这些过程的经济可行性，特别是关于能源消耗和成本效益，仍然是提高其工业可行性的关键关注点。
