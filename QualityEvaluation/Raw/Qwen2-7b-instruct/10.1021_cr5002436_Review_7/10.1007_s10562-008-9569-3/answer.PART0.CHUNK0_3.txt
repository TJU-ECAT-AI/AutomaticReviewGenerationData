[1] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to serve as a medium for supplying heat to the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction, (2) to increase equilibrium conversion by diluting light alkanes, and (3) to maintain the activity of the catalyst over a long time by removing coke formed on the catalyst."
[2] "The addition of Ce species to Cr/SBA-15 catalysts remarkably changes the redox properties and enhances the catalytic activity of Cr species in the 5.0CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts."
[3] "The high-angle XRD results suggest that the addition of Ce species obviously improves the Cr species dispersion in the CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts."
[4] "The high dehydrogenation activity Cr6+ species can be obtained by the Cr redox cycle during the ODH of ethane in the presence of CO2."

1. In the dehydrogenation process, CO2 is utilized to supply heat for the endothermic reaction, increase equilibrium conversion by diluting lighter alkanes, and maintain catalyst activity over time by removing coke buildup.

2. The incorporation of cerium (Ce) species notably alters the redox characteristics and boosts the catalytic activity of chromium (Cr) species in the 5.0CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts.

3. High-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) findings indicate that the addition of Ce species significantly enhances the dispersion of Cr species within the CrCe/SBA-15 catalysts.

4. High-activity Cr6+ species can be acquired through a redox cycle involving chromium during the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2.
