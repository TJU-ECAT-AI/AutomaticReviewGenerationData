The document discusses the development of a catalyst that utilizes chromium oxide supported on SBA-15 with cerium species for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. The addition of cerium to the chromium catalyst increases its activity for the dehydrogenation of ethane. The research highlights that supported chromium-based catalysts demonstrate excellent performance for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document explains that the redox properties of the chromium species are significantly altered by the addition of cerium, enhancing the catalytic activity. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide, the chromium (VI) species act as an active phase, which is reduced to chromium (III) species as a less active phase during the dehydrogenation process. Simultaneously, the reduced chromium (III) species can be re-oxidized to chromium (VI) species by carbon dioxide, forming a reduction-oxidation cycle that plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction over the catalysts.

文献讨论了一种用于乙烷与二氧化碳氧化脱氢的催化剂，该催化剂基于SBA-15上支持的铬氧化物，并添加了铈物种。铈的添加提高了铬基催化剂的活性，适用于乙烷的氧化脱氢。研究强调了支持的铬基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的出色性能。文献解释了铈的添加显著改变了铬物种的还原性，从而增强了催化剂的催化活性。在乙烷与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢反应中，六价铬物种作为活性位点，被脱氢过程还原为三价铬物种，这是一种活性较低的物种。同时，还原的三价铬物种可以通过二氧化碳重新氧化为六价铬物种，形成一个还原-氧化循环，在催化剂上的氧化脱氢反应中起着重要作用。

The recent surge in shale gas production has led to significant advancements in dehydrogenation technologies for olefin production. These advancements focus on improving efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability. Key technological improvements include the utilization of carbon dioxide as an oxidant in dehydrogenation reactions, which helps in providing heat, increasing equilibrium conversion, and maintaining catalyst activity over long periods. One of the main challenges in dehydrogenation processes is avoiding over-oxidation to ensure high selectivity towards ethylene products. 

In terms of catalyst modification, the incorporation of cerium (Ce) into chromium (Cr)-based catalysts has shown promise. Ce enhances the dispersion of Cr species, improves redox properties, and boosts catalytic activity. This is attributed to the redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, which is crucial for the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. The Ce-Cr interaction facilitates the maintenance of chromium oxide in higher oxidation states, thereby supporting efficient dehydrogenation reactions. 

Despite these advancements, there are still areas requiring improvement. The efficiency and selectivity of dehydrogenation processes need optimization, and sustainable catalysts that can withstand long-term operation without deactivation are still sought after. Additionally, the economic feasibility of these processes, especially regarding energy consumption and cost-effectiveness, remains a critical area of focus for enhancing their industrial viability.

近期，页岩气产量的激增推动了乙烯生产中裂解技术的重大进展。这些进展侧重于提高效率、可持续性和工业可行性。关键技术改进包括将二氧化碳用作裂解反应中的氧化剂，这有助于提供热量、增加平衡转化率，并在催化剂上长期维持活动性。在裂解过程中，避免过氧化以确保乙烯产品的高选择性是主要挑战之一。

在催化剂改性方面，将铈（Ce）引入铬（Cr）基催化剂显示出潜力。Ce显著提高了Cr物种的分散性、改善了还原性质并提升了催化活性。这是由于Cr6+和Cr3+物种之间的氧化还原循环对于使用二氧化碳裂解乙烷至关重要。Ce-Cr相互作用有助于维持铬氧化物处于更高氧化态，从而支持高效的裂解反应。

尽管取得了这些进步，但仍有一些领域需要改进。裂解过程的效率和选择性需要优化，能够长时间运行而不会失活的可持续催化剂仍需寻找。此外，这些过程的经济可行性，特别是关于能源消耗和成本效益，仍然是提高其工业可行性的关键关注点。
