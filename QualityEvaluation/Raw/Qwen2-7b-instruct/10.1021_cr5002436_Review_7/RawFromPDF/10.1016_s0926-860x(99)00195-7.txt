Abstract
When a physical mixture composed of a 0.7 wt.% Pt–Sn-ZSM-5 dehydrogenation (DH) catalyst and a 42 wt.% Bi2O3/SiO2
selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) catalyst is subjected to a DH + SHC redox process operation, it gives substantially higher
than equilibrium propylene yields from propane. At 540◦C, atmospheric pressure and WHSV of 2 h−1, initial microreactor
propylene yields from neat propane are 48.2% at about 90% selectivity, compared to equilibrium oleﬁn yields of 20.0% at
about 95% selectivity when only the DH catalyst is used. The overall propylene yield improvement is 140%. In this novel
redox process arrangement no gaseous oxygen is cofed to the physical mixture; the lattice oxygen of the SHC catalyst is the
sole oxidizing agent to selectively combust the hydrogen produced in situ by the dehydrogenation of the propane, catalyzed
by the commingled DH catalyst. Periodic regeneration with air is necessary to replenish the lattice oxygen of the SHC catalyst
depleted in the redox reaction.
Although still signiﬁcantly (i.e., 65%) above equlibrium, the high initial DH + SHC propylene yields are not sustainable
and decline from 48.2% (ﬁrst cycle) to 33.0% (tenth cycle); i.e., 2.1%/cycle; they are ascribed to the loss of Bi2O3 dispersion
on the SiO2 support caused by the deep redox cycling. Shortening the redox cycle or increasing the SHC/DH catalyst ratio
lessen the decline. However, the identiﬁcation of a more redox stable catalyst is imperative to make the process practical. Some
suggestions are provided. It is surmised that the DH + SHC redox process approach will ultimately (i.e., once a sufﬁciently
redox stable SHC catalyst is identiﬁed) be preferred over the DH- > SHC- > DH cofed approach to improve conventional
dehydrogenation processes such as the Oleﬂex and Catoﬁn processes. ©1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Intoduction
It is known that conventional dehydrogenation (DH)
coupled with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) in
a series DH- > SHC- >DH cofed process arrangement
gives higher than equlibrium yields of light oleﬁns
from the corresponding paraﬁns [1–4].

A more novel alternative approach to DH- > SHC- >
DH cofed process operation [4] is a so called
DH + SHC redox process [3]. In this conﬁguration,
the DH and SHC catalysts are physically mixed and
the lattice oxygen [OL] of the SHC catalyst is the
sole oxidizing agent to selectively combust the in situ
formed hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation
of the parafﬁn which is catalyzed by the commingled
DH component. Recently, a series of metal oxides
have been identiﬁed, e.g., Bi2O3, Bi2Mo3O12, In2O3,
In2Mo3O12 and Sb2O4 that convert hydrogen in great
preference to light parafﬁns or oleﬁns, with SHC se-
lectivites in excess of 98% [3,4]. They function either
in the presence or absence of gaseous oxygen [3]
and are therefore, also suitable for DH + SHC redox
process operation discussed here.
The key to the functioning of these selected Bi-,
In- and Sb-containing oxides in a DH + SHC redox
process is the relatively large amount of lattice oxy-
gen contained in these metal oxides, and the ease and
enormous preference with which their lattice oxygen
reacts with hydrogen rather than hydrocarbons [3].
This behavior contrasts that of the noble metal based
SHC catalysts used by Imai et al. [1] or the pore-
mouth restricted Si(Cu, Fe, Ni)HZSM-5 compositions
used by Lin et al. [2]. While both of these latter
systems are suited for DH- > SHC- > DH cofed op-
eration, they are inoperative for DH + SHC redox
operation. The reason is that the noble metal based
catalysts possess essentially no usable lattice oxygen
while the zeolite-based catalysts contain only a very
small amount of reducible lattice oxygen per unit
weight of catalyst.
Although the DH + SHC redox process is cyclic in
nature while the HD- > SHC- >DH cofed process is
continuous; there are several advantages to the redox
mode of operation. In the cofed process, hydrogen and
gaseous oxygen must be handled in a single reactor
(SHC reactor) which poses a potential safety hazard.
The use of oxygen is preferred over air in the cofed
process because if air were to be used as the oxidant
in the SHC stage(s), the process stream would become
highly diluted with nitrogen, making the staging and
separation unduly costly. Quite to the contrary, hydro-
gen and gaseous oxygen are never cofed or co-reacted
in the redox process, posing no safety hazard. Another
advantage of the redox mode is that air instead of oxy-
gen can be used in the regeneration cycle, which is
much less expensive and easier to handle than gaseous
oxygen.
The DH + SHC redox process study reported here
for the conversion of propane to propylene was per-
formed on a microreactor scale with a physical mix-
ture of a 0.7 wt.% Pt–Sn-ZSM-5 DH catalyst and a
42 wt.% Bi2O3/SiO2 SHC catalyst.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts
A 42 wt.% Bi2O3/SiO2 composition employed
in this study as the SHC catalyst was prepared
as discussed earlier [3,4] and was sized to 20–40
mesh before use in catalytic evaluations. A 0.7 wt.%
Pt–Sn-ZSM-5 DH catalyst used here was the same as
that of a complimentary study [4] and was prepared
according to known procedures [5].
2.2. Experimental setup and procedures
The experimental setup for the DH and DH + SHC
redox experiments was an automated microreactor unit
described earlier [3].
The
DH
experiments
were
carried
out
with
a
50/50 wt.%
physical
mixture
of
a
0.7 wt.%
Pt–Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst and quartz; the DH + SHC re-
dox experiments with a 50/50 wt.% physical mixture
of the same 0.7 wt.% Pt–Sn-ZSM-5 DH catalyst and
a 42 wt.% Bi2O3/SiO2 catalyst.
Two sets of DH + SHC redox experiments were
carried out. In the ﬁrst set, four 130 min redox cy-
cles were performed, followed by regeneration with
air. The experimental conditions were 550◦C, atm
press, WHSV 2 h−1 and neat propane as feed. Within
each redox cycle, six consecutive gas samples were
taken for analysis. The ﬁrst sample was taken by
collecting the entire efﬂuent in an evacuated gas bulb
over the initial 5 min of the experiment and with an
aliquot therefrom being analyzed by GC (Hewlett
Packard). Subsequent samples were taken at 25 min
time intervals; again collecting the entire efﬂuent
over respective 5 min time spans. The hydrocarbon
ﬂow was stopped after 130 min on stream and the
catalyst mixture ﬂushed with 200 cc/mm helium for

5 min, followed by regeneration in O2/He for 15 min
before propane feed was reintroduced and another
redox cycle started. The regeneration conditions were
relatively mild by ﬂowing a 2% O2 in He stream at
350◦C over the catalyst mixture for the ﬁrst 5 min,
increasing the O2 concentration of the gas stream at
a rate of 5%/min over the next 10 min until an O2
level of 21% was reached. The aim was to minimize
the exotherm, and to avoid Pt agglomeration in the
zeolite of the DH catalyst.
In a second set of experiments, the redox period
between regenerations was shortened from 130 to
2.8 min. The intent was to less deeply reduce the
SHC catalyst, minimizing its restructuring. The gas
sampling was performed as in the ﬁrst set, except that
the time collection of respective efﬂuent samples in a
pre-evacuated gas bulb prior to GC analysis amounted
to 2.8 min rather than 5 min. The experimental condi-
tions were the same as in the ﬁrst set, except that the
temperature was lowered to 540◦C.
The cabon balances in both sets of experiments were
typically 100 + /−2%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. DH experiments
The DH experiments using a 0.7 wt.% Pt–Sn-ZSM-5
DH catalyst diluted with 50 wt.% quartz were carried
out in a microreactor at 540◦C, atmospheric pressure,
neat propane as feed and at space velocities (WHSV)
of 1, 2, and 4 (g C◦3/g cat/h). The hydrogenation
reaction was carried out over a period of 130 min,
with periodic sampling and analysis of the efﬂuent,
followed by an artiﬁcial air (i.e., O2/He) regeneration
for 15 min as indicated in Section 2. At WHSV = 1
and 2 h−1 the propane conversions are stable over the
course of the four cycles tested and are 23.5% and
22.5%, respectively, the corresponding selectivities
to propylene are 97% and 98%, respectively. The
carbon balances are 100+/−2%. Due to the relative
constancy of the propane conversions and propylene
yields, it was assumed that equilibrium was achieved
under either condition. The propane conversion be-
gins to decrease (by about 1.5% absolute) at WHSV=
4 h−1, although the propylene selectivity remains high
at about 98%. Due to the indicated activity decline
at the higher WHSV, the intermediate WHSV = 2 h−1
was chosen to be representative of equilibrium DH
and is illustrated as the base line over four 130 min
cycles in Fig. 2.
3.2. DH+SHC redox experiments
In the DH + SHC redox process mode, the DH and
SHC catalysts are physically intimately mixed in a
single reactor (Fig. 1) and the lattice oxygen [O]L of
SHC catalyst is the sole oxidant for the combustion
of the in situ produced hydrogen coming from the de-
hydrogenation reaction of the parafﬁn, catalyzed by
the DH component. As the lattice oxygen of the SHC
catalyst becomes depleted in the redox cycle, it must
be replenished by gaseous oxygen in a subsequent re-
oxidation step. Thereafter, a new redox cycle can be
started again. Because of the high selectivity and ac-
tivity requirements of the lattice oxygen for preferen-
tial conversion of hydrogen over hydrocarbons in the
redox process operation, only a limited number of cat-
alysts meet these demands [3]. Bi2O3 is one of them.
In a ﬁrst set of DH + SHC redox experiments the
physically mixed Pt–Sn-ZSM-5 + Bi2O3/SiO2 cata-
lysts (1/1 weight ratio) were tested at 550◦C, atm
pressure, WHSV 2 h−1 and neat propane as feed. The
propylene yields are shown in Fig. 2, and are com-
pared to the yield base line of the above discussed
dehydrogenation only. The propylene yield for the
mixed (DH + SHC) catalyst system over the initial

tions. C3= yield vs. time on stream and redox cycle. Feed: neat
propane, temperature = 550◦C, pressure = atm, WHSV = 2 h−1, cy-
cle time=130 min.
5 min of feed ﬂow is 44.4% and hence signiﬁcantly
higher than the 19.2% yield obtained under campa-
rable conditions with the DH catalyst system alone.
It is a 130% yield improvement over equilibrium. At
longer times on stream the propylene yield declines
and converges to equilibrium values which is entirely
expected, because the lattice oxygen of the SHC cat-
alyst is spent and the SHC catalyst ceases to function
until it is again re-oxidized.
The results reveal that Bi2O3 acts as an effective
SHC catalyst in the absence of gaseous oxygen and
in the presence of a DH catalyst, as long as it has
still some available lattice oxygen. Under the condi-
tions of the experiment, 17 cc C◦3/g cat/min (WHSV
2 h−1) were fed to the reactor over the time span of
5 min, the period over which the ﬁrst sample was col-
lected. If the DH + SHC redox reactor were to perform
as an inﬁnite series of perfectly selective DH- > SHC
stages, then in this idealized case all of the propane
would be converted by the DH catalyst to propylene
and all of the hydrogen by the SHC catalyst to wa-
ter. Under such idealized conditions the DH catalyst
would generate 85 cc or 3.8 mmole hydrogen during
the 5 min of the reaction. To combust this H2O would
require the equivalent of 3.8 mg atom lattice oxygen
[O]L/g cat/5 min. Since each gram of Bi2O3/SiO2 cat-
alyst contains the equivalent of 2.7 mg atom [O]L,there
is at best only enough lattice oxygen available to com-
bust 2.7/3.8 or 71% of the hydrogen produced by the
DH catalyst. If any of the lattice oxygen of the SHC
catalyst were to be used to also produce COx from
the hydrocarbons, the maximum attainable propylene
yield would be less than 71%. If a 98% preferential se-
lectivity for H2 over propane combustion is assumed
for Bi2O3 (i.e., a value found earlier for the redox re-
action in the absence of a DH catalyst [3]), the hy-
drocarbon combustion would require an equivalent of
about 0.8 mg atom [O]L, thereby lowering the pos-
sible propane conversion to 2.7–0.8/3.8 or to about
50%. (Note: To produce CO2 and H2O from propane
requires 10 [O]L as compared to 1[O]L to convert H2
to H2O). In good agreement with these simple stoi-
chiometric considerations is the experimentally found
propane conversion of 49.5%. Since in addition to
COx there are also some cracked by-products formed,
the propylene yield observed is not the thus expected
48.5% (i.e., if [O]L selectivity for H2 were 98%), but
still a very reasonably close value of 44.4%. Thus, the
material balance closure of these experiments is very
good, conﬁrming that Bi2O3 is a good and selective
SHC catalyst.
It is obvious, that the duration of the 130 min re-
dox cycle is long for the highly reactive Bi2O3, since
all of its lattice oxygen is already consumed within,
or even prior to, the termination of the ﬁrst sampling
(i.e., within or before the initial 5 min). When avail-
able lattice oxygen is lacking in the SHC catalyst, the
DH + SHC system begins to operate simply as a con-
ventional DH system and the oleﬁn production reverts
to equilibrium values of about 19–20% propylene (see
Fig. 2). Under these rather severe reduction conditions,
the Bi2O3 catalyst begins to age by loss of Bi2O3 dis-
persion on the SiO2 support, impairing the subsequent
reoxidation process of the reduced catalyst. Therefore,
the propane conversions and propylene yields decline
with cycle number as seen from the initial (5 min) sam-
plings of consecutive cycles (Fig. 2). The initial propy-
lene yield of 44.7% (ﬁrst cycle) declines to 31.5%
(fourth cycle); a decline of approximately 3.2%/cy-
cle. Nonetheless, even under these harsh experimental
conditions the observed oleﬁn yield increase after four
redox cycles using a physically mixed DH + SHC cat-
alyst system is still about 50% above the equilibrium
yield attained by the DH catalyst alone.
In a second set of DH + SHC redox experiments
(Fig. 3) the redox cycle time was substantially short-
ened to last only 2.8 min, instead of the 130 min used

in the ﬁrst set of experiments. The experimental con-
ditions were 540◦C, atm pressure, WHSV 2 h−1 and
neat propane as feed. The efﬂuent sampling was done
over the entire 2.8 min of each respective redox cycle
and with air regeneration between the cycles as de-
scribed in Section 2.
The duration of the redox experiments is shortened
to the point that only 80% of the available lattice oxy-
gen of the Bi2O3 catalyst should be consumed if only
the in situ formed hydrogen were extracting the lattice
oxygen of the SHC catalyst (i.e., the C◦3 feed/[O]L ra-
tio was set at 0.8). However, since the independently
measured SHC selectivity of this catalyst is about 98%
[3], with the remainder of the lattice oxygen going to
produce COx, essentially all the available lattice oxy-
gen of the Bi2O3 would still be consumed in 2.8 min
of the experiment.
The results shown in Fig. 3 reveal that an initial
propane conversion of 59.9% and a propylene yield of
48.2% are obtained under DH + SHC redox conditions
using the physical mixture of 0.7 wt.% Pt–Sn-ZSM-5
and 42 wt.% Bi2O3/SiO2. This compares favorably
with a 27.5% propane conversion and a 20% propy-
lene yield when only the Pt–Sn-ZSM-5 DH catalyst is
used. Hence, the propylene yield increase is 140% for
the ﬁrst cycle of operation. Based on thermodynamic
calculations [4], the 48.2% propylene yield is equiv-
alent to that expected from about 2–2.5 theoretical,
sequential DH- > SHC- > DH stages, demonstrating a
rather good overall efﬁciency of the physical mixture.

tions. C3◦conversion and C3= yield vs. redox cycle. Feed: neat
propane, temperature = 540◦C, pressure=atm, WHSV=2 h−1 cycle
time=2.8 min.
Unfortunately, this initial favourable performance
begins to decline with cycle time. Over the period of
10 consecutive redox cycles, the propylene yield de-
creases from 48.2% (1st cycle) to 33.0% (10th cycle)
(Fig. 4), a decrease of about 2.2%/cycle. Nonetheless,
the propylene yield remains over the entire 10 cycles of
operation well (i.e., at least 65%) above equilibrium.
The reduction of the Bi2O3 is still too severe to en-
tirely halt some irreversible restructuring and thereby
loss of active phase dispersion on the SiO2 catalyst
support. Although the activity of the Bi2O3/SiO2
system declines, the selectivity remains essentially
unimpaired. While the redox cycles could be still fur-
ther shortened to further curtail the activity decline,
it becomes a matter of diminishing returns. A better
approach would be to increase the SHC/DH catalyst
ratio or to slow down the release of the lattice oxy-
gen of Bi2O3 by chemical means (e.g., doping). In
sum, a more rugged SHC catalyst must be found for
the DH + SHC redox operation to become a practical
reality.
4. Conclusions
A physical mixture of equal weights of a 0.7 wt.%
Pt–Sn-ZSM-5 DH catalyst and a 42 wt.% Bi2O3/SiO2
SHC catalyst, when operated in a DH + SHC redox
14

process mode, gave propylene yields from propane in
excess of equilibrium. In this process arrangement, no
gaseous oxygen is co-fed to the physical mixture of
catalysts during the redox process. The sole oxidizing
agent for the selective conversion of the in situ gen-
erated hydrogen is the lattice oxygen of the SHC cat-
alyst. The SHC catalyst which is reduced during the
redox process must be periodically reoxidized with air.
In this microreactor scale study, propylene yields
from neat propane as high as 48.2% were obtained
at 540◦C, atm pressure and WHSV 2 h−1 in the ini-
tial stages of the experiment, comprising a 140% yield
improvement above the 20.0% equilibrium yield ob-
tained when the DH catalyst was used alone.
Although the oleﬁn yields remain well above equi-
librium value (i.e., >65% higher), they unfortunately
decline from the initial 48.2% to 33.0% after 10 redox
cycles (ie., 2.1%/cycle). The decline, ascribed to the
loss of Bi2O3 dispersion on the SiO2 support caused
by the deep reduction cycling is too large for the
process to be practical as it stands, using the catalysts
employed. Therefore, a more rugged SHC catalyst
composition must be identiﬁed to make the process
practical. Possible candidates for this purpose are
solids exhibiting excellent reversibility of lattice oxy-
gen removal and re-incorporation after severe reduc-
tion used in (amm)oxidation reactions and comprise
several Bi-based complex mixed metal molybdates
and their analogous tungstates and phosphates. Such
catalysts are extremely insensitive to restructuring in
(amm)oxidation reactions even under the most severe
reducing conditions [6]. They might prove to be also
useful as SHC catalysts.
Finally, it is surmised that the novel DH + SHC
redox process approach discussed in this study will
ultimately (i.e., once a sufﬁciently redox stable SHC
catalyst is identiﬁed) be preferred over the older
DH- > SHC- > DH cofed approach [1,2,4] to improve
conventional dehydrogenation processes such as the
Oleﬂex and Catoﬁn processes.
