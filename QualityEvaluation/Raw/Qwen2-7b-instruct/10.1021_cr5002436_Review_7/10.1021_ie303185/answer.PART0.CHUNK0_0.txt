[1] "The process limitations are currently faced by employing serial systems where catalytic reaction and catalyst regeneration take place in different batch reactors that provide a semicontinuous propylene production."
[2] "The catalytic propane dehydrogenation is an already implemented process at industrial scale. As an example, BASF built a 350 kt/year plant in Tarragona (Spain) in 2004 based on the Oleflex process."
[3] "The rise of shale gas has favored the use of propane as raw material, and several companies (Dow, Formosa Plastics, Enterprise Products) have announced new plants for 600–700 kt/year each."
[4] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation has been tested on different reactor configurations employing PtSn/MgAl2O4 as a catalyst."
[5] "The coke is deposited over the catalyst surface, inhibiting its activity and producing a severe and continuous yield decrease."
[6] "Although the use of membranes in fluidized bed reactors, as a way to increase the conversion, has been described by several groups, (28, 29) the combination of reaction, regeneration, and separation in a single unit is highly novel."

Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have significantly influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. The abundance and affordability of propane as a feedstock have driven the expansion of olefin production capacities. Key technological advancements include the implementation of integrated reactor configurations, such as two-zone fluidized bed reactors (TZFBRs), which combine catalytic reactions, catalyst regeneration, and product separation in a single unit. These advancements aim to address the limitations associated with traditional batch reactor setups, offering more efficient, sustainable, and industrially viable processes. Current limitations and areas for improvement include the optimization of catalyst selection and design, particularly in materials that can withstand high temperatures while minimizing coke formation. The integration of palladium membranes within these reactors facilitates hydrogen removal, enhancing conversion beyond thermodynamic equilibrium, and maintaining steady-state activity through in-situ regeneration. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including the operational constraints of palladium membranes at high temperatures and the need for further research into materials capable of meeting both the desired reaction temperature range and membrane operation requirements.
