[1] "The process limitations are currently faced by employing serial systems where catalytic reaction and catalyst regeneration take place in different batch reactors that provide a semicontinuous propylene production."
[2] "Other industrial configurations consist of supplying hydrogen with propane feed with an aim of reducing coke formation in reaction but reaching lower yield to propylene."
[3] "The catalytic propane dehydrogenation is an already implemented process at industrial scale."
[4] "As an example, BASF built a 350 kt/year plant in Tarragona (Spain) in 2004 based on the Oleflex process."
[5] "The rise of shale gas has favored the use of propane as raw material, and several companies (Dow, Formosa Plastics, Enterprise Products) have announced new plants for 600700 kt/year each."
[6] "The use of membranes in fluidized bed reactors, as a way to increase the conversion, has been described by several groups."
[7] "The combination of reaction, regeneration, and separation in a single unit is highly novel."
[8] "With this catalyst, cracking and coking reactions are hindered."
[9] "By this way, the limitation found in the previous study could be solved."
[10] "The advantage of using PtSn/MgAl2O4, instead of PtSnK/γAl2O3 as in previous study, comes from its lower coking tendency."

Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have led to an increased demand for olefin production, driving the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies. The key advancements include the integration of reaction, regeneration, and separation in a single reactor, which addresses limitations in traditional batch processes. This novel two-zone fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR) with a palladium membrane enhances conversion by removing hydrogen, shifting the reaction equilibrium towards propylene production. However, this technology faces challenges in balancing the oxygen flow for optimal regeneration while minimizing propylene selectivity loss. Areas for improvement include refining catalyst design to reduce coking tendencies and developing palladium membranes capable of operating at higher temperatures, aligning with the desired reaction temperature range. The economic benefits of shale gas production have facilitated the expansion of dehydrogenation capacity, with companies like Dow, Formosa Plastics, and Enterprise Products announcing significant new plant expansions. The use of PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalysts, which exhibit lower coking tendencies compared to alternatives, contributes to the enhanced efficiency and sustainability of these processes.
