[1] "The process limitations are currently faced by employing serial systems where catalytic reaction and catalyst regeneration take place in different batch reactors that provide a semicontinuous propylene production."
[2] "Other industrial configurations consist of supplying hydrogen with propane feed with an aim of reducing coke formation in reaction but reaching lower yield to propylene."
[3] "Although the use of membranes in fluidized bed reactors, as a way to increase the conversion, has been described by several groups, (28, 29) the combination of reaction, regeneration, and separation in a single unit is highly novel."
[4] "To achieve a maximum yield at steady state, the TZFBR needs an exhaustive optimization of its operational conditions."
[5] "With this catalyst, cracking and coking reactions are hindered. Therefore, the oxidant requirements in the TZFBR will be lower, providing high propylene selectivity."
[6] "The use of PtSn/MgAl2O4, instead of PtSnK/γAl2O3 as in previous study, comes from its lower coking tendency."
[7] "The limitation is the operation range of palladium membranes, which is different from the desirable reaction temperature range of the catalytic propane dehydrogenation."
[8] "New palladium alloy membranes are needed to meet both operation requirements, with the aim of testing TZFBR with membranes at high temperatures."
[9] "The results of solid characterization tests have shown that MgAl2O4 was correctly synthesized."
[10] "The BET area was 123 m2/g, and the pore volume 0.26 cm3/g."
[11] "As can be observed in Figure 5, the higher the reaction temperature, the faster the catalyst deactivation and the sharper the propane conversion decrease."
[12] "In this case, the catalyst was perfectly regenerated in situ, and it maintained the same activity along the time."
[13] "For TZFBR and TZFBR+MB configurations these selectivities correspond to a stationary state."
[14] "It may be seen that a higher yield to propylene related to equilibrium conversion of propane in a conventional reactor (Y*C3H6) is obtained with the TZFBR and especially with TZFBR+MB of Pd than with other reacting configuration used in literature."
[15] "Moreover, it is worth remembering that the literature values shown in Figure 12 are instantaneous results in experiments with catalyst deactivation whereas the values obtained with both the TZFBR and the TZFBR+MB reactor configurations correspond to the steady state when the coke formation is counteracted continuously by the regeneration in the lower zone of the bed."

1. Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production by increasing the availability and affordability of propane, a key feedstock for these processes. This has led to a growing demand for more efficient and sustainable dehydrogenation technologies capable of converting propane into propylene, a crucial feedstock for downstream olefin production. Key technological advancements include the development of two-zone fluidized bed reactors (TZFBR) with palladium membranes, which integrate catalytic reaction, catalyst regeneration, and molecular separation in a single unit. Current limitations involve the operational range of palladium membranes, which differs from the ideal temperature range for catalytic propane dehydrogenation. Areas for improvement focus on developing new palladium alloy membranes that can operate at high temperatures while maintaining the benefits of the TZFBR configuration. This would enable enhanced process efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability by achieving higher yields to propylene and maintaining stable catalytic activity.

2. The results show that the use of PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst, instead of PtSnK/γAl2O3, offers lower coking tendencies, which reduces the need for regenerative oxygen in the TZFBR, leading to higher propylene selectivity. The TZFBR with palladium membranes demonstrates improved conversion and yield to propylene compared to conventional reactors. It achieves steady-state operation, maintaining constant activity and achieving higher yields than those reported in the literature for conventional reactors. This indicates significant process intensification, enhanced efficiency, and sustainability in olefin production through advanced dehydrogenation technologies.

1. 近期经济因素，尤其是页岩气产量的激增，影响了脱氢技术在烯烃生产中的开发和采用。这增加了丙烷的可用性和成本效益，这是一个关键的原料，用于这些过程。关键的技术进步包括开发双区流化床反应器（TZFBR）与钯膜，将催化反应、催化剂再生和分子分离整合在一个单元中。当前的局限性在于钯膜的操作范围，这与催化丙烷脱氢的理想温度范围不同。改进的重点集中在开发能够在高温下运行的同时保持TZFBR配置优势的新钯合金膜上。这将使过程效率、可持续性和工业可行性得到增强，通过实现更高的丙烯产率和维持稳定的催化剂活性来实现。

2. 结果表明，使用PtSn/MgAl2O4催化剂而不是PtSnK/γAl2O3，具有较低的结焦倾向，这降低了在TZFBR中需要的再生氧量，从而提高了丙烯选择性。TZFBR带有钯膜显示了与传统反应器相比，丙烷转化和丙烯产率的改善。它实现了稳定状态操作，保持恒定的活性并实现了文献中报告的传统反应器相比更高的丙烯产率。这表明了显著的过程强化、提高的效率和可持续性，通过先进的脱氢技术在烯烃生产中实现。
