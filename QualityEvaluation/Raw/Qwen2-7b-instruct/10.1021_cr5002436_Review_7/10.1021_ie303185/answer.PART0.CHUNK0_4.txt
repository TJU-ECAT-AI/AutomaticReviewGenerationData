The recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have led to an increased demand for olefin production. This has driven the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies as a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods. The key technological advancements include the use of advanced catalysts, such as PtSn/MgAl2O4, which offer lower coking tendencies, thereby improving the efficiency and sustainability of the processes. Current limitations include the high cost of materials, notably palladium and substrates, which act as bottlenecks for large-scale or distributed applications. To enhance the industrial viability of these processes, there is a need to address areas for improvement such as:

1. Cost reduction: Reducing the cost of palladium and substrates to make dehydrogenation technologies more economically viable for large-scale and distributed applications.
2. Efficiency enhancement: Developing more efficient catalysts that can operate at higher temperatures without compromising on the yield of propylene.
3. Process intensification: Integrating reactor designs that allow for continuous operation and efficient separation, such as the two-zone fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR) with palladium membranes, which can improve conversion and maintain steady-state operation.
4. Technology adaptation: Designing palladium alloy membranes that can operate within the desired reaction temperature range for catalytic propane dehydrogenation, thus expanding the operational flexibility and efficiency of the process.
5. Sustainability considerations: Ensuring that the development of dehydrogenation technologies aligns with environmental and sustainability goals, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and waste management strategies.
6. Scalability: Improving the scalability of dehydrogenation technologies to meet growing demand while maintaining operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

These advancements aim to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation processes, making them more competitive and environmentally friendly alternatives for olefin production.
