When a physical mixture composed of a 0.7 wt.% PtSn-ZSM-5 dehydrogenation (DH) catalyst and a 42 wt.% Bi2O3/SiO2 selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) catalyst is subjected to a DH + SHC redox process operation, it gives substantially higher than equilibrium propylene yields from propane. At 540C, atmospheric pressure and WHSV of 2 h1, initial microreactor propylene yields from neat propane are 48.2% at about 90% selectivity, compared to equilibrium olefin yields of 20.0% at about 95% selectivity when only the DH catalyst is used. The overall propylene yield improvement is 140%.

Although still significantly (i.e., 65%) above equlibrium, the high initial DH + SHC propylene yields are not sustainable and decline from 48.2% (first cycle) to 33.0% (tenth cycle); i.e., 2.1%/cycle; they are ascribed to the loss of Bi2O3 dispersion on the SiO2 support caused by the deep redox cycling. Shortening the redox cycle or increasing the SHC/DH catalyst ratio lessen the decline. However, the identification of a more redox stable catalyst is imperative to make the process practical.

It is surmised that the DH + SHC redox process approach will ultimately (i.e., once a sufficiently redox stable SHC catalyst is identified) be preferred over the DH- > SHC- > DH cofed approach to improve conventional dehydrogenation processes such as the Oleflex and Catofin processes.

Answer: The development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production have been influenced by recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production. This has led to a shift towards more efficient and sustainable processes, such as the redox process mode (DH + SHC), which combines dehydrogenation and selective hydrogen combustion. Key technological advancements include the identification of metal oxides like Bi2O3, Bi2Mo3O12, In2O3, In2Mo3O12, and Sb2O4 that exhibit high selectivity in hydrogen combustion, suitable for both redox and cofed processes. Current limitations involve the lack of a redox-stable SHC catalyst, leading to declining propylene yields over multiple cycles due to the loss of catalyst dispersion. Areas for improvement focus on developing more stable catalysts, optimizing redox cycles, and enhancing the overall efficiency of the redox process to match or surpass conventional dehydrogenation methods like Oleflex and Catofin.

最近的经济因素，尤其是页岩气产量的激增，对脱氢技术在轻烯烃生产中的发展和采用产生了影响。这导致了更高效和可持续过程的转变，如红氧化合物模式（DH + SHC），结合了脱氢和选择性氢燃烧。关键技术进步包括识别出具有高氢燃烧选择性的金属氧化物，如Bi2O3、Bi2Mo3O12、In2O3、In2Mo3O12和Sb2O4，适用于红氧化合物和共喂过程。当前的局限性在于缺乏稳定的红氧化合物催化剂，导致在多次循环中丙烯产量下降，原因是催化剂分散度的损失。改进区域集中在开发更稳定的催化剂、优化红氧化合物周期以及提高整个红氧化合物过程的效率，以匹配或超过传统的脱氢方法，如Oleflex和Catofin。
