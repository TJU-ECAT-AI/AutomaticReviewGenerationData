[1] "It is known that conventional dehydrogenation (DH) coupled with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) in a series DH- > SHC- >DH cofed process arrangement gives higher than equlibrium yields of light olefins from the corresponding parafins [14]."
[2] "Recently, a series of metal oxides have been identified, e.g., Bi2O3, Bi2Mo3O12, In2O3, In2Mo3O12 and Sb2O4 that convert hydrogen in great preference to light paraffins or olefins, with SHC se- lectivites in excess of 98% [3,4]."
[3] "Although still significantly (i.e., 65%) above equlibrium, the high initial DH + SHC propylene yields are not sustainable and decline from 48.2% (first cycle) to 33.0% (tenth cycle); i.e., 2.1%/cycle; they are ascribed to the loss of Bi2O3 dispersion on the SiO2 support caused by the deep redox cycling."
[4] "It is surmised that the DH + SHC redox process approach will ultimately (i.e., once a sufficiently redox stable SHC catalyst is identified) be preferred over the DH- > SHC- > DH cofed approach to improve conventional dehydrogenation processes such as the Oleflex and Catofin processes."

The surge in shale gas production has led to a significant shift in the petrochemical industry towards more efficient and sustainable dehydrogenation technologies for olefin production. These advancements focus on improving the yield of light olefins from paraffins through coupling dehydrogenation (DH) with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) processes. Key technological advancements include the identification of metal oxides like Bi2O3, Bi2Mo3O12, In2O3, In2Mo3O12, and Sb2O4 that exhibit high selectivity for hydrogen conversion to light paraffins or olefins, often exceeding 98%. However, despite achieving high initial yields that surpass equilibrium values, the efficiency of these processes declines over time due to the loss of dispersion of the SHC catalyst components, specifically Bi2O3, on the SiO2 support structure. This loss of dispersion is attributed to the intense redox cycling involved in the process. The development of more redox-stable SHC catalysts is essential to overcome this limitation and enhance the overall efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation processes. Once a sufficiently stable SHC catalyst is identified, the DH + SHC redox process is anticipated to surpass traditional DH- > SHC- > DH cofed methods, offering improved performance in conventional dehydrogenation processes such as the Oleflex and Catofin processes.

石油天然气产量的增长推动了聚合物生产行业向更高效和可持续的脱氢技术转变，以实现从烷烃到轻质烯烃的转化。这些进步集中在通过结合脱氢（DH）与选择性氢燃烧（SHC）过程来提高烷烃转化为轻质烯烃的产率上。关键的技术进步包括识别出Bi2O3、Bi2Mo3O12、In2O3、In2Mo3O12和Sb2O4等金属氧化物，它们在氢转换为轻质烷烃或烯烃时表现出极高的选择性，选择性通常超过98%。然而，尽管实现了显著高于平衡值的高初始产率，但随着时间的推移，该效率逐渐下降，从第一次循环的48.2%下降到第十次循环的33.0%，平均每月下降约2.1%。这种下降归因于SHC催化剂成分，尤其是SiO2支持结构上的Bi2O3的分散损失，这是由于强烈的氧化还原循环引起的。确定更多耐氧化还原稳定的SHC催化剂是至关重要的，以克服这一限制，并增强脱氢过程的整体效率、可持续性和工业可行性。一旦找到足够稳定的SHC催化剂，DH + SHC氧化还原过程预计将超越传统的DH- > SHC- > DH共供方法，在常规脱氢过程中，如Oleflex和Catofin过程，提供改进性能。
