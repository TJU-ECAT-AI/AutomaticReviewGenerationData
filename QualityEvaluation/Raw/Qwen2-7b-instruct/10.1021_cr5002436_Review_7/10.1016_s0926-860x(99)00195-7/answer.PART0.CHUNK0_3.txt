[1] "It is known that conventional dehydrogenation (DH) coupled with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) in a series DH- > SHC- >DH cofed process arrangement gives higher than equlibrium yields of light olefins from the corresponding parafins [14]."
[2] "In this novel redox process arrangement no gaseous oxygen is cofed to the physical mixture of catalysts during the redox process. The sole oxidizing agent for the selective conversion of the in situ generated hydrogen is the lattice oxygen of the SHC catalyst."
[3] "In the first set of experiments, four 130 min redox cycles were performed, followed by regeneration with air. The experimental conditions were 550C, atm press, WHSV 2 h1 and neat propane as feed."
[4] "Unfortunately, this initial favourable performance begins to decline with cycle time. Over the period of 10 consecutive redox cycles, the propylene yield decreases from 48.2% (1st cycle) to 33.0% (10th cycle) (Fig. 4), a decrease of about 2.2%/cycle."
[5] "While the redox cycles could be still further shortened to further curtail the activity decline,it becomes a matter of diminishing returns. A better approach would be to increase the SHC/DH catalyst ratio or to slow down the release of the lattice oxygen of Bi2O3 by chemical means (e.g., doping)."
[6] "Finally, it is surmised that the novel DH + SHC redox process approach discussed in this study will ultimately (i.e., once a sufficiently redox stable SHC catalyst is identified) be preferred over the older DH- > SHC- > DH cofed approach [1,2,4] to improve conventional dehydrogenation processes such as the Oleflex and Catofin processes."

1. The conventional dehydrogenation (DH) coupled with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) process provides higher than equilibrium yields of light olefins from corresponding parafins. In a redox process, no gaseous oxygen is cofed to the physical mixture of catalysts; the lattice oxygen of the SHC catalyst serves as the sole oxidizing agent for the selective conversion of in situ generated hydrogen.

2. In the redox process, four 130-minute redox cycles were conducted, followed by air regeneration. The experiments were carried out at 550°C, atmospheric pressure, a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 2 h^-1, and neat propane as feed.

3. The initial propylene yield was 48.2% in the first cycle, but it declined to 33.0% after 10 consecutive redox cycles, representing a decrease of about 2.2% per cycle.

4. Shortening the redox cycle or increasing the SHC/DH catalyst ratio can mitigate the activity decline. However, a more durable SHC catalyst is needed for the redox process to become practical.

5. The redox process is anticipated to surpass the traditional DH- > SHC- > DH cofed process, improving conventional dehydrogenation processes like Oleflex and Catofin, once a sufficiently stable redox catalyst is identified.

1. 常规脱氢化（DH）与选择性氢燃烧（SHC）过程提供了从相应的烷烃中获得高于平衡的轻烯烃产率。在还原氧化过程中，不向催化剂混合物提供气体氧气；SHC催化剂的晶格氧作为选择性转化原位生成氢的唯一氧化剂。

2. 在还原氧化过程中，进行了四个持续130分钟的循环，随后进行空气再生。实验条件为550°C、大气压、重量小时空间速度（WHSV）为2 h^-1和纯丙烷作为原料。

3. 第一轮循环的丙烯产率为48.2%，但在连续10个还原循环后下降至33.0%，每轮循环约下降2.2%。

4. 缩短还原循环或增加SHC/DH催化剂比例可以减轻活性下降。然而，需要更耐用的SHC催化剂使还原过程成为实际应用。

5. 预期新型的DH + SHC还原氧化过程将超过传统的DH- > SHC- > DH供氧过程，改善常规脱氢化过程，如Oleflex和Catofin，一旦确定了足够稳定的氧化还原催化剂。
