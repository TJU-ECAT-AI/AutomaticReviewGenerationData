[1] "Recently, a series of metal oxides have been identified, e.g., Bi2O3, Bi2Mo3O12, In2O3, In2Mo3O12 and Sb2O4 that convert hydrogen in great preference to light paraffins or olefins, with SHC selectivities in excess of 98% [3,4]."
[2] "The key to the functioning of these selected Bi-, In- and Sb-containing oxides in a DH + SHC redox process is the relatively large amount of lattice oxygen contained in these metal oxides, and the ease and enormous preference with which their lattice oxygen reacts with hydrogen rather than hydrocarbons [3]."
[3] "In the DH + SHC redox process mode, the DH and SHC catalysts are physically intimately mixed in a single reactor (Fig. 1) and the lattice oxygen [O]L of SHC catalyst is the sole oxidant for the combustion of the in situ produced hydrogen coming from the dehydrogenation reaction of the paraffin, catalyzed by the DH component."
[4] "Unfortunately, this initial favourable performance begins to decline with cycle time. Over the period of 10 consecutive redox cycles, the propylene yield decreases from 48.2% (1st cycle) to 33.0% (10th cycle) (Fig. 4), a decrease of about 2.2%/cycle."

Recent advancements in dehydrogenation technologies, particularly those involving the use of metal oxides like Bi2O3, Bi2Mo3O12, In2O3, In2Mo3O12, and Sb2O4, have been pivotal in enhancing olefin production from paraffins. These catalysts demonstrate high selectivity for hydrogen conversion to light paraffins or olefins, exceeding 98%. Their ability to function efficiently in a redox process, where the lattice oxygen of the selective hydrogen combustion catalyst solely combats the hydrogen generated from the dehydrogenation of paraffins, highlights their effectiveness. However, a significant limitation is the decline in performance over repeated redox cycles due to the loss of active phase dispersion, necessitating the search for more robust catalysts to ensure practicality. The study also suggests that the redox process may eventually surpass traditional cofed approaches in improving conventional dehydrogenation processes like Oleflex and Catofin, once more stable catalysts are identified.

最近，在使用Bi2O3、Bi2Mo3O12、In2O3、In2Mo3O12和Sb2O4等金属氧化物的脱氢技术方面取得了突破，这些技术特别适用于从烷烃转化为轻质烯烃。这些催化剂在将氢转化为轻质烯烃或烷烃时表现出极高的选择性，超过98%。它们在所谓的脱氢+选择性氢燃烧（DH+SHC）的循环过程中表现高效，其中，选择性氢燃烧催化剂的晶格氧是唯一用于消耗由脱氢反应产生的氢的氧化剂。然而，一个主要的限制是，随着重复的循环过程，性能开始下降，导致丙烯产量从第一轮的48.2%下降到第十轮的33.0%，每年下降约2.2%。这主要是由于活性相分散的损失，这要求寻找更耐用的催化剂以确保该过程的实用性。研究还暗示，一旦找到足够稳定的催化剂，新的DH+SHC循环方法最终可能会超越传统的共供方法，改进传统的脱氢过程，如Oleflex和Catofin，以提高其效率、可持续性和工业可行性。
