[1] "When a physical mixture composed of a 0.7 wt.% PtSn-ZSM-5 dehydrogenation (DH) catalyst and a 42 wt.% Bi2O3/SiO2 selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) catalyst is subjected to a DH + SHC redox process operation, it gives substantially higher than equilibrium propylene yields from propane."
[2] "At 540C, atmospheric pressure and WHSV of 2 h1, initial microreactor propylene yields from neat propane are 48.2% at about 90% selectivity, compared to equilibrium olefin yields of 20.0% at about 95% selectivity when only the DH catalyst is used. The overall propylene yield improvement is 140%."
[3] "Although still significantly (i.e., 65%) above equlibrium, the high initial DH + SHC propylene yields are not sustainable and decline from 48.2% (first cycle) to 33.0% (tenth cycle); i.e., 2.1%/cycle."
[4] "Some suggestions are provided. It is surmised that the DH + SHC redox process approach will ultimately (i.e., once a sufficiently redox stable SHC catalyst is identified) be preferred over the DH- > SHC- > DH cofed approach to improve conventional dehydrogenation processes such as the Oleflex and Catofin processes."

Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. These advancements focus on improving efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability. Key technological improvements involve the use of physical mixtures of catalysts for redox processes, where a dehydrogenation (DH) catalyst combines with a selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) catalyst. This combination allows for higher than equilibrium propylene yields from propane. However, limitations arise from the redox stability of the SHC catalyst, leading to a decline in propylene yields over cycles due to the loss of catalyst dispersion. Areas for improvement include identifying a more redox stable SHC catalyst to make the process practical. The DH + SHC redox process is suggested to be preferred over traditional cofed approaches to enhance conventional dehydrogenation processes like Oleflex and Catofin.

近年来，尤其是页岩气产量的激增，对烯烃生产中的脱氢技术发展和采用产生了影响。这些进步侧重于提高效率、可持续性和工业可行性。关键技术改进包括使用催化剂的物理混合物进行氧化还原过程，其中脱氢（DH）催化剂与选择性氢燃烧（SHC）催化剂结合。这种组合允许从丙烷获得高于平衡的丙烯产率。然而，稳定性问题是SHC催化剂的一个限制，导致在循环过程中丙烯产率下降，原因是催化剂分散性的损失。需要改进的领域包括识别一个更稳定的氧化还原SHC催化剂，以使过程实用化。认为新型DH + SHC氧化还原过程方法最终将优于传统的共供过程，以改善传统脱氢过程，如Oleflex和Catofin过程。

[1] "Recently, a series of metal oxides have been identified, e.g., Bi2O3, Bi2Mo3O12, In2O3, In2Mo3O12 and Sb2O4 that convert hydrogen in great preference to light paraffins or olefins, with SHC selectivities in excess of 98% [3,4]."
[2] "The key to the functioning of these selected Bi-, In- and Sb-containing oxides in a DH + SHC redox process is the relatively large amount of lattice oxygen contained in these metal oxides, and the ease and enormous preference with which their lattice oxygen reacts with hydrogen rather than hydrocarbons [3]."
[3] "In the DH + SHC redox process mode, the DH and SHC catalysts are physically intimately mixed in a single reactor (Fig. 1) and the lattice oxygen [O]L of SHC catalyst is the sole oxidant for the combustion of the in situ produced hydrogen coming from the dehydrogenation reaction of the paraffin, catalyzed by the DH component."
[4] "Unfortunately, this initial favourable performance begins to decline with cycle time. Over the period of 10 consecutive redox cycles, the propylene yield decreases from 48.2% (1st cycle) to 33.0% (10th cycle) (Fig. 4), a decrease of about 2.2%/cycle."

Recent advancements in dehydrogenation technologies, particularly those involving the use of metal oxides like Bi2O3, Bi2Mo3O12, In2O3, In2Mo3O12, and Sb2O4, have been pivotal in enhancing olefin production from paraffins. These catalysts demonstrate high selectivity for hydrogen conversion to light paraffins or olefins, exceeding 98%. Their ability to function efficiently in a redox process, where the lattice oxygen of the selective hydrogen combustion catalyst solely combats the hydrogen generated from the dehydrogenation of paraffins, highlights their effectiveness. However, a significant limitation is the decline in performance over repeated redox cycles due to the loss of active phase dispersion, necessitating the search for more robust catalysts to ensure practicality. The study also suggests that the redox process may eventually surpass traditional cofed approaches in improving conventional dehydrogenation processes like Oleflex and Catofin, once more stable catalysts are identified.

最近，在使用Bi2O3、Bi2Mo3O12、In2O3、In2Mo3O12和Sb2O4等金属氧化物的脱氢技术方面取得了突破，这些技术特别适用于从烷烃转化为轻质烯烃。这些催化剂在将氢转化为轻质烯烃或烷烃时表现出极高的选择性，超过98%。它们在所谓的脱氢+选择性氢燃烧（DH+SHC）的循环过程中表现高效，其中，选择性氢燃烧催化剂的晶格氧是唯一用于消耗由脱氢反应产生的氢的氧化剂。然而，一个主要的限制是，随着重复的循环过程，性能开始下降，导致丙烯产量从第一轮的48.2%下降到第十轮的33.0%，每年下降约2.2%。这主要是由于活性相分散的损失，这要求寻找更耐用的催化剂以确保该过程的实用性。研究还暗示，一旦找到足够稳定的催化剂，新的DH+SHC循环方法最终可能会超越传统的共供方法，改进传统的脱氢过程，如Oleflex和Catofin，以提高其效率、可持续性和工业可行性。

The surge in shale gas production has led to a significant shift in the petrochemical industry towards more efficient and sustainable dehydrogenation technologies for olefin production. These advancements focus on improving the yield of light olefins from paraffins through coupling dehydrogenation (DH) with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) processes. Key technological advancements include the identification of metal oxides like Bi2O3, Bi2Mo3O12, In2O3, In2Mo3O12, and Sb2O4 that exhibit high selectivity for hydrogen conversion to light paraffins or olefins, often exceeding 98%. However, despite achieving high initial yields that surpass equilibrium values, the efficiency of these processes declines over time due to the loss of dispersion of the SHC catalyst components, specifically Bi2O3, on the SiO2 support structure. This loss of dispersion is attributed to the intense redox cycling involved in the process. The development of more redox-stable SHC catalysts is essential to overcome this limitation and enhance the overall efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation processes. Once a sufficiently stable SHC catalyst is identified, the DH + SHC redox process is anticipated to surpass traditional DH- > SHC- > DH cofed methods, offering improved performance in conventional dehydrogenation processes such as the Oleflex and Catofin processes.

石油天然气产量的增长推动了聚合物生产行业向更高效和可持续的脱氢技术转变，以实现从烷烃到轻质烯烃的转化。这些进步集中在通过结合脱氢（DH）与选择性氢燃烧（SHC）过程来提高烷烃转化为轻质烯烃的产率上。关键的技术进步包括识别出Bi2O3、Bi2Mo3O12、In2O3、In2Mo3O12和Sb2O4等金属氧化物，它们在氢转换为轻质烷烃或烯烃时表现出极高的选择性，选择性通常超过98%。然而，尽管实现了显著高于平衡值的高初始产率，但随着时间的推移，该效率逐渐下降，从第一次循环的48.2%下降到第十次循环的33.0%，平均每月下降约2.1%。这种下降归因于SHC催化剂成分，尤其是SiO2支持结构上的Bi2O3的分散损失，这是由于强烈的氧化还原循环引起的。确定更多耐氧化还原稳定的SHC催化剂是至关重要的，以克服这一限制，并增强脱氢过程的整体效率、可持续性和工业可行性。一旦找到足够稳定的SHC催化剂，DH + SHC氧化还原过程预计将超越传统的DH- > SHC- > DH共供方法，在常规脱氢过程中，如Oleflex和Catofin过程，提供改进性能。

[2] "In this novel redox process arrangement no gaseous oxygen is cofed to the physical mixture of catalysts during the redox process. The sole oxidizing agent for the selective conversion of the in situ generated hydrogen is the lattice oxygen of the SHC catalyst."
[3] "In the first set of experiments, four 130 min redox cycles were performed, followed by regeneration with air. The experimental conditions were 550C, atm press, WHSV 2 h1 and neat propane as feed."
[4] "Unfortunately, this initial favourable performance begins to decline with cycle time. Over the period of 10 consecutive redox cycles, the propylene yield decreases from 48.2% (1st cycle) to 33.0% (10th cycle) (Fig. 4), a decrease of about 2.2%/cycle."
[5] "While the redox cycles could be still further shortened to further curtail the activity decline,it becomes a matter of diminishing returns. A better approach would be to increase the SHC/DH catalyst ratio or to slow down the release of the lattice oxygen of Bi2O3 by chemical means (e.g., doping)."

1. The conventional dehydrogenation (DH) coupled with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) process provides higher than equilibrium yields of light olefins from corresponding parafins. In a redox process, no gaseous oxygen is cofed to the physical mixture of catalysts; the lattice oxygen of the SHC catalyst serves as the sole oxidizing agent for the selective conversion of in situ generated hydrogen.

2. In the redox process, four 130-minute redox cycles were conducted, followed by air regeneration. The experiments were carried out at 550°C, atmospheric pressure, a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 2 h^-1, and neat propane as feed.

3. The initial propylene yield was 48.2% in the first cycle, but it declined to 33.0% after 10 consecutive redox cycles, representing a decrease of about 2.2% per cycle.

4. Shortening the redox cycle or increasing the SHC/DH catalyst ratio can mitigate the activity decline. However, a more durable SHC catalyst is needed for the redox process to become practical.

5. The redox process is anticipated to surpass the traditional DH- > SHC- > DH cofed process, improving conventional dehydrogenation processes like Oleflex and Catofin, once a sufficiently stable redox catalyst is identified.

1. 常规脱氢化（DH）与选择性氢燃烧（SHC）过程提供了从相应的烷烃中获得高于平衡的轻烯烃产率。在还原氧化过程中，不向催化剂混合物提供气体氧气；SHC催化剂的晶格氧作为选择性转化原位生成氢的唯一氧化剂。

2. 在还原氧化过程中，进行了四个持续130分钟的循环，随后进行空气再生。实验条件为550°C、大气压、重量小时空间速度（WHSV）为2 h^-1和纯丙烷作为原料。

3. 第一轮循环的丙烯产率为48.2%，但在连续10个还原循环后下降至33.0%，每轮循环约下降2.2%。

4. 缩短还原循环或增加SHC/DH催化剂比例可以减轻活性下降。然而，需要更耐用的SHC催化剂使还原过程成为实际应用。

5. 预期新型的DH + SHC还原氧化过程将超过传统的DH- > SHC- > DH供氧过程，改善常规脱氢化过程，如Oleflex和Catofin，一旦确定了足够稳定的氧化还原催化剂。

Answer: The development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production have been influenced by recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production. This has led to a shift towards more efficient and sustainable processes, such as the redox process mode (DH + SHC), which combines dehydrogenation and selective hydrogen combustion. Key technological advancements include the identification of metal oxides like Bi2O3, Bi2Mo3O12, In2O3, In2Mo3O12, and Sb2O4 that exhibit high selectivity in hydrogen combustion, suitable for both redox and cofed processes. Current limitations involve the lack of a redox-stable SHC catalyst, leading to declining propylene yields over multiple cycles due to the loss of catalyst dispersion. Areas for improvement focus on developing more stable catalysts, optimizing redox cycles, and enhancing the overall efficiency of the redox process to match or surpass conventional dehydrogenation methods like Oleflex and Catofin.
