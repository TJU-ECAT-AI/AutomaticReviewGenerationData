[1] "When a physical mixture composed of a 0.7 wt.% PtSn-ZSM-5 dehydrogenation (DH) catalyst and a 42 wt.% Bi2O3/SiO2 selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) catalyst is subjected to a DH + SHC redox process operation, it gives substantially higher than equilibrium propylene yields from propane."
[2] "At 540C, atmospheric pressure and WHSV of 2 h1, initial microreactor propylene yields from neat propane are 48.2% at about 90% selectivity, compared to equilibrium olefin yields of 20.0% at about 95% selectivity when only the DH catalyst is used. The overall propylene yield improvement is 140%."
[3] "Although still significantly (i.e., 65%) above equlibrium, the high initial DH + SHC propylene yields are not sustainable and decline from 48.2% (first cycle) to 33.0% (tenth cycle); i.e., 2.1%/cycle."
[4] "Some suggestions are provided. It is surmised that the DH + SHC redox process approach will ultimately (i.e., once a sufficiently redox stable SHC catalyst is identified) be preferred over the DH- > SHC- > DH cofed approach to improve conventional dehydrogenation processes such as the Oleflex and Catofin processes."

Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. These advancements focus on improving efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability. Key technological improvements involve the use of physical mixtures of catalysts for redox processes, where a dehydrogenation (DH) catalyst combines with a selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) catalyst. This combination allows for higher than equilibrium propylene yields from propane. However, limitations arise from the redox stability of the SHC catalyst, leading to a decline in propylene yields over cycles due to the loss of catalyst dispersion. Areas for improvement include identifying a more redox stable SHC catalyst to make the process practical. The DH + SHC redox process is suggested to be preferred over traditional cofed approaches to enhance conventional dehydrogenation processes like Oleflex and Catofin.

近年来，尤其是页岩气产量的激增，对烯烃生产中的脱氢技术发展和采用产生了影响。这些进步侧重于提高效率、可持续性和工业可行性。关键技术改进包括使用催化剂的物理混合物进行氧化还原过程，其中脱氢（DH）催化剂与选择性氢燃烧（SHC）催化剂结合。这种组合允许从丙烷获得高于平衡的丙烯产率。然而，稳定性问题是SHC催化剂的一个限制，导致在循环过程中丙烯产率下降，原因是催化剂分散性的损失。需要改进的领域包括识别一个更稳定的氧化还原SHC催化剂，以使过程实用化。认为新型DH + SHC氧化还原过程方法最终将优于传统的共供过程，以改善传统脱氢过程，如Oleflex和Catofin过程。
