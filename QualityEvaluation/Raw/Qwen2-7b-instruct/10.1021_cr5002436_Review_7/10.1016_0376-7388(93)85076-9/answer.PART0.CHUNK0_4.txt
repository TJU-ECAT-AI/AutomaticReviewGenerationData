[1] "The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was conducted in a comparatively low-temperature range (from 623 to 723 K) using a hydrogen-permeable membrane reactor."
[2] "An Al,O,-supported platinum catalyst exhibited high activity compared with a commercial CrzO,-A1zO3 catalyst in a conventional flow reactor."
[3] "In the membrane reactor, however, the platinum catalyst gave a lower yield of isobutene than the Crz03-AlzO, catalyst, although the isobutene yields on both of these catalysts were high compared with thermodynamic equilibrium values attained in a conventional reactor."
[4] "The yield of isobutene in the membrane reactor increased by the addition of tin to Pt/AlZ03, due to the suppression of coke formation."

The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was explored under low-temperature conditions (623 to 723 K) within a hydrogen-permeable membrane reactor. An Al2O3-supported platinum catalyst showed higher reactivity than a commercial Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst in a traditional flow reactor. However, in the membrane reactor, the platinum catalyst resulted in a lower yield of isobutene compared to the Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst. Yet, adding tin to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst led to an increase in isobutene yield due to the reduction of coke formation.

在623至723 K的低温条件下，通过氢渗透膜反应器对异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯进行了研究。以Al2O3为支持体的铂催化剂在传统的流化床反应器中的活性高于商业化的Cr2O3-Al2O3催化剂。然而，在膜反应器中，铂催化剂的异丁烯产率低于Cr2O3-Al2O3催化剂。然而，向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加锡导致异丁烯产率增加，原因是减少了焦炭的形成。
