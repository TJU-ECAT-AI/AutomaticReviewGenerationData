[1] "The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was conducted in a comparatively low-temperature range (from 623 to 723 K) using a hydrogen-permeable membrane reactor."
[2] "An Al2O3-supported platinum catalyst exhibited high activity compared with a commercial Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst in a conventional flow reactor."
[3] "In the membrane reactor, however, the platinum catalyst gave a lower yield of isobutene than the Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst, although the isobutene yields on both of these catalysts were high compared with thermodynamic equilibrium values attained in a conventional reactor."
[4] "The yield of isobutene in the membrane reactor increased by the addition of tin to Pt/Al2O3, due to the suppression of coke formation."

The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was studied under low temperatures (623 to 723 K) using a hydrogen-permeable membrane reactor. A platinum catalyst supported on Al2O3 showed higher activity than a commercial Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst in a conventional flow reactor. However, in the membrane reactor, the platinum catalyst had a lower yield of isobutene compared to the Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst. Adding tin to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increased the yield of isobutene due to the suppression of coke formation.

在623到723 K的低温下，通过使用氢渗透膜反应器，进行了异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯的研究。Al2O3支持的铂催化剂在常规流动反应器中的活性高于商业Cr2O3-Al2O3催化剂。然而，在膜反应器中，铂催化剂的异丁烯产率低于Cr2O3-Al2O3催化剂。向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加锡增加了异丁烯的产率，这是由于抑制了焦炭形成。
