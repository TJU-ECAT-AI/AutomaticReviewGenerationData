[1] "The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was conducted in a comparatively low-temperature range (from 623 to 723 K) using a hydrogen-permeable membrane reactor."
[2] "An Al,O,-supported platinum catalyst exhibited high activity compared with a commercial CrzO,-A1zO3 catalyst in a conventional flow reactor."
[3] "In the membrane reactor, however, the platinum catalyst gave a lower yield of isobutene than the Crz03-AlzO, catalyst, although the isobutene yields on both of these catalysts were high compared with thermodynamic equilibrium values attained in a conventional reactor."
[4] "The yield of isobutene in the membrane reactor increased by the addition of tin to Pt/AlZ03, due to the suppression of coke formation."

The study investigated the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene in a low-temperature range using a hydrogen-permeable membrane reactor. The Al,O,-supported platinum catalyst showed higher activity than a commercial CrzO,-A1zO3 catalyst in a conventional flow reactor. However, the platinum catalyst yielded less isobutene compared to the Crz03-AlzO, catalyst in the membrane reactor. The addition of tin to the Pt/AlZ03 catalyst increased the isobutene yield by inhibiting coke formation.

研究在较低温度范围内，使用氢渗透膜反应器对异丁烷进行脱氢制异丁烯。Al,O,-支持的铂催化剂在常规流动反应器中的活性高于商业CrzO,-A1zO3催化剂。然而，在膜反应器中，铂催化剂的异丁烯产率低于Crz03-AlzO,催化剂。向Pt/AlZ03催化剂中添加锡增加了异丁烯产率，抑制了焦炭形成。
