[1] "The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was conducted in a comparatively low-temperature range (from 623 to 723 K) using a hydrogen-permeable membrane reactor."
[2] "An Al,O,-supported platinum catalyst exhibited high activity compared with a commercial CrzO,-A1zO3 catalyst in a conventional flow reactor."
[3] "In the membrane reactor, however, the platinum catalyst gave a lower yield of isobutene than the Crz03-AlzO, catalyst, although the isobutene yields on both of these catalysts were high compared with thermodynamic equilibrium values attained in a conventional reactor."
[4] "The yield of isobutene in the membrane reactor increased by the addition of tin to Pt/AlZ03, due to the suppression of coke formation."

The study discusses the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene using a hydrogen-permeable membrane reactor. It highlights that an Al,O-supported platinum catalyst showed higher activity than a commercial CrzO-AlzO catalyst in a conventional flow reactor. However, the yield of isobutene was lower in the membrane reactor using the platinum catalyst compared to the Crz03-AlzO catalyst. Adding tin to the platinum-alumina catalyst increased the isobutene yield by suppressing coke formation.

研究探讨了使用氢渗透膜反应器进行异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯。它强调，支持在Al,O上的铂催化剂在常规流动反应器中的活性比商业化的CrzO-AlzO催化剂更高。然而，在膜反应器中使用铂催化剂的异丁烯产率低于Crz03-AlzO催化剂。向铂-氧化铝催化剂中添加锡增加了异丁烯产率，通过抑制焦炭形成。
