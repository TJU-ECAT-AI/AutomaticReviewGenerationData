[1] "The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was conducted in a comparatively low-temperature range (from 623 to 723 K) using a hydrogen-permeable membrane reactor."
[2] "An Al2O3-supported platinum catalyst exhibited high activity compared with a commercial Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst in a conventional flow reactor."
[3] "In the membrane reactor, however, the platinum catalyst gave a lower yield of isobutene than the Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst, although the isobutene yields on both of these catalysts were high compared with thermodynamic equilibrium values attained in a conventional reactor."
[4] "The yield of isobutene in the membrane reactor increased by the addition of tin to Pt/Al2O3, due to the suppression of coke formation."

The study discussed the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene using a hydrogen-permeable membrane reactor. It compared an Al2O3-supported platinum catalyst with a commercial Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst in a conventional flow reactor. The platinum catalyst showed high activity but gave a lower yield of isobutene in the membrane reactor compared to the Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst. Adding tin to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increased the yield of isobutene due to the suppression of coke formation.

The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was studied under low temperatures (623 to 723 K) using a hydrogen-permeable membrane reactor. A platinum catalyst supported on Al2O3 showed higher activity than a commercial Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst in a conventional flow reactor. However, in the membrane reactor, the platinum catalyst had a lower yield of isobutene compared to the Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst. Adding tin to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increased the yield of isobutene due to the suppression of coke formation.

The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was explored under low-temperature conditions (623 to 723 K) within a hydrogen-permeable membrane reactor. An Al2O3-supported platinum catalyst showed higher reactivity than a commercial Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst in a traditional flow reactor. However, in the membrane reactor, the platinum catalyst resulted in a lower yield of isobutene compared to the Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst. Yet, adding tin to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst led to an increase in isobutene yield due to the reduction of coke formation.
