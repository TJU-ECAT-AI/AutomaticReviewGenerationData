[1] "The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was conducted in a comparatively low-temperature range (from 623 to 723 K) using a hydrogen-permeable membrane reactor."
[2] "An Al2O3-supported platinum catalyst exhibited high activity compared with a commercial Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst in a conventional flow reactor."
[3] "In the membrane reactor, however, the platinum catalyst gave a lower yield of isobutene than the Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst, although the isobutene yields on both of these catalysts were high compared with thermodynamic equilibrium values attained in a conventional reactor."
[4] "The yield of isobutene in the membrane reactor increased by the addition of tin to Pt/Al2O3, due to the suppression of coke formation."

The study discussed the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene using a hydrogen-permeable membrane reactor. It compared an Al2O3-supported platinum catalyst with a commercial Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst in a conventional flow reactor. The platinum catalyst showed high activity but gave a lower yield of isobutene in the membrane reactor compared to the Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst. Adding tin to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increased the yield of isobutene due to the suppression of coke formation.

研究讨论了在氢渗透膜反应器中进行异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯的过程。比较了Al2O3负载的铂催化剂与传统流化床反应器中的商业Cr2O3-Al2O3催化剂。铂催化剂表现出高活性，但在膜反应器中的异丁烯产率低于Cr2O3-Al2O3催化剂。向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加锡增加了异丁烯的产率，原因是抑制了焦炭的形成。
