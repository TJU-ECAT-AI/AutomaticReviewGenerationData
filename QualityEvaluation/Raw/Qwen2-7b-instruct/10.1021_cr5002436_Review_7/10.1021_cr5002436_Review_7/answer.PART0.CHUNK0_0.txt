[1] "Because of their widespread use as feedstock in the chemical industry, the demand for olefins is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future."
[2] "Additionally, the recent surge in shale gas production has rendered the cost of natural gas very economical as compared to that of crude oil."
[3] "Therefore, alternative methods for obtaining olefins, dehydrogenation and MTO, have become very competitive relative to more traditional methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking."
[4] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years."
[5] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
[6] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."

The recent surge in shale gas production has made natural gas economically viable compared to crude oil, leading to an increased demand for olefins in the chemical industry. This has resulted in the development of alternative methods for olefin production, such as dehydrogenation and MTO, which have become competitive alternatives to traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. Many new PDH projects have been announced recently. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still require improvements, including reducing noble metal loading, increasing catalyst stability, and enhancing energy efficiency. There is a need to address the limited equilibrium conversion and side reactions at high temperatures associated with these processes.

近期页岩气产量的增长使得天然气在经济性上与原油相比更具优势，这推动了化学工业对烯烃的需求。这导致了替代方法，如裂解和MTO，成为与传统方法（如流化催化裂化和蒸汽裂解）竞争的生产烯烃方式。近年来，许多新的PDH项目被宣布。然而，当前的裂解技术仍然需要改进，包括减少贵金属负载、提高催化剂稳定性以及提升裂解过程的能量效率。需要解决的是这些过程在高温下有限的平衡转化率和副反应问题。
