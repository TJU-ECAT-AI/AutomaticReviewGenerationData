[1] "Because of their widespread use as feedstock in the chemical industry, the demand for olefins is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future."
[2] "Additionally, the recent surge in shale gas production has rendered the cost of natural gas very economical as compared to that of crude oil."
[3] "Therefore, alternative methods for obtaining olefins, dehydrogenation and MTO, have become very competitive relative to more traditional methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking."
[4] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years."
[5] "The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts."
[6] "These catalysts and technologies have been advanced to a point where the reaction can be run continuously for several years."
[7] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
[8] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
[9] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[10] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
[11] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
[12] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
[13] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen."
[14] "Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic."
[15] "Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system."
[16] "It is very important to heed the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration in industrial settings."
[17] "Indeed, for both the Pt and the CrOx formulations used industrially, the elimination of coke from the surface of the spent catalysts may result in irreversible catalyst deactivation if the regeneration conditions are not carefully controlled."
[18] "Currently, this is done in a very crude manner, by monitoring the gas composition at the reactor outlet."
[19] "However, recent reports suggest that in the near future, operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control."
[20] "Indeed, Raman/UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor noninvasively the amount and type of coke as the latter forms and accumulates on the catalyst surface."
[21] "As is shown in Figure 33, spatiotemporal differences in the coke deposition on a catalyst bed consisting of CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates were visualized in a pilot scale reactor using two UVvis probes, which collected spectra in a continuous fashion during propane dehydrogenation."
[22] "Coke deposition was observed to occur faster at the top of the catalyst bed, which was attributed to the temperature gradient measured in the reactor."
[23] "Furthermore, coke combustion proceeded in an inhomogeneous fashion, coke at the top of the catalyst bed being combusted first."
[24] "These measurements show that the duration of the dehydrogenation and regeneration phases could be dynamically adjusted to keep the catalyst in its most active state."
[25] "As an additional advantage, UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor the long-term irreversible deactivation of the catalyst."
[26] "Indeed, because the relative amounts of active chromia and of chromium that has become irreversibly deactivated due to its migration into the support can be measured by UVvis spectroscopy, this technique provides a means to determine when the catalyst needs replacing."
[27] "This analysis has been taken a step further by designing, constructing, and testing probes for operando Raman spectroscopy, which were used to obtain information on the chemical nature of the coke deposits formed during reaction."
[28] "Furthermore, by using the operando UVvis spectra as a measure for catalyst darkening, a quantitative analysis of the coke deposits could be performed during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction by operando Raman spectroscopy."
[29] "Therefore, the monitoring of industrial chromiaalumina catalysts by combined time-resolved UVvis and Raman spectroscopies can be employed to improve the overall efficiency of future alkane dehydrogenation processes."

Answer: 
1. Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have significantly influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. The cost of natural gas has become very economical compared to crude oil, making alternative methods like dehydrogenation and MTO more competitive against traditional methods such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. This has led to numerous new projects, employing catalysts like CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex), which have been advanced to allow continuous operation for several years. However, current dehydrogenation technologies face limitations and require improvements in reducing noble metal loading, increasing catalyst stability, and enhancing energy efficiency. Efforts are needed to address issues such as limited equilibrium conversion and side reactions at high temperatures.

2. Despite receiving attention, alternative catalysts like GaOx, MoOx, and VOx have not yet provided a practical alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems. These alternatives deactivate quickly due to coke deposition and lack full recoverability through regeneration steps. Research is ongoing to develop suitable combinations of catalyst materials and oxidizing agents for oxidative dehydrogenation, aiming to overcome thermodynamic limitations and maintain high olefin selectivity. Solid oxygen carriers, noble metals, and membrane systems are alternative solutions being explored to improve efficiency and sustainability.

Answer: 
1. The recent economic factors, including the surge in shale gas production, have significantly impacted the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. With natural gas becoming more economically viable compared to crude oil, alternative methods such as dehydrogenation and methanol-to-olefins (MTO) have become increasingly competitive. This has resulted in numerous new projects utilizing catalysts like chromium oxide/alumina (Catofin) or platinum-silver/alumina (Oleflex), which have advanced to enable continuous operation for several years. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still have room for improvement, requiring efforts to reduce noble metal usage, enhance catalyst stability, and optimize energy efficiency. Addressing challenges like limited equilibrium conversion and side reactions at high temperatures is crucial.

2. While alternative catalysts, such as gallium oxide, molybdenum oxide, and vanadium oxide, have received considerable attention in recent decades, a practical alternative to the platinum-silver and chromium oxide systems has yet to emerge. These alternatives deactivate rapidly due to coke deposition and lack full recoverability through regeneration steps. Further research is essential to develop catalyst materials and oxidizing agents that can effectively address the thermodynamic limitations of oxidative dehydrogenation, ensuring high olefin selectivity while minimizing side reactions.

1. 近期经济因素，尤其是页岩气产量的激增，对烯烃生产中的裂解技术的发展和采用产生了重大影响。与传统的裂化方法（如催化裂化和蒸汽裂化）相比，天然气成本大幅降低，使得替代方法如裂解和甲醇到烯烃（MTO）变得更具竞争力。这导致了许多新项目的实施，采用了铬氧化铝（Catofin）或铂银氧化铝（Oleflex）等催化剂，这些催化剂已发展到可以连续运行数年。然而，当前的裂解技术仍存在改进空间，需要努力减少贵金属的使用量、提高催化剂稳定性，并优化裂解过程的能效。解决有限平衡转化率和高温下出现的副反应等问题至关重要。

2. 尽管在过去的几十年里，镓氧化物、钼氧化物和钒氧化物等替代催化剂受到了大量关注，但迄今为止仍未开发出一种可行的替代铂银和铬氧化物系统的技术。这些替代方案由于焦炭沉积快速且无法通过再生步骤完全恢复活性而迅速失效。进一步的研究对于开发能够有效解决氧化裂解的热力学限制、确保高烯烃选择性并减少高温下发生的副反应的催化剂材料和氧化剂至关重要。
