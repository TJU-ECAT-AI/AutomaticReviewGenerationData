[7] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
[8] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[9] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
[10] "Nevertheless, advancements can also be expected in other areas."
[11] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
[12] "Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."
[13] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2 → H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol−1))."
[14] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
[15] "However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2 → H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol−1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
[16] "Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
[17] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
[18] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
[19] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen."
[20] "Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic."
[21] "Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system."
[22] "This approach allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product."
[23] "A large variety of membranes have been investigated, such as Pd-coated mesoporous alumina, PtAg composites, and membranes involving either molybdenum- or carbon-based molecular sieves."
[24] "The inverse relationship between permeability and selectivity of the membranes is a serious problem, as both qualities are desired."
[25] "Catalyst deactivation represents an additional challenge, as coke deposition increases when the hydrogen partial pressure drops."
[26] "Nevertheless, nearly all studies report increased olefin yields when a membrane system is used."
[27] "It is very important to heed the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration in industrial settings."
[28] "Indeed, for both the Pt and the CrOx formulations used industrially, the elimination of coke from the surface of the spent catalysts may result in irreversible catalyst deactivation if the regeneration conditions are not carefully controlled."
[29] "Currently, this is done in a very crude manner, by monitoring the gas composition at the reactor outlet."
[30] "However, recent reports suggest that in the near future, operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control."
[31] "Indeed, Raman/UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor noninvasively the amount and type of coke as the latter forms and accumulates on the catalyst surface."
[32] "As is shown in Figure 33, spatiotemporal differences in the coke deposition on a catalyst bed consisting of CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates were visualized in a pilot scale reactor using two UVvis probes, which collected spectra in a continuous fashion during propane dehydrogenation."
[33] "Coke deposition was observed to occur faster at the top of the catalyst bed, which was attributed to the temperature gradient measured in the reactor."
[34] "Furthermore, coke combustion proceeded in an inhomogeneous fashion, coke at the top of the catalyst bed being combusted first."
[35] "These measurements show that the duration of the dehydrogenation and regeneration phases could be dynamically adjusted to keep the catalyst in its most active state, as moderate amounts of coke are believed to assist the dehydrogenation reaction while excessive amounts lead to catalyst deactivation."
[36] "As an additional advantage, UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor the long-term irreversible deactivation of the catalyst."
[37] "Indeed, because the relative amounts of active chromia and of chromium that has become irreversibly deactivated due to its migration into the support can be measured by UVvis spectroscopy, this technique provides a means to determine when the catalyst needs replacing."
[38] "This analysis has been taken a step further by designing, constructing, and testing probes for operando Raman spectroscopy, which were used to obtain information on the chemical nature of the coke deposits formed during reaction."
[39] "Furthermore, by using the operando UVvis spectra as a measure for catalyst darkening, a quantitative analysis of the coke deposits could be performed during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction by operando Raman spectroscopy."
[40] "Therefore, the monitoring of industrial chromiaalumina catalysts by combined time-resolved UVvis and Raman spectroscopies can be employed to improve the overall efficiency of future alkane dehydrogenation processes."

[26] "It is very important to heed the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration in industrial settings."
[27] "Indeed, for both the Pt and the CrOx formulations used industrially, the elimination of coke from the surface of the spent catalysts may result in irreversible catalyst deactivation if the regeneration conditions are not carefully controlled."
[28] "Currently, this is done in a very crude manner, by monitoring the gas composition at the reactor outlet."
[29] "However, recent reports suggest that in the near future, operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control."
[30] "Indeed, Raman/UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor noninvasively the amount and type of coke as the latter forms and accumulates on the catalyst surface."
[31] "As is shown in Figure 33, spatiotemporal differences in the coke deposition on a catalyst bed consisting of CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates were visualized in a pilot scale reactor using two UVvis probes, which collected spectra in a continuous fashion during propane dehydrogenation."
[32] "Coke deposition was observed to occur faster at the top of the catalyst bed, which was attributed to the temperature gradient measured in the reactor."
[33] "Furthermore, coke combustion proceeded in an inhomogeneous fashion, coke at the top of the catalyst bed being combusted first."
[34] "These measurements show that the duration of the dehydrogenation and regeneration phases could be dynamically adjusted to keep the catalyst in its most active state."
[35] "As an additional advantage, UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor the long-term irreversible deactivation of the catalyst."
[36] "Indeed, because the relative amounts of active chromia and of chromium that has become irreversibly deactivated due to its migration into the support can be measured by UVvis spectroscopy, this technique provides a means to determine when the catalyst needs replacing."
[37] "This analysis has been taken a step further by designing, constructing, and testing probes for operando Raman spectroscopy, which were used to obtain information on the chemical nature of the coke deposits formed during reaction."
[38] "Furthermore, by using the operando UVvis spectra as a measure for catalyst darkening, a quantitative analysis of the coke deposits could be performed during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction by operando Raman spectroscopy."
[39] "Therefore, the monitoring of industrial chromiaalumina catalysts by combined time-resolved UVvis and Raman spectroscopies can be employed to improve the overall efficiency of future alkane dehydrogenation processes."

1. Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil, leading to a higher demand for olefins. This has increased the competitiveness of alternative methods like dehydrogenation and MTO over traditional methods such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. Dozens of new PDH projects have been announced, employing catalysts like CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex), indicating advancements in technology that allow for continuous operation for several years. However, there is still room for improvement in dehydrogenation technologies, focusing on reducing noble metal loading, increasing catalyst stability, and enhancing energy efficiency. High temperatures also present challenges with limited equilibrium conversion and side reactions.

2. Alternative catalysts, including metal oxides, have received attention but have not yet provided a practical alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems. These alternatives deactivate quickly due to coke deposition and inability to fully recover through regeneration, necessitating further research to address these issues.

3. Oxidative dehydrogenation offers advantages over non-oxidative methods, as an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, achieving full conversion of paraffins. Oxygen, whether as O2 or CO2, can serve as an oxidizing agent. While O2 eliminates coke deposition, CO2 is less reactive but maintains endothermicity. CO2 can lead to additional coke deposition or gasification, and competes for surface adsorption on catalyst materials, affecting their performance.

4. Solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, can selectively oxidize hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction. Noble metals like Pt and Au can catalyze the SHC process with oxygen cofeed for hydrogen combustion. However, these metal oxides regenerate with oxygen frequently and exhibit low reaction rates, with some being highly toxic.

5. Membrane systems are used to remove hydrogen from the reaction mixture, shifting equilibrium towards desired olefin products. Various membranes, such as Pd-coated mesoporous alumina, PtAg composites, and molybdenum- or carbon-based molecular sieves, have been investigated. The inverse relationship between permeability and selectivity poses a challenge, requiring careful design to balance both qualities.

6. Regeneration of catalysts in dehydrogenation processes is crucial to maintain efficiency. Current methods, like monitoring gas composition at the reactor outlet, are rudimentary. Advanced techniques, such as operando spectroscopy, are expected to provide more sophisticated control in the future. Raman/UVvis spectroscopy can monitor the formation and accumulation of coke on catalyst surfaces, allowing dynamic adjustment of dehydrogenation and regeneration phases. UVvis spectroscopy also enables monitoring of long-term irreversible deactivation of catalysts, providing insights for timely replacement.

7. Operando Raman spectroscopy has been designed and tested to visualize the chemical nature of coke deposits during reactions, offering a quantitative analysis of coke deposits through operando UVvis spectra. Combined time-resolved UVvis and Raman spectroscopies can improve the overall efficiency of future alkane dehydrogenation processes by monitoring industrial chromiaalumina catalysts.

1. 最近的经济因素，特别是页岩气产量的激增，使得天然气与石油相比变得更加经济实惠，从而导致了对烯烃需求的持续增长。这使得替代方法如裂解和MTO相对于传统方法如流化催化裂化和蒸汽裂化更具竞争力。近年来宣布了数十个新的PDH项目，采用CrOx/Al2O3（Catofin）或PtSn/Al2O3（Oleflex）催化剂，表明技术进步允许连续运行数年。然而，裂解技术仍然存在改进空间，需要降低贵金属负载、提高催化剂稳定性，并提升裂解过程的能量效率。高温也带来了挑战，包括有限的平衡转化率和高温下的副反应。

2. 替代催化剂，尤其是金属氧化物，虽然在过去几十年里受到了关注，但尚未找到一种可行的替代PtSn和CrOx系统的方法。这些替代品由于焦炭沉积速度过快且无法通过再生步骤完全恢复活性而快速失效，需要进一步研究来解决这些问题。

3. 氧化裂解在热力学限制方面优于非氧化裂解，因为氧化剂燃烧反应产生的氢气，可以实现烷烃的完全转换。氧气（O2）或二氧化碳（CO2）均可作为氧化剂使用。虽然氧气消除了焦炭沉积，二氧化碳则保持了吸热性。二氧化碳可能导致额外的焦炭沉积或气体化，并与反应混合物中的碳氢化合物竞争表面吸附，影响催化剂性能。

4. 固体氧载体，如CeO2、SbO4、In2O3、WO3、PbOx、Tl2O3和BiO3，可以通过选择性氧化反应过程中生成的氢气。像Pt和Au这样的贵金属可以在提供氧气的情况下催化SHC过程，促进氢气燃烧。然而，这些金属氧化物需要频繁用氧气再生，反应速率相对较低，部分具有高度毒性。

5. 膜系统用于从反应器中去除氢气，将平衡转移到所需的烯烃产品。各种膜，如Pd涂层的介孔氧化铝、PtAg复合材料以及钼基或碳基分子筛膜，已经被研究。渗透性和选择性之间的反比关系是一个挑战，需要仔细设计以平衡这两种品质。

6. 在裂解过程中的催化剂再生至关重要，以维持效率。当前的方法，如监测反应器出口的气体组成，是粗放的。先进的技术，如原位光谱法，有望在未来提供更高级别的控制。Raman/UVvis光谱可以监测催化剂表面上焦炭的形成和积累，允许动态调整裂解和再生阶段的时间。UVvis光谱也可以监测催化剂的长期不可逆失活，提供及时更换催化剂的依据。

7. 为了可视化反应过程中形成的焦炭的化学性质，已经设计并测试了原位拉曼光谱探针。通过原位UVvis光谱可以进行焦炭沉积的定量分析。结合时间分辨的UVvis和拉曼光谱技术可以改善未来烷烃裂解过程的整体效率，通过监测工业氧化铝催化剂。
