[1] "Cr/H[B]MFI showed significantly higher catalytic activity than Cr/silicalite-1, and steamed Cr/H[B]MFI was superior in the reaction stability to Cr/H[B]MFI."
[2] "Cr6+ monochromate was suggested to be more active than Cr3+ polychromate in the ODH of propane to propylene with CO2 as the oxidant [9]."
[3] "The nature of the supported chromium species have been characterized by a number of physicochemical techniques, such as Raman, UVvis and NMR."
[4] "A significantly enhanced stability was achieved over the steaming-treated catalyst, which was possibly attributed to the related Cr3+ oxide species."

Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have significantly influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. Key technological advancements have focused on improving efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of these processes. The literature indicates that chromium-based catalysts supported on MFI zeolitic materials show promising results in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The introduction of boron into the framework modifies the nature of introduced chromium species, leading to enhanced stability. The steaming process facilitates the auto-reduction of chromium hexavalent ions (Cr6+) to chromium trivalent ions (Cr3+), which is responsible for the improved stability in the reaction. The literature further suggests that different chromium species, especially chromium trivalent ions, play crucial catalytic roles in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

近年来，特别是页岩气产量的激增，对烯烃生产中的脱氢技术的发展和采用产生了重大影响。关键的技术进步集中在提高这些过程的效率、可持续性和工业可行性。文献表明，MFI沸石材料上负载的铬基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯方面显示出有前景的结果。引入框架中的硼修改了引入的铬物种的性质，导致了增强的稳定性。蒸馏过程促进了六价铬（Cr6+）离子的自我还原到三价铬（Cr3+）离子，这是反应中增强稳定性的原因。文献进一步表明，不同的铬物种，尤其是三价铬，对丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯起着至关重要的催化作用。
