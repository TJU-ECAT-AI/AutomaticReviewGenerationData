The research focuses on preparing chromium-supported catalysts over silicalite-1 and borosilicate H[B]MFI to investigate their catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using CO2 as the oxidant. The study demonstrates that chromium-loaded catalysts effectively transform isobutane to isobutylene, which can serve as a feedstock for methyl tert-butyl ether. Additionally, the research highlights that coke formation and the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ contribute to the deactivation of dehydrogenation catalysis.

研究重点是制备铬支持催化剂，包括硅酸铝和硼硅酸盐H[B]MFI，以测试它们在使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的丙烷脱氢反应中的催化活性。研究表明，含铬催化剂能够有效地将异丁烷转化为异丁烯，后者可以作为甲基叔丁基醚的原料。此外，研究指出，焦炭的形成以及六价铬向三价铬的还原是导致脱氢催化失活的原因。
