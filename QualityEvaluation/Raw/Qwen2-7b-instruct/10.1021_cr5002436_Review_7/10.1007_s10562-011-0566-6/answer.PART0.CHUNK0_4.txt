[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene has received considerable attention as an alternative reaction route to meet the increasing demand for propylene, which is mainly produced by the steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [1]."
[2] "The use of zeolitic materials as the supports for the catalyst preparation has recently attracted much attention. The availability of a wide range of topologies (more than 190 presently), the strong hydrothermal stability, various and readily-modified surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) and their unique micropore environments provide great potentials for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for the catalytic reactions."
[3] "It is well known that the coke formation and reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ are responsible for the deactivation of dehydrogenation catalysis [24]."
[4] "Moreover, steaming is an efficient method for reducing Brnsted acidity in the zeolites, and the resulting decrease in acidic sites might contribute to the enhanced reaction stabilities."

The surge in shale gas production has led to an increase in the supply of raw materials for olefin production, driving the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies. Key technological advancements include the use of zeolitic materials as supports for catalyst preparation, which offer advantages such as wide range of topologies, strong hydrothermal stability, and customizable surface properties. These materials enable the stabilization of transition metal complexes, crucial for catalytic reactions. The process faces challenges such as coke formation and the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+, which can deactivate the catalyst. Steaming treatments improve reaction stabilities by reducing Brnsted acidity in zeolites, decreasing acidic sites, and enhancing overall efficiency.
