[1] "In the present study, we have prepared Cr supported catalysts over silicalite-1 (MFI topology) and borosilicate H[B]MFI, and tested their catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using CO2 as the oxidant."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene has received considerable attention as an alternative reaction route to meet the increasing demand for propylene, which is mainly produced by the steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [1]."
[3] "The use of zeolitic materials as the supports for the catalyst preparation has recently attracted much attention. The availability of a wide range of topologies (more than 190 presently), the strong hydrothermal stability, various and readily-modified surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) and their unique micropore environments provide great potentials for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for the catalytic reactions."
[4] "For the synthesis of silicalite-1, no boron source was used. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement confirmed the typical MFI topology with high crystallinities for the samples (not shown)."
[5] "Moreover, no crystallites of chromium oxide phase were visible by the XRD, indicating the well dispersion of Cr species."
[6] "We observed no significant change after the catalysts were used for the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with CO2."
[7] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was investigated over a series of chromium-based catalysts supported on MFI zeolitic materials."
[8] "According to UVvis, Raman and H2-TPR, the steaming process resulted in auto-reduction of some Cr6+ to Cr3+ on Cr/H[B]MFI."
[9] "A significantly enhanced stability was achieved over the steaming-treated catalyst, which was possibly attributed to the related Cr3+ oxide species."

Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have significantly influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. Shale gas production has led to an abundance of ethane, a key feedstock for olefin production. This has prompted industries to explore and adopt dehydrogenation technologies to convert ethane into olefins, especially propylene, which is in high demand. Key technological advancements include the use of advanced catalysts with improved selectivity and stability, optimized reaction conditions, and efficient reactor designs to enhance the efficiency of dehydrogenation processes. Current limitations include the high energy consumption associated with the dehydrogenation process, the formation of byproducts, and the potential for catalyst deactivation over time. Areas for improvement focus on developing more sustainable catalysts, optimizing energy use, and minimizing byproduct formation. These advancements aim to increase the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation processes in olefin production.
