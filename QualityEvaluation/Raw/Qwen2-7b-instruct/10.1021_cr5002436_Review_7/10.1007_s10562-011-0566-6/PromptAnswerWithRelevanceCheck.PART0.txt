The development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production have been influenced by recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production. This has led to the exploration of alternative routes for olefin production, such as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene. Key technological advancements in this area include the use of specific catalysts, such as chromium-based catalysts supported on MFI zeolitic materials, which have been optimized for improved activity and stability. The introduction of boron into the framework of these materials modifies the nature of the chromium species, enhancing the catalytic performance. Steaming treatment has been found to be an effective method for reducing the Brnsted acidity of the zeolites, contributing to enhanced reaction stability. These developments aim to improve the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation processes.

Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have significantly influenced the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production. Key technological advancements have focused on improving efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of these processes. The literature indicates that chromium-based catalysts supported on MFI zeolitic materials show promising results in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The introduction of boron into the framework modifies the nature of introduced chromium species, leading to enhanced stability. The steaming process facilitates the auto-reduction of chromium hexavalent ions (Cr6+) to chromium trivalent ions (Cr3+), which is responsible for the improved stability in the reaction. The literature further suggests that different chromium species, especially chromium trivalent ions, play crucial catalytic roles in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
