The development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production have been influenced by recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production. This has led to the exploration of alternative routes for olefin production, such as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene. Key technological advancements in this area include the use of specific catalysts, such as chromium-based catalysts supported on MFI zeolitic materials, which have been optimized for improved activity and stability. The introduction of boron into the framework of these materials modifies the nature of the chromium species, enhancing the catalytic performance. Steaming treatment has been found to be an effective method for reducing the Brnsted acidity of the zeolites, contributing to enhanced reaction stability. These developments aim to improve the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of dehydrogenation processes.
