1. Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have increased the interest in dehydrogenation technologies for olefin production. The growing demand for propylene relative to ethylene for plastic production has fueled this interest. Technological advancements include the development of operando UV-Vis spectroscopy for real-time monitoring of catalyst performance under industrial conditions.

2. UV-Vis spectroscopy is used continuously during the reaction to monitor coke deposition on the catalyst. This allows researchers to track the formation and removal of coke during the dehydrogenation and oxidation-regeneration cycles.

3. Coke formation during the dehydrogenation step is faster at the top of the reactor compared to the bottom, where the process is more gradual. This indicates spatial variations in the reaction rates across the catalyst bed.

4. Coke combustion is significantly faster at the top of the reactor, taking only 30 minutes, whereas it requires 3 hours at the bottom. This finding suggests that coke combustion occurs as a front traveling through the reactor bed over time.

5. The researchers acknowledge Avantes for designing and providing the UV-Vis probes that were crucial for conducting the experiments.

1. 近期的经济因素，特别是页岩气产量的增长，增加了对用于生产烯烃的脱氢技术的兴趣。聚丙烯相对于乙烯在塑料生产中的需求增长刺激了这一兴趣。技术进步包括开发原位紫外-可见光谱法，以实时监测工业条件下的催化剂性能。

2. 在反应过程中连续收集紫外-可见光谱来监控催化剂上的焦炭沉积。这允许研究人员跟踪脱氢和氧化再生周期中焦炭的形成和去除。

3. 脱氢步骤中焦炭形成的速度在反应器顶部比底部快得多，底部的沉积过程较为缓慢。这表明催化剂床层上存在空间差异的反应速率。

4. 反应器顶部的焦炭燃烧只需30分钟即可完成，而底部则需要3小时。这表明焦炭燃烧以一个前向从反应器床层移动。

5. 研究人员感谢Avantes设计并提供了关键的紫外-可见光探针。

[2] "This process is of renewed interest due to the recent boom in shale gas exploitation and the increasing demand for propylene relative to ethylene for the production of plastics."
[3] "UV-Vis spectroscopy has frequently been used to study chromia/alumina catalysts under alkane dehydrogenation conditions on the lab-scale."
[4] "dd transitions of chromium oxide species can be observed as broad bands in the UV-Vis spectra; Cr6+ species present bands at around 273 and 366 nm, while Cr3+ species typically display absorption bands at around 300, 452, 588 and 616 nm."
[5] "Cr3+ species are proposed to be the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction, while Cr6+ is considered to be inactive."
[6] "High reaction temperatures and low pressures used for the dehydrogenation reaction are optimal conditions for coke formation, which can be followed over time."
[7] "Despite the fact that coke species do not present absorption bands, their formation can be observed indirectly by UV-Vis as the formation of coke leads to darkening of the catalyst and as a consequence an overall increase of the UV-Vis absorption of the catalyst material."
[8] "Furthermore, during the oxidation-regeneration step, the locally generated heat by coke burning may play a role in the incorporation of active Cr3+ species in the alumina support by migration or entrapment via aluminium oxide sintering."
[9] "By comparing Fig. 2a and b we can correlate the changes in selectivity and conversion with the temperature fluctuations within the reactor; an increase in temperature from 550 to 575 °C results in a drop in selectivity from 80 to 60%."
[10] "This finding is corroborated by the heat released during combustion as measured at different points in time by the three thermocouples (Fig. S5, ESI)."
[11] "In a related experiment, the reaction was halted after one hour of dehydrogenation to examine the individual CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates. It was clear that the few extrudates measured by the UV-Vis probe during the reaction were representative of that height of the reactor."
