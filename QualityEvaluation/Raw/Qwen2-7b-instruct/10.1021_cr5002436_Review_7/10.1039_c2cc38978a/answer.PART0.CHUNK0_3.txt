[2] "This process is of renewed interest due to the recent boom in shale gas exploitation and the increasing demand for propylene relative to ethylene for the production of plastics."
[3] "UV-Vis spectroscopy has frequently been used to study chromia/alumina catalysts under alkane dehydrogenation conditions on the lab-scale."
[4] "dd transitions of chromium oxide species can be observed as broad bands in the UV-Vis spectra; Cr6+ species present bands at around 273 and 366 nm, while Cr3+ species typically display absorption bands at around 300, 452, 588 and 616 nm."
[5] "Cr3+ species are proposed to be the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction, while Cr6+ is considered to be inactive."
[6] "High reaction temperatures and low pressures used for the dehydrogenation reaction are optimal conditions for coke formation, which can be followed over time."
[7] "Despite the fact that coke species do not present absorption bands, their formation can be observed indirectly by UV-Vis as the formation of coke leads to darkening of the catalyst and as a consequence an overall increase of the UV-Vis absorption of the catalyst material."
[8] "Furthermore, during the oxidation-regeneration step, the locally generated heat by coke burning may play a role in the incorporation of active Cr3+ species in the alumina support by migration or entrapment via aluminium oxide sintering."
[9] "By comparing Fig. 2a and b we can correlate the changes in selectivity and conversion with the temperature fluctuations within the reactor; an increase in temperature from 550 to 575 °C results in a drop in selectivity from 80 to 60%."
[10] "This finding is corroborated by the heat released during combustion as measured at different points in time by the three thermocouples (Fig. S5, ESI)."
[11] "In a related experiment, the reaction was halted after one hour of dehydrogenation to examine the individual CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates. It was clear that the few extrudates measured by the UV-Vis probe during the reaction were representative of that height of the reactor."

The recent surge in shale gas production has led to increased interest in dehydrogenation technologies for olefin production. The growing demand for propylene relative to ethylene in plastic manufacturing has driven this interest. Key technological advancements include the use of UV-Vis spectroscopy for real-time monitoring of catalyst performance and coke formation. However, the process faces limitations such as rapid deactivation of supported chromia catalysts due to coke formation at high temperatures and pressures. The study also highlights the potential role of coke combustion in the regeneration of active Cr3+ species on alumina supports. Temperature fluctuations within the reactor impact the selectivity and conversion rates of the dehydrogenation process, affecting overall efficiency. Further research is needed to enhance catalyst stability, improve temperature control, and optimize the dehydrogenation process for greater efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability.
