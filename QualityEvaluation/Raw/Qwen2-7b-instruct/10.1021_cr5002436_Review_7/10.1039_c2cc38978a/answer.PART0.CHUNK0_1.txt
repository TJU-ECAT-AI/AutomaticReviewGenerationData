[1] "This process is of renewed interest due to the recent boom in shale gas exploitation and the increasing demand for propylene relative to ethylene for the production of plastics."
[2] "UV-Vis spectra have been collected continuously during the reaction in order to monitor coke deposition."
[3] "The formation of coke during the dehydrogenation step is faster at the top of the reactor as compared to the bottom where coke deposition is a gradual process."
[4] "At the top of the reactor the coke is readily combusted within 30 min, while this process requires 3 h for the bottom part of the reactor."
[5] "This finding is corroborated by the heat released during combustion as measured at different points in time by the three thermocouples (Fig. S5, ESI)."

The recent surge in shale gas production has increased the interest in dehydrogenation technologies, particularly for olefin production. This is because the availability of abundant and inexpensive raw materials has made the production of propylene more economically viable. The technology advancements focus on improving the efficiency and sustainability of these processes. Current limitations include the rapid formation of coke deposits, which can lead to deactivation of catalysts. Areas for improvement involve better catalyst design, improved reactor design, and operational strategies to mitigate coke formation and enhance propylene yield. These advancements aim to make dehydrogenation processes more efficient, sustainable, and industrially viable.
