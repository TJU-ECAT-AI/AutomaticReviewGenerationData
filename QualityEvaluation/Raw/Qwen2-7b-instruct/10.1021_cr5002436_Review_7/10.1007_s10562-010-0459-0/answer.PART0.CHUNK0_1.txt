[1] "Olefins are a valuable feedstock for the chemical industry and are preferred over alkanes due to their higher reactivity."
[2] "Propylene, for example, forms the basis for important chemicals and products such as polypropylene, oxo alcohols, propylene oxide, acrylic acid, cumene, and many others."
[3] "The main problem that catalysts for the ODH reaction for propane face is how to activate selectively the CH bond in propane without oxidizing the weaker CH bond in propylene or oxidize the reactive double bond."
[4] "However, among the tested catalysts, 10% V2O5/alumina had the highest ratio."
[5] "We investigated the kinetics of the ODH reaction of propane over such catalysts and found a surprisingly high propylene formation rate per gram vanadium at low vanadia loadings and high surface area of the support."
[6] "The addition of niobium to the material reduces the contribution of this reduction peak significantly and also reduces the propane combustion activity."

Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have led to a significant increase in the availability of inexpensive feedstocks for olefin production. This has driven the development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies as an alternative to traditional steam cracking processes. Key technological advancements include the optimization of catalysts, such as vanadium-based catalysts, for more efficient and selective propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). Despite these advancements, current limitations include the challenge of achieving high selectivity in the ODH reaction, especially at higher propane conversions, and maintaining the catalyst's stability over time. Areas for improvement include enhancing the catalyst's activity and selectivity, developing more sustainable production methods, and reducing energy consumption and environmental impact. For instance, the introduction of niobium as a component in the catalyst can reduce propane combustion activity, thus improving the selectivity for propylene production. The use of materials with high surface areas, such as MCM-41, can also enhance the propylene formation rate per gram of vanadium, contributing to more efficient processes.
