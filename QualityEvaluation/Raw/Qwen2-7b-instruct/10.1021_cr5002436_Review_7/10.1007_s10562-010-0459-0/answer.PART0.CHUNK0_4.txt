<p>Vanadium containing catalysts have been intensely investigated for the ODH reaction since the late 1980s (see [24] and references therein).</p>
<p>The main problem that catalysts for the ODH reaction for propane face is how to activate selectively the CH bond in propane without oxidizing the weaker CH bond in propylene or oxidize the reactive double bond.</p>
<p>The addition of niobium to silica gel supported vanadium catalysts only reduces the surface area of the material and therefore reduces the reaction rate (see Table 4 and Fig. 6).</p>
<p>By depositing niobia in a second step the number of these new sites is diminished and high selectivity to propylene is restored at a much higher propylene formation rate per gram vanadium because of the high surface area available for supporting vanadia.</p>

Recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production, have driven interest in developing and adopting dehydrogenation technologies for olefin production. Key advancements include the optimization of catalysts for improved selectivity and efficiency. However, current limitations include maintaining high selectivity at higher propane conversions and overcoming the low selectivity at conversions above 10%. Areas for improvement focus on enhancing catalyst stability, reducing energy consumption, and increasing operational flexibility to accommodate varying feedstock qualities and market demands. The integration of renewable energy sources and the development of more sustainable processes are also critical for future advancements.
