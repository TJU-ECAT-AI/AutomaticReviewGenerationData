[1] "The reaction is exothermic and the potential yield is not thermodynamically limited."
[2] "The main problem that catalysts for the ODH reaction for propane face is how to activate selectively the CH bond in propane without oxidizing the weaker CH bond in propylene or oxidize the reactive double bond."
[3] "We investigated the kinetics of the ODH reaction of propane over such catalysts and found a surprisingly high propylene formation rate per gram vanadium at low vanadia loadings and high surface area of the support."
[4] "Vanadium catalysts have been intensely investigated for the ODH reaction since the late 1980s (see [24] and references therein)."
[5] "We have focused on silica supported vanadia catalysts because of the absence of cracking and deep oxidation reactions observed over this support."

The development and adoption of dehydrogenation technologies in olefin production have been influenced by recent economic factors, particularly the surge in shale gas production. Key technological advancements aim to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of these processes. Challenges include optimizing catalysts for selective activation of the CH bond in propane without oxidizing the weaker CH bond in propylene or the reactive double bond, especially at low vanadia loadings and high surface area supports. Studies have shown that silica-supported vanadia catalysts can achieve a high propylene formation rate per gram vanadium at low loadings, indicating progress in addressing these challenges. Since the late 1980s, vanadium catalysts have been intensively researched for olefin production through dehydrogenation reactions, highlighting ongoing efforts to improve catalyst performance.
