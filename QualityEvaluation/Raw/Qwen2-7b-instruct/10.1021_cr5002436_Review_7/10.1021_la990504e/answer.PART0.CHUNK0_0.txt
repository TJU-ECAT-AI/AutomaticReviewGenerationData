[1] "The presence of chromia in the interlayer region gives rise to the formation of porous materials with high surface areas in which the active phase is well dispersed as nanoparticles between the layers of α-zirconium phosphate. That confers to this catalyst a very high activity in both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions of propane."
[2] "In both series, the initial activity in the DH of propane increases with the chromium content, but it decays due to the deposited carbon which covers the active sites of the catalysts which modify their textural parameters."
[3] "In oxidative conditions, the deactivation process is absent and the activities are comparable to that obtained in other catalytic systems but the performance temperature is very low, only 673 K."

Recent advancements in dehydrogenation technologies, particularly concerning olefin production, have been driven by economic factors including the surge in shale gas production. This has led to increased demand for olefins as feedstocks in chemical production. Technological improvements focus on enhancing the efficiency, sustainability, and industrial viability of these processes. Key advancements include the development of more selective catalysts, optimized reaction conditions, and innovative reactor designs. Challenges remain in addressing limitations such as catalyst deactivation, high energy consumption, and the environmental impact of byproduct formation. Areas for improvement include refining catalyst design to extend activity and stability, exploring renewable energy integration to reduce fossil fuel dependence, and developing more efficient separation techniques to manage byproducts effectively. These efforts aim to balance economic benefits with environmental responsibility, ensuring sustainable growth in the chemical industry.
