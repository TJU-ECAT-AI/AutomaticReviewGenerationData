Understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly over time, with a focus on identifying the mechanisms behind its formation. Challenges associated with coke deposition include reduced catalytic activity and increased energy consumption due to the necessity for frequent regeneration. Strategies to address these challenges include prevention methods, such as modifying the surface chemistry of the catalyst to inhibit coke formation, and the development of novel catalyst designs that incorporate materials with higher thermal stability. Additionally, regeneration techniques have been employed to remove deposited coke and restore catalyst activity. Despite these advancements, remaining obstacles in the field require further research, particularly concerning the optimization of prevention methods and the identification of more efficient regeneration techniques.

The understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly, with coke formation being a critical issue for commercial catalysts. Key challenges include understanding the intricate relationship between coke structure, composition, and location, as well as the kinetics of coke growth. Various strategies to address coke formation involve preventive measures such as cofeeding hydrogen to remove precursors and weaken support acidity, using metal promoters to enhance catalytic properties, and modifying conventional supports to alter acid/base strengths. Novel catalyst designs, particularly the single atom/site strategy and confined subnanosized Pt clusters, have shown promise in reducing coke formation. However, there remains uncertainty in optimizing promoter types and loadings, and the effectiveness of regeneration techniques. Future research is needed to refine catalyst designs, improve coke migration mechanisms, and develop molecular-level models of coke formation kinetics.
