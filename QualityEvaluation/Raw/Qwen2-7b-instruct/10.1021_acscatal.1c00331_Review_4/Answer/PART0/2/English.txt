Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize that the kinetics of coke growth plays a significant role in coke formation. Despite having several models available, none can fully explain the molecular mechanism behind coke formation. Cofeeding hydrogen can help remove the coke precursor and weaken the acidity of the support. Metal promoters, like tin (Sn), can directly adjust the catalytic properties of platinum from both geometric and electronic perspectives, simultaneously increasing activity and stability. Adding substances to conventional alumina support can alter the acid/base strength and facilitate the transfer of coke between metal and support. The successful application of the single atom/site strategy leverages the size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in partial oxidation of hydrocarbons (PDH). Confined subnanosized platinum clusters in zeolites can be deposited at specific positions due to the unique interaction between the catalyst and support, showing exceptional resistance to coke formation. Some strategies, such as lowering regeneration temperatures, can help reduce costs and stabilize activity. Ultimately, the integration of experimental and computational techniques is urgently required to address the complex issue of coke formation in heterogeneous catalysis.
