The understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly, recognizing that the structure, composition, and location of cokes are essential to inhibit their formation. The intricacies of these factors, along with the ongoing debate about coke composition, highlight the complexity of the problem. Cofeeding hydrogen can aid in removing the coke precursor and weakening the acidity of the support. Metal promoters, such as tin (Sn), can directly adjust the catalytic properties of platinum by both geometric and electronic means, enhancing both activity and stability. Adding substances to conventional alumina support can alter the acid/base strength, facilitating the coke transfer between metal and support. The success of the single atom/site strategy demonstrates its clever exploitation of the size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH. Confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolite can be positioned uniquely due to the catalyst-support interaction, exhibiting outstanding resistance to coke formation. While these methods effectively mitigate coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to extend the catalyst's life. Some strategies suggest lowering the regeneration temperature, which is crucial for reducing costs and stabilizing activity. Based on previous studies, three areas are proposed to further reduce the impact of coke: advancing the design of active centers, improving coke migration mechanisms, and investigating coke formation kinetics at the molecular level.
