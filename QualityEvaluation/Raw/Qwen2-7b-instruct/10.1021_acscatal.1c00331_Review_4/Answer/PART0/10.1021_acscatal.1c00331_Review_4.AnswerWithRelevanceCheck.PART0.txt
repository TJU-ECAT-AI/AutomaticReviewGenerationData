          The understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly, with coke formation being a critical issue for commercial catalysts. Key challenges include understanding the intricate relationship between coke structure, composition, and location, as well as the kinetics of coke growth. Various strategies to address coke formation involve preventive measures such as cofeeding hydrogen to remove precursors and weaken support acidity, using metal promoters to enhance catalytic properties, and modifying conventional supports to alter acid/base strengths. Novel catalyst designs, particularly the single atom/site strategy and confined subnanosized Pt clusters, have shown promise in reducing coke formation. However, there remains uncertainty in optimizing promoter types and loadings, and the effectiveness of regeneration techniques. Future research is needed to refine catalyst designs, improve coke migration mechanisms, and develop molecular-level models of coke formation kinetics.

          Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize that the kinetics of coke growth plays a significant role in coke formation. Despite having several models available, none can fully explain the molecular mechanism behind coke formation. Cofeeding hydrogen can help remove the coke precursor and weaken the acidity of the support. Metal promoters, like tin (Sn), can directly adjust the catalytic properties of platinum from both geometric and electronic perspectives, simultaneously increasing activity and stability. Adding substances to conventional alumina support can alter the acid/base strength and facilitate the transfer of coke between metal and support. The successful application of the single atom/site strategy leverages the size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in partial oxidation of hydrocarbons (PDH). Confined subnanosized platinum clusters in zeolites can be deposited at specific positions due to the unique interaction between the catalyst and support, showing exceptional resistance to coke formation. Some strategies, such as lowering regeneration temperatures, can help reduce costs and stabilize activity. Ultimately, the integration of experimental and computational techniques is urgently required to address the complex issue of coke formation in heterogeneous catalysis.

          The understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly, recognizing that the structure, composition, and location of cokes are essential to inhibit their formation. The intricacies of these factors, along with the ongoing debate about coke composition, highlight the complexity of the problem. Cofeeding hydrogen can aid in removing the coke precursor and weakening the acidity of the support. Metal promoters, such as tin (Sn), can directly adjust the catalytic properties of platinum by both geometric and electronic means, enhancing both activity and stability. Adding substances to conventional alumina support can alter the acid/base strength, facilitating the coke transfer between metal and support. The success of the single atom/site strategy demonstrates its clever exploitation of the size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH. Confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolite can be positioned uniquely due to the catalyst-support interaction, exhibiting outstanding resistance to coke formation. While these methods effectively mitigate coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to extend the catalyst's life. Some strategies suggest lowering the regeneration temperature, which is crucial for reducing costs and stabilizing activity. Based on previous studies, three areas are proposed to further reduce the impact of coke: advancing the design of active centers, improving coke migration mechanisms, and investigating coke formation kinetics at the molecular level.
