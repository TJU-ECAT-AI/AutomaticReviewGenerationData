        Understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly, with a focus on identifying the mechanisms behind its formation. Challenges associated with coke deposition include reduced catalytic activity and increased energy consumption due to the necessity for frequent regeneration. Strategies to address these challenges include prevention methods, such as modifying the surface chemistry of the catalyst to inhibit coke formation, and the development of novel catalyst designs that incorporate materials with higher thermal stability. Additionally, regeneration techniques have been employed to remove deposited coke and restore catalyst activity. Despite these advancements, remaining obstacles in the field require further research, particularly concerning the optimization of prevention methods and the identification of more efficient regeneration techniques.

        The structure, composition, and location of cokes are the prerequisite to inhibit coke formation. It is revealed that these factors are entangled, and the details regarding coke composition are still under debate. The cofeeding of hydrogen can remove the coke precursor and weaken the acidity of the support. Promoters, such as Sn, directly tune the catalytic properties of Pt from both a geometry and electronic perspective, which simultaneously increase activity and stability. However, the optimal kind and loading of promoter is still not concluded as there is a lack of guiding principle to govern a search. The additive to conventional support alumina can modify the acid/base strength and facilitate the coke transfer between metal and support. New developments of effective catalyst design are also noted. The success of single atom/site strategy wisely exploited the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reaction in PDH. The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation. Although these methods indeed alleviate the coke formation, the regeneration is still needed to prolong the life of the catalyst. Some strategies seem to be useful to lower temperature in regeneration which is important to reduce cost and stabilize activity.

        On the basis of the previous studies, three aspects are proposed to reduce the effect of coke further:
        1. Refine catalyst designs to optimize the balance between activity and stability.
        2. Improve coke migration mechanisms to facilitate more efficient removal during regeneration.
        3. Develop molecular-level models to predict coke formation kinetics accurately.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on refining catalyst designs to achieve a better balance between activity and stability, improving coke migration mechanisms for more efficient removal during regeneration, and developing advanced molecular-level models to predict coke formation kinetics more accurately. These efforts could lead to the creation of more robust and efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation processes.

        理解焦炭沉积在铂基催化剂中的形成机制已经显著发展，重点关注抑制焦炭形成的机制。与焦炭沉积相关的挑战包括由于频繁再生以降低催化活性和能耗的需求而导致的催化剂稳定性降低。为解决这些挑战，采用预防措施，如修改催化剂表面化学以抑制焦炭形成，以及开发具有更高热稳定性的新型催化剂设计来缓解焦炭积聚。此外，通过化学处理去除沉积的焦炭并恢复催化剂活性的再生技术也被实施。尽管取得了这些进展，但该领域的剩余障碍需要进一步研究，特别是关于优化预防措施和识别更高效再生技术的优化。

        焦炭形成的前提是抑制焦炭形成。揭示了这些因素之间的交织关系，而焦炭组成的细节仍在辩论中。氢的共喂养可以去除焦炭前体并减弱支撑物的酸性。Sn等促进剂直接调节Pt的几何和电子特性，同时增加活性和稳定性。然而，促进剂的最优类型和负载量仍没有结论，因为缺乏指导原则来引导搜索。常规支持氧化铝的添加剂可以修改酸/碱强度，并促进金属和支撑物之间的焦炭迁移。新发展的有效催化剂设计也得到了注意。单原子/位点策略的成功巧妙地利用了PDH去氢化和副反应的大小依赖性。在沸石中受限的亚纳米级Pt簇可以以催化剂和支撑物之间的独特相互作用沉积在特定位置，表现出对焦炭形成的出色抵抗力。尽管这些方法确实减轻了焦炭形成，但再生仍然需要延长催化剂的使用寿命。有些策略似乎有助于降低再生温度，这对于减少成本和稳定活性至关重要。

        根据先前的研究，提出了以下三个方面来进一步减少焦炭的影响：
        1. 精细化催化剂设计以优化活动性和稳定性之间的平衡。
        2. 改进焦炭迁移机制以更有效地在再生期间移除。
        3. 开发分子水平模型以准确预测焦炭形成动力学。

        整合理解和前瞻视角：考虑到文件中讨论的先进成果和发现，我们有机会探索新兴领域和创新方法。未来的研究努力可能集中在：
        - 进一步优化催化剂设计，实现活动性和稳定性的更好平衡。
        - 提高再生过程中焦炭迁移机制的效率，以更有效地去除焦炭。
        - 开发高级分子水平模型，以更准确地预测焦炭形成动力学。这些努力可能导致更强大、更高效的催化剂用于丙烷脱氢过程的创建。

        鉴于上述分析，未来的催化剂研究可以聚焦于以下几个方向：
        - **催化剂设计**：优化活性与稳定性的平衡，开发更高效的催化剂结构。
        - **再生技术**：改进焦炭迁移机制，提高再生效率。
        - **分子模型**：建立更精确的分子水平模型，以预测焦炭形成动力学。
        
        通过这些研究方向的深入探索，有望推动催化剂性能的大幅提升，从而提高丙烷脱氢过程的效率和经济性。
