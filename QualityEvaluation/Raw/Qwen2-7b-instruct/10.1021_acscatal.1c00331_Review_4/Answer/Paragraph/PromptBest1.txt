The evolution of our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation has been marked by a deep dive into the underlying mechanisms and the development of strategies to mitigate the challenges it poses. Coke formation, a significant obstacle in industrial processes, affects the stability and efficiency of catalysts through reduced activity and increased energy consumption necessitating frequent regeneration. To address these issues, several approaches have been pursued, including preventive measures like modifying the catalyst surface chemistry to inhibit coke formation, the introduction of novel catalyst designs with enhanced thermal stability, and the implementation of regeneration techniques aimed at removing deposited coke and restoring catalyst activity.

        **Prevention Methods**:
        - **Surface Chemistry Modification**: Adjustments to the catalyst surface can prevent the adsorption and growth of coke precursors, thereby inhibiting coke formation.
        - **Metal Promoters**: Incorporating metals such as Sn into the catalyst matrix can geometrically and electronically tune the catalytic properties of Pt, simultaneously increasing activity and stability.

        **Novel Catalyst Designs**:
        - **Single Atom/ Site Strategy**: This approach exploits the different size dependencies of dehydrogenation and side reactions, leading to more efficient catalysts.
        - **Confined Subnanosized Pt Clusters**: Deposited in zeolites, these clusters benefit from unique interactions between the catalyst and support, exhibiting excellent resistance to coke formation.

        **Regeneration Techniques**:
        - **Chemical Treatments**: These aim to remove deposited coke and restore catalyst activity, although they are still required to prolong the catalyst's life.
        - **Temperature Reduction Strategies**: Some methods have been found to lower the regeneration temperature, which is crucial for reducing costs and stabilizing activity.

        **Remaining Challenges**:
        - **Optimization of Prevention Methods**: Determining the optimal type and loading of metal promoters remains elusive due to the lack of guiding principles.
        - **Efficient Regeneration Techniques**: There is ongoing research to identify more effective regeneration strategies that can sustain catalyst activity without frequent interruptions.

        **Future Directions**:
        - **Refinement of Catalyst Designs**: Further exploration into the precise interactions between catalyst components and their impact on coke formation is necessary.
        - **Development of Molecular-Level Models**: Understanding the kinetic mechanisms of coke growth and migration requires detailed molecular models that can predict and optimize catalyst performance.
        - **Integration of Emerging Technologies**: Combining advanced materials science with innovative processing techniques may lead to breakthroughs in mitigating coke formation and enhancing catalyst longevity.

        Despite these advancements, there are still gaps in our understanding that require further investigation. The future of propane dehydrogenation catalysts hinges on refining existing strategies, identifying new ones, and developing a deeper insight into the complex interplay between coke formation and catalyst performance.

Coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts, a persistent challenge in propane dehydrogenation, involves understanding the mechanisms of its formation, addressing the associated challenges, and advancing catalyst design for enhanced performance and longevity.

        The intricate relationship between coke structure, composition, and location presents key challenges in managing coke deposition.

Prevention strategies, including modifying the catalyst surface chemistry to inhibit coke formation and developing novel catalyst designs with enhanced thermal stability, have been explored \([2]\).

        Incorporating materials with higher thermal stability into catalysts and employing cofeeding of hydrogen to remove coke precursors and weaken support acidity are among the preventive measures. Metal promoters, such as tin (Sn), directly influence the catalytic properties of Pt, balancing activity and stability \([4]\). However, determining the optimal type and loading of promoters remains an open question \([5]\).

        Regeneration techniques, which chemically remove deposited coke to restore catalyst activity, are crucial \([10]\). Lowering the regeneration temperature to reduce costs and stabilize activity \([11]\) is also a focus. On this foundation, three aspects are proposed for further reduction of coke's impact:

        1. **Optimizing Prevention Methods:** Enhancing the effectiveness of surface modification and promoter tuning to more precisely control coke formation.

However, the optimal kind and loading of promoter is still not concluded as there is a lack of guiding principle to govern a search. The additive to conventional support alumina can modify the acid/base strength and facilitate the coke transfer between metal and support. New developments of effective catalyst design are also noted. The success of single atom/site strategy wisely exploited the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reaction in PDH.
