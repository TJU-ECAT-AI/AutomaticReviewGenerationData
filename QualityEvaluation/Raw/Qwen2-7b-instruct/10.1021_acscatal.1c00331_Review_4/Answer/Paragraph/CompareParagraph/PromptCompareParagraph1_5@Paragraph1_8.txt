Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/jp212149c\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4\] and \[10.1021/jp212149c\]. The evolution of understanding about coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts is profound, with a critical focus on elucidating the underlying mechanisms of coke formation. Challenges associated with coke deposition include the reduction in catalytic activity and the increased energy consumption necessitated by frequent regeneration. Strategies to address these challenges include preventive measures aimed at modifying the surface chemistry of the catalyst to inhibit coke formation, as well as the development of novel catalyst designs that incorporate materials with enhanced thermal stability. Additionally, regeneration techniques employing chemical treatments to remove deposited coke have been implemented to restore catalyst activity. Despite these advancements, further research is required to optimize prevention methods and identify more efficient regeneration techniques, especially concerning the precise control of promoter types and loadings, and the development of molecular-level models of coke formation kinetics.

        The structure, composition, and location of cokes are crucial factors in inhibiting their formation. These elements are interrelated, and the specifics regarding coke composition remain a subject of ongoing debate. The cofeeding of hydrogen is a viable method for removing coke precursors and weakening the acidity of the support. Metal promoters, such as Sn, directly influence the geometric and electronic properties of Pt, enhancing catalytic activity and stability simultaneously. However, determining the optimal type and loading of promoter remains an unresolved issue due to the absence of guiding principles for systematic searches. Modifying the conventional support alumina can alter the acid/base strength and facilitate the transfer of coke between the metal and support, leading to new developments in effective catalyst design. The success of the single atom/site strategy exploits the size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), while confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolite can be deposited at specific positions through unique interactions with the catalyst and support, exhibiting exceptional resistance to coke formation. Although these methods alleviate coke formation, regeneration is still essential to prolong catalyst life. Some strategies suggest the potential to lower regeneration temperatures, which is crucial for reducing costs and stabilizing activity. Based on previous studies, three aspects are proposed to further reduce the impact of coke: refining catalyst design, improving coke migration mechanisms, and developing molecular-level models of coke formation kinetics.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on:
        - Enhancing the understanding of coke formation kinetics through molecular-level modeling to predict and prevent coke deposition more effectively.
        - Developing advanced materials and support systems that can dynamically adapt to changing reaction conditions, thereby minimizing coke formation.
        - Optimizing the design of single atom catalysts and nanostructured catalysts to achieve superior stability and activity, specifically tailored for PDH applications.
        - Implementing integrated systems that combine prevention, regeneration, and real-time monitoring to enhance catalyst performance and longevity.
        - Exploring the synergistic effects of multiple strategies, such as combining surface modification, promoter tuning, and support optimization, to create highly efficient and durable catalysts for PDH processes.

Additionally, exploring the integration of machine learning algorithms to predict and optimize catalyst performance under varying operational conditions could provide valuable insights. Future work may also benefit from the development of multifunctional catalysts that combine high activity, stability, and resistance to coke formation in a single system, thus addressing multiple challenges simultaneously.
