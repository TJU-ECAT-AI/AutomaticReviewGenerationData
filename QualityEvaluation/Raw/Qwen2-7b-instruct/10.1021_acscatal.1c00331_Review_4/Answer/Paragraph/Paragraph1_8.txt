Understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly over time, with a focus on identifying the mechanisms behind its formation. Challenges associated with coke deposition include reduced catalytic activity and increased energy consumption due to the necessity for frequent regeneration. Strategies to address these challenges include prevention methods, such as modifying the surface chemistry of the catalyst to inhibit coke formation, and the development of novel catalyst designs that incorporate materials with higher thermal stability. Additionally, regeneration techniques have been employed to remove deposited coke and restore catalyst activity. Despite these advancements, remaining obstacles in the field require further research, particularly concerning the optimization of prevention methods and the identification of more efficient regeneration techniques.
