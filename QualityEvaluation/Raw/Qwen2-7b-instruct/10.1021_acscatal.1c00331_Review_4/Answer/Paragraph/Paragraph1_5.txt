        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/jp212149c\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4\] and \[10.1021/jp212149c\]. The evolution of understanding about coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts is profound, with a critical focus on elucidating the underlying mechanisms of coke formation. Challenges associated with coke deposition include the reduction in catalytic activity and the increased energy consumption necessitated by frequent regeneration. Strategies to address these challenges include preventive measures aimed at modifying the surface chemistry of the catalyst to inhibit coke formation, as well as the development of novel catalyst designs that incorporate materials with enhanced thermal stability. Additionally, regeneration techniques employing chemical treatments to remove deposited coke have been implemented to restore catalyst activity. Despite these advancements, further research is required to optimize prevention methods and identify more efficient regeneration techniques, especially concerning the precise control of promoter types and loadings, and the development of molecular-level models of coke formation kinetics.

        The structure, composition, and location of cokes are crucial factors in inhibiting their formation. These elements are interrelated, and the specifics regarding coke composition remain a subject of ongoing debate. The cofeeding of hydrogen is a viable method for removing coke precursors and weakening the acidity of the support. Metal promoters, such as Sn, directly influence the geometric and electronic properties of Pt, enhancing catalytic activity and stability simultaneously. However, determining the optimal type and loading of promoter remains an unresolved issue due to the absence of guiding principles for systematic searches. Modifying the conventional support alumina can alter the acid/base strength and facilitate the transfer of coke between the metal and support, leading to new developments in effective catalyst design. The success of the single atom/site strategy exploits the size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), while confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolite can be deposited at specific positions through unique interactions with the catalyst and support, exhibiting exceptional resistance to coke formation. Although these methods alleviate coke formation, regeneration is still essential to prolong catalyst life. Some strategies suggest the potential to lower regeneration temperatures, which is crucial for reducing costs and stabilizing activity. Based on previous studies, three aspects are proposed to further reduce the impact of coke: refining catalyst design, improving coke migration mechanisms, and developing molecular-level models of coke formation kinetics.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on:
        - Enhancing the understanding of coke formation kinetics through molecular-level modeling to predict and prevent coke deposition more effectively.
        - Developing advanced materials and support systems that can dynamically adapt to changing reaction conditions, thereby minimizing coke formation.
        - Optimizing the design of single atom catalysts and nanostructured catalysts to achieve superior stability and activity, specifically tailored for PDH applications.
        - Implementing integrated systems that combine prevention, regeneration, and real-time monitoring to enhance catalyst performance and longevity.
        - Exploring the synergistic effects of multiple strategies, such as combining surface modification, promoter tuning, and support optimization, to create highly efficient and durable catalysts for PDH processes.

        基于\[10.1021/jp212149c\]参考文献的深度分析。从\[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4\]和\[10.1021/jp212149c\]的参考文献中获得的综合理解。对Pt基催化剂上焦炭沉积的理解已显著发展，重点是揭示焦炭形成机制。焦炭沉积相关的挑战包括催化剂活性降低和由于频繁再生而增加的能量消耗。为解决这些挑战，采取了预防措施，如通过修改催化剂表面化学以抑制焦炭形成，以及开发了结合更高热稳定性的新材料的新型催化剂设计。此外，实施了通过化学处理去除沉积焦炭并恢复催化剂活性的再生技术。尽管取得了进步，但仍需要进一步研究来优化预防方法和确定更高效的再生技术，特别是关于促进剂类型和装载量的优化以及发展分子水平的焦炭形成动力学模型。

        焦炭的结构、组成和位置是抑制其形成的先决条件。这些因素相互交织，关于焦炭组成的细节仍在辩论中。向系统中注入氢可以清除焦炭前体并削弱支撑物的酸性。例如，Sn等金属促进剂直接从几何和电子角度调整Pt的催化性质，同时提高活性和稳定性。然而，确定促进剂的最佳种类和装载量仍然是未决问题，因为缺乏指导原则来指导搜索。对常规支持氧化铝的修改可以改变酸/碱强度，并促进金属和支撑之间焦炭的转移，从而导致有效催化剂设计的新发展。单原子/位点策略的成功巧妙地利用了PDH中脱氢和副反应的大小依赖性，而被限制在沸石中的亚纳米尺寸的Pt簇可以通过催化剂和支持之间的独特相互作用在特定位置沉积，表现出对焦炭形成出色的抵抗力。虽然这些方法确实减轻了焦炭形成，但再生仍然是延长催化剂寿命的必要步骤。一些策略似乎有助于降低再生温度，这对于降低成本和稳定活性至关重要。基于先前的研究，提出了以下三个方面以进一步减少焦炭的影响：
        - 通过分子级建模增强对焦炭形成动力学的理解，以更有效地预测和防止焦炭沉积。
        - 开发先进的材料和支撑系统，能够动态适应不断变化的反应条件，从而最大限度地减少焦炭形成。
        - 优化单原子催化剂和纳米结构催化剂的设计，针对PDH应用实现优越的稳定性和活性。
        - 实施集成系统，结合预防、再生和实时监控，以增强催化剂性能和寿命。
        - 探索多种策略的协同效应，如结合表面修饰、促进剂调谐和支持优化，创建高度高效且耐用的PDH过程催化剂。
