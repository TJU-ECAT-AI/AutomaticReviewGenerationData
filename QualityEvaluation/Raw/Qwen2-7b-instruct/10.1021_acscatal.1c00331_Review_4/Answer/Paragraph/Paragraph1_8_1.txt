        The evolution of understanding regarding coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has been marked by a deep dive into the mechanisms underlying its formation, with a significant focus on the challenges posed by this phenomenon, including reduced catalytic activity and increased energy consumption necessitating frequent regeneration. To address these challenges, strategies have been developed and refined, encompassing preventive measures such as modifying the surface chemistry of the catalyst to inhibit coke formation, the creation of novel catalyst designs that incorporate materials with enhanced thermal stability, and the implementation of regeneration techniques aimed at removing deposited coke and restoring catalyst activity. 

        However, despite these advancements, the field continues to grapple with several unresolved issues, particularly in optimizing prevention methods and identifying more efficient regeneration techniques. The intricate interplay between coke structure, composition, and location, along with the kinetics of coke growth, remains a complex area of investigation. Promoters like Sn have been found to directly influence the geometric and electronic properties of Pt, simultaneously enhancing activity and stability, but the optimal type and loading of such promoters remain uncertain, lacking a guiding principle for their selection.

        Recent developments in effective catalyst design, such as the single atom/site strategy and the use of confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites, have demonstrated promising results in reducing coke formation. These strategies have exploited the size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), leading to enhanced catalytic performance. Yet, there is still much to be explored, especially in refining catalyst designs, improving coke migration mechanisms, and developing molecular-level models of coke formation kinetics.

Additionally, the integration of in-situ monitoring systems could provide real-time insights into coke formation kinetics, enabling more precise control and intervention strategies. This holistic approach, combining cutting-edge computational modeling, experimental validation, and innovative design principles, holds the key to unlocking the full potential of Pt-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation processes, ensuring their longevity and efficiency in industrial applications.

        对Pt基催化剂上焦炭沉积的理解已经经历了显著的演变，重点在于识别其形成机制，并面对由此带来的挑战，包括催化活性降低和能耗增加，导致催化剂需要频繁再生。为应对这些挑战，已开发并完善了多种策略，包括通过修改催化剂表面化学来抑制焦炭形成的方法、设计具有更高热稳定性的新型催化剂以及实施清除沉积焦炭并恢复催化剂活性的再生技术。

        尽管取得了进展，但该领域仍面临着一些未解决的问题，特别是优化预防措施和确定更高效再生技术的有效性。焦炭结构、组成和位置之间的复杂关系，以及焦炭生长动力学的了解，仍然是研究的热点。例如，锡等促进剂已被发现能够直接调节Pt的几何和电子性质，同时提高活性和稳定性，但最佳类型及其负载量尚未明确，缺乏指导原则来指导其选择。

        最近，单原子/位点策略和在沸石中受限的纳米级Pt簇等有效催化剂设计的发展显示出了减少焦炭形成的可能性。这些策略利用了PDH中的去氢化和副反应对大小的依赖性，提高了催化性能。然而，还有更多工作需要做，特别是在改进催化剂设计、优化焦炭迁移机制以及发展分子水平的焦炭形成动力学模型方面。
