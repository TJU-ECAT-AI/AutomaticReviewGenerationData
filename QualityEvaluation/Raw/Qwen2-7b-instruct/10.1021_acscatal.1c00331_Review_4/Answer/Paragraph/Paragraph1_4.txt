        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/jp212149c\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4\] and \[10.1021/jp212149c\]. Coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts is a multifaceted challenge in propane dehydrogenation processes, affecting both stability and efficiency. This phenomenon, characterized by the accumulation of carbonaceous deposits (cokes), has seen significant advancements in understanding mechanisms, developing mitigation strategies, and enhancing catalyst design for improved performance and longevity.

        The core challenges associated with coke deposition include reduced catalytic activity, increased energy consumption necessitating frequent regeneration, and the intricate relationship between coke structure, composition, and location. Prevention methods, such as modifying the surface chemistry of the catalyst to inhibit coke formation, have been explored. Novel catalyst designs incorporating materials with enhanced thermal stability have also been developed to mitigate coke buildup. Regeneration techniques, employing chemical treatments to remove deposited coke, have been implemented to restore catalyst activity, albeit requiring further optimization for efficiency and cost reduction.

        The integration of hydrogen cofeeding, promoter tuning (e.g., tin), and support modification to alter acid/base strengths are pivotal strategies aimed at reducing coke formation. Promising approaches include the single atom/site strategy and the deposition of confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites, which exhibit excellent resistance to coke formation. However, there remains uncertainty in optimizing promoter types and loadings, highlighting the need for systematic studies to govern the search.

        Future research endeavors should focus on refining catalyst designs, improving coke migration mechanisms, and developing molecular-level models of coke formation kinetics. The success of these strategies will depend on a deeper understanding of the underlying chemistry and physics governing coke deposition and its impact on catalyst performance.
