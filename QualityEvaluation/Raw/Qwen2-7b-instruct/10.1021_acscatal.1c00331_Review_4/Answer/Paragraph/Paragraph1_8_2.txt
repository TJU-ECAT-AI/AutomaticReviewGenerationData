        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/jp212149c], synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4]. The evolution of understanding regarding coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has been profound, focusing on elucidating the mechanisms behind its formation. Challenges associated with coke deposition include the reduction of catalytic activity and increased energy consumption necessitating frequent regeneration. Strategies addressing these challenges encompass preventive methods, such as modifying the surface chemistry of the catalyst to inhibit coke formation, and the development of novel catalyst designs incorporating materials with enhanced thermal stability. Moreover, regeneration techniques employing chemical treatments to remove deposited coke have been implemented to restore catalyst activity. Despite these advancements, remaining obstacles in the field require further research, particularly concerning the optimization of prevention methods and the identification of more efficient regeneration techniques.
