        Detailed analysis has been conducted to understand the mechanisms of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts, highlighting the significant challenges they pose in industrial processes, particularly in terms of reduced catalytic activity and increased energy consumption necessitating frequent regeneration. The evolution of understanding in this area has led to the exploration of various strategies aimed at addressing these challenges, including prevention methods that involve modifying the surface chemistry of the catalyst to inhibit coke formation, novel catalyst designs that incorporate materials with enhanced thermal stability, and the implementation of regeneration techniques to remove deposited coke and restore catalyst activity. Despite these advancements, there remain several obstacles that require further investigation, particularly in optimizing prevention methods and identifying more efficient regeneration techniques.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Based on the comprehensive insights provided in the referenced studies, there is an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies that can further advance the field of propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Future research endeavors might focus on developing a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between coke structure, composition, and location, and the kinetics of coke growth. Innovations in catalyst design, such as the refinement of single atom/site strategies and the utilization of confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites, show promise in mitigating coke formation. Moreover, there is a need to optimize the use of promoters and additives in conventional supports to better control acid/base strengths and facilitate coke migration. Addressing the remaining uncertainties surrounding the optimal types and loadings of promoters, as well as enhancing regeneration techniques, holds the key to improving catalyst performance and longevity. Future studies should also aim to develop molecular-level models of coke formation kinetics to provide a more nuanced understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving coke deposition.
