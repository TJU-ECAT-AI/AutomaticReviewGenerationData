        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/jp212149c\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4\] and \[10.1021/jp212149c\]. Understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly over time, with coke formation being a critical issue for commercial catalysts. Challenges associated with coke deposition include reduced catalytic activity and increased energy consumption due to the necessity for frequent regeneration. Strategies to address these challenges include prevention methods, such as modifying the surface chemistry of the catalyst to inhibit coke formation, and the development of novel catalyst designs that incorporate materials with higher thermal stability. Additionally, regeneration techniques have been employed to remove deposited coke and restore catalyst activity. Despite these advancements, remaining obstacles in the field require further research, particularly concerning the optimization of prevention methods and the identification of more efficient regeneration techniques.

        The structure, composition, and location of cokes are the prerequisite to inhibit coke formation, as revealed by molecular dynamics simulation studies on graphene growth on Ni(111) surfaces. These factors are entangled, and the details regarding coke composition are still under debate. Cofeeding hydrogen can remove the coke precursor and weaken the acidity of the support. Promoters, such as Sn, directly tune the catalytic properties of Pt from both a geometry and electronic perspective, which simultaneously increase activity and stability. However, the optimal kind and loading of promoter is still not concluded as there is a lack of guiding principle to govern a search. The additive to conventional support alumina can modify the acid/base strength and facilitate the coke transfer between metal and support. New developments of effective catalyst design are also noted. The success of single atom/site strategy wisely exploits the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reaction in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular positions with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibits excellent resistance to coke formation.

        Although these methods indeed alleviate the coke formation, the regeneration is still needed to prolong the life of the catalyst. Some strategies seem to be useful to lower temperature in regeneration, which is important to reduce cost and stabilize activity. On the basis of the previous studies, three aspects are proposed to reduce the effect of coke further: refining catalyst designs, improving coke migration mechanisms, and developing molecular-level models of coke formation kinetics.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing more precise models of coke formation kinetics, optimizing promoter selection and loading, and enhancing regeneration techniques to achieve more efficient and sustainable propane dehydrogenation processes.

        理解了在Pt基催化剂中焦炭沉积的形成机制，这一过程对于商业催化剂来说是一个关键问题。焦炭沉积所引起的挑战包括降低催化活性和因频繁再生而增加的能量消耗。为解决这些问题，采用的方法包括通过修改催化剂表面化学以抑制焦炭形成来预防沉积，以及开发具有更高热稳定性的新型催化剂设计以减轻焦炭积累。此外，通过化学处理去除沉积的焦炭并恢复催化剂活性的再生技术也被实施。尽管取得了这些进展，但该领域仍需要进一步研究，特别是关于优化预防措施和识别更高效再生技术的优化策略。

        焦炭的结构、组成和位置是抑制焦炭形成的前提条件，这是通过Ni(111)表面上的石墨烯生长的分子动力学模拟研究揭示的。这些因素相互交织，关于焦炭组成的细节仍在争论中。向系统中添加氢可以去除焦炭前体并削弱支撑物的酸性。例如，锡（Sn）等促进剂直接调节铂的几何和电子性质，同时提高活性和稳定性。然而，确定最佳的促进剂类型和负载仍然是一个悬而未决的问题，因为缺乏指导原则来引导搜索。向常规支持氧化铝中添加的添加剂可以改变酸/碱强度，并促进金属和支撑物之间的焦炭迁移。新发展了有效的催化剂设计。单原子/位点策略的成功巧妙地利用了丙烷脱氢（PDH）中去氢化和副反应在大小依赖性上的差异。在沸石中的受限亚纳米尺寸的Pt簇可以在催化剂和支撑物之间独特的相互作用下沉积在特定位置，展现出对焦炭形成的出色抵抗性。

        尽管这些方法确实减轻了焦炭形成，但再生仍然需要延长催化剂的使用寿命。有些策略似乎有助于降低再生温度，这对于减少成本和稳定活性非常重要。基于先前的研究，提出了三个方面进一步减少焦炭影响：细化催化剂设计、改善焦炭迁移机制和开发焦炭形成动力学的分子水平模型。

        综合理解和未来展望：考虑到文件中讨论的进步和发现，我们有机会探索新兴领域和创新方法。未来的研究努力可能集中在发展更精确的焦炭形成动力学模型、优化促进剂选择和负载以及增强再生技术上，以实现更高效和可持续的丙烷脱氢过程。
