Coke deposition is a critical concern in the operation of Pt-based catalysts across various industrial applications, including the petroleum refining sector and the production of chemical intermediates. This phenomenon involves the formation of solid carbon deposits on the surface of the catalyst, which can significantly reduce its activity and shorten its operational lifespan. The understanding of coke deposition mechanisms is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies and advancing catalyst design to ensure improved performance and longevity.

The primary mechanisms leading to coke deposition involve the adsorption of hydrocarbon molecules onto the catalyst surface, followed by their conversion into coke precursors under high-temperature conditions. These precursors then undergo a series of chemical reactions to form coke, which physically blocks the active sites on the catalyst, impairing its ability to catalyze desired chemical reactions efficiently. The extent and rate of coke deposition depend on several factors, including the type of feedstock, operating conditions (such as temperature and pressure), and the specific properties of the catalyst material.

To address the issue of coke deposition, researchers and engineers have developed a range of mitigation strategies. These include optimizing the operating conditions to prevent the formation of coke precursors, modifying the catalyst composition to enhance its resistance to coke buildup, and employing advanced catalyst designs that facilitate easier coke removal during regeneration processes. Additionally, there is ongoing work aimed at creating catalysts with enhanced stability against coke formation, incorporating additives or modifying the catalyst structure to improve its selectivity and efficiency in converting feedstocks without the unwanted side effect of coke production.

Advancing catalyst design is another key area of focus in this field. This involves not only improving the physical properties of the catalyst, such as its surface area and porosity, but also enhancing its chemical functionality. Researchers are exploring new materials and synthesis methods to create catalysts that can withstand harsh operating environments, degrade coke more effectively, and maintain high activity over extended periods. By combining insights from mechanistic studies with innovative materials science, it is hoped that these efforts will lead to the development of Pt-based catalysts with significantly improved performance and longevity, thereby contributing to more sustainable and efficient industrial processes.
