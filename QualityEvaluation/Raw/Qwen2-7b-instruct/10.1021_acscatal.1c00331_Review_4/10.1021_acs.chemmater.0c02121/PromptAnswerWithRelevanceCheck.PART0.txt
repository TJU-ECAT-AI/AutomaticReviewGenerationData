Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly over time, focusing on the control of defect formation during the growth process. Challenges associated with this phenomenon include the minimization of defect formation, improving the quality of the grown graphene, and restoring catalyst activity through regeneration techniques. Various strategies, such as optimizing growth conditions, utilizing catalysts, and developing new growth techniques, have been implemented to address these challenges effectively. Prevention methods aim to reduce defects, while novel catalyst designs enhance the growth process. Regeneration techniques are essential for maintaining continuous growth processes.
