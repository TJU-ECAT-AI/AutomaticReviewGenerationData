The document highlights the use of kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations, fed with first-principles parameters, to directly simulate the graphene growth process. These simulations allow for a deep understanding of the growth mechanisms. Specifically, they can identify the dominant kinetic pathways, such as the role of carbon dimers or hydrogen atoms in the growth process. Moreover, the simulations can reproduce experimental kinetic data, like the quintic-like growth behavior on Ir(111), and provide a means to theoretically design optimized growth protocols for high-quality graphene production.
