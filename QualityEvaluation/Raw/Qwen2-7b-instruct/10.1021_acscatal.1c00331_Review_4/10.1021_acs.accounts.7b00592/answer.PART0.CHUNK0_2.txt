Understanding the growth mechanism of graphene has significantly evolved with advancements in atomistic simulations. The primary challenge lies in the complexity of the growth process, which involves numerous elementary steps. To address this, researchers have employed explicit simulations of graphene growth, utilizing first-principles parameters. These simulations have helped elucidate the dominant kinetic pathways, such as the role of carbon dimers and hydrogen in the growth process. They also allow for a direct comparison with experimental kinetic data, validating the mechanisms and providing insights into the growth behaviors on various substrates. Furthermore, atomistic simulations offer a means to theoretically design growth protocols, enabling the prediction and optimization of key experimental parameters.
