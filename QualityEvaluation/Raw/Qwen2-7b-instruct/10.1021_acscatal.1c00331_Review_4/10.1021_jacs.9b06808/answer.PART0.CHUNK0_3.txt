1. Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize it as a significant factor causing a decline in both activity and selectivity. Various strategies to address this issue include prevention methods, which involve modifying the catalyst structure or surface chemistry to minimize coke formation; novel catalyst designs that aim to improve the intrinsic stability of Pt-based catalysts against coke buildup; and regeneration techniques focused on restoring catalytic activity by removing deposited coke.
