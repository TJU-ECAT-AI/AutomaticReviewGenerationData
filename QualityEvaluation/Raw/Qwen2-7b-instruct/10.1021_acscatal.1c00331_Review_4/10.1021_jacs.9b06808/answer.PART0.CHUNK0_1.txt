High-Loading Single-Atom/Cluster Catalysts: The understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize its significant impact on catalytic performance due to irreversible adsorption on the catalyst surface. Challenges include preventing coke formation through modified catalyst structures and designing new catalysts with high loading of single atoms or clusters. Regeneration techniques, employing thermal or chemical treatments, aim to remove coke but their effectiveness varies across different catalysts. Ongoing research is crucial to optimize these strategies for various applications.

高负载单原子/簇催化剂：对铂基催化剂中焦炭沉积的理解已经发展到认识到它对催化性能的影响，主要是由于焦炭在催化剂表面不可逆吸附。主要挑战在于通过修改催化剂结构来防止焦炭形成，并设计具有高负载单原子或簇的新催化剂。再生技术通过热处理或化学处理来去除焦炭，但其有效性因不同催化剂而异。对于不同的应用，进一步的研究是关键以优化这些策略。
