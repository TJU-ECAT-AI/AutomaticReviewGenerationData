How has our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts evolved, what are the primary challenges associated with this phenomenon, and how do various strategies - including prevention methods, novel catalyst designs, and regeneration techniques - address these challenges, while also considering their effectiveness and the remaining obstacles that require further research in this field?

Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly, focusing on the challenges of stability, selectivity, and activity loss over time. Prevention methods, such as the use of additives and catalyst design modifications, along with regeneration techniques, have been explored to mitigate these issues. Novel catalyst designs aim to reduce coke formation by altering the structure or composition of the catalyst. Regeneration techniques, involving thermal or chemical treatments, restore the catalyst's properties. However, the effectiveness of these strategies varies, and more research is required to optimize their performance. Remaining obstacles include a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind coke formation and the development of more efficient and sustainable solutions.
