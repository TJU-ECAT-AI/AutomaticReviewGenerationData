The understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly. The primary challenge is the formation of coke, which leads to decreased catalyst activity and stability over time. Various strategies, including prevention methods, novel catalyst designs, and regeneration techniques, address these challenges. Prevention methods focus on altering the catalyst structure or composition to reduce coke formation. Novel catalyst designs involve creating materials with improved resistance to coke buildup. Regeneration techniques aim to restore catalyst activity after periods of use. While these strategies show promise, they face obstacles such as the need for more efficient and selective methods to prevent coke formation and a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of wet-chemistry strong metal-support interactions.
