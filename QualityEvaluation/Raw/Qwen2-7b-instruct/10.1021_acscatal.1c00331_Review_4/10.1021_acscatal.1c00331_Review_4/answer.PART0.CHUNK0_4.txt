4. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To In summary, coke deposition is a crucial issue for the commercial Pt-based catalysts, and many efforts have been made to understand and alleviate the detrimental effects. The structure, composition, and location of cokes are the prerequisite to inhibit coke formation. It is revealed that these factors are entangled, and the details regarding coke composition are still under debate. The kinetics of coke growth has an apparent importance for coke formation. Although there are several models available, none of them could resolve the mechanism at the molecular level. The cofeeding gas, metal promoter, and support modification are the verified effective methods to prevent coke formation. The cofeeding of hydrogen can remove the coke precursor and weaken the acidity of the support. Furthermore, hydrogens also aggregate the degree of coke graphitization which requires a higher regeneration temperature. The promoters, such as Sn, directly tune the catalytic properties of Pt from both a geometry and electronic perspective, which simultaneously increase activity and stability. However, the optimal kind and loading of promoter is still not concluded as there is a lack of guiding principle to govern a search. The additive to conventional support alumina can modify the acid/base strength and facilitate the coke transfer between metal and support. New developments of effective catalyst design are also noted. The success of single atom/site strategy wisely exploited the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reaction in PDH. The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation. Although these methods indeed alleviate the coke formation, the regeneration is still needed to prolong the life of the catalyst. Some strategies seem to be useful to lower temperature in regeneration which is important to reduce cost and stabilize activity. In the end, the collaborations between experimental and computational techniques are urgently needed to address the complicated issue in heterogeneous catalysis such as coke formation. On the basis of the previous studies, three aspects are proposed to reduce the effect of coke further:
1. The advance of novel design of active center: the geometry of active site has been verified to be a crucial factor to control coke formation. The rationale is that single Pt has been sufficient to abstract hydrogen from propane, while side reactions such as hydrogenolysis required multiple PtPt site. Hence, the catalyst with a small ensemble of Pt, such as atomic Pt wire and Pt single atom/site surrounding by inactive elements, seems to be a good candidate, which may be synthesized via alloying and spatial confinement by support. (105) In addition, the local environment has significant impact on single Pt atom/site as indicated in the other single atom catalysts. (106,107) In particular, these inert surrounding coordinated species induced significant charge transfer from/to an active center, which consequently modifies the electronic structure. It is obvious that the combinations of active species and neighboring elements will be enormous. It is suggested that machine learning can be exerted to meet this challenge. The data from either experiment or computation feed into a machine learning model, which not only efficiently screens highly effective catalysts candidates but also possibly identifies a valid descriptor.
2. The coke migration: it is evident that coke formation is inevitable in PDH. To accommodate more cokes before regeneration is an effective way to extend the durability of the catalyst. The coke migration from the active metal to the support is a feasible way to keep activity. The migration is closely connected with the nature of the metal and the properties of the support, such as mobility of oxygen and structure of pores. Moreover, the interface between the metal and the support also determine the coke migration to some extent. Therefore, to resolve the mechanism of coke migration will require both experimental characterization and DFT simulation. The latter is capable to give a detailed description of metalsupport interaction. (108,109)
3. The kinetics of coke formation: most available models provide a phenomenological description. Investigations of coke kinetics at the molecular level and the transformation between disordered coke and graphitic coke are extremely scarce, which hinders the discovery of effective methods to suppress coke. The difficulties are most likely originated from the diversity of coke precursor and complex network. Although it is not straightforward to extrapolate to coke on Pt, the methodologies adopted for graphene growth on a metal catalyst might be a potential candidate to supply more insights, which included large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo simulations (110112) and molecular dynamics.

The understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly, with efforts focused on inhibiting its detrimental effects. Key challenges include the intricate relationship between coke structure, composition, and location, as well as the kinetics of coke growth, which lacks a molecular-level explanation. Strategies to address these challenges include:
1. Preventing coke formation through cofeeding gases, metal promoters, and support modifications. Hydrogen can remove coke precursors, weaken support acidity, and reduce the graphitization degree, requiring higher regeneration temperatures. Metal promoters, such as tin (Sn), alter catalyst properties by tuning both geometry and electron configuration, enhancing activity and stability. However, determining the optimal promoter type and loading remains elusive.
2. Facilitating coke migration from active metals to supports to maintain activity during the accumulation of coke, which is inevitable in partial oxidation of hydrocarbons (PDH). This process is influenced by metal and support properties, such as oxygen mobility and pore structure, as well as the interaction at the metal-support interface. Understanding coke migration mechanisms demands a combination of experimental and computational techniques.
3. Investigating coke formation kinetics, which is inadequately understood due to the complexity of coke precursors and networks. Despite the lack of a clear connection to coke on Pt, methodologies used for graphene growth on metal catalysts, such as large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and molecular dynamics, offer potential insights into coke formation dynamics.

These strategies aim to reduce coke formation and extend catalyst life, while also addressing the remaining obstacles through advanced catalyst design, novel active center engineering, and improved understanding of coke migration and kinetics.

对铂基催化剂中的焦炭沉积的理解已经显著发展，重点集中在抑制其有害影响。主要挑战包括焦炭结构、组成和位置之间的复杂关系，以及缺乏分子水平的焦炭生长机制解释。针对这些挑战的策略包括：
1. 通过共喂入气体、金属促进剂和支撑修改来防止焦炭形成。氢可以去除焦炭前体，减弱支撑酸性，并降低焦炭石墨化程度，从而需要更高的再生温度。金属促进剂，如锡（Sn），通过调整几何形状和电子配置来改变催化剂性质，同时增强活性和稳定性。然而，确定最合适的促进剂类型和加载量仍然存在不确定性。
2. 促进焦炭从活性金属转移到支持物以维持活性，这是在积聚焦炭之前延长催化剂耐用性的有效方法。这一过程受到金属和支撑物性质的影响，例如氧气的移动性和孔结构，以及金属-支撑界面的相互作用。理解焦炭迁移机制需要结合实验和计算技术。
3. 探索焦炭形成动力学，由于焦炭前体和网络的多样性，这一方面知之甚少。尽管难以将焦炭在Pt上的情况外推，但对于金属催化剂上石墨烯生长所采用的方法，如大规模动力学蒙特卡洛模拟和分子动力学，可能为提供更多关于焦炭形成动力学的见解。

这些策略旨在减少焦炭形成并延长催化剂寿命，同时通过先进的催化剂设计、新型活性中心工程和改进的焦炭迁移和动力学理解来克服剩余障碍。
