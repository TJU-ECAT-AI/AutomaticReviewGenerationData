1. Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize that the structure, composition, and location of cokes are critical factors in inhibiting their formation. However, we still lack a detailed molecular-level understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Various strategies aim to prevent coke formation, including cofeeding hydrogen, which can remove coke precursors and weaken the acidity of the support. Metal promoters like tin (Sn) can also improve activity and stability by altering the electronic and geometric properties of Pt.

2. Strategies addressing coke formation in Pt-based catalysts include the advancement of novel catalyst designs focusing on controlling the geometry of active sites to manage coke formation. Machine learning models can help screen and identify highly effective catalyst candidates by analyzing experimental or computational data. Additionally, strategies that facilitate coke migration from active metals to the support can maintain activity during operation. There is a scarcity of models that describe the kinetics of coke formation at a molecular level, hindering the discovery of effective methods to suppress it. Approaches to understand graphene growth on metal catalysts might offer insights into coke formation on Pt surfaces.

3. Challenges in the field include a lack of a detailed molecular-level understanding of coke formation mechanisms, the absence of effective methods to resolve the molecular mechanism, and the need for better models to describe the kinetics of coke formation. Further research is required to develop more precise catalyst designs and strategies that can effectively manage coke formation, including its migration and kinetics. Collaborations between experimental and computational techniques are crucial for addressing complex issues in heterogeneous catalysis, such as coke formation.

4. To reduce the effect of coke further, three aspects are proposed:
   a. Advanced catalyst design focusing on controlling the geometry of active sites to manage coke formation.
   b. Coke migration, which involves accommodating more cokes before regeneration by facilitating their movement from active metals to the support.
   c. Investigating the kinetics of coke formation at the molecular level and the transformation between disordered and graphitic coke, which requires detailed experimental characterization and DFT simulations to understand the mechanisms involved.

5. The effectiveness of strategies against coke formation depends on their ability to prevent, mitigate, or manage coke accumulation while maintaining high activity and stability. The remaining obstacles include the lack of a comprehensive molecular understanding of coke formation, the complexity of predicting and controlling coke kinetics, and the development of robust catalyst designs that can handle coke formation over extended periods. Addressing these challenges will require interdisciplinary collaboration between experimentalists and computational scientists, leveraging advanced modeling techniques and materials science insights.

1. 我们对铂基催化剂上焦炭沉积的理解已经发展到认识到焦炭的结构、组成和位置是抑制其形成的前提。然而，我们仍然缺乏关于其分子机制的详细理解。预防焦炭形成的策略包括向氢的共供给，可以去除焦炭前体并减弱支撑物的酸性。例如，锡（Sn）等金属促进剂可以直接通过调整Pt的几何和电子性质来提高活性和稳定性，同时增加活动性和稳定性。 

2. 针对铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成的各种策略包括先进的催化剂设计，重点关注控制活性位点的几何形状以管理焦炭形成。机器学习模型可以通过分析实验或计算数据来帮助筛选高度有效的催化剂候选者，并可能识别有效描述符。此外，促进活性金属向支撑物迁移焦炭的方法可以使活动得到维持。大多数可用的模型仅提供焦炭形成的表观描述，阻碍了发现有效抑制焦炭形成方法的探索。采用金属催化剂上石墨烯生长的方法可能为了解铂表面的焦炭形成提供更多的洞察。

3. 该领域面临的挑战包括缺乏详细的分子水平理解焦炭形成机制、有效方法解决分子机制的缺失以及描述焦炭形成动力学的模型不足。进一步的研究需要开发更精确的催化剂设计和策略，以有效地管理焦炭形成，包括其迁移和动力学。实验与计算技术之间的合作对于解决异质催化中复杂问题（如焦炭形成）至关重要。

4. 进一步减少焦炭影响的三个方面建议：
   a. 高级催化剂设计，专注于控制活性位点的几何形状以管理焦炭形成。
   b. 焦炭迁移，这涉及在再生之前容纳更多焦炭，通过使活性金属向支撑物迁移来维持活动。
   c. 探索焦炭形成动力学的分子水平和无序焦炭向石墨化焦炭的转变，这需要详细的实验表征和DFT模拟来理解涉及的机制。

5. 防止、减轻或管理焦炭积累的同时保持高活性和稳定性的策略的有效性取决于其性能。剩余的障碍包括缺乏全面的分子理解焦炭形成机制、预测和控制焦炭动力学的复杂性，以及开发能够长时间处理焦炭形成的稳健催化剂设计。解决这些挑战将需要跨学科的合作，利用高级建模技术和材料科学见解。
