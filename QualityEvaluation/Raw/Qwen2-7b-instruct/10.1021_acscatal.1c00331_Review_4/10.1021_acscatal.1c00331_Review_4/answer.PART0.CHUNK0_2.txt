To summarize, our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly over time, focusing on the role of coke structure, composition, and location. Challenges include a lack of molecular-level understanding of the formation mechanism and the complexity of preventing coke formation. Strategies to address these challenges include cofeeding hydrogen to remove coke precursors, utilizing metal promoters to tune catalyst properties, and modifying the support to alter its acid/base strength. Novel catalyst designs, such as single atom sites and confined Pt clusters, show promise in resisting coke formation. Additionally, methods to lower regeneration temperatures are being explored to improve cost-effectiveness and stability. Three key areas for further research are advancing catalyst design, enhancing coke migration mechanisms, and investigating coke formation kinetics. These advancements aim to significantly reduce the impact of coke formation on Pt-based catalysts.
