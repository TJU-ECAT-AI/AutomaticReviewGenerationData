1. Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize that the structure, composition, and location of cokes are crucial for inhibiting their formation. Challenges include the entanglement of these factors and the ongoing debate over coke composition. Kinetics play a significant role in coke formation, yet molecular-level mechanisms remain elusive due to the complexity of the process. Various strategies to prevent coke formation include cofeeding hydrogen, modifying catalyst promoters, and adjusting support properties. Novel catalyst designs, such as single atom sites or confined Pt clusters, have shown promise.

2. Strategies to address coke formation in Pt-based catalysts involve advancing catalyst design, facilitating coke migration, and improving the kinetics of coke formation. Advanced materials science and computational techniques are essential for addressing these challenges effectively.
