[1] "The structure, composition, and location of cokes are the prerequisite to inhibit coke formation."
[2] "It is revealed that these factors are entangled, and the details regarding coke composition are still under debate."
[3] "The cofeeding of hydrogen can remove the coke precursor and weaken the acidity of the support."
[4] "The promoters, such as Sn, directly tune the catalytic properties of Pt from both a geometry and electronic perspective, which simultaneously increase activity and stability."
[5] "However, the optimal kind and loading of promoter is still not concluded as there is a lack of guiding principle to govern a search."
[6] "The additive to conventional support alumina can modify the acid/base strength and facilitate the coke transfer between metal and support."
[7] "New developments of effective catalyst design are also noted."
[8] "The success of single atom/site strategy wisely exploited the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reaction in PDH."
[9] "The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation."
[10] "Although these methods indeed alleviate the coke formation, the regeneration is still needed to prolong the life of the catalyst."
[11] "Some strategies seem to be useful to lower temperature in regeneration which is important to reduce cost and stabilize activity."
[12] "On the basis of the previous studies, three aspects are proposed to reduce the effect of coke further:"

In summary, the understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly, with coke formation being a critical issue for commercial catalysts. Key challenges include understanding the intricate relationship between coke structure, composition, and location, as well as the kinetics of coke growth. Various strategies to address coke formation involve preventive measures such as cofeeding hydrogen to remove precursors and weaken support acidity, using metal promoters to enhance catalytic properties, and modifying conventional supports to alter acid/base strengths. Novel catalyst designs, particularly the single atom/site strategy and confined subnanosized Pt clusters, have shown promise in reducing coke formation. However, there remains uncertainty in optimizing promoter types and loadings, and the effectiveness of regeneration techniques. Future research is needed to refine catalyst designs, improve coke migration mechanisms, and develop molecular-level models of coke formation kinetics.
