To fully understand the kinetics of graphene growth, large-scale atomic simulations of graphene islands evolution up to macro sizes
(i.e., graphene islands of a few micrometers or with billions of carbon atoms) during growth and etching is essential, but remains a
great challenge. In this paper, we developed a low computational cost large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithm, which
includes all possible events of carbon attachments and detachments on various edge sites of graphene islands. Such a method
allows us to simulate the evolution of graphene islands with sizes up to tens of micrometers during either growth or etching with a
single CPU core. With this approach and the carefully ﬁtted parameters, we have reproduced the experimentally observed evolution
of graphene islands during both growth or etching on Pt(111) surface, and revealed more atomic details of graphene growth and
etching. Based on the atomic simulations, we discovered a complementary relationship of graphene growth and etching—the
route of graphene island shape evolution during growth is exactly the same as that of the etching of a hole in graphene and that of
graphene island etching is exactly same as that of hole growth. The complementary relation brings us a basic principle to
understand the growth and etching of graphene, and other 2D materials from atomic scale to macro size and the KMC algorithm is
expected to be further developed into a standard simulation package for investigating the growth mechanism of 2D materials on
various substrates.

INTRODUCTION
Graphene is a two-dimensional carbon allotrope that was ﬁrstly
isolated in 2004 by Geim and Novoselov and their colleagues, and
then has attracted intensive studies for >15 years1. Monocrystal-
line graphene has excellent properties, such as very high
mechanical strength, thermal conductivity, carrier mobility and
emergent Dirac excitations, and many consequent potential
applications2–6. To realize the vast applications of graphene, a
mass of physical and chemical methods, such as mechanical and
chemical exfoliation7–10, epitaxial growth11–13, thermal decom-
position of silicon carbide14–16 and chemical vapor deposition
(CVD)17–37,
was
developed
to
synthesize
various
graphene
samples. Among them, the CVD method is the only one that
enables the production of high-quality single-layer graphene ﬁlms
in macro sizes, such as the wafer-scale single-crystalline graphene
grown on Cu surface. In real experiments, by tuning the
experimental parameters, such as concentrations of carbon
precursor and carrier gases, temperature, substrate type, and
morphology, graphene islands of various shapes have been
broadly observed30–37. At atomic scale, graphene CVD growth
involves many physical and chemical steps, such as feedstock
molecules decomposition, precursor diffusion on the substrate,
carbon attachment, and detachment at the graphene edge. To
realize the controllable synthesis, it is crucial to understand the
mechanism of graphene CVD growth, and identify the threshold
step and the key factors that control the growth38–48. Thus, the
large-scale atomic simulation of graphene growth is highly
desirable, and, besides graphene, such a simulation method is
also urgently needed for understanding the growth mechanism of
various 2D materials and their controllable synthesis.
Theoretically, the kinetics of graphene growth or etching has
been understood based on the theory of kink nucleation and
propagation34,38, in which kink nucleation at an armchair (AC) or
zigzag (ZZ) edge is considered as the threshold step of edge
propagation, and the existing kinks propagate rather fast. Based
on this theory, the growth rate of any graphene edge can be
estimated, and the graphene shape evolution during growth or
etching can be predicted by applying the theory of kinetic Wulff
construction. Such theory has been applied to explain and predict
the graphene morphology evolution during CVD growth or
etching and qualitative agreements with experimental observa-
tions were broadly reported33,34. While, to explore more atomic
details during graphene growth or etching, such as the effect of
concentration gradient of carbon precursors on the substrate, the
effect of substrate inhomogeneity, the lattice mismatch between
graphene and the substrate, the previous theory must be
extensively modiﬁed, and many of these effects can only be
revealed by atomic simulations.
Phase ﬁeld theory allows us to explore the overall shape
evolution of an island of graphene or other 2D materials on
various substrates with a concentration gradient36,37,49–52. But it
ignored the atomic structure details in the simulations. Molecular
dynamic simulation includes all the atomic details, but the very
short simulation time mostly leads to defective graphene islands
of a few nm or less and, thus, it cannot offer a complete scenery of
graphene growth from the nucleation of a nanometer-sized island
to a macro-sized graphene ﬁlm53. Recently, some kinetic Monte
Carlo (KMC) methods were developed to explore the growth and
etching of graphene and other 2D materials, but the maxim sizes
of the simulated islands of graphene or 2D materials were
generally <10 nm (refs. 54–57), which was far from sufﬁcient to

reveal the size-dependent growth behavior or graphene, such as
the fractal-shaped graphene islands grown with a precursor
concentration gradient on the substrate surface.
In this paper, we present a large-scale KMC method for the
simulation of graphene growth/etching on a transition metal
surface. The order-N algorithm allows us to explore the graphene
growth up to the size of tens of μm with a single CPU core, and to
reveal the morphology evolution of a graphene island as the
dimension crossing many orders of magnitude, from a single
hexagon to that with billions of atoms. With this simulation
package, we have reproduced the experimentally observed shape
evolution of graphene and holes in graphene on Pt surface, during
both growth and etching processes, and insights into the
mechanism of graphene growth on Pt has been achieved. Our
study reveals a very important complementary principle of
graphene growth and etching. Besides, our algorithm is efﬁcient
in the scale of experimental observations and each event has a
clear physical meaning, which are very beneﬁcial for under-
standing the mechanisms of the growth and etching of 2D
materials precisely. Therefore, it is expected to be a general
method for the simulation of various 2D materials.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Algorithm of large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo simulation
The framework of our method is same with general KMC
algorithm (see Supplementary Material for the process of general
KMC and our method). Here, we brieﬂy introduce the key events
of our simulation, the calculation of the corresponding energy
barriers, and the algorithm for fast simulation.
The initial conﬁguration is a graphene island with certain
number of hexagons, and the events are deﬁned as adding or
removing one hexagon to or from an edge of the graphene island.
We used 0 or 1 to record the existences of nearest and second-
nearest hexagons, and the numbers of nearest and second-
nearest
hexagons,
(m,
n),
around
the
active
hexagon
to
characterize the type of the event, as shown in Fig. 1a. The
number of nearest hexagons, m, could be an integer from 1 to
4 since m = 0 corresponded a nucleation event, which is not
considered in this study and m = 5 or 6 corresponded an existing
hexagon in the central of graphene lattice and was hardly to be
removed. Likewise, the number of second-nearest hexagons, n,
ranged from 1 to 10. According to the kink nucleation and
propagation theory, three kind of events are critical for graphene
growth or etching, which are kink nucleation at a ZZ edge, kink
nucleation at an AC edge, and kink propagation. Besides the four
events on straight ZZ and AC edges, adding and removing
hexagons at various types of convex and concave sites of a
graphene island must be considered and, in general, adding
(removing) a hexagon at a concave (convex) site is energetically
more favorable than that at a straight edge, while adding
(removing) a hexagon at a convex (concave) site is energetically
less favorable than that at a straight edge. Some typical types of
events were shown in Fig. 1b, and more types of events were
listed in the Supplementary Materials, Supplementary Fig. 2.
Each unit of a hexagon graphene lattice has two carbon atoms
and thus there are two steps of forming a new hexagon, one of
them corresponds an intermediate state and another one is the
global minimum. The events of adding or removing a hexagon
should correspond the global minimum and the barrier of the
event should be the highest energy of the whole process. This
ensures the correct kinetics of adding/removing carbon to/from a
graphene edge. The Gibbs free-energy barrier of adding a new
hexagon at the site of (m, n) is

where ΔE(m,n) is the energy difference between the ﬁnal and initial
states or the reaction energy. As an example, we consider the
graphene growth on a Pt(111) surface. We calculated the reaction
energies of key events during graphene growth and etching on
the substrate by density-functional theory (DFT). The results of ZZ
edge nucleation, AC edge nucleation, 120° convex corner growth,
and 60° concave corner growth are ΔE(2,5) = 2.48 eV, ΔE(3,5) = 1.19
eV, ΔE(1,3) = 3.09 eV, and ΔE(4,9) = −1.95 eV, respectively. The order
of these reaction energies agrees well with our intuition that
adding precursors to a concave (convex) site is the easiest
(hardest) and the kink nucleation on a ZZ edge is more difﬁcult
than that on an AC edge34,38. Besides, the consideration of the
reverse processes ensures correct thermodynamics of the system
during the evolution. In Fig. 2a, we listed these calculated events
and their reverse events with their indexes, barriers, structure
sketches, and reaction energy proﬁles in a table.

cases were considered in the ﬁtting:
(i)
The reaction energy of kink propagation (3, 6) must be 0 eV,
ΔE(3,6) = 0, because the local structure was not changed by
the reaction.

The reaction energy of annihilating two kinks is the negative

The nucleation energies on an AC-like edge, such as (3, 3),
(3, 4), (3, 8), and (3, 9)…, have large errors from the DFT
calculated event, AC nucleation (3, 5). So, we reconsidered
these events based on the DFT result (see SI).
It is important to note that the simulated results are generally
very similar in quite large ranges of these parameters and,
therefore, the insights of graphene growth revealed by the KMC
simulation are robust.
Next, let’s consider the difference between the reaction energy
and the barrier of an event, E m;n

Þ. Generally, the barrier
of a reaction highly depends on the initial, ﬁnal conﬁgurations, the
intermediate
states,
and
the
speciﬁc
conﬁguration
of
the
graphene site on the catalyst surface and its precisely calculation
is very challenging. In a recent calculation, Wang et al., proved that
the barrier of a nucleation event can be estimated by summation
of the formation energy of the nucleus and the barrier of kink
propagation58. So, we consider the energy difference between a
transition state and the initial or ﬁnal state, whichever is higher, is
a constant, 0.5 eV. Such a constant energy barrier for all events
keeps the central idea of the theory of kink nucleation and
propagation, and the exact value will not have much impact on
the evolution of graphene because the probabilities of most
events are changed by a same factor.
The list of energy barriers can be used to simulate the graphene
growth or etching in a homogeneous environment. In this paper,
we focus on studying the general behaviors of graphene growth
and etching in CVD experiments. Here, we assumed that the
concentration of carbon adatoms on the whole substrate is a
constant, which is applicable for the attachment limit of graphene
growth35–37,49. The lattice mismatch between graphene and
substrate is one of the key factors in understanding growth
mechanism of graphene. The effect of substrate contains several
parts. Firstly, the activity of substrate determines the bonding
between the graphene edge and substrate, and therefore
determines the reaction energy of different events, this part has
been considered in our calculations. Secondly, the reaction energy
of an event is a function of the relative coordinates on substrate
lattice, which may lead to the change of growth mode from kink
nucleation and propagation (on less active and lattice matched
substrates) to growth in unit of Moire pattern (on more active and
lattice mismatched substrates)59. To fully understand the effect of
substrate is our ultimate goal, but tremendous further efforts are
required to obtain the functions of these events on a speciﬁc
substrate60. In this manuscript, the ﬂuctuation of van der Waals
(VDW) interaction from the lattice mismatch between graphene
and
the
substrate
is
neglected.
As
we
discussed
in
the
introduction, these effects can be further explored by modifying
the barriers of these events as functions of the local environment.
We further optimized the algorithm to simulate the growth or
etching of very large graphene islands. Firstly, we ignore the bulk
part of a graphene island and only recorded the hexagons of its
edge because the bulk part is highly robust, and all the events of
adding new hexagons or hexagonal removal occurs on the edge.
Secondly, after a reaction, we only update very few events of the
event list occurred in the vicinal of the added or removed
hexagon. These approaches, together with applying advanced
computational algorithms, greatly reduced the computation cost,
and allow us to simulate graphene islands with billions of
hexagons or with lateral size up to tens of micrometers.
KMC simulations of graphene on Pt(111) surface
With the developed KMC algorithm and ﬁtted parameters, now
let’s simulate the evolution of graphene islands and holes in
graphene on Pt(111) surface during both growth and etching
processes, respectively. Such processes have been systematically
studied in experiments and the theory of kink nucleation and
propagation has been applied to explain the experimentally
observed graphene islands and the holes in graphene34. It was
found that a growing graphene island always presents a
hexagonal shape with six straight ZZ edges and six sharp convex
corners, while an etched graphene island will ﬁnally reach a steady

state with a dodecagon shape with 12 19° edges. In contrast, a
hole in graphene presents straight ZZ edges and sharp concave
corners during etching, but its circumference generally becomes
rounded during growth. In order to verify the simulation method
and reveal further details of graphene growth and etching on Pt
(111) surface, we will explore this system with the developed KMC
method.
We ﬁrstly investigated the growth of graphene. The growth rate

 1, the propagation rate is
approximately proportional to sK(χ) or the kink concentration of
the graphene edge. Among all possible graphene edges, the 19°-
edges are the edges with the highest kink concentration, and thus
generally are the edges that propagate fastest34,38.
According to the theory of kinetic Wulff construction, the shape
of a graphene island during growth is determined by the slowest
propagating edges, which always leads to hexagonal graphene
island with straight ZZ edges. We performed our method in
simulating the growth behaviors of graphene islands, the KMC
condition was μ = 0.2 eV and kBT = 0.1 eV. Figure 3a presents the
evolution of a graphene island during a KMC simulation from a
circular shape of ~5 μm in diameter to a hexagon of ~8 μm. From
which, we clearly see that all the edges with high concentration of
kinks disappear quickly because of their fast propagation rates. As
a result, graphene island ﬁrstly became a dodecagonal shape with
six ZZ and six AC edges. Then, the AC edges gradually became
shorter and shorter because they propagate faster than ZZ edges.
Finally, a hexagonal graphene with six straight ZZ edges was
formed and the shape remained same during further evolution
despite the increase of the size. The atomic details of these
structures were shown in Fig. 3b. In Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig.
5, we present the evolutions of graphene islands with two
different initial shapes during simulation. As can be clearly seen,
both quickly evolved into a hexagonal graphene island with six ZZ
edges. This simulation reproduced the results of kinetic Wulff
construction34,38 and presented more details of graphene shape
evolution during growth and, thus, validated the KMC algorithm.
Furthermore, a small size graphene island with circle shape and a
C24 cluster were also simulated in Supplementary Fig. 5. The
similar process of shape evolution indicates that it is a general
behavior regardless the lateral size of the island.
The lateral size of a hexagonal graphene island as a function of
the simulation time is presented in Fig. 3c, d. It is found that the
size of the graphene increases exponentially with the growth time,
which implies that the island grows faster and faster or the growth
rate is size dependent. This is a typical feature of nucleation-
mediated crystal growth, which was broadly observed during the
growth of nanomaterials, such as the CVD growth of nanowires62.

is

smaller than the nucleation time and, therefore, such a short edge
has zero kink during most of its growth time and the growth rate
will depend on the probability of the kink nucleation on the edge,
which is proportional to the number of ZZ sites of the edge or the
length of the edge. As shown in SI, we have

Supplementary Fig. 4. So far, the in situ observation of graphene
CVD growth is very limited and there’s no direct evidence of the
edge length-dependent growth rate of graphene.
Next, we studied the etching of graphene islands on a Pt(111)
surface. Different from graphene island growth, the fast propagat-
ing edges should survive while the slow propagating ones should
disappear during an etching process34. According to Eq. (4) and
the theory similar to the kinetic Wulff construction for crystal
growth, the ﬁnal shape of a graphene island during etching
should be a dodecagon with twelve 19°-edges34. We performed
our method in simulating the etching behaviors of graphene
islands, the KMC condition was μ = −0.2 eV and kBT = 0.1 eV. As
shown in Fig. 4a, the evolution of a graphene island during
etching starts with a regular hexagon with six ZZ edges. Firstly, the
angles of the six sharp corners became larger and larger, and the
six straight edges gradually became six smooth curves because
the continuous kinks generation and propagation from the six
sharp corners gradually reshaped the outline of the graphene
island.
Later,
12
straight
edges

the
crystallographic
directions
of
~10.5°
from
the
six
ZZ
edges
formed
the
circumference of the graphene island. It is surprising that
the crystallographic alignments of these edges are not 19° from
the three ZZ directions as predicted by the kink nucleation and
propagation theory. During further evolution, the tilt angles of the
12 edges of the circumference became larger and larger,
approaching to 19° gradually. We measured angles of two corners
α1 and α2, and plotted their evolution with time in Fig. 4b. α2 was
starting from 21° and gradually approaching to 38°, which is the
angle between two 19° edges. This evolution of corners has been
observed in experiment63. However, the theory of kinetic Wulff
construction didn’t predict this observation.
The etching rate was also studied by plotting the diameter of
dodecagon with the etching time in Fig. 4c. In sharp contrast to
the graphene growth, it is found that the size of the island, L,
decreases linearly with the etching time after a dodecagon
formed. The linear relationship is originated from the kinetics of
etching. In an etching process, most kinks nucleation events
started from the corners of the islands, which is as easy as the kink
propagation. Therefore, the etching rate is mainly contributed by
the
concentration
of
kinks
at
the
edge
and
the
whole
circumference will be evolved into a shape enclosed by edges
with highest kink density. This leads to a constant etching rate
after a short period.
In Fig. 4d, we showed the atomic structures of the edges and
corners of the dodecagonal graphene island, from which we can
see that the edge is not atomically straight and, therefore the
numbers of the kinks of these edges are different from that used
in previous studies. So, we believe that the kink nucleation and
propagation theory, which is based on the propagation of regular
and straight graphene edges, is not accurate enough for the
prediction of the shape evolution of graphene islands during
etching or regrowth, and the atomic details can be caught by
large-scale atomic simulations only.
The simulated growth and etching of a hole in graphene are
presented in Fig. 5. The KMC conditions were μ = 0.2 eV and kBT =
0.1 eV for growth, and μ = −0.2 eV and kBT = 0.1 eV for etching. As
shown in Fig. 5a, during graphene growth, the hexagonal hole
starts to be ﬁlled nearby the six concave corners and the six sharp
corners become rounded in large scale and, atomic details show
that the angle quickly becomes larger and larger and then
gradually approaching to 158°, the angle indicated by the theory

of kink nucleation and propagation. Later, another angle appears
at the center of each edge and then gradually approaching to
142°. The evolution of two complementary angles of them is
shown in Fig. 5b. In Fig. 5c, we can see that the hole keeps its
original hexagonal shape with six ZZ edges during the graphene
etching, which reproduces the shape evolution of graphene island
during growth is very similar to that of graphene islands growth.
Complementary relationship of graphene growth and etching
To further demonstrate similarities and differences of graphene
island and hole shape evolution during growth and etching, we
plot the schematic diagrams of graphene and hole growth and
etching in Fig. 6.
Figure 6a represents the atomic structure of a graphene island
and a hole near a corner of them. The straight edge of both have
exactly same atomic structure, but the structures of the corners of
them are complementary—the coordination number of the
hexagon at the corner of a graphene island is less than that of
a hexagon of a ﬂat edge, while the coordination number of a
hexagon at the corner of a hole in graphene is larger than that of
a hexagon of a ﬂat edge. So, in an etching process, removing a
hexagon from a ZZ edge has a smaller reaction energy than that
from a concave corner of a hole (Fig. 6b). Thus, the nucleation on
a ZZ edge is a threshold step of the hole evolution during
etching. Such a kinetics is exactly same as the growth of
hexagonal graphene island with six ZZ edges, where adding a
hexagon on the convex corner is less favorable than that on a ﬂat
ZZ edge (Fig. 6b). So, the hole shape evolution during etching is
exactly same as that of a graphene island during growth. During
graphene growth, adding carbon atoms to a concave corner of a
hole is energetically more favorable than that near a straight ZZ
edge (Fig. 6c), which is similar to the etching of a graphene island,
where the hexagons at the convex corners can be easily removed
(Fig. 6c). The complementary relation of graphene growth and
etching is not a surprise because the hole actually becomes larger
and larger during graphene etching, and smaller and smaller
during growth, which is exactly opposite to the evolutions of
graphene island during growth and etching.
Above KMC simulations and kinetics analysis clearly showed a
fundamental principle of graphene growth and etching that the
growth and etching of a graphene island and a hole in graphene
are complementary, or the graphene island shape evolution
during growth is same as that of hole in graphene during etching,
and that of graphene etching is same as that of hole growth.
Furthermore, consider the generality of the theoretical analysis,
such a principle can be applied to the growth and etching of all
2D materials and even 3D materials. In is worth to note that, in
ref. 61, Stehle and coauthors have reported a similar behavior of
hexagonal boron nitride during the growth and etching.
The complementary relationship can also be understood in
macroscopic scale. In macroscopic scale, the shape evolution
during growth/etching are all described by the evolution of the
boundary. We considered two complementary cases, growth of a
hexagonal graphene island and etching of a hexagonal hole, as
example. In these two cases, the shapes of boundary are
determined by the slowest propagating edges, which is the
concept of kinetic Wulff construction. Since the initial shape of
boundaries and the slowest edge are both same, the evolution
route would be exactly same in two cases.
In summary, we introduced a large-scale KMC method to
simulate the growth and etching of graphene island, and holes
in graphene. The KMC algorithm allows use to perform large-
scale simulations to understand the evolution of graphene up
to 10-micrometers in sizes without losing atomic details.
Beneﬁted by the large-scale simulation, we have revealed a
complementary relationship of graphene growth and etching

0.1 eV for etching. a Growth of a hexagonal hole with all zigzag edges. The red contours are circumferences of a graphene island during
etching shown in Fig. 4a, from which one can see that the hole shape evolution during growth is similar to that of island etching. The scale bar

—that the shape evolution of a graphene island during growth
is exactly same as that of a hole during etching, and that of a
graphene island during etching is exactly same as that of a
hole during growth. Such a complementary relationship can be
easily extended to understand the growth and etching of other
2D and 3D materials, which provide a theoretical basis to
understand the relationship of materials growth and etching.
METHODS
First-principle calculations
The reaction energies of key events are obtained by using ﬁrst-principle
calculations, the atomic models are introduced in the Supplementary
Materials.
The Vienna ab initio simulation package is employed for all ﬁrst-principle
calculations64. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof parameterization of general-
ized gradient approximation (GGA) is used for the exchange–correlation
function65. The projector-augmented wave potentials are used for
ion–electron interactions66. The DFT-D2 VDWs density functional is used
for the corrections of the interlayer VDWs interaction67. The electronic self-
consistency criterion is set to 10−4 eV. For geometry relaxation, the force
on atoms is converged below 0.01 eV Å−1. A vacuum layer of 15 Å is used.
The substrate contains three layers atoms with bottom two layers ﬁxed. For
graphene bulk energy on substrates, all calculations are sampled by 4 ×
4 × 1 k-mesh. For step energy calculation, all the calculations are sampled
with 1 × 1 × 1 k-point.
