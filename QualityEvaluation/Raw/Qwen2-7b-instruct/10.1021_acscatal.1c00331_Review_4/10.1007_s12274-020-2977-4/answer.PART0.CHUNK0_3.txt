[1] "The notable improved activity of Cu1/CN/TiO2 in contrast to Cu1/CN/Al2O3 can be ascribed to different doped N species in two catalysts for their active sites being Cu-Nx structure."
[2] "The calculated turnover frequency (TOF) value of Cu1/CN/TiO2 is 104 h−1 at reaction time of 0.5 h, which is nearly twice higher than that of Cu1/CN/Al2O3."
[3] "Moreover, the Cu1/CN/TiO2 catalyst can be recovered and reused at least five times without obvious loss of activity and selectivity."
[4] "According to the Bader charge analysis, the charge on the Cu species is 0.712 e in the pyridinic-N coordination, which is higher than that in the pyrrolic-N coordination (0.655 e), illustrating the higher electron density of the Cu species in the latter."

This study reports on the control of nitrogen doping types in carbon materials to enhance the activity of single-atom site (SA) Cu catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of quinoline. By compounding with different metal oxides, the nitrogen doping types in carbon materials can be dominated as pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N, respectively. The proportion of distinct doped nitrogen species in carbon depends on the acidity and basicity of the compounded metal oxide host. The SA Cu catalyst with predominant pyrrolic-N coordination displays an enhanced activity for the hydrogenation of quinoline, providing the target product tetrahydroquinoline with high selectivity under mild conditions. The higher electron density of SA Cu species induced by the pyrrolic-N coordination benefits the hydrogen transfer process and reduces the energy barrier of the hydrogenation pathway, leading to improved catalytic efficiency.

这项研究报道了在碳材料中控制氮掺杂类型以增强单原子位点（SA）铜催化剂对喹啉的转移氢化作用。通过与不同金属氧化物复合，碳材料中的氮掺杂类型可以分别为主导为吡咯氮和吡啶氮。在碳材料中掺入不同类型的氮的量取决于复合金属氧化物载体的酸性和碱性。具有主要吡咯氮协调的SA铜催化剂在喹啉氢化反应中表现出增强的活性，提供目标产物四氢喹啉并具有高选择性，在温和条件下。由吡咯氮协调引起的SA铜物种的更高电子密度促进了氢转移过程，并降低了氢化途径的能量壁垒，从而提高了SA铜催化剂的催化效率。
