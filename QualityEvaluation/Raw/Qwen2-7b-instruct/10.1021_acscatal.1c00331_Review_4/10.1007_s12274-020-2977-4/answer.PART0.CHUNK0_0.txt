[1] "In order to rationally tune the performance of SA catalysts on CN, it is essential to clearly understand the correlation of these nitrogen-doping types with the catalytic performance of central metals."
[2] "The notable improved activity of Cu1/CN/TiO2 in contrast to Cu1/CN/Al2O3 can be ascribed to different doped N species in two catalysts for their active sites being Cu-Nx structure."
[3] "According to the Bader charge analysis, the charge on the Cu species is 0.712 e in the pyridinic-N coordination, which is higher than that in the pyrrolic-N coordination (0.655 e), illustrating the higher electron density of the Cu species in the latter."

1. The performance of single-atom site (SA) catalysts on nitrogen-doped carbon (CN) materials can be significantly enhanced by controlling the type of nitrogen doping. This is crucial because the nature of the nitrogen atoms affects the catalytic properties of the central metals in the catalysts. 

2. The improved activity of the SA Cu catalyst on TiO2 over Al2O3 can be attributed to the distinct nitrogen doping types in the two catalysts. The active sites in the catalysts are Cu-Nx structures, where the coordination of nitrogen atoms plays a key role.

3. The charge on the Cu species is higher in the pyridinic-N coordination (0.712 e) compared to the pyrrolic-N coordination (0.655 e). This difference in charge indicates that the Cu species is more electron-dense in the pyrrolic-N coordination, which contributes to the improved catalytic efficiency of the SA Cu catalyst.

1. 对于氮掺杂碳（CN）材料上的单原子位点（SA）催化剂，通过控制氮掺杂类型可以显著增强其性能。这至关重要，因为氮原子的性质影响催化剂中中心金属的催化特性。

2. SA Cu催化剂在TiO2上的活性优于Al2O3，这一差异可归因于两种催化剂中不同的氮掺杂类型。催化剂中的活性位点是Cu-Nx结构，氮原子的配位对活性具有关键作用。

3. 在吡啶基-N配位下，Cu物种的电荷为0.712 e，在吡咯基-N配位下为0.655 e。这种电荷差异表明，在吡咯基-N配位下，Cu物种的电子密度更高，这有助于提高SA Cu催化剂的催化效率。
