[1] "Due to the commonly random doping behaviors of N species in these CN, it is a tough issue to finely regulate their doping types and clarify their effect on the catalytic property of such catalysts."
[2] "It is found that the proportion of distinct doped N species in CN depends on the acidity and basicity of compounded metal oxide host."
[3] "Owing to the coordination by pyrrolic-N, the SA Cu catalyst displays an enhanced activity (two-fold) for transfer hydrogenation of quinoline to access the valuable molecule tetrahydroquinoline with a good selectivity (99%) under mild conditions."
[4] "The higher electron density of SA Cu species induced by the predominate pyrrolic-N coordination benefits the hydrogen transfer process and reduces the energy barrier of the hydrogenation pathway, which accounts for the improved catalytic efficiency."

The study investigates the control of nitrogen doping types in carbon materials, specifically focusing on pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N. By combining with different metal oxides, the researchers can dominate the nitrogen doping type. The proportion of distinct nitrogen species in carbon materials is influenced by the acidity and basicity of the metal oxide host. The SA Cu catalyst, with predominant pyrrolic-N coordination, exhibits enhanced activity for the transfer hydrogenation of quinoline. The higher electron density of SA Cu species, induced by pyrrolic-N coordination, facilitates the hydrogen transfer process and lowers the energy barrier in the hydrogenation pathway, leading to improved catalytic efficiency.
