[1] "The CN material from the pyrolysis of the MF coating layer on the acidic and basic MOx host can display the major nitrogen-doping type as pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N respectively."
[2] "In contrast to the pyridinic-N, the doped pyrrolic-N dramatically enhances the performance of SA Cu catalyst for hydrogenation of quinoline with AB, providing the THQ in good yield and selectivity under mild reaction conditions."
[3] "The SA Cu species coordinated with pyrrolic-N take on the higher electron density which is in favor of promoting the hydrogen transfer process from AB molecule and results in the much lower energy barrier in the quinoline hydrogenation pathway, and so improves the activity of the SA Cu catalyst for the transfer hydrogenation of quinoline."

This study demonstrates a method to control the nitrogen-doping type in carbon nitrides through the use of metal oxides. By doing so, it leads to an optimized single-atom site Cu catalyst with enhanced activity for the transfer hydrogenation of quinoline. The nitrogen doping type affects the coordination structure of the active Cu species, leading to differences in electron density and hydrogen transfer efficiency. The pyrrolic-N coordination results in higher electron density, facilitating the hydrogen transfer process and reducing the energy barrier, thus improving the catalytic efficiency.
