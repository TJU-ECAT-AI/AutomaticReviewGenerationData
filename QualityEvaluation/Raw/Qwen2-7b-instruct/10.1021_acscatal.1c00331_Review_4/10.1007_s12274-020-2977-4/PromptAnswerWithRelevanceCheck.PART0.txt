[1] "In order to rationally tune the performance of SA catalysts on CN, it is essential to clearly understand the correlation of these nitrogen-doping types with the catalytic performance of central metals."
[2] "The notable improved activity of Cu1/CN/TiO2 in contrast to Cu1/CN/Al2O3 can be ascribed to different doped N species in two catalysts for their active sites being Cu-Nx structure."
[3] "According to the Bader charge analysis, the charge on the Cu species is 0.712 e in the pyridinic-N coordination, which is higher than that in the pyrrolic-N coordination (0.655 e), illustrating the higher electron density of the Cu species in the latter."

1. The performance of single-atom site (SA) catalysts on nitrogen-doped carbon (CN) materials can be significantly enhanced by controlling the type of nitrogen doping. This is crucial because the nature of the nitrogen atoms affects the catalytic properties of the central metals in the catalysts. 

2. The improved activity of the SA Cu catalyst on TiO2 over Al2O3 can be attributed to the distinct nitrogen doping types in the two catalysts. The active sites in the catalysts are Cu-Nx structures, where the coordination of nitrogen atoms plays a key role.

3. The charge on the Cu species is higher in the pyridinic-N coordination (0.712 e) compared to the pyrrolic-N coordination (0.655 e). This difference in charge indicates that the Cu species is more electron-dense in the pyrrolic-N coordination, which contributes to the improved catalytic efficiency of the SA Cu catalyst.

1. 对于氮掺杂碳（CN）材料上的单原子位点（SA）催化剂，通过控制氮掺杂类型可以显著增强其性能。这至关重要，因为氮原子的性质影响催化剂中中心金属的催化特性。

2. SA Cu催化剂在TiO2上的活性优于Al2O3，这一差异可归因于两种催化剂中不同的氮掺杂类型。催化剂中的活性位点是Cu-Nx结构，氮原子的配位对活性具有关键作用。

3. 在吡啶基-N配位下，Cu物种的电荷为0.712 e，在吡咯基-N配位下为0.655 e。这种电荷差异表明，在吡咯基-N配位下，Cu物种的电子密度更高，这有助于提高SA Cu催化剂的催化效率。

[1] "In this work, through the controllable pyrrolic-N coordination, the SA Cu catalyst realizes the hydrogenation of quinolines in 99% selectivity under mild conditions (60 oC for 2 h) with ammonia-borane (AB) as the hydrogen source."
[2] "The notable improved activity of Cu1/CN/TiO2 in contrast to Cu1/CN/Al2O3 can be ascribed to different doped N species in two catalysts for their active sites being Cu-Nx structure."
[3] "According to the Bader charge analysis, the charge on the Cu species is 0.712 e in the pyridinic-N coordination, which is higher than that in the pyrrolic-N coordination (0.655 e), illustrating the higher electron density of the Cu species in the latter."
[4] "Therefore, the higher electron density of Cu species resulted from the pyrrolic-N coordination is apparently beneficial to this process."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The activity of the SA Cu catalyst is improved when it is coordinated with pyrrolic-N instead of pyridinic-N. This is because the pyrrolic-N coordination increases the electron density of the Cu species, which facilitates the hydrogen transfer process from the hydrogen source and reduces the energy barrier in the hydrogenation pathway, thus enhancing the catalytic efficiency.

[1] "The CN material from the pyrolysis of the MF coating layer on the acidic and basic MOx host can display the major nitrogen-doping type as pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N respectively."
[2] "In contrast to the pyridinic-N, the doped pyrrolic-N dramatically enhances the performance of SA Cu catalyst for hydrogenation of quinoline with AB, providing the THQ in good yield and selectivity under mild reaction conditions."
[3] "The SA Cu species coordinated with pyrrolic-N take on the higher electron density which is in favor of promoting the hydrogen transfer process from AB molecule and results in the much lower energy barrier in the quinoline hydrogenation pathway, and so improves the activity of the SA Cu catalyst for the transfer hydrogenation of quinoline."

This study demonstrates a method to control the nitrogen-doping type in carbon nitrides through the use of metal oxides. By doing so, it leads to an optimized single-atom site Cu catalyst with enhanced activity for the transfer hydrogenation of quinoline. The nitrogen doping type affects the coordination structure of the active Cu species, leading to differences in electron density and hydrogen transfer efficiency. The pyrrolic-N coordination results in higher electron density, facilitating the hydrogen transfer process and reducing the energy barrier, thus improving the catalytic efficiency.

[2] "The calculated turnover frequency (TOF) value of Cu1/CN/TiO2 is 104 h−1 at reaction time of 0.5 h, which is nearly twice higher than that of Cu1/CN/Al2O3."

This study reports on the control of nitrogen doping types in carbon materials to enhance the activity of single-atom site (SA) Cu catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of quinoline. By compounding with different metal oxides, the nitrogen doping types in carbon materials can be dominated as pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N, respectively. The proportion of distinct doped nitrogen species in carbon depends on the acidity and basicity of the compounded metal oxide host. The SA Cu catalyst with predominant pyrrolic-N coordination displays an enhanced activity for the hydrogenation of quinoline, providing the target product tetrahydroquinoline with high selectivity under mild conditions. The higher electron density of SA Cu species induced by the pyrrolic-N coordination benefits the hydrogen transfer process and reduces the energy barrier of the hydrogenation pathway, leading to improved catalytic efficiency.
