[1] "In this work, through the controllable pyrrolic-N coordination, the SA Cu catalyst realizes the hydrogenation of quinolines in 99% selectivity under mild conditions (60 oC for 2 h) with ammonia-borane (AB) as the hydrogen source."
[2] "The notable improved activity of Cu1/CN/TiO2 in contrast to Cu1/CN/Al2O3 can be ascribed to different doped N species in two catalysts for their active sites being Cu-Nx structure."
[3] "According to the Bader charge analysis, the charge on the Cu species is 0.712 e in the pyridinic-N coordination, which is higher than that in the pyrrolic-N coordination (0.655 e), illustrating the higher electron density of the Cu species in the latter."
[4] "Therefore, the higher electron density of Cu species resulted from the pyrrolic-N coordination is apparently beneficial to this process."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The activity of the SA Cu catalyst is improved when it is coordinated with pyrrolic-N instead of pyridinic-N. This is because the pyrrolic-N coordination increases the electron density of the Cu species, which facilitates the hydrogen transfer process from the hydrogen source and reduces the energy barrier in the hydrogenation pathway, thus enhancing the catalytic efficiency.

当SA Cu催化剂与吡咯型氮配位时，其活性得到提高。这是因为吡咯型氮配位能够增加Cu物种的电子密度，从而促进氢供体的氢转移过程并降低氢化途径的能量壁垒，因此提高了催化效率。
