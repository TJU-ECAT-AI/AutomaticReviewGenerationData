[1] "The graphene islands,formed during the initial nucleation process611, are crucial in the mechanism of graphene growth and determine the quality of the grown graphene by functioning either as nucleation seeds6,12,13 or as building blocks for the coalescence of graphene nano-islands9."
[2] "The growth of graphene on copper surface is a surface-mediated process due to the very low solubility of carbon in bulk Cu24,34,35."
[3] "It was found to be energetically favorable for graphene islands to sink into soft metals like Cu (111), during the growth of graphene33."
[4] "As shown in Fig. 4a, c, the rotation angles on the semi-molten surface at 1350 and 1400 K present narrow distributions only at 0 and 60,respectively."
[5] "Very surprisingly, as shown in Fig. 6aj, the metal step (yellow atoms),which is clamped by the two GNR edges, disappears with the stitching of graphene (red carbons) and a near perfect graphene sheet is eventually formed with only one 57 defect left."

1. Graphene islands play a critical role in the growth mechanism of graphene, serving as either nucleation seeds or building blocks for the coalescence of graphene nano-islands. Their quality significantly influences the final graphene product.
2. The growth of graphene on a copper surface is primarily influenced by the surface, due to the low solubility of carbon in the bulk copper material.
3. During the growth of graphene, it is energetically favorable for graphene islands to sink into soft metals, such as Cu(111).
4. On a semi-molten copper surface, the rotation angles of carbon clusters exhibit a narrow distribution, concentrated at 0 and 60 degrees.
5. During the stitching process of graphene nanoribbons, metal steps, which initially act as clamps, disappear, resulting in a nearly perfect graphene sheet with only a minor defect.

1. 石墨烯岛在石墨烯生长机制中起着关键作用，既可以作为核化种子也可以作为石墨烯纳米岛聚合的构建块。它们的质量对最终的石墨烯产品有显著影响。
2. 石墨烯在铜表面的生长主要受表面的影响，因为碳在铜基体中的溶解度非常低。
3. 在石墨烯生长过程中，石墨烯岛屿倾向于在软金属（如Cu(111)）中下沉，这是能量上有利的。
4. 在半熔融铜表面上，碳簇的旋转角度呈现狭窄分布，集中在0和60度。
5. 在石墨烯纳米带的拼接过程中，最初作为钳子的金属步骤消失，最终形成几乎完美的石墨烯片，仅有一个小缺陷。
