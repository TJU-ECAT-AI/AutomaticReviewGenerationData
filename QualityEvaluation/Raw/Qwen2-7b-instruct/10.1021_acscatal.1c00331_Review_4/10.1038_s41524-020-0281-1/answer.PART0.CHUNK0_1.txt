[1] "In previous studies, large SCG was realized by the seamless stitching of highly oriented islands on single-crystal substrate,such as Cu(111)14 and Ge (110)15. Most recently, ultra-fast growth of meter-sized SCG has been achieved by producing super-large Cu (111) foil16."
[2] "The graphene islands,formed during the initial nucleation process611, are crucial in the mechanism of graphene growth and determine the quality of the grown graphene by functioning either as nucleation seeds6,12,13 or as building blocks for the coalescence of graphene nano-islands9."
[3] "Thus, the orientation of the C24 on semi-molten substrate showed a narrow distribution with the rotation angle concentrating around 0 and 60 owing to the specific sunken-mode and the lattice symmetry of unmolten Cu layers."
[4] "For graphene nanoribbons, the sunken-mode II was preferred. They also present arched or flattened shapes depending on the metal steps formed."
[5] "These metal steps, surprisingly, can assist in defects healing during the seamless stitching of graphene nanoribbons instead of creating defects."
[6] "This study serves to deepen our physical insights into the CVD growth of graphene on semi-molten Cu substrates and explains multiple experimental mysteries."
[7] "The energies listed in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 are the calculated formation energies of the benchmark structures."
[8] "Moreover, to further verify the results of classical MD simulations, DFT-MD simulations were also carried out for comparison with the calculation details presented in the Supplementary Methods."

In the context of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of graphene on copper substrates, the literature discusses the importance of graphene islands in the growth mechanism, their role as nucleation seeds or building blocks, and the impact of the semi-molten state of the copper substrate on the growth process. Specifically, it highlights the formation of large single-crystalline graphene (SCG) through the seamless stitching of graphene islands on single-crystal substrates like copper (Cu) and germanium (Ge). The literature also delves into the dynamics of carbon nanoclusters and graphene nanoribbons on the semi-molten copper surface, noting that the orientation of these structures is influenced by the specific sunken-mode and the lattice symmetry of the unmolten copper layers. Furthermore, the study elucidates the role of metal steps in assisting in defect healing during the stitching process of graphene nanoribbons, offering insights into the physical mechanisms underlying the growth of graphene on semi-molten copper substrates. The research employs both classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) methods to validate the findings, providing a comprehensive understanding of the CVD growth process.
