[1] "Following its first preparation by exfoliation from graphite in 2004,graphene has attracted much attention both for fundamental studies and technological applications, owing to its unique morphology and excellent mechanical, electronic and optical properties."
[2] "It is expected that wafer-scale single-crystalline graphene films will function as ideal platforms for the develop-ment of future high-performance graphene-based devices1."
[3] "Consequently, great efforts have been made to synthesize large single-crystalline graphene (SCG) monolayers24 on transition metal catalyst through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth the most promising, cheap and readily accessible synthetic approach so far reported for graphene5."
[4] "For instance,based on density- functional molecular dynamics simulations, the very intricate pathways of reaction for metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of AlN on graphene can be identified at the atomic level with rich chemistry uncovered23."
[5] "Unexpected defects such as pentagons usually appear during the nucleation stage and degrade the final quality of CVD-grown graphene."
[6] "To circumvent the formation of these detrimental defects created during the initial stages of growth, defect-free polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs consisting of six-membered carbon rings) have been proposed as ideal precursors for the fabrication of graphene with low defect concentration, on Au (111)24, Pt (111)25 and Cu (111)26."
[7] "Among these different carbonaceous motifs,the coronene-like cluster, C24, is widely regarded as the ideal carbon precursor for the growth of high-quality graphene by self-assembly on a Cu (111) surface27,28 due to its six-fold rotation symmetry and dome-shaped structure, a result of the interaction of the peripheral atoms of the carbon cluster with the substrate metal2931."
[8] "Although it is widely believed that these active carbon species readily move on the metal surface, coalescing into larger islands, and eventually forming the final graphene domain27,32,the motion and coalescence dynamics at the atomic level of these carbon islands still remain elusive."
[9] "For example, based on static DFT calculations, a new growth mode called embedded growth,has recently been proposed. In the embedded mode, it was found to be energetically favorable for graphene islands to sink into soft metals like Cu (111), during the growth of graphene33."
[10] "Different from that on nickel surface, the growth of graphene on copper surface is a surface-mediated process due to the very low solubility of carbon in bulk Cu24,34,35."
[11] "Thus the Cu surface is thought to be nearly molten or liquid and can never be considered as a strict crystalline lattice as before38."
[12] "In this article, based on a self-developed CCu classical potential and density functional theory, MD simulations were performed to study the sinking of the graphene on a semi- molten Cu substrate."
[13] "Two different sunken-modes, which depend on graphene island size, were revealed. Further, the embedded graphene tends to be unidirectionally aligned and the seamless stitching of the adjacent graphene grains is preferred."

Graphene has been widely recognized for its unique properties, leading to extensive research in both fundamental studies and technology applications. Efforts have been made to synthesize large single-crystalline graphene monolayers through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth, which is the most promising and accessible method. However, defects, such as pentagons appearing during the nucleation stage, can degrade the quality of CVD-grown graphene. To mitigate this issue, defect-free precursors like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been suggested for graphene fabrication. Among these, the coronene-like cluster, C24, is considered an ideal precursor for graphene growth due to its six-fold rotation symmetry and dome-shaped structure. The dynamics of motion and coalescence at the atomic level of carbon islands remain unclear, but recent studies propose that graphene islands can sink into soft metals like Cu (111) during growth, a process influenced by the low solubility of carbon in bulk Cu. This study investigates the sinking of graphene on a semi-molten Cu substrate using classical MD simulations, revealing two distinct sunken-modes depending on the graphene island size, with the embedded graphene tending to be unidirectionally aligned and facilitating the seamless stitching of adjacent graphene grains.

石墨烯因其独特的性质，在基础研究和技术应用领域受到了广泛认可。人们致力于通过化学气相沉积（CVD）生长方法合成大面积单晶石墨烯单层，这是迄今为止最有效、成本最低且易于获取的石墨烯合成途径。然而，生长过程中出现的缺陷，如核化阶段产生的五边形结构，会降低CVD生长石墨烯的质量。为解决这一问题，人们提出了无缺陷的多环芳烃（PAHs，由六个碳原子组成的环状结构）作为低缺陷浓度的石墨烯制备前体，适用于Au（111）、Pt（111）和Cu（111）表面。其中，冠醚类簇体C24因其六轴旋转对称性和与基底金属相互作用形成的穹形结构而被视为在Cu（111）表面自组装生长高质量石墨烯的理想前体。碳岛的运动和聚合在原子水平上的动态仍然难以捉摸，但最近的研究表明，在铜（111）表面生长石墨烯时，碳岛可以通过嵌入方式下沉，这是一个受碳在纯铜中极低溶解度影响的表面介导过程。本文基于CCu经典势函数和密度泛函理论，通过分子动力学模拟研究了石墨烯在半熔融铜基质上的沉降现象，揭示了依赖于石墨烯岛屿大小的两种不同沉降模式，并发现嵌入的石墨烯倾向于单向排列，促进相邻石墨烯颗粒的无缝缝合。
