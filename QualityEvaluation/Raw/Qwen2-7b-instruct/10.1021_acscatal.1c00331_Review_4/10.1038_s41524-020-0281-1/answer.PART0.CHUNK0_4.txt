1. Large single-crystalline graphene (SCG) was previously achieved through the seamless stitching of highly oriented islands on single-crystal substrates like Cu(111) and Ge(110).

2. Ultra-fast growth of meter-sized SCG has been accomplished using large Cu(111) foil.

3. Graphene islands play a crucial role in the growth mechanism of graphene, serving as either nucleation seeds or building blocks for the coalescence of graphene nano-islands.

4. In the study, the top layer Cu atoms melt while other layers remain crystalline, creating a state between liquid and solid.

5. At 1350 K, the substrate becomes disordered, and the C24 cluster starts to sink into it.

6. The sinking mechanism observed at higher temperatures is referred to as sunken-mode I.

7. Larger carbon nanoclusters tend to prefer the sunken-mode II, where only the carbon edges are embedded in the underlying semi-molten substrate.

8. The orientation of the C24 cluster significantly depends on the surface state of the metal catalyst at varying temperatures.

9. During the stitching process, metal steps are unexpectedly eliminated, leading to the formation of a nearly perfect graphene sheet with minimal defects.

1. 在之前的研究所中，通过在单晶基底上无缝缝合高定向岛屿实现了大型单晶石墨烯（SCG），例如Cu(111)和Ge(110)。

2. 最近，通过使用超大Cu(111)箔实现了超快生长的米级SCG。

3. 石墨烯岛在石墨烯生长机制中的作用至关重要，既可以作为核化种子，也可以作为纳米岛石墨烯融合的构建块。

4. 在研究中，顶层Cu原子熔化而其他层保持结晶状态，形成液态和固态之间的状态。

5. 当温度接近1350 K时，基质变得无序，并且C24开始向基质中下沉。

6. 在更高温度下观察到的下沉机制被称为下沉模式I。

7. 更大的碳纳米簇倾向于选择下沉模式II，在这种模式下，只有碳边缘嵌入在底层半熔融基质中。

8. C24簇的取向显著取决于金属催化剂表面状态在不同温度下的变化。

9. 在缝合过程中，金属步骤意外消失，导致形成几乎没有缺陷的几乎完美的石墨烯片。
