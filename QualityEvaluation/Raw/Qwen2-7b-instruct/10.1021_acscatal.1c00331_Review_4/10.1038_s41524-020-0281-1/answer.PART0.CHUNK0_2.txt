[1] "Following its first preparation by exfoliation from graphite in 2004,graphene has attracted much attention both for fundamental studies and technological applications, owing to its unique morphology and excellent mechanical, electronic and optical properties."
[2] "It is expected that wafer-scale single-crystalline graphene films will function as ideal platforms for the develop- ment of future high-performance graphene-based devices1."
[3] "Among these different carbonaceous motifs,the coronene-like cluster, C24, is widely regarded as the ideal carbon precursor for the growth of high-quality graphene by self-assembly on a Cu (111) surface27,28 due to its six-fold rotation symmetry and dome-shaped structure, a result of the interaction of the peripheral atoms of the carbon cluster with the substrate metal2931."
[4] "Thus, the Cu surface is thought to be nearly molten or liquid and can never be considered as a strict crystalline lattice as before38."
[5] "Clearly, the former pathway is the dominant sunk mechanism at high temperatures 1350 K."
[6] "Unlike C24, the C54 did not sink into the substrate but just float on the substrate surface at 1350 K."
[7] "The distribution of the rotation angle for C24 also depends strongly on the surface state."
[8] "Very surprisingly, as shown in Fig. 6aj, the metal step (yellow atoms),which is clamped by the two GNR edges, disappears with the stitching of graphene (red carbons) and a near perfect graphene sheet is eventually formed with only one 57 defect left."

The document primarily discusses the synthesis of graphene using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on copper substrates. It explains that graphene islands, formed during the initial nucleation process, play a crucial role in the growth mechanism and quality of the grown graphene. The study highlights the importance of controlling the orientation of these islands for synthesizing high-quality graphene, particularly large single-crystalline graphene (SCG) monolayers. It also investigates the sinking kinetics of carbon clusters and graphene nanoribbons on semi-molten copper surfaces, revealing two different sunken modes depending on the size of the cluster. The study further explores the role of metal steps in the stitching process of graphene nanoribbons, demonstrating their ability to assist in defect healing. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of CVD growth processes and provide theoretical references for the controlled synthesis of large single-crystalline graphene.

The document does not provide information on the evolution of understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts, the challenges associated with it, or strategies to address these challenges. It focuses on the synthesis and growth of graphene, particularly on copper substrates, and does not discuss coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts.
