[1] "The development of SACs is remarkable in recent years, and the emphasis on the coordination environment of SACs provided new opportunities for further improvement of their catalytic properties."
[2] "In most reported SACs, metal atoms usually are chemically anchored on the support materials, which could directly influence the stability and catalytic performance of center metal atoms."
[3] "Compared to the aforementioned coordination of first-shell atoms, the second- and higher-shell atoms could also influence the catalytic abilities of central metal atoms."
[4] "The detailed characterizations of the coordination environment of SACs are still not satisfactory for complicated cases, such as dual-metal sites SACs and multi-shell coordinated SACs."
[5] "To date, the characterizations of coordination environments and related charge transfer during the catalytic process were mainly dependent on theoretical modelings."
[6] "New SACs with precisely designed coordination environments might exhibit novel catalytic performance."
[7] "For example, additional coordination of center atoms by some specific element at higher shells (such as S, Se, P, etc.) might increase the stability of SACs without loss of catalytic activity."
[8] "A slightly mediated coordination of center atoms could increase the dynamic activity, which might increase the catalytic activity and meanwhile maintained high stability due to the structure flexibility."
[9] "The strategies on modulating the coordination environments of SACs could provide new opportunities to synthesize SACs on a large scale."
