[1] "The development of SACs is remarkable in recent years, and the emphasis on the coordination environment of SACs provided new opportunities for further improvement of their catalytic properties."
[2] "The electronic and geometric structures of central metal atoms could be adjustable by tailoring the coordination environment, which would change the absorption activity of reactants on metal atoms and thus influence the catalytic properties."
[3] "Tailoring the coordination atoms, coordination number, and second- or higher-coordination shells could significantly influence the electronic and geometric structures of central metal atoms."
[4] "Though SACs exhibited high catalytic performance in many reactions, further improvement by coordination tailoring could be effective and applicable."

1. Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize its impact on catalytic performance, with the primary challenge being the irreversible build-up of carbonaceous deposits that can lead to decreased activity and selectivity. Strategies to address this include:

   - Prevention methods: These involve modifying the catalyst formulation to reduce the tendency of coke deposition. For example, using noble metals or promoters that inhibit coke formation.
   
   - Novel catalyst designs: Researchers develop new catalyst structures that enhance dispersion of the active phase or incorporate materials that can remove coke more efficiently. This might involve creating catalysts with high surface areas or incorporating materials like carbon or metal-organic frameworks that can adsorb and degrade coke precursors.

   - Regeneration techniques: These focus on removing deposited coke from the catalyst to restore its activity. Techniques may include thermal or chemical treatments, where the catalyst is exposed to high temperatures or chemicals that can burn off or dissolve the coke.

2. Various strategies to address coke deposition challenges include:
   - Prevention methods such as modifying the catalyst formulation to reduce coke formation.
   - Novel catalyst designs that enhance dispersion or incorporate materials to remove coke more efficiently.
   - Regeneration techniques involving thermal or chemical treatments to restore catalyst activity.
