The coordination environment of single-atom catalysts (SACs) has been emphasized to improve their catalytic properties. The coordination number and coordination atoms play significant roles in influencing the electronic and geometric structures of central metal atoms. Modulating the coordination environment offers new opportunities for enhancing the performance of SACs. Strategies to tailor the coordination environment could also enable the large-scale synthesis of SACs.
