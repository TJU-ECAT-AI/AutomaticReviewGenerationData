[4] "In an etching process, most kinks nucleation events started from the corners of the islands, which is as easy as the kink propagation. Therefore, the etching rate is mainly contributed by the concentration of kinks at the edge and the whole circumference will be evolved into a shape enclosed by edges with highest kink density."

To understand the kinetics of graphene growth, large-scale atomic simulations of graphene islands evolving up to macro sizes are crucial. These simulations can reproduce the experimentally observed evolution of graphene islands during both growth and etching on Pt(111) surfaces, revealing more atomic details. Our study introduces a complementary principle of graphene growth and etching, where the growth and etching of a graphene island and a hole in graphene are complementary. This principle can be applied to the growth and etching of all 2D materials, providing insights into their growth mechanisms. During etching, the rate is influenced by the concentration of kinks at the edges, leading to a shape evolution that is primarily determined by the edges with the highest kink density.

Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly over time, with a focus on identifying and mitigating the primary challenges associated with this phenomenon. Challenges include the accumulation of coke, which reduces catalyst activity and selectivity, leading to decreased efficiency and increased costs. Various strategies to address these challenges include:

1. Prevention methods: These aim to reduce coke formation by altering reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios, to minimize the formation of coke precursors. Catalyst design modifications, such as incorporating promoters or using specific metal combinations, can also prevent coke buildup.

2. Novel catalyst designs: Advanced catalyst designs often incorporate features like enhanced surface area, controlled pore structures, or multi-metallic compositions to improve resistance to coke deposition. These designs aim to maintain high activity and stability under operating conditions that favor coke formation.

3. Regeneration techniques: When coke deposition occurs, catalyst regeneration processes are employed to remove coke from the catalyst surface, restoring its activity. Techniques include thermal regeneration, chemical regeneration, or combination methods that use both thermal and chemical treatments.

These strategies have proven effective in enhancing catalyst performance and reducing operational costs. However, significant obstacles remain, particularly in developing catalysts that exhibit exceptional long-term stability and activity under harsh operating conditions. Further research is required to optimize catalyst formulations, improve process conditions, and develop more efficient regeneration methods to address these challenges.

在铂基催化剂中焦炭沉积的理解已经显著发展，重点是识别和减轻与这种现象相关的首要挑战。主要挑战包括焦炭积累，这会降低催化剂活性和选择性，导致效率下降和成本增加。应对这些挑战的策略包括：

1. 预防方法：这些方法通过改变反应条件（如温度、压力和反应物比例）来减少焦炭前体的形成，从而减少焦炭沉积。催化剂设计的修改，例如引入促进剂或使用特定的金属组合，也可以防止焦炭积累。

2. 新型催化剂设计：先进的催化剂设计通常包含增强表面积、控制孔结构或多金属组合等特征，以提高对焦炭沉积的抵抗力。这些设计旨在在有利于焦炭形成的条件下保持高活性和稳定性。

3. 再生技术：当发生焦炭沉积时，采用再生过程从催化剂表面去除焦炭，恢复其活性。技术包括热再生、化学再生或结合热和化学处理的方法。

这些策略在提高催化剂性能和减少运营成本方面已被证明有效。然而，仍然存在显著的障碍，特别是开发能够在苛刻操作条件下表现出卓越长期稳定性和活性的催化剂。需要进一步研究优化催化剂配方、改进操作条件和开发更高效的再生方法来解决这些挑战。

[1] "Theoretically, the kinetics of graphene growth or etching has been understood based on the theory of kink nucleation and propagation34,38, in which kink nucleation at an armchair (AC) or zigzag (ZZ) edge is considered as the threshold step of edge propagation, and the existing kinks propagate rather fast."
[2] "To fully understand the kinetics of graphene growth, large-scale atomic simulations of graphene islands evolution up to macro sizes (i.e., graphene islands of a few micrometers or with billions of carbon atoms) during growth and etching is essential, but remains a great challenge."
[3] "The complementary relation brings us a basic principle to understand the growth and etching of graphene, and other 2D materials from atomic scale to macro size and the KMC algorithm is expected to be further developed into a standard simulation package for investigating the growth mechanism of 2D materials on various substrates."
[4] "The complementary relationship of graphene growth and etchingthe route of graphene island shape evolution during growth is exactly the same as that of the etching of a hole in graphene and that of graphene island etching is exactly same as that of hole growth."

This study introduces a large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method to simulate the growth and etching of graphene islands and holes in graphene. The method allows for large-scale simulations that preserve atomic details, enabling the exploration of graphene evolution up to tens of micrometers in size. The simulations reproduce the experimentally observed evolution of graphene islands during both growth and etching on a Pt(111) surface, revealing more atomic-level insights into the growth and etching processes. A significant finding is the discovery of a complementary relationship between graphene growth and etching. Specifically, the study shows that the shape evolution of a graphene island during growth mirrors the etching of a hole in graphene, and conversely, the etching of a graphene island parallels the growth of a hole. This complementary principle offers a fundamental understanding of the growth and etching mechanisms in graphene and potentially extends to other 2D materials.

The KMC algorithm developed in this research is anticipated to be further refined into a standard simulation tool for investigating the growth dynamics of 2D materials on various substrates. This method could facilitate the precise understanding of growth and etching processes across different scales, from atomic to macroscopic, and provide a theoretical foundation for comprehending the relationships between material growth and etching.

在此研究中开发的KMC算法有望进一步完善为用于各种基底上二维材料生长动态标准模拟工具。这种方法有可能促进不同尺度（从原子到宏观）之间生长和蚀刻过程的精确理解，并为材料生长与蚀刻之间的关系提供理论基础。
