[1] "In order to fully understand the kinetics of graphene growth, large-scale atomic simulations of graphene islands evolution up to macro sizes (i.e., graphene islands of a few micrometers or with billions of carbon atoms) during growth and etching is essential, but remains a great challenge."
[2] "With this approach and the carefully fitted parameters, we have reproduced the experimentally observed evolution of graphene islands during both growth or etching on Pt(111) surface, and revealed more atomic details of graphene growth and etching."
[3] "Our study reveals a very important complementary principle of graphene growth and etching. Besides, our algorithm is efficient in the scale of experimental observations and each event has a clear physical meaning, which are very beneficial for understanding the mechanisms of the growth and etching of 2D materials precisely."
[4] "In an etching process, most kinks nucleation events started from the corners of the islands, which is as easy as the kink propagation. Therefore, the etching rate is mainly contributed by the concentration of kinks at the edge and the whole circumference will be evolved into a shape enclosed by edges with highest kink density."

To understand the kinetics of graphene growth, large-scale atomic simulations of graphene islands evolving up to macro sizes are crucial. These simulations can reproduce the experimentally observed evolution of graphene islands during both growth and etching on Pt(111) surfaces, revealing more atomic details. Our study introduces a complementary principle of graphene growth and etching, where the growth and etching of a graphene island and a hole in graphene are complementary. This principle can be applied to the growth and etching of all 2D materials, providing insights into their growth mechanisms. During etching, the rate is influenced by the concentration of kinks at the edges, leading to a shape evolution that is primarily determined by the edges with the highest kink density.

为了理解石墨烯生长的动力学，需要进行大尺度原子模拟，以观察石墨烯岛在微米级甚至数十亿个碳原子数量级下的生长和蚀刻过程。这些模拟可以重现实验观察到的石墨烯岛在Pt（111）表面的生长或蚀刻过程，并揭示更多的原子细节。我们的研究引入了一种石墨烯生长和蚀刻之间的互补原则，即石墨烯岛的生长和石墨烯中的孔蚀刻是互补的。这一原则可以应用于所有二维材料的生长和蚀刻，为了解它们的生长机制提供了见解。在蚀刻过程中，速率主要受到边缘上晶核浓度的影响，导致形状演化的方向主要由具有最高晶核密度的边缘决定。
