[1] "The order-N algorithm allows us to explore the graphene growth up to the size of tens of μm with a single CPU core, and to reveal the morphology evolution of a graphene island as the dimension crossing many orders of magnitude, from a single hexagon to that with billions of atoms."
[2] "The complementary relationship of graphene growth and etching—the route of graphene island shape evolution during growth is exactly the same as that of the etching of a hole in graphene and that of graphene island etching is exactly same as that of hole growth."
[3] "The lateral size of a hexagonal graphene island as a function of the simulation time is presented in Fig. 3c, d. It is found that the size of the graphene increases exponentially with the growth time, which implies that the island grows faster and faster or the growth rate is size dependent."

Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly over time, with a focus on identifying and mitigating the primary challenges associated with this phenomenon. Challenges include the accumulation of coke, which reduces catalyst activity and selectivity, leading to decreased efficiency and increased costs. Various strategies to address these challenges include:

1. Prevention methods: These aim to reduce coke formation by altering reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios, to minimize the formation of coke precursors. Catalyst design modifications, such as incorporating promoters or using specific metal combinations, can also prevent coke buildup.

2. Novel catalyst designs: Advanced catalyst designs often incorporate features like enhanced surface area, controlled pore structures, or multi-metallic compositions to improve resistance to coke deposition. These designs aim to maintain high activity and stability under operating conditions that favor coke formation.

3. Regeneration techniques: When coke deposition occurs, catalyst regeneration processes are employed to remove coke from the catalyst surface, restoring its activity. Techniques include thermal regeneration, chemical regeneration, or combination methods that use both thermal and chemical treatments.

These strategies have proven effective in enhancing catalyst performance and reducing operational costs. However, significant obstacles remain, particularly in developing catalysts that exhibit exceptional long-term stability and activity under harsh operating conditions. Further research is required to optimize catalyst formulations, improve process conditions, and develop more efficient regeneration methods to address these challenges.

在铂基催化剂中焦炭沉积的理解已经显著发展，重点是识别和减轻与这种现象相关的首要挑战。主要挑战包括焦炭积累，这会降低催化剂活性和选择性，导致效率下降和成本增加。应对这些挑战的策略包括：

1. 预防方法：这些方法通过改变反应条件（如温度、压力和反应物比例）来减少焦炭前体的形成，从而减少焦炭沉积。催化剂设计的修改，例如引入促进剂或使用特定的金属组合，也可以防止焦炭积累。

2. 新型催化剂设计：先进的催化剂设计通常包含增强表面积、控制孔结构或多金属组合等特征，以提高对焦炭沉积的抵抗力。这些设计旨在在有利于焦炭形成的条件下保持高活性和稳定性。

3. 再生技术：当发生焦炭沉积时，采用再生过程从催化剂表面去除焦炭，恢复其活性。技术包括热再生、化学再生或结合热和化学处理的方法。

这些策略在提高催化剂性能和减少运营成本方面已被证明有效。然而，仍然存在显著的障碍，特别是开发能够在苛刻操作条件下表现出卓越长期稳定性和活性的催化剂。需要进一步研究优化催化剂配方、改进操作条件和开发更高效的再生方法来解决这些挑战。
