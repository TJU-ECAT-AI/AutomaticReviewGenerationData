[1] "To fully understand the kinetics of graphene growth, large-scale atomic simulations of graphene islands evolution up to macro sizes (i.e., graphene islands of a few micrometers or with billions of carbon atoms) during growth and etching is essential, but remains a great challenge."
[2] "Based on the atomic simulations, we discovered a complementary relationship of graphene growth and etching—the route of graphene island shape evolution during growth is exactly the same as that of the etching of a hole in graphene and that of graphene island etching is exactly same as that of hole growth."
[3] "Our study reveals a very important complementary principle of graphene growth and etching. Besides, our algorithm is efficient in the scale of experimental observations and each event has a clear physical meaning, which are very beneficial for understanding the mechanisms of the growth and etching of 2D materials precisely."

The research introduces a large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method for simulating the growth and etching of graphene islands. It discovers a complementary relationship between graphene growth and etching. The shape evolution of a graphene island during growth mirrors the etching of a hole in graphene, and vice versa. This discovery provides a fundamental principle for understanding the growth and etching of graphene and potentially other two-dimensional materials.

研究引入了一种用于模拟石墨烯岛生长和蚀刻的大规模动力学蒙特卡罗（KMC）方法。它发现了石墨烯生长和蚀刻之间的互补关系。石墨烯岛在生长过程中的形状演变与石墨烯中的孔蚀刻相同，反之亦然。这一发现为理解石墨烯和其他二维材料的生长和蚀刻提供了基本原理。
