[1] "Theoretically, the kinetics of graphene growth or etching has been understood based on the theory of kink nucleation and propagation34,38, in which kink nucleation at an armchair (AC) or zigzag (ZZ) edge is considered as the threshold step of edge propagation, and the existing kinks propagate rather fast."
[2] "To fully understand the kinetics of graphene growth, large-scale atomic simulations of graphene islands evolution up to macro sizes (i.e., graphene islands of a few micrometers or with billions of carbon atoms) during growth and etching is essential, but remains a great challenge."
[3] "The complementary relation brings us a basic principle to understand the growth and etching of graphene, and other 2D materials from atomic scale to macro size and the KMC algorithm is expected to be further developed into a standard simulation package for investigating the growth mechanism of 2D materials on various substrates."
[4] "The complementary relationship of graphene growth and etchingthe route of graphene island shape evolution during growth is exactly the same as that of the etching of a hole in graphene and that of graphene island etching is exactly same as that of hole growth."

This study introduces a large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method to simulate the growth and etching of graphene islands and holes in graphene. The method allows for large-scale simulations that preserve atomic details, enabling the exploration of graphene evolution up to tens of micrometers in size. The simulations reproduce the experimentally observed evolution of graphene islands during both growth and etching on a Pt(111) surface, revealing more atomic-level insights into the growth and etching processes. A significant finding is the discovery of a complementary relationship between graphene growth and etching. Specifically, the study shows that the shape evolution of a graphene island during growth mirrors the etching of a hole in graphene, and conversely, the etching of a graphene island parallels the growth of a hole. This complementary principle offers a fundamental understanding of the growth and etching mechanisms in graphene and potentially extends to other 2D materials.

The KMC algorithm developed in this research is anticipated to be further refined into a standard simulation tool for investigating the growth dynamics of 2D materials on various substrates. This method could facilitate the precise understanding of growth and etching processes across different scales, from atomic to macroscopic, and provide a theoretical foundation for comprehending the relationships between material growth and etching.

这项研究引入了一种大规模动力学蒙特卡洛（KMC）方法，用于模拟石墨烯岛和石墨烯中空洞的生长和蚀刻。该方法允许进行大规模模拟，同时保留原子细节，从而能够探索石墨烯在数十微米大小范围内的演变。模拟结果重现了在Pt(111)表面上石墨烯岛在生长和蚀刻过程中的实验观察，揭示了更多关于生长和蚀刻过程的原子级见解。一个显著发现是发现了石墨烯生长与蚀刻之间的互补关系。具体来说，研究表明，在生长过程中石墨烯岛形状的演化与石墨烯中空洞的蚀刻完全相同，反之亦然。蚀刻过程中的石墨烯岛与形成空洞的过程相呼应，而生长过程中的石墨烯岛则与空洞的形成过程相呼应。这种互补原理为理解石墨烯和其他二维材料的生长和蚀刻机制提供了基本原则，并且可以扩展到其他三维材料。

在此研究中开发的KMC算法有望进一步完善为用于各种基底上二维材料生长动态标准模拟工具。这种方法有可能促进不同尺度（从原子到宏观）之间生长和蚀刻过程的精确理解，并为材料生长与蚀刻之间的关系提供理论基础。
