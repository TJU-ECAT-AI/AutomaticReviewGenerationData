[1] "In real experiments, by tuning the experimental parameters, such as concentrations of carbon precursor and carrier gases, temperature, substrate type, and morphology, graphene islands of various shapes have been broadly observed."
[2] "To fully understand the kinetics of graphene growth, large-scale atomic simulations of graphene islands evolution up to macro sizes (i.e., graphene islands of a few micrometers or with billions of carbon atoms) during growth and etching is essential, but remains a great challenge."
[3] "The order-N algorithm allows us to explore the graphene growth up to the size of tens of μm with a single CPU core, and to reveal the morphology evolution of a graphene island as the dimension crossing many orders of magnitude, from a single hexagon to that with billions of atoms."
[4] "With the developed KMC algorithm and fitted parameters, now lets simulate the evolution of graphene islands and holes in graphene on Pt(111) surface during both growth and etching processes, respectively."
[5] "Such a principle can be easily extended to understand the growth and etching of other 2D and 3D materials, which provide a theoretical basis to understand the relationship of materials growth and etching."
