The understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize it as a critical issue due to the accumulation of coke, leading to decreased efficiency. Prevention methods involve additives or modifications to the catalyst composition to reduce coke formation. Novel catalyst designs emphasize improving thermal stability and resistance to coke buildup. Regeneration techniques are employed to restore activity by cleaning the catalyst. While effectiveness depends on specific conditions and catalyst type, challenges remain in finding universally effective solutions that maintain performance over time.
