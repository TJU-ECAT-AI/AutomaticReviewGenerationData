How has our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts evolved?
Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has significantly evolved over the years, primarily due to advancements in materials science and catalysis research. This evolution has led to a deeper insight into the mechanisms of coke formation and the development of strategies to prevent or mitigate its effects on catalyst performance.

What are the primary challenges associated with coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts?
The primary challenge associated with coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts is its detrimental effect on the catalyst's activity and selectivity, leading to decreased efficiency in chemical reactions. Coke buildup can significantly reduce the surface area available for reaction, thereby impairing the catalyst's performance.

How do various strategies address the challenges of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts?
Various strategies, including prevention methods, novel catalyst designs, and regeneration techniques, address the challenges of coke deposition. Prevention methods involve adding promoters or modifying the catalyst structure to enhance its resistance against coke formation. Novel catalyst designs, such as the use of support materials and metal alloys, aim to improve the catalyst's stability and resistance to coke buildup. Additionally, regeneration techniques, including thermal and chemical treatments, are employed to restore catalyst activity, though they may not completely eliminate coke formation.
