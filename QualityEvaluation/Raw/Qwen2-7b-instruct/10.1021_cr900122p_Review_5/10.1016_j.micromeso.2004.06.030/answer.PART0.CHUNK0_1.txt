[1] "Ordered mesoporous catalysts could open the door for new catalytic processes, based partly on novel principles, owing to their hitherto unprecedented intrinsic features."
[2] "Catalytic processes over such mesoporous materials, especially such reactions where the specific features of ordered mesoporous catalysts are exploited, are described in the second part."
[3] "These strategies and the essential properties of the resulting materials are described in the first part of this review."
[4] "The formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes) are discussed."
[5] "This factor contributes to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions."
