The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, linear alkane isomerization occurs through the formation of alkenes, which then undergo cyclization to form cyclic alkane. This process relies on the unique structure and properties of silica-supported tantalum hydrides, including the highly dispersed active sites and the ability to facilitate both acid and redox catalysis. The one-site scheme typically involves the direct transformation of linear alkane to cyclic alkane through the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the stability and reactivity of the alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, as well as the precise control of the local environment within the mesoporous material.

烷烃裂合催化由硅基支持的钽氢化物的全面机制涉及两站点和单站点方案。在两站点方案中，线性烷烃异构化通过形成烯烃发生，然后烯烃进行环化形成环烷烃。这一过程依赖于硅基支持的钽氢化物的独特结构和特性，包括高度分散的活性位点和能够促进酸性和氧化还原催化的能力。在各种烷烃转换中的催化剂选择性和性能受到诸如烯烃和金属环丁烷的稳定性和反应性的因素影响，以及在微孔材料内的局部环境的精确控制。
