The document discusses the potential of ordered mesoporous catalysts to open new doors in catalytic processes, based on their unique intrinsic features. It provides descriptions of synthesis strategies and the essential properties of these materials. Additionally, it delves into the catalytic processes over such mesoporous materials, particularly focusing on reactions that exploit the specific characteristics of ordered mesoporous catalysts. However, it does not provide a detailed analysis of the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, including the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates, or how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.
