The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the use of supported nanoparticles, particularly those containing tantalum hydrides, as catalysts. This type of catalysis exploits the unique properties of mesoporous materials, which offer high surface areas and controlled pore sizes, enhancing the efficiency of the alkane conversion process.

In the context of alkane metathesis, the catalyst enables the rearrangement of alkane molecules through the breaking and reformation of carbon-carbon bonds. The two-site and one-site schemes refer to the different mechanisms by which the catalyst facilitates the metathesis reaction. In the two-site scheme, two alkyl groups are transferred simultaneously, whereas in the one-site scheme, only one alkyl group is transferred at a time.

During the transformation of linear and cyclic alkane structures, the formation of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity and performance of the catalyst. Alkenes are often produced as a result of alkane metathesis, while metallacyclobutanes can serve as intermediates in the formation of more complex hydrocarbon structures.

The catalyst's performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors including the dispersion of the active sites, the presence of specific metals or metal species, and the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions. The silica support provides a stable matrix for the immobilization of the active tantalum hydride species, enabling efficient alkane metathesis while maintaining the structural integrity of the catalyst.

The specific details regarding the exact mechanisms, intermediates, and conditions for optimal performance would require a more detailed analysis of the literature, which is beyond the scope of this summary.

全面了解硅基钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的机制涉及使用包含钽氢化物的纳米粒子作为催化剂。这种类型的催化利用了介孔材料的独特性质，提供了高比表面积和可控孔径，从而提高了烷烃转化过程的效率。

在烷烃裂合的背景下，催化剂通过断裂和重新形成碳-碳键来促进反应。两站点方案和一站点方案分别指的是催化剂促进裂合反应的不同机制。在两站点方案中，两个烷基团同时被转移，而在一站点方案中，只转移一个烷基团。

在线性烷烃和环烷烃结构的转换过程中，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成对于确定催化剂的选择性和性能至关重要。烯烃通常作为烷烃裂合的结果产生，而金属环丁烷可以作为形成更复杂烃结构的中间体。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的表现受活性位点分散度、特定金属或金属物种的存在以及反应条件下催化剂稳定性的影响。硅支持提供了一个稳定的基质来固定活性钽氢化物种，从而实现高效的烷烃裂合，同时保持催化剂的结构完整性。

具体机制、中间体和最佳性能条件的详细信息需要对文献进行更详细的分析，这超出了本摘要的范围。

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, linear alkane isomerization occurs through the formation of alkenes, which then undergo cyclization to form cyclic alkane. This process relies on the unique structure and properties of silica-supported tantalum hydrides, including the highly dispersed active sites and the ability to facilitate both acid and redox catalysis. The one-site scheme typically involves the direct transformation of linear alkane to cyclic alkane through the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the stability and reactivity of the alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, as well as the precise control of the local environment within the mesoporous material.
