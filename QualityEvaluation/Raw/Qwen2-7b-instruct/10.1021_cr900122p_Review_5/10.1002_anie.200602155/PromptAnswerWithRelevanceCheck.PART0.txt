[1] "Alkane conversion has been a major focus of petrochemical research for the past century,13 and in fact the discovery of olefin metathesis on supported MoO3 or WO3 systems by Banks and Bailey was the result of the investigation of the reactivity of alkane and olefin mixtures on such types of catalysts."
[2] "This discovery was rapidly turned into an alkane conversion process first by Banks (Philipps) and then by Hughes (Chevron)7,8 by combining heterogeneous dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and olefin metathesis catalysts, which allows a given alkane to be converted into its lower and higher homologues."
[3] "In 1997, within a research program targeted at the activation of CH bonds by supported transition-metal catalysts, J.-M. Basset et al. reported the conversion of alkanes at low temperatures and pressures, typically 150C and 1 bar, into their lower and higher homologues."
[4] "An important research effort in collaboration with BP Chemicals and BP has yielded numerous catalytic systems based on Group 5 and Group 6 hydride and alkyl systems,1113 and currently the best system is a W hydride supported on alumina (turnover number (TON)=120 after 120 h under ca. 0.8 bar of propane; Scheme 1b)."
[5] "Notably, the catalytic systems based on hydrides give better results under pressure and can be regenerated by treatment under H2."
[6] "Recent kinetic and mechanistic studies in our laboratories12,14 have shown that the key carboncarbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps correspond to those of olefin metathesis, that is, a [2+2] cycloreversion and a cycloaddition step."
[7] "The transformation of the alkane into an olefin and carbenic propagating species involves additional key elementary steps. It has been proposed that an alkyl species is formed by CH activation of alkanes, which, by a subsequent β-H or α-H transfer step, yields the olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis (Scheme 1c)."
[8] "The Ir catalyst precursors can be 1a, 1b, or 1c, but in each case, it is necessary to add an activator, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene (2 equiv), a well-known H2 scavenger,26,27 to the dihydrogen derivative."
[9] "The product distribution (all linear alkanes from C2C14) clearly indicates that the reaction corresponds to successive steps of dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation."
[10] "Moreover, one initiation product, 2-methyl-2-phenylbutane, which probably results from the cross-metathesis of the neophylidene Mo complex 2 and 1-hexene and subsequent hydrogenation, has been detected."
[11] "The product distribution is consistent with their formation through nearly a statistical metathesis of an equilibrated mixture of hexene isomers (internal olefins in greater amount than terminal ones leading to homologues of shorter chain lengths compared to those derived from the metathesis of terminal olefins)."
[12] "Finally, owing to the instability of 2, the combination of the Ir homogeneous catalyst with a heterogeneous olefin metathesis catalyst, Re2O7 on alumina, has also been investigated."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, the process involves the activation of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds in alkanes. This leads to the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. These intermediates play crucial roles in the transformation of linear and cyclic alkane structures through olefin metathesis. The formation of alkenes is a critical step as it provides the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis. The role of catalysts, specifically the silica-supported tantalum hydrides, is pivotal in facilitating these reactions at low temperatures and pressures, enabling efficient alkane conversion. The mechanism includes carbon-carbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps, characterized by a [2+2] cycloreversion and a cycloaddition, similar to olefin metathesis. The transformation of the alkane into an olefin and carbenic propagating species involves additional key elementary steps, including CH activation and subsequent β-H or α-H transfer steps. The catalyst system is capable of generating both alkenes and alkynes, which are essential intermediates for the formation of desired alkane products. The product distribution indicates that the reaction sequence involves successive steps of dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation, yielding a range of linear alkanes from C2 to C14. The detection of specific products, such as 2-methyl-2-phenylbutane, further supports the involvement of cross-metathesis and hydrogenation in the reaction pathway. The catalyst system's stability and regeneration capability under hydrogen treatment are important aspects that contribute to its performance in various alkane conversions.

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the activation of the carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds in alkanes to form an alkyl species. This species can undergo subsequent β-H or α-H transfer steps to yield the olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, serving as the propagating center for olefin metathesis. The formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes plays a crucial role in this process. Key intermediates include alkenes and hydridocarbene intermediates. The reaction pathway involves CH activation, dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation, contributing to the selectivity of alkane conversions.

Two-site and one-site schemes refer to the location of the catalyst within the reaction system. In a two-site scheme, the alkane conversion occurs across two distinct catalyst sites, whereas in a one-site scheme, the entire process takes place at a single catalyst site. The one-site scheme described here utilizes a single metal with all the necessary properties for alkane conversion, including CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation. This allows for the incorporation of methane into higher homologues.

A recent discovery involved a homogeneous catalytic system for alkane metathesis, which combines two catalysts for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and olefin metathesis. This system operates at low temperatures and pressures, enabling the conversion of alkanes into their lower and higher homologues. The reaction proceeds through successive steps of dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation. The formation of alkanes with carbon numbers greater than 10 demonstrates the capability of the system to perform cross-metathesis reactions. Additionally, an initiation product, 2-methyl-2-phenylbutane, has been detected, likely resulting from the cross-metathesis of the neophylidene Mo complex and 1-hexene followed by hydrogenation.

The selectivity of alkane conversions in this catalytic system is influenced by factors such as reaction conditions, catalyst properties, and the specific pathways of alkane activation, dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation. These mechanisms contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of alkane conversion processes, leading to advancements in petrochemical research and industry.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽化氢催化烷烃裂合的全面机制，讨论双位点和单位点方案、线性与环烷烃转化过程、关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其在反应选择性和催化剂性能中的作用。

由二氧化硅支持的钽化氢催化烷烃裂合机制涉及激活烷烃中的碳-氢（CH）键，形成烷基物种。该物种可以经历随后的β-H或α-H转移步骤，生成烯烃或氢化碳自由基中间体，作为烯烃裂合的传递中心。关键中间体包括烯烃和氢化碳自由基中间体。反应途径涉及CH激活、脱氢、烯烃裂合和氢化，为各种烷烃转化的选择性贡献。

双位点方案和单位点方案指的是催化剂在反应系统中的位置。在双位点方案中，烷烃转换发生在两个不同的催化剂位点上，而在单位点方案中，整个过程在单一催化剂位点上进行。这里描述的单位点方案使用了一种具有所有必要烷烃转换性质的金属，包括CH激活、脱氢、裂合和氢化。这允许将甲烷集成到更高同系物中。

最近发现了一个用于烷烃裂合的均相催化系统，它结合了脱氢/氢化和烯烃裂合两种催化剂。该系统在低温低压下运行，使烷烃转化为其更低和更高同系物成为可能。反应通过脱氢、烯烃裂合和氢化等连续步骤进行。形成碳数大于10的烷烃证明了该系统能够执行交叉裂合反应的能力。此外，检测到了一个启动产物，2-甲基-2-苯基丁烷，很可能是从钼复合物和1-己烯的交叉裂合后氢化形成的。

烷烃转换的这种催化系统的选择性受到反应条件、催化剂性质以及烷烃激活、脱氢、烯烃裂合和氢化特定路径的影响。这些机制为烷烃转换过程的效率和有效性做出了贡献，推动了石油化学研究和工业的发展。

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism begins with the activation of alkane molecules by a silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst. This activation process leads to the formation of an alkyl species, which undergoes a subsequent β-H or α-H transfer step to yield an olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate. These intermediates serve as the propagating centers for olefin metathesis, facilitating the rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds.

In the context of the Chevron process, the reaction is characterized by successive steps of dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation. The catalyst system combines a dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalyst and an olefin metathesis catalyst, allowing for the conversion of alkanes into their lower and higher homologues. The transformation involves the activation of alkane molecules, followed by the formation of an olefin and a carbenic propagating species. This process is influenced by the presence of internal and terminal olefins, leading to the formation of homologues of shorter chain lengths.

In the more recent homogeneous catalytic system developed by the Brookhart, Goldman, and Chevron groups, the reaction is facilitated by a combination of homogeneous catalysts. The system employs Kaska Ir complexes as dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts and a Mo imido olefin metathesis catalyst. This system operates at lower temperatures and pressures compared to traditional processes, enabling the conversion of alkanes into a mixture of C2-C14 alkane products. The product distribution indicates a clear sequence of reactions, including dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation, which contributes to the formation of various alkane homologues.

These mechanisms highlight the importance of catalyst design and the strategic combination of different catalytic activities in achieving efficient alkane metathesis. The ability to selectively transform alkanes into a minimum number of homologues remains a significant challenge in the field of alkane conversions.

机制从二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化剂激活烷烃分子开始。这一激活过程导致形成烷基物种，随后进行β-H或α-H转移步骤以产生烯烃或氢化碳烯中间体。这些中间体作为烯烃裂合的传播中心，促进了碳碳键的重组。

在Chevron过程中，反应特征为脱氢、烯烃裂合和加氢的连续步骤。催化剂系统结合了脱氢/加氢催化剂和烯烃裂合催化剂，允许将烷烃转化为其较低和较高同系物。转化涉及烷烃分子的激活，随后形成烯烃和碳烯传播物种。该过程受内部和终端烯烃的影响，导致较短链长的同系物的形成。

由Brookhart、Goldman和Chevron团队开发的更近期的均相催化系统采用组合的均相催化剂。该系统利用Kaska Ir复合物作为脱氢/加氢催化剂和Mo imido烯烃裂合催化剂。与传统过程相比，此系统在较低温度和压力下运行，使得烷烃转化为C2-C14烷烃产物的混合物。产品分布显示了一系列反应序列，包括脱氢、烯烃裂合和加氢，这有助于形成各种烷烃同系物的形成。

这些机制强调了催化剂设计和不同催化活动战略组合的重要性，在实现高效的烷烃裂合中至关重要。将烷烃转化为最少数量的同系物仍然是一项重大挑战，这是烷烃转化领域的一个重要研究方向。

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, we find that the process involves a series of steps including activation of CH bonds, followed by dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation. The catalyst system consists of two components working together to facilitate the conversion of alkanes into their lower and higher homologues. The mechanism is characterized by the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and the performance of the catalysts in various alkane conversions. The two-site and one-site schemes refer to the simultaneous or sequential activation of the CH bond, leading to different pathways for alkane transformation. The catalyst performance is influenced by factors such as the stability and regeneration capability of the catalysts, as well as the efficiency of the conversion processes.
