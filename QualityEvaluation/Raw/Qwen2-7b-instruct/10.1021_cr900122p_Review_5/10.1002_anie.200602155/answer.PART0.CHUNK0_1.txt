[1] "Alkane conversion has been a major focus of petrochemical research for the past century,13 and in fact the discovery of olefin metathesis on supported MoO3 or WO3 systems by Banks and Bailey was the result of the investigation of the reactivity of alkane and olefin mixtures on such types of catalysts."
[2] "In 1997, within a research program targeted at the activation of CH bonds by supported transition-metal catalysts, J.-M. Basset et al. reported the conversion of alkanes at low temperatures and pressures, typically 150C and 1 bar, into their lower and higher homologues. The catalyst was a silica-supported tantalum hydride,10 and the reaction was named alkane metathesis by analogy with olefin metathesis (Scheme 1a)."
[3] "Notably, and in contrast to the Chevron process, alkane metathesis is carried out on a dual catalyst based on a single metal having all the necessary properties (CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation), and moreover, these catalytic systems can be used to incorporate methane into higher homologues."
[4] "Recently, a homogeneous catalytic system for alkane metathesis was discovered, which is a combination of two catalysts that carry out dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and olefin metathesis."
[5] "The product distribution (all linear alkanes from C2C14) clearly indicates that the reaction corresponds to successive steps of dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation."
[6] "The formation of alkanes of carbon number greater than 10 in small amounts is evidence for successive reactions such as the cross-metathesis of hexane (as hexenes) with higher homologues."
[7] "Moreover, one initiation product, 2-methyl-2-phenylbutane, which probably results from the cross-metathesis of the neophylidene Mo complex 2 and 1-hexene and subsequent hydrogenation, has been detected."

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the activation of the carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds in alkanes to form an alkyl species. This species can undergo subsequent β-H or α-H transfer steps to yield the olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, serving as the propagating center for olefin metathesis. The formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes plays a crucial role in this process. Key intermediates include alkenes and hydridocarbene intermediates. The reaction pathway involves CH activation, dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation, contributing to the selectivity of alkane conversions.

Two-site and one-site schemes refer to the location of the catalyst within the reaction system. In a two-site scheme, the alkane conversion occurs across two distinct catalyst sites, whereas in a one-site scheme, the entire process takes place at a single catalyst site. The one-site scheme described here utilizes a single metal with all the necessary properties for alkane conversion, including CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation. This allows for the incorporation of methane into higher homologues.

A recent discovery involved a homogeneous catalytic system for alkane metathesis, which combines two catalysts for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and olefin metathesis. This system operates at low temperatures and pressures, enabling the conversion of alkanes into their lower and higher homologues. The reaction proceeds through successive steps of dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation. The formation of alkanes with carbon numbers greater than 10 demonstrates the capability of the system to perform cross-metathesis reactions. Additionally, an initiation product, 2-methyl-2-phenylbutane, has been detected, likely resulting from the cross-metathesis of the neophylidene Mo complex and 1-hexene followed by hydrogenation.

The selectivity of alkane conversions in this catalytic system is influenced by factors such as reaction conditions, catalyst properties, and the specific pathways of alkane activation, dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation. These mechanisms contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of alkane conversion processes, leading to advancements in petrochemical research and industry.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽化氢催化烷烃裂合的全面机制，讨论双位点和单位点方案、线性与环烷烃转化过程、关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其在反应选择性和催化剂性能中的作用。

由二氧化硅支持的钽化氢催化烷烃裂合机制涉及激活烷烃中的碳-氢（CH）键，形成烷基物种。该物种可以经历随后的β-H或α-H转移步骤，生成烯烃或氢化碳自由基中间体，作为烯烃裂合的传递中心。关键中间体包括烯烃和氢化碳自由基中间体。反应途径涉及CH激活、脱氢、烯烃裂合和氢化，为各种烷烃转化的选择性贡献。

双位点方案和单位点方案指的是催化剂在反应系统中的位置。在双位点方案中，烷烃转换发生在两个不同的催化剂位点上，而在单位点方案中，整个过程在单一催化剂位点上进行。这里描述的单位点方案使用了一种具有所有必要烷烃转换性质的金属，包括CH激活、脱氢、裂合和氢化。这允许将甲烷集成到更高同系物中。

最近发现了一个用于烷烃裂合的均相催化系统，它结合了脱氢/氢化和烯烃裂合两种催化剂。该系统在低温低压下运行，使烷烃转化为其更低和更高同系物成为可能。反应通过脱氢、烯烃裂合和氢化等连续步骤进行。形成碳数大于10的烷烃证明了该系统能够执行交叉裂合反应的能力。此外，检测到了一个启动产物，2-甲基-2-苯基丁烷，很可能是从钼复合物和1-己烯的交叉裂合后氢化形成的。

烷烃转换的这种催化系统的选择性受到反应条件、催化剂性质以及烷烃激活、脱氢、烯烃裂合和氢化特定路径的影响。这些机制为烷烃转换过程的效率和有效性做出了贡献，推动了石油化学研究和工业的发展。
