[1] "Alkane conversion has been a major focus of petrochemical research for the past century,13 and in fact the discovery of olefin metathesis on supported MoO3 or WO3 systems by Banks and Bailey was the result of the investigation of the reactivity of alkane and olefin mixtures on such types of catalysts.4,5"
[2] "Under these conditions, only olefins were transformed, which led to the development of very important industrial processes such as the Lummus ABB process, which converts ethylene into propylene through cross-metathesis with 2-butenes on W-based catalysts.6"
[3] "This discovery was rapidly turned into an alkane conversion process first by Banks (Philipps) and then by Hughes (Chevron)7,8 by combining heterogeneous dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and olefin metathesis catalysts, which allows a given alkane to be converted into its lower and higher homologues."
[4] "In 1997, within a research program targeted at the activation of CH bonds by supported transition-metal catalysts, J.-M. Basset et al. reported the conversion of alkanes at low temperatures and pressures, typically 150C and 1 bar, into their lower and higher homologues."
[5] "The catalyst was a silica-supported tantalum hydride,10 and the reaction was named alkane metathesis by analogy with olefin metathesis (Scheme 1a)."
[6] "An important research effort in collaboration with BP Chemicals and BP has yielded numerous catalytic systems based on Group 5 and Group 6 hydride and alkyl systems,1113 and currently the best system is a W hydride supported on alumina (turnover number (TON)=120 after 120 h under ca. 0.8 bar of propane; Scheme 1b).13"
[7] "The key carbon-carbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps correspond to those of olefin metathesis, that is, a [2+2] cycloreversion and a cycloaddition step.15,16"
[8] "After nearly 30 years without external reports, Chevron has published new patents on their system,18,19 and just recently a collaborative effort of the groups of Brookhart, Goldman, and Chevron has provided a homogeneous catalytic system related to the original Chevron process,20 but based on a combination of homogeneous catalysts, the Kaska Ir complexes 12123 as dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts, and the Mo imido olefin metathesis catalyst 2 of Schrock24,25"
[9] "In the presence of 1a (L=C2H4) and 2, hexane is converted into a mixture of C2C14 alkane products (0.752.05M, Figure 3b), which corresponds to a TON of about 49128 based on 2."
