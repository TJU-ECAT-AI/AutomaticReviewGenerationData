[1] "Alkane conversion has been a major focus of petrochemical research for the past century,13 and in fact the discovery of olefin metathesis on supported MoO3 or WO3 systems by Banks and Bailey was the result of the investigation of the reactivity of alkane and olefin mixtures on such types of catalysts."
[2] "The new catalytic system is a combination of two catalysts that carry out dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and olefin metathesis (see scheme)."
[3] "In 1997, within a research program targeted at the activation of CH bonds by supported transition-metal catalysts, J.-M. Basset et al. reported the conversion of alkanes at low temperatures and pressures, typically 150C and 1 bar, into their lower and higher homologues."
[4] "The catalyst was a silica-supported tantalum hydride,10 and the reaction was named alkane metathesis by analogy with olefin metathesis (Scheme 1a)."
[5] "Recent kinetic and mechanistic studies in our laboratories12,14 have shown that the key carboncarbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps correspond to those of olefin metathesis, that is, a [2+2] cycloreversion and a cycloaddition step."
[6] "It has been proposed that an alkyl species is formed by CH activation of alkanes, which, by a subsequent β-H or α-H transfer step, yields the olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis (Scheme 1c)."
[7] "The transformation of the alkane into an olefin and carbenic propagating species involves additional key elementary steps."
[8] "After nearly 30 years without external reports, Chevron has published new patents on their system,18,19 and just recently a collaborative effort of the groups of Brookhart, Goldman, and Chevron has provided a homogeneous catalytic system related to the original Chevron process,20 but based on a combination of homogeneous catalysts, the Kaska Ir complexes 12123 as dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts, and the Mo imido olefin metathesis catalyst 2 of Schrock24,25 (Figure 3a)."
[9] "The product distribution (all linear alkanes from C2C14) clearly indicates that the reaction corresponds to successive steps of dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation."
[10] "The product distribution is consistent with their formation through nearly a statistical metathesis of an equilibrated mixture of hexene isomers (internal olefins in greater amount than terminal ones leading to homologues of shorter chain lengths compared to those derived from the metathesis of terminal olefins)."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism begins with the activation of alkane molecules by a silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst. This activation process leads to the formation of an alkyl species, which undergoes a subsequent β-H or α-H transfer step to yield an olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate. These intermediates serve as the propagating centers for olefin metathesis, facilitating the rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds.

In the context of the Chevron process, the reaction is characterized by successive steps of dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation. The catalyst system combines a dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalyst and an olefin metathesis catalyst, allowing for the conversion of alkanes into their lower and higher homologues. The transformation involves the activation of alkane molecules, followed by the formation of an olefin and a carbenic propagating species. This process is influenced by the presence of internal and terminal olefins, leading to the formation of homologues of shorter chain lengths.

In the more recent homogeneous catalytic system developed by the Brookhart, Goldman, and Chevron groups, the reaction is facilitated by a combination of homogeneous catalysts. The system employs Kaska Ir complexes as dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts and a Mo imido olefin metathesis catalyst. This system operates at lower temperatures and pressures compared to traditional processes, enabling the conversion of alkanes into a mixture of C2-C14 alkane products. The product distribution indicates a clear sequence of reactions, including dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation, which contributes to the formation of various alkane homologues.

These mechanisms highlight the importance of catalyst design and the strategic combination of different catalytic activities in achieving efficient alkane metathesis. The ability to selectively transform alkanes into a minimum number of homologues remains a significant challenge in the field of alkane conversions.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合机制涉及理解两个站点和一个站点方案，线性和环烷烃转换过程中的过程，以及关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和作用，以及这些因素如何在各种烷烃转化中促进反应选择性和催化剂性能。

机制从二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化剂激活烷烃分子开始。这一激活过程导致形成烷基物种，随后进行β-H或α-H转移步骤以产生烯烃或氢化碳烯中间体。这些中间体作为烯烃裂合的传播中心，促进了碳碳键的重组。

在Chevron过程中，反应特征为脱氢、烯烃裂合和加氢的连续步骤。催化剂系统结合了脱氢/加氢催化剂和烯烃裂合催化剂，允许将烷烃转化为其较低和较高同系物。转化涉及烷烃分子的激活，随后形成烯烃和碳烯传播物种。该过程受内部和终端烯烃的影响，导致较短链长的同系物的形成。

由Brookhart、Goldman和Chevron团队开发的更近期的均相催化系统采用组合的均相催化剂。该系统利用Kaska Ir复合物作为脱氢/加氢催化剂和Mo imido烯烃裂合催化剂。与传统过程相比，此系统在较低温度和压力下运行，使得烷烃转化为C2-C14烷烃产物的混合物。产品分布显示了一系列反应序列，包括脱氢、烯烃裂合和加氢，这有助于形成各种烷烃同系物的形成。

这些机制强调了催化剂设计和不同催化活动战略组合的重要性，在实现高效的烷烃裂合中至关重要。将烷烃转化为最少数量的同系物仍然是一项重大挑战，这是烷烃转化领域的一个重要研究方向。
