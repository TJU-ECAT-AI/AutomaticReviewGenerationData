[1] "Alkane conversion has been a major focus of petrochemical research for the past century,13 and in fact the discovery of olefin metathesis on supported MoO3 or WO3 systems by Banks and Bailey was the result of the investigation of the reactivity of alkane and olefin mixtures on such types of catalysts."
[2] "This discovery was rapidly turned into an alkane conversion process first by Banks (Philipps) and then by Hughes (Chevron)7,8 by combining heterogeneous dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and olefin metathesis catalysts, which allows a given alkane to be converted into its lower and higher homologues."
[3] "In 1997, within a research program targeted at the activation of CH bonds by supported transition-metal catalysts, J.-M. Basset et al. reported the conversion of alkanes at low temperatures and pressures, typically 150C and 1 bar, into their lower and higher homologues."
[4] "An important research effort in collaboration with BP Chemicals and BP has yielded numerous catalytic systems based on Group 5 and Group 6 hydride and alkyl systems,1113 and currently the best system is a W hydride supported on alumina (turnover number (TON)=120 after 120 h under ca. 0.8 bar of propane; Scheme 1b)."
[5] "Notably, the catalytic systems based on hydrides give better results under pressure and can be regenerated by treatment under H2."
[6] "Recent kinetic and mechanistic studies in our laboratories12,14 have shown that the key carboncarbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps correspond to those of olefin metathesis, that is, a [2+2] cycloreversion and a cycloaddition step."
[7] "The transformation of the alkane into an olefin and carbenic propagating species involves additional key elementary steps. It has been proposed that an alkyl species is formed by CH activation of alkanes, which, by a subsequent β-H or α-H transfer step, yields the olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis (Scheme 1c)."
[8] "The Ir catalyst precursors can be 1a, 1b, or 1c, but in each case, it is necessary to add an activator, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene (2 equiv), a well-known H2 scavenger,26,27 to the dihydrogen derivative."
[9] "The product distribution (all linear alkanes from C2C14) clearly indicates that the reaction corresponds to successive steps of dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation."
[10] "Moreover, one initiation product, 2-methyl-2-phenylbutane, which probably results from the cross-metathesis of the neophylidene Mo complex 2 and 1-hexene and subsequent hydrogenation, has been detected."
[11] "The product distribution is consistent with their formation through nearly a statistical metathesis of an equilibrated mixture of hexene isomers (internal olefins in greater amount than terminal ones leading to homologues of shorter chain lengths compared to those derived from the metathesis of terminal olefins)."
[12] "Finally, owing to the instability of 2, the combination of the Ir homogeneous catalyst with a heterogeneous olefin metathesis catalyst, Re2O7 on alumina, has also been investigated."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, the process involves the activation of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds in alkanes. This leads to the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. These intermediates play crucial roles in the transformation of linear and cyclic alkane structures through olefin metathesis. The formation of alkenes is a critical step as it provides the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis. The role of catalysts, specifically the silica-supported tantalum hydrides, is pivotal in facilitating these reactions at low temperatures and pressures, enabling efficient alkane conversion. The mechanism includes carbon-carbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps, characterized by a [2+2] cycloreversion and a cycloaddition, similar to olefin metathesis. The transformation of the alkane into an olefin and carbenic propagating species involves additional key elementary steps, including CH activation and subsequent β-H or α-H transfer steps. The catalyst system is capable of generating both alkenes and alkynes, which are essential intermediates for the formation of desired alkane products. The product distribution indicates that the reaction sequence involves successive steps of dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation, yielding a range of linear alkanes from C2 to C14. The detection of specific products, such as 2-methyl-2-phenylbutane, further supports the involvement of cross-metathesis and hydrogenation in the reaction pathway. The catalyst system's stability and regeneration capability under hydrogen treatment are important aspects that contribute to its performance in various alkane conversions.
