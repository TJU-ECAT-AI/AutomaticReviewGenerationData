[1] "Alkane conversion has been a major focus of petrochemical research for the past century,13 and in fact the discovery of olefin metathesis on supported MoO3 or WO3 systems by Banks and Bailey was the result of the investigation of the reactivity of alkane and olefin mixtures on such types of catalysts."
[2] "Under these conditions, only olefins were transformed, which led to the development of very important industrial processes such as the Lummus ABB process, which converts ethylene into propylene through cross-metathesis with 2-butenes on W-based catalysts."
[3] "The new catalytic system is a combination of two catalysts that carry out dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and olefin metathesis (see scheme)."
[4] "In 1997, within a research program targeted at the activation of CH bonds by supported transition-metal catalysts, J.-M. Basset et al. reported the conversion of alkanes at low temperatures and pressures, typically 150C and 1 bar, into their lower and higher homologues."
[5] "The transformation of the alkane into an olefin and carbenic propagating species involves additional key elementary steps. It has been proposed that an alkyl species is formed by CH activation of alkanes, which, by a subsequent β-H or α-H transfer step, yields the olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis."
[6] "After nearly 30 years without external reports, Chevron has published new patents on their system,18,19 and just recently a collaborative effort of the groups of Brookhart, Goldman, and Chevron has provided a homogeneous catalytic system related to the original Chevron process,20 but based on a combination of homogeneous catalysts, the Kaska Ir complexes 12123 as dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts, and the Mo imido olefin metathesis catalyst 2 of Schrock24,25 (Figure 3a)."
[7] "The product distribution (all linear alkanes from C2C14) clearly indicates that the reaction corresponds to successive steps of dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation."
[8] "Notably, and in contrast to the Chevron process, alkane metathesis is carried out on a dual catalyst based on a single metal having all the necessary properties (CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation), and moreover, these catalytic systems can be used to incorporate methane into higher homologues."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, we find that the process involves a series of steps including activation of CH bonds, followed by dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation. The catalyst system consists of two components working together to facilitate the conversion of alkanes into their lower and higher homologues. The mechanism is characterized by the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and the performance of the catalysts in various alkane conversions. The two-site and one-site schemes refer to the simultaneous or sequential activation of the CH bond, leading to different pathways for alkane transformation. The catalyst performance is influenced by factors such as the stability and regeneration capability of the catalysts, as well as the efficiency of the conversion processes.
