1. Compound 2 is more stable than 1 likely because of the chelation stability provided by the integral Lewis base, -N(CHJ2.
2. Compound 2 differs from compound 1 in that it can be purified further through crystallization from a toluene and hexane mixture kept at -30°C.
3. Unfortunately, high-quality X-ray crystals of compound 2 have not been obtained yet.
4. The complex is characterized by infrared spectroscopy, which shows bands specific to C6H4CH2N(CH3)2 (1420, 1380,1360,1305,1235,1170,1095,1040,1010,990,940,855,750 cm-') and C8H2- (890, 700 cm-').
5. Similar to point 2, compound 2 can be purified further by crystallization from a toluene and hexane mixture at -30°C.
6. Unfortunately, high-quality X-ray crystals of compound 2 have not yet been achieved.

1. 与1相比，化合物2更稳定，这可能是因为由整体Lewis碱-N(CHJ2提供的螯合稳定性。
2. 与1不同的是，化合物2可以通过在-30°C下维持的二甲苯和己烷混合物结晶进一步纯化。
3. 目前还没有得到化合物2的高质量X射线晶体。
4. 该复合物通过红外光谱进行表征，显示特定于C6H4CH2N(CH3)2（1420、1380、1360、1305、1235、1170、1095、1040、1010、990、940、855、750 cm-）和C8H2-（890、700 cm-）的带。
5. 类似于第2点，化合物2可以通过在-30°C下维持的二甲苯和己烷混合物结晶进一步纯化。
6. 目前还没有得到化合物2的高质量X射线晶体。
