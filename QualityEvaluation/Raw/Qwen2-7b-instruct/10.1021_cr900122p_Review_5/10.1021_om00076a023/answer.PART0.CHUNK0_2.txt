1. The complexes synthesized are not soluble enough in THF for 13C NMR spectroscopy or isopiestic molecular weight measurement.
2. Cyclooctatetraenyllanthanide alkyl and aryl complexes (CaHa)Lu[C-H,Si(CH,),] (THF)2 (1) and (CaHa)Lu[o-CeH4CH2N-(CH,),](THF) (2) were synthesized by reacting (CaH&LUCl(THF) with appropriate lithium reagents.
3. The reactions were conducted in THF at -78 °C, followed by warming to room temperature with stirring.
4. The reaction equation for the synthesis of compound 1 is (C8H8)LuCl(THF) + LiR → -78 °C workup (C8Ha)LuR(THF),+ LiCl (1).
5. Compound 2 is more stable due to the stability provided by the integral Lewis base, -N(CH)2, compared to compound 1.
6. Compound 2 can be purified further through crystallization from a mixture of toluene and hexane at -30 °C.
7. Unfortunately, X-ray quality crystals of compound 2 could not be obtained.
8. The complex is characterized by infrared spectroscopy showing bands for C6H4CH2N(CH3)2 and C8H2.
9. Complete elemental analyses and determination of the Lu:Cl ratio were carried out by Analytische Laborato-rien, Engelskirchen, West Germany.
10. Analogous alkyl and aryl derivatives for La and Sm could not be isolated.
11. For Sm, no characterizable product could be obtained.
12. For La, only the THF-soluble [(C8Ha),La] [Li(THF),] could be isolated, suggesting the formation of an alkyl intermediate but its instability towards ligand redistribution.
13. The isolation of [(CBH)LU] [Li(THF),] indicates ligand redistribution concerns when R = CH2Si(CH3) even at the end of the lanthanide series.
14. No characterizable product could be obtained for either La or Sm when R = CeH4CH2N(CH3),.
15. This work shows the existence of an easily prepared organolanthanide series and the synthesis of alkyl- and arylmonocyclooctatetraenyl-lutetium derivatives, despite the synthetic difficulties encountered.
