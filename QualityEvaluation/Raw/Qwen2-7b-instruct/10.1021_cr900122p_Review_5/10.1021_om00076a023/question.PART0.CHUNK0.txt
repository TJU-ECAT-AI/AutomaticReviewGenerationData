I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

566 Organometallics 1983,2, 566-569 complete elemental analysis.12 As analyzed the lanthanum derivative contains two molecules of THF while the erbium and lutetium derivatives contain one molecule of THF.
The complexes are not sufficiently soluble in THF for 13C NMR spectroscopy or isopiestic molecular weight mea- surement.
Attempted alkyl derivatization of the (C&-Ia)LnC1(THF),series has been initially confined to Ln = La, Sm, and Lu due to the ease of characterization of these complexes and their reaction products by 'H and 13C NMR spectroscopy.Accordingly, we have synthesized the first cyclooctatet- raenyllanthanide alkyl and aryl complexes (CaHa)Lu[
C-
H,Si(CH,),] (THF)2 (1) and (CaHa)Lu[o-CeH4CH2N-
(CH,),](THF) (2)
by reaction of (CaH&LUCl(THF) and the appropriate lithium reagent.', The reactions are con- ducted in THF at -78 "C, and the reaction mixture is then allowed to slowly warm to ambient temperature with stirring. Solvent is removed in vacuo, and the resulting oils are triturated with pentane or hexane to yield off- whitelbeige powders. After the mixture was washed with additional alkane solvent, the powders are extracted with toluene, and the solvent is removed in vacuo to yield spectroscopically pure 1 and 2 in 5045% yield (eq 1).

However, it can be satisfactorily characterized by infrared (bands character- istic of CH2Si(CH3),14 at 1240, 1230, 1225, and 855 cm-',coordinated THF at 1015 cm-', and CaH8'- at 890 and 705 cm-' are observed) and 'H NMR spectrocopy' [benz- ene-de,6

marginal stability of 1 precludes complete elemental analysis.
Compound 2 is more stable than 1 presumably due to the stability conferred by chelation of the integral Lewis base, -N(CHJ2. Unlike 1, it can be purified further by crystallization from a mixture of toluene and hexane maintained at -30 "C. Unfortunately, X-ray quality crystals have not yet been obtained. However, satisfactory characterization of the complex is provided by infrared [bands characteristic of C6H4CH2N(CH3)2'4 (1420, 1380,1360,1305,1235,1170,1095,1040,1010,990,940,855,750 cm-'), and C8H2- (890, 700 cm-') are observed] and 'H NMR spectrocopy' [benzene-d,,6 8.15, 7.01 (m, C&4CH2N(CH,)2), 6.71 (s, c$is),

Unfortunately, analogous alkyl and aryl derivatives cannot be isolated for La and Sm. When R = CH2Si(C- H,),, no characterizable product can be obtained for Sm.
For La, only the THF-soluble [(C8Ha),La] [Li(THF),] can be isolated (identified by infrared and 'H NMR spec- troscopy and complexometric metal analysis),'6 suggesting that the desired alkyl or alkyl intermediate has formed but is unstable with respect to ligand redistribution. In this context, it should be noted that [
(CBH)LU]
[Li(THF),]17 is an isolated byproduct in the synthesis of 1, indicating that, even at the end of the lanthanide series, ligand re- distribution is a concern when R = CH2Si(CH3),. When R = CeH4CH2N(CH3),,no characterizable product is ob- tained for either La or Sm.
Despite these synthetic difficulties, this work clearly demonstrates that (1) an easily prepared homologous monocyclooctatetraenyl-based organolanthanide series exists and is available for systematic study and derivati- zation and (2) alkyl- and arylmonocyclooctatetraenyl- lutetium derivatives can be synthesized and characterized.
Studies aimed at broadening the scope and number of these derivative complexes along with an investigation of their reaction chemistry are currently being conducted.

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
