[1] "The tightly collimated beams emanating from the third generation sources may be used to provide conventional measure- ments on voxels within a complex sample."
[2] "So, stopped flow XAFS was demonstrated over 15 years ago, using an energy dispersive technique to provide parallel acquisition of the whole X-ray absorption spectrum of interest."
[3] "The environment around the iridium is little changed in this process, and simultaneous monitoring of the reaction by UV- visible spectroscopy was utilised both to correlate with litera- ture data and also to verify the electron transfer steps."
[4] "Since the coherence length in the X-ray region can be larger than the size of the crystallites providing diffraction patterns."
[5] "Not only in diffraction and scattering is there a drive to derive structural data on short lived transients."

The third generation synchrotron light sources provide stable, tuneable light of energy up to the hard X-ray region, with a gain of a trillion in brightness compared to conventional laboratory X-ray sources. This allows for more detailed measurements on complex samples, including conventional measurements on voxels within the sample. Techniques like stopped flow XAFS can be used to analyze the entire X-ray absorption spectrum simultaneously. In a process involving electron transfer between [IrIVCl6]2 and [CoII(CN)5]3, the environment around the iridium remains unchanged, and UV-visible spectroscopy was used to monitor and verify the electron transfer steps. The coherence length in the X-ray region can be larger than the size of the crystallites, allowing for the derivation of structural data on short-lived transients.

第三代同步辐射光源提供能量高达硬X射线区域的稳定、可调光，与常规实验室X射线光源相比亮度提升了一个万亿级。这使得对复杂样品进行详细测量成为可能，包括对样品中像素的常规测量。使用停止流XAFS技术可以同时分析整个X射线吸收谱。在[IrIVCl6]2和[CoII(CN)5]3之间的电子转移过程中，围绕铱的环境几乎没有变化，并且使用紫外可见光谱学监测并验证了电子转移步骤。X射线相干长度可以大于晶体的尺寸，允许对短暂存在的瞬态结构进行结构数据提取。
