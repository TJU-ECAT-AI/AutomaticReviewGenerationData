1. Third-generation synchrotron light sources can address more complex scattering and diffraction issues, including the analysis of weakly scattering materials, large unit cells, and structural entities.
2. The tightly collimated beams from third-generation sources enable conventional measurements on voxels within complex samples.
3. By scanning the energy of the fluorescence signal with the second spectrometer, the X-ray emission spectrum (XES) of a sample can be measured with a fixed incident energy at or above the absorption edge.
4. Resolvable emissions associated with specific chemical environments can help overcome difficulties in using EXAFS to probe chemical mixtures.
5. The output per pulse of a free electron laser (FEL) is roughly equivalent to the output per second on a storage ring, according to a rule of thumb.
