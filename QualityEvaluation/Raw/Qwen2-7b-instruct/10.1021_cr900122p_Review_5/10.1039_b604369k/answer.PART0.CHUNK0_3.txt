[1] "The tightly collimated beams emanating from the third generation sources may be used to provide conventional measure- ments on voxels within a complex sample. Hence 2- or 3-D images may be reconstructed to map elements, oxidation states, crystalline phases or molecular species."
[2] "The first particle has an even distribution of uranium, with the small voids possibly due to fission gases, however the material deposited after the fire has a much more open structure."
[3] "The effectiveness of speciation by combining X-ray fluorescence, micro-XANES and IR microspectroscopy is exemplified by a study of microfossils and contemporary microbial filaments."

The third-generation synchrotron light sources enable the creation of highly collimated beams that can be utilized for mapping elements, oxidation states, crystalline phases, or molecular species within complex samples. This results in the reconstruction of 2D or 3D images. For instance, uranium was evenly distributed in the first particle, while the material deposited after the fire had a more open structure. The combination of X-ray fluorescence, micro-XANES, and IR microspectroscopy was successfully used to determine the chemical speciation in microfossils and contemporary microbial filaments.

第三代同步辐射光源能够产生高度汇聚的光束，用于复杂样品中元素、氧化态、晶相或分子物种的映射。这能生成二维或三维图像。例如，第一颗粒子中的铀分布均匀，而火灾后沉积的物质结构更为开放。通过结合X射线荧光、微XANES和IR微光谱技术，成功地对微化石和当代微生物纤维进行了化学成分的分析。
