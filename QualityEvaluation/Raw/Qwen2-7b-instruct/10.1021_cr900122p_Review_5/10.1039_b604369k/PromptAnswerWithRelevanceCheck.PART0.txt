[1] "The tightly collimated beams emanating from the third generation sources may be used to provide conventional measure- ments on voxels within a complex sample."
[2] "So, stopped flow XAFS was demonstrated over 15 years ago, using an energy dispersive technique to provide parallel acquisition of the whole X-ray absorption spectrum of interest."
[3] "The environment around the iridium is little changed in this process, and simultaneous monitoring of the reaction by UV- visible spectroscopy was utilised both to correlate with litera- ture data and also to verify the electron transfer steps."
[4] "Since the coherence length in the X-ray region can be larger than the size of the crystallites providing diffraction patterns."
[5] "Not only in diffraction and scattering is there a drive to derive structural data on short lived transients."

The third generation synchrotron light sources provide stable, tuneable light of energy up to the hard X-ray region, with a gain of a trillion in brightness compared to conventional laboratory X-ray sources. This allows for more detailed measurements on complex samples, including conventional measurements on voxels within the sample. Techniques like stopped flow XAFS can be used to analyze the entire X-ray absorption spectrum simultaneously. In a process involving electron transfer between [IrIVCl6]2 and [CoII(CN)5]3, the environment around the iridium remains unchanged, and UV-visible spectroscopy was used to monitor and verify the electron transfer steps. The coherence length in the X-ray region can be larger than the size of the crystallites, allowing for the derivation of structural data on short-lived transients.

The third-generation synchrotron light sources enable the creation of highly collimated beams that can be utilized for mapping elements, oxidation states, crystalline phases, or molecular species within complex samples. This results in the reconstruction of 2D or 3D images. For instance, uranium was evenly distributed in the first particle, while the material deposited after the fire had a more open structure. The combination of X-ray fluorescence, micro-XANES, and IR microspectroscopy was successfully used to determine the chemical speciation in microfossils and contemporary microbial filaments.

The document discusses the capabilities of third generation synchrotron light sources. These sources provide stable, tunable light up to the hard X-ray region, offering a gain of a trillion in brightness compared to conventional laboratory X-ray sources. This transformation opens up numerous opportunities for establishing structure-function relationships. The light may be quasi-continuous or pulsed, have controllable polarization, and have coherence lengths larger than the sample size. The high brightness facilitates adding time and spatial resolution to X-ray scattering and spectroscopy. It can also be used to identify specific information about magnetic properties, vibrations, and local structural descriptions tied to chemical speciation. These sources are particularly useful for solving more demanding scattering and diffraction problems, such as dealing with weakly scattering materials, large unit cells, and structural entities. The high collimation of the source also enhances spectroscopic and diffraction resolution, providing deeper insights into molecular, extended, and supramolecular structures. The increased emphasis on ease of use makes these capabilities accessible for chemical challenges.
