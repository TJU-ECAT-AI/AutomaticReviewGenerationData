The document discusses the capabilities of third generation synchrotron light sources. These sources provide stable, tunable light up to the hard X-ray region, offering a gain of a trillion in brightness compared to conventional laboratory X-ray sources. This transformation opens up numerous opportunities for establishing structure-function relationships. The light may be quasi-continuous or pulsed, have controllable polarization, and have coherence lengths larger than the sample size. The high brightness facilitates adding time and spatial resolution to X-ray scattering and spectroscopy. It can also be used to identify specific information about magnetic properties, vibrations, and local structural descriptions tied to chemical speciation. These sources are particularly useful for solving more demanding scattering and diffraction problems, such as dealing with weakly scattering materials, large unit cells, and structural entities. The high collimation of the source also enhances spectroscopic and diffraction resolution, providing deeper insights into molecular, extended, and supramolecular structures. The increased emphasis on ease of use makes these capabilities accessible for chemical challenges.
