The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, the activation of alkane occurs at one site, followed by the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate then migrates to the second site where it undergoes rearrangement to form a new alkane. In the one-site mechanism, the activation and rearrangement occur at the same site, leading to a more straightforward pathway. Linear alkane transformations typically involve the cleavage of a C-C bond, while cyclic alkane transformations involve the opening of a ring structure. Key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the rearrangement processes. The formation of these intermediates, along with the precise control of reaction conditions, contributes to the high selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process. Factors such as the support material, the nature of the catalyst, and the reaction conditions determine the performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

烷烃异构化催化由硅基支持的钽氢化合物的全面机制涉及双位点和一位点方案。在双位点机制中，烷烃的激活发生在一个位点，随后形成一个金属环丁烷中间体。该中间体然后迁移到第二个位点，在那里它经历重组形成一个新的烷烃。在一位点机制中，激活和重组在同一位点发生，导致更直接的路径。线性烷烃转换通常涉及C-C键的断裂，而环烷烃转换涉及环结构的打开。关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们在重组过程中发挥着关键作用。这些中间体的形成，以及精确控制反应条件，有助于催化过程的高度选择性和效率。催化剂性能的因素，如支持材料、催化剂的性质和反应条件，决定了各种烷烃转化的性能。
