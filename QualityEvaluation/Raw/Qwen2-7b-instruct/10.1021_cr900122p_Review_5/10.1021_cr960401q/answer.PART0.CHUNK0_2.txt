Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves examining both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

This mechanism begins with the activation of the alkane substrates by the silica-supported tantalum hydrides, leading to the formation of metallacyclobutanes. These metallacyclobutanes act as intermediates, undergoing rearrangements to form alkenes. The selectivity and efficiency of the reactions depend on the properties of the catalyst, including its surface area, acidity, and the coordination environment of the tantalum atoms. 

The one-site scheme refers to the direct formation of alkenes from the activation of the alkane substrate, while the two-site scheme involves an intermediate metallacyclobutane formation followed by its transformation into alkenes. The specific pathway chosen can affect the regioselectivity and stereochemistry of the resulting alkenes.

Linear alkane metathesis typically involves the rearrangement of the alkane chain to produce a different linear alkane, whereas cyclic alkane metathesis results in the transformation of a cyclic alkane into a different cyclic alkane. The catalyst's ability to facilitate these transformations efficiently and selectively is crucial for achieving desired products.

Key intermediates, such as alkenes, play a pivotal role in the mechanism. They are formed through the activation of the alkane substrate and can undergo further reactions, such as hydrogen transfer, to generate the final alkene products. The coordination of tantalum with the alkyl groups influences the stability and reactivity of these intermediates, affecting the overall efficiency of the metathesis reaction.

The selectivity of the alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides is influenced by the catalyst's structure, the nature of the alkane substrates, and the reaction conditions. Factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of cocatalysts can impact the reaction pathways, influencing the yield and purity of the products.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides encompasses the activation of alkane substrates, the formation and transformation of key intermediates, and the role of the catalyst's properties in determining the selectivity and efficiency of the reactions. This mechanism is crucial for understanding and optimizing the performance of these catalysts in various alkane conversions.
