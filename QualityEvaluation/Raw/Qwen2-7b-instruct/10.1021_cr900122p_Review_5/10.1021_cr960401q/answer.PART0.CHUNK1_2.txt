Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides reveals a dual approach involving both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, two alkyl groups sequentially decarbonylate and recombine to form an alkene intermediate. In contrast, the one-site mechanism entails a single alkyl group undergoing decarbonylation and self-recombination to generate an alkene. Linear alkane molecules predominantly yield linear alkene products, whereas cyclic alkane molecules might transform into cyclobutene or other cyclic alkene products. Key intermediates in this process are alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The catalyst's high surface area and effective dispersion of active sites are critical for achieving high conversion rates and selectivities. The presence of silico-tantalum species enables the activation of alkyl groups and facilitates the decarbonylation steps. The catalyst's durability across multiple reaction cycles is attributed to its inert silica support.

对于由硅基支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃互变异构全面机制的分析揭示了两种途径，包括双位点和单位点方案。在双位点机制中，两个烷基团依次脱羰化并重新组合形成一个烯烃中间体。相反，在单位点机制中，单个烷基团通过脱羰化并自我重组生成一个烯烃。线性烷烃分子主要产生线性烯烃产物，而环烷烃分子可能会转化为环丁烯或其他环烯烃产物。此过程的关键中间体是烯烃和金属环丁烷。催化剂的高比表面积和活性位点的有效分散对实现高转化率和选择性至关重要。硅基-钽物种的存在能够激活烷基团并促进脱羰化步骤。该催化剂的耐久性在多次反应周期内得到体现，这归功于其惰性的硅基支持。
