[1] "Three types of hydrogen adsorption have previously been characterized on zinc oxide at low temperatures,designated Types 1, 11 and 111."
[2] "One of these, Type 111, is a molecular form of adsorption which can be specifically titrated by nitrogen adsorption on IO-20% of the surface with formation of a molecular nitrogen species."
[3] "The promotional effect of oxygen on the conversion reaction was also investigated."
[4] "At low temperatures, the exchange and conversion reactions are independent, but this is not necessarily true at room temperature."
[5] "A mathematical model is presented for the paramagnetic conversion based on Wigners theory involving longer times of interaction."
[6] "Recently, Van Cauwelaert and Hall (16,17) has investigated and suggested the possible modifications of the conversion theory by collision to include the hindered rotor model of hydrogen interaction with a resulting enhancement of the par-a-conversion rate."

1. Three types of hydrogen adsorption have been identified on zinc oxide at low temperatures: Types 1, 11, and 111. Type 111 is a molecular form that can be specifically titrated by nitrogen adsorption on 10-20% of the surface, forming a molecular nitrogen species.
2. The impact of oxygen on the conversion reaction was studied. 
3. At low temperatures, the exchange and conversion reactions are independent, whereas this might not be the case at room temperature.
4. A mathematical model for paramagnetic conversion is presented, relying on longer interaction times according to Wigner's theory.
5. Van Cauwelaert and Hall explored modifications to the conversion theory by collision, incorporating the hindered rotor model of hydrogen interaction, which resulted in enhanced para-conversion rates.

1. 在低温下，锌氧化物上已经识别出三种氢吸附类型：类型1、类型11和类型111。类型111是一种分子形式，可以通过氮吸附在表面10-20%处进行特定滴定，形成分子氮物种。
2. 氧气对转换反应的影响被研究。
3. 在低温下，交换和转换反应是独立的，但在室温下，这可能不是这种情况。
4. 根据威格纳的理论，提出了一种基于更长时间相互作用的参数转换数学模型。
5. Van Cauwelaert和Hall探索了通过碰撞修改转换理论的可能性，包括氢与受阻旋转器模型的相互作用，从而导致了增强的para转换率。
