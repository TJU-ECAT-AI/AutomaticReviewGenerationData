The study analyzes the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, focusing on two-site and one-site schemes, linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. 

The process involves the adsorption of oxygen promoting ortho-para conversion, measurement of the rate of allotropic conversion at room temperature in the presence of ethylene, and the influence of oxygen and nitrogen on the exchange and conversion reactions. The study compares kinetic and adsorption measurements during exchange with the presence and absence of oxygen and nitrogen, relating these findings to the proposed mechanisms. The analysis also includes the comparison of allotropic conversion and isotopic exchange rates, the effect of hindered rotation on the conversion of hydrogen and deuterium, and the impact of the high barrier to rotation on the conversion of deuterium relative to hydrogen.

In summary, the research explores the detailed mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, considering the role of adsorbed oxygen, the inhibition by ethylene, the influence of co-present gases on the exchange and conversion processes, and the effect of hindered rotation on the conversion kinetics of hydrogen and deuterium. The study aims to understand the reaction pathways, intermediates, and catalyst performance in alkane conversions.
