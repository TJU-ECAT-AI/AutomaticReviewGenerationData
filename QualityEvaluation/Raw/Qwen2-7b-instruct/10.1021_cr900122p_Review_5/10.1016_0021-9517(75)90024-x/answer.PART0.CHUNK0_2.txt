[1] "Three types of hydrogen adsorption have previously been characterized on zinc oxide at low temperatures,designated Types 1, 11 and 111."
[2] "One of these, Type 111, is a molecular form of adsorption which can be specifically titrated by nitrogen adsorption on IO-20% of the surface with formation of a molecular nitrogen species."
[3] "This selective titration by a molecular nitrogen adsorption was employed to study the participation of molecularly ad- sorbed hydrogen in the allotropic (ortho-para) hydrogen conversion and isotopic (HZ-D,) hydrogen exchange."
[4] "The promotional effect of oxygen on the conversion reaction was also investigated."
[5] "At low temperatures, the exchange and conversion reactions are independent, but this is not necessarily true at room temperature."
[6] "A mathematical model is presented for the paramagnetic conversion based on Wigners theory involving longer times of interaction."
[7] "The result is an enhancement of the conversion rate by several orders of magnitude with the deuterium conversion being enhanced more than the molecular hydrogen conversion."

The document outlines a detailed investigation into hydrogen adsorption and its participation in the allotropic conversion and isotopic exchange on zinc oxide surfaces. Three types of hydrogen adsorption were identified: Types 1, 11, and 111. Type 111 represents a molecular form of adsorption that can be specifically titrated by nitrogen adsorption on 10-20% of the surface, forming a molecular nitrogen species. This selective titration was utilized to study the involvement of molecularly adsorbed hydrogen in the allotropic (ortho-para) hydrogen conversion and isotopic (HZ-D) hydrogen exchange. The influence of oxygen on the conversion process was also examined. The document notes that at low temperatures, the exchange and conversion reactions are independent, whereas this might not hold true at room temperature. A mathematical model for paramagnetic conversion, based on Wigner's theory, was developed, which led to an enhancement of the conversion rate by several orders of magnitude, with deuterium conversion being more significantly enhanced than molecular hydrogen conversion.

文档详细研究了锌氧化物表面氢吸附及其在异构转换和同位素交换中的作用。识别出三种氢吸附类型：类型1、类型11和类型111。类型111表示一种分子形式的吸附，可以通过氮吸附在10-20%的表面上进行选择性滴定，形成分子氮物种。这种选择性滴定被用来研究分子吸附氢在异构（正交-顺式）氢转换和同位素（HZ-D）氢交换中的参与。氧气对转换过程的影响也被探讨。文档指出，在低温下，交换和转换反应是独立的，但在室温下，这可能不成立。基于威格纳理论开发了一种参数磁性转换数学模型，导致转换速率增强几个数量级，其中氘转换比分子氢转换更显著增强。
