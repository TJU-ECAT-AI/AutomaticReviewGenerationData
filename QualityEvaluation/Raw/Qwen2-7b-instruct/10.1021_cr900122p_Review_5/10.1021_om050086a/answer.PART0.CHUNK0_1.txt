The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides includes both two-site and one-site schemes. Linear alkane transformations involve the formation of alkenes as key intermediates, while cyclic alkane transformations require the formation of metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are significantly influenced by the role of these key intermediates. Various alkane conversions are determined by the specific catalyst structure and conditions.
