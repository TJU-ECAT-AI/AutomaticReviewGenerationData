Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. The process typically begins with the activation of the alkane substrate by the catalyst, leading to the formation of an alkene intermediate. In the context of the literature provided, the catalyst in question is methyltrioxorhenium (MTO), which exhibits unique properties and mechanisms for alkane metathesis.

Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in the conversion of both linear and cyclic alkane structures. The formation of these intermediates is a critical step in the metathesis reaction, facilitating the rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by several factors. These include the specific structure of the alkane, the presence of functional groups, and the conditions under which the reaction takes place. The literature highlights the effectiveness of MTO in catalyzing self-metathesis reactions of allyl halides, ethers, silanes, and unsaturated carboxylates and nitriles, as well as the ethenolysis of olefins with internal double bonds.

The role of the catalyst in the metathesis of simple open-chain and cyclic olefins is also discussed, indicating its versatility in handling different types of substrates. The literature further elaborates on the absence of frequent side reactions, such as double-bond isomerization and olefin dimerization, in the presence of MTO, highlighting its selectivity in these transformations.

The mechanism of MTO-based catalysts involves complex interactions between the rhenium center and the alkene substrate. The condensation reaction, which increases the Lewis acidity of the rhenium, is a notable feature of the catalyst system. This electronic change facilitates the formation of reactive intermediates that are essential for the metathesis reaction.

Additionally, the literature discusses the participation of metal-coordinated CD, groups in olefin metathesis, providing insights into the role of specific ligands in enhancing the catalytic activity. The loss of methyl groups during the metathesis process is another aspect addressed, which impacts the catalyst's performance and activity.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the activation of alkane substrates, the formation of key intermediates, and the selective rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds. The role of the catalyst, particularly MTO, in facilitating these transformations is characterized by its ability to promote metathesis reactions efficiently while minimizing side reactions, thereby contributing to the performance and selectivity in various alkane conversions.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. This process allows for the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkanes through the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. The role of these intermediates, along with the specific alkyl groups on the metal, contributes significantly to the reaction selectivity and the performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. Controlling the rhenium/cocatalyst ratio can manipulate the cis-trans configuration of the resulting polymers, offering a level of designability for optimizing catalyst activity and stability. The participation of metal-coordinated CD, groups in olefin metathesis, as confirmed by the use of CD,ReO, (>99% D), further illustrates the complexity and specificity of the catalytic pathways involved in these transformations. The condensation reaction with the support material enhances the catalyst's Lewis acidity, influencing its reactivity. The ability of MTO to lose up to 5% of organic groups as methane and ethylene during preparation highlights the stability and adaptability of the catalyst under different conditions. The inability of free MTO to separate from the carrier even under high vacuum suggests strong interactions between the catalyst and the support, potentially affecting its regeneration and recycling. The presence of perrhenate on the surface indicates the dynamic nature of the catalyst, allowing for the detection of reactive intermediates. The suitability of Nb,O, as an alternative support material broadens the potential for catalyst design and application. The high proportion of cis-configurated moieties in the products, controllable by the rhenium/cocatalyst ratio, showcases the stereoselectivity and control achievable with these catalysts. The possibility of designed catalyst optimization through variation of alkyl groups on the metal opens avenues for enhancing efficiency and expanding the scope of alkane metathesis reactions.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The reactions encompass linear and cyclic alkane transformations, where key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play crucial roles. The catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as reaction selectivity, the formation and role of these intermediates, and the specific conditions under which the reactions take place.

In the context of alkane metathesis, silica-supported tantalum hydrides enable the efficient conversion of both simple and complex alkane structures. The catalysts can operate under mild conditions, such as room temperature, facilitating the metathesis of a wide range of olefins, including those with functional groups. The presence of functional groups typically necessitates the use of additives, such as organotin compounds, to achieve optimal catalytic activity. However, the introduction of catalysts like MTO (methyltrioxorhenium) enhances the efficiency of the metathesis process, even in the absence of such additives, demonstrating superior catalytic properties compared to traditional catalysts like ReO3.

The mechanism involves the coordination of the alkane molecules to the metal centers of the catalyst, leading to the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds and the formation of alkenes. These alkenes subsequently rearrange through a series of reactions, facilitated by the metal centers, to produce the desired alkane products. The ability of the catalyst to maintain the integrity of the alkane backbone while selectively introducing functional groups or altering the alkane structure is a testament to its sophisticated mechanism.

The loss of organic groups as methane and ethylene during the preparation of catalysts like MTO highlights the dynamic nature of these reactions, where the catalyst undergoes minor structural changes. This process is further supported by the confirmation of metal-coordinated CD, groups participating in olefin metathesis, showcasing the intricate interplay between the catalyst structure and the chemical reactions taking place.

Moreover, the inability of MTO to be removed from the carrier by solvents underscores the strong interaction between the catalyst and the support material, contributing to its stability and catalytic efficacy. The suitability of MTO for use in homogeneous catalyst systems for olefins without functional groups expands the versatility of this catalyst in industrial applications.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a combination of bond-breaking and bond-forming reactions, facilitated by the strategic coordination of alkane molecules to the metal centers of the catalyst. The catalysts exhibit exceptional activity and selectivity, enabling efficient alkane conversions under mild conditions, with the ability to handle both simple and complex alkane structures. The detailed understanding of these mechanisms not only advances the field of catalysis but also opens avenues for the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly processes in the synthesis of valuable olefins and polymers.

催化机制涉及硅负载钽氢化物的烷烃裂合，包括双位点和单位点方案。反应涵盖了线性和环状烷烃的转换，其中关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷在其中起着关键作用。在各种烷烃转化中的催化剂性能受到反应选择性、这些中间体的作用以及反应进行时特定条件的影响。

在烷烃裂合的背景下，硅负载钽氢化物能够高效地转换各种简单和复杂的烷烃结构。催化剂能够在温和条件下操作，如室温下，促进各种烯烃的裂合，包括那些具有功能基团的烯烃。功能基团的存在通常需要添加剂（如有机锡化合物）来实现最佳催化活性。然而，引入如MTO（甲基三氧罗铑）这样的催化剂能够提高裂合过程的效率，即使在没有此类添加剂的情况下也是如此，表明与传统催化剂（如ReO3）相比具有更优越的催化特性。

该机制涉及烷烃分子与催化剂中金属中心的配合，导致碳-碳键的断裂和烯烃的形成。这些烯烃随后通过一系列反应进行重组，由金属中心促进，以产生所需的烷烃产品。催化剂能够保持烷烃骨架的完整性，同时选择性地引入功能性基团或改变烷烃结构，证明其复杂机制。

催化剂在准备过程中失去有机组分作为甲烷和乙烯，突显了这些反应的动态性质，催化剂在此期间经历了轻微的结构变化。这一过程进一步得到了金属-配位CD，组参与烯烃裂合的确认，展示了催化剂结构与正在进行的化学反应之间复杂的相互作用。

此外，MTO无法通过溶剂去除从载体的事实强调了催化剂与支撑材料之间的强烈相互作用，有助于其稳定性和催化效能。MTO对不含功能基团的烯烃在均相催化剂系统中的适用性扩大了这种催化剂的应用范围。

总之，硅负载钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合机制涉及一系列断键和成键反应，由催化剂中金属中心对烷烃分子的精确配合所促进。催化剂表现出极高的活性和选择性，能够在温和条件下高效地进行烷烃转化，能够处理从简单到复杂的烷烃结构。对这些机制的详细理解不仅推进了催化领域的研究，而且为合成有价值的烯烃和聚合物开辟了更高效和环境友好的途径。

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. The two-site and one-site schemes refer to the possible locations where the catalytic reactions occur on the surface of the silica-supported catalyst. The processes involve both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The catalyst performance and reaction selectivity are influenced by the formation of these intermediates and the ability of the catalyst to facilitate the desired reactions over undesired side reactions such as double bond isomerization and olefin dimerization. The volume of solvent used does not seem to significantly affect the metathesis equilibrium. The relative productivity of rhenium-containing heterogeneous metathesis catalysts can be compared under standardized test conditions, as depicted in Figure 1. To maintain the catalyst activity, it is necessary to prevent the cleavage of methyl groups, which can lead to degradation reactions forming methane. Alternative carriers such as Nb,O, can be used besides Al2O,-containing systems. MTO represents a significant advancement in catalyst design, offering a new generation of structurally defined catalysts after decades of research in the field of olefin metathesis.
