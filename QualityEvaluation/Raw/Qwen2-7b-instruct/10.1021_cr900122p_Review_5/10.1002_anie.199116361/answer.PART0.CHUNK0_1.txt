[9] "The cis-stereoselectivity can be controlled by the rhenium/cocatalyst ratio: an increase in the organoaluminum component yields a polymer with a higher proportion of trans-configuration."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. This process allows for the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkanes through the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. The role of these intermediates, along with the specific alkyl groups on the metal, contributes significantly to the reaction selectivity and the performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. Controlling the rhenium/cocatalyst ratio can manipulate the cis-trans configuration of the resulting polymers, offering a level of designability for optimizing catalyst activity and stability. The participation of metal-coordinated CD, groups in olefin metathesis, as confirmed by the use of CD,ReO, (>99% D), further illustrates the complexity and specificity of the catalytic pathways involved in these transformations. The condensation reaction with the support material enhances the catalyst's Lewis acidity, influencing its reactivity. The ability of MTO to lose up to 5% of organic groups as methane and ethylene during preparation highlights the stability and adaptability of the catalyst under different conditions. The inability of free MTO to separate from the carrier even under high vacuum suggests strong interactions between the catalyst and the support, potentially affecting its regeneration and recycling. The presence of perrhenate on the surface indicates the dynamic nature of the catalyst, allowing for the detection of reactive intermediates. The suitability of Nb,O, as an alternative support material broadens the potential for catalyst design and application. The high proportion of cis-configurated moieties in the products, controllable by the rhenium/cocatalyst ratio, showcases the stereoselectivity and control achievable with these catalysts. The possibility of designed catalyst optimization through variation of alkyl groups on the metal opens avenues for enhancing efficiency and expanding the scope of alkane metathesis reactions.
