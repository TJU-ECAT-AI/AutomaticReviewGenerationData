[1] "MTO (la) and higher homologues (RReO,, R = alkyl, aryl) on acidic metal oxide supports form metathesis catalysts that are active without additives even for functionalized olefins."
[2] "It catalyzes in particular the self-metathesis of ally1 halides, ethers, silanes, and unsaturated carboxylates and nitriles, but also the ethenolysis of olefins with internal double bonds."
[3] "Otherwise frequent side reactions such as double-bond isomerization and olefin dimerization are insignificant in the presence of 1."
[4] "The volume of solvent used seemed not to affect the metathesis equilibrium."
[5] "Fig. 1. Relative productivity of rhenium-containing heterogeneous metathesis catalysts. determined under standardized test conditions (25 C, 60 min, carrier AI,O,-SiO, 13/87, 3 wt% rhenium charge)."
[6] "The special catalyst activity of MTO is lost when the methyl groups are cleaved. To avoid this degradation/deactivation reaction (which forms methane!), thermally pretreated carriers are required."
[7] "Besides A120,-containing systems, Nb,O, is suitable."
[8] "Because practically all metathesis catalysts are based on oxides or halides of molybdenum, tungsten, and rhenium, MTO introduces-after 30 years of research in this field-a new generation of structurally defined catalysts."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. The two-site and one-site schemes refer to the possible locations where the catalytic reactions occur on the surface of the silica-supported catalyst. The processes involve both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The catalyst performance and reaction selectivity are influenced by the formation of these intermediates and the ability of the catalyst to facilitate the desired reactions over undesired side reactions such as double bond isomerization and olefin dimerization. The volume of solvent used does not seem to significantly affect the metathesis equilibrium. The relative productivity of rhenium-containing heterogeneous metathesis catalysts can be compared under standardized test conditions, as depicted in Figure 1. To maintain the catalyst activity, it is necessary to prevent the cleavage of methyl groups, which can lead to degradation reactions forming methane. Alternative carriers such as Nb,O, can be used besides Al2O,-containing systems. MTO represents a significant advancement in catalyst design, offering a new generation of structurally defined catalysts after decades of research in the field of olefin metathesis.

催化机理涉及在二氧化硅支持下钽氢化物中形成烯烃和金属环丁烷作为关键中间体。两站点和一站点方案指的是催化剂表面可能发生的催化反应的位置。过程包括线性和环烷基转化。催化剂性能和反应选择性受这些中间体的形成以及催化剂促进所需反应而非副反应的能力的影响。溶剂体积似乎不会显著影响裂解平衡。在标准化测试条件下，可以比较含铼异相裂解催化剂的相对生产力，如图1所示。为了保持催化剂活性，需要防止甲基团的断裂，这可能导致形成甲烷的降解反应。除了Al2O,-型系统之外，还可以使用Nb,O,等替代载体。MTO代表了在三十多年的研究后，结构定义催化剂领域的一个重要进展，提供了一代新的结构定义催化剂。
