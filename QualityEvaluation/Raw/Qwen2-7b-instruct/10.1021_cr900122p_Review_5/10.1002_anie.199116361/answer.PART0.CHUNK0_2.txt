[1] "The olefin metathesis is a reaction catalyzed by organo- metallic compounds, and its significance for the synthesis of basic and fine-chemical olefins as well as of polymers (poly- alkenamers) is steadily increasing."
[2] "Variants, including both homogeneous and heterogenous catalysis, are presently used in eight technical p r o c e s  e s , [ but the metathesis of functionalized olefins still presents problems (e.g., high cata- lyst concentrations, catalyst poisoning)."
[3] "We have now discovered that the title compound MTO (la) and higher homologues (RReO,, R = alkyl, aryl) on acidic metal oxide supports form metathesis catalysts that are active without additives even for functionalized ole fin.]"
[4] "Catalyst I operates at room temperature and is also suitable for the metathesis of simple open-chain and cyclic olefins (Table 1 and 2)."
[5] "Otherwise frequent side reactions such as double-bond isomerization and olefin dimerization are insignificant in the presence of 1."
[6] "Figures 1 and 2 show that I is a more efficient catalyst than Re,O,, which for functionalized olefins is active only in the presence of organotin compounds."
[7] "MTO loses maximally 5% of the organic groups as methane and ethylene on the preparation of catalyst I."
[8] "Use of CD,ReO, (>99% D) confirmed the participation of metal-coordinated CD, groups in olefin metathesis (forma- tion of CD,=CHC,H, and CD,=CH, from l-butene)."
[9] "MTO can also not be removed from the carrier by solvents."
[10] "MTO is also suitable for use in homogeneous catalyst systems for olefins that have no functional groups."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The reactions encompass linear and cyclic alkane transformations, where key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play crucial roles. The catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as reaction selectivity, the formation and role of these intermediates, and the specific conditions under which the reactions take place.

In the context of alkane metathesis, silica-supported tantalum hydrides enable the efficient conversion of both simple and complex alkane structures. The catalysts can operate under mild conditions, such as room temperature, facilitating the metathesis of a wide range of olefins, including those with functional groups. The presence of functional groups typically necessitates the use of additives, such as organotin compounds, to achieve optimal catalytic activity. However, the introduction of catalysts like MTO (methyltrioxorhenium) enhances the efficiency of the metathesis process, even in the absence of such additives, demonstrating superior catalytic properties compared to traditional catalysts like ReO3.

The mechanism involves the coordination of the alkane molecules to the metal centers of the catalyst, leading to the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds and the formation of alkenes. These alkenes subsequently rearrange through a series of reactions, facilitated by the metal centers, to produce the desired alkane products. The ability of the catalyst to maintain the integrity of the alkane backbone while selectively introducing functional groups or altering the alkane structure is a testament to its sophisticated mechanism.

The loss of organic groups as methane and ethylene during the preparation of catalysts like MTO highlights the dynamic nature of these reactions, where the catalyst undergoes minor structural changes. This process is further supported by the confirmation of metal-coordinated CD, groups participating in olefin metathesis, showcasing the intricate interplay between the catalyst structure and the chemical reactions taking place.

Moreover, the inability of MTO to be removed from the carrier by solvents underscores the strong interaction between the catalyst and the support material, contributing to its stability and catalytic efficacy. The suitability of MTO for use in homogeneous catalyst systems for olefins without functional groups expands the versatility of this catalyst in industrial applications.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a combination of bond-breaking and bond-forming reactions, facilitated by the strategic coordination of alkane molecules to the metal centers of the catalyst. The catalysts exhibit exceptional activity and selectivity, enabling efficient alkane conversions under mild conditions, with the ability to handle both simple and complex alkane structures. The detailed understanding of these mechanisms not only advances the field of catalysis but also opens avenues for the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly processes in the synthesis of valuable olefins and polymers.

催化机制涉及硅负载钽氢化物的烷烃裂合，包括双位点和单位点方案。反应涵盖了线性和环状烷烃的转换，其中关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷在其中起着关键作用。在各种烷烃转化中的催化剂性能受到反应选择性、这些中间体的作用以及反应进行时特定条件的影响。

在烷烃裂合的背景下，硅负载钽氢化物能够高效地转换各种简单和复杂的烷烃结构。催化剂能够在温和条件下操作，如室温下，促进各种烯烃的裂合，包括那些具有功能基团的烯烃。功能基团的存在通常需要添加剂（如有机锡化合物）来实现最佳催化活性。然而，引入如MTO（甲基三氧罗铑）这样的催化剂能够提高裂合过程的效率，即使在没有此类添加剂的情况下也是如此，表明与传统催化剂（如ReO3）相比具有更优越的催化特性。

该机制涉及烷烃分子与催化剂中金属中心的配合，导致碳-碳键的断裂和烯烃的形成。这些烯烃随后通过一系列反应进行重组，由金属中心促进，以产生所需的烷烃产品。催化剂能够保持烷烃骨架的完整性，同时选择性地引入功能性基团或改变烷烃结构，证明其复杂机制。

催化剂在准备过程中失去有机组分作为甲烷和乙烯，突显了这些反应的动态性质，催化剂在此期间经历了轻微的结构变化。这一过程进一步得到了金属-配位CD，组参与烯烃裂合的确认，展示了催化剂结构与正在进行的化学反应之间复杂的相互作用。

此外，MTO无法通过溶剂去除从载体的事实强调了催化剂与支撑材料之间的强烈相互作用，有助于其稳定性和催化效能。MTO对不含功能基团的烯烃在均相催化剂系统中的适用性扩大了这种催化剂的应用范围。

总之，硅负载钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合机制涉及一系列断键和成键反应，由催化剂中金属中心对烷烃分子的精确配合所促进。催化剂表现出极高的活性和选择性，能够在温和条件下高效地进行烷烃转化，能够处理从简单到复杂的烷烃结构。对这些机制的详细理解不仅推进了催化领域的研究，而且为合成有价值的烯烃和聚合物开辟了更高效和环境友好的途径。
