<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two-site and one-site schemes, leading to transformations of both linear and cyclic alkanes. Alkenes and metallacyclobutanes serve as crucial intermediates during the process. These factors significantly influence the reaction's selectivity and the performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
