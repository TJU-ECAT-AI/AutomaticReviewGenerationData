The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides comprises both two-site and one-site schemes. Linear alkane transformations are favored because they result in stable alkenes. Cyclic alkane transformations produce metallacyclobutanes, which are vital intermediates. Alkenes and metallacyclobutanes act as key intermediates contributing to high selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.
