[1] "The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues is still a great challenge in chemistry."
[2] "A highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(SiO)2TaH], catalytically transforms a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues - an alkane metathesis reaction."
[3] "Moreover, it is possible to catalyze the reverse reaction, which allows methane to be incorporated into higher alkanes."
[4] "The key step in alkane metathesis involves metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates as is the case with olefin metathesis."
[5] "This discovery led us to investigate the use of Group 6 metals, particularly W, which play a central role in olefin metathesis."
[6] "Tungsten hydride 3 has an overall turnover number of 120 mol propane mol, which is much higher than that of the best known Ta system, that is, tantalum hydrides supported on silica or alumina."
[7] "The higher selectivity of linear over branched compounds is also consistent with this model, as the latter would involve the less-reactive disubstituted carbenes."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The key processes include the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds, leading to the transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues. This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds, exemplified by the transformation of propane into ethane, butane, and methane. The reverse reaction is also possible, allowing methane to be incorporated into higher alkanes. The mechanism suggests the involvement of metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates, akin to olefin metathesis. The use of Group 6 metals, notably tungsten (W), plays a crucial role due to their stability in olefin metathesis. The catalysts based on well-defined tungsten carbyne and hydride complexes supported on alumina display improved activity and selectivity compared to tantalum-based systems. Specifically, tungsten hydride 3 demonstrates a significantly higher overall turnover number (120 mol propane mol) than the best known tantalum system, indicating superior catalytic performance. The selectivity favoring linear over branched compounds aligns with the proposed model, attributing the enhanced selectivity to the less reactive nature of disubstituted carbenes in the branching process.

烷烃裂合催化由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的全面机制涉及两站点和单站点方案。关键过程包括碳-碳键的断裂和形成，导致较低烷烃转化为较高同系物。此反应涉及选择性地断裂和形成碳-碳键，以丙烷为例，将其转化为乙烷、丁烷和甲烷。逆反应也是可能的，允许甲烷被更高烷烃吸收。该机制表明，涉及金属烯烃和金属环丁烷中间体，类似于烯烃裂合。使用第6组金属，特别是钨（W），起着关键作用，因为它们在烯烃裂合中的稳定性。基于钨卡宾和氢化物复合物的氧化物支持催化剂显示出与钽基系统相比改善的活性和选择性。具体而言，钨氢化物3的总体周转数（120 mol丙烷mol）高于已知的最佳钽系统，表明催化性能优越。选择性偏好线性化合物超过分支化合物与提出的模型一致，将增强的选择性归因于分支过程中较不活泼的二取代卡宾的性质。
