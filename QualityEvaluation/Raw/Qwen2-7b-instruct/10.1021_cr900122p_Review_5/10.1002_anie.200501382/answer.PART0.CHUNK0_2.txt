The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the selective cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds. For instance, propane metathesis yields ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes. The process can also facilitate the reverse reaction, enabling methane incorporation into higher alkanes. Metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates play crucial roles in both alkane and olefin metathesis. Tungsten hydride 3 demonstrates notably higher performance than the best known tantalum system, with an overall turnover number of 120 mol propane mol.

烷烃裂合催化由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的全面机制涉及碳-碳键的特异性断裂和形成。例如，丙烷裂合产生乙烷（45%-50%）和丁烷（30%-35%），以及甲烷和少量更高烷烃。该过程也可以促进逆反应，使甲烷融入更高烷烃中。金属卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体在烷烃和烯烃裂解中都起着关键作用。钨氢化物3的性能明显高于已知最好的钽系统，整体周转数为120 mol丙烷mol。
