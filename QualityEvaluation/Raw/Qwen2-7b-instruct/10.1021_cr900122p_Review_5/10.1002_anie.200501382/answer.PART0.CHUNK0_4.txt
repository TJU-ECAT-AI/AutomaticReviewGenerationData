<p>The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues is still a great challenge in chemistry.</p>
<p>[(SiO)2TaH], catalytically transforms a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues an alkane metathesis reaction.</p>
<p>This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds; for example, propane metathesis selectively gives ethane (4550%) and butanes (3035%) along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is possible to catalyze the reverse reaction, which allows methane to be incorporated into higher alkanes.</p>
<p>[(SiO)2TaH] as a catalyst precursor, the ratio of cross-metathesis products and the selectivity in higher alkanes led us to propose that the key step in alkane metathesis involves metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates as is the case with olefin metathesis.</p>
<p>By using surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), the goal of which is to enter directly into the catalytic cycle via reaction intermediates, several attempts have been directed at generating well-defined tungsten carbene complexes on oxide surfaces by grafting [W(CtBu)(X)3] (X=Cl, OtBu, CH2tBu).</p>
<p>Although highly active in olefin metathesis and highly electrophilic (formal 12-electron species), this complex and the corresponding hydride displayed little to no activity in alkane metathesis.</p>
<p>Therefore, we decided to generate more electrophilic centers by preparing the corresponding W alkyl and hydride on partially dehydroxylated alumina (PDA).</p>
<p>Grafting of 1 was performed typically by heating a mixture containing an excess of 1 (0.40 mmol per gram of alumina) and Al2O3-(500) at 66°C to provide solid 1Al2O3.</p>
<p>The reaction with surface hydroxy groups was only partial, as revealed by IR spectroscopy (presence of residual hydroxy groups; see Figure 1b).</p>
<p>Both results are consistent with about 2.90.15 neopentyl-like ligands per W atom for 1-Al2O3.</p>
<p>The solid-state magic-angle spinning (MAS) 1H NMR spectrum exhibits only one broad signal at δ=1.0 ppm, whereas the solid-state cross-polarization (CP)/MAS 13C NMR spectrum of the 13C-enriched complex, selectively labeled on the carbon atom bonded to the metal, displays the following features (Supporting Information): a broad and weak signal at δ=318 ppm, a broad intense signal at δ=85 ppm with a shoulder at δ=103 ppm, several signals around δ=52 ppm, and a signal at δ=32 ppm with a shoulder at δ=29 ppm.</p>
<p>These data are therefore consistent with an average structure formulated as [(AlsO)W(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2]PDA, which corresponds to a mixture of a neutral complex 2a as the probable major species (δ=8595 ppm), along with the possible minor cationic or partially cationic surface complexes 2b and 2c (δ=95110 ppm).</p>
<p>Whereas the neutral complex 2a arises from the reaction of 1 with the hydroxy groups of alumina, the partially and fully cationic surface complexes 2b and 2c would have been formed by the interaction/reaction of 2a with a neighboring Lewis acidic site; the latter complex is consistent with the formation of a small amount of [(AlsCH2tBu)] (as revealed by a shoulder at δ=29 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum).</p>
<p>The activity of species 2 and 3 is noteworthy. In contrast to the W complex supported on silica, 2 is active in the metathesis of propane under our standard conditions (Supporting Information).</p>
<p>Under similar conditions, the initial rate (89 molpropane molh1) and the TON (120 molpropane mol) after 120 h for tungsten hydride 3 are higher than those obtained with the best Ta-based catalysts.</p>
<p>The product selectivities are also noteworthy (Table 2). As observed for Ta, linear alkanes are favored over branched alkanes, and the selectivities for higher homologues are as follows: Cn+1>Cn+2Cn+3.</p>

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues, which is a significant challenge in chemistry. The catalyst [(SiO)2TaH] facilitates this reaction, enabling the conversion of a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues through an alkane metathesis process. This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds, exemplified by propane metathesis yielding ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) along with methane and smaller quantities of higher alkanes. The ability to catalyze the reverse reaction allows methane to be integrated into higher alkanes. The discovery that the key step in alkane metathesis involves metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates, similar to olefin metathesis, highlights the role of these intermediates in the catalytic cycle. Using surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), researchers aimed to generate well-defined tungsten carbene complexes on oxide surfaces by grafting [W(CtBu)(X)3] complexes onto silica or alumina, where X represents Cl, OtBu, or CH2tBu. Despite being highly active in olefin metathesis and displaying high electrophilicity, these complexes showed negligible activity in alkane metathesis. To enhance activity, the focus shifted towards generating more electrophilic centers by preparing tungsten alkyl and hydride complexes on partially dehydroxylated alumina (PDA). The grafting process involved heating an excess of complex 1 with alumina at 66°C, leading to the formation of solid 1Al2O3. The reaction with surface hydroxy groups was partial, as evidenced by residual hydroxy groups detected by IR spectroscopy. The solid exhibited a carbon content consistent with approximately 2.9-15 neopentyl-like ligands per W atom. The solid-state NMR spectra revealed a broad signal at δ=1.0 ppm and multiple signals at various δ values, indicating the presence of different types of methylene carbon atoms (CH2tBu). The structure of the catalyst was confirmed by EXAFS data, which aligned with a coordination sphere around W featuring one carbon atom, one oxygen atom, two carbon atoms at a greater distance, two carbon atoms at 3.314 Å, and a carbon atom at 3.323 Å. The formation of the final species was likely through the reaction of WH with adjacent AlOAl bridges or AlOH species. The activity of catalyst 2 and 3 was noteworthy, with 2 showing improved performance in propane metathesis compared to silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The product selectivities for higher homologues followed the pattern Cn+1>Cn+2>Cn+3, consistent with the proposed model involving carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates in alkane metathesis.

烷烃裂合由硅基支持的钽氢化物催化的全面机制分析涉及到理解将较低的烷烃转化为较高同系物的挑战，这是化学中的一个重要问题。催化剂[(SiO)2TaH]能够促进这一反应，使给定的烷烃转化为其更高和更低的同系物，通过烷烃裂合过程。这一反应涉及选择性裂解和形成碳-碳键，例如，丙烷裂合选择性地产生乙烷（45%-50%）和丁烷（30%-35%），以及甲烷和较高烷烃的小量。能够催化逆向反应允许甲烷被整合到较高烷烃中。发现烷烃裂合的关键步骤涉及金属卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体，与烯烃裂合类似，突显了这些中间体在催化循环中的作用。通过表面有机金属化学（SOMC），研究人员旨在通过在二氧化硅或氧化铝上接枝[W(CtBu)(X)3]复合物来生成定义明确的钨卡宾复合物，其中X代表Cl、OtBu或CH2tBu。尽管在烯烃裂合中表现出高度活性并显示出高电负性（形成为12电子物种），这些复合物在烷烃裂合中显示出微不足道的活性。为了提高活性，研究重点转向通过在部分脱水氧化铝（PDA）上制备钨烷基和氢化物复合物来生成更多的电负中心。接枝过程通常包括加热过量的复合物1与氧化铝在66°C下，提供固体1Al2O3。表面羟基反应仅部分发生，如红外光谱显示残留羟基的存在。该固体的碳含量与每个W原子约2.9-15个类似五甲基二聚体相一致。固体状态核磁共振谱显示一个在δ=1.0 ppm处的宽信号和多个在不同δ值处的信号，表明存在不同类型的甲基碳原子（CH2tBu）。催化剂结构通过EXAFS数据得到证实，与围绕W的配位球一致，包含一个碳原子、一个氧原子、两个距离较大的碳原子、两个距离3.314 Å的碳原子和一个距离3.323 Å的碳原子。最终物种的形成可能是通过WH与相邻的AlOAl桥或AlOH物种的反应。催化剂2和3的活性值得注意，其中2在丙烷裂合中的表现优于硅基支持的钽氢化物。较高的同系物产物的选择性遵循模式Cn+1>Cn+2>Cn+3，与预测的模型一致，该模型涉及烷烃裂合过程中卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体的作用。
