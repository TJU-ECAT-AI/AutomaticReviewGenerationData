[1] "The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues is still a great challenge in chemistry."
[2] "This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds; for example, propane metathesis selectively gives ethane (4550%) and butanes (3035%) along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes."
[3] "Moreover, it is possible to catalyze the reverse reaction, which allows methane to be incorporated into higher alkanes."
[4] "The product selectivities are also noteworthy (Table 2)."
[5] "As observed for Ta, linear alkanes are favored over branched alkanes, and the selectivities for higher homologues are as follows: Cn+1>Cn+2Cn+3."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the selective cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds. The process facilitates the transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues, with propane metathesis selectively yielding ethane and butanes. The catalysts also enable the reverse reaction, allowing methane incorporation into higher alkanes. The selectivity for higher homologues is noted, with linear alkanes being favored over branched alkanes, and the selectivities for higher homologues following the pattern Cn+1 > Cn+2 > Cn+3.

烷基化催化由硅负载的钽氢化物的全面机制涉及碳-碳键的选择性断裂和形成。该过程促进了较低烷烃向较高同系物的转变，丙烷的烷基化选择性地产生乙烷和丁烷。催化剂还允许反向反应，使甲烷融入更高同系物中。对于较高同系物的选择性被注意到，线性烷烃比支链烷烃更受青睐，较高的同系物选择性遵循模式Cn+1 > Cn+2 > Cn+3。
