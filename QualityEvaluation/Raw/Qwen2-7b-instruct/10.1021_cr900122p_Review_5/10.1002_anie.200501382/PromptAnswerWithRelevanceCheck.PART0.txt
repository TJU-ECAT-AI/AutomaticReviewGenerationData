<p>The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues is still a great challenge in chemistry.</p>
<p>A highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(SiO)2TaH], catalytically transforms a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues - an alkane metathesis reaction.</p>
<p>This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds; for example, propane metathesis selectively gives ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is possible to catalyze the reverse reaction, which allows methane to be incorporated into higher alkanes.</p>
<p>Similarly, the cross-metathesis of ethane and toluene is also catalyzed by [(SiO)2TaH].</p>
<p>With [(SiO)Ta(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] as a catalyst precursor, the ratio of cross-metathesis products and the selectivity in higher alkanes led us to propose that the key step in alkane metathesis involves metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates as is the case with olefin metathesis.</p>
<p>By using surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), the goal of which is to enter directly into the catalytic cycle via reaction intermediates, several attempts have been directed at generating well-defined tungsten carbene complexes on oxide surfaces by grafting [W(CtBu)(X)3] (X=Cl, OtBu, CH2tBu).</p>
<p>It was proposed that metallocarbenes were formed on the basis of their activity in olefin metathesis.</p>
<p>However, the complex and the corresponding hydride displayed little to no activity in alkane metathesis.</p>
<p>Therefore, we decided to generate more electrophilic centers by preparing the corresponding W alkyl and hydride on partially dehydroxylated alumina (PDA).</p>
<p>Grafting of molecular complex 1 on Al2O3-(500) to give 2.</p>
<p>The preparation of the corresponding hydride was then investigated.</p>
<p>The activity of species 2 and 3 is noteworthy.</p>
<p>In contrast to the W complex supported on silica, 2 is active in the metathesis of propane under our standard conditions.</p>
<p>The initial rate is 1.8 mol propane mol h-1, which is slightly lower than that of [(SiO)Ta(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (3.0 mol propane mol h-1, turnover number (TON)=35 mol propane mol at 120 h), but the TONs after 120 h are similar, which indicates that deactivation of this catalyst is slower.</p>
<p>Under similar conditions, the initial rate (89 mol propane mol h-1) and the TON (120 mol propane mol) after 120 h for tungsten hydride 3 are higher than those obtained with the best Ta-based catalysts.</p>
<p>For example, the initial rate and TON at 120 h for [(SiO)2TaH] are 34 mol propane mol h-1 and 60 mol propane mol under the same experimental conditions.</p>
<p>Thus, W is indeed the key to the improved activity in alkane metathesis.</p>

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the selective cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds. In the alkane metathesis reaction, a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica catalyzes the transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues, producing ethane and butanes selectively along with methane. The reverse reaction allows methane to be incorporated into higher alkanes. The key steps in alkane metathesis are suggested to involve metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates, similar to olefin metathesis. Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) has been utilized to generate well-defined tungsten carbene complexes on oxide surfaces, aiming to directly enter into the catalytic cycle via reaction intermediates. The grafting of molecular complex 1 on Al2O3-(500) results in the formation of a tungsten-based catalyst, 2. Further investigation into the preparation of the corresponding tungsten hydride, 3, has shown notable activity in alkane metathesis. Compared to silica-supported tantalum hydrides, tungsten-based catalysts exhibit improved activity in alkane metathesis, with a higher overall turnover number (TON) and selectivity for higher homologues. The enhanced activity is attributed to the intrinsic properties of tungsten, contributing to catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The key processes include the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds, leading to the transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues. This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds, exemplified by the transformation of propane into ethane, butane, and methane. The reverse reaction is also possible, allowing methane to be incorporated into higher alkanes. The mechanism suggests the involvement of metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates, akin to olefin metathesis. The use of Group 6 metals, notably tungsten (W), plays a crucial role due to their stability in olefin metathesis. The catalysts based on well-defined tungsten carbyne and hydride complexes supported on alumina display improved activity and selectivity compared to tantalum-based systems. Specifically, tungsten hydride 3 demonstrates a significantly higher overall turnover number (120 mol propane mol) than the best known tantalum system, indicating superior catalytic performance. The selectivity favoring linear over branched compounds aligns with the proposed model, attributing the enhanced selectivity to the less reactive nature of disubstituted carbenes in the branching process.

烷烃裂合催化由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的全面机制涉及两站点和单站点方案。关键过程包括碳-碳键的断裂和形成，导致较低烷烃转化为较高同系物。此反应涉及选择性地断裂和形成碳-碳键，以丙烷为例，将其转化为乙烷、丁烷和甲烷。逆反应也是可能的，允许甲烷被更高烷烃吸收。该机制表明，涉及金属烯烃和金属环丁烷中间体，类似于烯烃裂合。使用第6组金属，特别是钨（W），起着关键作用，因为它们在烯烃裂合中的稳定性。基于钨卡宾和氢化物复合物的氧化物支持催化剂显示出与钽基系统相比改善的活性和选择性。具体而言，钨氢化物3的总体周转数（120 mol丙烷mol）高于已知的最佳钽系统，表明催化性能优越。选择性偏好线性化合物超过分支化合物与提出的模型一致，将增强的选择性归因于分支过程中较不活泼的二取代卡宾的性质。

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues, which is a significant challenge in chemistry. The catalyst [(SiO)2TaH] facilitates this reaction, enabling the conversion of a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues through an alkane metathesis process. This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds, exemplified by propane metathesis yielding ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) along with methane and smaller quantities of higher alkanes. The ability to catalyze the reverse reaction allows methane to be integrated into higher alkanes. The discovery that the key step in alkane metathesis involves metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates, similar to olefin metathesis, highlights the role of these intermediates in the catalytic cycle. Using surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), researchers aimed to generate well-defined tungsten carbene complexes on oxide surfaces by grafting [W(CtBu)(X)3] complexes onto silica or alumina, where X represents Cl, OtBu, or CH2tBu. Despite being highly active in olefin metathesis and displaying high electrophilicity, these complexes showed negligible activity in alkane metathesis. To enhance activity, the focus shifted towards generating more electrophilic centers by preparing tungsten alkyl and hydride complexes on partially dehydroxylated alumina (PDA). The grafting process involved heating an excess of complex 1 with alumina at 66°C, leading to the formation of solid 1Al2O3. The reaction with surface hydroxy groups was partial, as evidenced by residual hydroxy groups detected by IR spectroscopy. The solid exhibited a carbon content consistent with approximately 2.9-15 neopentyl-like ligands per W atom. The solid-state NMR spectra revealed a broad signal at δ=1.0 ppm and multiple signals at various δ values, indicating the presence of different types of methylene carbon atoms (CH2tBu). The structure of the catalyst was confirmed by EXAFS data, which aligned with a coordination sphere around W featuring one carbon atom, one oxygen atom, two carbon atoms at a greater distance, two carbon atoms at 3.314 Å, and a carbon atom at 3.323 Å. The formation of the final species was likely through the reaction of WH with adjacent AlOAl bridges or AlOH species. The activity of catalyst 2 and 3 was noteworthy, with 2 showing improved performance in propane metathesis compared to silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The product selectivities for higher homologues followed the pattern Cn+1>Cn+2>Cn+3, consistent with the proposed model involving carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates in alkane metathesis.

烷烃裂合由硅基支持的钽氢化物催化的全面机制分析涉及到理解将较低的烷烃转化为较高同系物的挑战，这是化学中的一个重要问题。催化剂[(SiO)2TaH]能够促进这一反应，使给定的烷烃转化为其更高和更低的同系物，通过烷烃裂合过程。这一反应涉及选择性裂解和形成碳-碳键，例如，丙烷裂合选择性地产生乙烷（45%-50%）和丁烷（30%-35%），以及甲烷和较高烷烃的小量。能够催化逆向反应允许甲烷被整合到较高烷烃中。发现烷烃裂合的关键步骤涉及金属卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体，与烯烃裂合类似，突显了这些中间体在催化循环中的作用。通过表面有机金属化学（SOMC），研究人员旨在通过在二氧化硅或氧化铝上接枝[W(CtBu)(X)3]复合物来生成定义明确的钨卡宾复合物，其中X代表Cl、OtBu或CH2tBu。尽管在烯烃裂合中表现出高度活性并显示出高电负性（形成为12电子物种），这些复合物在烷烃裂合中显示出微不足道的活性。为了提高活性，研究重点转向通过在部分脱水氧化铝（PDA）上制备钨烷基和氢化物复合物来生成更多的电负中心。接枝过程通常包括加热过量的复合物1与氧化铝在66°C下，提供固体1Al2O3。表面羟基反应仅部分发生，如红外光谱显示残留羟基的存在。该固体的碳含量与每个W原子约2.9-15个类似五甲基二聚体相一致。固体状态核磁共振谱显示一个在δ=1.0 ppm处的宽信号和多个在不同δ值处的信号，表明存在不同类型的甲基碳原子（CH2tBu）。催化剂结构通过EXAFS数据得到证实，与围绕W的配位球一致，包含一个碳原子、一个氧原子、两个距离较大的碳原子、两个距离3.314 Å的碳原子和一个距离3.323 Å的碳原子。最终物种的形成可能是通过WH与相邻的AlOAl桥或AlOH物种的反应。催化剂2和3的活性值得注意，其中2在丙烷裂合中的表现优于硅基支持的钽氢化物。较高的同系物产物的选择性遵循模式Cn+1>Cn+2>Cn+3，与预测的模型一致，该模型涉及烷烃裂合过程中卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体的作用。
