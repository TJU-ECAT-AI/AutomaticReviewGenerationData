<p>The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues is still a great challenge in chemistry.</p>
<p>A highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(SiO)2TaH], catalytically transforms a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues - an alkane metathesis reaction.</p>
<p>This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds; for example, propane metathesis selectively gives ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is possible to catalyze the reverse reaction, which allows methane to be incorporated into higher alkanes.</p>
<p>Similarly, the cross-metathesis of ethane and toluene is also catalyzed by [(SiO)2TaH].</p>
<p>With [(SiO)Ta(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] as a catalyst precursor, the ratio of cross-metathesis products and the selectivity in higher alkanes led us to propose that the key step in alkane metathesis involves metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates as is the case with olefin metathesis.</p>
<p>By using surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), the goal of which is to enter directly into the catalytic cycle via reaction intermediates, several attempts have been directed at generating well-defined tungsten carbene complexes on oxide surfaces by grafting [W(CtBu)(X)3] (X=Cl, OtBu, CH2tBu).</p>
<p>It was proposed that metallocarbenes were formed on the basis of their activity in olefin metathesis.</p>
<p>However, the complex and the corresponding hydride displayed little to no activity in alkane metathesis.</p>
<p>Therefore, we decided to generate more electrophilic centers by preparing the corresponding W alkyl and hydride on partially dehydroxylated alumina (PDA).</p>
<p>Grafting of molecular complex 1 on Al2O3-(500) to give 2.</p>
<p>The preparation of the corresponding hydride was then investigated.</p>
<p>The activity of species 2 and 3 is noteworthy.</p>
<p>In contrast to the W complex supported on silica, 2 is active in the metathesis of propane under our standard conditions.</p>
<p>The initial rate is 1.8 mol propane mol h-1, which is slightly lower than that of [(SiO)Ta(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (3.0 mol propane mol h-1, turnover number (TON)=35 mol propane mol at 120 h), but the TONs after 120 h are similar, which indicates that deactivation of this catalyst is slower.</p>
<p>Under similar conditions, the initial rate (89 mol propane mol h-1) and the TON (120 mol propane mol) after 120 h for tungsten hydride 3 are higher than those obtained with the best Ta-based catalysts.</p>
<p>For example, the initial rate and TON at 120 h for [(SiO)2TaH] are 34 mol propane mol h-1 and 60 mol propane mol under the same experimental conditions.</p>
<p>Thus, W is indeed the key to the improved activity in alkane metathesis.</p>

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the selective cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds. In the alkane metathesis reaction, a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica catalyzes the transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues, producing ethane and butanes selectively along with methane. The reverse reaction allows methane to be incorporated into higher alkanes. The key steps in alkane metathesis are suggested to involve metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates, similar to olefin metathesis. Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) has been utilized to generate well-defined tungsten carbene complexes on oxide surfaces, aiming to directly enter into the catalytic cycle via reaction intermediates. The grafting of molecular complex 1 on Al2O3-(500) results in the formation of a tungsten-based catalyst, 2. Further investigation into the preparation of the corresponding tungsten hydride, 3, has shown notable activity in alkane metathesis. Compared to silica-supported tantalum hydrides, tungsten-based catalysts exhibit improved activity in alkane metathesis, with a higher overall turnover number (TON) and selectivity for higher homologues. The enhanced activity is attributed to the intrinsic properties of tungsten, contributing to catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

烷基化催化由硅支持的钽氢化物的全面机制涉及碳-碳键的有选择性断裂和形成。在烷基化反应中，硅上支持的高电子亲性的钽氢化物催化较低烷烃转化为较高同系物，产生乙烷和丁烷等，同时伴有甲烷。反向反应允许甲烷被较高烷烃吸收。烷基化反应的关键步骤被认为是金属卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体，类似于烯烃的烷基化。表面有机金属化学（SOMC）已被用于在氧化物表面上生成定义明确的钨卡宾复合物，旨在直接通过反应中间体进入催化循环。分子复合物1在Al2O3-(500)上的接枝产生了钨基催化剂2。对相应钨氢化物3的制备进一步研究显示，在烷基化反应中有显著活性。与硅支持的钽氢化物相比，钨基催化剂在烷基化反应中的活性得到提高，整体周转数（TON）更高，并且对较高同系物的选择性也更好。活性的增强归因于钨的内在性质，从而促进了各种烷烃转换的催化剂性能。
