This paper presents the results of a study of the methanedeuterium exchange reaction for a range of metal oxides.
Interestingly, particularly with respect to their potential dehydrogenation role in other catalytic systems, Ga2O3 was found to be the most active by a considerable margin followed by ZnO.
The results indicate that the oxide basicity may be an important factor in the activation of methane, although basicity arguments cannot be used to rationalise the dataset as a whole.

The study focused on the methanedeuterium exchange reaction over a variety of metal oxides. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) emerged as the most active material, significantly outperforming other oxides. Zinc oxide (ZnO) also showed substantial activity. The researchers noted that while oxide basicity seems to play a role in methane activation, it cannot solely explain the dataset's outcomes.

The paper does not provide a detailed mechanism for alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question based on the provided document.
