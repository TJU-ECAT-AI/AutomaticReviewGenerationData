The most active materials for alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides are gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and zinc oxide (ZnO). These materials show enhanced activity when doped with donor elements like Al3+ or Ga3+, while acceptor elements like Li+ result in a retarding effect. The relationship between activity patterns and reduction is complex, as illustrated by the low activity of ferric oxide (Fe3O4) despite its expected reduction during testing. The activity patterns for first-row transition metal oxides align with those observed in hydrogenation and hydrogendeuterium exchange reactions, suggesting a similar mechanism. However, this relationship does not apply universally across all tested materials, indicating different rate-determining steps for different oxide groupings. Sequential pathways seem to operate in most cases, but exceptions like cobalt oxide (Co3O4)- and tantalum oxide (Ta2O5)-based materials complicate this pattern. In the case of Co3O4, complete reduction to metallic cobalt occurs upon reaction.

催化硅基钽氢化物的烷烃裂合反应中，活性最高的材料是镓氧化物（Ga2O3）和锌氧化物（ZnO）。当掺杂捐赠元素如Al3+或Ga3+时，这些材料显示出增强的活性，而接受剂元素如Li+则会减慢反应速率。活动性与还原的关系较为复杂，以铁氧化物（Fe3O4）为例，尽管其预期在反应中会被还原，但其活性却相对较低。第一行过渡金属氧化物的活性模式与氢化和氢氘交换反应观察到的现象相似，这表明它们可能遵循相同的机制。然而，并非所有测试过的常见材料都能适用这种关系，暗示不同氧化物组分可能有不同的决定速率步骤。大多数情况下，活性模式显示了顺序途径的作用，但像钴氧化物（Co3O4）-和钽氧化物（Ta2O5）-基材料这样的例外使得这一模式变得复杂。对于Co3O4，完全的还原导致反应后形成金属钴。
