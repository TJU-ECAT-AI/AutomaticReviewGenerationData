The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. Linear alkane transformations typically result in the formation of an alkene intermediate, which undergoes a concerted rearrangement to regenerate the catalyst. For cyclic alkane conversions, the formation of metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates often necessitates specific conditions. Reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are largely determined by the interaction between the ligand environment and the metal center.
