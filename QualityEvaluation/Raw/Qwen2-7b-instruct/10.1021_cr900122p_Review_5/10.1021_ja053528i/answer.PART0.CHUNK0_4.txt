[1] "The role of X and Y ligands for efficient active sites in re-based olefin metathesis catalysts has been extensively studied."
[2] "In re(Cr)2(CrH)(CH3)(X)(Y) complexes, the nature of X and Y ligands significantly influences the catalytic activity and selectivity."
[3] "Linear alkane metathesis typically involves the formation of an alkene intermediate, followed by a concerted rearrangement to regenerate the catalyst."
[4] "Cyclic alkane transformations often require specific conditions to promote the formation of metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates."
[5] "The reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are largely determined by the interplay between the ligand environment and the metal center."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. Linear alkane transformations typically result in the formation of an alkene intermediate, which undergoes a concerted rearrangement to regenerate the catalyst. For cyclic alkane conversions, the formation of metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates often necessitates specific conditions. Reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are largely determined by the interaction between the ligand environment and the metal center.
