Catalytic Methods for CH Bond Functionalization: Application in Organic Synthesis Fumitoshi Kakiuchi*, Naoto Chatani Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan Fax:  81-6-6879-7396, e-mail: kakiuchi@chem.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp Received: May 12, 2003; Accepted: July 17, 2003 Abstract: The development of catalytic reactions involving carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage is currently one of the most attractive research subjects in organic and organometallic chemistry. About 40 years have past since the pioneering report of the cleavage of CH bonds with transition metal complexes. Since that time, a vast number of studies of the cleavage of CH bonds, using stoichiometric amounts of transi- tion metal complexes has appeared. In the last decade, a variety of catalytic reactions involving CH bond cleavage has been reported. In this review we briefly survey the results of these research activities with respect to the catalytic use of unreac- tive CH bonds in organic synthesis. 1 Introduction 2 Catalytic CC Bond Formation via CH Bond Cleavage

The development of catalytic reactions that involve the cleavage of carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds is a highly attractive research topic in organic and organometallic chemistry. This area has seen significant progress over the past 40 years, with numerous studies focusing on the cleavage of CH bonds using stoichiometric amounts of transition metal complexes. In the last decade, a variety of catalytic reactions that involve the cleavage of CH bonds have been reported. This review aims to provide a brief overview of these research activities, focusing on the catalytic utilization of otherwise unreactive CH bonds in organic synthesis.

碳氢（CH）键的断裂催化反应在有机和配位金属化学领域是一个极具吸引力的研究主题。过去40年来，这一领域取得了显著进展，出现了大量的研究，关注的是使用过渡金属复合物的定量量来裂解CH键。在过去十年中，报道了一种多样化的催化反应，涉及CH键的断裂。本文旨在提供一个简要的概述，重点关注在有机合成中利用其他不可反应的CH键的催化利用。
