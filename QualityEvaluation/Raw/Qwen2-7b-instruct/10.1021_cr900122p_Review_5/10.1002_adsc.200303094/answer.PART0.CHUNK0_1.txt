[4] "In the case of the reaction of aromatic ketones with olefins, a sterically bulky substituent on the ortho position or a heteroatom at the α position of the enals is essential for the reaction to proceed catalytically."
[5] "The acylation of the sp3 CH bond adjacent to a nitrogen atom can be attained by means of chelation-assisted CH bond cleavage."
[6] "When the reaction of phenylpyridine with CO (20 atm) and ethylene is conducted at 160C, the ortho CH bond (to the sp2 nitrogen) in the benzene ring undergoes carbonylation."

1. The development of catalytic reactions involving carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage is a highly attractive research area in organic and organometallic chemistry.

2. Electron-withdrawing groups such as CF3 and CN groups enhance the reactivity in the CH/olefin coupling reaction of substituted arenes.

3. Trimethylvinylsilane exhibited superior reactivity (100% yield within 1 hour) compared to triethoxyvinylsilane (97% yield after 24 hours) in an alkylation process.

4. Sterically bulky substituents on the ortho position or a heteroatom at the α position of the enals are crucial for the catalytic reaction of aromatic ketones with olefins.

5. Chelation-assisted CH bond cleavage enables the acylation of the sp3 carbon adjacent to a nitrogen atom.

6. Carbonylation of the ortho CH bond (adjacent to the sp2 nitrogen) in the benzene ring of phenylpyridine occurs when reacting with CO (20 atm) and ethylene at 160°C.
