[1] "During the past 40 years, CH bond cleavage, so-called CH bond activation was an intriguing research subject mainly for inorganic and organometallic chemists."
[2] "A variety of catalytic reactions involving CH bond cleavage have become popular and various types of transformation such as CH/olefin, CH/acetylene, CH/CO/olefin, CH/aryl, CH/SiR3, and CH/B(OR)2 couplings, and dehydrogenation of alkanes have appeared in the literature."
[3] "In the case of the reaction of pentane with 4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5-octamethyl-2,2-bi-1,3,2-dioxaobolane (B2pin2) using Cp*Re(CO)3 as catalyst, CB bond formation occurs exclusively at the methyl CH bond."
[4] "The first example of the catalytic version of the borylation reaction was accomplished in 1999, Eq. (71)."
[5] "The presence of 4,4-di-tert-butyl-2,2-pipyridine (dtbpy) dramatically improves the activity of the iridium catalyst for aromatic CH/Bpin2 coupling."
[6] "The growth of this research area has been rapid, but the applicability of this type of coupling reaction to the synthesis of complex molecules is insufficient."
[7] "In the coming decade, it is likely that developments of fascinating synthetic protocols involving unreactive CH bond cleavage will be reported in organic synthesis."
