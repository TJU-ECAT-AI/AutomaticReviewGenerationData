[4] "The first example of the catalytic version of the borylation reaction was accomplished in 1999, Eq. (71)."
[5] "The presence of 4,4-di-tert-butyl-2,2-pipyridine (dtbpy) dramatically improves the activity of the iridium catalyst for aromatic CH/Bpin2 coupling."
[6] "The growth of this research area has been rapid, but the applicability of this type of coupling reaction to the synthesis of complex molecules is insufficient."
