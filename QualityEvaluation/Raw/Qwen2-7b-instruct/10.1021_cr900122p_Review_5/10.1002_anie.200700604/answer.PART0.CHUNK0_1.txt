<p>Compared to hydrogen peroxide, molecular oxygen has the advantage that it is inexpensive (for example, air can often be used), but it has the disadvantage that rigorous safety handling is required for large-scale applications.</p>
<p>For molecular oxygen, which has a triplet ground state, this high-energy barrier is nature's way of protecting organic compounds from destructive oxidation.</p>
<p>The electrons are passed in multistep redox processes from an energy-rich electron donor to oxygen.</p>
<p>There are various examples where the metal is directly reoxidized by O2 or H2O2.</p>
<p>Another strategy is to mimic biological oxidation systems and squeeze in an electron-transfer mediator (ETM) between the substrate-selective redox catalyst and O2 or H2O2.</p>
<p>As a result of the similarities with biological systems, this can be dubbed a biomimetic approach.</p>
<p>One way to develop an aerobic oxidation system would be to allow the generated ruthenium hydride to add to benzoquinone.</p>
<p>To obtain good efficiency it was necessary to employ [RuCl(OAc)(PPh3)3] as the catalyst and to use Co(salophen) (with a PPh3 ligand) as the oxygen-activating catalyst.</p>
<p>The biomimetic catalytic system was extended to the aerobic oxidation of secondary alcohols.</p>
<p>It was proposed that the ruthenium catalyst dehydrogenates the alcohol to give a ruthenium hydride (RuH2(PPh3)3) species that reacts with TEMPO.</p>
<p>The reduced form of TEMPO (TEMPOH) reacts with molecular oxygen to regenerate TEMPO.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that other transition metals can be used in coupled electron-transfer systems for H2O2- and O2- based oxidations of alcohols (see Sections 5 and 6).</p>
<p>In 1976 efficient oxidants for the reoxidation of OsVI to OsVIII in catalytic dihydroxylations were reported for the first time.</p>
<p>The Upjohn procedure, in which N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) is employed as the oxidant, was a major breakthrough and led to the frequent use of the osmium-catalyzed dihydroxylation.</p>
<p>It was indeed shown that stepwise transfer of oxygen from the peroxorhenium species via an amine N-oxide proceeds along a low-energy electron-transfer pathway whereas direct oxygen transfer from the peroxorhenium to an OsVI species requires a much higher activation energy.</p>
<p>The synthetic utility of the heterogeneous LDH-PdOsW catalyst was demonstrated by the synthesis of diltiazem and the taxol side chain.</p>
<p>The system was applied to the aerobic oxidation of a number of alcohols including primary and secondary benzylic, allylic, and aliphatic alcohols in good yields.</p>
<p>The system offered an advantage over that described by Sheldon and co-workers in that it did not require the use of additives, and the catalyst could be recycled and reused up to three times without loss of activity.</p>
<p>The combination of MnII/CuII nitrates with TEMPO also permits the aerobic oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to give aldehydes and ketones in excellent yields under very mild conditions.</p>

The document provides an extensive overview of biomimetic approaches in the field of catalytic oxidations, focusing on the use of transition metals as catalysts for the oxidation of organic substrates with molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide. It covers a variety of metal-catalyzed oxidations, including palladium-, ruthenium-, osmium-, copper-, and other metal-catalyzed oxidations, as well as metal-free catalyzed oxidations. The text discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide as oxidants, the challenges associated with direct reoxidation of metals by these oxidants, and the strategies employed to overcome these challenges through the use of electron-transfer mediators (ETMs). The document highlights the similarities between these biomimetic oxidation processes and biological systems, particularly the respiratory chain involved in aerobic oxidations in living organisms. It also describes the mechanisms behind the use of ETMs to facilitate electron transfer from the catalyst to the oxidant, leading to more efficient oxidation reactions. The document further explores specific examples of biomimetic oxidations, including palladium-catalyzed Wacker oxidation, ruthenium-catalyzed dehydrogenations, osmium-catalyzed dihydroxylations, copper-catalyzed oxidations, and others. It discusses the use of various ETMs such as benzoquinone, hydroquinone, metal complexes, and flavins in these processes and the role of these ETMs in enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the oxidations. The document also mentions the development of recyclable and reusable catalyst systems and the rationalization of these processes using computational methods like density functional theory (DFT). Lastly, it highlights the application of these biomimetic oxidations in the synthesis of various chemical compounds, including dihydroxylation of alkenes, synthesis of chiral diols, and synthesis of pharmaceuticals like diltiazem and taxol side chains.
