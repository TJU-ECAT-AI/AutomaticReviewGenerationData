1. The oxidation of activated primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively, was carried out using molecular oxygen in the presence of a molybdenum/copper system as the catalyst. Different molybdenum complexes were evaluated, with acetylacetonate (acac) being the most effective ligand for the reaction. 
2. In 2005, Liang and colleagues reported an iron/TEMPO/NaNO2 catalyst system for the selective and mild aerobic oxidation of a wide range of alcohols, even those containing CC double bonds as well as nitrogen and sulfur atoms. The alcohol was selectively oxidized to an aldehyde, while the sulfide remained unchanged in a control experiment.
3. This system provides advantages over previous methods for the tungstate-catalyzed epoxidation of olefins by hydrogen peroxide, such as using molecular oxygen instead of hydrogen peroxide as the terminal oxidant and the tungsten catalyst being soluble in the reaction mixture when oxidized but insoluble when reduced.
4. Recently, Beller and colleagues reported an iron-catalyzed biomimetic epoxidation of olefins by hydrogen peroxide.
5. In most oxidations, the substrate-selective catalyst is a nitroxyl radical derived from compounds like N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI), N-hydroxysaccharin (NHS), and TEMPOH, often combined with metal salts such as cobalt, copper, and manganese salts.
6. Flavins, typically used as electron transfer mediators, can be utilized as the substrate-selective redox catalyst for the mild oxidation of amines and sulfides at room temperature, with hydrogen peroxide serving as the sole reoxidant.
7. The mechanism of this biomimetic oxidation involves the oxidation of the sulfide by a hydroperoxyflavin species, leading to the formation of a sulfoxide and hydroxyflavin, which subsequently undergoes dehydration to produce an oxidized flavin. At this point, the oxidized flavin can either be transformed to hydroperoxyflavin through hydrogen peroxide or reduced by hydrazine to a reduced flavin, which can be oxidized by molecular oxygen to regenerate the hydroperoxyflavin.

1. 在一个例子中，激活的一级和二级醇被分子氧在钼/铜系统催化剂的作用下氧化成相应的醛和酮。研究人员评估了不同的钼配合物，以苄基醇作为底物，表明配体的性质对反应的成功至关重要，其中乙酰乙酸酯（acac）是最有效的配体。
2. 2005年，梁等人报道了一种铁/TEMPO/NaNO2催化剂系统，用于选择性地温和氧化一系列醇，即使底物中含有CC双键以及氮和硫原子也是如此。在控制实验中，将混合的醇（苯甲醇或2-辛醇）与甲基苯基硫代物一起处理，醇被选择性氧化为醛，而硫代物保持不变。
3. 这个系统比之前描述的方法进行钨催化过氧化物氧化烯烃时的优势在于：首先，末端氧化剂是分子氧而不是过氧化氢；其次，钨催化剂基于四烷基铵杂多氧钨酸盐，在氧化时可溶于反应介质中，但在还原时不可溶。
4. 最近，贝尔勒及其同事报告了一种铁催化的生物模拟氧化反应，使用过氧化氢氧化烯烃。
5. 大多数氧化反应中，选择性催化剂是一种源自N-羟基邻苯二甲酰亚胺（NHPI）、N-羟基糖苷（NHS）和TEMPOH等化合物的硝基肟自由基，通常与钴、铜和锰盐等金属盐结合使用。
6. 在自然中，存在于单加氧酶中的黄素（flavins）利用分子氧作为氧化剂。这一过程需要一个辅因子来减少在羟基黄素生成后氧化底物的羟基黄素，而在自然中这个辅因子是NADPH。
7. 伊马达、村上等人模仿这一过程，开发了一种在室温下通过黄素催化氧化硫化物到硫醚的生化氧化法。在催化循环中，硫化物由羟基过氧黄素（FOOH）物种氧化生成硫醚和羟基黄素（FOH），后者脱水生成氧化黄素（F+）。在此之后，F+可以通过过氧化氢转化为羟基过氧黄素（FOOH），或者通过使用肼进行还原形成还原黄素（FH），然后由分子氧氧化回羟基过氧黄素（FOOH，见方案22）。

[1] "The development of new processes that employ transition metals as substrate-selective catalysts and stoichiometric environmentally friendly oxidants, such as molec- ular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, is one of the most important goals in oxidation chemistry."
[2] "There are various examples where the metal is directly reoxidized by O2 or H2O2."
[3] "The unfavorable kinetics associated with direct aerobic oxidations is circumvented in the respiratory chain, which is involved in many biological oxidations."
[4] "For a catalytic oxidation reaction, the substrate-selective catalyst, which may often be a transition metal (Mn+2/Mn),oxidizes the substrate to the desired product."
[5] "The selection of quinone as the oxidant for the palladium is based on the fact that quinones are well-known oxidants and electron carriers in palladium-catalyzed oxidations."
[6] "Under the reaction conditions for the transforma- tions described in Schemes 5 and 6, it is not possible to directly reoxidize the hydroquinone formed with molecular oxygen, and therefore an additional ETM is required."
[7] "The high kinetic control is due to the fact that there is a coordination between those redox couples that interact; for example, O2 coordinates to MLm,[29] HQ binds to the metal macrocycle,[30] Pd0 is known to coordinate to BQ,[31] and finally PdII forms a complex with the diene."
[8] "It is important to point out that there are four oxidants with decreasing oxidation potentials[28] (O2, (MLm)ox, BQ, and PdII) and four components that can be oxidized (MLm, hydroquinone (HQ), Pd0, and diene)."
[9] "The direct oxidation of palladium(0) by molecular oxygen in acetic acid is slow under these conditions.[27]"
[10] "The use of coupled catalytic systems with ETMs (such as that in Scheme 3) is an important complement to the simple systems based on direct reoxidation of the metal by O2 or H2O2, and significantly extends the use of oxygen and H2O2 as the final oxidants in metal-catalyzed reactions."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The two-site scheme refers to the simultaneous rearrangement of two alkane molecules, while the one-site scheme involves the rearrangement of a single alkane molecule. The process typically begins with the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which then undergoes rearrangement to form a new alkene. Key intermediates in the reaction include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These factors contribute to the reaction selectivity by controlling the direction of the rearrangement and the stability of the intermediates. The catalyst performance is influenced by the support material, which in this case is silica, and the nature of the tantalum hydride, which provides the active site for the alkane metathesis. The selectivity and efficiency of the reaction are enhanced by the proper choice of conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of solvents, which facilitate the formation and stabilization of the intermediates.

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes, as well as the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in the mechanism. The formation and role of these intermediates contribute significantly to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit distinct mechanisms for alkane metathesis, depending on whether the process is classified as a two-site or one-site scheme. In the two-site mechanism, a single catalyst molecule facilitates the formation of an intermediate, followed by a second step where the intermediate rearranges to form the final product. In contrast, the one-site mechanism involves a single step where the catalyst molecule directly transforms an alkane into its metathesis product without the formation of an intermediate.

During the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes, the formation of alkenes is a critical intermediate. These alkenes participate in subsequent reactions to generate the desired alkene products. Metallacyclobutanes also emerge as key intermediates during the metathesis process, particularly when dealing with cyclic alkane conversions. These metallacyclobutanes undergo rearrangement reactions to yield the final alkene products.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by several factors. The nature of the catalyst, including the type of support material (silica in this case) and the specific properties of the metal (tantalum hydrides), play significant roles. Additionally, the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions, as well as the ability to regenerate the catalyst for reuse, contribute to its overall effectiveness.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit advantages over other catalysts in alkane metathesis, particularly in terms of terminal oxidants and catalyst solubility. In comparison to tungstate-catalyzed epoxidation, the silica-supported tantalum hydrides utilize molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant, providing a more environmentally friendly option. Furthermore, the tungsten catalyst based on a quaternary ammonium heteropolyoxotungstate allows for facile catalyst recovery through simple filtration, offering benefits akin to both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts.

The molybdenum complex in the alcohol oxidation system acts as the oxidant, while the copper salt serves as the co-catalyst (electron transfer mediator) that activates molecular oxygen. Different ligands, such as acetylacetonate, influence the success of the reaction. The mechanism of this system is similar to that of the copper/TEMPO system, where the alcohol is oxidized by the action of the iron/TEMPO system, and sodium nitrite provides NO2, which reoxidizes the iron/TEMPO system to generate NO. The NO is easily oxidized by molecular oxygen.

In the case of palladium, stabilization by maleic anhydride does not lead to a catalytic oxidation with molecular oxygen. This suggests that the stabilization method is not effective in promoting the desired reaction. The absence of palladium black precipitation indicates that the palladium remains in a stable state, preventing the formation of a catalytically active species.

Alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides showcases a robust mechanism involving the formation and manipulation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as intermediates. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by various factors, including the nature of the catalyst, the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions, and the regeneration capabilities of the catalyst. These catalysts offer significant advantages in alkane metathesis, particularly in terms of terminal oxidants and catalyst solubility, contributing to their effectiveness in various alkane conversions.

分析由硅基支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂解机制涉及理解两种位点和单一位点方案，以及线性与环烷烃转换过程中所涉及的过程。关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，在机制中扮演着重要角色。这些中间体的形成和作用对催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能有着显著影响。

硅基支持的钽氢化物在烷烃裂解过程中表现出不同的机制，这取决于是否将过程分类为两种位点或单一位点方案。在两种位点机制中，单个催化剂分子促进中间体的形成，随后是第二步，中间体重组形成最终产物。相比之下，单一位点机制涉及一步反应，其中催化剂分子直接将烷烃转化为目标烯烃产品，而无需形成中间体。

在处理线性和环烷烃转换时，烯烃的形成是关键中间体。这些烯烃参与后续反应以生成所需的烯烃产品。金属环丁烷也作为关键中间体在裂解过程中出现，特别是在处理环烷烃转换时。这些金属环丁烷经历重排反应以产生最终的烯烃产品。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能受多种因素的影响。催化剂的性质，包括支持材料（在这种情况下为硅）和金属的具体属性（钽氢化物），在这一过程中发挥重要作用。此外，催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性，以及催化剂的再生能力，对于其整体有效性至关重要。

硅基支持的钽氢化物在烷烃裂解中展现出优势，特别是与终端氧化剂和催化剂溶解性有关。与钨基催化环氧烷化相比，硅基支持的钽氢化物利用分子氧作为终端氧化剂，提供更环保的选择。此外，基于四元铵杂多钨酸盐的钨催化剂允许通过简单的过滤轻松回收催化剂，提供类似于均相和非均相催化剂的优点。

钼复合物在醇氧化系统中充当氧化剂，而铜盐作为协同催化剂（电子转移媒介），激活分子氧。不同配体，例如乙酰乙酸酯，影响反应的成功。这种系统的机制类似于铜/TEMPO系统，其中醇被铁/TEMPO系统氧化，而钠硝酸盐提供NO2，重新氧化铁/TEMPO系统产生NO。NO很容易被分子氧氧化。

在钯的情况下，通过马来酸酐稳定并未导致分子氧催化氧化。这表明这种方法在促进所需反应方面是无效的。没有形成钯黑沉淀表明钯保持稳定状态，防止形成催化活性物种。

硅基支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂解展示了强大的机制，涉及到烯烃和金属环丁烷作为中间体的形成和操作。催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能受多种因素的影响，包括催化剂的性质、催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性以及催化剂的再生能力。这些催化剂在烷烃裂解中展现出显著优势，特别是在终端氧化剂和催化剂溶解性方面，有助于它们在各种烷烃转化中的有效作用。

[113] In this catalytic system, molybdenum acts as the oxidant of the alcohol and the copper salt acts as the co-catalyst (ETM) which activates the molecular oxygen.

[114] The mechanism is analogous to that of the Cu/TEMPO systems (see above). The alcohol would be oxidized by the action of the Fe/TEMPO system and the role of the NaNO2 would be to provide NO2, which would reoxidize the Fe/TEMPO system to give NO. Finally, the NO can be easily oxidized by molecular oxygen.

[115] This system offers some advantages over the previously described methods for the tungstate-catalyzed epoxidation of olefins by H2O2;[9a,116] the first is that in this case the terminal oxidant is molecular oxygen instead of H2O2; the second is that the tungsten catalyst is based on a quaternary ammonium heteropolyoxotungstate and is soluble in the reaction mixture when it is oxidized, but insoluble when reduced. In this way the catalyst can be recovered by simple filtration and reused again;

[117] Recently, an iron-catalyzed biomimetic epoxidation of olefins by hydrogen peroxide was reported by Beller and co-workers.[117]

[122] In this example, Br2 and NaNO2 are used as the co-catalysts and a wide range of primary benzylic alcohols and secondary alcohols were effectively oxidized.

[123] Another system for the oxidation of alcohols involves the use of hypervalent iodine (iodoxybenzene) as the oxidant and bromine and NaNO2 as ETMs.

[126] It could be recycled up to three times in the oxidation of benzylic alcohol to benzaldehyde,with essentially the same high yield as for the free reagent,although longer reaction times were required.

[127] With this system it is possible to oxidize secondary alcohols and benzylic primary alcohols to the carbonyl compounds in high yields. However, the reactions are not totally selective and in some cases different amounts of products derived from the esterification of the alcohols with the solvent were detected.

[128] In nature, flavins occurring in monooxygenases use molecular oxygen as the oxidant. This process requires a cofactor that reduces the hydroxyflavin that is produced after the hydroperoxyflavin has oxidized the substrate, and in nature this cofactor is NADPH. In an elegant study Imada, Murahashi, and co-workers mimicked this process with the development of an aerobic flavin-catalyzed oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides at ambient temperature.[129]

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several aspects including the two-site and one-site schemes, the transformation processes of linear and cyclic alkane, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The two-site scheme refers to the process where the activation of alkane occurs at one site of the catalyst, followed by the metathesis reaction at a different site. The one-site scheme involves the activation and reaction happening at the same site.

Linear alkane transformations involve the rearrangement of carbon-carbon single bonds to create branched chains or rings. Cyclic alkane transformations, on the other hand, lead to the formation of cycloalkanes through the creation of ring structures.

Key intermediates like alkenes play crucial roles in the mechanism. They are formed during the activation step and later react with other alkenes or alkynes to form the desired products. Metallacyclobutanes, which are complexes of the catalyst with four-membered carbon rings, are also important intermediates in the process.

Reaction selectivity is influenced by the stability of the intermediates and the energy barriers associated with different reaction pathways. Catalyst performance depends on factors such as the surface area of the support material, the dispersion of the active metal, and the ability of the catalyst to regenerate itself after each reaction cycle.

In summary, the detailed mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the strategic activation of alkane molecules, the formation and reaction of key intermediates, and the influence of various factors on reaction selectivity and catalyst efficiency.

[1] "The direct oxidation of organic substrates by either O2 or H2O2 is rare as the energy barrier for electron transfer from the organic substrate to the oxidant is usually high."
[2] "For molecular oxygen, which has a triplet ground state, this high-energy barrier is nature’s way of protecting organic compounds from destructive oxidation."
[3] "Nature has also found methods to make controlled aerobic oxidations under highly mild conditions."
[4] "Cytochrome c (a small protein covalently attached to an iron porphyrin, which is the active redox part) accepts electrons from complex III and donates them to complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), which carries the electrons to molecular oxygen."
[5] "Although these direct reoxidations of the metal give efficient oxidations in many cases, this approach fails in other cases because the electron transfer between Mn and O2 or H2O2 is too slow compared to decomposition of the reduced metal."
[6] "To circumvent this problem one can employ ligands that stabilize Pd0 and that are stable under oxidative conditions."
[7] "Another strategy is to mimic biological oxidation systems and squeeze in an electron-transfer mediator (ETM) between the substrate-selective redox catalyst and O2 or H2O2."
[8] "The Wacker oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde is a large-scale industrial process for the oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde by air (O2) which is catalyzed by PdCl2 and CuCl2, with the former being the substrate-selective redox catalyst."
[9] "However, the presence of chloride ions has a negative effect on the rate (there is an inverse square dependence on the chloride ion concentration) which makes the reaction unselective and leads to the formation of chlorinated by-products."
[10] "The reactor also corrodes under the oxidative conditions employed. For this reason a chloride-free Wacker-type process is highly desirable."
[11] "The direct oxidation of palladium(0) by molecular oxygen in acetic acid is slow under these conditions."
[12] "On the other hand, the coupled system in which ETMs are utilized leads to low-energy electron transfer."
[13] "It is also important to point out that there are four oxidants with decreasing oxidation potentials (O2, (MLm)ox, BQ, and PdII) and four components that can be oxidized (MLm, hydroquinone (HQ), Pd0, and diene)."
[14] "Thus, there are ten thermodynamically favored redox reactions that can occur, but only four of these are kinetically favored and will occur."
[15] "The success of these processes is based on a stepwise low-energy electron transfer that has lower redox potentials, in analogy with that occurring in biological systems (cf. the respiratory chain)."
[16] "A control experiment showed that the reaction stops completely if any of the catalysts (Pd, benzoquinone (BQ), MLm) is removed."

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The direct oxidation of organic substrates by molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide is uncommon due to the high energy barrier for electron transfer from the substrate to the oxidant. For molecular oxygen, this barrier protects organic compounds from destructive oxidation. Nature has developed controlled aerobic oxidation methods under mild conditions, utilizing enzymes and electron transfer mediators. In the Wacker oxidation, palladium chloride and copper chloride catalyze the oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde, but chloride ions negatively impact the reaction rate and yield. Efforts to develop a chloride-free process are crucial.

The direct reoxidation of palladium by molecular oxygen is inefficient, leading to slow electron transfer and decomposition of the metal. Ligands that stabilize palladium zero valence and are stable under oxidative conditions can mitigate this issue. By inserting electron-transfer mediators (ETMs) between the substrate-selective redox catalyst and oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, low-energy electron transfer is facilitated, enhancing oxidation efficiency and complementing direct reoxidation methods. This approach mimics biological systems, hence it is termed biomimetic.

The success of these processes relies on stepwise low-energy electron transfer with lower redox potentials, akin to biological systems. Removing any of the catalysts (palladium, benzoquinone, ETM) halts the reaction, highlighting the importance of all components. The direct oxidation of palladium(0) by molecular oxygen is slow, but the coupled system with ETMs enables low-energy electron transfer. The existence of multiple oxidants and components introduces ten thermodynamically favored redox reactions, but only four are kinetically favored.

In summary, the biomimetic approach to alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the energy barriers for electron transfer, leveraging controlled aerobic oxidation methods, and employing ETMs to facilitate low-energy electron transfer. Key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play critical roles in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

分析硅负载钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的全面机制，讨论双位点和单位点方案，线性和环烷烃转换过程中的关键步骤，重要中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其在各种烷烃转化中对反应选择性和催化剂性能的贡献。

直接由分子氧或过氧化氢氧化有机基团是罕见的，因为从基团到氧化剂的电子转移的能量壁垒通常很高。对于分子氧而言，这种壁垒是自然界保护有机化合物免受破坏性氧化的方式。自然已经发展出了在温和条件下进行控制性的好氧氧化的方法，利用酶和电子传递媒介。在瓦克氧化中，钯氯化物和铜氯化物催化乙烷转化为乙醛，但氯离子对反应速率和产率有负面影响。开发无氯化物过程至关重要。

直接将钯氧化为分子氧是不高效的，导致电子转移缓慢并分解金属。稳定钯零价的配体和在氧化条件下稳定的配体可以缓解这一问题。通过在氧化剂和氧气或过氧化氢之间插入电子传递媒介（ETM），可以实现低能量电子转移，从而增强氧化效率并补充直接氧化方法。这种方法模仿生物系统，因此被称为生物仿生学。

这些过程的成功依赖于分步的低能量电子转移，其红氧化势较低，类似于生物系统。如果移除任何催化剂（钯、苯醌、ETM），则反应会完全停止，强调所有组件的重要性。钯(0)直接由分子氧氧化是缓慢的，但在与ETM结合的耦合系统中可以实现低能量电子转移。存在多个氧化剂和成分引入了十个热力学上有利的氧化还原反应，但只有四个是动力学上有利的，并将发生。

简而言之，硅负载钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的生物仿生机制涉及理解电子转移的能量壁垒，利用控制性的好氧氧化方法，并通过ETM实现低能量电子转移来促进烷烃的线性和环状转换。关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷在烷烃转换中扮演着至关重要的角色，对反应选择性和催化剂性能在各种烷烃转化中具有重大影响。

[113] In this catalytic system, molybdenum acts as the oxidant of the alcohol and the copper salt acts as the co-catalyst (ETM) which activates the molecular oxygen.

[114] The authors evaluated different molybdenum complexes, with benzylic alcohol used as the substrate, and showed that the nature of the ligand is decisive for the success of the reaction, with acetylacetonate (acac) being the most effective ligand.

[115] This system offers some advantages over the previously described methods for the tungstate-catalyzed epoxidation of olefins by H2O2; the first is that in this case the terminal oxidant is molecular oxygen instead of H2O2; the second is that the tungsten catalyst is based on a quaternary ammonium heteropolyoxotungstate and is soluble in the reaction mixture when it is oxidized, but insoluble when reduced.

[117] Recently, an iron-catalyzed biomimetic epoxidation of olefins by hydrogen peroxide was reported by Beller and co-workers.

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. The process typically begins with the formation of an alkene through the cleavage of a C-C bond. This alkene then reacts with another alkene or an equivalent alkene to form a new C-C bond, leading to the transformation of linear to cyclic alkane structures or vice versa. Key intermediates in this process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in facilitating the reaction steps. The selectivity of the catalyst is influenced by factors such as the nature of the catalyst, the conditions of the reaction, and the stability of the intermediates. Catalyst performance is optimized through careful control of parameters such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of additives, ensuring high efficiency and selectivity in various alkane conversions.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides offer several advantages, including improved stability and selectivity compared to traditional homogeneous catalysts. The silica support provides a stable environment for the tantalum hydride species, reducing the risk of deactivation due to side reactions or poisoning. Additionally, the use of a solid support enables easier separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture, simplifying downstream processing. The specific properties of the tantalum hydrides, such as their ability to facilitate the breaking and reformation of C-C bonds, are critical for achieving efficient alkane metathesis reactions. Through optimization of the catalyst composition, support material, and reaction conditions, it is possible to achieve high yields and selectivities in the conversion of linear and cyclic alkane structures.

The detailed mechanisms underlying the alkane metathesis reactions catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involve intricate interactions between the catalyst species, alkene intermediates, and the reaction environment. The role of specific intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, is essential in driving the reaction forward. The selectivity of the process is influenced by factors including catalyst stability, reaction conditions, and the chemical properties of the alkane substrates. By carefully tuning these parameters, it is possible to achieve high levels of efficiency and selectivity in alkane metathesis reactions, facilitating the conversion of linear to cyclic alkane structures and vice versa.

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes of linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and roles of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides act as catalysts for alkane metathesis, enabling the rearrangement of alkane structures. In the two-site scheme, the catalyst facilitates the exchange of alkyl groups between two different alkane molecules, leading to the formation of new alkane isomers. In the one-site scheme, a single alkane molecule undergoes internal rearrangement, resulting in a change in the alkane's conformation.

During the transformation of linear alkane to cyclic alkane and vice versa, the formation of alkenes plays a crucial role. The catalyst enables the cleavage of alkane bonds and the subsequent formation of new bonds, creating alkenes as intermediates. Metallacyclobutanes, which are complexes of the metal (tantalum) with a four-carbon ring, are also formed during the process. These intermediates are key to the mechanism, as they facilitate the rearrangement of alkane structures and contribute to the high selectivity of the catalytic process.

The role of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, is pivotal in achieving efficient alkane metathesis. Alkenes, formed during the breaking of alkane bonds, are transient species that enable the exchange of alkyl groups. Metallacyclobutanes, on the other hand, are stable complexes that assist in the rearrangement of alkane structures, leading to the formation of new alkane isomers.

The factors contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance include the precise control of reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and solvent, as well as the specific properties of the catalyst itself. The silica support provides a stable environment for the tantalum hydrides, ensuring their effectiveness in the catalytic process. Additionally, the choice of alkane feedstock and the optimization of reaction parameters can further enhance the efficiency and selectivity of alkane metathesis.

In conclusion, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the strategic formation and utilization of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, to enable efficient rearrangement of alkane structures. The reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by the precise control of reaction conditions and the properties of the catalyst, leading to various alkane conversions with high efficiency and selectivity.

The combination of MnII/CuII nitrates with TEMPO also permits the aerobic oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to give aldehydes and ketones in excellent yields under very mild conditions.
