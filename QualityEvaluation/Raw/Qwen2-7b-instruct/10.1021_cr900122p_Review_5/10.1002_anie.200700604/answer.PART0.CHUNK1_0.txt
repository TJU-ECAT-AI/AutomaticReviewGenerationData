[1] "In one example, the oxidation of activated primary and secondary alcohols to the corresponding alde- hydes and ketones, respectively, was performed with molec- ular oxygen in the presence of a molybdenum/copper system as the catalyst [Eq. (11)].[113]"
[2] "The authors evaluated different molybdenum com- plexes, with benzylic alcohol used as the substrate, and showed that the nature of the ligand is decisive for the success of the reaction, with acetylacetonate (acac) being the most effective ligand."
[3] "In 2005 Liang and co-workers reported an iron/TEMPO/ NaNO2 catalyst system for the selective and mild aerobic oxidation of a wide range of alcohols, even those containing CC double bonds as well as nitrogen and sulfur atoms [Eq. (12)].[114]"
[4] "In a control experiment, a mixture of alcohol (benzyl alcohol or 2-octanol) and methyl phenyl sulfide was treated with the iron/TEMPO/nitrite catalyst: the alcohol was oxidized selectively to the aldehyde while the sulfide remained unchanged."
[5] "This system offers some advan- tages over the previously described methods for the tungstate- catalyzed epoxidation of olefins by H2O2;[9a,116] the first is that in this case the terminal oxidant is molecular oxygen instead of H2O2; the second is that the tungsten catalyst is based on a quaternary ammonium heteropolyoxotungstate and is soluble in the reaction mixture when it is oxidized, but insoluble when reduced."
[6] "Recently, an iron-catalyzed biomimetic epoxidation of olefins by hydrogen peroxide was reported by Beller and co- workers.[117]"
[7] "In most of these oxidations the substrate-selective catalyst is a nitroxyl radical derived from compounds such as N- hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI),[106b,118] N-hydroxysaccharin (NHS),[106b,119] and TEMPOH.[106b,120]"
[8] "Some typical ETMs that are commonly used in combination with the previous catalysts are metal salts, usually Co, Cu, and Mn salts."
[9] "In nature, flavins occurring in monooxygenases use molecular oxygen as the oxidant. This process requires a cofactor that reduces the hydroxyflavin that is produced after the hydroperoxyflavin has oxidized the substrate, and in nature this cofactor is NADPH."
[10] "Imada, Murahashi, and co-workers mimicked this process with the development of an aerobic flavin-catalyzed oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides at ambient temperature.[129]"
[11] "The catalytic cycle of this biomimetic oxidation starts with oxidation of the sulfide by a hydroperoxyflavin (FOOH) species to give the sulfoxide and hydroxyflavin (FOH), of which the latter undergoes dehydration to give an oxidized flavin (F+)."
[12] "At this point, F+ can be transformed to FOOH by hydrogen peroxide or it can be reduced by hydrazine to give the reduced flavin (FH), which can be oxidized by molecular oxygen to the hydroperoxyflavin (FOOH, Scheme 22)."
[13] "The mechanism is similar to that proposed for the TEMPO/ Br2/NaNO2 system developed by Hu and co-workers (Scheme 21)."
[14] "However, in some cases flavins, which have been typically used as ETMs (see Section 4), can be used as the substrate-selective redox catalyst for the mild oxidation of amines and sulfides at room temperature, with hydrogen peroxide used as the sole reoxidant."
[15] "This process requires a cofactor that reduces the hydroxyflavin that is produced after the hydroperoxyflavin has oxidized the substrate, and in nature this cofactor is NADPH."
[16] "In an elegant study Imada, Murahashi, and co-workers mimicked this process with the development of an aerobic flavin-catalyzed oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides at ambient temperature.[129]"
[17] "Hydrazine is used as a stoichiomet- ric ETM (reductant), and constitutes a mimic of the NADPH cofactor."

1. The oxidation of activated primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively, was carried out using molecular oxygen in the presence of a molybdenum/copper system as the catalyst. Different molybdenum complexes were evaluated, with acetylacetonate (acac) being the most effective ligand for the reaction. 
2. In 2005, Liang and colleagues reported an iron/TEMPO/NaNO2 catalyst system for the selective and mild aerobic oxidation of a wide range of alcohols, even those containing CC double bonds as well as nitrogen and sulfur atoms. The alcohol was selectively oxidized to an aldehyde, while the sulfide remained unchanged in a control experiment.
3. This system provides advantages over previous methods for the tungstate-catalyzed epoxidation of olefins by hydrogen peroxide, such as using molecular oxygen instead of hydrogen peroxide as the terminal oxidant and the tungsten catalyst being soluble in the reaction mixture when oxidized but insoluble when reduced.
4. Recently, Beller and colleagues reported an iron-catalyzed biomimetic epoxidation of olefins by hydrogen peroxide.
5. In most oxidations, the substrate-selective catalyst is a nitroxyl radical derived from compounds like N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI), N-hydroxysaccharin (NHS), and TEMPOH, often combined with metal salts such as cobalt, copper, and manganese salts.
6. Flavins, typically used as electron transfer mediators, can be utilized as the substrate-selective redox catalyst for the mild oxidation of amines and sulfides at room temperature, with hydrogen peroxide serving as the sole reoxidant.
7. The mechanism of this biomimetic oxidation involves the oxidation of the sulfide by a hydroperoxyflavin species, leading to the formation of a sulfoxide and hydroxyflavin, which subsequently undergoes dehydration to produce an oxidized flavin. At this point, the oxidized flavin can either be transformed to hydroperoxyflavin through hydrogen peroxide or reduced by hydrazine to a reduced flavin, which can be oxidized by molecular oxygen to regenerate the hydroperoxyflavin.

1. 在一个例子中，激活的一级和二级醇被分子氧在钼/铜系统催化剂的作用下氧化成相应的醛和酮。研究人员评估了不同的钼配合物，以苄基醇作为底物，表明配体的性质对反应的成功至关重要，其中乙酰乙酸酯（acac）是最有效的配体。
2. 2005年，梁等人报道了一种铁/TEMPO/NaNO2催化剂系统，用于选择性地温和氧化一系列醇，即使底物中含有CC双键以及氮和硫原子也是如此。在控制实验中，将混合的醇（苯甲醇或2-辛醇）与甲基苯基硫代物一起处理，醇被选择性氧化为醛，而硫代物保持不变。
3. 这个系统比之前描述的方法进行钨催化过氧化物氧化烯烃时的优势在于：首先，末端氧化剂是分子氧而不是过氧化氢；其次，钨催化剂基于四烷基铵杂多氧钨酸盐，在氧化时可溶于反应介质中，但在还原时不可溶。
4. 最近，贝尔勒及其同事报告了一种铁催化的生物模拟氧化反应，使用过氧化氢氧化烯烃。
5. 大多数氧化反应中，选择性催化剂是一种源自N-羟基邻苯二甲酰亚胺（NHPI）、N-羟基糖苷（NHS）和TEMPOH等化合物的硝基肟自由基，通常与钴、铜和锰盐等金属盐结合使用。
6. 在自然中，存在于单加氧酶中的黄素（flavins）利用分子氧作为氧化剂。这一过程需要一个辅因子来减少在羟基黄素生成后氧化底物的羟基黄素，而在自然中这个辅因子是NADPH。
7. 伊马达、村上等人模仿这一过程，开发了一种在室温下通过黄素催化氧化硫化物到硫醚的生化氧化法。在催化循环中，硫化物由羟基过氧黄素（FOOH）物种氧化生成硫醚和羟基黄素（FOH），后者脱水生成氧化黄素（F+）。在此之后，F+可以通过过氧化氢转化为羟基过氧黄素（FOOH），或者通过使用肼进行还原形成还原黄素（FH），然后由分子氧氧化回羟基过氧黄素（FOOH，见方案22）。
