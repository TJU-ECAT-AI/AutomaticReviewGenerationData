[1] "The development of new processes that employ transition metals as substrate-selective catalysts and stoichiometric environmentally friendly oxidants, such as molec- ular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, is one of the most important goals in oxidation chemistry."
[2] "There are various examples where the metal is directly reoxidized by O2 or H2O2."
[3] "The unfavorable kinetics associated with direct aerobic oxidations is circumvented in the respiratory chain, which is involved in many biological oxidations."
[4] "For a catalytic oxidation reaction, the substrate-selective catalyst, which may often be a transition metal (Mn+2/Mn),oxidizes the substrate to the desired product."
[5] "The selection of quinone as the oxidant for the palladium is based on the fact that quinones are well-known oxidants and electron carriers in palladium-catalyzed oxidations."
[6] "Under the reaction conditions for the transforma- tions described in Schemes 5 and 6, it is not possible to directly reoxidize the hydroquinone formed with molecular oxygen, and therefore an additional ETM is required."
[7] "The high kinetic control is due to the fact that there is a coordination between those redox couples that interact; for example, O2 coordinates to MLm,[29] HQ binds to the metal macrocycle,[30] Pd0 is known to coordinate to BQ,[31] and finally PdII forms a complex with the diene."
[8] "It is important to point out that there are four oxidants with decreasing oxidation potentials[28] (O2, (MLm)ox, BQ, and PdII) and four components that can be oxidized (MLm, hydroquinone (HQ), Pd0, and diene)."
[9] "The direct oxidation of palladium(0) by molecular oxygen in acetic acid is slow under these conditions.[27]"
[10] "The use of coupled catalytic systems with ETMs (such as that in Scheme 3) is an important complement to the simple systems based on direct reoxidation of the metal by O2 or H2O2, and significantly extends the use of oxygen and H2O2 as the final oxidants in metal-catalyzed reactions."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The two-site scheme refers to the simultaneous rearrangement of two alkane molecules, while the one-site scheme involves the rearrangement of a single alkane molecule. The process typically begins with the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which then undergoes rearrangement to form a new alkene. Key intermediates in the reaction include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These factors contribute to the reaction selectivity by controlling the direction of the rearrangement and the stability of the intermediates. The catalyst performance is influenced by the support material, which in this case is silica, and the nature of the tantalum hydride, which provides the active site for the alkane metathesis. The selectivity and efficiency of the reaction are enhanced by the proper choice of conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of solvents, which facilitate the formation and stabilization of the intermediates.

烷烃交叉偶联催化由硅基支撑钽氢化物介导的综合机制涉及双位点和单位点方案。双位点方案指的是两个烷烃分子同时重排，而单位点方案涉及单个烷烃分子的重排。该过程通常从形成一个金属环丁烷中间体开始，然后进一步重排形成一个新的烯烃。反应的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。这些因素通过控制重排的方向和中间体的稳定性来促进反应选择性。催化剂性能受支持材料的影响，在这种情况下是硅，以及钽氢化物的性质，这为烷烃交叉偶联提供了活性位点。通过正确选择条件，如温度、压力和溶剂的存在，可以增强反应的选择性和效率，从而促进中间体的形成和稳定。
