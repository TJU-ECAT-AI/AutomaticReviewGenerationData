[1] "In 2005 Liang and co-workers reported an iron/TEMPO/NaNO2 catalyst system for the selective and mild aerobic oxidation of a wide range of alcohols, even those containing CC double bonds as well as nitrogen and sulfur atoms [Eq. (12)]."
[2] "The authors evaluated different molybdenum complexes, with benzylic alcohol used as the substrate, and showed that the nature of the ligand is decisive for the success of the reaction, with acetylacetonate (acac) being the most effective ligand."
[3] "The mechanism is analogous to that of the Cu/TEMPO systems (see above). The alcohol would be oxidized by the action of the Fe/TEMPO system and the role of the NaNO2 would be to provide NO2, which would reoxidize the Fe/TEMPO system to give NO. Finally, the NO can be easily oxidized by molecular oxygen."
[4] "This system offers some advantages over the previously described methods for the tungstate-catalyzed epoxidation of olefins by H2O2;[9a,116] the first is that in this case the terminal oxidant is molecular oxygen instead of H2O2; the second is that the tungsten catalyst is based on a quaternary ammonium heteropolyoxotungstate and is soluble in the reaction mixture when it is oxidized, but insoluble when reduced. In this way the catalyst can be recovered by simple filtration and reused again; therefore it has the advantages of both a homogeneous and a heterogeneous catalyst."
[5] "In this catalytic system, molybdenum acts as the oxidant of the alcohol and the copper salt acts as the co-catalyst (ETM) which activates the molecular oxygen."
[6] "They also studied different transition metals known to activate O2 such as CoII, FeII, and MnII, but copper gave the most efficient reaction."
[7] "In the latter case, palladium black is not precipitated."
[8] "Attempts to obtain a catalytic O2 oxidation by stabilization of Pd0 by maleic anhydride did not lead to a catalytic oxidation with O2."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes, as well as the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in the mechanism. The formation and role of these intermediates contribute significantly to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit distinct mechanisms for alkane metathesis, depending on whether the process is classified as a two-site or one-site scheme. In the two-site mechanism, a single catalyst molecule facilitates the formation of an intermediate, followed by a second step where the intermediate rearranges to form the final product. In contrast, the one-site mechanism involves a single step where the catalyst molecule directly transforms an alkane into its metathesis product without the formation of an intermediate.

During the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes, the formation of alkenes is a critical intermediate. These alkenes participate in subsequent reactions to generate the desired alkene products. Metallacyclobutanes also emerge as key intermediates during the metathesis process, particularly when dealing with cyclic alkane conversions. These metallacyclobutanes undergo rearrangement reactions to yield the final alkene products.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by several factors. The nature of the catalyst, including the type of support material (silica in this case) and the specific properties of the metal (tantalum hydrides), play significant roles. Additionally, the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions, as well as the ability to regenerate the catalyst for reuse, contribute to its overall effectiveness.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit advantages over other catalysts in alkane metathesis, particularly in terms of terminal oxidants and catalyst solubility. In comparison to tungstate-catalyzed epoxidation, the silica-supported tantalum hydrides utilize molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant, providing a more environmentally friendly option. Furthermore, the tungsten catalyst based on a quaternary ammonium heteropolyoxotungstate allows for facile catalyst recovery through simple filtration, offering benefits akin to both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts.

The molybdenum complex in the alcohol oxidation system acts as the oxidant, while the copper salt serves as the co-catalyst (electron transfer mediator) that activates molecular oxygen. Different ligands, such as acetylacetonate, influence the success of the reaction. The mechanism of this system is similar to that of the copper/TEMPO system, where the alcohol is oxidized by the action of the iron/TEMPO system, and sodium nitrite provides NO2, which reoxidizes the iron/TEMPO system to generate NO. The NO is easily oxidized by molecular oxygen.

In the case of palladium, stabilization by maleic anhydride does not lead to a catalytic oxidation with molecular oxygen. This suggests that the stabilization method is not effective in promoting the desired reaction. The absence of palladium black precipitation indicates that the palladium remains in a stable state, preventing the formation of a catalytically active species.

Alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides showcases a robust mechanism involving the formation and manipulation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as intermediates. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by various factors, including the nature of the catalyst, the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions, and the regeneration capabilities of the catalyst. These catalysts offer significant advantages in alkane metathesis, particularly in terms of terminal oxidants and catalyst solubility, contributing to their effectiveness in various alkane conversions.

分析由硅基支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂解机制涉及理解两种位点和单一位点方案，以及线性与环烷烃转换过程中所涉及的过程。关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，在机制中扮演着重要角色。这些中间体的形成和作用对催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能有着显著影响。

硅基支持的钽氢化物在烷烃裂解过程中表现出不同的机制，这取决于是否将过程分类为两种位点或单一位点方案。在两种位点机制中，单个催化剂分子促进中间体的形成，随后是第二步，中间体重组形成最终产物。相比之下，单一位点机制涉及一步反应，其中催化剂分子直接将烷烃转化为目标烯烃产品，而无需形成中间体。

在处理线性和环烷烃转换时，烯烃的形成是关键中间体。这些烯烃参与后续反应以生成所需的烯烃产品。金属环丁烷也作为关键中间体在裂解过程中出现，特别是在处理环烷烃转换时。这些金属环丁烷经历重排反应以产生最终的烯烃产品。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能受多种因素的影响。催化剂的性质，包括支持材料（在这种情况下为硅）和金属的具体属性（钽氢化物），在这一过程中发挥重要作用。此外，催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性，以及催化剂的再生能力，对于其整体有效性至关重要。

硅基支持的钽氢化物在烷烃裂解中展现出优势，特别是与终端氧化剂和催化剂溶解性有关。与钨基催化环氧烷化相比，硅基支持的钽氢化物利用分子氧作为终端氧化剂，提供更环保的选择。此外，基于四元铵杂多钨酸盐的钨催化剂允许通过简单的过滤轻松回收催化剂，提供类似于均相和非均相催化剂的优点。

钼复合物在醇氧化系统中充当氧化剂，而铜盐作为协同催化剂（电子转移媒介），激活分子氧。不同配体，例如乙酰乙酸酯，影响反应的成功。这种系统的机制类似于铜/TEMPO系统，其中醇被铁/TEMPO系统氧化，而钠硝酸盐提供NO2，重新氧化铁/TEMPO系统产生NO。NO很容易被分子氧氧化。

在钯的情况下，通过马来酸酐稳定并未导致分子氧催化氧化。这表明这种方法在促进所需反应方面是无效的。没有形成钯黑沉淀表明钯保持稳定状态，防止形成催化活性物种。

硅基支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂解展示了强大的机制，涉及到烯烃和金属环丁烷作为中间体的形成和操作。催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能受多种因素的影响，包括催化剂的性质、催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性以及催化剂的再生能力。这些催化剂在烷烃裂解中展现出显著优势，特别是在终端氧化剂和催化剂溶解性方面，有助于它们在各种烷烃转化中的有效作用。
