[113] "In this catalytic system, molybdenum acts as the oxidant of the alcohol and the copper salt acts as the co-catalyst (ETM) which activates the molecular oxygen."

[114] "In 2005 Liang and co-workers reported an iron/TEMPO/ NaNO2 catalyst system for the selective and mild aerobic oxidation of a wide range of alcohols, even those containing CC double bonds as well as nitrogen and sulfur atoms."

[115] "This system offers some advantages over the previously described methods for the tungstate-catalyzed epoxidation of olefins by H2O2;[9a,116] the first is that in this case the terminal oxidant is molecular oxygen instead of H2O2; the second is that the tungsten catalyst is based on a quaternary ammonium heteropolyoxotungstate and is soluble in the reaction mixture when it is oxidized, but insoluble when reduced."

[117] "Recently, an iron-catalyzed biomimetic epoxidation of olefins by hydrogen peroxide was reported by Beller and co-workers."

An analysis of the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides is beyond the scope of this document. The provided quotes discuss redox systems for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols, epoxidation processes, and the use of metal catalysts in oxidation reactions. For a detailed explanation of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, additional literature would be required.
