[113] In this catalytic system, molybdenum acts as the oxidant of the alcohol and the copper salt acts as the co-catalyst (ETM) which activates the molecular oxygen.

[114] The mechanism is analogous to that of the Cu/TEMPO systems (see above). The alcohol would be oxidized by the action of the Fe/TEMPO system and the role of the NaNO2 would be to provide NO2, which would reoxidize the Fe/TEMPO system to give NO. Finally, the NO can be easily oxidized by molecular oxygen.

[115] This system offers some advantages over the previously described methods for the tungstate-catalyzed epoxidation of olefins by H2O2;[9a,116] the first is that in this case the terminal oxidant is molecular oxygen instead of H2O2; the second is that the tungsten catalyst is based on a quaternary ammonium heteropolyoxotungstate and is soluble in the reaction mixture when it is oxidized, but insoluble when reduced. In this way the catalyst can be recovered by simple filtration and reused again;

[117] Recently, an iron-catalyzed biomimetic epoxidation of olefins by hydrogen peroxide was reported by Beller and co-workers.[117]

[122] In this example, Br2 and NaNO2 are used as the co-catalysts and a wide range of primary benzylic alcohols and secondary alcohols were effectively oxidized.

[123] Another system for the oxidation of alcohols involves the use of hypervalent iodine (iodoxybenzene) as the oxidant and bromine and NaNO2 as ETMs.

[126] It could be recycled up to three times in the oxidation of benzylic alcohol to benzaldehyde,with essentially the same high yield as for the free reagent,although longer reaction times were required.

[127] With this system it is possible to oxidize secondary alcohols and benzylic primary alcohols to the carbonyl compounds in high yields. However, the reactions are not totally selective and in some cases different amounts of products derived from the esterification of the alcohols with the solvent were detected.

[128] In nature, flavins occurring in monooxygenases use molecular oxygen as the oxidant. This process requires a cofactor that reduces the hydroxyflavin that is produced after the hydroperoxyflavin has oxidized the substrate, and in nature this cofactor is NADPH. In an elegant study Imada, Murahashi, and co-workers mimicked this process with the development of an aerobic flavin-catalyzed oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides at ambient temperature.[129]

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several aspects including the two-site and one-site schemes, the transformation processes of linear and cyclic alkane, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The two-site scheme refers to the process where the activation of alkane occurs at one site of the catalyst, followed by the metathesis reaction at a different site. The one-site scheme involves the activation and reaction happening at the same site.

Linear alkane transformations involve the rearrangement of carbon-carbon single bonds to create branched chains or rings. Cyclic alkane transformations, on the other hand, lead to the formation of cycloalkanes through the creation of ring structures.

Key intermediates like alkenes play crucial roles in the mechanism. They are formed during the activation step and later react with other alkenes or alkynes to form the desired products. Metallacyclobutanes, which are complexes of the catalyst with four-membered carbon rings, are also important intermediates in the process.

Reaction selectivity is influenced by the stability of the intermediates and the energy barriers associated with different reaction pathways. Catalyst performance depends on factors such as the surface area of the support material, the dispersion of the active metal, and the ability of the catalyst to regenerate itself after each reaction cycle.

In summary, the detailed mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the strategic activation of alkane molecules, the formation and reaction of key intermediates, and the influence of various factors on reaction selectivity and catalyst efficiency.
