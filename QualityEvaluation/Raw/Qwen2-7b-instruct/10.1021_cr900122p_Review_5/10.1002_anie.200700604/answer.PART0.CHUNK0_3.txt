[1] "The use of coupled catalytic systems with electron-transfer mediators (ETMs) usually facilitates the procedures by transporting the electrons from the catalyst to the oxidant along a low-energy pathway, thereby increasing the efficiency of the oxidation and thus complementing the direct oxidation reactions."
[2] "Direct oxidation of the catalyst by molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide is often kinetically unfavored."
[3] "Nature has also found methods to make controlled aerobic oxidations under highly mild conditions."
[4] "For a catalytic oxidation reaction, the substrate-selective catalyst, which may often be a transition metal (Mn+2/Mn),oxidizes the substrate to the desired product."
[5] "The electron transfer between Mn and O2 or H2O2 is too slow compared to decomposition of the reduced metal."
[6] "The Wacker oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde is a large-scale industrial process for the oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde by air (O2) which is catalyzed by PdCl2 and CuCl2."
[7] "Under the reaction conditions for the transforma- tions described in Schemes 5 and 6, it is not possible to directly reoxidize the hydroquinone formed with molecular oxygen, and therefore an additional ETM is required."
[8] "The direct oxidation of palladium(0) by molecular oxygen in acetic acid is slow under these conditions."
[9] "The high kinetic control is due to the fact that there is a coordination between those redox couples that interact."
[10] "The selection of quinone as the oxidant for the palladium is based on the fact that quinones are well-known oxidants and electron carriers in palladium-catalyzed oxidations."
[11] "The direct aerobic oxidative arylation of acrylates and other electron-deficient olefins under mild conditions was achieved with this compound [Eq. (3)]."
[12] "The active species in catalyst 3 is the 16-electron complex 5 which can also be generated from the dimeric structure 8,[72]"
[13] "The reaction of primary alcohols furnishes aldehydes by means of the Ru/Ce system which are subsequently oxidized to carboxylic acids by Co."
[14] "This system leads to low-energy electron transfer and the use of very mild reaction conditions for the reoxidization of OsVI back to OsVIII by NMO."
[15] "The principle of this oxidation system is shown in Scheme 16."
[16] "The LDH-PdOsW can be recovered by filtration and reused up to five times with maintained activity."
[17] "The use of CuCl, 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), di-tert-butylhydrazine-1,2-dicarboxylate (DBADH2),and K2CO3 (2 equiv) as a base in toluene at 70908C and under O2 led to the products in good to excellent yields [Eq. (6)]."
[18] "This system shows high chemoselectivity for primary alcohols: when a mixture of benzylic alcohol and a-methyl benzyl alcohol was used, only conversion of the former was observed."
[19] "The system was successfully applied to the oxidation of benzylic alcohols."
[20] "The use of a ruthenium/cobalt catalyst with oxygen as the terminal oxidant for the oxidation of alcohols in the presence of an aldehyde was reported by Murahashi et al."
[21] "In this case, Pd(OAc)2 in acetic acid serves as the substrate-selective redox catalyst for a conjugated diene, transforming it to a 1,4- diacetoxy-2-alkene."
[22] "The reactivity of the multicatalyst system was dependent on the ring size of the alkenes: Cyclopentene and cyclohexene were transformed into the corresponding allylic acetates in almost quantitative yields, while higher temperatures and longer reaction times were required for larger rings to obtain the products in good yield."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. The process typically begins with the formation of an alkene through the cleavage of a C-C bond. This alkene then reacts with another alkene or an equivalent alkene to form a new C-C bond, leading to the transformation of linear to cyclic alkane structures or vice versa. Key intermediates in this process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in facilitating the reaction steps. The selectivity of the catalyst is influenced by factors such as the nature of the catalyst, the conditions of the reaction, and the stability of the intermediates. Catalyst performance is optimized through careful control of parameters such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of additives, ensuring high efficiency and selectivity in various alkane conversions.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides offer several advantages, including improved stability and selectivity compared to traditional homogeneous catalysts. The silica support provides a stable environment for the tantalum hydride species, reducing the risk of deactivation due to side reactions or poisoning. Additionally, the use of a solid support enables easier separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture, simplifying downstream processing. The specific properties of the tantalum hydrides, such as their ability to facilitate the breaking and reformation of C-C bonds, are critical for achieving efficient alkane metathesis reactions. Through optimization of the catalyst composition, support material, and reaction conditions, it is possible to achieve high yields and selectivities in the conversion of linear and cyclic alkane structures.

The detailed mechanisms underlying the alkane metathesis reactions catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involve intricate interactions between the catalyst species, alkene intermediates, and the reaction environment. The role of specific intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, is essential in driving the reaction forward. The selectivity of the process is influenced by factors including catalyst stability, reaction conditions, and the chemical properties of the alkane substrates. By carefully tuning these parameters, it is possible to achieve high levels of efficiency and selectivity in alkane metathesis reactions, facilitating the conversion of linear to cyclic alkane structures and vice versa.
