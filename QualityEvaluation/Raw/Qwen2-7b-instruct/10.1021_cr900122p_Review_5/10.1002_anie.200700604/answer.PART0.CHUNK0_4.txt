Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes of linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and roles of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides act as catalysts for alkane metathesis, enabling the rearrangement of alkane structures. In the two-site scheme, the catalyst facilitates the exchange of alkyl groups between two different alkane molecules, leading to the formation of new alkane isomers. In the one-site scheme, a single alkane molecule undergoes internal rearrangement, resulting in a change in the alkane's conformation.

During the transformation of linear alkane to cyclic alkane and vice versa, the formation of alkenes plays a crucial role. The catalyst enables the cleavage of alkane bonds and the subsequent formation of new bonds, creating alkenes as intermediates. Metallacyclobutanes, which are complexes of the metal (tantalum) with a four-carbon ring, are also formed during the process. These intermediates are key to the mechanism, as they facilitate the rearrangement of alkane structures and contribute to the high selectivity of the catalytic process.

The role of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, is pivotal in achieving efficient alkane metathesis. Alkenes, formed during the breaking of alkane bonds, are transient species that enable the exchange of alkyl groups. Metallacyclobutanes, on the other hand, are stable complexes that assist in the rearrangement of alkane structures, leading to the formation of new alkane isomers.

The factors contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance include the precise control of reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and solvent, as well as the specific properties of the catalyst itself. The silica support provides a stable environment for the tantalum hydrides, ensuring their effectiveness in the catalytic process. Additionally, the choice of alkane feedstock and the optimization of reaction parameters can further enhance the efficiency and selectivity of alkane metathesis.

In conclusion, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the strategic formation and utilization of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, to enable efficient rearrangement of alkane structures. The reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by the precise control of reaction conditions and the properties of the catalyst, leading to various alkane conversions with high efficiency and selectivity.
