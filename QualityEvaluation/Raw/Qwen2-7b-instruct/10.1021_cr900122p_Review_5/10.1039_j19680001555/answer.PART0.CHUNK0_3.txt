[1] "The exchange between hydrogen and deuterium takes place readily at low temperatures and consequently there is no difficulty about 'activating' the hydrogen molecules for this particular exchange."
[2] "With metals the side-group hydrogen atoms tend to exchange as fast as, if not faster than, ring atoms and there is usually some evidence of multiple exchange."
[3] "The surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst exchange with deuterium much more slowly than the rate of the hydrogen-deuterium reaction."
[4] "When CD,is used as the source of deuterium atoms only a fraction of the surface hydroxyl groups exchange rapidly at 135" which is a much higher temperature than that required for the exchange of methane with deuterium or for the equilibration of CH, and CD,."
[5] "The exchange of a hydrocarbon may only take place readily with deuterium atoms which are present in the form of OD groups at special sites and the rate-determining step might be the conversion of OH into OD at these sites."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves considering both two-site and one-site schemes, as well as the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The document highlights that under low temperatures, the exchange between hydrogen and deuterium occurs readily, indicating that hydrogen molecules can easily be activated for this specific exchange. In contrast, with metal catalysts, side-group hydrogen atoms often exchange at a comparable or even faster rate than ring atoms, suggesting multiple exchange mechanisms. Surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst exchange more slowly with deuterium compared to hydrogen, necessitating higher temperatures for effective exchange. Using CD as a source of deuterium atoms results in only a fraction of the surface hydroxyl groups exchanging rapidly at a temperature significantly higher than that required for methane or the equilibration of CH and CD, highlighting the complexity of these reactions. Furthermore, the document proposes that the exchange of a hydrocarbon might only occur readily with deuterium atoms present in the form of OD groups at special sites, implying that the rate-determining step could involve the conversion of OH into OD at these sites.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃互变异构机制涉及考虑双位点和单位点方案，以及线性和环状烷烃转化过程。关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，对反应选择性和催化剂性能起着关键作用。文献指出，在较低温度下，氢和氘之间的交换可以轻易进行，表明氢分子可以容易地激活进行这种特定的交换。相比之下，使用金属催化剂时，侧链氢原子往往与环原子交换速度相似或更快，暗示存在多重交换机制。催化剂表面的羟基与氘的交换速度较慢，需要更高的温度才能有效进行交换。使用CD作为氘源原子导致表面羟基中仅一小部分在远高于甲烷或CH和CD平衡所需的温度下迅速交换，这突出了这些反应的复杂性。此外，文献提出，氢碳化合物可能只在特定位置以OD组形式存在的氘原子中易于交换，这意味着速率决定步骤可能涉及这些位置的OH转化为OD。
