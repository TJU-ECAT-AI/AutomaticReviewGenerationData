[1] "The exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium have been studied on two silica-alumina catalysts containing 13% (I) or 45% (II) alumina and on pure alumina."
[2] "On any catalyst, the hydrogen atoms in the ring positions of all three hydrocarbons reacted at the same rate and there were no appreciable directing effects due to the side-groups."
[3] "Rates of reaction were substantially lower on silica-alumina I than on the other catalysts."
[4] "Subsidiary experiments on hydrogen-deuterium exchange and on the isomerization of m-xylene were also carried out."
[5] "Silica-alumina I was the least active for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerized m-xylene at rates comparable with those found for side-group exchange."

The study analyzed the exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium on various catalysts, focusing on silica-alumina and alumina materials. It was found that the ring hydrogen atoms in these hydrocarbons reacted at the same rate on all catalysts, without any significant directing effects from side groups. The reactions were significantly slower on silica-alumina I compared to other catalysts. Additional experiments included hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerization of m-xylene. Notably, silica-alumina I exhibited lower activity in hydrogen-deuterium exchange and had comparable rates for isomerizing m-xylene to side-group exchanges.

研究了苯、甲苯和间二甲苯与重水的交换反应在两种含13%（I）或45%（II）氧化铝的硅酸铝催化剂以及纯氧化铝上的反应。发现这些烃类中的环上氢原子在所有催化剂上以相同速率反应，侧链没有明显的方向效应。在硅酸铝I上的反应速率显著低于其他催化剂。还进行了氢-重水交换和间二甲苯异构化等额外实验。值得注意的是，硅酸铝I在氢-重水交换中活性较低，并且其异构化间二甲苯的速度与侧链交换相当。
