[3] "Rates of reaction were substantially lower on silica-alumina I than on the other catalysts."
[4] "Subsidiary experiments on hydrogen-deuterium exchange and on the isomerization of m-xylene were also carried out."

The study analyzed the exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium on various catalysts, focusing on silica-alumina and alumina materials. It was found that the ring hydrogen atoms in these hydrocarbons reacted at the same rate on all catalysts, without any significant directing effects from side groups. The reactions were significantly slower on silica-alumina I compared to other catalysts. Additional experiments included hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerization of m-xylene. Notably, silica-alumina I exhibited lower activity in hydrogen-deuterium exchange and had comparable rates for isomerizing m-xylene to side-group exchanges.

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and m-xylene with deuterium were studied on silica-alumina catalysts containing 13% or 45% alumina and on pure alumina. The hydrogen atoms in the ring positions of all three hydrocarbons reacted at the same rate across all catalysts, indicating no significant directing effects due to the side-groups. Rates of reaction were significantly lower on silica-alumina I than on the other catalysts. Side-group exchange was notably slower than ring exchange, with factors ranging from 30 times slower. Subsequent experiments on hydrogen-deuterium exchange and the isomerization of m-xylene were conducted. Silica-alumina I was found to be the least active for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerized m-xylene at rates equivalent to those observed for side-group exchange. The exchange between hydrogen and deuterium occurs readily at low temperatures, facilitating the activation of hydrogen molecules for this specific exchange. The rate of exchange of CD2 with hydrogen is comparable to the common rate for the exchange of ring hydrogen atoms in the three aromatic molecules. Surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst exchange with deuterium much more slowly than the hydrogen-deuterium reaction, requiring temperatures of 50-100°C or even higher for replacement. When CD2 serves as the source of deuterium atoms, only a fraction of the surface hydroxyl groups exchange rapidly at 135°C, significantly higher than the temperatures needed for methane exchange or equilibration of CH4 and CD2.

催化硅基钽氢化物对烷烃裂合机制的全面分析涉及理解两种位点和单一位点方案，线性与环状烷烃转换过程中涉及的过程，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其在各种烷烃转化中的作用，以及这些因素如何促进反应选择性和催化剂性能。

苯、甲苯和间二甲苯与氘的交换反应在含13%或45%氧化铝的硅基氧化铝催化剂和纯氧化铝上进行了研究。所有三个碳氢化合物的环位置氢原子在所有催化剂中以相同速率反应，表明不存在由于侧基导致的显著定向效应。在二氧化硅-氧化铝I上的反应速率明显低于其他催化剂。侧基交换比环交换慢得多，比率范围从30倍以上。随后进行了氢氘交换和间二甲苯异构化的实验。二氧化硅-氧化铝I作为氢氘交换最不活跃的催化剂，其对间二甲苯的异构化速率与侧基交换相当。氢和氘之间的交换在低温下易于发生，有助于激活氢分子进行这种特定的交换。CD2与氢的交换率接近三种芳香分子环氢原子交换的常见速率。催化剂表面羟基与氘的交换远比氢氘反应缓慢，在50-100°C甚至更高的温度下才可完成替换。当CD2作为氘源时，仅有一部分表面羟基在135°C快速交换，该温度远高于甲烷交换或CH4和CD2平衡所需的温度。

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves considering both two-site and one-site schemes, as well as the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The document highlights that under low temperatures, the exchange between hydrogen and deuterium occurs readily, indicating that hydrogen molecules can easily be activated for this specific exchange. In contrast, with metal catalysts, side-group hydrogen atoms often exchange at a comparable or even faster rate than ring atoms, suggesting multiple exchange mechanisms. Surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst exchange more slowly with deuterium compared to hydrogen, necessitating higher temperatures for effective exchange. Using CD as a source of deuterium atoms results in only a fraction of the surface hydroxyl groups exchanging rapidly at a temperature significantly higher than that required for methane or the equilibration of CH and CD, highlighting the complexity of these reactions. Furthermore, the document proposes that the exchange of a hydrocarbon might only occur readily with deuterium atoms present in the form of OD groups at special sites, implying that the rate-determining step could involve the conversion of OH into OD at these sites.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃互变异构机制涉及考虑双位点和单位点方案，以及线性和环状烷烃转化过程。关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，对反应选择性和催化剂性能起着关键作用。文献指出，在较低温度下，氢和氘之间的交换可以轻易进行，表明氢分子可以容易地激活进行这种特定的交换。相比之下，使用金属催化剂时，侧链氢原子往往与环原子交换速度相似或更快，暗示存在多重交换机制。催化剂表面的羟基与氘的交换速度较慢，需要更高的温度才能有效进行交换。使用CD作为氘源原子导致表面羟基中仅一小部分在远高于甲烷或CH和CD平衡所需的温度下迅速交换，这突出了这些反应的复杂性。此外，文献提出，氢碳化合物可能只在特定位置以OD组形式存在的氘原子中易于交换，这意味着速率决定步骤可能涉及这些位置的OH转化为OD。

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes of linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis typically involves the following steps:
1. Activation of the alkane: The alkane is activated by the catalyst, which can involve the formation of a metallacycle or the creation of a reactive intermediate.
2. Insertion of an alkene: An alkene inserts into the catalyst-bound alkane, leading to the formation of a new alkane and a new alkene.
3. Rearrangement: The newly formed alkene rearranges to yield the desired product alkane, while the catalyst regenerates or remains stable.
4. Isomerization: In some cases, isomerization of cyclic alkanes may occur, leading to the formation of a mixture of isomers.

Key intermediates in this process include:
- Alkenes: These are often transient species that facilitate the insertion step in the metathesis reaction.
- Metallacyclobutanes: These are cyclic compounds that can form when a metal center is inserted into a cycloalkane, leading to the formation of a new alkane and alkene pair.

Selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by several factors:
- Catalyst stability: The ability of the catalyst to remain stable over multiple reaction cycles.
- Activation energy: The energy barrier for the initial activation of the alkane.
- Kinetic parameters: The rates of the various steps in the mechanism, which can affect the overall efficiency of the reaction.
- Product isolation: The ability to selectively isolate the desired product(s) from the reaction mixture.

Silica-supported tantalum hydrides offer unique properties for alkane metathesis due to their specific surface chemistry and interaction with alkane substrates. The performance of these catalysts can be optimized by tuning factors such as:
- Catalyst loading: The amount of catalyst present relative to the substrate concentration.
- Reaction conditions: Temperature, pressure, and solvent choice can significantly impact the outcome of the reaction.
- Product separation: Efficient methods for isolating the products can enhance the overall yield and purity.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a series of activation, insertion, rearrangement, and isomerization steps, with key intermediates playing critical roles in the transformation of alkane substrates. Catalyst performance and selectivity are influenced by factors such as stability, kinetic parameters, and the ability to efficiently isolate the desired products.
