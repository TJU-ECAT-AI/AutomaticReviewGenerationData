[1] "Hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes has been widely studied on metal particles, and has given rise to numerous mechanistic debates over the past thirty years."
[2] "On the other hand, it is possible to generate isolated metal centres directly attached to the support by covalent metaloxygen bonds. This is achieved by surface organometallic chemistry."
[3] "This new surface complex can readily be considered as an isolated atom of tantalum in an oxidation state of III stabilized by two siloxy (surface) and the hydride (external) ligands."
[4] "The turnover number is correlated with the number of carbon atoms of the cyclic alkanes, and therefore while cycloheptane is readily transformed, cyclopentane does not give any product (<1%)."
[5] "The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carboncarbon bond-cleavage step."
[6] "In the latter reaction, it has clearly been shown that the key step for carboncarbon bond cleavage was different from a β-alkyl transfer, in contrast to supported Group 4 metal hydrides."
[7] "The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis was further studied: under the reaction conditions cyclopentane reacts with 1 to give the corresponding cyclopentyl derivative [(SiO)2TaC5H9] (13), which evolves towards cyclopentadienyl derivative [(SiO)2Ta(C5H5)] (14) according to both solid-state NMR and EXAFS spectroscopies."
[8] "This latter complex is inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes, and therefore the formation of cyclopentane in the hydrogenolysis of various cyclic alkanes is probably responsible for the de-activation of the catalyst by formation of cyclopentadienyl complexes."
[9] "In the case of cycloalkanes, more specifically cycloheptane, CC bond activation by a σ-bond metathesis mechanism would lead to the formation of 2, which could then undergo a series of intramolecular CC or CH bond activations by a similar σ-bond metathesis mechanism16 to form cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane, respectively (Scheme 2, Pathway 1)."
[10] "Note that the formation of cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane by intramolecular oxidative addition or σ-bond metathesis mechanisms in the intermediate 2 must involve the formation of metallacycloheptane intermediates or the corresponding transition states (activation of the CH and CC bonds in the ω position of 2)."

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes and intermediates. For cyclic alkanes, particularly cycloheptane, the mechanism begins with the activation of the carbon-carbon (CC) bond through a σ-bond metathesis process, leading to the formation of a tantalum-cyclopentadienyl derivative (compound 2). This compound then undergoes further intramolecular CC or CH bond activations, also via σ-bond metathesis, to form cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane, respectively. 

For linear alkane transformations, the process typically starts with the activation of the carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond. This intermolecular CH bond activation is followed by the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes or metallacyclobutanes. Metallacyclobutanes, especially, play a crucial role in the subsequent hydrogenolysis of the alkane chain, leading to the formation of smaller cyclic or linear alkanes. 

The reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the stability of the catalyst, the nature of the alkane being converted, and the presence of specific intermediates like alkenes or metallacyclobutanes. For instance, the reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis is due to its tendency to react with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which then evolves towards a cyclopentadienyl derivative, rendering the catalyst inactive. This deactivation pathway explains why cyclopentane shows low conversion rates compared to other cyclic alkanes.

The formation of smaller cyclic products in the hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes involves a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes, which are derived from the activation of the alkane rings. The processes of ring expansion or contraction are facilitated by the presence of key intermediates that enable the selective cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds, thus determining the final products in the alkane metathesis reactions.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下烷烃裂解的全面机制，讨论双位点和单位点方案，线性和环烷烃转化过程中涉及的关键步骤，以及关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和作用，这些因素如何影响各种烷烃转换的选择性和催化剂性能。

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂解机制涉及几个关键过程和中间体。对于环烷烃，特别是环庚烷，该机制始于碳-碳（CC）键的激活通过σ-键交换过程，导致形成钽-环戊二烯衍生物（化合物2）。然后，此化合物通过进一步的环内CC或CH键激活，也通过σ-键交换，形成环己烷和甲基环己烷。

对于线性烷烃转换，过程通常从碳-氢（CH）键的激活开始。这种分子间CH键激活随后形成关键中间体，如烯烃或金属环丁烷。尤其是金属环丁烷，在后续的烷烃链氢解反应中起着关键作用，导致形成更小的环状或线性烷烃。

烷烃转换的选择性和催化剂性能受到催化剂稳定性、被转换烷烃的性质以及特定中间体如烯烃或金属环丁烷存在的影响。例如，环戊烷难以进行氢解的原因在于其倾向于与催化剂反应形成环戊基衍生物，然后转化为环戊二烯基衍生物，从而使催化剂失效。这一失活途径解释了环戊烷相比其他环烷烃具有较低转化率的原因。

在环烷烃氢解过程中形成较小环状产物涉及重组和金属环丁烷的氢解的组合。这些中间体促进了碳-碳键的特异性断裂，从而决定了烷烃裂解反应的最终产物。
