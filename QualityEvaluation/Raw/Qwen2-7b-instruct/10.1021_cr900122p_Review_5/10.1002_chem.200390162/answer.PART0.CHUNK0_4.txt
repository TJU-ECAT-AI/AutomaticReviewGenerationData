[1] "Hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes has been widely studied on metal particles, and has given rise to numerous mechanistic debates over the past thirty years."
[2] "This new surface complex can readily be considered as an isolated atom of tantalum in an oxidation state of III stabilized by two siloxy (surface) and the hydride (external) ligands."
[3] "The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carboncarbon bond-cleavage step."
[4] "This species do not catalyse the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes."
[5] "Solid-state 1H NMR spectra of a catalyst after its use in the hydrogenolysis of cyclohexane at 160C do indeed display similar spectral feature (i.e., typical signals at δ=67 ppm of the cyclopentadienyl tantalum species, see Supporting Information) as that of 1 treated with cyclopentane under the same conditions."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. For linear alkane transformations, the mechanism includes the activation of the CH bond followed by rearrangement of the carbon-carbon bond skeleton by ring expansion or contraction. For cyclic alkane transformations, the key step is likely the carbene de-insertion, which acts as a crucial carbon-carbon bond cleavage step. The formation of smaller cyclic compounds involves a carbon-carbon activation step followed by rearrangement of the carbon-carbon bond skeleton through ring expansion or contraction. The formation of acyclic alkanes arises from the ring opening of the corresponding cyclic alkane. Catalyst performance is influenced by the selectivity and efficiency of these steps, which contribute to the overall conversion of various alkane structures.

During the hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes, the reaction leads to the formation of lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes, including cyclopentane. However, cyclopentane does not readily undergo hydrogenolysis. Instead, it reacts with the catalyst to form the cyclopentyl derivative [(SiO)2TaC5H9]. Upon heating, this derivative evolves towards the cyclopentadienyl derivative [(SiO)2Ta(C5H5)]. The cyclopentadienyl derivatives are inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. This deactivation pathway is consistent with the formation of cyclopentadienyl derivatives as inactive species under hydrogenolysis conditions.

The selectivity of the alkane metathesis is influenced by the reactivity of different alkane structures, with cycloheptane being the most readily transformed, followed by methylcyclohexane, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, and finally cyclopentane, which does not undergo hydrogenolysis. This order of reactivity is due to the thermodynamic favorability of the reactions and the kinetic barriers associated with each alkane structure.

催化硅支持钽氢化物的烷烃互变异构全面机制涉及两种位点和单一位点方案。对于线性烷烃转换，机制包括CH键的激活，随后是通过环扩张或收缩重组碳-碳键骨架的重排。对于环烷烃转换，关键步骤很可能是卡宾插入的去除，这作为碳-碳键断裂的关键步骤。形成较小的环化合物涉及碳-碳激活步骤，随后通过环扩张或收缩重组的碳-碳键骨架进行重排。形成直链烷烃的过程来自于环烷烃的环裂解。催化剂性能受到这些步骤的选择性和效率的影响，从而影响各种烷烃结构的整体转化。

在环烷烃的氢解中，反应导致生成较低的烷烃和环烷烃，包括环戊烷。然而，环戊烷不轻易进行氢解。相反，它与催化剂反应形成环戊基衍生物[(SiO)2TaC5H9]。加热后，这种衍生物转化为环戊二烯基衍生物[(SiO)2Ta(C5H5)]。环戊二烯基衍生物在烷烃的氢解中不活性，导致催化剂失活。这一失活途径与在氢解条件下形成环戊二烯基衍生物为不活性物种一致。

烷烃互变异构的选择性受到不同烷烃结构反应性的影响，其中环庚烷最易于转化，其次是甲基环己烷、环己烷、甲基环戊烷，最后是环戊烷，后者不进行氢解。这种反应顺序由于热力学优势和每个烷烃结构的动能壁垒而产生。
