<p>Hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes is catalysed by [(SiO)2TaH] (1) at 160C and leads to lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes including cyclopentane.</p>
<p>The turnover number is correlated with the number of carbon atoms of the cyclic alkanes, and therefore while cycloheptane is readily transformed, cyclopentane does not give any product (<1%).</p>
<p>Under the reaction conditions cyclopentane reacts with 1 to give the corresponding cyclopentyl derivative [(SiO)2TaC5H9] (13), which evolves towards cyclopentadienyl derivative [(SiO)2Ta(C5H5)] (14) according to both solid-state NMR and EXAFS spectroscopies.</p>
<p>This latter complex is inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes, and therefore the formation of cyclopentane in the hydrogenolysis of various cyclic alkanes is probably responsible for the de-activation of the catalyst by formation of cyclopentadienyl complexes.</p>
<p>We have shown that cycloalkanes undergo hydrogenolysis under mild conditions, albeit with low turnovers; the activities are much lower than those obtained with acyclic alkanes.</p>
<p>A key feature is the ring contraction of cycloalkanes under hydrogenolysis conditions, which probably occurs via carbene intermediates (carbene de-insertion/metallacyclobutane).</p>
<p>The order of reactivity of cycloalkanes is as follows: cycloheptane>methylcyclohexane>cyclohexane>methylcyclopentanecyclopentane.</p>
<p>Cyclopentane does not undergo hydrogenolysis, while it readily reacts with 1 to give a cyclopentyl surface complex as a major surface species.</p>
<p>This cyclopentyl derivative evolves upon heating towards the cyclopentadienyl derivative 15, which is inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes.</p>
<p>Since cyclopentane is formed in the hydrogenolysis of higher cycloalkanes, cyclopentane is transformed into cyclopentadienyl species (which are inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes) and the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on 1 provides an aged catalyst with similar spectroscopic features to that of the model cyclopentadienyl surface complex 14, we propose that the deactivation observed in the hydrogenolysis of all cycloalkanes is most consistent with the formation of cyclopentadienyl derivatives as inactive species under hydrogenolysis conditions.</p>
<p>In the case of cycloalkanes, more specifically cycloheptane, CC bond activation by a σ-bond metathesis mechanism would lead to the formation of 2, which could then undergo a series of intramolecular CC or CH bond activations by a similar σ-bond metathesis mechanism to form cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane, respectively (Scheme 2, Pathway 1).</p>
<p>Note that the formation of cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane by intramolecular oxidative addition or σ-bond metathesis mechanisms in the intermediate 2 must involve the formation of metallacycloheptane intermediates or the corresponding transition states (activation of the CH and CC bonds in the ω position of 2).</p>
<p>While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings.</p>
<p>Reaction of cyclohexene with 1 was also investigated. At 150C, in the absence of H2, cyclohexene is mainly transformed into cyclohexane (2.8 equiv), cyclohexadiene (0.001 equiv) and benzene (0.6 equiv) in a disproportionation reaction.</p>
<p>Moreover cyclopentane (0.1 equiv), cyclopentadiene (0.02 equiv), toluene (0.01 equiv) and methylcyclohexane (0.01 equiv) are also observed. Despite their presence in small amounts, their formation is consistent with ring-opening/ring-closing metathesis pathways in which cyclohexene is transformed into cyclopentene and methylcyclohexene, which under the reaction conditions are transformed into cyclopentane, cyclopentadiene, methylcyclohexane and toluene (Scheme 5).</p>
<p>At 250C this signal predominates, and most of the signal at δ=0.8 ppm has disappeared. At the same time, the signal at δ=27 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum has almost vanished.</p>
<p>These data are fully consistent with the formation of [(SiO)2TaCp] (14).</p>
<p>Moreover, EXAFS on samples treated at room temperature and at 200C confirms the evolution of the surface species from [(SiO)2TaC5H9] (13), a major species at room temperature, into [(SiO)2TaCp] (14) at higher temperatures.</p>
<p>The NMR data also show that the proportion of Cp derivatives increases with the reaction temperature, which would speak for tantalum sites with different reactivities.</p>

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. In this context, the document highlights several key points:

1. **Catalyst and Reaction Conditions**: Silica-supported tantalum hydrides [(SiO)2TaH] act as catalysts for hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes at 160°C, leading to the formation of lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes like cyclopentane.

2. **Reactivity and Selectivity**: The reactivity of cyclic alkanes varies, with cycloheptane being readily transformed, whereas cyclopentane undergoes minimal conversion. This disparity in reactivity is attributed to the formation of cyclopentadienyl complexes, which deactivate the catalyst.

3. **Formation of Key Intermediates**: Cyclopentane reacts with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which subsequently evolves into a cyclopentadienyl derivative under heating. These intermediates are inactive in alkane hydrogenolysis, contributing to the catalyst's deactivation.

4. **Role of Metallacyclobutanes**: The mechanism of ring contraction involves carbene de-insertion or the activation of a carbon-carbon bond in a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This pathway facilitates the formation of smaller cyclic products through rearrangements and hydrogenolysis.

5. **Intramolecular Processes**: Intramolecular oxidative addition or σ-bond metathesis in the formation of smaller cyclic products from larger cyclic alkanes involves the activation of CH or CC bonds, leading to the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates.

6. **Deactivation Mechanism**: The deactivation of the catalyst is primarily attributed to the formation of cyclopentadienyl complexes derived from the hydrogenolysis of cyclopentane. These inactive species accumulate and degrade the catalyst's performance.

7. **Mechanistic Insights**: The study employs solid-state NMR and EXAFS spectroscopies to elucidate the reaction pathways, revealing the formation of carbene intermediates and the evolution of catalyst sites with varying reactivities.

This detailed mechanism elucidates the complex interactions between the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst, alkane substrates, and the resulting products, providing insights into the selective hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes under mild conditions.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃互变异构的全面机制涉及理解双位点和单位点方案。在这个背景下，文献强调了几个关键点：

1. **催化剂和反应条件**：二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物[(SiO)2TaH]在160°C下作为环烷烃氢解的催化剂，导致生成较低的烷烃和环烷烃，如环戊烷。

2. **反应性和选择性**：环烷烃的反应性各不相同，环庚烷可以容易地被转化，而环戊烷几乎不发生转化。这种反应性的差异归因于形成环戊二烯基化合物，这会破坏催化剂。

3. **关键中间体的形成**：环戊烷与催化剂反应形成环戊基衍生物，随后在加热时转化为环戊二烯基衍生物。这些中间体在烷烃氢解中是无效的，从而导致催化剂的失活。

4. **环状化合物的形成**：从较大环烷烃到较小环烷烃的形成涉及CH或CC键的激活，在一个金属环丁烷中间体中，这导致了较小环烷基化合物的形成。

5. **脱活机制**：催化剂的脱活主要归因于从环戊烷氢解产生的环戊二烯基化合物的形成。这些无效物种的积累和破坏了催化剂的性能。

6. **机制见解**：通过使用固态NMR和EXAFS光谱研究，揭示了碳正离子中间体的形成以及催化剂位点随温度变化的不同活性。

这个详细机制阐明了催化剂、烷烃底物和产物之间的复杂相互作用，提供了在温和条件下选择性环烷烃氢解的深入理解。
