[1] "The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carboncarbon bond-cleavage step."
[2] "This new surface complex can readily be considered as an isolated atom of tantalum in an oxidation state of III stabilized by two siloxy (surface) and the hydride (external) ligands."
[3] "The percentage conversion varies as a function of the ring size of the starting alkane and its substituents as follows: cycloheptane > methylcyclohexane > cyclohexane > methylcyclopentane>cyclopentane."
[4] "The order of reactivity of cycloalkanes is as follows: cycloheptane>methylcyclohexane>cyclohexane>methylcyclopentanecyclopentane."
[5] "In all cases the activity of the catalyst decreases rapidly, and after 20 h little or no conversion is observed, in agreement with deactivation of 1."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves multiple steps and processes. Key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. In the context of this mechanism:

1. **Two-site and One-site Schemes**: The catalyst facilitates the movement of carbon-carbon bonds through a series of reactions. Two-site schemes refer to processes where two carbon-carbon bonds are cleaved simultaneously, while one-site schemes involve the sequential cleavage of individual bonds. This mechanism allows for the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkane structures.

2. **Linear and Cyclic Alkane Transformations**: Linear alkanes can be converted into shorter or longer chains, while cyclic alkanes can undergo ring-opening reactions or ring contractions. The catalyst enables the activation of carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds and subsequent carbon-carbon (CC) bond cleavage, which is crucial for alkane metathesis.

3. **Formation and Role of Key Intermediates**: Alkenes are formed during the initial stages of the reaction as a result of the cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds. Metallacyclobutanes, complexes involving the metal and four-carbon ring, play a significant role in the ring contraction process. These intermediates are involved in the activation of further bonds and the subsequent formation of smaller cyclic compounds.

4. **Reaction Selectivity and Catalyst Performance**: The selectivity in alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as the ring size of the starting alkane and its substituents. For instance, larger cyclic alkanes tend to undergo ring contractions more readily than smaller ones. The catalyst's performance is closely tied to its ability to efficiently activate and cleave carbon-carbon bonds, with selectivity often determined by the relative thermodynamics of competing pathways.

5. **Deactivation Pathway**: As the reaction progresses, the catalyst becomes deactivated, leading to a decrease in conversion efficiency. This is partly attributed to the formation of inactive species, such as cyclopentadienyl complexes, which accumulate and inhibit further reactions. The deactivation pathway involves the transformation of active cyclopentyl derivatives into inactive cyclopentadienyl derivatives, which then prevent the effective hydrogenolysis of alkanes.

全面分析了由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃互换机制，涉及多个步骤和过程。关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。在此机制中：

1. **双站点与单站点方案**：催化剂通过一系列反应促进了碳-碳键的移动。双站点方案指的是同时切割两个碳-碳键的过程，而单站点方案涉及逐个切割个别键。这种机制允许线性烷烃结构和环状烷烃结构的转换。

2. **线性和环状烷烃转化**：线性烷烃可以被转化为较短或较长的链，而环状烷烃则可以通过开环反应或环收缩。催化剂能够激活碳-氢（CH）键并随后切割碳-碳（CC）键，这是烷烃互换的关键。

3. **关键中间体的形成与作用**：在初始阶段，烯烃作为碳-碳键断裂的结果而形成。金属环丁烷，涉及金属和四个碳环的复合物，在环收缩过程中起着重要作用。这些中间体参与进一步键的激活，并最终导致较小环系统的形成。

4. **反应选择性和催化剂性能**：烷烃转化的选择性受起始烷烃的环大小及其取代基等因素的影响。例如，较大的环状烷烃倾向于比较小的更容易进行环收缩。催化剂的性能与其有效激活和切割碳-碳键的能力密切相关，选择性通常取决于竞争途径的相对热力学特性。

5. **失活途径**：随着反应的进行，催化剂变得失活，导致转化效率下降。这部分归因于无活性物种的积累，如五元环的形成，这抑制了进一步的反应。失活途径涉及将活跃的五元环衍生物转化为无活性的五元环衍生物，进而阻止有效的烷烃氢解。
