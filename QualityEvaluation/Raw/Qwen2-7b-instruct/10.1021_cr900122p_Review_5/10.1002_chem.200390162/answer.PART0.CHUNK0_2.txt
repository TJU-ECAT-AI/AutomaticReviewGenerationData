[1] "Hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes is catalysed by [(SiO)2TaH] (1) at 160C and leads to lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes including cyclopentane."
[2] "The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carboncarbon bond-cleavage step."
[3] "The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis was further studied: under the reaction conditions cyclopentane reacts with 1 to give the corresponding cyclopentyl derivative [(SiO)2TaC5H9] (13), which evolves towards cyclopentadienyl derivative [(SiO)2Ta(C5H5)] (14) according to both solid-state NMR and EXAFS spectroscopies."
[4] "This latter complex is inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes, and therefore the formation of cyclopentane in the hydrogenolysis of various cyclic alkanes is probably responsible for the de-activation of the catalyst by formation of cyclopentadienyl complexes."
[5] "We have shown that cycloalkanes undergo hydrogenolysis under mild conditions, albeit with low turnovers; the activities are much lower than those obtained with acyclic alkanes."
[6] "The order of reactivity of cycloalkanes is as follows: cycloheptane>methylcyclohexane>cyclohexane>methylcyclopentane>cyclopentane."
[7] "Cyclopentane does not undergo hydrogenolysis, while it readily reacts with 1 to give a cyclopentyl surface complex as a major surface species."
[8] "This cyclopentyl derivative evolves upon heating towards the cyclopentadienyl derivative 15, which is inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides includes both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context of cyclic alkane transformations, the process typically involves carbene de-insertion as a key carbon-carbon bond-cleavage step. The mechanism explains the ring contraction observed in cyclic alkanes, such as the conversion of cycloalkanes to lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes like cyclopentane. 

For linear alkane transformations, the mechanism includes both ring opening and subsequent hydrogenolysis steps. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in the reactivity and selectivity of the catalytic process. Alkenes are formed through ring opening, while metallacyclobutanes, generated through specific pathways involving oxidative addition or σ-bond metathesis, act as precursors to smaller cyclic products through rearrangements and hydrogenolysis.

The selectivity of the catalytic process is influenced by factors such as the size and substituents of the alkane. For instance, cycloheptane shows higher reactivity than cyclopentane, which fails to undergo hydrogenolysis under the same conditions. This selectivity is attributed to differences in the formation of key intermediates and their subsequent transformations.

The role of the catalyst is to facilitate these reactions efficiently, allowing for the selective production of desired alkane derivatives. However, the presence of certain products, such as cyclopentane, can lead to deactivation of the catalyst through the formation of inactive cyclopentadienyl complexes. This deactivation pathway is critical in understanding the limitations of the catalytic system in alkane conversions.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex interplay of carbon-carbon bond cleavage, ring opening, and hydrogenolysis steps, facilitated by the formation and transformation of key intermediates. Factors such as alkane structure, catalyst performance, and the presence of deactivating byproducts influence the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process.

全面机制表明，硅基支持钽氢化物催化烷烃互变异构包括双位点和单位点方案。在环烷烃转化的背景下，该过程通常涉及碳-碳键断裂的关键步骤，即卡宾脱插入。这种机制解释了环烷烃的环缩现象，如环烷烃转化为较低的烷烃和环烷烃，例如环戊烷。

对于线性烷烃转化，该机制包括环开裂及其后续氢解步骤。关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，对反应活性和选择性起着至关重要的作用。通过特定途径产生的烯烃是通过环开裂形成的，而通过氧化添加或σ-键互变异构生成的金属环丁烷作为较小环系统形成前体，通过重排和氢解作用。

选择性由烷烃结构、催化剂性能以及副产物的存在等因素影响。例如，环庚烷的反应活性高于环戊烷，后者在相同条件下无法进行氢解。这种选择性归因于关键中间体的形成和随后转换的差异。

催化剂的作用是高效促进这些反应，允许选择性地生产所需的烷烃衍生物。然而，某些产物的存在，如环戊烷，可能导致催化剂失活通过形成无活性的环戊二烯复合物。这一失活途径对于理解烷烃转化催化系统的局限性至关重要。

综上所述，硅基支持钽氢化物催化烷烃互变异构的全面机制涉及复杂的碳-碳键断裂、环开裂和氢解步骤，以及关键中间体的形成和转换。因素如烷烃结构、催化剂性能以及副产物的存在影响催化过程的效率和选择性。
