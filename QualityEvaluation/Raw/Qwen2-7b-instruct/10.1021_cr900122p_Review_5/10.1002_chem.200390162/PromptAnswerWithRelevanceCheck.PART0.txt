The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves multiple steps and processes. Key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. In the context of this mechanism:

1. **Two-site and One-site Schemes**: The catalyst facilitates the movement of carbon-carbon bonds through a series of reactions. Two-site schemes refer to processes where two carbon-carbon bonds are cleaved simultaneously, while one-site schemes involve the sequential cleavage of individual bonds. This mechanism allows for the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkane structures.

2. **Linear and Cyclic Alkane Transformations**: Linear alkanes can be converted into shorter or longer chains, while cyclic alkanes can undergo ring-opening reactions or ring contractions. The catalyst enables the activation of carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds and subsequent carbon-carbon (CC) bond cleavage, which is crucial for alkane metathesis.

3. **Formation and Role of Key Intermediates**: Alkenes are formed during the initial stages of the reaction as a result of the cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds. Metallacyclobutanes, complexes involving the metal and four-carbon ring, play a significant role in the ring contraction process. These intermediates are involved in the activation of further bonds and the subsequent formation of smaller cyclic compounds.

4. **Reaction Selectivity and Catalyst Performance**: The selectivity in alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as the ring size of the starting alkane and its substituents. For instance, larger cyclic alkanes tend to undergo ring contractions more readily than smaller ones. The catalyst's performance is closely tied to its ability to efficiently activate and cleave carbon-carbon bonds, with selectivity often determined by the relative thermodynamics of competing pathways.

5. **Deactivation Pathway**: As the reaction progresses, the catalyst becomes deactivated, leading to a decrease in conversion efficiency. This is partly attributed to the formation of inactive species, such as cyclopentadienyl complexes, which accumulate and inhibit further reactions. The deactivation pathway involves the transformation of active cyclopentyl derivatives into inactive cyclopentadienyl derivatives, which then prevent the effective hydrogenolysis of alkanes.

全面分析了由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃互换机制，涉及多个步骤和过程。关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。在此机制中：

1. **双站点与单站点方案**：催化剂通过一系列反应促进了碳-碳键的移动。双站点方案指的是同时切割两个碳-碳键的过程，而单站点方案涉及逐个切割个别键。这种机制允许线性烷烃结构和环状烷烃结构的转换。

2. **线性和环状烷烃转化**：线性烷烃可以被转化为较短或较长的链，而环状烷烃则可以通过开环反应或环收缩。催化剂能够激活碳-氢（CH）键并随后切割碳-碳（CC）键，这是烷烃互换的关键。

3. **关键中间体的形成与作用**：在初始阶段，烯烃作为碳-碳键断裂的结果而形成。金属环丁烷，涉及金属和四个碳环的复合物，在环收缩过程中起着重要作用。这些中间体参与进一步键的激活，并最终导致较小环系统的形成。

4. **反应选择性和催化剂性能**：烷烃转化的选择性受起始烷烃的环大小及其取代基等因素的影响。例如，较大的环状烷烃倾向于比较小的更容易进行环收缩。催化剂的性能与其有效激活和切割碳-碳键的能力密切相关，选择性通常取决于竞争途径的相对热力学特性。

5. **失活途径**：随着反应的进行，催化剂变得失活，导致转化效率下降。这部分归因于无活性物种的积累，如五元环的形成，这抑制了进一步的反应。失活途径涉及将活跃的五元环衍生物转化为无活性的五元环衍生物，进而阻止有效的烷烃氢解。

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes and intermediates. For cyclic alkanes, particularly cycloheptane, the mechanism begins with the activation of the carbon-carbon (CC) bond through a σ-bond metathesis process, leading to the formation of a tantalum-cyclopentadienyl derivative (compound 2). This compound then undergoes further intramolecular CC or CH bond activations, also via σ-bond metathesis, to form cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane, respectively. 

For linear alkane transformations, the process typically starts with the activation of the carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond. This intermolecular CH bond activation is followed by the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes or metallacyclobutanes. Metallacyclobutanes, especially, play a crucial role in the subsequent hydrogenolysis of the alkane chain, leading to the formation of smaller cyclic or linear alkanes. 

The reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the stability of the catalyst, the nature of the alkane being converted, and the presence of specific intermediates like alkenes or metallacyclobutanes. For instance, the reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis is due to its tendency to react with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which then evolves towards a cyclopentadienyl derivative, rendering the catalyst inactive. This deactivation pathway explains why cyclopentane shows low conversion rates compared to other cyclic alkanes.

The formation of smaller cyclic products in the hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes involves a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes, which are derived from the activation of the alkane rings. The processes of ring expansion or contraction are facilitated by the presence of key intermediates that enable the selective cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds, thus determining the final products in the alkane metathesis reactions.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下烷烃裂解的全面机制，讨论双位点和单位点方案，线性和环烷烃转化过程中涉及的关键步骤，以及关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和作用，这些因素如何影响各种烷烃转换的选择性和催化剂性能。

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂解机制涉及几个关键过程和中间体。对于环烷烃，特别是环庚烷，该机制始于碳-碳（CC）键的激活通过σ-键交换过程，导致形成钽-环戊二烯衍生物（化合物2）。然后，此化合物通过进一步的环内CC或CH键激活，也通过σ-键交换，形成环己烷和甲基环己烷。

对于线性烷烃转换，过程通常从碳-氢（CH）键的激活开始。这种分子间CH键激活随后形成关键中间体，如烯烃或金属环丁烷。尤其是金属环丁烷，在后续的烷烃链氢解反应中起着关键作用，导致形成更小的环状或线性烷烃。

烷烃转换的选择性和催化剂性能受到催化剂稳定性、被转换烷烃的性质以及特定中间体如烯烃或金属环丁烷存在的影响。例如，环戊烷难以进行氢解的原因在于其倾向于与催化剂反应形成环戊基衍生物，然后转化为环戊二烯基衍生物，从而使催化剂失效。这一失活途径解释了环戊烷相比其他环烷烃具有较低转化率的原因。

在环烷烃氢解过程中形成较小环状产物涉及重组和金属环丁烷的氢解的组合。这些中间体促进了碳-碳键的特异性断裂，从而决定了烷烃裂解反应的最终产物。

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides includes both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context of cyclic alkane transformations, the process typically involves carbene de-insertion as a key carbon-carbon bond-cleavage step. The mechanism explains the ring contraction observed in cyclic alkanes, such as the conversion of cycloalkanes to lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes like cyclopentane. 

For linear alkane transformations, the mechanism includes both ring opening and subsequent hydrogenolysis steps. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in the reactivity and selectivity of the catalytic process. Alkenes are formed through ring opening, while metallacyclobutanes, generated through specific pathways involving oxidative addition or σ-bond metathesis, act as precursors to smaller cyclic products through rearrangements and hydrogenolysis.

The selectivity of the catalytic process is influenced by factors such as the size and substituents of the alkane. For instance, cycloheptane shows higher reactivity than cyclopentane, which fails to undergo hydrogenolysis under the same conditions. This selectivity is attributed to differences in the formation of key intermediates and their subsequent transformations.

The role of the catalyst is to facilitate these reactions efficiently, allowing for the selective production of desired alkane derivatives. However, the presence of certain products, such as cyclopentane, can lead to deactivation of the catalyst through the formation of inactive cyclopentadienyl complexes. This deactivation pathway is critical in understanding the limitations of the catalytic system in alkane conversions.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex interplay of carbon-carbon bond cleavage, ring opening, and hydrogenolysis steps, facilitated by the formation and transformation of key intermediates. Factors such as alkane structure, catalyst performance, and the presence of deactivating byproducts influence the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process.

全面机制表明，硅基支持钽氢化物催化烷烃互变异构包括双位点和单位点方案。在环烷烃转化的背景下，该过程通常涉及碳-碳键断裂的关键步骤，即卡宾脱插入。这种机制解释了环烷烃的环缩现象，如环烷烃转化为较低的烷烃和环烷烃，例如环戊烷。

对于线性烷烃转化，该机制包括环开裂及其后续氢解步骤。关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，对反应活性和选择性起着至关重要的作用。通过特定途径产生的烯烃是通过环开裂形成的，而通过氧化添加或σ-键互变异构生成的金属环丁烷作为较小环系统形成前体，通过重排和氢解作用。

选择性由烷烃结构、催化剂性能以及副产物的存在等因素影响。例如，环庚烷的反应活性高于环戊烷，后者在相同条件下无法进行氢解。这种选择性归因于关键中间体的形成和随后转换的差异。

催化剂的作用是高效促进这些反应，允许选择性地生产所需的烷烃衍生物。然而，某些产物的存在，如环戊烷，可能导致催化剂失活通过形成无活性的环戊二烯复合物。这一失活途径对于理解烷烃转化催化系统的局限性至关重要。

综上所述，硅基支持钽氢化物催化烷烃互变异构的全面机制涉及复杂的碳-碳键断裂、环开裂和氢解步骤，以及关键中间体的形成和转换。因素如烷烃结构、催化剂性能以及副产物的存在影响催化过程的效率和选择性。

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. In this context, the document highlights several key points:

1. **Catalyst and Reaction Conditions**: Silica-supported tantalum hydrides [(SiO)2TaH] act as catalysts for hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes at 160°C, leading to the formation of lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes like cyclopentane.

2. **Reactivity and Selectivity**: The reactivity of cyclic alkanes varies, with cycloheptane being readily transformed, whereas cyclopentane undergoes minimal conversion. This disparity in reactivity is attributed to the formation of cyclopentadienyl complexes, which deactivate the catalyst.

3. **Formation of Key Intermediates**: Cyclopentane reacts with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which subsequently evolves into a cyclopentadienyl derivative under heating. These intermediates are inactive in alkane hydrogenolysis, contributing to the catalyst's deactivation.

4. **Role of Metallacyclobutanes**: The mechanism of ring contraction involves carbene de-insertion or the activation of a carbon-carbon bond in a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This pathway facilitates the formation of smaller cyclic products through rearrangements and hydrogenolysis.

5. **Intramolecular Processes**: Intramolecular oxidative addition or σ-bond metathesis in the formation of smaller cyclic products from larger cyclic alkanes involves the activation of CH or CC bonds, leading to the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates.

6. **Deactivation Mechanism**: The deactivation of the catalyst is primarily attributed to the formation of cyclopentadienyl complexes derived from the hydrogenolysis of cyclopentane. These inactive species accumulate and degrade the catalyst's performance.

7. **Mechanistic Insights**: The study employs solid-state NMR and EXAFS spectroscopies to elucidate the reaction pathways, revealing the formation of carbene intermediates and the evolution of catalyst sites with varying reactivities.

This detailed mechanism elucidates the complex interactions between the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst, alkane substrates, and the resulting products, providing insights into the selective hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes under mild conditions.

1. **催化剂和反应条件**：二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物[(SiO)2TaH]在160°C下作为环烷烃氢解的催化剂，导致生成较低的烷烃和环烷烃，如环戊烷。

2. **反应性和选择性**：环烷烃的反应性各不相同，环庚烷可以容易地被转化，而环戊烷几乎不发生转化。这种反应性的差异归因于形成环戊二烯基化合物，这会破坏催化剂。

3. **关键中间体的形成**：环戊烷与催化剂反应形成环戊基衍生物，随后在加热时转化为环戊二烯基衍生物。这些中间体在烷烃氢解中是无效的，从而导致催化剂的失活。

4. **环状化合物的形成**：从较大环烷烃到较小环烷烃的形成涉及CH或CC键的激活，在一个金属环丁烷中间体中，这导致了较小环烷基化合物的形成。

5. **脱活机制**：催化剂的脱活主要归因于从环戊烷氢解产生的环戊二烯基化合物的形成。这些无效物种的积累和破坏了催化剂的性能。

6. **机制见解**：通过使用固态NMR和EXAFS光谱研究，揭示了碳正离子中间体的形成以及催化剂位点随温度变化的不同活性。

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. For linear alkane transformations, the mechanism includes the activation of the CH bond followed by rearrangement of the carbon-carbon bond skeleton by ring expansion or contraction. For cyclic alkane transformations, the key step is likely the carbene de-insertion, which acts as a crucial carbon-carbon bond cleavage step. The formation of smaller cyclic compounds involves a carbon-carbon activation step followed by rearrangement of the carbon-carbon bond skeleton through ring expansion or contraction. The formation of acyclic alkanes arises from the ring opening of the corresponding cyclic alkane. Catalyst performance is influenced by the selectivity and efficiency of these steps, which contribute to the overall conversion of various alkane structures.

During the hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes, the reaction leads to the formation of lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes, including cyclopentane. However, cyclopentane does not readily undergo hydrogenolysis. Instead, it reacts with the catalyst to form the cyclopentyl derivative [(SiO)2TaC5H9]. Upon heating, this derivative evolves towards the cyclopentadienyl derivative [(SiO)2Ta(C5H5)]. The cyclopentadienyl derivatives are inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. This deactivation pathway is consistent with the formation of cyclopentadienyl derivatives as inactive species under hydrogenolysis conditions.

The selectivity of the alkane metathesis is influenced by the reactivity of different alkane structures, with cycloheptane being the most readily transformed, followed by methylcyclohexane, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, and finally cyclopentane, which does not undergo hydrogenolysis. This order of reactivity is due to the thermodynamic favorability of the reactions and the kinetic barriers associated with each alkane structure.

催化硅支持钽氢化物的烷烃互变异构全面机制涉及两种位点和单一位点方案。对于线性烷烃转换，机制包括CH键的激活，随后是通过环扩张或收缩重组碳-碳键骨架的重排。对于环烷烃转换，关键步骤很可能是卡宾插入的去除，这作为碳-碳键断裂的关键步骤。形成较小的环化合物涉及碳-碳激活步骤，随后通过环扩张或收缩重组的碳-碳键骨架进行重排。形成直链烷烃的过程来自于环烷烃的环裂解。催化剂性能受到这些步骤的选择性和效率的影响，从而影响各种烷烃结构的整体转化。

在环烷烃的氢解中，反应导致生成较低的烷烃和环烷烃，包括环戊烷。然而，环戊烷不轻易进行氢解。相反，它与催化剂反应形成环戊基衍生物[(SiO)2TaC5H9]。加热后，这种衍生物转化为环戊二烯基衍生物[(SiO)2Ta(C5H5)]。环戊二烯基衍生物在烷烃的氢解中不活性，导致催化剂失活。这一失活途径与在氢解条件下形成环戊二烯基衍生物为不活性物种一致。

烷烃互变异构的选择性受到不同烷烃结构反应性的影响，其中环庚烷最易于转化，其次是甲基环己烷、环己烷、甲基环戊烷，最后是环戊烷，后者不进行氢解。这种反应顺序由于热力学优势和每个烷烃结构的动能壁垒而产生。
