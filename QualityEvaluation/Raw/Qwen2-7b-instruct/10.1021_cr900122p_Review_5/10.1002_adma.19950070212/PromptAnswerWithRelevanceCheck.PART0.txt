The study shows that at room temperature, four intact MTO molecules can hydrogen-bond to Brmsted acid sites or interact with extraframework cationic sites in the supercages of zeolite Y, for M being hydrogen, sodium, or rubidium. Furthermore, in fully loaded zeolite Y encapsulated with MTO, groups of four MTO molecules associate through Re = 0 Re interactions.

[3] "PXRD studies of these samples demonstrates that the crystallinity of the zeolite host is maintained and there is essentially no change in the dimensions of the unit cell."
[4] "Mid-IR studies of (MTO),,H,,Y show complete loss of su- percage protons (3643 cm- ') together with the proportional growth of a broad structureless, bathochromically shifted band centered around 3250 cm- ' (Fig. 1)."
[5] "These observations indicate a homogeneous distribution of supercage confined MTO, hydrogen-bonded to the Brransted acid sites."

This document discusses the successful encapsulation of MTO in zeolite Y, showing structural characterization, thermal stability, and chemical stability. MTO encapsulated in zeolite Y exhibits a homogeneous distribution of MTO molecules, hydrogen-bonded to the Brmsted acid sites. The electron-withdrawing character of the ReO, group reduces the nucleophilic properties of the methyl group, preventing methane evolution. The mid-IR spectrum confirms the presence of characteristic CH stretching and CH deformation bands. The Re L,,,-edge EXAFS analysis shows that the encapsulated MTO maintains its structural integrity. Color changes occur upon encapsulation, with the Rb,,Y sample turning from white to beige and the Na,,Y sample changing from white to brick-red. XPS analysis indicates that the MTO guests are internally confined within zeolite Y and retain their original oxidation state of +7.

[1] "In an initial series of experiments, intercalation reactions were performed by stirring a suspension of ca. 200 mg of the host lattice in a solution of ca. 200 mg of Mo(Mes), under a nitrogen atmosphere at a variety of temperatures (30- 150C) in a variety of solvents (principally toluene and dimethoxyethane (DME), 5 ml) for periods ranging from 1 hour to several weeks."
[2] "Representative spectra from these experiments, and the reaction conditions under which each sample was prepared, are shown in Figure 2."
[3] "Comparison of Figures 2a and b reveal a fur- ther complication in the study of this particular intercalation system in that the 002 of the intercalated phase (at 11.7/2 A) coincidentally has exactly the same d-spacing as the 001 re- flection of the host material; it is therefore often difficult to judge the extent of reaction."
[4] "Figure 2c shows the effect of reducing the reaction tem- perature to 3 20 "C. Under these conditions the diffraction pattern indicates that the intercalated product contain inter- layer separations of both 11.7 and 13.6 A (20 =7.5" and 20 =8.3", respectively)."
[5] "It can be seen from these data that this intercalation sys- tem is considerably more complex than was originally re- ported."

In preliminary experiments, intercalation reactions were carried out by stirring a suspension of approximately 200 mg of the host lattice in a solution of approximately 200 mg of Mo(Mes), under nitrogen at various temperatures (30-150°C) using various solvents (mainly toluene and dimethoxyethane (DME), 5 ml) for durations ranging from 1 hour to several weeks. Representative spectra from these experiments and the conditions under which each sample was prepared are depicted in Figure 2. Comparing Figures 2a and b highlights a further complexity in this specific intercalation system, where the 002 of the intercalated phase (at 11.7/2 Å) coincidentally matches the 001 reflection of the host material's d-spacing; thus, it's often challenging to determine the reaction extent. Figure 2c illustrates the impact of lowering the reaction temperature to 320°C. Under these conditions, the diffraction pattern suggests the intercalated product contains inter-layer separations of both 11.7 and 13.6 Å (20 =7.5" and 20 =8.3", respectively). These findings indicate that this intercalation system is significantly more intricate than initially reported.

在初步实验中，通过搅拌约200毫克的宿主晶格悬浮液与约200毫克的Mo(Mes)，在氮气氛围下，使用各种温度（30-150°C）和溶剂（主要是二甲氧基乙烷（DME），5毫升）进行一系列反应，持续时间从1小时到数周不等，完成了插层反应。这些实验的代表性谱图以及每份样本制备时的条件如图2所示。对比图2a和b可以发现，对于这种特定的插层系统存在额外的复杂性，即插层相的002（11.7/2 Å）与宿主材料的001反射的d间距恰好相同；因此，很难判断反应的程度。图2c展示了将反应温度降低至320°C的影响。在这种条件下，衍射图案表明插层产物含有11.7 Å和13.6 Å（20 =7.5"和20 =8.3"，分别）的层间分离。这些数据表明，这个插层系统比最初报告的要复杂得多。

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. The reaction typically involves the conversion of linear and cyclic alkanes into alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, respectively. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play crucial roles in the reaction pathways. The selectivity and performance of the catalysts in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the stability of the catalyst, the nature of the alkanes, and the conditions under which the reactions occur. The silica-supported tantalum hydrides enable efficient and selective alkane metathesis due to their ability to stabilize reactive intermediates and promote the desired transformations.
