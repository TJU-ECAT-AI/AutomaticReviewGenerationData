[1] "In an initial series of experiments, intercalation reactions were performed by stirring a suspension of ca. 200 mg of the host lattice in a solution of ca. 200 mg of Mo(Mes), under a nitrogen atmosphere at a variety of temperatures (30- 150C) in a variety of solvents (principally toluene and dimethoxyethane (DME), 5 ml) for periods ranging from 1 hour to several weeks."
[2] "Samples were subsequently washed,dried in vacuo and their X-ray diffraction patterns recorded immediately following work-up."
[3] "Representative spectra from these experiments, and the reaction conditions under which each sample was prepared, are shown in Figure 2."
[4] "It can be seen from these data that this intercalation system is considerably more complex than was originally reported."
[5] "Figure 2 b shows the product phase obtained using a toluene solvent at 150 "C. Under these conditions a single product phase with an interlayer separation of 11.7 (20 =7.5") is formed, suggesting that the molecules all adopt the perpendicular orientation, as originally reported by Davies et al."
[6] "Comparison of Figures 2a and b reveal a fur- ther complication in the study of this particular intercalation system in that the 002 of the intercalated phase (at 11.7/2 A) coincidentally has exactly the same d-spacing as the 001 reflection of the host material; it is therefore often difficult to judge the extent of reaction."
[7] "Figure 2c shows the effect of reducing the reaction temperature to 3 20 "C. Under these conditions the diffraction pattern indicates that the intercalated product contain inter- layer separations of both 11.7 and 13.6 A (20 =7.5" and 10.4")."
