[1] "This material has been demonstrated to have excellent homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic properties in, for example, the metathesis and oxidation of olefin."
[2] "In aqueous acid media MTO has been shown to aggregate to (MTO),."
[3] "At a pressure of 150 bar this material undergoes an interesting depolymerization reaction to regenerate MTO."
[4] "In this communication we describe the successful encapsulation, structural characterization, thermal and chemical stability of MTO in both the sodium and acid forms of dehydrated zeolite Y"
[5] "Quantitative gravimetric experiments establish that at a loading level corresponding to four molecules of MTO per supercage, it is not possible to thermally vacuum desorb the guest molecules from these zeolite hosts."
[6] "Mid-IR studies of (MTO),,H,,Y show complete loss of supercage protons (3643 cm- ')."
[7] "The strong electron-withdrawing character of the ReO, group in MTOr is likely responsible for the reduced nucleophilic properties of the methyl group and lack of methane evolution from the reaction with Brmsted protons."
[8] "The mid-IR spectrum of (MTO),,Na,,Y displays characteristic vCH stretching and 6CH deformation bands at 2986,2899, 1364 cm-'."
[9] "The minimal perturbation of the vCH and 6CH modes of the methyl group on passing from bulk MTO,to occluded MTO in H56Y and Na56Y, implies that the hy- drogen-bonding of the Brmsted acid sites in H56Y to the MTO occurs via CH,ReO, HOZ interactions."
[10] "The Re L,,,-edge EXAFS structure analysis, of bulk MTO as well as (MTO),,Na,,Y at 120 K (the fitting procedure utilized W0,20 and ReO, reference data) shows that the encap- sulated MTO guest retains its structural integrity."
[11] "Within a few hours, the (MTO),,Rb,,Y sample passes from white to beige. By contrast the (MTO),,Na,,Y sample,transforms from white to brick-red in a few days."
[12] "XPS investigations of freshly prepared and annealed samples of (MTO),,Na,,Y clearly signal that the MTO guests are internally confined."
[13] "In view of the fact that bulk MTO is colorless, one is forced to the conclusion that the new visible absorption observed for zeolite Y encapsulated MTO molecules originates from extraframework cation induced aggregation and enhanced intermolecular interactions between MTO guests."
[14] "Adsorption of water causes the de-aggregation of these MTO guests."
[15] "Quantification of the evolved methane was achieved by mid-IR spectroscopy."
[16] "In summary, the combined results of this study demonstrate that, at room temperature, four intact MTO molecules can either hydrogen-bond to Brmsted acid sites or interact with extraframework cationic sites in the supercages of M,,Y, where M = H, Na, Rb."
[17] "The intercalation of inorganic, organic and organometal- lic molecules or ions into lamellar host lattices is now a widely recognized phenomenon."
[18] "The reported increase in the interlayer separation (Ac) of 5.78 A, together with calculated van der Waals dimensions of the guest molecule and lattice expansions of the host lattice were used to infer that this sandwich molecule adopts an orientation with its principal molecular axis perpendicular to the host lattice layers."
[19] "Comparison of Figures 2a and b reveal a further complication in the study of this particular intercalation system in that the 002 of the intercalated phase (at 11.7/2 A) coincidentally has exactly the same d-spacing as the 001 reflection of the host material; it is therefore often difficult to judge the extent of reaction."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. The reaction typically involves the conversion of linear and cyclic alkanes into alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, respectively. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play crucial roles in the reaction pathways. The selectivity and performance of the catalysts in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the stability of the catalyst, the nature of the alkanes, and the conditions under which the reactions occur. The silica-supported tantalum hydrides enable efficient and selective alkane metathesis due to their ability to stabilize reactive intermediates and promote the desired transformations.
