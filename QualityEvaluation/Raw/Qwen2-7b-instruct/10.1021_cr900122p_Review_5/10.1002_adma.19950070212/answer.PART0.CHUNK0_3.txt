[1] "Quantitative gravimetric experiments es- tablish that at a loading level corresponding to four mole- cules of MTO per supercage, it is not possible to thermally vacuum desorb the guest molecules from these zeolite hosts."
[2] "Mid-IR studies of (MTO),,H,,Y show complete loss of su- percage protons (3643 cm- ') together with the proportional growth of a broad structureless, bathochromically shifted band centered around 3250 cm- ' (Fig. 1)."
[3] "This material has been demonstrated to have excellent homogeneous and heteroge- neous catalytic properties in, for example, the metathesis and oxidation of ole fin."
[4] "Under these conditions it is important to note that there is no evidence for the produc- tion of CH,, H,O, CO or CO,"
[5] "It was discovered that CH, in the gas phase and H,O in the zeolite host are the dominant products above 120 "C."

The successful encapsulation, structural characterization, thermal and chemical stability of MTO in both the sodium and acid forms of dehydrated zeolite Y was discussed. Mid-IR studies revealed the complete loss of supercage protons and the proportional growth of a broad, structureless band centered around 3250 cm- '. MTO was demonstrated to possess excellent homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic properties, particularly in metathesis and oxidation of olefin. The absence of methane production under certain conditions was noted. Upon heating above 120°C, the dominant products were found to be CH, in the gas phase and H,O within the zeolite host.

成功封装、结构表征、热稳定性和化学稳定性在干燥的钠型和酸性形式的脱水沸石Y中进行了讨论。中红外研究表明，超笼子质子的完全丢失以及中心位于3250 cm- '的宽而无结构带的成比例增长。证明MTO在均相和异相催化中具有优异的性能，尤其是在烯烃的裂合和氧化中。在特定条件下没有观察到甲烷生成。加热至120°C以上时，主要产物为气相中的CH,和水合物中的H,O。
