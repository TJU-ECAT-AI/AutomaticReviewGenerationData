[1] "The combined results of this study demonstrate that, at room temperature, four intact MTO molecules can either hydrogen-bond to Brmsted acid sites or interact with extraframework cationic sites in the supercages of M,,Y, where M = H, Na, Rb."
[2] "Minimum energy universal force field calculations indicate that in fully loaded (MTO),,M,,Y, groups of four MTO guests associate through Re = 0 Re interactions."

The study shows that at room temperature, four intact MTO molecules can hydrogen-bond to Brmsted acid sites or interact with extraframework cationic sites in the supercages of zeolite Y, for M being hydrogen, sodium, or rubidium. Furthermore, in fully loaded zeolite Y encapsulated with MTO, groups of four MTO molecules associate through Re = 0 Re interactions.

研究表明，在室温下，四个完整的MTO分子可以氢键到Brmsted酸位点或与钠或rubidium的超笼中的额外框架离子位点相互作用。此外，在完全加载的zeolite Y中封装有MTO时，四组MTO分子通过Re = 0 Re相互作用进行聚集。
