[1] "In this communication we describe the successful encapsulation, structural characterization, thermal and chemical stability of MTO in both the sodium and acid forms of dehydrated zeolite Y."
[2] "Quantitative gravimetric experiments es- tablish that at a loading level corresponding to four mole- cules of MTO per supercage, it is not possible to thermally vacuum desorb the guest molecules from these zeolite hosts."
[3] "PXRD studies of these samples demonstrates that the crystallinity of the zeolite host is maintained and there is essentially no change in the dimensions of the unit cell."
[4] "Mid-IR studies of (MTO),,H,,Y show complete loss of su- percage protons (3643 cm- ') together with the proportional growth of a broad structureless, bathochromically shifted band centered around 3250 cm- ' (Fig. 1)."
[5] "These observations indicate a homogeneous distribution of supercage confined MTO, hydrogen-bonded to the Brransted acid sites."
[6] "The strong electron-withdrawing character of the ReO, group in MTOr5] is likely responsible for the reduced nucleophilic properties of the methyl group and lack of methane evolution from the reaction with Brransted protons."
[7] "The mid-IR spectrum of (MTO),,Na,,Y displays charac- teristic vCH stretching and 6CH deformation bands at 2986,2899, 1364 cm-'."
[8] "The minimal perturbation of the vCH and 6CH modes of the methyl group on passing from bulk MTO,to occluded MTO in H56Y and Na,,Y, implies that the hy- drogen-bonding of the Brrnsted acid sites in H,,Y to the MTO occurs via CH,ReO, HOZ interactions."
[9] "The Re L,,,-edge EXAFS structure analysis, of bulk MTO as well as (MTO),,Na,,Y at 120 K (the fitting procedure uti- lized W0,20 and ReO, reference data) shows that the encap- sulated MTO guest retains its structural integrity, with no significant perturbations to its bond lengths compared to those of bulk MTO."
[10] "Some intriguing color changes are observed for MTO fol- lowing encapsulation into zeolite Y hosts at room tempera- ture. Within a few hours, the (MTO),,Rb,,Y sample passes from white to beige. By contrast the (MTO),,Na,,Y sample,transforms from white to brick-red in a few days."
[11] "XPS investigations of freshly prepared and annealed sam- ples of (MTO),,Na,,Y clearly signal that the MTO guests are internally confined (correspondence between the surface and bulk elemental analysis, with evidence for some surface depletion, probably originating from the XPS ultrahigh vacuum environment and exposure to the X-ray source) and that the rhenium remains in its original oxidation state of + 7 [(MTO),,Na,,Y, 4f,,,, 48.9 eV; Re,O,, 4f,,,, 49.2 eV]."

This document discusses the successful encapsulation of MTO in zeolite Y, showing structural characterization, thermal stability, and chemical stability. MTO encapsulated in zeolite Y exhibits a homogeneous distribution of MTO molecules, hydrogen-bonded to the Brmsted acid sites. The electron-withdrawing character of the ReO, group reduces the nucleophilic properties of the methyl group, preventing methane evolution. The mid-IR spectrum confirms the presence of characteristic CH stretching and CH deformation bands. The Re L,,,-edge EXAFS analysis shows that the encapsulated MTO maintains its structural integrity. Color changes occur upon encapsulation, with the Rb,,Y sample turning from white to beige and the Na,,Y sample changing from white to brick-red. XPS analysis indicates that the MTO guests are internally confined within zeolite Y and retain their original oxidation state of +7.

本文讨论了MTO在沸石Y中的成功封装，展示了结构表征、热稳定性和化学稳定性。在沸石Y中封装的MTO显示出均匀分布在Brmsted酸位点上的MTO分子。ReO,团簇的电子吸电子特性降低了甲基团的亲核性，阻止了甲烷的生成。中红外光谱证实了特征的CH拉伸和CH变形模式的存在。Re L,,,-边界的EXAFS分析显示封装的MTO保持其结构完整性。颜色变化发生在封装后，在室温下，Rb,,Y样品从白色变为浅褐色，而Na,,Y样品从白色变为砖红色。XPS分析表明MTO客体在沸石Y中内部受限，并保持原始的+7氧化状态。

[1] "In an initial series of experiments, intercalation reactions were performed by stirring a suspension of ca. 200 mg of the host lattice in a solution of ca. 200 mg of Mo(Mes), under a nitrogen atmosphere at a variety of temperatures (30- 150C) in a variety of solvents (principally toluene and dimethoxyethane (DME), 5 ml) for periods ranging from 1 hour to several weeks."
[2] "Representative spectra from these experiments, and the reaction conditions under which each sample was prepared, are shown in Figure 2."
[3] "Comparison of Figures 2a and b reveal a fur- ther complication in the study of this particular intercalation system in that the 002 of the intercalated phase (at 11.7/2 A) coincidentally has exactly the same d-spacing as the 001 re- flection of the host material; it is therefore often difficult to judge the extent of reaction."
[4] "Figure 2c shows the effect of reducing the reaction tem- perature to 3 20 "C. Under these conditions the diffraction pattern indicates that the intercalated product contain inter- layer separations of both 11.7 and 13.6 A (20 =7.5" and 20 =8.3", respectively)."
[5] "It can be seen from these data that this intercalation sys- tem is considerably more complex than was originally re- ported."

In preliminary experiments, intercalation reactions were carried out by stirring a suspension of approximately 200 mg of the host lattice in a solution of approximately 200 mg of Mo(Mes), under nitrogen at various temperatures (30-150°C) using various solvents (mainly toluene and dimethoxyethane (DME), 5 ml) for durations ranging from 1 hour to several weeks. Representative spectra from these experiments and the conditions under which each sample was prepared are depicted in Figure 2. Comparing Figures 2a and b highlights a further complexity in this specific intercalation system, where the 002 of the intercalated phase (at 11.7/2 Å) coincidentally matches the 001 reflection of the host material's d-spacing; thus, it's often challenging to determine the reaction extent. Figure 2c illustrates the impact of lowering the reaction temperature to 320°C. Under these conditions, the diffraction pattern suggests the intercalated product contains inter-layer separations of both 11.7 and 13.6 Å (20 =7.5" and 20 =8.3", respectively). These findings indicate that this intercalation system is significantly more intricate than initially reported.

在初步实验中，通过搅拌约200毫克的宿主晶格悬浮液与约200毫克的Mo(Mes)，在氮气氛围下，使用各种温度（30-150°C）和溶剂（主要是二甲氧基乙烷（DME），5毫升）进行一系列反应，持续时间从1小时到数周不等，完成了插层反应。这些实验的代表性谱图以及每份样本制备时的条件如图2所示。对比图2a和b可以发现，对于这种特定的插层系统存在额外的复杂性，即插层相的002（11.7/2 Å）与宿主材料的001反射的d间距恰好相同；因此，很难判断反应的程度。图2c展示了将反应温度降低至320°C的影响。在这种条件下，衍射图案表明插层产物含有11.7 Å和13.6 Å（20 =7.5"和20 =8.3"，分别）的层间分离。这些数据表明，这个插层系统比最初报告的要复杂得多。
