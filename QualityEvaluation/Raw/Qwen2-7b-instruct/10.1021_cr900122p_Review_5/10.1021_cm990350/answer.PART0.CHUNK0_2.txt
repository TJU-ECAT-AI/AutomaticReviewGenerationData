The synthesis of OV[OSi(OtBu)3]3 was achieved through a reaction between OVCl3 and HOSi(OtBu)3. After thermolysis in n-octane at 180 C, a green gel was produced, which, upon drying, formed a xerogel with a surface area of 320 m2 g-1, an average pore size of 140 Å, and a total pore volume of 2.25 cm3 g-1. The infrared spectrum of the V/Si/O xerogel resembles that of vanadiasubstituted silicalite with MFI (ZSM-5) topology. The dispersion of vanadia in silica was determined using 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy on the calcined xerogel. The uncalcined xerogel displayed a mesoporous structure with a surface area of 320 m2 g-1 and a total pore volume of 2.25 cm3 g-1. The propene selectivity as a function of propane conversion was illustrated in Figure 11.

OV[OSi(OtBu)3]3通过OVCl3和HOSi(OtBu)3的反应合成。在n-octane中进行180 C的热解后，生成了一种绿色凝胶，干燥后形成了具有320 m2 g-1表面积、平均孔径为140 Å和总孔体积为2.25 cm3 g-1的气凝胶。V/Si/O气凝胶的红外光谱与具有MFI（ZSM-5）拓扑结构的范德华硅酸盐类似。通过在煅烧后的气凝胶上使用29Si MAS核磁共振光谱确定了硅酸盐中的钒分布。未煅烧的气凝胶显示出介孔结构，表面积为320 m2 g-1，总孔体积为2.25 cm3 g-1。丙烯选择性随丙烷转化率的变化情况如图11所示。
