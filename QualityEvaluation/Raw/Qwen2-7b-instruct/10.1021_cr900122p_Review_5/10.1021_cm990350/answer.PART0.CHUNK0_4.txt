The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two primary schemes: two-site and one-site. This process is characterized by the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkane molecules through the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The key intermediates play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. 

The detailed mechanism includes the following steps:

1. **Formation of Alkenes**: The initial step involves the cleavage of the alkane molecule's carbon-carbon bond, leading to the formation of an alkene. This is facilitated by the active sites on the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst.

2. **Formation of Metallacyclobutanes**: The alkenes subsequently undergo a rearrangement process, forming metallacyclobutanes. This intermediate step is critical for the subsequent transformations.

3. **Conversion to Desired Products**: The metallacyclobutanes undergo further reactions, leading to the formation of the desired products. This can involve ring-opening reactions, isomerizations, and other transformations depending on the specific alkane and catalyst conditions.

4. **Role of Key Intermediates**: The alkenes and metallacyclobutanes act as key intermediates, facilitating the overall alkane metathesis process. Their stability and reactivity are influenced by factors such as the concentration of the catalyst, temperature, and the nature of the alkane substrate.

5. **Reaction Selectivity and Catalyst Performance**: The selectivity of the alkane metathesis process and the performance of the catalyst are influenced by the catalyst's ability to efficiently manage the formation and manipulation of these intermediates. Factors such as the catalyst's surface area, acidity, and the presence of specific metal sites (like tantalum) play significant roles in determining the efficiency of the process.

In conclusion, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides relies on the strategic formation and manipulation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as intermediates, contributing to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
