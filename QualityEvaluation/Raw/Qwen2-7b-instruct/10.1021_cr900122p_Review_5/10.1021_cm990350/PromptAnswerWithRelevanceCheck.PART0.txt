The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two primary schemes: two-site and one-site catalysis. In the context of this literature, the mechanism focuses on the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkanes, with the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes playing pivotal roles in determining reaction selectivity and catalyst performance.

Key steps in the mechanism include:
1. Activation of the alkane substrate by the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst.
2. Formation of an alkene intermediate through a concerted process involving the insertion of a hydrogen atom from the catalyst into the alkane.
3. Rearrangement of the alkene intermediate to form a metallacyclobutane species, which is a critical step in the catalytic cycle.
4. Subsequent decomposition of the metallacyclobutane to regenerate the catalyst and release the alkene product.

These mechanisms demonstrate the ability of the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst to selectively convert alkanes into alkenes and, under certain conditions, cyclic alkane derivatives. The role of the catalyst in facilitating the formation and stabilization of metallacyclobutanes is essential for achieving high yields of desired alkene products. The detailed mechanisms and intermediates discussed in the literature provide insights into the efficiency and selectivity of the alkane metathesis reactions catalyzed by this type of catalyst.

The catalyst performance is influenced by factors such as the nature of the catalyst, the conditions under which the reactions are carried out (e.g., temperature, solvent, and reactant concentrations), and the specific alkane substrates being converted. Understanding these factors helps in optimizing the catalyst design and reaction parameters to enhance the overall efficiency and selectivity of alkane metathesis reactions.

Analysis of the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the processes and intermediates involved in both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context of this literature, the focus is on the use of vanadyl tert-butoxy orthosilicate (OV[OSi(OtBu)3]3) as a model for isolated vanadyl sites on silica. The mechanism of alkane metathesis involves the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes through the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions are influenced by the coordination sphere of vanadium, the dispersion of vanadia in the silica matrix, and the role of water in catalyzing VOSi cleavage and the formation of VOV bonds.

The literature describes the synthesis, characterization, and application of OV[OSi(OtBu)3]3 as a model for isolated vanadyl sites on silica. This complex is synthesized from OVCl3 and HOSi(OtBu)3 and characterized by various spectroscopic techniques including 1H, 13C, 29Si, and 51V NMR, FT-Raman, FT-IR, EXAFS, UV-vis spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. The characterization reveals the coordination sphere of vanadium and the structure of the complex. The thermolysis of the complex leads to the formation of a green gel which upon drying forms a xerogel with a high surface area, average pore size, and total pore volume. This xerogel is used as a catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, showing high selectivity and activity.

In the context of alkane metathesis, the catalyst plays a crucial role in facilitating the transformation of alkanes into alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by factors such as the dispersion of vanadia in the silica matrix, the coordination sphere of vanadium, and the role of water in catalyzing the reaction. The literature demonstrates the effectiveness of silica-supported tantalum hydrides as catalysts for alkane metathesis, highlighting the importance of detailed characterization and optimization of the catalyst for improved performance in various alkane conversions.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two primary schemes: two-site and one-site. This process is characterized by the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkane molecules through the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The key intermediates play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. 

The detailed mechanism includes the following steps:

1. **Formation of Alkenes**: The initial step involves the cleavage of the alkane molecule's carbon-carbon bond, leading to the formation of an alkene. This is facilitated by the active sites on the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst.

2. **Formation of Metallacyclobutanes**: The alkenes subsequently undergo a rearrangement process, forming metallacyclobutanes. This intermediate step is critical for the subsequent transformations.

3. **Conversion to Desired Products**: The metallacyclobutanes undergo further reactions, leading to the formation of the desired products. This can involve ring-opening reactions, isomerizations, and other transformations depending on the specific alkane and catalyst conditions.

4. **Role of Key Intermediates**: The alkenes and metallacyclobutanes act as key intermediates, facilitating the overall alkane metathesis process. Their stability and reactivity are influenced by factors such as the concentration of the catalyst, temperature, and the nature of the alkane substrate.

5. **Reaction Selectivity and Catalyst Performance**: The selectivity of the alkane metathesis process and the performance of the catalyst are influenced by the catalyst's ability to efficiently manage the formation and manipulation of these intermediates. Factors such as the catalyst's surface area, acidity, and the presence of specific metal sites (like tantalum) play significant roles in determining the efficiency of the process.

In conclusion, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides relies on the strategic formation and manipulation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as intermediates, contributing to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
