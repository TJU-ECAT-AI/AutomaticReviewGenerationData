Analysis of the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the processes and intermediates involved in both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context of this literature, the focus is on the use of vanadyl tert-butoxy orthosilicate (OV[OSi(OtBu)3]3) as a model for isolated vanadyl sites on silica. The mechanism of alkane metathesis involves the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes through the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions are influenced by the coordination sphere of vanadium, the dispersion of vanadia in the silica matrix, and the role of water in catalyzing VOSi cleavage and the formation of VOV bonds.

The literature describes the synthesis, characterization, and application of OV[OSi(OtBu)3]3 as a model for isolated vanadyl sites on silica. This complex is synthesized from OVCl3 and HOSi(OtBu)3 and characterized by various spectroscopic techniques including 1H, 13C, 29Si, and 51V NMR, FT-Raman, FT-IR, EXAFS, UV-vis spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. The characterization reveals the coordination sphere of vanadium and the structure of the complex. The thermolysis of the complex leads to the formation of a green gel which upon drying forms a xerogel with a high surface area, average pore size, and total pore volume. This xerogel is used as a catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, showing high selectivity and activity.

In the context of alkane metathesis, the catalyst plays a crucial role in facilitating the transformation of alkanes into alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by factors such as the dispersion of vanadia in the silica matrix, the coordination sphere of vanadium, and the role of water in catalyzing the reaction. The literature demonstrates the effectiveness of silica-supported tantalum hydrides as catalysts for alkane metathesis, highlighting the importance of detailed characterization and optimization of the catalyst for improved performance in various alkane conversions.
