Summary 
Beta-migratory insertion and elimination processes for alkyl derivatives 
of permethylscandocene, 
($-CsMe,),Sc-R, 
have been investigated. Ethyl- 
ene is rapidly polymerized at -80 
“C by (~s-CsMes),Sc-R 
(R = H, CHa, 
CH,CHs, CH2CH2CH3, etc.) without the need for a cocatalyst. The relative 
rates of ethylene insertion into scandium-alkyl bonds and the propensity 
for P-H elimination to afford olefin and (~s-CSMes)2Sc-H are found to 
depend critically on the nature of R. With less sterically encumbered scan- 
docene compounds (e.g. [($-CsMe4)SiMe2(gS-CsMe4)]Sc-H), 
o-olefins are 
oligomerized selectively to the ‘head-to-tail’ dimers, and catalytic cycliza- 
tion of 
1,5-hexadiene 
or 1,6-heptadiene 
to methylenecyclopentane 
or 
methylenecyclohexane 
is observed. Both a- and P-migratory insertion and 
elimination processes, which interconvert alkyl with alkylidene hydride 
or olefin hydride derivatives of permethyltantalocene (i.e. [(qs-CSMes)2- 
Ta-X-R] 
2 (r,s-CsMes)2Ta(=X)R 
(X = alkylidene, olefin; R = H, alkyl)), 
have been examined. For a complex with the alkyl substituent appended 
from a cyclopentadienyl 
ligand, [ 
( 
qs-C,Me,)( $, ~1-C,Me4CH,CH,CH,)Ta], 
the relative rates of a-H and P-H elimination have been measured, and, 
significantly, a-H elimination is found to be 10’ times faster than P-H elim- 
ination at 100 “C. The relative rates of the hydrogen and methyl migrations 
to alkylidene, benzyne and olefin ligands have been determined. Related 
(Y 
and @ elimination processes have been examined for some alkoxide, thiol- 
ate and amide derivatives, [(qs-CsMes)2Ta-YCH3] 
(Y = 0, S, NCHs).

Together 
with 
ligand 
substitution, 
oxidative 
addition, 
reductive 
elimination 
and ‘sigma bond metathesis’ 
reactions 
[2], 
migratory 
insertion 
and elimination 
comprise 
the elementary 
steps in the 
wide 
range 
of 
catalytic 
reactions 
promoted 
by organotransition 
metal 
compounds. 
The term 
‘migratory 
insertion’ 
is itself ambiguous 
in its meaning, 
but 
has generally 
been used to refer to any process involving the overall insertion 
of an unsaturated 
group 
X (e.g. carbon 
monoxide, 
olefin, acetylene, 
alkyl- 
idene or alkylidyne), 
either 
metal-bound 
or free, into a M-Z 
bond. Where 
a distinction 
can be made, experiments 
have invariably 
shown that the group 
Z migrates 
from metal to the coordinated 
group X. The microscopic 
reverse 
of this process 
has also lacked a concise, 
widely-accepted 
term to describe 
it, except 
for metal alkyls, where o-H elimination 
and P-H elimination, 
etc. 
have been used extensively 
with a clear meaning*. 
Recognizing 
that 
both 
involve 
migration 
of Z either from metal to X (or Y) or from X (or Y) to 
metal, 
we propose 
the general 
terms cw-Z migratory 
insertion/a-Z 
elimina- 
tion 
and /3-Z migratory 
insertion/fl-Z 
elimination 
for the reactions 
shown

of 
permethylscandocene 
have recently 
been described

*The meaning of Q-H elimination (as contrasted 
with CI-H abstraction) 
has a clear 
meaning; however, no distinction has been made between 0-H elimination to generate an 
olefin hydride complex and P-H elimination to generate free olefin and the metal hydride 
complex.

do complexes, Cp*$c-R; 
(R = alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, etc.), unlike 
their ($-CsHs) counterparts, are stable monomeric species due to unfavor- 
able contacts between Cp* ligands which would necessarily arise for oligo- 
merit structures supported by [Sc(p-R)Sc] 
3-center, 2-electron bridges. 
These complexes undergo rapid ‘sigma bond metathesis’ reactions with di- 
hydrogen or the C-H bonds of hydrocarbons: 
Cp*,Sc-R 
+ R’-H I 
Cp*,Sc-R’ 
+ R-H 
(1) 
(R’ = H > spC > sp2C > spk) 
Cp*,Sc-H 
undergoes rapid insertion reactions with olefins (at -80 
“C), 
generating the alkyl derivatives shown below : 
CH2=CH2 
Polymerization occurs with excess C2H4. The rates of ethylene insertion 
into the SC-R bond for the complexes Cp*,Sc-R 
(R = H, CHs, CH2CHs, 
CH2CH2CHs) have been measured by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The second- 
order rate constants (M-l s-l, -80 
“C) are R = H, > 10V2; R = CHs, &l(2) X 
1o-4 ; R = CH,CHs, 
4.4(2) X 10e4; and R = CH2CH2CHs, 6.1(2) X 10W3. 
Insertion of ethylene into the SC-CH2CHs bond is thus slower than ex- 
pected on the basis of the rates for insertion into Sc-CH3 and Sc-CH2CH2- 
CHs. Significantly, Cp*2Sc-CH2CHs has been shown to have an agostic 
structure with a P-C-H to scandium interaction [2], and it is this ground 
state stabilization which is likely associated with the higher activation 
barrier towards insertion of ethylene. The propyl derivative has a conven- 
tional structure [2], undoubtedly due to unfavorable steric interactions of 
the methyl group of the propyl ligand with a Cp* ligand which would 
necessarily accompany the analogous agostic structure. Schmidt and Brook- 
hart have pointed out that metal complexes which show a propensity for 
such P-C-H to metal interactions are also often effective olefin polymeriza- 
tion catalysts [8]. Although such an interaction does not appear to assist 
olefin insertion into a metal-alkyl bond (rather it appears to add slightly 
to the activation barrier), the factors which encourage agostic alkyl struc- 
tures (a very electrophilic metal center) also appear to encourage olefin 
insertion. Thus, our results provide further support for the conclusions 
of Brookhart. 
Analogous to the insertion of olefins into the scandium-alkyl bonds 
to generate homologous 
alkyl derivatives, the reactions of Cp*2Sc-R (R = 
H, CHs) with 2-butyne result in insertion leading to the formation of an 
24 
alkenyl derivative (eqn. (3)). The reaction of CH,CGCCH3 with Cp*,Sc-CHs 
is characterized by a small enthalpy of activation (AE?s = 9.7(3) kcal mol-‘) 
and a very negative entropy of activation (AS* = -36(2) 
e.u.)*, the latter 
reflecting the very ordered nature of the transition states for these alkyne 
insertion reactions.

With higher alkyls, ,6-H elimination 
to afford olefin and Cp*,Sc-H, 
which 
rapidly inserts X-butyne, is observed. By carrying out these reactions with 
excess 2butyne 
( [CH3CECCH3] = 1 - 3 M), P-H elimination 
is rate-deter- 
mining, and the following relative rates have been measured:

A tentative picture of the transition state for 0-H elimination, reminiscent 
of that proposed for olefin insertion into the Nb-H bonds for the niobocene 
system [ 
4,5], thus appears to be indicated.

A likely mechanism involves insertion of cx-olefin to yield [SC-CH2CH2R] 
(eqn. (2)), a second insertion of a-olefin to afford the primary, rather than 
the more crowded tertiary, scandium alkyl [ SC-CH,CH( R)( CH,CH,R)] 
, and 
then /3-H 
elimination occurring much faster than a third insertion of a-olefin. 
{(q5-CsMe4),SiMez}Sc-H 
also rapidly catalyzes the isomerization 
of 
methylenecyclopropane 
to butadiene by a mechanism which is likely com- 
prised of olefin insertion followed by /3-alkyl 
and P-H elimination. Similarly, 
ring-closure of 1,5-hexadiene 
or 1,6-heptadiene 
to methylene cyclopentane 
or methylene cyclohexane 
occurs readily in the presence of {($-CsMe&- 
SiMez}Sc-H, 
with /3-alkyl migratory insertion, rather than /3-alkyl 
elimina- 
tion, as a key step in the catalysis (Scheme 1).

Alpha and beta migratory insertion and elimination processes for derivatives 
of permethyltantalocene 
Alkyl derivatives of permethyltantalocene 
[Cp*,Ta-R] 
, unlike those 
of permethylscandocene, 
are extremely unstable, and these lfjelectron 
d2 
26 
complexes 
undergo 
rapid CX-H 
and P-H elimination 
reactions 
to yield isolable 
alkylidene 
hydride 
or olefin 
hydride 
derivatives, 
Thus, 
treatment 
of Cp**- 
TaCl, [9f with two equiv of LiCH3, CH,=CHMgBr, 
CH$H,MgCl, 
or C&&i 
yields 
Cp*ZTa{=CH,)H 
[lo], 
Cp*,Ta(==C=CH,)H 
[lo], 
Cp*,Ta(CB&H,)H 
[lo] 
or the benzyne 
hydride 
derivative 
Cp*2Ta(CBH4)H, via the [Cp”,Ta-R] 
intermediates 
(eqn. (9)). 
Indeed, 
these 
unstable 
[Cp*,Ta-R] 
(R = CH3, Cl&=CH, 
CH&H2, 
C,H,) 
derivatives 
are in equilibrium 
with the alkylidene 
hydride 
or olefin 
hydride 
complexes, 
and [Cp*,Ta-R] 
may be trapped 
with small, 2electron 
donor 
ligands 
such as carbon 
monoxide, 
methylisocyanide, 
CSZ, HCZCH, 
SZ, S or ethylene. 
Uxidative 
addition 
of H-H, 
C-H, 
N-H, 
U-H, 
Si-H, 
P-H

is also facile. Thus, for example, 
treat- 
ment 
of Cp*,Ta(=CH2)H 
with 
silane or phosphine 
affords 
Cp*2TafCH3)- 
(SiH3)H 
or Cp*2Ta(CH3)(PH2)H. 
The reaction 
with 
dihydrogen 
results 
in 
reductive 
elimination 
of methane 
followed 
by addition 
of a second equiva- 
lent of Hz to yield 
Cp*,TaH3. 
We infer, 
therefore, 
that (SiH3) and (PH,) 
occupy 
the central 
equatorial 
positiun, 
and methyl and hydrogen 
the lateral 
sites of the “bent sandwich’ structures 
(eqn. (10)).

With water, 
dimethylamine,

and methanethiol, 
subsequent 
reactions 
take place after addition 
of Lhe X-H

Thus, treatment 
of 
Cp*,Ta(==C&)H 
with 
Hz0 yields methane 
and Cp*2Ta(=O)H, 
presumably 
via oxidative 
addition 
of an O-H 
bond to [ Cp*,Ta-CHJ 
, reductive

tion

and CZ~H 
elimination 
from 
[Cp4;Ta-OH]. 
Formation 
of 
CH,D and Cp*2Ta(=O)D 
from 
Cp*,Ta(=CH,)H 
and I&U is in agreement 
with this tentative 
mechanism. 
The reaction 
of Cp*2Ta(=C!H2)H with meth- 
anol affords 
methane 
and the formaldehyde-hydride 
complex 
Cp*,Ta(q2-

presumably 
by an analogous 
sequence, 
but with 0-H elimination 
occurring 
rapidly 
from 
the intermediate

by slow conversion to Cp*2Ta(=X)CHs

Deprotonation 
cleanly affords the methylmethyl- 
idene complex Cp*,Ta(=CH2)CH3 which may also be obtained via treatment 
of Cp*,Ta( =CH2)H with CH2PMes. At 140 “C Cp*2Ta(=CH2)CHs cleanly 
rearranges to Cp*,Ta(CH,=CH,)H 
via methyl migration from Ta to methyl-

tion from the ethyl complex 
[Cp*,Ta-CH&Hs]

Thermal 
rearrangement of Cp*,Ta(=CH,)CHs 
to Cp*2Ta(CH2=CH2)H proceeds at 
nearly the same rate as that for Cp*,Ta(=CH,)CD,

sistent with a step-wise process with rate-limiting cw-CHs 
migratory insertion.

This result illustrates an interesting reversal in thermodynamics for the 
systems [Cp*,Ta-XCHs] 
(X = 0, S, NCHs, CH2): for X = 0, S and NCHs, 
Cp*,Ta(=X)CHs 
are more stable than Cp*,Ta(q2-XCH2)H, 
whereas for 
X = CH2 the opposite is the case. 
Relative rates of alpha and beta migratory insertion and elimination reac-

We now consider in more detail some of these o-R and 0-R (R = H, 
alkyl) migratory insertion and elimination processes. The rate of a-H mi- 
gratory insertion in the equilibrium between Cp*,Ta(=CH,)H 
and [CP*~- 
Ta-CHs] 
is such that it may be probed by magnetization transfer experi- 
ments (eqn. (12)).

Unfortunately, 
broadening (presumably 18*Ta quadrupolar) of the Ta-H 
“H NMR resonance corn licates these measurements, so that a rather inexact 
rate (Fz

at 10 “C) is obtained from 
m~etization 
transfer between Ta-EJ and Ta=C& for Cp**Ta(

A more accurate value for an o-H migratory insertion can be obtained 
for Cp*(~S-C,Me,Ph)Ta(=CHZ)H. 
This complex is chiral, and o-H migratory 
insertion to generate the achiral intermediate [Cp*($-C,MeJ’h)Ta-CHs] 
followed 
by o-H elimination results in racemization. Coalescence of the 
resonances for the two sets of diastereotopic methyl groups of the ($- 
C~Me~Me~Ph) 
ligand provides an accurate measure of kl (Fig. 1). At 40 “C 
the activation free energy for a-H migratory insertion is 15.5(l) keal mol-I,

The chiral probe inherent in the [Cp*($-CsMe,Ph)Ta(=X)R] 
system 
also allows measurement of the rate of (Y-H migratory insertion for the 
vinylidene hydride complex Cp*,Ta( =C=CH*)H (Fig. 3). 
Interconversion of the enantiomers of Cp*(n5-C5Mezh)Ta( =C=CH?)H 
requires rotation of the vinyl group about the Ta-CHCH, 
bond, a process 
which likely involves a non-negligible activation energy. Thus, the AG*,,,i. 
obtained from these experiments provides only an upper limit for the 
a-H migratory insertion process. In order to estimate the additional barrier 
for rotation about the Ta-CHCH2 
bond, the closely related system Cp*- 
(q5-C5Me$h)Ta( CH*=CHJH was examined. Magnetization transfer between 
Ta-H 
and Ta(CH&I&) 
provides the barrier for P-H migratory insertion 
(AGSH,I,. 
ins 
.) = 20,7(l) 
kcal mol-i at 100 “C), whereas coalescence of 
the diastereoscopic methyl groups of the (q5-C5Me,Me2Ph) ligand determines 
the barrier for racemization (AG’(fl-Hd,.i,e.) 
+ [A(AG$],,t.

and (approximately) 
for

mated to be 17( 1) kcal mol-l.

at 100 “C give 
a AGS = 21.3(l) kcal mol-’ for P-H migratory insertion, comparable to that 
obtained 
for Cp*($-CsMe$h)Ta(CH,=CH,)H. 
Similar studies on the ben- 
zyne hydride

lower 
barrier (AG$ = 16.5(l) kcal mol-’ at 23 “C) for this /3-H

These results clearly demonstrate that mH migratory insertion processes are 
generally favored over the corresponding LY-CH~ 
migratory insertion. Com- 
parison of the relative rates of migration of H and CH, from Ta to methylene 
illustrates the tremendous (lOlo) rate advantage enjoyed by hydrogen over 
methyl. This difference is principally attributable to the nondirectional 
Is 
valence orbital of H (vis-&is the directional sp3 hybrid of CH3) which pro- 
vides much more bonding in the transition state for (Y 
migration. If this 
same ratio applies to the analogous 0 migratory insertion processes, the rate 
of migration of methyl from Ta to the &(olefin)-carbon 
of Cp*,Ta(CH,= 
CH2)CH3 is estimated to be unobservably slow (tl,z = 2000 years at 50 “C). 
It is therefore not surprising that we have thus far been unable to effect 
this transformation. Interestingly, cr-H migratory insertion to methylene is 
favored by a factor of lo3 over 6-H migratory insertion to ethylene. These 
data provide no indication as to relative rates of the reverse reactions, e.g. 
the relative rates of cr-H 
and /3-H 
elimination for tantalum alkyls, except that 
they must occur at least 100 times faster than the insertion processes (other- 
wise the 16electron intermediates could be observed). 
An opportunity 
to study cu-H and /3-H elimination from a common 
alkyl is provided by the complex sequence of rearrangements which accom- 
pany the thermal decomposition of Cp*,Ta( =C=CH,)H (Fig. 7).

‘H NMR observation of the decomposition reveals that Cp*,Ta(=C= 
CH2)H cleanly rearranges initially to Cp*(q5, $-C5Me4CH2CH2CH=)TaH, 
most likely via a sequence involving [Cp*,Ta-CH=CHJ, 
[ Cp*($-C5Me4- 
CH2)Ta(H)(CH=CH,)], 
[Cp*($C,Me&H,)Ta(CH,=CHJ]

ture of Cp*(q’, q’-C&Me&H,CH,CH=)TaH 
and its tautomer Cp*(q5, q*- 
C5Me4CH2CH=CH2)TaH (Kep = 5.8(2) at 100 “C). Photolysis (Pyrex filter) 
33 
of this mixture at 25 “C yields exclusively the kinetic isomer Cp*($, $- 
CsMe&H&H2CH=)TaH. 
Measurements of the rates of approach to equi- 
librium reveal that the barrier for rearrangement of Cp*($, 
$-CSMe&H2-

to 
CP*(TJ’, 
~2-C,Me&H2CH=CH2)TaH 
(via 
[Cp*(v’, vi-

(100 “C). Moreover, 
the chiral nature of Cp*($, r)‘-C,Me&H2CH2CH=)TaH 
gives rise to dia- 
stereotopic methyl groups and hydrogens of the metallated ring: Cp*(q5, 
r$C&e,M_e2CI12CI12CH=)TaH. Thus, measurements of the rates of inter- 
conversion of these diastereotopic groups, via the symmetric intermediate

The difference in these two barriers provides the kinetic advantage of 
o-H elimination us. /3-H elimination for the intermediate [Cp*($, 
$-CsMe4- 
CH2CH2CH2)Ta] 
: AG$(P-Heiim) - AG*(wH,~,,) 
= 13.6(2) kcal mol-’ ; hence 
the rate of o-H elimination is 10’ times greater than the rate of /3-H 
elimina- 
tion for [Cp*(q’, $-C5Me&H2CH2CH2)Ta]. 
The generality of faster o-H 
elimination us. /3-H elimination is questionable, since the transition state 
for /3-H elimination in this system is highly strained, whereas that for a-H 
elimination is much less so. Indeed, the greater barrier for migration of 
34 
hydrogen 
from 
Ta to the /3-(olefin)carbon 
of (n5-C5Me5)(q5, q2-C5Me4CH2- 
CH=CH2)TaH 
(AGS = 31.7(2) kcal mol-i) 
as compared 
with the (unstrained) 
ethylene 
hydride 
(T5-C5Me,),Ta(CH2=CH2)H 
(AG* = 21.3(2) 
kcal mol-‘) 
suggests that approximately 
10 kcal mol-’ of the 13.6 kcal mol-’ difference 
in free energy 
of activation 
is attributable 
to the strain energy 
associated 
with the transition 
state for /3-H elimination 
for [(q5-CsMe5)(q5, 
$-C5Me4- 
CH,CH,CH,)Ta]. 
In contrast, 
the barrier 
for o-H insertion 
in Cp*(n’, ql- 
C&vle&H&H&H=)TaH 
is comparable 
to that 
in Cp*,Ta(=CH,)H, 
sug- 
gesting 
that 
the transition 
state for the a-migratory 
process 
is not exces- 
sively strained. 
This 
observation 
of faster 
o-H elimination 
from 
[Cp*(q5, $-C5Mec 
CH,CHsCH,)Ta] 
leading 
to the kinetic 
product, 
the alkylidene 
hydride, 
rather 
than 
direct 
/3-H elimination 
to the more stable product, 
the olefin 
hydride, 
raises the question 
as to the relative rates of (x and 0-H elimination 
for other 
alkyls. 
That 
is to say, is it possible 
that simple alkyls such as 
[Cp*,Ta-CH&H,J 
undergo 
rapid, 
reversible 
o-H elimination 
to the (less 
stable) 
ethylidene 
hydride 
[ Cp*,Ta( =CHCH,)H] 
many 
times before 
[ 
Cp*,- 
Ta-CH2CH,] 
undergoes 
/3-H elimination 
to the stable, 
observed 
product, 
the ethylene 
hydride 
Cp*2Ta(CH2=CH2)H? 
In this respect, it is worth noting 
that 
the 
equilibrium 
between 
Ta(CH2=CH2)(CH2CMes)Clz(PMes)2 
and 
Ta(CH2CHs)(=CHCMes)C12(PMes)2, 
reported 
by Fellmann 
and co-workers 
[12], 
shows 
that 
the products 
of a-H and P-H elimination 
inter-convert; 
however, 
the relative 
rates 
of a-H elimination 
from the neopentyl 
group 
us. /3-H elimination 
from 
the ethyl 
group 
of a [Ta(CH2CHs)(CH2CMes)] 
species have not yet been addressed. 
(Y and P-H elimination 
from an ethyl 
ligand 
to generate 
a bridging 
ethylidene 
ligand and free ethylene, 
respec- 
tively, 
have been observed 
by Cree-Uchiyama 
and co-workers 
for a triosmi- 
um cluster 
[13]. Here it was shown that the rate of o-H elimination 
for this 
bridging 
system 
was approximately 
loo-fold 
greater than loss of olefin via 
0-H elimination. 
Further 
consideration 
of the alkyl derivatives 
of permethyltantalocene 
does place some limits on the difference 
in barriers 
for these two processes. 
A qualitative 
free energy profile 
for a and /3-H elimination 
from [Cp*,Ta- 
CH,CHs] is shown in Fig. 9. 
Here it is assumed 
that the barrier to o-H migratory 
insertion 
for the 
ethylidene 
hydride 
complex 
is comparable 
to that for Cp*,Ta(=CH2)H 
and 
Cp*(q’, $-C5Me4CH2CH&H=)TaH 
(ca. 16 kcal mol-l). 
The value of AGO 
is more 
difficult 
to estimate, 
since the ethylidene 
hydride 
is not observed. 
However, 
assuming 
this small kinetic 
barrier to [ Cp*,Ta(=CHCHs)H], 
then 
AGO must be greater 
than 3 kcal mol-‘, 
or else detectable 
concentrations 
would be present.

This inequality indicates that, for a general alkyl Egand iu the permethyl- 
tantalocene system, a-H elimination cannot be kinetically favored over 
0-H elimina~on by more than 2 kcal mol-’ 
(a factor of ca. 30 in rate at

dynamically favored over a-H elimination.

transfer experiments for exchange of Cp*2Ta(SC&)H

36 
kcal mol-’ at 100 “C, indistinguishable from the value obtained for Cp*,Ta- 
(CH,=CH,)H 
(AGS = 21.3(l) 
kcal mole1 at 100 “C). Although quantitative 
studies have not yet been carried out on Cp*,Ta(q2-OCH,)H, magnetization 
transfer is observed at cu. 60 “C, establishing an approximate barrier of 
19(l) 
kcal mol-‘. 
By contrast, magnetization transfer is not observed in 
the complex Cp*,Ta{n2-N(CHs)CH,}H 
up to 100 “C, so that the barrier for 
P-H migratory insertion must be greater than 22 kcal mol-‘. 
The factors 
responsible for these seemingly irregular variations in the rates of 0-H mi- 
gratory insertions (0 > S, CH2 > NCHs) are not understood at present. In 
particular, it is not yet established whether it is the ground states or transi- 
tion states (or both) which are primarily affected, since it is impossible to 
place the different complexes on a common energy surface. 
The activation free energies for the conversions of Cp*2Ta(~2-XCH2)H 
to Cp*,Ta(=X)CH3 
are: X = S, AG* = 31.8(l) 
kcal mol-i at 100 “C; X = 0, 
AG* = 34.9(2) 
kcal mol-’ 
at 140 “C; and X = NCHs, AGS = 35.4(l) 
kcal 
mol-’ 
at 144 “C. Unfortunately, the same complications which prevent a 
straightforward interpretation of the variations in rates of /3-H migratory 
insertions also complicate interpretation of these data. 
These data permit the construction of partial free energy surfaces for 
the processes given in eqn. 14; Fig. 10 illustrates this for X = S at 100 “C. 
Quantities which are undetermined are AGO for conversion of Cp*,Ta(q2- 
SCH2)H to Cp*,Ta(=S)CHs and the position of the unstable intermediate 
[Cp*,Ta-SCHs]. 
Nonetheless, the difference in the free energies of activa- 
tion for conversion of Cp*,Ta(q2-SCH2)H to Cp*2Ta(=S)CHs and for P-H 
migratory 
insertion 
of Cp*,Ta(SCH,)H

Similar surfaces for X = 0 and NCH3 reveal that /3-H elimination is favored 
over o-CHs elimination by ca. 16 kcal mol-i for [Cp*,Ta-OCHs] 
and by 
< cu. 13 kcal mol-’ 
for [Cp*zTa-N(CH3)2]. 
The factors responsible for 
faster migration of hydrogen, alluded to in the discussion of o-R (R = H, 
CHs) migratory insertion for Cp*~Ta(~CH~)R (vi& supra), are undoubtedly 
operative for these elimination processes as well. 
Lower limits may be placed on the barriers for (u-CH, migratory inser- 
tion for Cp*zTa(=X)CH,. 
Since AGO for the conversion of Cp**Ta(q2- 
XCH2)H to Cp*,Ta(=X)CHs must be greater than 3 kcal mol-I, AG$cY-CHs 
mig. ins.) must be >35 kcal mol-’ for X = S, >38 kcal mol-” for X = 0 and 
> 38 kcal mol-” for X = NCHs. These values are all su~~~~y 
larger than 
the barrier for ar-CHs migratory insertion for Cp*,Ta(=CH,)CH3, 
AG$ = 
31.3 kcal mol-I, probably reflecting greater ground state stabilization for 
Cp*,Ta( =X)CHs (X # CH,). 
In principle, the rates of o-H migration for Cp*,Ta(=X)H 
(X = 0, S) 
could be measured by obse~ation of ma~etization t~sfer/co~escence 
for 
the ‘H NMR resonances of the diastereotopic methyl groups of the (q’- 
CSMe4R) ligand for the complexes 
Cp*($-C,Me4R)Ta(=X)H. 
However, 
no coalescence or magnetization transfer was observed up to 120 “C for 
Cp*($-C+Me$H,CH&Hs)Ta(=X)H 
(X = 0, S), thus indicating that the 
barrier for o-H migratory insertion to Ta=O or Ta=S must be greater than 
23 kcal mol-’ . As with LY-CR3 
migratory insertions, CY-H 
migratory insertion 
to oxygen or sulfur is significantly slower than to methylidene; AGg(cr-

Conclusions 
The systems Cp*,Sc-R 
and (Cp*,Ta-XR] 
(R = H, alkyl; X = CH2, 
NCHs, 0, S) undergo a variety of migratory insertion and elimination reac- 
tions which are well suited to mechanistic study. For the permethylscan- 
docene system 8-H and p-alkyl migratory insertion and elimination pro- 
cesses occur readily. There is no evidence for Q! migratory insertion or 
elimination process, since the formal do scandium center is incapable of x 
bonding to the [:X] 
fragment generated by o-R elimination. By contrast, 
the d* tantalum center engages in strong multiple bonding to [ :X], and both 
(v- and P-R migratory insertion and elimination processes readily take place. 
Indeed, the very strong Ta-olefin 
bonding precludes the @lkyl 
migratory 
insertion processes so common for permethy~c~do~ene 
alkyls. The tremen- 
dous thermal stability exhibited by derivatives of permethyltantalocene has 
allowed a variety. of these rearrangements to be probed in some detail, and 
some general features have emerged: 
(i) a-H elimination is found to be generally very facile for [Cp**Ta- 
XH], and, rather unexpectedly, at-H 
elimination is found to compete effec- 
tively with P-H elimination. In the one system where both are observed 
33 
for the same alkyl, [ 
Cp*($, 
v’-C,Me&H2CH2CH2)Ta], 
o-u-H 
elimination is 
lo8 faster than P-H elimination. This system is biased against P-H elimination 
due to unfavorable strain so that, more generally, the barrier for o-H elimina- 
tion may be favored by no more than cu. 2 kcal mol-’ (a factor of C(I. 
30 
in rate) over ,&H 
elimination for a given (unstrained) tantalum alkyl. 
(ii) For the reverse processes, a-H migratory insertion for Cp*,Ta(= 
CH,)H is cu. lo3 faster than P-H migratory insertion for Cp*,Ta(CH2=CH,)H. 
Rather small, irregular variations in the rates of 0-H migratory insertion are 
observed for the series Cp*2Ta(n2-XCH2)H (X = CH,, NCH3, 0, S). 
(iii) Although o-H elimination may enjoy a kinetic advantage, P-H 
elimination invariably affords the thermodynamically 
more stable olefin 
hydride product (even for the strained system Cp*($, q*-C,Me&H2CH= 
CH,)TaH). The products of c&H, elimination for [Cp*,Ta-XCH3], 
Cp*,- 
Ta(=X)CH3, 
are more stable than the products of 0-H elimination, Cp*,- 
Ta(q*-XCH2)H, for X = NCH3, 0 and S. In contrast, for X = CH, the oppo- 
site is the case. 
(iv) The rate of hydrogen migratory insertion or elimination is invari- 
ably much faster (lo6 - 10’0) than the analogous processes for methyl. 
(v) The rates of a-H (lo* s-l at 50 “C) or a-CH, (10e8 s-i at 50 “C) 
migratory insertion to methylidene are significantly faster than a-H (too 
slow to be observed by dynamic NMR techniques) or a-CH, (< lo-” 
- lo-l3
