Sr2MgMoO6-d exhibits a lower ha compared to
Sr2MnMoO6-d. The dependence of ha on the
current density agrees well with that of the power
density in Fig. 2. In addition, in most of the cases
we observed, ha is lower than the corresponding
cathode overpotential, hc. Here, LSCM exhibits
a large ha in H2 and especially in H2/H2S, which
shows that SMMO gives a superior performance.
Because the LDC buffer layer is also an
MIEC that is catalytically active for fuel oxi-
dation, a cell with only the LDC layer as anode
and with Pt mesh and Pt paste as current
collector was tested. The values of Pmax were
528 and only 27 mW/cm2 in dry H2 and CH4,
respectively, much lower than those of a cell
with Sr2MgMoO6-d as anode. Furthermore,
EDS results for the Sr2MgMoO6-d/LDC/LSGM/
SCF cell after operating in H2, H2/H2S, and
CH4 for a total of 10 days showed no Pt in the
LDC layer. This result demonstrates that the
high performance of our cells with SMMO as
anode was not dominated by the LDC layer.
We further tried to use Au mesh and Au paste
as the current collector. A drop in Pmax oc-
curred because of Au melting and a possible
formation of Au-Mg alloy (21). In addition,
because the Sr2MgMoO6-d anode was poisoned
by the existence of Au, the activity in CH4 be-
came very poor, which could not be improved by
sputtering Pt on the anode surface. Instead, the
observation reinforces the conclusion that SMMO
plays an important catalytic role in oxidation of
CH4. We note that Pt paste is also catalytic for
CH4 oxidation. However, even without Pt paste,
the Sr2MgMoO6-d anode with buried Pt mesh
as current collector still showed a Pmax of 340
mW/cm2 at 800-C in dry CH4.
With a 300-mm-thick LSGM electrolyte and
SCF as the cathode, the double-perovskite an-
odes that we investigated show a high power den-
sity and a stable performance on power cycling.
Moreover, they exhibit an excellent tolerance to
sulfur. Sr2MgMoO6-d also shows a very high
power density in dry methane. Our results are
also applicable to YSZ as electrolyte. These
preliminary results indicate that optimization of
the chemistry and the morphology of these
double perovskites can provide an anode mate-
rial for a SOFC that operates on natural gas.

Catalytic Alkane Metathesis by
Tandem Alkane Dehydrogenation–
Olefin Metathesis
Alan S. Goldman,1* Amy H. Roy,2 Zheng Huang,2 Ritu Ahuja,1

With petroleum supplies dwindling, there is increasing interest in selective methods for
transforming other carbon feedstocks into hydrocarbons suitable for transportation fuel. We report
the development of highly productive, well-defined, tandem catalytic systems for the metathesis of
n-alkanes. Each system comprises one molecular catalyst (a ‘‘pincer’’-ligated iridium complex) that
effects alkane dehydrogenation and olefin hydrogenation, plus a second catalyst (molecular or
solid-phase) for olefin metathesis. The systems all show complete selectivity for linear (n-alkane)
product. We report one example that achieves selectivity with respect to the distribution of product
molecular weights, in which n-decane is the predominant high-molecular-weight product of the
metathesis of two moles of n-hexane.
T
he interconversion of alkanes via al-
kane metathesis is a reaction with
enormous potential applicability:
H3C<ðCH2Þn<CH3 þ H3C<ðCH2Þm<CH3 Y
H3C<ðCH2ÞmþnYx<CH3 þ H3C<ðCH2Þx<CH3
ð1Þ
Alkanes are the major constituents of petro-
leum. As oil reserves dwindle, the world will
increasingly rely on the Fischer-Tropsch pro-
cess (reductive oligomerization of CO and H2)
to produce liquid hydrocarbons—specifically n-
alkanes—from the vast reserves of coal, natural
gas, oil shale, and tar sands, or from biomass.
The energy content of U.S. coal reserves alone,
for example, is about 40 times that of U.S.
petroleum reserves and is comparable to that of
the entire world_s petroleum reserves (1).
Unfortunately, neither natural sources nor
Fischer-Tropsch production yield alkane mix-
tures with a tightly controlled molecular weight
(MW) distribution, which is important for varied
applications. For example, n-alkanes in the
range of ÈC9 to C20 constitute the ideal fuel
for a diesel engine (which runs È30% more
efficiently than a gasoline engine); the absence
of aromatic impurities results in cleaner burning
than that of conventional diesel fuel or even
gasoline (2, 3). n-Alkanes lower than ÈC9,
however, suffer from high volatility and lower
ignition quality (cetane number) (4). In addition
to F-T product mixtures, low–carbon number,
low-MW alkanes are also major constituents of
a variety of refinery and petrochemical streams.
In general, there is currently no practical
method for the interconversion of alkanes to
give products of higher MW; this challenge
provides extremely large-scale potential appli-
cations of alkane metathesis (Eq. 1). Addition-
ally, Eq. 1 might be applied to the formation of
low-MW products from high-MW reactants
(e.g., by reaction with ethane). Although hydro-
cracking is already a well-established process
for this purpose, Eq. 1 might offer an advan-

and/or less severe conditions.
We report two systems in which the metath-
esis of linear alkanes is achieved efficiently and
selectively at moderate temperatures via a tan-
dem combination of two independent catalysts,
one with activity for alkane dehydrogenation
and the other for olefin metathesis. In particular,
we exploit highly selective, soluble molecular
catalysts developed for each of these reactions,
as well as solid-phase olefin metathesis catalysts.
The basic tandem catalytic process is outlined
in Fig. 1 for metathesis of an alkane of carbon
number n (Cn) to give ethane and C(2n–2). A de-
hydrogenation catalyst, M, reacts with the alkane
to give the corresponding Cn terminal alkene and
MH2. Olefin metathesis of the 1-alkene gener-
ates ethylene and an internal C(2n–2) alkene. The
alkenes thus produced serve as hydrogen ac-
ceptors and generate the two new alkanes via
reaction with MH2, regenerating M and closing
the catalytic cycle.
To date, two heterogeneous catalyst systems
have been reported to effect the interconversion
of alkanes. Burnett and Hughes showed that
passage of butane over a mix of platinum on
alumina (a dehydrogenation catalyst) and tung-
sten oxide on silica (an olefin metathesis
catalyst) at high temperatures (399-C) results
in formation of lower and higher MW alkanes,
predominantly propane and pentane (24.7% and
15.9%, respectively, with 37.6% n-butane un-
reacted) (5, 6). In addition to linear saturated
hydrocarbons, small quantities of branched C4
and C5 alkanes, methane, and alkenes were also
formed. Supported Ta and W hydride catalysts
that function as alkane metathesis catalysts at
much lower temperatures were reported by
Basset (7–9), but product yields were low. For
example, a turnover number (mol of propane
transformed per mol of catalyst) of 60 and
conversion of 6% was observed for metathesis
of propane to give C1 to C6 alkanes with the
use of a supported Ta hydride species (120
hours, 150-C) (8). More recent work showed
that an alumina-supported tungsten hydride
species gave somewhat increased turnover
numbers (8). Basset has shown that these
systems operate via the reaction of metal
centers with alkanes to give metal-carbene
complexes (via a-H elimination) as well as free
olefins (via b-H elimination and b-alkyl trans-
fer) (10). Such pathways, unlike the one out-
lined in Fig. 1, are consistent with the reported
formation, from linear alkanes, of both branched
and linear products, as well as catalytic methane
production (7–10).
Our investigation was largely based on the
use of Ir-based pincer complexes, first re-
ported by Jensen and Kaska (11, 12) and ex-
plored extensively in our own laboratories
(13–17); specifically, complexes 1, 2a, and 2b
were used (Fig. 2). These systems exhibit high
stability, but their dehydrogenation activity is
inhibited by buildup of even moderate concen-
trations of alkene product. The dual catalytic
system (Fig. 1) would require only a very low
steady-state concentration of alkenes during
catalysis; thus, inhibition of catalysis by product
could be avoided. Numerous olefin metathesis
catalysts are available (18–20); we examined the
Schrock-type catalyst 3 (21, 22) after determining
that the widely used Grubbs-type catalysts (19)
react with and deactivate the iridium-based
dehydrogenation catalysts.
Initial experiments combining 3 with Ir-based
dehydrogenation catalysts in solution proved
successful. An n-hexane solution containing
10 mM dehydrogenation catalyst precursor
1-C2H4 (0.14 mol % relative to hexane) and
16 mM Schrock catalyst 3 was heated at 125-C
under argon in a sealed glass vessel for 24
hours. This process converted 135 equivalents
(relative to Ir) of n-hexane to a range of C2 to
C15 n-alkanes. No branched or cyclic alkanes
were detected. Products were monitored by gas
chromatography (GC) using mesitylene as an
internal standard. The product distribution was
concentrated in the C2 to C5 and C7 to C10 ranges
(Table 1, entry 1). Heating for longer times
resulted in few additional turnovers. However,
upon addition of more olefin metathesis catalyst
3, alkane metathesis was reinitiated, indicating
that decomposition of 3 is responsible for the
deactivation of the system under these con-
ditions. Using 1-H2 and two equivalents of t-
butylethylene (TBE) as a hydrogen acceptor,
along with catalyst 3, similar results were ob-
tained (Table 1, entry 2). EThe reaction of the
dihydride catalyst precursor 1-H2 with one
equivalent of TBE is presumed to generate the
catalytically active species (tBuPOCOP)Ir (1).
The use of two equivalents of TBE per mol of
1-H2 is expected to give results most compara-
ble to those obtained with 1-C2H4, because
1-C2H4 constitutes the same catalytically ac-
tive species plus 1 mol of olefin.^
Controls were conducted, including experi-
ments with (i) 1-C2H4 and no metathesis cata-
lyst; (ii) 2a-H2 and TBE, but with no metathesis
catalyst; and (iii) metathesis catalyst 3, but with
no iridium-based catalyst. In none of these cases
was any alkane metathesis observed after heating
the n-hexane solutions for 24 hours at 125-C.
Pincer-ligated iridium complexes have been
reported to dehydrogenate n-alkanes with high
kinetic selectivity for the formation of the
corresponding 1-alkene (15). Thus, the product
distributions indicated in entries 1 and 2 in
Table 1 presumably reflect a substantial degree
of olefin isomerization before olefin metathesis
under these conditions. For example, isomeri-
zation of 1-hexene to 2-hexene, followed by
cross-metathesis between 2-hexene and 1-hexene,
could give 1-pentene plus 2-heptene (Fig. 3)
(18–20). Alternatively, or in addition, 5-decene
(from the cross-metathesis of 2 mol of 1-hexene)
could be isomerized to give 4-decene; me-
tathesis with ethylene would then give 1-pentene
and 1-heptene. The pincer-iridium complexes
are well known to catalyze olefin isomeriza-
tion (15). Thus, terminal dehydrogenation of
n-hexane in tandem with olefin metathesis,
when coupled with rapid olefin isomerization,
can account for the C3 to C5 and C7 to C9 al-
kanes (Fig. 3).
Alkanes with carbon number greater than 10,
produced from hexane, must derive from olefin
metathesis of at least one alkene of Cn96. The
Cn96 alkene may result from dehydrogenation
of the corresponding n-alkane primary product,
or it may be obtained directly via cross-
metathesis of hexenes, before the resulting
olefin (e.g., 5-decene) is hydrogenated.
Consistent with the hypothesis that 1-alkenes
are the initial dehydrogenation products, under
certain conditions n-decane is the major heavy
(Cn96) product of n-hexane metathesis (the non-
degenerate cross-metathesis of 1-hexene can

only yield ethene and 5-decene). Combining
dehydrogenation catalyst 2a and metathesis
catalyst 3 (Table 1, entry 3) leads to this out-
come. (The formation of n-tetradecane presum-
ably results from the secondary metathesis
reaction of n-decane with n-hexane.) Presum-
ably, under the conditions of this reaction,
diphosphine-ligated 2a catalyzes isomerization
more slowly (or more slowly relative to hydro-
genation) than does the diphosphinite-ligated
species 1. This reaction was also monitored by
13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(NMR), a method that yields less precise results
than GC but facilitates continuous monitoring
in a sealed reaction vessel. The NMR results
were generally consistent with those obtained
by GC, and in particular they revealed that the
ratio of the major n-alkane products did not
considerably change with time.
Although it is difficult to precisely quantify
ethane production under our conditions, the
solution concentration for the first run in entry
3 was measured by GC as 128 mM. GC analysis
of the gas phase indicated the presence of 1.7
mmol of ethane; if this quantity were also in
solution, the total ethane concentration would
have been 131 mM. (Likewise, a small amount
of propane in the gas phase brings the effective
concentration from 175 mM to 176 mM.) The
average carbon number of all products was
found to be È6.0 (measured as 5.95), an in-
dication that no significant loss of lighter alkanes
had occurred (which would raise the observed
value above 6.0). The Beffective ethane concen-
tration[ of 131 mM is substantially lower than
the concentration of n-decane observed (232
mM). This discrepancy between ethane and n-
decane production is probably largely attribut-
able to secondary metathesis of the ethene
product with 2- or 3-hexenes (which would then
contribute to the formation of propene, butene,
and pentene). It is also worth noting in the con-
text of this experiment that only trace quantities
of methane were observed E0.5 mM effective
concentration, probably formed via decomposi-
tion of the expected molybdenum methylidene
intermediate (18–20)^. This result contrasts
sharply with the Basset systems, in which
methane is formed catalytically; this difference
is in accord with the key role played by a-H
elimination and b-alkyl elimination in the
Basset systems (7–10). The catalytic cycle in
the systems reported here does not involve
either of these elimination steps.
In addition to the alkane disproportionation
(self-metathesis) illustrated above, the catalyst
system may be used for alkane comproportiona-
tion (cross-metathesis)—that is, the production
of intermediate-MW alkanes from low-MW and
high-MW reactants. Table 2 shows the result of
treating a mixture of 4:1 (mol:mol) n-hexane and
the C20 alkane, n-eicosane, with catalysts 1
and 3.
Monitoring the reactions by NMR spectros-
copy affords insight into the resting state(s) of
the catalysts as well as the extent of alkane
metathesis. 31P and 1H NMR spectroscopy indi-
cates that some loss of catalyst 2a-H2 occurs
during the reaction of n-hexane solution. How-
ever, a substantial concentration of 2a-H2 re-
mains, even when the reaction is no longer
progressing. The olefin metathesis catalyst is less

easily monitored because its resting state depends
on the nature of the olefins present in solution;
the loss of the 2-methyl-2-phenylpropylidene
ligand and the expected formation of 2-methyl-
2-phenylbutane (resulting from hydrogenation
of 3-methyl-3-phenylbutene) are observed ear-
ly in the course of the reaction. However, the
appearance of free 2,6-diisopropylaniline is ob-
served to approximately coincide with the de-
creased reaction rate; thus, decomposition of 3
appears to be an important factor limiting turn-
over numbers in this case. This conclusion is in
accord with the experiments in which addition of
3 reinitiates catalytic activity.
In contrast to (tBuPCP)Ir-based 2a-H2, the
resting state of the (tBuPOCOP)Ir-based cata-
lysts (1) is the Ir(I)(alkene) complex. For exam-
ple, monitoring by 31P NMR spectroscopy of
n-hexane metathesis by 1-C2H4 and 3 indicates
that at early stages of the reaction (È150 min),
1-C2H4 is the major Ir resting state, with
1-(1-propene), 1-(1-butene), 1-(1-pentene),
1-(1-hexene), and 1-(internal-hexene) present
in small concentrations. However, at later
stages of the reaction (4 days), 1-(1-hexene)
is observed as the major iridium species in
solution. The resting state of the Ir species
appears to reflect the activity of the metathesis
catalyst. Because the metathesis catalyst decays
at the late stage of the reaction, ethylene is no
longer produced, although it continues to be
consumed as a hydrogen acceptor. As a result,
the dehydrogenation of hexane results in the
gradual conversion of 1-C2H4 to 1-(1-hexene).
Given the instability of the molybdenum al-
kylidene catalysts, we turned to investigation of the
supported Re metathesis catalyst Re2O7/Al2O3,
which exhibits greater stability at high temper-
atures (23). Reactions were conducted at 175-C
with n-decane as the solvent/substrate (Table 3)
(24). (Control experiments with Re2O7/Al2O3,
with no iridium catalyst present, gave no alkane
metathesis after 3 days at 175-C.) The (PCP)Ir
catalysts (2) proved more effective than the
(POCOP)Ir systems (1). In a typical experiment,
an n-decane (2.5 ml, 12.8 mmol) solution of
2b-H4 (12.8 mg, 0.0227 mmol), TBE (10 ml,
0.078 mmol), and hexamethylbenzene (10 mg,
internal standard) was heated over Re2O7/Al2O3
(535 mg, 3 wt % Re2O7) at 175-C under argon
and monitored by GC. After 3 hours, C2 to C28
alkanes were observed with total product
concentration estimated at 1.6 M (corresponding
to 180 mol of product per mol of Ir). Catalysis
slowed, but after 9 days, product concentrations
reached 4.4 M. Remarkably, at 9 days, the n-
decane starting material was comparable in
molar quantity to n-nonane and n-undecane
products, with measured C9:C10:C11 molar ratios
of 0.6:1:0.6 (Table 3 and Fig. 4).
Because decomposition of the olefin me-
tathesis catalysts appears to limit conversions,
we expect that more robust olefin metathesis
catalysts will yield higher turnover numbers in
future studies. We also expect that more active
dehydrogenation catalysts will give more turn-
overs before decomposition of the metathesis
catalyst, and that catalysts that are less prone to
isomerize the olefin intermediates will yield
greater selectivity for C(2n–2) products. The nature
of the tandem system permits the detailed in-
vestigation of the component catalysts individ-
ually, and the development of more suitable
catalysts for both dehydrogenation and olefin
metathesis (25) is under way.

High Natural Aerosol Loading over
Boreal Forests

Aerosols play a key role in the radiation balance of the atmosphere. Here, we present evidence that
the European boreal region is a substantial source of both aerosol mass and aerosol number. The
investigation supplies a straightforward relation between emissions of monoterpenes and gas-to-
particle formation over regions substantially lacking in anthropogenic aerosol sources. Our results
show that the forest provides an aerosol population of 1000 to 2000 particles of climatically active
sizes per cubic centimeter during the late spring to early fall period. This has important
implications for radiation budget estimates and relevancy for the evaluation of feedback loops
believed to determine our future climate.
T
he boreal forest plays an important role
in both climate regulation and carbon
cycling (1–3). Boreal forests represent
one-third of all forested land and cover 15
million square kilometers of land. The boreal
region is characterized by large seasonal vari-
ations in temperature, and the flora is domi-
nated by different pine and spruce species.
Most boreal forests contain few large sources of
anthropogenic pollution.
In the northern European boreal region,
long-term studies of aerosol formation and
transformation processes have been performed
at several measurement sites. One of the major
research aims of these studies, including those
performed at the Finnish background station
Hyyti.l. (4–7), has been to investigate the role
of particle formation. This is important because
homogeneous or ion-induced nucleation can
provide substantial numbers of aerosols in an
environment otherwise deficient of primary
sources contributing to the fine-particle mode.
This has clear relevance for understanding ra-
diation budgets. Similar issues have been ad-
dressed at other locations in northern Europe.
Particle-formation events over the boreal forest
are well-studied phenomena at stations located
in Finnish Lapland EPallas and V.rriP (8–10)^
and at the Scandinavian rim of the boreal re-
gion in Sweden EAspvreten (11)^. The mecha-
nisms responsible for the formation and growth
of these particles are still uncertain. Although
sulfuric acid is one of the most likely candi-
dates thought to be responsible for the forma-
tion of the initial nanometer-sized particles,
sulfur chemistry does not sustain enough sul-
furic acid in the atmosphere to explain more
than a small fraction of the observed particle-
size growth rate. To explain the observed growth,
which is up to a diameter of 50 to 100 nm, other
compounds are required (12).
Organic constituents comprise a large frac-
tion of the global aerosol burden (13, 14) and
there is growing evidence that naturally emitted
terpenes contribute notably to gas-to-particle
formation (15). In the boreal region of northern
Europe, monoterpenes are abundant at concen-
trations ranging from some tens of parts per
trillion up to parts per billion depending on
season, boundary layer conditions, and temper-
ature (16–18). When released into the atmo-
sphere, monoterpenes undergo oxidation by
ozone, hydroxyl radical, and nitrate radical to
yield numerous compounds, the most interest-
ing of which are oxygenated carbon compounds
such as mono- and dicarboxylic acids (19).
Similar compounds may contribute considera-
bly, either directly or through polymerization in
the particle phase (20), to the gas-to-particle
conversion rate over forested areas.
Here, we present evidence of substantial con-
tributions to the aerosol mass and abundance
from natural emissions of aerosol precursor
gases, most likely terpenes. The approach uti-
lizes a statistical method including long-term
observations of the submicrometer aerosol
number-size distribution at three different sta-
tions in the Finnish boreal zone. The three loca-
tions selected for this purpose are the station for
Measuring Forest Ecosystem-Atmosphere Rela-
tions (SMEAR I) located at V.rriP E67-46¶N,
29-35¶E, 390 m above sea level (asl)^, the
Pallas-Sodankyl. Global Atmospheric Watch
(GAW) station located close to Pallas (68-01¶N,
24-10¶E, 303 m asl), and the SMEAR II station
(Hyyti.l., 61-51¶N, 24-17¶E, 170 m asl). The
database used includes 5 years (1999 to 2004) of
aerosol number-size distribution data from the
stations. The study considers only the period
from April to September.
The current ambition is to investigate the
characteristic changes of the aerosol population
in air masses undergoing marine to continental
transition over forested areas in northern Nor-
way, Sweden, and Finland. Previous investiga-
tions (11, 21) have shown that substantial sources
affect the aerosol during this transition. How-
ever, these investigations only account for a
