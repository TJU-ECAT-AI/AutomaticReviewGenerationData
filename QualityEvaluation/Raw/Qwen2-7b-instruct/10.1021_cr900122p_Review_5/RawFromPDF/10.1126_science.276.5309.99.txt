Metathesis of Alkanes Catalyzed by 
Silica-Supported Transition Metal Hydrides 
Veronique Vidal, Albert Theolier, Jean Thivolle-Cazat, 
Jean-Marie Basset* 
The silica-supported transition metal hydrides (23-0-Siz)(=Si-0-),Ta-H and (Si-0-),M-H 
(M, chromium or tungsten) catalyze the metathesis reaction of linear or branched alkanes 
into the next higher and lower alkanes at moderate temperature (25" to 200°C). With 
(Si-0-Si=)(=Si-0-),Ta-H, ethane 
was transformed at room temperature into an equimolar 
mixture of propane and methane. 
Higher and lower homologs 
were obtained from propane, 
butane, and pentane 
as well as from branched alkanes such as isobutane and isopentane. 
The mechanism of the step leading to carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation likely 
involves a four-centered transition state between a tantalum-alkyl intermediate and a 
carbon-carbon a-bond of a second molecule of alkane. 
Paraffins, particularly methane and light 
alkanes, constitute an abundant yet low- 
value fossil feedstock. Light alkanes would 
c
z
 
be very valuable if they could be trans- 
formed into higher molecular weight hydro- 
carbons (1); this represents a continuing 
scientific challenge (2). Here, we report 
observations of a catalytic reaction that we 
designate "metathesis of alkanes" and 
which, to our knowledge, has not previously 
been reported (3). The metathesis reaction 
proceeds by both the cleavage and the for- 
mation of the C-C bonds of acyclic alkanes, 
which are transformed into a mixture of 
higher and lower homologs. It was observed 
in the presence of various silica-supported 
metal-hydride catalysts, particularly tanta- 
lum hydride (4), 
all prepared by the surface 
organometallic chemistry route (5, 
6). Met- 
athesis reactions of alkenes and alkynes, 
discovered a few decades ago, are now well 
" ,  
documented and understood and are used in 
several industrial chemical Drocesses. In 
contrast to the metathesis of alkenes (7) 
or 
alkynes (8), 
for which the cleavage of the 
molecule occurs selectively at the C==C

bond, the metathesis of acyclic al- 
kanes seems to involve, at least to some 
extent. the reaction of all C-C bonds. 
Thus, the reaction, even if it is selective in 
terms of the formation and cleavage of C-C 
bonds, is not restricted to the formation of 
the first higher and lower homologs but also 
can yield the next several higher and lower 
ones. The metathesis of acyclic olefins is 
hindered by thermodynamic limitations; 
such a reaction is close to thermoneutrality 
for most alkanes (9). 
We recently reported that the reaction of 
Ta(-CH,CMe,),(=CHCMe,) 
(Me, methyl) 
(1 
0) with the surface hydroxyl groups of a 
dehydroxylated silica (1 
I) leads to the for- 
mation of a mixture of two species: (Si-0-) 
Ta(-CH2CMe3),(=CHCMe,) (-65%) and 
(Si-0-),Ta(-CH2CMe3) 
(=CHCMe3) 
(-35%) (12). Treatment of these two sur- 
face complexes under hydrogen at 150°C 
overnight yields mainly a surface tantalum 
(111) monohydride, (=Si-o-Si~)(=Si-o-)~ 
Ta-H ([Ta],-H), which has been fully char- 
acterized by infrared spectroscopy, extended 
x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) 
analysis, microanalysis, and quantitative 
chemical reactions (4). 
When [Ta],-H was contacted at room 
temperature with a cyclic alkane (4, 13), 
no 
catalytic reaction occurred. Only a C-H

bond activation was observed, which led to 
the stoichiometric formation of a tantalum 
(111)-cycloalkyl species with the evolution 
of 1 mol of hydrogen. Tantalum is ex- 
tremely electrophilic, and thus we assume 
that this activation occurs by a a-bond 
metathesis 
[Ta],-H + (RH) + 
[Ta],-(R) + Hz (1) 
(where R = cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclo- 
heptyl, or cyclooctyl), rather than by an 
oxidative addition-reductive elimination 
pathway (13). When pa],-H was contacted 
with an acyclic 
alkane, a catalytic metathesis 
reaction occurred at moderate temperature 
(25" to 200°C), leading to the formation of 
the higher and lower homologs (Table 1). 
The simplest case is the metathesis of 
ethane. which has onlv one C 4  
bond and 
consequently does not present any problem 
of selectivity. This alkane yielded propane 
and methane in comparable amounts, as well 
as trace amounts of n-butane and isobutane 
(Fig. 1). In this example, it is clear that a 
methyl fragment is transferred from one mol- 
ecule of ethane to a second one. A labeling 
experiment carried out with l3C-monola- 
beled ethane yielded unlabeled, monola- 
beled, dilabeled, and trilabeled propane 
(5:44:43:8), which proved the cleavage of

tribution of the 13C 
atoms into the propane 
molecules. 
When higher linear alkanes were used, 
several higher and lower homologs were pro- 
duced, because various G H  
and C-C bonds 
can be involved. For example, metathesis of 
propane yielded mainly n-butane and isobu- 
tane together with ethane, and n-butane 
yielded n-pentane and isopentane as well as 
propane; besides these main products, some 
higher and lower alkanes were also produced 
(Fig. 2). This suggests, as observed for ethane, 
that the main reaction involves the transfer of 
a methyl fragment from one molecule of the 
initial alkane to a second one; the wider prod- 
uct distribution observed with higher alkanes 
(for example, butane and pentane) (Fig. 2) 
also suggests the probable occurrence of sec- 
ondary reactions, the possible transfer of high- 
er alkyl fragments such as ethyl, or both. The 
occurrence 
of the two processes can hardly be 
distinguished; secondary reactions can take 
place as the reaction proceeds and the con- 
version increases. (The two related processes

may possibly be distinguished by a kinetic 
study in a dynamic reactor with varying wn- 
tact time.) All the alkanes present in the 
medium can be presumed to wmpete for the 
adsorption. In the case of ethane, secondary 
reactions seem to occur verv soon with the 
appearance of butane and especially isobu- 
tane. the formation 
of which necessarilv arises 
from a secondary reaction of propane. 
Branched alkanes such as isobutane or methyl 
butane also underwent the metathesis reac- 
tion; however, neopentane only led to the 
stoichiometric formation of a surface tanta- 
lum-neopentyl species and did not react fur- 
ther, probably for steric reasons. 
During the metathesis reaction, infrared 
spectroscopy showed that the tantalum hy- 
dride disappeared and was transformed into 
a tantalum-alkvl intermediate. At 150°C. 
aging of the catalyst was observed, prevent- 
ing higher conversions. In a few exploratory 
experiments, it was observed that similar

silica-supported hydrides of tungsten or 
chromium (14) were also able to catalyze 
the alkane metathesis reaction (Table I ) ,  
whereas silica-supported hydrides of zirco- 
nium, hafnium, or aluminum (14) did not 
show any activity. To our knowledge, this 
alkane metathesis reaction is an unprece- 
dented catalytic reaction; it can be de- 
scribed by the general equation

C-H bond activation of alkanes (1 
7); oth- 
er four-centered intermediates have been 
proposed in the dehydropolymerization of 
silane compounds (18). In the case of 
ethane, this step of C-C bond formation 
and cleavage enables the liberation of pro- 
pane and the formation of a tantalum- 
methyl surface complex. The last step in 
the catalytic cycle must liberate methane 
and regenerate the active species, the tan- 
talum-ethyl surface complex; a new four- 
centered transition state is assumed in 
which a hydrogen is transferred from an 
ethane molecule to the methyl ligand 
(Scheme 1). 
Scheme 3. 
Scheme 4. 
Regarding the mechanism of the reaction 
(15) (Scheme I), we assume that in a first 
steo. a C-H bond of acvclic alkane (for ex- 
&
,
 
ample, ethane) is cleaved by a a-bond met- 
athesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum- 
alkyl (for example, ethyl) species; this ele- 
mentary step is indeed observed during the 
C-H bond activation of cycloalkanes on the 
[Ta],-H species, yielding the corresponding 
tantalum-cycloalkyl surface complexes (Eq. 
I), and occurs without modification of the 
oxidation state of the metal (4). 
The next step 
involves the transfer of a methyl group and 
necessarily implies the cleavage and the for- 
mation of C-C bonds. Among the known 
elementary steps, two possibilities can be con- 
sidered: (i) The oxidative addition of the 
ethane C-C bond (16) would yield the dim- 
ethyl(ethyl)tantalum(V) surface complex; re- 
ductive elimination of propane from this com- 
vlex could follow, with the concomitant re- 
iease of a tantallm-methyl species. (ii) A 
a-bond metathesis mechanism, which we ore- 
fer because of the highly electrophilic charac- 
ter of the silica-supported tantalum-alkyl spe- 
cies, would involve a four-centered transition 
state with the presence of an sp3 carbon in the 
middle of the metallocycle (Scheme 2). 
Such a mechanism is also operating in 
the case of higher alkanes. For example, the 
formation of n-butane and isobutane from 
propane is determined in the first step of 
C-H bond activation, which yields two spe- 
cies, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-iso- 
propyl surface complexes (Scheme 3). The 
subsequent transfer of a methyl group from 
a second propane molecule to these propyl 
intermediates enables the evolution of n- 
butane and isobutane as well as the forma- 
tion of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in 
turn will yield ethane. 
The metathesis of isobutane is particu- 
larly interesting with respect to the product 
distribution. In agreement with the pro- 
posed mechanism, the C-H bond activa- 
tion step can produce two tantalum-alkyl 
intermediates (Scheme 4). We can expect 
that the formation of the tantalum-tert- 
butyl species can be disfavored (relative to 
that of the other possible tantalum-isobutyl 
complex) for steric reasons; despite this, the 
production of neopentane resulting from 
the methyl transfer step on the tantalum- 
tert-butyl occurs in substantial amounts.

15. In the early stages of the discovery of the olefin 
metathesis reaction, the most simple mechanism 
envisaged was a pairwise mechanism in which 
both oefins would react on the metallic center to 
give a quasicyclobutane intermediate. This mech- 
anism was later refuted. The simple fact that met- 
athesis of ethane gives methane and propane indi- 
cates that the mechanism is nonpairwise, that is, 
the two alkanes do not play the same role in the 
mechanism.

Thermal Structure of Jupiter's Upper 
Atmosphere Derived from the Galileo Probe

Temperatures in Jupiter's atmosphere derived from Galileo Probe deceleration data 
increase from 109 kelvin at the 175-millibar level to 900 2 40 kelvin at 1 nanobar, 
consistent with Voyager remote sensing data. Wavelike oscillations are present at all 
levels. Vertical wavelengths are 10 to 25 kilometers in the deep isothermal layer, which 
extends from 12 to 0.003 millibars. Above the 0.003-millibar level, only 90- to 270- 
kilometer vertical wavelengths survive, suggesting dissipation of wave energy as the 
probable source of upper atmosphere heating. 
T h e  exospheric temperature of Jupiter's 
upper atmosphere as determined by Voyag- 
er solar occultation was 1100 2 200 K at 
1400 km above the 1 bar level (1 
). This is 
much hotter than expected based on Jupi- 
ter's remoteness from the sun (2). In subse- 
quent fly-by's, Voyager occultations found 
hot exospheres at the other giant planets 
(3-5), suggesting that common, non-solar 
mechanisms were acting to heat giant plan- 
et exospheres. Three mechanisms have 
been proposed: (i) heating by collisions of 
energetic particles with the neutral upper 
atmosphere (6), (ii) heating by dissipation 
of upward propagating gravity waves (7, 
8), 
and (iii) Joule heating by currents in the 
ionosphere (9). Further progress toward un- 
derstanding the heating mechanism(s) has 
been hampered by the lack of a well-char- 
acterized temperature profile (8). 
Early analysis of the Galileo probe entry 
data indicated a jovian exospheric temper- 
ature of 1350 K at 800 km altitude, essen- 
tially confirming the occultation result 
(1 
0). Long vertical wavelength oscillations 
in the temperature profile suggested gravity 
waves. This analysis assumed that the atmo- 
spheric composition did not vary with 
altitude, the heat shield ablation mass loss 
was defined by pre-encounter calculations, 
first-approximation 
aerodynamics, zero- 
readings (offsets) of the acceleration sensors 
on the most sensitive range were un- 
changed after pre-entry calibration, and a 
pressure at 1000 km of 2.2 nbar, equivalent 
to a threshold temperature of 1150 K. Here, 
we explore the effect of initial pressure,

The probe entered the atmosphere at the 
edge of a 5-pm hot spot (1 
1) in a near- 
easterly direction (that is, aligned with 
planetary rotation) at a relative velocity of 
47.4054 km/s along a descending flight path 
at an angle 8.4104' below horizontal (12). 
Data acquisition began at 1028 km, where 
the deduced nressure was - 
1 nanobar and 
the molecular mean free path was -0.5 km. 
This placed the probe deep in the rare gas 
or free-molecular flow regime. The transi- 
" 
tion from free-molecular to continuum flow 
was between -400 and 300 km altitude. 
Drag coefficients in rare gas and continuum 
flow regimes were determined within -1% 
u 
by ballistic range tests of scale models and 
by computational fluid dynamics analysis 
prior to encounter (1 
3). Probe deceleration 
was measured over a dynamic range of lo7 
by multi-range accelerometers (14), with 
uncertainties in sensor scale factor -0.01% 
and, in offset (zero reading), -1 count. 
Data obtained from two independent sen- 
sors agreed within -1 count. We have cor- 
rected the data for drift in the offset on the 
most sensitive ranee based on data taken 
" 
during a cruise (in-flight) mission simula- 
tion test in November 1992. The initial r, 
-I 
offset was increased by 5.7 counts, with 1 
count uncertainty. The resulting 17 x 
g correction is important near measurement 
threshold. 
During entry, the probe heat shield was 
ablated by radiative and convective heating 
from the shock-layer plasma, which calcu- 
lations indicate attained a temperature of 
-16,000 K near the 5 mb level (15). Sen- 
sors embedded in the heat shield measured 
the surface recession as a function of time, 
and were used to calculate changes in  robe 
" 
mass and frontal area as functions of time 
(16). About one-fourth of the probe mass 
(90.2 2 5.8 kg of carbon) was vaporized 
and/or spalled from the heat shield surface. 
Variations in  robe mass occurred in the 
late stages of the entry, between 150 km 
and 80 km altitude, but minor pyrolitic 
vapor loss occurred after that and was in- 
cluded in the nrobe mass model. The un- 
certainty in the mass loss, ?7%, left a for- 
mal uncertainty of 22.3% in the residual 
probe mass, and hence in the atmospheric 
density below -100 km altitude. A t  the 
start of descent, density calculated from 
pressure and temperature measurements 
agreed closely with the final density from 
the entry profile, demonstrating small den- 
sity uncertainty. 
The density of the atmosphere was de- 
rived from probe decelerations through 
Newton's second law and the defining 
equation for drag coefficient,

the measured probe decelerations. Altitudes 
above the start of descent were determined 
by integrating the vertical component of
