Preface
Selective catalytic oxidation ﬁnds extensive application
in the synthesis of chemical reaction intermediates and
environmental remediation. A symposium on ‘‘Selective
Catalytic Oxidation’’ was held to address the fundamental
and applied aspects of this timely and important technical
subject. The symposium took place as part of the 226th
American Chemical Society meeting in New York City,
NY, USA from September 7–11, 2003. The symposium
was generously supported by the American Society
Chemical
Society-Petroleum
Research
Fund,
ACS
Division
of
Colloid
and
Surface
Chemistry,
Shell
Education Foundation, Rohm & Haas, and Cepsa. The
organizers wish to thank the participants and sponsor for
making this a successful symposium. Some of the oral
presentations from this symposium on ‘‘Selective Catalytic
Oxidation’’ are contained in this special issue of Catalysis
Today.
