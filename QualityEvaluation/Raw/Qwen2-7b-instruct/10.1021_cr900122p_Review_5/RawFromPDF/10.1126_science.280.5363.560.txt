tions are expected, eventually approach-
ing on-off switching, once efforts are tak-
en to orientate the nanostructures.
The implications of the present work
on nanotechnology seem manyfold. The
present methods to construct zero-, one-,
and two-dimensional nanostructures sug-
gest controllable nanostructures in conju-
gated electronically conducting polymers.
P4VP is a semiconducting side-chain–
conjugated polymer. In this case, conduc-
tivity appears to proceed through a pro-
tonic mechanism (19); this mechanism is
not a serious limitation to the generality of
the concepts, which are based on a control
of the morphology. Chemically, P4VP
resembles in several ways main-chain–
conjugated polymers such as polyaniline,
poly(p-pyridine), poly(p-pyridine vinylene)
(20, 21), and possibly even polypyrrole.
These materials are inherently difficult to
process because of their rigidity. However,
in polyaniline, for example, methods have
been demonstrated to introduce processi-
bility by the use of amphiphilic dopants
(22) or amphiphilic oligomers capable of
molecular recognition with the polyani-
line chain (23). Such concepts easily pro-
vide the short length scale discussed
above.

Platinum Catalysts for the High-Yield Oxidation
of Methane to a Methanol Derivative
Roy A. Periana,* Douglas J. Taube, Scott Gamble,
Henry Taube, Takashi Satoh, Hiroshi Fujii
Platinum catalysts are reported for the direct, low-temperature, oxidative conversion of
methane to a methanol derivative at greater than 70 percent one-pass yield based on
methane. The catalysts are platinum complexes derived from the bidiazine ligand family
that are stable, active, and selective for the oxidation of a carbon-hydrogen bond of
methane to produce methyl esters. Mechanistic studies show that platinum(II) is the most
active oxidation state of platinum for reaction with methane, and are consistent with
reaction proceeding through carbon-hydrogen bond activation of methane to generate
a platinum-methyl intermediate that is oxidized to generate the methyl ester product.
More efficient methods for the oxidation
of low-value, light alkane feedstocks, such
as natural gas, to the corresponding alcohols
or other useful liquid products would accel-
erate the use of natural gas feedstocks as a
complement to petroleum. Current tech-
nologies for the conversion of natural gas to
liquid products proceed by generation of
carbon monoxide and hydrogen (syn-gas)
that is then converted to higher products
through
Fischer-Tropsch
chemistry
(1).
The initial formation of syn-gas in these
processes is energy intensive and proceeds
at high temperatures, typically 850°C. In
contrast, direct methods partially oxidize
the alkane molecule, functionalizing one
C–H bond, and in principle can proceed
more
efficiently
and
cost-effectively
through lower temperature routes.
Given the potential for high payoff, the
goal of direct, selective alkane oxidation
has been the focus of substantial effort since
the 1970s (2, 3). Despite these extensive
efforts, very few selective alkane oxidation
processes are known. Except in a few special
cases (4), the basic chemistry for the selec-
tive,
low-temperature,
direct,
oxidative
conversion of alkane C–H bonds to useful
functional groups in high one-pass yield (5)
has not yet been developed. Such develop-
ment is challenging, because alkane C–H
bonds are among the least reactive known
and the desired products of oxidation are
typically more reactive than the starting
alkanes and are consumed before recovery.
Consequently, only uneconomically low
one-pass yields can be obtained with direct
alkane oxidation chemistries available to-
day without prohibitively expensive separa-
tions and recycle.
We developed a catalytic system for the
direct, low-temperature, selective oxidation
of methane to generate an ester of metha-
nol in 72% one-pass yield at 81% selectivity
based on methane (5). Recently, we report-
ed the selective oxidation of methane to an
ester of methanol in ;43% one-pass yield
catalyzed by mercuric salts (6). We now
show that selected Pt complexes are more
effective catalysts for this reaction. These Pt
complexes are stable and selectively acti-
vate (7) and oxidize a C–H bond of meth-
ane at temperatures as low as 100°C to
generate a methyl ester product that is
chemically “protected” from overoxidation

Earlier (6), we noted that the inorganic
salts of Tl, Au, Pd, and Pt promoted oxida-
tion of methane in strong oxidizing acids
such as concentrated H2SO4. Only stoichi-
ometric oxidations were observed with Au
and Tl salts, because reoxidation of the
reduced forms of these salts is not possible
with suitable oxidants. Catalysis was ob-
served with the Pd and Pt salts, with Pt
being the more efficient. However, catalyst
life as well as reaction selectivities were
poor with these metal salts because of the
irreversible bulk-metal formation that oc-
curs with the use of noble metals. Control
studies show that the poor selectivity arises
because the bulk noble metals catalyze the
complete combustion of the desired prod-
ucts. This issue has been documented in the
Wacker system (8) as well as the Shilov Pt
system for alkane oxidation (3).
The best documented solution to mini-
mizing irreversible reduction of the group
VIII noble metals is the use of chloride
ligands to stabilize Pd(II) catalysts in the
Wacker process (8). Unfortunately, the ad-
dition of chloride as well as other well-
established methods to prevent metal ion
reduction, such as the use of heteropoly
acids, were not useful for our methane oxi-
dation system.
To address this issue, we focused our ef-
forts on the use of ligands that might stabilize
cationic Pt species in concentrated H2SO4 at
temperatures .100°C without inhibiting
C–H activation (7). The primary issues con-
sidered in catalyst design were the stability of
the ligand-Pt bond and the ligand itself in
the hot, strongly acidic and oxidizing envi-
ronment as well as the availability of open
coordination sites for C–H activation. In
view of the high kinetic lability of O-based
ligands and the known, poor oxidative and
thermal stability of P-based ligands, we fo-
cused our efforts on N-ligated complexes.
Initial reactions with simple, s-donor,
amine Pt complexes confirmed the validity
of this approach. cis- or trans-Pt(NH3)Cl2
was soluble and persisted in concentrated
H2SO4, decomposing at 180°C with a half-
life of ;15 min. During this time, this
material was an active catalyst [turnover
frequency (TOF; extrapolated to the begin-
ning of the reaction) 5 10–3 s–1 (9)] for the
oxidation of methane by concentrated
H2SO4 to generate methyl bisulfate at
.90% selectivity (10)

The short life of the catalyst in concen-
trated H2SO4 solutions resulted from the
expected irreversible protonation of the
NH3 ligands to generate insoluble PtCl2
and NH4HSO4 (Eq. 2). However, the sta-
bility of solutions of this simple di-ammine
complex in hot, concentrated, H2SO4 for
even a limited time illustrated the hoped-
for kinetic stability and oxidation activity
of N-ligated complexes in the reaction
environment.

To develop more stable catalysts, p-acidic,
chelating, N-based ligands were examined
with the expectation that p-acid ligands
could be expected to have both lower proton
affinity as well as higher affinity for Pt(II), a
p-donor metal, than s-donor ligands such as
NH3. Several Pt complexes were identified
that were less susceptible to both protolytic
ligand loss and irreversible reduction to Pt
metal while still facilitating methane oxida-
tion. Among the most effective catalysts is
dichloro(h-2-{2,29-bipyrimidyl})platinum(II)
[(bpym)PtCl2; 1]. Control experiments show
that a 50 mM solution of this material in
20% oleum, even after 200°C for 50 hours,
shows no evidence of ligand attack as mon-
itored by nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy. Even though some
free ligand (unbound to Pt) is observed, the
solution remained homogeneous, and no in-
soluble (PtCl2)n formation or decomposition
to Pt metal is observed (11). Chloride loss
was observed (as evidenced by HCl gas
formation), presumably generating mixtures
of the corresponding bis-bisulfate or mixed
bisulfate chloride Pt–bipyrimidine (bpym)
complex.
The reaction of methane (3400 kPa, 115
mmol) with 80 ml of 102% H2SO4 contain-
ing a 50 mM concentration of 1 at 220°C
for 2.5 hours resulted in ;90% methane
conversion and the formation of ;1 M
solutions of methyl bisulfate at 81% selec-
tivity (10, 12). Control experiments con-
firm that no significant methane oxidation
occurs without added catalyst. In separate
experiments, catalyst TOFs of 10–2 s–1,
volumetric productivities of 10–6 mol cm–3
s–1 and turnover numbers (9) of .500 (13)
have been demonstrated with this ligated Pt
catalyst system. Kinetic analyses of typical
reaction profiles and control experiments
on the oxidation of solutions of methyl
bisulfate show the rate constant for oxida-
tion of methane to be at least 100 times
greater than that for methyl bisulfate (14).
The solution remained active after reac-
tion with methane, and formation of Pt
black or other insoluble materials was not
observed (11). Analyses of the crude reac-
tion mixtures by 13C NMR from oxidation
of 13C-enriched methane confirmed that the
only liquid-phase carbon product is methyl
bisulfate (with some free methanol) and that
it was produced from the added methane
(Fig. 1). In contrast to the Hg(II) system (6),
methane sulfonic acid (CH3SO3H) is not
produced in the presence of excess SO3.
Greater than 95% of the C has been ac-
counted for, and the only observable C-
based side products are gas-phase CO2 and
trace levels of methyl chloride. In addition
to H2SO4, other strong acids, such as
CF3SO3H or HB(HSO4)4, can be used as
solvent and reactant for methane oxidation
to methyl esters catalyzed with 1 by using
oxidants other than SO3 or H2SO4.
The high stability of complex 1 to strong
acid and oxidizing conditions has been
traced to the high affinity of the bpym ligand
for Pt(II). Remarkably, unlike the simple
NH3 ligands that are irreversibly lost by pro-
tonation (Eq. 2) resulting in formation of
insoluble (PtCl2)n or Pt black, similar loss of
the bpym ligand from the Pt center is revers-
ible. Evidence for this reversibility is the
“self-assembling” characteristics of 1, where-
by treatment of insoluble (PtCl2)n with 1
equivalent (equiv.) of bpym (50 mM) in
concentrated H2SO4 at 150°C leads to com-
plete dissolution of (PtCl2)n and formation
of a homogeneous solution of 1. By compar-
ison, treatment of (PtCl2)n in hot, concen-
trated H2SO4 with .100 equiv. of NH3 does
not lead to Pt dissolution. The affinity of
bpym for Pt(II) is also sufficiently high so
that a solution of bpym (20 mM) in hot,
96% H2SO4 leads to the oxidative dissolu-
tion of Pt metal (added as Pt black) to
produce
a
homogeneous
solution
of
(bpym)Pt(HSO4)2 (Eq. 3). Control experi-

ments show that no such dissolution occurs
in the absence of the bpym ligand. These
experiments show the effectiveness of the
bpym ligand for maintaining the homogene-
ity of Pt cations in strong acids under strong-
ly oxidizing, high-temperature conditions.

A key characteristic of the methane oxida-
tion system described above is that the sys-
tem is catalytic in the Pt complex, and a
potentially practical scheme can be devel-
oped based on known, facile hydrolysis of
the methyl bisulfate and reoxidation of SO2
(Scheme 2). Other systems that catalyze the
oxidation of methane to methyl species (2,
3, 6) have been reported. However, except
for our earlier work (6), the highest yield of
methyl product (based on added methane)
claimed for any of the reported systems is
,3%. Additionally, none of the reported
systems use efficiently recyclable oxidants
or afford efficient catalysis in the expensive,
metal-based complexes.

The N-ligated Pt oxidation systems are
mechanistically related to our earlier system
based on Hg (6), as well as to the Shilov
aqueous Pt(II)/(IV) system (3, 15), in that
the same three key steps—C–H activation,
oxidation, and functionalization—are pro-
posed for the catalytic sequence (Fig. 2).
In the case of the C–H activation step,
the data are consistent with this step pro-
ceeding through the Pt(II) oxidation state
rather than bulk metal, homogeneous Pt(0)
or the Pt(IV) oxidation states. The pro-
posed C–H activation step can be conve-
niently monitored in isolation from the re-
maining two steps shown in Fig. 2 by car-
rying out the reaction of methane with 1 in
a nonoxidizing, deuterated acid solvent
such as CF3SO3D or in D2SO4 at tempera-
tures below 150°C (16). Under these con-
ditions, the rate of C–H activation can be
measured over a 30-min period by the rate
of H/D exchange between methane and the
solvent (17). The extent of H/D exchange
of gas-phase methane with time was mea-
sured by gas chromatography–mass spec-
troscopy (GC-MS). Extensive H/D ex-
change (5 to 10% of the gas-phase methane
at a TOF of ;10–2 s–1) was observed with
Pt(II) [added in the form of (bpym)PtSO4]
without net reduction or oxidation of the Pt
(18). However, replacement of Pt(II) with
Pt(IV) [added in the form of H2Pt(OH)6 or
(bpym)Pt(HSO4)4] or Pt(0) (added as Pt
black) led to no measurable H/D exchange
(19). Ruling out soluble Pt(0) is more dif-
ficult, because we did not examine the
chemistry of homogeneous Pt(0) species of
bpym. However, the observation that added
Pt(II) catalyzes H/D exchange without any
observable reduction to Pt(0) (18) would
tend to rule out this possibility.
An interesting question is whether the
C–H activation reaction by (bpym)PtCl2 in
H2SO4 occurs by an oxidative addition
mechanism (to generate a methyl hydrido
Pt intermediate that loses a proton) or by
electrophilic substitution (via a metal-
methane complex that loses a proton) as
was proposed for the Hg(II) system (6, 20).
Recent work by Bercaw and Labinger (15)
on the Shilov system (2, 3) showed that
C–H activation by oxidative addition with
Pt(II) complexes must be considered. We
do not have sufficient data to differentiate
between these closely related possibilities.
However, whatever the exact molecular de-
tails of the reaction, we believe that the
process is electrophilic in character and oc-
curs with the cationic, highly electrophilic,
coordinatively unsaturated, 14-electron, T-
shaped complex (Fig. 2). This belief is based
on the observation that although H/D ex-
change can be observed with gas-phase
methane, no H/D exchange could be ob-
served with the methyl C–H bonds of per-
protio methyl bisulfate when a D2SO4 solu-
tion of methyl bisulfate was treated with 1
(21). Although alternative explanations
can be advanced, such as increased steric
hindrance with methyl bisulfate, we prefer
the explanation that the electron-with-
drawing bisulfate group inhibits electro-
philic reaction between the metal complex
and the C–H bonds of methyl bisulfate
relative to those of methane. Similar expla-
nations are advanced for the retarding ef-
fect of the nitro group on the rate of elec-
trophilic substitution of nitrobenzene rela-
tive to benzene. The mechanism of this
reaction deserves more detailed consider-
ation, because factors that control reactivity
of C–H bonds in C–H activation systems
could lead to greater control of reaction
selectivity.
As in the Hg(II) system (6), the oxida-
tion step is rate-determining in the catalytic
sequence. As noted above, H/D exchange
can be observed below 150°C without for-
mation of CH3OSO3H occurring at an ob-
servable rate when methane is treated with
D2SO4 containing 1 in a 30-min period.
This observation shows that the C–H acti-
vation step must be faster than either the
oxidation step or the functionalization step,
or both. As a model of the oxidation step,
treatment of 1 with H2SO4 is observed to
result in oxidation to Pt(IV) (Eq. 4) at
appreciable
rates
only
at
temperatures
above 150°C.
(bpym)PtIICl2 1 3 H2SO4 3
(bpym)PtIVCl2(HSO4)2 1 SO2 1 2 H2O
(4)
To examine the feasibility of the functional-
ization step, as well as to establish the rela-
tive rates of the steps, we carried out the
reaction with methane below 150°C (where
only C–H activation occurs) in the presence
of both 1 and Pt(IV) [added as H2Pt(OH)6].
Under these conditions, in addition to H/D
exchange with methane, quantitative forma-
tion of methyl bisulfate [relative to added
Pt(IV)] was observed. These results are con-
sistent with C–H activation and functional-
ization steps occurring faster than the oxida-
tion step. Consistent with the proposal that
the oxidation step is the rate-determining
step, Pt(II) complexes that have been shown
to undergo faster oxidation to Pt(IV) also
catalyze faster methyl bisulfate formation
from methane. Thus, the (NH3)2PtCl2 com-
plex, which has been shown to be oxidized
much more rapidly to Pt(IV) species than is
the (bpym)PtCl2 complex, also catalyzes the
oxidization of methane to methyl bisulfate at
a faster rate (albeit with a shorter lifetime;
see below). Similarly, 1 is more rapidly oxi-
dized to Pt(IV) than is (bpym)PtSO4 and
likewise catalyzes the oxidation of methane

to methyl bisulfate at a faster rate.
Unlike the Hg(II) system reported earli-
er (6), a key intermediate in the reaction
mechanism, the proposed PtII-CH3 species
(2) obtained from the C–H activation step,
was not observed in the crude reaction mix-
tures. We believe that the PtII-CH3 species
has a substantially lower acid stability
compared
to
methyl
mercury
bisulfate
(CH3HgOSO3H).
The
methyl
mercury
compound was shown to be stable in 96%
H2SO4 for days at room temperature (it
eventually decomposes to form methyl
bisulfate and methane) and could be quan-
titatively generated by treatment of methyl
mercury hydroxide and H2SO4 at room
temperature (6). However, treatment of
synthesized (bpym)Pt(CH3)(Cl) with con-
centrated H2SO4 at room temperature led
to rapid evolution of methane with the
stoichiometry shown in Eq. 5.
(bpym)PtCl(CH3) 1 H2SO4 3
(bpym)PtCl(HSO4) 1 CH4
(5)
Fortunately, decomposition to methane was
sufficiently slow at room temperature to en-
able a transient methyl Pt species to be
observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy, showing
that a CH3-Pt species in H2SO4 is a plausible
intermediate. However, at typical reaction
temperatures for methane oxidation (180° to
220°C), loss of methane from synthesized
(bpym)Pt(CH3)(Cl)
was
immediate
and
complete upon addition to H2SO4. The pri-
mary product was methane (.95%), but
methyl bisulfate [;1 to 5% yield based on
added (bpym)Pt(CH3)(Cl)] was also pro-
duced. These observations are consistent
with the lack of observable CH3-Pt species,
because only a very low steady-state level of
such species would be expected during catal-
ysis. The formation of low levels of methyl
bisulfate also provides evidence for the con-
version of 2 to product, as proposed in the
functionalization step (Fig. 2). As expected
on the basis of our experiments with added
Pt(IV), the addition of 2 to solutions of
H2SO4 containing Pt(IV) [as H2Pt(OH)6]
led to increased methyl bisulfate production
[relative to H2SO4 solutions not containing
added Pt(IV)] along with methane. This re-
sult is consistent with Shilov’s (3) and Ber-
caw and Labinger’s (15) proposal that Pt(IV)
can be an oxidant for conversion of a CH3-
Pt species into product.
Another important piece of evidence in
support of the methyl Pt intermediate, 2, as
a key intermediate is the observation of
multiple D incorporation into the methane
produced upon reaction of a synthesized
sample of (bpym)Pt(CH3)(Cl) with D2SO4
at room temperature. Similar observations
of multiple D incorporation into gas-phase
methane as well as the solution-phase
methyl bisulfate product are made when the
reaction of methane is examined using so-
lutions of 1 in D2SO4. A key observation in
this case is that the extent of D incorpora-
tion into the product methyl bisulfate is
several times higher than into the gas-phase
methane even though (21) no H/D ex-
change is observed when methyl bisulfate
alone is treated with a D2SO4 solution of 1.
These results strongly suggest, as shown in
Fig. 3, that a single C–H activation can lead
to multiple H/D exchange, possibly via a
methane complex (3) before methane loss
or oxidation of the methyl Pt to methyl
bisulfate occurs (20, 22).
A key role of the bpym ligand is main-
taining the solubility of the Pt(II) species.
This, coupled with the observations that
simple, nonligated Pt salts also catalyze
methane oxidation (albeit at significantly
lower selectivities and rates) and that the
bpym ligand can be reversibly lost [see
above; (11)], raises the important question of
whether the bpym ligand is attached to the
Pt center in the transition state for C–H
activation. This is useful information, be-
cause the presence of the ligand in the tran-
sition state for C–H activation could enable
the selectivity of the C–H activation reac-
tion to be controlled. More detailed experi-
ments are required to completely address this
point, but initial competition experiments,
which show that the relative rates of H/D
exchange between D2SO4 solvent and the
methyl C–H bonds of two co-dissolved sub-
strates (methane and ethyl phosphonic acid)
are dependent on the identity of the ligand
on the Pt(II) catalyst, strongly suggest that
the bpym ligand is attached to the metal
during C–H activation.

10. The data we report were obtained from the following
typical experimental procedures. All data has been
shown to be reproducible with an error of ;5%. The
oxidation of methane was conducted in a 300-ml
high-pressure, stirred autoclave from Autoclave En-
gineers. The reactor was modified so that all the
internal parts were either glass-lined or made from
tantalum. The reactor was equipped with baffles, a
hollow shaft/impeller, and was stirred at 1500 rpm to
insure thorough gas-liquid mixing during the reac-
tion. The reactor was loaded with the Pt catalyst
(typically 20 to 50 mM) along with 80 to 120 ml
H2SO4 (at desired concentration), and the system
was degassed with N. The reactor was heated to the
desired reaction temperature (typically between
180° and 220°C), and a mixture of 97% methane
and 3% neon was added to a total pressure of 500
psig. The methane/neon feed was added to the re-
actor from a known-volume reservoir in which the
temperature and pressure of the gas was measured
before and after addition so that the total moles of
methane/neon added to the reactor could be accu-
rately determined. The reaction was typically allowed
to proceed for 1 to 3 hours. Cooling to near room
temperature with an external, water-cooled line
stopped the reaction, and the gas phase was vented
into a 20-liter pressure vessel. After allowing several
hours for thorough gas mixing, the vented gas was
analyzed with a Hewlett-Packard 5880 GC equipped
with a Hayesep D column and a thermal conductivity
detector. The molar composition in the vented gas
(primarily CH4, CO2, SO2, and CH3Cl) was deter-
mined on the basis of the reference neon internal
standard; molar ratios of the gases; and the temper-
ature, pressures, and volume of the vented gas. The
liquid phase remaining in the 300-ml high-pressure
reactor was analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR and high-
pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses.
For NMR analysis, a known amount of acetic acid
was added to an aliquot of the reaction solution as an
internal standard. Methyl bisulfate (and any free
methanol) was determined from the ratio of the 1H
NMR methyl resonances of methyl bisulfate (3.4
ppm) to acetic acid (2.02 ppm). The methyl products
were also quantified by HPLC analysis of the liquid
phase. Known volume aliquots of reaction solution
were first hydrolyzed by the addition of three parts
water to one part crude reaction solution and heated
to 90°C for 4 hours in a sealed vial. The hydrolyzed
solution was analyzed with a Hewlett-Packard 1050
HPLC equipped with an HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad)
and a refractive index detector. The eluent was 0.1
volume % H2SO4 in water. Methanol eluted at 16.2
min. The gas phase (CH4, CO2 and CH3Cl) and liquid
phase (CH3OSO3H and CH3OH) analyses allowed
.90 to 95% mass balance on methane.
11. Oxidation of the Pt(II) center to Pt(IV ) occurs as evi-
denced by changes in the solution NMR spectra.
Free ligand is generated, but no reaction at the C–H
bonds is observed.
12. Calculated volumetric productivity based on the liq-
uid phase for this reaction is ;10–7 mol ml–1 s–1;
Catalyst turnover number (;20) and catalyst TOF
(;10–3 s–1) were values obtained over the integrated
reaction time.
13. The catalyst was still active after 500 turnovers. The
reaction was stopped at this point. The actual num-
ber of turnovers before the regeneration would be
required has not been determined.
14. The exact value depends on the value for the solu-
bility of methane in H2SO4 used in the calculations.

18. The lack of any redox change in the Pt center is
evidenced by the stability of the (bpym)PtX2 com-
plex, absence of reduced Pt, lack of methyl bisulfate
or overoxidation products such as CO2, and lack of
reduction products such as SO2.
19. If H/D exchange is occurring with these oxidation
states the rates must be at least three orders of

complexes are now generally accepted intermedi-
ates in C–H activation reactions. To date, extensive
indirect data have been obtained to support the in-
termediacy of such species. However, none have
been isolated and characterized.
21. No H/D exchange is observed between D2SO4 and
the methyl C–H bonds of methyl bisulate when a
solution of CH3OSO3H (0.2 M) containing 50 mM
(bpym)PtCl2 is heated to 220°C for 2 hours. Howev-
er, a slow rate of oxidation of methyl bisulfate to CO2
is observed and can be considered to be a limiting
rate of H/D exchange of methyl bisulfate (if we as-
sume that all C–H activation events of methyl bisul-
fate lead to rapid CO2 formation). In this case, we can
estimate that the rate C–H activation of methane is at
least 100 times greater than that of methyl bisulfate
(13). No methane formation is observed in these
reactions indicating that the oxidation of methane to
methyl bisulfate occurs irreversible as expected.

who proposed a carbene-hydride intermediate to

The Lost Colony and Jamestown Droughts
David W. Stahle,* Malcolm K. Cleaveland, Dennis B. Blanton,

Tree-ring data from Virginia indicate that the Lost Colony of Roanoke Island disappeared
during the most extreme drought in 800 years (1587–1589) and that the alarming mortality
and the near abandonment of Jamestown Colony occurred during the driest 7-year
episode in 770 years (1606–1612). These extraordinary droughts can now be implicated
in the fate of the Lost Colony and in the appalling death rate during the early occupations
at Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in America.
The network of moisture-sensitive tree-
ring chronologies now available for the
United States has recently been used to
reconstruct summer drought and wetness on
a continent-wide basis from 1700 to 1978
A.D. (1). Much longer chronologies are
available for some areas, including a net-
work of 800-year-long baldcypress (Taxo-
dium distichum) chronologies for the south-
eastern United States. These exactly dated
tree-ring proxies of growing-season climate
can provide unique information on envi-
ronmental conditions during the early co-
lonial history of the eastern United States.
Here, we use two long baldcypress chronol-
ogies to reconstruct the Palmer hydrological
drought index (PHDI) (2) for the Tide-
water region of southeastern Virginia and
northeastern North Carolina (Fig. 1) and
show that extreme drought afflicted the
first English attempts to colonize the New
World at Roanoke and Jamestown Island.
Centuries-old baldcypress trees survive
locally along the Blackwater and Nottoway
rivers in southeastern Virginia (Fig. 1), and
exactly dated tree-ring chronologies were
developed nondestructively for each loca-
tion (3). Both chronologies are directly cor-
related with precipitation and are inversely
correlated with temperature during the
growing season (April to July), in spite of
the frequently flooded riparian habitat of
the sample trees (4). A regional baldcypress
tree-ring chronology was computed as the
arithmetic mean of the Blackwater and
Nottoway rivers’ chronologies for the com-
mon period 1185 to 1984 A.D. (variance
trend due to low sample size in the early
years was removed). The regional chronol-
ogy is well replicated (.26 cores from 12
trees after 1225, and 62 cores at 1600) and
was used to reconstruct regionally averaged
July PHDI for the Tidewater and eastern
Piedmont climatic divisions of Virginia and
the northern and central coastal plain divi-
sions of North Carolina (5). This large
homogeneous climatic province includes
Jamestown, Roanoke Island, and most of
the drainage basins of the Blackwater and
Nottoway rivers. The PHDI is closely re-
lated to the Palmer drought severity index,
and both are used by the National Weath-
er Service to monitor drought and wetness
conditions across the United States (6).
The July PHDI integrates the effects of
spring and summer precipitation and tem-
perature anomalies on the soil water bal-
ance (2) and is an excellent measure of
