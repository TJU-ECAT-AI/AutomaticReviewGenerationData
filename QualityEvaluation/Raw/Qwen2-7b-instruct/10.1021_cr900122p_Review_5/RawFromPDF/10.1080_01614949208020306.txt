I. INTRODUCTION 
Much attention has been paid to the transformation of lower alkanes such 
as propane and butanes into aromatic hydrocarbons from both industrial and 
academic points of view. The aromatic hydrocarbons can be utilized as a booster 
for high octane number gasoline and are fundamental raw chemicals in petroleum 
chemistry. The activation of lower alkanes is an intriguing subject. In early work, 
Csicsery [ 
1-51 described dehydrocyclodimerization of lower alkanes over bi- 
functional catalysts such as platinum on alumina and Cr203 
on alumina. 
ZSM-5 zeolites in the H-form are active catalysts for the production of 
aromatics from lower alkenes and alkanes. The M-2 forming process of Mobil 
uses H-ZSM-5 for converting light hydrocarbons into aromatics [6]. Formation 
of aromatics is accompanied by the production of light alkanes, since aromati- 
zation takes place simultaneously with cracking and hydrogen-transfer reactions 
[7, 81. Thus, the internal redistribution of H-atoms severely restricts the maximum 
yield of aromatic hydrocarbons. 
A dehydrogenation function enhances the formation of alkenes from starting 
alkanes. For example, the introduction of platinum into H-ZSM-5 zeolites con- 
siderably increases activity for the aromatization of propane [9-111. However, 
this positive action of platinum is accompanied by the production of methane and 
ethane through hydrogenolysis of alkanes and of alkylaromatics. This again limits 
the selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons. 
The selectivity for aromatics is considerably improved by using modified 
ZSM-5 containing zinc or gallium. In this case, some of hydrogen lost during

aromatization appears in the product as molecular hydrogen [12]. The Cyclar 
process, developed jointly by UOP and BP, is used as a means of converting 
propane and butanes to aromatics and hydrogen [13, 141 and appears to be based 
on the use of zeolites containing gallium and/or zinc. 
This review is concerned with the aromatization of light hydrocarbons (C2- 
C,) into aromatic hydrocarbons over ZSM-5 zeolites containing Ga or Zn. The 
general features of the aromatization have been described also by Scurrell [15], 
and an excellent review on this topic has been published by Seddon, who described 
particularly early patents, the thermodynamics, and catalyst performance such as 
catalyst life [16]. The present review places special emphasis on the reaction 
mechanism, the role of these metal cations, and the mode of the activation of 
starting alkanes. 
Firstly, the characteristics of the conversions of various alkenes, together 
with those of alkanes and methanol, over modified zeolites are described. Alkane 
conversions over H-ZSM-5 are also described in order to discuss the role of the 
metal cations in the aromatization by comparing the reaction pathways over Ga- 
and Zn-ZSM-5 with those over H-ZSM-5. Most of the data are the author’s own 
results, simply because the conversion data are available over both H-ZSM-5 and 
Zn (or Ga)-ZSM-5 with the same Si02/A1203 
ratio, under the same reaction 
conditions. Secondly, the various methods of the catalyst preparation and the 
acidic properties of the catalysts are described. Finally, the mechanism of the 
activation of alkanes over the modified catalysts is discussed. 
11. ETHANE CONVERSION 
The transformation of ethane into aromatic hydrocarbons over Pt/H-gallo- 
silicate was reported by Inui and co-workers. A 41.5% selectivity for aromatics 
at the conversion of 14.0% was observed at 773 K [17, 181. Inui et al. also

carried out methane conversion over Pt/H-gallosilicate. A methane conversion of 
4.2% was obtained at 973 K [ 
181. 
Minachev et al. reported that a Ga-containing pentasil zeolite gave a 46% 
conversion of ethane, with a selectivity of 65% at 873 K [19]. Ono and co- 
workers also studied ethane conversion 1201. Figure 1 shows the product distri- 
bution from the reaction of ethane over H-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM-5, and Zn-ZSM-5 
under 20 kPa ethane pressure at 873 K after 1 h of time on stream. Over H-ZSM- 
5 ,  conversion is only 2%; the only product is ethylene, and no aromatic hydro- 
carbons are formed. On incorporating Ga or Zn cations into ZSM-5, the conversion 
increases and aromatics are formed. Over Zn-ZSM-5, total conversion of ethane 
is 52%, and the yields of ethylene and aromatics are 10% and 31%, respectively. 
These results indicate that the metal cations greatly enhance the activation of 
ethane. 
A typical distribution of the aromatics is given in Table 1, where the catalyst 
used is ZSM-5 containing 2 wt% Zn together with 1 
wt% Pd [20]. The predominant 
aromatic products are benzene and toluene, naphthalene also being formed in 
appreciable amounts. 
Figure 2 shows how total conversion and yields of ethylene and aromatics 
change with contact time [20]. At low conversion, ethylene is the main product; 
its yield goes through a maximum and decreases with increasing contact time. 
The yield of aromatic hydrocarbons increases monotonously with contact time. 
These results indicate that the first step of the aromatization is the dehydrogenation 
of ethane by the zinc or gallium species. 
The dehydrogenation activity of the metal cations has been confirmed by 
examining the effect of the degree of cation exchange of H-ZSM-5 with zinc 
cations [20]. The reaction was carried out at a low contact time, where the main 
product was ethylene. As shown in Fig. 3, the yield of ethylene increases with 
increasing degree of cation exchange, clearly indicating that the zinc species is

involved in dehydrogenating ethane. Over acidic sites, ethylene thus formed may 
be oligomerized to higher molecular weight alkenes, which may in turn be de- 
hydrogenated to aromatics. 
As shown in Fig. 4, ethane can be aromatized also by a physical mixture 
of ZnO and H-ZSM-5 [20]. On the other hand, dehydrogenation to ethylene does 
not proceed over a physical mixture of ZnO and Na-borosilicate (a nonacidic 
material). This shows that ZnO itself is not active for dehydrogenating ethane, 
and that the coexistence of protonic sites is essential. Actually, the yield of

PROPANE CONVERSION 
A. Over H-ZSM-5 
The reaction of propane over H-ZSM-5 becomes significant above 700 
K [21]. The product distribution at 823 K is given in Table 2, together with 
distribution over Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga-ZSM-5 [22]. Over H-ZSM-5, the selectivity 
for aromatics was 30% at conversion of 56.3%. Benzene, toluene, and xylenes 
account for most of the aromatics produced. Methane and ethane are the other 
major products. Figure 5 shows the yield of each hydrocarbon as a function of 
percentage conversion of propane [2 
I]. The behavior of each hydrocarbon product 
gives important clues to the reaction pathway [21]. 
1. Methane 
At low conversion of propane, the main products are methane and ethylene. 
Thus, at a conversion of 5%. the product consists of CH4 (91), CZHJ 
(67), CzH6 
(13), C3H6 (9). and small amounts of hydrocarbons with four or five carbon 
atoms. The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of moles of each product 
formed per 100 moles of converted propane. This shows that the main reaction 
at the first stage is the decomposition of propane into methane and CzH5 
+ through 
the attack of a proton on the C-C 
bond of propane, rather than on the C
-
H
 
bond. The intermediacy of pentacoordinated carbonium-ion intermediates in cat- 
alytic cracking was pointed out by Haag and Dessau [23].

The yield of methane, however, does not increase proportionally with the 
increase in the propane conversion, and apparently methane formation halts at 
high conversion. This suggests that the mode of activation of propane changes 
as the reaction proceeds. Thus, at a later stage, propane is activated plausibly 
through the abstraction of hydride ions by carbenium ions (R+).

The dimethyl carbenium ions formed may give propylene or react with alkenes 
to form larger carbenium ions. 
2. Ethane and Aromatics 
The fractions of both ethane and aromatics in the products increase pro- 
gressively with the conversion of propane. This indicates that ethane and aromatics

are not primary products but are formed from common intermediates. Thus, the 
main source of ethane may be the cracking of larger molecules, which are being 
converted also into aromatics. 
3 .  Lower Alkenes 
The lower alkenes and the hydrocarbons with four or five carbon atoms are 
intermediate products, since their yields decrease at higher conversion. Lower al- 
kenes may oligomerize to give higher hydrocarbons, which may be cracked to form 
(or reproduce) ethane and propane, or be transformed into aromatic hydrocarbons. 
The main reactions of propane transformation may be summarized as shown 
in Scheme 1 .  Thus, propane gives ethylene and propylene, which oligomerize in 
the zeolite cavities. The oligomerized products give either aromatics by dehydro- 
genation (Path A) or smaller molecules by cracking (Path B). The main final prod- 
ucts from propane are thus aromatics 
and smaller 
alkanes, that is, methane and ethane. 
B .  Over Ga-ZSM-5 and Zn-ZSM-5 
Propane has been most extensively studied of the lower alkanes. The first 
academic paper in alkane aromatization by Mole et al. reported propane conver-

sion over Zn-ZSM-5 171. The catalyst gave a 63% selectivity at 35% propane 
conversion at 773 K. A mechanism for the activation of propane was proposed 
and this is discussed later. 
Typical results of propane conversion over Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga-ZSM-5 at 
773 K are summarized in Table 2, together with those over H-ZSM-5 121 
J. In 
contrast to ethane conversion, Ga-ZSM-5 is more effective than Zn-ZSM-5 for 
propane aromatization, and H-ZSM-5 is also active for propane conversion though 
the selectivity for aromatics is lower. On incorporation of gallium, both the total 
conversion and the selectivity for aromatics are enhanced. The yield of and the 
selectivity for aromatics reach 61.7% and 72.2%, respectively, over Ga-ZSM-5. 
Figure 6 shows yields of hydrocarbon products as a function of the percentage 
conversion of propane. The yields of aromatic hydrocarbons increase almost 
proportionally with propane conversion, indicating that intermediate species such 
as light alkenes are very efficiently transformed into aromatics over Ga-ZSM-5 
(Path B of Scheme 1 ) .  In contrast to the reaction over H-ZSM-5 (Fig. 9, 
the 
yield of ethane is small even at high conversion. This also implies that the 
intermediate alkenes are effectively converted into aromatics before they can be 
cracked to ethane and other small molecules. In other words, gallium cations 
serve as dehydrogenation sites for intermediate alkanes. 
Gnep et al. also studied the product distribution as a function of propane 
conversion over Ga-ZSM-5, and concluded that Ga species are responsible for 
dehydrogenating propane as well as for naphthene aromatization [ 
241. 
Nishijima et al. studied the primary products of propane conversion [25]. 
There are two primary reactions, dehydrogenation and cracking. 
Figure 7 shows the products of propane conversion over H-ZSM-5 and Zn- 
ZSM-5 at low conversion. The primary products are hydrogen, propylene, meth- 
ane, and ethylene. By extrapolating the compositions to zero percent conversion, 
the contributions of the two reactions, ( 3 )  
and (4), to the propane activation were

estimated. Table 3 summarizes the contributions of the two reactions over H- 
ZSM-5, Zn-ZSM-5, and Ga-ZSM-5. In the case of H-ZSM-5, cracking accounts 
for 75%-80% of the propane activation, while in the cases of Zn-ZSM-5 and 
Ga-ZSM-5, dehydrogenation accounts for 80%-92%. This clearly indicates that 
the loading of Zn or Ga cations enhances the dehydrogenation of propane. 
IV. BUTANE CONVERSION 
A .  Over H-ZSM-5 
The result of butane conversion over H-ZSM-5 is shown in Table 4. 
Propane 
is the predominant product and the yield of aromatics is very small [ 
121. 
The dependence of total conversion and the product selectivity on contact 
time has been examined at butane partial pressure of 8.0 kPa at 773 K [26]. In 
Fig. 8, the selectivities are shown as a function of the total conversion of butane. 
Here, the selectivities are expressed as the number of moles of each product

species listed here are the real primary products [26]. 
Thus, the primary reactions 
at low conversion can be explained by the following mechanism. This again

may release protons to form 
lower alkenes. The ratio of the contributions of the three reactions to butane 
activation, (5)-(7), can be estimated from the selectivities for methane, ethane, 
and hydrogen. The selectivities extrapolated to zero percent conversion indicate 
that the rates of the three reactions are in the ratio 42:38:20 (Table 5
)
.
 
Thus, the 
cleavage of the C

bonds is more prevalent than that of the C

H
 
bonds. A 
similar argument has been made about the activation of butane over H-ZSM-5, 
by Shigeishi et al. (271. 
In a later stage, the selectivities for methane, ethane, and hydrogen decrease 
as shown in Fig. 8. If reactions (5)-(7) were the only routes for butane activation, 
the selectivities for the three products should be constant at any conversion levels. 
The results clearly indicate that there is another mode of activation of butane at 
higher conversion. The higher yield of propane in the later stage may be related 
to the second mechanism, namely, hydride transfer.

(8) 
Thus, propane may be formed by the reaction of a butane molecule with a dimethyl 
carbenium ion, which is formed through alkene dimerization, isomerization, and 
cracking. Detailed calculation showed that the hydride-transfer mechanism ac- 
counts for about 40% of butane activation at high conversion [26]. 
The product distribution was also examined at butane pressure of 34 kPa, 
again as a function of the conversion. At low conversion, activation of butane 
occurs exclusively via pentacoordinated carbocations, that is, reactions (5)-(7), 
the ratio of the contributions of the three reactions at butane pressure of 34 kPa, 
being exactly the same as that at 8.0 
kPa pressure (Table 5). 
At the higher pressure, 
the formation of propane is more prominent in the later stage, indicating an 
increased rate of hydride-transfer reactions. 
B. Over Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga-ZSM-5

FIG. 9. Product selectivity as a function of butane conversion over Zn-ZSM-5 
[ 121. Reaction conditions: 773 K and 34.2 kPa C4HI0. 
1. The total conversion of butane decreases when Zn is introduced into 
H-ZSM-5, while it increases when Ga is introduced. 
2. Over Zn-ZSM-5, aromatic hydrocarbons are the main products. The 
selectivity for propane decreases considerably when Zn cations are in- 
troduced into H-ZSM-5. 
3. Introduction of Ga cations into H-ZSM-5 enhances the selectivity for 
aromatics, but not to the extent found in Zn-ZSM-5. The selectivity for 
lower alkanes remains high in contrast to the case of Zn-ZSM-5. 
4. 
Production of hydrogen increases sharply on introduction of Zn or Ga 
cations into H-ZSM-5, indicating that these cations enhance dehydro- 
genation. 
Product distributions over Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga-ZSM-5 as a function of total 
conversion of butane at 34.2 kPa and 773 K, are shown in Figs. 9 and 10, 
respectively. The selectivities for hydrogen are shown in Fig. 1 1 ,  together with 
that over H-ZSM-5. Similar experiments were also carried out at 8 kPa butane 
partial pressure. 
Extrapolation of the selectivities to zero percent conversion gives the product 
selectivities in the primary reactions. Results are given in Table 5 ,  where selec- 
tivities over H-ZSM-5 are also listed. 
The selectivities thus determined do not depend on the butane pressure, 
except that for the selectivity for isobutane over Zn-ZSM-5. It should be noted 
that the distributions of primary products over Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga-ZSM-5 are very 
different from the distribution over H-ZSM-5. The main products over the former

catalysts are hydrogen and butenes. In contrast to conversion over H-ZSM-5, the 
selectivities for methane and ethane are small, indicating that the contribution of 
the carbonium-ion mechanism to the activation of butane is small. The formation 
of isobutane and aromatics suggests that the primary products undergo secondary 
reactions before they leave the pore system of Zn-ZSM-5. 
Thus, the primary reactions in butane conversion over Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga- 
ZSM-5 at low conversion involve the following three reactions, formally the same 
as in the case of the conversion over H-ZSM-5.

It is clear that the contribution of reaction (10) for butane activation increases 
considerably on introducing Zn or Ga into H-ZSM-5. From the selectivities for 
methane, ethane, and hydrogen, it is estimated that about 80%-85% of the butane 
molecules reacted by dehydrogenation under the influence of Zn or Ga cations 
As total conversion increases, the selectivity for butenes decreases, indi- 
cating that butenes are transformed into other alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons 
by dimerization, isomerization, cracking, and dehydrogenation. 
Another important feature of the reaction observed over Zn-ZSM-5 is the 
small yield of propane and isobutane even in the later stage of reaction. This 
shows the small contribution of hydride transfer even at high conversion. As 
previously discussed, propane is the main product over H-ZSM-5 at high con- 
version levels. The difference between H-ZSM-5 and Zn-ZSM-5 is brought about 
by the difference in the acid strength of the two catalysts. Temperature-pro- 
grammed desorption spectra of ammonia revealed that the acid strength of 
H-ZSM-5 is considerably reduced by introducing Zn cations, as is described later. 
Because the contribution of hydride transfer must be smaller for less acidic 
catalysts, the mode of the activation of butane over Zn-ZSM-5 does not signif- 
icantly change with total conversion. 
Ga-ZSM-5 is more acidic than Zn-ZSM-5. This is reflected in the product 
distribution, especially at the later stage. The yields of lower alkenes (ethylene 
and propylene) are higher over Ga-ZSM-5 than over Zn-ZSM-5, especially at 
conversions of 10%-30% (Figs. 9 and 10). 
These alkenes are the primary products 
and, in addition, are formed by a rapid conversion of butenes, the predominant 
primary products of butane transformation. Over Ga-ZSM-5, the conversion of 
butenes to lower alkenes through dimerization and cracking is faster and gives 
high yields of the alkenes as compared with Zn-ZSM-5, because of the higher 
acidity of Ga-ZSM-5. The other important difference in butane conversion over 
Ga-ZSM-5 and Zn-ZSM-5 is the selectivity for propane at higher conversion 
levels. The extent of formation of propane is far greater over Ga-ZSM-5 than 
over Zn-ZSM-5. Since propane is formed via hydride-transfer reactions, the higher 
acidity of Ga-ZSM-5 leads to the higher production of propane.

Figure 11 shows that the selectivity for hydrogen increases with total con- 
version of butane in the case of Ga-ZSM-5 and Zn-ZSM-5, in contrast to reaction 
over H-ZSM-5. This indicates that the dehydrogenation of intermediate alkenes 
as well as the starting alkane occurs when Ga or Zn cations are present. 
Le Van Mao et al. studied the aromatization of butane with a mixture of 
H-ZSM-5 and various kinds of second components, which contain gallium or 
zinc oxide [28-301. By use of supported gallium oxide cocatalyst obtained by 
coprecipitation of a colloidal silica and a gallium salt, butane conversion of 99% 
with 65% selectivity was obtained. 
V. ISOBUTANE CONVERSION 
A .  Over H-ZSM-5 
Lombardo and Hall studied acid-catalyzed cracking of isobutane over several 
zeolites and demonstrated that two primary reactions occurred, resulting in the 
formation of methane and hydrogen and concomitantly t-butyl and isopropyl 
cations [3 
1 ,  321. 
Results of the transformation of isobutane over H-ZSM-5, Zn-ZSM-5, and 
Ga-ZSM-5 with an isobutane pressure of 8.0 kPa at 773 K are shown in Table 
6 [ 
121. Figure 12 shows the dependence of the conversion of isobutane over the 
three catalysts on contact time [ 
121. Over H-ZSM-5, the main products are lower 
alkenes and propane, and the yield of aromatics is only 6.6%. 
Figure 13 shows the dependence of product selectivity in isobutane cracking 
over H-ZSM-5 on total conversion at 773 K [26]. It is clear that the primary 
products at low conversion are methane, propylene, hydrogen (see Fig. 16), and 
butenes. At a later stage, ethylene and propane are formed significantly. 
The initial product distribution suggests that activation of isobutane occurs 
via a pentacoordinated carbonium-ion mechanism, namely, by reactions (1 2) and 
(13), in agreement with work of Lombardo and Hall [31, 321. 
The selectivities for methane and hydrogen at zero conversion, estimated 
by extrapolation, reveal that the rates of reactions (12) and (13) are in the ratio 
67:33. The selectivities for propylene and butenes give similar values, confirming 
that reactions (12)and (13) are operating at low conversion. Shigeishi et al. have 
recently reported that the ratio of the two reactions depends on reaction temper- 
ature, being 31:67 at 823 K [27].

’Selectivity in moles produced per 100 moles butane converted. 
In the later stage, the selectivities for the four products decrease, and those 
for ethylene and propane increase. The decrease in the selectivities for methane 
and hydrogen suggests that the activation of isobutane via a hydride-transfer 
mechanism comes into play. It is estimated that the hydride-transfer mechanism 
accounts for about 30% of isobutane activation at higher conversion [26]. 
B. Over Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga-ZSM-5 
Figure 12 and Table 6 show clearly that total conversion and selectivity for 
aromatic hydrocarbons increase greatly when Zn or Ga is introduced into H-ZSM- 
5. The yield of hydrogen also increases. Therefore, there is no doubt that the Zn 
or Ga species possess dehydrogenation activity. 
The selectivities for various hydrocarbons over Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga-ZSM-5 
are shown as a function of isobutane conversion in Figs. 14 and 15, respectively 
[12]. The selectivity for hydrogen is shown in Fig. 16, where the result for 
H-ZSM-5 is also shown.

The primary products over Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga-ZSM-5 are butenes, propyl- 
ene, methane, and hydrogen. Thus, as in the case of H-ZSM-5, the primary 
reactions over Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga-ZSM-5 can be explained by the following two 
reactions.

Selectivities for the primary products, estimated by extrapolation to zero percent 
conversion, are listed in Table 7, where the results for H-ZSM-5 are also listed 
[12]. The product ratios of methane and hydrogen over Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga-ZSM- 
5 are 1892 and 23:77, respectively, while the ratio over H-ZSM-5 is 67:33. 
Thus, the contribution of dehydrogenation becomes greater on incorporating Zn 
or Ga cations into H-ZSM-5. Since the total conversion over Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga- 
ZSM-5 was much higher than over H-ZSM-5, the absolute rates of both reactions

(14) and (15) are much higher than over H-ZSM-5. This point is discussed in 
detail later. 
As conversion increases, the selectivity for butenes decreases and that for 
aromatic hydrocarbons increases. In contrast with isobutane conversion over H- 
ZSM-5, the selectivity for propane remains low even at high conversion over Zn- 
ZSM-5, again indicating the low hydride-transfer activity of this zeolite. The 
higher yield of propane over Ga-ZSM-5 is ascribed to the higher acid strength 
of Ga-ZSM-5 as compared with Zn-ZSM-5. 
VI. PENTANE CONVERSION 
Figures 17 and 18 show the total conversion and yields of each product 
from pentane as a function of contact time at 773 K, over H-ZSM-5 and Ga- 
ZSM-5 (Si02/A1203 
= 78), respectively (331. 
The two catalysts show similar activities, pentane conversion being almost 
complete at short contact time. The intermediacy of lower alkenes and aliphatic 
hydrocarbons is clear, since the yields of these substances go through maxima. 
Propane starts to react when other reactive species are mostly consumed. 
Over H-ZSM-5, propane is the predominant product and the yield of aro- 
matics is about 25%. On the other hand, over Ga-ZSM-5, aromatics are the main 
products and the yield of propane is smaller. The faster decrease of alkenes with 
contact time over Ga-ZSM-5 indicates that Ga species serve for the efficient 
conversion of intermediate alkenes into aromatics. 
In order to find the role of metal cations in the activation of pentane, 
the conversion of pentane was carried out over H-ZSM-5, Zn-ZSM-5, and 
Ga-ZSM-5 at low pentane pressure (8 kPa) at 773 K [34]. The selectivity for 
aromatics was only 5% over H-ZSM-5, while it was about 65% over Zn- and 
Ga-containing zeolites. C

Ga-ZSM-5 compared with over H-ZSM-5, and dehydrogenation accounted for 
80%-85% of the primary reactions over the modified catalysts. Similar results 
were observed for the conversion of isopentane. These results are discussed later. 
VII. 
HEXANE CONVERSION 
Figure 19 shows the total conversion and the yield of each product from 
hexane as a function of contact time over H-ZSM-5 (SiO2/AI2O3 
= 42) at 773 
K [35]. The general features of the product distribution from hexane are very 
similar to those from pentane (see Fig. 17). Hexane is completely consumed at 
low contact time. Propane is the main product and the yield of aromatics is about 
15%. 
Figure 20 shows the total conversion and the yield of each product from 
hexane as a function of contact time over Ga-ZSM-5 (SiO2/AI2O3 
= 42, Ga 
content = 1.8 wt% as Gaz03) 
[35]. 
The reaction conditions are the same as those 
for H-ZSM-5 (Fig. 19). The general features of the product distribution are very 
similar to those in the conversion of pentane over Ga-ZSM-5 (Fig. 18). Thus, 
the main products are aromatic hydrocarbons and the yield of propane is much 
smaller than in reaction over H-ZSM-5. The alkene intermediates are efficiently 
converted into the final products over Ga-ZSM-5. 
Benzene is not a predominant aromatic product from hexane (351. This 
indicates that the direct dehydrogenation of hexane to benzene is not an important 
process in hexane conversion. 
Kanai and Kawata reported that the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons from 
hexane at 773 K increased to 60% on mixing H-ZSM-5 with ZnO 1361. The rate 
of hexane conversion also increased considerably in the presence of ZnO. It was 
proposed that ZnO serves as a catalyst for dehydrogenation of hexane to hexenes 
and also of intermediate alkenes to aromatics. It was found that galloaluminos- 
ilicate and gallosilicate gave higher yields of aromatics in hexane conversion than 
Ga-exchanged ZSM-5 or Ga203 
supported on H-ZSM-5 [37]. As is described 
later, it was suggested that the active Ga species in galloaluminosilicate and 
gallosilicate were cations dislodged from the zeolite framework. 
VIII. 
CONVERSION OF ALKENES INTO AROMATICS 
A. Reactions over ZSM-5 Zeolites 
Dehydrogenations of alkanes to alkenes are not thermodynamically favorable 
reactions, while the aromatization of alkenes is favorable. Therefore, the com- 
bination of the two chemical processes makes the conversions of alkane more 
favorable thermodynamically [ 161. From the kinetic aspect, the quick removal 
of alkenes formed from alkanes is required to attain a high conversion rate of 
alkanes. 
As already described, the experimental results on the conversion of lower

SCHEME 2 
alkanes suggest that Zn or Ga cations have a significant role in the transformation 
of intermediate alkenes into aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as in the activation 
of starting alkanes. Here, the reactions of lower alkenes over H-ZSM-5, Ga- 
ZSM-5, and Zn-ZSM-5 are described. 
The product distributions in the reactions of propylene and 1-butene over 
H-ZSM-5 and Zn-ZSM-5 at 773 K are summarized in Table 8 [S]. The total 
conversions are slightly higher over Zn-ZSM-5 than over H-ZSM-5 for both 
alkenes. The essential difference is observed in the selectivity for aromatic hy- 
drocarbons. In propylene conversion, the selectivities for aromatic hydrocarbons 
are 45.5% and 70.3% over H-ZSM-5 and Zn-ZSM-5, respectively. Similarly, in 
1-butene conversion, they are 38.6% and 77.8% over H-ZSM-5 and Zn-ZSM-5, 
respectively. A second difference observed is the smaller production of lower 
alkanes, such as propane, in conversions over Zn-ZSM-5 as compared with 
Ga-ZSM-5 is also effective [S]. Figure 21 shows the product distribution 
in the conversion of three alkenes over Ga-ZSM-5 at 773 K. In every case, the 
yield of aromatics is about 80%. The most important feature is that the distri- 
butions of aromatic hydrocarbons produced are almost same irrespective of the 
starting alkene. This indicates that the interconversion among alkenes through 
dimerization and cracking is very fast and precedes aromatization. 
The great enhancement of the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons supports the 
idea that the metal cations enhance the rate of aromatization of alkenes. 
Poustma proposed a mechanism involving protonic sites as active centers 
for the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons over acidic zeolites. Aromatics are 
formed from alkene-oligomers by the successive deprotonation and hydride trans- 
fer to carbenium ions [38]. 
The formation of the intermediates with alkylcyclopentene (ar alkylpenta- 
diene) structure from alkenes has been demonstrated by UV spectroscopy [39] 
and by analysis of residual products on the zeolite [40].

For this mechanism, the formation of 1 molecule of aromatic hydrocarbons 
inevitably accompanies the formation of 3 alkane molecules. Actually, the molar 
ratio of alkanes to aromatics in the products in l-butene conversion over 
H-ZSM-5 is 2.9 (calculated from the data in Table 8), indicating that the scheme 
proposed by Poustma is operative. On the other hand, the alkane/alkene ratio in

the product over Zn-ZSM-5 at 773 K is 0.9. The lower alkane/aromatics ratio of 
the products and the enhancement of the aromatic yield are clear evidence that 
a mechanism other than the one described here is operative for Zn-ZSM-5. It is 
very plausible that metal cations act as dehydrogenation centers for alkenes. It 
was observed that about 0.7 molecules of hydrogen are formed from 1 molecule 
of alkene reacted in the aromatization of isobutene over Zn-ZSM-5 [8]. 
B. Conversion of Alkenes over Borosilicates 
In order to distinguish the role of zinc cations from that of protons in alkene 
aromatization, the conversion of propylene and 1 
-butene over borosilicates was 
studied, since the acid strength of borosilicates is very weak [8, 221. Table 9 
shows the product distribution in the conversion of propylene and I-butene over 
H-borosilicate and Zn-borosilicate 1221. In contrast to the reactions of alkenes 
over H-ZSM-5, the yields of aromatics and lower alkanes are very small and the 
main product is lower alkenes for the reaction over H-borosilicate. This result 
shows that H-borosilicate has catalytic activity for the interconversion among

alkenes-that 
is, the oligomerization of alkenes and the decomposition of the 
oligomers-but 
not activity for hydride transfer between carbenium ions and 
alkene molecules. This is a reflection of the weak acid strength. 
Loading Zn cations on H-borosilicate changes the nature of catalysis. Now, 
aromatic hydrocarbons are formed from lower alkenes. In contrast to conversion 
over H-ZSM-5, the yields of lower alkanes are very small, indicating that in- 
corporation of zinc species does not generate acidic centers capable of catalyzing 
hydride-transfer reactions. Therefore, the increase in yield of aromatic hydro- 
carbons cannot be assigned to the change in acid strength of the catalyst. Thus, 
it is obvious that zinc cations have an essential role in the aromatization. 
Butadiene was observed in the 1-butene reaction over Zn-borosilicate [8]. 
This is further evidence that zinc cations are responsible for the dehydrogenation 
of alkenes. Formation of butadiene from 1-butene is more clearly observed under 
conditions of low contact time, high temperature, and lower alkene pressure [8]. 
A typical result is shown in Fig. 22, where the yields of butadiene and aromatics 
are plotted as a function of total conversion of 1-butene over Zn-borosilicate at 
853 K. At low conversion, the main product is butadiene. The selectivity for 
butadiene is very high, 77% and 58% at total conversions of 10% and 30%, 
respectively. The aromatics are not the primary products, since their yields in- 
crease only at a later stage, as the yield of butadiene decreases. At 56% conversion, 
the selectivity for aromatics is 62%. 
C. Reaction Scheme

3. Over strongly acidic zeolite such as H-ZSM-5, lower alkanes dimerize through 
a carbenium-ion mechanism over protonic sites. The dimers may isomerize and 
decompose to reproduce a variety of lower alkenes, or may undergo hydride 
transfer to carbenium ions. Successive hydride transfer and deprotonation leads 
to the simultaneous production of aromatics and alkenes. Since the formation of 
1 molecule of aromatic hydrocarbons inevitably accompanies the formation of 3 
molecules of alkane, the yield of aromatics is limited. 
In the presence of Zn or Ga cations, alkenes may undergo direct abstraction 
of a hydrogen “atom” (or ion) to form allylic species. Aromatic hydrocarbons 
may be formed by the successive abstraction of hydrogen atoms (or ions) from 
higher alkenes or by direct coupling of the two allylic species with simultaneous 
production of hydrogen molecules. Since dimerization of alkenes is very fast 
except at very low pressures, only the first of these two routes may be operative 
for aromatization under ordinary reaction conditions. Meriaudeau et al. studied 
the reaction of 1-hexene at low pressure and low contact time over H-ZSM-5 and 
Ga-ZSM-5 at 773 K [41]. H-ZSM-5 gave almost exclusively cracked products. 
In contrast, the main products over Ga-ZSM-5 were propene and benzene. They 
explain the difference by the very rapid dehydrogenation of the hexene over Ga- 
ZSM-5 to hexadiene and hexatriene, which undergo facile cyclization by the 
action of protons. 
Since dehydrogenation in the presence of the metal cations does not result 
in the simultaneous formation of alkanes, there is no limit to the yield of aromatics. 
This explains the higher yield of aromatic hydrocarbons over Zn-containing zeo- 
lites. 
IX. CONVERSION OF METHANOL INTO 
AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS 
ZSM-5 zeolites are known to convert methanol into hydrocarbons of gas- 
oline-range boiling products [42-461. The product includes ca. 60 wt% aromatic 
hydrocarbons [42]. However, the one-pass yield of aromatic hydrocarbons is not 
necessarily high. Thus, Chang and Silvestri reported that at 644 K and atmospheric 
Downloaded by [Tulane University] at 22:02 12 August 2013

ON0 
pressure, the fraction of aromatics in the hydrocarbon products was 41.1 wt% 
[43]. According to the accepted mechanism [43, 451, the initial product is lower 
alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons being formed via hydride transfer between alkenes 
such carbeniutn ions. This limits the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons, since the 
formation of aromatics inevitably accompanies the formation of alkanes as pre- 
viously described. Since ZSM-5 zeolites loaded with Zn or Ga cations are effective 
in the aromatization of alkenes, the formation of alkanes could be minimized by 
converting methanol over these catalysts. 
The product distributions in methanol conversion over H-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM- 
5 and Zn-ZSM-5 at 700 K are shown in Table 10, and that over Ga-ZSM-5 at 
800 K [47]. Over H-ZSM-5, the yield of aromatics is 40.3%, the main products 
being lower alkanes. Incorporation of Ga cations improves slightly the yield of 
aromatics at 700 K. The yield of aromatics is improved to 64% at 800 K, while 
it remains 44% over H-ZSM-5 at the same temperature. At 700 K, the yield of 
aromatics is highest over Zn-ZSM-5. In contrast to the conversion over H-ZSM- 
5 and Ga-ZSM-5, appreciable amounts of lower alkenes are found in the products 
over Zn-ZSM-5. In the case of conversion over Zn-ZSM-5, the decomposition 
of methanol to carbon oxides and water becomes significant above 750 K. 
The main aromatic products over Zn-ZSM-5 at 700 K are xylenes. Tri- 
methylbenzenes and toluene are formed in large quantities. 
The difference in the product distribution between conversion over Zn-ZSM-

5 and over Ga-ZSM-5 is attributed to the difference in the acidic properties of 
the zeolites. The highly acidic Ga-ZSM-5 gives more alkanes as a result of 
hydride-transfer reactions, which are suppressed over Zn-ZSM-5. 
The enhanced selectivity for aromatics in methanol conversion over Ga- 
ZSM-5 and Zn-ZSM-5 is consistent, Ga and Zn species being effective for the 
aromatization of alkenes.

The many different formulations of GdH-ZSM-5 
and Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts 
found to be useful in alkane aromatization can be classified into four categories, 
according to the preparation method.

3. Gallosilicate or zincosilicate 
4. Mechanical mixture of Ga203 
or ZnO with H-ZSM-5 
The method of introducing the Ga or Zn does not seem to have a critical

FIG 23. Changes in the total conversion and the selectivity for aromatics with Ga 
content in propane conversion over Ga-ZSM-5 [21]. Reaction conditions: 773 K, 101 
kPa C3H8, 
and WIF = 7.0 g h mol-'. 
H-ZSM-5 loaded with zinc acetate by impregnation, and a mechanical mixture 
of ZnO and H-ZSM-5. The three catalysts give similar selectivity for aromatics, 
though the mechanical mixture of H-ZSM-5 and ZnO gives higher selectivity for 
lower alkanes, that is, ethane and propane. 
B .  Ion Exchange 
Ion exchange with multivalent cations for high-silica zeolites may not be 
so simple. Part of the metal cations may remain in the pore systems or on external 
surfaces as metal salts. This problem is particularly important in the case of Ga- 
ion exchange, since ion exchange with trivalent ions is very difficult in high- 
silica zeolites, and the actual cationic species exchanged could be Ga(OH)2+. 
Thus, Kitagawa et al. showed that the amount of Ga ions loaded by the ion- 
exchange method is several times larger than the ion-exchange capacity of H- 
ZSM-5 1211. It has been demonstrated that the highly silicious zeolites ZSM-5 
and ZSM-11 exhibit cation exchange capacities in excess of their framework 
aluminum contents 1481. The amount of metal cations required to enhance the 
selectivity for aromatic is as low as 1 wt% [21, 24, 491. Figure 23 shows the 
changes in total conversion and selectivity for aromatics with content of gallium 
(as metal) in the transformation of propane over Ga-ion-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolites 
[2 
1 1. Total conversion and selectivity for aromatics increase sharply with in- 
creasing Ga content up to 1 wt%. 
C .  Metallosilicates 
Gallosilicates and zincosilicates are also effective for aromatization [ 
17, 18, 
37, 50, 511. Inui et al. reported that gallosilicates showed higher activity for

ZSM-5 ZEOLITES IN LOWER ALKANE TRANSFORMATION 
213 
conversion of propane [ 171 bud did not examine whether gallium cations are 
located in the zeolite framework or in the extraframework cation sites. As de- 
scribed earlier, Kanai and Kawata showed that galloaluminosilicate and gallos- 
ilicate have much higher activity for hexane aromatization than Ga-exchanged 
ZSM-5 or Ga203-supported H-ZSM-5 1371. The activity of gallosilicate was 
lowered significantly by treating with I M HCl and the activity of the HC1-treated 
gallosilicate increased by small addition of Ga3+. 
From these results, they sug- 
gested that the active Ga species over galloaluminosilicate and gallosilicate were 
not Ga species in the framework but those outside the framework. 
Khodakov et al. reported that catalytic activity for propane conversion was 
enhanced during the catalytic reaction and the subsequent regenerations [52]. 
From infrared spectroscopic studies, they concluded that gallium ions are released 
from the framework and that the extraframework gallium species are catalytically 
active sites in propane aromatization. Simmons et al. studied the cracking of 
butane over the gallosilicate analog of ZSM-5 zeolite and over the hydrothermally 
modified gallosilicate [53]. 
The products of butane cracking over the gallosilicate 
were similar to those over H-ZSM-5, indicating that gallium-occupying frame- 
work sites exhibit acid behavior similar to the aluminosilicate. With mild steam- 
ing, a 10-fold increase in cracking activity was observed accompanied by marked 
changes in product distribution. Thus, the hydrothermally treated gallosilicate 
gave cracked products, with alkenes predominating. Dispersed Ga203 
on silicalite 
similarly exhibited a considerable catalytic activity with a product distribution 
comparable to the steamed gallosilicate. From these results, they suggested that 
the dehydrogenation activity of gallosilicates might be due to nonframework 
gallium species present in these materials [53]. 
The high activities of gallosilicates are probably caused by better dispersion 
of gallium species in the zeolite pores in comparison with zeolites into which 
gallium ions are introduced by ion exchange or impregnation.

Mechanical Mixtures o

 Metal Oxides and H-ZSM-5 
The state of metal cations in mixtures of a metal oxide and a ZSM-5 zeolite 
deserves discussion. Kanazirev and co-workers found a strong enhancement in 
the propane aromatization activity of the Ga203-H-ZSM-5 catalyst by activating 
the catalyst by either hydrogen pretreatment or long-term exposure to a propane 
reactant (54, 551. From temperature-programmed reduction and X-ray diffraction 
studies, they concluded that the active species is probably Ga(1) cation, introduced 
by the following solid-solid reactions between Ga203 
and H-ZSM-5. 
Ga203 + 2H2 + 
Ga20 + 2H20

Ga20 + 2H'Z- +

Price and Kanazirev further reported that, when a mixture of Ga203 
and Na- 
ZSM-5 was heated in a hydrogen stream, reaction stopped at the stage of reaction 
(1 
6) and ion-exchange reaction ( 1  
7) did not proceed 1561.

Tan et al. reached a similar conclusion that Ga ions in a reduced state 
migrate more easily in the channels of ZSM-5 [57]. 
A solid-state reaction between ZnO and H-ZSM-5 has been also confirmed 
by various techniques by Yang et al. [58]. 
Temperature-programmed desorption 
of ammonia showed a 20% loss of adsorption capacity for ammonia, and IR 
indicated loss of protonic sites and increase in Lewis sites, on heating H-ZSM- 
5 with ZnO at 853 K for 1 h. Ono and co-workers found that a mixture of ZnO 
and Na-ZSM-5 had no activity even for dehydrogenation of isobutane, in spite 
of the very high activity of a ZnO-H-ZSM-5 mixture [59]. In order to find the 
difference in the catalytic properties of the two catalytic systems, a study was 
made of the infrared spectra of pyridine adsorbed on H-ZSM-5, Na-ZSM-5, Zn- 
ZSM-5 (ion exchange), and mechanical mixtures of ZnO and H-ZSM-5 and of 
ZnO and Na-ZSM-5. All the samples were treated in an air stream at 773 K for 
1.5 h and degassed at the same temperature for 1.5 
h. Pyridine vapor was exposed 
to the samples at 473 K for 1.0 h, then the sample was evacuated at 473 K for 
1.0 h. Results are shown in Fig. 24. In the case of H-ZSM-5, only the bands 
due to pyridinium ions were observed, and no bands due to pyridine molecules 
interacting with Lewis acid sites were observed. In the case of Na-ZSM-5, bands 
due to pyridium ions were not observed, and a band appeared at 1444 cm-', 
attributable to pyridine molecules interacting with Na' cations. For Zn-ZSM-5, 
the formation of Bransted sites was confirmed by the presence of a band at 1548 
cm-' (pyridinium ions), and a band at 1454 cm-' was observed, possibly due to 
pyridine molecules interacting with Zn-cations. The spectrum of pyridine adsorbed 
on a mixture of ZnO and Na-ZSM-5 was essentially the same as that of pyridine 
adsorbed on Na-ZSM-5, indicating that no chemical change occurred in Na-ZSM- 
5 on heating it with ZnO. On the other hand, the spectrum of pyridine adsorbed 
on a mixture of ZnO and H-ZSM-5 is similar to that of pyridine adsorbed on Zn- 
ZSM-5. Thus, development of the band at 1454 cm-' indicates that Zn species 
are present in the ZSM-5 channels as cations. Recently, work has been reported 
on solid-solid ion-exchange reactions between metal oxides (or salts) and proton 
forms of zeolites [60-641. In no case, however, has solid-solid reaction of Na 
forms of zeolites with metal oxides been successful [60-631. Temperature-pro- 
grammed desorption of ammonia also indicates that a part of protons in H-ZSM- 
5 is exchanged with Zn cations by a solid-solid reaction of H-ZSM-5 and ZnO, 
as described later. 
E. Catalyst Lqe 
A problem associated with the use of zeolites which contain zinc or gallium 
is the loss of metal species from the catalysts under the reducing conditions of 
alkane conversion. For example, under reaction conditions, the strong reducing 
agent (hydrogen and carbon) can convert zinc oxide into the metal. Addition of 
promoters such as palladium is proposed in order to prevent metal loss [65]. 
Discussion of the volatilization of metal components is given by Seddon [

Pt. In conversion of propane over a gallosilicate at 873 K, the total conversion 
of propane decreased from 80% to 50% at 8 h on stream. For Ptigallosilicate, 
total conversion did not decrease to 50% even in 24 h on stream at 823 K. The 
rate of coke formation for Pt/gallosilicate (2.40 mg of C/(g-catalyst h) was much 
slower than for the gallosilicate. 
Although the reaction temperature 
for Wgallosilicate 
was lower than for gallosilicate, it was concluded that the presence of Pt plays 
an important role in decreasing the catalyst decay. It was also shown that the 
presence of Pt greatly accelerates the regeneration of the deactivated catalyst by 
promoting the oxidation of the deposited coke. The authors demonstrated pro- 
longed operations, including reaction-regeneration cycles, using a flow apparatus 
with automatic control. As shown in Fig. 25, the activity of the deactivated Pt/Ga- 
silicate was completely recovered on regeneration with air for 25 min. Reaction- 
regeneration cycles were repeated for 1000 hr, with no changes in both activity 
and selectivity.

H-ZSM-5 [68]. Similar results were observed also for Ga-ZSM-5 prepared by 
ion exchange [47, 691. The catalytic activities for hexane cracking [21], heptane

cracking (241, and cyclohexane isomerization [24] also indicate that the acidic 
properties of Ga-ZSM-5 are close to those of H-ZSM-5. Yakerson et al. examined 
the acidic properties of Ga-containing ZSM-5, which was prepared by ion ex- 
change of NH4-ZSM-5 followed by impregnation in the mother solution, by using 
infrared spectroscopy [49]. They found the concentration of strong acidic sites 
was only feebly dependent on Ga content in the range 0.5%-5% and concluded 
that Ga ions do not occupy cation positions and are not located in zeolite channels. 
In contrast, Meriaudeau and Naccache reported that the number of Bransted 
acid sites decreased on heating H-ZSM-5 with Ga203 
under hydrogen [70] and 
took this as evidence for solid-phase ion exchange between Ga203 
and H-ZSM- 
5. 
Unlike Ga-containing zeolites, the acidic properties of H-ZSM-5 zeolites 
are greatly modified by introducing Zn cations. Figure 27 shows the temperature- 
programmed desorption spectra of ammonia from Zn-containing zeolites [68]. 
Zn-cations were introduced by three different methods-ion 
exchange, impreg- 
nation, and physical mixing with ZnO-followed 
by heating at 773 K. In every 
case, the amount of strongly acidic sites is greatly decreased by introducing Zn- 
cations. The decrease is observed also for a physical mixture of ZnO and H- 
ZSM-5, indicating that the ion exchange by a solid-solid reaction proceeds during 
heating of the mixture. This result, however, conflicts with the observation by 
Kanai and Kawata, who observed no differences in TPD spectra of H-ZSM-5 
and a mechanical mixture of ZnO and H-ZSM-5 [37]. 
Yakerson et al. examined the infrared spectra of pyridine adsorbed on Zn- 
ZSM-5 (impregnated) with different amounts of Zn [49]. The number of Bransted

acid sites decreases linearly with zinc content up to 2 wt% Zn, while the number 
of Lewis acid sites increases linearly with zinc content. These facts indicate that 
the decrease in number of Brbnsted acid sites by introduction of Zn results in 
exchange of OH protons by Zn" 
ions, which are the source of Lewis acid sites. 
The difference in the acidic properties between Ga-ZSM-5 and Zn-ZSM-5 
should have a great influence on the reaction pathway of the aromatization, since 
both lower alkanes and alkenes are activated either by protons or by metal cations, 
as discussed earlier. 
XII. 
MECHANISM OF ALKANE ACTIVATION 
The general characteristics of alkane aromatization described in the former 
sections clearly show that the loading of zinc or gallium cations greatly enhances 
the rate of the dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkene intermediates. The mech- 
anism of the enhancement by the metal cations, however, still remains contro- 
versial. 
Mole et al. proposed that zinc cations act as a hydride acceptor to give a 
transient species such as [Zn-HI 
+ [ 171.

thus allowing oligo-

promote heterolytic cleavage of carbon-hydrogen bonds to give a species of the

type [Zn-HI’ [71]. On the other hand, Le Van Mao reported that ZnO did not 
show any activity for butane dehydrogenation at 813 K [29]. 
It has been recognized that Ga203 
has dehydrogenation activity for propane 
to propylene [72-741 and hexane to benzene [41, 741. Meriaudeu et al. noticed 
that the intrinsic activity for propane dehydrogenation of Ga203-H-ZSM-5 is 
much higher than that of Ga203 [41, 751. In order to check the effect of the 
zeolite acidity on the intrinsic dehydrogenation activity, they examined the rate 
of primary reactions over four kinds of catalysts. Gallium (5 wt%) and Zn (0.5 
wt%) were introduced into both the Na-form and the H-form of ZSM-5. In Table 
12 are listed the selectivity for propylene and the rates of formation of methane 
and propylene. Table 12 clearly shows that the important difference in the rate 
of propylene formation as the zeolite is changed from its H-form into Na-form, 
Ga-H-ZSM-5 being 100-fold more active than Ga-Na-ZSM-5. This is a clear 
indication that the zeolite acidity is an important parameter not only for the 
oligomerization of alkenes but also for the production of alkenes from alkanes. 
Ono and co-workers observed similar activity differences between Zn-H-ZSM-5 
and Zn-Na-ZSM-5 in isobutane activation [68]. 
As described previously, the two primary reactions of isobutane conversion 
are [12]: 
The author and co-workers studied the rates of the primary reactions in the 
conversion of isobutanes over H-ZSM-5 and Zn-ZSM-5 [68]. The rates are listed 
in Table 13. Irrespective of the method of loading zinc cations into H-ZSM-5,

dehydrogenation of isobutane is greatly enhanced, 60- to 150-fold. Furthermore, 
the rate of formation of methane is also enhanced, 10- to 20-fold. Thus, the ratio 
of the rate of dehydrogenation to that of methane formation is about 4-6. 
As described in the previous section, both the number of acid sites and acid 
strength are reduced by loading zinc cations onto H-ZSM-5. Therefore, the en- 
hancement of the rate of methane formation cannot be attributed to the change 
in the acidic properties but must be directly related to the presence of zinc cations 
(and protons). Thus, zinc cations play an important role both in dehydrogenation 
and in C

This mechanism is in conformity with the fact that the protonic sites are essential 
even for dehydrogenating starting alkanes. 
Methane formation by zinc cations is also enhanced in the case of butane 
conversion. Though the extent of the enhancement is small (1.5-fold), this is an 
important figure, since the acidity of H-ZSM-5 is greatly reduced by zinc loading.

The enhancement of methane formation by zinc cations is much larger in the 
conversion of isobutane than in butane conversion. This is reasonably understood 
from the stabilities of carbenium ions. Tertiary carbenium ions, (CH&C+, are 
formed in the case of isobutane, while secondary carbenium ions. 
CH3CHCH2CH3, 
are formed from butane. 
Enhancement of the activity for methane formation from butane and iso- 
butane was also observed on loading gallium cations onto H-ZSM-5. 
Enhancement of methane and hydrogen formation is observed also in the 
conversion of pentane and isopentane [34]. The three primary reactions of iso- 
pentane conversion are: 
Table 14 shows the rate of the three reactions over H-ZSM-5, Zn-ZSM-5 (im- 
pregnated), and Ga-ZSM-5 1341. As expected, the dehydrogenation rate is en- 
hanced 19-72 times by loading Zn or Ga cations. At the same time, the rate of 
formation of methane is enhanced 4-15 times. Moreover, even the formation of 
ethane is enhanced about 5 times in the case of Ga-ZSM-5. These results indicate 
clearly that Zn or Ga species are involved as active centers for the C
-
C
 
bond 
cleavage as well as for the dehydrogenation of alkane molecules. 
In the case of pentane conversion, the rate of dehydrogenation is enhanced 
by 25- to 50-fold by loading zinc or gallium on H-ZSM-5 [34]. 
Methane formation 
is enhanced, but the extent of the enhancement was much smaller (at most 2- 
fold) compared with the enhancement in isopentane conversion, again under- 
standable from the stability of the carbenium ions produced [34]. 
Large enhancement of the rate of neopentane cracking was observed on 
loading zinc on H-ZSM-5, further confirming that the zinc species is involved 
in the C L C  bond cleavage of hydrocarbons [68]. As expected, the primary

products are only methane and butenes, no hydrogen formation being observed 
over either H-ZSM-5 or Zn-ZSM-5 at low conversion. 
Most of the present discussion is based on experimental results at low 
conversion and at low reactant pressures. It should be noted that the hydride- 
transfer mechanism is also involved at high conversion and at higher reactant 
pressures, the extent depending on the reactant and the acidity of the catalyst. 
Several authors propose the back-spillover mechanism for the enhancement 
of the alkane aromatization [28-30, 76, 771. In this mechanism, the activation 
of alkane molecules occurs by the action of Br6nsted acid sites as in the case of 
the conversion over ordinary H-ZSM-5. The monoatomic hydrogen species thus 
formed migrate into the metal oxide, which facilitates the recombination of mono- 
atomic hydrogen species to produce molecular hydrogen. 
The mechanism is mainly based on the fact that mechanical mixtures of H- 
ZSM-5 and the metal oxides (ZnO, Ga203) 
have high catalytic activity for aro- 
matization. For example, a catalyst system composed of H-ZSM-5 and Ga203 
supported on silica shows a selectivity of 6.5% for aromatics in butane conversion 
(281. A long-distance hydrogen back-spillover is claimed for such systems [29]. 
At the same time, proximity of the two components is preferable for high activity 
1291. As described in the previous section, it is well established that the solid- 
state ion exchange between metal oxides and the H-form of zeolites is facile at 
elevated temperatures [ 54-64], and has been confirmed for the Ga,O,-H-ZSM- 
5 and ZnO-H-ZSM-5 systems [54-591. Nevertheless, Le Van Mao et al. refute 
this possibility from experiments using H-ZSM-5, separated from a H-ZSM-S- 
Ga203/Si02 
catalyst which had been exposed to butane for 10 h under the same 
conditions as for a normal catalytic run (281. 
In the back-spillover mechanism, it is not clear what the migrating species 
(H+, H-, or H) are or how they recombine on the oxide surface. It is not easy 
to assume the formation of atomic hydrogen in the scheme involving carbenium- 
ion mechanisms. Le Van Mao et al. suspect that the ZnO surface having Zno- 
and Zn+-defects act as scavengers for H+ species which migrate on the surface 
of the cocatalyst according to the following equation 1291. 
Zn-Hf 
-+ Zn2+ + iH2 
(28) 
However, they do not specify how Zn2+ is reduced back to the lower oxidation 
state in the catalytic run. 
As already described, incorporation of Zn or Ga species into H-ZSM-5 
enhances not only the dehydrogenation but also the C
-
C
 
bond cleavage of 
alkanes, especially in the case of isobutane and isopentane. It seems difficult to 
reconcile very large enhancement of the C
-
C
 
bond cleavage with back-spillover 
mechanism. Reactions (23) and (24) may require the migration of protons, but 
the mechanisms expressed by reactions (1 9)-(22) are essentially different from 
the back-spillover mechanism, since the metal species are directly involved in 
the activation of alkanes. 
No mechanistic studies have been reported on the dehydrogenation of al-

kenes, though various evidence shows that metal cations are involved in the 
dehydrogenation of intermediate alkenes [8, 22, 41, 471. 
It seems that some difference exists between the mechanism of alkane 
dehydrogenation and that of alkene dehydrogenation: Borosilicates loaded with 
zinc have a very low activity for the reaction of alkanes 18, 351, in accord with 
the dual functional nature of alkane activation. On the other hand, as described 
earlier, Zn-borosilicates are effective for selective aromatization of alkenes [ 
8, 
351, indicating that the strongly acidic sites are not required for dehydrogenating 
alkenes. Formation of allylic species has been proposed for the adsorption of 
alkenes over ZnO (7 
1, 781. Whatever the detailed mechanism, the very high 
activity of Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga-ZSM-5 for the dehydrogenation of intermediate 
alkenes is probably the most significant feature of these catalysts. This explains 
why H-ZSM-5 loaded with transition metals such as Pt and Pd does not give 
high selectivities for aromatic hydrocarbons, even though transition metals have 
high dehydrogenation activity for alkanes. 
XLII. 
AROMATIZATION OVER Ag-LOADED ZSMJ 
The author and co-workers found very recently that H-ZSM-5 loaded with 
Ag cations is an active catalyst for aromatization of isobutane [79]. 
The reaction 
over Ag-H-ZSM-5 was carried out at butane pressure of 34.2 kPa at 773 K. The 
conversion was 68.1%, 
with selectivity for aromatics of 60.1% 
at 1 h of running. 
A unique property of the Ag-loaded zeolites in aromatization is the low content 
of benzene among aromatic products. The distribution of aromatics was as fol- 
lows-benzene: 
9.6%, toluene: 47.2%, ethylbenzene + xylenes: 35.7%, C9: 
7.1%, others: 0.4%. The selectivity for aromatics over Ag-H-ZSM-5 was much 
higher than over Zn-ZSM-5 (46%) and Ga-ZSM-5 (28%) under the same con- 
ditions [ 121. The conversion and selectivity dropped to 62.4% and 48.5%, re- 
spectively, at 5 h of running, probably due to reduction of Ag' cations. 
Ag-loaded H-ZSM-5 zeolites are also active and selective for aromatization 
of isobutene and methanol. The mechanistic study of aromatization over Ag- 
loaded ZSM-5 is now on progress.
