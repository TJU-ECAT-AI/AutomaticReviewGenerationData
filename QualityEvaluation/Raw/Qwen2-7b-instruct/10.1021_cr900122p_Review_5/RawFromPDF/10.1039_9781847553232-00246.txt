Selective Oxidations of C4 Paraffins 
BY FABRlZlO CAVANI AND FERRUCCIO TRIFIRO 
1 Introduction 
The aim of this review is to report on current 
information available 
in the scientific 
Four reactions are examined: 
and patent literature about the selective oxidation of C, paraffins. 
Oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride on (VO),P, 0,, 
Oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes on several different metal 
oxides, 
Oxidation of isobutane to methacrylic acid with heteropolycompounds, and 
Oxidation of isobutane to t-butyl alcohol with different classes of catalysts. 
Two of the reactions examined are multistep oxidation reactions (the n-butane 
oxidation to maleic anhydride and the isobutane oxidation to methacrylic acid), while the 
other two reactions are essentially one-step oxidation reactions. 
In selective oxidation of paraffins, the following three main questions are 
addressed: 
How is it possible to stop the oxidation at some intermediate products 
(avoiding its total oxidation) without operating at very low contact 
time, when 
the intermediates are more reactive than the paraffin? 
What is the mechanism of activation of the paraffin, abstraction of w, 
of H-, 
of H, or H+' 
donation? 
Is the selectivity also related to the mechanism of activation? 
The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of 
paraffin selective 
oxidation that has been well studied. Sufficient 
data have been thus far 
obtained so that an attempt can be made in the present review to answer these questions. 
For the gas-phase oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane. the catalytic performance 
of different metal oxide-based catalysts has been compared, and the best operative 
conditions 
to achieve the highest yield to olefins have been analyzed. 
For the liquid-phase hydroxylation of isobutane to t-butyl alcohol, the performance 
of different 
classes of catalysts, the nature of the active sites, and their analogy to enzymes 
at a molecular level have been studied.

process of selective oxidation of a paraffin.' 
The catalyst and the reaction have been thoroughly investigated in the scientific 
literature? Knowledge of the type of active sites and the features of the activation 
mechanism that allow high selectivity to be obtained can be useful in improving selectivity 
and activity in the oxidation of other paraffins. 
Since 1974 n-butane has been increasingly used in place of benzene as the raw 
material for maleic anhydride production for the following reasons3: 
Lower price, 
Nontoxicity. 
At present, more than 70 percent of the maleic anhydride is produced from 
n-butane. Several processes have been developed in recent years for n-butane oxidation 
which differ in regard to the following aspects': 
T

of recovery of maleic anhydride (anhydrous or aqueous), and 
System for the purification of maleic anhydride.

The different processes that have been proposed together with their main features 
are summarized in Table 1. 
Fixed-bed: 
m~ving-bed:-~ 
and fluidized-bed'.' reactors all use the same type of 
catalyst, (VO)2P207, 
and no other catalytic composition has been successfully proposed. 
A peculiarity of the catalyst is that no support has been used. The necessary mechanical 
strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small 
amount of promoters,8 (2) embedding the precursor with Z
r
 and Ti pyrophosphate' in 
fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed 
technology.596 
Therefore, the description of the selective oxidation 
of n-butane to maleic anhydride 
involves an analysis of the properties of (VO),P,O,.

 Chemistry of Preparation of the Catalysts. - 
The catalytic behavior of the V-P- 
based catalysts depends on the following main factors: 
Method of preparation of the precursor (type 
of reagents, reducing agents, and 
solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); 
P/V ratio; 
Presence of additives; and 
Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high tempera- 
ture. 
The many different factors involved in the chemistry of preparation of the active 
phase can account for the differences and the lack of reproducibility of the data reported 
in the literature for this catalytic system.

 Preparation of the Precursor. - 
There is large consensus274*6,10-15 
that the necessary 
conditions to obtain an optimal catalyst are the following: 
Synthesis of microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20 
prepared in organic solvent, 
characterized by a preferential exposure of the basal plane (001); 
Presence of defects in stacking of the platelets; and 
Slight excess of phosphorus with respect to the stoichiometric amount, an 
atomic P/V ratio in the range of 1.01 to 1.10 (the excess phosphorus with 
respect to the stoichiometric amount remains strongly bound with the acid 
vanadylphosphate; in fact, it is not removed by washing the precipitate). 
There are 
three methods of preparation of the precursor: 
1. Reduction of V5' compounds (V205) 
to V4+ 
in water, followed by the addition 
of phosphoric acid and obtainment of the solid by evaporation of the water16 
or by cry~tallization.~~'~ 
2. Reduction of V5' compounds in an organic solvent, addition of dry phosphoric 
acid, and filtration of the 
3. Preparation of VOPO, and reduction to (VO)HP04.0.5H20 in either an 
aqueous or an organic solvent.'* 
Preparation 2 is considered the optimal one to obtain active and selective 
~atalysts?*~*~~'~ 
In all preparations essentially only one phase has been observed, 
VOHPO,, 
with different levels of hydration (amorphous, 
with 4,2, or 0.5 mol of water). 
l7 
The optimum precursor is the phase with 0.5 mol of water of crystallization? 
Only when a considerable excess of phosphorus is used, (P/V>2), may another 
phase appear, VO(H2P04)2.'o When reduction of the vanadium 
compound is not complete,

which even in small amounts

The 
main difference ob-

pronounced; no preferential line broadening of the reflection relative to the (001) plane is 
observed?4 
In precursors prepared in an organic solvent (the most investigated preparation), 
the morphology depends on many factors such as: 
Nature of the solvent (aliphatic or aromatic

Nature of the reducing agent (in some cases, the solvent itself);"*13

Reaction of V204 with H3P04 to form (V0)HP0,.0.5H20 at the solid-liquid 
interface. 
A less likely alternative or parallel route to the last step is the solubilization of 
in an aqueous emulsion (water formed by vanadium reduction is not easily removed) and 
formation of (VO)HP04.0.5H20. 
The type of aliphatic alcohol influences the temperature of reduction of V

’
 which 
is kinetically controlled and complete only when benzyl alcohol (which forms 
benzaldehyde and benzoic acid) is utilized, when a long reduction time is used, and when 
the phosphoric acid is added.13 
In addition, it has been observed that the type of alcohol influences 
the morphology 
of (VO)HP04.0.5H20. With isobutanol, nonagglomerated platelets (rosette morphology) 
form with preferential exposure of the basal plane (Ool).” With sec- or t-butyl alcohol 
and isopropyl alcohol well formed, nonagglomerated platelets are obtained. 
With increasing the atomic P/V ratio, the morphology changes from nonuniformly 
sized clumps (at P/V=l.O) to uniformly sized rosettes (P/V=l.l), to well-defined crystal 
plates (P/V=I 2). 
lo 
In dry milling, the rosette crystallites can be broken and the effect is to decrease 
the exposure of the (001) crystal plane, while in wet milling shear forces allow the 
platelets to slide away, thus increasing the exposure. 
In the preparation with benzyl alcohol as the reducing agent, many authors report 
the formation of platelets with stacking faults (deduced from the preferential broadening 
of the [Ool] 
reflection) attributed to the trapping of alcohol between the layers of the 
precursor and its release during acti~ation.~”~”~ 
In summary, the effect of 
several parameters on the properties of 
(VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the 
crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+. 
In the preparation in an aqueous medium, the following steps for the formation of 
the precursor can be proposed: 
Reduction of V205 to a soluble V4+ species; 
After addition of H3P04 no precipitation occurs, due to the strong acid 
(while in a basic medium amorphous NH4V02HP04 
forms22); 
Development of a (VO)HPO4.O.5H2O phase, together with another spurious 
amorphous phase, after complete evaporation of the solvent;516 and 
Alternatively, formation of the precursor by crystallization of pure

has not yet been clarified. However on the basis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
( X P S )  analysis, which indicates a higher P/V ratio at the surface than in the bulk,16 it is 
possible to suggest that the excess phosphorus is essentially adsorbed on the surface of the 
vanadylphosphate. 
Recently an aerosol preparation of a V-P catalyst has been carried out by Moser.23 
The method involves spraying a solution of ammonium vanadates and phosphoric acid at 
temperatures between 300 and 700 "C. XRD analysis showed the presence of different 
phases than the one obtained with the preparation in organic solvent.

transformation of the precursor to the active phase because many different 
phases can form

Activation in an oxygen-free atmosphere at D400

After calcination at 280 "C 
the precursor is still present while the trapped benzyl 
alcohol is being released, and this release disrupts the structure, causing an increase in 
surface area. At temperatures between 380 and 400

to an amorphous phase (containing both V4+ 
and V5+),63'6 
which can be dehydrated and 
transformed to (V0)2P20,

Key considerations to avoid the oxidation of (VO),P207 and of the intermediate 
amorphous phase to a V5+ phosphate, whose formation is known to be deleterious for 
activity and ~ e l e c t i v i t y , ~ ~ ~ ~ - ~ ~  
are the following: 
The P/V ratio. P/V ratios in the precursor higher than the stoichiometric 
amount stabilize (VO)P207 
not only in the reactants atmosphere but also for 
calcination in a
i
r
 at high temperature. 
Minimization of impurities. The presence of free V2o5,l9 
even in traces, or 
of additives such as Mn2+,22 
facilitates the oxidation of the vanadylpyro- 
phosphate also in the reactant mixture. 
Morphology. It has been proposed that the oxidation of (VO),P207 starts 
at 
the side faces of the (100) plane.2630.31 
Catalysts with a higher exposure of the 
(100) plane, such as those prepared in an organic medium, are therefore less 
oxidizable. 
Low-temperature of treatment in oxygen-containing atmosphere. 
Precursors prepared in an organic medium, thus more defective, transform at 
lower temperature?-*l 
Additives. For example, the presence of Zn2+ as a promoter avoids the 
overoxidation of the catalyst at high temperat~re.’~ 
It has been found20732733 
that different phases present in calcined catalysts can 
cooperate improving the catalytic behavior. Very likely these findings are less important 
for the most active and selective catalysts, where only one phase has been detected, but 
they can be important in the formation, and in the catalytic properties, of the 
vanadylpyrophosphate during the activation procedure. 
By means of electron microscopy,10”3 
it has been observed that the dehydrated 
phase maintains the morphology of the precursor. In addition, XRD analysis has shown 
that the broadening of reflections corresponding to the basal planes of the precursor also 
occurs in the reflections corresponding to the basal planes of (VO)2P207, 
as shown in 
Figure 2. 
These findings, together with some analogies of the two structures (see Figure 
3[A]) allowed Bordes et al.3, to propose that the transformation from (VO)~o,.0.5H20 
to (VO),P20, is topotactic. 
Recently Thompson et al? suggested, 
on the basis of the different symmetries of 
the two structures (Figure 3[B]), that it is very difficult that this transformation may be a 
topotactic one. In addition, it is difficult to assume a topotactic reaction for the formation 
of an active phase when an intermediate amorphous phase has been identified which 
transforms very slowly to the pyrophosphate.

In catalysts activated in air, the 
transformation from an amorphous 
phase to an almost completely crystal- 
line vanadylpyrophosphate inside the 
reactor (in the presence of the reactant's 
mixture) requires more than 100 
hours?6 The global effect in catalytic 
behavior is an increase in the yield of 
maleic anhydride, 
owing to the fact that 
the catalyst can operate at higher 
temperature 
and conversion maintaining 
high selectivity (values of 56 percent 
molar yield have been reached, as 
shown in Figure 4). 
Also in catalysts activated in 
nitrogen, where the fresh catalyst is a 
pyr~phosphate?~ 
modifications 
in activ- 
ity occur along the frrst 100 hours. The 
temperature of the reactor is progres- 
sively decreased; as a consequence, the 
conversion of n-butane is decreased, but nevertheless the yield to maleic anhydride 
increases due to the fact that the selectivity is increased. During this activation procedure 
the structure of the pyrophosphate remains stable, with only a slight oxidation of vanadium 
(the average oxidation state increases from 4,000 to 4.004) and a slight decrease in the 
bulk atomic P/V ratio. 
2.2.3 Conditioning Procedure. - 
After the stage of activation, changes occur during 
prolonged time-on-stream in an n-butane/air mixture, in both the catalytic behavior and the 
physicochemical properties of the catalyst. 
A fresh catalyst has been designated2 as a "nonequilibrated" one, while a catalyst 
after prolonged time-on-stream has been designated as an "equilibrated" 
one. In the same 
review: warning has been given against extrapolation of the initial activity of the catalyst 
to its behavior in industrial-like conditions. 
A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic 
anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ 
to V5+ 
in 
the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the 
considerable 
decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)? A more 
precise definition of an equilibrated catalyst has been given recently by Ebner and 
Thompson?* According to the authors, an equilibrated catalyst is the one that has been 
kept in a flow of n-butane and air with a hydrocarbon concentration of 1.4 to 2 percent

structures.

However, they did not observe 
changes in the P/V ratio during the conditioning, 
but 
only a decrease of the P/V ratio in the bulk and a slight oxidation of vanadium, with an 
increase of the average oxidation degree from 4.000 to 4.004. 
It is now possible to modify the previous explanation that has been given on the 
role of defects in nonequilibrated catalysts prepared in an organic medium. It has been 
proposed that defects increase the Lewis acidity of calcined catalysts, which is necessary 
for n-butane activation? Even though it is not yet possible to rule out that the defects are 
responsible 
for the higher activity of nonequilibrated catalysts, 
it Seems that their main role 
may be 
in directing 
or facilitating 
the transformation of the surface of a fresh catalyst (and 
perhaps 
a
l
s
o
 
of the bulk) during the conditioning 
step to a situation more favorable 
for the 
optimal catalytic behavior. 
In fact. two different 
polytypes of (VO),P207 exist (Figure 5), which may possess 
different 
and evolution to the most stable form (that one present in equili- 
brated catalyst) may occur more easily starting from a more defective precursor. 
becomes similar to that of the catalysts 
prepared in an aqueous 
medium. How- 
ever, equilibrated catalysts prepared in 
an organic 
medium still 
maintain higher 
activity and selectivity than those 
prepared in an aqueous medium. 
Therefore, the defects in the (100) 
crystal plane do not seem to be 
directly 
related to the higher activity resulting 
from organic preparation, and other 
factors 
must be 
taken into consideration 
to explain the better catalytic perfor- 
mance. These authors also have not 
observed big changes in bulk composi- 
tion and in P/V surface ratio during the 
conditioning 
time. 
According to Kubias et al.,37 
during conditioning 
a transformation of 
the surf= 
occurs from a situation 
where termination with pyrophosphate 
groups predominates to one where 
orthophosphate groups predominate,

hour has been taken as the index of (VO),P207 reducibility. 
In catalysts with a slight defect of phosphorus (P/V=0.95), a considerable increase 
of the ease of oxidation (with respect to the catalyst with P/V=l.O) occurs, and the 
reducibility remains high. For P/V ratios higher than 1, both the reoxidizability and the 
reducibility of the catalyst decrease considerably. It has been found that high relative 
amounts of V5+ 
increase the activity and decrease the selectivity, while the low reducibility 
of V4+ is an index of low activity. Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus 
(P/V=1.05) 
exhibit the right compromise 
between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary 
to obtain both high activity and high selectivity. According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 
the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces 
of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 
phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability. 
T ~ i f i r b ~ ~  
has suggested that the surface enrichment of phosphorus (as found by 
means of X P S  and SIMS analy~is'~'~~) 
helps in hindering the oxidation of (V0),P2O, both 
in the reactant's atmosphere and in air. 
2.3 The Mechanism of the Reaction. - 
A generally accepted reaction pattern is reported 
in Table 2. 
None of these intermediates is observed among the reaction products under usual 
reaction conditions. This raises a doubt about the validity of the proposed mechanism; 
however, the absence of intermediate products can be justified simply by kinetic reasons. 
The rate-determining step is the first one. Indeed, the initial rate of oxidation of 
1-butene is from 2045 
to 60 times2 higher than that of n-butane. This may result in the 
quick transformation of the intermediates to maleic anhydride before any desorption of the 
former may occur. 
The reaction pattern described in Table 2 has been proposed on the basis of the 
following experimental facts:

Catalysis 
Butenes, butadiene, and furan have been detected in the oxidation of n-butane 
with V-P 
catalysts under very unusual conditions, such as 
in a deficiency of 
oxygen at very high n-butane concentration and at very low contact time? or 
under high vacuum in temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor,& or in the 
oxidation of n-butane under anaerobic conditions in a pulse react0r.4~ 
In the oxidation of butenes, butadiene, and furan at the same conditions as 
those used for the oxidation of n-butane, maleic anhydride together with most 
intermediates 
reported in Table 2 (with the exception of 2,5dihydrofuran and 
of the lactone) have been observed.z7 
Oxidation of 2,5-dihydrofuran to furan occurs at very low temperature 
(200 "C) 
with very high selectivity. This may be the reason why this com- 
pound has never been observed among the reaction products of butenes and 
butadiene oxidation? 
The reaction pattern proposed in Table 2, which is a first approximation of the 
mechanism, shows the elementary steps necessary to obtain maleic anhydride 
and the types 
of active sites that are required. The polyfunctional nature of V-P 
catalysts has been 
confirmed by the oxidation of probe molecules where the individual steps of the reaction 
pattern 
of Table 2 have been singled out.4' The main products obtained in the oxidation 
of several probe molecules on V-P 
catalysts are reported in Table 3. The high selectivity 
and yield obtained in the oxidation of these molecules constitute evidence of the 
polyfunctional nature of V-P 
catalysts, and of the possibility that all the reported steps of 
Table 2 can indeed occur. 
The peculiarities 
of (VOhP20, 
in carrying out the reactions shown in Table 2 are 
the following: 
1. A first key property is the ability to activate the paraffin (the first step of the 
reaction pattern) with high selectivity; 
in fact, vanadium phosphates 
other than 
the vanadylpyr~phosphate~~ 
or molybdenum oxide-based 
are known

to be active and selective in the oxidation of butenes and butadiene to maleic 
anhydride. 
2. A second key feature is its high selectivity to maleic anhydride, also related 
t
o
 the fact that the rate of dehydrogenation is remarkably higher than that of 
oxygen inserti0n.3~ 
Oxygen insertion reactions on butenes (a route parallel to 
the oxydehydrogenation of butene to butadiene) are 
in fact responsible 
for the 
formation of crotonaldehyde and methylvinylketone, precursors of COX 
forma- 
tion via oxidative cleavage of the C=C bond. 
Support for this hypothesis comes from the comparison of the selectivity 
and activity in benzene and n-butane oxidation on V-Mo and V-P ~atalysts!~ 
The two catalysts are active in both reactions, but the ratio of the rates of 
benzene and n-butane oxidation is much higher in V-Mo than in V-P catalysts. 
This ratio can be taken as 
an index of the relative rate of oxygen insertion and 
of oxidative dehydrogenation. In fact, both catalysts are selective in benzene 
oxidation to maleic anhydride, but the selectivity of V-Mo catalysts 
in n-butane 
oxidation is very low. Thus, the V-Mo catalyst is very active in oxygen 
insertion upon benzene to yield maleic anhydride, but this 
property makes the 
catalyst unsuitable for maleic anhydride synthesis from n-butane, due to the 
fact that the oxidation of intermediate butene to oxygen-containing compounds 
is faster than its dehydrogenation to butadiene. 
In addition, it has been found2 
that catalysts selective in butene oxidation 
to maleic anhydride give essentially butadiene as 
the byproduct, while unselec- 
tive catalysts also give crotonaldehyde and methylvinylketone. The latter 
catalysts are also unselective in n-butane oxidation. 
3. A further property of the V-P 
catalyst, which can contribute to the high 
selectivity, is the lack of desorption of any intermediate. In fact, no inter- 
mediate product has been detected in the gas phase under usual reaction 
conditions. This limits the possibility of side reactions. In fact, in the oxida- 
tion of all the intermediates listed in Table 2, other than maleic anhydride and 
carbon oxides, other byproducts form such as acids, ketones, and aldehydes. 
Other products form because of acid-catalyzed side reactions of oligomeri- 
zation, isomerization, and hydration, occurring on the acid sites of the catalyst, 
above a
l
l
 in the 1-butene oxidation. 
The r
a
t
e
 of oxidation of any adsorbed species is very high. Consequently, the 
amount of adsorbed 
intermediates is very low, and this makes their detection by means of 
in situ infrared 
(IR) spectroscopy a hard task? 
However, even though there are strong indications that all the types of sites 
necessary 
to fulfii 
the reaction pattern proposed are present in V-P catalysts, 
many aspects 
of the mechanism must still be clarified. The points that require more thorough study 
follow:

Catalysis 
Because no desorption of intermediates occurs during n-butane oxidation, the 
mechanism of Table 2 may not be the actual one. A true mechanism must 
describe a series of metalorganic entities that transform n-butane to maleic 
anhydride. The molecules listed in Table 2 are likely the products of decom- 
position (not of desorption) of the real intermediate. 
Ziolkowski et al.’OJ1 elaborated a crystallographic model of active sites 
(CMAS) which provided a geometric and energetic map of the each exposed 
face of the vanadylpyrophosphate using length, strength, and energy of metal- 
oxygen bonds. According to their model, after the dehydrogenation step 
(through hydrogen abstraction from the Cl-C4 positions), strong 
carbonium-oxygen bonds form with the oxygen of the catalyst. Schifltt et 
al.52J3 
report that 2,Sdihydrofuran is adsorbed sharing its oxygen with surface 
vanadium. These adsorbed species may constitute the precursors of butadiene 
and furan. 
There are few indications about the mechanism of formation of carbon oxides. 
On the basis of kinetic studies, it has been suggested that the formation of COX 
comes from both parallel and consecutive 
reactions, the latter involving maleic 
anhydride? 
Two different reaction patterns can be proposed: 
A more general 
(Xi represents the several intermediates): 
mbutane +Xi -+ 
rnaleic anhydride + 
COX 
A more simple one54: 
mbutane -e 
Xi + 
rnaleic anhydride + 
COX 
In the first mechanism COX 
forms at all stages, while in the second one it only 
forms from n-butane. Experiments done by poisoning a selective catalyst have shown that 
the parallel routes to carbon oxides mainly involve a direct attack to n-butane (tests were 
carried out at such conditions 
to achieve 50 to 80 percent n-butane conver~ion).~~ 
In fact, 
by adding ammonia in the gas phase during the n-butane oxidation or by adding alkaline 
metals to the catalyst, the sites responsible for the formation of maleic anhydride are 
selectively destroyed (see Figure 7). The formation of COX 
is also decreased, but at a 
much lower extent. This decrease may be due to the lower rate of consecutive maleic 
anhydride combustion. In another experiment (Figure 8), it has been shown that the 
addition of SO, in the gas phase has no influence on the activity and selectivity at low 
conversion but does decrease the extent of decomposition of maleic anhydride at high 
conversion.M

Therefore, for a selective cata- 
lyst (yielding maleic anhydride with 80 
percent selectivity until 70 percent 
conversion) 
there are two different sites 
responsible for the formation of carbon 
oxides: a site of direct n-butane com- 
bustion, and a second one of decom- 
position of 
maleic 
These sites are different from those 
involved in the selective reaction 
mechanism. 
These findings clearly indicate 
the extraordinary specificity of the 
selective sites. In fact, notwithstanding 
the fact that maleic anhydride forms 
through several steps, all of them 
present a selectivity close to 
100 
percent, and this is extraordinary for a 
selective oxidation. Indeed, no single 
oxidation is known to exhibit such a 
high selectivity.' 
This high selectivity of each 
single step may be related to the lack of 
desorption of intermediates, as well as 
to a very peculiar topology of the active sites. These sites may be located close to that 
where n-butane is adsorbed (or activated), and are characterized by the fact that all those 
necessary for the maleic anhydride synthesis are nearby, and specifically address the 
reaction from adsorbed n-butane to the final product. 
Lashier et al?' reached the same conclusion by studying the oxidation of n-butane 
with '*O-labeled V-P 
catalysts. They found two types of unselective sites, one responsible 
for a parallel reaction of n-butane degradation and one responsible for the consecutive 
overoxidation of maleic anhydride. They proposed that the parallel reaction is the 
formation of C, 
and C
,
 hydrocarbons, through C-C bond cleavage via a cracking-type 
reaction. These fragments are then oxidized to carbon oxides. 
2.4 Model of the Surface of (VO),P,O,. - 
Before discussing the nature of the active 
sites, it is necessary to draw a model of the surface, developed on the basis of the three 
main observations that have generally been accepted: 
Only the diffraction lines typical of the (VO),P,O, have been detected by 
XRD analysis in the active and selective spent catalysts,

however, that the presence of a multiphase system is related to an

Other modelsaJu339 that take into consideration the presence of more phases 
interacting with the vanadylpyrophosphate will not be considered here because they do not 
represent the real situation of an active and selective catalyst. These models very likely 
are more important in understanding the formation and deactivation of the active phase, 
the activity of fresh catalyst, and the mechanism of total oxidation of n-butane.

Thompson61 
reminded us to pay heed also to the considerable confusion that is 
found in the literature in the discussion of XRD patterns of the catalyst and of the crystal 
structure 
of the vanadylpyrophosphate. In particular, it is not accurate to refer to the (100) 
plane as 
being the active surface. As suggested by Thompson,61 
a crystallographic 
cut of 
this plane would not provide a chemically meaningful or neutral surface. Therefore, the 
correct terminology should be that the different models of the surface of vanadyl- 
pyrophosphate derive from the cutting of planes parallel to (100). This will be 
the type 
of approach we shall use here. 
At least four different 
truncations, 
designated 
A, B, C, and D, parallel to the (100) 
plane can be envisaged. 
In type A truncation only vanadium species are present on the surface. According 
to Ebner and Thompson: this situation is the least probable because phosphorus 
in excess 
of stoichiometric amount is always present in optimal catalyst compositions and, in 
addition, in many patents cofeeding 
of volatile phosphorus compounds with the reactants 
is also claimed to be necessary in order to have stable active and selective catalysts. 
Ebner and Thompson3* 
and Thompson and Ebner62 
also pointed out that a situation 
such as 
the type A truncation, with a surface 
of free vanadium ions, must be characterized 
by high activity and low selectivity, 
in agreement with the catalytic behavior of V-P based 
catalysts with a P/V ratio lower than 1.0. 
In type B truncation, the model preferred by Ebner and Thompson?* the surface 
terminates with pendant groups of pyrophosphate, which surround two couples of

vanadium ions. In each couple, constituted of two octahedral sharing comers, one 
vanadium terminates with a double bonded oxygen; the second vanadium is present on the 
surface with unsaturated coordination, and its V=O 
bond is projected toward the internal 
part of the crystal. In this type 
of truncation vanadium ions exist on the surface isolated 
from other groups of vanadium ions, and they are localized inside a cavity or cleft in the 
walls formed by phosphorus ions. 
In type C 
truncation the termination is with orthophosphate groups. In this case 
active sites are isolated, but the vanadium ions are more easily accessible from the gas 
phase than with the type B truncation. The surface terminates in a way similar to that of 
vanadium (V) phosphate. This situation has a higher probability of occurring than type 
A truncation and might contribute to the formation of discrete V5+ 
species62 
or of a V5+ 
phosphate?' 
Type D 
truncation occurs in the presence of more condensed forms of phosphate 
ions, such as in inactive V0(P03)3;26 
this situation will occur when considerable excess 
of phosphorus is present. 
The maximum yields in 
maleic anhydride are plotted in 
Figure 10 as functions of the 
P/V ratio,44 which also shows 
the different types of truncation. 
The truncation on the surface 
varies from type A to B, to C, 
and to D as the bulk P/V ratio 
increases. A and D truncations 
may represent the surface at low 
and high P/V ratio, respectively. 
At present it is not possible to 
attribute the observed maximum 
in the yield to a specific type of 
lattice truncation: either to type 
B truncation, in agreement with 
that suggested by Ebner and 
Thompson,3' or to type C, as 
suggested by Kubias et al.,37 or 
rather to both of them. In fact, 
the presence of both types of 
truncation means the presence of 
both @ 
and V5+ 
species on the 
surface.

Another aspect to discuss is the role of defects observed in the structure of a non- 
equilibrated catalyst prepared in an organic medium. 
It has been claimed2 that the most active vanadylpyrophosphate is the one 
possessing a defective structure, as deduced by the line broadening of some reflections in 
XRD patterns; in particular, a high value of the breadth-to-height ratio for the (200) 
reflection is considered to be important. Indeed, this ratio has been taken as a measure of 
defectivity. 
According to Thompson et al.35 and Thompson,6l this line broadening is not of 
much value. In fact, it does not depend on vanadium atom disorder, but rather might be 
due to more subtle variations in the position of oxygen atoms. However, line broadening 
has been observed in fresh samples but not in equilibrated ones.36 Perhaps the defects 
responsible for the line broadening are involved in facilitating the formation of the 
vanadylpyrophosphate from the precursor. 
Indeed, in single crystal studies two classes of reflections are found to be 
broadened; these are systematic effects for the entire groups of (even-even-odd) and 
(even-odd-odd) (hkl) values in the setting Pca2' and are due to "Linear 
Disorder," such as 
metal atoms columnar disorder. On the contrary, the (200) reflection is invariant with 
respect to this kind of 
The columnar order in vanadyl columns for the two polytypes of the (V0)2P20, 
is displayed in Figure 5?5 
The consequences of this type of different order for the 
vanadium columns on the description of the model of the surface are not yet clear. 
However, it can be expected that this type of disorder may affect the catalytic behavior in 
the case where more than one couple of vanadium ions is involved in the mechanism of 
selective oxidation,

most acid sites are 
of the Lewis type, and according to other authod3 
the number 
of Lewis sites is twice that of the Bronsted sites. For catalysts prepared in an organic 
medium, the Lewis sites are stronger than those observed for catalysts prepared in an 
aqueous medium. This difference has been attributed to the presence of vanadium ions 
with unsaturated coordinative sites present at the cleavage of the planes parallel to the 
(100). It has been claimed that the disorder in the (100) plane is responsible for the 
increase in Lewis acidity of these types of vanadium sites? 
Other types of unsaturated vanadium ions can exist at the comers of the crystallites, 
due to the loosening of phosphorus ions along with formation of oxygen vacancies.16 
Lewis sites can be related to both V5+ 
and Vet ~pecies.3~ 
It has been proposed2 
that the role of Lewis sites is to abstract, simultaneously with 
a basic oxygen, two hydrogens from the two CH, groups of n-butane via a concerted

however, a part of the surface vanadium can be oxidized. In fact, a reproducible average 
valence of vanadium in the range 4.001 to 4.04 has been detected on spent catalysts. 
According to Ebner and Thompson?8 the average valence of 4.03 can be justified by the 
oxidation of 50 percent of the surface V4+. V5+ species have also been detected by 
31P-NMR 
spectro~copy,5~~~ 
as well as 
by the triangular ammonia pulse technique." With 
the latter technique, a V
5
'
 amount ranging from 20 to 100 percent of the total surface 
vanadium species has been detected for different preparations or different dopings of 
(VOhP,O,. 
Okuhara and Misono'2 reported that no V5+ 
species are present at the surface, 
even at conditions at which maleic anhydride is burnt. Zhang et a.167 found that V5+ 
species are present outside the structure as y-vanadium phosphate, or a
s
 
discrete vanadium 
species strongly interacting with the vanadylpyrophosphate along the (100) plane; these 
species are responsible for oxygen insertion reactions. 
According to Ebner and 
V5+ ions are involved in cleaving the C-H bond of n-butane. 
Cavani et al.28744 
have concluded that w=O)~' groups are involved in oxygen 
insertion reactions and in total oxidation; the yield of maleic anhydride is a function of the 
V5+-to-V4+ 
ratio of the catalyst (Figure 12). Schiett et al?253 have hypothesized that this 
species is involved in the formation of a five-membered ring with butadiene. 
Ebner and Thompson38 and Schiatt and J!i5rgensed2 have 
suggested that the + 
species are also involved in oxygen insertion reaction upon 
butadiene, with the formation of five-membered ring entities. 
Okuhara and Misono12 suggested that the site pair (V=O)2+-O-V4+ 
is involved in 
n-butane oxidation (specification of their role was not given). It has also been suggested 
that V02' species are 
involved in allylic oxidation reactions.2 
According to Matsuura and Yama~aki?~ 
these sites are involved in hydrogen 
abstraction. 
Ziolkowski et al?05' reported that the activation of n-butane consists of the 
abstraction of a first H from each methyl group, concerted with the formation of two very 
V4+=0 species.

five-membered ring species. 
By 
studying the oxidation of n-butane 
with catalysts that contained labeled 
oxygen, Lashier et al.57 
and Lashier 
and Schradera also concluded that these types of bonds are involved in H abstraction from 
n-butane and in oxygen insertion reactions. The concerted mechanism proposed by Lashier

Adsorbed molecular oxygen. Two types of adsorbed molecular oxygen species

According to Schigtt et aLS2 the role of the peroxo species is to oxidize the 2,5- 
dihydrofuran to a 2-hydroxy derivative of the dihydrofuran, to the lactone and finally to 
maleic anhydride. 
Gleaves et al.& have concluded that adsorbed oxygen species are responsible for 
oxygen insertion reactions on furan; this was hypothesized on the basis of the results 
obtained in the oxidation of n-butane with a TAP reactor in the presence and in the 
absence of molecular oxygen.

presence of oxygen. On the other hand, adsorbed molecular oxygen might play a role in 
the unselective oxidations, or in the reoxidation of reduced catalyst. 
By investigation of the oxidation of n-butane with 1802, 
Okuhara and Misono'2 have confirmed previous findings2 that only near-surface lattice 
oxygen is involved in the mechanism of maleic anhydride formation; 
this suggests that an 
isolation of the surface from the bulk may exist (no oxygen mobility). 
Vanadium ion couples on the surface are isolated from each other, due to the 
presence of the phosphorus tetrahedra. Therefore any adsorbed molecule of n-butane must 
find all the oxygen necessary in the close neighborhood of the adsorption site, but likely 
not in sufficient abundance to cause the overoxidation of maleic anhydride. The isolation 
of sites can be an additional factor of selectivity, as suggested by Grasselli@ for the 
oxidation of several hydrocarbons.28

and the corresponding elementary steps that are involved.

A recent review by Hut~hings~~ 
dealt with a complete description of promoters for 
V-P-based catalysts. The 
main conclusions of this review can be categorized by the two 
types of promoters that exist: 
Those that enable the formation of the required V-P phase avoiding the 
formation of spwious phases, and 
Those 
that form solid solutions with the active phase and that regulate the 
catalytic activity.

 mechanism of the promotional effect and the role of promoters in controlling the 
catalyst oxidation state and surface segregation of phases. In particular, the role of 
additives in influencing the morphology and defects of the precursors and active phase, as 
well as 
its surface area, is not clear. 
Only papers published after the review of Hutchings will be taken into 
consideration here and their examination provides good examples of the problems that are 
still present in identifying the role of additives on the catalytic behavior of (VO),P,O,.

Catalysis 
The data reported are emblematic of the type of modifications observed when other 
elements are added to the (VO),P207 (the same type of effects has also been observed in 
many previous patents and papers). 
Figure 15 shows that 
The selectivity 
of undoped catalyst is lower than the value of 70 to 80 percent 
reported in the literature for optimal (VO)2P207 (and maintained until 80 
percent conversion). In addition, a selectivity/conversion or yield/conversion 
plot should have been better to discriminate 
the effects of additives on parallel 
and consecutive reactions of combustion. 
The increase in selectivity by the addition of cobalt occurred with a 
simultaneous decrease in activity. Therefore, it is difficult to state that a real 
improvement in catalytic behavior has been observed with the addition of 
cobalt. 
However, it is useful to underline the modifications observed by the authors in the 
catalyst after addition of cobalt by both methods. 
For Co content higher than 0.15 atomic percent a new phase, Co2P2O,, together 
with (VO)2P207, 
has been observed by XRD analysis. After the cobalt addition, a surface 
enrichment of phosphorus also has been observed by XPS analysis that correlates with the 
increase in selectivity. 
Up to the surface 
P/V ratio 1.7 the selectivity increases along with strong acid sites, 
while for higher values of P/V the concentration of strong acid sites reaches a plateau and 
the selectivity starts to decrease. The increase in selectivity with increasing concentration 
of strong acid sites has been attributed to the easier desorption of maleic anhydride from 
the surface (that limits its overoxidation), while no explanation has been given for the 
decrease in selectivity when the P/V ratio is higher than 1.7. 
A further significant role of the addition of cobalt has been observed on the 
stability of the catalyst. Analysis of undoped catalyst in the hot-spot region showed a loss 
of phosphorus after 500 hours time-on-stream, while no loss of phosphorus was observed 
in catalysts that contained cobalt. 
The authors attributed the reduction of phosphorus losses to the formation of cobalt 
pyrophosphate highly dispersed in the bulk of the catalyst, 
filling the micropore voids and 
macrodefects and hindering the phosphorus transport from bulk to surface and from the 
surface to the gas phase. 
Bej and Rao71 have compared the catalytic behavior of unpromoted V-P catalysts 
with that of Ce- and Mo-promoted V-P catalysts. The catalyst investigated had a P/V ratio 
of 1.08 and Ce/V and Mo/V atomic ratios of 0.02 and 0.06, respectively. 
Yields versus conversion are reported in Figure 16 for the unpromoted and 
promoted catalysts (the data were obtained by increasing both contact time and 
temperature). The promoted catalysts are less active than the unpromoted ones; the former 
reach the same level of conversion at longer contact time or higher temperature. At low

the 
unpromoted 
and 
promoted catalysts exhibit the same 
selectivity. 
Considerable differences 
are instead present at high conversion 
where the promoted catalyst exhibits a 
higher maximum yield. Furthermore, 
the unpromoted catalyst shows a 
remarkable decrease of 
the yield 
approaching total n-butane conversion. 
It is possible to conclude that 
promoted 
catalysts 
maintain 
high 
selectivity in more severe conditions by 
decreasing the combustion of maleic 
anhydride. Centi et al.54 
proposed that 
the combustion of maleic anhydride 
occurs on sites different from those that 
are responsible for its formation. The

 same effects, observed due to the 
addition of Ce and Mo ions, have been 
found with the addition of SO, in the 
gas phase or by increasing the P/V 
ratio. 
However, different explanations 
have been given for this effect. Centi 
et 
that the higher de- 
composition of maleic anhydride is due 
to the presence of excess V5+, 
which is 
decreased either by the addition of SO, 
or by increasing the P/V ratio. According to Bej and Rao:* 
instead, the role of Mo6+ 
is 
to reduce the amount of V3+ 
(which is responsible for maleic anhydride decomposition) 
through the redox couple Mo6+ 
+ V3+ + 
V4+ + Mo5+ 
(followed by the quick reoxidation 
of Mo5+ 
by air). 
A comparative study of the role of the addition of Zn, Ti, and Zr on V-P catalysts 
(P/V=l.O) has been carried out by Sananes et al.72 The conversion and selectivity obtained 
at the same level of temperature are reported in Figures 17 and 18 as functions of the 
amount of the three additives. 
The temperature where 20 percent yield of maleic anhydride was obtained for the 
best composition of each promoter and the maximum yield for unpromoted and promoted 
catalysts are reported in Figure 19. There are optimal amounts of each dopant that 
increase the catalytic activity (Figures 17 and 19). This allows the catalyst to operate at

lower temperatures and achieve higher maximum yield (Figure 19), even though the 
selectivity to maleic anhydride is generally lowered when the promoter is added. 
However, the activity of the unpromoted catalyst is extraordinarily low (more active 
unpromoted catalysts have been reported in the literature). The action of additives is very 
subtle because a very precise small amount is necessary, otherwise 
they can act as 
poisons. 
The authors

modifications and on catalytic activity of (VO)2P207. 
The authors also reported, for 
comparison, the modifications observed in unpromoted catalysts due only to changes in 
the preparation method. The reaction temperature at which a value for a fixed rate of 
n-butane oxidation and the values of selectivity obtained at 30 percent conversion are 
reported in Figure 20 for two undoped catalysts prepared with a different procedure and

the same type 
of promotion can be obtained by changing the method of preparation.

Catalysis 
Surface area, 
The higher activity has been attributed to the increased exposure of the (100) 
plane, 
the greater number of (V=0)3' sites and increased defectivity; the higher selectivity has 
been attributed to the increased (100) plane exposure. 
These recent results also provide a key to interpret the effects of additives 
previously published. In fact, the changes in catalytic behavior due to the additives are 
of the same order and type 
as 
those related to different methods of preparation. Therefore, 
the question 
of whether the role of additives is only to influence the method of preparation, 
to modify the surface and bulk P/V ratio, or to directly modify the active sites is still open. 
Meisel et al." recently prepared catalysts in an aqueous solvent and studied the 
influence of the addition of sulfuric acid on the crystallization of (VO)HPO,.O.SH,O.

 found that up to 10 percent sulfur can enter the structure of the precursor by 
substituting 
for phosphorus anions. Calcination at high temperature resulted in the removal 
of a considerable part of the sulfur from the structure. Line broadening of the (100) 
reflection (in relation to the [024] reflection), as 
well as a shift of its position in the pattern 
(corresponding to a lattice expansion), was observed only at low amounts of sulfur content 
(SOz-/V 
0.007). At higher sulfur contents the XRD pattern became similar to that of 
unpromoted catalysts. Therefore, it seems that sulfur ions are able to modify the catalyst 
obtained by the preparation in an aqueous medium, leading to catalysts more similar to 
those prepared in organic solvent. Indeed, sulfur-promoted 
catalysts have shown very high 
activity and selectivity (53 
percent yield, similar to the values obtained with catalysts 
prepared in organic solvent). 
A similar 
effect in the preparation in organic 
media has been observed by Horowitz 
et al." by adding ethylorthosilicate 
in order to eliminate the water formed as a result of 
the reduction of V

'
.
 
Greater line broadening of the basal planes reflections and a more 
defective structure were found for both the precursor and the active phase, especially for 
preparation at higher P/V 
ratios. 
In conclusion, the additives (or promoters) can be divided into the following three 
groups: 
Ions that interact with free phosphoric acid acting as a tool of fine tuning of 
the optimal surface P/V 
ratio and acidity. These ions are the basic ions such 
as Zn and Co and they can also act in avoiding the migration and loss of 
phosphorus. 
Ions that can substitute 
for phosphorus in the precursor, such as S and Si. The 
partial or total elimination of these ions by calcination from the vanadyl- 
pyrophosphate structure influences the morphology and defects of (V0)2P20,.

Indeed they may have the same role as that proposed for benzyl alcohol 
trapped inside the structure of the precursor. 
Transition element ions that substitute for vanadium acting as 
real modifiers 
of the reaction pattern, forming a stable solid solution and possibly being 
directly involved in the reaction pattern. The existence of this type of 
promotion is not yet well clarified. The effect observed by the addition of Ti,

2.7 Conclusions. - 
After our previous review in 1988: many papers have appeared in 
scientific literature dealing with the properties of the (V0bP2O, catalyst and with the 
mechanism of n-butane oxidation. In the meantime, many new plants have been built, 
with the catalyst that is yet based essentially on crystalline vanadylpyrophosphate (with 
small amounts of additives). However, many a
s
p
e
c
t
s
 of the chemistry involved in this 
catalytic reaction are yet unclear, and many properties of the catalyst still have to be 
improved. 
The points that need further investigation follow: 
Preparation of the catalyst. The preparation is yet too complicated for an 
industrial application, with many problems of corrosion and/or organic waste treatment. 
In addition, in the preparation in organic solvent (the preferred one) the introduction of 
other elements inside the structure of the precursor is rather difficult because the latter is 
formed by reaction between a solid and a liquid, and not by coprecipitation which occurs 
in the aqueous preparation. 
Finally, the scaleup of such preparation, involving a 
solidfliquid reaction, is not an easy t
a
s
k
.
 
Activation. The dehydration of the precursor to the active phase does not seem 
to be a toptactic transformation (therefore, it is not automatic or facile) as 
it does occur 
through the formation of an 
amorphous 
phase from which several routes start, taking either 
to the active phase or to other spurious phases. The chemistry of transformation of this 
amorphous intermediate phase is yet unclear, and not easily controlled, above all in 
industrial batches. 
Aging of the activated catalyst. In order to reach good catalytic performances, 
a long aging (about 20 days) of the catalyst in the presence of the reactant mixture is 
necessary. The transformations that occur during this 
treatment are not clear; indeed, the 
possibility of finding a quicker aging procedure would be of much interest for the industry. 
Catalyst deactivation. Industrial catalysts 
deactivate quickly during the time-on- 
stream, and many regeneration procedures have been proposed (addition of phosphorus or 
halogen compounds, batch-wise reduction, continuous addition of H202). An open 
question is whether this deactivation is due to overoxidation and/or phosphorus migration, 
or to other factors. Also, the real mechanism by which these regeneration procedures have 
a beneficial effect is not understood.

oxides. The catalyst produces a high amount of carbon 
oxides; the best achieved yield is the 56 percent, with 70 percent of selectivity at 80 
percent n-butane conversion. The nature of the sites responsible for the COX 
formation has 
been the subject of very few investigations. 
Mechanism and nature of active sites. Many mechanisms for the formation of 
maleic anhydride have been proposed, and many different active sites have been 
hypothesized, but without any real identification and characterization of these sites. 
Role of promoters. The possibility of achieving stationary conditions (high 
selectivity and productivity) within shorter time-on-stream will very likely be 
realized by 
the discovery of the right additives, and of the right method for their introduction inside 
the structure or on the surface of the (VO),P,O,, as 
well as of a suitable support. The 
interpretation of the effect of additives given in literature is not univocal, also because the 
control of their amount is critical. Higher amounts can have a detrimental effect. Tine 
change of the catalytic properties occurring during activation, aging, and time-on-stream 
may change the effect of the dopant from a promoting to a detrimental one. Furthermore, 
it cannot be 
excluded that the promoting effect at bench-scale level disappears or becomes 
a detrimental effect at pilot-plant scale level. 
The existence of so many unresolved aspects 
of the n-butane oxidation is due 
essentially to two reasons: 
Few 
in situ characterizations 
haye been done. However, the known difficulties 
of the in situ characterization are enhanced here because the slow step of the 
reaction is the n-butane activation, and all the other steps are very quick. 
Therefore, the amount of the intermediates on the surface is very low, and their 
lifetime is very short. 
The effective catalyst was not investigated. In fact, many of the unresolved 
aspects 
are 
related to the properties of the catalyst for the industrial production. 
The peculiar features of this catalyst that need activation and aging, as 
well as 
continuous and batchwise regeneration, have made the catalyst precursor the 
object of several investigations, rather than the actual, equilibrated catalyst. 
In conclusion, we are 
not far from the truth when we say that in n-butane oxidation 
we are at the same level of comprehension as scientists were at the end of the 1960s for 
the hydrodesulphurization reaction, when the oxidic precursor rather than the actual 
sulfided catalyst w

3 The Oxidative Dehydrogenation of n-Butane 
3.1 Introduction. - 
The introduction of double bonds into saturated hydrocarbons or into 
saturated parts of functionalized hydrocarbons has been the object of investigation since 
the 1940s. Besides the steam-cracking of petroleum, the processes of dehydrogenation of 
n-butane or n-butenes became major sources of olefins. Later on, during the 1960s,

processes were developed that utilized the oxidative dehydrogenation of butenes. In 
addition to the hydrocarbon, the process feed stream also contained an hydrogen-acceptor 
molecular oxygen and steam. 
The addition of the oxidant transforms the reaction from a thermodynamically 
limited, endothermic one to an irreversible exothermic one. This results in high energy 
savings due to decreased energy input, lower operating temperature, and heat recovery. 
In addition, the presence of an oxidant species lowers the formation of coke considerably, 
increasing the catalyst lifetime; from this point of view, the less severe reaction conditions 
also are beneficial. At the same time, the reaction conditions have to be chosen properly 
in order to avoid the formation of byproducts such as carbon oxides or partially oxidized 
byproducts. Also, the commercial value of byproducts is rather low, if compared to the 
high valuable hydrogen coproduced in conventional dehydrogenation. Finally, explosion 
hazards arise when feeding oxygen. 
Other hydrogen acceptors such as halogens have been utilized instead of molecular 
oxygen.75 In the Idas process, developed by Shell, I, was fed to the reactor together with 
the hydrocarbon and was then regenerated by treatment with oxygen. Butane and butenes 
could be converted to butadiene with good selectivity. The process, however, was never 
commercialized due to corrosion problems and the loss of high value iodine, which could 
not be completely recovered and recycled. 
An alternative proce~s’~,~~ 
consists of carrying out the dehydrogenation over 
conventional supported Pt/Sn catalysts, with the addition of controlled amounts of 
molecular oxygen, to oxidize selectively the H, formed; a suitable catalyst, selective for 
H2 combustion, can also be utilized. In this way, it is possible to release the heat of the 
exothermic oxidation €or carrying out the endothermic dehydrogenation, and the high 
selectivity typical of the dehydrogenation can be coupled to the advantages of the 
exothermic oxidation, 
Most work has been done on the oxydehydrogenation 
of n-butane in the presence 
of molecular oxygen. The following sections will examine 
the different 
classes of catalysts 
described in the scientific and patent literature. 
3.2 Catalyst Compositions. - 
The classes of catalysts that have been described as 
active 
and selective for the oxydehydrogenation of n-butane are 
Metal femtes; 
Supported vanadium oxide; 
Vanadates, especially magnesium vanadate; 
Metal molybdates; and 
Nickel oxide-based systems.

or Mn femtes, mixed with the corresponding divalent metal oxides. In addition to the 
hydrocarbon and molecular oxygen, halogens also were fed into the reactor.78 
Recently, zinc femtes have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative 
dehydrogenation of n-butane to 01efins.~~ 
Table 6 shows the distribution of products at 
similar n-butane conversion, 
for different catalysts containing ZnFe204 
with either excess 
zinc (present as 
ZnO), or excess iron (as or-F%03). The highest selectivity 
to butenes was 
obtained over the pure femte, which behaved quite similarly to pure ZnO, also giving high 
amounts of cracking products. The presence of two phases (the ferrite plus either ZnO or 
Fe2O,) led to an increase in the selectivity to butadiene, and also a considerable increase 
in the formation of carbon oxides. 
The observed behavior was correlated to the lattice oxygen reactivity. In particular, 
the femte surface was hypothesized to possess cation vacancy sites,80 able to abstract 
protons from the alkane, but not to convert the olefin to the diolefin. In the double-phase 
catalysts, more selective to both butadiene and carbon oxides, temperature-programmed 
reaction (TPR) and Mossbauer spectroscopy indicated the presence of an electronic 
interaction between the ferrite and the second metal oxide, which modified the electron 
density of the iron nucleus of ZnFe204.

Supported Vanadium 
Oxide. - 
The first patent dealing with the utilization of 
supported vanadium oxide for n-butane oxydehydrogenation was reported in 1975.8' The 
support was silica, and the catalyst contained 9 wt% of V20,, as well as a very large 
amount of K2S04 (close to 30 percent). It was reported that at temperatures higher than 
500 O

 with GHSV 20,000 h-', 25 percent n-butane conversion could be achieved, with 
selectivity to olefins (butenes plus butadiene) in the range of 60 to 90 percent.

Selective Oxidations of 
C, Parafins

1 
More recently, a few papers have been published about the utilization of supported 
and unsupported vanadium oxide for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane.82-84 
The 
strong interaction between vanadia and the support 
led to highly dispersed vanadia species 
at loadings below a monolayer equivalent. These sites possess a reactivity (i.e., high 
activity and peculiar selectivity) toward the paraffin different from that of bulk vanadium 
oxide. 
While unsupported 
vanadia did not yield dehydrogenated 
products, silica-supported 
vanadium oxide (1 wt%) led to high selectivity to olefins (with prevailing formation of 
butenes). Higher amounts of vanadia caused a decrease in the selectivity 
(due to increased 
levels of combustion) and a remarkable increase in the activity. This trend was obtained 
with different silica supports, 
contaminated with various amounts of alkali metals. Alkali 
metals added to the dispersed vanadium phase generally decreased the catalytic activity. 
Figure 21 plots the effect of vanadia loading on the distribution of the products.

activity per vanadium atom), but the 
selectivity to olefin decreased. In 
addition, the formation of acetic 
acid and maleic anhydride was also 
observed, with an overall selectivity 
around 15 percent. 
The authors 
hypothesized that isolated vanadia 
species in the submonolayer region 
were less active than networks of 
vanadia, but more selective toward 
the olefin. This different behavior 
was proposed to come from the 
different extent of reduction of the 
vanadium ions in the two different 
environments.

low vanadia loading chemical interaction with the alumina, or the formation of a 
well-dispersed

 Metal Vanadates. 
- 
Among the catalysts that have recently been receiving much 
attention for the synthesis of olefins from C3 and C4 paraffins are the magnesium 
~anadates.8~-~ 
These materials have been shown to be active and selective, even though 
butenes rather than butadiene are preferentially formed. 
Most of the published work on metal vanadates for n-butane oxydehydrogenation 
has been published by Kung and coworkers. These authors tested different metal 
vanadates and correlated the selectivity to dehydrogenated products with the ease of 
reduction of the divalent metal. A 
direct correlation was found be- 
tween the selectivity to olefins and 
the aqueous reduction potential of 
the divalent or trivalent cation, as 
shown in Figure 22; when the latter 
increased, the onset temperature for 
reduction of the vanadate (in TPR 
measurements) 
decreased. This was 
interpreted by assuming that the 
oxygen species involved in the 
selectivity-determining step was 
lattice oxygen, as was also demon- 
strated by pulse tests. The selectiv- 
ity of the reaction was proposed to 
be conditioned by the competition 
between two processes: C-H bond 
breaking of the intermediate (lead- 
ing to the dehydrogenation product) 
and C-0 bond formation, leading to 
the production of 
an oxygen- 
containing species, precursor o

and of the extent of reduction of the oxide at steady-state conditions on the catalytic 
performance was also confirmed on different rare earth or tho van ad ate^^^*^^: NdVO,, 
EuV04, SmV04. 
Among the different metal vanadates, magnesium vanadate was the most selective 
to olefins. More specifically, the orthovanadate Mg,V208 was more selective than the 
pyrovanadate Mg2V207 
and the methavanadate MgV206.w'91 This was attributed to the 
presence of V-0-V pairs (and also short V=O bonds) in the latter structures. The oxygen 
in these bonds is more easily removed than in the case of Mg-0-V, because V5+ 
ions are 
more reducible. Indeed, the reducibility of V5+ 
ions in the pyrovanadates was found to be 
similar to that in V205. This is consistent with the fact that the two oxides exhibited 
similar catalytic performance. 
However, this structure-sensitivity 
was found to be rather unique for n-butane and 
did not apply in the case of propane oxydehydrogenation. In fact, the oxidation of propane 
occurred in the same way over both ortho- and pyro-magnesium vanadates. According to 
the authors, this is due to the ability of n-butane to react simultaneously with two adjacent 
comer-sharing VO, units in pyrophosphate, giving rise to a precursor of COX 
formation. 
Isolated units in the orthophosphate lead instead to a more selective ~ a t a l y s t . 8 ~ ~ * ~ * ~ ~  
With 
propane, a shorter molecule, the presence of either adjacent or isolated VO, units, instead, 
is not important for the catalytic performance. 
The comparison of the catalytic performance in n-butane oxydehydrogenation 
obtained over different Mg vanadates is reported in Figure 23,91 
showing the superior 
performance of the Mg orthovanadate.

Catalysis 
The absence of oxygenated compounds over Mg/V/O systems was correlated by 
the authors to the basicity of these materials, which favored the rapid desorption of the 
olefins formed and limited the consecutive oxidation to maleic anhydride or to other 
oxygen-containing compounds.90 Alternatively, the phenomenon was attributed to the 
absence of V5+=0 
bonds in Mg orthovanadate. In agreement with this hypothesis, these 
sites have been proposed to be responsible for the consecutive oxidation of intermediate 
butenes and butadiene to maleic anhydride in the n-butane selective oxidation with V/P/O 
catalysts. In the case of V,O,, 
instead, the high surface density of V=O bonds is 
responsible for the preferential COX 
formation from n-butane. 
Figure 24 shows the C4 
conversion and the selectivity to olefins as 
functions of the reaction temperature for four 
different compositions, 
containing increasing 
Mg3V208/Mg0 
ratios. The samples were thus

formation of the orthovanadate. All samples showed comparable selectivity to the olefins

(butenes plus butadiene), but the 
activity was different; the lowest 
activity was in fact exhibited by the 
sample containing almost only 
Mg3V208. The presence of excess 
MgO increases 
the catalytic 
activity; 
the most active catalyst was that 
containing 60 
wt% MgO. Because 
pure MgO is less active than these 
catalysts, as well as quite unselec- 
tive (due to formation of both CO, 
and cracking 
products), it seems that 
some synergetic effect between the 
MgO and the Mg orthovanadate 
must occur. This effect is maxi- 
mum when the two phases are 
present in an almost equivalent 
amount in the catalyst. 
The figure also shows that 
the selectivity to olefins was rather 
constant with increasing reaction 
temperature, and thus with the 
n-butane conversion. On the con-

conversion. On the other hand, the ratio between butene and butadiene decreased with 
increasing conversion, and this suggests a mechanism where butadiene is preferentially, 
but not exclusively, formed consecutively from the intermediate butene. 
The promotion of Mg/V/O systems with other oxides, such as 
Cr203, MOO,, TiO,, 
has been recently reported.94 The addition of Cr2O3 or MOO, to a Mg/V/O catalyst 
containing 24 wt% V205 
(so as to have a V/dopant atomic ratio 10/1) led to an increase 
in the activity, while TiO, improved the selectivity 
to the olefins. A catalyst incorporating 
both Cr203 
and TiO, gave the best overall performance, with a maximum yield of 35 
to 
36 percent at 57 percent n-butane conversion, at 570 O

,

The 
improvement was attributed to the basic nature of TiO,, favoring 
desorption of the olefins 
and thus avoiding their combustion. On the contrary, the acidic nature of MOO, had a 
negative effect on the selectivity. 
The authors generally obtained, on both promoted and unpromoted systems, a 
continuous decrease in selectivity with conversion at increasing temperatures, contrary to 
that observed by Kung et a185-93

cobalt and nickel molybdates, have been recognized as 
good catalysts for this reaction.

while for lower temperatures the selectivity was lowered 
due to the formation of oxygenated products, and at higher temperatures of COX 
and 
cracking products. The oxygen-to-hydrocarbon 
ratio also affected the selectivity, and the 
best performance was obtained for ratios lower than stoichiometric for butadiene. 
Cobalt molybdates have also been reported to be active .catalysts for this 
reaction.'m-'02 CoMo04 crystallizes in two forms, a low-temperature one (a-phase), 
where both metals have 6-fold coordination, and a high-temperature form (the 6-phase), 
where molybdenum atoms are arranged in tetrahedra with the oxygen atoms, while the 
cobalt atoms have octahedral coordination. This latter structure is metastable at room 
temperature and is partly converted to the a form. 
The high-temperature crystalline 
form of cobalt molybdate (the 6-phase) proved to 
be selective to olefins from n-butane when the paraffin conversion was maintained below 
20 percent; steam was also fed to the reactor. Higher conversions led to a fall in 
selectivity because of COX 
formation. An excess of MOO, led to a decrease in selectivity, 
have also been tested.

with increasing 
n-butane conversion. Thus, these catalysts are suitable for operations 
with 
low oxygen-to-hydrocarbon ratios, where oxygen is the limiting reactant, with possible 
recycling the unconverted paraffin.

procedure, where n-butane and oxygen are alternatively fed 
to the reactor, loaded with a MgMoO, catalyst. This operation has the following 
advantages: (1) intrinsically safe operation, and (2) a high selectivity to olefins, due to the 
absence of molecular oxygen in the gas phase. The n-butane thus reacts with the lattice 
oxygen, and the catalyst is reduced. Subsequently, 
molecular oxygen restores the oxidized

catalyst surface; the oxygen also removes the carbon formed during contact with the 
hydrocarbon. 
This kind of operation, with continuous cycles of reaction and regeneration, 
requires the use of mobile or fluidized catalytic beds, in riser-type reactors where the 
catalyst is continuously transported from the reactor to the regeneration zone. Such an 
operation led, on a MgMoO, catalyst doped with C%O and supported over a MgA1204 
spinel phase (which also gave the catalyst the mechanical properties suitable for use in 
transported beds), to a selectivity 
to butadiene in the 60 
to 70 percent range, and to butene 
in the 10 to 20 percent range, with n-butane conversion up to 4
0
 
to 50 percent. Minor 
amounts 
of COX, 
furan, and cracking 
products were obtained. Typical operating 
conditions 
were temperature 550 "C, GHSV 350 
h-', diluted n-butane stream for 10 to 30 s, followed 
by regeneration with air for 1 min. 
This kind of operation can be carried out when a catalyst able to undergo several 
cycles of reduction and reoxidation without structural modifications or collapse is 
developed. In addition, the rate of reaction may be limited by the surface oxygen 
availability, 
or by the diffusion of lattice oxygen from the bulk to the surface, or again by 
the rate of replenishment of bulk oxygen. Therefore, in order to reach acceptable levels 
of productivity it might become necessary to circulate enormous amounts of catalyst (in 
case the oxygen availability per unit mass of catalyst is rather limited, or the oxygen 
diffusion from bulk to surface is too slow), either by utilizing very high circulation rates 
or by building very large plants. 
A similar process operating in a cyclic fashion has been claimed by Atlantic 
Richfield Cornpany'O6'O9 for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to the corresponding 
olefins, to be 
carried out over different kinds of metal oxides (MnO, 
Sb,O,, Bi203, CeO,), 
supported and eventually doped with alkali metals and phosphorus. However, no data on 
the performance are available.

could operate continuously. The further addition of ammonia in the feedstock 
improved the selectivity to the olefins; low amounts of furan and acetaldehyde also 
formed. The catalyst was characterized,'" and found to be highly amorphous, with

By means of TPR 
tests it was found"' 
that butyl radicals were formed upon

was also proposed that the desorption into the gas phase of these radicals could give rise 
to some homogeneous unselective reaction and that the beneficial role of water on the 
selectivity to the olefms could be related to the decrease of the rate of formation of 
radicals participating in gas-phase oxidations.

3.3 Conclusions. - 
Nowadays, the supply of butadiene from steam-crackers exceeds the 
market demand, and the olefm is sold at a low price. Consequently, there is a strong 
incentive to convert butadiene to higher valued products, i.e., either by selectively 
hydrogenating to 1- and Zbutene (which are 
further converted to oligomers, isobutene, or 
methylethylketone), or by cocracking butadiene-rich cuts with a naphtha feed.

Selective Oxidations of C4 
Paraffins

Isobutene (utilized at most for MTBE synthesis) and polymer-grade 1-butene are 
the most requested products. The former can be produced by isobutane 
dehydrogenation, 
n-butene isomerization and t-butyl alcohol decomposition, 
besides fluid catalytic cracking 
(FCC) and steam cracking. n-Butene can also be obtained by dehydrogenation 
of n-butane. 
At present, the industrial interest for the development of a process for the synthesis 
of C
,
 olefins via n-butane oxidehydrogenation, 
alternative 
to the traditional synthetic 
ways, 
is therefore very low. Nevertheless, whatever functionalization of the paraffin aimed to 
the synthesis of more valued chemicals is made has necessarily taken into account the 
initial introduction of the double bond in the molecule. From this point of view, therefore, 
the study of the heterogeneously catalyzed mechanism of olefrn and diolefin formation 
from n-butane, as well as of the nature of the active sites that are 
necessary to selectively 
oxidize the paraffin, may be beneficial. 
In addition, the oxydehydrogenation 
of n-butane and isobutane in the future could 
compete with the dehydrogenation 
processes for the synthesis 
of high-purity-grade olefins. 
Interest in the oxidative dehydrogenation might arise when the following conditions were 
fulfilled: 
Possibility of achieving high n-butane conversion and high productivities to 
olefins at relatively low temperature (in contrast to the dehydrogenation that 
employs high temperatures); 
Absence of oxygenated products (acids, aldehydes) 
that could make the use of 
expensive anticorrosive materials necessary; and 
Constant catalytic performance for long enough periods of t

Figure 25 compares the best performances achieved on the different catalytic 
systems 
described above; the value of selectivity to olefins obtained and the corresponding 
n-butane conversion are reported. The highest overall yields (around 35 
percent) are 
obtained on Ni-based mixed oxides and on magnesium vanadates. This value is lower than 
that typically achieved by paraffin dehydrogenation (
4
0
 
to 50 percent). However, a 
comparison of the two processes (oxydehydrogenation 
of n-butane vs dehydrogenation) 
has 
to take into account several aspects; 
all of them affect the overall process economy: 
Lower selectivities are usually achieved with oxydehydrogenation (60 to 70 
percent, while in dehydrogenation selectivities higher than 90 
percent are 
obtained) because of the formation of carbon oxides. The latter can be 
lowered by operations at low n-butane conversion; in this case, however, it is 
necessary to recycle the unconverted n-butane. 
The carbon oxides formed in the oxydehydrogenation have to be separated 
from the product’s mixture before recycling the unconverted n-butane. The 
separation of CO often requires expensive devices. 
On the other hand, high paraffin conversions may be preferred because the 
expensive separation of the olefins from the unconverted paraffin would be

unnecessary. Alternatively, the separation is unnecessary when an integrated 
process is developed, where the outlet stream of the oxydehydrogenation 
process is entirely fed to a down-stream reactor for the selective 
conversion of 
olefins to other chemicals, more easily separable from the unconverted par- 
affin. 
The absence of a valuable dehydrogenation coproduct, H2, may considerably 
affect the economics of the process. 
Expensive devices for the control of the gas-phase composition (to avoid the 
formation of flammable compositions) 
are often necessary in oxidation plants. 
On the other hand, the oxydehydrogenation 
is a less energy-consuming 
process and 
can operate at milder conditions than dehydrogenation. The catalyst needs less frequent 
regenerations, due to less severe operating conditions 
and to the lower formation of coke. 
Magnesium vanadates seem to be the most promising catalysts for n-butane 
oxydehydrogenation because they combine a high activity with acceptable selectivity, as 
well as apparent stability under continuous operation, and rather constant selectivity to 
olefins even at almost total n-butane conversion, under conditions more favorable to the

water, as 
is the case for other systems. 
The nature of the active phase in Mg vanadates, as well as the importance of the 
different phases present in the catalysts in affecting the interaction with the hydrocarbon 
and the reaction pathway, is still unclear. Further work is needed to obtain a better 
understanding of this system and the possibility of improving the performance through 
suitable doping. 
4 The Oxidation of Isobutane to Methacrylic Acid 
4.1 
Introduction. - Methacrylic acid is at present synthesized mainly via the 
acetone-cyanohydrin route,'22 which consists of an initial reaction between acetone and 
hydrogen cyanide, to give the acetone cyanohydrin that is then reacted with excess 
concentrated sulphuric 
acid to form the methacrylamide 
acid sulfate. In a successive 
stage, 
the methacrylamide sulfate is treated with excess aqueous methanol; the amide is 
hydrolyzed and esterified, with formation of a mixture of methylmethacrylate and 
methacrylic acid. Main drawbacks of this process are the utilization of highly toxic raw 
materials (HCN) and the coproduction of an equimolar amount of NH,HSO,. 
Different alternative routes have been proposed, two of which already have been 
applied ind~strially'~~: 
The BASF p r o c e s ~ ' ~ ~ ~ ' ~ ~  
utilized in Germany is based on C1 and C2 building 
blocks. Ethylene is fust hydroformylated to give propionaldehyde, which is 
then condensed with formaldehyde to produce methacrolein. Methacrolein is 
then oxidized to methacrylic acid, followed by esterification with methanol. 
The major advantages are the absence of inorganic coproducts and the low 
environmental impact. 
The process utilized in Japan is one where isobutene, 
obtained by conventional 
technologies of isobutane dehydrogenation and separated from the latter by 
hydration, is oxidized to methacrolein and then to methacrylic acid. The first 
step is catalyzed by Bi/Mo/Sb mixed oxides and the second one by 
heteropolycompounds.'26 The process is utilized by several companies: 
Mitsubishi Rayon and Nippon Methacryl Monomer (a joint venture of 
Sumitomo 
Chemical and Nippon Shokubai). Alternatively, Asahi first carries 
out the ammoxidation of isobutene to methacrylonitrile, which is then 
hydrolyzed and esterified. 
Halcon has developed a process123,127-129 
where isobutane is fust dehydro- 
genated. The reactor outlet (isobutene, 
unconverted isobutane, and hydrogen) 
is sent to an oxidation reactor without separation of the components. In this 
step isobutene is selectively oxidized to methacrolein, while isobutane and 
hydrogen do not react, Methacrolein is then separated, 
oxidized, 
and esterified,

Catalysis 
while isobutane is recycled to the dehydrogenation reactor, provided oxygen 
and hydrogen are first removed. Optionally, hydrogen can be selectively 
oxidized with a suitable catalyst. 
Mitsubishi Chemical Industries and Asahi have each developed their own 
process for the synthesis 
of methacrylic acid via oxidative dehydrogenation of 
isobutyric acid. The latter is obtained as a byproduct in the 0x0-synthesis of 
n-butyraldehyde from propylene and is therefore available at a convenient 
price. 
Several patents have appeared claiming the possibility of carrying out the 
synthesis 
of methacrylic acid by the one-step oxidation of isobutane in the gas 
phase, over heteropolycompounds as catalysts. 
The direct synthesis of methacrylic acid via oxidation of isobutane looks 
particularly promising because of the low cost of the raw material, the simplicity of the 
one-step process (above all if compared to the complexity of the acetone-cyanohydrin 
route), the very low environmental impact, and the absence of inorganic coproducts. 
The isobutane conversion to methacrylic acid is a multielectron oxidation and 
requires a multifunctional approach, thus a catalyst able to perform the simultaneous 
activation of a relatively inert substrate, the oxydehydrogenation with insertion of the 
double bond, allylic oxidation to give the aldehyde (methacrolein), and finally the 
oxidation of the latter to the acid. Even though the reaction network might not be strictly 
the one indicated, the necessity of performing all these different reactions most likely 
suggests the need for a very peculiar catalyst, analogous to that occumng in the case of 
the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, which only occurs selectively over the 
(VO),P,O, catalyst. 
4.2 The Properties of Heteropolycompounds. - 
Heteropolycompounds that possess 
intrinsic acidity and high oxidation power (both can be properly adjusted by adding 
transition metals in cationic position, or by modifying the anionic composition) 
potentially 
exhibit the multifunctionality that is necessary for the oxidation of isobutane to 
methacrolein and methacrylic acid. 
Heteropolyacids and their salts are "molecular-type" 
polyoxometallate 
compounds, 
which are formed by the condensation of two or more types of monomeric oxometallate 
anions. For example, the condensation of a phosphate anion P
O
:
-
 
with 12 molybdate 
anions gives rise to the heteropolyanion 
PMoI2O4,3- that is characterized by the so-called 
Keggin structure. There are other structures of heteropolyanions, 
characterized by different 
ratios between the two metals, such as the Dawson (X2M18062), 
the Waugh (XM903,), and 
the Anderson (XM60a) structure. The central atom, X, can be P, or Si, or Ge, and the 
polyatom is usually either molybdenum or tungsten, often replaced by metals such as 
vanadium.

Selective Oxidations of 
C4 
Paraffins 
293 
In the Keggin anion (the most extensively studied among the various anions) the 
heteroatom is in a central position, characterized by tetrahedral coordination, and is 
surrounded by the 12 atoms of the polyoxometallate, each of which is in octahedral 
coordination. 
The main features of these systems can be summarized as follows: 
Relatively high thermal structural 
stability; 
the Keggin anion in heteropolyacids 
begins to decompose at temperatures close to 320 "C. Salification leads to a 
remarkable improvement in the stability, allowing operations up to 400 "C. 
Salts can be prepared by exchange in the aqueous solution of the acid, or by 
direct precipitation of the unsoluble salt. In some cases, such as the cesium 
salts of 12-molybdophosphoric or tungstophosphoric acids, the structure is 
stable up to 550 "C. 
Solubility in an aqueous medium, for the acids and some salts also. This 
makes it potentially possible to utilize these systems both as heterogeneous and 
homogeneous catalysts. The heterogeneous utilization must of course be 
limited to temperatures not higher than that of incipient decomposition. 
High intrinsic acidity in both aqueous and organic media, even superior to that 
of some mineral acids. The Brprnsted acidity can be controlled by partial 
neutralization of the protons. 
Easy reducibility and reoxidizability by means of molecular oxygen. This 
allows them to be used as catalysts for liquid-phase or gas-phase multielectron 
oxidations. The redox properties of these materials can be affected properly 
by modifying the anionic composition (for instance, by substitution of some 
Mo6 cations with V
5
'
)
,
 
or the cationic composition. The latter can accept 
several different cations, i.e., alkali and alkaline earth metals, ammonium, 
divalent and trivalent metals such as Cu2+, 
Co2+, 
V02+. 
Extensive characterization 
of these systems can be found in several re~iews.l~*-l~~ 
4.3 The Catalyst Compositions. - 
Rohm & Haas Company was the first, in 1981,'35 to 
claim the one-step oxidation of isobutane to methacrolein and methacrylic acid. Even 
though no reference is given in the patent to the heteropolycompound, 
the claimed catalyst 
compositions are clearly Keggin-type structures. 
The use of salified heteropolycompounds 
is specifically 
indicated in many patents 
as 
a way to increase the surface area of the catalyst and its structural 
stability. In addition, 
all the patents indicate the necessity of V5+ 
(which replaces molybdenum) as well as of 
other metal ions, such as Cu2+, 
in the cationic composition, in order to achieve a higher 
yield. 
The superior performance of vanadium-containing heteropolycompounds is 
demonstrated in Table 9, where the results obtained on different 
compositions from various 
patents are compared.

Selective Oxidations of

In the patents issued by sum it om^,'^^'^^ additional 
metal ions, such as Bi, Co, Ag, 
Fe, Sb, all located in cationic positions in the heteropolycompound, were reported to have 
positive effects. In any case, however, such modifications in the cationic composition did 
not significantly 
affect the performance. Instead, a fundamental 
role was played by vana- 
dium (in an anionic position), by cesium (in a cationic position), as 
well as by an excess 
of phosphorus with respect to the stoichiometric composition. Also beneficial were arsen- 
icum (which is known to substitute for phosphorus) and small amounts of copper in a 
cationic 
position. These 
compositions gave selectivities 
to methacrylic acid plus methacro- 
lein close to 70 percent, with isobutane conversions in the 10 to 13 percent range. Besides 
carbon oxides, acetic acid was the main byproduct. After 1

The low conversion of isobutane makes the recycle of the unconverted paraffin 
necessary. For this reason CO is claimed to be oxidized to CO,

a supported Pd catalyst) after the condensation of methacrolein and methacrylic 
acid. CO, 
can then be removed by absorption in a basic solution.

has patented similar Keggin-type heteropolycompounds, containing 
vanadium, copper, and alkali metals. The necessity of salified compounds was also 
pointed out in order to increase the catalyst stability. The possibility of further addition 
of many other metals was claimed, but the performance was substantially similar to that 
of the compounds containing vanadium and copper. The latter metals were claimed as 
fundamental components, in order to obtain active and selective catalysts. The use of a 
catalyst suitable for fluid-bed operation was also claimed, so as to allow continuous 
transport of catalyst from the reaction to the regeneration vessel, and vice versa. Also, 
alternate feeding of isobutane and of oxygen on the catalytic bed allowed higher 
selectivities to be obtained. 
Fundamental features of the claimed heteropolycompounds 
were ( 
1) a partial degree 
of reduction, and (2) the cubic crystalline structure. This was achieved by calcining the 
ammonium salt of H3PMo1204 in a nitrogen atmosphere. By means of polarographic 
analysis, it was found that the Keggin anion was partially reduced, as a consequence of 
the calcination treatment. In addition, while the H3PMo120a had a tetragonal structure, 
the calcined ammonium salt had a cubic structure. Thus, though both were characterized 
by the Keggin structure, they differed in the secondary structure. The heteropoly- 
compounds characterized by the cubic structure, and by a partial degree of reduction (also 
achieved by in situ treatment with isobutene at 450 "C), 
led to superior activity and 
selectivity to methacrylic acid. 
In Mitsubishi patents'46149 slightly higher conversions of isobutane were reached, 
close to 20 percent, with heteropolycompounds 
similar in composition to those claimed by 
the other companies. Higher conversions could be achieved because air was utilized as 
the oxidizing agent, with an isobutane-to-oxygen ratio of 0.6, lower than that reported in

other patents (usually close to 2) and close to the stoichiometric

methacrylic acid. 
Some results are given in the literature with catalysts that are not hetero-

mixed oxides of V/Sb, S ~ F I O , ' ~ ~

In all cases, 
either isobutane conversion was very low, or no formation at all of methacrylic acid was 
obtained. 
The prevailing products were either carbon oxides, or acetic acid, or 
methacrolein. 
4.4 Conclusions. - 
The use of isobutane as the raw material for the production of 
methacrylic acid is particularly attractive in Europe and in the United States, where it is 
widely available and much cheaper than isobutene. 
Both the direct oxidation of isobutane and the synthesis via an 
integrated process 
of isobutane dehydrogenation and direct isobutene oxidation appear to be economically 
competitive with the acetone-cyanohydrin route.'23 The values of yield and selectivity 
reported in patents (see Table 9) are 
likely sufficient to justify the development of a new 
process based on the direct oxidation of isobutane, but not good enough to shut down an 
existing acetone-cyanohydrin plant.'23 However, it is likely that in the future new 
technologies will replace the conventional process for environmental and safety reasons. 
Heteropolycompounds 
are active and selective 
for the direct oxidation of isobutane 
to mixtures of methacrolein and methacrylic acid. However, the application at an 
industrial level of heteropolycompounds as heterogeneous catalysts for gas-phase oxida- 
tions has been so far limited by their structural instability at the reaction conditions. In 
fact, in the reaction medium the Keggin anion is progressively decomposed, with decrease 
of the catalytic activity and worsening of the selectivity. This may be the reason why, to 
our knowledge, no plant that is larger than the bench scale has been built so far for the 
isobutane oxidation. It is likely that the possibility of utilization of heteropolycompounds 
as catalysts for this reaction will depend on the development of heteropolycompounds 
intrinsically more stable, or stabilized by the interaction with some suitable support. 
5 Hydroxylation of Butanes to Alcohols 
5.1 Introduction. - 
Recently, efforts have been directed toward the selective hydro- 
xylation of alkanes in the liquid-phase to the corresponding alcohols. The possibility of 
developing a process for a one-step conversion of light paraffins to more valuable 
chemicals to be utilized, for instance, in the formulation of clear-burning high-octane 
motor fuels alternative to conventional gasoline, or for the intermediate for the synthesis 
of other valued chemicals (i.e., the dehydration to high-purity olefins) would constitute a 
useful technology. 
We shall analyze the published results on the oxidation of C,-C, paraffins (with 
particular attention to isobutane) to alcohols in the liquid-phase, 
on the basis of the classes

of catalysts utilized: 
Iron and manganese porphyrin complexes, with single oxygen atom donors or 
with molecular oxygen as oxidizing agents; 
Heteropolycompounds, with either molecular oxygen or alkylhydroperoxides 
as oxygen donors; and 
Crystalline titanium and vanadium silicates, with H,O, as the oxidant. 
5.2 Metal Porphyrin Complexes. - 
Enzymatic systems are known to be able to catalyze 
efficiently the oxidation of inert hydrocarbons, utilizing molecular oxygen as an oxidant. 
Among these, monooxygenases are enzymes which catalyze C-H bond hydroxylation or 
double 
bond epoxidation, 
with simultaneous 
oxidation of the coreductant 
NADH, according 
to the following equation: 
RH + 0, + 2e + 2H+ + 
ROH + H20. 
The coreductant furnishes the electrons and protons that are stoichiometrically 
consumed 
in the cycle. 
Cytochrome P-450 is the base for several monooxygenases in different living 
organisms; 
it contains an iron porphyrin complex in the active center of the en~yme."~-'~~ 
Another enzymatic active center containing iron is the methane monooxygenase (iron is, 
however, in this case in a nonheme surrounding), which is able to hydroxylate methane. 
In cytochrome P-450 
a high-oxidation-state 
ferry1 
intermediate 
Fe"=O is generated, 
complexed by a porphyrin cation radical P+', that directly hydroxylates the aLkane. With 
molecular oxygen the use of the coreductant NADH is needed to increase the energy for 
the formation of the species P+-Fe'vO 
via the following reaction: 
PFeIn + 0, + 2e + 2H+ + 
P+.Fe"O + H20. 
The active species can be alternatively formed by the use of single oxygen atom 
donors, such as hydroperoxides, iodosylbenzene or peroxyacids; in this case the 
coreductant is not necessary. 
Much research has been done in order to simulate cytochrome P-450. 
Indeed, the 
use of simple metal compounds (such as Fe2+ salts) as catalysts for the oxidation of 
alkanes by molecular oxygen can give rise to high yields of alcohols and ketones. The 
mechanism, however, involves free radicals, and therefore the reaction between alkyl 
radicals and oxygen leads to the ROH alcohol via the decomposition of intermediate 
RO,H 
(through the Haber-Weiss mechanism) to RO. and RO; radicals. This is followed by the 
classical auto-oxidation mechanism RO. + RH + 
ROH + R. 
Such processes are indiscriminate, i.e., molecular configuration is not retained. 
Therefore, they are useful when the substrate to be oxidized has only one position

susceptible of attack. 
Since 1979, many papers have been published regarding the use of metal (mainly 
iron and manganese) porphyrin complexes as catalysts for the direct hydroxylation of 
alkanes (mainly cycloalkanes) and for alkene epoxidation. Either molecular oxygen with 
stoichiometric coreductants (zinc amalgam, Pt/H2, ascorbic a ~ i d ) , ' ~ ~ - ' ~ ~  
or single oxygen 
atom transfers, such as iodosylarenes, sodium hypochlorite, tertiary amine oxides, and 
KHS05,'57-'65 
were used as the oxygen source, and relatively high yields in the desired 
products were obtained. The formation of the high valent oxometal species Fe"=O and 
Mnv=O species was observed,'66 analogous to that occurring in the enzymatic systems. 
It was demonstrated that hydroxylation can be carried out with high selectivity, and 
that the system is sensitive to steric hindrances created by the groups that can be attached 
to the porphyrin ring. 
This is a "shape selectivity" phenomenon, analogous to that 
occurring on zeolites. 
The electrophilic properties of these substituents can have a 
considerable effect on the reactivity of the system. 
When H202 or alkylhydroperoxides were used as oxygen donors, the metal 
porphyrin complexes tended to dismutate the peroxide, with poor oxygen atom transfer to 
the alkane or the alkene. In addition, the reaction proceeded essentially via free radicals. 
However, it was found that, by addition of imidazole, Mn-polyhalogenporphyrin catalysts 
became very efficient in alkane hydroxylation with H202.'67-'72 Imidazole had the effect 
of enabling the heterolytic cleavage of the 0-0 bond of H202 by the Mn"' complex 
(leading to the MnV=O species), over the homolytic cleavage, and of reducing the 
dismutation of hydrogen peroxide. For example,'70 yields between 4
0
 
and 85 percent 
(calculated with respect to the H202) 
were obtained at room temperature in the oxidation 
with dilute H202 of cyclohexane, cyclooctane, adamantane, and ethylbenzene, without 
apparent destruction of the catalyst. Indeed, H202 was always highly deficient with 
respect to the hydrocarbon, i.e., a Mn complex/H202/imidazole/alkane ratio of 1/40/24/700 
was utilized; imidazole also had to be used in large excess with respect to the metal 
complex. The best system found was the Mn"'(TDCPP)Cl/imidazole one (TDCPP = 
tetra-2,6-dichlorophenylporphyrin). Turnover rates up to 22 cycle/min for monooxy- 
genation of cyclohexane were obtained, comparable to rates obtained in the hydroxylation 
with the enzymatic P-450/NADH/02 system. 
A considerable enhancing effect induced by the addition of very small amounts of 
lipophilic carboxylic acids and heterocyclic bases in both alkane hydroxylation and alkene 
epoxidation by dilute H202 (in a two-phase system) over Mn"'-tetraaryl porphirins 
catalysts has also been reported by other authors.

In conclusion, the major problems encountered with metal porphyrin complexes can 
be summarized as follows: 
. Necessity for high substrate-to-oxygen ratios, in order to minimize side- 
reactions.

Paraffins

Low turnover numbers (cycles of reaction per unit time per unit of catalyst 
weight), This is particularly true for the hydroxylation of linear alkanes and 
alkylbenzenes, while for cycloalkanes remarkably higher turnover numbers 
were reported. 
Low stability of the ligands in the metal complex, which undergo oxidative 
destruction. 
Necessity for a coreductant when using molecular oxygen as the oxidant 
species. 
All these drawbacks limit the possibility of practical applications for these systems. 
An efficient way to stabilize the porphyrin complexes, and also achieve improved 
efficiency, consists in the halogenation of both the meso and 6 positions of the porphyrin 
Thus, substitution with bulky, electronegative groups leads to effective 
catalysts, thanks to a "cage effect" that prevents oxidative degradation of the catalyst 
through an intermolecular process, as well as the formation of catalytically inert p-0x0 
species. 
The necessity of a coreductant when molecular oxygen is used can be overcome 
by the use of light irradiation. In this case, oxidation of cycloalkanes with molecular 
oxygen was carried out under mild conditions in the presence of catalytic amounts of a 
polyhalogenated porphyrin-Fen'-hydroxo complex irradiated with light having a wavelength 
between 350 
and 450 nm. Iron-alkylperoxo intermediates rather than the iron 0x0 active 
species were thought to form. The turnover numbers obtained were, however, rather 
low.'8o The same complex was also covalently linked to TiO,; the hybrid system showed 
a peculiar reactivity with a preferential formation of alcohols with respect to ketones.18'

 Light Paraffins. 
- 
Until 1989, most work on iron or manganese 
porphyrin complexes was carried out at atmospheric pressure either on cycloalkanes, or 
on n-alkanes that are liquid at room temperature. Among the latter, very few papers have 
dealt with the oxidation of n-pentane.15571827183 
For instance, n-pentane was oxidized using 
differently substituted iron tetraphenylporphyrins as catalysts and iodosobenzene as oxygen 
transfer agent. The reaction was carried out at 25 'C, with a pentane/iodosobenzene/iron 
complex molar ratio of 1100/20/1; in most cases the catalyst was destroyed after 15 to 20 
minutes. The highest overall yield to pentanols was approximately 30 percent (with 
respect to the oxidant), on the Fe[meso-tetrakis(2-fluorophenyl)porphyrin]Br 
system, with 
formation of a mixture of 1-, 2- and 3-pentanols, and trace amounts of pentanones. The 
2-/3-pentanol ratio depended on the nature and location of the substituents on the phenyl 
rings. In any case, little or no terminal methyl hydroxylation was observed. The highest 
yields were obtained with bulky substituents close to the iron center, which hindered the 
catalyst's bimolecular self-destruction, and with electron-withdrawing substituents. 
The effect of shape selectivity was also improved in very sterically hindered iron 
and manganese porphyrins, where primary hydroxylation occurred to a large extent,

analogous 
to that occumng in enzymatic systems.'65 The steric hindrance of the reactant 
also affected the regioselectivity, while the size of the oxidant did not. By using the 
[5,10,15,20-tetr~~(2',4',6'-biphenylphenyl)~rphyrinato]Mn'~ 
acetate as catalyst, a 
selectivity to 1-pentanol as high as 10 percent could be achieved with iodosobenzene as 
the oxidant. Fe porphyrin derivatives showed a lower primary selectivity than Mn 
complexes. 
More recently, iron polyhalogenated porphyrins have been claimed to catalyze the 
oxidation of light n-alkanes into alcohols and ketones under pressure of molecular oxygen, 
at 80 "C, without the need of a stoichiometric 
 ored duct ant.'^^-^^^ The authors carried out 
an extensive work on the liquid phase oxidation of C,-C4 paraffins, utilizing different iron 
porphyrin complexes. 
Effective systems in the hydroxylation of isobutane to t-butyl alcohol were 
constituted by the azido(tpp = tetraphenylporphyrinato) complexes of the first row 
transition metals: Cr(tpp)N3, 
Mn(tpp)N, and Fe(tp~)N,.,~ 
The results obtained at 80 OC, 
under 7 
atm of 0, 
pressure, are reported in Table 10. The chloro or acetato complexes 
of the same metals were instead found to be ineffective catalysts. The azido complexes 
were also more active than the corresponding nitrides. For this reason, the transformation 
of the azide complex Fe(tpp)N, to the p-nitride [Fe(tpp)12N was assumed to play a 
significant role in the observed progressive deactivation of the catalyst, as well as in the 
oxidative decomposition of the porphyrin ring structure. 
It was then found that the halogenation of the porphyrin ring increased the activity, 
as shown in Table 10, and the greater the halogen substitution, the greater the 
The replacement of the B (pyrrolic) hydrogen atoms with bromine 
substituents, or of the 8 ortho hydrogens of the meso-phenyl groups with chloride, 
improved the activity considerably. However, the highest activity was obtained when all 
20 hydrogens in the meso-phenyl groups and the 8 pyrrolic hydrogens were replaced by 
fluorine atoms, as in the iron perhaloporphyrin complex Fe(TPPF2013-Br8)X, where 
X=Cl,Br,N,,OH; TPPF = tetrakis(pentafluoropheny1) p~rphyrinato.'~~' At this level of 
substitution, the nature of the axial anion (a halogen, an hydroxyl or azide), was not 
important in affecting the activity, even though some small effect was observed in the 
selectivity to t-butyl alcohol. 
In agreement with many indications in the literature, it was also found that steric 
hindrance can affect the activity.191 The size of the pyrrolic bromine substituents, more 
bulky than that of chlorine, may prevent access to the central iron atom, for instance, 
hindering the formation of the active species. 
The oxidation could be carried out even in the absence of the benzene solvent. In 
such conditions, the turnover indeed increased considerably, and conversions as high as 
23 percent isobutane could be reached, with 95 percent selectivity to the alcohol. Table 
11 shows the product distributions and the isobutane conversions achieved over two 
different highly halogenated complexes. The reaction in pure isobutane with air at room

secondary effect, as reported above, can be related to the lower susceptibility of the 
porphyrin toward electrophilic intermolecular attack. In addition, the bromination of the 
pyrrole ring also resulted in an increase in the reduction potential of the FeIn/Fe" 
couple.191 
Thus, it is likely that the activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence 
of reduced Fe", whose formation is favored by the electron withdrawal effect achieved 
with halogenation, The presence of Fe" during reaction was also demonstrated by in situ 
absorption spectroscopy. 
These catalysts provide a system where molecular oxygen is reductively bound 
between two Fe'" centers, giving rise to the p-peroxo species Fe"-O-O-Fe"; 
this bond is 
then cleaved to form the active Fe"=O 
center. In such a way, both oxygen atoms are 
made available, while in enzymatic systems, with intermediate formation of FeIn-O-O-H 
(where oxygen is initially reductively bound between an iron atom and a proton), the 
evolution of the ferry1 species occurs with the coproduction of water, and therefore the 
maximum achievable yield with respect to oxygen is 50 percent. 
The reaction mechanism proposed by the authors 
is summarized 
in Figure 27.lS9-l9l 
It could be speculated that the p-0x0 FeIn-O-FeIU, 
inactive in oxygen coordination (and 
considered to be responsible for the porphyrinatoiron 
complex deactivation), 
is destabilized 
toward disproportionation to Fe" and Fe"=O 
(the active species) by the removal of 
electron density from the porphyrinato ligand, 
and, thus, halogenation makes the formation 
of the inactive p-0x0 species less likely. 
In conclusion, these complexes constitute an elegant and fascinating system, 
which 
deserves further research. At present their drawbacks limit the exploitation at an industrial 
level, but nevertheless their peculiar features may be potentially useful for specific 
reactions of functionalization to be carried out, for instance, at particular positions of the 
substrate or under peculiar geometrical constraints. Examples of future applications

5.3 Heteropolycompounds. - 
In recent years, interest has grown in the use of these 
materials for the activation of alkanes by liquid-phase oxidation. This comes from the fact 
that, analogous to that occurring in iron prophyrin complexes, heteropolyanions can 
stabilize 
high-valent oxometal species in their structure. With respect to the porphyrinato- 
metal complexes, however, heteropolycompounds are more oxidatively resistant systems.

as the oxidizing agent.lg2 The oxidation of cyclohexane yielded cyclohexanol and cyclo- 
hexanone, with high yields with respect to the converted oxidant (which was deficient with 
respect to the substrate). The same catalysts were applied for the synthesis of N-alkyl- 
acetamide from adamantane and isobutane, through replacement of C-H bonds with C-N 
bonds by reaction of the alkane with tetranitromethane.

light paraffin oxidation with molecular oxygen, with high selectivity to alcohols and 
ketones.

5.4 Titanium- and Vanadium-Silicalite. 
- 
The first paper dealing with the use of 
Ti-silicalite (TS-1, with the MFI-type structure) as a catalyst for the liquid-phase, 
heterogeneous oxidation of alkanes with H202, appeared in 1990199*200 
(but indeed 
Eniricerche patented the application in 1989201). The partial oxidation of n-hexane, 
cyclohexane, methylpentanes, heptane, octane, and nonane with H202 at 50 "C has been 
reported. While linear alkanes like n-hexane could be oxidized to 2-hexanol and 
3-hexanol, and to the corresponding ketones, with an overall turnover number (mole of 
product per mole of Ti) equal to 7, branched alkanes and cyclohexane 
were oxidized with 
negligible rates. Analogously, longer alkanes diffused more slowly into the zeolite 
channels, and the conversion decreased.2003202 This clearly indicates a selection of 
reactants based on their size. 
The oxidation occurred statistically at the secondary carbon atoms, thus without 
effects of regioselectivity, and ketones formed from alcohols. On the contrary, other 
authorsm*2m 
found a preferential activation at the 2-position. The conversion leveled off 
after some hours because of pore blocking. Regeneration restored the initial activity, and

carried out over amorphous Ti02/Si02, 
no oxidation occurred at all. 
Analogous 
reactivity was found for the Ti-silicalite 
with the MEL structure202 
(TS- 
2) and oxyfunctionalization at the 2-position of n-hexane was favored. An increase in the 
Ti content increased the selectivity with respect to consumed H202 because the reaction 
rate was enhanced with respect to the H202 decomposition rate. Conversions as high as 
19 
percent for cyclohexane 
could be achieved at 100 "C in 5 h, with selectivity 
to hexanols 
and hexanones of 89 percent, and H202 utilization of 61.6 percent. 
The oxidation 
of lighter alkanes, such as 
propane, n-butane and n-pentane, by H202 
over TS-1 was carried out by Cleri~i.~'~ 
The oxidation of different substrates is compared 
in Table 13. In agreement with the previous data, linear alkanes reacted more quickly than 
branched and cyclic ones; n-hexane was more reactive than the lower paraffins, despite its 
slower diffusion. Methanol was used as 
the solvent 
because of its relative inertness toward

solvent at all. In any case, the rate of reaction was affected considerably by the nature of

homolytic scission of the C-H bond, and a free radical chain mechanism in solution could 
be disregarded, 
in consideration of the observed relative order of reactivity of the various 
hydrocarbons tested. 
The reactivity of the C-H bond and the regioselectivity were also affected by the 
presence of electron-withdrawing substituents. o-inductive donor properties of alkyl 
groups increased with an increasing number of carbon atoms in the chain. These effects, 
combined with that of different diffusivity inside the channels, led to the observed 
experimental scale of reactivity as a function of chain length (where n-hexane was 
characterized by a maximum in conversion), as the optimum result of the two opposite

with H202 
over Ti-D zeolites. These materials, 
contrary to MFI and MEL type structures, cannot be synthesized without framework 
aluminum, and therefore a residual acidity is always present. The catalyst could epoxidize 
bulky olefins at a higher rate than TS-1, but the reactivity on n-hexane was considerably 
lower than with TS-1. A linear correlation between the activity and the Ti content was

anchored to the zeolite surface), is still under debate, these systems were found to catalyze 
the oxidation of alkanes under mild conditions with aqueous H202, 
as well as to yield the 
formation of primary alcohols and of the corresponding aldehydes, in contrast to the 
Ti-silicalite. The activity was close to that reported for TS-1, with turnovers (moles of 
alkane reacted per mole of metal in a framework position) close to 1,OOO, for 8 hours of 
reaction.

5.5 Conclusions. - 
The liquid-phase oxidation of isobutane to t-butyl alcohol can be 
carried out effectively 
with different catalytic systems. Besides the conventional 
metal 0x0 
and peroxo complexes, new classes of catalysts (such as 
crystalline metal-silicalites), or 
new applications for known compounds (such as heteropolycompounds and halogenated 
iron and manganese porphyrin complexes), have been developed recently, which open a 
lot of possibilities for the exploitation of n- and isoparaffins. 
The main problems that have been partially solved for some of these systems 
concern: 
The stability of the complexes or structures in the reaction environment; 
The recovery of catalysts from the reaction medium and their regenerability; 
The achievement of high rates of reactions (or turnover numbers), so as to 
make the reaction reasonably applicable at a practical level; and 
The possibility of increasing the oxidant-to-substrate ratio, so as to maximize 
the hydrocarbon conversion and maintain high selectivity to the desired 
products. 
Furthermore, it is likely that in many cases (especially with metal porphyrin 
complexes and heteropolycompounds) the mechanism is initiated by the catalyst, but 
indeed might proceed via the classical autoxidation scheme.'33 
The use of metal-modified molecular sieves for the selective hydroxylation of 
paraffins with H202 
looks particularly promising. These heterogeneous catalytic systems 
are very stable, are easily separated from the reaction medium, and can be regenerated. 
Heteropolycompounds also offer the possibility of several applications, in view of their 
compositional versatility and polyfunctionality. 
6 Conclusions and Final Remarks 
Analyzing the properties of catalysts that are active in paraffins oxidation, one can 
draw conclusions about optimum properties. In particular, the fundamental aspects that 
affect the selectivity to the desired product are summarized here. 
The role of the stability of the products. There is no doubt that the reason why 
the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin is the synthesis of maleic 
anhydride from n-butane relates to the relative stability of the product. Notwithstanding 
this fact, many improvements 
on the process and modifications in the catalyst composition 
have been aimed to lower the extent of maleic anhydride decomposition. For instance, the 
tuning of the P/V ratio and the addition of promoters operate to lower the product 
overoxidation at high conversion. Nevertheless, paraffin conversion must be kept lower 
than 80 percent, otherwise the final selectivity is remarkably lowered. 
Also in the case of the gas-phase oxidation of isobutane to methacrylic acid, of the 
liquid-phase oxidation of isobutane to r-butyl alcohol, and of the oxydehydrogenation of 
n-butane to olefins the decomposition of the product remains the major problem. The

Catalysis 
conversion of the paraffh has to be kept rather low in all cases, in order to avoid 
consecutive undesired reactions. 
Therefore, the key problem in the oxidation of alkanes does not seem to be the 
activation of the saturated molecule, but rather the stability of the product. A catalyst able 
to activate the paraffin must possess such strong oxidizing properties that the product, 
more reactive than the reactant, necessarily undergoes unselective oxidative attacks. In 
other words, the achievement of high selectivity at low paraffin conversion is not a 
surprising result; much more significant is the yield obtained, thus the selectivity at high 
conversion. 
The importance of nondesorption of the intermediates. In the synthesis of 
maleic anhydride and methacrylic acid the presence of acid sites on the catalyst surface 
is necessary to allow a quick desorption of the products; on the other hand, acid sites may 
be responsible for undesired side reactions on olefins. Therefore, a quick transformation 
of the adsorbed olefinic-like intermediates to oxidized products is necessary in order to 
avoid their desorption as olefins and the possibility of undesired side reactions. 
When the olefins are instead the desired product (as in n-butane oxydehydro- 
genation), basicity is necessary to allow a quick desorption of the olefins and avoid 
consecutive 
oxidation reactions. Magnesium orthovanadates 
(the best catalyst for this kind 
of reaction, active at relatively low temperatures, thus at conditions at which homogeneous 
reactions are negligible) combine surface basic properties with a low oxidizing power and 
therefore possess properties for this type of reaction. 
The role of isolation of the active sites. In order to avoid the reaction of 
combustion (even at very low reactant conversion), it is necessary that the adsorbed 
paraffin finds very few active oxygen species close to the adsorption site. This feature can 
be realized by design of catalysts where the transition metals are isolated in an inert 
matrix, such as iron in metal porphyrins, titanium in silicalite, vanadium in hetero- 
polycompounds, vanadium in MgO (by formation of the magnesium vanadate), and in 
P,O, (by formation of the vanadyl pyrophosphate). 
Polyfunctionality. In order to avoid the desorption of the intermediates (with 
formation of byproducts that would lower the selectivity), it is necessary that the active 
complex possesses a polyfunctional nature. In fact, for both maleic anhydride and 
methacrylic acid synthesis, different kinds of oxidizing attacks have to be performed 
(besides the paraffin activation), 
and all these attacks must occur either simultaneously or 
in a very rapid stepwise 
fashion, thus without desorption of these intermediates: oxidative 
dehydrogenation, allylic 
oxidation (for the formation of dienic-like 
intermediate 
in the case 
of n-butane oxidation, and of methacrolein for isobutane oxidation), 1-4 oxygen insertion 
and electrophilic oxygen insertion on the butadiene-like intermediate to obtain the maleic 
anhydride, oxygen insertion in the aldehydic C-H bond for the formation of methacrylic 
acid. This polyfunctionality cannot be achieved by simply mixing different types of 
catalysts but by designing catalysts 
that present ensembles 
of sites with different reactivity.

Paraffins

On the contrary, mono-functional catalysts are necessary for the conversion of n- 
butane to butene, or of isobutane to t-butyl alcohol. Therefore, the corresponding 
catalysts 
must possess very specific active sites, able to perform only one type of oxidizing attack. 
Transition elements at the highest oxidation state. Vanadium at its highest 
oxidation state (V5') seems to be a key element in the gas-phase activation of paraffins. 
Butenes are in fact selectively formed on Mg vanadates, and V5+ sites are found at the 
surface of the (VO),P,O,. 
In the liquid-phase oxidation of isobutane with iron porphyrin complexes an 
oxometal ferry1 species, with a high-oxidation-state Fe&, is thought to be the active 
species. In the liquid-phase hydroxilation of paraffins with titanium-silicalite, 
lattice Ti 
ions react with H,O, giving rise to very active elecrophilic 
species. Polyoxometalates also 
are known to exhibit a high oxidative power, due to the easy reducibility and 
reoxidizability of Mo6+ 
ions in the Keggin anion. 
Therefore, transition metals at their highest oxidation state seem necessary 
components of a system designed to activate a paraffin. 
The formation of olefinic-like intermediates as the key-step for the selectivity. 
The formation of an olefinic-like intermediate via contemporaneous abstraction of two H 
atoms of the paraffin is a key step in order to obtain high selectivity. In fact, the 
abstraction of a single H atom can create radicals that may either desorb and react with 
molecular oxygen, forming peroxides, or react with neighboring oxygen species forming 
oxygenates. In the case of the maleic anhydride synthesis these products are precursors 
of COX 
formation, and this likely also occurs in the case of methacrylic acid synthesis. 
Therefore, a mechanism of selective activation of an alkane must be a concerted 
mechanism where two hydrogen atoms are simultaneously eliminated. 
In the case of the liquid-phase oxidation of isobutane to r-butyl alcohol, instead, 
the abstraction of a single H atom at the most reactive tertiary position is necessary to 
allow the introduction of the OH group and the formation of the olefin must be avoided. 
The importance of the rate of alkane dehydrogenation with respect to that of 
oxygen insertion. In the n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, it is necessary that the 
olefinic-like intermediate is quickly oxydehydrogenated to a dienic-like adsorbed 
componnd, avoiding the oxygen insertion in the allylic position and the formation of 
oxygenated byproducts (unsaturated aldehydes and ketones). Thus, the oxydehydro- 
genation must be much quicker than the oxygen insertion. In the case of isobutane 
oxidation, instead, this is not an important factor, because the possible olefinic-like 
intermediate can only undergo a reaction of allylic oxygen insertion. 
The nature of the oxygen donor species. The use of H202 in the liquid-phase 
constitutes a valid alternative to molecular oxygen in terms of cost, environmental 
friendliness, and ease of deployment. 
Catalysts such as Ti-silicalite and hetero- 
polyoxometalates 
can selectively activate hydrogen peroxide at mild conditions, 
giving rise 
to electrophilic oxygen species able to abstract hydrogen and thus activate paraffins. Even

Catalysis 
though this kind of application is likely suitable only for those substrates that possess a site 
of preferential attack (as 
in the case of isobutane), many different possible applications can 
be envisaged in the field of fine chemicals production, for the functionalization or the 
synthesis of thermally unstable molecules. 
In conclusion, there are many factors that affect the selectivity in paraffms 
oxidation. High selectivity can be 
achieved not only by a proper choice or mdication 
of the catalyst, so as 
to minimize the unselective oxidizing attack on the reactant (the latter 
also depends on the type 
of pamffin) or the decomposition of the product, but also by a 
control of the sequence of the reaction steps.
