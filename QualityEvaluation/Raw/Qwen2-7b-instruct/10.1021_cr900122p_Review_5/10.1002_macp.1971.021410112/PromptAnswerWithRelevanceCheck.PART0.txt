[8] "We have used the terms: a) conversion of the disproportionation reaction (molar ratio): X monoalkenes acyclic formed X monoalkenes acyclic total D = 100"
[9] "The reaction mixture is composed by triads of increasing carbon condensation: a) the first triad is made up of monomers that form in the disproportionation reaction (butenes/pentenes/hexenes); b) the second triad is made up of dienes containing 5 atoms of carbon more than each of the alkenes of the first triad; c) the third triad is made up of trienes containing 10 atoms of carbon more than each of the alkenes of the first triad; d) the fourth triad is made up of tetraenes containing 15 atoms of carbon more than each of the alkenes of the first triad; e) the fifth triad is made up of pentaenes containing 20 atoms of carbon more than each of the alkenes of the first triad."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the roles of both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

In the presence of systems WOC14/Al(C2H5)Cl and WOClk(C4H9)4, the co-reaction of cyclic alkenes with acyclic alkenes leads to telomerization, where two groups, identical or different, derived from the acyclic alkene are fixed at the ends of the telomers. Cyclopentene, cyclooctene, pentene-2, pentene-1, butene-2, and propylene were specifically studied. In the case of cyclooctadiene-1.5 and cyclododecatriene-1.5,9 reacting with pentene-2 forms a =CH-CH2-CHz-CH= unit in a non-consecutive reaction. The distribution of telomers follows a statistical law, and a reaction scheme was proposed that aligns with the observed facts in the disproportionation of acyclic alkenes, polymerization of cyclic alkenes, and telomerization of cyclic alkenes by acyclic alkenes.

The behavior of alkenes towards tungsten and molybdenum compounds in both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis is characterized by the formation of mass molecular polymers by opening the cycle in the case of cyclic alkenes and a disproportionation reaction in the case of acyclic alkenes. A schema reactionnel was suggested that assumes the existence of an intermediate, quasi-cyclobutane, which is also relevant to interpreting the polymerization of cyclic alkenes.

Key intermediates in the process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The number of heavy products increases significantly, and their formation can be tracked through infrared spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, and gas chromatography. The reaction follows a pattern of forming triads with increasing carbon condensation, with the ratio of the first triad being approximately constant and close to 1/2/1.

The representation provided aligns with the ensemble of previous observations, particularly in the formation of macrocycles through the degradation of polyalkanes in the presence of tungsten-based catalysts, and the predominance of intramolecular transfer reactions in certain catalytic systems.

分析由硅基支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃甲基化全面机制，需要理解两站点和单站点方案的角色，线性与环烷烃转化过程，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和作用，以及这些因素如何促进反应选择性和催化剂在各种烷烃转换中的性能。

在系统 WOC14/Al(C2H5)Cl 和 WOClk(C4H9)4 的存在下，环烷烃与非环烷烃的共反应导致了链终止化，其中从非环烷烃衍生的两个相同的或不同的组分固定在链终止物的两端。研究了环戊烯、环辛烯、戊烯-2、戊烯-1、丁烯-2 和丙烯。在环辛二烯-1.5 和环十二碳三烯-1.5、9 与戊烯-2 反应时，形成 =CH-CH2-CHz-CH= 单位，在一个非连续反应中。链终止物的分布遵循统计定律，并提出了一种与观察到的事实相吻合的反应方案，这些事实涉及非环烷烃的不均衡化、环烷烃的聚合和环烷烃的链终止化由非环烷烃。

烯烃在钨和钼化合物在均相和非均相催化作用下的行为被描述为：a) 在环烷烃的情况下，通过打开周期生成大分子聚合物；b) 在非环烷烃的情况下，通过不均衡化反应（也称为甲基化 D 或分解）。提出了一个假设的反应中间体，即准环丁烷，用于解释环烷烃的聚合。

关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，在反应选择性和催化剂性能方面起着重要作用。随着反应的进行，重产物的数量显著增加，并可通过红外光谱、质谱和气相色谱进行跟踪。形成了具有递增碳凝集的三元组，第一个三元组的比例约为恒定且接近 1/2/1。

提供的表示与先前观察的结果一致，特别是通过钨基催化剂降解聚烷烃形成宏环的情况，以及某些催化体系中内分子转移反应成为主导的情况。

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two primary aspects: two-site and one-site schemes. This process allows for the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkanes. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in the reactions. The formation and role of these intermediates contribute significantly to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

In the context of alkane metathesis, the reaction takes place without altering the number and nature of chemical bonds, indicating a minimal change in enthalpy. This characteristic is consistent across both the metathesis of cyclic olefins and the disproportionation of acyclic olefins. The observed equilibrium in the cross-reaction suggests a thermodynamic balance similar to those found in other related reactions, such as the disproportionation of acyclic olefins and the polymerization of cyclic alkanes under certain conditions.

The quantitative analysis of the products obtained from the co-reaction demonstrates simple molar ratios among the different compounds formed, despite analytical challenges. This observation aligns with the straightforward nature of the reactions involved. The cross-reaction is limited, which underscores the existence of a thermodynamic equilibrium akin to those observed in other reactions, including the disproportionation of acyclic olefins and the polymerization of cyclic alkanes.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two main schemes: two-site and one-site. In the two-site scheme, the active sites of the catalyst are responsible for both the formation and rearrangement of double bonds. This scheme explains the generation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates during both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The formation of these intermediates is crucial for the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. The one-site scheme, on the other hand, focuses on the movement of a single site along the alkane chain, facilitating the rearrangement of double bonds without the necessity of a separate site for alkenes or metallacyclobutanes formation. Both schemes contribute to the reaction selectivity by controlling the distribution of products and ensuring that reactions occur efficiently without the formation of unwanted side products. The detailed understanding of these mechanisms allows for the optimization of catalyst design and conditions, leading to improved performance in alkane metathesis reactions.

The key intermediates involved in the mechanism include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These compounds play essential roles in the rearrangement of alkane structures and the formation of new alkene chains. The alkenes generated from the activation of acyclic olefins facilitate the breaking and reformation of double bonds, while the metallacyclobutanes serve as intermediates in the telomerization process of cyclic olefins. The stability and reactivity of these intermediates are critical factors determining the efficiency and selectivity of the metathesis reactions.

The selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by several factors, including the concentration of reactants, the type of catalyst, and the reaction conditions. The two-site and one-site schemes described above contribute to reaction selectivity by controlling the pathways of the reactions. The formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, as well as their subsequent rearrangement, ensures that the reactions proceed efficiently towards the desired products. Additionally, the control over the distribution of products, as indicated by the statistical law governing the telomerization process, further enhances the selectivity of the catalysts.

The detailed understanding of the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides provides insights into the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for alkane conversions. By optimizing the catalyst design and reaction conditions, it is possible to achieve higher yields of desired products with fewer side reactions, making the process more economically viable and environmentally friendly.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the use of systems such as WOC14/Al(C2H5)Cl and WOCl4(Sn(C4H9)4). This results in the telomerization of cyclic olefins. At the ends of the telomer chains, two identical or different groups derived from the acyclic olefin are fixed through a non-consecutive reaction. The participation of pentyne-2 in the cross-reaction is random compared to its participation in the disproportion reaction. The formation of products occurs simultaneously with the formation of butyne and hexyne, as evidenced by the parallel evolution of the curves D = f(t) and C = f(t). The calculations performed on the pentyne-2 and cyclopentene and defined as follows: free pentyne + transformed pentyne introduced bilan pentyne-2 = free cyclopentene + combined cyclopentene bilan cyclopentene = introduced cyclopentene have been calculated using chlorobenzene as an internal standard. These values range between 0.9 and 1.2, which can be considered a confirmation of the validity of the measurements and hypotheses given the number of formed products.
