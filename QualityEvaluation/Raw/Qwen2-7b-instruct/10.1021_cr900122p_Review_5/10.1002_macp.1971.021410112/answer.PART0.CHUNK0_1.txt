[1] "The co-reaction of cyclic olefins with acyclic olefins in the presence of systems WOC14/Al(CzH5)Cl and WOCL$k(C4H9)4 leads to a telomerization of the cyclic olefin; at the ends of the molecules of telomers are fixed two groups, identical or different, derived from the acyclic olefin through a non-consecutive reaction."
[2] "In particular, cyclopentane and cyclooctane were studied on one hand, pentane-2, pentane-1, butane-2, and propylne on the other."
[3] "The cyclooctadiene-1.5 and cyclododecatriene-1.5,9 react with pentane-2, in a non-consecutive reaction, as a =CH-CH2-CHz-CH=-unit."
[4] "The distribution of the telomers conforms to a statistical law."
[5] "In catalytic coordination, we have proposed a more detailed study of this reaction."
[6] "There are numerous possibilities of access to systems based on tungsten active catalysts towards olefins; however, they do not exhibit identical behaviors in the presence of acyclic olefins, cyclic olefins, or their mixture."
[7] "We always placed ourselves, for each of the reactants, under conditions of concentration such that, realized separately, the disproportion reaction of an acyclic olefin and the polymerization of a cyclic olefin would generally reach their almost-limit advancement in a few minutes."
[8] "In these conditions and for quantities of equal moles of both olefins, it is usually observed that the acyclic olefin inhibits completely the polymerization of the cyclic olefin and that the cyclic olefin considerably slows down the disproportion reaction of the acyclic olefin."
[9] "The products formed are difficult to analyze due to their large number and the low concentration of each taken individually."
[10] "The products were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, and gas chromatography."
[11] "The products contain only vinyl and vinylidene double bonds."
[12] "The products were characterized by gas chromatography, and their purity was determined to be around 5%."
[13] "The products are formed in the reaction, for low conversion values, which are primary products and are not derived from consecutive reactions, especially degradation reactions."
[14] "For the reaction between monoolefins and olefins-a, the dominance of asymmetric telomers can be explained by a preferential chain transfer between the two fragments R1 and Rz fixed on the same active center."
[15] "The reactions were carried out using the most commonly used techniques for KZIEGLER-type catalysis: distillation of reactants and solvents under inert atmosphere, transfers via syringes."
[16] "WOCb was prepared by refluxing WO3 in excess thionyl chloride, then sublimed."
