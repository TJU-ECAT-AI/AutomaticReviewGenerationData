[1] "The co-reaction of cyclic olefins with acyclic olefins in the presence of WOC14/Al(CzH5)Cl and WOCl$k(C4H9)4 leads to a telomerization of the cyclic olefin; at the ends of the telomers are attached two identical or different groups, derived from the acyclic olefin through a non-consecutive reaction."
[2] "In particular, cyclopentene and cyclooctene were studied on one hand, pentene-2, pentene-1, butene-2, and propylene on the other hand."
[3] "The reaction between cyclooctadiene-1.5 and cyclododecatriene-1.5.9 with pentene-2, by a non-consecutive reaction, yields a unit =CH-CH2-CHz-CH=."
[4] "The distribution of telomers follows a statistical law."
[5] "We have proposed a reaction scheme in agreement with the observed facts in the disproportionation of acyclic olefins, the polymerization of cyclic olefins, and the telomerization of cyclic olefins by acyclic olefins."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two main schemes: two-site and one-site. In the two-site scheme, the active sites of the catalyst are responsible for both the formation and rearrangement of double bonds. This scheme explains the generation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates during both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The formation of these intermediates is crucial for the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. The one-site scheme, on the other hand, focuses on the movement of a single site along the alkane chain, facilitating the rearrangement of double bonds without the necessity of a separate site for alkenes or metallacyclobutanes formation. Both schemes contribute to the reaction selectivity by controlling the distribution of products and ensuring that reactions occur efficiently without the formation of unwanted side products. The detailed understanding of these mechanisms allows for the optimization of catalyst design and conditions, leading to improved performance in alkane metathesis reactions.

The key intermediates involved in the mechanism include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These compounds play essential roles in the rearrangement of alkane structures and the formation of new alkene chains. The alkenes generated from the activation of acyclic olefins facilitate the breaking and reformation of double bonds, while the metallacyclobutanes serve as intermediates in the telomerization process of cyclic olefins. The stability and reactivity of these intermediates are critical factors determining the efficiency and selectivity of the metathesis reactions.

The selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by several factors, including the concentration of reactants, the type of catalyst, and the reaction conditions. The two-site and one-site schemes described above contribute to reaction selectivity by controlling the pathways of the reactions. The formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, as well as their subsequent rearrangement, ensures that the reactions proceed efficiently towards the desired products. Additionally, the control over the distribution of products, as indicated by the statistical law governing the telomerization process, further enhances the selectivity of the catalysts.

The detailed understanding of the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides provides insights into the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for alkane conversions. By optimizing the catalyst design and reaction conditions, it is possible to achieve higher yields of desired products with fewer side reactions, making the process more economically viable and environmentally friendly.
