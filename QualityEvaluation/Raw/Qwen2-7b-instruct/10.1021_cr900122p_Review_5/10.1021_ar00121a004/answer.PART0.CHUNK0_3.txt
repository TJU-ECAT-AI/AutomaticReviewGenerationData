[1] "As originally defined by Berzelius, a catalyst is a material that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself being either consumed or changed."
[2] "While the increase of reaction rates is often desirable, control of reaction selectivity or product distribution is also a key ingredient in a successful catalytic process."
[3] "The catalyst selects among available reaction channels (thermody- namically allowed) to yield desirable products while blocking the formation of undesirable species."
[4] "In many cases involving solid catalysts these pathways consist of an adsorption step, followed by a surface reaction and finally desorption of the product."
[5] "The understanding of such processes rests upon our molecular level un- derstanding of the adsorption/desorption reactions, the structure of catalytic surfaces, and the bonding and coordination of reaction intermediates to these surfaces."
[6] "Such small samples can have a high degree of homogeneity and can even be obtained in single crystal form."
[7] "The use of such single crystals as model catalysts has greatly accelerated the rate of development of catalysis science."
[8] "The methodology used in the study of catalysis has changed drastically over the past 15 years."
[9] "Presently,catalyst samples with surface areas as low as 1 cm2 are sufficient for study by a number of techniques under ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) conditions."
[10] "Many techniques have been developed for the direct study of surfaces and have been applied to catalysis."
[11] "The atomic scale characterization of catalytic surfaces has often been performed under UHV conditions ( 10-10-10-9 torr)."
[12] "These conditions are necessitated by the need to keep sample surfaces clean of contamination and the need to use electron or ion spectroscopies."
[13] "In order to overcome this difficulty, we have designed an apparatus for combined UHV surface analysis and high-pressure catalytic re- action studies over small surface area amp1es."
[14] "The surface science studies of catalytic reactions that have been performed to date indicate that there are three types of metal-based catalytic systems:"
[15] "The synthesis of ammonia from stoichiometric mix- tures of H2 and N2 has been studied over clean iron and rhenium single-crystal surfaces having a variety of crystallographic orientations."
[16] "Initial sticking coefficients vary in the ratio 60:3:1 on the Fe- (lll), Fe (loo),and Fe (110) surfaces, respectively."
[17] "We have studied the synthesis of ammonia over these surfaces (Figure 2) and found that the activity follows the same trend as the sticking coefficient, the relative rates being 418:25:1."
[18] "Although both the Fe (111) and Re (1120) surfaces contain atoms having sevenfold coordination,the most active Re surface, Re (1121),does not."
[19] "The ammonia synthesis reaction was also studied over rhenium single-crystal surfaces. Once again, the re- activity varies drastically with surface structure, ranging over more than 3 orders of magnitude among the sur- faces studied (Figure 3)."
[20] "It is apparent that surface roughness is requisite for the dissociative chemisorption of N2."
[21] "It appears that reactions occurring directly on metal surfaces are sensitive to the local surface structure."
[22] "Open or rough surfaces that expose sites of high coor- dination in either the first or second atomic layer of the surface show especially high catalytic activity."
[23] "Recent theoretical studies have related the electronic structure of high coordination sites with observed cat- alytic activity."
[24] "The stability of ethylidyne in the presence of high pressures of hydrogen and ethylene has been studied by using HREELS and radiation techniques with deu- terated and 14C-labeled ethylidyne, repectively."
[25] "From our results it is apparent that ethylidyne forms and that it is permanently present on the metal surface during ethylene hydrogenation reactions."
[26] "The role of the metal in this case is to dissociate hy- drogen and to act as a template for the active ethylidyne species."
[27] "One of the most important results of our studies is the observation that ethylidyne fragments are present on the metal surface even after the ethylene hydro- genation reaction."
[28] "The stability of this species under reaction conditions suggests that it is not, in fact, a direct intermediate for the formation of ethane."
[29] "Rather, we propose that it facilitates the transfer of hydrogen, dissociated by the metal surface,to ethylene that is weakly adsorbed to ethylidyne overlayer."
[30] "Further studies are necessary to prove this proposition."
[31] "The extraction of sulfur from sulfur-containing or- ganic molecules is achieved by the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process."
[32] "At monolayer coverages sulfur is adsorbed atomically in a lattice with a p(2 X 1) structure with respect to the substrate."
[33] "The heat of desorption, estimated from thermal desorption data,is about 110 kcal/mol."
[34] "The appearance of a second peak in the TD spectra at higher coverages indicates the creation of a second, more weakly bound, sulfur adsorption state."
[35] "The formation of a p(2 X 1) lattice at monolayer coverages suggests that the additional sulfur atoms are in fact bound to a different site, pos- sibly in a bridged configuration."
[36] "Isotope-la- beling studies using 35S indicate that the sulfur de- posited under UHV conditions remains on the surface during the reaction, retarding the reaction rate."
[37] "Sulfiding of the Mo surface to coverages greater than -0.6 monolayer does not result in significant further re- duction in the HDS rate."
[38] "Although the effect of sulfiding the catalyst is primarily one of site blocking, reducing overall activity, it also induces a change in the product selectivities."
[39] "Conversion of n-hexane over platinum catalysts occurs via a number of reactions including isomeriza- tion, cyclization, dehydrocyclization, and hydrogenoly- sis."
[40] "Gold itself is inactive as a catalyst for these molecular rearrangements."
[41] "However, when added to a Pt single- crystal surface it will alter the product distribution markedly."
[42] "This observation is usually explained by pointing out the important role that the high-symmetry threefold platinum sites play in the dehydrocyclization and hy- drogenolysis reactions."
[43] "In order to explain the large increase in the rate of isomerization, one must invoke the formation of mixed Pt-Au sites that are more active than the pure Pt."
