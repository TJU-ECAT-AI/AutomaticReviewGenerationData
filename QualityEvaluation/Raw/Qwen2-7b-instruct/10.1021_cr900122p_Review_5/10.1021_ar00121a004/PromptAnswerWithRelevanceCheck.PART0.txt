[1] "The combined use of UHV surface analytical tools and the ability to perform catalytic reactions over single-crystal surfaces under conditions that truly approach those of industrial processes have revealed detailed characteristics of these systems hitherto unobtainable."
[2] "The need for atomically rough surfaces containing high-coordination hollowing sites where N2 can dissociate has been revealed."
[3] "Reactions of this type cannot occur on single transition-metal atom molecules that are utilized most frequently in homogeneous catalysis."
[4] "The catalytic hydrogenation of ethylene by Pt and Rh has been shown to occur over an irreducible, carbonaceous overlayer primarily composed of adsorbed ethylidyne."
[5] "It has been suggested that this overlayer serves as a medium through which atomic hydrogen, from H2 dissociation by the metal, is transferred to ethylene, weakly adsorbed on the ethylidyne layer."
[6] "Coadsorbates modify the rates and product distributions of catalytic reactions by blocking sites of high symmetry, by creating new sites, or by charge transfer that changes bonding of reaction intermediates."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The literature does not provide specific details on the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. However, it does discuss methodologies and techniques used in studying catalytic reactions, particularly focusing on the use of ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions for atomic scale characterization of catalytic surfaces. It also mentions the impact of coadsorbates on reaction rates and product distributions by blocking sites, creating new sites, or facilitating charge transfer that alters bonding of reaction intermediates.

The literature does not provide enough information to describe the specific mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides in detail. It discusses general aspects of catalytic reactions, such as the use of UHV techniques for studying surfaces and the role of coadsorbates in modifying reaction dynamics. To fully answer the question, one would need a more detailed study or article specifically focused on this type of catalyst and its application in alkane metathesis.

[1] "The ammonia synthesis reaction was also studied over rhenium single-crystal surfaces having a variety of crystallographic orientations."
[2] "Once again, the reactivity varies drastically with surface structure, ranging over more than 3 orders of magnitude among the surfaces studied."
[3] "Higher activity was associated with surfaces having open topography."
[4] "It appears that reactions occurring directly on metal surfaces are sensitive to the local surface structure."
[5] "Open or rough surfaces that expose sites of high coordination in either the first or second atomic layer of the surface show especially high catalytic activity."
[6] "Surface roughening can be introduced by using high Miller indices surfaces with high densities of steps and kinks."
[7] "Catalysis on an active overlayer: The hydrogenation of ethylene Platinum and rhodium single crystals are good catalysts for the hydrogenation of ethylene at temperatures of 300-400 K and atmospheric pressures."
[8] "The surfaces were analyzed before and after reaction using AES, LEED, TDS, HREELS, and a 14C radiotracer technique that monitors the rate of removal of labeled carbon from the surface."
[9] "Kinetic parameters for ethylene hydrogenation over a Pt (111) surface compare well with those found using other forms of platinum (films, small particles),"
[10] "Furthermore, the absolute values of the reaction rates, expressed as turnover frequencies (ethane molecules former per surface Pt atom per second), are all within the same order of magnitude."

Answer: 

The ammonia synthesis reaction involves the conversion of hydrogen and nitrogen gases into ammonia. The reaction's activity is significantly influenced by the surface structure of the metal catalyst, particularly the presence of open topography and sites of high coordination. High coordination sites in the first or second atomic layer of the surface facilitate the dissociative adsorption of nitrogen. Surface roughening, which exposes such high coordination sites, enhances catalytic activity. For instance, in the case of iron surfaces, the Fe(111) surface, which contains atoms with C7 coordination, showed the highest activity compared to the Fe(110) surface, which lacks such sites.

The hydrogenation of ethylene occurs on an active overlayer composed primarily of adsorbed ethylidyne (CCH3) species. This overlayer serves as a medium through which atomic hydrogen, dissociated by the metal surface, is transferred to ethylene, which is weakly adsorbed on the ethylidyne layer. The stability of ethylidyne under reaction conditions suggests that it is not a direct intermediate for ethane formation but facilitates the transfer of hydrogen to ethylene.

Answer: 

氨合成反应涉及氢气和氮气的转换成氨。反应的活性受到金属催化剂表面结构的影响，特别是开放地形和高配位点的存在。在第一或第二原子层的表面，高配位点促进了氮的离解吸附。表面粗糙化，暴露了这些高配位点，增强了催化活性。例如，在铁表面上，Fe(111)表面含有C7配位的原子，显示出最高活性，与缺乏此类站点的Fe(110)表面相比。

乙烯的氢化发生在活性层上，主要由吸附的乙基炔（CCH3）物种组成。这个覆盖层充当了金属表面释放的氢原子转移到弱吸附在乙基炔层上的乙烯的媒介。乙基炔在反应条件下的稳定性表明，它不是乙烷形成直接的中间体，而是促进氢原子转移到乙烯。

[1] "As originally defined by Berzelius, a catalyst is a material that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself being either consumed or changed."
[2] "While the increase of reaction rates is often desirable, control of reaction selectivity or product distribution is also a key ingredient in a successful catalytic process."
[3] "The catalyst selects among available reaction channels (thermody- namically allowed) to yield desirable products while blocking the formation of undesirable species."
[4] "In many cases involving solid catalysts these pathways consist of an adsorption step, followed by a surface reaction and finally desorption of the product."
[5] "The understanding of such processes rests upon our molecular level un- derstanding of the adsorption/desorption reactions, the structure of catalytic surfaces, and the bonding and coordination of reaction intermediates to these surfaces."
[6] "Such small samples can have a high degree of homogeneity and can even be obtained in single crystal form."
[7] "The use of such single crystals as model catalysts has greatly accelerated the rate of development of catalysis science."
[8] "The methodology used in the study of catalysis has changed drastically over the past 15 years."
[9] "Presently,catalyst samples with surface areas as low as 1 cm2 are sufficient for study by a number of techniques under ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) conditions."
[10] "Many techniques have been developed for the direct study of surfaces and have been applied to catalysis."
[11] "The atomic scale characterization of catalytic surfaces has often been performed under UHV conditions ( 10-10-10-9 torr)."
[12] "These conditions are necessitated by the need to keep sample surfaces clean of contamination and the need to use electron or ion spectroscopies."
[13] "In order to overcome this difficulty, we have designed an apparatus for combined UHV surface analysis and high-pressure catalytic re- action studies over small surface area amp1es."
[14] "The surface science studies of catalytic reactions that have been performed to date indicate that there are three types of metal-based catalytic systems:"
[15] "The synthesis of ammonia from stoichiometric mix- tures of H2 and N2 has been studied over clean iron and rhenium single-crystal surfaces having a variety of crystallographic orientations."
[16] "Initial sticking coefficients vary in the ratio 60:3:1 on the Fe- (lll), Fe (loo),and Fe (110) surfaces, respectively."
[17] "We have studied the synthesis of ammonia over these surfaces (Figure 2) and found that the activity follows the same trend as the sticking coefficient, the relative rates being 418:25:1."
[18] "Although both the Fe (111) and Re (1120) surfaces contain atoms having sevenfold coordination,the most active Re surface, Re (1121),does not."
[19] "The ammonia synthesis reaction was also studied over rhenium single-crystal surfaces. Once again, the re- activity varies drastically with surface structure, ranging over more than 3 orders of magnitude among the sur- faces studied (Figure 3)."
[20] "It is apparent that surface roughness is requisite for the dissociative chemisorption of N2."
[21] "It appears that reactions occurring directly on metal surfaces are sensitive to the local surface structure."
[22] "Open or rough surfaces that expose sites of high coor- dination in either the first or second atomic layer of the surface show especially high catalytic activity."
[23] "Recent theoretical studies have related the electronic structure of high coordination sites with observed cat- alytic activity."
[24] "The stability of ethylidyne in the presence of high pressures of hydrogen and ethylene has been studied by using HREELS and radiation techniques with deu- terated and 14C-labeled ethylidyne, repectively."
[25] "From our results it is apparent that ethylidyne forms and that it is permanently present on the metal surface during ethylene hydrogenation reactions."
[26] "The role of the metal in this case is to dissociate hy- drogen and to act as a template for the active ethylidyne species."
[27] "One of the most important results of our studies is the observation that ethylidyne fragments are present on the metal surface even after the ethylene hydro- genation reaction."
[28] "The stability of this species under reaction conditions suggests that it is not, in fact, a direct intermediate for the formation of ethane."
[29] "Rather, we propose that it facilitates the transfer of hydrogen, dissociated by the metal surface,to ethylene that is weakly adsorbed to ethylidyne overlayer."
[30] "Further studies are necessary to prove this proposition."
[31] "The extraction of sulfur from sulfur-containing or- ganic molecules is achieved by the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process."
[32] "At monolayer coverages sulfur is adsorbed atomically in a lattice with a p(2 X 1) structure with respect to the substrate."
[33] "The heat of desorption, estimated from thermal desorption data,is about 110 kcal/mol."
[34] "The appearance of a second peak in the TD spectra at higher coverages indicates the creation of a second, more weakly bound, sulfur adsorption state."
[35] "The formation of a p(2 X 1) lattice at monolayer coverages suggests that the additional sulfur atoms are in fact bound to a different site, pos- sibly in a bridged configuration."
[36] "Isotope-la- beling studies using 35S indicate that the sulfur de- posited under UHV conditions remains on the surface during the reaction, retarding the reaction rate."
[37] "Sulfiding of the Mo surface to coverages greater than -0.6 monolayer does not result in significant further re- duction in the HDS rate."
[38] "Although the effect of sulfiding the catalyst is primarily one of site blocking, reducing overall activity, it also induces a change in the product selectivities."
[39] "Conversion of n-hexane over platinum catalysts occurs via a number of reactions including isomeriza- tion, cyclization, dehydrocyclization, and hydrogenoly- sis."
[40] "Gold itself is inactive as a catalyst for these molecular rearrangements."
[41] "However, when added to a Pt single- crystal surface it will alter the product distribution markedly."
[42] "This observation is usually explained by pointing out the important role that the high-symmetry threefold platinum sites play in the dehydrocyclization and hy- drogenolysis reactions."
[43] "In order to explain the large increase in the rate of isomerization, one must invoke the formation of mixed Pt-Au sites that are more active than the pure Pt."
