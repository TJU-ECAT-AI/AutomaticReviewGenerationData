Answer: 

The ammonia synthesis reaction involves the conversion of hydrogen and nitrogen gases into ammonia. The reaction's activity is significantly influenced by the surface structure of the metal catalyst, particularly the presence of open topography and sites of high coordination. High coordination sites in the first or second atomic layer of the surface facilitate the dissociative adsorption of nitrogen. Surface roughening, which exposes such high coordination sites, enhances catalytic activity. For instance, in the case of iron surfaces, the Fe(111) surface, which contains atoms with C7 coordination, showed the highest activity compared to the Fe(110) surface, which lacks such sites.

The hydrogenation of ethylene occurs on an active overlayer composed primarily of adsorbed ethylidyne (CCH3) species. This overlayer serves as a medium through which atomic hydrogen, dissociated by the metal surface, is transferred to ethylene, which is weakly adsorbed on the ethylidyne layer. The stability of ethylidyne under reaction conditions suggests that it is not a direct intermediate for ethane formation but facilitates the transfer of hydrogen to ethylene.

Answer: 

氨合成反应涉及氢气和氮气的转换成氨。反应的活性受到金属催化剂表面结构的影响，特别是开放地形和高配位点的存在。在第一或第二原子层的表面，高配位点促进了氮的离解吸附。表面粗糙化，暴露了这些高配位点，增强了催化活性。例如，在铁表面上，Fe(111)表面含有C7配位的原子，显示出最高活性，与缺乏此类站点的Fe(110)表面相比。

乙烯的氢化发生在活性层上，主要由吸附的乙基炔（CCH3）物种组成。这个覆盖层充当了金属表面释放的氢原子转移到弱吸附在乙基炔层上的乙烯的媒介。乙基炔在反应条件下的稳定性表明，它不是乙烷形成直接的中间体，而是促进氢原子转移到乙烯。
