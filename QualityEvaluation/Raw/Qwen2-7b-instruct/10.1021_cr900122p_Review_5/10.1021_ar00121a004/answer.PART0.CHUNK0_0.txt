[1] "The combined use of UHV surface analytical tools and the ability to perform catalytic reactions over single-crystal surfaces under conditions that truly approach those of industrial processes have revealed detailed characteristics of these systems hitherto unobtainable."
[2] "The need for atomically rough surfaces containing high-coordination hollowing sites where N2 can dissociate has been revealed."
[3] "Reactions of this type cannot occur on single transition-metal atom molecules that are utilized most frequently in homogeneous catalysis."
[4] "The catalytic hydrogenation of ethylene by Pt and Rh has been shown to occur over an irreducible, carbonaceous overlayer primarily composed of adsorbed ethylidyne."
[5] "It has been suggested that this overlayer serves as a medium through which atomic hydrogen, from H2 dissociation by the metal, is transferred to ethylene, weakly adsorbed on the ethylidyne layer."
[6] "Coadsorbates modify the rates and product distributions of catalytic reactions by blocking sites of high symmetry, by creating new sites, or by charge transfer that changes bonding of reaction intermediates."
