Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

Unfortunately, the provided document does not contain information about silica-supported tantalum hydrides or the mechanism of alkane metathesis. The document focuses on the surface science studies of catalysis, including the ammonia synthesis reaction, hydrogenation of ethylene, hydrodesulfurization of thiophene, conversion of n-hexane, and hydrogenation of carbon monoxide. It discusses the role of surface structure, adsorbates, and the kinetic parameters of these catalytic reactions. However, there is no mention of silica-supported tantalum hydrides or the specific details of alkane metathesis catalysis. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an analysis based on the given content.
