          [1] "The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes."
          [2] "In linear alkane transformations, the mechanism typically proceeds via the formation of an intermediate alkene."
          [3] "For cyclic alkane transformations, the formation of metallacyclobutanes plays a crucial role."
          [4] "Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes are formed during the reaction."
          [5] "These factors contribute significantly to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance."

          Alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides follows mechanisms involving both two-site and one-site schemes. In linear alkane transformations, an intermediate alkene is typically formed, while for cyclic alkane transformations, the creation of metallacyclobutanes is pivotal. Alkenes and metallacyclobutanes act as key intermediates during the reaction, significantly impacting its selectivity and the performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
