          "[1] Among the objectives of such studies is the synthesis of surface-anchored complexes with a predefined co-ordination sphere.
          
          [2] The reactivity of organometallic complexes with the surface functional groups of amorphous inorganic oxides has been extensively studied during the last twenty years; the rules which govern this chemistry compare with those of molecular organometallic chemistry.
          
          [3] The formation of neopentane or HCl as the result of the complex-support interaction indicates that at least one type of chemical reaction takes place, which must be an electrophilic attack of surface protons on an X ligand.
          
          [4] Niobia, when compared to oxides such as silica-alumina for example, presents very strong Lewis-acid sites in the low-temperature domain (373-573 K) (this occurs only above 773 K for silica-alumina)."

          The synthesis of surface-anchored complexes with a predefined coordination sphere and the extensive study of the reactivity of organometallic complexes with the surface functional groups of amorphous inorganic oxides have been key objectives over the past two decades. The rules governing this chemistry align with those of molecular organometallic chemistry. The formation of neopentane or HCl from the interaction between the complex and the support suggests that there is at least one type of chemical reaction occurring, involving an electrophilic attack of surface protons on an X ligand. Moreover, niobia demonstrates exceptionally strong Lewis-acid sites in the low-temperature range (373-573 K), whereas silica-alumina exhibits such sites only above 773 K.

          在过去的二十年中，研究人员的主要目标之一是合成具有预定义配位球的表面锚定复合物，并且已经对无定形无机氧化物表面功能基团与有机金属复合物的反应性进行了广泛研究。这类化学规则与分子有机金属化学中的规则相对应。从复合物与支撑材料的相互作用中形成新戊烷或HCl表明至少发生了一种化学反应，涉及表面质子对X配体的亲电攻击。此外，与二氧化硅-氧化铝等氧化物相比，铌酸盐在低温范围内（373-573 K）表现出极强的路易斯酸位点，而二氧化硅-氧化铝只在高于773 K时才表现出此类位点。
