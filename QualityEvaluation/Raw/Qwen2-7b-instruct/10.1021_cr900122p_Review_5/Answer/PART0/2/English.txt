The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes, with processes involving linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves examining both two-site and one-site schemes. Linear and cyclic alkane transformations are central processes, with alkenes and metallacyclobutanes acting as significant intermediates. These factors contribute to the reaction's selectivity and the catalyst's performance in different alkane conversions.

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the structure and properties of silica surfaces. Silica surfaces consist of silanols and various types of siloxane bridges, which can be isolated, vicinal, or geminal. Higher temperatures decrease the OH density, forming reactive siloxane bridges, and this process reduces the specific surface area. The support can be considered a large monodentate siloxy ligand (Scheme 1). The high reactivity of the system is attributed to the asymmetry at the metal center, featuring a combination of strong and weak Ïƒ-donor ligands, neopentyl and siloxy groups, respectively (Scheme 2b). This system exhibits specific properties as a highly reactive alkene metathesis heterogeneous catalyst. Notably, while going from Re to Mo, the initial activity is not improved, but the Mo system offers better selectivity and stability, albeit with slower metathesis rates. On alumina, it facilitates the formation of highly reactive cationic species or masked carbenic species with unusual structures. Despite being a highly active alkene metathesis catalyst, no carbenic species have been detected. These resting states likely correspond to the catalyst's actual propagating carbene species present when alkenes are present (Scheme 10b) [62,63].

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves considering two main schemes: the two-site and one-site mechanisms. In the two-site mechanism, the catalyst facilitates the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes through a series of steps. In contrast, the one-site mechanism involves a single step where the alkane structure rearranges. Linear alkane transformations tend to be more efficient due to their simpler structure. However, cyclic alkane transformations often necessitate more complex catalysts and conditions. Key intermediates in the process are alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which significantly impact the reaction pathway. The selectivity and performance of the catalysts in various alkane conversions are determined by factors such as metal type and ligand choice.

This question focuses on the characterization and mechanism of a remarkable catalyst used for alkane activation and hydrogenolysis. It explores the regioselectivity of carbon-hydrogen bond activation in propane, the stoichiometric reactions, the kinetics of the catalytic deuteration process, and the theoretical calculations supporting the stability and activation of specific alkyl groups.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two main schemes: a two-site approach and a one-site scheme. In the two-site approach, the reaction consists of transferring a single carbon from one alkane chain to another, involving both the cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds. The one-site scheme utilizes multifunctional single-site catalysts capable of alkane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and olefin hydrogenation. For linear alkanes, this reaction typically results in the formation of lower (Cn) and higher (Cn+2) homologues, with the selectivity favoring the Cn+2 product. However, in the case of branched alkanes like 2-methylpropane, the reaction can be unexpectedly transformed into higher homologues, such as 2,3-dimethylbutane, through the transfer of two carbons. The catalyst, W(H)3/Al2O3500, facilitates this transformation with high selectivity. The catalyst's ability to catalyze the productive metathesis of 2-methylpropene into 2,3-dimethylbutene is noteworthy, as it represents a unique pathway for branched alkane metathesis. This catalyst system also exhibits high octane number in the resulting products, enhancing its potential for fuel applications.

The literature provided does not contain any information related to the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. Therefore, it is impossible to analyze the mechanism, discuss the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates, or how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions based on the given text.

In the context of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, the comprehensive mechanism involves both two-site and one-site schemes. Linear and cyclic alkane transformations are facilitated through the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by the ability of the silica support to act as an inert support, stabilize metal complexes, modify adsorption properties, concentrate reactants, preactivate reactants, or help stabilize transition states. Molecular imprinting of metal complexes plays a crucial role in the design of catalysts capable of catalyzing cascade reactions.

Olefin metathesis, a reaction catalyzed by organometallic compounds, plays an increasingly important role in the synthesis of basic and fine-chemical olefins and polymers (polyalkenamers). Despite the use of various catalytic methods, including homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, in eight industrial processes, the metathesis of functionalized olefins remains challenging due to issues such as high catalyst concentrations and catalyst poisoning. Our recent discovery demonstrates that MTO (la) and its higher homologues, when supported on acidic metal oxides, form effective metathesis catalysts capable of operating without additives, even for functionalized olefins. Catalyst I, in particular, functions at room temperature and is suitable for the metathesis of simple open-chain and cyclic olefins. The efficiency of catalyst I surpasses that of ReO3, which requires the use of organotin compounds for the metathesis of functionalized olefins. This finding highlights the potential of MTO-based catalysts in overcoming the limitations encountered in the metathesis of functionalized olefins.

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the reaction pathways for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the catalytic cycle. The process begins with the cleavage of a C-H bond in an acyclic alkane, such as ethane, through a bond metathesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl species. The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group, necessitating the cleavage and formation of C-C bonds. Two possibilities exist for this step: oxidative addition or a bond metathesis mechanism. The oxidative addition yields a dimethyl(ethyl)tantalum(V) surface complex, while the bond metathesis mechanism involves a four-centered transition state with an sp3 carbon in the middle of the metallocycle. This mechanism operates similarly for higher alkanes, such as propane, leading to the formation of n-butane and isobutane, followed by the formation of a tantalum-ethyl complex. In the case of branched alkanes, such as isobutane, the formation of neopentane results from the methyl transfer step on the tantalum-tert-butyl species, although this is disfavored due to steric reasons. The metathesis reaction produces a wide range of hydrocarbons, including higher and lower homologs, with ethane undergoing a rapid secondary reaction leading to the formation of butane and especially isobutane. The catalyst's performance varies depending on the alkane's structure, with neopentane showing a different behavior compared to other branched alkanes due to steric hindrance.

Linear alkane transformations involve the rearrangement of carbon-carbon single bonds to form new double bonds, while cyclic alkane transformations lead to the formation of metallacyclobutanes, which are critical intermediates in the reaction.

The review discusses the significant advancements in the field of alkane activation and functionalization using homogeneous transition metal catalysts. It highlights the focus on catalytic alkane functionalization, both organometallic and bioinorganic.

Higher temperatures decrease the OH density, forming reactive siloxane bridges, and this process reduces the specific surface area. The support can be considered a large monodentate siloxy ligand (Scheme 1). The high reactivity of the system is attributed to the asymmetry at the metal center, featuring a combination of strong and weak Ïƒ-donor ligands, neopentyl and siloxy groups, respectively (Scheme 2b). This system exhibits specific properties as a highly reactive alkene metathesis heterogeneous catalyst. Notably, while going from Re to Mo, the initial activity is not improved, but the Mo system offers better selectivity and stability, albeit with slower metathesis rates. On alumina, it facilitates the formation of highly reactive cationic species or masked carbenic species with unusual structures. Despite being a highly active alkene metathesis catalyst, no carbenic species have been detected. These resting states likely correspond to the catalyst's actual propagating carbene species present when alkenes are present (Scheme 10b) [62,63].

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves considering two main schemes: the two-site and one-site mechanisms. In the two-site mechanism, the catalyst facilitates the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes through a series of steps. In contrast, the one-site mechanism involves a single step where the alkane structure rearranges. Linear alkane transformations tend to be more efficient due to their simpler structure. However, cyclic alkane transformations often necessitate more complex catalysts and conditions. Key intermediates in the process are alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which significantly impact the reaction pathway. The selectivity and performance of the catalysts in various alkane conversions are determined by factors such as metal type and ligand choice.

This question focuses on the characterization and mechanism of a remarkable catalyst used for alkane activation and hydrogenolysis. It explores the regioselectivity of carbon-hydrogen bond activation in propane, the stoichiometric reactions, the kinetics of the catalytic deuteration process, and the theoretical calculations supporting the stability and activation of specific alkyl groups.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two main schemes: a two-site approach and a one-site scheme. In the two-site approach, the reaction consists of transferring a single carbon from one alkane chain to another, involving both the cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds. The one-site scheme utilizes multifunctional single-site catalysts capable of alkane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and olefin hydrogenation. For linear alkanes, this reaction typically results in the formation of lower (Cn) and higher (Cn+2) homologues, with the selectivity favoring the Cn+2 product. However, in the case of branched alkanes like 2-methylpropane, the reaction can be unexpectedly transformed into higher homologues, such as 2,3-dimethylbutane, through the transfer of two carbons. The catalyst, W(H)3/Al2O3500, facilitates this transformation with high selectivity. The catalyst's ability to catalyze the productive metathesis of 2-methylpropene into 2,3-dimethylbutene is noteworthy, as it represents a unique pathway for branched alkane metathesis. This catalyst system also exhibits high octane number in the resulting products, enhancing its potential for fuel applications.

The literature provided does not contain any information related to the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. Therefore, it is impossible to analyze the mechanism, discuss the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates, or how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions based on the given text.

In the context of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, the comprehensive mechanism involves both two-site and one-site schemes. Linear and cyclic alkane transformations are facilitated through the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by the ability of the silica support to act as an inert support, stabilize metal complexes, modify adsorption properties, concentrate reactants, preactivate reactants, or help stabilize transition states. Molecular imprinting of metal complexes plays a crucial role in the design of catalysts capable of catalyzing cascade reactions.

Olefin metathesis, a reaction catalyzed by organometallic compounds, plays an increasingly important role in the synthesis of basic and fine-chemical olefins and polymers (polyalkenamers). Despite the use of various catalytic methods, including homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, in eight industrial processes, the metathesis of functionalized olefins remains challenging due to issues such as high catalyst concentrations and catalyst poisoning. Our recent discovery demonstrates that MTO (la) and its higher homologues, when supported on acidic metal oxides, form effective metathesis catalysts capable of operating without additives, even for functionalized olefins. Catalyst I, in particular, functions at room temperature and is suitable for the metathesis of simple open-chain and cyclic olefins. The efficiency of catalyst I surpasses that of ReO3, which requires the use of organotin compounds for the metathesis of functionalized olefins. This finding highlights the potential of MTO-based catalysts in overcoming the limitations encountered in the metathesis of functionalized olefins.

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the reaction pathways for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the catalytic cycle. The process begins with the cleavage of a C-H bond in an acyclic alkane, such as ethane, through a bond metathesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl species. The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group, necessitating the cleavage and formation of C-C bonds. Two possibilities exist for this step: oxidative addition or a bond metathesis mechanism. The oxidative addition yields a dimethyl(ethyl)tantalum(V) surface complex, while the bond metathesis mechanism involves a four-centered transition state with an sp3 carbon in the middle of the metallocycle. This mechanism operates similarly for higher alkanes, such as propane, leading to the formation of n-butane and isobutane, followed by the formation of a tantalum-ethyl complex. In the case of branched alkanes, such as isobutane, the formation of neopentane results from the methyl transfer step on the tantalum-tert-butyl species, although this is disfavored due to steric reasons. The metathesis reaction produces a wide range of hydrocarbons, including higher and lower homologs, with ethane undergoing a rapid secondary reaction leading to the formation of butane and especially isobutane. The catalyst's performance varies depending on the alkane's structure, with neopentane showing a different behavior compared to other branched alkanes due to steric hindrance.

Linear alkane transformations involve the rearrangement of carbon-carbon single bonds to form new double bonds, while cyclic alkane transformations lead to the formation of metallacyclobutanes, which are critical intermediates in the reaction.

The review discusses the significant advancements in the field of alkane activation and functionalization using homogeneous transition metal catalysts. It highlights the focus on catalytic alkane functionalization, both organometallic and bioinorganic. However, achieving a tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization remains elusive, and addressing the mechanistic issues has proven to be particularly challenging.
