          [2] "Metathesis reactions of alkanes seem to involve, at least to some extent, the reaction of all C-C bonds."
          [3] "This suggests, as observed for ethane, that the main reaction involves the transfer of a methyl fragment from one molecule of the initial alkane to a second one; the wider product distribution observed with higher alkanes (for example, butane and pentane) (Fig. 2) also suggests the probable occurrence of secondary reactions, the possible transfer of higher alkyl fragments such as ethyl, or both."

          [5] "Branched alkanes such as isobutane or methyl butane also underwent the metathesis reaction; however, neopentane only led to the stoichiometric formation of a surface tantalum-neopentyl species and did not react further, probably for steric reasons."

[1] "The silica-supported transition metal hydrides (23-0-Siz)(=Si-0-),Ta-H and (Si-0-),M-H (M, chromium or tungsten) catalyze the metathesis reaction of linear or branched alkanes into the next higher and lower alkanes at moderate temperature (25" to 200C)."
          [2] "Metathesis reactions of alkanes seem to involve, at least to some extent, the reaction of all C-C bonds."
          [3] "This suggests, as observed for ethane, that the main reaction involves the transfer of a methyl fragment from one molecule of the initial alkane to a second one; the wider product distribution observed with higher alkanes (for example, butane and pentane) (Fig. 2) also suggests the probable occurrence of secondary reactions, the possible transfer of higher alkyl fragments such as ethyl, or both."
          [4] "In the case of ethane, secondary reactions seem to occur very soon with the appearance of butane and especially isobutane."
          [5] "Branched alkanes such as isobutane or methyl butane also underwent the metathesis reaction; however, neopentane only led to the stoichiometric formation of a surface tantalum-neopentyl species and did not react further, probably for steric reasons."
          [6] "The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the formation of C-C bonds."
          [7] "Among the known elementary steps, two possibilities can be considered: (i) The oxidative addition of the ethane C-C bond (16) would yield the dimethyl(ethyl)tantalum(V) surface complex;"
          [8] "The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second propane molecule to these propyl intermediates enables the evolution of n-butane and isobutane as well as the formation of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in turn will yield ethane."

"[1] Typically propane gives mainly ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) along with methane and higher C5+ alkanes."
          "[2] Ethylbenzene and methane can also be obtained by cross-metathesis between toluene and ethane."
          "[3] This reaction consists mainly in the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds."
          "[4] The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues remains a great challenge in chemistry, in particular for branched alkanes in view of fuel needs."
          "[5] Herein, we report that 2-methylpropane, in the presence of the W(H)3/Al2O3500 catalyst, is unexpectedly transformed to 2,3-dimethylbutane (2,3-DMB) with a high selectivity."
          "[6] Interestingly, 2,3-DMB exhibits the highest octane number (RON = 104) among the hexane isomers."
          "[7] Similarly, the W(H)3/Al2O3500 catalyst, also unexpectedly transforms 2-methylpropene to 2,3-dimethylbutenes (2,3-DMB=) with a good selectivity which is the first case of productive metathesis of 2-methylpropene."
          "[8] Typically, when 2-methylpropane was passed over the alumina-supported tungsten hydride, W(H)3/Al2O3500, its conversion reached a maximum at 8% and approximately 37 TON were achieved over 43 h."
          "[9] At the pseudo-steady state, the observed selectivities in 2-methylpropane metathesis are 2,3-DMB (41.7%), ethane (41.3%), 2-methylbutane (5.3%), propane (5.2%), methane (1.5%), heptanes (1.0%) and 2-methylpropene (3.1%)."
          "[10] Interestingly the ratio of selectivities of 2,3-DMB/ethane and 2-methylbutane/propane are close to unity."
          "[11] 2-Methylpropene was observed (up to 3.1%) among the products of 2-methylpropane metathesis and therefore, its metathesis was also checked over 1b in a continuous flow reactor."
          "[12] The reaction presented an initial maximal conversion rate of 0.61 moli-C4H8 molW-1 min-1 before reaching a pseudo-plateau."
          "[13] In summary, whereas the metathesis of 2-methylpropene is usually known as a degenerate process with the classical olefin metathesis catalysts, W(H)3/Al2O3500 also proves to be the first compound capable of catalyzing the productive self-metathesis of 2-methylpropene into 2,3-dimethylbutene."
          "[14] Interestingly, 2,3-dimethylbutene has the same carbon skeleton as the major product formed during the metathesis of 2-methylpropane i.e. 2,3-DMB."

          [2] "Metathesis reactions of alkanes seem to involve, at least to some extent, the reaction of all C-C bonds."
          [3] "This suggests, as observed for ethane, that the main reaction involves the transfer of a methyl fragment from one molecule of the initial alkane to a second one; the wider product distribution observed with higher alkanes (for example, butane and pentane) (Fig. 2) also suggests the probable occurrence of secondary reactions, the possible transfer of higher alkyl fragments such as ethyl, or both."

          [5] "Branched alkanes such as isobutane or methyl butane also underwent the metathesis reaction; however, neopentane only led to the stoichiometric formation of a surface tantalum-neopentyl species and did not react further, probably for steric reasons."

          [7] "Among the known elementary steps, two possibilities can be considered: (i) The oxidative addition of the ethane C-C bond (16) would yield the dimethyl(ethyl)tantalum(V) surface complex;"
          [8] "The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second propane molecule to these propyl intermediates enables the evolution of n-butane and isobutane as well as the formation of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in turn will yield ethane."

          [3] "A significant challenge in olefin metathesis is understanding the mechanism of the reaction."
          [4] "This study focuses on the detailed mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides."
          [5] "Two main schemes are considered: the two-site and one-site mechanisms."
          [6] "In the two-site mechanism, the catalyst undergoes a series of steps involving the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes."
          [7] "In the one-site mechanism, the transformation occurs through a single step involving the rearrangement of the alkane structure."
          [8] "Linear alkane transformations are typically more efficient due to their simpler structure."
          [9] "Cyclic alkane transformations, however, often require more complex catalysts and conditions."
          [10] "Key intermediates in the process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the reaction pathway."
          [11] "The selectivity and performance of the catalysts in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as metal type and ligand choice."

[2] "This remarkable catalyst has been characterised on a molecular and atomic level by IR, CP-MAS IH and 3C NMR, EXAFS spectroscopies [5] as well as by microanalysis and other chemical assays and so we are able to write the exact formula for this catalyst, (-SiO)3ZrH, and its derivatives."
          [3] "The stoichiometric reaction of (= SiO)3Zr-H and propane was followed by infrared spectroscopy in situ."
          [4] "As described elsewhere, (= SiO)3Zr-H is prepared by heating = SiOZrNp3 under hydrogen (200 torr) at 165C for 3 h (spectrum (a) of Fig. 1) [1,2]."
          [5] "Propane was removed and each sample was exposed to D20 vapor. Gases given off were quantified by GC. The unique product in each case was propane-d as determined by GC/MS."
          [6] "Kinetic analysis of the catalytic deuteration experiment lends credence to the hypothesis that the activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane is regioselective."
          [7] "The v(C-H) intensity shown is the integrated area of the region 3200-2800 cm- 1 of each spectrum shown in Fig. 2 (data for t > 30 min is not shown in Fig. 3 to 1000 8013

          [8] "This ratio was calculated to be 5.6. In terms of the n/iso type of selectivity determined in the stoichiometric experiments described above (thus taking into account that propane has six primary C-H bonds and only two secondary) one obtains an n/iso ratio of 16.8."
          [9] "Indeed theoretical calculations on scandium n-propyl and iso-propyl fragments [16] indicate that the scandium-carbon ScCH2CH2CH  is 8.5 kcal/mol stronger than that of ScCH(CH3)-."

"[1] Typically propane gives mainly ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) along with methane and higher C5+ alkanes."
          "[2] Ethylbenzene and methane can also be obtained by cross-metathesis between toluene and ethane."
          "[3] This reaction consists mainly in the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds."
          "[4] The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues remains a great challenge in chemistry, in particular for branched alkanes in view of fuel needs."
          "[5] Herein, we report that 2-methylpropane, in the presence of the W(H)3/Al2O3500 catalyst, is unexpectedly transformed to 2,3-dimethylbutane (2,3-DMB) with a high selectivity."
          "[6] Interestingly, 2,3-DMB exhibits the highest octane number (RON = 104) among the hexane isomers."
          "[7] Similarly, the W(H)3/Al2O3500 catalyst, also unexpectedly transforms 2-methylpropene to 2,3-dimethylbutenes (2,3-DMB=) with a good selectivity which is the first case of productive metathesis of 2-methylpropene."
          "[8] Typically, when 2-methylpropane was passed over the alumina-supported tungsten hydride, W(H)3/Al2O3500, its conversion reached a maximum at 8% and approximately 37 TON were achieved over 43 h."
          "[9] At the pseudo-steady state, the observed selectivities in 2-methylpropane metathesis are 2,3-DMB (41.7%), ethane (41.3%), 2-methylbutane (5.3%), propane (5.2%), methane (1.5%), heptanes (1.0%) and 2-methylpropene (3.1%)."
          "[10] Interestingly the ratio of selectivities of 2,3-DMB/ethane and 2-methylbutane/propane are close to unity."
          "[11] 2-Methylpropene was observed (up to 3.1%) among the products of 2-methylpropane metathesis and therefore, its metathesis was also checked over 1b in a continuous flow reactor."
          "[12] The reaction presented an initial maximal conversion rate of 0.61 moli-C4H8 molW-1 min-1 before reaching a pseudo-plateau."
          "[13] In summary, whereas the metathesis of 2-methylpropene is usually known as a degenerate process with the classical olefin metathesis catalysts, W(H)3/Al2O3500 also proves to be the first compound capable of catalyzing the productive self-metathesis of 2-methylpropene into 2,3-dimethylbutene."
          "[14] Interestingly, 2,3-dimethylbutene has the same carbon skeleton as the major product formed during the metathesis of 2-methylpropane i.e. 2,3-DMB."

[8] "The results presented here demonstrate that the Mo imido olefin metathesis catalysts supported on silica exhibit excellent activity, stability, and selectivity."
          [9] "The detailed mechanism of the metathesis process involves the activation of the alkene by the catalyst, followed by a concerted rearrangement leading to the formation of the product alkene."
          [10] "In the case of linear alkane transformations, the catalyst facilitates the cleavage of the alkane backbone, allowing for the recombination of the resulting fragments into a new alkene."
          [11] "For cyclic alkane transformations, the catalyst promotes the opening of the ring structure, leading to the formation of an alkene, which can then undergo further reactions to yield the desired product."
          [12] "Key intermediates in the process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the catalytic cycle."
          [13] "The catalyst's performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as the choice of support material, the nature of the metal center, and the ligand environment."

[1] "Attempts to Fill the Gap Between Enzymatic, Homogeneous, and Heterogeneous Catalysis"
          [2] "In this review, we address the current efforts to bridge the gap between enzymatic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous catalysis."
          [3] "Catalysts that mimic enzymes, which are capable of performing complex reactions with high specificity and efficiency, have been extensively studied."
          [4] "Catalytic antibodies, imprinting transition state analogues, and combining transition state shape recognition with active sites are discussed."
          [5] "Homogeneous and homogeneous-supported catalysts, which can act as inert supports, stabilize metal complexes, modify adsorption properties, preactivate reactants, or help stabilize transition states, are also considered."
          [6] "The design of multisite catalysts for cascading reactions is highlighted."
          [7] "Conclusions on the current state and future perspectives of bridging the gap between enzymatic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous catalysis are presented."

"[1] The olefin metathesis is a reaction catalyzed by organo- metallic compounds, and its significance for the synthesis of basic and fine-chemical olefins as well as of polymers (poly- alkenamers) is steadily increasing."
          "[2] Variants, including both homogeneous and heterogenous catalysis, are presently used in eight technical p r o c e s  e s , [ but the metathesis of functionalized olefins still presents problems (e.g., high cata- lyst concentrations, catalyst poisoning)."
          "[3] We have now discovered that the title compound MTO (la) and higher homologues (RReO,, R = alkyl, aryl) on acidic metal oxide supports form metathesis catalysts that are active without additives even for functionalized ole fin.]"
          "[4] Catalyst I operates at room temperature and is also suitable for the metathesis of simple open-chain and cyclic olefins (Table 1 and 2)."
          "[5] Otherwise frequent side reactions such as double-bond isomerization and olefin dimerization are insignificant in the presence of 1."
          "[6] Figures 1 and 2 show that I is a more efficient catalyst than Re,O,, which for functionalized olefins is active only in the presence of organotin compounds."

[1] "The silica-supported transition metal hydrides (23-0-Siz)(=Si-0-),Ta-H and (Si-0-),M-H (M, chromium or tungsten) catalyze the metathesis reaction of linear or branched alkanes into the next higher and lower alkanes at moderate temperature (25" to 200C)."
          [2] "Metathesis reactions of alkanes seem to involve, at least to some extent, the reaction of all C-C bonds."
          [3] "This suggests, as observed for ethane, that the main reaction involves the transfer of a methyl fragment from one molecule of the initial alkane to a second one; the wider product distribution observed with higher alkanes (for example, butane and pentane) (Fig. 2) also suggests the probable occurrence of secondary reactions, the possible transfer of higher alkyl fragments such as ethyl, or both."
          [4] "In the case of ethane, secondary reactions seem to occur very soon with the appearance of butane and especially isobutane."
          [5] "Branched alkanes such as isobutane or methyl butane also underwent the metathesis reaction; however, neopentane only led to the stoichiometric formation of a surface tantalum-neopentyl species and did not react further, probably for steric reasons."
          [6] "The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the formation of C-C bonds."
          [7] "Among the known elementary steps, two possibilities can be considered: (i) The oxidative addition of the ethane C-C bond (16) would yield the dimethyl(ethyl)tantalum(V) surface complex;"
          [8] "The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second propane molecule to these propyl intermediates enables the evolution of n-butane and isobutane as well as the formation of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in turn will yield ethane."
          [9] "The metathesis of isobutane is particularly interesting with respect to the product distribution."
          [10] "We can expect that the formation of the tantalum-tert-butyl species can be disfavored (relative to that of the other possible tantalum-isobutyl complex) for steric reasons."

[4] "Linear alkane transformations involve the rearrangement of carbon-carbon single bonds to form new double bonds."
          [5] "Cyclic alkane transformations lead to the formation of metallacyclobutanes, which play a crucial role in the reaction."
          [6] "Alkenes and metallacyclobutanes serve as crucial intermediates during the process."

[1] "The main advances in the title area are reviewed with emphasis on catalytic alkane functionalization, both organometallic and bioinorganic."
          [2] "A tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization is still out of reach and resolving mechanistic problems has proved particularly challenging."
