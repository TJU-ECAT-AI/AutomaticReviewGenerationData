In the two-site approach, the reaction consists of transferring a single carbon from one alkane chain to another, involving both the cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds. The one-site scheme utilizes multifunctional single-site catalysts capable of alkane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and olefin hydrogenation. For linear alkanes, this reaction typically results in the formation of lower (Cn) and higher (Cn+2) homologues, with the selectivity favoring the Cn+2 product. However, in the case of branched alkanes like 2-methylpropane, the reaction can be unexpectedly transformed into higher homologues, such as 2,3-dimethylbutane, through the transfer of two carbons. The catalyst, W(H)3/Al2O3500, facilitates this transformation with high selectivity. The catalyst's ability to catalyze the productive metathesis of 2-methylpropene into 2,3-dimethylbutene is noteworthy, as it represents a unique pathway for branched alkane metathesis.

The key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the catalytic cycle. The process begins with the cleavage of a C-H bond in an acyclic alkane, such as ethane, through a bond metathesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl species. The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group, necessitating the cleavage and formation of C-C bonds. Two possibilities exist for this step: oxidative addition or a bond metathesis mechanism. The oxidative addition yields a dimethyl(ethyl)tantalum(V) surface complex, while the bond metathesis mechanism involves a four-centered transition state with an sp3 carbon in the middle of the metallocycle. This mechanism operates similarly for higher alkanes, such as propane, leading to the formation of n-butane and isobutane, followed by the formation of a tantalum-ethyl complex. In the case of branched alkanes, such as isobutane, the formation of neopentane results from the methyl transfer step on the tantalum-tert-butyl species, although this is disfavored due to steric reasons. The metathesis reaction produces a wide range of hydrocarbons, including higher and lower homologs, with ethane undergoing a rapid secondary reaction leading to the formation of butane and especially isobutane. The catalyst's performance varies depending on the alkane's structure, with neopentane showing a different behavior compared to other branched alkanes due to steric hindrance.", "Doi": "10.1126/science.276.5309.99"},
