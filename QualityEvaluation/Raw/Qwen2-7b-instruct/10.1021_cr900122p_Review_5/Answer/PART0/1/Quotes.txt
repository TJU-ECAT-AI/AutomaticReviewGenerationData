          [5] "Among the known elementary steps, two possibilities can be considered: (i) The oxidative addition of the ethane C-C bond (16) would yield the dim- ethyl(ethyl)tantalum(V) surface complex; reduction of propane from this complex could follow, with the concomitant release of a tantallm-methyl species."
          [6] "Such a mechanism is also operating in the case of higher alkanes.

          [6] "These factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions."

[1] "The silica-supported transition metal hydrides (23-0-Siz)(=Si-0-),Ta-H and (Si-0-),M-H (M, chromium or tungsten) catalyze the metathesis reaction of linear or branched alkanes into the next higher and lower alkanes at moderate temperature (25" to 200C)."
          [2] "With (Si-0-Si=)(=Si-0-),Ta-H, ethane was transformed at room temperature into an equimolar mixture of propane and methane."
          [3] "Metathesis reactions of alkanes seem to involve, at least to some extent, the reaction of all C-C bonds."
          [4] "In the case of ethane, secondary reactions seem to occur very soon with the appearance of butane and especially isobutane, the formation of which necessarily arises from a secondary reaction of propane."
          [5] "Among the known elementary steps, two possibilities can be considered: (i) The oxidative addition of the ethane C-C bond (16) would yield the dim- ethyl(ethyl)tantalum(V) surface complex; reduction of propane from this complex could follow, with the concomitant release of a tantallm-methyl species."
          [6] "Such a mechanism is also operating in the case of higher alkanes. For example, the formation of n-butane and isobutane from propane is determined in the first step of C-H bond activation, which yields two species, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-iso-propyl surface complexes (Scheme 3)."
          [7] "The metathesis of isobutane is particularly interesting with respect to the product distribution."
          [8] "Despite this, the production of neopentane resulting from the methyl transfer step on the tantalum-tert-butyl occurs in substantial amounts."

"[1] Among the objectives of such studies is the synthesis of surface-anchored complexes with a predefined co-ordination sphere.
          
          [2] The reactivity of organometallic complexes with the surface functional groups of amorphous inorganic oxides has been extensively studied during the last twenty years; the rules which govern this chemistry compare with those of molecular organometallic chemistry.
          
          [3] The formation of neopentane or HCl as the result of the complex-support interaction indicates that at least one type of chemical reaction takes place, which must be an electrophilic attack of surface protons on an X ligand.
          
          [4] Niobia, when compared to oxides such as silica-alumina for example, presents very strong Lewis-acid sites in the low-temperature domain (373-573 K) (this occurs only above 773 K for silica-alumina)."

"[1] 'Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride3 prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC).'"
          "[2] 'This system involves a single metal with dual properties and shows that ancillary ligands are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions.'"
          "[3] 'The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources.'"
          "[4] 'Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion (Table 1 and Figure 1).'"
          "[5] 'Firstly, 2,2-dimethylpropane is probably formed by exchange of the neopentyl by a propyl ligand, either directly through σ-bond metathesis or in two steps through CH activation on the neopentylidene unit followed by a decomposition of the penta-coordinated complex through an α-H abstraction to regenerate an alkylidene alkyl/Mo center (1b, R=Et, R=tBu; Scheme 2).'"
          "[6] 'Secondly, 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpentane are probably obtained through cross-metathesis of the neopentylidene ligand attached to the Mo center and a propene moiety, which results from β-H transfer on the propyl chain in 1b, followed by metathesis and subsequent similar reverse steps (insertion of the olefin into a metal hydride and exchange of the ligand by successive CH activation on the carbene ligand and α-H abstraction).'"
          "[10] 'Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis.'"

          [3] "Some homogeneous catalysts, however, are highly stereoselective and can maintain this high stereoselectivity at high conversions."
          [4] "To observe the kinetic product ratio, it is necessary to use very high flow rates and to work at very low conversions9,10 because the strong adsorption of olefins on alumina favors secondary isomerization (degenerate metathesis)."
