The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes, with processes involving linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in determining reaction selectivity and catalyst performance across various alkane conversions. By modifying the alumina surface with trimethylsilyl groups, the adsorption properties are altered, favoring desorption and disfavoring secondary reactions, leading to improved stereoselectivity and activity for propene metathesis, particularly for (Z)-2-butene.

Alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves exploring both two-site and one-site schemes, focusing on the processes of linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. However, achieving a tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization remains a significant challenge, and understanding the mechanisms behind these reactions has proven particularly difficult.
