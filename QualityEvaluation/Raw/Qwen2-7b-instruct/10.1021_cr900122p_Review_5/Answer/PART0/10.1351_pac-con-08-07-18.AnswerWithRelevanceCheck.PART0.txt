          [1] "Alkene metathesis is best described as a four-step process: coordination, [2+2]-cycloaddition and the corresponding reverse step, cycloreversion, and de-coordination."
          [2] "The asymmetry at the metal center is thus optimal because (1) in the first step (coordination), the activation energy associated to the distortion of the metal fragment from a tetrahedron into a trigonal prism is lowered when the incoming alkene coor- dinates trans to the strong σ-donor ligand while the less σ-donor ligand enters the basal plane contain- ing the alkylidene and the alkylidyne ligands and (2) it forms a less stable metallacyclobutane at the second step ([2+2]-cycloaddition)."
          [3] "In fact, CH4 reacts only with AlIII, while H2 reacts with both AlIII and AlIV."
          [4] "These results fully explain the difference of reactivities of alumina vs. silica-supported systems: the former is a highly active polymerization catalyst, while the latter is totally inactive."

          The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a series of steps, including coordination, a [2+2]-cycloaddition forming a metallacyclobutane intermediate, cycloreversion, and de-coordination. The asymmetry at the metal center plays a crucial role in optimizing the activation energy during coordination and stabilizing the metallacyclobutane intermediate during the [2+2]-cycloaddition step. The results highlight the differences in reactivity between alumina and silica-supported systems, with alumina being an active polymerization catalyst while silica is inactive. This is due to the unique properties of the metal centers and the structure of the supports.

          二氧化硅支持的钽氢催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制包括一系列步骤，包括配合、形成金属环丁烷中间体的[2+2]-环加成、逆反应和解配。金属中心的不对称性在优化配合步骤中的活化能和在[2+2]-环加成步骤中稳定金属环丁烷中间体方面发挥了关键作用。结果强调了氧化铝和二氧化硅支持系统之间反应性的差异，氧化铝是一种高度活跃的聚合催化剂，而二氧化硅完全无活性。这是由于金属中心的独特性质和支撑结构所导致的。

          [1] "Silica surfaces are mainly composed of silanols and siloxane bridges of various types: silanols can be either isolated, vicinal, or geminal, and siloxane bridges are connected to each other to form cyclic structures of different sizes, typically 8- to 12-membered rings."
          [2] "Treatment at higher temperatures further decreases the OH density and leads to the formation of reactive siloxane bridges, and this process is further accompanied by a loss of specific surface area."
          [3] "Overall, this support can be viewed as a large monodentate siloxy ligand (Scheme 1)."
          [4] "The combined use of experimental and computational studies have shown that the high reactivity of this system was due to the asymmetry at the metal center, that is the presence of both a strong and a weaker σ-donor ligands, the neopentyl and the siloxy groups, respectively (Scheme 2b)."
          [5] "It is noteworthy that this system turned out to be a highly reactive alkene metathesis heterogeneous catalyst with the following specific properties..."
          [6] "Additionally, it is noteworthy that, on going from Re to Mo, the initial activity is not improved..."
          [7] "However, despite a much greater stability than this observed for Mo and Re systems, the rate of metathesis is still slow and the overall performances are lower than those of Mo."
          [8] "On alumina, it allows the formation of highly reactive, but stable cationic species or masked carbenic species whose structures are unusual by comparison with molecular chemistry."
          [9] "While this system is a highly active alkene metathesis catalyst, no carbenic species have been detected."
          [10] "They probably correspond to the resting states of the catalyst, and the actual propagating carbene species is formed in situ in the presence of alkenes (Scheme 10b) [62,63]."

          Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the structure and properties of silica surfaces. Silica surfaces consist of silanols and various types of siloxane bridges, which can be isolated, vicinal, or geminal. Higher temperatures decrease the OH density, forming reactive siloxane bridges, and this process reduces the specific surface area. The support can be considered a large monodentate siloxy ligand (Scheme 1). The high reactivity of the system is attributed to the asymmetry at the metal center, featuring a combination of strong and weak σ-donor ligands, neopentyl and siloxy groups, respectively (Scheme 2b). This system exhibits specific properties as a highly reactive alkene metathesis heterogeneous catalyst. Notably, while going from Re to Mo, the initial activity is not improved, but the Mo system offers better selectivity and stability, albeit with slower metathesis rates. On alumina, it facilitates the formation of highly reactive cationic species or masked carbenic species with unusual structures. Despite being a highly active alkene metathesis catalyst, no carbenic species have been detected. These resting states likely correspond to the catalyst's actual propagating carbene species present when alkenes are present (Scheme 10b) [62,63].

          分析二氧化硅支持的钽氢催化烷烃裂合的全面机制涉及理解二氧化硅表面的结构和性质。二氧化硅表面由硅醇和各种类型的硅氧烷桥组成，这些桥接可以是孤立的、邻近的或二元的。高温降低OH密度，形成活性硅氧烷桥接，同时减少特定表面面积。支持可以视为大型单齿硅氧烷配体（方案1）。系统的高活性归因于金属中心的不对称性，其中结合了强和弱的σ供体配体，分别是正戊基和硅氧烷基（方案2b）。这个系统展现出作为高度反应性的烷烃裂合异质催化剂的特定性质。值得注意的是，从Re到Mo，初始活性并未改善，但Mo系统提供了更好的选择性和稳定性，尽管裂合速率较慢。在氧化铝上，它允许形成高度反应性的正离子物种或掩蔽的碳烯物种，其结构与分子化学相比显得不寻常。尽管这是一个高度有效的烷烃裂合催化剂，但没有检测到碳烯物种。这些静止状态很可能对应于当烯烃存在时催化剂的实际上行碳烯物种（方案10b） [62,63]。
