          "[1] 'Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride3 prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC).'"
          "[2] 'This system involves a single metal with dual properties and shows that ancillary ligands are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions.'"
          "[3] 'The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources.'"
          "[4] 'Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion (Table 1 and Figure 1).'"
          "[5] 'Firstly, 2,2-dimethylpropane is probably formed by exchange of the neopentyl by a propyl ligand, either directly through σ-bond metathesis or in two steps through CH activation on the neopentylidene unit followed by a decomposition of the penta-coordinated complex through an α-H abstraction to regenerate an alkylidene alkyl/Mo center (1b, R=Et, R=tBu; Scheme 2).'"
          "[6] 'Secondly, 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpentane are probably obtained through cross-metathesis of the neopentylidene ligand attached to the Mo center and a propene moiety, which results from β-H transfer on the propyl chain in 1b, followed by metathesis and subsequent similar reverse steps (insertion of the olefin into a metal hydride and exchange of the ligand by successive CH activation on the carbene ligand and α-H abstraction).'"
          "[10] 'Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis.'"

          The reaction of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves transforming a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a single metal with dual properties, where ancillary ligands are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions. This mechanism is particularly interesting as it has gained attention over the past few years due to the necessity of more efficient routes to chemicals to optimize oil resources. The turnover frequency is constant for 40 hours, indicating high catalyst performance, and then there is a reproducible decrease in conversion. The formation of 2,2-dimethylpropane involves the exchange of a neopentyl ligand by a propyl ligand through σ-bond metathesis or two steps involving CH activation on the neopentylidene unit followed by a decomposition of the penta-coordinated complex through an α-H abstraction to regenerate an alkylidene alkyl/Mo center. Additionally, 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpentane are obtained through cross-metathesis of the neopentylidene ligand attached to the Mo center and a propene moiety, which results from β-H transfer on the propyl chain in 1b, followed by metathesis and subsequent similar reverse steps.

          二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃裂合反应涉及将给定的烷烃转化为其较低和较高同系物，使用具有双重性质的单一金属，其中辅助配体与烷烃裂合反应兼容。这一机制特别引人关注，因为它在过去几年中获得了关注，原因是为了优化石油资源需要更高效的化学品路线。40小时内的周转频率保持不变，表明催化剂性能很高，然后有规律地减少转化率。2,2-二甲基丙烷的形成涉及通过σ键裂合直接交换或通过两个步骤（涉及在二环戊基二烯单元上的CH激活，随后五配位复合物通过α-H抽象分解以再生烷基二烯/ Mo中心（1b，R=乙基，R=叔丁基；方案2））交换二环戊基配体为正丙基配体。此外，2,2-二甲基丁烷和2,2-二甲基戊烷通过交叉裂合获得，交叉裂合涉及钼中心连接的二环戊基配体与丙烯基团之间的交叉裂合，这发生在1b中的丙基链上的β-H转移后，随后进行裂合并随后类似的逆向步骤（插入烯烃进入金属氢化物和通过连续的CH激活在卡宾配体和α-H抽象中交换配体）。
