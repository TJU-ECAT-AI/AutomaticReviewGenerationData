          Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. The process typically begins with the activation of the alkane substrate by the catalyst, leading to the formation of an alkene intermediate. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in the conversion of both linear and cyclic alkane structures. The role of the catalyst in the metathesis of simple open-chain and cyclic olefins is also discussed, highlighting its versatility in handling different types of substrates. The mechanism of MTO-based catalysts involves complex interactions between the rhenium center and the alkene substrate, including the condensation reaction that increases the Lewis acidity of the rhenium, which facilitates the formation of reactive intermediates essential for the metathesis reaction. Additionally, the literature emphasizes the importance of controlling parameters such as the rhenium/cocatalyst ratio and the alkyl groups on the metal to optimize catalyst activity and selectivity in various alkane conversions.

          "[1] The olefin metathesis is a reaction catalyzed by organo- metallic compounds, and its significance for the synthesis of basic and fine-chemical olefins as well as of polymers (poly- alkenamers) is steadily increasing."
          "[2] Variants, including both homogeneous and heterogenous catalysis, are presently used in eight technical p r o c e s  e s , [ but the metathesis of functionalized olefins still presents problems (e.g., high cata- lyst concentrations, catalyst poisoning)."

          Olefin metathesis, a reaction catalyzed by organometallic compounds, plays an increasingly important role in the synthesis of basic and fine-chemical olefins and polymers (polyalkenamers). Despite the use of various catalytic methods, including homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, in eight industrial processes, the metathesis of functionalized olefins remains challenging due to issues such as high catalyst concentrations and catalyst poisoning. Our recent discovery demonstrates that MTO (la) and its higher homologues, when supported on acidic metal oxides, form effective metathesis catalysts capable of operating without additives, even for functionalized olefins. Catalyst I, in particular, functions at room temperature and is suitable for the metathesis of simple open-chain and cyclic olefins. The efficiency of catalyst I surpasses that of ReO3, which requires the use of organotin compounds for the metathesis of functionalized olefins. This finding highlights the potential of MTO-based catalysts in overcoming the limitations encountered in the metathesis of functionalized olefins.

          烯烃裂合，由有机金属化合物催化的反应，在基本和精细化学品烯烃及聚合物（聚烯烷胺）的合成中扮演着越来越重要的角色。尽管在八个工业过程中使用了包括均相和异相催化在内的各种催化方法，但对于功能化烯烃的裂合仍存在挑战，主要问题包括催化剂浓度高和催化剂中毒。我们最近的发现表明，当MTO（la）及其同系物支持在酸性金属氧化物上时，它们能形成有效的裂合催化剂，即使对于功能化烯烃也能在无添加剂的情况下运行。特别是催化剂I在室温下工作，适用于简单开链和环状烯烃的裂合。催化剂I的效率超过了仅在存在有机锡化合物时才能对功能化烯烃进行裂合的ReO3。这一发现突显了MTO基催化剂在克服功能化烯烃裂合遇到的限制方面的潜力。
