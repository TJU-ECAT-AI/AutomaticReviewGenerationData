          [1] "Olefin metathesis has become a key reaction for basic and fine chemical synthesis."
          [2] "Despite years of research and tremendous advances in this field, it is still difficult to control the stereochemical outcome of this reaction, which leads to mixture of (E) and (Z)isomers."
          [3] "Some homogeneous catalysts, however, are highly stereoselective and can maintain this high stereoselectivity at high conversions."
          [4] "To observe the kinetic product ratio, it is necessary to use very high flow rates and to work at very low conversions9,10 because the strong adsorption of olefins on alumina favors secondary isomerization (degenerate metathesis)."
          [5] "Grafting (CH3)ReO3 onto an alumina12 whose surface has been previously modified with trimethylsilyl fragments (Scheme2) leads to an improved activity as well as a (Z)-selective catalyst for the metathesis of propene."

          The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes, with processes involving linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in determining reaction selectivity and catalyst performance across various alkane conversions. By modifying the alumina surface with trimethylsilyl groups, the adsorption properties are altered, favoring desorption and disfavoring secondary reactions, leading to improved stereoselectivity and activity for propene metathesis, particularly for (Z)-2-butene.

          硅基Ta氢化物催化烷烃裂合的机制包括双中心和单中心方案，涉及线性和环状烷烃的转化过程。关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，在各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能中起着至关重要的作用。通过在氧化铝表面引入三甲基硅基团，改变了吸附性质，有利于脱附并抑制二级反应，导致丙烯裂解选择性和活性的提高，特别是对于(Z)-2-丁烯。
