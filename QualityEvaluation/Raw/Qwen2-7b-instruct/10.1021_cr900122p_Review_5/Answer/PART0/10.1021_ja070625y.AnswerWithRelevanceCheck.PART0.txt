          The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves considering two main schemes: the two-site and one-site mechanisms. In the two-site mechanism, the catalyst facilitates the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes through a series of steps. In contrast, the one-site mechanism involves a single step where the alkane structure rearranges. Linear alkane transformations tend to be more efficient due to their simpler structure. However, cyclic alkane transformations often necessitate more complex catalysts and conditions. Key intermediates in the process are alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which significantly impact the reaction pathway. The selectivity and performance of the catalysts in various alkane conversions are determined by factors such as metal type and ligand choice.

          由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的全面机制涉及考虑两种主要方案：双位点和单位点机制。在双位点机制中，催化剂通过一系列步骤促进烯烃和金属环丁烷等中间体的形成。相反，单位点机制涉及单一步骤，通过重组烷烃结构进行转化。线性烷烃转化通常更为有效，因为其结构较为简单。然而，环状烷烃转化往往需要更复杂的催化剂和条件。中间产物包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，在反应途径中起着关键作用。催化剂在各种烷烃转换中的选择性和性能受到金属类型和配体选择等因素的影响。
