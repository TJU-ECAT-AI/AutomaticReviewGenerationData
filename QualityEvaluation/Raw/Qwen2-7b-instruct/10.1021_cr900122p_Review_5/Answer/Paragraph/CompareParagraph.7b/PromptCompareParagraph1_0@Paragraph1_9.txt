Comprehensive mechanistic investigation of alkane metathesis processes catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides: From linear to cyclic alkanes and the role of reaction intermediates, with insights into the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes) and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The study reveals that silica-supported tantalum hydrides enable efficient alkane metathesis through both two-site and one-site schemes, facilitating transformations of linear and cyclic alkanes into higher and lower homologues. The processes involve the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, acting as critical intermediates that significantly influence the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions. 

            
            Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of more selective catalysts for alkane metathesis, possibly by modifying the support materials or adjusting the catalyst composition to optimize the formation of specific intermediates. Additionally, there is potential for expanding the scope of alkane conversions to include a wider range of substrates, with a particular emphasis on the efficient production of branched alkanes and the optimization of reaction conditions for enhanced performance. The exploration of novel catalyst designs and the integration of computational approaches to predict and guide experimental outcomes could also pave the way for more sustainable and efficient alkane conversion processes.

Scheme 25. Hydrogenolysis of Alkane on [Ta−H]: (a) Hydrogenolysis of Propane and Final Product Distribution. (b) Proposed Elementary Mono-hydride Active Sites vs (c) Tris-hydride Active Sites (R = CH3 for Propane)
Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers. (238) Here cyclic alkanes yield lower cyclic homologues: conversion of cyclohexane into methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, and that of cycloheptane into methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane. It has been proposed that the key step probably involved, after the formation of the cycloalkyl derivatives via C−H bond activation, a γ-H activation (Scheme 26). This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, e.g. hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues. The low activity of the catalyst is probably due to the formation of cyclopentane, detected in all cases, which upon C−H bond activation evolved toward cyclopentadienyl surface species (vide supra, section ).
Scheme 26
Scheme 26. Proposed Mechanism for the Catalytic Hydrogenolysis of Cyclic Alkanes with Silica Supported Tantalum Hydrides: (A) Initial C−H Bond Activation and C−C Bond Cleavage and (B) Formation of Products
Alkane Metathesis
In 1997, Vidal et al. found that acyclic alkanes (CnH2n+2) are catalytically transformed into their lower and higher homologues (Cn−iH2(n−i)+2 and Cn+iH2(n+i)+2) in the absence of hydrogen by the silica supported tantalum hydrides (Scheme 27a−b). (297, 298) Detailed mechanistic studies using different types of Ta-based catalyst precursors (251, 252) and kinetic studies in flow reactors (299) showed that alkenes were primary products and that the key C−C bond cleavage and formation steps corresponded to those involved in alkene metathesis, i.e. [2 + 2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion (vide supra). (300-303) Several mechanistic schemes are possible, involving either two sites or one site, and they involve well-known steps of molecular organometallic chemistry.

(a) General Equation for the Reaction of Alkane Metathesis; (b) Major Products in Alkane Metathesis; (c) Proposed Two-Site Mechanism for the Catalytic Metathesis of Alkanes (Only One of the Two Possible Metallacyclobutanes Is Represented); (d) Selected Catalyst Precursors (See Table 4 for Details)
First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first C−H bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer. (304) The alkene, generated by the first site, then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, which leads to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps provide a way to liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues. The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n − 1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process, (252, 298, 299) in contrast to the catalytic alkane metathesis processes based on mixtures of alkene metathesis and dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts, where a broad distribution of lower and higher homologues are generated, as a result of the cross-metathesis of a broad range of alkene intermediates and, in particular, internal ones. (298, 305-309)
Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28). (251, 252) In this case, the formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center, as shown previously for the formation of cross-metathesis products, resulting from the reaction of an alkane and a neopentyl neopentylidene surface complex (Scheme 19, R1 = R2 = CH2R).
Scheme 28
Scheme 28. Formation of Alkyl Alkylidene Intermediates from Tantalum Hydrides
Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate. Today, several catalysts have been developed on the basis of well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes (Table 4 and Scheme 27d):
Tantalum hydrides prepared on various oxide supports: silica−alumina, alumina, and tailored made supports (entries 1−4), (262, 310) but they display similar activities and selectivities with the original silica supported tantalum hydrides.
Tungsten hydrides supported on oxide supports (entries 5−7); (260-262) while the silica supported system is a poor catalyst because of the lack of stability of the tungsten hydrides, the silica−alumina and alumina supported tungsten hydrides are more stable and selective than the corresponding tantalum hydrides.
Well-defined silica supported metal alkyl alkylidene catalyst precursors; those based on Ta display similar selectivity to that of the parent tantalum hydrides but are slightly less productive (entries 8−10); (251, 252) those based on Mo imido complexes have similar activity to that of the parent silica supported tantalum hydrides but higher selectivities (entry 11). (253, 254) In the latter type of catalysts, it was clearly shown that both the alkylidene and the alkyl ligands were necessary to obtain catalytic activity in alkane metathesis, because the corresponding alkylidene amido complexes are inactive despite their much higher performances as alkene metathesis catalyst precursors (entry 12). (311, 312) Note that Re alkyl alkylidene complexes are also active (entry 13), (254) but with much lower performances, probably because of their higher instability. (281) Overall, detailed investigations on these types of catalysts are consistent with a one-site mechanism and show that deactivation of these systems is probably due to degrafting (vide infra, Section 3.1.3), (254) preventing regeneration under H2 as performed on the hydride based catalysts.
Well-defined alkyl alkylidyne surface complexes of W, which are highly active alkene metathesis catalysts, (278, 313, 314) can also be used as alkane metathesis catalyst precursors (entries 14−16). While the silica supported system is inactive, probably because of a fast decomposition, the silica−alumina and alumina supported systems display activities comparable to those of the corresponding tantalum alkyl alkylidene systems (entries 8−10) and a greater selectivity for n − 1 and n + 1 homologues (entries 6−7). Overall, the current best reported catalysts are based on alumina or silica−alumina supported tungsten hydrides.
Alkane metathesis can also be used to make highly branched alkanes. For instance, the alumina supported tungsten hydrides convert selectively and catalytically 2-methylpropane into 2,3-dimethylbutane (42%) and ethane (41%) (Scheme 29a). (315) Despite the transfer of two carbons in place of one, as usually observed previously, this selectively can be explained using the same mechanism and the same alkylidene hydride intermediates (Scheme 29b). Finally, it is also possible to carry out alkane cross-metathesis processes. For instance, ethane/toluene mixtures are catalytically converted into a mixture of ethylbenzene and xylenes by the silica supported tantalum hydride (Scheme 29c). (316) This shows that both Csp3 and Csp2 can be involved in the alkane metathesis process. Note that Csp2 functionalization probably involves a different type of mechanism; one possibility is the Csp2-H activation on alkylidene or alkylidyne intermediates followed by an α-alkyl migration and subsequent C−H bond activation and hydrogenolysis steps to form higher alkane homologues and regenerate the active species (vide infra, Section and Scheme 31c).

Moreover, while silica or silica−alumina supported zirconium hydrides or alkyl do not display any catalytic activity in alkane metathesis under standard conditions (150 °C and ca. 1 bar), they catalytically convert propane into higher and lower homologues under supercritical conditions (Table 4, entries 17−18). (317) However, the product selectivity and distribution are very different from catalysts based on group 5 and 6 metals: formation of mainly branched products up to decanes with a relatively high selectivity in isobutane along with methane and ethane. Here it is proposed that propane homologation takes place on a bis-hydride surface species and involves the following elementary steps (Scheme 30): (1) formation of a bis-alkyl intermediate [Zr(n-Pr)2] via two σ-bond metathesis steps, (2) an homologation process yielding [Zr(C2H5)(i-Bu)] via successive β-alkyl transfer intramolecular H-transfer and insertion, and (3) regeneration of Zr(H)2 and formation of ethane and isobutane via hydrogenolysis (σ-bond metathesis of M-C by H2).

Scheme 30. Proposed Mechanism for the Catalytic Homologation of Alkanes by Oxide Supported Zirconium Hydrides
Catalytic Conversion of Methane
Alkane metathesis converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues, and in particular two ethane molecules into methane and propane. The reverse reaction implies a cross-metathesis reaction with methane and its incorporation into higher alkanes, e.g. methane and propane giving two ethane molecules. This reaction is slightly endothermic independently of temperature (ca. 10 kJ/mol), but using a large excess of methane, propane was catalytically and quantitatively converted into ethane (2 ethane molecules per converted propane) using the silica supported tantalum hydrides, probably via the same elementary steps of alkane metathesis (Scheme 31a). (318)

Scheme 31. Catalytic Conversions of Methane via (a) Cross-metathesis with Propane, (b) Nonoxidative Coupling, (c) C−C Bond Formation in Nonoxidative Coupling of Methane, and (d) Nonoxidative Coupling of Methane and Benzene
With the same tantalum hydride catalyst, but in the absence of other alkanes, methane can also be catalytically converted into an equimolar mixture of ethane and H2, which corresponds to the reaction of nonoxidative coupling (Scheme 31b). (206) This reaction is however highly endothermic and leads to very low conversions (ca. 0.1 and 0.2 at 300 and 375 °C, respectively). A possible mechanism involved the C−H bond activation of methane (R = CH3 in Scheme 31c) on metal−methylidene or methylidyne intermediates; (263-265) this generates an alkyl alkylidene species, which can rearrange via α-alkyl transfer into a Ta-CH2R. The catalytic cycle is then close upon reaction with methane, which liberates RCH3 and regenerates Ta-CH3. In the presence of benzene, coupling also takes place but leads to the selective formation of toluene and H2 (Scheme 31d), and the mechanism can take place similarly to methane replacing R = CH3 by R = Ph in the catalytic cycle. (319)
Conclusion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
C−H bond activation of alkanes readily takes place on isolated metal centers bound to, or present on, oxide surfaces to form organometallic intermediates, and this corresponds to the key steps of numerous catalytic processes: H/D-exchange reactions, alkane hydrogenolysis and metathesis, alkane dehydrogenation, conversion of alkane into aromatics, as well as the cross-metathesis of methane and alkanes or nonoxidative coupling of methane.
First, C−H bond activation and the formation of M−alkyl species occur on M−O, M−H, and M−C bonds via σ-bond metathesis and on M−alkylidene and M−alkylidyne bonds via addition reactions, an elementary step whose transition state resembles that of a σ-bond metathesis. In contrast to molecular organometallic chemistry, C−H bond activation via oxidative addition is only rarely encountered for these systems, with one reason being that metal centers belong to main group and early transition metals, usually in their higher oxidation states. Systems based on late transition metals, e.g. group VIII, are mainly found as particles, which were not discussed here.
Second, intramolecular C−H bond activation is also important in many catalytic processes. First, it is one of the processes which allows the formation of surface alkylidene and alkylidyne intermediates via α-H abstraction on bis-alkyl or alkyl−alkylidene species, respectively. Second, related elementary steps such as β-H abstraction and β-H transfer are also important in deactivation (degrafting) and chain transfer (alkane homologation) processes, respectively. Finally, a specific case is β-H transfer, which is the key step of (i) a chain walking mechanism, an important reaction in hydrogenation, polymerization, alkane hydrogenolysis, and possibly alkane metathesis, and (ii) deactivation mechanisms of alkene and alkane metathesis catalysts. Additionally, one should note that, in contrast to molecular organometallic chemistry, C−C bond activation is often encountered in surface chemistry, including in catalytic processes (alkane hydrogenolysis and metathesis), and this is probably due to the possibility to explore the reactivity of these surface species at higher temperatures than those for the homologous molecular complexes because surfaces and, in particular, site isolation allow the access to highly reactive&mdash;yet stable&mdash;intermediates. (320) Nonetheless, these C−C bond activation processes take place via known elementary steps of molecular organometallic chemistry (and related to those of C−H bond activation), i.e. mainly via α- and β-alkyl transfer processes, with the corresponding reverse elementary steps allowing the formation of C−C bonds and chain growth. No intermolecular C−C bond activation has been observed so far on these systems. This again shows the difference between isolated sites in high oxidation states and metal ensembles present at the surface of metal particles.
Third, it is also noteworthy that the surface chemistry and particularly C−H bond activation processes are very similar for bulk oxides and M-exchange zeolites, and this is probably an evidence for common structural features of active sites for these systems. For instance, it is possible that the structures of the defect sites in oxides are closely related to those of the active site Al and M sites of H-zeolites and M-exchange zeolites, respectively. Given the diversity of zeolite structures, it should be possible to control the nature, the density, and the accessibility of those active sites and thereby to obtain single-site catalysts. Moreover, the C−H bond activation of alkanes on the reactive sites of oxides and zeolites, which are based on main group or group 10 metals (Al, Ga, and Zn), corresponds to a σ-bond metathesis, like for single-site catalysts based on early transition metals. The analogy between the reactivity of single-site catalysts, isolated ions in metal oxides and M-exchange zeolites, shows that research effort should also be directed in bridging the gap between these systems, for instance by designing well-defined active sites bound to or incorporated in the structure of zeolites as a way to generate robust single-site catalysts. (321-324)
In contrast, under oxidative conditions (molecular oxygen or N2O), the C−H bond activation processes are more complex; they typically involve a H-abstraction and radical-type mechanism. In fact, in some cases when high operating temperatures are used (above 500 °C), the uncatalyzed and unselective gas phase reactions can become dominant. Therefore, metal-alkyl species are often not key reaction intermediates, even if they can be detected in some cases, probably as dormant species. Yet, such radical processes can lead to highly selective transformation in specific cases, such as the oxidation of butane into maleic anhydride. However, such cases are limited to specific substrates, and these reactions lead to otherwise low yields (low selectivity at high conversions or high selectivity at low conversion).
Overall, the level of molecular understanding of “single-site” heterogeneous catalysts in terms of structure of the active sites and reaction mechanism is close to that obtained for homogeneous systems. The detailed description of these systems has in turn been used to develop rational approaches to improve catalysts (design) and to also discover novel alkane (including methane) homologation processes. There are however open questions regarding the so-called “single-site” catalysts: what is the effect of adjacent oxygen functionalities on structure and reactivity (local environment; are they truly “single-site”?), what is the stability of these systems (deactivation, regeneration, ...), can they be used in more complex reactions involving for instance molecular oxygen (vide infra)?
In contrast, obtaining a detailed mechanistic understanding for the activation of alkanes on metal oxides or zeolites has been difficult and still requires a large research effort, despite many recent advances. This is due in large part to the difficulty to attain a molecular understanding of the active sites. One approach to bridge the gap between “single-site” catalysts and these systems is to improve characterization techniques, (325-333) in particular by combining advanced spectroscopic and computational studies. This requires looking at the pristine material as well as the material under working conditions (operando techniques). The thus-obtained detailed understanding of active site structures can in turn assist with design of new materials, in particular highly crystalline materials with defined chemical structures, with a control of the density of so-called “defect sites”, with a defined location of sites inside the oxide matrices.... (334-337) In the case of oxidative reaction processes, extra difficulties can be pointed out: very complex reaction mechanisms involving multielectron oxidation processes and molecular oxygen as well as radical or radical-like intermediates, oxide-based catalysts involving complex compositions and active site structures.... Here, despite years of research and promising industrial processes, a better molecular understanding of active sites and reaction mechanisms is probably critical to expect major advances in catalyst design. Major breakthroughs could originate from a deeper understanding of C&mdash;H bond activation processes on M═O or M&mdash;O active sites with the aim to trigger C&mdash;H bond as well as O2 activation at lower temperatures on metal oxides or supported metal oxides. This would assist with the design of more selective metal-based catalysts and avoid the unselective gas phase reaction processes. This also calls for a better control of the formation of active species on oxide surfaces, and one possible approach is the controlled reaction of well-defined oxide precursors including polyoxometallates. (338-340)
This review also shows that the isolated metal centers of surfaces can display unusual reactivities when compared to molecular organometallic chemistry, even if they actually obey the same rules (elementary steps)! Their reactivity is by and large due to site isolation on surfaces, which can help stabilize reactive intermediates and which allow unusual structures, e.g. low coordination, as well as the use of higher temperatures. Looking more closely at these systems can probably provide new ideas in molecular chemistry in a similar way as Nature has inspired us to design homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. (341-343)
