    "Summary": "Both reviews excel in most categories, with comparable scores and contributions. They are equally strong in comprehensiveness, accuracy, relevance, innovation, and contribution to the field. However, they both lack clarity in methodology description and rigor, which is a common issue in this type of research. Both articles also demonstrate reasonable fluency in language expression and appropriate use of professional terminology. Their practical application potential and feasibility of proposed suggestions are commendable. Overall, the two reviews are of high quality, but no single review outperforms the other."
