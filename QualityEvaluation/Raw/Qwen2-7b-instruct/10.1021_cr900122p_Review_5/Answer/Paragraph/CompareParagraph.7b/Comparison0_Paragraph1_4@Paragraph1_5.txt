They demonstrate a clear logical structure, reasonable chapter arrangement, and effective introduction and conclusion. However, they lack depth in argumentation, interdisciplinary integration, and citation of the latest research, as well as concise expression and critical thinking. Both articles have similar scores across all categories, indicating a comparable level of quality."
