Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/ja068249], synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/om800877q] and [10.1002/anie.200604158]. Comprehensive mechanistic investigation of alkane metathesis processes catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides: From linear to cyclic alkanes and the role of reaction intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, in determining reaction selectivity and catalyst performance, has been thoroughly explored.

            The detailed mechanism of the metathesis process involves the activation of the alkene by the catalyst, followed by a concerted rearrangement leading to the formation of the product alkene. In the case of linear alkane transformations, the catalyst facilitates the cleavage of the alkane backbone, allowing for the recombination of the resulting fragments into a new alkene. For cyclic alkane transformations, the catalyst promotes the opening of the ring structure, leading to the formation of an alkene, which can then undergo further reactions to yield the desired product. Key intermediates in the process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the catalytic cycle. Catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as the choice of support material, the nature of the metal center, and the ligand environment.

            The evaluation of molybdenum and tungsten metathesis catalysts for homogeneous tandem alkane metathesis, as discussed in reference [10.1021/om800877q], reveals the significance of two-site and one-site schemes for converting both linear and cyclic alkanes. Insights from quotes highlight the importance of these intermediates and schemes in achieving efficient alkane transformations. This study emphasizes the unique catalytic properties of tantalum, including its ability to activate CH bonds, carry out hydrogenolysis, and polymerize olefins, contributing significantly to the reaction's selectivity and catalyst performance.

            In another study [10.1002/anie.200604158], the mechanism of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of cyclohexanone with 2-butanol catalyzed by Sn-beta and Zr-beta zeolites has been theoretically investigated using density functional theory (DFT) and the cluster approach. The computational study indicates that the mechanism of Sn-beta and Zr-beta catalysis is similar, involving adsorption of both the ketone and the alcohol on the Lewis acid center, deprotonation of the alcohol, carbon-to-carbon hydride transfer, proton transfer from the catalyst, and products exchange. This study underscores the equivalence in the catalytic behavior of silica-supported tantalum hydrides, revealing the role of hydrolyzed SnOH or ZrOH groups as Lewis acids in enabling adsorption and deprotonation.

            The study [10.1021/ja051679f] on the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides further elucidates the involvement of both two-site and one-site schemes in linear to cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, are formed during the reaction, contributing significantly to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds by silica-supported zirconium hydrides demonstrates selectivity for primary over secondary C-H bonds, as evidenced by stoichiometric and catalytic experiments. This selectivity is crucial for efficient alkane conversions, highlighting the role of these catalysts in facilitating the transformation of various alkanes.

            The research [10.1002/adsc.200600436] on silica-alumina-supported tungsten-based heterogeneous alkane metathesis catalysts explores the properties of this system, focusing on its dual nature between silica- and alumina-supported systems. The catalyst combines the advantages of both silica and alumina supports, allowing for a versatile approach to alkane metathesis. The study delves into the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalysis, emphasizing the role of intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes in enhancing reaction selectivity and catalyst performance.

            In summary, the comprehensive mechanistic investigation of alkane metathesis processes catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides has provided significant insights into the conversion of linear and cyclic alkanes. The formation and role of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, in determining reaction selectivity and catalyst performance have been thoroughly explored.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/ja051679f\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1002/anie.200604158\] and \[10.1002/anie.200704876\]. Comprehensive mechanistic investigation of alkane metathesis processes catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. Key steps include adsorption, deprotonation forming an alkene, hydride transfer, and product exchange. Catalyst performance and selectivity depend on factors like preparation, alkane type, and conditions. The mechanism is similar across different catalyst types, with hydrolyzed SnOH or ZrOH groups providing necessary acidic sites. This facilitates the reaction's efficiency and product distribution.

            The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides employs two-site and one-site schemes for linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, significantly impact reaction selectivity and catalyst efficiency. Surface modification of alumina with trimethylsilyl groups enhances stereoselectivity and activity for propene metathesis, particularly for (Z)-2-butene production, demonstrating the pivotal role of intermediates in controlling the stereochemical outcome.

            Under supercritical conditions and at moderate temperatures, propane is transformed into higher-branched homologues in the presence of a zirconiumdihydride catalyst supported on an oxide material such as silica. Products are formed by a reaction similar to ZieglerNatta olefin polymerization. Alkanes, including ethane, are transformed into their lower homologues in the presence of a catalytic amount of silica-supported tantalum hydride. Cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond is different for both catalysts (Group4 vs. Group5): β-alkyl transfer for d0zirconium catalysts versus α-alkyl transfer for d2tantalum catalysts so that hydrogenolysis of a CC bond in the skeleton of an alkane occurs by removal of one carbon atom at a time for tantalum catalysts and of at least two carbon atoms for zirconium catalysts, hence the difference in the selectivity of the final product.

            The product selectivities in alkane metathesis are associated with the formation of the products by the carbene-olefin mechanism of Chauvin and Hrisson, which explains the high selectivity for Cn+1 homologues (1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes are formed more readily than 1,2-disubstituted ones) and the low selectivity towards branched alkanes (highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes).

            According to the mechanism depicted in Scheme2, ethene and propene can be readily formed through primary processes, β-H and β-Me transfer, respectively, on the Zrpropyl propagating species. On starting with a well-defined supported Zr dineopentyl species, the homologation of propane at 216C gives the same reaction products with slightly different selectivities: methane (30.5%); ethane (42.3%); isobutane (12.7%); butane (5.7%), which confirms the proposed dialkyl/hydride active sites.

            The main advances in the title area are reviewed with emphasis on catalytic alkane functionalization, both organometallic and bioinorganic. Current challenges are discussed. A tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization is still out of reach and resolving mechanistic problems has proved particularly challenging.

            The special catalyst activity of MTO is lost when the methyl groups are cleaved. Use of CD,ReO, (>99% D) confirmed the participation of metal-coordinated CD, groups in olefin metathesis (formation of CD,=CHC,H, and CD,=CH, from l-butene). MTO loses maximally 5% of the organic groups as methane and ethylene on the preparation of catalyst I. Free MTO cannot be separated from the carrier even under high vacuum at temperatures up to 150C. The condensation reaction increases the Lewis acidity of the rhenium, as is shown by solid state IR spectroscopy (diffuse reflectance). Perrhenate bonded to the surface has been detected for the system Re,O,/AI,O,

            The evaluation of the carbene hydride mechanism in the carbon-carbon bond formation process of alkane metathesis through a DFT study was conducted. The catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by the reaction selectivity, which is determined by the mechanisms involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play a crucial role in the reaction pathways.

            Anne-Marie Leduc et al.'s study emphasizes the β-H transfer from the metallacyclobutane as a pivotal step in deactivation and byproduct formation, highlighting its role in well-defined catalysts. The catalyst's performance in alkane conversions is significantly influenced by the mechanisms of linear and cyclic transformations, with reaction intermediates playing a central role in determining selectivity.

            Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride3 prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC). This system involves a single metal with dual properties and shows that ancillary ligands are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions. The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources. Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion (Table 1 and Figure 1).
