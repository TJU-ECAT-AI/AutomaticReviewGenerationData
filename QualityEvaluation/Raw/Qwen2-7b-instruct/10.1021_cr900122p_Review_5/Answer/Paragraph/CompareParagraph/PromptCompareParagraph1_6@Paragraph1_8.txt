Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/ja051679f\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1002/anie.200604158\] and \[10.1002/anie.200704876\]. Comprehensive mechanistic investigation of alkane metathesis processes catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. Key steps include adsorption, deprotonation forming an alkene, hydride transfer, and product exchange. Catalyst performance and selectivity depend on factors like preparation, alkane type, and conditions. The mechanism is similar across different catalyst types, with hydrolyzed SnOH or ZrOH groups providing necessary acidic sites. This facilitates the reaction's efficiency and product distribution.

            The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides employs two-site and one-site schemes for linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, significantly impact reaction selectivity and catalyst efficiency. Surface modification of alumina with trimethylsilyl groups enhances stereoselectivity and activity for propene metathesis, particularly for (Z)-2-butene production, demonstrating the pivotal role of intermediates in controlling the stereochemical outcome.

            Under supercritical conditions and at moderate temperatures, propane is transformed into higher-branched homologues in the presence of a zirconiumdihydride catalyst supported on an oxide material such as silica. Products are formed by a reaction similar to ZieglerNatta olefin polymerization. Alkanes, including ethane, are transformed into their lower homologues in the presence of a catalytic amount of silica-supported tantalum hydride. Cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond is different for both catalysts (Group4 vs. Group5): β-alkyl transfer for d0zirconium catalysts versus α-alkyl transfer for d2tantalum catalysts so that hydrogenolysis of a CC bond in the skeleton of an alkane occurs by removal of one carbon atom at a time for tantalum catalysts and of at least two carbon atoms for zirconium catalysts, hence the difference in the selectivity of the final product.

            The product selectivities in alkane metathesis are associated with the formation of the products by the carbene-olefin mechanism of Chauvin and Hrisson, which explains the high selectivity for Cn+1 homologues (1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes are formed more readily than 1,2-disubstituted ones) and the low selectivity towards branched alkanes (highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes).

            According to the mechanism depicted in Scheme2, ethene and propene can be readily formed through primary processes, β-H and β-Me transfer, respectively, on the Zrpropyl propagating species. On starting with a well-defined supported Zr dineopentyl species, the homologation of propane at 216C gives the same reaction products with slightly different selectivities: methane (30.5%); ethane (42.3%); isobutane (12.7%); butane (5.7%), which confirms the proposed dialkyl/hydride active sites.

            The main advances in the title area are reviewed with emphasis on catalytic alkane functionalization, both organometallic and bioinorganic. Current challenges are discussed. A tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization is still out of reach and resolving mechanistic problems has proved particularly challenging.

            The silica-supported tantalum hydrides catalyze alkane metathesis through two-site and one-site schemes, facilitating transformations of both linear and cyclic alkanes. Key intermediates, alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles. Catalyst performance, influenced by factors such as support material, metal center, and ligand environment, ensures high activity, stability, and selectivity in various alkane conversions, as evidenced by quotes highlighting the catalysts' exceptional properties.

            The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. This study focuses on both two-site and one-site schemes, detailing the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations.

The formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes significantly contributes to the catalyst's performance and selectivity in various alkane conversions.

            The special catalyst activity of MTO is lost when the methyl groups are cleaved. Use of CD,ReO, (>99% D) confirmed the participation of metal-coordinated CD, groups in olefin metathesis (formation of CD,=CHC,H, and CD,=CH, from l-butene). MTO loses maximally 5% of the organic groups as methane and ethylene on the preparation of catalyst I. Free MTO cannot be separated from the carrier even under high vacuum at temperatures up to 150C. The condensation reaction increases the Lewis acidity of the rhenium, as is shown by solid state IR spectroscopy (diffuse reflectance). Perrhenate bonded to the surface has been detected for the system Re,O,/AI,O,

            The evaluation of the carbene hydride mechanism in the carbon-carbon bond formation process of alkane metathesis through a DFT study was conducted. The catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by the reaction selectivity, which is determined by the mechanisms involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play a crucial role in the reaction pathways.

            Anne-Marie Leduc et al.'s study emphasizes the β-H transfer from the metallacyclobutane as a pivotal step in deactivation and byproduct formation, highlighting its role in well-defined catalysts. The catalyst's performance in alkane conversions is significantly influenced by the mechanisms of linear and cyclic transformations, with reaction intermediates playing a central role in determining selectivity.

            Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride3 prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC). This system involves a single metal with dual properties and shows that ancillary ligands are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions. The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources. Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion (Table 1 and Figure 1).
