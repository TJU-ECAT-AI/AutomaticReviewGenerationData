The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes, facilitating transformations from linear to cyclic alkanes through the formation of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These intermediates play crucial roles in the catalytic cycle, significantly impacting reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The mechanism is akin to that found for re-based olefin metathesis catalysts, emphasizing the importance of X and Y ligands for efficient active sites. The detailed mechanism includes alkene activation, followed by a concerted rearrangement leading to the formation of the product alkene, with linear alkane transformations involving backbone cleavage and recombination into new alkenes, and cyclic alkane transformations leading to alkene formation through ring-opening. Catalyst performance is influenced by factors such as the choice of support material, the nature of the metal center, and the ligand environment, as evidenced by the high activity, stability, and selectivity demonstrated in the references.
