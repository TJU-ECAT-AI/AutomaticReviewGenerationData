[2] "The results of the XAFS experiments on Sn-β zeolite samples show that the catalyst has a uniform distribution of active sites."
[3] "These sites are characterized by a high density of tin atoms, which are responsible for the catalytic activity."
[4] "The uniformity of the active sites ensures consistent performance across the catalyst surface."
[5] "In alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, the mechanism involves both two-site and one-site schemes."
[6] "The two-site scheme refers to the interaction of two different molecules or regions of the catalyst."
[7] "On the other hand, the one-site scheme involves a single molecule or region interacting with the catalyst."
[8] "Linear alkane transformations typically involve the rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds to form new alkanes."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. Linear alkane transformations involve the rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds, leading to the formation of new alkanes. Cyclic alkane transformations result in the creation of cyclic hydrocarbons. Key intermediates in these reactions include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Alkenes are formed during the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds, while metallacyclobutanes play a crucial role in stabilizing cyclic structures. The formation and role of these intermediates significantly influence the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions.
