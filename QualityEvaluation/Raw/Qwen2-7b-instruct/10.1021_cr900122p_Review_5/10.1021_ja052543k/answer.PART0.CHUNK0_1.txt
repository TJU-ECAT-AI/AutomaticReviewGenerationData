The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play significant roles in both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The processes are facilitated through two-site and one-site schemes, contributing to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The uniform catalytic sites on the Sn-β zeolite ensure consistent performance and selectivity, while the efficiency of the conversion of these intermediates drives the catalyst's effectiveness.
