[1] "Zeolites with their pores and cavities can introduce steric effects, while metal atoms incorporated into the framework may, in some cases, be stable toward leach- ing."
[2] "For instance, in the case of the hydroxylation of phenol the shape selective properties of the structure are desirable when hydroquinone is the most desired product: Phenol → H2O2 → TS-1 → Hydroquinone + Pirocatechol."
[3] "Let us now show how a redox zeolite can be designed to give the same products as an enzyme. Linalool is oxidized by an epoxidase enzyme to give furans and pyrans with high selectivities:"

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

Answer: The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, the catalyst facilitates the exchange of alkyl groups between two alkane molecules, leading to the formation of two new alkane molecules. The one-site mechanism involves the breaking and reformation of carbon-carbon bonds within a single alkane molecule, resulting in the creation of an alkene intermediate. Key intermediates in this process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the rearrangement of alkyl groups. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the stability of the catalyst, the efficiency of alkene formation, and the ability to control the orientation and position of the alkyl groups during the metathesis reaction.

[1] "Zeolites are crystalline silicates and aluminosilicates linked through oxygen atoms, producing a three-dimensional network containing channels and cavities of molecular dimensions."
[2] "The presence of strong electric fields and controllable adsorption properties within the pores will produce a unique type of catalyst,which by itself can be considered as a catalytic microreactor."
[3] "This effect is based on zeolite shape selectivity by mass transport discrimination, when the diffusion coefficients for branched and linear hydrocarbons within the pores are at least one order of magnitude different."
[4] "It is clear that the process could be simplified if a selective catalytic dialkylation of naphthalene by methanol or propylene could be carried out."
[5] "For these two zeolites selectivities to 2-AMN were 64 and 70% for conversion levels of 40 and 68% respectively, which are still far from optimum."
[6] "This effect was determined by theoretical calculations made with a molecule of ethylene confined into a microscopic cavity."
[7] "Distortion is reflected in the bathochromic shift of the 00 transition,the shortening of the fluorescent lifetimes, the observation of vibronic couplings, the appearance of room-temperature phosphorescence, and the shift of the Raman peaks to lower vibration energy due to the weakening of the naphthalene bonds."

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit both two-site and one-site schemes for alkane metathesis. In the two-site mechanism, a linear alkane undergoes a concerted rearrangement, breaking one C-C bond and forming a new one, leading to the formation of two alkenes. This process is facilitated by the strong electron-withdrawing properties of tantalum, which promotes the breaking of the C-C bond. The role of the silica support is to stabilize the active tantalum centers and prevent them from clustering, which could lead to decreased activity and selectivity. 

In the one-site mechanism, the alkane undergoes a concerted rearrangement, but the new C-C bond is formed within the same alkene, leading to the formation of a cyclic alkene. This process is facilitated by the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which then undergoes a concerted rearrangement to form the cyclic alkene. The formation of the metallacyclobutane intermediate is a key step in this mechanism, and its stability is influenced by the coordination of the tantalum center and the nature of the alkene substrate.

Key intermediates in the metathesis reaction include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The alkenes are formed during the breaking of the C-C bond, and they play a crucial role in the subsequent rearrangement steps. The metallacyclobutanes are formed during the one-site mechanism and serve as intermediates in the formation of the cyclic alkene. These intermediates are stabilized by the strong electron-withdrawing properties of the tantalum center, which helps to promote the formation of the metallacyclobutane intermediate.

The role of the silica support is to stabilize the active tantalum centers and prevent them from clustering, which could lead to decreased activity and selectivity. The silica support also provides a surface for the deposition of the tantalum hydrides, which helps to maintain the dispersion of the active sites and improves the overall performance of the catalyst. The dispersion of the active sites is crucial for the efficient utilization of the catalyst and the maintenance of high activity and selectivity.

The factors contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions include the stability of the active tantalum centers, the dispersion of the active sites, the formation of key intermediates, and the coordination of the tantalum center. The stability of the active tantalum centers is crucial for maintaining high activity and selectivity, as it ensures that the catalyst remains active and does not undergo deactivation or poisoning. The dispersion of the active sites is crucial for the efficient utilization of the catalyst and the maintenance of high activity and selectivity. The formation of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, is crucial for the efficient conversion of the alkane substrates and the formation of the desired products. The coordination of the tantalum center is crucial for the stabilization of the intermediates and the promotion of the desired reaction pathways.

分析硅负载钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的全面机制，讨论双站点和单站点方案，线性与环状烷烃转化过程中的步骤，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和作用，以及这些因素如何贡献于反应选择性和催化剂性能在各种烷烃转换中。

硅负载钽氢化物表现出双站点和单站点两种烷烃裂合机制。在双站点机制中，线性烷烃经历协同重排，断裂一个C-C键并形成一个新的，导致两个烯烃的生成。这一过程由钽的强电子抽取性质促进，促进了C-C键的断裂。硅载体的作用是稳定活性钽中心，防止它们聚集，这可能导致活性和选择性的降低。

在单站点机制中，烷烃经历协同重排，但新的C-C键在同一个烯烃内形成，导致环状烯烃的生成。这一过程由形成金属环丁烷中间体促进，然后进行协同重排形成环状烯烃。金属环丁烷中间体的形成是此机制的关键步骤，其稳定性受钽中心的配合和烷烃基团的性质影响。

在裂合反应中，关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。烯烃在断裂C-C键时形成，对后续重排步骤至关重要。金属环丁烷在单站点机制中形成，并作为形成环状烯烃的中间体。这些中间体由钽中心的强电子抽取性质稳定，有助于促进金属环丁烷中间体的形成。

硅载体的作用是稳定活性钽中心，防止它们聚集，从而维持高活性和选择性。硅载体也为钽氢化物沉积提供表面，有助于保持活性位点的分散，提高催化剂的整体性能。活性位点的分散对于催化剂的有效利用和维持高活性和选择性至关重要。

反应选择性和催化剂性能在各种烷烃转换中的贡献因素包括活性钽中心的稳定性、活性位点的分散、关键中间体的形成和钽中心的配合。活性钽中心的稳定性对于保持高活性和选择性至关重要，因为它确保催化剂保持活性且不会发生失活或中毒。活性位点的分散对于催化剂的有效利用和维持高活性和选择性至关重要。形成关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，对于有效转化烷烃基团和形成所需产物至关重要。钽中心的配合对于中间体的稳定性和促进预期反应途径至关重要。

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two main schemes: two-site and one-site. In both mechanisms, the key process involves the insertion of a tantalum hydride species into the carbon-carbon bond of the alkane, followed by the elimination of hydrogen atoms to form a new alkene. This step is repeated, leading to the rearrangement of the alkane into a different structure. The formation of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, plays a crucial role in the reaction pathways. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the formation of these intermediates, the stability of the catalyst, and the kinetic barriers associated with the reaction steps. The catalysts often exhibit high efficiency in alkane metathesis due to their ability to efficiently insert and remove hydrogen atoms, leading to the formation of different alkene products.
