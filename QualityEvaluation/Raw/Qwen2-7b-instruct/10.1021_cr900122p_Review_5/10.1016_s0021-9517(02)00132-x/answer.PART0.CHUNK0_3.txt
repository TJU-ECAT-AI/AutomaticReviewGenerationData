[1] "Zeolites are solid catalysts with the following properties:• High surface area. • Molecular dimensions of the pores. • High adsorption capacity. • Partitioning of reactant/products."
[2] "The presence of strong electric fields and controllable adsorption properties within the pores will produce a unique type of catalyst,which by itself can be considered as a catalytic microreactor."
[3] "These researchers have shown that the use of the very weakly acid internal silanols of ZSM-5 zeolite has lead to an important commercial process such as the production of ε-caprolactam by the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two main schemes: two-site and one-site. In both mechanisms, the key process involves the insertion of a tantalum hydride species into the carbon-carbon bond of the alkane, followed by the elimination of hydrogen atoms to form a new alkene. This step is repeated, leading to the rearrangement of the alkane into a different structure. The formation of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, plays a crucial role in the reaction pathways. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the formation of these intermediates, the stability of the catalyst, and the kinetic barriers associated with the reaction steps. The catalysts often exhibit high efficiency in alkane metathesis due to their ability to efficiently insert and remove hydrogen atoms, leading to the formation of different alkene products.

催化作用由硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的全面机制涉及两种主要方案：双位点和单位点。在两种机制中，关键过程包括钽氢化物种插入烷烃中的碳-碳键，随后通过消除氢原子形成新的烯烃。这一步骤被重复执行，导致烷烃以不同的结构进行重组。关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成在反应路径中起着至关重要的作用。催化剂在各种烷烃转换中的选择性和性能受到中间体形成、催化剂稳定性以及反应步骤的动能壁垒的影响。催化剂通常在烷烃裂合中表现出高效率，由于其能够高效地插入并移除氢原子，从而形成不同的烯烃产物。
