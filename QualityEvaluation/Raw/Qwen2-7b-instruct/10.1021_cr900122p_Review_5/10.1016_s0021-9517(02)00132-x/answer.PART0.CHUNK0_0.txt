Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

Answer: The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, the catalyst facilitates the exchange of alkyl groups between two alkane molecules, leading to the formation of two new alkane molecules. The one-site mechanism involves the breaking and reformation of carbon-carbon bonds within a single alkane molecule, resulting in the creation of an alkene intermediate. Key intermediates in this process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the rearrangement of alkyl groups. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the stability of the catalyst, the efficiency of alkene formation, and the ability to control the orientation and position of the alkyl groups during the metathesis reaction.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制，讨论双位点和单位点方案，线性和环烷烃转化过程中涉及的过程，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其作用，以及这些因素如何影响各种烷烃转换的选择性和催化剂性能。

答案：烷烃裂合由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化机制包括双位点和单位点方案。在双位点机制中，催化剂促进两个烷烃分子之间烷基团的交换，导致两个新烷烃分子的生成。单位点机制涉及单个烷烃分子内碳-碳键的断裂和重组，结果产生烯烃中间体。该过程的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，在烷基团重新排列过程中起着至关重要的作用。催化剂在烷烃转换中的选择性和性能受到催化剂稳定性、烯烃形成效率和控制烷基团位置和方向能力的影响。
