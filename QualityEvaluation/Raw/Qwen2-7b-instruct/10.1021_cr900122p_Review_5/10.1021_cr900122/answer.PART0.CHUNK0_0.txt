Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides reveals that both two-site and one-site mechanisms are involved. The two-site mechanism utilizes tantalum hydrides as key intermediates, with the formation and conversion of alkene intermediates occurring within the coordination sphere of the metal center. The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, facilitating the homologation process through [2 + 2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion. Linear alkane transformations primarily involve the key processes of [2 + 2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion. In cyclic alkane transformations, the initial steps include CH bond activation and CC bond cleavage, leading to the formation of products. Catalyst performance is significantly influenced by the selectivity in higher and lower alkane homologues, which is consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process.

分析由硅基支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃环化反应的全面机制显示，涉及两种站点和单一站点机制。两站点机制利用钽氢化物作为关键中间体，形成和转化的烯烃中间体发生在金属中心的配位球内。单一站点机制基于钽烷基烷基二烯中间体，通过[2 + 2]-环加成和环重组促进同系物过程。线性烷烃转化主要涉及[2 + 2]-环加成和环重组的关键步骤。在环烷烃转化中，初始步骤包括CH键激活和CC键断裂，导致产物的形成。催化剂性能显著受较高和较低同系物选择性的影响，这与烷烃同系物过程是关键同系物过程的事实完全一致。
