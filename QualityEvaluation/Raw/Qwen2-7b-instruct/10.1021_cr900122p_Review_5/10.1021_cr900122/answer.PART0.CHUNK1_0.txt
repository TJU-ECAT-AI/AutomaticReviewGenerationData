The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. This process can be categorized into two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, a chain transfer occurs followed by a metathesis reaction, which favors linear alkane transformations. Conversely, in the one-site scheme, a single-step metathesis takes place, leading to more likely cyclic alkane transformations.

催化硅基支持钽氢化物的烷烃环化机制涉及形成烯烃和金属环丁烷作为关键中间体。这一过程可以分为双位点和单位点方案。在双位点方案中，先发生链转移，随后进行环化反应，有利于线性烷烃的转化。相反，在单位点方案中，一步环化反应发生，更可能促进环状烷烃的转化。
