Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, two primary schemes have been identified: one-site and two-site mechanisms. The one-site mechanism involves the coordination of an alkane substrate to a single tantalum site, leading to the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate. The subsequent rearrangement of this metallacyclobutane leads to the formation of two alkenes, completing the metathesis reaction. 

In contrast, the two-site mechanism involves the sequential addition of two alkane molecules to distinct tantalum sites. Both mechanisms ultimately result in the same final products, but through different pathways. The selectivity towards certain alkene products is influenced by the steric and electronic properties of the tantalum sites. The stability and reactivity of the metallacyclobutane intermediate significantly impact the overall efficiency of the metathesis reaction.

The DFT calculations demonstrate that the activation of the alkane substrate occurs through the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes rearrangement to produce two alkenes, marking the completion of the metathesis process. The selectivity towards specific alkene products is attributed to the unique characteristics of the tantalum sites, including their steric hindrance and electronic structure. The stability and reactivity of the metallacyclobutane intermediate play a pivotal role in determining the overall performance of the catalytic system.

对于由硅酸盐支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃环化，全面机制被解析为两种主要方案：单站点和双站点机制。单站点机制涉及一个烷烃底物与单个钽位点的配合，导致形成一个金属环丁烷中间体。随后，这个金属环丁烷的重组导致形成两个烯烃，完成环化反应。

相比之下，双站点机制涉及两个烷烃分子分别添加到不同的钽位点上。这两种机制最终都产生相同的产品，但通过不同的途径。特定烯烃产物的选择性由钽位点的独特属性决定，包括它们的空间阻碍和电子结构。金属环丁烷中间体的稳定性和反应活性在确定催化体系的整体性能中起着关键作用。

密度泛函理论计算表明，烷烃底物的活化发生在形成金属环丁烷中间体的过程中。该中间体随后经历重组以产生两个烯烃，标志着环化过程的完成。特定烯烃产物的选择性归因于钽位点的独特特性，包括它们的空间阻碍和电子结构。金属环丁烷中间体的稳定性和反应活性在确定催化系统整体性能中发挥着至关重要的作用。
