Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides reveals that both two-site and one-site mechanisms are involved. The two-site mechanism utilizes tantalum hydrides as key intermediates, with the formation and conversion of alkene intermediates occurring within the coordination sphere of the metal center. The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, facilitating the homologation process through [2 + 2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion. Linear alkane transformations primarily involve the key processes of [2 + 2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion. In cyclic alkane transformations, the initial steps include CH bond activation and CC bond cleavage, leading to the formation of products. Catalyst performance is significantly influenced by the selectivity in higher and lower alkane homologues, which is consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process.

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. 

In the two-site mechanism, two key intermediates are involved. Initially, a CH bond activation forms H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species. One site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site evolves towards a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer. The alkene, produced by the first site, undergoes a homologation process on the second site, leading to different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps provide a way to liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues. 

In the one-site mechanism, the formation and conversion of alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center. This involves the creation and conversion of alkyl alkylidene intermediates. 

Cyclic alkane transformations involve a key step of CH bond activation, followed by CC bond cleavage through β-alkyl transfer. Lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues are formed via subsequent steps like hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement. 

These factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The selectivity in higher homologues is due to the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, consistent with alkene metathesis as the key homologation process.

催化作用下，硅基钽氢化物对各种烷烃的反应产生相应的金属烷基复合物和H2。在两个站点机制中，涉及到两个关键中间体。首先，通过CH键激活形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。一个站点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，再生钽氢化物。另一个站点通过α-H转移转化为Ta-烷基二烯氢化物。由第一个站点产生的烯烃在第二个站点经历同系化过程，产生不同的烯烃和烷基二烯物种。随后的氢化和氢解步骤提供了一种释放较低和较高同系烷烃的方式。

在单站点机制中，烷烃和烯烃中间体的形成和转化发生在金属中心的配位球内。这涉及烷基二烯中间体的创建和转换。 

环烷烃转化涉及CH键激活的关键步骤，随后是通过β-烷基迁移的CC键断裂。通过后续步骤如氢化、氢解和重排，形成较低环和直链烷烃同系物。

这些因素在各种烷烃转化中影响反应选择性和催化剂性能。较高选择性主要是由于存在主要的n  1和n + 1直链同系物，与作为主要同系化过程的烯烃互换一致。

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, two primary schemes have been identified: one-site and two-site mechanisms. The one-site mechanism involves the coordination of an alkane substrate to a single tantalum site, leading to the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate. The subsequent rearrangement of this metallacyclobutane leads to the formation of two alkenes, completing the metathesis reaction. 

In contrast, the two-site mechanism involves the sequential addition of two alkane molecules to distinct tantalum sites. Both mechanisms ultimately result in the same final products, but through different pathways. The selectivity towards certain alkene products is influenced by the steric and electronic properties of the tantalum sites. The stability and reactivity of the metallacyclobutane intermediate significantly impact the overall efficiency of the metathesis reaction.

The DFT calculations demonstrate that the activation of the alkane substrate occurs through the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes rearrangement to produce two alkenes, marking the completion of the metathesis process. The selectivity towards specific alkene products is attributed to the unique characteristics of the tantalum sites, including their steric hindrance and electronic structure. The stability and reactivity of the metallacyclobutane intermediate play a pivotal role in determining the overall performance of the catalytic system.

[5] "While the silica supported system is inactive, probably because of a fast decomposition, the silicaalumina and alumina supported systems display activities comparable to those of the corresponding tantalum alkyl alkylidene systems (entries 810) and a greater selectivity for n  1 and n + 1 homologues (entries 67)."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, two distinct schemes can be discerned: the two-site mechanism and the one-site mechanism. 

In the two-site mechanism, CH bond activation initiates the process, leading to the formation of H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species. Subsequently, one site transforms an alkane into an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides. Simultaneously, the other site evolves towards a Ta-alkylidene hydride through an α-H transfer. This mechanism is supported by the formation of alkenes and the regeneration of the active species.

Conversely, the one-site mechanism relies on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. The formation and conversion of alkene intermediates occur within the coordination sphere of the metal center, similar to the process of cross-metathesis products formed from the reaction of an alkane and a neopentyl neopentylidene surface complex.

These two mechanisms are complemented by the development of various catalysts based on well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes. When prepared on silicaalumina, alumina, or tailored-made supports, these catalysts exhibit similar activities and selectivities to the original silica-supported tantalum hydrides.

Moreover, the silica-supported system appears inactive, likely due to a rapid decomposition. In contrast, silicaalumina and alumina-supported systems demonstrate comparable activities to the corresponding tantalum alkyl alkylidene systems, while also offering enhanced selectivity for n  1 and n + 1 homologues.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides encompasses both two-site and one-site schemes, with the formation of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

分析由硅基支撑的钽化氢催化烷烃裂合的全面机制，可以发现两种不同的方案：双站点机制和单一站点机制。在双站点机制中，CH键激活启动过程，形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。随后，一个站点通过β-H转移将烷基转化为烯烃，同时再生钽化氢；另一个站点通过α-H转移向Ta-烷基烯烃氢化物转化。这一机制得到了形成烯烃和再生活性物种的支持。

相比之下，单一站点机制依赖于钽烷基烷基烯烃中间体，在硅基支持的钽化氢或二戊基五聚体钽表面复合物的基础上形成。在金属中心的协调范围内，形成和转换的烯烃中间体类似于从烷烃和二戊基五聚体表面复合物反应形成的交叉异构化产物。

这两种机制被各种基于定义明确的金属氢、烷基烷基烯烃或烷基烯烃表面复合物的催化剂所补充。当准备在硅基氧化铝、氧化铝或定制设计的支持上时，这些催化剂表现出与原始硅基支持的钽化氢相似的活动性和选择性。

此外，硅基系统似乎无效，可能是因为快速分解。相反，硅基氧化铝和氧化铝支持系统显示出与相应的钽烷基烷基烯烃系统相当的活动性，同时也提高了n  1和n + 1同系物的选择性。

综上所述，由硅基支撑的钽化氢催化烷烃裂合的全面机制包括双站点和单一站点方案，关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷的形成有助于反应选择性和催化剂性能在各种烷烃转化中的表现。

The CATOFIN process uses chromium oxide supported on alumina to produce propene and isobutene from corresponding alkanes. The active sites are isolated Cr3+ in a pseudo-octahedral environment. The CH bond activation on a CrOS bond forms a Cr-alkyl intermediate, which decomposes via β-H transfer to form an alkene and a CrIIIH surface species. The CH bond activation on this intermediate proceeds via a σ-bond metathesis step, leading to a new alkyl intermediate.

These intermediates play crucial roles in alkane homologation and the conversion of linear and cyclic alkanes. The processes involved in linear alkane transformations include CH bond activation, CC bond cleavage via β-alkyl transfer, and hydrogenolysis. For cyclic alkane transformations, after the formation of cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, a γ-H activation yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps like hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues.

Reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by the control of the density and accessibility of active sites on oxide surfaces. The two-site and one-site mechanisms, the role of key intermediates, and the control of active site structures contribute to the selectivity and performance of these catalysts in alkane metathesis. The use of supercritical conditions enables the catalytic conversion of propane into higher and lower homologues by silica or silicaalumina supported zirconium hydrides or alkyl, demonstrating the potential of these systems in alkane conversion processes.

分析硅基支撑钽氢化物催化烷烃交叉偶联的全面机制，讨论双站点和单站点方案、线性与环烷烃转化过程中的关键步骤，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其作用，以及这些因素如何促进不同烷烃转换的选择性和催化剂性能。

双站点机制涉及钽氢化物作为关键中间体。在通过CH键活化形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种后，一个站点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，从而再生钽氢化物；另一个站点通过α-H转移演化为Ta-烷基二烯醇衍生物。单站点机制基于从硅基钽氢化物或二戊基钽表面复合物原位形成的钽烷基二烯醇中间体。总体上，已经开发了一系列基于定义明确的金属氢化物、烷基二烯醇或烷基二烯的催化剂（表4和图27d）。在超临界条件下，硅或硅铝酸盐支持的锆氢化物或烷基催化丙烷转化为更高和更低的同系物。

关键中间体的形成和作用包括烯烃和金属环丁烷的生成。烯烃通过β-H转移生成，而金属环丁烷通过α-烷基迁移形成。这些中间体在烷烃同系化和线性与环烷烃转化中发挥关键作用。线性烷烃转化过程包括CH键激活、CC键裂解通过β-烷基转移，以及氢化反应。对于环烷烃转化，首先通过CH键激活形成环烷基衍生物，随后γ-H激活产生金属环丁烷中间体，该中间体可以经历环裂解、氢化和重排等后续步骤以生成较低的环烷烃同系物和再生活性物种。

反应选择性和催化剂性能在不同烷烃转换过程中受到氧化物表面活性位点密度和可访问性的控制。双站点和单站点机制、关键中间体的作用以及活性位点结构的控制对这些催化剂在烷烃交叉偶联中的选择性和性能具有重要影响。在超临界条件下，硅或硅铝酸盐支持的锆氢化物或烷基能够催化丙烷转化为更高和更低的同系物，这展示了这些系统在烷烃转换过程中的潜力。
