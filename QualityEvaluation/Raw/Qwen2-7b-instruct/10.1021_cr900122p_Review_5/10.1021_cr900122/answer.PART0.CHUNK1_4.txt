Mechanistic insights into the alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involve the formation of an intermediate metallacyclobutane species. This intermediate then undergoes ring-opening and recombination to produce the product alkene. The reaction pathway is influenced by the structure of the silica support and the coordination environment of the tantalum center.

[2] "The study found that the catalyst shows high activity for linear alkane metathesis."
[3] "In contrast, the catalyst shows lower activity for cyclic alkane metathesis."
[4] "The selectivity towards linear alkane products was attributed to the formation of a specific intermediate."
