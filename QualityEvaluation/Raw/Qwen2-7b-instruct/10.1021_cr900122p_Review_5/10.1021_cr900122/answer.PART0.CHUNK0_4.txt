[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."
[2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."
[3] "Overall, several catalysts have been developed on the basis of well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes (Table 4 and Scheme 27d): Tantalum hydrides prepared on various oxide supports: silicaalumina, alumina, and tailored made supports (entries 14), but they display similar activities and selectivities with the original silica supported tantalum hydrides."
[4] "While silica or silicaalumina supported zirconium hydrides or alkyl do not display any catalytic activity in alkane metathesis under standard conditions (150 C and ca. 1 bar), they catalytically convert propane into higher and lower homologues under supercritical conditions (Table 4, entries 1718)."

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The two-site mechanism involves tantalum hydrides as key intermediates. After CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer. The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. Overall, several catalysts have been developed on the basis of well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes. Under supercritical conditions, silica or silicaalumina supported zirconium hydrides or alkyl catalytically convert propane into higher and lower homologues.

The formation and role of key intermediates include the generation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Alkenes are generated by β-H transfer, and metallacyclobutanes are formed via α-alkyl transfer. These intermediates play crucial roles in alkane homologation and the conversion of linear and cyclic alkanes. The processes involved in linear alkane transformations include CH bond activation, CC bond cleavage via β-alkyl transfer, and hydrogenolysis. For cyclic alkane transformations, after the formation of cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, a γ-H activation yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps like hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues.

Reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by the control of the density and accessibility of active sites on oxide surfaces. The two-site and one-site mechanisms, the role of key intermediates, and the control of active site structures contribute to the selectivity and performance of these catalysts in alkane metathesis. The use of supercritical conditions enables the catalytic conversion of propane into higher and lower homologues by silica or silicaalumina supported zirconium hydrides or alkyl, demonstrating the potential of these systems in alkane conversion processes.

分析硅基支撑钽氢化物催化烷烃交叉偶联的全面机制，讨论双站点和单站点方案、线性与环烷烃转化过程中的关键步骤，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其作用，以及这些因素如何促进不同烷烃转换的选择性和催化剂性能。

双站点机制涉及钽氢化物作为关键中间体。在通过CH键活化形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种后，一个站点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，从而再生钽氢化物；另一个站点通过α-H转移演化为Ta-烷基二烯醇衍生物。单站点机制基于从硅基钽氢化物或二戊基钽表面复合物原位形成的钽烷基二烯醇中间体。总体上，已经开发了一系列基于定义明确的金属氢化物、烷基二烯醇或烷基二烯的催化剂（表4和图27d）。在超临界条件下，硅或硅铝酸盐支持的锆氢化物或烷基催化丙烷转化为更高和更低的同系物。

关键中间体的形成和作用包括烯烃和金属环丁烷的生成。烯烃通过β-H转移生成，而金属环丁烷通过α-烷基迁移形成。这些中间体在烷烃同系化和线性与环烷烃转化中发挥关键作用。线性烷烃转化过程包括CH键激活、CC键裂解通过β-烷基转移，以及氢化反应。对于环烷烃转化，首先通过CH键激活形成环烷基衍生物，随后γ-H激活产生金属环丁烷中间体，该中间体可以经历环裂解、氢化和重排等后续步骤以生成较低的环烷烃同系物和再生活性物种。

反应选择性和催化剂性能在不同烷烃转换过程中受到氧化物表面活性位点密度和可访问性的控制。双站点和单站点机制、关键中间体的作用以及活性位点结构的控制对这些催化剂在烷烃交叉偶联中的选择性和性能具有重要影响。在超临界条件下，硅或硅铝酸盐支持的锆氢化物或烷基能够催化丙烷转化为更高和更低的同系物，这展示了这些系统在烷烃转换过程中的潜力。
