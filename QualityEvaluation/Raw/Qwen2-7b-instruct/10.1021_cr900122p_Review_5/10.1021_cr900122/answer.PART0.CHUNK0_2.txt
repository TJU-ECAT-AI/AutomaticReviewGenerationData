[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."
[2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."
[3] "In this case, the formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center, as shown previously for the formation of cross-metathesis products, resulting from the reaction of an alkane and a neopentyl neopentylidene surface complex."
[4] "Overall, several catalysts have been developed on the basis of well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes (Table 4 and Scheme 27d): Tantalum hydrides prepared on various oxide supports: silicaalumina, alumina, and tailored made supports (entries 14), but they display similar activities and selectivities with the original silica supported tantalum hydrides."
[5] "While the silica supported system is inactive, probably because of a fast decomposition, the silicaalumina and alumina supported systems display activities comparable to those of the corresponding tantalum alkyl alkylidene systems (entries 810) and a greater selectivity for n  1 and n + 1 homologues (entries 67)."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, two distinct schemes can be discerned: the two-site mechanism and the one-site mechanism. 

In the two-site mechanism, CH bond activation initiates the process, leading to the formation of H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species. Subsequently, one site transforms an alkane into an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides. Simultaneously, the other site evolves towards a Ta-alkylidene hydride through an α-H transfer. This mechanism is supported by the formation of alkenes and the regeneration of the active species.

Conversely, the one-site mechanism relies on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. The formation and conversion of alkene intermediates occur within the coordination sphere of the metal center, similar to the process of cross-metathesis products formed from the reaction of an alkane and a neopentyl neopentylidene surface complex.

These two mechanisms are complemented by the development of various catalysts based on well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes. When prepared on silicaalumina, alumina, or tailored-made supports, these catalysts exhibit similar activities and selectivities to the original silica-supported tantalum hydrides.

Moreover, the silica-supported system appears inactive, likely due to a rapid decomposition. In contrast, silicaalumina and alumina-supported systems demonstrate comparable activities to the corresponding tantalum alkyl alkylidene systems, while also offering enhanced selectivity for n  1 and n + 1 homologues.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides encompasses both two-site and one-site schemes, with the formation of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

分析由硅基支撑的钽化氢催化烷烃裂合的全面机制，可以发现两种不同的方案：双站点机制和单一站点机制。在双站点机制中，CH键激活启动过程，形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。随后，一个站点通过β-H转移将烷基转化为烯烃，同时再生钽化氢；另一个站点通过α-H转移向Ta-烷基烯烃氢化物转化。这一机制得到了形成烯烃和再生活性物种的支持。

相比之下，单一站点机制依赖于钽烷基烷基烯烃中间体，在硅基支持的钽化氢或二戊基五聚体钽表面复合物的基础上形成。在金属中心的协调范围内，形成和转换的烯烃中间体类似于从烷烃和二戊基五聚体表面复合物反应形成的交叉异构化产物。

这两种机制被各种基于定义明确的金属氢、烷基烷基烯烃或烷基烯烃表面复合物的催化剂所补充。当准备在硅基氧化铝、氧化铝或定制设计的支持上时，这些催化剂表现出与原始硅基支持的钽化氢相似的活动性和选择性。

此外，硅基系统似乎无效，可能是因为快速分解。相反，硅基氧化铝和氧化铝支持系统显示出与相应的钽烷基烷基烯烃系统相当的活动性，同时也提高了n  1和n + 1同系物的选择性。

综上所述，由硅基支撑的钽化氢催化烷烃裂合的全面机制包括双站点和单一站点方案，关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷的形成有助于反应选择性和催化剂性能在各种烷烃转化中的表现。
