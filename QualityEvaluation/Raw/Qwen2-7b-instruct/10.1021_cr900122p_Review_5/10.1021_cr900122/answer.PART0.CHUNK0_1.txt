[1] "Silica-supported tantalum hydrides react with a wide range of alkanes to yield the corresponding metal alkyl complexes and H2."
[2] "The hydrogenolysis of alkanes and paraffins occurs catalytically at low temperatures on metal hydrides supported on various oxides, e.g. silica, silicaalumina, or alumina."
[3] "The key step of this process probably involved the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, a β-H transfer process."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. 

In the two-site mechanism, two key intermediates are involved. Initially, a CH bond activation forms H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species. One site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site evolves towards a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer. The alkene, produced by the first site, undergoes a homologation process on the second site, leading to different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps provide a way to liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues. 

In the one-site mechanism, the formation and conversion of alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center. This involves the creation and conversion of alkyl alkylidene intermediates. 

Cyclic alkane transformations involve a key step of CH bond activation, followed by CC bond cleavage through β-alkyl transfer. Lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues are formed via subsequent steps like hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement. 

These factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The selectivity in higher homologues is due to the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, consistent with alkene metathesis as the key homologation process.

催化作用下，硅基钽氢化物对各种烷烃的反应产生相应的金属烷基复合物和H2。在两个站点机制中，涉及到两个关键中间体。首先，通过CH键激活形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。一个站点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，再生钽氢化物。另一个站点通过α-H转移转化为Ta-烷基二烯氢化物。由第一个站点产生的烯烃在第二个站点经历同系化过程，产生不同的烯烃和烷基二烯物种。随后的氢化和氢解步骤提供了一种释放较低和较高同系烷烃的方式。

在单站点机制中，烷烃和烯烃中间体的形成和转化发生在金属中心的配位球内。这涉及烷基二烯中间体的创建和转换。 

环烷烃转化涉及CH键激活的关键步骤，随后是通过β-烷基迁移的CC键断裂。通过后续步骤如氢化、氢解和重排，形成较低环和直链烷烃同系物。

这些因素在各种烷烃转化中影响反应选择性和催化剂性能。较高选择性主要是由于存在主要的n  1和n + 1直链同系物，与作为主要同系化过程的烯烃互换一致。
