Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes. DFT calculations reveal that the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate is a critical step in this catalytic process. Key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, are vital in the linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The catalyst performance in different alkane conversions is determined by factors related to the stability of these intermediates and their subsequent rearrangement pathways.
