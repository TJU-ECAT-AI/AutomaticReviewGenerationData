[1] "The CATOFIN process, which is used to produce propene and isobutene from the corresponding alkanes, is performed with catalysts based on chromium oxide supported on alumina."
[2] "Despite the complexity of the surface state of the catalysts, a consensus has been emerging: the active sites probably correspond to an isolated Cr3+ in a pseudo-octahedral environment."
[3] "The current proposed mechanism involves the CH bond activation on a CrOS bond, thus forming a Cr-alkyl intermediate, which can decompose via β-H transfer, to form the alkene and a CrIIIH surface species."
[4] "While the direct elimination of H2 from this species is highly disfavored, the subsequent CH bond activation on this intermediate via a favorable σ-bond metathesis step leads to a new Malkyl intermediate and thereby to a viable catalytic pathway."
[5] "Elementary steps for these reactions and particularly the CH bond activation step have been a matter of debate for many years, and several reaction pathways can be proposed depending on the structure of the active sites: terminal metal oxo or μ-oxo species, isolated vs polynuclear species."

The CATOFIN process uses chromium oxide supported on alumina to produce propene and isobutene from corresponding alkanes. The active sites are isolated Cr3+ in a pseudo-octahedral environment. The CH bond activation on a CrOS bond forms a Cr-alkyl intermediate, which decomposes via β-H transfer to form an alkene and a CrIIIH surface species. The CH bond activation on this intermediate proceeds via a σ-bond metathesis step, leading to a new alkyl intermediate. Multiple reaction pathways exist for CH bond activation depending on the active site structure.

CATOFIN过程使用铬氧化物支持在氧化铝上产生丙烯和异丁烯。活性位点是孤立的Cr3+在伪八面体环境中。在CrOS键上的CH键活化形成Cr-烷基中间体，通过β-H转移分解为烯烃和CrIIIH表面物种。在该中间体上的CH键活化通过一个σ键重排步骤进行，导致一个新的烷基中间体。根据活性位点结构存在多种反应途径进行CH键活化。
