The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. This process facilitates linear and cyclic alkane transformations through the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These factors contribute significantly to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.
