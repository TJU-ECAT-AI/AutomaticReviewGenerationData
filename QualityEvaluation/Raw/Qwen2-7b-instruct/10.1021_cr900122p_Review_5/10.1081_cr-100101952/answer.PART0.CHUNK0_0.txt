<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document does not provide a comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, nor how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. Therefore, I cannot answer the question based on the provided literature.

文档没有提供关于由硅负载钽氢化物催化进行的烷烃互变异构的全面机制，讨论双位点和单位点方案，线性与环烷烃转化过程，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其在各种烷烃转化中的作用，以及这些因素如何影响反应选择性和催化剂性能。因此，我无法基于提供的文献回答这个问题。
