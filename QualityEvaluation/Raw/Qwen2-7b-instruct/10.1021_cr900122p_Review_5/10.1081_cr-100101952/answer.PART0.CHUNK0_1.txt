The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two-site and one-site schemes. This process facilitates linear and cyclic alkane transformations, leading to the formation of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These intermediates play critical roles in determining the reaction selectivity and enhancing the performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
