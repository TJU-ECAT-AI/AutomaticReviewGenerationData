In the context of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, the comprehensive mechanism involves both two-site and one-site schemes. Linear and cyclic alkane transformations are facilitated through the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by the ability of the silica support to act as an inert support, stabilize metal complexes, modify adsorption properties, concentrate reactants, preactivate reactants, or help stabilize transition states. Molecular imprinting of metal complexes plays a crucial role in the design of catalysts capable of catalyzing cascade reactions. Conclusions drawn from the study highlight the importance of these strategies in achieving efficient alkane metathesis.
