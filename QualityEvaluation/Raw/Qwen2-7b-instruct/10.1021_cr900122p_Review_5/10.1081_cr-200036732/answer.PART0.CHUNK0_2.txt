Attempts to bridge the gap between enzymatic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous catalysis involve developing catalysts that mimic enzyme properties, utilize catalytic antibodies, employ imprinted transition state analogues, and combine shape recognition with active sites. Homogeneous and homogeneous-supported catalysts, which act as inert supports, help stabilize metal complexes and modify adsorption properties. Multisite catalysts designed for cascading reactions enhance the efficiency of various alkane conversions.
