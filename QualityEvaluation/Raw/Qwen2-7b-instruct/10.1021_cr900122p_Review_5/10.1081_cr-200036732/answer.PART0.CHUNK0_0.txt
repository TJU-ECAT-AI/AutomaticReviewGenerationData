Attempts to bridge the gap between enzymatic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous catalysis involve mimicking enzyme-like properties in catalysts, utilizing catalytic antibodies, imprinting transition state analogues, combining transition state shape recognition with active sites, and designing multisite catalysts for cascading reactions. These strategies aim to achieve high specificity and efficiency in complex reactions, similar to enzymes, while maintaining stability and scalability typical of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts.

尝试在酶催化、均相催化和非均相催化之间填补差距，包括模仿酶的特性，利用催化抗体，印制过渡态类似物，结合过渡态形状识别与活性位点，以及设计用于级联反应的多活性中心催化剂。这些策略旨在实现复杂反应的高特异性和效率，类似于酶，同时保持均相和非均相催化剂的稳定性和可扩展性。
