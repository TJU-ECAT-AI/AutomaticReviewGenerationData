[1] "The net transformation of the established steps is the selective oxidation of methane to methanol with molecular oxygen."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a two-step process. In the first step, linear alkane molecules are transformed into alkenes through a concerted mechanism, while cyclic alkane molecules undergo a similar transformation to form metallacyclobutanes. These intermediates play crucial roles in the subsequent reactions, contributing to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. The two-site scheme involves the simultaneous activation of both ends of the alkane chain, leading to the formation of two alkenes. The one-site scheme, on the other hand, involves the sequential activation of the alkane, resulting in the formation of a single alkene. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, facilitate the rearrangement of alkane structures, enabling efficient and selective transformations.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two distinct schemes: a two-site and a one-site approach. In the context of this document, the focus is on the mechanism of methane oxidation to methanol catalyzed by mercuric ions (Hg(ll)) under mild conditions. The reaction sequence includes activation of methane, functionalization, and reoxidation steps. 

During the activation step, methane undergoes a net electrophilic displacement reaction with mercuric bisulfate to produce methyl mercuric bisulfate (1). This species then decomposes in the functionalization step, yielding methyl bisulfate, sulfur dioxide, mercurous bisulfate, and methane. The reoxidation step involves the rapid oxidation of mercurous bisulfate by sulfuric acid, regenerating mercuric bisulfate and producing sulfur dioxide.

Key intermediates in this mechanism include methyl mercuric bisulfate (1), which is formed during the activation step, and methyl bisulfate, which is produced in the functionalization step. These intermediates play crucial roles in the overall process of methane oxidation to methanol. The catalyst's performance is influenced by factors such as the selectivity of the reaction, the efficiency of the conversion, and the stability of the catalyst under various conditions.

The mechanisms described in the document demonstrate the effectiveness of sulfuric acid as an effective oxygen-atom transfer reagent for methane oxidation, highlighting the potential for developing more efficient systems for alkane conversions. The use of posttransition metal ions, such as Hg(II) and Th(III), in selective oxidation reactions adds credibility to the notion that electrophilic, metal-mediated oxidation of alkanes can occur through intermediate alkyl metal species.

The detailed examination of the key intermediates and the reaction steps contributes to a deeper understanding of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, offering insights into reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

该文档中所描述的烷烃裂解催化机制涉及两种不同的方案：双位点和单位点方法。在本背景下，重点是汞离子（Hg(ll)）在温和条件下催化甲烷氧化为甲醇的机制。反应序列包括激活、功能化和再氧化步骤。

激活步骤中，甲烷通过与汞硫酸盐的净亲电取代反应被激活，生成甲基汞硫酸盐（1）。然后，在功能化步骤中，该物种分解产生甲基硫酸盐、二氧化硫、二价汞硫酸盐和甲烷。再氧化步骤涉及热浓硫酸快速将二价汞硫酸盐氧化为汞硫酸盐，并形成二氧化硫。

机制中的关键中间体包括在激活步骤中形成的甲基汞硫酸盐（1），以及在功能化步骤中产生的甲基硫酸盐。这些中间体在甲烷氧化至甲醇的总体过程中发挥着关键作用。催化剂的性能受反应选择性、转化效率和催化剂在各种条件下的稳定性等因素的影响。

文档中描述的机制表明硫酸作为甲烷氧化的有效氧原子转移试剂的有效性，突出了开发更高效系统进行烷烃转换的潜力。使用过渡后金属离子，如Hg(II)和Th(III)，在选择性氧化反应中具有重要意义，这进一步证实了烷烃通过中间烷基金属物种的电磷酰基、金属介导氧化可以发生。

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two distinct schemes: two-site and one-site. In the two-site scheme, the process typically includes linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Linear alkane transformations often involve the generation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes, while cyclic alkane transformations might lead to the formation of metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are largely determined by the formation and role of these intermediates. The one-site scheme refers to a more localized interaction where the transformation occurs at a single site on the catalyst surface, affecting the reaction pathway and product distribution differently than the two-site scheme. The detailed mechanisms, including the formation and role of intermediates, contribute significantly to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in different alkane conversions.
