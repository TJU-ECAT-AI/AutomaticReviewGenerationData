[1] "We describe the use of Hg(II) to catalyze the selective oxidation of methane to methanol, through methyl bisulfate, in high yield, -43% (9)."
[2] "Under these conditions, 1 readily decomposes to CH30SO3H and the reduced mercurous species, Hg22"
[3] "The reaction is quite efficient and, to our knowledge, unprecedented."
[4] "Consistent with the high yield of methyl bisulfate, control experiments have shown that the rate of oxidation of methyl bisulfate by the Hg(II)-sulfuric acid system is less than the rate of oxidation of methane."
[5] "Our observations do not imply that Hg(OSO3H)2 is the species that activates methane."
[6] "At this time, the identity of this species is unknown."
[7] "The evidence for the involvement of the functionalization step shown in Scheme 2 is straightforward and quite compelling."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two primary schemes: two-site and one-site mechanisms. In the two-site mechanism, linear alkane transformations are facilitated through the formation of alkenes, while cyclic alkane transformations lead to the creation of metallacyclobutanes. Key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The formation and stability of these intermediates influence the efficiency of alkane conversions. The detailed examination of the key intermediates under controlled conditions allows for a deeper understanding of the catalytic process, contributing to the development of more efficient alkane conversion systems.

烷烃裂合由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的主要机制涉及两种主要方案：双位点和单位点机制。在双位点机制中，线性烷烃转换通过形成烯烃得以促进，而环烷烃转换导致了金属环丁烷的产生。关键中间体，包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，在决定反应选择性和催化剂性能方面发挥着关键作用。这些中间体的形成和稳定性影响了烷烃转化的效率。在受控条件下对关键中间体进行详细研究，有助于更深入地理解催化过程，并为开发更高效的烷烃转换系统提供指导。
