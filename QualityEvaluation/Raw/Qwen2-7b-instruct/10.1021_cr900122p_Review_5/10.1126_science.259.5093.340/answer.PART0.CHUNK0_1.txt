[1] "The net transformation of the established steps is the selective oxidation of methane to methanol with molecular oxygen."
[2] "The working model based on the available data is shown in Scheme 2."
[3] "The activation of methane is proposed to occur through a net electrophilic displacement reaction with mercuric bisulfate to produce methyl mercuric bisulfate, 1."
[4] "In the reoxidation step, the mercurous bisulfate is oxidized by sulfuric acid, regenerating mercuric bisulfate."
[5] "In the activation step, an electrophilic displacement mechanism is assumed because of the similarity of this reaction to other electrophilic reactions involving hydrocarbons and metal electrophiles."
[6] "The identity of intermediate 1 was confirmed by comparison to a sample prepared independently by treatment of dimethyl mercury with one equivalent of sulfuric acid."
[7] "Independent reactions of 1 with H2SO4 confirmed that protolysis, the microscopic reverse of the activation step, occurs at 180°C to produce Hg(OSO3H)2 and methane."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a two-site and one-site scheme, with processes including linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes form, contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The formation of these intermediates through electrophilic displacement mechanisms, followed by reoxidation steps, leads to the selective oxidation of methane to methanol with molecular oxygen. The identity of the activation step intermediate, 1, is confirmed through independent synthesis and reaction tests, providing strong evidence for its role in the catalytic sequence.
