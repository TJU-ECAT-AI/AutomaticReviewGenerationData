The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a two-step process. In the first step, linear alkane molecules are transformed into alkenes through a concerted mechanism, while cyclic alkane molecules undergo a similar transformation to form metallacyclobutanes. These intermediates play crucial roles in the subsequent reactions, contributing to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. The two-site scheme involves the simultaneous activation of both ends of the alkane chain, leading to the formation of two alkenes. The one-site scheme, on the other hand, involves the sequential activation of the alkane, resulting in the formation of a single alkene. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, facilitate the rearrangement of alkane structures, enabling efficient and selective transformations.

烷烃互变异构催化由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的全面机制涉及两个步骤过程。第一步，线性烷烃分子通过协同机制转化为烯烃，而环烷烃分子则通过类似的过程形成金属环丁烷。这些中间体在后续反应中发挥着关键作用，对催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能有重要影响。双位点方案涉及同时激活烷烃链的两端，导致形成两个烯烃。单位点方案则涉及依次激活烷烃，导致形成一个单烯烃。关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，促进烷烃结构的重排，实现高效且选择性的转化。
