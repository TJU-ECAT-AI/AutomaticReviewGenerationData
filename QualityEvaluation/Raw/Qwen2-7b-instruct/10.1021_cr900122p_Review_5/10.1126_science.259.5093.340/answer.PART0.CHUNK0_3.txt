[1] "A significant amount of work exploring the electrophilic reactions of alkanes with transition metals has been reported (11,12). However, to our knowledge, the elec- trophilic reaction of methane with Hg(II),a posttransition metal, has not been report- ed (13)."
[2] "Hg(II) is a "soft" (14), powerful electrophile with good oxidizing properties (15)."
[3] "The reaction stoichiometry is shown in Eq. 4: Hg(II)
CH4 + 2 H2S04 -
a CH30SO3H
+ 2 H20 + SO2"
[4] "Consistent with this stoichiometry, the co- production of sulfur dioxide was observed."
[5] "The methyl bisulfate solution produced in the reaction can be readily hydrolyzed (Eq. 5) and the metha- nol can be isolated by distillation:"
[6] "Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analyses of isolated samples of methanol produced from '3C-enriched methane confirmed that the methanol is produced from the oxidation of methane (and not some carbon-containing contam- inant)."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two distinct schemes: two-site and one-site. In the two-site scheme, the process typically includes linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Linear alkane transformations often involve the generation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes, while cyclic alkane transformations might lead to the formation of metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are largely determined by the formation and role of these intermediates. The one-site scheme refers to a more localized interaction where the transformation occurs at a single site on the catalyst surface, affecting the reaction pathway and product distribution differently than the two-site scheme. The detailed mechanisms, including the formation and role of intermediates, contribute significantly to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in different alkane conversions.

烷基化催化由硅负载钽氢化物引起的全面机制涉及两种不同的方案：双位点和单位点。在双位点方案中，过程通常包括线性和环烷烃的转换。线性烷烃转换往往涉及到关键中间体（如烯烃）的生成，而环烷烃转换可能导致形成金属环丁烷。这些中间体的形成及其作用对不同烷烃转换的反应选择性和催化剂性能起着决定性作用。单位点方案指的是在催化剂表面的单一位置发生的更局部的相互作用，这影响了反应路径和产物分布与双位点方案不同。详细机制，包括中间体的形成及其作用，对不同烷烃转换的反应选择性和催化剂性能有重大贡献。
