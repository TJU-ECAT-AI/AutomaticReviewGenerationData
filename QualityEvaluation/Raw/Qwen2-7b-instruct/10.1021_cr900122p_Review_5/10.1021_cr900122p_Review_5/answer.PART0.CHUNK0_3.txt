[1] "Detailed mechanistic studies using different types of Ta-based catalyst precursors (251, 252) and kinetic studies in flow reactors (299) showed that alkenes were primary products and that the key CC bond cleavage and formation steps corresponded to those involved in alkene metathesis, i.e. [2 + 2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion (vide supra)."
[2] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."
[3] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."
[4] "Note that Csp2 functionalization probably involves a different type of mechanism; one possibility is the Csp2-H activation on alkylidene or alkylidyne intermediates followed by an α-alkyl migration and subsequent CH bond activation and hydrogenolysis steps to form higher alkane homologues and regenerate the active species (vide infra, Section and Scheme 31c)."
[5] "Overall, detailed investigations on these types of catalysts are consistent with a one-site mechanism and show that deactivation of these systems is probably due to degrafting (vide infra, Section 3.1.3),"
[6] "Alkane metathesis can also be used to make highly branched alkanes. For instance, the alumina supported tungsten hydrides convert selectively and catalytically 2-methylpropane into 2,3-dimethylbutane (42%) and ethane (41%) (Scheme 29a)."
[7] "While silica or silicaalumina supported zirconium hydrides or alkyl do not display any catalytic activity in alkane metathesis under standard conditions (150 C and ca. 1 bar), they catalytically convert propane into higher and lower homologues under supercritical conditions (Table 4, entries 1718)."

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The two-site mechanism for alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves tantalum hydrides as key intermediates. This mechanism includes a first step of CH bond activation, leading to the formation of H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species. One site then generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, regenerating the tantalum hydrides, while the other site evolves towards a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer.

The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. In this mechanism, the formation and conversion of alkene intermediates occur within the coordination sphere of the metal center.

Cyclic alkane transformations involve the formation of lower cyclic homologues through the activation of CH bonds, followed by γ-H activation to yield a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, including hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, leading to both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues.

Key intermediates in the alkane metathesis process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity in higher homologues, characterized by the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is attributed to alkene metathesis being the key homologation process. The catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as reaction conditions, the type of catalyst precursor, and the stability of the catalyst.

The deactivation of these systems is likely due to degrafting, which prevents regeneration under hydrogen exposure. The use of alumina-supported tungsten hydrides can enable the selective conversion of 2-methylpropane into 2,3-dimethylbutane and ethane. Under supercritical conditions, silica or silicaalumina-supported zirconium hydrides or alkyls exhibit catalytic activity in alkane metathesis, converting propane into higher and lower homologues.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制，讨论双位点和单位点方案，线性和环状烷烃转换过程中的过程，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其在各种烷烃转化中对反应选择性和催化剂性能的贡献。

双位点机制中，由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合涉及钽氢化物作为关键中间体。这一机制包括第一步的CH键激活，导致形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。一个站点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，从而再生钽氢化物；另一个站点则通过α-H转移进化为Ta-烷基二烯烃。

单位点机制基于钽烷基二烯烃中间体，这些中间体可以原位从二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物或新戊基新戊基二烯烃表面复合物形成。在这种机制中，在金属中心的配位球内形成了烯烃中间体的形成和转换。

环烷烃转换涉及通过激活CH键来形成较低的环烷烃同系物，随后通过γ-H激活产生金属环丁烷中间体。该中间体可以经历环重排和后续步骤，包括氢解、氢化和重组，导致形成较低的环状和非环状烷烃同系物。

烷烃裂合过程的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。主要通过烷烃裂合过程来解释较高同系物的选择性，表现为n  1和n + 1线性同系物的存在。催化剂性能在各种烷烃转化中的影响因素包括反应条件、催化剂前体的类型以及催化剂的稳定性。

这些系统的失活可能是由于脱附导致的，这阻止了在氢暴露下的再生。使用氧化铝支持的钨氢化物可以实现2-甲基丙烷向2,3-二甲基丁烷和乙烷的有选择性的转换。在超临界条件下，二氧化硅或二氧化硅氧化铝支持的锆氢化物或烷基表现出烷烃裂合的催化活性，将丙烷转化为更高和更低的同系物。
