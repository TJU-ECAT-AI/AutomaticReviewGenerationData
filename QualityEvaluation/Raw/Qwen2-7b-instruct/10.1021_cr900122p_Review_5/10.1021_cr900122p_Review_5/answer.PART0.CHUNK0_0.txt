[1] "In 1997, Vidal et al. found that acyclic alkanes (CnH2n+2) are catalytically transformed into their lower and higher homologues (CniH2(ni)+2 and Cn+iH2(n+i)+2) in the absence of hydrogen by the silica supported tantalum hydrides (Scheme 27ab)."
[2] "Detailed mechanistic studies using different types of Ta-based catalyst precursors (251, 252) and kinetic studies in flow reactors (299) showed that alkenes were primary products and that the key CC bond cleavage and formation steps corresponded to those involved in alkene metathesis, i.e. [2 + 2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion (vide supra)."
[3] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."
[4] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."
[5] "Overall, detailed investigations on these types of catalysts are consistent with a one-site mechanism and show that deactivation of these systems is probably due to degrafting (vide infra, Section 3.1.3)."
[6] "Alkane metathesis can also be used to make highly branched alkanes. For instance, the alumina supported tungsten hydrides convert selectively and catalytically 2-methylpropane into 2,3-dimethylbutane (42%) and ethane (41%) (Scheme 29a)."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides encompasses both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides act as key intermediates. The process begins with CH bond activation, forming H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species. One site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site evolves towards a Ta-alkylidene hydride through an α-H transfer. Meanwhile, the one-site mechanism relies on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates formed in situ from silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. Both mechanisms involve alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as crucial intermediates. The selectivity in higher homologues is attributed to alkene metathesis being the key homologation process, with primarily n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues produced. The catalysts' performance and selectivity vary across different types, with alumina or silicaalumina supported tungsten hydrides considered the current best reported catalysts.

硅基支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃互变异构的全面机制包括双站点和单站点方案。在双站点机制中，钽氢化物充当关键中间体。过程从CH键活化开始，形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。一个站点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，再生钽氢化物。另一个站点则通过α-H转移进化为Ta-烷基烯烃氢化物。同时，单站点机制依赖于直接从硅基支持的钽氢化物或二异丙基二异丙烯基钽表面复合物中原位形成的钽烷基烷基烯烃中间体。两种机制都涉及烯烃互变异构和烷基烯烃氢化物作为关键中间体。较高同系物的选择性归因于烯烃互变异构是主要同系化过程，主要产生n  1和n + 1线性同系物。催化剂的性能和选择性在不同类型之间有所不同，以氧化铝或硅铝氧化的钨氢化物被认为是目前报道的最佳催化剂。
