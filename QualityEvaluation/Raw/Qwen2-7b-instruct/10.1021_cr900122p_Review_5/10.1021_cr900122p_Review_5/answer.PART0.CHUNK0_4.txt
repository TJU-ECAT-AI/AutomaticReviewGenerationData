[1] "Acyclic alkanes (CnH2n+2) are catalytically transformed into their lower and higher homologues (CniH2(ni)+2 and Cn+iH2(n+i)+2) in the absence of hydrogen by the silica supported tantalum hydrides (Scheme 27ab)."
[2] "Detailed mechanistic studies using different types of Ta-based catalyst precursors (251, 252) and kinetic studies in flow reactors (299) showed that alkenes were primary products and that the key CC bond cleavage and formation steps corresponded to those involved in alkene metathesis, i.e. [2 + 2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion (vide supra)."
[3] "The two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c)."
[4] "After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."
[5] "The alkene, generated by the first site, then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, which leads to a different alkene and alkylidene species."
[6] "Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps provide a way to liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues."
[7] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."
[8] "While the silica supported system is inactive, probably because of a fast decomposition, the silicaalumina and alumina supported systems display activities comparable to those of the corresponding tantalum alkyl alkylidene systems (entries 810) and a greater selectivity for n  1 and n + 1 homologues (entries 67)."
[9] "Alkane metathesis can also be used to make highly branched alkanes. For instance, the alumina supported tungsten hydrides convert selectively and catalytically 2-methylpropane into 2,3-dimethylbutane (42%) and ethane (41%) (Scheme 29a)."
[10] "Despite the transfer of two carbons in place of one, as usually observed previously, this selectively can be explained using the same mechanism and the same alkylidene hydride intermediates (Scheme 29b)."

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides serve as key intermediates. After a first CH bond activation forms H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer. The alkene, generated by the first site, undergoes a homologation process on the second site, leading to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps enable the liberation of lower and higher alkane homologues. In the one-site mechanism, tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates are formed in situ from silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. These intermediates facilitate the formation of alkenes and the subsequent homologation process. The catalysts display similar activities and selectivities to the original silica supported tantalum hydrides, with the silicaalumina and alumina supported tungsten hydrides showing higher selectivities for n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues. Alkane metathesis can also produce highly branched alkanes, as demonstrated by the conversion of 2-methylpropane into 2,3-dimethylbutane and ethane using alumina supported tungsten hydrides. This selective conversion is explained by the same mechanism and alkylidene hydride intermediates involved in the metathesis process.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制，讨论两个站点和一个站点方案，线性和环烷烃转换过程涉及的关键步骤，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和作用，以及这些因素如何在各种烷烃转化中贡献反应选择性和催化剂性能。

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合机制包括两个站点和一个站点方案。在双站点机制中，钽氢化物充当关键中间体。在首次CH键活化后形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种后，一个站点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，从而再生钽氢化物；另一个站点通过α-H转移进化为Ta-烷基二烯氢化物。由第一个站点生成的烯烃在第二个站点上经历同系化过程，导致不同的烯烃和烷基二烯物种。随后的氢化和氢解步骤使较低和较高烷基同系物得以释放。在一站点机制中，钽烷基二烯氢化物中间体从二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物或二戊基二烯钽表面复合物原位形成。这些中间体促进了烯烃的形成和后续同系化过程。这些催化剂显示与原始二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物相似的活性和选择性，其中二氧化硅铝酸盐和支持的钨氢化物显示出更高选择性n  1和n + 1线性同系物。烷烃裂合也可以产生高度分支的烷烃，如使用二氧化硅支持的钨氢化物将2-甲基丙烷转化为2,3-二甲基丁烷和乙烷。这种选择性的转化可以通过相同的机制和涉及裂合过程的烷基二烯中间体来解释。
