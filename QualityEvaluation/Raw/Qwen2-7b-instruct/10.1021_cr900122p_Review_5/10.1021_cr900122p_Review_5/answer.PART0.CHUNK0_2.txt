Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides comprises two-site and one-site schemes. The two-site mechanism involves tantalum hydrides as key intermediates. After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer. The alkene, generated by the first site, then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, leading to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps provide a way to liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues. The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. The formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center. Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate.

These factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e., the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process. The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. The formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center. Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate.

Key intermediates in the process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The formation of alkenes through β-H transfer and the evolution of Ta-alkylidene hydrides via α-H transfer play crucial roles in the two-site mechanism. Metallacyclobutanes are formed during the reaction, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, such as hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues. The selectivity of the catalyst towards producing higher homologues is attributed to the efficient homologation process driven by alkene metathesis, ensuring the formation of predominantly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues.

分析硅负载钽氢化物催化烷烃均裂的全面机制，讨论双位点和单位点方案，线性和环烷烃转换过程中的关键步骤，以及关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和作用，这些因素如何共同促进各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能。

机制包括双位点和单位点方案。双位点机制涉及钽氢化物作为关键中间体。在首次CH键活化后，一个位点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，从而再生钽氢化物。另一个位点通过α-H转移演化为Ta-烷基烯烃。由第一个位点生成的烯烃在第二个位点上经历同位素过程。随后的氢化和氢解步骤提供了一种释放较低和较高烷烃同系物的方法。单位点机制基于钽烷基烷基烯烃中间体，在原硅负载钽氢化物或二正戊基二烯基钽表面复合物中原位形成。烯烃中间体的形成和转换发生在金属中心的配位球内。这两种机制都基于烯烃均裂和烷基烯烃作为关键中间体。

这些因素共同促进了各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能。更高同系物选择性的主要存在（即n  1和n + 1线性同系物），与烯烃均裂作为关键同位素过程一致。单位点机制基于钽烷基烷基烯烃中间体，可在原硅负载钽氢化物或二正戊基二烯基钽表面复合物中原位形成。烯烃中间体的形成和转换发生在金属中心的配位球内。这两种机制都基于烯烃均裂和烷基烯烃作为关键中间体。

在过程中涉及的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。通过β-H转移形成烯烃和α-H转移演化为Ta-烷基烯烃在双位点机制中起着关键作用。在反应过程中形成金属环丁烷，可以进行环重排和其他步骤，如氢解、氢化和重组，以产生较低环状和无环烷烃同系物。催化剂对生产较高同系物的选择性归因于由烯烃均裂驱动的高效同位素过程，确保主要形成n  1和n + 1线性同系物。
