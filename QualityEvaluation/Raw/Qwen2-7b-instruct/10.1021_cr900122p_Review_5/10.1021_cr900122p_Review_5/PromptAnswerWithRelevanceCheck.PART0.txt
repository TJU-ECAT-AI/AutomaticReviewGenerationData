[1] "In 1997, Vidal et al. found that acyclic alkanes (CnH2n+2) are catalytically transformed into their lower and higher homologues (CniH2(ni)+2 and Cn+iH2(n+i)+2) in the absence of hydrogen by the silica supported tantalum hydrides (Scheme 27ab)."
[2] "Detailed mechanistic studies using different types of Ta-based catalyst precursors (251, 252) and kinetic studies in flow reactors (299) showed that alkenes were primary products and that the key CC bond cleavage and formation steps corresponded to those involved in alkene metathesis, i.e. [2 + 2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion (vide supra)."
[3] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."
[4] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."
[5] "Overall, detailed investigations on these types of catalysts are consistent with a one-site mechanism and show that deactivation of these systems is probably due to degrafting (vide infra, Section 3.1.3)."
[6] "Alkane metathesis can also be used to make highly branched alkanes. For instance, the alumina supported tungsten hydrides convert selectively and catalytically 2-methylpropane into 2,3-dimethylbutane (42%) and ethane (41%) (Scheme 29a)."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides encompasses both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides act as key intermediates. The process begins with CH bond activation, forming H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species. One site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site evolves towards a Ta-alkylidene hydride through an α-H transfer. Meanwhile, the one-site mechanism relies on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates formed in situ from silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. Both mechanisms involve alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as crucial intermediates. The selectivity in higher homologues is attributed to alkene metathesis being the key homologation process, with primarily n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues produced. The catalysts' performance and selectivity vary across different types, with alumina or silicaalumina supported tungsten hydrides considered the current best reported catalysts.

硅基支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃互变异构的全面机制包括双站点和单站点方案。在双站点机制中，钽氢化物充当关键中间体。过程从CH键活化开始，形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。一个站点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，再生钽氢化物。另一个站点则通过α-H转移进化为Ta-烷基烯烃氢化物。同时，单站点机制依赖于直接从硅基支持的钽氢化物或二异丙基二异丙烯基钽表面复合物中原位形成的钽烷基烷基烯烃中间体。两种机制都涉及烯烃互变异构和烷基烯烃氢化物作为关键中间体。较高同系物的选择性归因于烯烃互变异构是主要同系化过程，主要产生n  1和n + 1线性同系物。催化剂的性能和选择性在不同类型之间有所不同，以氧化铝或硅铝氧化的钨氢化物被认为是目前报道的最佳催化剂。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides comprises two-site and one-site schemes. The two-site mechanism involves tantalum hydrides as key intermediates. After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer. The alkene, generated by the first site, then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, leading to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps provide a way to liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues. The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. The formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center. Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate.

These factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e., the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process. The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. The formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center. Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate.

Key intermediates in the process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The formation of alkenes through β-H transfer and the evolution of Ta-alkylidene hydrides via α-H transfer play crucial roles in the two-site mechanism. Metallacyclobutanes are formed during the reaction, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, such as hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues. The selectivity of the catalyst towards producing higher homologues is attributed to the efficient homologation process driven by alkene metathesis, ensuring the formation of predominantly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues.

分析硅负载钽氢化物催化烷烃均裂的全面机制，讨论双位点和单位点方案，线性和环烷烃转换过程中的关键步骤，以及关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和作用，这些因素如何共同促进各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能。

机制包括双位点和单位点方案。双位点机制涉及钽氢化物作为关键中间体。在首次CH键活化后，一个位点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，从而再生钽氢化物。另一个位点通过α-H转移演化为Ta-烷基烯烃。由第一个位点生成的烯烃在第二个位点上经历同位素过程。随后的氢化和氢解步骤提供了一种释放较低和较高烷烃同系物的方法。单位点机制基于钽烷基烷基烯烃中间体，在原硅负载钽氢化物或二正戊基二烯基钽表面复合物中原位形成。烯烃中间体的形成和转换发生在金属中心的配位球内。这两种机制都基于烯烃均裂和烷基烯烃作为关键中间体。

这些因素共同促进了各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能。更高同系物选择性的主要存在（即n  1和n + 1线性同系物），与烯烃均裂作为关键同位素过程一致。单位点机制基于钽烷基烷基烯烃中间体，可在原硅负载钽氢化物或二正戊基二烯基钽表面复合物中原位形成。烯烃中间体的形成和转换发生在金属中心的配位球内。这两种机制都基于烯烃均裂和烷基烯烃作为关键中间体。

在过程中涉及的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。通过β-H转移形成烯烃和α-H转移演化为Ta-烷基烯烃在双位点机制中起着关键作用。在反应过程中形成金属环丁烷，可以进行环重排和其他步骤，如氢解、氢化和重组，以产生较低环状和无环烷烃同系物。催化剂对生产较高同系物的选择性归因于由烯烃均裂驱动的高效同位素过程，确保主要形成n  1和n + 1线性同系物。

The two-site mechanism for alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves tantalum hydrides as key intermediates. This mechanism includes a first step of CH bond activation, leading to the formation of H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species. One site then generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, regenerating the tantalum hydrides, while the other site evolves towards a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer.

The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. In this mechanism, the formation and conversion of alkene intermediates occur within the coordination sphere of the metal center.

Cyclic alkane transformations involve the formation of lower cyclic homologues through the activation of CH bonds, followed by γ-H activation to yield a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, including hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, leading to both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues.

Key intermediates in the alkane metathesis process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity in higher homologues, characterized by the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is attributed to alkene metathesis being the key homologation process. The catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as reaction conditions, the type of catalyst precursor, and the stability of the catalyst.

The deactivation of these systems is likely due to degrafting, which prevents regeneration under hydrogen exposure. The use of alumina-supported tungsten hydrides can enable the selective conversion of 2-methylpropane into 2,3-dimethylbutane and ethane. Under supercritical conditions, silica or silicaalumina-supported zirconium hydrides or alkyls exhibit catalytic activity in alkane metathesis, converting propane into higher and lower homologues.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制，讨论双位点和单位点方案，线性和环状烷烃转换过程中的过程，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其在各种烷烃转化中对反应选择性和催化剂性能的贡献。

双位点机制中，由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合涉及钽氢化物作为关键中间体。这一机制包括第一步的CH键激活，导致形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。一个站点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，从而再生钽氢化物；另一个站点则通过α-H转移进化为Ta-烷基二烯烃。

单位点机制基于钽烷基二烯烃中间体，这些中间体可以原位从二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物或新戊基新戊基二烯烃表面复合物形成。在这种机制中，在金属中心的配位球内形成了烯烃中间体的形成和转换。

环烷烃转换涉及通过激活CH键来形成较低的环烷烃同系物，随后通过γ-H激活产生金属环丁烷中间体。该中间体可以经历环重排和后续步骤，包括氢解、氢化和重组，导致形成较低的环状和非环状烷烃同系物。

烷烃裂合过程的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。主要通过烷烃裂合过程来解释较高同系物的选择性，表现为n  1和n + 1线性同系物的存在。催化剂性能在各种烷烃转化中的影响因素包括反应条件、催化剂前体的类型以及催化剂的稳定性。

这些系统的失活可能是由于脱附导致的，这阻止了在氢暴露下的再生。使用氧化铝支持的钨氢化物可以实现2-甲基丙烷向2,3-二甲基丁烷和乙烷的有选择性的转换。在超临界条件下，二氧化硅或二氧化硅氧化铝支持的锆氢化物或烷基表现出烷烃裂合的催化活性，将丙烷转化为更高和更低的同系物。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides serve as key intermediates. After a first CH bond activation forms H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer. The alkene, generated by the first site, undergoes a homologation process on the second site, leading to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps enable the liberation of lower and higher alkane homologues. In the one-site mechanism, tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates are formed in situ from silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. These intermediates facilitate the formation of alkenes and the subsequent homologation process. The catalysts display similar activities and selectivities to the original silica supported tantalum hydrides, with the silicaalumina and alumina supported tungsten hydrides showing higher selectivities for n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues. Alkane metathesis can also produce highly branched alkanes, as demonstrated by the conversion of 2-methylpropane into 2,3-dimethylbutane and ethane using alumina supported tungsten hydrides. This selective conversion is explained by the same mechanism and alkylidene hydride intermediates involved in the metathesis process.
