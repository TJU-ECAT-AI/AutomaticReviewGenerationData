[1] "The computations on the activation of alkane CH bonds have attempted to describe the accepted mechanism and sought mostly pathways based on hydron transfer."
[2] "Pathway b (defined below) for chemisorption on 1 was also examined by MP2/6-31G**, to check the agreement between the two methods (as done in previous work)."
[3] "Our goal was to explore the existence of a reaction pathway, rather than to determine accurately the relative energies of reactants, intermediates, and transition structures."
[4] "The reactivity order prim > sec and the prediction that hydrogen exchange [reverse of eqn. (1)] is faster than further reaction of the olefin (e.g. on acid sites) agrees with the experiment."
[5] "The described mechanism is relevant for the hydrogen exchange11,19 and alkene hydrogenation/alkane dehydrogenation.20 These reactions have been described as catalyzed by Brnsted acid centers,with carbocations as intermediates or transition structures."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The process includes the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkanes, leading to the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These intermediates play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The mechanism highlights the importance of the catalyst's structure and the specific interactions between the alkane molecules and the catalyst surface, contributing to the efficient conversion of alkanes into desired products.
