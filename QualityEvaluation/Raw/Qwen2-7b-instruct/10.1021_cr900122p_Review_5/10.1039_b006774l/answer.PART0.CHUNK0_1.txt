[1] "Weak complexes of propane with 1 (3) and 2 (4) were located and two types of chemisorption products were identified, with CAl bond (5 and 6, respectively) and with CO bond (7 and 8,respectively), shown in eqns. (1) and (2)."
[2] "The Oalkyl complexes were less stable than the Alalkyl complexes by 57 kcal mol−1."
[3] "For the aluminiumalkyl pathway,eqn. (1), a primary CH bond (a) is more reactive than a secondary CH bond (b)."
[4] "The described mechanism is relevant for the hydrogen exchange11,19 and alkene hydrogenation/alkane dehydrogenation.20"
[5] "An increase in reactivity for broken lattices of zeolites or for extraframework aluminium species in steamed zeolites is predicted."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two-site and one-site schemes, with processes including linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The mechanism shows that the primary CH bond is more reactive than the secondary CH bond. The process is relevant for hydrogen exchange, alkene hydrogenation, and alkane dehydrogenation. Predicted increases in reactivity occur for broken lattices of zeolites or for extraframework aluminium species in steamed zeolites.
