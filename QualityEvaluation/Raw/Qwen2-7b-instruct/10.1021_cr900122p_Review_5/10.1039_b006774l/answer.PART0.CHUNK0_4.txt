[1] "Weak complexes of propane with 1 (3) and 2 (4) were located and two types of chemisorption products were identified, with CAl bond (5 and 6, respectively) and with CO bond (7 and 8,respectively), shown in eqns. (1) and (2)."
[2] "The Oalkyl complexes were less stable than the Alalkyl complexes by 57 kcal mol−1."
[3] "For the aluminiumalkyl pathway,eqn. (1), a primary CH bond (a) is more reactive than a secondary CH bond (b)."
[4] "The transition structure for the chemisorption step on the aluminumalkyl pathway,14 shown in Fig. 1 (left)17 for the reaction 1 ? 5a, was similar to that for hydrogen chemisorp- tion. The imaginary frequency was the bending of the AlH bond toward O (migration of hydrogen from Al to O)."
[5] "The reactivity order prim > sec and the prediction that hydrogen exchange [reverse of eqn. (1)] is faster than further reaction of the olefin (e.g. on acid sites) agrees with the experiment."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes, with processes including linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play crucial roles. The formation and role of these intermediates contribute significantly to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. Specifically, the chemisorption of propane occurs via aluminium insertion into a CH bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. The alternative pathway involving alkyloxygen interaction has a much higher energy barrier. Weak complexes of propane with aluminium clusters lead to two types of chemisorption products, characterized by C-Al or C-O bonds. The O-alkyl complexes are less stable than the Al-alkyl complexes by 57 kcal mol−1. The primary CH bond is more reactive than the secondary CH bond in the aluminium alkyl pathway. The transition structure for chemisorption on the aluminium alkyl pathway is similar to that for hydrogen chemisorption, featuring the bending of the Al-H bond towards O, indicating hydrogen migration from Al to O. The reactivity order is primary > secondary, and the prediction that hydrogen exchange is faster than further reaction of the olefin aligns with experimental findings.
