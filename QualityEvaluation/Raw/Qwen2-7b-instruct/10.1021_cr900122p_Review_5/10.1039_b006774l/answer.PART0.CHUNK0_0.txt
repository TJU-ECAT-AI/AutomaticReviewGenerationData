[2] "Electron-correlated DFT calculations with a large basis set show that propane adds to coordinatively unsaturated aluminium, as in the clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0, 1), by aluminium insertion into a CH bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom and predict correctly experimental observations; the alternative pathway involving alkyloxygen interaction has a much higher energy barrier and does not predict correctly the experimental results."
[3] "Following the progress of superacid chemistry, the reactions of hydrocarbons on aluminosilicates, including zeolites, have been interpreted as involving the activation by hydron transfer to form carbocations as intermediates or transition structures."
[4] "Standard ab initio (MP2) and DFT (B3LYP) geometry optimizations with large basis sets and search of the reaction coordinate without the imposition of a pathway have shown, however, that hydrogen chemisorption occurs through the interaction of H2 with the aluminium (metal ion catalysis) until both hydrogen atoms are bonded to Al, after which one hydrogen migrates to oxygen."

The document discusses the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by aluminium hydroxide clusters, focusing on the chemisorption and dehydrogenation of alkanes. The process involves aluminium insertion into a CH bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom, which is energetically favorable compared to alternative pathways involving alkyloxygen interaction. This mechanism predicts correctly experimental observations and contrasts with the interpretation of reactions involving superacid chemistry, where activation typically leads to the formation of carbocations as intermediates. The study highlights the role of metal ion catalysis in the activation of alkane CH bonds, demonstrating that hydrogen chemisorption occurs through interaction with aluminium, resulting in the bonding of both hydrogen atoms to aluminium before one migrates to oxygen. The document also examines different reaction pathways and their energetic barriers, providing insights into the reactivity of primary and secondary CH bonds, as well as the relative energies of intermediates, products, and transition structures in the context of alkane metathesis catalyzed by aluminium hydroxide clusters.

本文讨论了由铝羟基簇催化下烷烃的互变异构机制的全面机制，重点是烷烃的吸附和脱氢。该过程涉及铝插入到CH键中，随后氢迁移到氧原子上，与涉及醇氧相互作用的替代途径相比，此过程的能量更为有利。该机制能够正确预测实验观察结果，并与涉及超酸化学的反应解释形成对比，在后者中，活性通常导致形成碳正离子作为中间体。研究表明，氢吸附通过与铝的相互作用发生，导致两个氢原子均与铝结合，之后一个氢迁移到氧原子上，这是通过金属离子催化作用激活烷烃CH键的结果。研究还探讨了不同反应路径及其能量壁垒，提供了关于烷烃互变异构催化过程中铝羟基簇活性位点的反应性、主要与次级CH键的比较以及中间体、产物和过渡态相对能量的见解。
