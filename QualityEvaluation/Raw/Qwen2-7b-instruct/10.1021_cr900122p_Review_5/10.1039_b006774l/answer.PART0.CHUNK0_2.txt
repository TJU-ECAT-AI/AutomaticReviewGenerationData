[1] "Our goal was to explore the existence of a reaction pathway, rather than to determine accurately the relative energies of reactants, intermediates, and transition structures."
[2] "For the aluminiumalkyl pathway,eqn. (1), a primary CH bond (a) is more reactive than a secondary CH bond (b)."
[3] "Only option b was studied for the O alkyl pathway [eqn. (2)], because the alkyl group acquired a positive charge."
[4] "In the second step of the reaction on 2, the cleavage of an AlO bond is easier than the elimination of propene."
[5] "The transition structure for the chemisorption step on the aluminumalkyl pathway,14 shown in Fig. 1 (left)17 for the reaction 1 ? 5a, was similar to that for hydrogen chemisorp- tion."
[6] "The described mechanism is relevant for the hydrogen exchange11,19 and alkene hydrogenation/alkane dehydrogenation.20"

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key aspects. Two-site and one-site schemes play significant roles in the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkanes. The process involves the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. The mechanisms contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are closely tied to the precise formation and function of these intermediates. The study highlights the importance of understanding the detailed pathways and energetics involved in these transformations for optimizing catalyst design and performance.
