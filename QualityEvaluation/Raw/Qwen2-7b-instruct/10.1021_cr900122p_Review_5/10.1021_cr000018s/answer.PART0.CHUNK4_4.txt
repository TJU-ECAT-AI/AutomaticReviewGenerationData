Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. In the process, linear alkane transformations primarily occur through the formation of alkenes, followed by a cross-metathesis reaction. Cyclic alkane transformations, on the other hand, involve the creation of metallacyclobutanes, which subsequently undergo rearrangement to produce cycloalkanes. Key intermediates in this mechanism are alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The performance and selectivity of the catalyst are determined by factors such as the type of support material, the concentration of the metal hydride, and the specific reaction conditions used.
