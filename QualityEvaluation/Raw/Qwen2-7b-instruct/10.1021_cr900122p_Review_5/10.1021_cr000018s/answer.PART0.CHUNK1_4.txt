[1] "The systems studied for photochemical CO2 reduction studies can be divided into several groups: Ru(bpy)32+ both as a photosensitizer and a catalyst;171 Ru(bpy)3+ as a photosensitizer and another metal complex as a catalyst;172 ReX(CO)3(bpy) or a similar complex as a photosensitizer;172a,173 Ru(bpy)32+ and Ru(bpy)32+-type complexes as photosensitizers in microheterogeneous systems;174 metalloporphyrins both as a photosensitizers and catalysts;175 and organic photosensitizers and transition-metal complexes as catalysts.17"

[2] "Typical turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- are between 1 and 10 h-1, and turnover numbers are generally 100 or less."

[3] "In the most efficient systems, the total quantum yield for all reduced products reaches 40%.177"

[4] "In the most efficient systems, the total quantum yield for all reduced products reaches 40%.177"

[5] "Under photochemical conditions, the turnover number and the turnover frequency are dependent on irradiation wavelength, light intensity, irradiation time, and catalyst concentration, and they have not been optimized in most of the photochemical experiments described."

[6] "In some cases with Ru or Os colloids, CH4 is produced with a low quantum yield.164"

[7] "Semiconductor electrodes or particles can replace the aforementioned molecular sensitizers to achieve light harvesting."

[8] "These systems may use enzymes or catalysts to promote electron transfer from the semiconductorsolution interface to CO2 or reduce CO2 directly."

[9] "In reactions involving gaseous reactants in liquid phases, the use of supercritical CO2 with its ability to dissolve large amounts of most gases could allow kinetic control of reactions as opposed to limiting of reaction rates by the transport of the gaseous reactant across the gasliquid interface."

[10] "The cleavage of CO bonds as CO2 is reduced is also not well understood."

[11] "Factors controlling regio- and stereoselectivity of metal-centered CO2 transformations are also ill-defined."
