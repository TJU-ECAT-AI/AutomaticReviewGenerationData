[1] "The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides has been extensively studied."

[2] "Two main schemes have been proposed: a two-site mechanism and a one-site mechanism."

[3] "In the two-site mechanism, the active site involves the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate."

[4] "In the one-site mechanism, the active site leads to the formation of an alkene intermediate."

[5] "Linear alkane transformations typically proceed through the formation of a short-lived metallacyclobutane intermediate."

[6] "Cyclic alkane transformations often involve the creation of a stable alkene intermediate."

[7] "The role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes is crucial for the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process."

[8] "Catalyst performance is influenced by factors such as the support material, the nature of the metal, and the structure of the catalyst."

[9] "The selectivity of the alkane metathesis reaction is determined by the stability of different intermediates and the ease of transition between them."

[10] "Understanding the detailed mechanisms of these reactions provides insights into optimizing catalyst design for improved performance."
