Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides reveals that both two-site and one-site schemes play crucial roles. This process enables the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes, leading to the creation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. The factors influencing reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are closely tied to the structure of the silica support and the properties of the tantalum hydride catalyst.
