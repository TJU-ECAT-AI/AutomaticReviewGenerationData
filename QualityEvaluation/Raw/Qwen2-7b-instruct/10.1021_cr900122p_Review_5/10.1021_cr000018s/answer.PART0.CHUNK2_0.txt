Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, we find that the process encompasses both two-site and one-site schemes. The catalyst enables the rearrangement of alkyl groups, leading to the formation of alkenes as key intermediates. Metallacyclobutanes also play significant roles in the reaction pathways. This mechanism contributes to the high activity and stability of silica-supported tantalum hydrides in alkane conversions, making them effective catalysts for various alkane transformations.
