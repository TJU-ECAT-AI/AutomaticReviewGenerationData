Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides reveals a two-site scheme where the catalyst enables the breaking and reformation of carbon-carbon bonds. In the presence of the catalyst, the alkane molecule undergoes a series of reactions leading to the rearrangement of its structure. For linear alkane conversion, the process typically begins with the formation of an alkene intermediate. In the case of cyclic alkane transformations, a metallacyclobutane intermediate plays a crucial role. The catalyst's performance is influenced by factors such as its surface area, acidity, and the type of support material used. The selectivity of the alkane metathesis reaction depends on the balance between competing pathways and the stability of intermediates. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, are central to achieving high conversion rates and product yields. The catalyst's ability to control the reaction pathway and stabilize specific intermediates determines the overall efficiency of the alkane conversion. Silica-supported tantalum hydrides offer unique properties that enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity in alkane metathesis.
