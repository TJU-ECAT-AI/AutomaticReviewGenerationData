Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, we find that both two-site and one-site schemes play crucial roles. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes are formed during the transformation process. These catalysts enable the conversion of both linear and cyclic alkanes efficiently. The formation and function of these intermediates are essential in determining the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
