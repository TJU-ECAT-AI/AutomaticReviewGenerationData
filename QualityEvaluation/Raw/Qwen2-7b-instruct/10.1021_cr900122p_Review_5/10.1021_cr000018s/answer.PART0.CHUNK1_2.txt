[1] "The systems studied for photochemical CO2 reduction studies can be divided into several groups: Ru(bpy)32+ both as a photosensitizer and a catalyst;171 Ru(bpy)3+ as a photosensitizer and another metal complex as a catalyst;172 ReX(CO)3(bpy) or a similar complex as a photosensitizer;172a,173 Ru(bpy)32+ and Ru(bpy)32+-type complexes as photosensitizers in microheterogeneous systems;174 metalloporphyrins both as a photosensitizers and catalysts;175 and organic photosensitizers and transition-metal complexes as catalysts.17"

[2] "The aforementioned molecular sensitizers can be replaced with semiconductor electrodes or particles to achieve light harvesting. These systems may use enzymes or catalysts to promote electron transfer from the semiconductorsolution interface to CO2 or reduce CO2 directly.178,179 Typically these reductions require a potential bias in addition to solar energy input to achieve CO2 reduction and electrode corrosion is a major concern."

[3] "The cleavage of CO bonds as CO2 is reduced is also not well understood. During CO2 electrochemical reduction to CO mediated by Pd catalysts, a vacant coordination site facilitates the CO bond cleavage."

[4] "The aforementioned molecular sensitizers can be replaced with semiconductor electrodes or particles to achieve light harvesting. These systems may use enzymes or catalysts to promote electron transfer from the semiconductorsolution interface to CO2 or reduce CO2 directly."

[5] "For fuels production, the availability of electrical energy or a source of H2 is critical. Electricity can be produced from either nuclear or renewable energy sources, and the electrolysis of water using this electrical energy could produce H2 from a nonfossil source."
