[1] "The systems studied for photochemical CO2 reduction studies can be divided into several groups: Ru(bpy)32+ both as a photosensitizer and a catalyst;171 Ru(bpy)32+ as a photosensitizer and another metal complex as a catalyst;172 ReX(CO)3(bpy) or a similar complex as a photosensitizer;172a,173 Ru(bpy)32+ and Ru(bpy)32+-type complexes as photosensitizers in microheterogeneous systems;174 metalloporphyrins both as a photosensitizers and catalysts;175 and organic photosensitizers and transition-metal complexes as catalysts.17"
[2] "The aforementioned molecular sensitizers can be replaced with semiconductor electrodes or particles to achieve light harvesting."
[3] "Typical turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- are between 1 and 10 h-1, and turnover numbers are generally 100 or less."

[5] "Therefore, the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the solution is low (e.g., 0.28 M in CH3CN, 0.03 M in water)."
[6] "Under photochemical conditions, the turnover number and the turnover frequency are dependent on irradiation wavelength, light intensity, irradiation time, and catalyst concentration, and they have not been optimized in most of the photochemical experiments described."

The systems for studying photochemical CO2 reduction can be categorized into several groups, including Ru(bpy)32+ as both a photosensitizer and catalyst, Ru(bpy)32+ as a photosensitizer with another metal complex as a catalyst, ReX(CO)3(bpy) or similar complex as a photosensitizer, Ru(bpy)32+ and Ru(bpy)32+-type complexes as photosensitizers in microheterogeneous systems, metalloporphyrins as photosensitizers and catalysts, and organic photosensitizers and transition-metal complexes as catalysts. Semiconductor electrodes or particles can replace molecular sensitizers for light harvesting. Typical turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- are around 1 to 10 h-1, with turnover numbers generally 100 or less. In the most efficient systems, the total quantum yield for all reduced products can reach 40%. The concentration of dissolved CO2 in the solution is usually low, for example, 0.28 M in CH3CN and 0.03 M in water. Turnover numbers and frequencies are affected by irradiation wavelength, light intensity, irradiation time, and catalyst concentration, but optimization has not been achieved in many experiments.

研究光化学CO2还原的系统可以分为几类，包括Ru(bpy)32+作为光敏化剂和催化剂，Ru(bpy)32+作为光敏化剂与另一种金属复合物作为催化剂，ReX(CO)3(bpy)或类似复合物作为光敏化剂，Ru(bpy)32+和Ru(bpy)32+-型复合物作为微异质系统的光敏化剂，金属卟啉化合物作为光敏化剂和催化剂，以及有机光敏化剂和过渡金属复合物作为催化剂。半导体电极或颗粒可以替代分子敏感剂进行光能收集。CO或HCOO-的典型周转频率约为1到10 h-1，周转数通常为100或更少。在最有效的系统中，所有还原产物的总量子产率可达到40%。溶液中溶解的CO2浓度通常很低，例如，在CH3CN中为0.28 M，在水中为0.03 M。周转数和频率受照射波长、光照强度、照射时间以及催化剂浓度的影响，但在许多实验中并未实现优化。半导体可以替代分子敏感剂进行光能收集。
