The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the process of linear and cyclic alkane transformations, key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes are formed. These factors significantly contribute to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The mechanism includes the activation of alkane substrates by the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst, followed by the transfer of alkyl groups between different carbon centers to form new alkene products. The selectivity towards linear or cyclic products depends on the specific conditions and the structure of the catalyst. The catalyst performance is influenced by factors such as the surface area, acidity, and stability of the silica support, as well as the electronic properties of the tantalum center. The catalyst facilitates the breaking and forming of C-C bonds through a concerted mechanism, leading to efficient alkane metathesis reactions.
