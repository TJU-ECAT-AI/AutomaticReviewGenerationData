The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes, processes for linear and cyclic alkane transformations, and the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.
