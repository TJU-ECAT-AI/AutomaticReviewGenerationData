Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides reveals that two primary sites of activity are involved: the two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, the catalyst enables the exchange of alkyl groups between adjacent carbon atoms, whereas in the one-site scheme, it facilitates the transfer of an alkyl group from one carbon atom to another within the same molecule. Linear alkane transformations typically involve the rearrangement of alkyl groups along the chain, while cyclic alkane transformations involve the creation and breaking of alkyl-carbon bonds to form rings. Key intermediates in these reactions include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which are formed during the initial steps of the reaction and play a crucial role in stabilizing the transition states. Understanding the formation and role of these intermediates is essential for comprehending the reaction pathways and controlling the selectivity of alkane conversions. Catalyst performance in alkane conversions is significantly influenced by the structure of the silica support, the concentration of tantalum hydride, and the operating conditions.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合机制，主要涉及两个活性中心：两站点和单站点方案。在两站点机制中，催化剂使相邻碳原子之间的烷基团交换，而在单站点方案中，则促进同一分子内一个碳原子上的烷基团向另一个碳原子的转移。线性烷烃转化通常涉及链上烷基团的重排，而环烷烃转化则涉及烷基-碳键的创建和断裂以形成环状结构。反应中的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们在初始步骤中形成，在反应过程中起着至关重要的作用。理解这些中间体的形成及其在控制烷烃转化选择性方面的作用是必要的。催化剂在烷烃转化中的性能受到诸如二氧化硅支撑结构、钽氢化物浓度以及操作条件等因素的影响。
