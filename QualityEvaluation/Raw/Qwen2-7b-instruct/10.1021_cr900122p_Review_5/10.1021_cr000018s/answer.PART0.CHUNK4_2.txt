Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides reveals the involvement of both two-site and one-site schemes. These mechanisms enable the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkanes. Key steps include the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which significantly impact the selectivity and efficiency of the catalyst in different alkane conversion processes.
