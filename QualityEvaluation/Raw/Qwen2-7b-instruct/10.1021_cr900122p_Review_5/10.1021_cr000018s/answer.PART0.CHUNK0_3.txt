The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. Linear alkane transformations involve the rearrangement of alkene bonds, while cyclic alkane transformations can lead to the formation of cyclobutanes. Key intermediates in the process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, whose formation and control contribute significantly to the reaction's selectivity and the catalyst's performance in various alkane conversions.
