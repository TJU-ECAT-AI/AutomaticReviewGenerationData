[1] "The use of methane via SMR as an indirect source of H2. However, it could be used directly as a source of hydrogen for other catalytic transformations."
[2] "There are reports in the literature in which CH4 is decomposed to H2 and carbon, which is then converted in a separate step to CO or CO2 or used in an elemental carbon product."
[3] "In H2 production, there are always concerns with regard to carbon formation which can build rapidly and poison the process. Carbon leads to fouling (clogging) of the reactor and blocks active sites on the catalyst, and thus it is important to inhibit carbon formation."
[4] "Formation of carbon (coke) during the process is a critical issue that impacts performance and lifetime of commercial catalysts."
[5] "Commercial approaches to minimize potential carbon formation include high ratios of steam to hydrocarbon, the continual addition of ppm levels of sulfur compounds to the feed stream, the addition of alkali promoters, and added support phases such as MgAl spinel."
[6] "In the United States, with the exception of several industrial laboratories, there are few facilities that have capabilities for studying and testing reforming catalysts under actual process conditions."
[7] "A significant part of the catalyst loaded into tubular reformers is unused or poorly utilized because heat transfer is often the limiting factor."
[8] "There is considerable interest in producing H2 as a fuel for fuel cells. However, no current fuel cell can operate within the temperature limits of commercial reformers."
[9] "The lifetime of the catalyst is an important criterion in evaluating new catalysts with respect to current commercial SMR technologies; claims of superior catalytic performance must be verified by operation at the high pressures and temperatures of conventional processes for extended periods, i.e., thousands of hours."
[10] "Major improvements in the current technologies could be realized with new catalysts that optimize CO2 and/or H2O adsorption, enhance surface reactions, or inhibit the formation of elemental carbon."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The reactions involve the rearrangement of alkane structures through the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. The processes include the activation of alkane bonds by the catalyst, the breaking of these bonds, and the recombination to form new alkane structures. 

For linear alkane transformations, the mechanism typically starts with the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes rearrangements to form new alkane structures. In cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism is similar but involves the formation of metallacyclobutane rings, which can further undergo rearrangements or ring-opening reactions to form new cyclic alkane products.

Selectivity in alkane conversions is influenced by the catalyst's ability to efficiently activate alkane bonds, the stability of key intermediates, and the reactivity of the catalyst towards different alkane structures. The catalyst performance is optimized by factors such as the catalyst's surface area, the type of metal used, and the support material. High catalyst performance is achieved when the catalyst can efficiently convert alkane structures with minimal side reactions.

Silica-supported tantalum hydrides, as catalysts for alkane metathesis, are effective in promoting the rearrangement of alkane structures. The silica support helps stabilize the catalyst, while tantalum hydrides provide the necessary reactivity for alkane activation and bond rearrangement. The catalyst's performance can be further improved by optimizing parameters such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of specific promoters or additives.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation and manipulation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as intermediates to achieve efficient and selective alkane conversions. Factors influencing catalyst performance include the catalyst's ability to activate alkane bonds, the stability of intermediates, and the optimization of reaction conditions.
