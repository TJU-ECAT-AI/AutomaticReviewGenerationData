[1] "Recently we reported that silica supported zirconium hydride species was capable of room temperature activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds [1,2] and of the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane [2-4]."
[2] "This remarkable catalyst has been characterised on a molecular and atomic level by IR, CP-MAS IH and 3C NMR, EXAFS spectroscopies [5] as well as by microanalysis and other chemical assays and so we are able to write the exact formula for this catalyst, (-SiO)3ZrH, and its derivatives."

[5] "Propane was removed and each sample was exposed to D20 vapor. Gases given off were quantified by GC. The unique product in each case was propane-d as determined by GC/MS."

The silica-supported zirconium hydride catalyst can activate carbon-hydrogen bonds at room temperature and hydrogenolyze alkanes to methane and ethane at lower temperatures. The catalyst's structure and properties allow for its precise formulation. The stoichiometric reaction between the catalyst and propane involves infrared spectroscopy. The catalyst is prepared under specific conditions involving hydrogen and temperature. Propane activation leads to the formation of deuterated propane products, indicating regioselectivity in the activation process. Kinetic analysis supports the hypothesis of regioselective activation, with a calculated ratio of 5.6 between primary and secondary C-H bond activation rates. Theoretical calculations suggest that the activation of primary C-H bonds is favored over secondary ones due to the stability of the corresponding conformers. Activation of propane by the catalyst is found to be selective for primary C-H bonds over secondary ones through multiple independent methods.
