The silica-supported zirconium hydride catalyst activates carbon-hydrogen bonds in propane, forming a mixture of products. The major product identified through various methods is the one where the carbon-hydrogen bond activation is selective for primary bonds over secondary ones. This selectivity is further evidenced by the catalytic deuteration of propane, which shows a preference for primary bonds. The mechanism involves a degenerate carbon-hydrogen bond activation process. The study employs independent methods to determine the regioselectivity, indicating a strong preference for primary bonds.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two-site and one-site schemes. In two-site mechanisms, alkane molecules undergo a series of steps including bond activation, migration, and recombination. One-site mechanisms involve a single step where an alkene is formed directly from an alkane without the need for a migration step. Linear alkane transformations typically involve the breaking of one carbon-carbon bond and the formation of a new bond between two carbons, while cyclic alkane transformations often lead to the formation of a cyclobutane or a cyclopentane structure. Key intermediates in these processes include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the rearrangement of alkane structures. Factors contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance include the nature of the metal hydride, the coordination environment, and the stability of the intermediates. The silica support provides a stable surface for the metal hydride, facilitating the reactions while minimizing side reactions.

In the context of silica-supported tantalum hydrides, the selectivity for primary over secondary C-H bonds in the activation of propane highlights the importance of the catalyst's ability to distinguish between different types of C-H bonds. This selectivity can influence the efficiency and specificity of alkane conversions, leading to the formation of desired products rather than unwanted byproducts. The detailed mechanism involves the activation of the primary C-H bonds of propane before undergoing subsequent reactions, such as hydrogenolysis or metathesis, which are governed by the specific interactions between the metal hydride and the alkane substrate.

The catalyst performance is influenced by factors such as the surface area and porosity of the silica support, the concentration of the metal hydride, and the reaction conditions, including temperature and pressure. The stability of the catalyst over multiple cycles is another critical factor that affects its practical utility in industrial applications. The use of silica-supported tantalum hydrides demonstrates the potential of metal hydrides as versatile catalysts for alkane transformations, offering a platform for the development of more efficient and selective catalytic processes.

The theoretical calculations on scandium n-propyl and iso-propyl fragments further illustrate the importance of stabilization effects in the activation process. The higher stability of the scandium-carbon bond in the terminal methyl group of propane contributes to the selectivity towards primary C-H bonds. This insight underscores the role of steric and electronic factors in determining the reaction pathways and product distributions during alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides.

In summary, the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst enables efficient and selective alkane metathesis reactions, particularly favoring the activation of primary C-H bonds over secondary ones. This selectivity is influenced by the detailed mechanism involving the stabilization of intermediates and the specific interactions between the metal hydride and the alkane substrate. The catalyst's performance is optimized through careful control of reaction conditions and support materials, leading to the efficient conversion of alkanes into desired products with high yield and purity.

在硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃互变异构的全面机制涉及两个位点和一个位点方案。在两个位点机制中，烷烃分子经历一系列步骤，包括键激活、迁移和重组。单个位点机制涉及一步过程，其中直接从烷烃形成烯烃，无需迁移步骤。线性烷烃转化通常涉及一个碳-碳键的断裂和两个碳原子之间新键的形成，而环烷烃转化往往导致环丁烷或环戊烷结构的形成。这些过程中关键的中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们在烷烃结构重排中起着至关重要的作用。反应选择性和催化剂性能的因素包括金属氢化物的性质、配合环境以及中间体的稳定性。硅基质提供了一个稳定的表面来支持金属氢化物，从而促进反应，同时最小化副反应。

在硅支持的钽氢化物的背景下，丙烷中主碳-氢键的活性选择性高于次级碳-氢键，这突出了催化剂区分不同类型碳-氢键的能力的重要性。这种选择性影响了烷烃转换的效率和特异性，导致形成所需产品而非副产物。

催化剂性能受硅基质表面积和孔隙率、金属氢化物浓度以及反应条件（如温度和压力）的影响。催化剂循环稳定性的稳定性是其实际工业应用中的另一个关键因素。硅支持的钽氢化物的使用展示了金属氢化物作为烷烃转化的多功能催化剂的潜力，为开发更高效和选择性的催化过程提供了平台。

理论计算对钪正丙基和异丙基片段进一步说明了稳定效应在激活过程中的重要性。丙烷末端甲基团中钪-碳键的更高稳定性有助于主碳-氢键的选择性激活。这一见解强调了立体化学和电子因素在硅支持的钽氢化物催化下烷烃互变异构过程中确定反应途径和产品分布的作用。

总之，硅支持的钽氢化物催化剂能够高效且选择性地进行烷烃互变异构反应，特别偏好激活主碳-氢键而非次级碳-氢键。这种选择性受到详细机制的影响，涉及到中间体的稳定性和金属氢化物与烷烃基质之间的特定相互作用。通过仔细控制反应条件和支持材料，优化了催化剂的性能，实现了烷烃向期望产品的高效和纯度转化。

The silica-supported zirconium hydride catalyst can activate carbon-hydrogen bonds at room temperature and hydrogenolyze alkanes to methane and ethane at lower temperatures. The catalyst's structure and properties allow for its precise formulation. The stoichiometric reaction between the catalyst and propane involves infrared spectroscopy. The catalyst is prepared under specific conditions involving hydrogen and temperature. Propane activation leads to the formation of deuterated propane products, indicating regioselectivity in the activation process. Kinetic analysis supports the hypothesis of regioselective activation, with a calculated ratio of 5.6 between primary and secondary C-H bond activation rates. Theoretical calculations suggest that the activation of primary C-H bonds is favored over secondary ones due to the stability of the corresponding conformers. Activation of propane by the catalyst is found to be selective for primary C-H bonds over secondary ones through multiple independent methods.
