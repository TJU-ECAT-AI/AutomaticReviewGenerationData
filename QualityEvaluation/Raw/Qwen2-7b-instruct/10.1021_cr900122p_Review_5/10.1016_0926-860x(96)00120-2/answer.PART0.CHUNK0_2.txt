The silica-supported zirconium hydride catalysts activate carbon-hydrogen bonds at room temperature and enable the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane. Stoichiometric reactions demonstrate that propane activates predominantly to form (=- SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3, indicating a preference for primary carbon-hydrogen bonds. The catalytic deuteration shows that primary C-H bonds react significantly faster than secondary ones. Three independent methods confirm the selectivity towards primary C-H bonds in propane activation. Studies on analogous hafnium hydride complexes and carbon-carbon bond activation mechanisms are planned for future research.

硅基支撑锆化氢催化剂在室温下激活碳氢键，并能够实现烷烃低温氢解生成甲烷和乙烷。定量的化学反应表明，丙烷主要转化为(-= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3，这显示了对主碳氢键的偏好。催化脱氘实验显示，主碳氢键的反应速率远高于次级碳氢键。通过三种独立方法证实了在丙烷活化过程中对主碳氢键的选择性。对于类似铪化氢复合物的研究以及碳-碳键激活机制的探讨计划在未来进行深入研究。
