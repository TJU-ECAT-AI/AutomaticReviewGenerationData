          [1] "Recently we reported that silica supported zirconium hydride species was capable of room temperature activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds [1,2] and of the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane [2-4]."
          [2] "The stoichiometric reaction between propane and (=- SiO)3ZrH leads to the formation of a mixture of (=- SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (-= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3."
          [3] "Each of these methods indicated that ( SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH 3 was the major product of propane activation."
          [4] "A mechanism of degenerate carbon-hydrogen bond activation is invoked for the latter reaction."
          [5] "The activation of propane carbon-hydrogen bonds by (= SiO)3Zr-H is selective for primary over secondary C-H bonds by three independent methods."
          [6] "We were able to study the selectivity of the activation of propane carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane in a catalytic reaction as well, the deuteration of propane."
          [7] "For propane, they report 10 turnovers of deuteration after reaction of an equimolar mixture of propane and deuterium in the presence of their catalyst for 72 h at 120C."
          [8] "The ratio between the first order rate constants, k]/k 2, is equal to 5.6."
          [9] "In terms of the n/iso type of selectivity determined in the stoichiometric experiments described above (thus taking into account that propane has six primary C-H bonds and only two secondary) one obtains an n/iso ratio of 16.8."

          This question discusses the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, focusing on the differences between two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

          [2] "This remarkable catalyst has been characterised on a molecular and atomic level by IR, CP-MAS IH and 3C NMR, EXAFS spectroscopies [5] as well as by microanalysis and other chemical assays and so we are able to write the exact formula for this catalyst, (-SiO)3ZrH, and its derivatives."
          [3] "The stoichiometric reaction of (= SiO)3Zr-H and propane was followed by infrared spectroscopy in situ."
          [4] "As described elsewhere, (= SiO)3Zr-H is prepared by heating = SiOZrNp3 under hydrogen (200 torr) at 165C for 3 h (spectrum (a) of Fig. 1) [1,2]."
          [5] "Propane was removed and each sample was exposed to D20 vapor. Gases given off were quantified by GC. The unique product in each case was propane-d as determined by GC/MS."
          [6] "Kinetic analysis of the catalytic deuteration experiment lends credence to the hypothesis that the activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane is regioselective."
          [7] "The v(C-H) intensity shown is the integrated area of the region 3200-2800 cm- 1 of each spectrum shown in Fig. 2 (data for t > 30 min is not shown in Fig. 3 to 1000 8013

          [9] "Indeed theoretical calculations on scandium n-propyl and iso-propyl fragments [16] indicate that the scandium-carbon ScCH2CH2CH  is 8.5 kcal/mol stronger than that of ScCH(CH3)-."
