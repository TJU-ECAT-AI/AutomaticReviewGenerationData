[1] "Recently we reported that silica supported zirconium hydride species was capable of room temperature activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds [1,2] and of the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane [2-4]."
[2] "The stoichiometric reaction between propane and (=- SiO)3ZrH leads to the formation of a mixture of (=- SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (-= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3."
[3] "Each of these methods indicated that ( SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH 3 was the major product of propane activation."
[4] "A mechanism of degenerate carbon-hydrogen bond activation is invoked for the latter reaction."
[5] "The activation of propane carbon-hydrogen bonds by (= SiO)3Zr-H is selective for primary over secondary C-H bonds by three independent methods."
[6] "We were able to study the selectivity of the activation of propane carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane in a catalytic reaction as well, the deuteration of propane."
[7] "For propane, they report 10 turnovers of deuteration after reaction of an equimolar mixture of propane and deuterium in the presence of their catalyst for 72 h at 120C."
[8] "The ratio between the first order rate constants, k]/k 2, is equal to 5.6."
[9] "In terms of the n/iso type of selectivity determined in the stoichiometric experiments described above (thus taking into account that propane has six primary C-H bonds and only two secondary) one obtains an n/iso ratio of 16.8."

The silica-supported zirconium hydride catalyst activates carbon-hydrogen bonds in propane, forming a mixture of products. The major product identified through various methods is the one where the carbon-hydrogen bond activation is selective for primary bonds over secondary ones. This selectivity is further evidenced by the catalytic deuteration of propane, which shows a preference for primary bonds. The mechanism involves a degenerate carbon-hydrogen bond activation process. The study employs independent methods to determine the regioselectivity, indicating a strong preference for primary bonds.

硅基支撑的锆氢化物催化剂能够激活丙烷中的碳氢键，形成混合物。通过多种方法确定的主要产物是选择性激活主键超过次键的产物。这种选择性在催化脱氢过程中进一步得到证实，显示出对主键的偏好。机制涉及一种退化的碳氢键激活过程。研究使用独立的方法来确定区域选择性，表明对主键有很强的选择性。
