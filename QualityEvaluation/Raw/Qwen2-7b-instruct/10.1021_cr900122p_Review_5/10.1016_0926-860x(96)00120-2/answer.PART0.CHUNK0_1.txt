2. "This remarkable catalyst has been characterised on a molecular and atomic level by IR, CP-MAS IH and 3C NMR, EXAFS spectroscopies [5] as well as by microanalysis and other chemical assays and so we are able to write the exact formula for this catalyst, (-SiO)3ZrH, and its derivatives."
3. "The objective of this study was to describe the regioselectivity on C-H bond activation by this complex toward a molecule like propane which presents primary and secondary C-H bonds."
4. "The stoichiometric reaction of (= SiO)3Zr-H and propane was followed by infrared spectroscopy in situ. As described elsewhere, (= SiO)3Zr-H is prepared by heating = SiOZrNp3 under hydrogen (200 torr) at 165C for 3 h (spectrum (a) of Fig. 1) [1,2]."
5. "The yield of propane with respect to grafted Zr adsorbed was 57% for the reaction run at 30C and 80% for the reaction at 100C (Scheme 1)."
6. "In another study of the stoichiometric reaction of the hydride with propane,800 mg of (= SiO)3Zr-H (0.78 wt.-% Zr) was divided into three reactors. Two of these reactors were charged with 300 torr of propane and heated to 30C and 100C respectively for 18 h."
7. "The half-life of this catalytic deuteration was approximately 3 min representing about 200 turnovers."
8. "Kinetic analysis of the catalytic deuteration experiment lends credence to the hypothesis that the activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane is regioselective."
9. "For propane, they report 10 turnovers of deuteration after reaction of an equimolar mixture of propane and deuterium in the presence of their catalyst for 72 h at 120C."
10. "The ratio between the first order rate constants, k]/k2, is equal to the ratio between the effective rate constants, k, and k,2, and represents the difference between the per carbon-hydrogen bond rate constants."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. The process typically involves the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst is characterized on a molecular and atomic level using various spectroscopic techniques, including IR, CP-MAS IH, 3C NMR, EXAFS spectroscopies, and microanalysis. This allows for the precise formulation of the catalyst and its derivatives. The catalyst demonstrates regioselectivity in activating carbon-hydrogen bonds, favoring primary over secondary C-H bonds. Stoichiometric reactions with propane show that the activation is selective for primary C-H bonds. The catalyst also exhibits regioselectivity in the catalytic deuteration of propane, indicating a preference for primary C-H bond activation. The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the formation and stability of these intermediates, as well as the specific conditions under which the reactions are carried out. Kinetic analysis provides insights into the reaction pathways and rates, further elucidating the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides.
