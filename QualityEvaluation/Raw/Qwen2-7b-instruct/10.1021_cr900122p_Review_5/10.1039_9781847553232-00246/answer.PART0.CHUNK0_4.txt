[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."
[2] "Since 1974 n-butane has been increasingly used in place of benzene as the raw material for maleic anhydride production for the following reasons: Lower price, Nontoxicity."
[3] "Several processes have been developed in recent years for n-butane oxidation which differ in regard to the following aspects': Type of reactor (fixed, fluidized, or moving bed), Type of recovery of maleic anhydride (anhydrous or aqueous), and System for the purification of maleic anhydride."
[4] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P- based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high tempera- ture."
[5] "In catalysts activated in air, the transformation from an amorphous phase to an almost completely crystal- line vanadylpyrophosphate inside the reactor (in the presence of the reactant's mixture) requires more than 100 hours?"
[6] "Equilibrated catalysts are no longer reoxidizable in air at 400 O C , contrary to a freshly prepared (VO),P,O, or with non- equilibrated catalysts."
[7] "The reaction pattern proposed in Table 2, which is a first approximation of the mechanism, shows the elementary steps necessary to obtain maleic anhydride and the types of active sites that are required."
[8] "The main products obtained in the oxidation of several probe molecules on V-P catalysts are reported in Table 3."
[9] "The peculiarities of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 are the following: 1. A first key property is the ability to activate the paraffin (the first step of the reaction pattern) with high selectivity."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is primarily dependent on the preparation of the catalyst precursor, which includes factors such as the type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvents, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The transformation from an amorphous phase to a crystalline vanadylpyrophosphate requires over 100 hours in air for catalysts activated in this environment. Equilibrated catalysts exhibit different properties, such as being non-reoxidizable in air at 400°C, unlike freshly prepared or non-equilibrated catalysts. The reaction pattern proposed for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, as detailed in Table 2, outlines the essential steps and active sites involved in the process. The catalysts show unique characteristics, particularly in activating paraffins with high selectivity, as evidenced by the oxidation of probe molecules listed in Table 3.

Silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit distinct mechanisms in alkane metathesis, including the ability to facilitate the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, contributing to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions. The transformation of linear and cyclic alkane structures, along with the identification of key intermediates, plays a crucial role in understanding the efficiency of the catalytic process.

烷基化催化由硅支持的钽氢化物催化全面机制的分析涉及理解双位点和单位点方案，线性和环烷烃转换过程中涉及的过程，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和作用，以及这些因素如何促进不同烷基转换的选择性和催化剂性能。

n-丁烷氧化为马来酸酐的主要依赖于催化剂前体的制备，包括反应剂、还原剂和溶剂的类型，P/V比，添加剂的存在，以及在高温下激活和条件化的方法。在空气中激活的催化剂需要超过100小时才能从无定形相转化为几乎完全结晶的钨磷酸盐。平衡化的催化剂表现出不同的特性，如在400°C的空气中不可氧化，与刚制备或非平衡化的催化剂不同。表2中提出的一系列步骤概述了n-丁烷氧化为马来酸酐的过程，其中包含活性位点和所需的基本步骤。催化剂显示出独特的特征，特别是以高选择性激活烷基，这通过表3列出的探针分子的氧化得到证实。

硅支持的钽氢化物在烷基化中的机制具有明显的特性，包括促进烯烃和金属环丁烷的形成的能力，从而促进催化剂在烷基转换中的效率。线性和环烷结构的转变，以及关键中间体的识别，在理解催化过程的效率方面起着关键作用。
