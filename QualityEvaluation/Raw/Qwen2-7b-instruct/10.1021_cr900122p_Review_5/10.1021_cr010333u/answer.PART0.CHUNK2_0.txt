[1] "A similar reaction cycle is claimed by ARCO to occur with tetra-alkylammonium salts of the anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid in aqueous methanol, giving good yields of propylene epoxide."
[2] "The noble metal catalyzes the formation of H2O2 from H2 and O2, while the TS-1 will react the formed H2O2 with propylene to give the epoxide."
[3] "An optimized catalyst gives propylene oxide with selectivities up to 85% at conversions between 15 and 20%."
