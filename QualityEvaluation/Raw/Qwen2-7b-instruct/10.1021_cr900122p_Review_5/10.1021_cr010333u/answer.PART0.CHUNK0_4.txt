The document outlines the evolution of catalysts from homogeneous Lewis acid catalysts to heterogeneous catalysts, highlighting their roles in various oxidation reactions. The introduction of acidity in the form of Lewis acids is emphasized as a key factor in catalytic oxidations. The document also discusses the application of biphasic fluorous systems, where catalysts can be recycled and reused, and the use of heteropolyacids as catalysts for oxidation reactions. The complexity of catalysts, such as the need for a balance of Lewis acid and redox sites in catalysts for specific reactions, is also highlighted. The role of acidity in both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts is a recurring theme throughout the document.

The biphasic fluorous system utilizes perfluorinated solvents that are not miscible with common organic solvents. This system allows for the separation of catalyst and reaction products upon cooling, enabling the recovery and reuse of the catalyst. The acidity of heteropolyacids, derived from their structure and the weak interaction between the anion and proton, is noted as contributing to their catalytic activity in oxidation reactions. The document also mentions the immobilization of heteropolyacids on inorganic oxides to create heterogeneous catalysts, with the acidity and Lewis acid sites playing a role in their activity.

The presence of Lewis basic sites, Lewis acid sites, and redox sites in the surfaces of materials such as PW12O403- heteropolyanions is discussed. The document also addresses the importance of considering the balance of hydration and oxydehydrogenation processes in catalysts for specific reactions, such as the conversion of propene to acetone. Overall, the document provides a comprehensive overview of the role of acidity and the evolution of catalysts in the field of catalytic oxidations.
