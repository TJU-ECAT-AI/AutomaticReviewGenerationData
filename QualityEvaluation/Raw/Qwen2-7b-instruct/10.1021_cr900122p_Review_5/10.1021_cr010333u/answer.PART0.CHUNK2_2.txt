The mechanism of acetonitrile photooxidation on TiO2 involves adsorption of acetonitrile (CH3CN) on both isolated TiOH groups and Ti4+ Lewis acid sites at temperatures higher than 73 C. Under UV irradiation, acetonitrile is oxidized in the presence of O2 to form CO2, H2O, surface carbonate, and an intermediate isocyanate species. Oxidation of the CH3 moiety of acetonitrile occurs more easily than that of the CN.

在TiO2上，通过UV照射，温度高于73°C时，乙腈(CH3CN)被吸附在孤立的TiOH簇和Ti4+Lewis酸中心上。在UV光照射下，在氧气的存在下，乙腈被氧化生成二氧化碳、水、表面碳酸盐以及一个中间的异氰酸盐物种。乙基部分的氧化比氰基部分更容易。
