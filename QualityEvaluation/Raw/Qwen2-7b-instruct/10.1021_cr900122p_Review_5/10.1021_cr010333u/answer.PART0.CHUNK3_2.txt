The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides encompasses both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site approach, the catalyst assists in the creation of an intermediate metallacyclobutane. The one-site scheme involves the catalyst in the direct transfer of a double bond from one alkane molecule to another. Linear alkane transformations entail the reorganization of carbon-carbon bonds to produce new alkenes. Cyclic alkane transformations lead to the formation of cyclobutanes and cyclopentanes through metathesis reactions. Key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, are pivotal in influencing the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process. The performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions is affected by parameters such as the structure of the silica support, the concentration of tantalum hydrides, and the reaction conditions.
