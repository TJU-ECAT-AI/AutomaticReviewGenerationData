[1] "Dehydroxylated and high-silica pentasil HZSM-5 zeolites have been used as catalysts for the selective oxidation of aromatic compounds including benzene, chlorobenzene, difluorobenzenes, phenol, styrene, and alkylbenzenes into their corresponding phenols using nitrous oxide as oxidant."
[2] "Steamed H/AlZSM-5 with strong Lewis acid sites is highly active for the oxidation of benzene with N2O.75 High phenol yields (70-80% in the case of hydroxylation of benzene), high selectivities and regioselectivities were observed in all cases."
[3] "Metal-containing zeolites have also been active for the hydroxylation of benzene using N2O as oxidant. Yields up to 16% with selectivities 90-97% can be achieved at 400°C of reaction temperature."
[4] "Inert gas additive has been used to prevent reactor temperature increase due to the exothermicity of the reaction. However, in all cases catalyst deactivation with time on stream is one of the main obstacles for process commercialization."
[5] "Catalyst stability can be increased by hydrothermal treatment of the zeolite. 539,543 Key parameters for steam treatment are temperature, steam partial pressure, and time of treatment. It has been reported that a hydrothermal treatment at 700°C with 50% molar H2O for 2 h increases benzene conversion and catalyst stability when using ZSM-5."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The process includes the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkanes, with key intermediates being alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The factors contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance include the specific conditions of the reaction, such as temperature, pressure, and the nature of the catalyst itself. Silica-supported tantalum hydrides enable efficient alkane metathesis, leading to the formation of desired products through the selective cleavage and rearrangement of alkyl bonds. The catalyst's stability and activity are enhanced through hydrothermal treatment, which improves benzene conversion and reduces catalyst deactivation over time. Inert gas additives are used to manage the exothermic nature of the reaction and prevent temperature spikes.
