Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides reveals that both two-site and one-site schemes are involved. Linear and cyclic alkane transformations are achieved through the creation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The behavior of key intermediates is pivotal in influencing the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
