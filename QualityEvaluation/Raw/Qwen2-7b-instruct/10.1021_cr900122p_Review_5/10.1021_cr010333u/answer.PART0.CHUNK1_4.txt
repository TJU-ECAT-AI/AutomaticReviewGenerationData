[1] "Alkane activation on a solid surface requires the presence of strong acid or basic sites."
[2] "When this is done in the presence of a reactant able to be oxidized by the peracids, a system is developed in which the aldehyde can act as a oxygen transfer agent."
[3] "Thus, in an analogous way, H2O2 could also be generated in situ in the reaction media, and then it acts as the oxidant in the presence of the adequate catalyst."
[4] "Catalyst stability can be increased by hydrothermal treatment of the zeolite."
[5] "Key parameters for steam treatment are temperature, steam partial pressure, and time of treatment."
[6] "A further improvement in catalyst stability for benzene hydroxylation has been achieved by acid treatment of the zeolite after hydrothermal treatment."

1. Alkane activation on a solid surface requires the presence of strong acid or basic sites.

2. When using a reactant that can be oxidized by peracids, the aldehyde can act as an oxygen transfer agent in the system.

3. H2O2 can be generated in situ in the reaction medium and acts as an oxidant when the adequate catalyst is present.

4. Catalyst stability can be enhanced through hydrothermal treatment of the zeolite.

5. Key factors for steam treatment include temperature, steam partial pressure, and treatment duration.

6. After hydrothermal treatment, acid treatment of the zeolite can further improve catalyst stability for benzene hydroxylation.
