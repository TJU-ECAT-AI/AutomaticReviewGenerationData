[1] "Dehydroxylated and high-silica pentasil HZSM-5 zeolites have been used as catalysts for the selective oxidation of aromatic compounds including benzene, chlorobenzene, difluorobenzenes, phenol, styrene, and alkylbenzenes into their corresponding phenols using nitrous oxide as oxidant."
[2] "Steamed H/AlZSM-5 with strong Lewis acid sites is highly active for the oxidation of benzene with N2O."
[3] "Metal-containing zeolites have also been active for the hydroxylation of benzene using N2O as oxidant."
[4] "The active sites were shown to be strong Lewis acidbase pair sites formed upon dehydroxylation of acidic HZSM-5 zeolite."
[5] "Yields up to 16% with selectivities 9097% have been achieved using iron-doped zeolites."
