[1] "Very frequently, solids containing transition metals are termed as redox catalysts, but they act in reality as solid Lewis acids."
[2] "The oxidation catalytic center is an assembly of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom that undergoes variation in its oxidation state through the catalytic cycle."
[3] "A Lewis acid can abstract a single electron from an electron-rich molecule."
[4] "The resulting organic radical cation is a highly reactive, short-lived reaction intermediate that can be subsequently trapped by water or any other nucleophile present in the medium or by oxygen, and at the end oxygenated products are formed."
[5] "Lewis acids of zeolites are also known to generate organic radical cations."
[6] "The radical cation of 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene is characterized by EPR after adsorption of 2,5-dimethyl-1,5-hexadiene or 2,5-dimethyl-3-hexene on dealuminated mordenite."
[7] "Thus, the radical cation of 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene is characterized by EPR after adsorption of 2,5-dimethyl-1,5-hexadiene or 2,5-dimethyl-3-hexene on dealuminated mordenite."
[8] "In this type of oxidations, the catalytic center is in reality an assembly of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom that undergoes variation in its oxidation state through the catalytic cycle."
[9] "In the next section, we will comment on the catalytic activities of these vanadium-containing solids and the established relationship with Lewis acid sites."
[10] "For instance, while platinum deposited on alumina forms a platinum compound on the solid surface, the weaker electron acceptor properties of charcoal compared to alumina determines that the species present on charcoal surface is predominantly metallic platinum."
[11] "In this way, higher valent incompletely coordinated metal ions or anionic vacancies on oxide surfaces can act as acidic sites, and oxygen ions, O2-, as basic sites."
[12] "By means of in situ Raman spectroscopy, it has been proposed that the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is more efficient at sites with more than one vanadium atom."
[13] "Apparently, the presence of gaseous oxygen lowers the amount of coordinated ammonia, probably due to the formation of amido NH2 species."
[14] "For instance, the presence of Lewis acid sites in the catalyst can lead to the formation of a Lewis acid-base adduct with the substrate or the oxidizing agent, enhancing their reactivity and acting as a catalyst for the oxidation reaction."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both one-site and two-site schemes. In a one-site mechanism, a single active site facilitates the reaction, while in a two-site mechanism, two active sites are involved. The transformation of linear alkane to cyclic alkane typically involves the formation of an alkene intermediate, which then undergoes a concerted addition-elimination process to form the cyclic alkane. The formation of metallacyclobutanes, where the metal atom is part of the cyclobutane ring, is a key intermediate in the reaction. The role of alkenes is to act as a starting material for the formation of the final alkane product. The catalyst performance and selectivity in alkane conversions are influenced by the stability of the active sites, the strength of the acid-base interactions, and the presence of other catalytic components. The selectivity towards specific alkane products is determined by the balance between the rate of the forward and reverse reactions, as well as the kinetic barriers associated with the different alkane isomers.
