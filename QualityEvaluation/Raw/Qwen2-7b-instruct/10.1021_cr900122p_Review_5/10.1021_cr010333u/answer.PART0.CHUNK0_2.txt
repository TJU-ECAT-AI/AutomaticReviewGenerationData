[1] "Vanadium is among the most active transition metals capable to effect alkane oxydehydrogenation, oxygenations, and alkylaromatic oxidations."
[2] "The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide can be promoted by Lewis acid assistance of the support as, for instance, in alkane oxidation."
[3] "Supported metal catalysts are widely used for the partial oxidation of alkanes or alcohols. The catalytic effects are not only due to changes in the metal dispersity but also to the interaction of the metal with the Lewis acid sites of the support."
[4] "In the case of polyoxometalates, a widely used methodology to recover the catalyst is support the soluble Lewis acids onto an insoluble solid."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The two-site scheme includes the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. Alkenes are generated from linear alkane substrates through the breaking of alkane bonds and the formation of new C=C double bonds. Metallacyclobutanes, formed from cyclic alkane substrates, undergo isomerization to produce alkenes. The one-site scheme involves the direct formation of alkenes from both linear and cyclic alkane substrates through the activation of alkane bonds by the catalyst.

The selectivity of the reaction is influenced by the formation and role of these intermediates. The alkenes and metallacyclobutanes facilitate the rearrangement and transformation of alkane substrates into the desired products. The catalyst performance is enhanced by the Lewis acid sites of the silica support, which assist in the activation of alkane bonds and the stabilization of intermediates.

The formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes enables the conversion of both linear and cyclic alkane substrates into the desired products. The catalyst's selectivity is determined by the balance between the formation of alkenes and the subsequent transformations of these intermediates into the final products.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates, contributing to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
