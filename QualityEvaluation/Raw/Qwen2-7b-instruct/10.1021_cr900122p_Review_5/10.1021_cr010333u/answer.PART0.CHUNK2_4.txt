[1] "Permanganate has been the most popular oxidant whose reactions are studied in general organic chemistry textbooks,151 and its chemistry has a long and extensive story."
[2] "The simplest strategy in which the Lewis acid is deposited on a solid surface has evolved to more elaborate ones in which the Lewis site forms part of the solid framework. Titanium silicalite is the most emblematic example of this type of solid oxidation catalysts."
[3] "A large effort has been done for the development of soluble metal and metal complexes able to oxidize long chain olefins in liquid phase using O2 as a direct oxidant."
[4] "Despite the high selectivities to propylene oxide obtained with the Au/TiO2 system, conversions are low, and turnover frequencies with this system for propylene epoxidation are on the order of 20200 times lower than for the epoxidation of ethylene with silver catalysts."

1. Permanganate is a commonly studied oxidant in organic chemistry textbooks, known for its extensive chemistry history.
2. Solid oxidation catalysts have evolved from simply depositing Lewis acids on surfaces to incorporating Lewis sites within the solid framework, exemplified by titanium silicalite.
3. There has been extensive work on creating soluble metal complexes capable of oxidizing long-chain olefins using oxygen as a direct oxidant in liquid phase.
4. Although achieving high selectivity to propylene oxide with the Au/TiO2 system, the conversion rates are low compared to those achieved with silver catalysts in ethylene epoxidation.
