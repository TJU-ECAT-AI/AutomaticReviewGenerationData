The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two-site and one-site schemes. Linear alkanes are transformed into branched or cyclic alkane products through the formation of alkenes and rearrangement. For cyclic alkanes, metallacyclobutanes act as intermediates. The silica support ensures stability for the tantalum hydrides. Reaction selectivity is determined by alkane type and conditions. Catalyst performance is optimized by tweaking parameters like temperature and pressure.
