The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides includes two-site and one-site schemes. Linear alkane transformations generate alkenes as intermediate steps, while cyclic alkane transformations result in the formation of metallacyclobutanes. Key intermediates in the process are alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These aspects play crucial roles in determining the selectivity and efficiency of the catalyst in alkane conversion reactions.
