The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context of linear alkane transformations, the process starts with the formation of alkenes as key intermediates. These alkenes then undergo a β-hydrogen elimination followed by reoxidation of the metal center to its higher oxidation state. In the case of cyclic alkane transformations, the formation of metallacyclobutanes plays a crucial role. The catalyst's hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties significantly influence the reaction selectivity and performance in various alkane conversions. The presence of TiO2 anatase and/or amorphous titanosilicates negatively impacts the yields of dihydroxybenzenes. To study the reaction mechanism, researchers utilize isotopically labeled compounds, such as methylcyclohexanone with 18O, to track the pathways of the catalytic process.
