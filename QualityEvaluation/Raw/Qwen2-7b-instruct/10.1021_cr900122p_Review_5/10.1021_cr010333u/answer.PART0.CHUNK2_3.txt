[1] "A similar reaction cycle is claimed by ARCO to occur with tetra-alkylammonium salts of the anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid in aqueous methanol, giving good yields of propylene epoxide."
[2] "Following the methodology of generating H2O2 in situ, the most direct way to make this would be using O2 and H2. This is done by carrying out the propylene epoxidation on a bifunctional catalyst formed by Pd and Pt on TS-1."
[3] "When a catalyst formed by gold dispersed on TS-1 is used to epoxidize propylene with H2O2 formed in situ by reacting H2 and O2 at low temperature, no propane is formed and the selectivity to epoxide is high (99%), but conversion is low (<2%)."
[4] "In this sense, V-containing silicalite showed activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[5] "The success of vanadium silicalite for the above reaction is attributed to the presence of vanadium (V) as the sole site of oxygen activation together with the absence of Brnsted acidity and a limited tendency for oxygen insertion or alkene activation at allylic positions due to the presence of stable VOSi bonds containing nonelectrophilic bridging oxygen ions, and a stable coordination of vanadium."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two primary schemes: two-site and one-site catalysis. This mechanism encompasses both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, with the key intermediates being alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The catalysts facilitate the breaking and reformation of alkane bonds, leading to alkene formation and subsequent rearrangement into new alkane structures. 

The role of key intermediates includes the formation of alkenes through the cleavage of alkane bonds, which are then subjected to further transformations under the catalytic action of the silica-supported tantalum hydrides. Metallacyclobutanes are also crucial intermediates, playing a pivotal role in the rearrangement processes, particularly in cyclic alkane conversions. The catalysts' ability to activate oxygen and manage alkene activation at allylic positions, along with the coordination of vanadium, contributes to the high selectivity and performance in various alkane conversions.

The selectivity and catalyst performance in alkane conversions are influenced by the catalyst's ability to efficiently activate the alkane substrates, manage the oxygen and alkene activation processes, and control the reformation of alkane bonds. The silica support provides a stable and accessible platform for the catalytic reactions, enabling efficient alkane transformations while minimizing side reactions and byproducts.

烷烃重排由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化机制涉及两种主要方案：双位点和单位点催化。该机制包括线性和环烷烃的转换，关键中间体为烯烃和金属环丁烷。催化剂促进烷烃键的断裂与重组，导致烯烃形成并随后进行再排列生成新的烷烃结构。

关键中间体的作用包括通过裂解烷烃键形成烯烃，这些烯烃在二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化作用下进一步转化。金属环丁烷也是关键中间体，在循环烷烃转换过程中扮演重要角色。催化剂激活氧和烯烃激活的能力、以及对乙烯基位置的协同作用，与范德华配合物共同贡献于各种烷烃转化的选择性和性能。

烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能受到催化剂高效激活烷烃底物、管理氧和烯烃激活过程以及控制烷烃键重组能力的影响。二氧化硅支持提供稳定且易于访问的平台，实现高效烷烃转化同时减少副反应和副产品。
