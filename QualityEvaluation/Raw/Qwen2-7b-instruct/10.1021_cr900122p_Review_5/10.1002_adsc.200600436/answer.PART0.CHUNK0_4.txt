Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. Linear and cyclic alkane transformations are central to the reactions, with alkenes and metallacyclobutanes serving as key intermediates. These factors significantly contribute to the reaction selectivity and the performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
