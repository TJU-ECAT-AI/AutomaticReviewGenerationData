This study investigates the detailed mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, examining both two-site and one-site mechanisms. It explores the processes of linear and cyclic alkane transformations, focusing on the formation and roles of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These factors are crucial in understanding reaction selectivity and the performance of the catalyst in different alkane conversions.
