Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves examining both two-site and one-site schemes. Linear and cyclic alkane transformations are central processes, with alkenes and metallacyclobutanes acting as significant intermediates. These factors contribute to the reaction's selectivity and the catalyst's performance in different alkane conversions.
