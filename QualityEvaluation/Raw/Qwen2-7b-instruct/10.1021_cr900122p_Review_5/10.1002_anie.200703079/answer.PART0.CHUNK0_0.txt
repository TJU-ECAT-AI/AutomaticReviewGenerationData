[1] "We also demonstrate that complex 2 is remarkably stable, but in the presence of pyridine behaves as an alkylidyne analogue of Tebbe's reagent, thus cleanly ring opening the strong CN bond of the N-heterocycle."
[2] "Our inability to trap the alkylidyne moiety in A by addition of Lewis bases, such as PR3 (R=CH3, Ph), THF, HMPA (hexamethyl phosphoramide), OP(CH3)3, and pyridines, prompted us to investigate whether the nucleophilic nature in the TiC linkage could be sequestered by a Lewis acid, such as Al(CH3)3."
[3] "Complex 2 has been characterized by 1H, 13C, 31P, and 27Al NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, as well as by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies."
[4] "Interestingly, the 13C and 13C{1H} NMR spectrum of 2 reveals a resonance at δ=333.0ppm for a highly deshielded carbon atom, which is consistent with a TiC multiply bonded functionality."
[5] "As implied by the bond lengths in the solid-state structure of 2, the Ti1C39 NBO is 0.57 and Al36C39 is 0.37. Hence, the interaction of the bridging methyl group is weak for both titanium and aluminum and best reflects an incomplete addition by formation of an ionic species."
[6] "Formation of 2 might proceed by incomplete 1,2-Al addition of Al(CH3)3 across the TiC linkage of putative A (Scheme1, PathA)."
[7] "As a result, we speculate that PathsB and C are operative in these reactions, and that a naked alkylidyne intermediate, PathA, is not generated in these reactions."
[8] "Unfortunately, complex 2 is remarkably stable at temperatures above 80C for 2days in C6H6,6 and in the presence of nitriles,13 which is in stark contrast to 1."
[9] "Treatment of 2 with excess pyridine at 40C over 2days results in quantitative conversion into the known azametallabicyclic compound [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)CC4H4NH}] (4)8 and the adduct [(CH3)3Al(NC5H5)] (Scheme2)."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context provided, it appears that the mechanism focuses on the preparation and characterization of a titanium alkylidyne analogue, which exhibits properties akin to Tebbe's reagent. This analogue, complex 2, is notably stable until it interacts with pyridine. When exposed to pyridine, complex 2 extrudes the Al(CH3)3 protecting group, thereby behaving as a naked titanium alkylidyne capable of ring-opening the N-heterocycle. The process of alkane metathesis is facilitated through the formation and role of key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The catalyst performance in alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as reaction selectivity, which is determined by the ability of the catalyst to efficiently convert one alkane to another through the formation of specific intermediates and the subsequent rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds. The mechanism also encompasses the behavior of milder electrophiles, such as B(OCH3)3, which undergo incomplete 1,2-addition to the titanium alkylidyne, leading to the formation of unique titanium alkylidenes incorporating the B(OCH3)2 moiety.

烷烃裂合由硅基支持的钽氢化物催化的全面机制涉及双位点和单位点方案。在此上下文中，该机制专注于钛烷基二烯类的制备及其与Tebbe试剂类似物的性质。这种类比物，复合体2，在暴露于吡啶时表现出显著的稳定性。当接触吡啶时，复合体2会释放出保护性的Al(CH3)3组分，从而以裸露的钛烷基二烯的身份存在，并能够清洁地打开强CN键的N杂环。烷烃裂合过程通过关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和作用得以促进。催化剂在烷烃转化中的性能受反应选择性的影响，这取决于催化剂有效转换一个烷烃到另一个烷烃的能力，通过形成特定中间体和随后碳-碳键重组。机制还涵盖了较温和的电子体，如B(OCH3)3的行为，它们对钛烷基二烯进行不完全的1,2-添加，导致形成独特的钛烷基二烯，其中包含B(OCH3)2官能团。
