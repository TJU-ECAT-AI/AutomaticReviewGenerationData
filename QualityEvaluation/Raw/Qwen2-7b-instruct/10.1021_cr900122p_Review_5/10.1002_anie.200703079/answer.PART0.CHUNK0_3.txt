[1] "Tebbe's reagent, [Cp2Ti{CH2AlCl(CH3)2}] (Cp=C5H5),3 a Lewis acid stabilized methylidene complex prepared from addition of two equivalents of Al(CH3)3 to [Cp2TiCl2] [Eq.(1)], was one of the first reported early-transition-metal systems to perform olefin metathesis in a catalytic manner."
[2] "Methylenation of carbonyl-containing functionalities has driven the research of organotitanium reagents for use in organic chemistry."
[3] "Although Tebbe's complex can often utilize as a Wittig-like reagent for carbonyl methylenation reactions, since it is more reactive than prototypical phospha-Wittig reactants, and works particularly well for sterically encumbered carbonyl groups present in aldehydes, esters, lactones, and amides."
[4] "An alkylidyne analogue of Tebbe's reagent: trapping reactions of a titanium neopentylidyne by incomplete and complete 1,2-additions"
[5] "The solid state structures for the zwitterionic species [(PNP)Ti{CtBuAl(CH3)3}] as well as the product resulting from BO bond cleavage across the TiC moiety in A are also presented and discussed."
[6] "We also found that compound 2 can be prepared from [(PNP)TiCHtBu(Ph)] (3) and Al(CH3)3 over several minutes at 25C (Scheme1)."
[7] "As a result, we speculate that PathsB and C are operative in these reactions, and that a naked alkylidyne intermediate, PathA, is not generated in these reactions."
[8] "In the presence of pyridine, 2 extrudes the Al(CH3)3 protecting group, thus behaving as a naked titanium alkylidyne, ultimately ring opening the N-heterocycle."
[9] "The solid-state structure of 5 (Figure1) has a TiC bond (1.976(2)Å) which is longer than other titanium alkylidene linkages reported with this ligand."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.
