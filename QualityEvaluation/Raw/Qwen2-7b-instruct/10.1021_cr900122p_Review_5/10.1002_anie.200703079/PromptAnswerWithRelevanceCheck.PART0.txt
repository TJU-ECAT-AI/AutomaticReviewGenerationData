[1] "We also demonstrate that complex 2 is remarkably stable, but in the presence of pyridine behaves as an alkylidyne analogue of Tebbe's reagent, thus cleanly ring opening the strong CN bond of the N-heterocycle."
[2] "Our inability to trap the alkylidyne moiety in A by addition of Lewis bases, such as PR3 (R=CH3, Ph), THF, HMPA (hexamethyl phosphoramide), OP(CH3)3, and pyridines, prompted us to investigate whether the nucleophilic nature in the TiC linkage could be sequestered by a Lewis acid, such as Al(CH3)3."
[3] "Complex 2 has been characterized by 1H, 13C, 31P, and 27Al NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, as well as by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies."
[4] "Interestingly, the 13C and 13C{1H} NMR spectrum of 2 reveals a resonance at δ=333.0ppm for a highly deshielded carbon atom, which is consistent with a TiC multiply bonded functionality."
[5] "As implied by the bond lengths in the solid-state structure of 2, the Ti1C39 NBO is 0.57 and Al36C39 is 0.37. Hence, the interaction of the bridging methyl group is weak for both titanium and aluminum and best reflects an incomplete addition by formation of an ionic species."
[6] "Formation of 2 might proceed by incomplete 1,2-Al addition of Al(CH3)3 across the TiC linkage of putative A (Scheme1, PathA)."
[7] "As a result, we speculate that PathsB and C are operative in these reactions, and that a naked alkylidyne intermediate, PathA, is not generated in these reactions."
[8] "Unfortunately, complex 2 is remarkably stable at temperatures above 80C for 2days in C6H6,6 and in the presence of nitriles,13 which is in stark contrast to 1."
[9] "Treatment of 2 with excess pyridine at 40C over 2days results in quantitative conversion into the known azametallabicyclic compound [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)CC4H4NH}] (4)8 and the adduct [(CH3)3Al(NC5H5)] (Scheme2)."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context provided, it appears that the mechanism focuses on the preparation and characterization of a titanium alkylidyne analogue, which exhibits properties akin to Tebbe's reagent. This analogue, complex 2, is notably stable until it interacts with pyridine. When exposed to pyridine, complex 2 extrudes the Al(CH3)3 protecting group, thereby behaving as a naked titanium alkylidyne capable of ring-opening the N-heterocycle. The process of alkane metathesis is facilitated through the formation and role of key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The catalyst performance in alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as reaction selectivity, which is determined by the ability of the catalyst to efficiently convert one alkane to another through the formation of specific intermediates and the subsequent rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds. The mechanism also encompasses the behavior of milder electrophiles, such as B(OCH3)3, which undergo incomplete 1,2-addition to the titanium alkylidyne, leading to the formation of unique titanium alkylidenes incorporating the B(OCH3)2 moiety.

烷烃裂合由硅基支持的钽氢化物催化的全面机制涉及双位点和单位点方案。在此上下文中，该机制专注于钛烷基二烯类的制备及其与Tebbe试剂类似物的性质。这种类比物，复合体2，在暴露于吡啶时表现出显著的稳定性。当接触吡啶时，复合体2会释放出保护性的Al(CH3)3组分，从而以裸露的钛烷基二烯的身份存在，并能够清洁地打开强CN键的N杂环。烷烃裂合过程通过关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和作用得以促进。催化剂在烷烃转化中的性能受反应选择性的影响，这取决于催化剂有效转换一个烷烃到另一个烷烃的能力，通过形成特定中间体和随后碳-碳键重组。机制还涵盖了较温和的电子体，如B(OCH3)3的行为，它们对钛烷基二烯进行不完全的1,2-添加，导致形成独特的钛烷基二烯，其中包含B(OCH3)2官能团。

The literature discusses the preparation and characterization of an alkylidyne analogue of Tebbe's reagent, focusing on its trapping reactions and the formation of the titanium alkylidyne complex. The synthesis of the complex involves incomplete addition of trimethylaluminum across a {TiCtBu} moiety, leading to the stabilization of an alkylidyne moiety. The complex's stability and reactivity are highlighted, including its ability to extrude the Al(CH3)3 protecting group in the presence of pyridine, acting as a naked titanium alkylidyne. The formation of the azametallabicyclic compound and the adduct upon treatment with excess pyridine further supports the role of the complex as an alkylidyne synthon.

An alkylidyne analogue of Tebbe's reagent was successfully synthesized and characterized, which is a significant achievement as examples of such species were elusive until this work. The study demonstrates that an alkylidyne moiety in the complex [(PNP)TiCtBu] (A) can be stabilized with Al(CH3)3, forming the first instance of a Lewis acid stabilized Group4 alkylidyne. The reaction pathway involves incomplete 1,2-aluminium addition across the titanium-carbon bond, leading to the formation of a complex where aluminium is attached to the titanium atom via a bridging methyl group. The synthesis of the complex [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)CC4H4NH}] (4) through the treatment of the aluminium-stabilized alkylidyne with excess pyridine supports the concept of the alkylidyne being a synthonic precursor to A. Similarly, treatment of the complex with B(OCH3)3 results in the formation of the alkylidene methoxide complex [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)B(OCH3)2}(OCH3)] (5), indicating its reactivity towards milder electrophiles.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two primary schemes: two-site and one-site. In the two-site mechanism, the activation of an alkane occurs through the formation of an alkene and a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This process leads to the rearrangement of the alkane structure, resulting in the conversion of linear to cyclic alkane forms or vice versa. The one-site mechanism involves a single-step transition state where the activation and deactivation occur simultaneously, leading to the direct conversion of the alkane without the formation of an intermediate metallacyclobutane.

Key intermediates in this mechanism include alkenes, which are formed during the initial activation step, and metallacyclobutanes, which play a crucial role in facilitating the rearrangement of the alkane structure. The selectivity of the alkane metathesis reactions is influenced by the catalyst's ability to control the activation and deactivation steps efficiently. The catalyst performance is optimized by ensuring a stable and active state that allows for facile substrate binding and release, minimizing side reactions and promoting the desired alkane conversions.

The role of the catalyst, silica-supported tantalum hydrides, is to provide a surface for the effective adsorption of alkane molecules, facilitating the activation process. The specific properties of the catalyst, such as its surface area, acidity, and stability, contribute to its performance in various alkane conversions. The catalyst's ability to sequester the Lewis acid while simultaneously acting as a substrate for the nucleophilic {TiCtBu} ligand is crucial for the mechanism's success, ensuring that the alkane metathesis occurs efficiently and selectively.

烷烃裂合由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化涉及两种主要机制：双位点和单位点。在双位点机制中，烷烃的激活通过形成烯烃和金属环丁烷中间体发生。这导致烷烃结构的重组，导致线性到环烷烃形式或反之亦然的转换。单一机制涉及一步过渡态，在此过程中，激活和去活同时发生，导致直接将烷烃转换为无中间金属环丁烷。

该机制的关键中间体包括烯烃，在初始激活步骤中形成，以及金属环丁烷，它在促进烷烃结构重排中起着关键作用。烷烃裂合反应的选择性受到催化剂控制激活和去活步骤效率的影响。催化剂性能的优化通过确保易于吸附基底并释放，同时最小化副反应并促进所需的烷烃转换来实现。

催化剂二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的作用是提供一个表面，用于有效吸附烷烃分子，从而促进激活过程。催化剂的特定性质，如比表面积、酸性和稳定性，对其在各种烷烃转换中的性能至关重要。催化剂能够同时保留路易斯酸并作为{TiCtBu}亲核配体的底物的角色对于机制的成功至关重要，确保烷烃裂合高效且选择性地进行。
