[1] "Our inability to trap the alkylidyne moiety in A by addition of Lewis bases, such as PR3 (R=CH3, Ph), THF, HMPA (hexamethyl phosphoramide), OP(CH3)3, and pyridines,7,8 prompted us to investigate whether the nucleophilic nature in the TiC linkage could be sequestered by a Lewis acid, such as Al(CH3)3."
[2] "Tebbe and co-workers reported an analogous reaction involving [Cp2Ti(CH3)2] and Al(CH3)3 to afford [Cp2Ti{CH2Al(CH3)3}], which was characterized spectroscopically.3 However, this zwitterion was never generated in pure form and was contaminated by residual dimethyl precursor.3"
[3] "We treated compound 16 with neat or stoichiometric Al(CH3)3, at low temperatures, which resulted in immediate formation of the zwitterionic complex [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)Al(CH3)3}] (2) concurrent with CH3tBu extrusion."
[4] "Complex 2 has been characterized by 1H, 13C, 31P, and 27Al NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, as well as by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies."
[5] "Formation of 2 might proceed by incomplete 1,2-Al addition of Al(CH3)3 across the TiC linkage of putative A (Scheme1, PathA)."
[6] "As a result, we speculate that PathsB and C are operative in these reactions, and that a naked alkylidyne intermediate, PathA, is not generated in these reactions."
[7] "Treatment of 2 with excess pyridine at 40C over 2days results in quantitative conversion into the known azametallabicyclic compound [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)CC4H4NH}] (4)8 and the adduct [(CH3)3Al(NC5H5)] (Scheme2).9"
[8] "The solid-state structure of 5 (Figure1)14 is a six-coordinate TiIV alkylidene species (TiC, δ=323.7ppm), in which of one of the methoxy groups has migrated from boron to the metal center."

An alkylidyne analogue of Tebbe's reagent was successfully synthesized and characterized, which is a significant achievement as examples of such species were elusive until this work. The study demonstrates that an alkylidyne moiety in the complex [(PNP)TiCtBu] (A) can be stabilized with Al(CH3)3, forming the first instance of a Lewis acid stabilized Group4 alkylidyne. The reaction pathway involves incomplete 1,2-aluminium addition across the titanium-carbon bond, leading to the formation of a complex where aluminium is attached to the titanium atom via a bridging methyl group. The synthesis of the complex [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)CC4H4NH}] (4) through the treatment of the aluminium-stabilized alkylidyne with excess pyridine supports the concept of the alkylidyne being a synthonic precursor to A. Similarly, treatment of the complex with B(OCH3)3 results in the formation of the alkylidene methoxide complex [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)B(OCH3)2}(OCH3)] (5), indicating its reactivity towards milder electrophiles.

成功合成了并表征了一种Tebbe试剂的烷基二烯类衍生物，这是一个重要的成果，因为这种类型的物种直到这项工作之前都很少见。研究结果表明，在[(PNP)TiCtBu]（A）中可以利用Al(CH3)3稳定一个烷基二烯基，形成第一例Lewis酸稳定的第4组烷基二烯基。反应途径涉及不完全的1,2-铝插入到钛碳键中，导致形成一个铝通过桥接甲基团连接到钛原子的复合物。通过过量吡啶处理该复合物，得到[(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)CC4H4NH}]（4），进一步支持了烷基二烯基作为A前体的合成子的概念。同样，将该复合物与B(OCH3)3处理后，形成[(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)B(OCH3)2}(OCH3)]（5）的烷基二烯氧基化合物，表明其对较温和的亲电体具有反应性。
