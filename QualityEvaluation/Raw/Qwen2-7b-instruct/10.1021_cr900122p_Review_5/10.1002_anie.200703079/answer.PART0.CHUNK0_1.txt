[1] "An Alkylidyne Analogue of Tebbe's Reagent: Trapping Reactions of a Titanium Neopentylidyne"
[2] "The solid-state structure for the zwitterionic species [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)Al(CH3)3}] as well as the product resulting from BO bond cleavage across the TiC moiety in A are also presented and discussed."
[3] "We found that compound 2 can be prepared from [(PNP)TiCHtBu(Ph)] (3) and Al(CH3)3 over several minutes at 25C (Scheme1)."
[4] "As a result, we speculate that PathsB and C are operative in these reactions, and that a naked alkylidyne intermediate, PathA, is not generated in these reactions."
[5] "Treatment of 2 with excess pyridine at 40C over 2days results in quantitative conversion into the known azametallabicyclic compound [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)CC4H4NH}] (4)8 and the adduct [(CH3)3Al(NC5H5)] (Scheme2)."

The literature discusses the preparation and characterization of an alkylidyne analogue of Tebbe's reagent, focusing on its trapping reactions and the formation of the titanium alkylidyne complex. The synthesis of the complex involves incomplete addition of trimethylaluminum across a {TiCtBu} moiety, leading to the stabilization of an alkylidyne moiety. The complex's stability and reactivity are highlighted, including its ability to extrude the Al(CH3)3 protecting group in the presence of pyridine, acting as a naked titanium alkylidyne. The formation of the azametallabicyclic compound and the adduct upon treatment with excess pyridine further supports the role of the complex as an alkylidyne synthon.

文献讨论了Tebbe试剂烷基异氰酸酯类似物的制备与表征，重点探讨了其捕获反应和钛烷基异氰酸酯复合物的形成。合成过程中涉及三甲基铝对TiCtBu基团的不完整添加，导致烷基异氰酸酯基团的稳定化。该复合物的稳定性和反应性得到了强调，包括在吡啶存在下脱除Al(CH3)3保护基团的能力，作为裸露的钛烷基异氰酸酯。通过与过量吡啶的处理，形成含氮金属环化合物和衍生物进一步证实了该复合物作为烷基异氰酸酯前体的作用。
