[1] "We report that an alkylidyne moiety in [(PNP)TiCtBu] (A; PNP=[2-{P(CHMe2)2}-4-methylphenyl]2N), generated from [(PNP)TiCHtBu(CH2tBu)] (1),6 can be conveniently stabilized with Al(CH3)3 to afford the first example of a Lewis acid stabilized Group4 alkylidyne [(PNP)Ti{C(tBu)Al(CH3)3}] (2)."
[2] "Our studies suggest that Al(CH3)3 likely accelerates α-hydrogen abstraction in the process of making compound 2."
[3] "Complex 2, a masked alkylidyne titanium compound, also ring-opens pyridine."

[5] "Tebbe's reagent was one of the first reported early-transition-metal systems to perform olefin metathesis in a catalytic manner."
[6] "This result does support the notion that 2 is a synthon to A, but only when the reagent can sequester the Lewis acid while simultaneously acting as a substrate for the nucleophilic {TiCtBu} ligand."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two primary schemes: two-site and one-site. In the two-site mechanism, the activation of an alkane occurs through the formation of an alkene and a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This process leads to the rearrangement of the alkane structure, resulting in the conversion of linear to cyclic alkane forms or vice versa. The one-site mechanism involves a single-step transition state where the activation and deactivation occur simultaneously, leading to the direct conversion of the alkane without the formation of an intermediate metallacyclobutane.

Key intermediates in this mechanism include alkenes, which are formed during the initial activation step, and metallacyclobutanes, which play a crucial role in facilitating the rearrangement of the alkane structure. The selectivity of the alkane metathesis reactions is influenced by the catalyst's ability to control the activation and deactivation steps efficiently. The catalyst performance is optimized by ensuring a stable and active state that allows for facile substrate binding and release, minimizing side reactions and promoting the desired alkane conversions.

The role of the catalyst, silica-supported tantalum hydrides, is to provide a surface for the effective adsorption of alkane molecules, facilitating the activation process. The specific properties of the catalyst, such as its surface area, acidity, and stability, contribute to its performance in various alkane conversions. The catalyst's ability to sequester the Lewis acid while simultaneously acting as a substrate for the nucleophilic {TiCtBu} ligand is crucial for the mechanism's success, ensuring that the alkane metathesis occurs efficiently and selectively.

烷烃裂合由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化涉及两种主要机制：双位点和单位点。在双位点机制中，烷烃的激活通过形成烯烃和金属环丁烷中间体发生。这导致烷烃结构的重组，导致线性到环烷烃形式或反之亦然的转换。单一机制涉及一步过渡态，在此过程中，激活和去活同时发生，导致直接将烷烃转换为无中间金属环丁烷。

该机制的关键中间体包括烯烃，在初始激活步骤中形成，以及金属环丁烷，它在促进烷烃结构重排中起着关键作用。烷烃裂合反应的选择性受到催化剂控制激活和去活步骤效率的影响。催化剂性能的优化通过确保易于吸附基底并释放，同时最小化副反应并促进所需的烷烃转换来实现。

催化剂二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的作用是提供一个表面，用于有效吸附烷烃分子，从而促进激活过程。催化剂的特定性质，如比表面积、酸性和稳定性，对其在各种烷烃转换中的性能至关重要。催化剂能够同时保留路易斯酸并作为{TiCtBu}亲核配体的底物的角色对于机制的成功至关重要，确保烷烃裂合高效且选择性地进行。
