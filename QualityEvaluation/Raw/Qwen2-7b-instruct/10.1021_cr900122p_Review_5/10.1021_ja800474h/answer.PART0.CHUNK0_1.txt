The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the carbene hydride mechanism, which is evaluated through a DFT study. This mechanism considers both two-site and one-site schemes, along with the processes involved in transforming linear and cyclic alkanes. Key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes are formed during these reactions. These processes contribute to the reaction's selectivity and enhance the performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
