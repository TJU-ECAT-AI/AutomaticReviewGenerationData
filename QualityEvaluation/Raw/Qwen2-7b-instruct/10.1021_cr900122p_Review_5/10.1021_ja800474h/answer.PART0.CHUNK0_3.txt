The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides is analyzed in the study, focusing on both two-site and one-site schemes. This mechanism involves the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes, with alkenes and metallacyclobutanes serving as key intermediates. The factors contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are also considered.
