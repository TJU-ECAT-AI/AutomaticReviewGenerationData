The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides was evaluated through a DFT study. This research considered both two-site and one-site schemes, examined linear and cyclic alkane transformations, and discussed the formation of key intermediates including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These processes contribute to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in different alkane conversions.
