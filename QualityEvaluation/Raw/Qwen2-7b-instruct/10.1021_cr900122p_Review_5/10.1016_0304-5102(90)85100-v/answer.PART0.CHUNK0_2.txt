[L31] "It is well established that the conversion of lower alkanes into aro- matics is considerably enhanced by the introduction of gallium or zinc into HZSM-5 zeolites."
[L32] "Furthermore,it was shown that H, was heterolytically dissociated over Gaz03."
[L33] "Over Ga,O,-HZSM-5 zeolites,additional dehydrogenation of propane occurred over Ga*O,"
[L34] "Indeed,by converting the GazOs-Na form (sample A) into the Ga20s-H form (sample A) a two-fold increase in the rate of dehydrogenation into propene is observed."
[L35] "Consequently, the conjugated effect of gallium oxide and proton is to bypass the slow step (4): GaOCsH, --+ GaOH + C&H,which is replaced by the fast equilibrium (6)."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported gallium oxide involves three distinct processes:

1. Over HZSM-5, the formation of C3H,+ carbenium ions through hydride abstraction is the slow and limiting step.

2. Over gallium oxide, C&l, is rapidly dissociatively adsorbed on the surface to produce a surface gallium alkoxide intermediate, GaOCsH,. The decomposition of this intermediate into C,H, and GaOH is the slow, limiting step.

3. Over Ga,O,-HZSM-5, surface alkyl migration and exchange between GaOC3H7 and HZ are rapidly established, thus bypassing the slow processes (i) and (ii).

The formation of C3H,+ on Zn++ ions in ZSM-5 has already been suggested. Similar results and mechanisms will be reported subsequently.

烷烃互变异构由硅负载镓氧化物催化，涉及三个不同的过程：

1. 在HZSM-5上，通过氢化物抽取形成C3H,+离子是缓慢且限制性的步骤。

2. 在镓氧化物上，C&l,迅速地在表面上分解为表面镓醇基中间体GaOCsH,。此中间体的分解成C,H,和GaOH是缓慢且限制性的步骤。

3. 在Ga,O,-HZSM-5上，表面烷基迁移和GaOC3H7与HZ之间的交换迅速建立，从而绕过了缓慢的过程（i）和（ii）。

在ZSM-5中已经提出了Zn++离子形成C3H,+离子的结果和机制。后续将报告类似的结果和机制。
