[1] "It has been shown that GazOs has an intrinsic catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation [8,9]."
[2] "Consequently, the conjugated effect of gallium oxide and proton is to bypass the slow step (4): GaOCsH, --+ GaOH + C&H,which is replaced by the fast equilibrium (6)."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context of this document, the focus is on the dehydrogenation of propane over gallium oxide-supported zeolites (Ga203-HZSM-5). Key steps include the formation of a gallium alkoxide intermediate, which rapidly exchanges with a zeolite proton to form the classical propyl carbenium ion. This process leads to the formation of propene through the breakdown of the carbenium ion, releasing hydrogen. Three distinct mechanisms for propane dehydrogenation are identified: 
(i) Over HZSM-5, the formation of C3H+ carbenium ions through hydride abstraction is the slow and limiting step.
(ii) Over Ga203, C&l, is rapidly dissociatively adsorbed on the surface to produce a surface gallium alkoxide intermediate, GaOCsH,. The decomposition of this intermediate into C,H, and GaOH is the slow, limiting step.
(iii) Over Ga203-HZSM-5, surface alkyl migration and exchange between GaOC3H7 and HZ are rapidly established, thus bypassing the slow processes (i) and (ii).

This mechanism contributes to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions by efficiently converting propane to propene through a series of well-defined steps, highlighting the synergistic effects of gallium oxide and proton acidity.

催化硅支持的钽氢化物的烷烃互变异构机制涉及双站点和单站点方案。在此文档的背景下，重点是Ga203-HZSM-5催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机制。关键步骤包括形成镓醇盐中间体，随后迅速与沸石质子交换生成经典的丙基碳正离子。这一过程导致通过分解碳正离子释放氢气形成丙烯。识别出三种不同的丙烷脱氢机制：
(i) 在HZSM-5上，通过氢原子摘除形成的C3H+碳正离子是缓慢且限制性的步骤。
(ii) 在Ga203上，C&l迅速在表面吸附并产生表面镓醇盐中间体GaOCsH。该中间体的分解成C,H和GaOH是缓慢且限制性的步骤。
(iii) 在Ga203-HZSM-5上，表面烷基迁移和GaOC3H7与HZ之间的交换迅速建立，从而绕过了缓慢的步骤(i)和(ii)。

这种机制通过一系列明确的步骤高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，突显了镓氧化物和酸性质子的协同效应，从而为各种烷烃转化提供了选择性和催化剂性能。
