[L31] "It is well established that the conversion of lower alkanes into aromatics is considerably enhanced by the introduction of gallium or zinc into HZSM-5 zeolites [l - 71. It is agreed that over HZSM-5, the dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the concurrent cracking reaction into methane and ethene are catalyzed by protons."
[L32] "Recent publications have indicated that over Ga,O,-HZSM-5 zeolites, additional dehydrogenation of propane occurred over Ga*O,[8, 91. Furthermore, it was shown that H, was heterolytically dissociated over Gaz03 [lo]."
[L33] "Since it was considered that the dehydrogenation of propane is difficult over H+ but rather rapid over Zn2+-HZSM-5 [2] or Ga-HZSM-5 [3, 51, factors such as the zinc or gallium content would increasingly influence the conversion of propane."
[L34] "In order to study the role of H+ and GazOs in the formation of propene from propane, it was important to minimize the consecutive oligomerization and aromatization of the propene."
[L35] "When both Ga,O, and H+ are present within the catalyst, one can assume that the propyl carbenium species formed by reaction (3) over gallium oxide will readily exchange with a zeolite proton through an alkyl surface migration reaction."
[L36] "The above mechanism would account for the enhanced dehydrogenating activity of Ga,O,-HZSM-5 in comparison to HZSM-5 and Ga-NaZSM-5 catalysts, and indeed is compatible with all the experimental findings."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the roles of both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context of the provided literature, the focus is on gallium oxide (Ga2O3)-supported zeolites, specifically HZSM-5, for the dehydrogenation of propane into propene. The mechanism elucidates how the presence of gallium oxide and protons interact to enhance the dehydrogenating activity of the catalyst.

Two-step processes are discussed for the dehydrogenation of propane:
1. Over HZSM-5, the formation of C3H+ carbenium ions through hydride abstraction is the slow and limiting step.
2. Over Ga2O3, C3H is rapidly dissociatively adsorbed on the surface to produce a surface gallium alkoxide intermediate, GaOC3H. The decomposition of this intermediate into C3H and GaOH is the slow, limiting step.
3. Over Ga2O3-HZSM-5, surface alkyl migration and exchange between GaOC3H and HZ are rapidly established, thus bypassing the slow processes of steps 1 and 2.

Key intermediates in the mechanism include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Alkenes are formed through the breakdown of the carbenium ion, releasing H+. The role of these intermediates is crucial in determining reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The mechanism accounts for the enhanced dehydrogenating activity of Ga2O3-HZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 and Ga-NaZSM-5 catalysts, aligning with all experimental findings.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃互变异构机制涉及理解两站点和单一站点方案的作用。在提供的文献中，重点放在了用于脱氢丙烷为丙烯的镓氧化物（Ga2O3）-支持的沸石催化剂。机制解释了镓氧化物和质子的存在如何增强催化剂的脱氢活性。

描述了脱氢丙烷的两个步骤过程：
1. 在HZSM-5上，通过氢化物抽取形成的C3H+离子是缓慢且限制性的步骤。
2. 在Ga2O3上，C3H迅速在表面上吸附分解，产生表面镓醇化合物中间体GaOC3H。该中间体的分解成C3H和GaOH是缓慢且限制性的步骤。
3. 在Ga2O3-HZSM-5上，表面烷基迁移和GaOC3H与HZ之间的交换迅速发生，从而绕过了步骤1和2的缓慢过程。

机制中的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。通过分解碳正离子释放H+形成烯烃。这些中间体在确定各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。该机制解释了与HZSM-5和Ga-NaZSM-5催化剂相比，Ga2O3-HZSM-5的增强脱氢活性，并与所有实验结果相吻合。
