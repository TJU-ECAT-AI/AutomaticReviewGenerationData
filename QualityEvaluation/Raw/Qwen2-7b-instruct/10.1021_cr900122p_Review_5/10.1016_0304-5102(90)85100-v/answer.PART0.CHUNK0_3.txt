[1] "The Role of Ga203 and Proton Acidity on the Dehydrogenating Activity of Ga,03-HZSM-5 Catalysts: Evidence of a Bifunctional Mechanism"
[2] "It is well established that the conversion of lower alkanes into aromatics is considerably enhanced by the introduction of gallium or zinc into HZSM-5 zeolites."
[3] "Furthermore,it was shown that H, was heterolytically dissociated over Gaz03 [lo]."
[4] "The striking feature ob- served in this study is the role of the acidity on the apparent activity of GazOs for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[5] "Indeed,by converting the GazOs-Na form (sample A) into the Ga20s-H form (sample A) a two-fold increase in the rate of dehydrogenation into propene is observed."
[6] "On HZSM-5 the formation of propene from propane has been interpreted as follows:"
[7] "C,Hs + H+ - CsH,+ + H,(1)"
[8] "C3H,+ -
CsH, + H+ (2)"
[9] "H-
CsH,+ Ga+-O---Ga+ + C3Hs _ G!ax+-&--Gax+ (3)"
[10] "These alkoxides would decompose further to form dehydrogenation products and H+ bound to surface oxygen."
[11] "When both Ga,O, and H+ are present within the catalyst, one can assume that the propyl carbenium species formed by reaction (3) over gallium oxide will readily exchange with a zeolite proton through an alkyl surface migration reaction:"
[12] "Prop- ylene thus resulted from the rapidly established equilibrium:"
[13] "C3H,+Z -
CsH, + H+Z (7)"
[14] "Consequently, the conjugated effect of gallium oxide and proton is to bypass the slow step (4): GaOCsH, --+ GaOH + C&H,which is replaced by the fast equilibrium (6)."
[15] "This is a reasonable assumption in view of the high mobility of protons in zeolites, and the high instability of gallium alkyl compounds [ 121."
[16] "Prop- ylene thus resulted from the rapidly established equilibrium:"
[17] "C3H,+Z -
CsH, + H+Z (7)"

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported gallium oxide (Ga203) and proton acidity on HZSM-5 zeolites reveals a bifunctional mechanism. This process involves the conversion of lower alkanes into aromatics, significantly enhanced by gallium or zinc incorporation into HZSM-5 zeolites. The dehydrogenation of propane into propene and concurrent cracking into methane and ethene is catalyzed by protons. The acidity of HZSM-5, characterized by aluminum content, influences the conversion rate of propane. Gallium oxide-supported zeolites show additional dehydrogenation of propane over Ga203, indicating better intrinsic dehydrogenating properties of gallium in Ga203-HZSM-5 catalysts compared to pure Ga203. The bifunctional mechanism suggests that both gallium oxide and protons intervene in the formation of propene from propane. Gallium alkoxide intermediates rapidly exchange with zeolite protons to form propyl carbenium ions, leading to propene formation through the release of hydrogen. This mechanism accounts for the enhanced dehydrogenating activity of Ga203-HZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 and GaNaZSM-5 catalysts, as observed in experimental findings.

在硅基镓氧化物（Ga203）和HZSM-5沸石的酸性作用下催化烷烃互变异构的全面机制揭示了一种双功能机制。这一过程涉及将低级烷烃转化为芳烃，通过在HZSM-5沸石中加入镓或锌显著增强。丙烷脱氢为丙烯以及同时裂解为甲烷和乙烯由质子催化。HZSM-5的酸度，由铝含量表征，影响丙烷的转化率。含有镓氧化物的沸石显示了在Ga203-HZSM-5催化剂中额外的丙烷脱氢作用，表明了镓在Ga203-HZSM-5催化剂中的内在脱氢化性质比纯Ga203更好。双功能机制表明，镓氧化物和质子都参与了丙烷转化为丙烯的过程。镓醇中间体迅速与沸石质子交换形成丙基碳正离子，导致丙烯通过释放氢气形成。这一机制解释了与HZSM-5和GaNaZSM-5催化剂相比，Ga203-HZSM-5催化剂表现出增强的脱氢活性，在实验结果中观察到这一点。
