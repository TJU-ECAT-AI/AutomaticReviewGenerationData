[1] "It has been shown that GazOs has an intrinsic catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation [8,9]."
[2] "Thus, one could conclude that the higher dehydrogenation activity of Ga,Os supported on HZSM-5 over the GazOs- NaZSM-5 catalyst was due to a better dispersion of the gallium oxide phase."
[3] "On HZSM-5 the formation of propene from propane has been interpreted as follows"
[4] "C,Hs + H+ - CsH,+ + H,(1)"

[6] "When both Ga,O, and H+ are present within the catalyst, one can assume that the propyl carbenium species formed by reaction (3) over gallium oxide will readily exchange with a zeolite proton through an alkyl surface migration reaction:"
[7] "This is a reasonable assumption in view of the high mobility of protons in zeolites, and the high instability of gallium alkyl compounds [ 121."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context of this literature, the focus is on the dehydrogenation of propane over gallium oxide supported on HZSM-5 zeolite. The process involves the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. 

Linear alkane transformations are characterized by the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds, leading to the formation of alkenes. Cyclic alkane transformations involve ring-opening reactions, which may lead to the formation of metallacyclobutanes. The formation of these intermediates plays a crucial role in determining the reaction selectivity and the overall performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

The dehydrogenation of propane over gallium oxide supported on HZSM-5 zeolite occurs through a gallium alkoxide intermediate. This intermediate rapidly exchanges with a zeolite proton to form the classical propyl carbenium ion. Propene is formed through the breakdown of this carbenium ion, releasing H+. This mechanism accounts for the enhanced dehydrogenating activity of Ga20s-HZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 and Ga-NaZSM-5 catalysts.

The role of the acidity of the zeolite in enhancing the dehydrogenation activity of gallium oxide is also discussed. The acidity affects the surface area of the supported oxide phase, which in turn influences the reaction kinetics and the selectivity towards propene formation.

The catalytic mechanism involves several steps:
1. Formation of alkyl carbenium ions through hydride abstraction over HZSM-5.
2. Rapid dissociative adsorption of C3H, on the surface of Ga20s to produce a surface gallium alkoxide intermediate.
3. Decomposition of this intermediate into C,H, and GaOH, which is the slow, limiting step over Ga20s.
4. Surface alkyl migration and exchange between GaOC3H7 and HZ, which rapidly establishes equilibrium over Ga20s-HZSM-5, bypassing the slow processes.

In conclusion, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves complex interactions between the catalyst components, including gallium oxide, protons, and alkyl groups. These interactions determine the reaction pathways, product distributions, and overall performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

该文献详细阐述了由硅酸盐支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃互变异构的全面机制，涉及双站点和单站点方案。在此背景下，重点讨论了在HZSM-5沸石上镓氧化物的丙烷脱氢过程。这一过程涉及到烯烃和金属环丁烷等关键中间体的形成。

线性烷烃转化表现为碳-碳键断裂，导致烯烃的形成。环状烷烃转化涉及环的打开反应，可能导致金属环丁烷的形成。这些中间体的形成对确定烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂的整体性能至关重要。

在HZSM-5沸石上，镓氧化物支持的丙烷脱氢通过镓醇中间体进行。该中间体迅速与沸石质子交换，形成经典的丙基碳正离子。丙烯通过分解这种碳正离子释放出H+而形成。这一机制解释了与纯HZSM-5和Ga-NaZSM-5催化剂相比，Ga20s-HZSM-5在丙烷脱氢方面的增强活性。

酸度对沸石的影响增强了镓氧化物的脱氢活性。酸度影响支持的氧化物相的表面积，进而影响反应动力学和丙烯形成的选择性。

催化机制涉及以下几个步骤：
1. 在HZSM-5上通过氢化物提取形成烷基碳正离子。
2. 镓20s表面快速吸附C3H，产生表面镓醇中间体。
3. 这个中间体分解成C,H，和GaOH，在Ga20s上是缓慢、限制性的步骤。
4. 表面烷基迁移和GaOC3H7与HZ之间的交换，Ga20s-HZSM-5上迅速建立平衡，从而绕过了缓慢的过程。

综上所述，硅酸盐支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃互变异构的全面机制涉及催化剂成分之间复杂的相互作用，包括镓氧化物、质子和烷基团。这些相互作用决定了反应途径、产物分布和催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的整体性能。
