[1] "We have previously reported that the silica-supported tantalum hydride1 [(·SiO)2TaH] 1 catalyzes a new reaction of alkane metathesis which transforms any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues (eqn. (1))."
[2] "The following experiment illustrates these two new catalytic reactions. When a (3.7/97.6) molar mixture of toluene and ethane was heated in the presence of 1 (50 mg; 5 wt% Ta), at 250 C, under atmospheric pressure in a batch reactor (300 ml), besides methane, propane and butanes arising from the self-metathesis of ethane, ethylbenzene but also the various xylenes were produced."
[3] "Ethylbenzene and xylenes can arise from the cross-metathesis between toluene and ethane (eqn. (2)) but also from the self metathesis of toluene (eqn. (3)) although they have not been evidenced during blank experiments."
[4] "In the case of ethylbenzene, the reaction proceeds via a cross s-bond metathesis between the (sp3)CH bond of the aromatic methyl and the (sp3)C(sp3)C bond of ethane; in the case of xylenes, it occurs via a cross s-bond metathesis between the (sp2)CH bonds of the aromatic ring and the (sp3)C(sp3)C of ethane."
[5] "This leads to a mixture of tantalumethyl [(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5], benzyl [(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5] or methylphenyl [(·SiO)2Ta C6H4CH3] complexes which have been effectively identified by 13C CP MAS NMR."
[6] "The last step common to all cycles is the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either an ethane or a toluene molecule to regenerate the key intermediates: the tantalumethyl, benzyl or methylphenyl complexes."
[7] "Conversely, when the partial pressure of toluene was increased (Table 1, entries 6 and 7), the respective concentrations of [(·SiO)2Ta CH2C6H5] and [(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3] were increased. The TON of toluene increased and the self-metathesis of ethane decreased accordingly."
[8] "These data are consistent with the relative dependence of the surface species concentration on the partial pressures of both reagents as depicted in Scheme 1. As the pressure of ethane increases, formation of [(·SiO)2TaCH2CH3] is favoured at the expense of [(·SiO)2Ta CH2C6H5] and [(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3] and thereby self-metathesis of ethane is favoured at the expense of cross-metathesis."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. In the case of two-site mechanisms, the catalyst facilitates the breaking and forming of carbon-carbon (CC) bonds between different molecules, specifically between an alkane and an aromatic compound. For instance, in the cross-metathesis reaction between toluene and ethane, ethylbenzene and xylenes are formed. The reaction proceeds via cross s-bond metathesis between the (sp3)CH bond of the aromatic methyl and the (sp3)C(sp3)C bond of ethane for ethylbenzene, and between the (sp2)CH bonds of the aromatic ring and the (sp3)C(sp3)C of ethane for xylenes. The key intermediates formed are tantalumethyl, benzyl, and methylphenyl complexes, which are identified by 13C CP MAS NMR spectroscopy.

The mechanism also involves the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either an ethane or a toluene molecule, regenerating the key intermediates. The performance of the catalyst is influenced by the partial pressures of the reactants, with the formation of different surface species being favored based on the pressures. Higher pressures of toluene lead to an increase in the formation of the benzyl and methylphenyl complexes, whereas increasing the pressure of ethane favors the formation of the tert-butyl complex, leading to a decrease in the self-metathesis of ethane and an increase in the cross-metathesis reaction.

This mechanism contributes to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions, as the balance between self-metathesis and cross-metathesis depends on the relative pressures of the reactants, affecting the yield of desired products.

催化硅负载的钽氢化物的烷烃交叉裂合机制涉及理解双位点和单位点方案。在双位点机制中，催化剂促进不同分子之间碳碳（CC）键的断裂和形成，特别是烷烃和芳香化合物之间。例如，在甲苯与乙烷之间的交叉裂合反应中，乙基苯和二甲苯形成。对于乙基苯，反应通过交叉s键裂合在芳香甲基的（sp3）CH键与乙烷的（sp3）C（sp3）C键之间进行；对于二甲苯，它发生在芳香环的（sp2）CH键与乙烷的（sp3）C（sp3）C之间。关键中间体是钽甲基、苄基和甲基苯基复合物，这些可以通过13C CP MAS NMR光谱法识别。

该机制还涉及从钽中移除甲基团，由乙烷或甲苯分子再生关键中间体。催化剂的性能受反应物分压的影响，不同的表面物种基于分压被优先形成。增加甲苯的压力导致苯基和甲基苯基复合物的形成增加，而增加乙烷压力有利于形成叔丁基复合物，从而减少自身裂解并增加交叉裂合反应。

这种机制对各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能有贡献，因为自我裂解与交叉裂合之间的平衡取决于反应物的相对压力，影响所需产品的产率。
