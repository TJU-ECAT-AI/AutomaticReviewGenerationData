Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. In this context, the mechanism includes the transformation of any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues through the cleavage and formation of (sp3)C(sp3)C bonds. The reaction between toluene and ethane, for instance, leads to the simultaneous formation of ethylbenzene and xylenes, illustrating the role of cross-metathesis reactions in this catalytic process. Key intermediates formed, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The formation of ethylbenzene and xylenes involves a cross s-bond metathesis between the (sp3)CH bond of the aromatic methyl and the (sp3)C(sp3)C bond of ethane for ethylbenzene, and between the (sp2)CH bonds of the aromatic ring and the (sp3)C(sp3)C of ethane for xylenes. These reactions are part of a larger catalytic cycle involving the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either an ethane or a toluene molecule, leading to the regeneration of key intermediates: the tantalumethyl, benzyl, or methylphenyl complexes.

The performance of the catalyst is influenced by factors such as the concentration of the reactants, the presence of hydrogen, and the partial pressures of both reagents, as demonstrated by the number of turnovers (TON) and the selectivities of the products obtained under different conditions.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides encompasses the conversion of acyclic alkanes into higher and lower homologues, the formation of key intermediates, and the role of cross-metathesis reactions in the selective production of ethylbenzene and xylenes. The performance of the catalyst is optimized by controlling factors such as the reactant concentrations, hydrogen presence, and partial pressures.
