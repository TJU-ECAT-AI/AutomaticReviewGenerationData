[1] "We have previously reported that the silica-supported tantalum hydride [(·SiO)2TaH] 1 catalyzes a new reaction of alkane metathesis which transforms any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues."
[2] "The following experiment illustrates these two new catalytic reactions. When a (3.7/97.6) molar mixture of toluene and ethane was heated in the presence of 1 (50 mg; 5 wt% Ta), at 250 C, under atmospheric pressure in a batch reactor (300 ml), besides methane, propane and butanes arising from the self-metathesis of ethane, ethylbenzene but also the various xylenes were produced."
[3] "In the case of ethylbenzene, the reaction proceeds via a cross s-bond metathesis between the (sp3)CH bond of the aromatic methyl and the (sp3)C(sp3)C bond of ethane; in the case of xylenes, it occurs via a cross s-bond metathesis between the (sp2)CH bonds of the aromatic ring and the (sp3)C(sp3)C of ethane."
[4] "Both reactions begin by a C-H bond activation with liberation of molecular hydrogen. This activation step involves a competition between the two reagents, e.g. ethane and toluene, as well as between the two types of CH bonds in the toluene molecule, e.g. in the methyl group or on the aromatic ring."
[5] "As the pressure of ethane increases, formation of [(·SiO)2TaCH2CH3] is favoured at the expense of [(·SiO)2Ta CH2C6H5] and [(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3] and thereby self-metathesis of ethane is favoured at the expense of cross-metathesis."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the role of both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in transforming linear and cyclic alkanes, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism starts with C-H bond activation, leading to the liberation of molecular hydrogen. This activation step involves a competition between the reactants, ethane and toluene, as well as between the different types of C-H bonds within the toluene molecule. Silica-supported tantalum hydrides facilitate the cross-metathesis reaction between toluene and ethane, resulting in the formation of ethylbenzene and xylenes.

The formation of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, plays a crucial role in the catalytic process. These intermediates are formed through the cleavage and formation of C-C bonds, contributing to the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes. The catalyst's performance is influenced by factors like reaction selectivity, which is determined by the balance between the rates of different reaction pathways, such as self-metathesis of ethane versus cross-metathesis between ethane and toluene.

Increasing the pressure of ethane leads to a shift in the formation of intermediates, favoring the formation of ethylbenzene over xylenes. This is because higher ethane pressure favors the formation of [(·SiO)2TaCH2CH3] intermediates, which are more prone to undergoing cross-metathesis with toluene, thus promoting the formation of ethylbenzene.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex interplay of bond activation, intermediates formation, and reaction pathway selection, which collectively determine the efficiency and product distribution in various alkane conversions.

全面分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合机制，需要理解双位点和单位点方案的作用、线性与环状烷烃转化过程、关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其在各种烷烃转换中对反应选择性和催化剂性能的影响。

机制始于C-H键的激活，导致分子氢的释放。此激活步骤涉及乙烷和苯乙烯等反应物之间的竞争，以及苯乙烯分子内不同类型的C-H键之间。二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物促进乙烷和苯乙烯之间的交叉裂合反应，产生乙基苯和二甲苯。

关键中间体的形成，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，在催化过程中起着至关重要的作用。这些中间体通过C-C键的断裂和形成而产生，从而促进了线性与环状烷烃的转化。催化剂的性能受反应选择性等因素影响，这取决于不同反应途径速率的平衡，如乙烷自裂合与乙烷和苯乙烯之间的交叉裂合。

增加乙烷的压力导致中间体的形成发生偏移，更倾向于形成乙基苯而不是二甲苯。这是因为更高的乙烷压力有利于形成[(·SiO)2TaCH2CH3]中间体，这些中间体更容易进行与苯乙烯的交叉裂合，从而促进乙基苯的形成。

总之，由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合机制涉及复杂的键激活、中间体形成和反应路径选择的相互作用，这些共同决定了各种烷烃转换的效率和产物分布。
