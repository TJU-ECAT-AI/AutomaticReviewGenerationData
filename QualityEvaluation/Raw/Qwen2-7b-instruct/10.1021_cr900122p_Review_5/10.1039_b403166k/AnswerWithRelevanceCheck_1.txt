Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes, processes of linear and cyclic alkane transformations, and the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The catalyst [(·SiO)2TaH] facilitates the cross-metathesis reaction between toluene and ethane, producing ethylbenzene and xylenes. It can transform any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues, with the mechanism including C-H bond activation followed by reaction with ethane to generate various products. The catalyst's ability to control product selectivity through kinetic considerations and its influence by factors such as the concentration of reactants and hydrogen presence are critical aspects of its performance in various alkane conversions.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides encompasses the transformation of acyclic alkanes into higher and lower homologues, the formation of key intermediates, and the role of cross-metathesis reactions in the selective production of ethylbenzene and xylenes. The performance of the catalyst is optimized by controlling factors such as reactant concentrations, hydrogen presence, and partial pressures.
