[1] "We have previously reported that the silica-supported tantalum hydride [(·SiO)2TaH]1 catalyzes a new reaction of alkane metathesis which transforms any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues."

[3] "In the case of ethylbenzene, the reaction proceeds via a cross s- bond metathesis between the (sp3)CH bond of the aromatic methyl and the (sp3)C(sp3)C bond of ethane; in the case of xylenes, it occurs via a cross s-bond metathesis between the (sp2)CH bonds of the aromatic ring and the (sp3)C(sp3)C of ethane."
[4] "Although s-bond metathesis is known between molecular lutetium, thorium or scandium hydrides, alkyls or aryls and alkanes or aromatics, it is the first example of such catalytic cross metathesis reactions."

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a two-step process. Initially, a C-H bond activation takes place, leading to the liberation of molecular hydrogen. This step involves a competition between the two reagents (ethane and toluene) and the two types of C-H bonds in the toluene molecule (the methyl group and the aromatic ring). The result is a mixture of tantalumethyl ([(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5]), benzyl ([(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5]), or methylphenyl ([(·SiO)2Ta C6H4CH3]) complexes, which have been effectively identified by 13C CP MAS NMR. 

In a subsequent step, these complexes undergo a reaction with a molecule of ethane, releasing propane, ethylbenzene, or xylenes, depending on the specific reaction. This results in the formation of a tantalumethyl intermediate. The kinetic of the reaction with ethane of the three intermediates governs the final selectivity of the different products. The last common step in all cycles is the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either an ethane or a toluene molecule, regenerating the key intermediates.

The introduction of hydrogen gas (H2) reduces the deactivation process, suggesting that this might involve the dehydrogenation of surface species towards unsaturated ones. In the presence of H2, the turnover frequencies (TOF) of ethane and toluene increase, indicating improved performance. The performance of the catalyst is influenced by the balance between the two reagents' partial pressures, affecting the concentration of surface species and thus the reaction dynamics.

The selectivity of the products is determined by the relative stability of the intermediates formed during the reaction. The formation of xylenes represents the first case of a metathesis reaction between an aromatic (sp2)CH and a (sp3)C(sp3)C bond. The catalyst's performance, though modest, can be compared to the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with ethylene, a current industrial process for manufacturing ethylbenzene.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex interplay of C-H bond activation, hydrogen liberation, and subsequent reactions with ethane, leading to the formation of various alkylated products. The performance of the catalyst is influenced by the balance of reagents' partial pressures, reaction conditions, and the presence of hydrogen gas.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃交叉裂解的全面机制，讨论双站点和单站点方案，线性与环状烷烃转化涉及的过程，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其在各种烷烃转化中对反应选择性和催化剂性能的贡献。

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃交叉裂解的机制涉及两步过程。首先，发生C-H键活化，释放分子氢。这一步涉及乙烷和对二甲苯两种试剂之间的竞争以及对二甲苯分子中两种C-H键（甲基和芳环）的竞争。结果是生成了钽甲基（[(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5]）、苯基（[(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5]）或甲苯基（[(·SiO)2Ta C6H4CH3]）复合物，这些复合物已被有效识别通过13C CP MAS NMR。

接下来的步骤是这些复合物与乙烷反应，释放丙烷、乙基对二甲苯或二甲苯，具体取决于特定反应。这导致了钽甲基中间体的形成。三种中间体与乙烷反应的速率决定了不同产物的最终选择性。所有循环的最后共同点是将甲基从钽替换为乙烷或对二甲苯分子，从而再生关键中间体。

引入氢气（H2）可以减少失活过程，表明这可能涉及表面物种向不饱和化合物的脱氢作用。在氢气存在下，乙烷和对二甲苯的周转频率增加，说明性能得到改善。催化剂的性能受两种试剂分压平衡的影响，影响表面物种浓度，进而影响反应动力学。

产品的选择性由中间体形成的相对稳定性决定。对二甲苯的形成代表了首次在芳香族（sp2）CH和（sp3）C(sp3)C键之间进行的交叉裂解反应。尽管催化剂的性能相对有限，但其性能可与乙烯对苯的Friedel-Crafts烷基化相比较，后者是目前制造乙基对二甲苯的工业过程。

综上所述，由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃交叉裂解的机制涉及复杂的C-H键活化、氢释放和随后与乙烷的反应，导致各种烷基化产物的形成。催化剂的性能受到两种试剂分压平衡、反应条件和氢气存在的影响。

简而言之，由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃交叉裂解的机制涉及复杂的C-H键活化、氢释放和随后与乙烷的反应，导致各种烷基化产物的形成。催化剂的性能受到两种试剂分压平衡、反应条件和氢气存在的影响。
