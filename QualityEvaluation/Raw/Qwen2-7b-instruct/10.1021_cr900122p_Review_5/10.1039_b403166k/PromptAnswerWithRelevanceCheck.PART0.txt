[1] "We have previously reported that the silica-supported tantalum hydride [(·SiO)2TaH]1 catalyzes a new reaction of alkane metathesis which transforms any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues (eqn. (1))."
[2] "This reaction proceeds via both cleavage and formation of the (sp3)C(sp3)C bonds of any acyclic paraffin."
[3] "The following experiment illustrates these two new catalytic reactions. When a (3.7/97.6) molar mixture of toluene and ethane was heated in the presence of 1 (50 mg; 5 wt% Ta), at 250 C, under atmospheric pressure in a batch reactor (300 ml), besides methane, propane and butanes arising from the self-metathesis of ethane, ethylbenzene but also the various xylenes were produced."
[4] "Ethylbenzene and xylenes can arise from the cross-metathesis between toluene and ethane (eqn. (2)) but also from the self metathesis of toluene (eqn. (3)) although they have not been evidenced during blank experiments."
[5] "This leads to a mixture of tantalumethyl [(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5], benzyl [(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5] or methylphenyl [(·SiO)2Ta C6H4CH3] complexes which have been effectively identified by 13C CP MAS NMR."
[6] "The last step common to all cycles is the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either an ethane or a toluene molecule to regenerate the key intermediates: the tantalumethyl, benzyl or methylphenyl complexes."
[7] "In the case of ethylbenzene, the reaction proceeds via a cross s-bond metathesis between the (sp3)CH bond of the aromatic methyl and the (sp3)C(sp3)C bond of ethane; in the case of xylenes, it occurs via a cross s-bond metathesis between the (sp2)CH bonds of the aromatic ring and the (sp3)C(sp3)C of ethane."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. In this context, the mechanism includes the transformation of any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues through the cleavage and formation of (sp3)C(sp3)C bonds. The reaction between toluene and ethane, for instance, leads to the simultaneous formation of ethylbenzene and xylenes, illustrating the role of cross-metathesis reactions in this catalytic process. Key intermediates formed, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The formation of ethylbenzene and xylenes involves a cross s-bond metathesis between the (sp3)CH bond of the aromatic methyl and the (sp3)C(sp3)C bond of ethane for ethylbenzene, and between the (sp2)CH bonds of the aromatic ring and the (sp3)C(sp3)C of ethane for xylenes. These reactions are part of a larger catalytic cycle involving the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either an ethane or a toluene molecule, leading to the regeneration of key intermediates. The performance of the catalyst is influenced by factors such as the concentration of the reactants, the presence of hydrogen, and the partial pressures of both reagents, as demonstrated by the number of turnovers (TON) and the selectivities of the products obtained under different conditions.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides encompasses the conversion of acyclic alkanes into higher and lower homologues, the formation of key intermediates, and the role of cross-metathesis reactions in the selective production of ethylbenzene and xylenes. The performance of the catalyst is optimized by controlling factors such as the reactant concentrations, hydrogen presence, and partial pressures.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制涉及理解两站点和单站点方案。在此背景下，机制包括将任何链烷烃转化为更高和更低同系物通过（sp3）C(sp3)C键的断裂和形成。例如，乙苯和二甲苯的生成表明了这种催化过程中交叉裂合反应的作用。形成的中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，对确定各种烷烃转换的选择性和催化剂性能起着关键作用。

对于乙苯和二甲苯的生成，乙苯的生成涉及芳香甲基上的（sp3）CH键与乙烷上的（sp3）C(sp3)C键进行交叉偶联裂合，而二甲苯的生成则涉及芳香环上的（sp2）CH键与乙烷上的（sp3）C(sp3)C进行交叉偶联裂合。这些反应是更大催化循环的一部分，该循环涉及从钽中移除甲基分子，要么是乙烷，要么是二甲苯，从而再生关键中间体。催化剂的性能受反应物浓度、氢的存在以及两种试剂的分压等因素的影响，这通过不同条件下的周转次数（TON）和产物选择性得以体现。

综上所述，由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制涵盖了将链烷烃转化为更高和更低同系物、形成关键中间体以及交叉裂合反应在选择性生产乙苯和二甲苯中的作用。催化剂的性能可以通过控制反应物浓度、氢的存在以及两种试剂的分压等因素来优化。

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a two-step process. Initially, a C-H bond activation takes place, leading to the liberation of molecular hydrogen. This step involves a competition between the two reagents (ethane and toluene) and the two types of C-H bonds in the toluene molecule (the methyl group and the aromatic ring). The result is a mixture of tantalumethyl ([(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5]), benzyl ([(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5]), or methylphenyl ([(·SiO)2Ta C6H4CH3]) complexes, which have been effectively identified by 13C CP MAS NMR. 

In a subsequent step, these complexes undergo a reaction with a molecule of ethane, releasing propane, ethylbenzene, or xylenes, depending on the specific reaction. This results in the formation of a tantalumethyl intermediate. The kinetic of the reaction with ethane of the three intermediates governs the final selectivity of the different products. The last common step in all cycles is the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either an ethane or a toluene molecule, regenerating the key intermediates.

The introduction of hydrogen gas (H2) reduces the deactivation process, suggesting that this might involve the dehydrogenation of surface species towards unsaturated ones. In the presence of H2, the turnover frequencies (TOF) of ethane and toluene increase, indicating improved performance. The performance of the catalyst is influenced by the balance between the two reagents' partial pressures, affecting the concentration of surface species and thus the reaction dynamics.

The selectivity of the products is determined by the relative stability of the intermediates formed during the reaction. The formation of xylenes represents the first case of a metathesis reaction between an aromatic (sp2)CH and a (sp3)C(sp3)C bond. The catalyst's performance, though modest, can be compared to the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with ethylene, a current industrial process for manufacturing ethylbenzene.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex interplay of C-H bond activation, hydrogen liberation, and subsequent reactions with ethane, leading to the formation of various alkylated products. The performance of the catalyst is influenced by the balance of reagents' partial pressures, reaction conditions, and the presence of hydrogen gas.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃交叉裂解的全面机制，讨论双站点和单站点方案，线性与环状烷烃转化涉及的过程，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其在各种烷烃转化中对反应选择性和催化剂性能的贡献。

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃交叉裂解的机制涉及两步过程。首先，发生C-H键活化，释放分子氢。这一步涉及乙烷和对二甲苯两种试剂之间的竞争以及对二甲苯分子中两种C-H键（甲基和芳环）的竞争。结果是生成了钽甲基（[(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5]）、苯基（[(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5]）或甲苯基（[(·SiO)2Ta C6H4CH3]）复合物，这些复合物已被有效识别通过13C CP MAS NMR。

接下来的步骤是这些复合物与乙烷反应，释放丙烷、乙基对二甲苯或二甲苯，具体取决于特定反应。这导致了钽甲基中间体的形成。三种中间体与乙烷反应的速率决定了不同产物的最终选择性。所有循环的最后共同点是将甲基从钽替换为乙烷或对二甲苯分子，从而再生关键中间体。

引入氢气（H2）可以减少失活过程，表明这可能涉及表面物种向不饱和化合物的脱氢作用。在氢气存在下，乙烷和对二甲苯的周转频率增加，说明性能得到改善。催化剂的性能受两种试剂分压平衡的影响，影响表面物种浓度，进而影响反应动力学。

产品的选择性由中间体形成的相对稳定性决定。对二甲苯的形成代表了首次在芳香族（sp2）CH和（sp3）C(sp3)C键之间进行的交叉裂解反应。尽管催化剂的性能相对有限，但其性能可与乙烯对苯的Friedel-Crafts烷基化相比较，后者是目前制造乙基对二甲苯的工业过程。

综上所述，由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃交叉裂解的机制涉及复杂的C-H键活化、氢释放和随后与乙烷的反应，导致各种烷基化产物的形成。催化剂的性能受到两种试剂分压平衡、反应条件和氢气存在的影响。

简而言之，由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃交叉裂解的机制涉及复杂的C-H键活化、氢释放和随后与乙烷的反应，导致各种烷基化产物的形成。催化剂的性能受到两种试剂分压平衡、反应条件和氢气存在的影响。

[8] "These data are consistent with the relative dependence of the surface species concentration on the partial pressures of both reagents as depicted in Scheme 1. As the pressure of ethane increases, formation of [(·SiO)2TaCH2CH3] is favoured at the expense of [(·SiO)2Ta CH2C6H5] and [(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3] and thereby self-metathesis of ethane is favoured at the expense of cross-metathesis."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. In the case of two-site mechanisms, the catalyst facilitates the breaking and forming of carbon-carbon (CC) bonds between different molecules, specifically between an alkane and an aromatic compound. For instance, in the cross-metathesis reaction between toluene and ethane, ethylbenzene and xylenes are formed. The reaction proceeds via cross s-bond metathesis between the (sp3)CH bond of the aromatic methyl and the (sp3)C(sp3)C bond of ethane for ethylbenzene, and between the (sp2)CH bonds of the aromatic ring and the (sp3)C(sp3)C of ethane for xylenes. The key intermediates formed are tantalumethyl, benzyl, and methylphenyl complexes, which are identified by 13C CP MAS NMR spectroscopy.

The mechanism also involves the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either an ethane or a toluene molecule, regenerating the key intermediates. The performance of the catalyst is influenced by the partial pressures of the reactants, with the formation of different surface species being favored based on the pressures. Higher pressures of toluene lead to an increase in the formation of the benzyl and methylphenyl complexes, whereas increasing the pressure of ethane favors the formation of the tert-butyl complex, leading to a decrease in the self-metathesis of ethane and an increase in the cross-metathesis reaction.

This mechanism contributes to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions, as the balance between self-metathesis and cross-metathesis depends on the relative pressures of the reactants, affecting the yield of desired products.

催化硅负载的钽氢化物的烷烃交叉裂合机制涉及理解双位点和单位点方案。在双位点机制中，催化剂促进不同分子之间碳碳（CC）键的断裂和形成，特别是烷烃和芳香化合物之间。例如，在甲苯与乙烷之间的交叉裂合反应中，乙基苯和二甲苯形成。对于乙基苯，反应通过交叉s键裂合在芳香甲基的（sp3）CH键与乙烷的（sp3）C（sp3）C键之间进行；对于二甲苯，它发生在芳香环的（sp2）CH键与乙烷的（sp3）C（sp3）C之间。关键中间体是钽甲基、苄基和甲基苯基复合物，这些可以通过13C CP MAS NMR光谱法识别。

该机制还涉及从钽中移除甲基团，由乙烷或甲苯分子再生关键中间体。催化剂的性能受反应物分压的影响，不同的表面物种基于分压被优先形成。增加甲苯的压力导致苯基和甲基苯基复合物的形成增加，而增加乙烷压力有利于形成叔丁基复合物，从而减少自身裂解并增加交叉裂合反应。

这种机制对各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能有贡献，因为自我裂解与交叉裂合之间的平衡取决于反应物的相对压力，影响所需产品的产率。

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the role of both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in transforming linear and cyclic alkanes, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism starts with C-H bond activation, leading to the liberation of molecular hydrogen. This activation step involves a competition between the reactants, ethane and toluene, as well as between the different types of C-H bonds within the toluene molecule. Silica-supported tantalum hydrides facilitate the cross-metathesis reaction between toluene and ethane, resulting in the formation of ethylbenzene and xylenes.

The formation of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, plays a crucial role in the catalytic process. These intermediates are formed through the cleavage and formation of C-C bonds, contributing to the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes. The catalyst's performance is influenced by factors like reaction selectivity, which is determined by the balance between the rates of different reaction pathways, such as self-metathesis of ethane versus cross-metathesis between ethane and toluene.

Increasing the pressure of ethane leads to a shift in the formation of intermediates, favoring the formation of ethylbenzene over xylenes. This is because higher ethane pressure favors the formation of [(·SiO)2TaCH2CH3] intermediates, which are more prone to undergoing cross-metathesis with toluene, thus promoting the formation of ethylbenzene.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex interplay of bond activation, intermediates formation, and reaction pathway selection, which collectively determine the efficiency and product distribution in various alkane conversions.

机制始于C-H键的激活，导致分子氢的释放。此激活步骤涉及乙烷和苯乙烯等反应物之间的竞争，以及苯乙烯分子内不同类型的C-H键之间。二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物促进乙烷和苯乙烯之间的交叉裂合反应，产生乙基苯和二甲苯。

关键中间体的形成，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，在催化过程中起着至关重要的作用。这些中间体通过C-C键的断裂和形成而产生，从而促进了线性与环状烷烃的转化。催化剂的性能受反应选择性等因素影响，这取决于不同反应途径速率的平衡，如乙烷自裂合与乙烷和苯乙烯之间的交叉裂合。

增加乙烷的压力导致中间体的形成发生偏移，更倾向于形成乙基苯而不是二甲苯。这是因为更高的乙烷压力有利于形成[(·SiO)2TaCH2CH3]中间体，这些中间体更容易进行与苯乙烯的交叉裂合，从而促进乙基苯的形成。

总之，由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合机制涉及复杂的键激活、中间体形成和反应路径选择的相互作用，这些共同决定了各种烷烃转换的效率和产物分布。
