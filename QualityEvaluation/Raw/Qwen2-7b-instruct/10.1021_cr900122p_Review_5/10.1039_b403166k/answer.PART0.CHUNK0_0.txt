[1] "We have previously reported that the silica-supported tantalum hydride [(·SiO)2TaH]1 catalyzes a new reaction of alkane metathesis which transforms any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues (eqn. (1))."
[2] "This reaction proceeds via both cleavage and formation of the (sp3)C(sp3)C bonds of any acyclic paraffin."
[3] "The following experiment illustrates these two new catalytic reactions. When a (3.7/97.6) molar mixture of toluene and ethane was heated in the presence of 1 (50 mg; 5 wt% Ta), at 250 C, under atmospheric pressure in a batch reactor (300 ml), besides methane, propane and butanes arising from the self-metathesis of ethane, ethylbenzene but also the various xylenes were produced."
[4] "Ethylbenzene and xylenes can arise from the cross-metathesis between toluene and ethane (eqn. (2)) but also from the self metathesis of toluene (eqn. (3)) although they have not been evidenced during blank experiments."
[5] "This leads to a mixture of tantalumethyl [(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5], benzyl [(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5] or methylphenyl [(·SiO)2Ta C6H4CH3] complexes which have been effectively identified by 13C CP MAS NMR."
[6] "The last step common to all cycles is the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either an ethane or a toluene molecule to regenerate the key intermediates: the tantalumethyl, benzyl or methylphenyl complexes."
[7] "In the case of ethylbenzene, the reaction proceeds via a cross s-bond metathesis between the (sp3)CH bond of the aromatic methyl and the (sp3)C(sp3)C bond of ethane; in the case of xylenes, it occurs via a cross s-bond metathesis between the (sp2)CH bonds of the aromatic ring and the (sp3)C(sp3)C of ethane."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. In this context, the mechanism includes the transformation of any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues through the cleavage and formation of (sp3)C(sp3)C bonds. The reaction between toluene and ethane, for instance, leads to the simultaneous formation of ethylbenzene and xylenes, illustrating the role of cross-metathesis reactions in this catalytic process. Key intermediates formed, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The formation of ethylbenzene and xylenes involves a cross s-bond metathesis between the (sp3)CH bond of the aromatic methyl and the (sp3)C(sp3)C bond of ethane for ethylbenzene, and between the (sp2)CH bonds of the aromatic ring and the (sp3)C(sp3)C of ethane for xylenes. These reactions are part of a larger catalytic cycle involving the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either an ethane or a toluene molecule, leading to the regeneration of key intermediates. The performance of the catalyst is influenced by factors such as the concentration of the reactants, the presence of hydrogen, and the partial pressures of both reagents, as demonstrated by the number of turnovers (TON) and the selectivities of the products obtained under different conditions.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides encompasses the conversion of acyclic alkanes into higher and lower homologues, the formation of key intermediates, and the role of cross-metathesis reactions in the selective production of ethylbenzene and xylenes. The performance of the catalyst is optimized by controlling factors such as the reactant concentrations, hydrogen presence, and partial pressures.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制涉及理解两站点和单站点方案。在此背景下，机制包括将任何链烷烃转化为更高和更低同系物通过（sp3）C(sp3)C键的断裂和形成。例如，乙苯和二甲苯的生成表明了这种催化过程中交叉裂合反应的作用。形成的中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，对确定各种烷烃转换的选择性和催化剂性能起着关键作用。

对于乙苯和二甲苯的生成，乙苯的生成涉及芳香甲基上的（sp3）CH键与乙烷上的（sp3）C(sp3)C键进行交叉偶联裂合，而二甲苯的生成则涉及芳香环上的（sp2）CH键与乙烷上的（sp3）C(sp3)C进行交叉偶联裂合。这些反应是更大催化循环的一部分，该循环涉及从钽中移除甲基分子，要么是乙烷，要么是二甲苯，从而再生关键中间体。催化剂的性能受反应物浓度、氢的存在以及两种试剂的分压等因素的影响，这通过不同条件下的周转次数（TON）和产物选择性得以体现。

综上所述，由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制涵盖了将链烷烃转化为更高和更低同系物、形成关键中间体以及交叉裂合反应在选择性生产乙苯和二甲苯中的作用。催化剂的性能可以通过控制反应物浓度、氢的存在以及两种试剂的分压等因素来优化。
