[1] "The silica-supported tantalum hydride [(·SiO)2TaH] 1 catalyzes at moderate temperature (150250 C) the cross-metathesis reaction between toluene and ethane, to form mainly ethylbenzene and xylenes."
[2] "We have previously reported that the silica-supported tantalum hydride1 [(·SiO)2TaH] 1 catalyzes a new reaction of alkane metathesis which transforms any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues (eqn. (1))."
[3] "The following experiment illustrates these two new catalytic reactions. When a (3.7/97.6) molar mixture of toluene and ethane was heated in the presence of 1 (50 mg; 5 wt% Ta), at 250 C, under atmospheric pressure in a batch reactor (300 ml), besides methane, propane and butanes arising from the self-metathesis of ethane, ethylbenzene but also the various xylenes were produced."
[4] "Regarding the possible mechanism, both reactions begin by a C H bond activation with liberation of molecular hydrogen."
[5] "In a second step, these complexes would then undergo mainly the reaction with a molecule of ethane to liberate propane, ethylbenzene or xylenes respectively and form a tantalumethyl intermediate; during this step, the kinetic of the reaction with ethane of the three intermediates will govern the final selectivity of the different products."
[6] "When a (3.7/97.6) mixture of toluene and ethane (flow rate of 3 ml min−1) was passed over a catalytic bed of [(·SiO)2TaH] 1 (420 mg; 4.6 wt% Ta) at 250 C, methane, propane and butanes were again produced as well as ethylbenzene and xylenes but also n- and iso-propylbenzenes, resulting reasonably from a double methyl addition to the CH3 group of toluene."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the role of the catalyst in both two-site and one-site schemes, processes of linear and cyclic alkane transformations, and the formation and role of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes.

The catalyst [(·SiO)2TaH] facilitates the cross-metathesis reaction between toluene and ethane at moderate temperatures, producing ethylbenzene and xylenes. It can transform any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues. The mechanism includes C-H bond activation followed by reaction with ethane to generate various products like propane, ethylbenzene, and xylenes, with the kinetic of the reaction with ethane influencing product selectivity. The catalyst also enables the formation of n- and iso-propylbenzenes through a double methyl addition to the CH3 group of toluene.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the catalyst's ability to activate C-H bonds, facilitate reactions with alkanes, and control product selectivity through kinetic considerations.
