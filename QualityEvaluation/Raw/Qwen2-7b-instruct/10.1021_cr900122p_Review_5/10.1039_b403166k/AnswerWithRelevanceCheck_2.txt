Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes, processes of linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The catalyst [(Â·SiO)2TaH] facilitates the cross-metathesis reaction between toluene and ethane at moderate temperatures, producing ethylbenzene and xylenes. It can transform any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues. The mechanism includes C-H bond activation followed by reaction with ethane to generate various products like propane, ethylbenzene, and xylenes, with the kinetic of the reaction with ethane influencing product selectivity. The catalyst also enables the formation of n- and iso-propylbenzenes through a double methyl addition to the CH3 group of toluene.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the catalyst's ability to activate C-H bonds, facilitate reactions with alkanes, and control product selectivity through kinetic considerations.
