The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context of this study, the focus is on the modification of alumina surfaces with trimethylsilyl groups to enhance the selectivity and activity of the catalytic system. The process begins with the grafting of (CH3)ReO3 onto the alumina surface, which has been previously modified with trimethylsilyl fragments. This modification affects the adsorption properties of alumina, favoring desorption and consequently disfavoring secondary reactions.

Key intermediates in the transformation of alkanes include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The role of these intermediates contributes significantly to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. The study demonstrates that the catalytic system can achieve high (Z)-selectivity for the metathesis of propene, with a linear increase in the selectivity of 2-butene with conversion. This behavior is attributed to the adsorption properties of the modified alumina surface, which alters the overall performance of the catalyst.

The enhanced activity and selectivity of the catalyst are primarily due to the modification of the alumina surface, which changes the adsorption properties by favoring desorption over secondary reactions. This system holds promise for further development into a single-site system based on (CH3)ReO3 and modified oxide surfaces, potentially leading to highly efficient catalysts for alkane metathesis reactions.

烷烃的硅基钽氢化物催化热解机制涉及两种位点和单一位点方案。在此研究中，重点是通过在氧化铝表面添加三甲基硅基团来增强催化剂系统的选择性和活性。该过程始于将(CH3)ReO3嫁接到经过三甲基硅基团改性的氧化铝表面上。这种修改影响了氧化铝的吸附性质，促进脱附并相应地抑制了二级反应。

在烷烃转换过程中，关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。这些中间体在选择性和催化剂性能中的作用对各种烷烃转化至关重要。研究表明，该催化系统可以实现丙烯的高(Z)-选择性热解，2-丁烯的(Z)-选择性随着转化率的增加而线性增加。这种行为归因于修改后的氧化铝表面的吸附性质，这些性质改变了催化剂的整体性能。

催化剂的增强活性和选择性主要归因于氧化铝表面的修改，这改变了吸附性质，促进了脱附而非二级反应。这个系统有潜力进一步发展成基于(CH3)ReO3和改性氧化物表面的单一位点系统，可能最终导致高度高效的烷烃热解催化剂。

Some homogeneous catalysts, however, are highly stereoselective and can maintain this high stereoselectivity at high conversions.8 In the case of heterogeneous catalysts, and especially those supported on alumina, the thermodynamic ratio of 2-butenes (E/Z=3:1 at 25C) is usually observed for the metathesis of propene even under continuous flow conditions. To observe the kinetic product ratio, it is necessary to use very high flow rates and to work at very low conversions9,10 because the strong adsorption of olefins on alumina favors secondary isomerization (degenerate metathesis).11

Olefin metathesis has become a key reaction for basic and fine chemical synthesis.13 However, despite years of research and tremendous advances in this field, it is still difficult to control the stereochemical outcome of this reaction, which leads to mixture of (E) and (Z)isomers.47 In fact, one of the difficulties arises from competing secondary (Z)(E)isomerization. This reaction is catalyzed by the same catalyst and involves the same reaction (metathesis) and mechanism (Scheme1), therefore the products will always eventually equilibrate into a thermodynamic mixture.

This study focuses on enhancing the selectivity and activity of alumina-supported (CH3)ReO3 catalysts for olefin metathesis through modifications to the surface properties of the support. The key findings include the increase in catalyst efficiency and selectivity by grafting (CH3)ReO3 onto alumina surfaces pre-modified with trimethylsilyl (Si(CH3)3) groups. The introduction of Si(CH3)3 groups modifies the adsorption properties of alumina, favoring desorption and thus disfavoring secondary reactions, leading to improved stereoselectivity. The catalyst demonstrates high activity and selectivity for 2-butenes, particularly for the (Z)-isomer, even at higher conversions, surpassing most alumina-supported catalysts in terms of stereoselectivity and overall performance. The mechanism of action involves the transformation of propene into a mixture of ethene and 2-butenes, with the catalyst achieving a turnover number (TON) of 23,500 over 7,800 minutes, while maintaining a high selectivity for 2-butenes, especially the (Z)-isomer, and a thermodynamic ratio significantly different from typical alumina-supported catalysts.

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the transformation of linear and cyclic alkane molecules into different products through the exchange of alkyl groups. The process can be categorized into two-site and one-site schemes. In a two-site mechanism, the catalyst facilitates the breaking and reforming of alkyl bonds at distinct locations within the molecule, leading to the production of alkenes and possibly other alkane products. In a one-site mechanism, the transformation occurs at a single location, often involving the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which then undergoes rearrangement or further reactions to yield the final products. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in the catalytic cycle, influencing the selectivity and efficiency of the reaction.

The selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are significantly influenced by factors such as the nature of the catalyst, the specific structure of the alkane substrate, and the reaction conditions. Catalysts with enhanced adsorption properties, as demonstrated by the silica-supported tantalum hydrides in the study, can lead to improved activity and selectivity. By modifying the surface properties of the support material, the catalyst's performance can be optimized, leading to the production of desired products with higher yields and purity.

The catalyst performance in alkane conversions is affected by the interaction between the alkane molecules and the catalyst surface. The strong adsorption of olefins on the support material can favor secondary reactions, such as isomerization, which compete with the primary alkane metathesis reaction. To achieve high selectivity for specific alkane products, it is necessary to design catalysts with specific adsorption properties that favor productive alkane metathesis over secondary reactions.

The introduction of trimethylsilyl groups onto the alumina surface modifies the adsorption properties of the catalyst, enhancing its activity and selectivity for certain alkane conversions. This modification allows for a better balance between adsorption and desorption, reducing the likelihood of secondary reactions and improving the overall performance of the catalyst in alkane metathesis reactions. The study suggests that further investigation into the development of single-site systems based on (CH3)ReO3 and modified oxide surfaces could lead to the creation of highly efficient catalysts for alkane conversions, offering potential improvements in both activity and selectivity.

烷烃裂合由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化涉及线性和环状烷烃分子之间的不同产物通过烷基键的断裂和重组而发生转化。该过程可以分为双站点和单站点方案。在双站点机制中，催化剂在分子的不同位置促进烷基键的断裂和重组，导致烯烃和其他烷烃产品的生成。在单站点机制中，转化发生在单一位置，通常涉及形成金属环丁烷中间体，然后进行重新排列或进一步反应以生成最终产品。关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，在催化循环中起着至关重要的作用，影响反应的选择性和效率。

不同烷烃转化的催化剂性能受到催化剂的性质、烷烃基团的具体结构以及反应条件等因素的影响。具有增强吸附性质的催化剂，如研究中的二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物，可以提高活性和选择性。通过修改支撑材料的表面性质，可以优化催化剂性能，从而产生更高产率和纯度的产品。

烷烃转化的催化剂性能受烷烃分子与催化剂表面的相互作用影响。支持材料上烷基的强吸附有利于二级反应，如异构化，这与主要的烷烃裂合反应竞争。为了实现特定烷烃产品的高选择性，需要设计具有特定吸附性质的催化剂，以优先促进有效烷烃裂合，减少二级反应的可能性，并提高烷烃裂合反应的整体性能。

引入三甲基硅烷基团到氧化铝表面修改了催化剂的吸附性质，提高了其活性和特定烷烃转化的选择性。这种修改允许更好的吸附和脱附平衡，减少二级反应的可能性，提高催化剂的整体性能。研究表明，进一步研究基于（CH3）ReO3和改性氧化物表面的单站点系统的开发，可能会导致高效催化剂的创建，为烷烃转化提供潜在改进的活性和选择性。
