The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context of this study, the focus is on the modification of alumina surfaces with trimethylsilyl groups to enhance the selectivity and activity of the catalytic system. The process begins with the grafting of (CH3)ReO3 onto the alumina surface, which has been previously modified with trimethylsilyl fragments. This modification affects the adsorption properties of alumina, favoring desorption and consequently disfavoring secondary reactions.

Key intermediates in the transformation of alkanes include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The role of these intermediates contributes significantly to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. The study demonstrates that the catalytic system can achieve high (Z)-selectivity for the metathesis of propene, with a linear increase in the selectivity of 2-butene with conversion. This behavior is attributed to the adsorption properties of the modified alumina surface, which alters the overall performance of the catalyst.

The enhanced activity and selectivity of the catalyst are primarily due to the modification of the alumina surface, which changes the adsorption properties by favoring desorption over secondary reactions. This system holds promise for further development into a single-site system based on (CH3)ReO3 and modified oxide surfaces, potentially leading to highly efficient catalysts for alkane metathesis reactions.

烷烃的硅基钽氢化物催化热解机制涉及两种位点和单一位点方案。在此研究中，重点是通过在氧化铝表面添加三甲基硅基团来增强催化剂系统的选择性和活性。该过程始于将(CH3)ReO3嫁接到经过三甲基硅基团改性的氧化铝表面上。这种修改影响了氧化铝的吸附性质，促进脱附并相应地抑制了二级反应。

在烷烃转换过程中，关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。这些中间体在选择性和催化剂性能中的作用对各种烷烃转化至关重要。研究表明，该催化系统可以实现丙烯的高(Z)-选择性热解，2-丁烯的(Z)-选择性随着转化率的增加而线性增加。这种行为归因于修改后的氧化铝表面的吸附性质，这些性质改变了催化剂的整体性能。

催化剂的增强活性和选择性主要归因于氧化铝表面的修改，这改变了吸附性质，促进了脱附而非二级反应。这个系统有潜力进一步发展成基于(CH3)ReO3和改性氧化物表面的单一位点系统，可能最终导致高度高效的烷烃热解催化剂。
