[1] "Olefin metathesis has become a key reaction for basic and fine chemical synthesis."
[2] "Despite years of research and tremendous advances in this field, it is still difficult to control the stereochemical outcome of this reaction, which leads to mixture of (E) and (Z) isomers."
[3] "One of the difficulties arises from competing secondary (Z)(E)isomerization."
[4] "Supported metathesis: Grafting (CH3)ReO3 onto alumina covered with surface trimethylsilyl groups increases the efficiency and selectivity of this catalyst in olefin metathesis."
[5] "The SiMe3 groups (X) modify the adsorption properties of alumina by favoring desorption and thereby disfavoring secondary reactions."
[6] "Examples of productive propene metathesis and isomerization in propene metathesis: a) Formation of 2-butenes by productive propene metathesis; b) (Z)-2-butene isomerization by degenerate metathesis."
[7] "In the case of heterogeneous catalysts, and especially those supported on alumina, the thermodynamic ratio of 2-butenes (E/Z=3:1 at 25C) is usually observed for the metathesis of propene even under continuous flow conditions."
[8] "To observe the kinetic product ratio, it is necessary to use very high flow rates and to work at very low conversions."
[9] "Herein we show that grafting (CH3)ReO3 onto an alumina12 whose surface has been previously modified with trimethylsilyl fragments (Scheme2) leads to an improved activity as well as a (Z)-selective catalyst for the metathesis of propene."
[10] "Acidity measurements with pyridine1416 showed that most of the stronger Lewis acid sites had been consumed and that the weaker ones had only been partially consumed."
[11] "Overall, these experimental data are consistent with a reaction of AllylTMS with the hydroxy groups of alumina to give trimethylsilyl surface species."
[12] "The band at 1205cm1 corresponds to the methyl group of (CH3)ReO3."
[13] "This observation is in agreement with the weaker acidity of 1."
[14] "The initial rate and the cumulative number of turnovers (at 7800min) per active site can be estimated from the initial number of active sites (approx. 6%)a rare possibility in heterogeneous catalysisto be 350mol of propene transformed per mol of active sites per minute and 330000, respectively."
[15] "Moreover, catalyst 1 displays a very high selectivity for 2-butenes, particularly for (Z)-2-butene (1-butene: <1×104%; isobutene: approx. 0.003%)."
[16] "These two equations indicate that the adsorption properties of the solid can indeed dramatically alter the overall performance of a catalyst (e.g. activity, stereoselectivity)."
[17] "In conclusion, modifying an alumina surface with trimethylsilyl groups has a drastic effect on the selectivity and activity of the catalytic system."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, the process involves two-site and one-site schemes, with linear and cyclic alkane transformations occurring through the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Key intermediates play crucial roles in reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. By modifying the alumina surface with trimethylsilyl groups, the adsorption properties are altered, favoring desorption and disfavoring secondary reactions. This leads to improved activity and selectivity for propene metathesis, particularly for (Z)-2-butene. The catalyst's performance is significantly influenced by its adsorption properties, affecting both activity and stereoselectivity. This system demonstrates great promise for developing highly efficient catalysts based on (CH3)ReO3 and modified oxide surfaces.
