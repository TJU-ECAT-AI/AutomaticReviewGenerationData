[1] "Olefin metathesis has become a key reaction for basic and fine chemical synthesis."
[2] "Despite years of research and tremendous advances in this field, it is still difficult to control the stereochemical outcome of this reaction, which leads to mixture of (E) and (Z) isomers."
[3] "Some homogeneous catalysts, however, are highly stereoselective and can maintain this high stereoselectivity at high conversions."
[4] "To observe the kinetic product ratio, it is necessary to use very high flow rates and to work at very low conversions9,10 because the strong adsorption of olefins on alumina favors secondary isomerization (degenerate metathesis)."

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the transformation of linear and cyclic alkane molecules into different products through the exchange of alkyl groups. The process can be categorized into two-site and one-site schemes. In a two-site mechanism, the catalyst facilitates the breaking and reforming of alkyl bonds at distinct locations within the molecule, leading to the production of alkenes and possibly other alkane products. In a one-site mechanism, the transformation occurs at a single location, often involving the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which then undergoes rearrangement or further reactions to yield the final products. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in the catalytic cycle, influencing the selectivity and efficiency of the reaction.

The selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are significantly influenced by factors such as the nature of the catalyst, the specific structure of the alkane substrate, and the reaction conditions. Catalysts with enhanced adsorption properties, as demonstrated by the silica-supported tantalum hydrides in the study, can lead to improved activity and selectivity. By modifying the surface properties of the support material, the catalyst's performance can be optimized, leading to the production of desired products with higher yields and purity.

The catalyst performance in alkane conversions is affected by the interaction between the alkane molecules and the catalyst surface. The strong adsorption of olefins on the support material can favor secondary reactions, such as isomerization, which compete with the primary alkane metathesis reaction. To achieve high selectivity for specific alkane products, it is necessary to design catalysts with specific adsorption properties that favor productive alkane metathesis over secondary reactions.

The introduction of trimethylsilyl groups onto the alumina surface modifies the adsorption properties of the catalyst, enhancing its activity and selectivity for certain alkane conversions. This modification allows for a better balance between adsorption and desorption, reducing the likelihood of secondary reactions and improving the overall performance of the catalyst in alkane metathesis reactions. The study suggests that further investigation into the development of single-site systems based on (CH3)ReO3 and modified oxide surfaces could lead to the creation of highly efficient catalysts for alkane conversions, offering potential improvements in both activity and selectivity.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制，讨论双站点和单站点方案，线性和环状烷烃转化过程，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其作用，以及这些因素如何影响不同烷烃转化的反应选择性和催化剂性能。

烷烃裂合由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化涉及线性和环状烷烃分子之间的不同产物通过烷基键的断裂和重组而发生转化。该过程可以分为双站点和单站点方案。在双站点机制中，催化剂在分子的不同位置促进烷基键的断裂和重组，导致烯烃和其他烷烃产品的生成。在单站点机制中，转化发生在单一位置，通常涉及形成金属环丁烷中间体，然后进行重新排列或进一步反应以生成最终产品。关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，在催化循环中起着至关重要的作用，影响反应的选择性和效率。

不同烷烃转化的催化剂性能受到催化剂的性质、烷烃基团的具体结构以及反应条件等因素的影响。具有增强吸附性质的催化剂，如研究中的二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物，可以提高活性和选择性。通过修改支撑材料的表面性质，可以优化催化剂性能，从而产生更高产率和纯度的产品。

烷烃转化的催化剂性能受烷烃分子与催化剂表面的相互作用影响。支持材料上烷基的强吸附有利于二级反应，如异构化，这与主要的烷烃裂合反应竞争。为了实现特定烷烃产品的高选择性，需要设计具有特定吸附性质的催化剂，以优先促进有效烷烃裂合，减少二级反应的可能性，并提高烷烃裂合反应的整体性能。

引入三甲基硅烷基团到氧化铝表面修改了催化剂的吸附性质，提高了其活性和特定烷烃转化的选择性。这种修改允许更好的吸附和脱附平衡，减少二级反应的可能性，提高催化剂的整体性能。研究表明，进一步研究基于（CH3）ReO3和改性氧化物表面的单站点系统的开发，可能会导致高效催化剂的创建，为烷烃转化提供潜在改进的活性和选择性。
