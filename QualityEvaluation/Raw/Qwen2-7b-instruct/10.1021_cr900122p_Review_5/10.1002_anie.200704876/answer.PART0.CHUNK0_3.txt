Tuning the Selectivity of Alumina-Supported (CH3)ReO3 by Modifying the Surface Properties of the Support Graphical Abstract Supported metathesis: Grafting (CH3)ReO3 onto alumina covered with surface trimethylsilyl groups increases the efficiency and selectivity of this catalyst in olefin metathesis (see scheme).

Some homogeneous catalysts, however, are highly stereoselective and can maintain this high stereoselectivity at high conversions.8 In the case of heterogeneous catalysts, and especially those supported on alumina, the thermodynamic ratio of 2-butenes (E/Z=3:1 at 25C) is usually observed for the metathesis of propene even under continuous flow conditions. To observe the kinetic product ratio, it is necessary to use very high flow rates and to work at very low conversions9,10 because the strong adsorption of olefins on alumina favors secondary isomerization (degenerate metathesis).11

Olefin metathesis has become a key reaction for basic and fine chemical synthesis.13 However, despite years of research and tremendous advances in this field, it is still difficult to control the stereochemical outcome of this reaction, which leads to mixture of (E) and (Z)isomers.47 In fact, one of the difficulties arises from competing secondary (Z)(E)isomerization. This reaction is catalyzed by the same catalyst and involves the same reaction (metathesis) and mechanism (Scheme1), therefore the products will always eventually equilibrate into a thermodynamic mixture.

This study focuses on enhancing the selectivity and activity of alumina-supported (CH3)ReO3 catalysts for olefin metathesis through modifications to the surface properties of the support. The key findings include the increase in catalyst efficiency and selectivity by grafting (CH3)ReO3 onto alumina surfaces pre-modified with trimethylsilyl (Si(CH3)3) groups. The introduction of Si(CH3)3 groups modifies the adsorption properties of alumina, favoring desorption and thus disfavoring secondary reactions, leading to improved stereoselectivity. The catalyst demonstrates high activity and selectivity for 2-butenes, particularly for the (Z)-isomer, even at higher conversions, surpassing most alumina-supported catalysts in terms of stereoselectivity and overall performance. The mechanism of action involves the transformation of propene into a mixture of ethene and 2-butenes, with the catalyst achieving a turnover number (TON) of 23,500 over 7,800 minutes, while maintaining a high selectivity for 2-butenes, especially the (Z)-isomer, and a thermodynamic ratio significantly different from typical alumina-supported catalysts.

这项研究专注于通过改变支持材料的表面性质来提高铝酸盐支持的(CH3)ReO3催化剂的烯烃环化反应的选择性和活性。关键发现包括通过在预先用三甲基硅烷（Si(CH3)3）基团改性的铝酸盐表面上接枝(CH3)ReO3，可以增强催化剂的效率和选择性。引入Si(CH3)3基团改变了铝酸盐的吸附性质，有利于脱附，从而减少副反应，导致改善的选择性。该催化剂在高转化率下表现出高活性和选择性，特别对于(Z)-异构体的2-丁烯，超越了大多数铝酸盐支持的催化剂在立体选择性和整体性能方面的表现。机制涉及丙烯转化为乙烯和2-丁烯的混合物，催化剂在7800分钟内实现了23,500次周转数，同时保持高选择性，特别是对于(Z)-异构体的2-丁烯，并且与典型铝酸盐支持催化剂相比，热力学比显著不同。
