Tuning the Selectivity of Alumina-Supported (CH3)ReO3 by Modifying the Surface Properties of the Support Graphical Abstract Supported metathesis: Grafting (CH3)ReO3 onto alumina covered with surface trimethylsilyl groups increases the efficiency and selectivity of this catalyst in olefin metathesis (see scheme). The SiMe3 groups (X) modify the adsorption properties of alumina by favoring desorption and thereby disfavoring secondary reactions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes, with processes involving linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in determining reaction selectivity and catalyst performance across various alkane conversions.
