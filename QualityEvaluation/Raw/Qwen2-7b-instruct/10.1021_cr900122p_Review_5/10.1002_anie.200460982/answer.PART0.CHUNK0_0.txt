[1] "This reaction corresponds to a cross-metathesis of propane and methane (see scheme; Alk=alkyl)."
[2] "The difficulty in achieving selective transformation of methane into valuable chemical products resides in the low reactivity of methane compared to co-reactants (e.g. olefins) and/or the products."
[3] "To test this concept, we studied the degenerate reaction of methane with ethane [Eq.(1)] which requires 13C labeling to detect the phenomenon."
[4] "Incorporation of the label into ethane clearly shows that cross-metathesis occurs and that methane can participate in the carboncarbon formation of higher alkanes."
[5] "To make this distinction, the reaction is carried out by passing a 1.5 mLmin−1 flow of a 1250:1 methane/propane mixture at 50×102 kPa over 300 mg of 1 at 250C."
[6] "Since the alkane-metathesis active site can be generated from either TaIII or TaV intermediates, and since olefin metathesis would require the formation of olefins, one and two-site mechanisms can be proposed (Scheme 1), which are under investigation."
