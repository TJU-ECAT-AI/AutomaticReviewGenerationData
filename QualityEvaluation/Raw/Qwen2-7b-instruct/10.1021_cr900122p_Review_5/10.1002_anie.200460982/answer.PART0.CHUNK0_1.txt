[1] "Recently, we have shown that a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica [(SiO)2Ta-H] (1), prepared by surface organometallic chemistry,12 can catalytically transform a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues.13,14 This reaction, called alkane metathesis, involves a successive cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds: hence two ethane molecules give one methane and one propane molecule."
[2] "To make this distinction, the reaction is carried out by passing a 1.5 mLmin1 flow of a 1250:1 methane/propane mixture at 50×102 kPa over 300 mg of 1 at 250C. The alkane mixture was first contacted at room temperature and then a ramp of 250Ch1 was applied up to 250C (Figure 2)."
[3] "Since the alkane-metathesis active site can be generated from either TaIII or TaV intermediates, and since olefin metathesis would require the formation of olefins, one and two-site mechanisms can be proposed (Scheme 1), which are under investigation."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the successive cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds. This reaction allows for the transformation of a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues. The active site for this process can be generated from either TaIII or TaV intermediates, leading to potential one and two-site mechanisms. These factors contribute to the reaction's selectivity and performance in various alkane conversions.
