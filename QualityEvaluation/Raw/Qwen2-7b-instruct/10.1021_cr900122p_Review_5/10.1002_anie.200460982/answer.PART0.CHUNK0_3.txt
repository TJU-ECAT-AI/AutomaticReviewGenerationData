[1] "Recently, we have shown that a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica [(SiO)2Ta-H] (1), prepared by surface organometallic chemistry,12 can catalytically transform a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues."
[2] "The reaction of methane with higher alkanes was further supported by running an identical reaction, in which 13C-labeled methane was used in place of unlabeled methane."
[3] "In summary, we have shown that 1 can catalyze the reaction of methane with a higher hydrocarbon, namely propane, and thereby incorporate methane into a higher alkane by cross-metathesis."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the use of a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride on silica [(SiO)2Ta-H]. This catalyst enables the transformation of a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues. The mechanism supports the reaction of methane with higher alkanes, leading to the incorporation of methane into a higher alkane through a process known as cross-metathesis. The process involves the activation of the alkane's carbon-carbon (CC) bond, followed by the rearrangement to form two new CC bonds, resulting in the production of two ethane molecules per propane molecule consumed under optimal conditions.

催化作用由表面有机金属化学制备的二氧化硅支持的高电子亲性的钽氢化物[(SiO)2Ta-H]，该机制允许特定的烷烃转化为其更高的和更低的同系物。该机制支持甲烷与更高烷烃的反应，导致甲烷融入更高烷烃中通过称为交叉裂合的机制。该过程涉及烷烃的碳-碳（CC）键的活化，随后重新排列形成两个新的CC键，从而产生每消耗一个丙烷分子两个乙烷分子。
