[1] "This reaction corresponds to a cross-metathesis of propane and methane (see scheme; Alk=alkyl)."
[2] "The difficulty in achieving selective transformation of methane into valuable chemical products resides in the low reactivity of methane compared to co-reactants (e.g. olefins) and/or the products."
[3] "To test this concept, we studied the degenerate reaction of methane with ethane [Eq.(1)] which requires 13C labeling to detect the phenomenon."
[4] "Incorporation of the label into ethane clearly shows that cross-metathesis occurs and that methane can participate in the carboncarbon formation of higher alkanes."
[5] "To make this distinction, the reaction is carried out by passing a 1.5 mLmin−1 flow of a 1250:1 methane/propane mixture at 50×102 kPa over 300 mg of 1 at 250C."
[6] "Since the alkane-metathesis active site can be generated from either TaIII or TaV intermediates, and since olefin metathesis would require the formation of olefins, one and two-site mechanisms can be proposed (Scheme 1), which are under investigation."

[1] "Recently, we have shown that a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica [(SiO)2Ta-H] (1), prepared by surface organometallic chemistry,12 can catalytically transform a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues.13,14 This reaction, called alkane metathesis, involves a successive cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds: hence two ethane molecules give one methane and one propane molecule."
[2] "To make this distinction, the reaction is carried out by passing a 1.5 mLmin1 flow of a 1250:1 methane/propane mixture at 50×102 kPa over 300 mg of 1 at 250C. The alkane mixture was first contacted at room temperature and then a ramp of 250Ch1 was applied up to 250C (Figure 2)."
[3] "Since the alkane-metathesis active site can be generated from either TaIII or TaV intermediates, and since olefin metathesis would require the formation of olefins, one and two-site mechanisms can be proposed (Scheme 1), which are under investigation."

[1] "This reaction corresponds to a cross-metathesis of propane and methane."
[2] "The free energy of the reaction is slightly negative (8.2 kJmol−1 at 150°C, driven by the formation of methane)."
[3] "In the case of ethane, this reaction yields ethane, a degenerate process, which can only be detected by labeling."
[4] "The reaction conditions (batch reactor, methane/ethane reaction) were designed to detect this possible phenomenon, but were not optimized to study a productive reaction."
[5] "The alkane mixture was first contacted at room temperature and then a ramp of 250°Ch−1 was applied up to 250°C."
[6] "After the evolution of hydrogen (produced in the activation step) has ceased, the amount of ethane in the stream increases until it reaches a plateau after 1000 min."
[7] "Ethane produced initially (t<200 min) is unlabeled, clearly showing that it comes from the hydrogenolysis of propane."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the use of the active site to cleave carbon-carbon (CC) bonds in alkanes. The process typically proceeds via the formation of carbene intermediates, followed by olefin metathesis. Two-site and one-site mechanisms are possible, depending on the formation of olefins and the role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors including reaction selectivity, the efficiency of the active site, and the ability to generate olefin metathesis intermediates. The reaction conditions are optimized for detecting the phenomenon, but not necessarily for maximizing product yield. The overall reaction provides a route for transforming methane into more valuable hydrocarbon materials, enabling new processes such as replacing hydrogen in the recycling of polyolefins.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the use of a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride on silica [(SiO)2Ta-H]. This catalyst enables the transformation of a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues. The mechanism supports the reaction of methane with higher alkanes, leading to the incorporation of methane into a higher alkane through a process known as cross-metathesis. The process involves the activation of the alkane's carbon-carbon (CC) bond, followed by the rearrangement to form two new CC bonds, resulting in the production of two ethane molecules per propane molecule consumed under optimal conditions.

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. The active site for alkane metathesis can originate from either TaIII or TaV intermediates. Olefin metathesis, a crucial step in this process, necessitates the formation of olefins. The proposed mechanisms involve the generation of carbene intermediates, which play a pivotal role in the reaction pathways. These mechanisms can occur on either two sites or one site, depending on the specific reaction conditions and catalyst structure. The involvement of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates highlights the dynamic nature of these reactions. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by factors such as reaction temperature, contact time, and the ratio of reactants. The detailed mechanisms, including the formation and role of these intermediates, contribute significantly to the efficiency and effectiveness of alkane conversions through this catalytic process.
