[1] "Recently, we have shown that a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica [(SiO)2Ta-H] (1), prepared by surface organometallic chemistry,12 can catalytically transform a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues."
[2] "The reaction conditions (batch reactor, methane/ethane reaction) were designed to detect this possible phenomenon, but were not optimized to study a productive reaction."
[3] "For example for a methane/propane ratio of 1250:1 the conversion of propane can be up to 98% at 250C; the temperature and the contact time are also important parameters (kinetic)."
[4] "To make this distinction, the reaction is carried out by passing a 1.5 mLmin−1 flow of a 1250:1 methane/propane mixture at 50×102 kPa over 300 mg of 1 at 250C."
[5] "The reaction of methane with higher alkanes was further supported by running an identical reaction, in which 13C-labeled methane was used in place of unlabeled methane."
[6] "Since the alkane-metathesis active site can be generated from either TaIII or TaV intermediates, and since olefin metathesis would require the formation of olefins, one and two-site mechanisms can be proposed."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. The active site for alkane metathesis can originate from either TaIII or TaV intermediates. Olefin metathesis, a crucial step in this process, necessitates the formation of olefins. The proposed mechanisms involve the generation of carbene intermediates, which play a pivotal role in the reaction pathways. These mechanisms can occur on either two sites or one site, depending on the specific reaction conditions and catalyst structure. The involvement of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates highlights the dynamic nature of these reactions. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by factors such as reaction temperature, contact time, and the ratio of reactants. The detailed mechanisms, including the formation and role of these intermediates, contribute significantly to the efficiency and effectiveness of alkane conversions through this catalytic process.
