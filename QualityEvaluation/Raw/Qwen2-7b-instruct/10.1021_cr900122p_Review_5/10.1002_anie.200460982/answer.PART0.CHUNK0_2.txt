[1] "This reaction corresponds to a cross-metathesis of propane and methane."
[2] "The free energy of the reaction is slightly negative (8.2 kJmol−1 at 150°C, driven by the formation of methane)."
[3] "In the case of ethane, this reaction yields ethane, a degenerate process, which can only be detected by labeling."
[4] "The reaction conditions (batch reactor, methane/ethane reaction) were designed to detect this possible phenomenon, but were not optimized to study a productive reaction."
[5] "The alkane mixture was first contacted at room temperature and then a ramp of 250°Ch−1 was applied up to 250°C."
[6] "After the evolution of hydrogen (produced in the activation step) has ceased, the amount of ethane in the stream increases until it reaches a plateau after 1000 min."
[7] "Ethane produced initially (t<200 min) is unlabeled, clearly showing that it comes from the hydrogenolysis of propane."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the use of the active site to cleave carbon-carbon (CC) bonds in alkanes. The process typically proceeds via the formation of carbene intermediates, followed by olefin metathesis. Two-site and one-site mechanisms are possible, depending on the formation of olefins and the role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors including reaction selectivity, the efficiency of the active site, and the ability to generate olefin metathesis intermediates. The reaction conditions are optimized for detecting the phenomenon, but not necessarily for maximizing product yield. The overall reaction provides a route for transforming methane into more valuable hydrocarbon materials, enabling new processes such as replacing hydrogen in the recycling of polyolefins.

催化作用下由硅基支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的全面机制涉及利用活性位点断裂碳-碳（CC）键。该过程通常通过形成卡宾中间体并随后进行烯烃裂合来实现。可以提出两种站点和一种站点机制，具体取决于形成烯烃以及关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷的作用。催化剂在不同烷烃转换中的性能受反应选择性、活性位点效率和生成烯烃裂合中间体能力等因素的影响。反应条件优化用于检测现象，但不一定旨在最大化产物产率。总体反应提供了一条将甲烷转化为更有价值的碳氢化合物材料的新途径，使得在聚烯烃回收过程中用低成本的甲烷替代昂贵的氢成为可能。
