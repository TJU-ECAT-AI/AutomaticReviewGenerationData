[1] "The silica-supported transition metal hydrides (23-0-Siz)(=Si-0-),Ta-H and (Si-0-),M-H (M, chromium or tungsten) catalyze the metathesis reaction of linear or branched alkanes into the next higher and lower alkanes at moderate temperature (25" to 200C)."
[2] "With (Si-0-Si=)(=Si-0-),Ta-H, ethane was transformed at room temperature into an equimolar mixture of propane and methane."
[3] "Metathesis reactions of alkenes and alkynes,discovered a few decades ago, are now well documented and understood and are used in several industrial chemical processes."
[4] "The mechanism of the step leading to carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation likely involves a four-centered transition state between a tantalum-alkyl intermediate and a carbon-carbon a-bond of a second molecule of alkane."
[5] "The simplest case is the metathesis of ethane, which has only one C4 bond and consequently does not present any problem of selectivity."
[6] "For example, metathesis of propane yielded mainly n-butane and isobutane together with ethane, and n-butane yielded n-pentane and isopentane as well as propane; besides these main products, some higher and lower alkanes were also produced."
[7] "All the alkanes present in the medium can be presumed to compete for the adsorption."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the reaction pathways for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the catalytic cycle. The process starts with the cleavage of a C-H bond through a b-bond metathesis, forming a tantalum-alkyl species. This is followed by the transfer of a methyl group from one alkane molecule to another, involving the cleavage and formation of C-C bonds. This step is often proposed to proceed via a four-centered transition state with an sp3 carbon in the middle of the metallocycle, facilitating the transfer of hydrogen from one alkane molecule to the methyl ligand. The final step regenerates the active species, the tantalum-ethyl surface complex, by releasing methane and enabling the reaction's continuous cycle. The catalyst's performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as the selectivity towards higher and lower homologs, the role of key intermediates, and the competition among alkanes for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface. The mechanism explains the formation of a variety of alkanes with different carbon chain lengths as products, depending on the initial alkane and the reaction conditions.

催化由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的烷烃互换机制的全面分析涉及理解线性和环烷烃转化的反应途径。关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们在催化循环中起着关键作用。过程始于通过b键互换裂解C-H键，形成钽-烷基物种。随后是将一个甲基团从一个烷烃分子转移到另一个烷烃分子，涉及到C-C键的断裂和形成。这一步通常被提议通过一个包含sp3碳在金属环中心的四中心过渡状态进行，促进从一个烷烃分子向甲基配体转移氢原子。最后一步通过释放甲烷并重新生成活性物种，即钽-乙基表面复合物，来再生催化剂，从而使得反应的连续周期得以进行。催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能受到诸如更高和更低同系物的选择性、关键中间体的作用以及烷烃在催化剂表面的竞争吸附等因素的影响。该机制解释了根据初始烷烃和反应条件的不同，形成不同碳链长度的各种烷烃作为产物。
