[1] "Metathesis of Alkanes Catalyzed by Silica-Supported Transition Metal Hydrides"
[2] "We report observations of a catalytic reaction that we designate "metathesis of alkanes" and which, to our knowledge, has not previously been reported (3)."
[3] "The metathesis reaction proceeds by both the cleavage and the formation of the C-C bonds of acyclic alkanes, which are transformed into a mixture of higher and lower homologs."
[4] "It was observed in the presence of various silica-supported metal-hydride catalysts, particularly tantalum hydride (4), all prepared by the surface organometallic chemistry route (5,6)."
[5] "When [Ta],-H was contacted at room temperature with a cyclic alkane (4, 13), no catalytic reaction occurred."
[6] "Only a C-H bond activation was observed, which led to the stoichiometric formation of a tantalum (111)-cycloalkyl species with the evolution of 1 mol of hydrogen."
[7] "When higher linear alkanes were used, several higher and lower homologs were produced, because various C-H and C-C bonds can be involved."
[8] "For example, metathesis of propane yielded mainly n-butane and isobutane together with ethane, and n-butane yielded n-pentane and isopentane as well as propane."
[9] "The simplest case is the metathesis of ethane, which has only one C-C bond and consequently does not present any problem of selectivity."
[10] "This suggests, as observed for ethane, that the main reaction involves the transfer of a methyl fragment from one molecule of the initial alkane to a second one."
[11] "The occurrence of the two processes can hardly be distinguished; secondary reactions can take place as the reaction proceeds and the conversion increases."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, we find that the process involves the cleavage and formation of C-C bonds in acyclic alkanes. This results in the transformation of the alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologs. The reaction occurs in the presence of silica-supported metal-hydride catalysts, specifically tantalum hydride, which is prepared through the surface organometallic chemistry route. The mechanism includes the activation of a C-H bond, leading to the formation of a tantalum-cycloalkyl species. The reaction also involves the transfer of methyl fragments from one alkane molecule to another, which contributes to the formation of various products. Secondary reactions, including the transfer of higher alkyl fragments, can occur as the conversion increases. This mechanism allows for the production of a wide range of products from a single alkane, demonstrating the versatility and efficiency of this catalytic process.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃互换机制，我们发现该过程涉及链烷烃中C-C键的断裂和形成。这导致链烷烃转化为一系列更高和更低同系物的混合物。反应在二氧化硅支持的金属氢化物催化剂的存在下发生，特别是钽氢化物，通过表面有机金属化学途径制备。机制包括激活C-H键，产生钽环烷基物种。反应还包括从一个烷烃分子到另一个分子转移甲基片段的过程，这有助于形成各种产物。随着转化率的增加，可能会发生二级反应，包括转移更高的烷基片段。这种机制允许从单个烷烃生产一系列产品，显示出这一催化过程的多样性和效率。
