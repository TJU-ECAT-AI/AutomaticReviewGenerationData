          [1] "The silica-supported transition metal hydrides (23-0-Siz)(=Si-0-),Ta-H and (Si-0-),M-H (M, chromium or tungsten) catalyze the metathesis reaction of linear or branched alkanes into the next higher and lower alkanes at moderate temperature (25" to 200C)."
          [2] "With (Si-0-Si=)(=Si-0-),Ta-H, ethane was transformed at room temperature into an equimolar mixture of propane and methane."
          [3] "Metathesis reactions of alkanes seem to involve, at least to some extent, the reaction of all C-C bonds."
          [4] "In the case of ethane, secondary reactions seem to occur very soon with the appearance of butane and especially isobutane, the formation of which necessarily arises from a secondary reaction of propane."
          [5] "Among the known elementary steps, two possibilities can be considered: (i) The oxidative addition of the ethane C-C bond (16) would yield the dim- ethyl(ethyl)tantalum(V) surface complex; reduction of propane from this complex could follow, with the concomitant release of a tantallm-methyl species."
          [6] "Such a mechanism is also operating in the case of higher alkanes. For example, the formation of n-butane and isobutane from propane is determined in the first step of C-H bond activation, which yields two species, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-iso-propyl surface complexes (Scheme 3)."
          [7] "The metathesis of isobutane is particularly interesting with respect to the product distribution."
          [8] "Despite this, the production of neopentane resulting from the methyl transfer step on the tantalum-tert-butyl occurs in substantial amounts."

          Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the reaction pathways for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the catalytic cycle. The process starts with the cleavage of a C-H bond through a b-bond metathesis, forming a tantalum-alkyl species. This is followed by the transfer of a methyl group from one alkane molecule to another, involving the cleavage and formation of C-C bonds. This step is often proposed to proceed via a four-centered transition state with an sp3 carbon in the middle of the metallocycle, facilitating the transfer of hydrogen from one alkane molecule to the methyl ligand. The final step regenerates the active species, the tantalum-ethyl surface complex, by releasing methane and enabling the reaction's continuous cycle. The catalyst's performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as the selectivity towards higher and lower homologs, the role of key intermediates, and the competition among alkanes for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface. The mechanism explains the formation of a variety of alkanes with different carbon chain lengths as products, depending on the initial alkane and the reaction conditions.

          催化由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的烷烃互换机制的全面分析涉及理解线性和环烷烃转化的反应途径。关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们在催化循环中起着关键作用。过程始于通过b键互换裂解C-H键，形成钽-烷基物种。随后是将一个甲基团从一个烷烃分子转移到另一个烷烃分子，涉及到C-C键的断裂和形成。这一步通常被提议通过一个包含sp3碳在金属环中心的四中心过渡状态进行，促进从一个烷烃分子向甲基配体转移氢原子。最后一步通过释放甲烷并重新生成活性物种，即钽-乙基表面复合物，来再生催化剂，从而使得反应的连续周期得以进行。催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能受到诸如更高和更低同系物的选择性、关键中间体的作用以及烷烃在催化剂表面的竞争吸附等因素的影响。该机制解释了根据初始烷烃和反应条件的不同，形成不同碳链长度的各种烷烃作为产物。

          [2] "Metathesis reactions of alkanes seem to involve, at least to some extent, the reaction of all C-C bonds."
          [3] "This suggests, as observed for ethane, that the main reaction involves the transfer of a methyl fragment from one molecule of the initial alkane to a second one; the wider product distribution observed with higher alkanes (for example, butane and pentane) (Fig. 2) also suggests the probable occurrence of secondary reactions, the possible transfer of higher alkyl fragments such as ethyl, or both."
          [4] "In the case of ethane, secondary reactions seem to occur very soon with the appearance of butane and especially isobutane."
          [5] "Branched alkanes such as isobutane or methyl butane also underwent the metathesis reaction; however, neopentane only led to the stoichiometric formation of a surface tantalum-neopentyl species and did not react further, probably for steric reasons."
          [6] "The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the formation of C-C bonds."
          [7] "Among the known elementary steps, two possibilities can be considered: (i) The oxidative addition of the ethane C-C bond (16) would yield the dimethyl(ethyl)tantalum(V) surface complex;"
          [8] "The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second propane molecule to these propyl intermediates enables the evolution of n-butane and isobutane as well as the formation of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in turn will yield ethane."
          [9] "The metathesis of isobutane is particularly interesting with respect to the product distribution."
          [10] "We can expect that the formation of the tantalum-tert-butyl species can be disfavored (relative to that of the other possible tantalum-isobutyl complex) for steric reasons."

          Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the reaction pathways for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the catalytic cycle. The process begins with the cleavage of a C-H bond in an acyclic alkane, such as ethane, through a bond metathesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl species. The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group, necessitating the cleavage and formation of C-C bonds. Two possibilities exist for this step: oxidative addition or a bond metathesis mechanism. The oxidative addition yields a dimethyl(ethyl)tantalum(V) surface complex, while the bond metathesis mechanism involves a four-centered transition state with an sp3 carbon in the middle of the metallocycle. This mechanism operates similarly for higher alkanes, such as propane, leading to the formation of n-butane and isobutane, followed by the formation of a tantalum-ethyl complex. In the case of branched alkanes, such as isobutane, the formation of neopentane results from the methyl transfer step on the tantalum-tert-butyl species, although this is disfavored due to steric reasons. The metathesis reaction produces a wide range of hydrocarbons, including higher and lower homologs, with ethane undergoing a rapid secondary reaction leading to the formation of butane and especially isobutane. The catalyst's performance varies depending on the alkane's structure, with neopentane showing a different behavior compared to other branched alkanes due to steric hindrance.

          分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃互换机制涉及理解线性和环烷烃转化的反应途径。关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们在催化循环中起着关键作用。过程开始于在无环烷烃，如乙烷中通过键裂合裂解一个C-H键，产生氢气和一个钽-烷基物种。下一步涉及转移甲基，需要裂解和形成C-C键。有两种可能的方式进行此步骤：氧化添加或键裂合机制。氧化添加会产生二甲基(乙基)钽(V)表面复合物，而键裂合机制涉及四个中心过渡状态，其中sp3碳位于金属周期的中间。这种机制对于更高烷烃，如丙烷，也有效，导致形成正丁烷和异丁烷，随后形成一个钽-乙基复合物。对于支链烷烃，如异丁烷，从钽-叔丁基物种转移甲基会导致叔戊烷的形成，尽管这受到立体位阻的原因而被抑制。裂合反应产生一系列烃类，包括较高和较低同系物，乙烷经历快速的二级反应，导致但烷和尤其是异丁烷的形成。催化剂的性能根据烷烃的结构而变化，与其它支链烷烃相比，异戊烷表现出不同的行为，这是由于立体位阻原因。
