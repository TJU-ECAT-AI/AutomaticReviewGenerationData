[1] "Metathesis of Alkanes Catalyzed by Silica-Supported Transition Metal Hydrides"
[2] "The mechanism of the step leading to carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation likely involves a four-centered transition state between a tantalum-alkyl intermediate and a carbon-carbon a-bond of a second molecule of alkane."
[3] "In the case of ethane, this step of C-C bond formation and cleavage enables the liberation of propane and the formation of a tantalum-methyl surface complex."
[4] "Regarding the mechanism of the reaction (15) (Scheme I), we assume that in a first step, a C-H bond of acyclic alkane (for example, ethane) is cleaved by a a-bond metathesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl (for example, ethyl) species; this elementary step is indeed observed during the C-H bond activation of cycloalkanes on the [Ta],-H species, yielding the corresponding tantalum-cycloalkyl surface complexes (Eq. I), and occurs without modification of the oxidation state of the metal (4)."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, the process involves the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds through a four-centered transition state. In the case of ethane, the step of bond formation and cleavage liberates propane and forms a tantalum-methyl surface complex. The mechanism starts with a C-H bond cleavage by a bond metathesis, creating a tantalum-alkyl species. This elementary step is observed in the C-H bond activation of cycloalkanes, forming corresponding tantalum-cycloalkyl surface complexes without altering the metal's oxidation state. The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second alkane molecule leads to the evolution of the desired alkane and the formation of a tantalum-ethyl complex, contributing to the reaction's selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

催化由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的烷烃裂合机制的全面分析，过程涉及碳-碳键的断裂和形成通过四中心过渡状态。对于乙烷来说，键形成和断裂步骤释放丙烷并形成钽-甲基表面复合物。该机制以C-H键断裂为起点，通过键裂解产生钽-烷基物种。这一基本步骤在环烷烃的C-H键活化中被观察到，形成相应的钽-环烷基表面复合物，而不改变金属的氧化态。随后，从第二个烷烃分子中转移一个甲基团导致所需烷烃的生成以及形成钽-乙基复合物，这有助于反应的选择性和催化剂性能在各种烷烃转换中的表现。
