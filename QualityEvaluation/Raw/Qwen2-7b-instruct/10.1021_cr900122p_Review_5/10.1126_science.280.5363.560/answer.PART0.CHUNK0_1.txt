[1] "In this case, conductivity appears to proceed through a pro-tonic mechanism (19); this mechanism is not a serious limitation to the generality of the concepts, which are based on a control of the morphology."
[2] "Chemically, P4VP resembles in several ways main-chain conjugated polymers such as polyaniline,poly(p-pyridine), poly(p-pyridine vinylene) (20, 21), and possibly even polypyrrole."

The conductivity in the context discussed appears to follow a protonic mechanism, which doesn't pose a significant limitation to the broader concepts that hinge on controlling the structure's morphology. The material P4VP shares chemical similarities with other main-chain conjugated polymers including polyaniline, poly(p-pyridine), poly(p-pyridine vinylene), and potentially polypyrrole.

在讨论中提到的导电性似乎遵循一种质子机制，这种机制对依赖于控制结构形态的概念没有重大限制。材料P4VP在化学性质上与聚苯胺、聚(吡啶)、聚(吡啶乙烯基)以及可能的聚吡咯等主链共轭聚合物有相似之处。
