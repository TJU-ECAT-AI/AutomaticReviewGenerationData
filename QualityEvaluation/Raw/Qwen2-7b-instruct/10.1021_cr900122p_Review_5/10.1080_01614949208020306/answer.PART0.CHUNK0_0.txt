<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The process includes the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes into alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play crucial roles in determining reaction selectivity and catalyst performance during various alkane conversions.
