<p>An investigation of the radioactive emanation produced by thorium compounds. I. By E. Rutherford, M.A., D.sc., and F. Soddy, B.A.</p>
<p>The main questions examined by the authors are (1) Can thoria, the emanating power of which has been largely destroyed by ignition,have this property restored to it by chemical treatment ? (2) Is eman- ating power to be regarded as a specific property of thorium, or is it due to the presence of a foreign material!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The electrical methods employed for the measurement of emanating power and radioactivity depend on the universal property of the radiations from substances known as radioactive of ionising or producing charged carriers from the gas through which they pass whereby the gas is rendered capable of conducting a current of electricity.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The authors investigate the radioactive emanation produced by thorium compounds, focusing on whether the emanating power can be restored through chemical treatment after being destroyed by ignition. They also explore if the emanating power is a specific property of thorium or due to a foreign material. The measurement methods rely on the radiations' ability to ionize gases, allowing the passage of charged carriers and thus enabling electrical conductivity.

作者研究了钍化合物产生的放射性逸出物，重点探讨了在燃烧破坏后，通过化学处理是否可以恢复其发射能力。他们还探索了发射能力是否是钍的特定性质，还是由于存在外来物质所致。测量方法依赖于辐射物产生气体离子化的能力，允许带电粒子通过，从而实现电流传导。

<p>The polymerisation of cyanic acid : cyanuric acid and cyamelide.</p>
<p>I n  the polymerisation of liquid cyanic acid, cyamelide is not the only product.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The polymerization of liquid cyanic acid results in the formation of both cyamelide and cyanuric acid, indicating that cyamelide is not the sole product.
