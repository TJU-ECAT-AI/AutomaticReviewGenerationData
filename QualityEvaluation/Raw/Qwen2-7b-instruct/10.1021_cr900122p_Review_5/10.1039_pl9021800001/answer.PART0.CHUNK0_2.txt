The document does not provide detailed mechanisms or descriptions of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. Therefore, I am unable to provide answers to the questions about alkane metathesis based on the provided document.
