<p>The authors conclusion that the influence upon the conducting power of air or other gas interposed between oppositely electrified surfaces is due, not to an imponderable force radiating from the molecules of thoria, but to the escape in minute quantity of some substance which is mixed with the thoria, and which can be dissolved and precipitated, was of very great interest.</p>
<p>I n  the same way as in chemical reaction, the active mass of a reacting solid appears indepen- dent of its quantity, so the rate of the change, of which emanating power is a measure, does not depend solely or even mainly on the quantity of emanating material present, The removal of the latter is consequently not accompanied by corresponding changes in the eman- ating power.</p>

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, the catalyst facilitates the transfer of alkyl groups between adjacent alkane molecules to form new alkenes and regenerate the catalyst. In the one-site scheme, the catalyst undergoes a series of reactions to transform one alkane molecule into another alkene. The formation of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, plays a crucial role in determining the reaction pathways and product selectivity. The processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations are complex, involving the breaking and formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as the structure of the silica support, the nature of the tantalum hydride, and the reaction conditions. The catalyst's ability to efficiently promote the desired alkane metathesis reactions while maintaining high selectivity is critical for industrial applications.
