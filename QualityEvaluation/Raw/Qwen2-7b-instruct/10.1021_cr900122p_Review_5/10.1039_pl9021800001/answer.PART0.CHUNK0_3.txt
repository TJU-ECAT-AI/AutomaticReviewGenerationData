1. The conclusion that the effect on the conductivity of air or other gas placed between oppositely charged surfaces comes not from a radiating force from thorium molecules, but from a minute substance mixed with thorium that can be dissolved and precipitated, is significant.

2. The authors deduce that the emanation shares properties with the elements of the argon group, based on the invariance of certain gases under the action of the employed reagents.

3. Water vapor enhances and drying diminishes the normal emanating power, with the extremes differing by a ratio of 2:1. Cooling counteracts warming.

4. The investigation into the chemical nature of the emanation reveals its chemical inertness characteristic of argon family elements.

5. The chemical analysis of the thorium-free active substances, precipitated with sodium phosphate, indicates the presence of an unknown substance.

6. The emanation is concluded to be akin to the properties of argon group elements, based on the unchanged behavior of known gases under the tested reagents.

1. 结论指出，影响空气或放置在反向电荷表面之间的其他气体的导电性并非来自钍分子的不可见力辐射，而是来自与钍混合的一种微量物质，该物质可以溶解和沉淀。

2. 作者根据所有试剂作用下不变的气体行动判断，散发物与氩族元素的属性相关联。

3. 水蒸气增强而干燥降低正常散发功率，极端差异为2:1。冷却对抗升温。

4. 对自身性质的调查显示，这种散发物具有与氩族元素特征相符的化学惰性。

5. 化学分析发现，在用磷酸钠沉淀的溶液中存在未知物质的痕迹。

6. 根据所有试剂作用下已知气体的行为不变这一事实，得出结论，散发物与氩族元素的属性相似。
