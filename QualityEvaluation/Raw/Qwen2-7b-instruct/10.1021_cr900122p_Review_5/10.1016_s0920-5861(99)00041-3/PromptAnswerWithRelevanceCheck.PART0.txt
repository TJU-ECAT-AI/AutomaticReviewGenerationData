[1] "Amongst the factors which affect the selectivity to olens in the oxydehydrogenation of parafns over vanadium oxide-based catalysts, particular impor- tance has been attributed to the average oxidation state of the vanadium."
[2] "In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, a catalyst for the oxydehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes and butadiene, the results of pulse tests showed that the selectivity to the desired product increased rapidly as the catalyst was progressively reduced (i.e. with increasing hydrocarbon pulse number)."
[3] "In the case of propane oxidation, the higher reac- tivity of the CH bond makes the contribution of homogeneous reactions more likely than in the case of ethane."
[4] "In the case of isobutane oxydehydrogenation to isobutene over P/W, Keggin-type heteropolycom- pounds, the contribution of homogeneous radical pro- cesses has also been postulated to play a fundamental role."

1. The average oxidation state of vanadium plays a significant role in determining the selectivity to the products in the oxydehydrogenation of parafns over vanadium oxide-based catalysts.

2. As the alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalyst is progressively reduced, the selectivity to the desired product in the oxydehydrogenation of n-butane increases rapidly.

3. The higher reactivity of the CH bond in propane makes the contribution of homogeneous reactions more probable compared to ethane in the context of propane oxidation.

4. The contribution of homogeneous radical processes has been hypothesized to play a crucial role in the oxydehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene over P/W, Keggin-type heteropoly compounds.

[1] "In this paper, after a brief summary of the main aspects, which have been claimed as fundamental for the control of catalytic performance in the selective oxidation of alkanes, attention is focused on the following: (i) role of the redox properties of the active sites for catalysts based on reducible metal oxides, and (ii) role of the nonredox activation of hydrocarbons and of radical reactions in affecting the catalytic performance for catalysts based on nonreducible metal oxides."
[2] "Examples of the points which have been considered as key factors in determining the pathway of alkane transformation to the product of selective oxidation are:"
[3] "The role of different vanadium phosphate phases, and of the valence state of vanadium in the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride has been widely studied."
[4] "A better understanding of each one of the above factors means a better comprehension of the overall process of alkane transformation, and hence an improved possibility of increasing the catalytic performance to make these processes more attractive from an industrial point of view."
[5] "In conclusion, when the mechanism of parafn oxidation also involves homogeneous reactions, the selectivity to olens may become considerably higher than for completely heterogeneous mechanisms provided that the olen is stable enough to resist consecutive degradation reactions."
[6] "In the case of methane oxidative coupling, where most active catalysts are those based on alkaline earth oxides, doped with alkali metal ions, but the same class of catalysts has also been found to be active and selective in the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene."

1. This paper emphasizes the importance of the redox properties of active sites in catalysts based on reducible metal oxides and the role of non-redox activation of hydrocarbons and radical reactions in catalysts based on nonreducible metal oxides for controlling catalytic performance in selective alkane oxidation.

2. Key factors influencing the pathway of alkane transformation to desired products include the role of adsorbed oxygen species, the mode of alkane adsorption, the mechanism of activation of the C-H bond, the stability of products, the nondesorption of reaction intermediates, the ratio between olefin dehydrogenation and oxygen insertion, the nature of the reaction intermediate, the contribution of homogeneous reactions, and the effect of coadsorbates.

3. The study of vanadium phosphate phases and the valence state of vanadium plays a crucial role in the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride.

4. A deeper insight into these factors leads to a better understanding of the overall alkane transformation process and enhances the possibility of improving catalytic performance, making these processes more industrially attractive.

5. When the reaction mechanism includes homogeneous reactions, the selectivity to olefins can significantly exceed that of completely heterogeneous reactions, provided that the olefin is stable enough to resist further degradation reactions.

6. Active catalysts for methane oxidative coupling are mostly alkaline earth oxides doped with alkali metal ions, which are also effective and selective in the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene.

[1] "Some aspects concerning the chemistry of oxidative transformation of parafns catalyzed by different classes of materials are examined. Attention is given mainly to: (i) the role of the redox properties of transition metal oxide-based systems, and (ii) the contribution of radical-type, homogeneous and heterogeneously-initiated homogeneous reactions over nonreducible metal oxide catalysts."
[2] "The general picture that can be drawn on the basis of the most important factors which are examined in these reviews clearly shows that the problem of parafn conversion and of selectivity to the desired product has to be solved within a complex framework of inter-related aspects."
[3] "In this paper, after a brief summary of the main aspects, which have been claimed as fundamental for the control of catalytic performance in the selective oxidation of alkanes, attention is focused on the following: (i) role of the redox properties of the active sites for catalysts based on reducible metal oxides, and (ii) role of the nonredox activation of hydrocarbons and of radical reactions in affecting the catalytic performance for catalysts based on nonreducible metal oxides."
[4] "In fact, the mechanism which operates is completely heterogeneous and includes the formation of an intermediate alkoxy species (or alkyl radical species)."
[5] "Some examples can be found in the literature where the importance of the redox properties of the active sites in determining the catalytic performance is emphasized."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. Two-site schemes refer to the simultaneous formation of two alkyl radicals, which then undergo further reactions to form alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. One-site schemes involve the sequential formation of a single alkyl radical, followed by the transformation of the radical into an alkene and then into a metallacyclobutane. Key intermediates in the linear alkane transformations include alkenes, while cyclic alkane transformations involve the formation of metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the formation and stability of these intermediates, as well as the efficiency of the redox processes. The role of redox properties of the active sites plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance, particularly in the context of the redox reactions occurring during alkane metathesis. The one-site and two-site schemes contribute to the overall selectivity and efficiency of the catalyst in alkane conversions.

烷烃互变异构催化由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的全面机制涉及双位点和单位点方案。双位点方案指的是同时形成两个烷基自由基，然后进一步反应形成烯烃和金属环丁烷。单位点方案涉及到单个烷基自由基的顺序形成，随后将自由基转化为烯烃，然后转化为金属环丁烷。线性烷烃转化的关键中间体包括烯烃，而环烷烃转化则涉及金属环丁烷的形成。在各种烷烃转换中，中间体的形成和稳定性以及红ox过程的效率影响选择性和催化剂性能。活性位点的红ox性质在确定催化性能时起着关键作用，特别是在烷烃互变异构过程中发生的红ox反应的背景下。双位点和单位点方案对整体选择性和催化剂在烷烃转换中的效率做出了贡献。
