[1] "In this paper, after a brief summary of the main aspects, which have been claimed as fundamental for the control of catalytic performance in the selective oxidation of alkanes, attention is focused on the following: (i) role of the redox properties of the active sites for catalysts based on reducible metal oxides, and (ii) role of the nonredox activation of hydrocarbons and of radical reactions in affecting the catalytic performance for catalysts based on nonreducible metal oxides."
[2] "Examples of the points which have been considered as key factors in determining the pathway of alkane transformation to the product of selective oxidation are:"
[3] "The role of different vanadium phosphate phases, and of the valence state of vanadium in the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride has been widely studied."
[4] "A better understanding of each one of the above factors means a better comprehension of the overall process of alkane transformation, and hence an improved possibility of increasing the catalytic performance to make these processes more attractive from an industrial point of view."
[5] "In conclusion, when the mechanism of parafn oxidation also involves homogeneous reactions, the selectivity to olens may become considerably higher than for completely heterogeneous mechanisms provided that the olen is stable enough to resist consecutive degradation reactions."
[6] "In the case of methane oxidative coupling, where most active catalysts are those based on alkaline earth oxides, doped with alkali metal ions, but the same class of catalysts has also been found to be active and selective in the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene."

1. This paper emphasizes the importance of the redox properties of active sites in catalysts based on reducible metal oxides and the role of non-redox activation of hydrocarbons and radical reactions in catalysts based on nonreducible metal oxides for controlling catalytic performance in selective alkane oxidation.

2. Key factors influencing the pathway of alkane transformation to desired products include the role of adsorbed oxygen species, the mode of alkane adsorption, the mechanism of activation of the C-H bond, the stability of products, the nondesorption of reaction intermediates, the ratio between olefin dehydrogenation and oxygen insertion, the nature of the reaction intermediate, the contribution of homogeneous reactions, and the effect of coadsorbates.

3. The study of vanadium phosphate phases and the valence state of vanadium plays a crucial role in the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride.

4. A deeper insight into these factors leads to a better understanding of the overall alkane transformation process and enhances the possibility of improving catalytic performance, making these processes more industrially attractive.

5. When the reaction mechanism includes homogeneous reactions, the selectivity to olefins can significantly exceed that of completely heterogeneous reactions, provided that the olefin is stable enough to resist further degradation reactions.

6. Active catalysts for methane oxidative coupling are mostly alkaline earth oxides doped with alkali metal ions, which are also effective and selective in the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene.
