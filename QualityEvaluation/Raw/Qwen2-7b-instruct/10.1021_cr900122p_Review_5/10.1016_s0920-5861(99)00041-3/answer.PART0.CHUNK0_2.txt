[1] "Amongst the factors which affect the selectivity to olens in the oxydehydrogenation of parafns over vanadium oxide-based catalysts, particular impor- tance has been attributed to the average oxidation state of the vanadium."
[2] "In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, a catalyst for the oxydehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes and butadiene, the results of pulse tests showed that the selectivity to the desired product increased rapidly as the catalyst was progressively reduced (i.e. with increasing hydrocarbon pulse number)."
[3] "In the case of propane oxidation, the higher reac- tivity of the CH bond makes the contribution of homogeneous reactions more likely than in the case of ethane."
[4] "In the case of isobutane oxydehydrogenation to isobutene over P/W, Keggin-type heteropolycom- pounds, the contribution of homogeneous radical pro- cesses has also been postulated to play a fundamental role."

1. The average oxidation state of vanadium plays a significant role in determining the selectivity to the products in the oxydehydrogenation of parafns over vanadium oxide-based catalysts.

2. As the alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalyst is progressively reduced, the selectivity to the desired product in the oxydehydrogenation of n-butane increases rapidly.

3. The higher reactivity of the CH bond in propane makes the contribution of homogeneous reactions more probable compared to ethane in the context of propane oxidation.

4. The contribution of homogeneous radical processes has been hypothesized to play a crucial role in the oxydehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene over P/W, Keggin-type heteropoly compounds.

1. 钒的平均氧化态在决定烷烃过氧化氢化过程中产物的选择性时起着重要作用。

2. 当铝氧化的钒氧化物催化剂逐渐被还原时，丙烷氢解生成目标产物的专一性会迅速提高。

3. 由于丙烷中C-H键的高反应性，使得在丙烷氧化过程中同质反应的贡献比乙烷更可能。

4. 在P/W、Keggin型杂多酸化合物上进行异丁烷氢解生成异丁烯的过程中，已假设同质自由基过程的贡献起到了关键作用。
