Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

Two-site and one-site schemes refer to the locations on the catalyst surface where the alkane metathesis reaction occurs. Two-site schemes involve interactions at two distinct sites on the catalyst surface, whereas one-site schemes involve interactions at a single site. These schemes influence the efficiency and selectivity of the metathesis reaction.

Linear alkane transformations involve the rearrangement of carbon-carbon single bonds in linear alkanes to form new alkenes or other linear alkanes. Cyclic alkane transformations, on the other hand, involve the rearrangement of carbon-carbon single bonds in cyclic alkanes to form new cyclic alkanes or other cyclic compounds. These transformations are facilitated by the presence of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes.

Alkenes are formed during the metathesis reaction, serving as intermediates that facilitate the rearrangement of alkane structures. Metallacyclobutanes, containing a metal atom and a cyclobutane ring, are also crucial intermediates that play a role in the transformation of cyclic alkane structures.

Reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by factors such as the presence and stability of these intermediates, the efficiency of the interactions between the catalyst surface and alkane molecules, and the specific conditions under which the reactions occur. The selectivity of the metathesis reaction can be optimized by controlling these factors to ensure that the desired alkane structures are produced with minimal formation of unwanted byproducts.

In conclusion, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the interactions at different sites on the catalyst surface, the role of key intermediates, and the optimization of reaction conditions to achieve high selectivity and efficient alkane conversions.
