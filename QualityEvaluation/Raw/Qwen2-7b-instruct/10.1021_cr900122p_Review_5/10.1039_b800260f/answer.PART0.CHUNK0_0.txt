[1] "Often close-packed surfaces give the highest and very open structures like steps the lowest values of b, but this need not be so for all molecules."
[2] "For extended transition states different surface structures will give different BEP lines."
[3] "We note that a very strong structure dependence can appear in surface science experiments as an absence of structure sensitivity."
[4] "One of the important differ- ences between ultra-high vacuum surface science experiments and real heterogeneous catalysis is that the catalytic reac- tions occur at significant gas pressures."
