The document discusses the nature of active sites in heterogeneous metal catalysis, highlighting that different classes of reactions have distinct active sites and varying dependencies on particle size. It explains that the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relations, derived from electronic structure calculations of adsorption on metal surfaces, are crucial in understanding the structure dependence of catalytic reactions. The BEP lines, influenced by the local structure of the reaction site, determine the geometrical and electronic effects of individual elementary reactions. This decomposition helps in systematically analyzing the structure sensitivity of reactions. The document further delves into the classification of structure sensitivity in catalytic reactions, proposing rules to identify the nature of active sites based on the degree of structure sensitivity. Examples are provided to illustrate the classification, showing how different catalysts behave under various conditions, especially regarding their reactivity towards specific molecules like methane, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. The Sabatier analysis is used to link BEP relations to trends in catalytic reaction rates, elucidating how the reactivity of the catalytic surface affects the over-all reaction rate. The document concludes with a summary emphasizing the importance of the BEP relations and the Sabatier analysis in comprehending the complex interactions between metal surfaces and reactants in catalytic processes.
