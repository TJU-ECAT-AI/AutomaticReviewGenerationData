[1] "A two-functions-in-one catalyst precursor allows an olefin metathesis catalyst to be turned into an alkane metathesis catalyst."
[2] "Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride3 prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
[3] "This system involves a single metal with dual properties and shows that ancillary ligands are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions."
[4] "The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources."
[5] "When propane (540 equiv) is brought into contact with 1a at 150C in a batch reactor, it is converted into mainly ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%)."
[6] "Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion."
[7] "Note that this well-defined catalyst precursor achieves about the same TON (55) in 120 h as the original tantalum hydride catalyst supported on silica (TON=60) despite the presence of ancillary ligands."
[8] "Firstly, 2,2-dimethylpropane is probably formed by exchange of the neopentyl by a propyl ligand, either directly through σ-bond metathesis or in two steps through CH activation on the neopentylidene unit followed by a decomposition of the penta-coordinated complex through an α-H abstraction to regenerate an alkylidene alkyl/Mo center (1b, R=Et, R=tBu; Scheme 2)."
[9] "Secondly, 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpentane are probably obtained through cross-metathesis of the neopentylidene ligand attached to the Mo center and a propene moiety, which results from β-H transfer on the propyl chain in 1b, followed by metathesis and subsequent similar reverse steps."
[10] "Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."
[11] "Therefore, the propagation step is probably hindered by the olefin-metathesis step, which would require a disfavored [2+2] cycloaddition between a disubstituted carbene and a disubstituted olefin."

[6] "Note that the alkane cross-metathesis products are obtained in a 3.4:1 ratio, which is very close to the ratio of olefin cross-metathesis products 3,3-dimethylbutene and (E)-4,4-dimethyl-2-pentene, obtained during the metathesis of propene on 1a (that is, 2.7:1), and this is consistent with the proposed elementary steps, and especially with olefin metathesis being the key carboncarbon bond-formation step."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism involves a single metal, molybdenum, with dual properties, enabling it to act as both an olefin metathesis catalyst and an alkane metathesis catalyst. Ancillary ligands, like the imido group, play a crucial role in controlling the reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts.

In the metathesis of propane, the main products are ethane, butane, methane, isobutane, and pentanes, with selectivities of 56.1%, 35.3%, 0.1%, 2.7%, and 5.9%, respectively. The turnover frequency is constant for 40 hours, indicating efficient catalyst performance.

Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, facilitate the transformation of linear alkanes. For instance, 2,2-dimethylpropane is likely formed through the exchange of a neopentyl ligand by a propyl ligand, either directly or through a series of steps involving CH activation and α-H abstraction. The ratio of alkane cross-metathesis products closely matches that of olefin cross-metathesis products, supporting the proposed mechanism where olefin metathesis is the key carbon-carbon bond-forming step.

In conclusion, the silica-supported molybdenum complex catalyzes alkane metathesis efficiently, showing that ancillary ligands can be used effectively, and the selectivity of the products reflects the importance of π-bond metathesis as the primary carbon-carbon bond-breaking and forming step.

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes and intermediates. Initially, the catalyst is prepared through surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) to support the tantalum hydride on silica. Kinetic and structure-reactivity relationship studies indicate that π-bond metathesis, the interaction of an olefin and a carbene, is the primary carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation process. Alkylidene hydrides serve as critical intermediates in this mechanism. 

At low temperatures, the conversion of alkanes is of interest due to the optimization of oil resources. The turnover frequency remains constant for a period, showing the efficiency of the catalyst. Beyond this point, a reproducible decrease in conversion is observed. In the case of 2,2-dimethylpropane formation, the mechanism involves the exchange of a neopentyl ligand by a propyl ligand through σ-bond metathesis or two steps involving CH activation. This process is consistent with the observed product selectivity. Butane shows greater selectivity compared to pentane when starting from specific catalyst configurations, indicating the influence of structural factors on the mechanism.

The formation of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, plays a crucial role in the mechanism. The single-site mechanism describes the generation of olefins and metathesis, while the possibility of involving two sites further enhances the complexity and efficiency of the catalytic process. The selectivity of the alkane metathesis products is attributed to the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates, which is consistent with the observed product distribution.

In summary, the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst facilitates alkane metathesis through a combination of single-site and potentially dual-site mechanisms. The formation of key intermediates and the minimization of steric hindrances contribute to the high selectivity and efficiency of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制，讨论双站点和单站点方案、线性和环状烷烃转化过程、关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其在不同烷烃转化中对反应选择性和催化剂性能的贡献。

由表面有机金属化学（SOMC）制备的二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合机制涉及几个关键过程和中间体。最初，通过SOMC准备催化剂以支持钽氢化物在二氧化硅上。基于动力学和结构反应性关系的研究表明，π键裂合是碳碳键断裂和形成的主导过程，其中烯烃和卡宾之间的相互作用起着关键作用。烷基二烯氢化物作为这一机制的关键中间体。

在较低温度下，烷烃的转换引起了人们的兴趣，因为这有助于优化石油资源。催化剂的周转频率在一定时间内保持不变，显示出其效率。之后，观察到转化率有规律地降低。对于2,2-二甲基丙烷的形成，机制涉及通过σ键裂合或两个步骤的CH活化交换一个新戊基配体为一个丙基配体。这个过程与观察到的产品选择性一致。但烷相对于戊烷表现出更高的选择性，当从特定催化剂配置开始时，这表明结构因素对机制的影响。

关键中间体的形成，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，在机制中发挥着关键作用。单站点机制描述了烯烃的生成和裂合，而可能涉及两个站点进一步增加了催化过程的复杂性和效率。选择性产物的形成归因于在金属环丁烷中间体中最小化立体位阻，这与观察到的产品分布一致。

综上所述，二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化剂通过结合单站点和潜在的双站点机制促进烷烃裂合。关键中间体的形成和最小化立体位阻有助于催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的高选择性和效率。
