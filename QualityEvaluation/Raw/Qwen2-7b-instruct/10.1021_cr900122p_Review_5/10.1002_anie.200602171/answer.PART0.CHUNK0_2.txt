[1] "The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources."
[2] "Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride3 prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
[3] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates (Scheme 1)."
[4] "This system involves a single metal with dual properties and shows that ancillary ligands are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions."
[5] "When propane (540 equiv) is brought into contact with 1a at 150C in a batch reactor, it is converted into mainly ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%)."
[6] "Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion (Table 1 and Figure 1)."
[7] "Firstly, 2,2-dimethylpropane is probably formed by exchange of the neopentyl by a propyl ligand, either directly through σ-bond metathesis or in two steps through CH activation on the neopentylidene unit followed by a decomposition of the penta-coordinated complex through an α-H abstraction to regenerate an alkylidene alkyl/Mo center (1b, R=Et, R=tBu; Scheme 2)."
[8] "Secondly, 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpentane are probably obtained through cross-metathesis of the neopentylidene ligand attached to the Mo center and a propene moiety, which results from β-H transfer on the propyl chain in 1b, followed by metathesis and subsequent similar reverse steps (insertion of the olefin into a metal hydride and exchange of the ligand by successive CH activation on the carbene ligand and α-H abstraction)."
[9] "The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation);18 that is, by the relative position of the substituents: typically substituents in the [1,3]-positions of the metalla-cyclobutane intermediate generate less steric hindrance than in the [1,2]-positions (Scheme 2)."
[10] "Butane is also converted efficiently into its lower and higher homologues (TON=90 in 120 h) and its cross-metathesis products (Table 1 and Table 2), whereas ethane is not."

1. The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported molybdenum complexes involves the transformation of a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues at low temperatures, focusing on the π-bond metathesis between an olefin and a carbene as the key carbon-carbon bond-breaking and forming process. Alkylidene hydrides act as critical intermediates in this process.

2. Ancillary ligands, such as the imido group in catalyst precursor 1a, are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions, contributing to the catalyst's performance.

3. Catalyst 1a converts propane into ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%) under specific conditions. The turnover frequency is constant for 40 hours, then decreases reproducibly.

4. The formation of 2,2-dimethylpropane involves the exchange of a neopentyl ligand for a propyl ligand, either directly through σ-bond metathesis or in two steps involving CH activation and α-H abstraction.

5. 2,2-Dimethylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpentane are obtained through cross-metathesis of the neopentylidene ligand attached to the Mo center and a propene moiety, following a series of reverse steps including insertion of the olefin into a metal hydride and successive CH activation on the carbene ligand and α-H abstraction.

6. The selectivity of initiation products in alkane metathesis can be understood based on the minimization of steric interactions in metalla-cyclobutane intermediates, influenced by the relative positions of substituents.

7. Butane is converted efficiently into lower and higher homologues and cross-metathesis products, while ethane is not, showing distinct reactivity patterns compared to other alkanes.
