[1] "A two-functions-in-one catalyst precursor allows an olefin metathesis catalyst to be turned into an alkane metathesis catalyst."
[2] "Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride3 prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
[3] "This system involves a single metal with dual properties and shows that ancillary ligands are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions."
[4] "The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources."
[5] "When propane (540 equiv) is brought into contact with 1a at 150C in a batch reactor, it is converted into mainly ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%)."
[6] "Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion."
[7] "Note that this well-defined catalyst precursor achieves about the same TON (55) in 120 h as the original tantalum hydride catalyst supported on silica (TON=60) despite the presence of ancillary ligands."
[8] "Firstly, 2,2-dimethylpropane is probably formed by exchange of the neopentyl by a propyl ligand, either directly through σ-bond metathesis or in two steps through CH activation on the neopentylidene unit followed by a decomposition of the penta-coordinated complex through an α-H abstraction to regenerate an alkylidene alkyl/Mo center (1b, R=Et, R=tBu; Scheme 2)."
[9] "Secondly, 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpentane are probably obtained through cross-metathesis of the neopentylidene ligand attached to the Mo center and a propene moiety, which results from β-H transfer on the propyl chain in 1b, followed by metathesis and subsequent similar reverse steps."
[10] "Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."
[11] "Therefore, the propagation step is probably hindered by the olefin-metathesis step, which would require a disfavored [2+2] cycloaddition between a disubstituted carbene and a disubstituted olefin."
