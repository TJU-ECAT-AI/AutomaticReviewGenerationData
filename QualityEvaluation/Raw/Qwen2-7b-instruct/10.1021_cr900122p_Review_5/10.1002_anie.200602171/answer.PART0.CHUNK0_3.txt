[1] "Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride3 prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
[2] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates (Scheme 1)."
[3] "Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion (Table 1 and Figure 1)."
[4] "Note that this well-defined catalyst precursor achieves about the same TON (55) in 120 h as the original tantalum hydride catalyst supported on silica (TON=60) despite the presence of ancillary ligands."
[5] "Firstly, 2,2-dimethylpropane is probably formed by exchange of the neopentyl by a propyl ligand, either directly through σ-bond metathesis or in two steps through CH activation on the neopentylidene unit followed by a decomposition of the penta-coordinated complex through an α-H abstraction to regenerate an alkylidene alkyl/Mo center (1b, R=Et, R=tBu; Scheme 2)."
[6] "Secondly, 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpentane are probably obtained through cross-metathesis of the neopentylidene ligand attached to the Mo center and a propene moiety, which results from β-H transfer on the propyl chain in 1b, followed by metathesis and subsequent similar reverse steps (insertion of the olefin into a metal hydride and exchange of the ligand by successive CH activation on the carbene ligand and α-H abstraction)."

1. The reaction of alkane metathesis was reported in 1997, which uses a silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst prepared via surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) to catalytically transform a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues.
2. Kinetic and structure-reactivity relationship studies showed that π-bond metathesis, involving the interaction of an olefin and a carbene, is the key process for carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation. Alkylidene hydrides are crucial intermediates in this process.
3. The turnover frequency remains constant for 40 hours (approximately 1 TONh1; TON = turnover number), followed by a reproducible decrease in conversion.
4. Despite the presence of ancillary ligands, the well-defined catalyst precursor achieves approximately the same turnover number (55) in 120 hours compared to the original tantalum hydride catalyst supported on silica (TON = 60).
5. 2,2-Dimethylpropane is likely formed through the exchange of the neopentyl by a propyl ligand, either directly through σ-bond metathesis or through two steps involving CH activation on the neopentylidene unit followed by a decomposition of the penta-coordinated complex through α-H abstraction.
6. 2,2-Dimethylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpentane are probably obtained through cross-metathesis of the neopentylidene ligand attached to the Mo center and a propene moiety, which occurs through β-H transfer on the propyl chain, followed by metathesis and subsequent reverse steps involving insertion of the olefin into a metal hydride and exchange of the ligand through successive CH activation on the carbene ligand and α-H abstraction.

1. 在1997年的报告中，使用了通过表面有机金属化学（SOMC）制备的硅支持钽氢化物催化剂，催化烷烃转化为其较低和较高同系物的反应被报道。
2. 动力学和结构反应性关系研究表明，π键裂合（涉及烯烃和卡宾的相互作用）是碳碳键断裂和形成的关键过程。烷基二烯氢化物是这一过程中关键的中间体。
3. 转化率在40小时内保持恒定（大约1 TONh1；TON = 转化次数），随后转化率表现出可重复的减少。
4. 尽管存在辅助配体，但定义明确的催化剂前体在120小时内实现的转化次数（约为55次）与原始硅支持的钽氢化物催化剂（TON = 60次）相同。
5. 2,2-二甲基丙烷可能通过将二环戊基替换为丙基，直接通过σ键裂合或通过两个步骤（涉及在二环戊基二烯单元上的CH激活，随后五配位复合物通过α-H抽象分解以再生烷基二烯/ Mo中心（1b，R=乙基，R=叔丁基；方案2））形成。
6. 2,2-二甲基丁烷和2,2-二甲基戊烷可能通过交叉裂解获得，该过程涉及钼中心连接的二环戊基配体和丙烯基团之间的交叉裂解，这发生在丙基链上的β-H转移后，随后进行裂解和随后类似的逆向步骤（涉及烯烃插入金属氢化物和通过连续的CH激活在卡宾配体和α-H抽象中交换配体）。
