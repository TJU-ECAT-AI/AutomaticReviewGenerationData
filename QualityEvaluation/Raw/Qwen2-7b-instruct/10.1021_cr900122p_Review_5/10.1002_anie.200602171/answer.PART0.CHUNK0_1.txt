[1] "Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride3 prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
[2] "This system involves a single metal with dual properties and shows that ancillary ligands are compatible with alkane metathesis reactions."
[3] "When propane (540 equiv) is brought into contact with 1a at 150C in a batch reactor, it is converted into mainly ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%)."
[4] "Moreover, the turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion (Table 1 and Figure 1)."
[5] "Firstly, 2,2-dimethylpropane is probably formed by exchange of the neopentyl by a propyl ligand, either directly through σ-bond metathesis or in two steps through CH activation on the neopentylidene unit followed by a decomposition of the penta-coordinated complex through an α-H abstraction to regenerate an alkylidene alkyl/Mo center (1b, R=Et, R=tBu; Scheme 2)."
[6] "Note that the alkane cross-metathesis products are obtained in a 3.4:1 ratio, which is very close to the ratio of olefin cross-metathesis products 3,3-dimethylbutene and (E)-4,4-dimethyl-2-pentene, obtained during the metathesis of propene on 1a (that is, 2.7:1), and this is consistent with the proposed elementary steps, and especially with olefin metathesis being the key carboncarbon bond-formation step."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism involves a single metal, molybdenum, with dual properties, enabling it to act as both an olefin metathesis catalyst and an alkane metathesis catalyst. Ancillary ligands, like the imido group, play a crucial role in controlling the reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts.

In the metathesis of propane, the main products are ethane, butane, methane, isobutane, and pentanes, with selectivities of 56.1%, 35.3%, 0.1%, 2.7%, and 5.9%, respectively. The turnover frequency is constant for 40 hours, indicating efficient catalyst performance.

Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, facilitate the transformation of linear alkanes. For instance, 2,2-dimethylpropane is likely formed through the exchange of a neopentyl ligand by a propyl ligand, either directly or through a series of steps involving CH activation and α-H abstraction. The ratio of alkane cross-metathesis products closely matches that of olefin cross-metathesis products, supporting the proposed mechanism where olefin metathesis is the key carbon-carbon bond-forming step.

In conclusion, the silica-supported molybdenum complex catalyzes alkane metathesis efficiently, showing that ancillary ligands can be used effectively, and the selectivity of the products reflects the importance of π-bond metathesis as the primary carbon-carbon bond-breaking and forming step.

烷烃裂合由硅负载钽氢化物催化，涉及单金属（钼）的双功能性质，既能作为烯烃裂合催化剂，也能作为烷烃裂合催化剂。辅助配体，如咪唑基团，在控制催化剂活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。

丙烷裂合的主要产物为乙烷、丁烷、甲烷、异丁烷和戊烷，其选择性分别为56.1%、35.3%、0.1%、2.7%和5.9%。40小时内催化剂的周转频率保持恒定，表明催化剂性能高效。

关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，促进了线性烷烃的转换。例如，2,2-二甲基丙烷可能通过交换二甲基丙基配体为丙基配体形成，这可能直接或通过一系列步骤涉及CH激活和α-H抽象实现。各种烷烃交叉裂合产物的比例与烯烃交叉裂合产物的比例接近，支持提出的机制，其中烯烃裂合是碳-碳键形成的关键步骤。

综上所述，硅负载钼复合物高效催化烷烃裂合，表明辅助配体可以有效使用，并且产物的选择性反映了π-键裂合作为主要碳-碳键断裂和形成步骤的重要性。
