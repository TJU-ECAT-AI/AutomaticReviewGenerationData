The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the process of linear and cyclic alkane transformations, alkenes and metallacyclobutanes serve as significant intermediates. These factors contribute to the high activity and selectivity of the catalysts, which are essential for various alkane conversions.
