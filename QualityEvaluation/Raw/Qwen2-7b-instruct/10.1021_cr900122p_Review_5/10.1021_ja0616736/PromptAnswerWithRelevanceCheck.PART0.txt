The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides encompasses both two-site and one-site schemes, involving the rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds within alkanes through a series of steps including activation, propagation, and termination. In linear alkane transformations, the catalyst enables the exchange of double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms. For cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism involves the formation of metallacyclobutanes as an intermediate step. Key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, are crucial in these reactions.
