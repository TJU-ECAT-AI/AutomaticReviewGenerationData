[1] "The presented results lead to the following conclusions:b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "The high catalytic activity of these catalysts arises from the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides."
[3] "Deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the resistance to coke deposition,which is caused probably by decreasing the surface acidity."
[4] "CO2 enhances the average yield of propene above 848 K and partially suppresses the catalyst deactivation by coke deposition."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes, facilitating linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in the reactions. Selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors including the formation and role of these intermediates. The presence of CO2 notably boosts the yield of propene and mitigates catalyst deactivation through coke deposition above 848 K, thus enhancing the overall catalytic efficiency.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts. CO2 is shown to promote the dehydrogenation of propane above 848 K. This promotion occurs due to the facilitation of desorption of propene by CO2, which suppresses further deep dehydrogenation resulting in coke formation. Additionally, the reverse water-gas shift reaction might also contribute to this promoting effect. The document does not analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides as requested in the question.

该文档讨论了二氧化碳对乙烷在镓氧化物支持的铬氧化物催化剂上脱氢的影响。二氧化碳在848 K以上的温度下促进了乙烷的脱氢。这种促进是由于二氧化碳促进了丙烯的脱附，从而抑制了进一步的深度脱氢导致焦炭形成。此外，逆水煤气变换反应也可能对二氧化碳观察到的促进作用负责。文档没有分析二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制，如问题中所要求的。

[1] "Inert atmosphere, the average conversion of propane gradually increases up to 848 K and then rises insignificantly with the further increase of the reaction temperature."
[2] "In the presence of CO2 the average yield of propene increments in the whole temperature range,while in the absence of CO2 it increases linearly up to 848 K and then declined."
[3] "At higher temperatures the decrease was more significant in the presence of CO2."
[4] "The molar ratio of CO/C3H6 strongly increases with temperature from 0.7 at 773 K to 3.6 at 923 K."
[5] "On the other hand, the molar ratio of H2/C3H6 in the presence of CO2 is lower than that in He, and is below 1.0 at 773873 K."
[6] "Such results suggest that the reverse water-gas shift reaction may proceed simultaneously with dehydrogenation of propane."
[7] "The presented results lead to the following conclusions:b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane."

The document discusses the dehydrogenation of propane using b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts. The study investigates the effects of chromium content and CO2 presence on the dehydrogenation process. Chromium oxide deposition enhances the catalyst's dehydrogenation activity and resistance to coke deposition. CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane above 848 K, increasing the yield of propene and partially suppressing coke deposition. The catalysts' activity and selectivity are attributed to the combined dehydrogenating properties of gallium and chromium oxides.

本文研究了使用b-Ga2O3支持的铬氧化物催化剂对丙烷的脱氢反应。研究探讨了铬含量和CO2存在对脱氢过程的影响。铬氧化物沉积提高了催化剂的脱氢活性和焦炭沉积抵抗力。在高于848 K的温度下，CO2促进了丙烷的脱氢反应，增加了丙烯的产率，并部分抑制了焦炭沉积。催化剂的活性和选择性归因于镓和铬氧化物的联合脱氢性质。

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two primary schemes: two-site and one-site. In the context of this literature, the focus is on the dehydrogenation of propane rather than the metathesis of silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The two-site scheme typically involves the simultaneous activation of two alkane molecules leading to the formation of two alkenes, while the one-site scheme refers to a single active site that facilitates the rearrangement of alkane structures. Key intermediates in these reactions include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity of the reactions is influenced by factors such as the presence of key intermediates and the stability of the catalyst against deactivation through coke formation. CO2 plays a role in enhancing the yield of propene and suppressing the catalyst deactivation by coke deposition above 848 K.

催化机制涉及两种主要方案：双位点和单位点。在此文献中，重点是丙烷的脱氢而不是硅基支持钽氢化物的交联。双位点方案通常涉及同时激活两个烷烃分子产生两个烯烃，而单一位点方案指的是单个活性位点促进烷烃结构的重排。这些反应的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。反应的选择性受到关键中间体的存在和催化剂抗结焦失活稳定性等因素的影响。二氧化碳在848K以上通过提高丙烯的产率并部分抑制催化剂由焦炭沉积导致的失活方面起着重要作用。

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context provided, the focus is on the dehydrogenation of propane over b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts rather than silica-supported tantalum hydrides. However, the mechanisms of alkane metathesis typically involve the formation of alkenes through the breaking of alkane bonds and the subsequent rearrangement or recombination of the fragments to form new alkane structures. The role of key intermediates includes alkenes and potentially metallacyclobutanes, depending on the specific reaction pathway. Reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by factors such as the stability of intermediates, the energy barriers for bond-breaking and bond-forming steps, and the interactions between the catalyst and reactants. The presence of CO2 in the reaction atmosphere contributes to the enhancement of propene yield and suppression of catalyst deactivation by coke deposition, likely through facilitating the desorption of propene and possibly direct reactions with coke particles.

催化作用由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃互变异构的全面机制涉及两种位点和单一位点方案。在此上下文中，关注的是在b-Ga2O3支持的铬氧化物催化剂上的丙烷脱氢，而不是二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物。然而，在此情况下，烷烃互变异构的机制通常涉及通过断裂烷烃键形成烯烃，并随后重新排列或重组碎片以形成新的烷烃结构。关键中间体的作用包括烯烃，可能还包括金属环丁烷，具体取决于特定反应途径。反应选择性和催化剂性能受中间体稳定性、键断开和形成步骤的能量壁垒以及催化剂与反应物之间相互作用等因素的影响。CO2在反应气氛中的存在有助于提高丙烯产量并抑制催化剂由焦炭沉积引起的失活，可能通过促进丙烯的脱附和与焦炭颗粒的直接反应。
