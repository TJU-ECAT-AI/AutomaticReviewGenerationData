<p>It is known that coke formation is accelerated at high temperatures and in the absence of gasification agents like H2O or CO2.</p>
<p>Such effect is not observed in the presence of CO2.</p>
<p>In CO2 atmosphere, the molar ratio of CO/C3H6 strongly increases with temperature from 0.7 at 773 K to 3.6 at 923 K.</p>
<p>The reverse water-gas shift reaction may proceed simultaneously with dehydrogenation of propane.</p>
<p>Both of the reactions are probably responsible for the promoting effect of CO2 observed above 848 K.</p>

The document discusses the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts. CO2 is shown to promote the dehydrogenation of propane above 848 K. This promotion occurs due to the facilitation of desorption of propene by CO2, which suppresses further deep dehydrogenation resulting in coke formation. Additionally, the reverse water-gas shift reaction might also contribute to this promoting effect. The document does not analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides as requested in the question.

该文档讨论了二氧化碳对乙烷在镓氧化物支持的铬氧化物催化剂上脱氢的影响。二氧化碳在848 K以上的温度下促进了乙烷的脱氢。这种促进是由于二氧化碳促进了丙烯的脱附，从而抑制了进一步的深度脱氢导致焦炭形成。此外，逆水煤气变换反应也可能对二氧化碳观察到的促进作用负责。文档没有分析二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制，如问题中所要求的。
