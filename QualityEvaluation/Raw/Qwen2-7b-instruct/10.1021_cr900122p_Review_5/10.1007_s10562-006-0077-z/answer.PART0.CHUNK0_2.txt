[1] "Inert atmosphere, the average conversion of propane gradually increases up to 848 K and then rises insignificantly with the further increase of the reaction temperature."
[2] "In the presence of CO2 the average yield of propene increments in the whole temperature range,while in the absence of CO2 it increases linearly up to 848 K and then declined."
[3] "At higher temperatures the decrease was more significant in the presence of CO2."
[4] "The molar ratio of CO/C3H6 strongly increases with temperature from 0.7 at 773 K to 3.6 at 923 K."
[5] "On the other hand, the molar ratio of H2/C3H6 in the presence of CO2 is lower than that in He, and is below 1.0 at 773873 K."
[6] "Such results suggest that the reverse water-gas shift reaction may proceed simultaneously with dehydrogenation of propane."
[7] "The presented results lead to the following conclusions:b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane."

The document discusses the dehydrogenation of propane using b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts. The study investigates the effects of chromium content and CO2 presence on the dehydrogenation process. Chromium oxide deposition enhances the catalyst's dehydrogenation activity and resistance to coke deposition. CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane above 848 K, increasing the yield of propene and partially suppressing coke deposition. The catalysts' activity and selectivity are attributed to the combined dehydrogenating properties of gallium and chromium oxides.

本文研究了使用b-Ga2O3支持的铬氧化物催化剂对丙烷的脱氢反应。研究探讨了铬含量和CO2存在对脱氢过程的影响。铬氧化物沉积提高了催化剂的脱氢活性和焦炭沉积抵抗力。在高于848 K的温度下，CO2促进了丙烷的脱氢反应，增加了丙烯的产率，并部分抑制了焦炭沉积。催化剂的活性和选择性归因于镓和铬氧化物的联合脱氢性质。
