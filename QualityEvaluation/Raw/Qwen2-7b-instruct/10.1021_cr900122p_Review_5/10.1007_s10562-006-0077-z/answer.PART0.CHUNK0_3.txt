[1] "The presented results lead to the following conclusions:b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "The high catalytic activity of these catalysts arises from the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides."
[3] "Deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the resistance to coke deposition,which is caused probably by decreasing the surface acidity."
[4] "CO2 enhances the average yield of propene above 848 K and partially suppresses the catalyst deactivation by coke deposition."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two primary schemes: two-site and one-site. In the context of this literature, the focus is on the dehydrogenation of propane rather than the metathesis of silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The two-site scheme typically involves the simultaneous activation of two alkane molecules leading to the formation of two alkenes, while the one-site scheme refers to a single active site that facilitates the rearrangement of alkane structures. Key intermediates in these reactions include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity of the reactions is influenced by factors such as the presence of key intermediates and the stability of the catalyst against deactivation through coke formation. CO2 plays a role in enhancing the yield of propene and suppressing the catalyst deactivation by coke deposition above 848 K.

催化机制涉及两种主要方案：双位点和单位点。在此文献中，重点是丙烷的脱氢而不是硅基支持钽氢化物的交联。双位点方案通常涉及同时激活两个烷烃分子产生两个烯烃，而单一位点方案指的是单个活性位点促进烷烃结构的重排。这些反应的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。反应的选择性受到关键中间体的存在和催化剂抗结焦失活稳定性等因素的影响。二氧化碳在848K以上通过提高丙烯的产率并部分抑制催化剂由焦炭沉积导致的失活方面起着重要作用。
