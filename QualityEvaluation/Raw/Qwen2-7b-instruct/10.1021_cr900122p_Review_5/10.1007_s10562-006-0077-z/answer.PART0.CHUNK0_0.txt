[1] "The presented results lead to the following conclusions:b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "The high catalytic activity of these catalysts arises from the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides."
[3] "Deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the resistance to coke deposition,which is caused probably by decreasing the surface acidity."
[4] "CO2 enhances the average yield of propene above 848 K and partially suppresses the catalyst deactivation by coke deposition."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes, facilitating linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in the reactions. Selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors including the formation and role of these intermediates. The presence of CO2 notably boosts the yield of propene and mitigates catalyst deactivation through coke deposition above 848 K, thus enhancing the overall catalytic efficiency.
