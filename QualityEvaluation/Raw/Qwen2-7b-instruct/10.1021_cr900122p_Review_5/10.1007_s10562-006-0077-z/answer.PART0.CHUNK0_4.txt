[1] "The presented results lead to the following conclusions:b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "Deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the resistance to coke deposition,which is caused probably by decreasing the surface acidity."
[3] "CO2 enhances the average yield of propene above 848 K and partially suppresses the catalyst deactivation by coke deposition."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context provided, the focus is on the dehydrogenation of propane over b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts rather than silica-supported tantalum hydrides. However, the mechanisms of alkane metathesis typically involve the formation of alkenes through the breaking of alkane bonds and the subsequent rearrangement or recombination of the fragments to form new alkane structures. The role of key intermediates includes alkenes and potentially metallacyclobutanes, depending on the specific reaction pathway. Reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by factors such as the stability of intermediates, the energy barriers for bond-breaking and bond-forming steps, and the interactions between the catalyst and reactants. The presence of CO2 in the reaction atmosphere contributes to the enhancement of propene yield and suppression of catalyst deactivation by coke deposition, likely through facilitating the desorption of propene and possibly direct reactions with coke particles.

催化作用由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃互变异构的全面机制涉及两种位点和单一位点方案。在此上下文中，关注的是在b-Ga2O3支持的铬氧化物催化剂上的丙烷脱氢，而不是二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物。然而，在此情况下，烷烃互变异构的机制通常涉及通过断裂烷烃键形成烯烃，并随后重新排列或重组碎片以形成新的烷烃结构。关键中间体的作用包括烯烃，可能还包括金属环丁烷，具体取决于特定反应途径。反应选择性和催化剂性能受中间体稳定性、键断开和形成步骤的能量壁垒以及催化剂与反应物之间相互作用等因素的影响。CO2在反应气氛中的存在有助于提高丙烯产量并抑制催化剂由焦炭沉积引起的失活，可能通过促进丙烯的脱附和与焦炭颗粒的直接反应。
