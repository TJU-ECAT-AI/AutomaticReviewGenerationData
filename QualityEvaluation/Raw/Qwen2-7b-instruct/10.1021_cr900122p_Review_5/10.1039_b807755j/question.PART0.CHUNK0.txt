The Al siting in the ZSM-5 zeolite was investigated by 27Al 3Q MAS NMR spectroscopy and QM/MM calculations. It was found that the occupation of the framework T-sites by Al and the concentration of Al in these T-sites are neither random nor controlled by a simple rule. They both depend on the conditions of the zeolite synthesis. At least 12 out of the 24 distinguishable framework T-sites of ZSM-5 are occupied by Al in the set of the investigated zeolite samples.
A partial identification of the Al sites is possible. The calculated 27Al NMR shielding values were converted to 27Al isotropic chemical shifts using the experimental isotropic chemical shift of
60.0 ppm referenced to the aqueous solution of Al(NO3)3 and the corresponding calculated NMR
shielding of 490.0 ppm of a silicon rich (Si/Al 38) chabazite structure zeolite as a secondary internal standard. The observed 27Al isotropic chemical shifts of 50.0 and 54.7 ppm correspond to Al atoms in the T20 and T6 sites, respectively. The pair of measured isotropic chemical shifts of
52.9 and 53.7 ppm can be assigned to the T4, T8 pair. At the low-shielding end, two assignments
are plausible. The smallest deviations between the calculated and observed isotropic chemical shifts are reached for the assignment as follows: T24 (64.8 ppm) is not occupied in the samples and that the observed isotropic chemical shifts 63.6, 62.8, and 60.0 ppm belong to T1, T17, and T7, respectively. It follows then that T-sites T12 (60.8 ppm), T3 (61.7 ppm), and T18 (62.0 ppm) are most likely not occupied by Al in our ZSM-5 samples. If we assume that the calculated isotropic chemical shifts are systematically larger than the observed ones then we can assign the largest observed isotropic chemical shifts of 63.6 and 62.8 ppm to the least shielded T24 and T1 sites, respectively, and 60.0 ppm to T12. Then the sites T3 (61.7 ppm), T18 (62.0 ppm), and T17 (62.5 ppm) would be unoccupied by Al in our ZSM-5 samples. It was further shown that there is no simple linear relationship between the observed 27Al isotropic chemical shifts and the average AlOSi angles.

Introduction Zeolites are crystalline microporous aluminosilicates widely used as molecular sieves and catalysts in industrial chemical processes. In the past thirty years, attention was drawn to ZSM-5 and other silicon-rich zeolites (with Si/Al > 12).
Their protonic forms are currently used as acid catalysts for hydrocarbon transformations in petrochemistry.14 Their transition metal exchanged forms have been discovered as exceptional redox catalysts for nitrogen oxide abatement,5,6 and a selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by nitrous oxide.7 The species assumed to be the active sites in the mentioned reactions, i.e. protons, metal ions and metal-oxo species, are positively charged and compensate the negatively charged aluminosilicate framework. Therefore the Al siting in zeolite frameworks governs the location of the active sites as well as their properties. This is important for both the acid catalyzed hydrocarbon syntheses8 as well as redox reactions.9,10 Thus, Al siting in zeolites is of crucial importance for their catalytic behavior.
A typical feature of many silicon-rich zeolites is a high number of crystallographically distinguishable tetrahedral framework sites (T-sites, T = Si or Al) resulting in a high variability of the Al siting. The very first attempts to shed light on the Al siting in silicon-rich zeolites were based on theore- tical calculations of the energies of Al atoms in the distinguish- able T-sites of these materials.1116 The calculated energy differences between structures with Al in different T-sites were small11,14,15 if the substituted structures were fully relaxed a J.

Larger energy differ- ences repeatedly reported in quantum mechanical cluster studies for ZSM-5 are an artifact of geometrically constraint cluster models with fixed atoms at their boundaries.12,13,16 Diffraction techniques cannot distinguish between Al and Si atoms and thus do not allow direct identification of the Al siting in zeolites. However, Olson et al. studied the Cs+ siting in extraframework positions of ZSM-5 by X-ray diffraction and concluded that the three observed Cs+ sites indicate a nonrandom Al siting.17 27Al solid state NMR spectroscopy was found to be a powerful tool for analyzing the coordination of Al atoms in zeolites,1820 and moreover, recent developments of multiple quantum NMR experiments21 opened new possibilities for studying the structure of AlO4 in zeolite frameworks. Sarv et al.22 applied this approach to ZSM-5 and found three different tetrahedral Al coordinations. Investigations of the effect of Al concentration in the framework on the 27Al (MQ) MAS NMR spectra of ZSM-523 and zeolite Beta24 indicated a non-random Al siting in these matrices.
Key to the identification of the Al siting in high silica zeolites is assigning the observed 27Al resonances to individual framework T-sites. A linear correlation between the 27Al
NMR
isotropic chemical shift,d(Al), and the average TOT angle, y, of the zeolite framework was suggested by Lippmaa et al.25 making reference to the correlation between the 29Si NMR chemical shift and the average SiOSi angle for which a semiempirical quantum mechanical rationalization exists.26 Problems arise from the inability of X-ray crystallography to distinguish between Al and Si atoms. The crystallographic TOT angles used in the correlation corres- ponded to the average values of the AlOSi and SiOSi angles for the same T-sites (only partly occupied by Al) and do not correspond to the local geometry of AlO4 tetrahedra. Note that experimental studies employing this correlation did not succeed in deriving the Al siting from the measured NMR parameters.2224,2729 Therefore another approach relating measured NMR parameters to individual T-sites is needed.
Developments in computational chemistry have allowed calculating reasonable zeolite structures as well as NMR parameters. Employing the GIAO-CPHF method30 Sauer et al.31 calculated the 29Si NMR chemical shifts of all-silica zeolite structures in good agreement with observed chemical shifts (standard deviation of 2.8 ppm). For structures calcu- lated with ab initio parametrized force fields32 the agreement was slightly better than for X-ray structures. For the ortho- rhombic structure of ZSM-5, the calculations reproduced the correct order of all 12 observed 29Si-NMR signals. Bull et al.33,34 used the GIAO method for calculating the 17O isotropic chemical shifts and the electric field gradients of oxygen in siliceous faujasite and ferrierite. For faujasite a complete assignment of the four observed lines was possible,while for ferrierite only a partial assignment could be achieved.
Periodic DFT calculations brought some improvement,35 but did not change the sequence of signals for the different positions.36 Kuc era and Nachtigall37 studied the MCM-58 zeolite by periodic DFT. They found that the 27Al NMR isotropic chemical shift of Al in the framework dramatically varies with the coordination of the counter cation in the cationic site and with the number of water molecules coordi- nated to the counter cation.
In this paper, the distribution of Al atoms over the indivi- dual T-sites of the ZSM-5 framework is examined.38 We found that a bare charged framework represents a realistic model for our calculations of the local geometry of AlO4 tetrahedra in fully hydrated, cation-containing silicon-rich zeolites.38 The predictions of the 27Al isotropic chemical shifts corresponding to Al in the individual T-sites are based on calculations of the local structure around the Al-site using a quantum mechanics molecular mechanics hybrid approach (QM-Pot).3840 The subsequent evaluation of the NMR shielding values uses the GIAO method.30 Both steps are based on the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated Al shieldings were converted to Al isotropic chemical shifts employing the experimental and theoretical NMR parameters obtained for the silicon-rich structure of chabasite.38 The predicted isotropic chemical shifts are compared with the results of 27Al 3Q MAS NMR measurements for a set of ZSM-5 samples synthesized under different conditions. Good agreement between calculated and measured 27Al isotropic chemical shifts is found and a partial assignment of observed resonances to specific crystallographic sites in ZSM-5 is made.
Moreover, our combined computational and experimental study shows that the Al siting in ZSM-5 is not random and can be substantially varied by the conditions of zeolite syntheses.

Experimental methods and samples A set of samples (A-R) of the ZSM-5 zeolite with Si/Al ratios in the range from 14 to 140, with no AlOSiOAl sequences and a low concentration of AlO(SiO)2Al sequences (see section 3.1) was prepared under hydrothermal conditions and autogenous pressure at a temperature of 170 1C with agitation for a period of 710 d. The aluminium, silicon and sodium sources and the structure directing agents (SDA) used for synthesis are given in Table S1 of the ESI.w Na-ZSM-5/B and Na-ZSM-5/N were purchased from Conteca B.V. Sweden, Na-ZSM-5/H was provided by the Institute of Oil and Hydro- carbon Gases, Slovnaft and ZSM-5/K by the Research In- stitute of Inorganic Chemistry Inc., Unipetrol. Na-ZSM-5/M was purchased from Su d-Chemie AG Mu nchen, Germany.
Calcined samples were equilibrated with 0.5 M NaCl to obtain Na-ZSM-5. Ion exchange of zeolites with 0.5 M LiCl was employed to prepare Li-ZSM-5/A and Li-ZSM-5/E from Na-ZSM-5.
Na-ZSM-5/E and Na-ZSM-5/H were ion exchanged with 1.0 M NH4NO3 and subsequent calcination in an oxygen stream resulted in H-ZSM-5/E and H-ZSM-5/H.
An equilibration of the Na-zeolites with 0.05 M Co(NO3)2 at ambient temperature led to the maximum [Co2+(H2O)6]2+ loaded zeolites. The synthesis of silicon rich chabazite (Si/Al 38) is described in detail in ref. 41. XRD, KBr-FTIR and SEM indicated good crystallinity of calcined ion exchanged samples.
Moreover, FTIR characterization of acid sites via adsorption of d3-acetonitrile as well as 29Si MAS NMR indicated a negligible amount of extraframework Al atoms. The chemical composition of the Na-, Li- and H-ZSM-5 zeolites was 1238  Phys. Chem. Chem.

ZrO2 rotors with a rotation speed of 5 kHz in the case of 29Si MAS NMR and 12 kHz for 27Al MAS NMR. All the Na- and Li-samples were dried only at ambient tempera- ture to guarantee their full hydration. H-ZSM-5 zeolites were after deamonization at 450 1C washed on a filter and then dried at ambient temperature. A 29Si MAS NMR high-power decoupling experiment with the p/6 (1.7 ms) excitation pulse and the relaxation delay of 30 s was applied to collect a single pulse spectrum. The chemical shifts were referenced to Q8M8.
The framework aluminium content (Si/AlFR) was estimated from the 29Si NMR data.
To allow a quantitative evolution of the 27Al MAS NMR spectra, high-power decoupling pulse sequences with p/12 (0.7 ms) excitation pulse were applied. The isotropic chemical shifts were referenced to the aqueous solution of Al(NO3)3.
Two-dimensional multi-quantum experiments (2D 3Q) were used to determine the 27Al isotropic chemical shift-diso 27Al.
The 3Q experiments were performed using the two-pulse z-filtered procedure. A p pulse was used for the excitation and a p/3 pulse for the conversion. The pulses were individu- ally optimised for each sample. The 2D contour plots presented in the paper are results of a 2D Fourier transforma- tion followed by a shearing transformation. The isotropic chemical shift was estimated using diso = (17dF1 + 10dF2)/27 where dF1 is the chemical shift in the isotropic and dF2 in the observed dimension. The 27Al 3Q MAS NMR spectroscopy of silicon-rich zeolites is discussed by van Bokhoven24 and the 3Q MAS NMR technique is explained in detail by Alemany.21 The 29Si and 27Al MAS NMR spectra, the F1 and F2 projec- tions and the F1 slices of the 27Al 3Q MAS NMR spectra were simulated using the Origin software (Microcall Inc., USA).

Experimental results
3.1
Al local density and characterization of investigated materials A typical 29Si MAS NMR spectrum of hydrated Na-zeolite (ZSM-5/F) and its simulation is shown in Fig. 1. It is similar to those reported previously for ZSM-5 zeolites.42,43 Thus, the resonances above 110 ppm were assigned to Si(4Si) sites. The bands between 103 and 108 ppm correspond to Si(3Si,1Al) sites, i.e. Si atoms with one neighboring Al atom. The reso- nances with chemical shifts below 100 ppm representing Si(2Si,2Al) sites with two Al neighbors were not observed.
The spectra of other investigated samples were similar, also without any bands corresponding to Si(2Si,2Al) atoms. This is evidence that AlOSiOAl sequences are absent in the investigated samples.
The silicon to framework aluminium ratio (see Table 1) of the samples (Si/AlFR) was estimated using44 Si/AlFR = I/0.25 I1 where I denotes the total intensity of the 29Si NMR signal in the single pulse experiment and I1 denotes the intensity of the NMR line corresponding to the Si(3Si,1Al) atoms. This value of Si/AlFR corresponds well to the Si/Al values obtained from the chemical analysis revealing that extra framework Al atoms are not present in the investigated samples.
Table 1 shows the maximum ion exchange capacity of zeolites for divalent [Co2+(H2O)6]2+ complexes. The exclusive presence of the [Co2+(H2O)6]2+ complexes in our samples was checked by visible spectroscopy (not shown in the figures).

Published on 12 December 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B807755J View Article Online The low ion exchange capacity of the ZSM-5 zeolites for divalent complexes indicates that the concentration of close Al atoms in the framework is low (630% of Al atoms). The details of the determination of the Al local density by Co2+ ions as a probe are discussed elsewhere.45,46
3.2
27Al NMR spectra and Al distribution All the investigated samples exhibit exclusively the signal centered around 55 ppm in the SP (single pulse) 27Al MAS NMR spectrum (not shown in the figures). This signal corres- ponds to the Al atoms with a tetrahedral coordination.25 The resonance around 0 ppm corresponding to octahedrally coordinated Al atoms was not observed in the spectrum con- firming the conclusion of the exclusive presence of Al atoms in the zeolite framework based on the 29Si MAS NMR experiment (see above). The 3Q 27Al MAS NMR method was employed to resolve the individual resonances corresponding to different tetrahedrally coordinated Al atoms. A typical 2D plot of the results for Na-ZSM-5 is shown in Fig. 2 and S1 of the ESIw together with the F1 (along the y axis) and F2 projections as well as with selected F1 and F2 slices. The F1 and F2 projec- tions of all the samples and their simulations are depicted in Fig. 3 and 2 and Fig. S1 of the ESI.w The NMR parameters (Tables 2 and 3)the dF1 and dF2 values and the Al isotropic chemical shifts (diso) were obtained from a simulation of the F1 and F2 projections and F1 and F2 slices. Note that the same Al isotropic chemical shift can correspond to different resonances differing in their dF1 and dF2 NMR parameters (e.g. R-VII and R-VIII). Thus, analysis of these NMR parameters is necessary to identify individual resonances in the spectrum. Comparison of the spectra of the hydrated Na-, Li-ZSM-5/A; Na-, H-ZSM-5/H;and Na-, Li-, H-ZSM-5/E (Table 2) indicates that there is no observable effect of the type of counter cation balancing the framework negative charge on the 27Al NMR parameters of the hydrated ZSM-5 zeolite.
3.3
Al distribution in ZSM-5 At least 12 resonances, designated as IXII, can be identified in the 27Al 3Q MAS NMR spectra of the investigated Na-ZSM-5 zeolites (Table 3). Almost all resonances exhibit a low dispersion of the isotropic chemical shifts (%0.2 ppm) and of the dF1 and dF2 values for the different ZSM-5 samples.
This fact indicates that the accuracy of the estimation of the 27Al NMR parameters is better than 0.2 ppm for the majority of samples. Thus, each of the resonances IV and VIIXII could be assigned to Al in one particular framework T-site.

Note that each of the resonances IXII was found for at least two samples. Moreover, the resonances III, IV, VI, IX, XI, and XII were also observed for the zeolites exchanged with differ- ent counter cations (Li+, H+). Thus, the attribution of the resolved resonances to an experimental artifact can be ruled out. At least two resonances of each sample were also observed for at least one more sample indicating that the change of the NMR parameters is not due to a variation of macroscopic parameters. We conclude that at least 12 framework T-sites are occupied by Al atoms in the set of the investigated ZSM-5 samples.

Quantification of Al distribution in ZSM-5 The details of the single pulse 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the Na-zeolite samples in the tetrahedral region and their simula- tions are given in Fig. 3 and Fig. S2 of the ESI.w These spectra were used to quantify the concentration of the Al atoms in the individual T-sites. The estimated distribution of Al atoms is shown in Fig. 4. Both the siting as well as the relative concentration of Al in the individual T-sites vary significantly.

Published on 12 December 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B807755J View Article Online characterizing the Al atoms and their environments in the ZSM-5 framework can be measured only for samples contain- ing counter cations or H3O+ and water molecules. Due to the large number of possible configurations, isotropic chemical shift calculations including the hydration of zeolite and the solvated counter cation would require extensive sampling over isotropic chemical shifts calculated quantum mechanically for the individual configurations and structures.
To avoid this massive computational problem we look for a simple model of the complex structure of a hydrated zeolite.
We adopt a bare charged framework with a single Al atom in a unit cell to describe the local geometry around the Al nucleus.
This is a realistic model because of the reasons as follows: in completely hydrated zeolites, the fully solvated counter cation is located close to the center of the cavity/channel and does not directly interact with the AlO4 tetrahedra as evidenced by a number of XRD studies of hydrated zeolites.48 This fact is further supported, for example, by the optical spectroscopic studies of Co2+ or Cu2+ ions in hydrated zeolites.49,50 More- over, the cation in hydrated zeolites is rotationally free, as indicated by the sharp and narrow resonances in the 7Li and 133Cs MAS NMR spectra of hydrated Li-ZSM-5/E51 and Cs-MOR,52 respectively. Therefore, the effect of the hydrated counter cation on the local geometry of the AlO4 tetrahedra in hydrated silicon rich zeolites and thus on the 27Al isotropic chemical shift is negligible as shown in Table 2. This observa- tion is in agreement with the result of Sarv et al. who reported a tiny difference 00.2 ppm in the F1 values of the resonances observed with Na- and Ca-ZSM-5.22 Similar observations have been made on calculated 29Si-NMR shifts for mono- silicate species.53 The calculated shifts for hydrated H+ and K+ counterions agree within 0.1 ppm.
The explanation of all these findings is that the shielding depends primarily on the local structure around the magnetic nucleus and that solvent and counterions do not affect the shielding by through space effects. Hence 27Al isotropic chemical shift calculations can be made on models that do not include water molecules and counter ions explicitly.
This assumption, by the way, is also implicit in the angle correlation model25 that has been applied in previous studies.23 Our model goes beyond it in as far as it includes up to five bonds away from the magnetic nucleus instead of two and it calculates the shieldings explicitly instead of relying on a correlation.
We conclude that a bare charged framework with a single Al atom in a unit cell represents a realistic model to describe the Al local geometry and predict the 27Al isotropic chemical shift for individual T-sites in ZSM-5. The final proof that this model is adequate can only come from a favorable agreement of calculated isotropic chemical shifts with observed ones. This is indeed the case as discussed in section 7.3. and exemplified by the close agreement between calculated (14.1) and mea- sured (13.6 ppm) ranges of 27Al isotropic chemical shifts (Table 4) and by the similar shift patterns (Fig. 5).

Computational methods
5.1
Models and optimization of structures The computations are performed for a single Al atom in a unit cell of ZSM-5. A bare zeolite framework model is adopted that includes neither cations nor water molecules and possesses P1 symmetry. Each Al atom bears a formal charge of 1. The starting structure was generated from the X-ray structure of mutinaite,54,55 which is the natural analogue of ZSM-5. First,both the lattice constants and the atomic positions of the all- silica MFI structure were optimized at constant pressure by the GULP program56,57 using interatomic potential functions only. Then the silicon atom in the site of interest was replaced by an aluminium atom and the structure and the lattice constants were further optimized at constant pressure. The optimized structure was subsequently used for defining a cluster around the Al atom for our QM-Pot calculations.39,40 The clusters were embedded into a super cell composed of two unit cells of the zeolite framework and the structure of the entire system was optimized by QMPOT at constant volume.
5.2
Cluster models For all calculations, clusters having the Al atom in the center and including five coordination shells (AlOSiOSiOHlink) were used.31 They were cut out from the corresponding optimized super cells. Due to the presence of silicate rings in the framework of ZSM-5, the created five-shell clusters contained pairs of very close Hlink atoms. Since the close Hlink atoms represented the same Si atom, they were replaced by the corresponding Si(OHlink)2 moiety. This was repeated until the cluster contained no such pairs.

QM-Pot method The QM-Pot method employed39,40 partitions the whole system (S) into two parts. The inner part (I) is treated by quantum mechanics (QM) and the outer part (O) as well as all the interactions between the inner and outer layers are treated by parametrized interatomic potential functions (Pot). The dangling bonds of the inner part are saturated by link hydro- gen atoms. The atoms of the inner part together with the link atoms form the cluster (C). The QM-Pot energy of the whole system is given by EQMPot(S) = EQM(C) + EPot(S)  EPot(C) where EQM(C) is the energy of the cluster at the QM level, EPot(S) is the energy of the entire system at the Pot level and EPot(C) is the energy of the cluster at Pot. The QM-Pot approach is discussed in detail elsewhere.58 The calculations were performed by the QMPOT program40 which utilizes the Turbomole program5963 for the QM part and the GULP program56,57 for the periodic potential function calculations. The pure DFT method employing the BLYP6466 functional and the TZVP basis set of Ahlrichs67 were used for the QM calculations. Shell-model ion-pair potentials68 para- metrized on DFT results for zeolites69 were employed as interatomic potential functions (Pot). The electrostatic energy was evaluated by standard Ewald summation techniques for all cores and shells. A cut-offradius of 10 A was chosen for the summation of short-range interactions.
5.4
Calculation of 27Al isotropic chemical shifts Subsequently to the QM-Pot structure determination, the Gaussian program70 was employed to calculate NMR shield- ing tensors of the atoms of the optimized clusters at the BLYP/ TZVP level using the gauge-independent atomic orbital method (GIAO).30
5.5
Conversion of chemical shieldings into 27Al isotropic chemical shifts A chabazite sample having a Si/Al ratio of 38 was employed to convert the calculated chemical shieldings into isotropic che- mical shifts. A 2D plot of the 27Al 3Q MAS NMR spectrum, F1 and F2 projections and their simulation of the sample are described in Fig. 6. Two resonances are present in the spectrum. The strong one exhibits an isotropic chemical shift at 60.0 ppm (F1 = 60.4 and F2 = 59.3), weak (ca. 25% of the intensity) resonance exhibits an isotropic chemical shift at
59.2 ppm (F1 = 60.0 and F2 = 57.9). The same approach
and the same cluster size as described above were used to calculate the 27Al chemical shielding of chabazite utilizing a model of four chabazite unit cells with one Al/Si substitution (Si/Al 47). The Al/Si substitution breaks down the symmetry of the chabazite framework and one distinguishable T-site of all-silica chabazite splits into three distinguishable T-sites. The QM-Pot relative energies, average TOT angles and 27Al chemical shieldings of Al in the 3 T-sites of chabazite (Si/Al 47) are listed in Table 5. The differences between the distinguish- able T-sites are significantly smaller than those for the ZSM-5 zeolite. The splitting of one T-site into 3 T-sites is reflected in three values of the calculated 27Al chemical shielding, how- ever, two of them have very similar values. This result is in very good agreement with the two observed 27Al NMR resonances (Fig. 6) for the silicon rich chabazite. The 27Al NMR shieldings of 490.0/489.9 and 490.4 ppm relate to the experimental values of 60.0 and 59.2 ppm, respectively, for the 27Al isotropic chemical shift. The relation of the shielding of
490.0 corresponding to the 27Al isotropic chemical shift of
60.0 ppm is used for the conversion of the calculated 27Al
NMR shieldings to 27Al isotropic chemical shifts.
6.
Local AlO4 structures and 27Al NMR shieldings Our QM-Pot calculations of ZSM-5 structures (P1 symmetry) containing one Al atom per unit cell resulted in 24 distinguish- able structures corresponding to Al substitution into the 24 T-sites of monoclinic ZSM-5. The force field relative energies of Al in the 24 T-sites of ZSM-5 are all within 10 kcal mol1 (Table S2 of the ESIw). This is similar to previous studies.11,15 The sites T13 and T5 are most stable, T18 is the least stable site.
Table 6 shows the calculated average TOT angles, the GIAO 27Al NMR shieldings and the corresponding isotropic chemical shifts (calibrated employing the chabazite zeolite, see section 5.5) for the 24 T-sites; for the four individual TOT angles of each site see Table S3 of the ESI.w The calculated AlOSi angles scatter between 124 and 1721, but the average AlOSi angles vary significantly lessfrom 1401 (T24 site) to 1541 (T20 site). The site with the smallest average angle (T24) corresponds to the smallest GIAO-calculated 27Al NMR shield- ing, 485.2 ppm, and the one with the largest average angle (T20 site) to the largest shielding, 499.3 ppm. Note that a higher shielding corresponds to a lower isotropic chemical shift.

Published on 12 December 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B807755J View Article Online Based on comparison between the crystallographic and 27Al NMR data of aluminium rich zeolites, Lippmaa et al.25 suggested a linear correlation between the 27Al NMR isotropic chemical shift d(Al) and the average TOT angle (y) of the zeolite framework. d(Al) = 0.50y + 132 ppm The calculated GIAO 27Al NMR isotropic chemical shifts are plotted against the average AlOSi angles in Fig. 7. The plot shows that the linear correlation does not hold even when the calculated AlOSi angles are used instead of crystallographic TOT angles. Let us select two pairs of sites from Table 6 (see also Fig. 7) to illustrate this point. The average AlOSi angles for T1 and T7 are virtually identical (143.5 and 143.31,respectively). Thus the isotropic chemical shifts d(Al) calcu- lated using linear correlation were essentially the same,whereas the GIAO 27Al NMR isotropic chemical shifts vary significantly (63.7 and 60.0 ppm, respectively). On the con- trary, the T10 and T15 sites differ considerably in their average TOT angles (146.1 and 153.51, respectively) but their GIAO 27Al NMR isotropic chemical shifts differ by 0.1 ppm only (57.7 and 57.6 ppm, respectively). These examples show that there is no simple linear correlation between the 27Al NMR isotropic chemical shift and the corresponding average TOT angle of the AlO4 tetrahedron.
Our conclusion regarding the failure of the linear correla- tion is in agreement with that reached by Kuc era and Nachtigal37 for the MCM-58 zeolite from periodic DFT results. They explained the failure by different effects of the Na+ counter cation and its hydration degree on the geometry of the four distinguishable T-sites. On the contrary, our results clearly indicate that the relationship between the 27Al NMR isotropic chemical shift and the local geometry of AlO4 is more complex and does not depend only on the average AlOSi angles.

Discussion
7.1
Al siting in ZSM-5 As detailed in the Results section, the observed resonances for all ZSM-5 samples correspond to Al located in at least 12 different tetrahedral sites of the zeolite framework. Two new resonances were identified compared to our preliminary results reported in ref. 38 This can be explained by a significantly larger set of ZSM-5 samples used. The local coordination of Al and its isotropic chemical shift could be affected by the atom type (Si or Al) of the second neighboring T-sites of the Al atom. Thus, the assignment of several observed Al resonances to one framework T-site cannot be excluded a priori. The Si/Al ratios of the ZSM-5 samples considered are in the 14140 interval. Our 29Si NMR measurements show that there are no AlOSiOAl pairs, which allows us to rule out the effect of an Al atom as a next-nearest neighbor. There is also a low population of close Al atoms (AlO(SiO)2Al sequences) in the samples as our cobalt(II) exchange experiments indicate.
Moreover, no correlation between the presence of the close Al atoms and the observed 27Al resonances was found. Thus the 12 observed resonances correspond to Al atoms in 12 distin- guishable framework T-sites indicating that at least half of the 24 distinguishable T-sites predicted by our QM-Pot calcula- tions are occupied in the set of the investigated ZSM-5 samples.
A previous study,23 in which only two resonances have been resolved, came to a different conclusion. The authors em- ployed the empirical isotropic chemical shiftaverage TOT angle correlation25 to predict 27Al NMR isotropic chemical shifts from the (orthorhombic) XRD structure of a ZSM-5 sample with an Si/Al ratio of 86. The calculated isotropic chemical shifts for the 12 T-sites varied over a range of
5.1 ppm only. Furthermore, all the F1 and F2 parameters

a The 27Al NMR isotropic chemical shifts were obtained by conver- sion of the BLYP GIAO shieldings using the calculated and measured shielding/shift values of 490.0 and 60.0 ppm, respectively, for the chabazite sample (Si/Al 38), see section 5.4.

Published on 12 December 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B807755J View Article Online calculated for the 12 T-sites fell into the observed 3Q spectrum.23 The present calculations show that this is an artifact due to the use of the bond angles from the X-ray structure. These are essentially SiOSi bond angles with only small contributions of SiOAl bond angles because of the low Al content.
The 12 resonances identified in the spectra of Na-ZSM-5 samples represent a significant progress compared to previous studies.22,23 Sarv et al.22 could report only three Al resonances,which is due to the fact that they examined just one ZSM-5 sample. Also in the present study there are only between three and five T-sites occupied by Al in a given ZSM-5 sample, but there are 18 different samples. Han et al.23 report only two resonances. They investigated a set of samples, all prepared by one procedure and differing only in the framework Al con- centration. In addition, the structure-directing agent was not removed from their samples.
Note that the isotropic chemical shifts reported by Sarv22 (54.5, 57.1 and 59.4 ppm) are close to the resonances IV, VI and IX which we find at 54.6, 56.4 and 58.9 ppm, but a safe assignment cannot be made, for the sample investigated by Sarv et al.22 was not examined for the presence of AlO(SiO)2Al sequences which can affect the Al isotropic chemical shift.
7.2
Al distribution over T-sites of the ZSM-5 framework The results shown in Table 3 and Fig. 4 clearly indicate a large variability in both sites occupied by Al atoms and the con- centration of the Al atoms in these sites for the ZSM-5 samples studied. Even samples with similar framework aluminium concentration exhibit very different Al sitings as well as Al concentrations in the individual occupied T-sites. This fact clearly rules out that the Al siting in the zeolite framework is random or is controlled by thermodynamic stability. It rather shows that the conditions of the synthesis are responsible for the Al siting in the framework. A similar conclusion was reached based on the presence of AlO(SiO)1,2Al sequen- cies and isolated Al atoms (AlO(SiO)n>2Al) in ZSM-5 zeolites.45,46,71 Corma et al. discussed the role of the structure directing agents72,73 or fluorine anions74 on the Al siting in zeolites.
The observed non-random Al siting in ZSM-5 is in good agreement with the results of the high-resolution 27Al NMR experiments not only for ZSM-5,22,23 but also for the zeolite Beta.75 This shows that the dependence of the Al siting on the synthesis conditions may be a general feature of silicon-rich zeolites.
Our results summarized in Fig. 4 point to a complex relationship between the conditions of the zeolite syntheses and the Al siting, but one observation regarding the Al distribution is made. The site corresponding to R-VI is significantly more often occupied in the investigated samples than the other ones. However, the high occupation is likely caused by the fact that this resonance represents several T-sites having close NMR parameters as Fig. 5 shows.
Fig. 8 shows the effect of Si/Al on the number of T-sites occupied by Al atoms. Clearly, there is no effect of the framework Al content on the number of occupied T-sites.
From three to five T-sites are occupied by Al in the whole concentration range (Si/Al 14140). This conclusion is coun- terintuitive and indicates that the conditions and mechanisms of the zeolite synthesis are crucial for the Al distribution in the zeolite framework.
7.3
Assignment of observed resonances to T-sites Fig. 5 compares the calculated and measured 27Al isotropic chemical shifts. The values for the different T-sites extend over the ranges of 14.1 and 13.6 ppm, respectively. In addition, the patterns of the predicted and observed isotropic chemical shifts show similarities. Based on similar spacings and least deviations between calculated and observed isotropic chemical shifts a partial assignment of observed resonances to crystallo- graphic sites in ZSM-5 is possible (Table 4): Resonance I (hereafter R-I) corresponds to T20 and R-IV to T6. The pair R-II, R-III can be assigned to the T4, T8 pair. At the low- shielding end, two assignments are plausible. The smallest deviations between the calculated and observed isotropic chemical shifts are reached if it is assumed that T24 (64.8 ppm) is not occupied in the samples and that R-XII belongs to T1, R-XI to T17 and R-X to T7. The isotropic chemical shift deviations are all between +0.7 and 0.3 ppm and the calculated range is 13.0 ppm, 0.6 ppm smaller than the I to XII range of observed resonances (13.6 ppm). It follows then that T-sites T12 (60.8), T3 (61.7), and T18 (62.0) are most likely not occupied by Al in our ZSM-5 samples. To which of the remaining 13 T-sites Resonances V to IX belong remains open, see Fig. 5. If we assume that the calculated isotropic chemical shifts are systematically larger than the observed ones by 0.71.3 ppm (see Fig. 5 and Table 3) due to a shift of the secondary standard we can assign R-XII and R-XI with the largest isotropic chemical shifts to the least shielded T24 and T1 sites, respectively, and R-X to T12. Then the sites T3 (61.7), T18 (62.0), and T17 (62.5) would be unoccupied by Al in our ZSM-5 samples. This second assignment leads to deviations between +1.3 and 0.3 ppm and the calculated isotropic chemical shift range (14.1 ppm) would be 0.5 ppm larger than the observed one.
These results represent a significant progress in interpreting 27Al MAS NMR spectra of zeolites and the first partially successful analysis of the Al siting in a framework of a Fig. 8 Number of T-sites occupied by Al atoms in the ZSM-5 samples plotted against their Si/Al ratio.

These achievements clearly demonstrate the power of the high resolution NMR experiment combined with DFT (QM-Pot) calculations and also support the pure framework model adopted in the calculations. The chosen experimental approach of controlling the Al siting in silicon- rich zeolites by varying the synthesis conditions can be employed to investigate the effect of the Al siting on the physicochemical properties of zeolite catalysts. This might lead to a better design of acidic and redox catalysts with a controlled Al siting and thus tuned properties of the active sites.

Conclusions In this paper, we have demonstrated that a combined experi- mental (27Al 3Q MAS NMR) and theoretical (QM-Pot employing the bare framework model) approach represents a powerful tool for the determination of the local geometry of framework AlO4 tetrahedra, the prediction of 27Al isotropic chemical shifts in hydrated zeolites, and the identification of Al siting in the framework of silicon-rich zeolites.
Experimental evidence is provided for the occupation of at least 12 out of 24 distinguishable framework T-sites by Al atoms in silicon-rich ZSM-5. The observed 27Al isotropic chemical shifts of 50.0 and 54.7 correspond to Al atoms in the T20 and T6 sites, respectively. The pair of resonances at
52.9 and 53.7 ppm corresponds to the pair of the T8 and T4
sites. At the low-shielding end, two assignments are plausible.
The smallest deviations between the calculated and observed isotropic chemical shifts are reached if it is assumed that T24 (64.8 ppm) is not occupied in the samples and that R-XII belongs to T1, R-XI to T17 and R-X to T7. It follows then that T-sites T12 (60.8), T3 (61.7), and T18 (62.0) are most likely not occupied by Al in our ZSM-5 samples. If we assume that the calculated isotropic chemical shifts are systematically larger than the observed ones then we can assign R-XII and R-XI with the largest isotropic chemical shifts to the least shielded T24 and T1 sites, respectively, and R-X to T12. Then the sites T3 (61.7), T18 (62.0), and T17 (62.5) would be unoccupied by Al in our ZSM-5 samples. The assignment of the remaining three resonances remains ambiguous. The conclusion is reached that the Al distribution over framework T-sites is neither random nor controlled by a simple rule, but depends on the conditions of zeolite synthesis.
Furthermore, although there is a trend for smaller 27Al isotropic chemical shifts with increasing average AlOSi bond angles, we have shown that the correlation is not good enough for assignment purposes. Therefore, the local geo- metry of framework AlO4 tetrahedra cannot be inferred from experimental isotropic chemical shifts but can only be obtained from theoretical calculations.
