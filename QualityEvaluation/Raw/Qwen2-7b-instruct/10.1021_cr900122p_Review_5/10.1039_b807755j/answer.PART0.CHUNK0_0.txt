[1] "The Al siting in the ZSM-5 zeolite was investigated by 27Al 3Q MAS NMR spectroscopy and QM/MM calculations. It was found that the occupation of the framework T-sites by Al and the concentration of Al in these T-sites are neither random nor controlled by a simple rule. They both depend on the conditions of the zeolite synthesis."
[2] "At least 12 out of the 24 distinguishable framework T-sites of ZSM-5 are occupied by Al in the set of the investigated zeolite samples."
[3] "The pair of measured isotropic chemical shifts of 52.9 and 53.7 ppm can be assigned to the T4, T8 pair."
[4] "The smallest deviations between the calculated and observed isotropic chemical shifts are reached for the assignment as follows: T24 (64.8 ppm) is not occupied in the samples and that the observed isotropic chemical shifts 63.6, 62.8, and 60.0 ppm belong to T1, T17, and T7, respectively."
[5] "It was further shown that there is no simple linear relationship between the observed 27Al isotropic chemical shifts and the average AlOSi angles."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The catalyst facilitates the rearrangement of alkane molecules, converting them into alkenes and potentially metallacyclobutanes. Linear alkane transformations typically involve the breaking of C-C sigma bonds and the formation of new C-C sigma bonds, while cyclic alkane transformations involve similar processes but with the creation of ring structures. Key intermediates include alkenes, which are produced when alkane molecules undergo decarbonylation, and metallacyclobutanes, which are formed through the insertion of a metal atom into the alkene molecule, creating a cyclobutane structure with a metal center. The role of these intermediates is central to the catalytic cycle, as they enable the efficient transfer of alkyl groups between the alkane molecules. Reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by factors such as the presence of co-catalysts, the surface area and acidity of the silica support, and the electronic properties of the metal center. The specific conditions under which the metathesis occurs, such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of solvents, also play critical roles in determining the outcome of the reaction.

The local geometry of framework AlO4 tetrahedra in the ZSM-5 zeolite cannot be accurately inferred solely from experimental isotropic chemical shifts. The correlation between isotropic chemical shifts and average AlOSi bond angles is not strong enough for assignment purposes. Therefore, theoretical calculations are necessary to understand the precise local geometry of these tetrahedra.

催化硅负载钽氢的烷烃裂解全面机制涉及双位点和单位点方案。催化剂促进烷烃分子的重排，将其转化为烯烃并可能形成金属环状四氢化合物。线性烷烃转化通常涉及C-C共价键的断裂和新C-C共价键的形成，而环烷烃转化涉及类似过程但会产生环结构。关键中间体包括烯烃，它们通过脱羰化产生，以及通过将金属原子插入烯烃分子中形成的环状四氢化合物，从而在金属中心形成环状四氢化合物。这些中间体在催化循环中起着核心作用，因为它们使烷烃分子之间的烷基团转移变得有效。反应选择性和催化剂性能受到共催化剂的存在、支持硅的比表面积和酸性以及金属中心的电子性质等因素的影响。特定条件下进行的裂解，如温度、压力和溶剂的存在，也对反应结果有决定性影响。

ZSM-5沸石笼框架中AlO4四面体局部几何结构不能仅从实验的各向异性化学位移推断。平均AlOSi键角与各向异性化学位移之间的相关性不够强，因此无法用于赋值目的。因此，理论上需要计算来理解这些四面体的确切局部几何结构。
