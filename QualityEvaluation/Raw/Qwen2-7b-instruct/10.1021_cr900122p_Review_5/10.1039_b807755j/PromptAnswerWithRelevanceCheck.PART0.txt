The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The catalyst facilitates the rearrangement of alkane molecules, converting them into alkenes and potentially metallacyclobutanes. Linear alkane transformations typically involve the breaking of C-C sigma bonds and the formation of new C-C sigma bonds, while cyclic alkane transformations involve similar processes but with the creation of ring structures. Key intermediates include alkenes, which are produced when alkane molecules undergo decarbonylation, and metallacyclobutanes, which are formed through the insertion of a metal atom into the alkene molecule, creating a cyclobutane structure with a metal center. The role of these intermediates is central to the catalytic cycle, as they enable the efficient transfer of alkyl groups between the alkane molecules. Reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by factors such as the presence of co-catalysts, the surface area and acidity of the silica support, and the electronic properties of the metal center. The specific conditions under which the metathesis occurs, such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of solvents, also play critical roles in determining the outcome of the reaction.

The local geometry of framework AlO4 tetrahedra in the ZSM-5 zeolite cannot be accurately inferred solely from experimental isotropic chemical shifts. The correlation between isotropic chemical shifts and average AlOSi bond angles is not strong enough for assignment purposes. Therefore, theoretical calculations are necessary to understand the precise local geometry of these tetrahedra.

催化硅负载钽氢的烷烃裂解全面机制涉及双位点和单位点方案。催化剂促进烷烃分子的重排，将其转化为烯烃并可能形成金属环状四氢化合物。线性烷烃转化通常涉及C-C共价键的断裂和新C-C共价键的形成，而环烷烃转化涉及类似过程但会产生环结构。关键中间体包括烯烃，它们通过脱羰化产生，以及通过将金属原子插入烯烃分子中形成的环状四氢化合物，从而在金属中心形成环状四氢化合物。这些中间体在催化循环中起着核心作用，因为它们使烷烃分子之间的烷基团转移变得有效。反应选择性和催化剂性能受到共催化剂的存在、支持硅的比表面积和酸性以及金属中心的电子性质等因素的影响。特定条件下进行的裂解，如温度、压力和溶剂的存在，也对反应结果有决定性影响。

ZSM-5沸石笼框架中AlO4四面体局部几何结构不能仅从实验的各向异性化学位移推断。平均AlOSi键角与各向异性化学位移之间的相关性不够强，因此无法用于赋值目的。因此，理论上需要计算来理解这些四面体的确切局部几何结构。

Aluminium siting in the ZSM-5 framework by combination of high resolution 27Al NMR and DFT/MM calculations.
At least 12 out of the 24 distinguishable framework T-sites of ZSM-5 are occupied by Al in the set of the investigated zeolite samples.
A partial identification of the Al sites is possible. The calculated 27Al NMR shielding values were converted to 27Al isotropic chemical shifts using the experimental isotropic chemical shift of 60.0 ppm referenced to the aqueous solution of Al(NO3)3 and the corresponding calculated NMR shielding of 490.0 ppm of a silicon rich (Si/Al 38) chabazite structure zeolite as a secondary internal standard.
The Al siting in the zeolite framework governs the location of the active sites as well as their properties. This is important for both the acid catalyzed hydrocarbon syntheses as well as redox reactions.
The distribution of Al atoms over the indivi- dual T-sites of the ZSM-5 framework is examined. We found that a bare charged framework represents a realistic model for our calculations of the local geometry of AlO4 tetrahedra in fully hydrated, cation-containing silicon-rich zeolites.
Good agreement between calculated and measured 27Al isotropic chemical shifts is found and a partial assignment of observed resonances to specific crystallographic sites in ZSM-5 is made.
The 12 resonances identified in the spectra of Na-ZSM-5 samples represent a significant progress compared to previous studies.
The results shown in Table 3 and Fig. 4 clearly indicate a large variability in both sites occupied by Al atoms and the concentration of the Al atoms in these sites for the ZSM-5 samples studied.
Resonance I (hereafter R-I) corresponds to T20 and R-IV to T6. The pair R-II, R-III can be assigned to the T4, T8 pair. At the low-shielding end, two assignments are plausible.
Based on similar spacings and least deviations between calculated and observed isotropic chemical shifts a partial assignment of observed resonances to crystallo- graphic sites in ZSM-5 is possible.

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes of linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The mechanism typically proceeds through the following steps:

1. The catalyst, silica-supported tantalum hydrides, facilitates the formation of an active site for the metathesis reaction. This is usually a two-site mechanism, where two alkyl groups from two different alkane molecules are transferred to form two new alkyl groups, creating two new alkane molecules.

2. In the case of linear alkane transformations, the mechanism involves the formation of an intermediate alkene at the active site. The catalyst then facilitates the rearrangement of the alkene to form the desired alkane products. This process is highly influenced by the catalyst's ability to stabilize the intermediate alkene, which is usually achieved through the formation of metallacyclobutanes.

3. For cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism is more complex, involving the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate undergoes ring-opening and re-closing reactions, leading to the formation of the desired cyclic alkane products. The catalyst plays a critical role in stabilizing the metallacyclobutane intermediate and facilitating the ring-opening and re-closing reactions.

4. The selectivity of the alkane metathesis reaction is influenced by factors such as the catalyst's structure, the nature of the alkane substrates, and the reaction conditions. Catalyst performance is enhanced by optimizing these factors to ensure efficient and selective alkane conversions.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation and stabilization of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, facilitated by the active site of the catalyst. The reaction proceeds through the transfer of alkyl groups, leading to the formation of new alkane products. The catalyst's structure and reaction conditions play crucial roles in determining the selectivity and efficiency of the alkane conversions.

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes. In this context, the silica-supported tantalum hydrides act as catalysts that facilitate the rearrangement of alkane chains through the transfer of double bonds. Linear alkane transformations involve the rearrangement of alkane chains into longer or shorter chains, while cyclic alkane transformations result in the formation of cycloalkanes from linear alkanes.

Key intermediates in these processes include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Alkenes are formed during the initial stages of the metathesis reaction, serving as precursors for the formation of longer or shorter alkane chains. Metallacyclobutanes, on the other hand, play a crucial role in the formation of cyclic alkane products. The catalytic activity of the silica-supported tantalum hydrides lies in their ability to stabilize and activate these intermediates, facilitating the rearrangement of double bonds.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the type of alkane, the catalyst loading, the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, and solvent), and the nature of the catalyst itself. Catalyst performance can be optimized by tuning these parameters to achieve desired product distributions and reaction rates.

In the context of the document, the occupation of framework T-sites by aluminum in ZSM-5 zeolite is neither random nor controlled by a simple rule. This finding implies that the conditions of the synthesis process significantly impact the Al siting in the zeolite framework. The document also discusses the limitations of a linear correlation between the 27Al isotropic chemical shifts and the average AlOSi angles in predicting the local geometry of AlO4 tetrahedra. This suggests that while the geometry can influence chemical shifts, additional factors contribute to the complexity of Al siting in zeolites.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the strategic activation and rearrangement of alkane chains facilitated by the catalyst. The role of intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes is central to this process, with the catalyst's performance influenced by various factors including synthesis conditions and the specific nature of the catalyst.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃金属化机制涉及理解两种位点方案和单个位点方案。在这个上下文中，二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物作为催化剂，促进烷烃链的重排通过双键转移。线性烷烃转化涉及将烷烃链重排成长或短链，而环烷烃转化导致从线性烷烃形成环烷烃。

这些过程中的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。在初始阶段形成的烯烃是重排烷烃链生成更长或更短链的前体。另一方面，金属环丁烷在形成环烷烃产物中扮演着重要角色。二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的催化活性在于它们能够稳定和激活这些中间体，从而促进双键的重排。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能受到烷烃类型、催化剂负载、反应条件（温度、压力和溶剂）以及催化剂本身的性质的影响。可以通过调整这些参数来优化催化剂性能，以实现所需的产品分布和反应速率。

根据文档，ZSM-5沸石中的铝占据框架T位点并非随机，也不是由简单规则控制。这一发现表明合成过程的条件显著影响了沸石框架中的铝定位。文档还讨论了27Al等向化学位移与平均AlOSi角度之间的线性相关性的局限性，用于预测AlO4四面体的局部几何结构。这表明虽然几何形状可以影响化学位移，但还有其他因素导致了沸石中铝定位的复杂性。

简而言之，由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃金属化机制涉及通过催化剂策略激活并重新排列烷烃链的过程。中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷在这一过程中起着核心作用，催化剂的性能受到包括合成条件和催化剂本身性质在内的多种因素的影响。

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. The literature focuses on the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkane structures. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in these processes. The selectivity and performance of catalysts in alkane conversions are influenced by factors including the formation and role of these intermediates. The literature suggests that while there is a trend for smaller 27Al isotropic chemical shifts with increasing average AlOSi bond angles, the correlation is insufficient for assignment purposes. Therefore, the local geometry of framework AlO4 tetrahedra cannot be directly inferred from experimental isotropic chemical shifts but must be obtained through theoretical calculations.
