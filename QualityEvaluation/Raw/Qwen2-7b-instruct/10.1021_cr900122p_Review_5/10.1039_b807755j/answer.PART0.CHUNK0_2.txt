[1] "In this paper, we have demonstrated that a combined experi- mental (27Al 3Q MAS NMR) and theoretical (QM-Pot employing the bare framework model) approach represents a powerful tool for the determination of the local geometry of framework AlO4 tetrahedra, the prediction of 27Al isotropic chemical shifts in hydrated zeolites, and the identification of Al siting in the framework of silicon-rich zeolites."
[2] "The Al distribution over framework T-sites is neither random nor controlled by a simple rule, but depends on the conditions of zeolite synthesis."
[3] "The observed 27Al isotropic chemical shifts of 50.0 and 54.7 correspond to Al atoms in the T20 and T6 sites, respectively. The pair of resonances at 
52.9 and 53.7 ppm corresponds to the pair of the T8 and T4 
sites."
[4] "At the low-shielding end, two assignments are plausible. The smallest deviations between the calculated and observed isotropic chemical shifts are reached if it is assumed that T24 (64.8 ppm) is not occupied in the samples and that R-XII belongs to T1, R-XI to T17 and R-X to T7."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes of linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The mechanism typically proceeds through the following steps:

1. The catalyst, silica-supported tantalum hydrides, facilitates the formation of an active site for the metathesis reaction. This is usually a two-site mechanism, where two alkyl groups from two different alkane molecules are transferred to form two new alkyl groups, creating two new alkane molecules.

2. In the case of linear alkane transformations, the mechanism involves the formation of an intermediate alkene at the active site. The catalyst then facilitates the rearrangement of the alkene to form the desired alkane products. This process is highly influenced by the catalyst's ability to stabilize the intermediate alkene, which is usually achieved through the formation of metallacyclobutanes.

3. For cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism is more complex, involving the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate undergoes ring-opening and re-closing reactions, leading to the formation of the desired cyclic alkane products. The catalyst plays a critical role in stabilizing the metallacyclobutane intermediate and facilitating the ring-opening and re-closing reactions.

4. The selectivity of the alkane metathesis reaction is influenced by factors such as the catalyst's structure, the nature of the alkane substrates, and the reaction conditions. Catalyst performance is enhanced by optimizing these factors to ensure efficient and selective alkane conversions.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation and stabilization of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, facilitated by the active site of the catalyst. The reaction proceeds through the transfer of alkyl groups, leading to the formation of new alkane products. The catalyst's structure and reaction conditions play crucial roles in determining the selectivity and efficiency of the alkane conversions.
