[1] "The Al siting in the ZSM-5 zeolite was investigated by 27Al 3Q MAS NMR spectroscopy and QM/MM calculations. It was found that the occupation of the framework T-sites by Al and the concentration of Al in these T-sites are neither random nor controlled by a simple rule. They both depend on the conditions of the zeolite synthesis."
[2] "At least 12 out of the 24 distinguishable framework T-sites of ZSM-5 are occupied by Al in the set of the investigated zeolite samples."
[3] "The pair of measured isotropic chemical shifts of 52.9 and 53.7 ppm can be assigned to the T4, T8 pair."
[4] "The smallest deviations between the calculated and observed isotropic chemical shifts are reached for the assignment as follows: T24 (64.8 ppm) is not occupied in the samples and that the observed isotropic chemical shifts 63.6, 62.8, and 60.0 ppm belong to T1, T17, and T7, respectively."
[5] "The conclusion is reached that the Al distribution over framework T-sites is neither random nor controlled by a simple rule, but depends on the conditions of zeolite synthesis."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. The literature focuses on the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkane structures. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in these processes. The selectivity and performance of catalysts in alkane conversions are influenced by factors including the formation and role of these intermediates. The literature suggests that while there is a trend for smaller 27Al isotropic chemical shifts with increasing average AlOSi bond angles, the correlation is insufficient for assignment purposes. Therefore, the local geometry of framework AlO4 tetrahedra cannot be directly inferred from experimental isotropic chemical shifts but must be obtained through theoretical calculations.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制涉及理解双位点和单位点方案。文献集中在线性和环状烷烃结构的转化过程上。关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，对这些过程起着至关重要的作用。催化剂在烷烃转换中的选择性和性能受因素的影响，包括这些中间体的形成及其作用。文献表明，虽然平均AlOSi键角增大时27Al等向化学位移会减小的趋势是存在的，但这种相关性不足以用于分配目的。因此，框架AlO4四面体的局部几何形状不能直接从实验的等向化学位移中推断出来，而必须通过理论计算获得。
