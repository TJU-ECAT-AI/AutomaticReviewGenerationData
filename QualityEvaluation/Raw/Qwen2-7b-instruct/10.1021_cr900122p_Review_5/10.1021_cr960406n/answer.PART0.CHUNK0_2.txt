<p>The possibility of making bifunctional Pt/PLS catalysts has been illustrated by using test reactions such as the hydroisomerization and hydrocracking of n-alkanes.</p>
<p>In the case of real refinery feeds, clays pillared with Al, Zr, or Ti have been used as the acid component of the hydrotreating catalyst formulation.</p>
<p>The other field of acid-catalyzed reactions where the porosity of the PLS together with their acid properties can be of use, is in the preparation of chemicals and fine chemicals.</p>
<p>Acidic clays by themselves or pillared with Al, Zr, and Cr have been used to catalyze organic reactions requiring Lewis and Brnsted acids such as AlCl3, HF, or H2SO4.</p>
<p>When gas oil was cracked, it was soon recognized that layered silicates produced more coke than conventional FCC catalysts but their behavior was in fact still better than that of amorphous silica-alumina.</p>
<p>For instance, when C6 and C8 alkyl chain surfactants were used, MCM-41 was not formed, in agreement with the fact that the solubilities of these short chain quaternary ammonium are high, and aggregated structures are not necessary to minimize hydrophobic interactions.</p>
<p>However, considering that the liquid crystal structures formed in surfactant solutions are highly sensitive to the overall characteristics of the solution, the authors also account for the possibility that the addition of the silicate results in the ordering of the subsequent silicate-encaged surfactant micelles.</p>
<p>Stucky and coworkers have developed a model that makes use of the cooperative organization of inorganic and organic molecular species into three dimensionally structured arrays.</p>
<p>These authors have presented four pathways to the synthesis of mesostructured surfactantinorganic biphasic arrays.</p>
<p>Following this mechanism, the criteria of charge density matching at the surfactant inorganic interfaces governs the assembly process, and consequently, the final type of structure generated.</p>
<p>In cases where the degree of condensation of the oligomeric ions which form the walls is low, the removal of the template leads to the collapse of the ordered mesostructure.</p>
<p>Therefore, we think that in this case the mesostructure should be written as IX-S+, giving a neutral structure instead of the positively charged one previously proposed.</p>
<p>Again from the point of view of catalytic application, it would be of interest not only to have shorter length pores but, if possible, to have them communicated through a tridimensional pore network, instead of the unidirectional pore system of the MCM-41.</p>
<p>This material was synthesized by an electrostatic templating route using sodium silicate (CTMACl) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt.</p>
<p>In this way, pure siliceous MCM-41 with different pore diameters were hydrothermally synthesized with the following molar composition:</p>
