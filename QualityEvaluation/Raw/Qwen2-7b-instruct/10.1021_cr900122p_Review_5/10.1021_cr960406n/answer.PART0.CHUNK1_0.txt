[1] "The activity of Ti-MCM-41 to epoxidize small linear olefins with H2O2 was lower than when using Ti-silicalite and Ti-β-zeolite catalysts, indicating that the intrinsic activity of Ti in the MCM-41 was lower than in ZSM-5 and β-zeolites, at least under the reaction conditions used."
[2] "However the advantages of Ti-MCM-41 as epoxidation catalyst was in its ability to oxidize large molecules which cannot diffuse in the pores of microporous materials, as well as to use organic hydroperoxides as oxidants."
[3] "In that work a MCM-41 structure was prepared which contained in the walls both Ti and Al sites. In essence the catalyst now has both the TiIV oxidation sites, in addition the H+ associated to the AlIV as acid sites, which enables us to carry out in one pot and using tert-butyl hydroperoxide, the multistep oxidation of linalool to cyclic furan and pyran hydroxy ethers with 100% selectivity and in ratio of 0.89."

1. The intrinsic activity of titanium in MCM-41 is lower than in ZSM-5 and β-zeolites when epoxidizing small linear olefins with H2O2. However, Ti-MCM-41 offers advantages in oxidizing large molecules and utilizing organic hydroperoxides as oxidants.
2. The catalyst that combines titanium and aluminum in the MCM-41 structure can perform multiple oxidation steps in one pot, using tert-butyl hydroperoxide to convert linalool to cyclic furan and pyran hydroxy ethers with 100% selectivity and a specific ratio of 0.89.

1. 当使用H2O2对小线性烯烃进行环氧化时，钛在MCM-41中的内在活性低于ZSM-5和β沸石。然而，Ti-MCM-41在氧化大分子以及利用有机过氧化氢作为氧化剂方面具有优势。
2. 结合有钛和铝的MCM-41结构的催化剂可以在一个锅中完成多步氧化过程，使用叔丁基过氧化氢将linalool转化为环呋喃和环吡喃羟醚，具有100%的选择性和特定比例为0.89。
