<p>Despite these catalytically desirable properties of zeolites they become inadequate when reactants with sizes above the dimensions of the pores have to be processed.</p>
<p>The reason for their success in catalysis is related to the following specific features of these materials:</p>
<p>(5) Their intricate channel structure allows the zeolites to present different types of shape selectivity, i.e., product, reactant, and transition state, which can be used to direct a given catalytic reaction toward the desired product avoiding undesired side reactions.</p>
<p>In the case of zeolites, they can be activated to produce very stable materials not just resistant to heat and steam but also to chemical attacks.</p>
<p>(6) All of these properties of zeolites, which are of paramount importance in catalysis and make them attractive choices for the types of processes listed above, are ultimately dependent on the thermal and hydrothermal stability of these materials.</p>
<p>Largely for this reason alone another approach has been undertaken in order to increase the activity of the existing microporous materials for processing large molecules such as those existing, for instance, in vacuum gas oil and which need to be cracked and hydrocracked. This approach involves the generation of mesopores in the crystallites of the microporous zeolites.</p>
<p>(1) They have very high surface area and adsorption capacity.</p>
<p>(2) The adsorption properties of the zeolites can be controlled, and they can be varied from hydrophobic to hydrophilic type materials.</p>
<p>(3) Active sites, such as acid sites for instance, can be generated in the framework and their strength and concentration can be tailored for a particular application.</p>
<p>(4) The sizes of their channels and cavities are in the range typical for many molecules of interest (512 Å), and the strong electric fields 2 existing in those micropores together with an electronic confinement of the guest molecules 3 are responsible for a preactivation of the reactants.</p>

The text does not provide details about the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

To answer this question, additional research and specific information about the catalytic mechanism and properties of silica-supported tantalum hydrides for alkane metathesis would be required. The text focuses on zeolite-based catalysis, not specifically on alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides.

文本没有提供关于由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃均裂的全面机制的详细信息，讨论了两站点和单站点方案、线性和环状烷烃转换过程中涉及的过程、关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其作用，以及这些因素如何促进各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能。

要回答这个问题，需要额外的研究和关于由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物用于烷烃均裂的具体催化机制和性质的信息。文本主要关注基于沸石的催化，而不是特别关注由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃均裂。
