[1] "In this case it was found that, at least for lower Ti contents, Ti is tetrahedrally coordinated and is able to epoxidize selectively alkenes using organic hydroperoxides."
[2] "This method somewhat resembles the case where epoxidase enzyme is used instead (0.7) and is much better than the less friendly conventional process involving performic acid: 436"

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes, leading to both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play crucial roles in the reaction pathways. The catalyst's performance and selectivity in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors like the formation and role of these intermediates. In the context of alkane metathesis, the silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit superior performance compared to traditional methods, such as the use of epoxidase enzymes or performic acid, as evidenced by higher selectivity and efficiency.
