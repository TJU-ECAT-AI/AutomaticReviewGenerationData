[1] "Despite these catalytically desirable properties of zeolites they become inadequate when reactants with sizes above the dimensions of the pores have to be processed."
[2] "The strategy used by the scientist to do this was based on the fact that most of the organic templates used to synthesize zeolites affect the gel chemistry and act as void fillers in the growing porous solids."
[3] "The presence of framework tetrahedral Al generates Brnsted acidity which is strong enough to carry out the cracking of paraffins."
[4] "When a large number of defects occur in a small area it can lead to coalescence of mesopores, with the formation of channels and cracks in the crystallite of the zeolite."
[5] "The beneficial effect of the combination of micro and mesoporous region in the zeolite crystallites was shown by comparing the cracking activity of two series of Y zeolite dealuminated by SiCl4 and steam."
[6] "Unfortunately, in processes where the catalyst regeneration occurs at high temperatures the mesoporosity of the catalyst changes during the regeneration and in cases such as the FCC, this occurs in an uncontrollable way."
[7] "Owing to the difficulties to synthesize zeolites having the required extra large channel and cavity sizes, a group of ultralarge pore materials consisting of layered structures with pillars in the interlamellar region, the so-called pillared-layered structures (PLS), 22-28 have been synthesized."
[8] "The ideal situation is for the pillar height to be of the same order as the lateral separation between pillars, resulting in a product with a near uniform pore size distribution."
[9] "Indeed, the openings of the interlayer spaces of PLS are of the molecular size of the feed stocks to FCC."
[10] "When this was done 52 it was found that highly stable materials retaining more than 75% of the surface area after a hydrothermal calcination at 760 C for 4 h were produced."

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

Answer: The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The two-site mechanism typically involves the sequential formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Initially, an alkane is activated by the catalyst, leading to the formation of an alkene as an intermediate. This alkene then reacts with another alkene to form a metallacyclobutane, which subsequently undergoes a rearrangement to regenerate the catalyst and release two new alkenes. This process contributes to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The one-site mechanism involves a more straightforward transformation, where the alkane is directly converted into an alkene through a concerted reaction. The key intermediates in both mechanisms include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Alkenes are crucial as they facilitate the formation of new alkene products through the metathesis reaction. Metallacyclobutanes play a pivotal role in the catalytic cycle by temporarily storing the metal and facilitating the rearrangement reactions.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the stability of the catalyst, the reactivity of the alkane, and the presence of competing reactions. The formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes affects the overall efficiency of the catalytic process, as well as the selectivity towards specific alkene products. The ability of the catalyst to regenerate efficiently after each alkene formation step contributes to maintaining high conversion rates and optimal product yields.

The detailed mechanisms of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involve intricate interactions between the catalyst, alkane substrates, and key intermediates. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and enhancing the efficiency of alkane conversions in industrial applications.

分析硅负载钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的全面机制，讨论双位点和单位点方案、线性和环烷烃转化过程中的关键步骤，以及形成和作用的关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的角色，这些因素如何促进不同烷烃转换的选择性和催化剂性能。

答案：硅负载钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的机制涉及双位点和单位点两种方案。双位点机制通常涉及到形成烯烃和金属环丁烷的连续步骤。首先，烷烃通过催化剂被激活，导致形成作为中间体的烯烃。然后，这个烯烃与另一个烯烃反应形成金属环丁烷，随后进行重排以再生催化剂并释放两个新的烯烃。这个过程有助于反应选择性和催化剂在各种烷烃转换中的性能。

单位点机制涉及更直接的转化，烷烃通过一次反应直接转化为烯烃。关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。烯烃在裂合反应中至关重要，因为它通过裂合反应促进了新烯烃产品的形成。金属环丁烷在催化循环中扮演关键角色，暂时储存金属，并促进重排反应。

催化剂在烷烃转换中的选择性和性能受催化剂稳定性、烷烃反应性以及竞争反应存在的影响。形成烯烃和金属环丁烷影响催化过程的整体效率以及特定烯烃产物的选择性。催化剂能够高效再生后每次烯烃形成步骤的能力有助于保持高转化率和最佳产品产率。

硅负载钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的详细机制涉及催化剂、烷烃底物和关键中间体之间复杂的相互作用。理解这些机制对于优化催化剂性能和提高烷烃转换效率至关重要。
