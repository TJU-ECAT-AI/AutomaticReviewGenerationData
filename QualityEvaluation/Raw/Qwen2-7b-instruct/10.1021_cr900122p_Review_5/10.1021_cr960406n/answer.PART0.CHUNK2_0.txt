[1] "The high surface area of the ordered mesopores together with the presence of groups able to be functionalized have been of great use to support metal oxides and organometalic compounds achieving very high dispersions of the active phase."
[2] "It was found that supports with basic character such as Al2O3 were not appropriate and neutral or mildly acidic supports such as carbon or silica were required."
[3] "In this work, Pt was highly dispersed on ordered (MCM-41) and disordered (MSA) mesoporous solids, and Pt dispersions close to 85% were achieved."
[4] "While complexes such as metalloporphyrin can also be attached to MCM-41 via ionic exchange, 483 one has to be careful in this case when using them as catalysts due to the relative ease with which leaching may occur under reaction conditions."

1. The high surface area of ordered mesopores and their functionalizable groups facilitate the support of metal oxides and organometallic compounds, enabling high dispersion of active phases.

2. Supports with basic character, like Al2O3, were unsuitable; instead, neutral or slightly acidic supports like carbon or silica were found to be more appropriate.

3. In a specific study, platinum (Pt) was highly dispersed on both ordered mesoporous MCM-41 and disordered MSA solids, achieving dispersion levels near 85%.

4. When metalloporphyrins are attached to MCM-41 using ionic exchange, they can be used as catalysts, albeit with caution, as leaching under reaction conditions might be relatively easy.

1. 经有序介孔结构的高比表面积和可功能化的基团，可以有效支持金属氧化物和有机金属化合物，并实现活性组分的高度分散。

2. 基性支持体（如Al2O3）不适合使用；相反，中性和略酸性的支持体（如碳或硅）被发现更适合应用。

3. 在一项具体研究中，铂（Pt）在有序介孔MCM-41和无序MSA固体上高度分散，达到接近85%的分散水平。

4. 当金属环状配体通过离子交换附着到MCM-41时，它们可以作为催化剂使用，但需要注意，在反应条件下，它们的流失可能会相对容易。
