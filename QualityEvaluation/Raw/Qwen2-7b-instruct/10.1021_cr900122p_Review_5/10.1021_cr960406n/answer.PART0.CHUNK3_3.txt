[1] "The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two main sites: one-site and two-site schemes."
[2] "In the one-site scheme, a single active site is responsible for the complete transformation of both ends of the alkane chain."
[3] "In contrast, the two-site scheme involves two active sites that work simultaneously, leading to the formation of a linear alkene and a shorter alkane."
[4] "For linear alkane transformations, the process typically starts with the activation of the alkane at the catalyst surface."
[5] "The formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes is crucial in both one-site and two-site schemes."
[6] "These intermediates play significant roles in determining the reaction pathways and selectivities."
[7] "The catalyst performance is influenced by factors such as the type of support, the metal loading, and the reaction conditions."

催化作用下，硅负载钽氢化物对烷烃的裂合机制涉及两种主要的位点：单个位点和双个位点方案。在单个位点方案中，单一活性位点负责烷烃两端的完整转换。相比之下，双个位点方案涉及两个同时工作的活性位点，导致线性烯烃和较短烷烃的形成。对于线性烷烃转换，过程通常从在催化剂表面激活烷烃开始。在单个位点和双个位点方案中，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成至关重要。这些中间体在确定反应途径和选择性方面起着重要作用。催化剂性能受到支持类型、金属负载量和反应条件等因素的影响。
