[1] "We have seen that they are promising catalysts from the point of view of acid, base, and redox catalysis, as well as supports of active phases."
[2] "Despite the enormous activity developed by researchers in the last five years, there are still some aspects which deserve further and deeper work."
[3] "It would be highly desirable to produce highly thermally and hydrothermally stable materials."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
We've observed that these materials exhibit potential as catalysts in acid, base, and redox reactions, as well as supporting active components. Although significant progress has been made over the past five years, there are still areas requiring more extensive exploration. It would be ideal to create materials that are highly resistant to thermal and hydrothermal degradation.

[1] "The textural characterization of the samples (Table 26) clearly shows that the surface area strongly decreased, indicating that some pores are blocked by the HPA."
[2] "Nevertheless the resultant material was quite active as a catalyst, and in any case more active than the bulk HPA and even H2SO4 for the liquid phase alkylation of 4-tert-butylphenol with isobutene."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The textural analysis (Table 26) indicates that the surface area significantly reduced, suggesting that pores are obstructed by HPA. Nonetheless, the resulting material demonstrated substantial catalytic activity, outperforming bulk HPA and even sulfuric acid in the liquid phase isobutene alkylation of 4-tert-butylphenol.

纹理分析（表26）显示表面面积显著降低，表明存在孔隙被HPA阻塞的情况。然而，最终材料展现出显著的催化活性，在液相异丁烯烷基化4-叔丁基苯酚的过程中，其活性超过HPA粉末甚至硫酸。

[1] "Taking this into account, it was a logical step to make use of the high surface area of pure silica MCM-41 as a support for heteropolyacids (HPA)."
[2] "In this case the HPA retained the Keggin structure on the MCM-41 surface and formed finally dispersed HPA species, without formation of HPA crystals even at HPA loadings as high as 50 wt %."
[3] "Nevertheless the resultant material was quite active as a catalyst, and in any case more active than the bulk HPA and even H2SO4 for the liquid phase alkylation of 4-tert-butylphenol with isobutene."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Considering these factors, it made sense to utilize the high surface area of pure silica MCM-41 as a support for heteropolyacids (HPA). The HPA maintained its Keggin structure on the MCM-41 surface and produced dispersed HPA species, avoiding the formation of HPA crystals even at 50 wt% loading. Despite this, the resulting material was remarkably active as a catalyst, surpassing bulk HPA and even sulfuric acid in the liquid phase isobutene alkylation of 4-tert-butylphenol.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
考虑到这一点，利用纯二氧化硅MCM-41的高比表面积作为Heteropolyacid（HPA）的载体是合理的。HPA在其MCM-41表面上保持了Keggin结构，并形成了分散的HPA物种，即使在高达50 wt%的负载下也未形成HPA晶体。尽管如此，最终材料的催化活性依然显著，超越了HPA粉末甚至硫酸，在液相异丁烯烷基化4-叔丁基苯酚的过程中表现出更优的性能。

[1] "In the case of V-mesoporous catalysts, we discussed before the possible leaching of V during the reaction and the homogeneous catalyzed reaction by the dissolved vanadium."
[2] "On the other hand no leaching was observed during hydroxylation of phenol, indicating that the substrate can induce the leaching of vanadium."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Regarding V-based mesoporous catalysts, we previously explored the potential leaching of vanadium during reactions, which could lead to a homogeneous catalytic process via dissolved vanadium. Conversely, no leaching was detected during the hydroxylation of phenol, suggesting that the substrate might stimulate vanadium leaching.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
对于V基介孔催化剂，我们之前讨论过反应过程中V的可能流失，这可能导致溶解的钒进行均相催化过程。然而，在对苯酚进行羟基化时并未观察到流失，这表明底物可能会促使钒流失。

[1] "Hydroxylation of phenol on Ti, V, Mn, and Cr in MCM-41 and HMS has also been attempted, and it was shown that metal-MCM-41 materials are more active than Metal-HMS, except for the chromium-containing samples where the reverse was true."
[2] "Unfortunately it was not checked in this paper if leaching of any of the metals had occurred during the reaction."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hydroxylation of phenol using Ti, V, Mn, and Cr on MCM-41 and HMS has been attempted, demonstrating that metal-MCM-41 materials exhibit greater activity than Metal-HMS, except for chromium-containing samples where the opposite was observed. Regrettably, this study did not investigate whether any of the metals had leached during the reaction.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
对苯酚进行Ti、V、Mn和Cr的羟基化反应尝试在MCM-41和HMS上进行，结果显示金属-MCM-41材料的活性高于Metal-HMS，除了含铬样品外，结果相反。遗憾的是，本研究未检测反应过程中是否有金属流失。
