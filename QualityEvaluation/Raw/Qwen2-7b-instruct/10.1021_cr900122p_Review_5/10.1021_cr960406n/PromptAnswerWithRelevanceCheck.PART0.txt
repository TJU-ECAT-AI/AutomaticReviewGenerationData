The activity of Ti-MCM-41 to epoxidize small linear olefins with H2O2 was lower than when using Ti-silicalite and Ti-β-zeolite catalysts, indicating that the intrinsic activity of Ti in the MCM-41 was lower than in ZSM-5 and β-zeolites, at least under the reaction conditions used.
However the advantages of Ti-MCM-41 as epoxidation catalyst was in its ability to oxidize large molecules which cannot diffuse in the pores of microporous materials, as well as to use organic hydroperoxides as oxidants.
In that work a MCM-41 structure was prepared which contained in the walls both Ti and Al sites. In essence the catalyst now has both the TiIV oxidation sites, in addition the H+ associated to the AlIV as acid sites, which enables us to carry out in one pot and using tert-butyl hydroperoxide, the multistep oxidation of linalool to cyclic furan and pyran hydroxy ethers with 100% selectivity and in ratio of 0.89.

The high surface area of the ordered mesopores together with the presence of groups able to be functionalized have been of great use to support metal oxides and organometalic compounds achieving very high dispersions of the active phase.
It was found that supports with basic character such as Al2O3 were not appropriate and neutral or mildly acidic supports such as carbon or silica were required.
In this work, Pt was highly dispersed on ordered (MCM-41) and disordered (MSA) mesoporous solids, and Pt dispersions close to 85% were achieved.
While complexes such as metalloporphyrin can also be attached to MCM-41 via ionic exchange, 483 one has to be careful in this case when using them as catalysts due to the relative ease with which leaching may occur under reaction conditions.

The strategy used by the scientist to do this was based on the fact that most of the organic templates used to synthesize zeolites affect the gel chemistry and act as void fillers in the growing porous solids.
This approach did not give positive results in the case of zeolites, but in contrast was quite successful when using Al and P or Ga and P as framework elements.
The presence of framework tetrahedral Al generates Brnsted acidity which is strong enough to carry out the cracking of paraffins.
Despite these catalytically desirable properties of zeolites they become inadequate when reactants with sizes above the dimensions of the pores have to be processed.
The rational approach to overcome such a limitation would be to maintain the porous structure, which is responsible for the benefits described above, but to increase their diameter to bring them into the mesoporous region.
The presence of mesopores in the crystallites of a given zeolite should basically increase the accessibility of large molecules to the external opening of the pores.
The beneficial effect of the combination of micro and mesoporous region in the zeolite crystallites was shown by comparing the cracking activity of two series of Y zeolite dealuminated by SiCl4 and steam.
The dealumination by steam produced many more mesoporous areas within the material while some of the microporosity was destroyed.
The cracking activity of the two series of dealuminated Y zeolites was compared for cracking a small reactant molecule (n-heptane) which can easily penetrate through the pores of the zeolite Y.
However, when the two series of dealuminated Y zeolites were used to crack a vacuum gas oil, containing molecules too large to penetrate deep into the microporous system, the steam-dealuminated samples, which contain a greater proportion of mesoporosity, gave a higher conversion.
Unfortunately, in processes where the catalyst regeneration occurs at high temperatures the mesoporosity of the catalyst changes during the regeneration and in cases such as the FCC, this occurs in an uncontrollable way.
Among the different layered phases, smectites are probably the ones which best fulfill these requirements.
Care should be taken to avoid overfilling the interlayer or in turn introducing too few pillars since then a nonporous intercalate or unstable structure is generated.
Indeed, the openings of the interlayer spaces of PLS are of the molecular size of the feed stocks to FCC.
Even though the most investigated substrates to be pillared include smectite clays, phosphates and phosphonates of tetravalent metals, and layered double hydroxides, the ones showing most promising potential belong to the first group.
However, the resulting material was thermally unstable and therefore, of no practical use for catalysis.
An important qualitative advance was provided by the use of oxyhydroxyaluminum cations as the pillaring agent.
When the exchanged samples are subject to a careful thermal treatment, dehydration and dehydroxylation occur, forming stable metal oxide clusters which serve to separate the layers, creating a two dimensional gallery with an opening, which if properly prepared can be greater than 1.0 nm.
The ideal situation is for the pillar height to be of the same order as the lateral separation between pillars, resulting in a product with a near uniform pore size distribution.
The resultant PLS materials have at least 50% of their surface in pores less than 3.0 nm (intralayer), and the rest is in pores larger than 3.0 nm, i.e., in mesopores (interlayer).
However, in addition and of more interest than just greater stability was the observation that different porosities were obtained with Al/Ce pillars in comparison to the pure Al pillars.
Indeed, the Al/Ce rectorite has a d spacing of 3.49 nm corresponding to an interlayer distance of 1.57 nm which is larger than the interlayer distance (0.84 nm) of the Al rectorite.
Moreover this result has been confirmed from highly sensitive diffuse reflectance IR spectroscopy measurements, where Brnsted acid sites with an acid strength comparable to that of zeolites has been found.
It was soon recognized that different Al-pillared clays such as montmorillonites, saponites, beidellites, etc., have both Brnsted and Lewis acid sites in varying relative proportion.
However, in the case of solid acids, as important as the number and type of acid sites is their acid strength since this will be responsible for the extent to which a given bond in the reactant molecule will be polarized and, consequently, will determine the type of reaction that the solid acid will be able to catalyze.
The total amount of acid sites present in montmorillonites pillared with Al polyhydroxy cations, using n-butylamine as a titrating base, was compared with those obtained with amorphous silica-alumina and HY zeolite.
Indeed, Poncelet and Schulz have considered this aspect by studying the acidity of montmorillonite and beidellite pillared with Al oligomers.
When this was done, it was found that the pillared acid activated clays (PAACs) incorporated less Al than did the conventional PLS, with the former being more mesoporous and less microporous.
Furthermore, the surface acidity was increased. An increase in the number of both Brnsted and Lewis acid sites also occurs when the pillared clays are treated with sulfate or phosphate ions.
When samples are calcined either in vacuum or in air a decrease in acid hydroxyls (dehydroxylation) and consequently on the number of Brnsted sites is observed.
Indeed, in order to stabilize the activity of the catalyst, one should calcine the solid before it is introduced into the reactor at a temperature above the reaction temperature.
It is evident that in the case of pillared materials, the preparation procedures are the determinant factor controlling the density and distribution of pillars, with clear implications on the diffusivity of the reactants in the galleries formed, and consequently on the adsorption and reactivity.
Indeed, in one study coronene (1.1 nm diameter) was successfully adsorbed on one Al-PLS with roughly the same interlayer distance than the material shown in Table 5.
Meanwhile, freeze-dried samples adsorb appreciable amounts of the above molecule, which can be explained by assuming that freeze drying promotes edge to edge or edge to face aggregation and consequently macropores are formed.
In order to accomplish this, three criteria need to be met: (1) Use the whole clay material and preferably a clay requiring the minimal pretreatment. (2) Pillar the Ca or Ca-Na forms, not the Na form in order to avoid the need for a pre-exchange. (3) Use a claypolymer concentration >15% solids, that can be economically and effectively spray dried to give a good particle size distribution (40200 μm).
In the case of real refinery feeds, clays pillared with Al, Zr, or Ti have been used as the acid component of the hydrotreating catalyst formulation.
When this was done it was found that highly stable materials retaining more than 75% of the surface area after a hydrothermal calcination at 760 C for 4 h were produced.
The results from Table 8 indicate that sample 2 has a lower C/N ratio than sample 1. Moreover the CTMA/N ratios obtained strongly suggest that the liquid crystals are CTMA+Cl-SiO+ and CTMA+NO3-SiO+ for samples 1 and 2, respectively.
The results in Figure 24 nicely show that a typical MCM-41 material with d100 = 4.25 nm is formed in the presence of TMA+ when the crystallization time was 24 h.
If crystallization is prolonged beyond that a loss of crystallinity accompanied by a decrease in the pore volume of the mesoporous material was observed.
In Figure 25 a correlation between the unit cell parameter (a0) of the resultant MCM-41 sample and the crystallization time is given.
Variables such as temperature, CTMA/SiO2 ratio, and nature of the cation (TMA+, TEA+, Na+) are all important for controlling the process.
The swelling mechanism observed may be related to the replacement of some CTMA+ by tetraalkylammonium cations in the interphase formed between the liquid crystal and the silica surfaces.

In the case of zeolites, for example zeolite Y and CSZ-1, it was shown 18,19 that during the dealumination of the zeolite by steam mesopores of mixed sizes in the range 1020 nm were formed which could be characterized by different techniques including gas adsorption, high-resolution electron microscopy, and analytical electron microscopy.
The presence of the mesopores in the crystallites of a given zeolite should basically increase the accessibility of large molecules to the external opening of the pores.
Indeed the openings of the interlayer spaces of PLS are of the molecular size of the feed stocks to FCC.
Increasing thermal and hydrothermal stability of the original aluminum pillared smectites has also been attempted by intercalating them with Al and Ce precursors.
There is no doubt that the primary interest in developing acid PLS was related with their use as cracking catalysts in FCC units.
The total amount of Lewis sites also decreases with calcination temperature, but however, there are still Lewis sites remaining at calcination temperatures above 500 C.
When the molecule has reached the surface of the catalyst it has to find the acid site whose characteristics have been described above.
In the case of real refinery feeds, clays pillared with Al, Zr, or Ti have been used as the acid component of the hydrotreating catalyst formulation.
Acidic clays by themselves or pillared with Al, Zr, and Cr have been used to catalyze organic reactions requiring Lewis and Brnsted acids such as AlCl3, HF, or H2SO4.
The possibility of making bifunctional Pt/PLS catalysts has been illustrated by using test reactions such as the hydroisomerization and hydrocracking of n-alkanes.

The mesopores in zeolites increase the accessibility of large molecules to the external openings of the pores. The mesopores in pillared layer solids (PLS) have sizes comparable to the molecular sizes of feedstocks for FCC processes. By intercalating aluminum and cerium precursors, the thermal and hydrothermal stability of aluminum pillared smectites can be enhanced. The primary interest in developing acid PLS was their use as cracking catalysts in FCC units. Even at high calcination temperatures above 500°C, some Lewis acid sites remain in PLS. Acid sites on PLS are crucial for catalyzing organic reactions, especially those requiring Lewis and Brnsted acids. PLS have been used as the acid component in hydrotreating catalyst formulations. Acidic clays, whether pillared or not, have been utilized to catalyze reactions requiring both Lewis and Brnsted acids. Bifunctional Pt/PLS catalysts have been demonstrated for hydroisomerization and hydrocracking of n-alkanes.

在沸石中，介孔的存在提高了大分子到达孔外部开口的可达性。在片层材料（PLS）中的介孔大小与FCC过程中的分子尺寸相匹配。通过插入铝和铈前体，可以增强铝基粘土的热稳定性和水热稳定性。开发酸性PLS的主要兴趣在于将其用作FCC催化剂。即使在500°C以上的高温下，PLS中仍可能保留一些Lewis酸位点。PLS上的酸位对于催化需要Lewis酸和Brnsted酸的有机反应至关重要。酸性粘土，无论是单独使用还是经过改性，已被用于催化需要Lewis酸和Brnsted酸的反应。已证明，Pt/PLS双功能催化剂可用于n-烷烃的氢异构化和氢裂解。

Mesoporous molecular sieves present very high surface areas with very regular pore size dimensions.
The large pores of MCM-41 combined with acidity on the walls were specially conceived to carry out catalytic cracking of large molecules.
In this case, a mesoporous silica with uniform pore size was prepared by ion exchange of interlayer Na ions of the layered polysilicate kanemite for surfactants.
When adsorption was carried out on a MCM-41 sample with 4.0 nm pore diameter, it was found that the isotherm for N2 is type IV in the IUPAC classification.
The acidity of Al-containing MCM-41 samples has been measured by adsorptiondesorption of bases such as pyridine and NH3.
In the case of Ti-substituted MCM-41, spectroscopic and catalytic techniques should be used to show the incorporation of Ti in the silica framework.
Indeed, the results show that while Ti-β-zeolite is more active in reaction 1, the order of reactivity is reversed when a bulkier sulfide is involved (reaction 2).

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the activation of alkane substrates by the catalyst, leading to the formation of alkenes and then rearrangement to form new alkane products. This process can occur through both two-site and one-site schemes, depending on the specific reaction conditions and the structure of the alkane substrates. In the two-site mechanism, an alkane molecule is split into two fragments, which then rearrange to form a new alkane product. In the one-site mechanism, an alkane molecule is transformed directly into a new alkane product without the intermediate formation of alkenes.

Linear alkane transformations typically involve the cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond, while cyclic alkane transformations involve the opening of a ring structure. Key intermediates in this process include alkenes, which are formed during the cleavage of alkane bonds, and metallacyclobutanes, which are formed during the rearrangement of cyclic alkane structures. The role of these intermediates is crucial for the efficiency and selectivity of the alkane metathesis reaction, as they enable the catalyst to access different parts of the alkane structure and promote the desired transformation.

The selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the concentration and distribution of tantalum hydrides on the silica support, the temperature and pressure conditions of the reaction, and the specific structure of the alkane substrates. The silica support helps to stabilize the tantalum hydrides, preventing them from agglomerating and maintaining their catalytic activity. The optimal conditions for each alkane conversion will depend on the balance between these factors, aiming to maximize the yield of the desired alkane product while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the strategic activation and rearrangement of alkane substrates, facilitated by the presence of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as intermediates. The selectivity and performance of this process are influenced by the conditions of the reaction and the structure of the catalyst, aiming for efficient and controlled alkane transformations.

烷烃的甲烷化由硅基支持的钽氢催化机制涉及烷烃底物的激活，导致烯烃的形成，然后重新排列形成新的烷烃产品。该过程可以按照两种方案发生：双位点机制和单位点机制，具体取决于特定反应条件和烷烃底物结构。在双位点机制中，一个烷烃分子被分裂成两个片段，然后重新排列形成一个新的烷烃产品。在单位点机制中，一个烷烃分子直接转变为新的烷烃产品，而无需中间形成烯烃。

线性烷烃转换通常涉及碳-碳键的断裂，而环烷烃转换涉及环结构的打开。该过程中关键的中间体包括烯烃，它们在烷烃键断裂时形成；以及金属环丁烷，它们在环烷烃结构重排时形成。这些中间体在控制烷烃转换效率和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用，因为它们使催化剂能够访问烷烃的不同部分并促进所需转化。

烷烃转换的选择性和催化剂性能受到诸如硅基支持上钽氢的浓度和分布、反应的温度和压力条件以及烷烃底物结构等因素的影响。硅基支持有助于稳定钽氢，防止它们聚集并维持其催化活性。对于每种烷烃转换，最佳条件将取决于这些因素之间的平衡，旨在最大化所需烷烃产品的产率同时最小化副产品的生成。

综上所述，硅基支持的钽氢催化烷烃的甲烷化机制涉及对烷烃底物的策略性激活和重组，由烯烃和金属环丁烷作为中间体支持。该过程的选择性和性能受反应条件和催化剂结构的影响，目标是高效且可控地进行烷烃转化。

Indirect Synthesis...the pore size could be changed by varying the alkyl chain length of the surfactant, and a more precise pore-size control was achieved by trimethylsilylation of the inner surface of the pores.
Mesoporous silica with uniform pore size was prepared by ion exchange of interlayer Na ions of the layered polysilicate kanemite for surfactants.
The pore size distribution is broader in the case of FSM-16, where the total pore volume and hydrocarbon sorption capacity is about 5 times higher in the case of the MCM-41 materials.
In Table 9 we have summarized the most significant reports highlighting the synthesis variables for the incorporation of Al into the wall of MCM-41.
When the results were plotted (Figure 27), it could be clearly seen that when the aluminum source is polymeric (pseudobohemite), the incorporation of Al in the framework of the MCM-41 decreases with decreasing OH/SiO2 ratio in the gel.
Attempts have also been made to prepare samples with a high aluminum content.
Titanium has also been introduced by direct synthesis in a MCM-48 structure, using TEOS and tetraisopropyl titanate as the sources of Si and Ti, respectively.
What can be of interest from the viewpoint of the catalytic use of these materials as zirconia-sulfated solid acids, is the observation that it is possible to prepare them in the form of tetragonal zirconium(IV) oxide, by calcination at 650 C.
The definitive proof in favor of the tetrahedral coordination of Ti in MCM-41 came from the application of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS/XANES).
In the case of the mild acidity of Al-MCM-41, it can also be useful for isomerizing normal paraffins into isoparaffins on bifunctional Pt/MCM-41 catalysts.

In the one-site scheme, a single active site is responsible for the complete transformation of both ends of the alkane chain.
In contrast, the two-site scheme involves two active sites that work simultaneously, leading to the formation of a linear alkene and a shorter alkane.
For linear alkane transformations, the process typically starts with the activation of the alkane at the catalyst surface.
The formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes is crucial in both one-site and two-site schemes.

<p>Despite these catalytically desirable properties of zeolites they become inadequate when reactants with sizes above the dimensions of the pores have to be processed.</p>
<p>The reason for their success in catalysis is related to the following specific features of these materials:</p>
<p>(5) Their intricate channel structure allows the zeolites to present different types of shape selectivity, i.e., product, reactant, and transition state, which can be used to direct a given catalytic reaction toward the desired product avoiding undesired side reactions.</p>
<p>In the case of zeolites, they can be activated to produce very stable materials not just resistant to heat and steam but also to chemical attacks.</p>
<p>(6) All of these properties of zeolites, which are of paramount importance in catalysis and make them attractive choices for the types of processes listed above, are ultimately dependent on the thermal and hydrothermal stability of these materials.</p>
<p>Largely for this reason alone another approach has been undertaken in order to increase the activity of the existing microporous materials for processing large molecules such as those existing, for instance, in vacuum gas oil and which need to be cracked and hydrocracked. This approach involves the generation of mesopores in the crystallites of the microporous zeolites.</p>
<p>(1) They have very high surface area and adsorption capacity.</p>
<p>(2) The adsorption properties of the zeolites can be controlled, and they can be varied from hydrophobic to hydrophilic type materials.</p>
<p>(3) Active sites, such as acid sites for instance, can be generated in the framework and their strength and concentration can be tailored for a particular application.</p>
<p>(4) The sizes of their channels and cavities are in the range typical for many molecules of interest (512 Å), and the strong electric fields 2 existing in those micropores together with an electronic confinement of the guest molecules 3 are responsible for a preactivation of the reactants.</p>

In this case it was found that, at least for lower Ti contents, Ti is tetrahedrally coordinated and is able to epoxidize selectively alkenes using organic hydroperoxides.
This method somewhat resembles the case where epoxidase enzyme is used instead (0.7) and is much better than the less friendly conventional process involving performic acid: 436

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, linear alkane transformations occur through the formation of alkenes as key intermediates. These alkenes then undergo a rearrangement to form cyclic alkane transformations. The one-site scheme involves the direct formation of cyclic alkane products without the initial step of alkenes. The processes involve the activation of the alkane substrates by the catalyst, leading to the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds and subsequent recombination to form the desired alkane products. The role of the catalyst is crucial in providing the necessary activation energy and facilitating the rearrangement of the alkane molecules. The selectivity of the catalyst towards specific alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as the type of catalyst, the reaction conditions, and the nature of the alkane substrates. 

The catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is determined by its ability to efficiently activate the alkane substrates, control the reaction pathways, and minimize side reactions. The silica-supported tantalum hydrides enable selective alkane metathesis by providing a stable and active surface for the catalytic reactions to occur. The high surface area of the silica support enhances the availability of the active tantalum sites, while the stabilization by silica ensures the long-term stability and reusability of the catalyst.

In the comparison with other catalysts, such as epoxidase enzymes and performic acid, the silica-supported tantalum hydrides demonstrate superior performance in alkane metathesis reactions. The use of organic hydroperoxides as oxidants, facilitated by the catalyst, enables the selective epoxidation of alkenes, which is a critical step in alkane metathesis. This method is more efficient and environmentally friendly compared to conventional processes involving performic acid, which often require harsher conditions and generate additional waste.

该文献中关于硅基钽氢化物催化烷烃异构化的全面机制包括两种位点方案和单位点方案。在两个位点方案中，线性烷烃转换通过形成关键中间体烯烃发生。这些烯烃随后经历重组以形成环烷烃转换。单位点方案涉及直接形成环烷烃产品，而无需初始步骤的烯烃形成。过程涉及催化剂对烷烃底物的激活，导致碳-碳键的断裂和随后的重组形成所需烷烃产物。催化剂的作用是提供必要的活化能，并促进烷烃分子的重组反应。催化剂对特定烷烃转化的选择性受催化剂类型、反应条件和烷烃底物性质等因素的影响。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能由其有效激活烷烃底物、控制反应途径并最小化副反应的能力决定。硅基钽氢化物通过提供进行催化反应的有效表面来实现选择性烷烃异构化。硅支持的高表面积增强了活性钽位点的可用性，而硅的稳定化确保了催化剂的长期稳定性和可重复使用性。

与其他催化剂（如酶和过氧酸）相比，在与硅基钽氢化物的比较中，烷烃异构化反应显示出优越的性能。有机过氧化物作为氧化剂的使用，通过催化剂得以实现，使得烯烃的有选择性的环氧化，这是烷烃异构化的一个关键步骤。这种方法比传统的使用过氧酸的常规过程更高效且环境友好，后者通常需要更苛刻的条件并产生额外的废物。

When this catalyst was compared with an optimized Ti-MCM-41 containing 2 wt % of TiO2, it is found that the olefin epoxidation activity per Ti atom is larger on Ti-MCM-41, but since the titania-silica aerogel has a much larger titanium content the conversion achieved on this sample is higher.
Owing to the success in the incorporation of Ti and its relatively good behavior as a selective oxidation catalyst, other transition metal elements with potential catalytic activity were also intended to be introduced on the walls of the MCM-41.
For instance, a vanadium-containing mesoporous catalyst was used for the hydroxylation of 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol (2,6 TBP) into 2,6-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone with high conversion selectivity and efficient H2O2 utilization.
In the case of V-mesoporous catalysts, we discussed before the possible leaching of V during the reaction and the homogeneous catalyzed reaction by the dissolved vanadium.
In the case of olefin epoxidation, the selectivity towards the epoxide is always lower on Zr-MS compared to Ti-MS.
There is no doubt that even though the substrates studied up to now are smaller than 3.5 nm, in the case of liquid-phase processes, effectiveness factors lower than one still may exist for molecules with sizes above 1.2 nm.
In this respect, one should not forget that when increasing the Ti content a part of the incorporated Ti will be in the walls and, even if it is in the correct coordination, will not cooperate to the final activity since will not be accessible to the reactants.
The textural characterization of the samples (Table 26) clearly shows that the surface area strongly decreased, indicating that some pores are blocked by the HPA, and therefore there is not a uniform distribution of the acid on the surface.
This fact opens up the possibility of carrying out enantioselective epoxidation of olefins.

1. The olefin epoxidation activity per Ti atom on Ti-MCM-41 is higher than on Ti-MCM-41 containing 2 wt % of TiO2, but the conversion is higher on the latter due to its larger titanium content.

2. Transition metals like vanadium, chromium, iron, chromium, and manganese have been incorporated into the walls of MCM-41 for catalytic purposes.

3. A vanadium-containing mesoporous catalyst was effectively used for the hydroxylation of 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, resulting in high conversion selectivity and efficient utilization of hydrogen peroxide.

4. During reactions involving vanadium-containing mesoporous catalysts, there is a possibility of vanadium leaching, which affects the reaction's catalytic performance.

5. In olefin epoxidation, the selectivity towards the epoxide is generally lower on Zirconium-containing mesoporous silica molecular sieves compared to Titanium-containing ones.

6. In liquid-phase processes, effectiveness factors lower than one might exist for molecules with sizes above 1.2 nm, indicating limitations in catalytic performance.

7. Increasing the Titanium content in the material results in some of the incorporated Titanium being present in the walls, which negatively impacts the overall activity since it is not accessible to reactants.

8. The presence of HPA (Heteropolyacids) leads to a decrease in the surface area of the material, suggesting that some pores are blocked by the HPA, leading to a non-uniform distribution of the acid on the surface.

9. The study indicates that it is possible to perform enantioselective epoxidation of olefins using anchored complexes covalently bonded to the walls of mesoporous materials.

Despite these catalytically desirable properties of zeolites they become inadequate when reactants with sizes above the dimensions of the pores have to be processed.
The strategy used by the scientist to do this was based on the fact that most of the organic templates used to synthesize zeolites affect the gel chemistry and act as void fillers in the growing porous solids.
The presence of framework tetrahedral Al generates Brnsted acidity which is strong enough to carry out the cracking of paraffins.
When a large number of defects occur in a small area it can lead to coalescence of mesopores, with the formation of channels and cracks in the crystallite of the zeolite.
The beneficial effect of the combination of micro and mesoporous region in the zeolite crystallites was shown by comparing the cracking activity of two series of Y zeolite dealuminated by SiCl4 and steam.
Unfortunately, in processes where the catalyst regeneration occurs at high temperatures the mesoporosity of the catalyst changes during the regeneration and in cases such as the FCC, this occurs in an uncontrollable way.
Owing to the difficulties to synthesize zeolites having the required extra large channel and cavity sizes, a group of ultralarge pore materials consisting of layered structures with pillars in the interlamellar region, the so-called pillared-layered structures (PLS), 22-28 have been synthesized.
The ideal situation is for the pillar height to be of the same order as the lateral separation between pillars, resulting in a product with a near uniform pore size distribution.
Indeed, the openings of the interlayer spaces of PLS are of the molecular size of the feed stocks to FCC.
When this was done 52 it was found that highly stable materials retaining more than 75% of the surface area after a hydrothermal calcination at 760 C for 4 h were produced.

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

Answer: The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The two-site mechanism typically involves the sequential formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Initially, an alkane is activated by the catalyst, leading to the formation of an alkene as an intermediate. This alkene then reacts with another alkene to form a metallacyclobutane, which subsequently undergoes a rearrangement to regenerate the catalyst and release two new alkenes. This process contributes to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The one-site mechanism involves a more straightforward transformation, where the alkane is directly converted into an alkene through a concerted reaction. The key intermediates in both mechanisms include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Alkenes are crucial as they facilitate the formation of new alkene products through the metathesis reaction. Metallacyclobutanes play a pivotal role in the catalytic cycle by temporarily storing the metal and facilitating the rearrangement reactions.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the stability of the catalyst, the reactivity of the alkane, and the presence of competing reactions. The formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes affects the overall efficiency of the catalytic process, as well as the selectivity towards specific alkene products. The ability of the catalyst to regenerate efficiently after each alkene formation step contributes to maintaining high conversion rates and optimal product yields.

The detailed mechanisms of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involve intricate interactions between the catalyst, alkane substrates, and key intermediates. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and enhancing the efficiency of alkane conversions in industrial applications.
