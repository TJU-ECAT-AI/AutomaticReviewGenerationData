[1] "Indirect Synthesis...the pore size could be changed by varying the alkyl chain length of the surfactant, and a more precise pore-size control was achieved by trimethylsilylation of the inner surface of the pores."
[2] "Mesoporous silica with uniform pore size was prepared by ion exchange of interlayer Na ions of the layered polysilicate kanemite for surfactants."
[3] "The pore size distribution is broader in the case of FSM-16, where the total pore volume and hydrocarbon sorption capacity is about 5 times higher in the case of the MCM-41 materials."
[4] "In Table 9 we have summarized the most significant reports highlighting the synthesis variables for the incorporation of Al into the wall of MCM-41."
[5] "When the results were plotted (Figure 27), it could be clearly seen that when the aluminum source is polymeric (pseudobohemite), the incorporation of Al in the framework of the MCM-41 decreases with decreasing OH/SiO2 ratio in the gel."
[6] "Attempts have also been made to prepare samples with a high aluminum content."
[7] "Titanium has also been introduced by direct synthesis in a MCM-48 structure, using TEOS and tetraisopropyl titanate as the sources of Si and Ti, respectively."
[8] "What can be of interest from the viewpoint of the catalytic use of these materials as zirconia-sulfated solid acids, is the observation that it is possible to prepare them in the form of tetragonal zirconium(IV) oxide, by calcination at 650 C."
[9] "The definitive proof in favor of the tetrahedral coordination of Ti in MCM-41 came from the application of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS/XANES)."
[10] "In the case of the mild acidity of Al-MCM-41, it can also be useful for isomerizing normal paraffins into isoparaffins on bifunctional Pt/MCM-41 catalysts."
