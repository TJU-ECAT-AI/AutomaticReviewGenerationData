[1] "The high surface area of the ordered mesopores together with the presence of groups able to be functionalized have been of great use to support metal oxides and organometalic compounds achieving very high dispersions of the active phase."

[2] "While complexes such as metalloporphyrin can also be attached to MCM-41 via ionic exchange, 483 one has to be careful in this case when using them as catalysts due to the relative ease with which leaching may occur under reaction conditions."

The high surface area and functionalizable groups of ordered mesopores facilitate the support of metal oxides and organometallic compounds, leading to highly dispersed active phases. Metalloporphyrin complexes can be attached to MCM-41 through ionic exchange, but caution is advised due to the potential for leaching under reaction conditions.

有序介孔材料的高比表面积和可功能化的基团使得它们能够支持金属氧化物和有机金属化合物，从而实现活性组分的高度分散。金属卟啉复合物可以通过离子交换附着到MCM-41上，但需要谨慎，因为这可能导致在反应条件下发生泄漏。
