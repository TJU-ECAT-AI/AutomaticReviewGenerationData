[1] "Tantalum hydrides have been supported on silica in order to catalyze alkane metathesis reactions."
[2] "The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes."
[3] "In the two-site scheme, the reaction proceeds through the formation of alkenes and then rearrangement to form the desired alkane."
[4] "In the one-site scheme, a single active site facilitates the formation of an alkene, which then undergoes a series of intramolecular rearrangements to form the product alkane."
[5] "Linear alkane metathesis typically involves the formation of an alkene, followed by an intramolecular shift to regenerate the starting alkane."
[6] "Cyclic alkane metathesis can proceed through the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which then rearranges to form the product alkane."
[7] "Key intermediates in the alkane metathesis process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in facilitating the rearrangements that lead to alkane products."
[8] "The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions depend on factors such as the support type, metal loading, and reaction conditions."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides reveals two primary schemes: two-site and one-site mechanisms. In the two-site scheme, the reaction starts with the formation of alkenes, followed by an intramolecular rearrangement to regenerate the starting alkane. Conversely, the one-site scheme involves a single active site for the formation of an alkene, which then undergoes a series of intramolecular rearrangements to form the product alkane. Linear alkane metathesis typically follows a straightforward pathway of alkene formation and subsequent rearrangement. Cyclic alkane metathesis can proceed through the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which rearranges to form the product alkane. Key intermediates in this process are alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which facilitate the rearrangements leading to alkane products. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions are influenced by factors including the support type, metal loading, and reaction conditions.

对于由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的全面机制分析显示了两种主要方案：双位点和单位点机制。在双位点方案中，反应从形成烯烃开始，随后进行分子内重排以再生起始烷烃。相反，单位点方案涉及单个活性位点形成烯烃，然后进行一系列分子内重排以形成产物烷烃。线性烷烃裂合通常遵循一个简单的途径，即烯烃的形成和随后的重排。环状烷烃裂合可以通过形成金属环丁烷中间体进行，该中间体然后重排形成产物烷烃。此过程中关键中间体是烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们促进了引导烷烃产物的重排。催化剂在烷烃转化中的选择性和性能受到支持类型、金属负载和反应条件等因素的影响。
