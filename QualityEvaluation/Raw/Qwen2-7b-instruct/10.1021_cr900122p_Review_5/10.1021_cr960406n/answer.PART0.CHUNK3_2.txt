Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes. This process includes transformations of both linear and cyclic alkanes, leading to the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, are crucial in determining the reaction selectivity and the overall performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
