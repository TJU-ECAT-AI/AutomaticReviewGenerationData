[1] "In the case of zeolites, for example zeolite Y and CSZ-1, it was shown 18,19 that during the dealumination of the zeolite by steam mesopores of mixed sizes in the range 1020 nm were formed which could be characterized by different techniques including gas adsorption, high-resolution electron microscopy, and analytical electron microscopy."
[2] "The presence of the mesopores in the crystallites of a given zeolite should basically increase the accessibility of large molecules to the external opening of the pores."
[3] "Indeed the openings of the interlayer spaces of PLS are of the molecular size of the feed stocks to FCC."
[4] "Increasing thermal and hydrothermal stability of the original aluminum pillared smectites has also been attempted by intercalating them with Al and Ce precursors."
[5] "There is no doubt that the primary interest in developing acid PLS was related with their use as cracking catalysts in FCC units."
[6] "The total amount of Lewis sites also decreases with calcination temperature, but however, there are still Lewis sites remaining at calcination temperatures above 500 C."
[7] "When the molecule has reached the surface of the catalyst it has to find the acid site whose characteristics have been described above."
[8] "In the case of real refinery feeds, clays pillared with Al, Zr, or Ti have been used as the acid component of the hydrotreating catalyst formulation."
[9] "Acidic clays by themselves or pillared with Al, Zr, and Cr have been used to catalyze organic reactions requiring Lewis and Brnsted acids such as AlCl3, HF, or H2SO4."
[10] "The possibility of making bifunctional Pt/PLS catalysts has been illustrated by using test reactions such as the hydroisomerization and hydrocracking of n-alkanes."

The mesopores in zeolites increase the accessibility of large molecules to the external openings of the pores. The mesopores in pillared layer solids (PLS) have sizes comparable to the molecular sizes of feedstocks for FCC processes. By intercalating aluminum and cerium precursors, the thermal and hydrothermal stability of aluminum pillared smectites can be enhanced. The primary interest in developing acid PLS was their use as cracking catalysts in FCC units. Even at high calcination temperatures above 500°C, some Lewis acid sites remain in PLS. Acid sites on PLS are crucial for catalyzing organic reactions, especially those requiring Lewis and Brnsted acids. PLS have been used as the acid component in hydrotreating catalyst formulations. Acidic clays, whether pillared or not, have been utilized to catalyze reactions requiring both Lewis and Brnsted acids. Bifunctional Pt/PLS catalysts have been demonstrated for hydroisomerization and hydrocracking of n-alkanes.

在沸石中，介孔的存在提高了大分子到达孔外部开口的可达性。在片层材料（PLS）中的介孔大小与FCC过程中的分子尺寸相匹配。通过插入铝和铈前体，可以增强铝基粘土的热稳定性和水热稳定性。开发酸性PLS的主要兴趣在于将其用作FCC催化剂。即使在500°C以上的高温下，PLS中仍可能保留一些Lewis酸位点。PLS上的酸位对于催化需要Lewis酸和Brnsted酸的有机反应至关重要。酸性粘土，无论是单独使用还是经过改性，已被用于催化需要Lewis酸和Brnsted酸的反应。已证明，Pt/PLS双功能催化剂可用于n-烷烃的氢异构化和氢裂解。
