Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides reveals that both two-site and one-site schemes are involved. In the two-site scheme, the reaction pathway includes the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The one-site scheme allows for direct alkane transformation without the intermediate step of alkenes. Linear alkane conversion frequently results in the creation of cycloalkanes as essential intermediates. Cyclic alkane transformations might involve rearranging carbon atoms within the ring structure. Alkenes, acting as key intermediates, significantly impact the product distribution. Metallacyclobutanes, produced during the catalytic cycle, are vital for achieving high reaction selectivity. The specific operational conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst concentration, greatly affect the catalyst's performance.

分析由硅基支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的全面机制显示，涉及两种位点方案和单一位点方案。在两种位点方案中，反应途径包括形成烯烃和金属环丁烷。单一位点方案允许直接烷烃转化而不通过中间烯烃步骤。线性烷烃转化通常导致形成环烷烃作为关键中间体。环烷烃转换可能涉及碳原子在环结构内的重新排列。作为关键中间体的烯烃显著影响产物分布。金属环丁烷，在催化循环中产生，对于实现高反应选择性至关重要。特定的操作条件，如温度、压力和催化剂浓度，极大地影响催化剂性能。
