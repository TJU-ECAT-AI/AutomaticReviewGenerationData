[1] "The conversion of hydrocarbons in particular is at the heart of the refining of crude oil, the modification of fat in food industries, and the synthesis of pharmaceutical products and fine chemicals."
[2] "Unfortunately, since catalytic processes are generally quite complex, little is known about the individual steps that take place at the molecular level in such systems."
[3] "The details of the processes involved in the conversion of saturated hydrocarbons are still not well understood."
[4] "However, since that reaction often displays quite low probabilities, catalytic processes need to be performed under fairly severe pressure and temperature conditions in order to reach reasonable conversion rates."
[5] "Several approaches have been taken in order to overcome the difficulties mentioned above."
[6] "One way to make C-H bond breaking reactions easier under vacuum is by using open surfaces with low-coordination metal atoms, because those sites tend to display higher reactivity."
[7] "Alternatively, supersonic beams can be used to deliver gas molecules having the high energies needed for their activation."
[8] "High pressures are not easy to reproduce in the vacuum environments normally used in surface science studies, and in addition, they tend to accelerate the conversion of alkyl groups into other species, making the steady-state concentration of those intermediates on the catalyst surface too low to be detected."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The process typically follows a two-site or one-site scheme, depending on whether the catalyst is homogeneous or heterogeneous. In the context of linear alkane transformations, the mechanism often starts with the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which then undergoes a concerted rearrangement to produce an alkene. For cyclic alkane transformations, a metallacyclobutane intermediate is often formed, which then undergoes a ring-opening metathesis reaction to generate a new alkene.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the catalyst composition, the support material, the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, and solvent), and the nature of the alkane substrate. The two-site and one-site schemes refer to the locations where the metathesis reaction occurs. In a two-site mechanism, the reaction proceeds through sequential steps involving the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate, followed by its transformation into an alkene. In contrast, a one-site mechanism involves a single step where the alkane directly converts into an alkene without the formation of an intermediate.

The formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes is crucial for the efficiency and selectivity of the metathesis reaction. Alkenes are the primary products, while metallacyclobutanes play a pivotal role as intermediates that facilitate the alkene formation. The catalyst's ability to control the reaction pathways and stabilize these intermediates determines the overall selectivity and performance in alkane conversions.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation and manipulation of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which are crucial for the efficient conversion of alkanes under specific conditions. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by factors such as the reaction conditions, catalyst composition, and the nature of the alkane substrate.

烷烃裂合由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化机制涉及关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷的作用。过程通常遵循双站点或单站点方案，取决于催化剂的同质或异质性质。在线性烷烃转换的背景下，机制往往以形成一个碳正离子中间体开始，然后经历一个协同重排生成一个烯烃。对于环烷烃转换，通常会形成一个金属环丁烷中间体，随后进行环开裂-裂合反应生成新的烯烃。

选择性和性能在各种烷烃转换中受催化剂组成、支持材料、反应条件（温度、压力和溶剂）以及烷烃底物性质的影响。双站点和单站点方案指的是反应发生的地点。在双站点机制中，反应通过一系列步骤进行，涉及形成一个金属环丁烷中间体，随后将其转化为烯烃。相比之下，在单站点机制中，烷烃直接转化为烯烃，而没有形成中间体。

形成烯烃和金属环丁烷是高效进行裂合反应的关键。烯烃是主要产物，而金属环丁烷作为促进烯烃形成的中间体起着至关重要的作用。催化剂控制反应途径和稳定这些中间体的能力决定了整体选择性和性能在烷烃转换中的表现。

综上所述，由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃裂合机制涉及关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷的形成与调控，对高效烷烃转换至关重要。选择性和性能受反应条件、催化剂组成和烷烃底物性质等因素的影响。
