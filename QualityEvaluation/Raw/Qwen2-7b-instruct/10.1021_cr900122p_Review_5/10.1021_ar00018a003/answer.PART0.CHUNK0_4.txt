[1] "Alkyl halides chemisorb molecularly on transition metal surfaces at low temperatures and that the scission of the carbon-halogen bond can be easily activated either thermally or photolytically to yield adsorbed alkyl moieties."
[2] "The photochemistry of these systems has been studied in detail by Professor White at the University of Texas, Austin;@ he has found that the C-X bond can be dissociated on surfaces by exposing them to ultraviolet light of lower energy than that needed in the gas phase."
[3] "Thermal activation is equally effective in driving this step: the energy required to break the C-I bond on Ni(100) surfaces was measured to be less than 5 kcal/mol,14 about the same as what has been observed in solution."
[4] "The initial carbon-halogen bond dissociation in alkyl halides leads to the formation of chemisorbed alkyl moieties."
[5] "Surface alkyl groups can undergo further transformations at higher temperatures by following a series of dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, H-D exchange, and polymerization reactions."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two primary schemes: two-site and one-site. Two-site mechanisms typically involve the formation of metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates, which then undergo rearrangement to produce alkenes and alkynes. One-site mechanisms might focus on the direct transformation of alkane rings into cycloalkanes or cycloalkenes through the coordination of the tantalum hydride catalyst with the alkane substrate. The processes involved include linear and cyclic alkane transformations, where linear alkanes are converted into branched or cyclic forms. The formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes plays a crucial role in these transformations, influencing the selectivity and efficiency of the reactions. Catalyst performance is enhanced by the precise control over the reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the presence of co-catalysts or promoters. These factors contribute to the overall conversion rates and the specificity towards desired products, making silica-supported tantalum hydrides a promising catalyst system for alkane metathesis.

催化作用于二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的烷烃裂解全面机制涉及两种主要方案：两站点和单站点。两站点机制通常涉及到形成金属环丁烷作为关键中间体，随后进行重组以产生烯烃和炔烃。单站点机制可能更侧重于直接将烷烃环转化为环烷烃或环烷酮，通过钽氢化催化剂与烷烃基团的协调。过程包括线性和环状烷烃的转换，其中线性烷烃被转化为分支或环状形式。烯烃和金属环丁烷的形成在这些转换中起着关键作用，影响反应的选择性和效率。催化剂性能通过精确控制反应条件，包括温度、压力和共催化剂或促进剂的存在，得到增强。这些因素共同决定了总体转化率和对目标产品的特定性，使二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物成为烷烃裂解有前景的催化剂系统。
