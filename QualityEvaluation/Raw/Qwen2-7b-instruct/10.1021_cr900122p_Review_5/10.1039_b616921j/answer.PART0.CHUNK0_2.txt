[1] "The catalytic activity of the hydride 6 was compared with that of [(SiO)2Ta(H)] (1) in the metathesis of propane."
[2] "Under similar conditions (970 equiv/Ta, 150 C, 5 d), 100 turnovers (TON) were obtained after 120 h, in place of 58 for 1 (Fig. 4a)."
[3] "Therefore, the presence of Zr increases the overall activity and lifetime of the tantalum hydride, while ZrH itself is inactive in alkane metathesis."
[4] "Noteworthy: this system is more selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues (Fig. 4b): the overall selectivity in ethane and butanes is 80% and that of methane is only 10% for 6, in contrast to 1, for which they are 70 and 20%, respectively."
[5] "The hydride 6 was also observed to be a poor hydrogenolysis catalyst compared to 1:23,24 in fact, the initial rate for the hydrogenolysis of propane is ca. 5 times greater for 1 than for 6 (19 h1 and 4 h1 respectively)."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the process, linear and cyclic alkane transformations take place, with key intermediates including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes playing crucial roles. These factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The presence of zirconium (Zr) in the catalyst enhances the overall activity and lifetime of the tantalum hydride, although Zr itself does not participate in alkane metathesis. This system exhibits higher selectivity towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues, with an overall selectivity in ethane and butanes of 80%, and a low methane selectivity of only 10%. Additionally, the catalyst shows poor hydrogenolysis performance compared to silica-supported tantalum hydrides, with a significantly faster initial rate for the hydrogenolysis of propane.

催化作用由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物引发的烷烃环化机制包括双位点和单位点方案。在这个过程中，线性和环状烷烃的转换发生，关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷起着至关重要的作用。这些因素共同决定了各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能。锆的存在提高了钽氢化物的整体活性和寿命，尽管锆本身并不参与烷烃环化。该系统对Cn1和Cn+1同系物表现出更高的选择性，乙烷和丁烷的总选择性为80%，而甲烷的选择性仅为10%。此外，与二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物相比，该催化剂在丙烷氢解性能方面表现较差，丙烷的初始速率快约5倍。
