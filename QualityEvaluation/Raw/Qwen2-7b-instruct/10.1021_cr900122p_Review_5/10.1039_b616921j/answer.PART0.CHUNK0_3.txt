<p>The first well-defined catalyst was based on a silica supported tantalum(III) monohydride [(SiO2)TaH] (1),6 and more recently it was shown that alumina supported tungsten hydrides are in fact more efficient and more selective.</p>
<p>In the case of single component well-defined systems such as 1,structurereactivity relationships have shown that low coordina- tion electron-deficient metal centers are necessary, and that the addition of ancillary ligands is usually detrimental to catalytic performances.</p>
<p>Starting from a mixture of a mono-hydride [(SiO)3Zr(H)] (2a,70%) and di-hydride surface species [(SiO)2Zr(H)2] (2b, 30%),the corresponding silica-supported zirconium mono- and di- hydroxide surface species were obtained: [(SiO)3Zr(OH)] (3a,70%) and [(SiO)2Zr(OH)2] (3b, 30%); this mixture is referred to as</p>
<p>We report here the preparation, the characterization and the catalytic activity in alkane metathesis of a new generation of tantalum hydrides supported on this material.</p>
<p>Whether prepared by sublimation or impregnation, 30 mg of 5 was treated with a large excess of H2 in a 350 mL glass reactor (73 kPa), and the reaction mixture heated at 150 C for 12 h.</p>
<p>When [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] (4) was sublimed onto a self- supporting disk of [ZrOH] (3), the solid turned from white to orange.</p>
<p>Monitoring the reaction by infrared spectroscopy shows that most of the m(ZrOH) bands have disappeared with the concomitant appearance of intense m(CH) and d(CH2) bands,indicating that most of the hydroxyl groups have reacted with 4 to form (ZrOTa) bonds.</p>
<p>Note that the (SiH) groups coming from the synthesis of 2a and 2b, do not react during the grafting process (Fig. 1, spectra a and b).</p>
<p>Elemental analysis on the resulting solid {4/[ZrOH]} (5) shows a 3.25%wt, 3.70%wt and 2.80%wt of C, Ta and Zr, respectively, and analysis of the gas phase during grafting indicates the formation of 1.1 equiv. of 2,2-dimethylpropane (CH3tBu).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 1H solid-state NMR spectrum shows the presence of a peak at 0.8 ppm, attributed to CH2 of the neopentyl and the CH3 protons of both the neopentyl and the neopentylidene ligands, along with a peak at 4.4 ppm, which can be attributed to both a carbenic proton (=CH) and silane (SiH) groups10 still present at the surface (Fig. 2a).</p>
<p>Moreover, the minor species (ca. 5%), observed at 80 ppm slightly up-field to 5a,17 can probably arise from [(SiO)2Zr(OH){OTa(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2}] (5b), as a result from the reaction of [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] with [(SiO)2Zr(OH)2] (3b), the corresponding bis(zirconoxy) species 5c being very unlikely because of the strain involved in its formation.</p>
<p>During this process, methane (65%mol) and ethane (35%mol) are formed (14.5 C/Ta), and this comes from the hydrogenolysis of the neopentyl-like ligands and the cor- responding 2,2-dimethylpropane (2.9 equiv/Ta, expected 3 for structure 5a).</p>
<p>While the formation of a tantalum hydride (TaH) was expected (hydrogenolysis of the perhydrocarbyl ligands bound to tantalum as already observed for 1), the formation of zirconium hydride (Zr H) indicates that ZrO bonds were cleaved during the treatment under H2.</p>
<p>In conclusion, both IR and EXAFS data are consistent with the formation of 6a [(SiO)2Zr(H)OTa(H)x(OSi)] (x = 1 or 3) as the major species after treatment of {4/[ZrOH]} with H2.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity of the hydride 6 was compared with that of [(SiO)2Ta(H)] (1) in the metathesis of propane.</p>
<p>Therefore, the presence of Zr increases the overall activity and lifetime of the tantalum hydride, while ZrH itself is inactive in alkane metathesis.</p>
<p>The tantalum hydride 6 displays a catalytic property closer to the one observed for the alumina supported tungsten hydrides than for the silica or alumina supported tantalum hydrides:slower deactivation, higher TON, lower methane selectivity and higher Cn+1/Cn1 homologue selectivity.</p>
<p>Note that these mixed oxide systems do not contain ZrOH surface species, but only silanols. Therefore, the grafting of 4 onto these materials occured via the reaction of the silanols, and after treatment under H2,the corresponding tantalum hydride complexes were prepared:[TaH/{2SiO2ZrO2}] (7), [TaH/{4SiO2ZrO2}] (8) and [Ta H/{10SiO2ZrO2}] (9) (%wt Ta: 10, 9 and 14.7 respectively).</p>
<p>In the case of 8, this reaction was monitored by IR spectroscopy (see Fig. S3), and only TaH and SiH bands were observed in contrast to 6 (where ZrH bonds were formed) which is consistent with the formation of a [(SiO2)TaH] species.</p>
<p>In fact, in all cases (79), the TON obtained after 120 h in the metathesis of propane are close to that obtained for 1 (60): 56, 64 and 63 for 7, 8 and 9, respectively (see Fig. S4).</p>

The literature describes the preparation and characterization of silica-supported tantalum hydrides, particularly focusing on their catalytic activity in alkane metathesis. The process involves grafting of a tantalum trihydride onto a zirconium hydroxide-supported silica material, leading to the formation of new generations of tantalum hydrides with improved activity and selectivities compared to traditional silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The literature discusses the structural characteristics of these materials, including the formation of specific coordination spheres and the role of zirconium in enhancing catalytic properties. It also compares the performance of these materials with other catalysts, such as alumina-supported tungsten hydrides, in terms of turnover numbers (TON), reaction rates, and selectivity towards specific alkane homologues. Additionally, the document explores the preparation of mixed oxide supports (SiO2ZrO2) and their impact on the catalytic activity of the resulting tantalum hydrides, concluding that the presence of zirconium alone does not solely determine the enhanced activity observed in the silica-supported materials. The overall mechanism involves the coordination of tantalum with both silicon and oxygen atoms from the silica and zirconium hydroxide components, leading to the formation of active sites that facilitate alkane metathesis reactions efficiently.

文献详细描述了制备和表征了硅基支持的钽氢化物的过程，特别是在烷烃裂合中的催化活性。过程涉及到将钽三氢化物嫁接到以二氧化硅为基础的氧化锆材料上，从而形成了具有改进活性和选择性的新一代钽氢化物。文献讨论了这些材料的结构特征，包括形成特定配位球体以及氧化锆在增强催化剂性能中的作用。它还将这些材料的性能与其他催化剂（如氧化铝支持的钨氢化物）进行了比较，涉及每吨的周转数（TON）、反应速率和特定烷烃同系物的选择性。此外，该文档探索了混合氧化物支持（二氧化硅氧化锆）的制备及其对所得钽氢化物催化活性的影响，结论是仅氧化锆的存在并不完全决定观察到的硅基材料的增强活性。总体机制涉及钽与硅和氧化锆组件中的硅氧原子配位，导致形成促进烷烃裂合反应高效进行的活性位点。
