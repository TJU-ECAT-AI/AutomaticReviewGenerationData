[1] "We have previously shown that it was possible to generate high surface area material (190 m2 g−1) having a high concentration of surface zirconium hydroxides by reacting the silica-supported zirconium hydride [ZrH] with N2O (Scheme 1)."
[2] "We report here the preparation, the characterization and the catalytic activity in alkane metathesis of a new generation of tantalum hydrides supported on this material."
[3] "In the case of single component well-defined systems such as 1,structurereactivity relationships have shown that low coordina- tion electron-deficient metal centers are necessary, and that the addition of ancillary ligands is usually detrimental to catalytic performances."
[4] "Therefore, the presence of Zr increases the overall activity and lifetime of the tantalum hydride, while ZrH itself is inactive in alkane metathesis."
[5] "The presence of zirconium in the support is not the sole cause for higher activity. The requirement of a tetrahedral Zr imposed by the silica support is likely to be a very important parameter."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the roles of both two-site and one-site schemes, as well as the processes involved in both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in determining reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

Silica-supported tantalum hydrides can catalyze alkane metathesis efficiently, thanks to the presence of low coordination electron-deficient metal centers, which are essential for the structure-reactivity relationships observed in well-defined systems. The addition of ancillary ligands often hinders catalytic performance.

The presence of zirconium in the catalyst enhances the overall activity and longevity of the tantalum hydride, making it more effective in alkane metathesis reactions compared to systems without zirconium. However, the role of zirconium alone is not sufficient to explain the increased activity. The requirement for a tetrahedral arrangement of zirconium atoms within the silica support plays a critical role in achieving optimal catalytic performance.

The enhanced activity of the catalyst might stem from the synergistic effect of the zirconium and tantalum components, where the zirconium atoms facilitate the stabilization of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, promoting the desired alkane conversions. The catalyst's ability to efficiently convert linear and cyclic alkanes into their corresponding lower and higher homologues is influenced by the balance between the coordination environment provided by the silica support and the electronic properties of the metal centers.

The enhanced selectivity towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues in the presence of zirconium suggests that the catalyst can more effectively distinguish between different alkane structures, leading to a preference for specific alkane conversions. The catalyst's reduced methane selectivity and increased selectivity for longer chain alkanes indicate that the presence of zirconium can significantly alter the reaction pathway, favoring the formation of longer alkanes over shorter ones.

Overall, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves intricate interactions between the metal centers, the silica support, and the alkanes, leading to a combination of enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. The detailed understanding of these interactions is crucial for optimizing catalyst design and performance in alkane metathesis reactions.

催化由硅基支持的钽氢化物的烷烃异构化全面机制涉及理解两个位点和一个位点方案的作用，以及线性和环烷烃转化过程中的关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的作用。这些因素共同决定了反应选择性和催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能。

通过与N2O反应生成具有高表面区域（190 m2 g−1）和高表面锆氧基的高表面区域材料，我们之前展示了硅基支持的锆氢化物的可能性。这种新代的钽氢化物在该材料上进行制备、表征和烷烃异构化的催化活性。

在单一成分的定义系统中，如1，结构反应关系表明低配位的电子缺乏金属中心是必要的，并且辅助配体的添加通常对催化性能不利。

因此，锆的存在增加了钽氢化物的整体活动性和寿命，而锆氢本身在烷烃异构化中是无活性的。

锆的存在不是提高活性的唯一原因。由二氧化硅支持的锆原子的四面体排列可能是非常重要的参数。

增强活性可能源于锆和钽组件之间的协同作用，其中锆原子有助于稳定关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷），促进所需的烷烃转化。催化剂能够高效地将线性和环烷烃转化为其对应的较低和较高同系物受到二氧化硅支撑提供的配合环境和金属中心电子性质之间平衡的影响。

催化剂对Cn1和Cn+1同系物的增强选择性表明，它更有效地区分不同烷烃结构，导致特定烷烃转化的偏好。催化剂对甲烷选择性的降低和长链烷烃选择性的增加表明，锆的存在可以显著改变反应途径，优先形成较长的烷烃而不是较短的烷烃。

总的来说，由硅基支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃异构化机制涉及金属中心、二氧化硅支撑和烷烃之间复杂的相互作用，导致了增强的活性、选择性和稳定性。深入了解这些相互作用对于优化催化剂设计和烷烃异构化反应的性能至关重要。
