[1] "The catalytic activity of the hydride 6 was compared with that of [(SiO)2Ta(H)] (1) in the metathesis of propane."
[2] "Under similar conditions (970 equiv/Ta, 150 C, 5 d), 100 turnovers (TON) were obtained after 120 h, in place of 58 for 1."
[3] "This improvement is not due to a greater initial reaction rate, but to a slower deactivation, which manifests itself only after 20 h for 6 instead of 9."
[4] "Therefore, the presence of Zr increases the overall activity and lifetime of the tantalum hydride, while ZrH itself is inactive in alkane metathesis."
[5] "Noteworthy: this system is more selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues."
[6] "The hydride 6 was also observed to be a poor hydrogenolysis catalyst compared to 1."
[7] "The tantalum hydride 6 displays a catalytic property closer to the one observed for the alumina supported tungsten hydrides than for the silica or alumina supported tantalum hydrides."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. In the presence of zirconium, the activity and lifetime of the tantalum hydride are increased, making it more selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues in propane metathesis. However, the system exhibits poor hydrogenolysis catalyst properties compared to the silica-supported tantalum hydride. The presence of zirconium in the support does not solely account for the higher activity; the requirement of a tetrahedral zirconium imposed by the silica support plays a crucial role. The silica-supported tantalum hydride system shows catalytic properties similar to those of alumina-supported tungsten hydrides, but with slower deactivation and higher TON. The enhanced activity and selectivity are attributed to the formation of a unique coordination sphere involving tantalum, zirconium, and siloxane-like bridges.

催化作用的全面机制由硅基支撑的钽氢化物催化烷烃异构化涉及关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷的形成。在锆的存在下，钽氢化物的活性和寿命增加，使其对丙烷异构化中Cn1和Cn+1同系物更具有选择性。然而，该系统在氢解催化剂性能上表现不佳，与硅基支持的钽氢化物相比。在支撑物中添加锆不仅不能单独解释更高的活性；四面体型锆的要求由硅基支持所施加，对催化性能至关重要。硅基支持的钽氢化物体系显示出类似于氧化铝支持的钨氢化物的催化性质，但具有更慢的失活和更高的TON。增强的活性和选择性归因于形成独特的配合物球，包括钽、锆和硅氧烷桥。

[1] "We have previously shown that it was possible to generate high surface area material (190 m2 g−1) having a high concentration of surface zirconium hydroxides by reacting the silica-supported zirconium hydride [ZrH] with N2O (Scheme 1)."
[2] "We report here the preparation, the characterization and the catalytic activity in alkane metathesis of a new generation of tantalum hydrides supported on this material."
[3] "In the case of single component well-defined systems such as 1,structurereactivity relationships have shown that low coordina- tion electron-deficient metal centers are necessary, and that the addition of ancillary ligands is usually detrimental to catalytic performances."
[4] "Therefore, the presence of Zr increases the overall activity and lifetime of the tantalum hydride, while ZrH itself is inactive in alkane metathesis."
[5] "The presence of zirconium in the support is not the sole cause for higher activity. The requirement of a tetrahedral Zr imposed by the silica support is likely to be a very important parameter."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the roles of both two-site and one-site schemes, as well as the processes involved in both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in determining reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

Silica-supported tantalum hydrides can catalyze alkane metathesis efficiently, thanks to the presence of low coordination electron-deficient metal centers, which are essential for the structure-reactivity relationships observed in well-defined systems. The addition of ancillary ligands often hinders catalytic performance.

The presence of zirconium in the catalyst enhances the overall activity and longevity of the tantalum hydride, making it more effective in alkane metathesis reactions compared to systems without zirconium. However, the role of zirconium alone is not sufficient to explain the increased activity. The requirement for a tetrahedral arrangement of zirconium atoms within the silica support plays a critical role in achieving optimal catalytic performance.

The enhanced activity of the catalyst might stem from the synergistic effect of the zirconium and tantalum components, where the zirconium atoms facilitate the stabilization of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, promoting the desired alkane conversions. The catalyst's ability to efficiently convert linear and cyclic alkanes into their corresponding lower and higher homologues is influenced by the balance between the coordination environment provided by the silica support and the electronic properties of the metal centers.

The enhanced selectivity towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues in the presence of zirconium suggests that the catalyst can more effectively distinguish between different alkane structures, leading to a preference for specific alkane conversions. The catalyst's reduced methane selectivity and increased selectivity for longer chain alkanes indicate that the presence of zirconium can significantly alter the reaction pathway, favoring the formation of longer alkanes over shorter ones.

Overall, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves intricate interactions between the metal centers, the silica support, and the alkanes, leading to a combination of enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. The detailed understanding of these interactions is crucial for optimizing catalyst design and performance in alkane metathesis reactions.

催化由硅基支持的钽氢化物的烷烃异构化全面机制涉及理解两个位点和一个位点方案的作用，以及线性和环烷烃转化过程中的关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的作用。这些因素共同决定了反应选择性和催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能。

通过与N2O反应生成具有高表面区域（190 m2 g−1）和高表面锆氧基的高表面区域材料，我们之前展示了硅基支持的锆氢化物的可能性。这种新代的钽氢化物在该材料上进行制备、表征和烷烃异构化的催化活性。

在单一成分的定义系统中，如1，结构反应关系表明低配位的电子缺乏金属中心是必要的，并且辅助配体的添加通常对催化性能不利。

因此，锆的存在增加了钽氢化物的整体活动性和寿命，而锆氢本身在烷烃异构化中是无活性的。

锆的存在不是提高活性的唯一原因。由二氧化硅支持的锆原子的四面体排列可能是非常重要的参数。

增强活性可能源于锆和钽组件之间的协同作用，其中锆原子有助于稳定关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷），促进所需的烷烃转化。催化剂能够高效地将线性和环烷烃转化为其对应的较低和较高同系物受到二氧化硅支撑提供的配合环境和金属中心电子性质之间平衡的影响。

催化剂对Cn1和Cn+1同系物的增强选择性表明，它更有效地区分不同烷烃结构，导致特定烷烃转化的偏好。催化剂对甲烷选择性的降低和长链烷烃选择性的增加表明，锆的存在可以显著改变反应途径，优先形成较长的烷烃而不是较短的烷烃。

总的来说，由硅基支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃异构化机制涉及金属中心、二氧化硅支撑和烷烃之间复杂的相互作用，导致了增强的活性、选择性和稳定性。深入了解这些相互作用对于优化催化剂设计和烷烃异构化反应的性能至关重要。

<p>The first well-defined catalyst was based on a silica supported tantalum(III) monohydride [(SiO2)TaH] (1),6 and more recently it was shown that alumina supported tungsten hydrides are in fact more efficient and more selective.</p>
<p>In the case of single component well-defined systems such as 1,structurereactivity relationships have shown that low coordina- tion electron-deficient metal centers are necessary, and that the addition of ancillary ligands is usually detrimental to catalytic performances.</p>
<p>Starting from a mixture of a mono-hydride [(SiO)3Zr(H)] (2a,70%) and di-hydride surface species [(SiO)2Zr(H)2] (2b, 30%),the corresponding silica-supported zirconium mono- and di- hydroxide surface species were obtained: [(SiO)3Zr(OH)] (3a,70%) and [(SiO)2Zr(OH)2] (3b, 30%); this mixture is referred to as</p>
<p>We report here the preparation, the characterization and the catalytic activity in alkane metathesis of a new generation of tantalum hydrides supported on this material.</p>
<p>Whether prepared by sublimation or impregnation, 30 mg of 5 was treated with a large excess of H2 in a 350 mL glass reactor (73 kPa), and the reaction mixture heated at 150 C for 12 h.</p>
<p>When [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] (4) was sublimed onto a self- supporting disk of [ZrOH] (3), the solid turned from white to orange.</p>
<p>Monitoring the reaction by infrared spectroscopy shows that most of the m(ZrOH) bands have disappeared with the concomitant appearance of intense m(CH) and d(CH2) bands,indicating that most of the hydroxyl groups have reacted with 4 to form (ZrOTa) bonds.</p>
<p>Note that the (SiH) groups coming from the synthesis of 2a and 2b, do not react during the grafting process (Fig. 1, spectra a and b).</p>
<p>Elemental analysis on the resulting solid {4/[ZrOH]} (5) shows a 3.25%wt, 3.70%wt and 2.80%wt of C, Ta and Zr, respectively, and analysis of the gas phase during grafting indicates the formation of 1.1 equiv. of 2,2-dimethylpropane (CH3tBu).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 1H solid-state NMR spectrum shows the presence of a peak at 0.8 ppm, attributed to CH2 of the neopentyl and the CH3 protons of both the neopentyl and the neopentylidene ligands, along with a peak at 4.4 ppm, which can be attributed to both a carbenic proton (=CH) and silane (SiH) groups10 still present at the surface (Fig. 2a).</p>
<p>Moreover, the minor species (ca. 5%), observed at 80 ppm slightly up-field to 5a,17 can probably arise from [(SiO)2Zr(OH){OTa(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2}] (5b), as a result from the reaction of [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] with [(SiO)2Zr(OH)2] (3b), the corresponding bis(zirconoxy) species 5c being very unlikely because of the strain involved in its formation.</p>
<p>During this process, methane (65%mol) and ethane (35%mol) are formed (14.5 C/Ta), and this comes from the hydrogenolysis of the neopentyl-like ligands and the cor- responding 2,2-dimethylpropane (2.9 equiv/Ta, expected 3 for structure 5a).</p>
<p>While the formation of a tantalum hydride (TaH) was expected (hydrogenolysis of the perhydrocarbyl ligands bound to tantalum as already observed for 1), the formation of zirconium hydride (Zr H) indicates that ZrO bonds were cleaved during the treatment under H2.</p>
<p>In conclusion, both IR and EXAFS data are consistent with the formation of 6a [(SiO)2Zr(H)OTa(H)x(OSi)] (x = 1 or 3) as the major species after treatment of {4/[ZrOH]} with H2.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity of the hydride 6 was compared with that of [(SiO)2Ta(H)] (1) in the metathesis of propane.</p>
<p>Therefore, the presence of Zr increases the overall activity and lifetime of the tantalum hydride, while ZrH itself is inactive in alkane metathesis.</p>
<p>The tantalum hydride 6 displays a catalytic property closer to the one observed for the alumina supported tungsten hydrides than for the silica or alumina supported tantalum hydrides:slower deactivation, higher TON, lower methane selectivity and higher Cn+1/Cn1 homologue selectivity.</p>
<p>Note that these mixed oxide systems do not contain ZrOH surface species, but only silanols. Therefore, the grafting of 4 onto these materials occured via the reaction of the silanols, and after treatment under H2,the corresponding tantalum hydride complexes were prepared:[TaH/{2SiO2ZrO2}] (7), [TaH/{4SiO2ZrO2}] (8) and [Ta H/{10SiO2ZrO2}] (9) (%wt Ta: 10, 9 and 14.7 respectively).</p>
<p>In the case of 8, this reaction was monitored by IR spectroscopy (see Fig. S3), and only TaH and SiH bands were observed in contrast to 6 (where ZrH bonds were formed) which is consistent with the formation of a [(SiO2)TaH] species.</p>
<p>In fact, in all cases (79), the TON obtained after 120 h in the metathesis of propane are close to that obtained for 1 (60): 56, 64 and 63 for 7, 8 and 9, respectively (see Fig. S4).</p>

The literature describes the preparation and characterization of silica-supported tantalum hydrides, particularly focusing on their catalytic activity in alkane metathesis. The process involves grafting of a tantalum trihydride onto a zirconium hydroxide-supported silica material, leading to the formation of new generations of tantalum hydrides with improved activity and selectivities compared to traditional silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The literature discusses the structural characteristics of these materials, including the formation of specific coordination spheres and the role of zirconium in enhancing catalytic properties. It also compares the performance of these materials with other catalysts, such as alumina-supported tungsten hydrides, in terms of turnover numbers (TON), reaction rates, and selectivity towards specific alkane homologues. Additionally, the document explores the preparation of mixed oxide supports (SiO2ZrO2) and their impact on the catalytic activity of the resulting tantalum hydrides, concluding that the presence of zirconium alone does not solely determine the enhanced activity observed in the silica-supported materials. The overall mechanism involves the coordination of tantalum with both silicon and oxygen atoms from the silica and zirconium hydroxide components, leading to the formation of active sites that facilitate alkane metathesis reactions efficiently.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In linear alkane transformations, the mechanism typically includes the formation of alkenes as intermediates, which then undergo rearrangement to produce the desired alkane products. For cyclic alkane transformations, the process might involve the formation of metallacyclobutanes, which subsequently undergo ring opening and insertion to yield the desired cyclic alkane products. Key intermediates in these reactions include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The presence of zirconium in the catalyst system enhances the activity and lifetime of the tantalum hydride, leading to better selectivity towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues. Specifically, the catalytic system is more selective towards ethane and butanes, with an overall selectivity of 80%, compared to 70% for methane, demonstrating improved performance over traditional silica-supported tantalum hydrides.
