[1] "The catalytic activity of the hydride 6 was compared with that of [(SiO)2Ta(H)] (1) in the metathesis of propane."
[2] "Under similar conditions (970 equiv/Ta, 150 C, 5 d), 100 turnovers (TON) were obtained after 120 h, in place of 58 for 1."
[3] "This improvement is not due to a greater initial reaction rate, but to a slower deactivation, which manifests itself only after 20 h for 6 instead of 9."
[4] "Therefore, the presence of Zr increases the overall activity and lifetime of the tantalum hydride, while ZrH itself is inactive in alkane metathesis."
[5] "Noteworthy: this system is more selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues."
[6] "The hydride 6 was also observed to be a poor hydrogenolysis catalyst compared to 1."
[7] "The tantalum hydride 6 displays a catalytic property closer to the one observed for the alumina supported tungsten hydrides than for the silica or alumina supported tantalum hydrides."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. In the presence of zirconium, the activity and lifetime of the tantalum hydride are increased, making it more selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues in propane metathesis. However, the system exhibits poor hydrogenolysis catalyst properties compared to the silica-supported tantalum hydride. The presence of zirconium in the support does not solely account for the higher activity; the requirement of a tetrahedral zirconium imposed by the silica support plays a crucial role. The silica-supported tantalum hydride system shows catalytic properties similar to those of alumina-supported tungsten hydrides, but with slower deactivation and higher TON. The enhanced activity and selectivity are attributed to the formation of a unique coordination sphere involving tantalum, zirconium, and siloxane-like bridges.

催化作用的全面机制由硅基支撑的钽氢化物催化烷烃异构化涉及关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷的形成。在锆的存在下，钽氢化物的活性和寿命增加，使其对丙烷异构化中Cn1和Cn+1同系物更具有选择性。然而，该系统在氢解催化剂性能上表现不佳，与硅基支持的钽氢化物相比。在支撑物中添加锆不仅不能单独解释更高的活性；四面体型锆的要求由硅基支持所施加，对催化性能至关重要。硅基支持的钽氢化物体系显示出类似于氧化铝支持的钨氢化物的催化性质，但具有更慢的失活和更高的TON。增强的活性和选择性归因于形成独特的配合物球，包括钽、锆和硅氧烷桥。
