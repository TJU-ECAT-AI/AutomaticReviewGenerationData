[1] "The catalytic activity of the hydride 6 was compared with that of [(SiO)2Ta(H)] (1) in the metathesis of propane."
[2] "Under similar conditions (970 equiv/Ta, 150 C, 5 d), 100 turnovers (TON) were obtained after 120 h, in place of 58 for 1 (Fig. 4a)."
[3] "Therefore, the presence of Zr increases the overall activity and lifetime of the tantalum hydride, while ZrH itself is inactive in alkane metathesis."
[4] "Noteworthy: this system is more selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues (Fig. 4b): the overall selectivity in ethane and butanes is 80% and that of methane is only 10% for 6, in contrast to 1, for which they are 70 and 20%, respectively."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In linear alkane transformations, the mechanism typically includes the formation of alkenes as intermediates, which then undergo rearrangement to produce the desired alkane products. For cyclic alkane transformations, the process might involve the formation of metallacyclobutanes, which subsequently undergo ring opening and insertion to yield the desired cyclic alkane products. Key intermediates in these reactions include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The presence of zirconium in the catalyst system enhances the activity and lifetime of the tantalum hydride, leading to better selectivity towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues. Specifically, the catalytic system is more selective towards ethane and butanes, with an overall selectivity of 80%, compared to 70% for methane, demonstrating improved performance over traditional silica-supported tantalum hydrides.

催化机理涉及到双位点和单位点方案。在烷烃的线性转换中，机制通常包括烯烃中间体的形成，然后进行重组以产生所需烷烃产物。对于环烷烃转换，过程可能涉及形成金属环丁烷，随后通过开环和插入来生成所需的环烷烃产物。这些反应中的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们在确定反应选择性和催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。锆的存在提高了钽氢化物的活性和寿命，从而提高了对Cn1和Cn+1同系物的选择性。具体而言，催化体系对乙烷和丁烷的选区更高，整体选区为80%，与甲烷相比为70%，显示了相对于传统二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的改进性能。
