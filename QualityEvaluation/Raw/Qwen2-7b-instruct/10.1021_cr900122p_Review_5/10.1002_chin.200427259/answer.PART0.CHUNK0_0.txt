Since the provided document does not contain specific information about the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, including details on two-site and one-site schemes, linear and cyclic alkane transformations, formation and role of key intermediates, and their contribution to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions, it is not possible to answer the question based on the content provided. The document seems to be unrelated to the topic of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides.
