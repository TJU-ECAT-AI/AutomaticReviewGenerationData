[1] "Evidence with Re(PPh3)2H7,35 CpRe(PMe3)3,25Cid and Fe- all indicates that a direct oxidative addition pathway exists in addition to a-coordination."
[2] "Furthermore, reductive elimination of the vinyl hydride can also lead directly to the a-olefin complex."
[3] "It is also interesting to note that the microscopic reverse of this sequence implies that olefin dissociation from the metal also can occur by two pathways, one of which involves intramolecular vinylic activation followed by reductive elimination of free olefin!"
[4] "The factors controlling intramolecular activation of the C-H bond of a ligand remains poorly understood in a general sense."
[5] "It may be that relief of steric compression is the driving force for metalation of the PMe3 ligand, a force that is not so important in the [ (C5Me5)M(PMe3)] intermediates."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In this context, linear and cyclic alkane transformations are facilitated through the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The process typically begins with the oxidative addition of the alkane to the metal center, followed by the reductive elimination step to yield the desired olefin product. This pathway is complemented by a-coordination, where the alkene directly binds to the metal. The mechanism further suggests that olefin dissociation from the metal can occur via two pathways, one involving intramolecular vinylic activation and subsequent reductive elimination of the free olefin. The factors controlling the intramolecular activation of the C-H bond of a ligand remain poorly understood, particularly the driving forces behind the metalation of the PMe3 ligand in different complexes. Relief of steric compression is hypothesized to be a significant factor influencing the metalation process, although its importance varies across different complexes.

催化硅支持钽氢的烷烃裂解的全面机制包括两站点和单站点方案。在此背景下，线性和环烷烃转换通过形成关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）得以实现。过程通常始于烷烃与金属中心的氧化添加，随后是还原消除步骤以产生所需的烯烃产物。该路径补充了一种直接的a-配合物形成途径，其中烯烃直接与金属结合。机制还表明，从金属中脱除烯烃可以以两种方式发生，一种涉及分子内烯基激活和随后的自由烯烃还原消除。因素控制分子内C-H键活性的机制在一般意义上仍然未知，特别是PMe3配体的金属化动力学，特别是在不同复合物中的重要性。推测立体压缩的缓解是影响金属化过程的关键因素，尽管在不同复合物中其重要性有所不同。
