[1] "There must be two independent pathways for forming an olefin complex from free olefin and a co-ordinatively unsaturated metal: (1) direct α-complexation and (2) vinylic oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination."
[2] "It is also interesting to note that the microscopic reverse of this sequence implies that olefin dissociation from the metal also can occur by two pathways, one of which involves intramolecular vinylic activation followed by reductive elimination of free olefin!"

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two primary pathways. First, direct α-complexation forms the olefin complex. Second, vinylic oxidative addition is followed by intramolecular reductive elimination. This dual pathway allows for efficient conversion of both linear and cyclic alkanes. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play crucial roles in facilitating these reactions. The factors influencing reaction selectivity and catalyst performance include the balance between these pathways, the stability of the catalyst, and the ability to activate and deactivate the alkane substrates effectively. The mechanism elucidates the importance of the catalyst's structure and its interaction with the alkane molecules during the transformation process.
