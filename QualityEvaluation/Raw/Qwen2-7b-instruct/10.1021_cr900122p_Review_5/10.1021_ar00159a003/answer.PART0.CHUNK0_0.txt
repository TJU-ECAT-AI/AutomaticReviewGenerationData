[1] "Evidence with Re(PPh3)2H7,35 CpRe(PMe3)3,25Cid and Fe- all indicates that a direct oxidative addition pathway exists in addition to a-coordination."
[2] "Furthermore, reductive elimination of the vinyl hydride can also lead directly to the a-olefin complex."
[3] "It is also interesting to note that the microscopic reverse of this sequence implies that olefin dissociation from the metal also can occur by two pathways, one of which involves intramolecular vinylic activation followed by reductive elimination of free olefin!"
[4] "Finally, the factors controlling intramolecular activation of the C-H bond of a ligand remains poorly understood in a general sense."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. The two-site scheme typically refers to the simultaneous activation of two alkyl groups, while the one-site scheme involves sequential activation of alkyl groups. In the context of silica-supported tantalum hydrides, the mechanisms involve the formation of alkenes through oxidative addition and subsequent reductive elimination steps. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in facilitating the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes. The factors contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance include the precise control over the formation and stability of these intermediates, as well as the ability of the catalyst to efficiently activate and deactivate alkyl groups.

The factors controlling intramolecular activation of the C-H bond of a ligand remain poorly understood in a general sense. This includes the reasons behind certain species undergoing cyclometalation while others do not. Relief of steric compression might be a driving force for metalation of the PMe3 ligand, although this force may not be as significant in [ (C5Me5)M(PMe3)] intermediates due to their structure. The balance between phosphine metalation and intermolecular hydrocarbon activation in the more crowded [ (C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2] intermediate suggests a dynamic equilibrium that influences its reactivity and stability.

对于由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃互换机制的全面分析涉及理解双位点和单位点方案。双位点方案通常指的是同时激活两个烷基团，而单位点方案则涉及依次激活烷基团。在二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的背景下，机制涉及到通过氧化添加和随后的还原消除步骤形成烯烃。关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，对线性和环烷烃的转换起着至关重要的作用。反应选择性和催化剂性能的贡献因素包括对这些中间体形成和稳定性的精确控制，以及催化剂有效激活和脱活烷基团的能力。

控制配体中C-H键的内分子激活的因素在一般意义上仍然不太清楚。这包括某些物种进行环金属化而其他物种不进行的原因。可能使PMe3配体金属化的力量可能是缓解立体压缩，尽管这种力量在[C5Me5]M(PMe3)中间体中可能不如其结构中的动力大。在更拥挤的[(C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2]中间体中，磷烷金属化与分子间烃活性之间的平衡表明了一种动态平衡，这影响其反应性和稳定性。
