[1] "Furthermore, reductive elimination of the vinyl hydride can also lead directly to the a-olefin complex."
[2] "Consequently, there must be two independent pathways for forming an olefin complex from free olefin and a coordinatively unsaturated metal: (1) direct α-complexation and (2) vinylic oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination."
[3] "It is still not clear why species such as [Fe(PMe3),]37 and [ (C5Me5)Re-(PMe3)2]23C undergo cyclometalation whereas [ (C5Me5)Rh(PMe3)] and [ (C5Me5)Ir(PMe3)] do not."
[4] "It may be that relief of steric compression is the driving force for metalation of the PMe3 ligand, a force that is not so important in the [ (C5Me5)M(PMe3)] intermediates."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism includes two independent pathways for forming an olefin complex from free olefin and a coordinatively unsaturated metal. These pathways are:
1. Direct α-complexation, where the olefin directly binds to the metal center.
2. Vinyl oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination, leading to the formation of an a-olefin complex.

The factors controlling intramolecular activation of the C-H bond of a ligand remain poorly understood. For instance, it is unclear why certain species undergo cyclometalation while others do not, potentially due to the relief of steric compression being a driving force for metalation of the PMe3 ligand.

Steric considerations play a crucial role in determining whether a catalyst will undergo metalation of the PMe3 ligand or if it will facilitate intermolecular hydrocarbon activation. The more crowded intermediate, like [ (C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2], appears to balance both phosphine metalation and intermolecular hydrocarbon activation.

Further elucidation of these important side reactions is warranted to enhance our understanding of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides and improve catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

烷烃均裂由硅负载钽氢化物催化时的全面机制分析涉及理解两种站点和单站点方案，线性和环烷烃转化过程中的过程，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其作用，以及这些因素如何共同促进反应选择性和在各种烷烃转换中催化剂性能。

机制包括两种独立途径，用于从自由烷烃和配位不饱和金属形成烯烃复合物。这些途径是：
1. 直接α结合，烷烃直接与金属中心结合。
2. 乙烯基氧化加成后进行分子内还原消除，导致a-烯烃复合物的形成。

控制配位碳氢键的微观激活的因素仍然不清楚。例如，不清楚为什么某些物种会进行环金属化而其他物种不会，可能是因为立体压缩释放是金属化PMe3配体的动力。

立体考虑在确定催化剂是否进行PMe3配体金属化或促进分子间烃基激活方面起着关键作用。更拥挤的中间体，如[(C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2]，似乎在磷配体金属化和分子间烃基激活之间达到平衡。

需要进一步阐明这些重要副反应，以增强我们对由硅负载钽氢化物催化烷烃均裂的理解，并提高各种烷烃转换中催化剂的性能。
