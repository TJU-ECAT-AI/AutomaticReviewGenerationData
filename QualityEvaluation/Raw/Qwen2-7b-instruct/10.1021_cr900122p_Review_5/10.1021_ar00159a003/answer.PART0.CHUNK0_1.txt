[1] "There must be two independent pathways for forming an olefin complex from free olefin and a co-ordinatively unsaturated metal: (1) direct α-complexation and (2) vinylic oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination."
[2] "It is also interesting to note that the microscopic reverse of this sequence implies that olefin dissociation from the metal also can occur by two pathways, one of which involves intramolecular vinylic activation followed by reductive elimination of free olefin!"

There are two independent pathways for forming an olefin complex from free olefin and a co-ordinatively unsaturated metal. These pathways include direct α-complexation and vinylic oxidative addition followed by intramolecular reductive elimination. The reverse sequence suggests that olefin dissociation from the metal can occur through two pathways as well, one involving intramolecular vinylic activation followed by reductive elimination of free olefin.

形成自由烯烃和配合不饱和金属的烯烃复合物有两条独立途径。这些途径包括直接α配位和乙烯基氧化加成后进行分子内还原消除。序列的微观反向表明，烯烃从金属的解离也可以通过两条途径发生，其中一个涉及分子内乙烯基活化随后是自由烯烃的还原消除。
