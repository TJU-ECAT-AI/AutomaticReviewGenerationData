<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes, facilitating both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in the process. These factors contribute significantly to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.
