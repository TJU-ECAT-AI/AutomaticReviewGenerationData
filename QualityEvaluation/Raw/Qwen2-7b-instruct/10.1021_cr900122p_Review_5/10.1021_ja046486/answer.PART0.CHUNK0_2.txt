The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the grafting of [Ta(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] and [Cp*TaMe4] on partially dehydroxylated silica. The study focused on the activity of these grafted complexes towards alkane metathesis, examining the mechanisms involved in both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, notably alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, were identified as playing significant roles in the reactions. These factors, including the formation and role of intermediates, contributed to the reaction selectivity and overall performance of the catalysts in various alkane conversions.
