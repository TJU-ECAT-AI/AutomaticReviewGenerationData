The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves detailed structural investigation of the grafting of [Ta(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] and [Cp*TaMe4] on partially dehydroxylated silica. This process is characterized by both two-site and one-site schemes, leading to linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play significant roles in the formation and overall process. These factors contribute to the reaction selectivity and the performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
