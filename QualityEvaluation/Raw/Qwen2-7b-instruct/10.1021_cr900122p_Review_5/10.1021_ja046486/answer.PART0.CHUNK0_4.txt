The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. This process facilitates linear and cyclic alkane transformations, driven by the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These factors significantly contribute to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance during various alkane conversions.
