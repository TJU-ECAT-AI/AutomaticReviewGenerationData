[1] "Silica-supported tantalum hydrides also catalyze the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues."
[2] "This reaction, named alkane metathesis,13 involves carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates,14,15"
[3] "We therefore propose that the active species is a zirconium dihydride complex and that the mechanism of formation of the products involves the following elementary steps (Scheme2):"
[4] "First, zirconium hydrides supported on silica and silicaalumina, respectively, are two different surface species, [(SiO)3ZrH] and [(SiO)2ZrH2] (Supporting Information, FigureS5),"
