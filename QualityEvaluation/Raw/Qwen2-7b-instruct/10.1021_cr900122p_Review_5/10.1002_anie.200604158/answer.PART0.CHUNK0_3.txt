[1] "Under similar conditions, alkanes, including ethane, are transformed into their lower homologues in the presence of a catalytic amount of silica-supported tantalum hydride."
[2] "Cleavage of the carboncarbon bond is different for both catalysts (Group4 vs. Group5): β-alkyl transfer for d0zirconium catalysts versus α-alkyl transfer for d2tantalum catalysts so that hydrogenolysis of a CC bond in the skeleton of an alkane occurs by removal of one carbon atom at a time for tantalum catalysts and of at least two carbon atoms for zirconium catalysts, hence the difference in the selectivity of the final product."
[3] "We have exploited the specific properties of Zr, which is able to 1)activate CH bonds of alkanes through σ-bond metathesis, 2)carry out hydrogenolysis (the transfer of at least two carbon atoms through β-alkyl transfer), and 3)polymerize olefins by insertion."
[4] "In the case of the zirconium catalysts, this mechanism cannot explain the product distribution obtained. We therefore propose that the active species is a zirconium dihydride complex and that the mechanism of formation of the products involves the following elementary steps (Scheme2): σ-bond metathesis (CH activation and hydrogenolysis);11,21,22 β-H and β-alkyl transfer11,21 associated with intramolecular hydride transfer;23 olefin insertion in the remaining alkyl chain leading to higher olefins (through β-H transfer) and alkanes (hydrogenolysis).11,21,22"
[5] "First, zirconium hydrides supported on silica and silicaalumina, respectively, are two different surface species, [(SiO)3ZrH] and [(SiO)2ZrH2] (Supporting Information, FigureS5),24 and CH activation is faster on the more electrophilic dihydride species."

Answer: 

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two-site and one-site schemes. The two-site scheme involves the activation of both ends of the alkane molecule by the catalyst, resulting in the cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond and the rearrangement of the alkyl groups to form shorter alkane chains. In contrast, the one-site scheme involves the activation of only one end of the alkane molecule, leading to the cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond and the formation of alkenes. These alkenes then undergo further reactions to form shorter alkane chains.

Linear alkane transformations occur primarily through the β-alkyl transfer mechanism, where the catalyst transfers an alkyl group from one carbon atom to another, resulting in the formation of shorter alkane chains. For cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism involves the formation of alkenes as intermediates, followed by the rearrangement of the alkyl groups to form shorter cyclic alkane chains.

Key intermediates in the alkane metathesis reaction include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Alkenes are formed during the cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond, while metallacyclobutanes are formed through the rearrangement of the alkyl groups. The formation and role of these intermediates contribute significantly to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance.

The reaction selectivity is influenced by the type of catalyst used. Silica-supported tantalum hydride catalysts favor the formation of linear higher homologues due to the α-alkyl transfer mechanism. On the other hand, silica-supported zirconium hydride catalysts favor the formation of branched higher homologues due to the β-alkyl transfer mechanism.

In conclusion, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the activation of both ends of the alkane molecule, leading to the cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond and the rearrangement of the alkyl groups to form shorter alkane chains. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance.

该文献中对二氧化硅负载钽氢化物催化烷基交换的全面机制涉及双位点和单位点方案。双位点方案通过催化剂激活烷烃分子两端，导致碳-碳键断裂和烷基团重组形成较短的烷烃链。相反，单位点方案仅激活烷烃分子的一端，导致碳-碳键断裂和烯烃形成。这些烯烃随后进一步反应形成较短的烷烃链。

线性烷烃转换主要通过β-烷基转移机制进行，其中催化剂将一个碳原子上的烷基团转移到另一个碳原子上，从而形成较短的烷烃链。对于环状烷烃转换，机制涉及形成烯烃作为中间体，随后烷基团的重排形成较短的环烷烃链。

烷基交换反应中的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。在断裂碳-碳键期间形成烯烃，而通过烷基团的重排形成环状烷烃。这些中间体的形成和作用对反应选择性和催化剂性能起着重要作用。

反应选择性受所用催化剂类型的影响。二氧化硅负载钽氢化物催化剂倾向于形成线性更高同系物，由于α-烷基转移机制。另一方面，二氧化硅负载锆氢化物催化剂倾向于形成支链更高同系物，由于β-烷基转移机制。

综上所述，二氧化硅负载钽氢化物催化烷基交换的全面机制涉及激活烷烃分子两端，导致碳-碳键断裂和烷基团重排形成较短烷烃链。关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷在确定反应选择性和催化剂性能方面起着重要作用。
