Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

Alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues, utilizing carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates. Tantalum hydrides exploit the ability of zirconium (Zr) to activate CH bonds of alkanes through σ-bond metathesis, carry out hydrogenolysis (transfer of at least two carbon atoms through β-alkyl transfer), and polymerize olefins by insertion. The study of the reaction in a flow reactor identified primary products by examining the effect of inverse space velocity on product selectivity. The alkane metathesis process with tantalum-based catalysts typically results in the formation of mainly linear olefins, contrasting with the branched olefins produced by the zirconium catalysts. Ethene and propene can be readily formed through primary processes involving β-H and β-Me transfer on the Zrpropyl propagating species, contributing to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions.
