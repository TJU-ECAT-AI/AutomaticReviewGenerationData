[1] "Under similar conditions, alkanes, including ethane, are transformed into their lower homologues in the presence of a catalytic amount of silica-supported tantalum hydride."
[2] "This reaction, named alkane metathesis,13 involves carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates,14,15 and it explains the selective formation of the directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane through the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, thereby preventing the formation of long-chain alkanes."
[3] "Notably, the major product was 2-methylpropane (20.7%), and overall branched higher homologues up to C10 are favored, and particularly the isohomologues, except for pentanes."
[4] "Additionally, when zirconium hydride supported on silica is used, similar selectivities are obtained: 23% (methane); 39% (ethane); 17% (isobutane); 6.9% (butane); 2.2% (isopentane); 2.4% (pentane); 3.6% (homologues with at least six carbon atoms)."
[5] "We therefore propose that the active species is a zirconium dihydride complex and that the mechanism of formation of the products involves the following elementary steps (Scheme2): σ-bond metathesis (CH activation and hydrogenolysis);11,21,22 β-H and β-alkyl transfer11,21 associated with intramolecular hydride transfer;23 olefin insertion in the remaining alkyl chain leading to higher olefins (through β-H transfer) and alkanes (hydrogenolysis).11,21,22"

Answer: 
The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the transformation of alkanes into their directly lower and higher linear homologues through a series of steps. This process includes the formation of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, which facilitate the selective formation of the desired alkane products. Specifically, one carbon atom at a time is transferred during the reaction, preventing the creation of long-chain alkanes. The major product often consists of branched higher homologues, with a notable preference for isohomologues, except for pentanes. When zirconium hydride supported on silica is utilized, similar selectivities are observed, with products primarily consisting of methane, ethane, isobutane, butane, isopentane, pentane, and homologues with at least six carbon atoms. The proposed mechanism for the formation of these products involves σ-bond metathesis, β-H and β-alkyl transfer, and intramolecular hydride transfer, leading to the production of higher olefins and alkanes through olefin insertion into the remaining alkyl chain.

催化二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的烷烃裂合全面机制涉及将烷烃转化为直接的较低和较高线性同系物的过程。这一过程包括形成碳烯和金属环丁烷中间体，这些中间体促进所需烷烃产物的选择性形成。具体而言，在反应过程中，一个碳原子一次被转移，从而阻止长链烷烃的生成。主要产物通常由支链较高同系物组成，尤其是对异构体有明显偏好，除了戊烷。当使用二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物时，观察到相似的选择性，产物主要由甲烷、乙烷、异丁烷、丁烷、异戊烷、戊烷以及至少六个碳原子的同系物组成。提出的产物形成机制包括σ键断裂、β-H和β-烷基转移以及分子内氢转移，导致通过β-H插入生成更高烯烃和烷烃，然后是剩余烷基链中的烷基链。
