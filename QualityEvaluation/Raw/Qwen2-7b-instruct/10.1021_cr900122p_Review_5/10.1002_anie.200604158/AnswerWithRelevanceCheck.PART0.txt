          [1] "Under supercritical conditions and at moderate temperatures, propane is transformed into higher-branched homologues in the presence of a zirconiumdihydride catalyst supported on an oxide material such as silica."
          [2] "Products are formed by a reaction similar to ZieglerNatta olefin polymerization."
          [3] "Alkanes, including ethane, are transformed into their lower homologues in the presence of a catalytic amount of silica-supported tantalum hydride."
          [4] "Cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond is different for both catalysts (Group4 vs. Group5): β-alkyl transfer for d0zirconium catalysts versus α-alkyl transfer for d2tantalum catalysts so that hydrogenolysis of a CC bond in the skeleton of an alkane occurs by removal of one carbon atom at a time for tantalum catalysts and of at least two carbon atoms for zirconium catalysts, hence the difference in the selectivity of the final product."
          [5] "Silica-supported tantalum hydrides also catalyze the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This reaction, named alkane metathesis, involves carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, and it explains the selective formation of the directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane through the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, thereby preventing the formation of long-chain alkanes."
          [6] "We have exploited the specific properties of Zr, which is able to 1)activate CH bonds of alkanes through σ-bond metathesis, 2)carry out hydrogenolysis (the transfer of at least two carbon atoms through β-alkyl transfer), and 3)polymerize olefins by insertion."
          [7] "First, using a constant flow of propane (600kPa, 3NmL) at 216C, we observed the formation of H2, methane, and ethane, which resulted from the CH bond activation of propane, and its subsequent hydrogenolysis."
          [8] "The product selectivities in alkane metathesis are associated with the formation of the products by the carbene-olefin mechanism of Chauvin and Hrisson, which explains the high selectivity for Cn+1 homologues (1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes are formed more readily than 1,2-disubstituted ones) and the low selectivity towards branched alkanes (highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes)."
          [9] "According to the mechanism depicted in Scheme2, ethene and propene can be readily formed through primary processes, β-H and β-Me transfer, respectively, on the Zrpropyl propagating species."
          [10] "On starting with a well-defined supported Zr dineopentyl species, the homologation of propane at 216C gives the same reaction products with slightly different selectivities: methane (30.5%); ethane (42.3%); isobutane (12.7%); butane (5.7%), which confirms the proposed dialkyl/hydride active sites."
