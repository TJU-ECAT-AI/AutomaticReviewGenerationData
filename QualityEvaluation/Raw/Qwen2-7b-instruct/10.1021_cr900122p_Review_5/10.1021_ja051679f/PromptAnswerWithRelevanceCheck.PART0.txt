Alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides follows mechanisms involving both two-site and one-site schemes. In linear alkane transformations, an intermediate alkene is typically formed, while for cyclic alkane transformations, the creation of metallacyclobutanes is pivotal. Alkenes and metallacyclobutanes serve as key intermediates during the reaction, contributing greatly to its selectivity and the performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

催化系统采用的是以二氧化硅为载体的钽氢化物。在研究中观察到的烷烃裂合反应通过双位点和单位点机制进行。双位点机制涉及催化剂表面的两个不同部位参与反应，而单位点机制仅涉及催化剂表面上的一个活性位点。线性烷烃转化通过形成烯烃作为关键中间体得以实现。环烷烃转化则通过形成金属环丁烷得以实现。烯烃和金属环丁烷的形成对确定反应选择性至关重要。催化剂在各种烷烃转换中的性能受到金属中心稳定性和活性的影响。详细机制洞察提供了开发更高效烷烃裂合催化剂的重要指导。
