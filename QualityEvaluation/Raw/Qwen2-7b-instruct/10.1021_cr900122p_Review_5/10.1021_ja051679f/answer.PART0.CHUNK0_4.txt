The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. Linear alkane transformations are enabled through the formation of alkenes as key intermediates, while cyclic alkane transformations are facilitated by the creation of metallacyclobutanes. The role of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes in determining the reaction selectivity is significant. The performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions is influenced by the stability and activity of the metal centers. Detailed mechanistic insights provide valuable guidance for developing more efficient alkane metathesis catalysts.

催化系统采用的是以二氧化硅为载体的钽氢化物。在研究中观察到的烷烃裂合反应通过双位点和单位点机制进行。双位点机制涉及催化剂表面的两个不同部位参与反应，而单位点机制仅涉及催化剂表面上的一个活性位点。线性烷烃转化通过形成烯烃作为关键中间体得以实现。环烷烃转化则通过形成金属环丁烷得以实现。烯烃和金属环丁烷的形成对确定反应选择性至关重要。催化剂在各种烷烃转换中的性能受到金属中心稳定性和活性的影响。详细机制洞察提供了开发更高效烷烃裂合催化剂的重要指导。
