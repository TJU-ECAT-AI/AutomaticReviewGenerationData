The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two-site and one-site schemes for transforming both linear and cyclic alkanes. Key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in the reaction process. These factors significantly contribute to the selectivity and performance of the catalysts in different alkane conversions.
