The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context of linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the processes involve the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. These factors significantly contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. However, achieving a tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization remains a challenge, and understanding the mechanistic details of these reactions has proven particularly difficult.
