Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit a unique catalytic activity in alkane metathesis due to their ability to facilitate the rearrangement of alkyl groups within the molecule. In the two-site scheme, the catalyst enables the exchange of alkyl groups between different carbon atoms, leading to the formation of new alkyl chains. This process can lead to the generation of both linear and cyclic alkane products, depending on the specific conditions and the nature of the catalyst.

Key intermediates in this process include alkenes, which are formed during the rearrangement of alkyl groups. These alkenes can further react to form more complex cyclic structures, such as metallacyclobutanes, through a series of concerted reactions involving the catalyst. The stability and reactivity of these intermediates are influenced by the electronic properties of the tantalum hydride and the coordination environment provided by the silica support.

The reaction selectivity is governed by the balance between competing pathways, including the formation of linear versus cyclic products, and the rate at which these intermediates are converted into final alkane products. Factors such as the concentration of the catalyst, the temperature, and the presence of co-catalysts can significantly affect the selectivity towards either linear or cyclic products.

The catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is determined by its ability to efficiently activate alkyl groups, facilitate the necessary chemical rearrangements, and control the regioselectivity of the alkane products. The silica support helps to stabilize the tantalum hydride species, enhancing their catalytic activity and allowing for efficient alkane activation and transformation.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves intricate interactions between the catalyst, the alkane substrates, and the formation of key intermediates, leading to selective conversion of alkane molecules into desired products under controlled conditions.
