The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context of this study, the focus is on understanding how linear and cyclic alkane transformations occur, with key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes playing pivotal roles. The formation and role of these intermediates contribute significantly to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

Answering the specific questions regarding the mechanism, the properties of catalysts, and process conditions requires a detailed analysis of the literature provided. The catalysts, whether liquid or solid, have distinct properties that influence the reaction outcomes. For instance, the presence of Brnsted acid sites, Lewis acid sites, and extra-framework aluminum in zeolitic catalysts aids in the initiation and propagation of the alkene addition reactions. The silicon/aluminum ratio and metal ions in ion-exchange positions within zeolites further modulate the reaction pathways, impacting the selectivity and efficiency of the conversion processes.

In terms of process conditions, the reaction temperature plays a critical role in determining the reaction kinetics and product distribution. The alkane/alkene ratio and alkene space velocity also significantly affect the efficiency of alkene feed utilization and the overall conversion rate. Lastly, the composition of the alkene feed influences the selectivity towards desired products, contributing to the optimization of the conversion process.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves intricate interactions between the catalyst properties, process conditions, and the transformation of alkane molecules into desired products through the formation and utilization of key intermediates.
