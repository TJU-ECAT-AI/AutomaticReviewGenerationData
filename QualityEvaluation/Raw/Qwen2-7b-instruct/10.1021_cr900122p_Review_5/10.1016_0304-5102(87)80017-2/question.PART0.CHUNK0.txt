Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125 (U.S.A.) Summary Beta-migratory insertion and elimination processes for alkyl derivatives of permethylscandocene,($-CsMe,),Sc-R,have been investigated. Ethyl- ene is rapidly polymerized at -80 C by (s-CsMes),Sc-R (R = H, CHa, CH,CHs, CH2CH2CH3, etc.) without the need for a cocatalyst. The relative rates of ethylene insertion into scandium-alkyl bonds and the propensity for P-H elimination to afford olefin and (s-CSMes)2Sc-H are found to depend critically on the nature of R. With less sterically encumbered scan- docene compounds (e.g. [($-CsMe4)SiMe2(gS-CsMe4)]Sc-H),o-olefins are oligomerized selectively to the head-to-tail dimers, and catalytic cycliza- tion of 1,5-hexadiene or 1,6-heptadiene to methylenecyclopentane or methylenecyclohexane is observed. Both a- and P-migratory insertion and elimination processes, which interconvert alkyl with alkylidene hydride or olefin hydride derivatives of permethyltantalocene (i.e. [(qs-CSMes)2- Ta-X-R] 2 (r,s-CsMes)2Ta(=X)R (X = alkylidene, olefin; R = H, alkyl)),have been examined. For a complex with the alkyl substituent appended from a cyclopentadienyl ligand, [ ( qs-C,Me,)( $, 1-C,Me4CH,CH,CH,)Ta],the relative rates of a-H and P-H elimination have been measured, and,significantly, a-H elimination is found to be 10 times faster than P-H elim- ination at 100 C. The relative rates of the hydrogen and methyl migrations to alkylidene, benzyne and olefin ligands have been determined. Related

Introduction Migratory insertion and elimination processes [l] in their most general form encompass a variety of rearrangements of fundamental importance in *Contribution No. 7481. **Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 22 organometallic chemistry.
Together with ligand substitution,oxidative addition,reductive elimination and sigma bond metathesis reactions [2],migratory insertion and elimination comprise the elementary steps in the wide range of catalytic reactions promoted by organotransition metal compounds.
The term migratory insertion is itself ambiguous in its meaning,but has generally been used to refer to any process involving the overall insertion of an unsaturated group X (e.g. carbon monoxide,olefin, acetylene,alkyl- idene or alkylidyne),either metal-bound or free, into a M-Z bond. Where a distinction can be made, experiments have invariably shown that the group Z migrates from metal to the coordinated group X. The microscopic reverse of this process has also lacked a concise,widely-accepted term to describe it, except for metal alkyls, where o-H elimination and P-H elimination,etc. have been used extensively with a clear meaning*.
Recognizing that both involve migration of Z either from metal to X (or Y) or from X (or Y) to metal,we propose the general terms cw-Z migratory insertion/a-Z elimina- tion and /3-Z migratory insertion/fl-Z elimination for the reactions shown below :

The 14electron *The meaning of Q-H elimination (as contrasted with CI-H abstraction) has a clear meaning; however, no distinction has been made between 0-H elimination to generate an olefin hydride complex and P-H elimination to generate free olefin and the metal hydride complex. 23 do complexes, Cp*$c-R;(R = alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, etc.), unlike their ($-CsHs) counterparts, are stable monomeric species due to unfavor- able contacts between Cp* ligands which would necessarily arise for oligo- merit structures supported by [Sc(p-R)Sc] 3-center, 2-electron bridges.These complexes undergo rapid sigma bond metathesis reactions with di- hydrogen or the C-H bonds of hydrocarbons: Cp*,Sc-R

Polymerization occurs with excess C2H4. The rates of ethylene insertion into the SC-R bond for the complexes Cp*,Sc-R (R = H, CHs, CH2CHs, CH2CH2CHs) have been measured by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The second- order rate constants (M-l s-l, -80 C) are R = H, > 10V2; R = CHs, &l(2) X 1o-4 ; R = CH,CHs,
4.4(2) X 10e4; and R = CH2CH2CHs, 6.1(2) X 10W3.
Insertion of ethylene into the SC-CH2CHs bond is thus slower than ex- pected on the basis of the rates for insertion into Sc-CH3 and Sc-CH2CH2- CHs. Significantly, Cp*2Sc-CH2CHs has been shown to have an agostic structure with a P-C-H to scandium interaction [2], and it is this ground state stabilization which is likely associated with the higher activation barrier towards insertion of ethylene. The propyl derivative has a conven- tional structure [2], undoubtedly due to unfavorable steric interactions of the methyl group of the propyl ligand with a Cp* ligand which would necessarily accompany the analogous agostic structure. Schmidt and Brook- hart have pointed out that metal complexes which show a propensity for such P-C-H to metal interactions are also often effective olefin polymeriza- tion catalysts [8]. Although such an interaction does not appear to assist olefin insertion into a metal-alkyl bond (rather it appears to add slightly to the activation barrier), the factors which encourage agostic alkyl struc- tures (a very electrophilic metal center) also appear to encourage olefin insertion. Thus, our results provide further support for the conclusions of Brookhart.
Analogous to the insertion of olefins into the scandium-alkyl bonds to generate homologous alkyl derivatives, the reactions of Cp*2Sc-R (R = H, CHs) with 2-butyne result in insertion leading to the formation of an 24 alkenyl derivative (eqn. (3)). The reaction of CH,CGCCH3 with Cp*,Sc-CHs is characterized by a small enthalpy of activation (AE?s = 9.7(3) kcal mol-) and a very negative entropy of activation (AS* = -36(2) e.u.)*, the latter reflecting the very ordered nature of the transition states for these alkyne insertion reactions.

derivatives are in equilibrium with the alkylidene hydride or olefin hydride complexes,and [Cp*,Ta-R] may be trapped with small, 2electron donor ligands such as carbon monoxide,methylisocyanide,

The reaction with dihydrogen results in reductive elimination of methane followed by addition of a second equiva- lent of Hz to yield Cp*,TaH3.
We infer,therefore,that (SiH3) and (PH,) occupy the central equatorial positiun,and methyl and hydrogen the lateral sites of the bent sandwich structures (eqn. (10)).
