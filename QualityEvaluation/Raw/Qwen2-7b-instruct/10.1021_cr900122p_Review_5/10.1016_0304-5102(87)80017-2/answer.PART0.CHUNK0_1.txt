Analogous to the insertion of olefins into the scandium-alkyl bonds to generate homologous alkyl derivatives, the reactions of Cp*2Sc-R (R = H, CHs) with 2-butyne result in insertion leading to the formation of an alkenyl derivative (eqn. (3)).
The reaction of CH,CGCCH3 with Cp*,Sc-CHs is characterized by a small enthalpy of activation (AE?s = 9.7(3) kcal mol-) and a very negative entropy of activation (AS* = -36(2) e.u.)*, the latter reflecting the very ordered nature of the transition states for these alkyne insertion reactions.
With higher alkyls, 6-H elimination to afford olefin and Cp*,Sc-H,which rapidly inserts X-butyne, is observed.
By carrying out these reactions with excess 2-butyne ([CH3CECCH3] = 1 - 3 M), P-H elimination is rate-determining, and the following relative rates have been measured:
Cp*,Sc-CH,CH2R + CH$FCCHs → Cp*,Sc-C(CH3=C(CHJ)H
The standard state used in determining AS* is [CH$FCCH3] = 1 M.
A likely mechanism involves insertion of an α-olefin to yield [SC-CH2CH2R] (eqn. (2)), a second insertion of a-olefin to afford the primary, rather than the more crowded tertiary, scandium alkyl [SC-CH,CH( R)( CH,CH,R)], and then β-H elimination occurring much faster than a third insertion of a-olefin.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides includes both two-site and one-site schemes. In linear alkane transformations, the process starts with the insertion of an α-olefin to produce an alkyl derivative. Subsequently, another olefin insertion takes place to create a primary scandium alkyl, bypassing the more crowded tertiary structure. This mechanism is followed by β-H elimination, which is significantly faster than a third olefin insertion. The formation of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, plays a crucial role in reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. These intermediates facilitate the conversion of various alkane molecules into different products through the rearrangement and recombination of alkyl groups.

In cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism involves the isomerization of diolefins to yield methylene cyclopentane or methylene cyclohexane. The isomerization process is facilitated by β-alkyl migratory insertion, rather than β-alkyl elimination, as a critical step in the catalysis.

Silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit high reactivity towards various alkyl groups, including hydrocarbons, alcohols, thiols, and amines. The reactions with silane or phosphine lead to the formation of formaldehyde-hydride complexes, while reactions with water result in the production of methane and the corresponding acid. The reaction with methanethiol leads to the formation of CH,D and Cp*2Ta(=O)D. The clean rearrangement of Cp*2Ta(&UCI12)H to Cp*,Ta(=O)CH3 under heating conditions demonstrates the ability of these catalysts to perform alkane metathesis efficiently.

催化硅基钽氢化物的烷烃裂合全面机制包括双位点和单位点方案。在线性烷烃转换中，过程从插入α-烯烃开始，产生烷基衍生物。随后，进行另一个烯烃插入以形成初级钪烷基，绕过更拥挤的三级结构。该机制接着是β-H消除，其速度远快于第三个烯烃插入。关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成对反应选择性和催化剂性能至关重要。这些中间体通过重组烷基团促进各种烷烃分子转化为不同产品。

在环状烷烃转换中，机制涉及二烯的异构化以生成甲基环戊烷或甲基环己烷。异构化过程通过β-烷基迁跃插入作为催化反应的关键步骤得以促进。

硅基钽氢化物表现出对各种烷基团的高度活性，包括碳氢化合物、醇、硫醇和胺。与硅烷或磷的反应导致形成甲醛-氢复合物，而与水的反应产生甲烷和相应的酸。与甲硫醇的反应导致形成CH,D和Cp*2Ta(=O)D。在加热条件下，Cp*2Ta(&UCI12)H的清洁重排至Cp*,Ta(=O)CH3表明这些催化剂能够高效地执行烷烃裂合。
