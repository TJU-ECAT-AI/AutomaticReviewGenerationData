Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, the process involves both two-site and one-site schemes, depending on whether linear or cyclic alkane transformations occur. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play crucial roles in these reactions. The catalyst's performance and selectivity in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors including the formation and reactivity of these intermediates. In linear alkane transformations, for instance, the mechanism typically includes steps like the initial insertion of an alkene to form a scandium alkyl intermediate, followed by the elimination of hydrogen or a halogen atom to regenerate the catalyst and produce the desired alkane product. In cyclic alkane transformations, the process might involve the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate before undergoing further rearrangements to yield the final product. The selective formation of specific alkane products is achieved through controlling the stability and reactivity of these intermediates during the catalytic cycle.

In cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism often starts with the insertion of an alkene into the scandium center, generating a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes rearrangement, possibly through a series of hydrogen or halogen migrations, to form the desired cyclic alkane. The selectivity for head-to-tail dimerization of olefins, for example, is attributed to the ground-state stabilization associated with the agostic structure of the alkyl ligand. This stabilization reduces the activation energy for insertion of alkynes, leading to a preference for forming cyclic dimers over longer chain alkanes.

For silica-supported tantalum hydrides, the catalytic activity is enhanced by the presence of small electron-donating ligands, which stabilize the alkylidene and olefin hydride complexes. This stabilization facilitates the rapid formation of the active catalyst species and accelerates the alkane metathesis reactions. The role of water, dimethylamine, methanol, and methanethiol in the catalytic cycle suggests that these molecules interact with the catalyst to promote specific transformations, such as hydrogen elimination or addition reactions, contributing to the overall efficiency of the catalyst.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a combination of insertion and elimination processes, influenced by the nature of the alkane substrate and the properties of the catalyst. The selectivity for specific alkane products is achieved through controlling the stability and reactivity of key intermediates in the catalytic cycle, including alkenes, metallacyclobutanes, and alkylidene or olefin hydride complexes.

在环状烷烃转换中，机制通常从插入烯烃到钪中心开始，生成金属环丁烷中间体。该中间体随后可能经历一系列氢或卤素迁移，形成所需的环烷烃。头对尾二聚化烯烃的选择性归因于与烷基配体相关联的agostic结构的基态稳定化。这种稳定化降低了插入炔的活化能，导致形成环二聚体而非更长链烷烃的偏好。

对于二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物，催化剂活性通过小电子给体配体的存在而增强，这些配体稳定了烷基烯烃和烯烃氢化物复合物。这种稳定化促进了活性催化剂物种的快速形成，并加速了烷烃裂合反应。水、二甲胺、甲醇和甲硫醇在催化周期中的作用表明，这些分子与催化剂相互作用以促进特定转换，如氢消除或加成反应，从而提高催化剂的整体效率。

总之，由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃裂合的全面机制涉及插入和消除过程的结合，受烷烃底物的性质和催化剂的属性影响。通过控制催化循环中关键中间体的稳定性和反应性来选择性地形成特定的烷烃产物。

Analogous to the insertion of olefins into the scandium-alkyl bonds to generate homologous alkyl derivatives, the reactions of Cp*2Sc-R (R = H, CHs) with 2-butyne result in insertion leading to the formation of an alkenyl derivative (eqn. (3)).
The reaction of CH,CGCCH3 with Cp*,Sc-CHs is characterized by a small enthalpy of activation (AE?s = 9.7(3) kcal mol-) and a very negative entropy of activation (AS* = -36(2) e.u.)*, the latter reflecting the very ordered nature of the transition states for these alkyne insertion reactions.
With higher alkyls, 6-H elimination to afford olefin and Cp*,Sc-H,which rapidly inserts X-butyne, is observed.
By carrying out these reactions with excess 2-butyne ([CH3CECCH3] = 1 - 3 M), P-H elimination is rate-determining, and the following relative rates have been measured:
Cp*,Sc-CH,CH2R + CH$FCCHs → Cp*,Sc-C(CH3=C(CHJ)H
The standard state used in determining AS* is [CH$FCCH3] = 1 M.
A likely mechanism involves insertion of an α-olefin to yield [SC-CH2CH2R] (eqn. (2)), a second insertion of a-olefin to afford the primary, rather than the more crowded tertiary, scandium alkyl [SC-CH,CH( R)( CH,CH,R)], and then β-H elimination occurring much faster than a third insertion of a-olefin.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides includes both two-site and one-site schemes. In linear alkane transformations, the process starts with the insertion of an α-olefin to produce an alkyl derivative. Subsequently, another olefin insertion takes place to create a primary scandium alkyl, bypassing the more crowded tertiary structure. This mechanism is followed by β-H elimination, which is significantly faster than a third olefin insertion. The formation of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, plays a crucial role in reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. These intermediates facilitate the conversion of various alkane molecules into different products through the rearrangement and recombination of alkyl groups.

In cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism involves the isomerization of diolefins to yield methylene cyclopentane or methylene cyclohexane. The isomerization process is facilitated by β-alkyl migratory insertion, rather than β-alkyl elimination, as a critical step in the catalysis.

Silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit high reactivity towards various alkyl groups, including hydrocarbons, alcohols, thiols, and amines. The reactions with silane or phosphine lead to the formation of formaldehyde-hydride complexes, while reactions with water result in the production of methane and the corresponding acid. The reaction with methanethiol leads to the formation of CH,D and Cp*2Ta(=O)D. The clean rearrangement of Cp*2Ta(&UCI12)H to Cp*,Ta(=O)CH3 under heating conditions demonstrates the ability of these catalysts to perform alkane metathesis efficiently.

催化硅基钽氢化物的烷烃裂合全面机制包括双位点和单位点方案。在线性烷烃转换中，过程从插入α-烯烃开始，产生烷基衍生物。随后，进行另一个烯烃插入以形成初级钪烷基，绕过更拥挤的三级结构。该机制接着是β-H消除，其速度远快于第三个烯烃插入。关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成对反应选择性和催化剂性能至关重要。这些中间体通过重组烷基团促进各种烷烃分子转化为不同产品。

在环状烷烃转换中，机制涉及二烯的异构化以生成甲基环戊烷或甲基环己烷。异构化过程通过β-烷基迁跃插入作为催化反应的关键步骤得以促进。

硅基钽氢化物表现出对各种烷基团的高度活性，包括碳氢化合物、醇、硫醇和胺。与硅烷或磷的反应导致形成甲醛-氢复合物，而与水的反应产生甲烷和相应的酸。与甲硫醇的反应导致形成CH,D和Cp*2Ta(=O)D。在加热条件下，Cp*2Ta(&UCI12)H的清洁重排至Cp*,Ta(=O)CH3表明这些催化剂能够高效地执行烷烃裂合。

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. The process begins with the treatment of Cp*2Ta(=CH2)H with silane or phosphine, leading to the formation of Cp*2TafCH3)- (SiH3)H or Cp*2Ta(CH3)(PH2)H, respectively. This highlights the role of these ligands in stabilizing the intermediate states crucial for alkane metathesis.

Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play significant roles in the transformation of linear and cyclic alkane structures. The formation of alkenes is pivotal in linear alkane transformations, while metallacyclobutanes contribute to cyclic alkane conversions. Selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by the efficiency of these intermediate formations and the subsequent elimination or migration processes.

For instance, the rapid 6-H elimination to afford olefin and Cp*,Sc-H indicates a mechanism that enables the selective dimerization of alkenes to head-to-tail dimers. This demonstrates the ability of the catalyst to control the reaction pathway based on the substrate's structure and electronic properties.

The clean rearrangement of Cp*2Ta($-OCHz)H to Cp*,Ta(=O)CH3 upon heating to 140°C exemplifies the versatility of the catalyst in undergoing structural changes under different conditions. This process suggests a dynamic equilibrium between the intermediate states, with the catalyst facilitating the elimination of the appropriate group based on the reaction conditions.

The slow conversion of methane and Cp*,Ta(q2-XCHz)H to Cp*2Ta(=X)CHs (X = S, NCHa) through a-CHs migration from [ Cp*,Ta-XCHs] highlights the complexity of the reaction mechanisms involved in alkane transformations. It underscores the importance of considering multiple pathways and intermediates to fully understand the catalyst's behavior in alkane metathesis reactions.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves intricate processes that enable the efficient transformation of linear and cyclic alkane structures. The role of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, along with the control of reaction pathways through selective elimination or migration processes, contributes to the high selectivity and performance of these catalysts in alkane conversions.
