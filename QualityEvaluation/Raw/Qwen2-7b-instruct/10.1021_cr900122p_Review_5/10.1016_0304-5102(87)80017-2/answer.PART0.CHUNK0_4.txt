The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides includes both two-site and one-site schemes. This process enables the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkanes into alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, respectively. These intermediates play crucial roles in achieving reaction selectivity and enhancing the catalyst's performance in various alkane conversions.
