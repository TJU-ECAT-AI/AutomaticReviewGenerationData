[1] "An analogous to the insertion of olefins into the scandium-alkyl bonds to generate homologous alkyl derivatives, the reactions of Cp*2Sc-R (R = H, CHs) with 2-butyne result in insertion leading to the formation of an alkenyl derivative (eqn. (3))."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. The process begins with the treatment of Cp*2Ta(=CH2)H with silane or phosphine, leading to the formation of Cp*2TafCH3)- (SiH3)H or Cp*2Ta(CH3)(PH2)H, respectively. This highlights the role of these ligands in stabilizing the intermediate states crucial for alkane metathesis.

Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play significant roles in the transformation of linear and cyclic alkane structures. The formation of alkenes is pivotal in linear alkane transformations, while metallacyclobutanes contribute to cyclic alkane conversions. Selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by the efficiency of these intermediate formations and the subsequent elimination or migration processes.

For instance, the rapid 6-H elimination to afford olefin and Cp*,Sc-H indicates a mechanism that enables the selective dimerization of alkenes to head-to-tail dimers. This demonstrates the ability of the catalyst to control the reaction pathway based on the substrate's structure and electronic properties.

The clean rearrangement of Cp*2Ta($-OCHz)H to Cp*,Ta(=O)CH3 upon heating to 140°C exemplifies the versatility of the catalyst in undergoing structural changes under different conditions. This process suggests a dynamic equilibrium between the intermediate states, with the catalyst facilitating the elimination of the appropriate group based on the reaction conditions.

The slow conversion of methane and Cp*,Ta(q2-XCHz)H to Cp*2Ta(=X)CHs (X = S, NCHa) through a-CHs migration from [ Cp*,Ta-XCHs] highlights the complexity of the reaction mechanisms involved in alkane transformations. It underscores the importance of considering multiple pathways and intermediates to fully understand the catalyst's behavior in alkane metathesis reactions.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves intricate processes that enable the efficient transformation of linear and cyclic alkane structures. The role of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, along with the control of reaction pathways through selective elimination or migration processes, contributes to the high selectivity and performance of these catalysts in alkane conversions.

全面分析硅基支持钽氢化物催化烷烃互换的机制涉及理解双位点和单位点方案。过程始于将Cp*2Ta(=CH2)H与硅烷或磷化物的处理，导致形成Cp*2TafCH3)-(SiH3)H或Cp*2Ta(CH3)(PH2)H，分别对应于这两种化合物。这突出了这些配体在稳定中间状态中的关键作用，这些中间状态对于烷烃互换至关重要。

关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，在线性烷烃和环状烷烃结构转换中起着重要作用。烯烃的形成是线性烷烃转换的关键，而金属环丁烷则促进环状烷烃转换。各种烷烃转换的选择性和催化剂性能受这些中间体形成效率以及随后的消除或迁移过程的影响。

例如，快速的6-H消除以生成烯烃和Cp*，Sc-H表明了一种机制，允许选择性地将烯烃二聚为头对尾二聚体。这表明催化剂能够根据底物结构和电子性质控制反应途径。

加热至140°C时，Cp*2Ta($-OCHz)H的清洁重排到Cp*，Ta(=O)CH3表明了催化剂在不同条件下进行结构变化的能力。这一过程表明存在中间态之间的动态平衡，催化剂通过调节消除特定组分来促进烷烃互换反应。

通过将甲烷和Cp*，Ta(q2-XCHz)H缓慢转化为Cp*2Ta(=X)CHs(X = S，NCHa)的过程，显示了C-CHs迁移从[Cp*，Ta-XCHs]中的重要性。这强调了考虑多种路径和中间体来全面理解催化剂在烷烃互换反应中行为的重要性。

综上所述，硅基支持钽氢化物催化烷烃互换的全面机制涉及到复杂的过程，这些过程能够高效地转化线性和环状烷烃结构。关键中间体的作用，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，以及通过选择性消除或迁移过程控制反应途径的能力，对烷烃转换催化剂的高选择性和性能具有贡献。
