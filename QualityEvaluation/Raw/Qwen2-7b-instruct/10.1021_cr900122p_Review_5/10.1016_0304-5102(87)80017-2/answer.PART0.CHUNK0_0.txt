<p>With higher alkyls, ,6-H elimination to afford olefin and Cp*,Sc-H,which rapidly inserts X-butyne, is observed.</p>
<p>The reaction of CH,CGCCH3 with Cp*,Sc-CHs is characterized by a small enthalpy of activation (AE?s = 9.7(3) kcal mol-) and a very negative entropy of activation (AS* = -36(2) e.u.).</p>
<p>By carrying out these reactions with excess 2butyne ( [CH3CECCH3] = 1 - 3 M), P-H elimination is rate-determining.</p>
<p>A likely mechanism involves insertion of cx-olefin to yield [SC-CH2CH2R] (eqn. (2)), a second insertion of a-olefin to afford the primary, rather than the more crowded tertiary, scandium alkyl [ SC-CH,CH( R)( CH,CH,R)], and then /3-H elimination occurring much faster than a third insertion of a-olefin.</p>
<p>With water, dimethylamine, methanol, and methanethiol, subsequent reactions take place after addition of the X-H bond.</p>
<p>Treatment of Cp*,Ta(==C&)H with Hz0 yields methane and Cp*2Ta(=O)H, presumably via oxidative addition of an O-H bond to [Cp*,Ta-CHJ, reductive elimination of methane, and CH elimination from [Cp4;Ta-OH].</p>
<p>Formation of CH,D and Cp*2Ta(=O)D from Cp*,Ta(=CH,)H and I&U is in agreement with this tentative mechanism.</p>
<p>The reaction of Cp*2Ta(&UCI12)H cleanly rearranges to Cp*,Ta(=O)CH3.</p>
<p>Similar reactivity is exhibited for Cp*,Ta(=CHJH with CHsSH or (CHs),NH, i.e. initial formation of methane and Cp*,Ta(q2-XCHz)H followed by slow conversion to Cp*2Ta(=X)CHs (X = S, NCHa).</p>

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, the process involves both two-site and one-site schemes, depending on whether linear or cyclic alkane transformations occur. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play crucial roles in these reactions. The catalyst's performance and selectivity in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors including the formation and reactivity of these intermediates. In linear alkane transformations, for instance, the mechanism typically includes steps like the initial insertion of an alkene to form a scandium alkyl intermediate, followed by the elimination of hydrogen or a halogen atom to regenerate the catalyst and produce the desired alkane product. In cyclic alkane transformations, the process might involve the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate before undergoing further rearrangements to yield the final product. The selective formation of specific alkane products is achieved through controlling the stability and reactivity of these intermediates during the catalytic cycle.

In cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism often starts with the insertion of an alkene into the scandium center, generating a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes rearrangement, possibly through a series of hydrogen or halogen migrations, to form the desired cyclic alkane. The selectivity for head-to-tail dimerization of olefins, for example, is attributed to the ground-state stabilization associated with the agostic structure of the alkyl ligand. This stabilization reduces the activation energy for insertion of alkynes, leading to a preference for forming cyclic dimers over longer chain alkanes.

For silica-supported tantalum hydrides, the catalytic activity is enhanced by the presence of small electron-donating ligands, which stabilize the alkylidene and olefin hydride complexes. This stabilization facilitates the rapid formation of the active catalyst species and accelerates the alkane metathesis reactions. The role of water, dimethylamine, methanol, and methanethiol in the catalytic cycle suggests that these molecules interact with the catalyst to promote specific transformations, such as hydrogen elimination or addition reactions, contributing to the overall efficiency of the catalyst.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a combination of insertion and elimination processes, influenced by the nature of the alkane substrate and the properties of the catalyst. The selectivity for specific alkane products is achieved through controlling the stability and reactivity of key intermediates in the catalytic cycle, including alkenes, metallacyclobutanes, and alkylidene or olefin hydride complexes.

对于由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃裂合，该过程包括两个位点和一个位点方案，具体取决于是否进行线性或环状烷烃转换。关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷在这些反应中起着至关重要的作用。催化剂的性能和各种烷烃转化的选择性受到形成和反应中间体因素的影响。例如，在线性烷烃转换中，机制通常包括初始插入烯烃生成钪烷基中间体的步骤，随后通过氢或卤素原子的消除再生催化剂并产生所需烷烃产物。在环状烷烃转换中，过程可能涉及形成金属环丁烷中间体，然后进一步重组以产生最终产品。通过控制催化循环中这些中间体的稳定性和反应性来选择性地形成特定的烷烃产物。

在环状烷烃转换中，机制通常从插入烯烃到钪中心开始，生成金属环丁烷中间体。该中间体随后可能经历一系列氢或卤素迁移，形成所需的环烷烃。头对尾二聚化烯烃的选择性归因于与烷基配体相关联的agostic结构的基态稳定化。这种稳定化降低了插入炔的活化能，导致形成环二聚体而非更长链烷烃的偏好。

对于二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物，催化剂活性通过小电子给体配体的存在而增强，这些配体稳定了烷基烯烃和烯烃氢化物复合物。这种稳定化促进了活性催化剂物种的快速形成，并加速了烷烃裂合反应。水、二甲胺、甲醇和甲硫醇在催化周期中的作用表明，这些分子与催化剂相互作用以促进特定转换，如氢消除或加成反应，从而提高催化剂的整体效率。

总之，由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃裂合的全面机制涉及插入和消除过程的结合，受烷烃底物的性质和催化剂的属性影响。通过控制催化循环中关键中间体的稳定性和反应性来选择性地形成特定的烷烃产物。
