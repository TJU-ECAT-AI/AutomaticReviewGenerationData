The review paper discusses the advancements in understanding the transformation of C2C4 alkanes over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts into more valuable products. It covers various transformations including n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization, and alkanes in mixture with alkenes or aromatic hydrocarbons undergoing isobutanebutene alkylation or benzene alkylation with ethane or propane. The paper also delves into the influence of acidity and pore structure on the zeolite catalysts, dehydroisomerization of n-butane, alkylation reactions involving Pt or Pd/HMFI catalysts, alkylation over Ga/HMFI catalysts, and concludes with a summary of findings.
