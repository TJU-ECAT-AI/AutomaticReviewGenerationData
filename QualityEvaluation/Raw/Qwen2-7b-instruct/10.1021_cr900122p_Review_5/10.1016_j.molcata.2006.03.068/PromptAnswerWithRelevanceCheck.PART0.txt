The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context of this review paper, the focus is on the transformation of C2C4 alkanes using acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts, rather than silica-supported tantalum hydrides specifically. The mechanisms of activation, reaction schemes, and nature of the active sites are discussed in detail. The paper considers the transformations of pure alkanes such as n-butane isomerization and C2C4 alkane aromatization, as well as reactions involving alkanes mixed with alkenes (isobutanebutene alkylation) or with aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene alkylation with ethane or propane).
