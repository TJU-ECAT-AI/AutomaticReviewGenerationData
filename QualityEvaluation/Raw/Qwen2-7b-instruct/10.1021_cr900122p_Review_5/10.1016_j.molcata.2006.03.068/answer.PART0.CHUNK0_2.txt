This review paper discusses the advancements in understanding the transformation of C2C4 alkanes over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts into more valuable products, including n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization, and alkane alkylation reactions involving alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons. It covers various aspects such as activation mechanisms, disproportionation and isomerization, the influence of acidity and pore structure on the catalysts, light alkane aromatization, alkylation of isobutane with n-butene, bifunctional aromatization schemes, dehydrogenation steps, hydroisomerization and dehydroisomerization of n-butane, alkylation of aromatics with small alkanes, and thermodynamic considerations related to alkylation over Pt or Pd/HMFI catalysts. The paper concludes with general insights into the field.
