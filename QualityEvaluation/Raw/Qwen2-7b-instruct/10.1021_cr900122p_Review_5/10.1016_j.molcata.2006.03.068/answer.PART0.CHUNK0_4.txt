[1] "This review paper presents the significant advances which were made in the last decade in the understanding of the transformation over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts of the cheap and readily available C2C4 alkanes into more valuable products: mechanism of activation, reaction scheme, nature of the active sites."
[2] "Both the transformations of pure alkanes: n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization and of alkanes in mixture with alkenes: isobutanebutene alkylation or with aromatic hydrocarbons: benzene alkylation with ethane or propane are considered."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context of this review paper, the focus is on the transformation of C2C4 alkanes using acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts, rather than silica-supported tantalum hydrides specifically. The mechanisms of activation, reaction schemes, and nature of the active sites are discussed in detail. The paper considers the transformations of pure alkanes such as n-butane isomerization and C2C4 alkane aromatization, as well as reactions involving alkanes mixed with alkenes (isobutanebutene alkylation) or with aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene alkylation with ethane or propane).

在此综述论文中，全面介绍了由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃互变异构的机制，包括双位点和单位点方案。然而，本文的重点在于通过酸性和双功能沸石催化剂催化C2C4烷烃转化为更有价值的产品的理解进展，而不是具体讨论二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化。讨论了激活机制、反应方案以及活性位点的性质。论文考虑了纯烷烃如异丁烷异构化和C2C4烷烃芳香化等反应，以及涉及烷烃与烯烃（异丁烷丁二烯烷基化）或与芳烃（乙烷或丙烷与苯烷基化）的反应。
