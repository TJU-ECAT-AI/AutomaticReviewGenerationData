This review paper discusses the advancements in understanding the transformation of C2C4 alkanes over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts into more valuable products. It covers mechanisms of activation, reaction schemes, and the nature of active sites involved in processes such as n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization, and alkanes reacting with alkenes (isobutanebutene alkylation) or aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene alkylation with ethane or propane).
