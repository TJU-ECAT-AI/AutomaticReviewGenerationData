The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides comprises two-site and one-site schemes. Linear and cyclic alkane transformations take place via the creation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Alkenes and metallacyclobutanes serve as key intermediates in these reactions. These components significantly influence reaction selectivity and the performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
