[1] "Silica surfaces are mainly composed of silanols and siloxane bridges of various types: silanols can be either isolated, vicinal, or geminal, and siloxane bridges are connected to each other to form cyclic structures of different sizes, typically 8- to 12-membered rings."
[2] "Treatment at higher temperatures further decreases the OH density and leads to the formation of reactive siloxane bridges, and this process is further accompanied by a loss of specific surface area."
[3] "Overall, this support can be viewed as a large monodentate siloxy ligand (Scheme 1)."
[4] "For instance, methane is selectively oxidized by molecular oxygen at room temperature into methanol by methane mono-oxygenase (MMO) [1,2]."
[5] "With this in mind and the accumulated knowledge in the molecular organometallic chemistry of Re [16], the controlled reaction of a Re molecular complex, [Re(CtBu)(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] and SiO2(700) was attempted, and yielded a well-defined silica-supported Re carbene complex,[(SiO)Re(CtBu)(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)], (Scheme 2a) as evidenced by mass balance analysis and the use of multiple complementary spectroscopic techniques (IR, solid-state NMR, and extended X-ray ab- sorption fine structure, EXAFS) [17,18]."
[6] "The combined use of experimental and computational studies have shown that the high reactivity of this system was due to the asymmetry at the metal center, that is the presence of both a strong and a weaker σ-donor ligands, the neopentyl and the siloxy groups, respectively (Scheme 2b) [21,22]."
[7] "Additionally, it is noteworthy that, on going from Re to Mo, the initial activity is not improved, but that the better selectivity (99.4 %) and stability of the Mo system make it an overall better catalyst (Table 1)."
[8] "On alumina, it allows the formation of highly reactive, but stable cationic species or masked carbenic species whose structures are unusual by comparison with molecular chemistry."
[9] "In fact, CH4 reacts only with AlIII, while H2 reacts with both AlIII and AlIV."
[10] "For instance, the reaction of [Zr(CH2tBu)4] with Al2O3(500) yields 2 equiv of tBuCH3 per grafted Zr, and the com- bined used of spectroscopic (IR and solid-state NMR) and computational studies are in agreement with the formation of cationic surface species, which result from, first, a protonolysis of two ZrC bonds by surface OH groups followed by a transfer of one of the remaining neopentyl ligand onto an adjacent AlS site (Scheme 9) [57]."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves considering both two-site and one-site schemes. Key factors contributing to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance include the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes.

1. **Two-Site and One-Site Schemes**: In the context of alkane metathesis, the silica-supported tantalum hydrides act as catalysts that enable the rearrangement of carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds within alkanes. Two-site and one-site schemes refer to the mechanism of action where the catalyst might involve two distinct active sites or a single active site in the reaction pathway. The two-site scheme suggests that the reaction occurs via sequential activation of two alkene intermediates, while the one-site scheme indicates a concerted mechanism involving the simultaneous activation of both alkene bonds.

2. **Linear and Cyclic Alkane Transformations**: The catalysts facilitate the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkanes. Linear alkane metathesis involves the rearrangement of alkene bonds in straight-chain hydrocarbons, leading to the formation of different alkene isomers. Cyclic alkane transformations, on the other hand, involve the rearrangement of alkene bonds in ring structures, potentially leading to the formation of new ring structures or isomerization within existing rings.

3. **Formation and Role of Key Intermediates**: Key intermediates in the alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Alkenes are formed during the [2+2]-cycloaddition step of the metathesis reaction, serving as the active sites for the subsequent metathesis process. Metallacyclobutanes, on the other hand, represent the transition state or resting state of the catalyst, playing a crucial role in the reaction mechanism by facilitating the rearrangement of alkene bonds.

4. **Contribution to Reaction Selectivity and Catalyst Performance**: The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by the ability to control the reaction pathways and intermediates. Factors such as the stability of the catalyst, the presence of specific surface species, and the efficiency of the catalytic sites contribute to the selectivity towards certain alkane products. For instance, the formation of specific surface hydrides on the silica or alumina support can lead to the selective hydrogenolysis or metathesis of alkanes under controlled conditions.

5. **Various Alkane Conversions**: The catalysts enable various alkane conversions, including hydrogenolysis, metathesis of alkanes, and non-oxidative coupling of methane. These conversions are facilitated through the activation of alkene bonds and the rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds, leading to the production of different alkane isomers or derivatives.

Answering the question requires a detailed understanding of the chemical mechanisms underlying the alkane metathesis process catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The catalysts utilize the unique properties of the oxide surfaces, particularly the reactive siloxane bridges and Lewis acid sites, to stabilize reactive intermediates and enhance the catalytic performance for alkane transformations.

4. **对反应选择性和催化剂性能的贡献**：催化剂的选择性和性能受到控制反应途径和中间体的能力的影响。催化剂稳定性、特定表面物种的存在以及催化位点的效率是影响选择性向某些烷烃产品的关键因素。例如，通过控制氧化物支持（如二氧化硅或氧化铝）上的表面氢化物的形成，可以实现烷烃在可控条件下的选择性氢解或裂合。

5. **各种烷烃转换**：催化剂允许各种烷烃转换，包括氢解、烷烃裂合和甲烷非氧化耦合。这些转换通过激活烯烃键和碳-碳键的重排，导致不同烷烃异构体或衍生物的生产得以实现。

回答问题需要详细了解二氧化硅支持钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的化学机制。催化剂利用氧化物表面的独特性质，特别是活性硅氧烷桥和Lewis酸位点的特性，来稳定活性中间体并增强烷烃转换的催化性能。
