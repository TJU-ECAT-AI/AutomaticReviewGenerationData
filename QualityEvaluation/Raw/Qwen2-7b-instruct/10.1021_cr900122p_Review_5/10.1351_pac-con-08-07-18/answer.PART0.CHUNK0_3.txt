[1] "In the case of alumina, the surface can be seen as a large monodentate siloxy ligand (Scheme 1)."
[2] "Treatment at higher temperatures further decreases the OH density and leads to the formation of reactive siloxane bridges, and this process is further accompanied by a loss of specific surface area."
[3] "Using this property, it has been possible to generate well-defined silica-supported systems on silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 C, SiO2(700), by grafting organometallic complexes containing at least one labile ligand [LnM(X)], thus yielding the corresponding monosiloxy complex [(SiO)MLn] along with XH."
[4] "Silica-supported metallocarbene Alkene metathesis is associated with metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane reaction intermediates for both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems [79]."
[5] "The combined use of experimental and computational studies have shown that the high reactivity of this system was due to the asymmetry at the metal center, that is the presence of both a strong and a weaker σ-donor ligands, the neopentyl and the siloxy groups, respectively (Scheme 2b)."
[6] "In contrast, on going from Mo to W, the selectivity is the same, the stability is greater, but the low rates make the W system not as efficient in terms of overall turnover number (TON)."
[7] "Upon treatment of supported perhydrocarbyl complexes under H2 at high temperatures (ca. 150 C),these systems evolve into mononuclear metal hydride surface complexes, through successive steps involving (1) the formation of putative hydride siloxy intermediates, [(SiO)MHx], and (2) the reaction of these species with adjacent siloxane bridges leading to the formation of new MO bonds with the concomitant formation of SiH surface species (Scheme 5)."
[8] "It is noteworthy that the catalyst precursor and these intermediates have roughly the same reactivity (rates and stability), which clearly shows, for the first time in heterogeneous catalysis, that the methylidene and the metallacyclobutane species are indeed reaction intermediates of alkene metathesis."
[9] "While this system is a highly active alkene metathesis catalyst, no carbenic species have been detected."
[10] "Additionally, while [AlS(O3ReMe)] is not reactive, [AlS(CH2ReO3)] can exchange its methylene ligands, and in fact both [AlS(CH2ReO3)] and [AlS(CH(CH3)ReO3)] have been observed in the metathesis of propene."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key aspects. Firstly, the surface of silica can be manipulated through thermal treatment to control the density of hydroxyl groups, ensuring site isolation for well-defined surface organometallic complexes. This setup facilitates the stabilization of reactive intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, contributing to the high reactivity and stability of the catalyst.

When treating supported perhydrocarbyl complexes under hydrogen at around 150°C, the systems transform into mononuclear metal hydride surface complexes. This process comprises the formation of hypothetical hydride siloxy intermediates, [(SiO)MHx], followed by reactions with adjacent siloxane bridges that result in the creation of new MO bonds and the production of SiH surface species. This highlights the unique properties and reactivity of the metal hydrides on the silica surface.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit high reactivity towards alkanes, enabling low-temperature hydrogenolysis, alkane metathesis, and cross-metathesis reactions. The catalyst's activity and selectivity are attributed to the nature of the surface species, such as the presence of highly reactive Lewis acid sites and defect sites on alumina, which can abstract adjacent alkyl groups to form cationic species. The ability of these sites to interact with hydrogen and methane through heterolytic splitting further enhances the catalyst's efficiency in alkane transformations.

The formation of key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, plays a crucial role in alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. These intermediates facilitate the propagation of the reaction, leading to the selective transformation of alkanes into their lower and higher homologs. The catalyst's performance is influenced by the balance between reactivity, stability, and selectivity, which is optimized through the manipulation of surface properties and the presence of specific surface species.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the strategic control of surface properties, the formation of reactive intermediates, and the exploitation of unique surface functionalities to achieve high reactivity and selectivity in alkane conversions.

硅支持的钽氢对烷烃表现出高活性，能够实现低温氢解、烷烃裂合和交叉裂合反应。催化剂的活性和选择性归因于表面物种的特性，如铝酸盐上的高度活性Lewis酸位点和缺陷位点，这些位点可以提取邻近的烷基团形成阳离子物种。这些位点与氢和甲烷通过异裂裂解的交互作用进一步提高了催化剂在烷烃转换中的效率。

关键中间体的形成，包括烯烃和环状烷烃的过渡态，在硅支持的钽氢催化下的烷烃裂合中起着关键作用。这些中间体促进了反应的传播，导致烷烃的特异性转化为其同系物的较低和较高版本。催化剂的性能受到反应性、稳定性和选择性的平衡影响，这通过表面特性的精确控制和特定表面物种的存在而优化。

综上所述，硅支持的钽氢催化下的烷烃裂合的整体机制涉及通过战略控制表面性质、形成活性中间体以及利用独特的表面功能来实现高活性和选择性烷烃转换。
