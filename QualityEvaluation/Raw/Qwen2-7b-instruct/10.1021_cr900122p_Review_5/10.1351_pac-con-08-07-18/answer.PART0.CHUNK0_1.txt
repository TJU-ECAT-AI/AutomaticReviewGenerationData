[1] "Silica surfaces are mainly composed of silanols and siloxane bridges of various types: silanols can be either isolated, vicinal, or geminal, and siloxane bridges are connected to each other to form cyclic structures of different sizes, typically 8- to 12-membered rings."
[2] "Treatment at higher temperatures further decreases the OH density and leads to the formation of reactive siloxane bridges, and this process is further accompanied by a loss of specific surface area."
[3] "Overall, this support can be viewed as a large monodentate siloxy ligand (Scheme 1)."
[4] "The combined use of experimental and computational studies have shown that the high reactivity of this system was due to the asymmetry at the metal center, that is the presence of both a strong and a weaker σ-donor ligands, the neopentyl and the siloxy groups, respectively (Scheme 2b)."
[5] "It is noteworthy that this system turned out to be a highly reactive alkene metathesis heterogeneous catalyst with the following specific properties..."
[6] "Additionally, it is noteworthy that, on going from Re to Mo, the initial activity is not improved..."
[7] "However, despite a much greater stability than this observed for Mo and Re systems, the rate of metathesis is still slow and the overall performances are lower than those of Mo."
[8] "On alumina, it allows the formation of highly reactive, but stable cationic species or masked carbenic species whose structures are unusual by comparison with molecular chemistry."
[9] "While this system is a highly active alkene metathesis catalyst, no carbenic species have been detected."
[10] "They probably correspond to the resting states of the catalyst, and the actual propagating carbene species is formed in situ in the presence of alkenes (Scheme 10b) [62,63]."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the role of both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit highly reactive and stable properties due to the control of the OH density through thermal treatment. This isolation of reactive sites on the silica surface enables the formation of mononuclear hydride species with unusual structures, stability, and reactivity, facilitating the catalytic transformation of unactivated alkanes at low temperatures. 

The mechanism of alkane metathesis with silica-supported tantalum hydrides primarily involves the activation of the alkane's carbon-carbon bond by the tantalum hydride species. This activation process leads to the formation of an alkene and a metallacyclobutane intermediate. The key to this mechanism lies in the asymmetry at the metal center, where the presence of both a strong and a weaker σ-donor ligands (neopentyl and siloxy groups) lowers the activation energy for the coordination step and destabilizes the metallacyclobutane intermediate during the [2+2]-cycloaddition step. This results in a faster and more efficient alkene metathesis reaction.

The selectivity of the catalyst is influenced by the control over the surface structure and composition of the silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The control of the OH density ensures that the reactive sites are isolated, preventing unwanted side reactions. The formation of mononuclear hydride species, which are highly reactive towards alkanes, allows for the selective transformation of various alkane molecules into desired products. The catalyst's performance is optimized by balancing the reactivity and stability of the hydride species, enabling efficient alkane conversions at low temperatures.

The catalyst's performance is also enhanced by the control of the catalyst's structure, which affects the accessibility of the alkane molecules to the reactive sites. The structure of the silica-supported tantalum hydrides plays a crucial role in determining the reaction pathway and the efficiency of the alkane metathesis process. By tuning the surface properties of the silica, it is possible to extend the approach to late transition metals and discover new reactivities.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the control of surface properties, the formation of reactive hydride species, and the optimization of the catalyst's structure to achieve efficient and selective alkane transformations.

分析二氧化硅支持钽化氢催化烷烃裂合的全面机制涉及理解双位点和单位点方案的作用，线性和环烷烃转化过程中涉及的过程，以及关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和作用，以及这些因素如何共同决定反应选择性和催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能。

二氧化硅支持钽化氢由于通过热处理控制了羟基密度，从而在二氧化硅表面隔离了活性位点。这种隔离使形成具有非典型结构、稳定性和反应性的单核氢化物种成为可能，从而在低温下实现未活化的烷烃的催化转化。

烷烃裂合使用二氧化硅支持钽化氢的主要机制包括激活烷烃中的碳-碳键，由钽化氢物种引起。此激活过程导致烯烃和金属环丁烷中间体的形成。该机制的关键在于金属中心的不对称性，其中强和较弱的σ供体配体（正戊基和硅氧烷基）降低了配合步骤的活化能，并在[2+2]-环加成步骤中使金属环丁烷中间体不稳定。这导致更快、更高效的烷烃裂合反应。

催化剂的选择性受二氧化硅支持钽化氢表面结构和组成的控制影响。通过控制羟基密度，确保活性位点隔离，防止不必要的副反应。高度反应性的氢化物种的形成，它们对烷烃有高度反应性，在低温下允许选择性地转化各种烷烃分子为所需产物。催化剂的性能通过平衡氢化物种的反应性和稳定性得到优化，使得烷烃转化在低温下得以高效进行。

催化剂性能也受到催化剂结构的控制，它影响烷烃分子对活性位点的可达性。二氧化硅支持钽化氢的结构对确定反应路径和烷烃裂合过程的效率起着至关重要的作用。通过调整二氧化硅的表面性质，有可能将方法扩展到晚期过渡金属并发现新的反应性。

综上所述，二氧化硅支持钽化氢催化烷烃裂合的全面机制涉及表面性质的控制、活性氢化物种的形成以及催化剂结构的优化，以实现有效和选择性的烷烃转化。
