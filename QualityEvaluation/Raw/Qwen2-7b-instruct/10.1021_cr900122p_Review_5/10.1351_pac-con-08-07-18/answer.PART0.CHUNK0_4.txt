[1] "Silica-supported metallocarbene Alkene metathesis is associated with metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane reaction intermediates for both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems."
[2] "For instance, for Re2O7/Al2O3, a highly active system working at room temperature, the number of active sites has been estimated to ca. 2 mol %, the Lewis acidity has been identified to be critical, but the formation of the carbene intermediate is still a matter of debate."
[3] "This system turned out to be a highly reactive alkene metathesis heterogeneous catalyst with the following specific properties [17,19,20]:• well-defined active sites (fast initiation, observation of the stoichiometric amount of cross- metathesis products),• activities greater than these of Re2O7/Al2O3 and comparable to the best homogeneous d0 catalysts,"
[4] "In fact, they also display similar reactivities as evidenced by similar initial rates in the metathesis of 1-octene."
[5] "However, the difficulty of achieving full conversion for the molecular complex (longer re-action time) clearly shows that it is not as stable as the silica-supported system, and this shows the stabilization of reactive intermediates on silica surfaces and the advantage of site isolation."
[6] "Silica-supported metal hydrides Upon treatment of supported perhydrocarbyl complexes under H2 at high temperatures (ca. 150 C),these systems evolve into mononuclear metal hydride surface complexes, through successive steps involving (1) the formation of putative hydride siloxy intermediates, [(SiO)MHx], and (2) the reaction of these species with adjacent siloxane bridges leading to the formation of new MO bonds with the concomitant formation of SiH surface species."
[7] "This is in contrast to what is observed on SiO2(700), which yields a neu-tral species, [(SiO)Zr(CH2tBu)3]."
[8] "While this system is a highly active alkene metathesis catalyst, no carbenic species have been detected."
[9] "It is therefore clear through these examples that surfaces can stabilize reactive species, and we are currently further investigating this concept to discover unusual systems and new reactivities."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the roles of two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and roles of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit unusual structure, stability, and reactivity when exposed to hydrogen, enabling the catalytic transformation of unactivated alkanes at low temperatures. This is attributed to the formation of mononuclear hydride species, which have strong MO bonds, allowing for facile activation and recombination of alkyl groups.

The silica-supported systems demonstrate well-defined active sites, which facilitate fast initiation and the observation of stoichiometric amounts of cross-metathesis products. These sites are more stable compared to those in the Re2O7/Al2O3 system, indicating the effectiveness of site isolation provided by the silica support.

The silica-supported metallocarbene catalysts display activities superior to Re2O7/Al2O3 and comparable to the best homogeneous d0 catalysts, showcasing the benefits of using silica as a support for these highly reactive species.

In contrast to the neutral species formed on silica, the alumina-supported systems yield cationic surface species through a protonolysis of ZrC bonds by surface OH groups, followed by the transfer of one of the remaining ligands onto an adjacent AlS site. This process explains the difference in reactivities between alumina and silica-supported systems.

Despite being a highly active alkene metathesis catalyst, the alumina-supported system does not produce detectable carbenic species, suggesting that the actual propagating carbene species is formed in situ upon the presence of alkenes.

Through these examples, it is evident that oxide surfaces can effectively stabilize reactive species, facilitating novel reactivities and systems. Ongoing research aims to uncover additional unusual systems and reactivities enabled by surface stabilization of reactive intermediates.

烷基交换催化由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的全面机制分析涉及理解双位点和一位点方案的作用，线性和环烷烃转化过程中涉及的过程，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其作用，以及这些因素如何促进各种烷烃转换的选择性和催化剂性能。

二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物表现出异常的结构、稳定性和活性，当暴露于氢气时，能够使未活化的烷烃在低温下进行催化转换。这是归因于形成单核氢化物种，它们具有强MO键，允许轻松激活和重组烷基组。

与二氧化硅相比，这些二氧化硅支持的系统显示出定义明确的活性位点，这促进了快速启动，并观察到交叉烷基交换产物的量。与Re2O7/Al2O3系统相比，这些位点更为稳定，表明通过二氧化硅提供位点隔离的有效性。

二氧化硅支持的络合碳烯催化剂的活性优于Re2O7/Al2O3并可与最佳同质d0催化剂相媲美，凸显了使用二氧化硅作为这些高度反应性物种的支持物的优势。

与在二氧化硅上形成的中性物种相反，在氧化铝上形成的表面物种通过表面OH基团对ZrC键的脱水化产生正离子表面物种，随后将剩余的配体之一转移到相邻的AlS位点。这一过程解释了氧化铝和二氧化硅支持系统的反应性差异。

尽管是一种高度有效的烯烃交换催化剂，但氧化铝支持的系统未能检测到碳烯物种，暗示实际的碳烯物种是在烯烃存在的情况下原位产生的。

通过这些例子，可以清楚地看出氧化物表面可以有效地稳定反应性物种，从而促进新颖的反应性和系统。正在进行的研究旨在发现更多通过表面稳定反应中间体实现的异常系统和反应性。
