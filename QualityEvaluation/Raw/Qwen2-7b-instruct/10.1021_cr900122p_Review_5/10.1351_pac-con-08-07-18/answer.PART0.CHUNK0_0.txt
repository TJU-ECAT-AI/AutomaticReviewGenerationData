[1] "Alkene metathesis is best described as a four-step process: coordination, [2+2]-cycloaddition and the corresponding reverse step, cycloreversion, and de-coordination."
[2] "The asymmetry at the metal center is thus optimal because (1) in the first step (coordination), the activation energy associated to the distortion of the metal fragment from a tetrahedron into a trigonal prism is lowered when the incoming alkene coor- dinates trans to the strong σ-donor ligand while the less σ-donor ligand enters the basal plane contain- ing the alkylidene and the alkylidyne ligands and (2) it forms a less stable metallacyclobutane at the second step ([2+2]-cycloaddition)."
[3] "In fact, CH4 reacts only with AlIII, while H2 reacts with both AlIII and AlIV."
[4] "These results fully explain the difference of reactivities of alumina vs. silica-supported systems: the former is a highly active polymerization catalyst, while the latter is totally inactive."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves multiple steps. The process begins with the coordination of the alkene to the metal center, followed by a [2+2]-cycloaddition forming a metallacyclobutane intermediate. The cycloreversion step then converts this into the final alkene product, concluding with the de-coordination of the catalyst. The selectivity and efficiency of the reaction are influenced by the asymmetry at the metal center, where the presence of strong and weak σ-donor ligands optimizes the activation energy and the stability of the metallacyclobutane intermediate. 

Regarding the role of key intermediates, the alkenes play a crucial part as the starting material and the final product. The metallacyclobutanes serve as transient species, facilitating the rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds. The formation of these intermediates is directly related to the reaction pathway and the selectivity of the alkane conversions.

In the context of catalyst performance, silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit high reactivity towards linear alkanes, allowing for the efficient hydrogenolysis and metathesis reactions at low temperatures. This is due to the unique structure and stability of the surface hydrides, which enable selective cleavage of the alkane's C-C bonds without affecting the aromatic ring in styrene. The catalysts are capable of transforming propane into a mixture of ethane and butane, as well as catalyzing the non-oxidative coupling of methane. The ability to selectively hydrogenate double bonds in styrene highlights the specificity of the catalytic process.

In contrast, silica-supported systems generally lack the reactivity necessary for alkane metathesis, indicating a significant difference in the catalytic properties between alumina and silica surfaces. The alumina's ability to generate active catalytic sites through the interaction with hydrogen and methane is attributed to the presence of reactive Lewis acid sites. These sites facilitate the cleavage of alkyl groups, leading to the formation of cationic species that are crucial for the alkene metathesis catalysis. The alumina-supported systems demonstrate high reactivity towards methane and higher alkanes, including the ability to catalyze alkane metathesis reactions and non-oxidative coupling of methane.

催化作用机理包括多个步骤：首先，烯烃与金属中心配位；接着进行[2+2]-环加成反应形成金属环丁烷中间体；随后发生逆反应环重排，最后是催化剂解离。金属中心的不对称性优化了激活能和金属环丁烷中间体的稳定性。强和弱σ供体配体的存在降低了四面体到三棱柱的变形能量，同时使进入基面的烯烃与强σ供体配体配位，而较弱σ供体配体进入包含烷基酮和烷基二烯基的基面。

关键中间体的作用至关重要。烯烃作为起始材料和最终产物参与反应。金属环丁烷作为过渡态，促进碳-碳键的重新排列。中间体的形成直接关系到反应途径和烷烃转化的选择性。

在催化剂性能方面，以二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物表现出对线性烷烃的高活性，允许在低温下高效地进行氢解和链转移反应。这归因于表面氢化物的独特结构和稳定性，它们能够选择性地断裂烷烃的C-C键而不影响苯乙烯中的芳环。催化系统能够将丙烷转化为乙烷和丁烷的混合物，以及催化甲烷的非氧化耦合。选择性氢化苯乙烯双键突显了催化过程的特异性。

相比之下，二氧化硅支持的系统通常缺乏进行烷烃链转移的活性，表明铝氧和二氧化硅表面的催化性质存在显著差异。铝氧上生成的活性催化位点通过与氢气和甲烷的相互作用得以产生。这些位点促进了烷基团的裂解，导致形成阳离子物种，这些物种对于烯烃链转移催化至关重要。铝氧支持的系统显示出对甲烷和更高烷烃的高活性，包括催化烷烃链转移反应和甲烷的非氧化耦合的能力。
