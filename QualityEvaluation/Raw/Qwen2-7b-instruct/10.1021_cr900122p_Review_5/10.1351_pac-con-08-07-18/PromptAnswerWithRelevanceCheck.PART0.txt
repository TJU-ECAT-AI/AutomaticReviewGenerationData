[1] "Alkene metathesis is best described as a four-step process: coordination, [2+2]-cycloaddition and the corresponding reverse step, cycloreversion, and de-coordination."
[2] "The asymmetry at the metal center is thus optimal because (1) in the first step (coordination), the activation energy associated to the distortion of the metal fragment from a tetrahedron into a trigonal prism is lowered when the incoming alkene coor- dinates trans to the strong σ-donor ligand while the less σ-donor ligand enters the basal plane contain- ing the alkylidene and the alkylidyne ligands and (2) it forms a less stable metallacyclobutane at the second step ([2+2]-cycloaddition)."
[3] "In fact, CH4 reacts only with AlIII, while H2 reacts with both AlIII and AlIV."
[4] "These results fully explain the difference of reactivities of alumina vs. silica-supported systems: the former is a highly active polymerization catalyst, while the latter is totally inactive."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves multiple steps. The process begins with the coordination of the alkene to the metal center, followed by a [2+2]-cycloaddition forming a metallacyclobutane intermediate. The cycloreversion step then converts this into the final alkene product, concluding with the de-coordination of the catalyst. The selectivity and efficiency of the reaction are influenced by the asymmetry at the metal center, where the presence of strong and weak σ-donor ligands optimizes the activation energy and the stability of the metallacyclobutane intermediate. 

Regarding the role of key intermediates, the alkenes play a crucial part as the starting material and the final product. The metallacyclobutanes serve as transient species, facilitating the rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds. The formation of these intermediates is directly related to the reaction pathway and the selectivity of the alkane conversions.

In the context of catalyst performance, silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit high reactivity towards linear alkanes, allowing for the efficient hydrogenolysis and metathesis reactions at low temperatures. This is due to the unique structure and stability of the surface hydrides, which enable selective cleavage of the alkane's C-C bonds without affecting the aromatic ring in styrene. The catalysts are capable of transforming propane into a mixture of ethane and butane, as well as catalyzing the non-oxidative coupling of methane. The ability to selectively hydrogenate double bonds in styrene highlights the specificity of the catalytic process.

In contrast, silica-supported systems generally lack the reactivity necessary for alkane metathesis, indicating a significant difference in the catalytic properties between alumina and silica surfaces. The alumina's ability to generate active catalytic sites through the interaction with hydrogen and methane is attributed to the presence of reactive Lewis acid sites. These sites facilitate the cleavage of alkyl groups, leading to the formation of cationic species that are crucial for the alkene metathesis catalysis. The alumina-supported systems demonstrate high reactivity towards methane and higher alkanes, including the ability to catalyze alkane metathesis reactions and non-oxidative coupling of methane.

催化作用机理包括多个步骤：首先，烯烃与金属中心配位；接着进行[2+2]-环加成反应形成金属环丁烷中间体；随后发生逆反应环重排，最后是催化剂解离。金属中心的不对称性优化了激活能和金属环丁烷中间体的稳定性。强和弱σ供体配体的存在降低了四面体到三棱柱的变形能量，同时使进入基面的烯烃与强σ供体配体配位，而较弱σ供体配体进入包含烷基酮和烷基二烯基的基面。

关键中间体的作用至关重要。烯烃作为起始材料和最终产物参与反应。金属环丁烷作为过渡态，促进碳-碳键的重新排列。中间体的形成直接关系到反应途径和烷烃转化的选择性。

在催化剂性能方面，以二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物表现出对线性烷烃的高活性，允许在低温下高效地进行氢解和链转移反应。这归因于表面氢化物的独特结构和稳定性，它们能够选择性地断裂烷烃的C-C键而不影响苯乙烯中的芳环。催化系统能够将丙烷转化为乙烷和丁烷的混合物，以及催化甲烷的非氧化耦合。选择性氢化苯乙烯双键突显了催化过程的特异性。

相比之下，二氧化硅支持的系统通常缺乏进行烷烃链转移的活性，表明铝氧和二氧化硅表面的催化性质存在显著差异。铝氧上生成的活性催化位点通过与氢气和甲烷的相互作用得以产生。这些位点促进了烷基团的裂解，导致形成阳离子物种，这些物种对于烯烃链转移催化至关重要。铝氧支持的系统显示出对甲烷和更高烷烃的高活性，包括催化烷烃链转移反应和甲烷的非氧化耦合的能力。

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the role of both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit highly reactive and stable properties due to the control of the OH density through thermal treatment. This isolation of reactive sites on the silica surface enables the formation of mononuclear hydride species with unusual structures, stability, and reactivity, facilitating the catalytic transformation of unactivated alkanes at low temperatures. 

The mechanism of alkane metathesis with silica-supported tantalum hydrides primarily involves the activation of the alkane's carbon-carbon bond by the tantalum hydride species. This activation process leads to the formation of an alkene and a metallacyclobutane intermediate. The key to this mechanism lies in the asymmetry at the metal center, where the presence of both a strong and a weaker σ-donor ligands (neopentyl and siloxy groups) lowers the activation energy for the coordination step and destabilizes the metallacyclobutane intermediate during the [2+2]-cycloaddition step. This results in a faster and more efficient alkene metathesis reaction.

The selectivity of the catalyst is influenced by the control over the surface structure and composition of the silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The control of the OH density ensures that the reactive sites are isolated, preventing unwanted side reactions. The formation of mononuclear hydride species, which are highly reactive towards alkanes, allows for the selective transformation of various alkane molecules into desired products. The catalyst's performance is optimized by balancing the reactivity and stability of the hydride species, enabling efficient alkane conversions at low temperatures.

The catalyst's performance is also enhanced by the control of the catalyst's structure, which affects the accessibility of the alkane molecules to the reactive sites. The structure of the silica-supported tantalum hydrides plays a crucial role in determining the reaction pathway and the efficiency of the alkane metathesis process. By tuning the surface properties of the silica, it is possible to extend the approach to late transition metals and discover new reactivities.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the control of surface properties, the formation of reactive hydride species, and the optimization of the catalyst's structure to achieve efficient and selective alkane transformations.

烷烃裂合使用二氧化硅支持钽化氢的主要机制包括激活烷烃中的碳-碳键，由钽化氢物种引起。此激活过程导致烯烃和金属环丁烷中间体的形成。该机制的关键在于金属中心的不对称性，其中强和较弱的σ供体配体（正戊基和硅氧烷基）降低了配合步骤的活化能，并在[2+2]-环加成步骤中使金属环丁烷中间体不稳定。这导致更快、更高效的烷烃裂合反应。

催化剂的选择性受二氧化硅支持钽化氢表面结构和组成的控制影响。通过控制羟基密度，确保活性位点隔离，防止不必要的副反应。高度反应性的氢化物种的形成，它们对烷烃有高度反应性，在低温下允许选择性地转化各种烷烃分子为所需产物。催化剂的性能通过平衡氢化物种的反应性和稳定性得到优化，使得烷烃转化在低温下得以高效进行。

催化剂性能也受到催化剂结构的控制，它影响烷烃分子对活性位点的可达性。二氧化硅支持钽化氢的结构对确定反应路径和烷烃裂合过程的效率起着至关重要的作用。通过调整二氧化硅的表面性质，有可能将方法扩展到晚期过渡金属并发现新的反应性。

综上所述，二氧化硅支持钽化氢催化烷烃裂合的全面机制涉及表面性质的控制、活性氢化物种的形成以及催化剂结构的优化，以实现有效和选择性的烷烃转化。

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves considering both two-site and one-site schemes. Key factors contributing to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance include the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes.

1. **Two-Site and One-Site Schemes**: In the context of alkane metathesis, the silica-supported tantalum hydrides act as catalysts that enable the rearrangement of carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds within alkanes. Two-site and one-site schemes refer to the mechanism of action where the catalyst might involve two distinct active sites or a single active site in the reaction pathway. The two-site scheme suggests that the reaction occurs via sequential activation of two alkene intermediates, while the one-site scheme indicates a concerted mechanism involving the simultaneous activation of both alkene bonds.

2. **Linear and Cyclic Alkane Transformations**: The catalysts facilitate the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkanes. Linear alkane metathesis involves the rearrangement of alkene bonds in straight-chain hydrocarbons, leading to the formation of different alkene isomers. Cyclic alkane transformations, on the other hand, involve the rearrangement of alkene bonds in ring structures, potentially leading to the formation of new ring structures or isomerization within existing rings.

3. **Formation and Role of Key Intermediates**: Key intermediates in the alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Alkenes are formed during the [2+2]-cycloaddition step of the metathesis reaction, serving as the active sites for the subsequent metathesis process. Metallacyclobutanes, on the other hand, represent the transition state or resting state of the catalyst, playing a crucial role in the reaction mechanism by facilitating the rearrangement of alkene bonds.

4. **Contribution to Reaction Selectivity and Catalyst Performance**: The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by the ability to control the reaction pathways and intermediates. Factors such as the stability of the catalyst, the presence of specific surface species, and the efficiency of the catalytic sites contribute to the selectivity towards certain alkane products. For instance, the formation of specific surface hydrides on the silica or alumina support can lead to the selective hydrogenolysis or metathesis of alkanes under controlled conditions.

5. **Various Alkane Conversions**: The catalysts enable various alkane conversions, including hydrogenolysis, metathesis of alkanes, and non-oxidative coupling of methane. These conversions are facilitated through the activation of alkene bonds and the rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds, leading to the production of different alkane isomers or derivatives.

Answering the question requires a detailed understanding of the chemical mechanisms underlying the alkane metathesis process catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The catalysts utilize the unique properties of the oxide surfaces, particularly the reactive siloxane bridges and Lewis acid sites, to stabilize reactive intermediates and enhance the catalytic performance for alkane transformations.

2. **线性与环状烷烃转换**：催化剂使直链和环状烷烃的转换成为可能。线性烷烃裂合涉及到直链烃中烯烃键的重排，导致不同烯烃异构体的形成。环烷烃转换则涉及到环结构中烯烃键的重排，可能产生新的环结构或现有环内的异构化。

3. **关键中间体的形成与作用**：二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。烯烃在重排烷烃反应中的[2+2]-环加成步骤期间形成，作为后续裂合过程的活性位点。金属环丁烷代表催化剂的过渡态或休息状态，在反应机制中发挥关键作用，通过促进碳-碳键的重排。

4. **对反应选择性和催化剂性能的贡献**：催化剂的选择性和性能受到控制反应途径和中间体的能力的影响。催化剂稳定性、特定表面物种的存在以及催化位点的效率是影响选择性向某些烷烃产品的关键因素。例如，通过控制氧化物支持（如二氧化硅或氧化铝）上的表面氢化物的形成，可以实现烷烃在可控条件下的选择性氢解或裂合。

5. **各种烷烃转换**：催化剂允许各种烷烃转换，包括氢解、烷烃裂合和甲烷非氧化耦合。这些转换通过激活烯烃键和碳-碳键的重排，导致不同烷烃异构体或衍生物的生产得以实现。

回答问题需要详细了解二氧化硅支持钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的化学机制。催化剂利用氧化物表面的独特性质，特别是活性硅氧烷桥和Lewis酸位点的特性，来稳定活性中间体并增强烷烃转换的催化性能。

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key aspects. Firstly, the surface of silica can be manipulated through thermal treatment to control the density of hydroxyl groups, ensuring site isolation for well-defined surface organometallic complexes. This setup facilitates the stabilization of reactive intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, contributing to the high reactivity and stability of the catalyst.

When treating supported perhydrocarbyl complexes under hydrogen at around 150°C, the systems transform into mononuclear metal hydride surface complexes. This process comprises the formation of hypothetical hydride siloxy intermediates, [(SiO)MHx], followed by reactions with adjacent siloxane bridges that result in the creation of new MO bonds and the production of SiH surface species. This highlights the unique properties and reactivity of the metal hydrides on the silica surface.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit high reactivity towards alkanes, enabling low-temperature hydrogenolysis, alkane metathesis, and cross-metathesis reactions. The catalyst's activity and selectivity are attributed to the nature of the surface species, such as the presence of highly reactive Lewis acid sites and defect sites on alumina, which can abstract adjacent alkyl groups to form cationic species. The ability of these sites to interact with hydrogen and methane through heterolytic splitting further enhances the catalyst's efficiency in alkane transformations.

The formation of key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, plays a crucial role in alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. These intermediates facilitate the propagation of the reaction, leading to the selective transformation of alkanes into their lower and higher homologs. The catalyst's performance is influenced by the balance between reactivity, stability, and selectivity, which is optimized through the manipulation of surface properties and the presence of specific surface species.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the strategic control of surface properties, the formation of reactive intermediates, and the exploitation of unique surface functionalities to achieve high reactivity and selectivity in alkane conversions.

硅支持的钽氢对烷烃表现出高活性，能够实现低温氢解、烷烃裂合和交叉裂合反应。催化剂的活性和选择性归因于表面物种的特性，如铝酸盐上的高度活性Lewis酸位点和缺陷位点，这些位点可以提取邻近的烷基团形成阳离子物种。这些位点与氢和甲烷通过异裂裂解的交互作用进一步提高了催化剂在烷烃转换中的效率。

关键中间体的形成，包括烯烃和环状烷烃的过渡态，在硅支持的钽氢催化下的烷烃裂合中起着关键作用。这些中间体促进了反应的传播，导致烷烃的特异性转化为其同系物的较低和较高版本。催化剂的性能受到反应性、稳定性和选择性的平衡影响，这通过表面特性的精确控制和特定表面物种的存在而优化。

[1] "Silica-supported metallocarbene Alkene metathesis is associated with metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane reaction intermediates for both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems."
[2] "For instance, for Re2O7/Al2O3, a highly active system working at room temperature, the number of active sites has been estimated to ca. 2 mol %, the Lewis acidity has been identified to be critical, but the formation of the carbene intermediate is still a matter of debate."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the roles of two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and roles of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides exhibit unusual structure, stability, and reactivity when exposed to hydrogen, enabling the catalytic transformation of unactivated alkanes at low temperatures. This is attributed to the formation of mononuclear hydride species, which have strong MO bonds, allowing for facile activation and recombination of alkyl groups.

The silica-supported systems demonstrate well-defined active sites, which facilitate fast initiation and the observation of stoichiometric amounts of cross-metathesis products. These sites are more stable compared to those in the Re2O7/Al2O3 system, indicating the effectiveness of site isolation provided by the silica support.

The silica-supported metallocarbene catalysts display activities superior to Re2O7/Al2O3 and comparable to the best homogeneous d0 catalysts, showcasing the benefits of using silica as a support for these highly reactive species.

In contrast to the neutral species formed on silica, the alumina-supported systems yield cationic surface species through a protonolysis of ZrC bonds by surface OH groups, followed by the transfer of one of the remaining ligands onto an adjacent AlS site. This process explains the difference in reactivities between alumina and silica-supported systems.

Despite being a highly active alkene metathesis catalyst, the alumina-supported system does not produce detectable carbenic species, suggesting that the actual propagating carbene species is formed in situ upon the presence of alkenes.

Through these examples, it is evident that oxide surfaces can effectively stabilize reactive species, facilitating novel reactivities and systems. Ongoing research aims to uncover additional unusual systems and reactivities enabled by surface stabilization of reactive intermediates.

与在二氧化硅上形成的中性物种相反，在氧化铝上形成的表面物种通过表面OH基团对ZrC键的脱水化产生正离子表面物种，随后将剩余的配体之一转移到相邻的AlS位点。这一过程解释了氧化铝和二氧化硅支持系统的反应性差异。

尽管是一种高度有效的烯烃交换催化剂，但氧化铝支持的系统未能检测到碳烯物种，暗示实际的碳烯物种是在烯烃存在的情况下原位产生的。

通过这些例子，可以清楚地看出氧化物表面可以有效地稳定反应性物种，从而促进新颖的反应性和系统。正在进行的研究旨在发现更多通过表面稳定反应中间体实现的异常系统和反应性。
