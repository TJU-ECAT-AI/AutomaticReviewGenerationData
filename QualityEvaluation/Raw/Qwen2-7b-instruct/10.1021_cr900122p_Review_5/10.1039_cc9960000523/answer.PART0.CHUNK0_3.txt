[1] "Most effort has been given to the oxidative coupling reaction,' but more recently there has been some success in the synthesis of catalysts active for the direct oxidation of methane to meth- anoL"
[2] "The exchange reaction of methane and other hydrocarbons with deuterium has been extensively studied over many metals and is generally accepted to proceed via surface radical specie."
[3] "The high activity demonstrated by Ga203 and ZnO is of significance since both these oxides are the preferred catalyst components together with H-ZSM-5 for the aromatisation of propane and butane in the Cyclar process.'"
[4] "From these studies we identified Moo3 as an oxide for which methanol was reasonably stable, but was known to activate dioxygen."
[5] "It is clear that although both Ga203 and Moo3 exhibit low methanol selectivities, the Ga203/M003 physical mixture significantly enhances the rate of methanol formation."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes, with processes for linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in determining reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The formation and role of these intermediates are essential in understanding the mechanisms behind the metathesis reactions.
