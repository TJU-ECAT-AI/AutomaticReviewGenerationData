[1] "The high activity demonstrated by Ga203 and ZnO is of significance since both these oxides are the preferred catalyst components together with H-ZSM-5 for the aromatisation of propane and butane in the Cyclar process."
[2] "Previously we have studied the stability of methanol towards oxidation at elevated temperatures over oxides and have shown that a correlation exists between the rate of methanol oxidation and the rate of its '*02/1602 exchange reaction."
[3] "From these studies we identified Moo3 as an oxide for which methanol was reasonably stable, but was known to activate dioxygen."
[4] "To test the hypothesis that Ga203 would improve methane activation when used as a catalyst component, a physical mixture of Ga203 and Moo3 (mole ratio 1 :1) was prepared by grinding the oxides together followed by calcination."
[5] "Ga203, Moo3 and the Ga203/Mo03 physical mixture were then used separately as methane oxidation catalysts in a silica-lined stainless-steel microreactor at 15 bar using a reaction mixture of CH4 : O2 : He = 23 :2 :5 with a total gas hourly space velocity of 5000 h-1."
[6] "The experimental results are shown in Table 1 and it is clear that although both Ga203 and Moo3 exhibit low methanol selectivities, the Ga203/Mo03 physical mixture significantly enhances the rate of methanol formation."

The study utilized the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as a predictive catalyst design tool to identify Ga203 as a catalyst for the methane partial oxidation to methanol. The high CH4/D2 exchange rate over Ga203 compared to other simple oxides was found to be indicative of its effectiveness in methane activation. This led to the development of a physical mixture of Ga203 and MoO3, which showed enhanced methanol formation efficiency when used as a catalyst compared to Ga203 or MoO3 alone. This indicates that the combination of these oxides in a physical mixture can improve the overall performance of the catalyst for methane oxidation to methanol.

该研究利用甲烷与重氢交换反应作为催化剂设计工具，成功地识别出镓氧化物（Ga203）是将甲烷部分氧化为甲醇的有效催化剂。镓氧化物在与其他简单氧化物进行甲烷激活方面的高甲烷与重氢交换速率表明其在甲烷激活方面的有效性。这导致开发了一种镓氧化物和钼酸盐（MoO3）的物理混合物，该混合物在用作甲烷氧化制甲醇催化剂时显示出增强的甲醇形成效率，相比于单独使用镓氧化物或钼酸盐。这表明这两种氧化物的物理混合可以改善催化剂的整体性能，用于甲烷氧化至甲醇。
