[1] "We have now successfully addressed this problem and have used the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as a predictive catalyst design parameter."
[2] "The high activity demonstrated by Ga203 and ZnO is of significance since both these oxides are the preferred catalyst components together with H-ZSM-5 for the aromatisation of propane and butane in the Cyclar process."
[3] "On the basis of these findings we considered that Ga203 could be a useful component of selective methane oxidation catalysts."
[4] "Previously we have studied the stability of methanol towards oxidation at elevated temperatures over oxides and have shown that a correlation exists between the rate of methanol oxidation and the rate of its '*02/1602 exchange reaction."
[5] "From these studies we identified Moo3 as an oxide for which methanol was reasonably stable, but was known to activate dioxygen."
[6] "To test the hypothesis that Ga203 would improve methane activation when used as a catalyst component, a physical mixture of Ga203 and Moo3 (mole ratio 1 :1) was prepared by grinding the oxides together followed by calcination [650 "C, 3 h]."
[7] "X-Ray diffraction analysis and other characterisation methods did not indicate that any significant changes in the oxides had occurred on calcination."
[8] "Ga203, Moo3 and the Ga203/Mo03 physical mixture were then used separately as methane oxidation catalysts in a silica-lined stainless-steel microrector at 15 bar using a reaction mixture of CH4 : O2 : He = 23 :2 :5 with a total gas hourly space velocity of 5000 h-1."
[9] "The experimental results are shown in Table 1 and it is clear that although both Ga203 and Moo3 exhibit low methanol selectivities, the Ga203/Mo03 physical mixture significantly enhances the rate of methanol formation."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The literature highlights the importance of the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as a predictive catalyst design parameter. Gallium oxide (Ga203) and zinc oxide (ZnO) are noted for their high activity in this reaction, suggesting their potential utility in catalytic applications. The study of methanol stability over oxides, particularly the correlation between methanol oxidation rate and its exchange reaction rate, points to the identification of oxides like magnesium oxide (Moo3) as stable but dioxygen-activating materials. The use of a physical mixture of Ga203 and Moo3 demonstrates enhanced methanol formation when used as catalysts, indicating the beneficial combination of properties from both oxides in catalytic performance.

The results suggest that the incorporation of Ga203 and potentially ZnO and Cr203 into catalyst formulations could lead to the design of novel high-activity catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane, based on the observed improvements in methanol formation.

文献强调了甲烷/氘交换反应作为催化剂设计参数预测性的意义。镓氧化物（Ga203）和锌氧化物（ZnO）在该反应中表现出高活性，暗示它们在催化应用中的潜力。关于甲醇在氧化物上的稳定性研究，特别是甲醇氧化速率与其交换反应速率之间的相关性，表明了镁氧化物（Moo3）等氧化物作为稳定但能激活氧气的材料的识别。通过使用镓氧化物和镁氧化物的物理混合物，观察到在作为催化剂使用时显著提高了甲醇的形成率，这表明了从两种氧化物中获得的性质在催化剂性能方面的有益组合。

结果表明，通过将镓氧化物与可能的锌氧化物和铬氧化物结合到催化剂配方中，可以设计出用于部分氧化甲烷的新一代高效催化剂，基于观察到的甲醇形成率的提高。
