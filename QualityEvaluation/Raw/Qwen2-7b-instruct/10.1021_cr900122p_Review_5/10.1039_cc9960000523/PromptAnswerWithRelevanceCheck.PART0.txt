[1] "We have now successfully addressed this problem and have used the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as a predictive catalyst design parameter."
[2] "The high activity demonstrated by Ga203 and ZnO is of significance since both these oxides are the preferred catalyst components together with H-ZSM-5 for the aromatisation of propane and butane in the Cyclar process."
[3] "On the basis of these findings we considered that Ga203 could be a useful component of selective methane oxidation catalysts."
[4] "Previously we have studied the stability of methanol towards oxidation at elevated temperatures over oxides and have shown that a correlation exists between the rate of methanol oxidation and the rate of its '*02/1602 exchange reaction."
[5] "From these studies we identified Moo3 as an oxide for which methanol was reasonably stable, but was known to activate dioxygen."
[6] "To test the hypothesis that Ga203 would improve methane activation when used as a catalyst component, a physical mixture of Ga203 and Moo3 (mole ratio 1 :1) was prepared by grinding the oxides together followed by calcination [650 "C, 3 h]."
[7] "X-Ray diffraction analysis and other characterisation methods did not indicate that any significant changes in the oxides had occurred on calcination."
[8] "Ga203, Moo3 and the Ga203/Mo03 physical mixture were then used separately as methane oxidation catalysts in a silica-lined stainless-steel microrector at 15 bar using a reaction mixture of CH4 : O2 : He = 23 :2 :5 with a total gas hourly space velocity of 5000 h-1."
[9] "The experimental results are shown in Table 1 and it is clear that although both Ga203 and Moo3 exhibit low methanol selectivities, the Ga203/Mo03 physical mixture significantly enhances the rate of methanol formation."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The literature highlights the importance of the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as a predictive catalyst design parameter. Gallium oxide (Ga203) and zinc oxide (ZnO) are noted for their high activity in this reaction, suggesting their potential utility in catalytic applications. The study of methanol stability over oxides, particularly the correlation between methanol oxidation rate and its exchange reaction rate, points to the identification of oxides like magnesium oxide (Moo3) as stable but dioxygen-activating materials. The use of a physical mixture of Ga203 and Moo3 demonstrates enhanced methanol formation when used as catalysts, indicating the beneficial combination of properties from both oxides in catalytic performance.

The results suggest that the incorporation of Ga203 and potentially ZnO and Cr203 into catalyst formulations could lead to the design of novel high-activity catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane, based on the observed improvements in methanol formation.

The CH4/D2 exchange reaction has been utilized as a predictive catalyst design tool for methane activation over potential oxide catalysts. Gallium oxide demonstrates an exceptionally high exchange rate compared to other simple oxides, leading to the identification of Ga2O3/MoO3 as a selective catalyst for methane partial oxidation to methanol. The stability of methanol towards oxidation at elevated temperatures over oxides correlates with the rate of its '*02/1602 exchange reaction. Molybdenum oxide (Moo3) activates dioxygen, and the combination of Ga2O3 and Moo3 in a physical mixture enhances the rate of methanol formation. Incorporating Ga2O3, potentially along with ZnO and Cr2O3, into catalyst formulations could lead to the development of novel high-activity catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane. The research was financially supported by the Gas Research Institute of Chicago.

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes. The process typically involves the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes through the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors including the stability of the alkane, the ability of the catalyst to activate the alkane, and the formation of these intermediates. In the context of the literature, the high activity demonstrated by gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and zinc oxide (ZnO) is significant because they are preferred components in the Cyclar process for the aromatization of propane and butane. Moreover, manganese oxide (Moo3) is noted for its stability towards methanol, yet it activates dioxygen. The combination of Ga2O3 and Moo3 in a physical mixture significantly enhances the rate of methanol formation, indicating that the integration of these oxides can lead to improved catalyst performance in alkane oxidation reactions.

The study utilized the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as a predictive catalyst design tool to identify Ga203 as a catalyst for the methane partial oxidation to methanol. The high CH4/D2 exchange rate over Ga203 compared to other simple oxides was found to be indicative of its effectiveness in methane activation. This led to the development of a physical mixture of Ga203 and MoO3, which showed enhanced methanol formation efficiency when used as a catalyst compared to Ga203 or MoO3 alone. This indicates that the combination of these oxides in a physical mixture can improve the overall performance of the catalyst for methane oxidation to methanol.

该研究利用甲烷与重氢交换反应作为催化剂设计工具，成功地识别出镓氧化物（Ga203）是将甲烷部分氧化为甲醇的有效催化剂。镓氧化物在与其他简单氧化物进行甲烷激活方面的高甲烷与重氢交换速率表明其在甲烷激活方面的有效性。这导致开发了一种镓氧化物和钼酸盐（MoO3）的物理混合物，该混合物在用作甲烷氧化制甲醇催化剂时显示出增强的甲醇形成效率，相比于单独使用镓氧化物或钼酸盐。这表明这两种氧化物的物理混合可以改善催化剂的整体性能，用于甲烷氧化至甲醇。
