The CH4/D2 exchange reaction has been utilized as a predictive catalyst design tool for methane activation over potential oxide catalysts. Gallium oxide demonstrates an exceptionally high exchange rate compared to other simple oxides, leading to the identification of Ga2O3/MoO3 as a selective catalyst for methane partial oxidation to methanol. The stability of methanol towards oxidation at elevated temperatures over oxides correlates with the rate of its '*02/1602 exchange reaction. Molybdenum oxide (Moo3) activates dioxygen, and the combination of Ga2O3 and Moo3 in a physical mixture enhances the rate of methanol formation. Incorporating Ga2O3, potentially along with ZnO and Cr2O3, into catalyst formulations could lead to the development of novel high-activity catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane. The research was financially supported by the Gas Research Institute of Chicago.

已经成功地利用了CH4/D2交换反应作为预测催化剂设计参数的方法来评估甲烷激活潜力氧化物催化剂。镓氧化铝在所有简单氧化物中的交换速率最高，是两个数量级，锌氧化铝和铬氧化铝也表现出高活性。从这些研究中，我们发现钼氧化铝（Moo3）对于甲醇具有相对稳定的特性，但能激活氧。两种氧化物的简单物理混合物结合了它们各自的特性，显著提高了甲醇形成速率。将镓氧化铝、可能还有锌氧化铝和铬氧化铝纳入催化剂配方中，有可能开发出新型高效甲烷部分氧化催化剂。这项研究得到了芝加哥气体研究所的财务支持。
