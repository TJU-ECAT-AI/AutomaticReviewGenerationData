[1] "Different types of tin sites can be evidenced by means of IR spectroscopy of adsorbed probe molecules such as acetonitrile in combination with DFT calculations. The nature of these sites depends on the zeolite structure and can be modified by the pre-treatment conditions."
[2] "Tin species with one or two hydrolyzed SnOSi bridges act as strong Lewis acid sites, and are highly active in several reactions. On the other hand, tin species in framework positions coordinated to four framework siloxy groups are not active."
[3] "It has been established that synthesizing Sn-containing materials by different direct synthesis or post-synthesis methods does not necessarily produce different materials. When grafting tin precursors onto mesoporous MCM-41 molecular sieve that would expect to produce tin sites connected to two silyloxy groups, a material with similar sites was obtained as when a tin precursor was employed during the synthesis of the molecular sieve that favored a coordination to four silyloxy groups."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves examining both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The literature does not provide detailed information on the specific mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, including two-site and one-site schemes, linear and cyclic alkane transformations, formation and role of key intermediates, and their impact on reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The focus is on tin sites in zeolites and their Lewis acidity rather than the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides.

In this context, the relevant quotes do not offer sufficient information to answer the question about the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. Further research or a document specifically addressing this topic would be required to provide an accurate answer.

在分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下烷烃裂合的全面机制时，需要考察双位点和单位点方案、线性与环烷烃转换过程、关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其作用，以及这些因素如何影响各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能。

文献并未提供有关由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下烷烃裂合的具体机制，包括双位点和单位点方案、线性与环烷烃转换过程、关键中间体的形成及其作用、以及它们对反应选择性和催化剂性能的影响的详细信息。该文献的重点是关注在沸石中形成的锡位点及其Lewis酸性，而非由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下烷烃裂合的机制。

在这种情况下，相关的引用并未提供足够的信息来回答关于由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下烷烃裂合的机制的问题。需要进一步的研究或专门针对这一主题的文档才能提供准确的答案。
