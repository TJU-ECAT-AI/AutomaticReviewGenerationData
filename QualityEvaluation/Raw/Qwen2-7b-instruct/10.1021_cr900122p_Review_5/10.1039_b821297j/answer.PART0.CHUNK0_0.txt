[1] "The acidity of Sn centers in zeolites depends less on the zeolite structure than on the type of site (A or B)."
[2] "It has been established that synthesizing Sn-containing materials by different direct synthesis or post-synthesis methods does not necessarily produce different materials."
[3] "When grafting tin precursors onto mesoporous MCM-41 molecular sieve that would expect to produce tin sites connected to two silyloxy groups, a material with similar sites was obtained as when a tin precursor was employed during the synthesis of the molecular sieve that favored a coordination to four silyloxy groups."
[4] "On the other hand it has been established that when introducing tin atoms by isomorphous substitution of silicon atoms into a zeolite framework, the resulting sites can possess a different geometry."

The acidity of tin centers in zeolites is more dependent on the type of site (A or B) rather than the zeolite structure itself. Synthesizing tin-containing materials via different direct or post-synthesis methods often yields similar materials. When tin precursors are grafted onto MCM-41 molecular sieves expecting sites connected to two silyloxy groups, materials with similar sites are produced as when tin is incorporated during the synthesis favoring coordination to four silyloxy groups. Introducing tin atoms by isomorphous substitution into a zeolite framework results in sites with differing geometries.

锌中心在沸石中的酸性更多依赖于类型（A或B）而非沸石结构本身。通过不同的直接或后合成方法合成的锡含量材料往往具有相似的性质。当将锡前体嫁接到预期连接两个硅氧基团的MCM-41分子筛上时，产生的材料与在合成过程中偏好与四个硅氧基团配位的锡具有相似的性质。通过等价置换将锡原子引入沸石骨架中，导致形成具有不同几何形状的站点。
