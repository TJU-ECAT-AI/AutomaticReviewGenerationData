<p>The development of isolated and well-defined single-site Lewis acid solid catalysts that are active and selective for new environmentally friendly chemical processes is an urgent need and a challenging scientific target.</p>
<p>Interesting sites for catalytic applications were created when other metal atoms, namely tin atoms, were placed into framework positions of Beta zeolite (Sn-Beta).</p>
<p>Most sites in Sn-Beta zeolite consist of Sn atoms in framework positions coordinated to four silyloxy groups (site A), and that a second type of site consisting of partially hydrolyzed Sn atoms in framework positions (site B) are also present and show a higher catalytic activity.</p>
<p>The Lewis acid properties of these sites have been investigated by means of DFT calculations on model clusters and by IR spectroscopy of probe molecules, and have been related to the experimentally measured catalytic activity of these materials for different reactions.</p>
<p>FTIR spectra of acetonitrile adsorption on Sn-MCM-41 and MCM-41-Sn(OH)2 samples are similar. They show the presence of a broad band centered at 2310 cm−1 due to acetonitrile interaction with Lewis acid sites together with another band at 2272 cm−1 related to acetonitrile interacting with silanol groups.</p>
<p>Attempts were also made to assign the bands appearing at 2298 and 2297 cm−1, following two different working hypotheses.</p>
<p>The results obtained from the DFT and spectroscopic studies indicate that the Sn-Silicalite catalysts can still be improved by converting, at least partly, sites A into sites B or C.</p>

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides requires a detailed examination of the literature provided. However, the specific context for alkane metathesis and silica-supported tantalum hydrides is not directly addressed in the literature. The literature focuses on the study of tin sites in various zeolites, including Beta zeolite, MCM-41, and Silicalite-1, their Lewis acid properties, and their catalytic activities in different reactions such as the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, cyclization of citronellal, and the formation of isopulegol. 

Key insights include:
- Tin sites in zeolites can be classified into types A, B, C, D, and E based on their coordination and Lewis acidity. 
- Sites A consist of tin atoms coordinated to four silyloxy groups, while sites B are partially hydrolyzed SnOSi bridges, showing higher catalytic activity.
- Grafting of tin precursors onto mesoporous MCM-41 results in similar distributions of tin sites as when tin is introduced during the synthesis of the matrix, indicating that the type of site is influenced by the surface morphology of the support during calcination.
- The presence of type A sites can occur through the condensation of a SnOH group formed by oxidation of the alkyl in the grafted material with a silanol group.
- The presence of type B sites can be confirmed by the FTIR spectrum of acetonitrile adsorption, where a band at 2316 cm−1 indicates stronger interaction with the catalyst.
- The activity of tin-containing catalysts depends on the type of sites present, with type B sites contributing significantly to catalytic activity.
- The Sn-Silicalite catalysts can potentially be improved by converting sites A into sites B or C to enhance their catalytic performance.

Given the focus on tin sites rather than silica-supported tantalum hydrides, there is no direct information to construct a detailed mechanism for alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The literature provides a foundation for understanding the behavior of tin-based catalysts in various chemical transformations, which might offer some parallels or insights applicable to other metal-based catalysts like silica-supported tantalum hydrides.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制需要对提供的文献进行详细的考察。然而，关于烷烃裂合和二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的具体背景在文献中并未直接涉及。文献主要研究了β沸石、MCM-41和Silicalite-1中锡位点的性质，包括它们的Lewis酸性及其在不同反应（如Baeyer-Villiger氧化、异丙基醇合成和异薄荷醇形成）中的活性。

关键见解包括：
- 锡位点可以被分类为类型A、B、C、D和E，基于它们的配位和Lewis酸性。
- 类型A位点由与四个硅氧基团配位的锡原子组成，而类型B位点是部分水解的SnOSi桥，显示出更高的催化活性。
- 在MCM-41分子筛上通过嫁接锡前体所得到的锡位点分布与在合成过程中添加的矩阵相似，这表明位点的类型受到支撑表面在煅烧过程中的形态影响。
- 类型A位点可以通过氧化在嫁接材料中的烷基形成的SnOH组分与硅醇基团的缩合来形成。
- 通过乙腈吸附的FTIR光谱可以确认类型B位点的存在，其中2316 cm−1的峰表示与催化剂更强的相互作用。
- 锡含量催化剂的活性取决于存在的位点类型，类型B位点显著贡献到催化活性。
- 可以通过将类型A位点转换为类型B或C来提高Sn-Silicalite催化剂的性能来增强其催化性能。

由于重点放在锡位点而不是二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物上，因此没有直接信息来构建由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的详细机制。文献提供了理解不同化学转变中基于锡的催化剂行为的基础，这可能为其他金属催化剂，如二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物提供一些相关的或可借鉴的见解。
