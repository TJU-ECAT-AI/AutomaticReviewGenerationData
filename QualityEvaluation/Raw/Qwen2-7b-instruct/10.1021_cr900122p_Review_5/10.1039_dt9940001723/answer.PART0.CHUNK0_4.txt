Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the role of both two-site and one-site schemes. The literature highlights the involvement of surface Bronsted-acid sites in the process of grafting the complexes to the surface and/or the formation of surface neopentylidenetungsten complexes. Surface Lewis-acid sites, such as Nb5+, are hypothesized to induce the formation of a tetravalent cationic neopentylidenetungsten(v1) complex, potentially acting as the precursor of the most active species due to its high electronic and coordination unsaturation. Partial reduction of tungsten(VI) is considered, but the mechanism of formation remains unclear. The literature emphasizes the influence of the support on the catalytic properties of the supported catalysts, directing the surface reaction towards specific surface complexes that contribute to the selectivity and performance in alkane conversions.

Key intermediates in the transformation of alkanes to alkenes and metallacyclobutanes include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations are influenced by the support's surface properties, such as the concentration and nature of surface functional groups, which dictate the type of surface complexes formed and their catalytic activity. The literature suggests that the variation in activity of the catalysts with the temperature of dehydroxylation is linked to the formation of cationic tungsten surface complexes, which could explain the observed correlation between catalytic activity and the number of surface Lewis-acid sites.

The catalyst's performance in various alkane conversions is shaped by the interplay between the support's surface characteristics, the nature of the alkane substrate, and the specific surface complexes that form. The literature indicates that the selectivity and efficiency of the metathesis reaction are enhanced by the immobilization and ligand-substitution effects provided by the surface complexes, leading to improved stability and reactivity compared to their molecular counterparts. The detailed mechanisms underlying the transformation of alkanes to alkenes and the formation of metallacyclobutanes are intricately tied to the support's surface chemistry and the specific surface complexes that emerge from the interaction of the alkylidynetungsten(v1) complexes with the inorganic oxide surfaces.
