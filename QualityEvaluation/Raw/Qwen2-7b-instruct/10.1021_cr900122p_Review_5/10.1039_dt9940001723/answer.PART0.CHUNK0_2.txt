Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

1. The reactivity of organometallic complexes with the surface functional groups of amorphous inorganic oxides has been extensively studied. The rules governing this chemistry compare with those of molecular organometallic chemistry.

2. The process of formation of reduced tungsten species is not fully understood. It may result from a reaction of reductive coupling of neopentyl ligands with elimination of 2,2,5,5-tetramethylhexane, a reaction occurring during the synthesis of the complex.

3. The most active catalyst, 1-Nb20,[573], shows a low concentration of poorly exchangeable neopentylidene ligands but the largest amount of reduced [W] surface species.

4. Although the amount of exchangeable neopentylidene is large for 2-Nb20,[573], the catalytic activity of the solid is poor, which correlates to the absence of reduced [W] species.

5. The process of formation of reduced tungsten species may result from a reaction of reductive coupling of neopentyl ligands with elimination of 2,2,5,5-tetramethylhexane, a reaction which can only occur with complex 1 as a precursor during its synthesis.

1. 在过去二十年中，对无定形无机氧化物表面功能基团与有机金属化合物反应性的研究进行了广泛探讨；这类化学规则与分子有机金属化学中的规则相比较为相似。

2. 形成减少钨物种的过程尚未完全理解。这可能源于与消除2,2,5,5-四甲基己烷的反应，该反应仅在复合物的前体1合成过程中发生。

3. 最活跃的催化剂，1-Nb20,[573]，显示出较低浓度的不易交换的丙基二烯物种，但具有最多的减少的[W]表面物种。

4. 尽管2-Nb20,[573]中可交换的丙基二烯物种数量较大，但固体的催化活性较差，这与缺少减少的[W]物种相关联。

5. 形成减少钨物种的过程可能源自与消除2,2,5,5-四甲基己烷的反应，该反应仅在复合物1的合成过程中发生。
