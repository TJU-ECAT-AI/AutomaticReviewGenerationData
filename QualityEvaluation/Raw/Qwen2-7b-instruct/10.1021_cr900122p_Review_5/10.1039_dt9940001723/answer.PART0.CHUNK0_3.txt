[1] "The reactivity of organometallic complexes with the surface functional groups of amorphous inorganic oxides has been extensively studied during the last twenty years; the rules which govern this chemistry compare with those of molecular organometallic chemistry."

[3] "The first step of any reaction of metathesis catalysed by a neopentylidene complex is the reaction of exchange of the neopentylidene ligand by the alkylidene fragment resulting from the olefin."
[4] "The process of formation of such reduced species is not yet fully understood. It may result from a reaction of reductive coupling of neopentyl ligands with elimination of 2,2,5,5-tetramethylhexane [equation (11)], a reaction which can only occur with complex 1 as precursor."
[5] "Niobia, when compared to oxides such as silica-alumina for example, presents very strong Lewis-acid sites in the low-temperature domain (373-573 K) (this occurs only above 773 K for silica-alumina)."
[6] "These studies clearly reveal the influence of the support on the catalytic properties of supported 1 and 2, by orienting the surface reaction preferentially towards one or the other surface complex."

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a series of steps, including the activation of the alkane substrate by the catalyst surface, the formation of reactive intermediates, and the rearrangement to form new alkane products. Both two-site and one-site schemes can be considered, depending on the specific catalyst structure and the reaction conditions. 

In linear alkane transformations, the process typically involves the formation of an alkene intermediate. The key intermediates in this context are alkenes, which are produced through the breaking of a carbon-carbon bond in the alkane substrate and the formation of a new bond with the catalyst. Metallacyclobutanes may also play a role in the mechanism, acting as transition states or intermediates in the reaction pathway.

In cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism is more complex due to the presence of rings. The catalyst can facilitate ring-opening and ring-closing reactions, leading to the formation of new alkane products. The role of key intermediates in cyclic transformations includes the formation of alkene intermediates, which then undergo further rearrangements to yield the final alkane products.

The reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by several factors. These include the nature of the catalyst, the surface properties of the support, the presence of Lewis-acid sites, and the ability of the catalyst to stabilize and activate the alkane substrate. The formation of reduced species, such as the tetravalent cationic neopentylidenetungsten(v1) complex, can enhance the catalyst performance by providing a co-ordinatively and electronically unsaturated active site. The orientation of the surface reaction towards one or the other surface complex, as influenced by the support properties, can also impact the reaction pathways and product selectivity.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation and activation of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and the stabilization of reactive intermediates through the coordination of Lewis-acid sites. The catalyst performance and product selectivity are influenced by the nature of the catalyst, the support properties, and the reaction conditions.

分析硅负载钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的全面机制，讨论双位点和单位点方案，线性和环状烷烃转化过程涉及的步骤，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其在反应选择性和催化剂性能中的作用。

硅负载钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的全面机制涉及一系列步骤，包括底物烷烃的催化剂表面活化、活性中间体的形成以及重组以生成新的烷烃产物。根据特定催化剂结构和反应条件的不同，可以考虑两种位点和单一位点方案。

在线性烷烃转换中，过程通常涉及烷烃中间体的形成。在此上下文中，关键中间体是烯烃，它们通过在烷烃底物中断裂碳-碳键并形成与催化剂的新键而产生。金属环丁烷也可能在机制中发挥作用，作为过渡态或反应途径中的中间体。

在环状烷烃转换中，由于环的存在，机制更为复杂。催化剂可以促进环的开环和闭合反应，导致新烷烃产物的形成。在环状转换中，关键中间体的作用包括形成烯烃中间体，然后进一步重新排列以生成最终的烷烃产物。

各种烷烃转换的选择性和催化剂性能受到多种因素的影响。这些因素包括催化剂的性质、支持表面的特性、Lewis酸位点的存在以及催化剂激活烷烃底物的能力。通过形成还原物种，如四价的二聚化钨(v1)复合物，可以增强催化剂性能，因为它提供了配位上未饱和且电子上未饱和的活性位点。支持反应向一个或另一个表面复合物的方向导向，由支持特性影响，也会影响反应途径和产物选择性。

简而言之，硅负载钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的机制涉及关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和激活，以及通过Lewis酸位点稳定活性中间体。催化剂性能和产物选择性受到催化剂性质、支持特性和反应条件的影响。
