[1] "Among the objectives of such studies is the synthesis of surface-anchored complexes with a predefined co-ordination sphere."
[2] "The most active solids resulted from the interaction o f these complexes with the surface o f partially dehydroxylated niobia and silica-alumina."
[3] "The possible correlation between catalytic activity and some o f the most probable surface entities i s discussed."
[4] "The reactivity of organometallic complexes with the surface functional groups of amorphous inorganic oxides has been extensively studied during the last twenty years; the rules which govern this chemistry compare with those of molecular organometallic chemistry."
[5] "Stability and/or chemical reactivity of the anchored complexes may thus be enhanced, when compared to their molecular counterparts, by immobilization and/or ligand- substitution effects."
[6] "The first reaction must result in the anchoring of the complex to the surface; this may occur via an alkyl or another ligand (electrophilic attack by a surface proton)."
[7] "The reactivity of the two alkylidynetungsten complexes, [W(=CCMe,) (CH,CMe,),] and [W(-CCMe,) - Cl,(dme)] (dme = 1 ,2-dimethoxyethane), was determined with the surface o f different inorganic oxides,such as silica, alumina, silica-alumina and niobia;"
[8] "We wish to report here our approach to the synthesis of supported tungsten-based molecular complexes, catalysts for the reaction of olefin metathesis."
[9] "The formation of neopentane or HCl as the result of the complex-support interaction indicates that at least one type of chemical reaction takes place, which must be an electrophilic attack of surface protons on an X ligand."
[10] "The process of formation of such reduced species is not yet fully understood. It may result from a reaction of reductive coupling of neopentyl ligands with elimination of 2,2,5,5-tetramethylhexane [equation (1 l)], a reaction which can only occur with complex 1 as precursor;"

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.
