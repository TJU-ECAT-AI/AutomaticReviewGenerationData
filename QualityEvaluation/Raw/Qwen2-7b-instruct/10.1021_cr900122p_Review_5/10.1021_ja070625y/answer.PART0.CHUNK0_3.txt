Understanding d0-olefin metathesis catalysts involves identifying the appropriate metal and ligands. The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides employs both two-site and one-site schemes. Linear and cyclic alkane transformations necessitate precise conditions for optimal performance. Alkenes and metallacyclobutanes act as pivotal intermediates in the reaction process. The catalyst's selectivity and performance in various alkane conversions are significantly influenced by the formation and role of these intermediates.
