Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, two alkyl groups are transferred from one alkene to another, while in the one-site mechanism, a single alkene undergoes internal hydrogen shift. Linear alkane transformations often involve the addition of an alkene to a saturated alkane, followed by metathesis, whereas cyclic alkane transformations typically result in the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate. Key intermediates in this process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by factors such as the metal type, ligand structure, and substrate specificity.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制涉及理解两种主要机制：双位点方案和单位点方案。在双位点机制中，两个烷基团从一个烯烃转移到另一个。而在单一机制中，一个单烯烃经历内部氢转移。线性烷烃转换通常涉及将一个烯烃添加到饱和烷烃中，随后进行裂合。而环烷烃转换通常会导致形成金属环丁烷中间体。此过程的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。反应选择性和催化剂性能受金属类型、配体结构和底物特异性等因素的影响。
