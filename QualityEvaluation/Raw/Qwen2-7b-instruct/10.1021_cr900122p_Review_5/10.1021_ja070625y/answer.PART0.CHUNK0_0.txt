Understanding the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves analyzing both two-site and one-site schemes. This process critically examines the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes, focusing on the formation and role of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These elements greatly impact the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
