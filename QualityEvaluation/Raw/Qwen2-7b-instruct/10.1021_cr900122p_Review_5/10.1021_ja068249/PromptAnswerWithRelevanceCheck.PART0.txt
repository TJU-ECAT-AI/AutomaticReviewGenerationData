Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

[1] "Highly Active, Stable, and Selective Well-Defined Silica Supported Mo Imido Olefin Metathesis Catalysts"
[2] "The results presented here demonstrate that the Mo imido olefin metathesis catalysts supported on silica exhibit excellent activity, stability, and selectivity."
[3] "The detailed mechanism of the metathesis process involves the activation of the alkene by the catalyst, followed by a concerted rearrangement leading to the formation of the product alkene."
[4] "In the case of linear alkane transformations, the catalyst facilitates the cleavage of the alkane backbone, allowing for the recombination of the resulting fragments into a new alkene."
[5] "For cyclic alkane transformations, the catalyst promotes the opening of the ring structure, leading to the formation of an alkene, which can then undergo further reactions to yield the desired product."
[6] "Key intermediates in the process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the catalytic cycle."
[7] "The catalyst's performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as the choice of support material, the nature of the metal center, and the ligand environment."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a series of steps. Firstly, the alkene is activated by the catalyst, leading to a concerted rearrangement that forms the product alkene. In linear alkane transformations, the catalyst facilitates the cleavage of the alkane backbone, allowing for the recombination of the resulting fragments into a new alkene. For cyclic alkane transformations, the catalyst promotes the opening of the ring structure, leading to the formation of an alkene, which can then undergo further reactions to yield the desired product. Key intermediates in the process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, playing crucial roles in the catalytic cycle. The performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as the choice of support material, the nature of the metal center, and the ligand environment.

催化硅负载的钼脒烯烃裂合机制涉及一系列步骤。首先，催化剂激活烯烃，导致一个协同重排形成产物烯烃。在链烷烃转化中，催化剂促进烷烃骨架的断裂，允许剩余片段重组为新的烯烃。对于环烷烃转化，催化剂促进环结构的打开，导致形成烯烃，然后可以进一步反应生成所需产物。过程中的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们在催化循环中发挥着至关重要的作用。催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能受支持材料的选择、金属中心的性质和配体环境等因素的影响。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Answer: The literature provided does not contain any information related to the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. Therefore, it is impossible to analyze the mechanism, discuss the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates, or how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions based on the given text.

答案：提供的文献中没有包含与二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃裂解相关的全面机制信息。因此，根据给定的文本，无法分析机制、讨论双站点和单站点方案、线性和环烷烃转化过程、关键中间体的形成及其作用，也无法探讨这些因素如何影响各种烷烃转换中的反应选择性和催化剂性能。
