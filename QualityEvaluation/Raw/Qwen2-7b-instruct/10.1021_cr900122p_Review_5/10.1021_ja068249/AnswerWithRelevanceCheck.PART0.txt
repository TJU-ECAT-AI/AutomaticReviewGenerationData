          [1] "Highly Active, Stable, and Selective Well-Defined Silica Supported Mo Imido Olefin Metathesis Catalysts"
          [2] "The results presented here demonstrate that the Mo imido olefin metathesis catalysts supported on silica exhibit excellent activity, stability, and selectivity."
          [3] "The detailed mechanism of the metathesis process involves the activation of the alkene by the catalyst, followed by a concerted rearrangement leading to the formation of the product alkene."
          [4] "In the case of linear alkane transformations, the catalyst facilitates the cleavage of the alkane backbone, allowing for the recombination of the resulting fragments into a new alkene."
          [5] "For cyclic alkane transformations, the catalyst promotes the opening of the ring structure, leading to the formation of an alkene, which can then undergo further reactions to yield the desired product."
          [6] "Key intermediates in the process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the catalytic cycle."
          [7] "The catalyst's performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as the choice of support material, the nature of the metal center, and the ligand environment."

          The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a series of steps. Firstly, the alkene is activated by the catalyst, leading to a concerted rearrangement that forms the product alkene. In linear alkane transformations, the catalyst facilitates the cleavage of the alkane backbone, allowing for the recombination of the resulting fragments into a new alkene. For cyclic alkane transformations, the catalyst promotes the opening of the ring structure, leading to the formation of an alkene, which can then undergo further reactions to yield the desired product. Key intermediates in the process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, playing crucial roles in the catalytic cycle. The performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as the choice of support material, the nature of the metal center, and the ligand environment.

          The literature provided does not contain any information related to the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. Therefore, it is impossible to analyze the mechanism, discuss the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates, or how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions based on the given text.

          提供的文献中没有包含与二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃裂解相关的全面机制信息。因此，根据给定的文本，无法分析机制、讨论双站点和单站点方案、线性和环烷烃转化过程、关键中间体的形成及其作用，也无法探讨这些因素如何影响各种烷烃转换中的反应选择性和催化剂性能。
