Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides requires a detailed examination of the literature provided. However, the specific details regarding the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are not explicitly covered in the document. The document focuses more on the scope of the journal, its aim to promote the development of advanced synthesis and catalysis, and the types of research it publishes rather than the specific mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. Therefore, a thorough analysis of the comprehensive mechanism as requested cannot be provided based on the information given.
