The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, linear alkane molecules are activated at one site of the catalyst, forming an alkene intermediate. This alkene then migrates to another site where it undergoes a concerted rearrangement to form a metallacyclobutane. In the one-site mechanism, the activation and rearrangement occur at the same site. The key intermediates in these processes are the activated alkene and the metallacyclobutane, which play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. These factors contribute to various alkane conversions by controlling the reaction pathways and product distribution, thus enabling efficient and selective alkane metathesis transformations.

催化作用下由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃裂合机制涉及两个站点和一个站点的方案。在双站点机制中，线性烷烃分子在催化剂的一个站点被激活，形成一个烯烃中间体。该烯烃随后迁移到另一个站点，在那里经历协同重排形成金属环丁烷。在单站点机制中，激活和重排发生在同一站点。这些过程的关键中间体是激活的烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们在决定反应选择性和催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。这些因素通过控制反应途径和产物分布，从而实现高效的和选择性的烷烃裂合转化，从而促进各种烷烃转换。
