Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes. This type of catalysis facilitates alkane transformations, including linear and cyclic ones, through the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. The role of these intermediates in the reaction pathway contributes significantly to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. The process is complex, involving intricate interactions between the silica-supported tantalum hydrides and the alkane substrates, which lead to the desired alkane rearrangements and alkene formations. The catalyst's ability to efficiently convert alkane molecules into different products showcases its potential in chemical synthesis and industry applications.
