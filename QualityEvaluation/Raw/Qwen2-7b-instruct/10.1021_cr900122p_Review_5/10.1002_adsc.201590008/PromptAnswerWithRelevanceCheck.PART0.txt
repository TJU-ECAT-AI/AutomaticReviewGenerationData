The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, linear alkane molecules are activated at one site of the catalyst, forming an alkene intermediate. This alkene then migrates to another site where it undergoes a concerted rearrangement to form a metallacyclobutane. In the one-site mechanism, the activation and rearrangement occur at the same site. The key intermediates in these processes are the activated alkene and the metallacyclobutane, which play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. These factors contribute to various alkane conversions by controlling the reaction pathways and product distribution, thus enabling efficient and selective alkane metathesis transformations.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, the catalyst facilitates the exchange of alkyl groups between two different alkane molecules, leading to the formation of two new alkane products. In the one-site scheme, the catalyst allows for the rearrangement of an alkane molecule, converting it into a more stable form. This process typically involves the activation of an alkane by the catalyst, the formation of an alkene intermediate, and the subsequent recombination of the alkene to form a new alkane product. Key intermediates in this process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The formation of these intermediates and their subsequent recombination contribute to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The catalyst's ability to control the orientation and position of the alkyl groups during the metathesis reaction is crucial for achieving high selectivity and efficiency in alkane transformations.
