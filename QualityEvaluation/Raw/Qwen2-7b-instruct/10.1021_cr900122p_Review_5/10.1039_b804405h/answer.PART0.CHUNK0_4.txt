The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a series of steps that lead to the transformation of alkanes into alkenes and back through the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The mechanism includes two-site and one-site schemes, with linear and cyclic alkane transformations playing pivotal roles in the process. The catalyst's selectivity and performance in various alkane conversions are significantly influenced by the formation and role of these intermediates. 

Silica-supported tantalum hydrides facilitate the alkane metathesis reactions by providing an active surface that enables the effective interaction between the alkane molecules and the catalyst. The process involves the breaking of C-C bonds within the alkane molecule, followed by the rearrangement of the carbon atoms to form new C-C bonds, resulting in the creation of alkenes. The key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play critical roles in the reaction pathways, affecting the overall efficiency and selectivity of the conversion. 

The catalyst's performance is optimized by controlling factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of specific reactants like hydrogen or other reducing agents. The ability to perform the reaction at moderate temperatures, such as 25°C, while maintaining high turnover numbers (TON) indicates the efficiency and stability of the catalyst. The use of water as a solvent is preferred over organic solvents due to its inertness, green nature, and biological relevance, which further enhances the catalyst's performance and environmental sustainability.

The recycling capability of the catalyst, as demonstrated by retaining its catalytic activity in multiple cycles, is another crucial aspect of its performance. This feature reduces the need for frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement, contributing to the economic viability and practical applicability of the catalyst in industrial alkane metathesis processes. 

The detailed mechanism and factors influencing the alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involve intricate interactions between the catalyst, reactants, and the formation of key intermediates. These interactions are carefully controlled to achieve optimal selectivity, efficiency, and environmental compatibility in alkane conversion processes.
