[1] "A stable l-nitrido diiron phthalocyanine activates H2O2 to oxidize CH4 in water at 2560 1C to methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid as evidenced using 13C and 18O labelling."
[2] "The addition of H2O2 to a solution of (FePctBu4)2N changed UVVis and EPR spectra."
[3] "After addition of H2O2 at 25 1C we detected a strong signal at g = 4.25 and a feature at g = 8.16 along with an enlarged signal at g = 2.07 and a small signal at g = 1.99 of the (FePctBu4)2N left."
[4] "We have observed that (FePctBu4)2N interacts with biologi- cally and ecologically relevant H2O2."
[5] "The diiron structure was kept intact as evidenced by positive electrospray ionization mass spectro- metry (ESI-MS)."
[6] "The catalytic oxidation of CH4 occurred with a high turnover number of 40.8."
[7] "The best solution to avoid uncertainties due to solvent oxidation is to use water, an inert, green and biologically relevant solvent."
[8] "When the mixture of 53% of CH4 and 47% of 13CH4 was used for oxidation, the 13C NMR spectrum of the final reaction mixture showed two signals at 81.6 and 165.5 ppm attributed to hydrated formaldehyde 13CH2(OH)2 and H13COOH, respecti- vely."
[9] "The oxidation of CH4 was still efficient even at 25 1C, providing HCOOH with TON = 13 (Table 1, run 1)."
[10] "The heterolytic cleavage of the OO bond in FeIVNFeIIIOOH complex and the formation of putative very strong oxidizing FeIVNFeVQO species should be favoured in the presence of acid by the protonation of peroxide oxygen."
[11] "The catalyst exhibits a very high perfor- mance: more than 150 moles CH4 per mole of catalyst were oxidized to useful products."
[12] "This catalytic system shows several attrac- tive features: the clean oxidant (H2O2) and reaction medium (H2O), and the fact that solid catalyst can easily be separated by filtration."
[13] "The worldwide production of phthalocyanines is estimated to be more than 80 000 tons per year: D. Wohrle, Macromol. Rapid Commun., 2001, 22, 68."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides requires information not present in the provided literature. The document focuses on the oxidation of methane by a specific iron phthalocyanine complex in aqueous solutions. Therefore, it does not cover the topic of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, and hence, no relevant quotes can be extracted from the literature for this question.

对于由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃裂解的全面机制进行分析需要文献中没有的信息。该文档主要关注特定铁酞菁复合物在水溶液中氧化甲烷的过程。因此，文献中没有关于由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃裂解的相关信息，因此无法从文献中提取与这个问题相关的问题。
