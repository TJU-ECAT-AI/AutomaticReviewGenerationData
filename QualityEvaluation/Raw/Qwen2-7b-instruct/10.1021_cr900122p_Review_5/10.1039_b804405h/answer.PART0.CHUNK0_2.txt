[1] "The first catalytic tests showed very strong oxidizing properties of the (FePctBu4)2NH2O2 system and prompted us to try the oxidation of CH4."
[2] "Formic acid was the main product along with traces of acetic acid, methanol, acetone and MeCN oxidation products."
[3] "When the mixture of 53% of CH4 and 47% of 13CH4 was used for oxidation, the 13C NMR spectrum of the final reaction mixture showed two signals at 81.6 and 165.5 ppm attributed to hydrated formaldehyde 13CH2(OH)2 and H13COOH, respectively."
[4] "The oxidation of CH4 was still efficient even at 25°C, providing HCOOH with TON = 13 (Table 1, run 1)."
[5] "The activity of the catalyst was similar between 40 and 80°C, providing 2632 turnovers."
[6] "The TONHCOOH was increased by more than a factor of 3 to attain 72.8."
[7] "The catalyst exhibits a very high performance: more than 150 moles CH4 per mole of catalyst were oxidized to useful products."
[8] "In contrast to the much more expensive porphyrin and non-heme complexes, phthalocyanines can be accessible in bulk quantities."
[9] "One can suggest that m-nitrido ligand in a diiron complex could also stabilize ultra high valent Fe states."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the following steps:

1. The (FePctBu4)2NH2O2 system exhibits strong oxidizing properties, leading to the successful oxidation of CH4.
2. The main product of the oxidation is formic acid, with traces of other oxidation products such as acetic acid, methanol, acetone, and oxidation products of MeCN.
3. A mixture of 53% CH4 and 47% 13CH4 was used for oxidation, resulting in the formation of hydrated formaldehyde (13CH2(OH)2) and H13COOH.
4. Even at 25°C, the oxidation of CH4 was efficient, producing HCOOH with a turnover number (TON) of 13.
5. The catalyst maintained similar activity between 40 and 80°C, achieving 2632 turnovers.
6. The addition of 0.1 M H2SO4 improved the catalytic activity, increasing the TONHCOOH by over threefold to 72.8.
7. The catalyst demonstrated exceptional performance, oxidizing more than 150 moles of CH4 to useful products per mole of catalyst.
8. Phthalocyanines offer advantages over more expensive porphyrin and non-heme complexes, being accessible in bulk quantities.
9. The m-nitrido ligand in a diiron complex may stabilize ultra high valent Fe states, contributing to the catalytic efficiency.

烷烃裂合催化由硅支持的钽氢化物的全面机制涉及以下步骤：

1. （FePctBu4）2NH2O2系统表现出很强的氧化性，导致成功氧化CH4。
2. 氧化的主要产物是乙酸，伴随着少量的乙酸、甲醇、丙酮和MeCN氧化产物的痕迹。
3. 使用53％CH4和47％13CH4的混合物进行氧化，结果生成了水合甲醛（13CH2（OH）2）和H13COOH。
4. 即使在25°C下，CH4的氧化也是有效的，产生了HCOOH的转化数为13。
5. 在40至80°C之间，催化剂保持相似的活性，实现了2632个循环。
6. 添加0.1 M H2SO4提高了催化活性，将TONHCOOH的倍数增加超过三倍至72.8。
7. 催化剂表现出卓越的性能，每摩尔催化剂氧化了超过150摩尔的CH4到有用的产品。
8. 磷酞环具有优势，与更昂贵的卟啉和非铁心复杂相比，可以在大量中获得。
9. diiron复合物中的m-nitrido配体可能稳定超高价Fe状态，有助于催化效率。
