<EnglishVersionAnswer>
At low temperatures (below 473 K), the thermolytic conversion of these molecular species to three-dimensional networks happens through the removal of isobutene and H2O (after condensation of the resulting hydroxyl groups). When thermolysis is conducted in nonpolar solvents, such as toluene or n-octane, a solvent-bound gel is typically produced. Although both the sol-gel process and the TMP method utilize low-temperature pathways to create metastable materials, the TMP method provides several benefits.

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes, processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

Silica-supported tantalum hydrides can exhibit both two-site and one-site mechanisms for alkane metathesis. In the two-site mechanism, two different regions of the catalyst surface are involved in the reaction, facilitating the transfer of alkyl groups between the two sites to form new alkane molecules. In the one-site mechanism, the same active site undergoes sequential steps to effect the alkane metathesis reaction. Both mechanisms rely on the presence of active sites that can facilitate the breaking and forming of alkyl bonds.

Linear alkane transformations involve the rearrangement of alkyl groups along the carbon chain to form new alkane molecules. Cyclic alkane transformations, on the other hand, involve the opening and closing of rings through the metathesis reaction, leading to the formation of new cyclic alkane molecules. Key intermediates in the process include alkenes, which are formed during the breaking of alkyl bonds, and metallacyclobutanes, which are intermediates in the formation of new cyclic alkane molecules.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions are influenced by the catalyst's structure, including the surface area, homogeneity, and distribution of active sites. The thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method, which employs metal complexes containing oxygen-rich ligands, is a preferred approach for synthesizing catalysts with optimized properties. The TMP method allows for precise control over the stoichiometry, nanostructure, homogeneity, and catalyst site structure, leading to improved performance compared to traditional aqueous or solgel synthesis methods.

One significant advantage of the TMP method is its use of nonaqueous solvents, which minimize pore collapse upon drying and preserve high pore volumes and surface areas. This results in catalysts with superior properties for alkane metathesis. The method also facilitates the introduction of well-defined active sites onto the surface of the catalyst, contributing to high selectivity and performance in alkane conversions.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides, when synthesized using the TMP method, can exhibit enhanced catalytic performance due to the precise control over the structure of the active sites and the catalyst support. This leads to improved alkane metathesis activity and selectivity, making the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalysts highly effective for alkane conversions.

The catalysts' performance is further enhanced by the introduction of isolated catalytic sites, such as isolated titanium and iron sites, onto the surface of the support through the molecular precursor grafting methodology. These isolated sites maintain their tetrahedral coordination geometry, ensuring high stability and selectivity in alkane metathesis reactions.

In conclusion, the silica-supported tantalum hydrides, synthesized using the TMP method, exhibit a comprehensive mechanism for alkane metathesis, encompassing both two-site and one-site schemes, linear and cyclic alkane transformations, and the formation of key intermediates. The catalysts' high performance is attributed to the precise control over structure, including the surface area, homogeneity, and distribution of active sites, leading to improved selectivity and performance in alkane conversions.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, linear alkane undergoes a concerted rearrangement to form a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which then rearranges to produce a new alkene and regenerate the catalyst. This process is reversible, allowing for the formation of both cis- and trans-alkenes. In the one-site scheme, a single site on the catalyst facilitates the formation of a carbene, which abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane to form an alkene, and then the catalyst regenerates. The formation of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, plays a crucial role in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The selectivity is influenced by factors such as the type of alkane, the presence of functional groups, and the reaction conditions. The one-site scheme tends to favor the formation of cis-alkenes, while the two-site scheme can lead to both cis- and trans-alkenes. The catalyst performance is optimized through careful control of parameters such as the catalyst loading, reaction temperature, and the nature of the support material.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, the reaction proceeds through the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which act as key intermediates. In the one-site scheme, the catalyst undergoes a series of steps including the formation of alkenes and the subsequent rearrangement to produce the desired alkane. The processes involve the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds and the formation of new ones. The formation and role of these intermediates contribute to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

In terms of selectivity and performance, the use of well-defined molecular precursors in the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method allows control over the stoichiometry, nanostructure, homogeneity, and catalyst site structure. This method facilitates the production of catalytic materials that exhibit enhanced performance compared to those obtained by more traditional routes. The use of nonaqueous solvents in catalyst syntheses can be beneficial, as water often influences the structures that form. The precursors serve as molecular models for oxide-supported catalytic sites, given their MOE heterolinkages and their oxygen-rich nature. The TMP method has been demonstrated to produce catalysts that outperform related catalysts obtained by conventional methods, suggesting that molecular precursor methods will contribute significantly to the development of new generations of catalysts and support materials.

In the context of alkane metathesis, the TMP method enables the preparation of highly active catalysts with tailored properties. The silica-supported tantalum hydrides, when synthesized using the TMP method, exhibit superior performance in alkane metathesis reactions. The enhanced performance is attributed to the controlled structure of the catalyst, the presence of well-defined active sites, and the efficient utilization of the precursor molecules. The use of the TMP method offers several advantages, such as precise control over the stoichiometry and structure of the catalyst, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity in alkane conversions.

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, two different sites on the catalyst surface participate in the reaction, while in the one-site scheme, the same site undergoes sequential reactions. The processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations typically include the formation of alkenes through breaking of alkane bonds and the formation of new alkane bonds. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes play crucial roles in these reactions. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the formation and stabilization of these intermediates, the reactivity of the catalyst sites, and the kinetic barriers for different reaction pathways.

The role of silica-supported tantalum hydrides in alkane metathesis and alkane hydrogenolysis is exemplified by the work of Basset and co-workers. These catalysts are prepared using surface organometallic chemistry, which allows for the creation of highly active sites capable of efficiently catalyzing alkane transformations. The presence of MOSi heterolinkages in the materials derived from the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method contributes to their high acidity, which is essential for promoting alkane metathesis reactions. Different precursors, such as those containing Al[OSi(O tBu)3]3(HO iPr) · 1 4[Al(O iPr)3]4 and [(O iPr)2AlOSi(O tBu)3]2, result in materials with varying microstructures and surface acidities, demonstrating the profound influence of the precursor chemistry on the properties of the final catalyst.

Efforts to optimize catalyst performance often involve the use of precursors with higher surface areas. This allows for more efficient utilization of the catalytic sites and can lead to improved selectivities and activities. For instance, the use of the precursor [(tBuO)3SiO]2Al[-O2P(O tBu)2]2Al(Me)OSi(O tBu)3 in the synthesis of silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) materials not only enhances the structure control over the catalyst but also provides a model for microporous SAPOs. These catalysts can exhibit superior performance in alkane conversions due to the precise control over the structures of catalytic sites, the use of nonaqueous solvents that minimize the influence of water, and the presence of oxygen-rich siloxide ligands that stabilize the catalyst sites and hinder ion mobility.

The catalytic performance of silica-supported tantalum hydrides in alkane metathesis and hydrogenolysis is further highlighted by their ability to selectively produce alkenes and metabolites with high yields. The selectivities and activities achieved with these catalysts surpass or match those of other heterogeneous iron-based catalysts, indicating their potential for efficient alkane conversions. In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the strategic use of surface organometallic chemistry, the precise control over the structures of catalytic sites, and the optimization of reaction conditions to achieve high selectivities and activities in various alkane conversions.

烷基交换催化由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的全面机制涉及理解双站点和单站点方案。在双站点方案中，催化剂表面的两个不同位点参与反应，而在单站点方案中，相同的位点进行连续反应。线性和环烷烃转换过程通常包括通过断裂烷烃键形成烯烃，并形成新的烷烃键。关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷在这些反应中发挥着至关重要的作用。催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能受中间体的形成和稳定、催化剂位点的反应活性以及不同反应途径的势垒等因素的影响。

由Basset及其同事制备的二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物在烷基交换和烷基氢解中起着重要作用。这些催化剂是通过表面有机金属化学制备的，允许高效地催化烷基转换，产生高度活跃的位点。在热力学分子前体（TMP）方法衍生的材料中，MOSi异质连接的存在导致其高酸性，这对于促进烷基交换反应至关重要。不同的前体，如包含Al[OSi(O tBu)3]3(HO iPr) · 1 4[Al(O iPr)3]4和[(O iPr)2AlOSi(O tBu)3]2的材料，显示出微结构和表面酸性各不相同，这表明前体化学对最终催化剂性质的深远影响。

为了优化催化剂性能，经常采用具有更高比表面积的前体。这使得催化位点的有效利用更加高效，并可能导致更高的选择性和活动性。例如，使用[(tBuO)3SiO]2Al[-O2P(O tBu)2]2Al(Me)OSi(O tBu)3前体合成硅铝磷（SAPO）材料不仅提高了结构控制能力，而且提供了微孔SAPO的模型。这些催化剂由于对催化位点结构的精确控制、非水溶剂的使用（这些溶剂可以最小化水的影响）、以及稳定催化剂位点并阻止离子移动的氧丰富硅氧化合物配体，表现出优越的烷烃转化性能。

二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物在烷基交换和氢解中的催化性能进一步体现了它们能够以高产率选择性地产生烯烃和代谢产物的能力。这些催化剂在烷烃转化中的选择性和活动性超过了其他基于铁的异质催化剂，表明它们有潜力实现高效的烷烃转化。总之，烷基交换催化由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的全面机制涉及表面有机金属化学的战略使用、催化位点结构的精确控制以及优化反应条件，以实现各种烷烃转化中的高选择性和活动性。
