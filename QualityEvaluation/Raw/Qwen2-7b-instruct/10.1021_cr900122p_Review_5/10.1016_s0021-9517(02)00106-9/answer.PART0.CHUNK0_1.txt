[1] "Many synthetic challenges are presented by established structurereactivity relationships and by well-recognized goals in catalysis research. This is particularly true for heterogeneous catalysts, since synthetic control over the structures of complex solids is still rather limited."
[2] "For multicomponent catalysts of this kind, optimum performance should result from maximization of surface area, homogeneity, and active site distribution."
[3] "In synthesizing a variety of multicomponent oxide materials with tailored properties, we have employed a molecular building-block approach referred to as the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method [5583]."
[4] "Key comparisons have been made to materials of the same composition that were prepared by more traditional aqueous or solgel procedures."
[5] "The TMP method for materials synthesis works well for precursors of the type M[OSi(O tBu)3]4 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf), which convert cleanly to carbon-free materials with the formula MO2 · 4SiO2."
[6] "For the most part, these efforts have involved modifications of the solgel synthesis of oxides [1012,31]; however, this approach is limited by the inherently different rates of hydrolysis for alkoxide precursors (e.g., M(OR)n and M(OR)m)."
[7] "This approach includes what may be described as surface organometallic chemistry, which has been used by Basset and co-workers to prepare highly active catalysts for alkane metathesis and alkane hydrogenolysis [4045]."
[8] "The thermolytic conversion of these molecular species to three-dimensional networks occurs via elimination of isobutene and H2O (after condensation of the resulting hydroxyl groups)."
[9] "When the thermolyses are performed in nonpolar solvents (e.g.,toluene or n-octane), a solvent-containing gel is often obtained."
[10] "Although the solgel process and the TMP method both represent low-temperature routes to metastable materials,the TMP method offers several advantages."
[11] "Other groups have developed so-called nonhydrolytic routes to oxide materials, including the condensation of metal alkoxides with metal acetates [84] or metal halides [85]."
[12] "This was illustrated, for example, by the fact that Al2O3 · 2SiO2 materials derived from Al[OSi(O tBu)3]3(HO iPr) · 1 4[Al(O iPr)3]4 and [(O iPr)2AlOSi(O tBu)3]2 (both with Al/Si = 1) have quite different microstructures and surface acidities."
[13] "The presence of a large number of MOSi heterolinkages in these ZrO2 · 4SiO2 xerogels would be expected to give rise to a highly acidic material."
[14] "The thermal conversion of complexes containing M OSi(O tBu)3 and MO2P(O tBu)2 moieties appears to be catalyzed by Brnsted acids [67,76]."
[15] "In studies on use of the TMP method for generation of amorphous aluminosilicates, an important class of solid acid materials, the chemical nature of the precursor has a profound influence on the properties of the resultant solid."
[16] "High-surface-areamagnesiasilica xerogels (245 m2 g1) and aerogels (640 m2 g1) with the composition MgO · 2SiO2 were generated from the single-source molecular precursor Mg[OSi(O tBu)3]2 using TMP methods [68]."
[17] "Pre- vious predictions and experimental evidence for high-SiO2- content magnesiasilica materials suggested that the number of acid sites for the mixed oxide would be larger for a more homogeneous material [87]."
[18] "In general, it seems that the TMP method is useful for generating homogeneously dispersed metal sites in an amorphous SiO2 support matrix [5773]."
[19] "For example, during the grafting reaction both tBuOH and HOSi(O tBu)3 were observed as reaction products, suggesting the presence of two different (but closely related) types of surface species, although elimination of HOSi(O tBu)3 was the major pathway in all cases."
[20] "The majority of the iron sites maintain their isolated state with tetrahedral coordination geometry."
[21] "Thus, this precursor method appears to provide a reliable route to well-defined, isolated, and stable iron centers."
[22] "Calcined FeSBA-15 materials (573 K, 2 h, O2) were investigated as catalysts for the partial oxidation of various hydrocarbons using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant."
[23] "Oxidation of benzene at 60 C by a 0.50 wt% Fe catalyst resulted in the production of phenol with 100% selectivity after 96 h at 42% hydrogen peroxide conversion and 7.5% benzene conversion."
[24] "The oxidation of toluene at 333 K using a FeSBA-15 catalyst (1.90 wt% iron) produced benzaldehyde (32%) and cresol (a mixture of ortho and para isomers totaling 68%)."
[25] "Interestingly, the activities of these catalysts (on a per-site basis) do not vary with iron loading."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes, processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

Silica-supported tantalum hydrides can exhibit both two-site and one-site mechanisms for alkane metathesis. In the two-site mechanism, two different regions of the catalyst surface are involved in the reaction, facilitating the transfer of alkyl groups between the two sites to form new alkane molecules. In the one-site mechanism, the same active site undergoes sequential steps to effect the alkane metathesis reaction. Both mechanisms rely on the presence of active sites that can facilitate the breaking and forming of alkyl bonds.

Linear alkane transformations involve the rearrangement of alkyl groups along the carbon chain to form new alkane molecules. Cyclic alkane transformations, on the other hand, involve the opening and closing of rings through the metathesis reaction, leading to the formation of new cyclic alkane molecules. Key intermediates in the process include alkenes, which are formed during the breaking of alkyl bonds, and metallacyclobutanes, which are intermediates in the formation of new cyclic alkane molecules.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions are influenced by the catalyst's structure, including the surface area, homogeneity, and distribution of active sites. The thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method, which employs metal complexes containing oxygen-rich ligands, is a preferred approach for synthesizing catalysts with optimized properties. The TMP method allows for precise control over the stoichiometry, nanostructure, homogeneity, and catalyst site structure, leading to improved performance compared to traditional aqueous or solgel synthesis methods.

One significant advantage of the TMP method is its use of nonaqueous solvents, which minimize pore collapse upon drying and preserve high pore volumes and surface areas. This results in catalysts with superior properties for alkane metathesis. The method also facilitates the introduction of well-defined active sites onto the surface of the catalyst, contributing to high selectivity and performance in alkane conversions.

The silica-supported tantalum hydrides, when synthesized using the TMP method, can exhibit enhanced catalytic performance due to the precise control over the structure of the active sites and the catalyst support. This leads to improved alkane metathesis activity and selectivity, making the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalysts highly effective for alkane conversions.

The catalysts' performance is further enhanced by the introduction of isolated catalytic sites, such as isolated titanium and iron sites, onto the surface of the support through the molecular precursor grafting methodology. These isolated sites maintain their tetrahedral coordination geometry, ensuring high stability and selectivity in alkane metathesis reactions.

In conclusion, the silica-supported tantalum hydrides, synthesized using the TMP method, exhibit a comprehensive mechanism for alkane metathesis, encompassing both two-site and one-site schemes, linear and cyclic alkane transformations, and the formation of key intermediates. The catalysts' high performance is attributed to the precise control over structure, including the surface area, homogeneity, and distribution of active sites, leading to improved selectivity and performance in alkane conversions.
