[1] "The results from these studies are potentially quite valuable in leading us to new generations of catalysts, since they provide structurereactivity correlations that can be used in catalysis design."
[2] "Future advances in catalysis research will also be driven by the development of new synthetic methodologies, which allow the efficient and reliable construction of complex inorganic structures."
[3] "For many catalysts, desirable properties appear to be associated with well-defined active sites containing one or perhaps a few metal centers (single sites)."
[4] "This approach includes what may be described as surface organometallic chemistry, which has been used by Basset and co-workers to prepare highly active catalysts for alkane metathesis and alkane hydrogenolysis."
[5] "The low-temperature (< 473 K) thermolytic conversion of these molecular species to three-dimensional networks occurs via elimination of isobutene and H2O (after condensation of the resulting hydroxyl groups)."
[6] "The presence of a large number of MOSi heterolinkages in these ZrO2 · 4SiO2 xerogels would be expected to give rise to a highly acidic material."
[7] "For cases where conversion of a precursor to a material is slow or occurs at higher temperatures, the addition of such catalysts can effectively facilitate synthetic procedures."
[8] "Such correlations between the nature of a precursor and the properties of a material derived from it should prove useful in the design and synthesis of tailored catalysts and support materials."
[9] "In studies on use of the TMP method for generation of amorphous aluminosilicates, an important class of solid acid materials, the chemical nature of the precursor has a profound influence on the properties of the resultant solid."
[10] "Interestingly, a high-surface-area Cr/Si/O xerogel (300 m2 g1) derived from the solution thermolysis of (tBuO)3CrOSi(O tBu)3 exhibited higher activity (by a factor of 3) and selectivity (by 5%) for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane than did a Cr/Si/O material with a similar (slightly higher) surface area and derived from the same precursor, but generated by a solid state thermolysis."
[11] "This initial study on the use of TMP-derived materials as catalysts therefore suggested that this synthetic approach might be generally useful for the generation of catalysts with enhanced performance."
[12] "Note that whereas the TMP-derived V/Al/O catalysts are less selective than their TMP-derived V/Zr/O counterparts (Table 1), the opposite is true for V/Al/O and V/Zr/O catalysts prepared by wet impregnation."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, the reaction proceeds through the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which act as key intermediates. In the one-site scheme, the catalyst undergoes a series of steps including the formation of alkenes and the subsequent rearrangement to produce the desired alkane. The processes involve the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds and the formation of new ones. The formation and role of these intermediates contribute to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

In terms of selectivity and performance, the use of well-defined molecular precursors in the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method allows control over the stoichiometry, nanostructure, homogeneity, and catalyst site structure. This method facilitates the production of catalytic materials that exhibit enhanced performance compared to those obtained by more traditional routes. The use of nonaqueous solvents in catalyst syntheses can be beneficial, as water often influences the structures that form. The precursors serve as molecular models for oxide-supported catalytic sites, given their MOE heterolinkages and their oxygen-rich nature. The TMP method has been demonstrated to produce catalysts that outperform related catalysts obtained by conventional methods, suggesting that molecular precursor methods will contribute significantly to the development of new generations of catalysts and support materials.

In the context of alkane metathesis, the TMP method enables the preparation of highly active catalysts with tailored properties. The silica-supported tantalum hydrides, when synthesized using the TMP method, exhibit superior performance in alkane metathesis reactions. The enhanced performance is attributed to the controlled structure of the catalyst, the presence of well-defined active sites, and the efficient utilization of the precursor molecules. The use of the TMP method offers several advantages, such as precise control over the stoichiometry and structure of the catalyst, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity in alkane conversions.
