[1] "Our research program in the synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts focuses on strategies that employ molecular design and molecular precursor chemistry."
[2] "For example, the MOM heterolinkages of bimetallic oxides and catalyst support interfaces are associated with reactivities that are not observed for the corresponding homolinkages MOM and MOM."
[3] "The use of well-defined molecular precursors in the TMP method allows control over stoichiometry, nanostructure, homogeneity, and catalyst site structure, depending on various experimental parameters."
[4] "The precursors serve as molecular models for oxide supported catalytic sites, given their MOE heterolinkages and their oxygen-rich nature."
[5] "It has been demonstrated that TMP methods can be used to produce catalysts that outperform related catalysts obtained by more traditional routes."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, linear alkane undergoes a concerted rearrangement to form a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which then rearranges to produce a new alkene and regenerate the catalyst. This process is reversible, allowing for the formation of both cis- and trans-alkenes. In the one-site scheme, a single site on the catalyst facilitates the formation of a carbene, which abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane to form an alkene, and then the catalyst regenerates. The formation of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, plays a crucial role in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The selectivity is influenced by factors such as the type of alkane, the presence of functional groups, and the reaction conditions. The one-site scheme tends to favor the formation of cis-alkenes, while the two-site scheme can lead to both cis- and trans-alkenes. The catalyst performance is optimized through careful control of parameters such as the catalyst loading, reaction temperature, and the nature of the support material.

烷烃的催化异构化由硅支持的钽氢化合物催化，涉及两种位点方案和单位点方案。在双位点方案中，线性烷烃经历协同重排形成金属环丁烷中间体，然后重新排列生成新烯烃并再生催化剂。这个过程是可逆的，允许形成顺式和反式烯烃。在单位点方案中，催化剂上的单一位点促进形成碳烯，从烷烃中提取氢原子形成烯烃，然后再生催化剂。关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，对确定各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能起着关键作用。选择性受到诸如烷烃类型、功能团的存在和反应条件等因素的影响。单位点方案倾向于促进顺式烯烃的形成，而双位点方案可能导致顺式和反式烯烃。通过仔细控制催化剂负载、反应温度和支持材料的性质等参数来优化催化剂性能。
