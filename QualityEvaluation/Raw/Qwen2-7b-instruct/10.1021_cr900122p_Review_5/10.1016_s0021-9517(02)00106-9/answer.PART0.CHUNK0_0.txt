<EnglishVersionAnswer>
At low temperatures (below 473 K), the thermolytic conversion of these molecular species to three-dimensional networks happens through the removal of isobutene and H2O (after condensation of the resulting hydroxyl groups). When thermolysis is conducted in nonpolar solvents, such as toluene or n-octane, a solvent-bound gel is typically produced. Although both the sol-gel process and the TMP method utilize low-temperature pathways to create metastable materials, the TMP method provides several benefits.
