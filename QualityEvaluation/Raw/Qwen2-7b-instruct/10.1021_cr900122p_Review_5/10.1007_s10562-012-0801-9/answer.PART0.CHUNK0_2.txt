[1] "In the case of the conversion of ethylene on supported rhodium catalysts, the initial Rh(C2H4)2 complexes bonded to a crystalline zeolite HY support could be made to remain isolated and to display high selectivity for the dimerization of ethylene to butenes and butane under most conditions, except upon exposure to highly reducing environments, after which they were seen to form small metal clusters and to preferentially promote hydrogenation to ethane instead."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The behavior of ethylene conversion on rhodium catalysts on a crystalline zeolite HY support demonstrates the influence of metal particle size and structure on catalytic selectivity. Under normal conditions, the rhodium complexes remain isolated, favoring the dimerization of ethylene to butenes and butane. However, in highly reducing environments, these complexes transform into smaller metal clusters, shifting the catalytic preference towards hydrogenation to ethane.

乙烯在铑催化剂上进行转换时，当使用结晶型HY沸石支持物时，显示出金属颗粒大小和结构对催化选择性的影响。在正常条件下，这些铑复合物保持孤立状态，促进乙烯二聚化为丁烯和丁烷。但在高度还原环境中，这些复合物会转变为更小的金属簇，将催化偏好转移到向乙烷的氢化。

[1] "The use of chiral molecules as modifiers to bestow enantioselectivity to regular hydrogenation catalysts has so far been shown to work for a fairly restricted set of molecules, and its extension to more general cases has proven difficult."
