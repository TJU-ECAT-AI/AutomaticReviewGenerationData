<p>The behavior of the catalyst in such cases may resemble more closely that of homogeneous catalysts, where selectivity can sometimes be controlled at a molecular level.</p>
<p>However, the interaction of the atoms of the catalytic phase with the support is rarely negligible, and needs to be considered. The final structure of the surface species may also dynamically change as the pretreatment or reaction conditions are changed, and the final active phase may exhibit very different characteristics to those of the original organometallic precursors.</p>
<p>A correlation was identified between the ease with which 2-propanol is oxidized (the extent to which the reaction onset temperature is lowered) and the increase in the number of coordinatively unsaturated sites on the Pt nanoparticles (an increase in the number of missing bonds).</p>
<p>Independently, another correlation was highlighted with particle shape, with Pt(100) nanocubes producing the largest fraction of cracking products and Pt(110) nanooctahedra the largest fraction of the ring-opening product hexane (and the smallest fraction of 2-methylpentane); Pt spheres and truncated octahedra showed higher overall turnovers.</p>
<p>It was found that tetrahedral platinum particles, which only expose (111) facets, preferentially promote the formation of the cis isomer (top), whereas other more rounded structures display a reversed selectivity toward the trans isomer (bottom).</p>
<p>In the case of water splitting to generate hydrogen fuel out of the decomposition of water, for instance, materials have been long sought capable of both absorbing light, preferably in the visible range, and promoting the subsequent redox reactions required to make H2 + O2.</p>
<p>There is much room for improvement in the design of these nanostructured photocatalysts still.</p>

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, the catalyst facilitates the exchange of alkyl groups between different alkane molecules, resulting in the formation of new alkane chains. In the one-site scheme, a single active site on the catalyst surface promotes the rearrangement of alkane molecules, leading to the formation of shorter or longer alkane chains. The processes involved include the breaking of sigma bonds in the alkane backbone, the migration of alkyl groups, and the formation of new sigma bonds. Key intermediates in this mechanism include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The formation of these intermediates contributes to the reaction selectivity, as they stabilize the transition states and guide the pathway of alkane transformations towards more favorable products. The catalyst performance is influenced by factors such as the size and shape of the active sites, the support properties, and the coordination of the metal centers. These factors determine the reaction rates, product yields, and selectivities, leading to efficient alkane conversions.

The catalysts used in this mechanism are silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The silica support provides a stable matrix for the immobilization of tantalum hydrides, while the tantalum centers act as the active sites for alkane metathesis. The size and shape of these active sites can significantly impact the reaction outcomes. For instance, smaller sites might favor the formation of branched alkanes due to the steric constraints, while larger sites might promote the formation of linear alkanes. The support, in turn, can influence the dispersion of the active sites, affecting the accessibility of alkane molecules to the catalytic sites and thus impacting the reaction efficiency.

The role of key intermediates in this mechanism includes the stabilization of transition states during the alkane rearrangement process. Alkenes and metallacyclobutanes serve as precursors for the formation of new alkane chains. The formation of these intermediates is crucial for the reaction selectivity, as they guide the pathway towards the formation of more desirable products. The selectivity can be influenced by the coordination of the metal centers, the support properties, and the specific interactions between the catalyst and the alkane molecules.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the breaking and rearrangement of alkane molecules facilitated by active sites on the catalyst surface. The formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes plays a critical role in the reaction pathways and product selectivity. The size and shape of the active sites, along with the support properties, determine the efficiency and selectivity of the alkane conversions.

The design of these catalysts focuses on optimizing the active sites, the support matrix, and the interactions between the catalyst and the alkane molecules to achieve efficient alkane metathesis reactions. Improvements in the design of these catalysts can lead to enhanced reaction rates, higher product yields, and better selectivities, contributing to more effective alkane conversions.
