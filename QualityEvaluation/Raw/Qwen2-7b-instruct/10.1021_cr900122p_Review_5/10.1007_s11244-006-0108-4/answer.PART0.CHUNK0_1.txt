Silica and alumina supported tantalum and tungsten hydrides were tested in alkane metathesis, for comparison of their catalytic properties.
In propane metathesis [W]H/Al2O3 proves to be twice more efficient than the usual [Ta]H/SiO2 catalyst which is still better than [Ta]H/Al2O3 and [W]H/SiO2.
Tungsten based catalysts lead to a narrower distribution in the products selectivity and to a higher amount of linear products than [Ta]H/SiO2.
[W]H/Al2O3 is also a better catalyst than [Ta]H/SiO2 for butane metathesis but is less efficient with ethane.
Whereas the results in the case of propane or butane can involve the higher initial activity and a lower deactivation of the tungsten catalyst, in the case of ethane, mechanistic or kinetic aspects can be envisaged in particular concerning the difficulty to dehydrogenate ethane into ethylene.

The study analyzed the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The two-site scheme involves the activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride, leading to the formation of a surface tantalum alkyl complex. From this complex, a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can result from a-H and b-H abstractions. The interaction of the carbene and the olefin leads to a tantallacyclobutane intermediate, which decomposes to produce new carbene and olefin species. Hydrogenation of these latter species produces new alkanes. The one-site scheme suggests that the activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride leads directly to the formation of the tantallacyclobutane intermediate, bypassing the carbene and olefin steps. The processes involved in the linear and cyclic alkane transformations are closely related to the activation and abstraction mechanisms, influencing the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These factors contribute to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The study found that tungsten-based catalysts offer a narrower distribution in product selectivity and a higher amount of linear products compared to tantalum-based catalysts. Specifically, tungsten catalysts were found to be more efficient in the metathesis of propane and butane, indicating better initial activity and lower deactivation. However, tungsten was less effective in the metathesis of ethane, possibly due to mechanistic or kinetic challenges in dehydrogenating ethane into ethylene.

研究分析了二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物在烷烃裂合中的全面机制。双位点方案涉及通过钽氢化物激活烷烃，导致表面钽烷基复合物的形成。从这个复合物中，可以通过a-H和b-H摘取形成碳烯氢化物和烯烃氢化物物种。碳烯与烯烃的相互作用产生一种钽碳环丁烷中间体，其分解产生新的碳烯和烯烃物种。对这些后者的氢化产生新的烷烃。单位点方案表明，通过钽氢化物激活烷烃直接导致形成钽碳环丁烷中间体，绕过了碳烯和烯烃步骤。线性和环烷烃转化过程紧密相关于激活和摘取机制，影响关键中间体（如烯烃和钽碳环丁烷）的形成和作用。这些因素促进了各种烷烃转化的反应选择性和催化剂性能。研究发现，钨基催化剂提供产品选择性分布更窄和更高数量的线性产物，相比钽基催化剂。具体而言，钨催化剂在丙烷和丁烷的裂合中更为有效，表明更好的初始活性和较低的失活。然而，钨在乙烷裂合中的效率较低，可能由于乙烷脱氢为乙烯的机制或动力学挑战。
