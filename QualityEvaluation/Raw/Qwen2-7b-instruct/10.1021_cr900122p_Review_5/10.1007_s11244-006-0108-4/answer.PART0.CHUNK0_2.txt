[1] "The alkane metathesis, a reaction which transforms light acyclic alkanes into a mixture of higher and lower homologues by cleavage and formation of CC bonds has been discovered since about a decade [13]."
[2] "This tantalum hydride was obtained by treatment under H2 at 150 C of the alkyl-alkylidene tantalum complexes grafted on silica [(SiO)Ta (=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] and [(SiO)2Ta(=CHtBu) (CH2tBu)]."
[3] "These complexes also proved to be catalytic precursors for the alkane metathesis reaction [7]."
[4] "Recent studies of propane metathesis in a continu- ous flow reactor showed by varying the contact time,that olefins and hydrogen were primary products of this reaction."
[5] "Thus the reaction is believed to begin by the CH bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride leading to a surface tantalum alkyl complex [4,14,15]; a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can then result from a-H and b-H abstractions on this complex; classically, the interaction of the carbene and the olefin can lead to a tantallacyclobutane [16,17] which by decomposition will afford a new carbene and a new olefin; hydrogenation of these latter produces the new alkanes."
[6] "In propane metathesis [W]H/Al2O3 proves to be twice more efficient than the usual [Ta]H/SiO2 catalyst which is still better than [Ta]H/Al2O3 and [W]H/SiO2."
[7] "Tungsten based catalysts lead to a narrower distribution in the products selectivity and to a higher amount of linear products than [Ta]H/SiO2."
[8] "[W]H/Al2O3 is also a better catalyst than [Ta]H/SiO2 for butane metathesis but is less efficient with ethane."
[9] "The better performance in the case of propane and butane is due to a better initial activity and a lower deactivation of [W]H/Al2O3 compared to [Ta]H/SiO2."
[10] "Tungsten, which is a standard olefin metathesis catalyst [18], not surprisingly shows better performances than tantalum."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the activation of the alkane carbon-hydrogen bond by the tantalum hydride, leading to the formation of a surface tantalum alkyl complex. From this complex, a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species are produced through alpha (a-H) and beta (b-H) abstractions. These species can interact to form a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which decomposes to yield a new carbene and a new olefin. The final products are obtained by hydrogenation of these intermediates, resulting in the formation of new alkanes. In the case of propane metathesis, the tungsten hydride catalyst [W]H/Al2O3 demonstrates superior efficiency compared to the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst [Ta]H/SiO2. This is attributed to the ability of the tungsten catalyst to produce a narrower distribution of product selectivity and a higher amount of linear products. However, tungsten shows less efficiency in the metathesis of ethane compared to tantalum, likely due to the intrinsic properties of the metals involved in the catalytic process. The enhanced activity and reduced deactivation of tungsten in the metathesis of propane and butane are due to the better initial activity and stability of the tungsten catalyst, which facilitates the formation of olefins and hydrogen as primary products.

烷烃裂合由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化时，全面机制涉及烷烃碳-氢键被钽氢化物活化，导致表面钽烷基复合体的形成。从该复合体中，通过alpha（a-H）和beta（b-H）消除产生了卡宾氢化物和烯烃氢化物物种。这些物种可以相互作用形成金属环丁烷中间体，随后分解产生新的卡宾和新烯烃。最终产物通过中间体的氢化得到，导致新烷烃的形成。在丙烷裂合的情况下，钨氢化物催化剂[W]H/Al2O3在效率上优于二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化剂[Ta]H/SiO2。这归因于钨催化剂产生产品选择性分布更窄以及更高比例线性产品的能力。然而，钨在乙烷裂合中的表现不如钽，这可能与所涉及金属的内在性质有关。丙烷和丁烷裂合中钨催化剂的增强活性和稳定性，归因于钨催化剂更好的初始活性，促进烯烃和氢作为主要产物的形成。
