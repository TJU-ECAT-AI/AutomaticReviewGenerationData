[1] "The alkane metathesis, a reaction which transforms light acyclic alkanes into a mixture of higher and lower homologues by cleavage and formation of CC bonds has been discovered since about a decade."
[2] "This tantalum hydride was obtained by treatment under H2 at 150 C of the alkyl-alkylidene tantalum complexes grafted on silica [(SiO)Ta (=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] and [(SiO)2Ta(=CHtBu) (CH2tBu)]"
[3] "On the basis of the product selectivities and the properties of tantalum complexes to undergo a-H [8,9] or b-H [9,10] transfer processes, it was then inferred [11,12] that alkane metathesis should involve the same carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates as olefin metathesis"
[4] "Then, as a subsequent development oriented to the improvement of the catalytic activity, we have investigated the use of an other metal well known in olefin metathesis [18], that is tungsten."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and intermediates. Initially, the alkane is activated by the tantalum hydride, leading to the formation of a surface tantalum alkyl complex. From this complex, a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can result through a-hydrogen abstraction or b-hydrogen abstraction. The interaction of the carbene and olefin can then lead to a tantallacyclobutane, which decomposes to produce new carbene and olefin species. Hydrogenation of these species results in the formation of new alkanes. The mechanism is similar to olefin metathesis, involving the same carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates.

In terms of catalyst performance, silica-supported tantalum hydrides demonstrate varying efficiencies across different alkane conversions. For propane and butane, they show improved catalytic activity, with lower deactivation rates compared to alumina-supported catalysts. However, the performance significantly decreases for ethane conversions, possibly due to mechanistic or kinetic limitations in dehydrogenating ethane into ethylene.

When comparing tungsten hydrides to tantalum hydrides, tungsten catalysts exhibit a narrower distribution in product selectivity and produce a higher amount of linear products. The efficiency of tungsten catalysts varies between alkane conversions, with better performance noted for butane metathesis and reduced activity observed in ethane conversions. 

The catalysts' performance and selectivity in alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as initial activity, deactivation rates, and the ability to form linear versus branched products. The differences in catalytic properties between silica-supported tantalum and tungsten hydrides can be attributed to the unique characteristics and reactivities of these metals, as well as the structural properties of the supported catalysts.

烷烃裂合由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化机制涉及多个关键步骤和中间体。首先，烷烃通过钽氢化物被激活，导致表面钽烷基复合物的形成。从该复合物中，可以通过a-氢原子抽象或b-氢原子抽象产生碳烯氢化物和烯烃氢化物物种。碳烯和烯烃之间的相互作用可以导致钽-碳环丁烷的形成，该化合物分解产生新的碳烯和烯烃物种。对这些物种进行氢化产生新的烷烃。该机制类似于烯烃裂合，涉及到相同的碳烯和碳环丁烷中间体。

在不同的烷烃转化中，二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化剂表现出不同的催化活性。对于丙烷和丁烷，它们显示出改进的催化活性，与铝氧支持的催化剂相比，脱活率较低。然而，对于乙烷转化，性能显著下降，可能由于乙烷脱氢为乙烯的机制或动力学限制。

将钨氢化物与钽氢化物进行比较时，钨催化剂显示出产品选择性更窄和更高量的线性产物。钨催化剂的效率在不同烷烃转化中有所不同，在丁烷裂合中表现较好，在乙烷转化中活性较低。

催化剂在烷烃转化中的性能和选择性受到初始活性、脱活速率以及形成线性与分支产物能力等因素的影响。二氧化硅支持的钽和钨氢化物之间催化性质的差异可归因于这些金属的独特特性和反应性，以及支持催化剂的结构特性。

The study analyzed the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The two-site scheme involves the activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride, leading to the formation of a surface tantalum alkyl complex. From this complex, a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can result from a-H and b-H abstractions. The interaction of the carbene and the olefin leads to a tantallacyclobutane intermediate, which decomposes to produce new carbene and olefin species. Hydrogenation of these latter species produces new alkanes. The one-site scheme suggests that the activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride leads directly to the formation of the tantallacyclobutane intermediate, bypassing the carbene and olefin steps. The processes involved in the linear and cyclic alkane transformations are closely related to the activation and abstraction mechanisms, influencing the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These factors contribute to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The study found that tungsten-based catalysts offer a narrower distribution in product selectivity and a higher amount of linear products compared to tantalum-based catalysts. Specifically, tungsten catalysts were found to be more efficient in the metathesis of propane and butane, indicating better initial activity and lower deactivation. However, tungsten was less effective in the metathesis of ethane, possibly due to mechanistic or kinetic challenges in dehydrogenating ethane into ethylene.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the activation of the alkane carbon-hydrogen bond by the tantalum hydride, leading to the formation of a surface tantalum alkyl complex. From this complex, a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species are produced through alpha (a-H) and beta (b-H) abstractions. These species can interact to form a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which decomposes to yield a new carbene and a new olefin. The final products are obtained by hydrogenation of these intermediates, resulting in the formation of new alkanes. In the case of propane metathesis, the tungsten hydride catalyst [W]H/Al2O3 demonstrates superior efficiency compared to the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst [Ta]H/SiO2. This is attributed to the ability of the tungsten catalyst to produce a narrower distribution of product selectivity and a higher amount of linear products. However, tungsten shows less efficiency in the metathesis of ethane compared to tantalum, likely due to the intrinsic properties of the metals involved in the catalytic process. The enhanced activity and reduced deactivation of tungsten in the metathesis of propane and butane are due to the better initial activity and stability of the tungsten catalyst, which facilitates the formation of olefins and hydrogen as primary products.

烷烃裂合由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化时，全面机制涉及烷烃碳-氢键被钽氢化物活化，导致表面钽烷基复合体的形成。从该复合体中，通过alpha（a-H）和beta（b-H）消除产生了卡宾氢化物和烯烃氢化物物种。这些物种可以相互作用形成金属环丁烷中间体，随后分解产生新的卡宾和新烯烃。最终产物通过中间体的氢化得到，导致新烷烃的形成。在丙烷裂合的情况下，钨氢化物催化剂[W]H/Al2O3在效率上优于二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化剂[Ta]H/SiO2。这归因于钨催化剂产生产品选择性分布更窄以及更高比例线性产品的能力。然而，钨在乙烷裂合中的表现不如钽，这可能与所涉及金属的内在性质有关。丙烷和丁烷裂合中钨催化剂的增强活性和稳定性，归因于钨催化剂更好的初始活性，促进烯烃和氢作为主要产物的形成。

Answer: The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two-site and one-site schemes. Two-site schemes involve the activation of the alkane at two distinct sites on the catalyst surface, leading to the formation of linear and cyclic alkane intermediates. One-site schemes propose that the activation occurs at a single site, resulting in similar outcomes. Key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The alkenes are formed through the cleavage of the alkane's carbon-carbon bond by the tantalum hydride, while the metallacyclobutanes are generated through the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane, leading to the formation of a surface tantalum alkyl complex. These intermediates interact to produce new alkanes through decomposition and hydrogenation processes. The catalyst's performance varies across different alkanes, influenced by factors such as the initial activity, deactivation rates, and the ability to dehydrogenate ethane into ethylene. Tungsten-based catalysts exhibit better performance in terms of product selectivity and efficiency, particularly for propane and butane conversions, due to their enhanced initial activity and lower deactivation compared to silica-supported tantalum hydrides. However, for ethane metathesis, the tungsten catalysts face challenges in dehydrogenation, affecting their overall performance.

该文献分析了硅基钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的全面机制，包括双位点和单位点方案。双位点方案涉及在催化剂表面两个不同位置激活烷烃，产生线性和环烷烃中间体。单位点方案则认为激活发生在单一位置，导致相似的结果。关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。烯烃通过烷烃中的碳-碳键由钽氢化物活化形成，而金属环丁烷则是通过从烷烃中提取氢原子生成表面钽烷基复合物而产生的。这些中间体通过分解和氢化过程相互作用，产生新的烷烃。催化剂的性能根据不同的烷烃变化，受到因素如初始活性、失活率以及乙烷脱氢为乙烯的能力的影响。钨基催化剂在丙烷和丁烷转化方面的表现更好，主要是由于其增强的初始活性和与硅基钽氢化物相比更低的失活，特别是在丙烷和丁烷转换方面。然而，在乙烷裂解过程中，钨催化剂面临脱氢挑战，影响了它们的整体性能。
