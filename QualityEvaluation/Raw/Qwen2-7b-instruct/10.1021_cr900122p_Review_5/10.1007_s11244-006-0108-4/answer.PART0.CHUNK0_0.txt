The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and intermediates. Initially, the alkane is activated by the tantalum hydride, leading to the formation of a surface tantalum alkyl complex. From this complex, a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can result through a-hydrogen abstraction or b-hydrogen abstraction. The interaction of the carbene and olefin can then lead to a tantallacyclobutane, which decomposes to produce new carbene and olefin species. Hydrogenation of these species results in the formation of new alkanes. The mechanism is similar to olefin metathesis, involving the same carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates.

In terms of catalyst performance, silica-supported tantalum hydrides demonstrate varying efficiencies across different alkane conversions. For propane and butane, they show improved catalytic activity, with lower deactivation rates compared to alumina-supported catalysts. However, the performance significantly decreases for ethane conversions, possibly due to mechanistic or kinetic limitations in dehydrogenating ethane into ethylene.

When comparing tungsten hydrides to tantalum hydrides, tungsten catalysts exhibit a narrower distribution in product selectivity and produce a higher amount of linear products. The efficiency of tungsten catalysts varies between alkane conversions, with better performance noted for butane metathesis and reduced activity observed in ethane conversions. 

The catalysts' performance and selectivity in alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as initial activity, deactivation rates, and the ability to form linear versus branched products. The differences in catalytic properties between silica-supported tantalum and tungsten hydrides can be attributed to the unique characteristics and reactivities of these metals, as well as the structural properties of the supported catalysts.

烷烃裂合由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化机制涉及多个关键步骤和中间体。首先，烷烃通过钽氢化物被激活，导致表面钽烷基复合物的形成。从该复合物中，可以通过a-氢原子抽象或b-氢原子抽象产生碳烯氢化物和烯烃氢化物物种。碳烯和烯烃之间的相互作用可以导致钽-碳环丁烷的形成，该化合物分解产生新的碳烯和烯烃物种。对这些物种进行氢化产生新的烷烃。该机制类似于烯烃裂合，涉及到相同的碳烯和碳环丁烷中间体。

在不同的烷烃转化中，二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化剂表现出不同的催化活性。对于丙烷和丁烷，它们显示出改进的催化活性，与铝氧支持的催化剂相比，脱活率较低。然而，对于乙烷转化，性能显著下降，可能由于乙烷脱氢为乙烯的机制或动力学限制。

将钨氢化物与钽氢化物进行比较时，钨催化剂显示出产品选择性更窄和更高量的线性产物。钨催化剂的效率在不同烷烃转化中有所不同，在丁烷裂合中表现较好，在乙烷转化中活性较低。

催化剂在烷烃转化中的性能和选择性受到初始活性、脱活速率以及形成线性与分支产物能力等因素的影响。二氧化硅支持的钽和钨氢化物之间催化性质的差异可归因于这些金属的独特特性和反应性，以及支持催化剂的结构特性。
