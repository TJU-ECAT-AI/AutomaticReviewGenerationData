[4] "In propane metathesis [W]H/Al2O3 proves to be twice more efficient than the usual [Ta]H/SiO2 catalyst which is still better than [Ta]H/Al2O3 and [W]H/SiO2."
[5] "Tungsten based catalysts lead to a narrower distribution in the products selectivity and to a higher amount of linear products than [Ta]H/SiO2."
[6] "The better performance in the case of propane and butane is due to a better initial activity and a lower deactivation of [W]H/Al2O3 compared to [Ta]H/SiO2."

Answer: The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two-site and one-site schemes. Two-site schemes involve the activation of the alkane at two distinct sites on the catalyst surface, leading to the formation of linear and cyclic alkane intermediates. One-site schemes propose that the activation occurs at a single site, resulting in similar outcomes. Key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The alkenes are formed through the cleavage of the alkane's carbon-carbon bond by the tantalum hydride, while the metallacyclobutanes are generated through the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane, leading to the formation of a surface tantalum alkyl complex. These intermediates interact to produce new alkanes through decomposition and hydrogenation processes. The catalyst's performance varies across different alkanes, influenced by factors such as the initial activity, deactivation rates, and the ability to dehydrogenate ethane into ethylene. Tungsten-based catalysts exhibit better performance in terms of product selectivity and efficiency, particularly for propane and butane conversions, due to their enhanced initial activity and lower deactivation compared to silica-supported tantalum hydrides. However, for ethane metathesis, the tungsten catalysts face challenges in dehydrogenation, affecting their overall performance.

该文献分析了硅基钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的全面机制，包括双位点和单位点方案。双位点方案涉及在催化剂表面两个不同位置激活烷烃，产生线性和环烷烃中间体。单位点方案则认为激活发生在单一位置，导致相似的结果。关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。烯烃通过烷烃中的碳-碳键由钽氢化物活化形成，而金属环丁烷则是通过从烷烃中提取氢原子生成表面钽烷基复合物而产生的。这些中间体通过分解和氢化过程相互作用，产生新的烷烃。催化剂的性能根据不同的烷烃变化，受到因素如初始活性、失活率以及乙烷脱氢为乙烯的能力的影响。钨基催化剂在丙烷和丁烷转化方面的表现更好，主要是由于其增强的初始活性和与硅基钽氢化物相比更低的失活，特别是在丙烷和丁烷转换方面。然而，在乙烷裂解过程中，钨催化剂面临脱氢挑战，影响了它们的整体性能。
