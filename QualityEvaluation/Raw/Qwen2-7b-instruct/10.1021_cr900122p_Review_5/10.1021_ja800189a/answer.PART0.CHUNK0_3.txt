Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.
</questions>

Answer: The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In linear alkane transformations, the catalyst facilitates the exchange of alkyl groups between different molecules, leading to the formation of new alkene products. For cyclic alkane transformations, the process is more complex, involving the formation of metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates, which then undergo further reactions to yield the desired products. The role of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes in the mechanism is crucial, acting as precursors for the final alkene products. The selective nature of the reactions and the performance of the catalyst are influenced by factors such as the stability of the intermediates and the efficiency of the β-H transfer steps. These mechanisms contribute to the effectiveness of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
