[1] "Alkanes, or saturated hydrocarbons, are major constituents of natural gas and petroleum, but there are very few practical processes for converting them directly to more valuable products."
[2] "The reason for this difficulty is alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert."
[3] "Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water."
[4] "Similarly, although alkanes can be induced to react by exposure to highly reactive species such as superacids or free radicals, these reactive species are usually demanding and expensive to make, and offer little control over product selectivity."
[5] "Because it is difficult to achieve selective transformations under forcing conditions, most important petrochemicals, especially oxygenates such as alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are produced from unsaturated hydrocarbons."
[6] "Milder and better-controlled direct conversions of alkanes into olefins may thus offer large economic benefits."
[7] "Developing efficient strategies for the direct conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could thus significantly improve methane utilization."
