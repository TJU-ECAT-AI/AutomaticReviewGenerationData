[1] "Alkanes, or saturated hydrocarbons, are major constituents of natural gas and petroleum, but there are very few practical processes for converting them directly to more valuable products."
[2] "This chemical inertness arises from the constituent atoms of alkanes all being held together by strong and localized CC and CH bonds, so that the molecules have no empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction, as is the case with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins and alkynes."
[3] "A variety of enzymes efficiently and selectively catalyse alkane oxidation at physiological temperatures and pressures, and the direct use of biological organisms for industrial alkane conversion under such benign conditions is possible in principle."
[4] "Because it is difficult to achieve selective transformations under forcing conditions, most important petrochemicals, especially oxygenates such as alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are produced from unsaturated hydrocarbons."
[5] "The primary unsaturated starting materials are olefins, in turn obtained from alkanes by fairly inefficient processes."
[6] "Developing efficient strategies for the direct conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could thus significantly improve methane utilization."
[7] "To date, binding to metal centres has resulted in altered and/or enhanced reactivity in a variety of molecules, through associated changes in the relative energies of their orbitals or their polarity."
[8] "Indeed, in most pre-1980s examples of CH bonds reacting at transition-metal centres, reactions proceed successfully only if they are assisted through participation of the p orbitals of aromatic CH bonds or involve intramolecular reactions."
[9] "However, during the 1970s, examples of significant interaction between a metal centre and an alkane CH bond suggested that this difficulty might have been overestimated."
[10] "These observations suggested that alkane activation should be possible."
[11] "Using systems designed to produce stable products, two groups demonstrated intermolecular alkane activation in 1982."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In linear alkane transformations, alkenes are formed as key intermediates. For cyclic alkane transformations, metallacyclobutanes play a crucial role. These intermediates contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The two-site scheme allows for the simultaneous activation of two alkane molecules, while the one-site scheme activates a single molecule. Selectivity is influenced by the nature of the catalyst, the reaction conditions, and the specific alkane substrates used. Catalyst performance is enhanced by optimizing these factors.

<p>Alkanes, or saturated hydrocarbons, are major constituents of natural gas and petroleum, but there are very few practical processes for converting them directly to more valuable products. The reason for this difficulty is alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert. This chemical inertness arises from the constituent atoms of alkanes all being held together by strong and localized CC and CH bonds, so that the molecules have no empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction, as is the case with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins and alkynes.</p>
<p>Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in combustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically unattractive products, carbon dioxide and water. The currently prevalent use of alkanes in combustion applications exploits their energy content, but not their considerable potential as valuable precursors for more important and expensive chemicals. Although cracking and thermal dehydrogenation convert alkanes to valuable olefins, these processes require high temperatures and are energy intensive.</p>
<p>Similarly, although alkanes can be induced to react by exposure to highly reactive species such as superacids or free radicals, these reactive species are usually demanding and expensive to make, and offer little control over product selectivity.</p>
<p>Because it is difficult to achieve selective transformations under forcing conditions, most important petrochemicals, especially oxygenates such as alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are produced from unsaturated hydrocarbons. The primary unsaturated starting materials are olefins, in turn obtained from alkanes by fairly inefficient processes. Milder and better-controlled direct conversions of alkanes into olefins may thus offer large economic benefits. Alkane chemistry could also improve the utilization of methane, the principal component of natural gas. Many of the world's established natural gas resource locations are remote, in sites where there is little or no local demand, such as the north slope of Alaska. Exploitation of such resources is impeded by the high cost of both gas transportation and current methods for converting hydrocarbon gas into more readily transportable liquid4. The available conversion methods are indirect, involving production of synthesis gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen), followed by conversion to the desired product. Developing efficient strategies for the direct conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could thus significantly improve methane utilization.</p>

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves multiple steps and factors contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. This process typically includes the following key components:

1. **Formation of Key Intermediates**: Alkenes and metallacyclobutanes are crucial intermediates in the alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. Alkenes are formed through the breaking of alkane C-H bonds and the subsequent rearrangement or migration of the resulting alkyl groups. Metallacyclobutanes, which are cyclobutane rings with a metal center, are intermediate states that facilitate the metathesis reaction.

2. **Role of Silica-Supported Tantalum Hydrides**: Silica supports enhance the stability and activity of tantalum hydrides, providing a suitable surface for alkane adsorption and activation. Tantalum hydrides, being the active site, catalyze the alkane metathesis reactions efficiently.

3. **Two-Site and One-Site Schemes**: In two-site schemes, two alkyl groups migrate across the metal center simultaneously, leading to the formation of two new alkene bonds. In contrast, one-site schemes involve the sequential migration of an alkyl group to form a single alkene bond.

4. **Linear and Cyclic Alkane Transformations**: Linear alkane metathesis typically results in the formation of two alkenes, while cyclic alkane metathesis can lead to the formation of cyclobutane rings or larger cyclic structures. These transformations are facilitated by the movement of alkyl groups on the metal surface, guided by the energetics of the system.

5. **Reaction Selectivity and Catalyst Performance**: Selectivity in alkane metathesis is influenced by the nature of the catalyst, the specific conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.), and the properties of the alkane substrates. Silica-supported tantalum hydrides offer high selectivity due to their ability to control the migration of alkyl groups and the formation of preferred alkene products.

6. **Formation of Alkenes**: Alkenes are generated through the breaking of C-H bonds in alkane molecules, followed by the rearrangement of alkyl groups to form new alkene bonds. The presence of silica support helps in stabilizing the transient alkyl groups, facilitating the alkene formation step.

7. **Formation of Metallacyclobutanes**: Metallacyclobutanes play a role in the alkane metathesis process by acting as intermediates that help in the rearrangement of alkyl groups. These structures are temporary and are converted back to alkenes or other products through further catalytic steps.

8. **Influence of Conditions**: The choice of conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the concentration of reactants, significantly affects the rate and selectivity of alkane metathesis. Optimized conditions can lead to higher yields of desired products and improved catalyst performance.

These factors collectively contribute to the efficiency and selectivity of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, offering potential improvements in alkane and methane utilization.

4. **线性与环状烷烃转换**：线性烷烃裂解通常导致两种烯烃的形成，而环状烷烃裂解可能导致环戊烷环或其他更大环结构的形成。通过指导烷基团在金属表面的移动，由系统能量决定。

5. **选择性和催化剂性能**：烷烃裂解的选择性受催化剂性质、特定条件（温度、压力等）以及烷烃底物性质的影响。二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物因其能控制烷基团的迁移和形成优选烯键产品的能力，提供高选择性。

6. **烯烃的形成**：通过破坏烷烃分子中的C-H键并随后重组烷基团以形成新烯键，形成了烯烃。二氧化硅的支持有助于稳定瞬时烷基团，从而促进烯烃形成步骤。

7. **金属环戊烷的形成**：金属环戊烷作为中间体在烷烃裂解过程中发挥作用，帮助重组烷基团。这些结构是暂时的，并通过进一步的催化步骤转化为其他产品。

8. **条件的影响**：反应条件的选择，包括温度、压力和反应物浓度，显著影响烷烃裂解的速度和选择性。优化的条件可以导致所需产品的更高产率和催化剂性能的改进。

这些因素共同作用于二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂解，为烷烃和甲烷的利用提供了潜在的改进。

[1] "The selective transformation of ubiquitous but inert CH bonds to other functional groups has far-reaching practical implications, ranging from more efficient strategies for fine chemical synthesis to the replacement of current petrochemical feedstocks by less expensive and more readily available alkanes."
[2] "Alkanes, or saturated hydrocarbons, are major constituents of natural gas and petroleum, but there are very few practical processes for converting them directly to more valuable products."

[6] "In principle, it should be possible to similarly activate the inert CH bonds of alkanes, but the examples just mentioned all involve small molecules with lone electron pairs and/or p orbitals that can interact with empty orbitals of the metal centres; alkanes possess neither of these."
[7] "However, during the 1970s, examples of significant interaction between a metal centre and an alkane CH bond suggested that this difficulty might have been overestimated."
[8] "In fact, chemists realized that previous failures to achieve it might not have been due to unreactivity at all: CH activation might take place, but yield an organometallic product that is thermodynamically unstable and thus undetectable."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. These schemes refer to the locations on the catalyst where the reaction takes place. Two-site schemes typically involve the simultaneous activation of two alkene molecules, leading to the formation of two new alkenes. One-site schemes, on the other hand, involve the sequential activation of one alkene molecule, leading to the formation of a single alkene.

Linear alkane transformations, which involve the conversion of linear alkanes to alkenes, are facilitated by the breaking of the C-H bond at one end of the alkane chain and the formation of a new C-C bond between the resulting alkene and another alkene. This process is driven by the catalyst's ability to stabilize the intermediate alkene species, allowing for the efficient rearrangement of the alkane chain.

Cyclic alkane transformations, which convert cyclic alkanes into cyclobutenes or other cyclic compounds, involve a similar mechanism but with additional considerations for the ring structure. The catalyst must be able to stabilize the strained cyclobutane intermediate, facilitating the rearrangement of the alkane ring into the desired product.

Key intermediates in alkane metathesis reactions include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Alkenes are formed during the initial step of the reaction, where the C-H bond is broken, and they play a crucial role in the subsequent rearrangements that lead to the final product. Metallacyclobutanes, which are complexes of the metal with a cyclobutane ring, are formed during the reaction and are stabilized by the metal center, allowing for the efficient conversion of cyclic alkanes.

These factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. Selectivity is influenced by the catalyst's ability to stabilize specific intermediates, guiding the reaction pathway towards the desired product. Catalyst performance is determined by its stability, activity, and efficiency in converting alkane feedstocks into valuable products.

The catalyst, silica-supported tantalum hydrides, operates effectively by providing a suitable surface area for the reaction and by utilizing the properties of tantalum to stabilize the intermediate alkene and metallacyclobutane species. The support material, silica, enhances the catalyst's stability and allows for the efficient transfer of electrons between the metal and the alkane substrate.

The role of the catalyst is critical in enabling alkane metathesis reactions to proceed under mild conditions, reducing the energy requirements and increasing the efficiency of alkane conversions. The catalyst's ability to activate the alkane C-H bonds, form stable intermediates, and facilitate the rearrangement of alkane chains results in the production of valuable alkenes and cyclic compounds.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃互变异构的全面机制涉及理解两种位点和单一位点方案。这两种方案指的是反应发生的催化剂位置。两种位点方案通常涉及同时激活两个烯烃分子，导致形成两个新的烯烃。单一位点方案则涉及依次激活一个烯烃分子，导致形成一个单烯烃。

线性烷烃转化，即通过将线性烷烃转化为烯烃的过程，涉及到在烷烃链的一端断裂C-H键，并在形成的烯烃与另一个烯烃之间形成新的C-C键。这一过程依赖于催化剂稳定中间烯烃的能力，从而实现烷烃链的有效重组。

环烷烃转化，即将环烷烃转化为环戊二烯或其他环状化合物的过程，涉及到类似机制，但需要考虑环结构的额外因素。催化剂必须能够稳定受压的环戊二烯中间体，以实现环烷烃环向所需产物的高效转化。

烷烃互变异构反应的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环戊二烯。在初始步骤中形成的烯烃在C-H键断裂后起着关键作用，并且它们在随后的重组过程中引导最终产品的生成。金属环戊二烯是形成期间形成的复合物，由金属中心稳定，允许有效地将环烷烃转化为所需的产物。

这些因素对各种烷烃转换中的反应选择性和催化剂性能产生影响。选择性受到催化剂稳定特定中间体能力的影响，指导反应路径朝向目标产品。催化剂性能由其稳定性、活性和效率决定，这些特性提高了烷烃前体转化为有价值产物的能力。

作为催化剂的二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物通过提供适当的表面积来有效地促进反应，并利用钽的性质稳定中间烯烃和金属环戊二烯物种。支持材料二氧化硅增强了催化剂的稳定性，并允许烯烃基质之间的电子有效转移。

催化剂的作用在于在温和条件下使烷烃互变异构反应得以进行，降低了能量需求并提高了烷烃转化的效率。催化剂激活烷烃C-H键、形成稳定中间体以及促进烷烃链重组的能力导致有价值的烯烃和环状化合物的生产。
