[1] "Alkanes, or saturated hydrocarbons, are major constituents of natural gas and petroleum, but there are very few practical processes for converting them directly to more valuable products."
[2] "This chemical inertness arises from the constituent atoms of alkanes all being held together by strong and localized CC and CH bonds, so that the molecules have no empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction, as is the case with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins and alkynes."
[3] "A variety of enzymes efficiently and selectively catalyse alkane oxidation at physiological temperatures and pressures, and the direct use of biological organisms for industrial alkane conversion under such benign conditions is possible in principle."
[4] "Because it is difficult to achieve selective transformations under forcing conditions, most important petrochemicals, especially oxygenates such as alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are produced from unsaturated hydrocarbons."
[5] "The primary unsaturated starting materials are olefins, in turn obtained from alkanes by fairly inefficient processes."
[6] "Developing efficient strategies for the direct conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or chemicals could thus significantly improve methane utilization."
[7] "To date, binding to metal centres has resulted in altered and/or enhanced reactivity in a variety of molecules, through associated changes in the relative energies of their orbitals or their polarity."
[8] "Indeed, in most pre-1980s examples of CH bonds reacting at transition-metal centres, reactions proceed successfully only if they are assisted through participation of the p orbitals of aromatic CH bonds or involve intramolecular reactions."
[9] "However, during the 1970s, examples of significant interaction between a metal centre and an alkane CH bond suggested that this difficulty might have been overestimated."
[10] "These observations suggested that alkane activation should be possible."
[11] "Using systems designed to produce stable products, two groups demonstrated intermolecular alkane activation in 1982."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In linear alkane transformations, alkenes are formed as key intermediates. For cyclic alkane transformations, metallacyclobutanes play a crucial role. These intermediates contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The two-site scheme allows for the simultaneous activation of two alkane molecules, while the one-site scheme activates a single molecule. Selectivity is influenced by the nature of the catalyst, the reaction conditions, and the specific alkane substrates used. Catalyst performance is enhanced by optimizing these factors.
