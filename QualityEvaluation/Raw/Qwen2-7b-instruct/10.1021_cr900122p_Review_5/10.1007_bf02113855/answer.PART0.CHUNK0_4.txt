2.1. "Dehydroaromatization of methane reactant occurs over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst at 700 under non-oxidizing conditions."
2.2. "Following an initial induction period, during which CH4 reactant reduces the original Mo 6+ ions in the zeolite to Mo2C and deposition of coke occurs, a benzene selectivity of,,, 70% at a CH4 conversion of 8-10% could be sustained for more than 16 h."
2.3. "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction measurements indicate that the reduced Mo is highly dispersed in the channels of the zeolite."
2.4. "Initial activation of CH4 reactant occurs on M02C sites, leading to the formation of C2H4 as the primary product."
2.5. "The latter then undergoes subsequent oligomerization reactions on acidic sites of the zeolite to form aromatic products."
2.6. "Ethylene appears to be the most likely initial product of CH4 conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, since its selectivity increases continuously with increasing reaction space velocity, while those of all other products simultaneously decrease."
2.7. "Conversion of C2H4 reactant over Mo/ZSM-5 at 700 results in a hydrocarbon product distribution (excluding the CH4 that is formed) and overall catalytic behavior that is very similar to that observed with CH4 reactant."
2.8. "When 25 Torr of C2H4 were introduced to the CH4 feed over Mo/ZSM-5 at 700 after the catalyst had attained a steady-state condition, the amount of benzene product abruptly increased."
2.9. "These results demonstrate that not only is ethylene the primary product from CH4 conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, but that its secondary reactions leading to aromatic and other higher hydrocarbon products occur entirely on acidic sites that do not require the presence of molybdenum."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps. Initially, the alkane is reduced by the catalyst to form alkenes. This reduction process is crucial for the subsequent formation of the desired products. The catalyst supports the formation of metallacyclobutanes, which play a pivotal role in the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes. The key intermediates in this process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The catalyst's ability to facilitate these reactions depends on its structure and the nature of the supporting material. The selectivity of the process is influenced by factors such as reaction conditions, the type of alkane, and the specific properties of the catalyst. The catalyst performance is evaluated based on the efficiency of the alkane conversion, the yield of the desired products, and the selectivity towards those products.
