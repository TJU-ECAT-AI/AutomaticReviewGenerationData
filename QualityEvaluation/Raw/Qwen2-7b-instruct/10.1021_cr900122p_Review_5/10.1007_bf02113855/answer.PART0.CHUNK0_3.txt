2.1. "Ethylene appears to be the most likely initial product of CH4 conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, since its selectivity increases continuously with increasing reaction space velocity, while those of all other products simultaneously decrease."
2.2. "When 25 Torr of C2H4 were introduced to the CH4 feed over Mo/ZSM-5 at 700 after the catalyst had attained a steady-state condition, the amount of benzene product abruptly increased."
2.3. "Conversion of C2H4 as a reactant at 700 over pure H-ZSM-5, containing no Mo, gives a hydrocarbon product distribution that closely resembles those obtained with either CH4 or C2H4 reactant over Mo/ZSM-5 and, moreover, involves no initial activation period."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a two-site scheme where linear and cyclic alkane transformations occur through the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. This mechanism contributes to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. Ethylene is identified as the primary product from methane conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, with its formation and subsequent oligomerization on acidic sites leading to aromatic products. The introduction of cyclic alkane (C2H4) as a reactant shows similar product distributions and catalytic behavior as methane, demonstrating that ethylene is the primary product, and its secondary reactions occur on acidic sites not requiring the presence of molybdenum.

催化硅负载的钽氢化物的烷烃裂解全面机制涉及两站点方案，其中线性和环烷烃的转换通过形成关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）发生。这一机制有助于各种烷烃转化中的反应选择性和催化剂性能。乙烯被确定为在Mo/ZSM-5上从甲烷转化的主要产物，其形成及其随后在酸性位点上的多聚化导致芳香族产物的生成。将环烷烃（C2H4）作为反应物引入显示与甲烷类似的产品分布和催化行为，这表明乙烯是主要产物，并且其二级反应发生在不需要钼的酸性位点上。
