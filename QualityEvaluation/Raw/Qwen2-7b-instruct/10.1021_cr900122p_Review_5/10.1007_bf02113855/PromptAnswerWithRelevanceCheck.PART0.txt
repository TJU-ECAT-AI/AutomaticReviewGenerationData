[1] "Dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene occurs over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst at 700 under non-oxidizing conditions."
[2] "Following an initial induction period,during which CH4 reactant reduces the original Mo 6+ ions in the zeolite to Mo2C and deposition of coke occurs, a benzene selectivity of,,, 70% at a CH4 conversion of 8-10% could be sustained for more than 16 h."
[3] "Initial activation of CH4 reactant occurs on M02C sites, leading to the formation of C2H4 as the primary product. The latter then undergoes subsequent oligomerization reactions on acidic sites of the zeolite to form aromatic products."
[4] "Ethylene appears to be the most likely initial product of CH4 conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, since its selectivity increases continuously with increasing reaction space velocity, while those of all other products simultaneously decrease."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a two-site and one-site scheme. In the two-site scheme, linear and cyclic alkane transformations occur through the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The processes involve the initial reduction of tantalum hydride to form alkenes, followed by the rearrangement of these alkenes to form cyclic alkane intermediates. These intermediates then undergo further transformations to produce the desired products. The one-site scheme refers to the direct conversion of alkane molecules to desired products without the need for intermediate alkenes or metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the presence of these intermediates, the specific pathways of the reactions, and the efficiency of the catalyst in facilitating these transformations.

2.1. "Several recent studies have demonstrated that methane can be selectively converted into benzene and other aromatic products over various metal oxides and metal-containing zeolite catalysts [ 1-6]."
2.2. "Initial activation of CH4 reactant occurs on M02C sites, leading to the formation of C2H4 as the primary product."
2.3. "Ethylene appears to be the most likely initial product of CH4 conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, since its selectivity increases continuously with increasing reaction space velocity, while those of all other products simultaneously decrease."
2.4. "When 25 Torr of C2H4 were introduced to the CH4 feed over Mo/ZSM-5 at 700 after the catalyst had attained a steady-state condition, the amount of benzene product abruptly increased."
2.5. "These results demonstrate that not only is ethylene the primary product from CH4 conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, but that its secondary reactions leading to aromatic and other higher hydrocarbon products occur entirely on acidic sites that do not require the presence of molybdenum."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a two-site scheme, where linear and cyclic alkane transformations occur through the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The two-site scheme refers to the simultaneous activation of two different sites on the catalyst, allowing for the sequential conversion of alkane molecules into alkenes and ultimately into various hydrocarbons. The processes involve the cleavage of alkane bonds, the formation of alkenes, and the rearrangement of these alkenes into cyclic structures. The role of alkenes is crucial as they serve as precursors for the formation of higher hydrocarbons, including aromatic compounds.

In the context of the mechanism described, the role of the catalyst is to provide specific sites for the activation of alkane molecules. These sites are typically associated with the presence of metal centers, such as tantalum, which can facilitate the breaking and reformation of alkane bonds. The formation of alkenes is a critical step, as these intermediates are then subjected to further reactions on acidic sites within the catalyst matrix. These acidic sites enable the oligomerization of alkenes, leading to the formation of aromatic compounds and other higher hydrocarbons.

The selectivity of the alkane metathesis process depends on the balance between the rate of alkane activation, the efficiency of alkenes formation, and the subsequent reactions on the acidic sites. Catalyst performance is influenced by factors such as the dispersion of metal centers within the silica support, the acidity of the acidic sites, and the stability of the catalyst over multiple reaction cycles.

The mechanism also highlights the importance of temperature and reaction conditions in controlling the distribution of products. For instance, the introduction of cyclic alkane feedstocks can lead to the formation of cyclic products, whereas linear alkane feedstocks might yield predominantly linear products. The ability to control these parameters allows for the optimization of the alkane metathesis process to achieve desired product distributions.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex interplay of activation, intermediate formation, and subsequent reactions on both metal and acidic sites within the catalyst. This mechanism enables the selective conversion of alkane molecules into a wide range of hydrocarbons, including aromatic compounds, and underscores the importance of understanding the detailed chemistry of these reactions for the development of efficient and versatile catalyst systems.

烷烃互变异构催化由硅基支持钽氢化物进行时，涉及一个双位点方案，其中线性与环状烷烃的转化通过形成关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）发生。双位点方案指的是同时激活催化剂上的两个不同位点，允许烷烃分子按顺序转化为烯烃，并最终转化为各种烃类物质。

在描述的机制中，催化剂的作用是提供特定的位点以激活烷烃分子。这些位点通常与金属中心的存在相关联，这些金属中心可以促进烷烃键的断裂和重组。烯烃的形成是一个关键步骤，因为这些中间体随后在催化剂矩阵内的酸性位点上经历进一步反应。这些酸性位点使烯烃的多聚化成为可能，从而导致芳香化合物和其他高碳化合物的形成。

选择性取决于烷烃活化速率、烯烃形成效率以及酸性位点后续反应之间的平衡。催化剂性能受金属中心在硅基支持物中的分散度、酸性位点的酸性和催化剂在多次反应周期中的稳定性等因素的影响。

该机制强调了温度和反应条件控制产物分布的重要性。例如，使用环状烷烃原料可能会导致环状产物的形成，而使用线性烷烃原料则可能主要得到线性产物。通过控制这些参数，可以优化烷烃互变异构过程，以实现所需的产品分布。

总之，硅基支持钽氢化物催化下的烷烃互变异构机制涉及复杂相互作用的激活、中间体形成和随后在金属与酸性位点上的反应。这一机制使得将烷烃分子高效转化为一系列烃类物质，包括芳香化合物，并强调理解这些反应细节对于开发高效且多功能催化剂系统的重要性。

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a two-site scheme where linear and cyclic alkane transformations occur through the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. This mechanism contributes to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. Ethylene is identified as the primary product from methane conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, with its formation and subsequent oligomerization on acidic sites leading to aromatic products. The introduction of cyclic alkane (C2H4) as a reactant shows similar product distributions and catalytic behavior as methane, demonstrating that ethylene is the primary product, and its secondary reactions occur on acidic sites not requiring the presence of molybdenum.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps. Initially, the alkane is reduced by the catalyst to form alkenes. This reduction process is crucial for the subsequent formation of the desired products. The catalyst supports the formation of metallacyclobutanes, which play a pivotal role in the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes. The key intermediates in this process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The catalyst's ability to facilitate these reactions depends on its structure and the nature of the supporting material. The selectivity of the process is influenced by factors such as reaction conditions, the type of alkane, and the specific properties of the catalyst. The catalyst performance is evaluated based on the efficiency of the alkane conversion, the yield of the desired products, and the selectivity towards those products.
