[1] "Dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene occurs over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst at 700 under non-oxidizing conditions."
[2] "Following an initial induction period,during which CH4 reactant reduces the original Mo 6+ ions in the zeolite to Mo2C and deposition of coke occurs, a benzene selectivity of,,, 70% at a CH4 conversion of 8-10% could be sustained for more than 16 h."
[3] "Initial activation of CH4 reactant occurs on M02C sites, leading to the formation of C2H4 as the primary product. The latter then undergoes subsequent oligomerization reactions on acidic sites of the zeolite to form aromatic products."
[4] "Ethylene appears to be the most likely initial product of CH4 conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, since its selectivity increases continuously with increasing reaction space velocity, while those of all other products simultaneously decrease."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, linear and cyclic alkane transformations take place through the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The processes involve the formation of alkenes by the breaking of alkane bonds and the subsequent formation of metallacyclobutanes by the rearrangement of these alkenes. These metallacyclobutanes can then undergo further reactions to form cyclic alkane structures. The one-site scheme typically refers to a single catalytic site responsible for the alkane metathesis reaction. The factors contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance include the stability and activity of the catalyst, the structure of the alkane substrate, and the reaction conditions. The selectivity towards specific products is influenced by the balance between competing reaction pathways and the ability of the catalyst to facilitate the desired reactions.

催化硅基钽氢化物的烷烃互变异构的全面机制涉及两站点和单站点方案。在两站点方案中，线性和环烷烃通过中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷的形成和作用进行转化。过程包括通过断裂烷烃键形成烯烃，随后通过这些烯烃的重排形成金属环丁烷。这些金属环丁烷可以进一步反应形成环烷结构。单站点方案通常指的是单一催化位点负责烷烃互变异构反应。影响反应选择性和催化剂性能的因素包括催化剂的稳定性和活性、烷烃底物的结构以及反应条件。产物选择性的确定受竞争反应途径之间平衡的影响，并且催化剂促进所需反应的能力也会影响产物的选择性。
