[1] "Dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene occurs over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst at 700 under non-oxidizing conditions."
[2] "Following an initial induction period,during which CH4 reactant reduces the original Mo 6+ ions in the zeolite to Mo2C and deposition of coke occurs, a benzene selectivity of,,, 70% at a CH4 conversion of 8-10% could be sustained for more than 16 h."
[3] "Initial activation of CH4 reactant occurs on M02C sites, leading to the formation of C2H4 as the primary product. The latter then undergoes subsequent oligomerization reactions on acidic sites of the zeolite to form aromatic products."
[4] "Ethylene appears to be the most likely initial product of CH4 conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, since its selectivity increases continuously with increasing reaction space velocity, while those of all other products simultaneously decrease."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a two-site and one-site scheme. In the two-site scheme, linear and cyclic alkane transformations occur through the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The processes involve the initial reduction of tantalum hydride to form alkenes, followed by the rearrangement of these alkenes to form cyclic alkane intermediates. These intermediates then undergo further transformations to produce the desired products. The one-site scheme refers to the direct conversion of alkane molecules to desired products without the need for intermediate alkenes or metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the presence of these intermediates, the specific pathways of the reactions, and the efficiency of the catalyst in facilitating these transformations.

催化硅支持钽氢的烷烃裂解机制涉及双站点和单站点方案。在双站点方案中，线性和环烷烃的转换通过形成和作用于关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）发生。过程包括初始将钽氢还原形成烯烃，随后这些烯烃的重排形成环烷烃中间体。这些中间体然后进一步转化以产生所需的产物。单站点方案指的是直接将烷烃分子转化为所需产品，而不需要中间烯烃或金属环丁烷。催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能受这些中间体的存在、反应路径的特定性质以及催化剂促进这些转化效率的影响。
