[1] "CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]."
[2] "Apart from the substitutional sites occupied by Cu 2+ ions both on the surface and in the bulk of thoria, characterized by A 1 and A 2 signals."
[3] "The purpose of this present work is to examine the influence of copper content on thoria for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."
[4] "CuTh oxide catalysts are active and selective in the formation of ethene and propene, but the activity and selectivity change with the nature of the alkane."
[5] "The conversion of ethane and the selectivity in ethylene are significant at high copper contents."
[6] "The selectivity in ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by MI, M 2 and D signals."
[7] "In the case of propane, the catalytic activity may be due to the presence of Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface (MI, M 2 and D) since the formation of CuO crystallites particularly at high copper content (Cu/Th > 0.25) limits the conversion."
[8] "The decrease of the selectivity in propene when the conversion of propane increases has already been discussed by Kung and Volta [8, 93 for the consecutive oxidation reactions."
[9] "In our case the highest value of K has been estimated at 0.033 for Cu/Th=0.1."

This study examines the influence of copper content on thoria for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The CuTh oxide catalysts are active and selective in forming ethene and propene, but their activity and selectivity vary depending on the type of alkane used. High copper content leads to significant conversion of ethane and enhanced selectivity in ethylene production. The selectivity in ethylene correlates with copper(II) sites, while the catalytic activity of propane depends on Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface. The formation of CuO crystals at high copper content reduces conversion rates. The selectivity in propene decreases as the conversion of propane increases, similar to findings by Kung and Volta. In this study, the highest selectivity in propene (K=0.033) was observed at a Cu/Th atomic ratio of 0.1.

本研究探讨了铜含量对氧化脱氢作用于乙烷和丙烷时钍氧化物的影响。这些CuTh氧化催化剂在形成乙烯和丙烯时具有活性和选择性，但它们的活性和选择性取决于所使用的烷烃类型。高铜含量导致乙烷转化显著，并提高了乙烯的选择性。乙烯的选择性与铜(II)位点相关联，而丙烷的催化活性依赖于固态表面的Cu 2+ 离子。在高铜含量下形成的CuO晶体限制了转化率。随着丙烷转化率的增加，丙烯的选择性降低，这类似于Kung和Volta的研究结果。在本研究中，在Cu/Th原子比为0.1时观察到了最高的丙烯选择性（K=0.033）。
