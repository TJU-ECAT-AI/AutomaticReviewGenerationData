[CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique. Apart from the substitutional sites occupied by Cu 2+ ions both on the surface and in the bulk of thoria, characterized by A 1 and A 2 signals, respectively, at atomic ratios Cu/Th < 0.01, other Cu 2+ ions, characterized by M I, M 2 and D signals, occupying different sites on the surface of CuTh oxide catalysts (Cu/Th > 0.01) were susceptible to H 2 and/or 02 treatment at 108. In particular, copper(II) ion pairs (D) can be formed from one copper(II) ion, reducible by hydrogen, and another one corresponding to substitutional surface sites (AI), which remains stable towards hydrogen. From Cu/Th> 0.25, CuO crystallites are formed on the catalyst surface, in particular when the solid is treated by a redox cycle. In addition, the relative intensities of the above signals have been measured for different Cu/Th ratios (Fig. ib). The A I and A 2 signal intensities reached a maximum for a low copper content (Cu/Th < 0.1) and disappeared rapidly before the atomic ratio reached 0.25. This disappearance can be due to the fact that at high copper concentration, the formation of substitutional sites is not possible. The MI, M 2 and D signal intensities seem to be correlated. These signals rapidly increase from Cu/Th=0.01 to a maximum value for Cu/Th=0.25, then a significant decrease in the intensities is observed. This decrease has been correlated with the formation of a large amount of copper oxide during the preparation step of the catalysts and calcination at high temperatures.]

[Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane or propane was carried out at 823 K in a dynamic flow microreactor atmospheric pressure using a mixture composition of 6:3:91 for C 2 (or C3):O2:He. The total flow rate was 60 cm 3 min -I. The catalyst sample weighed 0.1 g. The catalyst was heated under the reaction mixture at a linear rate of 4.6 K min. The reaction products were quantitatively analyzed by two gas chromatographs.]

[Table la summarizes the results obtained on CuTh oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. Besides the desired ethylene, carbon monoxide and specifically carbon dioxide were major products. The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2). The total conversion of ethan was ca. 13.5 mol %, however, only 9.3 mol % of the products was ethylene. Pure thoria gave the weakest activity, only 2.4% of conversion has been detected. On the other side, the selectivity in ethylene increases with the copper content and decreases for Cu/Th > 0.25 (Fig. 2a).]

[As in the case of ethane, the CuTh oxide catalysts are active and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Figure 2b and Table ib show clearly that the conversion of propane is closely correlated to the copper concentration ThO 2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is less than 0.25 and it remains constant for larger atomic ratios. The conversion in propene over the pure ThO 2 support is slightly different from zero. On the other hand, the selectivity in propene increases rapidly with the copper content to reach a maximum at Cu/Th=0.1 and finally decreases for higher atomic ratios.]

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The document provided does not offer a detailed mechanism for alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, focusing instead on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane on copper-thorium oxide catalysts. Therefore, the specific mechanisms for the metathesis reaction cannot be derived directly from the information given.

However, the document does discuss the influence of copper content on the formation of different copper sites (monomers, dimers, and crystallites) on the catalyst surface, which could be analogous to the role of tantalum sites in a hypothetical metathesis catalyst. The formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as intermediates in the oxidative dehydrogenation process might be similar to the role of alkenes in alkane metathesis reactions. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in the described reactions could provide insights into how catalyst design affects the efficiency and selectivity of alkane metathesis.

In conclusion, while the document provides useful information about the role of copper sites and their impact on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, it does not offer a detailed mechanism for alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. Additional research would be required to understand the specific mechanisms and factors influencing alkane metathesis in that context.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的全面机制涉及理解双位点和单位点方案，线性和环烷烃转换过程中的过程，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其作用，以及这些因素如何促进各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能。提供的文档并未提供由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的具体机制，而是专注于铜钍氧化物催化剂在乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢反应中的活性与选择性。因此，具体裂合反应的机制无法直接从给定信息中得出。

然而，文档确实讨论了铜含量对催化剂表面形成不同铜位点（单体、二聚体和晶粒）的影响，这可能与假设的裂合催化剂中钽位点的作用类似。氧化脱氢过程中形成的烯烃和金属环丁烷作为中间体的作用可能类似于烷烃裂合反应中烯烃的作用。描述的反应中催化剂的选择性和性能提供了关于催化剂设计如何影响烷烃裂合效率和选择性的见解。

总之，尽管文档提供了有关铜位点及其在乙烷和丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的作用的有用信息，但并未提供由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合的具体机制。需要进一步的研究来了解特定机制和影响烷烃裂合的因素。
