[CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique. Apart from the substitutional sites occupied by Cu 2+ ions both on the surface and in the bulk of thoria, characterized by A 1 and A 2 signals, respectively, at atomic ratios Cu/Th < 0.01, other Cu 2+ ions, characterized by M I, M 2 and D signals, occupying different sites on the surface of CuTh oxide catalysts (Cu/Th > 0.01) were susceptible to H 2 and/or 02 treatment at 108 different temperatures.]
[Copper(II) ion pairs (D) can be formed from one copper(II) ion, reducible by hydrogen, and another one corresponding to substitutional surface sites (AI), which remains stable towards hydrogen. From Cu/Th> 0.25, CuO crystallites are formed on the catalyst surface, in particular when the solid is treated by a redox cycle.]
[The relative intensities of the above signals have been measured for different Cu/Th ratios. The AI and A 2 signal intensities reached a maximum for a low copper content (Cu/Th < 0.1) and disappeared rapidly before the atomic ratio reached 0.25. The MI, M 2 and D signal intensities seem to be correlated. These signals rapidly increase from Cu/Th=0.01 to a maximum value for Cu/Th=0.25, then a significant decrease in the intensities is observed.]
[The catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane or propane was carried out at 823 K in a dynamic flow microreactor atmospheric pressure using a mixture composition of 6:3:91 for C 2 (or C3):O2:He. The total flow rate was 60 cm 3 min -1. The catalyst sample weighed 0.1 g. The catalyst was heated under the reaction mixture at a linear rate of 4.6 K min -1. The reaction products were quantitatively analyzed by two gas chromatographs.]

The study involves examining the influence of copper content on thoria for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios exhibit distinct properties, including EPR signal characteristics, copper ion pair formations, and the presence of CuO crystallites. The catalysts are active and selective in the formation of ethene and propene, respectively, with activity and selectivity varying based on the nature of the alkane. The research employs EPR techniques to analyze the copper sites on the catalyst surface and assess their reactivity towards hydrogen and oxygen.
