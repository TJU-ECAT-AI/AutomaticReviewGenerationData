[8] "The A1 and A2 signal intensities reached a maximum for a low copper content (Cu/Th < 0.01) and disappeared rapidly before the atomic ratio reached 0.25."
[9] "This disappearance can be due to the fact that at high copper concentration, the formation of substitutional sites is not possible."
[10] "The conversion of ethane and the selectivity in ethylene are significant at high copper contents."
[11] "Consequently, the selectivity in ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by MI, M2, and D signals."
[12] "In the case of propane, the catalytic activity may be due to the presence of Cu2+ ions on the solid surface."
[13] "The decrease of the selectivity in propene when the conversion of propane increases has already been discussed by Kung and Volta [8, 93 for the consecutive oxidation reactions."
[14] "Supposing that the reaction is first order, the selectivity S in propene is given by the following equation: S = (K-1)/(K-1+C)."
[15] "Where K = k1/k2 is the coefficient of selectivity, k1 and k2 are the rate constants of dehydrogenation of propane and oxidation of propene, respectively, and C the conversion of propane."

The study investigates the influence of copper content on thoria for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using CuTh oxide catalysts prepared through calcination of copper and thorium hydroxides at 1073 K for 5 hours. The catalysts were characterized using EPR techniques, revealing differences in copper site concentrations and their effects on the conversion and selectivity of the alkane reactions. For ethane, high copper content leads to increased conversion and selectivity in ethylene production, likely due to the presence of copper(II) sites that facilitate the desired reaction pathway. In contrast, for propane, the catalyst activity is associated with Cu2+ ions on the surface, while the selectivity in propene decreases as the conversion of propane increases, possibly related to competing oxidation reactions. The study also discusses the correlation between catalyst performance and the presence of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes in the transformation processes.

本研究考察了不同铜含量的氧化钍氧化物催化剂（通过将铜和钍氢氧化物在1073 K下煅烧5小时制备）对乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢作用。通过电子自旋共振技术对催化剂进行了表征，揭示了不同铜位点浓度及其对烷烃反应转化率和选择性的影响。对于乙烷，在高铜含量下，可以实现较高的转化率和乙烯产率，这可能归因于促进所需反应路径的铜（II）位点的存在。而对于丙烷，催化剂活性与表面的铜（II）离子相关联，同时随着丙烷转化率的增加，丙烯的选择性降低，这可能与竞争性的氧化反应有关。研究还讨论了催化剂性能与中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）形成过程中的关联。
