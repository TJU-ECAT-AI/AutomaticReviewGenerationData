The CuTh oxide catalysts were synthesized through the calcination of coprecipitated copper and thorium hydroxides at 1073 K for 5 hours under a flow of dry air. Catalyst samples with varying Cu/Th atomic ratios were prepared. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane or propane was conducted at 823 K in a dynamic flow microreactor under atmospheric pressure, using a mixture composed of 6:3:91 for C2 (or C3):O2:He gases. The catalyst sample weighed 0.1 grams, and the catalyst was heated under the reaction mixture. The CuTh oxide catalysts' properties were extensively studied using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques. The study revealed that the presence of copper in thoria influences the oxidative dehydrogenation of both ethane and propane, with the conversion being more significant at higher copper concentrations. For propane, the catalytic activity is attributed to Cu 2+ ions located on the solid surface. In contrast, the selectivity in propene production is linked to Cu 2+ ions in substitutional sites (A1 and A2) rather than other sites. The formation of copper oxide during the catalyst preparation and calcination at high temperatures affects the selectivity in propene production.

铜钍氧化物催化剂通过在1073 K下对共沉淀的铜和钍氢氧化物进行煅烧，持续5小时，并在干燥空气中流化制备。准备了具有不同Cu/Th原子比的催化剂样本。在823 K下，在大气压下的动态流动微反应器中，使用由6:3:91组成的混合气体（C2或C3）：O2：He进行了乙烷或丙烷的氧化脱氢反应。催化剂样本重0.1克，并在反应混合物下加热催化剂。通过电子自旋共振（EPR）技术广泛研究了CuTh氧化物催化剂的性质。研究表明，钍中的铜的存在影响了乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢，更高的铜浓度导致了更显著的转化率。对于丙烷，催化活性归因于位于固体表面的Cu 2+ 离子。相比之下，丙烯选择性与位于取代位点（A1和A2）的Cu 2+ 离子有关，而不是其他位置。在催化剂制备和高温煅烧过程中形成的铜氧化物影响了丙烯的选择性生产。
