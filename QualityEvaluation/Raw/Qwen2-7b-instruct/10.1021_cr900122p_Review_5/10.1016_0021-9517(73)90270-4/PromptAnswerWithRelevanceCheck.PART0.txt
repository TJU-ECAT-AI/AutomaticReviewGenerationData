The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a dual-functional catalyst system consisting of platinum-on-alumina and tungsten oxide-on-silica. The reaction proceeds in two stages: first, dehydrogenation of alkanes to form olefinic intermediates occurs over a dehydrogenation catalyst, followed by the disproportionation of these olefins over a disproportionation catalyst. The sequence of reactions is confirmed through layered bed experiments with individual catalyst components. Excess olefins or hydrogen can inhibit the reaction. Catalyst stability is enhanced with lower temperatures, higher pressures, and an optimal ratio of the two catalyst components. The reaction temperature is typically kept below 425°C to restrict olefin and hydrogen content. When n-butane is the sole reactant, butanes are primarily converted to butenes. The catalyst stability declines linearly with time at constant temperature. The presence of impurities can inhibit the reaction, and the type and concentration of these inhibitors are determined through poisoning experiments. Ammonia affects catalyst activity through a reversible nitrogen purge technique. Excess olefins or hydrogen can deactivate the catalyst, and this inhibition is reversible with hydrogen removal. The mechanism involves the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in alkane conversions.

催化体系由铂基氧化铝和硅基钨氧化物组成。反应分为两步：首先，烷烃在脱氢催化剂上转化为烯烃中间体；随后，在均裂催化剂上对这些烯烃进行均裂。通过单层床实验验证了各催化剂组件的反应序列。超过一定浓度的烯烃或氢气会抑制反应。催化剂稳定性随着温度降低、压力升高以及两催化剂成分比例优化而提高。通常将反应温度控制在425°C以下以限制烯烃和氢气含量。当丁烷是唯一反应物时，丁烷主要转化为丁烯。催化剂活性随恒定温度下时间线性下降。杂质的存在可以抑制反应，通过中毒实验确定其类型和浓度。氨通过氮气吹扫技术影响催化剂活性，且该影响可逆。过量烯烃或氢气可以失活催化剂，但通过氢气去除后可以恢复。机制涉及关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其在反应选择性和催化剂性能中的作用。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a two-step process. First, linear alkanes undergo dehydrogenation to form olefinic intermediates, which then disproportionate over a tungsten oxide-on-silica catalyst. The formation of alkenes plays a crucial role in the transformation, serving as key intermediates. The process is sensitive to impurities, requiring a guard chamber in the feed line to protect against poisoning. The catalyst's performance varies with temperature, pressure, and the ratio of the two components. The study also discusses the impact of excess olefins and hydrogen on the reaction, noting that an excess of these can inhibit the redistribution activity. Catalyst stability is improved with lower temperatures and higher pressures. The research further explores the role of mixed butanes and isobutanes, highlighting their reactivity patterns. The dehydrogenation catalyst is prepared using gamma alumina impregnated with a solution of platinum and lithium nitrate. Instrument-grade butanes are used in the experiments, pumped through the reactor at a constant rate.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a dual-functional catalyst system. This system includes a platinum-on-alumina component for dehydrogenation and a tungsten oxide-on-silica component for olefin disproportionation. The process starts with the formation of low concentrations of olefinic intermediates through dehydrogenation. These olefins then undergo disproportionation over the tungsten oxide catalyst, resulting in the formation of alkanes and olefins. The reaction sequence is confirmed through layered bed experiments. Catalyst stability and activity are influenced by temperature, pressure, and the ratio of the two catalyst components. The system is highly sensitive to impurities, which can lead to poisoning. The mechanism involves the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, contributing to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions. Excess olefin and hydrogen can inhibit the redistribution reaction, possibly by depleting hydrogen or blocking active sites on the platinum catalyst.

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The literature discusses the use of dual-functional catalyst systems comprising platinum-on-alumina mixed with tungsten oxide-on-silica for the disproportionation of alkanes. The process involves the formation of olefinic intermediates over a dehydrogenation catalyst, followed by their disproportionation over a disproportionation catalyst. Product olefins are then rehydrogenated to corresponding paraffins. The sequence of reactions is confirmed through layered bed experiments involving individual catalyst components.

The mechanism of the molecular redistribution reaction is sensitive to poisoning by impurities and requires protection by a guard chamber in the feed line. The catalyst system is designed to manage the complex mixture of reacting species and products generated from a single reactant, leading to cross-reactions between different classes of hydrocarbons.

The literature also explores the effect of temperature, catalyst components, and reaction conditions on the activity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, the work is carried out at temperatures below 425°C, under conditions that restrict olefin and hydrogen content to very low levels. This helps to minimize skeletal isomerization and cracking, improving catalyst stability.

The reaction of alkane mixtures, such as n-butane and isobutane, shows that the reactivity of n-butane is slightly decreased as the feed isobutane concentration increases to 70 wt%. However, even with a large excess of n-butane, a significant fraction of isobutane reacts, producing both branched and straight-chain products.

The mechanism of the disproportionation reaction is considered in terms of olefin intermediates, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes plays a crucial role in the transformation of linear alkanes to shorter and longer carbon chains. The literature supports the concept of a stepwise mechanistic theory involving these intermediates.

The layered bed experiments confirm the involvement of olefinic intermediates and demonstrate the necessity of both the Pt and WO3 components for the overall reaction. The results show that olefinic intermediates are involved, and both the Pt and WO3 components are required, not merely the Pt.

The ratio of Pt:WO3 components influences the stability of the catalyst system. Higher proportions of Pt lead to lower fouling rates and a lower value of the quantity, C-/ (C,+Cd=), indicating improved stability.

The sensitivity of the catalyst system to water, ammonia, oxygen, and hydrogen sulfide is discussed. Water, ammonia, and oxygen inhibit the reaction, while hydrogen sulfide completely deactivates the catalyst. Excess olefin or hydrogen also inhibits the reaction.

The effect of added olefin and hydrogen on the redistribution of n-butane is studied. The presence of excess olefin over the amount generated by the dehydrogenation catalyst is detrimental to redistribution activity. Similarly, excess hydrogen inhibits the reaction through a mass action effect, affecting the hydrogenation step.

In summary, the literature provides insights into the complex mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, emphasizing the importance of catalyst components, reaction conditions, and the involvement of key intermediates in achieving efficient alkane conversions.

分析由硅负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃互变异构的全面机制涉及理解双站点和单站点方案，线性和环烷烃转化过程中涉及的过程，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其在各种烷烃转换中的作用，以及这些因素如何贡献于反应选择性和催化剂性能。

文献讨论了铂-氧化铝与二氧化硅支持钨氧化物混合物用于异构烷基化反应的双重功能催化剂系统。该过程涉及脱氢催化剂中形成的低浓度烯烃的异构化，然后是过氧化物催化剂中这些烯烃的异构化。产物烯烃随后被还原成相应的烷烃。通过分层床实验验证了涉及单个催化剂组件的序列反应。

分子重分布反应机制对杂质敏感，并需要在进料管道中设置防护室。设计催化剂系统以管理从单一反应物生成的复杂反应物种和产物的混合物，导致不同类别的烃之间的交叉反应。

文献还探讨了温度、催化剂组分和反应条件对催化剂活性和稳定性的影响。例如，工作是在低于425°C的温度下进行的，限制了反应流体中烯烃和氢气含量非常低。这有助于最小化骨架异构化和裂解，提高催化剂稳定性。

烷基混合物（正丁烷和异丁烷）的反应表明，当异丁烷的含量增加到70 wt%时，正丁烷的反应性略有降低。然而，即使有大量过量的正丁烷存在，异丁烷仍能产生大量反应，产生支链和直链产品。

异构化反应被认为是通过图1所示的烯烃中间体进行的。烯烃和金属环丁烷的形成在将线性烷烃转化为较短和较长碳链中起着关键作用。文献支持逐步机制理论，涉及这些中间体。

分层床实验证明了烯烃中间体的存在，并证明了Pt和WO3成分的必要性，而不是仅Pt。

Pt：WO3成分的比例影响催化剂系统的稳定性。更高的Pt比例导致更低的腐蚀率和较低的量，C-/（C，+Cd=），表示改善了稳定性。

水、氨、氧气和硫化氢对催化剂系统的敏感性进行了讨论。水、氨和氧气抑制反应，而硫化氢完全使催化剂失活。过剩的烯烃或氢也抑制了反应。

对添加的烯烃和氢对正丁烷异构化的影响进行了研究。过量烯烃超过脱氢催化剂产生的量对异构化活动有害。同样，过量氢通过质量作用效应抑制反应，影响氢化步骤。

综上所述，文献提供了有关由硅负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃互变异构的复杂机制的见解，强调了催化剂组分、反应条件和关键中间体的参与在实现有效烷烃转换中的重要性。
