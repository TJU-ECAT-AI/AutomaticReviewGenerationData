The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a two-step process. First, linear alkanes undergo dehydrogenation to form olefinic intermediates, which then disproportionate over a tungsten oxide-on-silica catalyst. The formation of alkenes plays a crucial role in the transformation, serving as key intermediates. The process is sensitive to impurities, requiring a guard chamber in the feed line to protect against poisoning. The catalyst's performance varies with temperature, pressure, and the ratio of the two components. The study also discusses the impact of excess olefins and hydrogen on the reaction, noting that an excess of these can inhibit the redistribution activity. Catalyst stability is improved with lower temperatures and higher pressures. The research further explores the role of mixed butanes and isobutanes, highlighting their reactivity patterns. The dehydrogenation catalyst is prepared using gamma alumina impregnated with a solution of platinum and lithium nitrate. Instrument-grade butanes are used in the experiments, pumped through the reactor at a constant rate.

烷烃在硅基钽氢催化剂的作用下进行重排，其机制涉及两步过程。第一步是线性烷烃经历脱氢作用形成烯烃中间体，随后这些烯烃在钨氧化物-二氧化硅催化剂上进行重排。烯烃在这个过程中扮演着关键的中间体角色。此过程对杂质敏感，需要在进料线上设置保护装置以防中毒。催化剂性能受温度、压力以及两种组分的比例影响。实验发现降低温度和提高压力能提高催化剂稳定性。研究还探讨了过量烯烃和氢气对反应的影响，指出过量的这些物质可能抑制重排活性。此外，研究讨论了混合丁烷和异丁烷的反应性差异。脱氢催化剂通过将γ型铝酸盐浸渍在铂和硝酸锂溶液中制备。实验使用了仪器级的正丁烷和异丁烷，在恒定速率的鲁斯卡泵作用下泵入反应器。
