The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a dual-functional catalyst system consisting of platinum-on-alumina and tungsten oxide-on-silica. The reaction proceeds in two stages: first, dehydrogenation of alkanes to form olefinic intermediates occurs over a dehydrogenation catalyst, followed by the disproportionation of these olefins over a disproportionation catalyst. The sequence of reactions is confirmed through layered bed experiments with individual catalyst components. Excess olefins or hydrogen can inhibit the reaction. Catalyst stability is enhanced with lower temperatures, higher pressures, and an optimal ratio of the two catalyst components. The reaction temperature is typically kept below 425°C to restrict olefin and hydrogen content. When n-butane is the sole reactant, butanes are primarily converted to butenes. The catalyst stability declines linearly with time at constant temperature. The presence of impurities can inhibit the reaction, and the type and concentration of these inhibitors are determined through poisoning experiments. Ammonia affects catalyst activity through a reversible nitrogen purge technique. Excess olefins or hydrogen can deactivate the catalyst, and this inhibition is reversible with hydrogen removal. The mechanism involves the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in alkane conversions.

催化体系由铂基氧化铝和硅基钨氧化物组成。反应分为两步：首先，烷烃在脱氢催化剂上转化为烯烃中间体；随后，在均裂催化剂上对这些烯烃进行均裂。通过单层床实验验证了各催化剂组件的反应序列。超过一定浓度的烯烃或氢气会抑制反应。催化剂稳定性随着温度降低、压力升高以及两催化剂成分比例优化而提高。通常将反应温度控制在425°C以下以限制烯烃和氢气含量。当丁烷是唯一反应物时，丁烷主要转化为丁烯。催化剂活性随恒定温度下时间线性下降。杂质的存在可以抑制反应，通过中毒实验确定其类型和浓度。氨通过氮气吹扫技术影响催化剂活性，且该影响可逆。过量烯烃或氢气可以失活催化剂，但通过氢气去除后可以恢复。机制涉及关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成及其在反应选择性和催化剂性能中的作用。
