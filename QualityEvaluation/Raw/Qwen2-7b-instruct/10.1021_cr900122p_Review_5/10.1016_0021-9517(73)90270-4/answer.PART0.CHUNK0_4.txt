The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation of low concentrations of olefinic intermediates over a dehydrogenation catalyst, followed by disproportionation of these olefins over a disproportionation catalyst. The olefins are then rehydrogenated to the corresponding paraffins. This overall process is termed molecular redistribution rather than simply disproportionation. Straight-chain alkanes exhibit higher reactivity than branched alkanes. An excess of either olefins or hydrogen over the low concentrations formed as reaction intermediates inhibits the reaction. Catalyst stability increases with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure. The reaction sequence was confirmed by layered bed experiments. In early studies, propylene was added with the n-butane reactant to investigate the effect on the redistribution of n-butane.

催化由硅支持的钽氢化物的烷烃互变异构机制涉及在脱氢催化剂上形成低浓度的烯烃中间体，随后是这些烯烃在异构化催化剂上的异构化。烯烃然后被还原成相应的烷烃。整个过程被称为分子重分布而不是简单的异构化。直链烷烃的反应性高于支链烷烃。当存在过量的烯烃或氢时，会抑制反应。随着温度的降低和压力的增加，催化剂稳定性提高。反应序列通过层床实验得到证实。早期的研究中，向丁烷反应物中添加丙烯以研究丁烷的异构化效果。
