The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a dual-functional catalyst system. This system includes a platinum-on-alumina component for dehydrogenation and a tungsten oxide-on-silica component for olefin disproportionation. The process starts with the formation of low concentrations of olefinic intermediates through dehydrogenation. These olefins then undergo disproportionation over the tungsten oxide catalyst, resulting in the formation of alkanes and olefins. The reaction sequence is confirmed through layered bed experiments. Catalyst stability and activity are influenced by temperature, pressure, and the ratio of the two catalyst components. The system is highly sensitive to impurities, which can lead to poisoning. The mechanism involves the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, contributing to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions. Excess olefin and hydrogen can inhibit the redistribution reaction, possibly by depleting hydrogen or blocking active sites on the platinum catalyst.
