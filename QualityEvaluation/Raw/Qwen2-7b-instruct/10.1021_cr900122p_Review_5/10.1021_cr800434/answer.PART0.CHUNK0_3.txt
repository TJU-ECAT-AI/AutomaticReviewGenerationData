The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The catalyst facilitates the transfer of double bonds between alkane molecules, leading to the formation of new alkene molecules. In the process of linear alkane transformation, the catalyst enables the breaking and reformation of alkane's carbon-carbon single bonds, creating alkenes as intermediates. For cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism allows for the rearrangement of cycloalkane structures, generating alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. These intermediates play a crucial role in the selective formation of new alkene products, contributing to the high efficiency and specificity of the alkane metathesis reaction. The catalyst's performance is influenced by factors such as the catalyst's surface area, the support's properties, and the presence of metal hydrides, which affect the reaction rate and product selectivity. The catalyst's ability to maintain its activity over multiple reaction cycles is also a critical factor in its overall performance.
