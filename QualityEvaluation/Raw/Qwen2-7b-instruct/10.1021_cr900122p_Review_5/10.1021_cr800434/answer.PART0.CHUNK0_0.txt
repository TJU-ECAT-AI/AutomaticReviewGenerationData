[1] "Zeolites are crystalline microporous materials that are widely applied as catalysts in the chemical industry."
[2] "The first applications of ET to a zeolite system, and the first to heterogeneous catalysts in general, were published by Koster et al. (32, 106) Characterization of an Ag/NaY crystal in 3D showed unequivocally the location of 1040 nm Ag particles inside and outside the NaY structure."
[3] "ET has been used to study various strategies to introduce mesopores in zeolites, namely, steaming, acid leaching, base leaching, and secondary templating during synthesis."
[4] "ET results of the complex gyroid-like 3D pore network were consistent with the proposed space group of Ia3d (135) but showed differences along the [111] zone axis."
[5] "It could be shown that silver particles of <10 nm were uniformly dispersed on the inside and on the outside of the titania agglomerate."
[6] "Quantitative structural information such as the number of Pd particles per surface area (490 μm2), the Pd particle size distribution (4.2 nm radius), and the penetration of the Pd particles into the surface (1.2 nm) could be obtained."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, an alkane molecule binds to the catalyst surface, undergoes an activation step leading to the formation of an alkene intermediate, and then undergoes a rearrangement step to form a new alkane product. The one-site mechanism involves a single binding site where the alkane undergoes direct activation and rearrangement to form the product alkane. Key intermediates in this process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The formation of these intermediates, along with the precise spatial arrangement of the catalyst sites, plays a crucial role in determining the reaction selectivity and the efficiency of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

烷烃金属化催化由硅基钽氢化合物引发的机制涉及两种位点和单一位点方案。在两个位点机制中，一个烷烃分子与催化剂表面结合，经过活化步骤形成烯烃中间体，并且通过重组步骤形成新的烷烃产物。单一位点机制则涉及单个结合位点，在此位点上，烷烃直接经历活化和重组以形成产物烷烃。该过程中关键的中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。这些中间体的形成以及催化剂位点的精确空间排列，在决定反应选择性和催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的效率方面起着至关重要的作用。
