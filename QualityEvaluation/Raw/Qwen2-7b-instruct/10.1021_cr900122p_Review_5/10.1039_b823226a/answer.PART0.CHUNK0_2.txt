The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two distinct schemes: a two-site scheme and a one-site scheme. In the one-site scheme, a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(RSiO)2TaH] 1a, catalytically transforms light alkanes into their lower and higher homologues at moderate temperatures. The selectivity for the formation of the Cn+1 product is typically higher than that of the Cn+2 one, aligning with the previously proposed mechanism. For example, in the metathesis of 2-methylpropane using alumina-supported tungsten hydride, W(H)3/Al2O3500, 1b, the conversion reached a maximum at 8% and approximately 37 turnovers (TON) were achieved over 43 hours under specific conditions. Key intermediates in this process include the trisisobutyl tungsten complex 2, [W(CH2CH(CH3)3)]/ Al2O3500, which can undergo an a-H transfer to form 3, and further reactions involving hydrido-tungsta-carbenes 4 and 6a.

The role of catalyst performance in alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as the catalyst's selectivity, stability, and the ability to efficiently facilitate the transfer of carbon atoms between alkane chains. The mechanisms underlying the formation and role of these key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, contribute significantly to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane transformations.

催化作用于硅基支持钽氢的烷烃裂解全面机制涉及两种不同的方案：双位点方案和单一位点方案。在单一位点方案中，通过在二氧化硅上的高度亲电钽氢[(RSiO)2TaH] 1a，在适中的温度下，可以催化地将轻质烷烃转化为其更低和更高同系物。形成Cn+1产品的选择性通常高于Cn+2产品，与之前提出的机制一致。例如，在使用氧化铝支持的钨氢W(H)3/Al2O3500，1b催化2-甲基丙烷时，转化率达到了最大值8%，并在43小时内实现了约37次周转（TON）。关键中间体包括trisisobutyl钨复合物2，[W(CH2CH(CH3)3)]/ Al2O3500，可以从初始化步骤中产生，并进行a-H转移以形成3，随后进一步涉及氢化钨碳烯4和6a的反应。

催化剂性能在烷烃转化中的作用受催化剂选择性、稳定性以及有效促进烷烃链之间碳原子转移的能力的影响。这些关键中间体的形成和作用，包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，对反应选择性和催化剂性能在各种烷烃转换中起着至关重要的作用。
