The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the transfer of a single carbon from one alkane chain to another through the cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds. This process primarily occurs at moderate temperatures and can transform any light alkane into its lower and higher homologues. The catalyst, [(RSiO)2TaH] 1a, is highly electrophilic and supported on silica. Key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the displacement of alkyl groups via s-bond metathesis and the formation of key intermediates. Additionally, branched alkanes, like 2-methylpropane, can be transformed into higher homologues, such as 2,3-dimethylbutane, through the transfer of two carbons, which is unexpected in conventional alkane metathesis mechanisms.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的全面烷烃裂合机制涉及通过断裂和形成CH和CC键从一个烷烃链向另一个转移单个碳。该过程主要在温和温度下进行，并能将任何轻质烷烃转化为其更低和更高同系物。催化剂[(RSiO)2TaH] 1a高度亲电并支持在二氧化硅上。关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能受因素影响，如通过s键裂合移除烷基团和形成关键中间体。此外，像2-甲基丙烷这样的支链烷烃可以通过转移两个碳原子转化为更高同系物，这在传统的烷烃裂合机制中是出乎意料的。

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two-site and one-site schemes. The two-site scheme typically leads to the transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues, while the one-site approach, as discovered in 1997, enables the catalytic transformation of any light alkane into its lower and higher homologues under moderate temperatures. Kinetic studies on propane metathesis reveal the formation of olefins and H2 as primary products. The selectivity for the formation of the Cn+1 product is higher than that of the Cn+2 one, aligning with the proposed mechanism. In the case of 2-methylpropane, it is transformed to 2,3-dimethylbutane with high selectivity, which is an unexpected transfer of two carbons in alkane metathesis. Steric reasons explain why the productive metathesis of 2-methylpropene involving 7a is disfavored, accounting for its moderate activity compared to the metathesis of linear alkenes. The key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

烷烃的双键互换催化由硅支持的钽氢化物的全面机制涉及两个位点和单一位点方案。两个位点方案通常导致较低烷烃转化为较高同系物，而单一位点方法在1997年被发现，能够使任何轻质烷烃在温和温度下转化为其较低和较高同系物。对丙烷互换的动态研究揭示了反应的主要产物为烯烃和H2。形成Cn+1产品的选择性高于Cn+2，与提出的机制一致。对于2-甲基丙烷，它被转化为2,3-二甲基丁烷，显示出高选择性，这是烷烃互换中碳原子转移的意外例子。立体化学原因解释了为什么2-甲基丙烯的活性较弱，因为它不能有效转化为2,3-二甲基丁烯。这与线性二烯的互换相比，表现出适度的活性。关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们共同决定了各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能。

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two distinct schemes: a two-site scheme and a one-site scheme. In the one-site scheme, a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(RSiO)2TaH] 1a, catalytically transforms light alkanes into their lower and higher homologues at moderate temperatures. The selectivity for the formation of the Cn+1 product is typically higher than that of the Cn+2 one, aligning with the previously proposed mechanism. For example, in the metathesis of 2-methylpropane using alumina-supported tungsten hydride, W(H)3/Al2O3500, 1b, the conversion reached a maximum at 8% and approximately 37 turnovers (TON) were achieved over 43 hours under specific conditions. Key intermediates in this process include the trisisobutyl tungsten complex 2, [W(CH2CH(CH3)3)]/ Al2O3500, which can undergo an a-H transfer to form 3, and further reactions involving hydrido-tungsta-carbenes 4 and 6a.

The role of catalyst performance in alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as the catalyst's selectivity, stability, and the ability to efficiently facilitate the transfer of carbon atoms between alkane chains. The mechanisms underlying the formation and role of these key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, contribute significantly to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane transformations.

催化作用于硅基支持钽氢的烷烃裂解全面机制涉及两种不同的方案：双位点方案和单一位点方案。在单一位点方案中，通过在二氧化硅上的高度亲电钽氢[(RSiO)2TaH] 1a，在适中的温度下，可以催化地将轻质烷烃转化为其更低和更高同系物。形成Cn+1产品的选择性通常高于Cn+2产品，与之前提出的机制一致。例如，在使用氧化铝支持的钨氢W(H)3/Al2O3500，1b催化2-甲基丙烷时，转化率达到了最大值8%，并在43小时内实现了约37次周转（TON）。关键中间体包括trisisobutyl钨复合物2，[W(CH2CH(CH3)3)]/ Al2O3500，可以从初始化步骤中产生，并进行a-H转移以形成3，随后进一步涉及氢化钨碳烯4和6a的反应。

催化剂性能在烷烃转化中的作用受催化剂选择性、稳定性以及有效促进烷烃链之间碳原子转移的能力的影响。这些关键中间体的形成和作用，包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，对反应选择性和催化剂性能在各种烷烃转换中起着至关重要的作用。

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides includes both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, the reaction involves the dehydrogenation of paraffins through CH bond activation, followed by the formation of an olefin and a metal-hydride. In the one-site scheme, the alkane metathesis reaction occurs primarily through the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds. 

For linear alkanes, the selectivity for forming the Cn+1 product is generally higher than that for the Cn+2 product, which aligns with the proposed mechanism. The selectivity ratios for the formation of 2,3-dimethylbutane (2,3-DMB) and ethane, as well as 2-methylbutane and propane, are nearly equal, indicating a balanced reaction pathway. 

The metathesis of 2-methylpropene is typically considered a degenerate process when using classical olefin metathesis catalysts. However, the study reports that the alumina-supported tungsten hydride catalyst enables the productive self-metathesis of 2-methylpropene into 2,3-dimethylbutene, which is a primary product. 

The key intermediates in this mechanism include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Alkenes are formed through olefin metathesis reactions, while metallacyclobutanes are derived from the interaction between the substituents in the [1,2] or [1,3]-positions, influencing the stability and formation of the intermediates. These factors contribute to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The tungsten alkyl groups generated in the reaction can be further cleaved by hydrogen gas (H2), releasing products such as ethane, 2-methylbutane, 2,3-DMB, and 2,4-dimethylpentane. This step is crucial for the liberation of the desired products from the catalyst.

烷烃裂合催化由硅基支持的钽氢化物包括两种和单一站点方案。在两个站点方案中，反应涉及通过CH键活化脱氢烷烃，随后形成烯烃和金属氢化物。在单一站点方案中，烷烃裂合主要通过从一个链向另一个链转移单个碳原子发生，通过CH和CC键的断裂和形成。

对于线性烷烃，形成Cn+1产物的选择性通常高于Cn+2产物，这与提出的机制相符合。形成2,3-二甲基丁烷（2,3-DMB）与乙烷以及2-甲基丁烷与丙烷的选择性比率接近，表明平衡的反应途径。

2-甲基丙烯的裂合通常被认为是使用经典烯烃裂合催化剂的退化过程。然而，研究表明，铝基氧化物支持的钨氢化物催化剂能够使2-甲基丙烯自我裂合为2,3-二甲基丁烯，这是其主要产品。

该机制的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。烯烃通过烯烃裂合反应形成，而金属环丁烷源自与[1,2]或[1,3]-位置的取代基的相互作用，影响中间体的稳定性和形成。这些因素对反应选择性和催化剂性能在各种烷烃转换中的贡献至关重要。

生成的钨烷基团可以通过氢气（H2）进一步裂解，释放出如乙烷、2-甲基丁烷、2,3-DMB和2,4-二甲基戊烷等产物。这一步骤对于从催化剂中释放所需产物至关重要。

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two main schemes: a two-site approach and a one-site scheme. In the two-site approach, the reaction consists of transferring a single carbon from one alkane chain to another, involving both the cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds. The one-site scheme utilizes multifunctional single-site catalysts capable of alkane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and olefin hydrogenation. For linear alkanes, this reaction typically results in the formation of lower (Cn) and higher (Cn+2) homologues, with the selectivity favoring the Cn+2 product. However, in the case of branched alkanes like 2-methylpropane, the reaction can be unexpectedly transformed into higher homologues, such as 2,3-dimethylbutane, through the transfer of two carbons. The catalyst, W(H)3/Al2O3500, facilitates this transformation with high selectivity. The catalyst's ability to catalyze the productive metathesis of 2-methylpropene into 2,3-dimethylbutene is noteworthy, as it represents a unique pathway for branched alkane metathesis. This catalyst system also exhibits high octane number in the resulting products, enhancing its potential for fuel applications. The detailed mechanisms involve key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, contributing to the reaction's selectivity and efficiency in various alkane conversions.

催化二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的烷烃裂合机制涉及两种主要方案：双位点方法和单位点方案。在双位点方法中，反应包括将一个碳原子从一个烷烃链转移到另一个烷烃链，涉及CH和CC键的断裂和形成。单位点方案利用多功能单点催化剂，能够实现烷烃脱氢、烯烃裂合和烯烃氢化。对于线性烷烃，该反应通常导致形成更低（Cn）和更高（Cn+2）同系物，选择性倾向于Cn+2产物。然而，在2-甲基丙烷等支链烷烃的情况下，反应可以意外地转化为更高同系物，如2,3-二甲基丁烷，通过转移两个碳原子。催化剂W(H)3/Al2O3500能够以高选择性促进这一转化。该催化剂系统催化2-甲基丙烯转化为2,3-二甲基丁烯的独特途径是值得注意的，这代表了分支烷烃裂合的独特途径。该催化剂系统还具有高辛烷值的产物，增强了其在燃料应用中的潜力。详细机制涉及关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷，这些贡献了反应的选择性和效率，在各种烷烃转换中。
