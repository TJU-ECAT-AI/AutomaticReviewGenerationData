          "[1] The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues remains a great challenge in chemistry, in particular for branched alkanes in view of fuel needs."
          "[2] Using a single site approach, we reported in 1997 the discovery of a new reaction, the alkane metathesis where a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(RSiO)2TaH] 1a,could catalytically transform at moderate temperatures any light alkane into its lower and higher homologues."
          "[3] This reaction consists mainly in the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds (Scheme 1)."
          "[4] Interestingly, 2,3-dimethylbutene has the same carbon skeleton as the major product formed during the metathesis of 2-methylpropane i.e. 2,3-DMB."

          "[1] Typically propane gives mainly ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) along with methane and higher C5+ alkanes."
          "[2] Ethylbenzene and methane can also be obtained by cross-metathesis between toluene and ethane."
          "[3] This reaction consists mainly in the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds."
          "[4] The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues remains a great challenge in chemistry, in particular for branched alkanes in view of fuel needs."
          "[5] Herein, we report that 2-methylpropane, in the presence of the W(H)3/Al2O3500 catalyst, is unexpectedly transformed to 2,3-dimethylbutane (2,3-DMB) with a high selectivity."
          "[6] Interestingly, 2,3-DMB exhibits the highest octane number (RON = 104) among the hexane isomers."
          "[7] Similarly, the W(H)3/Al2O3500 catalyst, also unexpectedly transforms 2-methylpropene to 2,3-dimethylbutenes (2,3-DMB=) with a good selectivity which is the first case of productive metathesis of 2-methylpropene."
          "[8] Typically, when 2-methylpropane was passed over the alumina-supported tungsten hydride, W(H)3/Al2O3500, its conversion reached a maximum at 8% and approximately 37 TON were achieved over 43 h."

          "[11] 2-Methylpropene was observed (up to 3.1%) among the products of 2-methylpropane metathesis and therefore, its metathesis was also checked over 1b in a continuous flow reactor."

          The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two main schemes: a two-site approach and a one-site scheme. In the two-site approach, the reaction consists of transferring a single carbon from one alkane chain to another, involving both the cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds. The one-site scheme utilizes multifunctional single-site catalysts capable of alkane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and olefin hydrogenation. For linear alkanes, this reaction typically results in the formation of lower (Cn) and higher (Cn+2) homologues, with the selectivity favoring the Cn+2 product. However, in the case of branched alkanes like 2-methylpropane, the reaction can be unexpectedly transformed into higher homologues, such as 2,3-dimethylbutane, through the transfer of two carbons. The catalyst, W(H)3/Al2O3500, facilitates this transformation with high selectivity. The catalyst's ability to catalyze the productive metathesis of 2-methylpropene into 2,3-dimethylbutene is noteworthy, as it represents a unique pathway for branched alkane metathesis. This catalyst system also exhibits high octane number in the resulting products, enhancing its potential for fuel applications.

          二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷烃裂合机制涉及两种主要方案：双位点方法和单位点方案。在双位点方法中，反应包括将一个碳原子从一个烷烃链转移到另一个烷烃链，涉及CH和CC键的断裂和形成。单位点方案利用多功能单点催化剂，能够实现烷烃脱氢、烯烃裂合和烯烃氢化。对于线性烷烃，该反应通常导致形成更低（Cn）和更高（Cn+2）同系物，选择性倾向于Cn+2产物。然而，在2-甲基丙烷等支链烷烃的情况下，反应可以意外地转化为更高同系物，如2,3-二甲基丁烷，通过转移两个碳原子。催化剂W(H)3/Al2O3500能够以高选择性促进这一转化。该催化剂系统催化2-甲基丙烯转化为2,3-二甲基丁烯的独特能力值得注意，因为它代表了分支烷烃裂合的独特途径。该催化剂系统在最终产物中也表现出高辛烷值，提高了其在燃料应用中的潜力。
