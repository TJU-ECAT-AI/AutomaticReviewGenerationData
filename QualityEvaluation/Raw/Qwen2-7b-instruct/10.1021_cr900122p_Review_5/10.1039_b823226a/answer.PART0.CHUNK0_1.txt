[1] "Typically propane gives mainly ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) along with methane and higher C5+ alkanes."
[2] "In all experiments carried out so far, the selectivity for the formation of the Cn+1 product proved to be higher than that of the Cn+2 one, in agreement with the previously proposed mechanism."
[3] "The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues remains a great challenge in chemistry, in particular for branched alkanes in view of fuel needs."
[4] "Using a single site approach, we reported in 1997 the discovery of a new reaction, the alkane metathesis where a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(RSiO)2TaH] 1a,could catalytically transform at moderate temperatures any light alkane into its lower and higher homologues."
[5] "In fact, kinetic studies on propane metathesis, carried out at extremely low contact time in a continuous flow reactor,revealed the primary products of the reaction, namely olefins and H2."
[6] "Interestingly,2,3-dimethylbutene has the same carbon skeleton as the major product formed during the metathesis of 2-methylpropane i.e. 2,3-DMB. These observations confirm that 2-methylpropene is a primary product which leads to a specific mechanistic pathway for 2-methylpropane metathesis as explicated hereafter."
[7] "Productive metathesis of 2-methylpropene involving 7a is thus disfavored for steric reasons which accounts for the fact that it was not reported previously12,13 and a moderate activity is observed with W(H)3/Al2O3500 by comparison with metathesis of linear alkenes, such as propylene."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two-site and one-site schemes. The two-site scheme typically leads to the transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues, while the one-site approach, as discovered in 1997, enables the catalytic transformation of any light alkane into its lower and higher homologues under moderate temperatures. Kinetic studies on propane metathesis reveal the formation of olefins and H2 as primary products. The selectivity for the formation of the Cn+1 product is higher than that of the Cn+2 one, aligning with the proposed mechanism. In the case of 2-methylpropane, it is transformed to 2,3-dimethylbutane with high selectivity, which is an unexpected transfer of two carbons in alkane metathesis. Steric reasons explain why the productive metathesis of 2-methylpropene involving 7a is disfavored, accounting for its moderate activity compared to the metathesis of linear alkenes. The key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

烷烃的双键互换催化由硅支持的钽氢化物的全面机制涉及两个位点和单一位点方案。两个位点方案通常导致较低烷烃转化为较高同系物，而单一位点方法在1997年被发现，能够使任何轻质烷烃在温和温度下转化为其较低和较高同系物。对丙烷互换的动态研究揭示了反应的主要产物为烯烃和H2。形成Cn+1产品的选择性高于Cn+2，与提出的机制一致。对于2-甲基丙烷，它被转化为2,3-二甲基丁烷，显示出高选择性，这是烷烃互换中碳原子转移的意外例子。立体化学原因解释了为什么2-甲基丙烯的活性较弱，因为它不能有效转化为2,3-二甲基丁烯。这与线性二烯的互换相比，表现出适度的活性。关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们共同决定了各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能。
