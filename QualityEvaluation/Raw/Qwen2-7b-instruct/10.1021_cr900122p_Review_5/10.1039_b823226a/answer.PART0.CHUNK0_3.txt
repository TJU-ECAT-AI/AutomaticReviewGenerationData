The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides includes both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, the reaction involves the dehydrogenation of paraffins through CH bond activation, followed by the formation of an olefin and a metal-hydride. In the one-site scheme, the alkane metathesis reaction occurs primarily through the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds. 

For linear alkanes, the selectivity for forming the Cn+1 product is generally higher than that for the Cn+2 product, which aligns with the proposed mechanism. The selectivity ratios for the formation of 2,3-dimethylbutane (2,3-DMB) and ethane, as well as 2-methylbutane and propane, are nearly equal, indicating a balanced reaction pathway. 

The metathesis of 2-methylpropene is typically considered a degenerate process when using classical olefin metathesis catalysts. However, the study reports that the alumina-supported tungsten hydride catalyst enables the productive self-metathesis of 2-methylpropene into 2,3-dimethylbutene, which is a primary product. 

The key intermediates in this mechanism include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Alkenes are formed through olefin metathesis reactions, while metallacyclobutanes are derived from the interaction between the substituents in the [1,2] or [1,3]-positions, influencing the stability and formation of the intermediates. These factors contribute to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The tungsten alkyl groups generated in the reaction can be further cleaved by hydrogen gas (H2), releasing products such as ethane, 2-methylbutane, 2,3-DMB, and 2,4-dimethylpentane. This step is crucial for the liberation of the desired products from the catalyst.

烷烃裂合催化由硅基支持的钽氢化物包括两种和单一站点方案。在两个站点方案中，反应涉及通过CH键活化脱氢烷烃，随后形成烯烃和金属氢化物。在单一站点方案中，烷烃裂合主要通过从一个链向另一个链转移单个碳原子发生，通过CH和CC键的断裂和形成。

对于线性烷烃，形成Cn+1产物的选择性通常高于Cn+2产物，这与提出的机制相符合。形成2,3-二甲基丁烷（2,3-DMB）与乙烷以及2-甲基丁烷与丙烷的选择性比率接近，表明平衡的反应途径。

2-甲基丙烯的裂合通常被认为是使用经典烯烃裂合催化剂的退化过程。然而，研究表明，铝基氧化物支持的钨氢化物催化剂能够使2-甲基丙烯自我裂合为2,3-二甲基丁烯，这是其主要产品。

该机制的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。烯烃通过烯烃裂合反应形成，而金属环丁烷源自与[1,2]或[1,3]-位置的取代基的相互作用，影响中间体的稳定性和形成。这些因素对反应选择性和催化剂性能在各种烷烃转换中的贡献至关重要。

生成的钨烷基团可以通过氢气（H2）进一步裂解，释放出如乙烷、2-甲基丁烷、2,3-DMB和2,4-二甲基戊烷等产物。这一步骤对于从催化剂中释放所需产物至关重要。
