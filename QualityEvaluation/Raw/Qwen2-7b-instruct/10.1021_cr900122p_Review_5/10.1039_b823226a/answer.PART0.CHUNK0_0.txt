[1] "The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues remains a great challenge in chemistry, in particular for branched alkanes in view of fuel needs."
[2] "Using a single site approach, we reported in 1997 the discovery of a new reaction, the alkane metathesis where a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(RSiO)2TaH] 1a,could catalytically transform at moderate temperatures any light alkane into its lower and higher homologues."
[3] "This reaction consists mainly in the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds (Scheme 1)."
[4] "Interestingly, 2,3-dimethylbutene has the same carbon skeleton as the major product formed during the metathesis of 2-methylpropane i.e. 2,3-DMB."
[5] "The alkyl groups could also be displaced via s-bond metathesis, by the incoming 2-methylpropane present in excess."

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the transfer of a single carbon from one alkane chain to another through the cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds. This process primarily occurs at moderate temperatures and can transform any light alkane into its lower and higher homologues. The catalyst, [(RSiO)2TaH] 1a, is highly electrophilic and supported on silica. Key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the displacement of alkyl groups via s-bond metathesis and the formation of key intermediates. Additionally, branched alkanes, like 2-methylpropane, can be transformed into higher homologues, such as 2,3-dimethylbutane, through the transfer of two carbons, which is unexpected in conventional alkane metathesis mechanisms.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下烷烃裂合的全面机制，讨论双位点和单位点方案，线性和环状烷烃转换过程，关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和作用，以及这些因素如何促进各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能。

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化下的全面烷烃裂合机制涉及通过断裂和形成CH和CC键从一个烷烃链向另一个转移单个碳。该过程主要在温和温度下进行，并能将任何轻质烷烃转化为其更低和更高同系物。催化剂[(RSiO)2TaH] 1a高度亲电并支持在二氧化硅上。关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能受因素影响，如通过s键裂合移除烷基团和形成关键中间体。此外，像2-甲基丙烷这样的支链烷烃可以通过转移两个碳原子转化为更高同系物，这在传统的烷烃裂合机制中是出乎意料的。
