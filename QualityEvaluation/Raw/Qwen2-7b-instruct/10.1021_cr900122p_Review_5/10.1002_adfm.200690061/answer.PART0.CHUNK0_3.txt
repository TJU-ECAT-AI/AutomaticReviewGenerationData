The bilayer organic-inorganic nanodielectric structure, comprised of a hydrogen-terminated zirconium oxide (HfO2) film created through atomic layer deposition and a thin epoxy layer produced by spin-casting, serves as a key component in the development of low-voltage, hysteresis-free, flexible thin-film-type electronic systems described by Rogers and colleagues. This system utilizes networks of single-walled carbon nanotubes. The architecture of the bilayer dielectric is depicted schematically in the document.
