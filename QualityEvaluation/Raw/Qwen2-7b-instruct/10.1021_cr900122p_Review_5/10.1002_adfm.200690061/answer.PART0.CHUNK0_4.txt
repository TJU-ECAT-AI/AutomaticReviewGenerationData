Flexible transistors are enabled by high-capacitance bilayer nanodielectrics composed of atomic-layer-deposited HfO2 and spin-cast ultrathin epoxy integrated with networks of single-walled carbon nanotubes. These transistors operate effectively on both rigid silicon and flexible plastic substrates, achieving low voltage, hysteresis-free, and high performance characteristics.
