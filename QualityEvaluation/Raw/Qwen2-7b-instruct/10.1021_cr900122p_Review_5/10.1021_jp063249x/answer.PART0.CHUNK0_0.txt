[1] "The mechanism of the MeerweinPonndorfVerley (MPV) reduction of cyclohexanone with 2-butanol catalyzed by Snbeta and Zrbeta zeolites has been theoretically investigated using density functional theory (DFT) and the cluster approach."
[2] "The computational study indicates that the mechanism of Snbeta and Zrbeta catalysis is similar, and involves the following steps: adsorption of both the ketone and the alcohol on the Lewis acid center, deprotonation of the alcohol, carbon-to-carbon hydride transfer, proton transfer from the catalyst, and products exchange."
[3] "The nature of the active sites in Snbeta has been experimentally and theoretically investigated, and it has been found that the activity of this catalyst for the BaeyerVilliger oxidation of ketones with H2O2 is related to the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated framework tin atoms having one SnOSi bond."
[4] "In the second pathway found, the initial complex is again A2, but during the reaction the Ha proton of the 2-butanol molecule is directly transferred not to the carbonyl Oa, but to the Oc atom of the SnOH group, giving as a result structure D2."
[5] "Comparison of the energy profiles depicted in Figure 4 shows that the energy barrier for the rate-determining step is similar on both catalysts, suggesting that Zrbeta could also be a good catalyst for the MPV reaction."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two main schemes: the two-site and the one-site. In the two-site scheme, the catalyst facilitates the exchange of alkene fragments between two different alkane molecules, leading to the formation of new alkane and alkene products. In contrast, the one-site scheme involves a single catalyst site undergoing a series of steps including alkyne insertion, olefin rearrangement, and alkyne elimination to produce new alkane products. Key intermediates in these processes include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in determining the reaction's selectivity and efficiency. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the catalyst's surface area, the type of support material, and the specific reaction conditions. The two-site and one-site schemes offer distinct pathways for alkane metathesis, contributing to the diversity of products and the optimization of catalyst performance for different applications.

催化作用下由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物引发的烷烃交联机制涉及两种主要方案：双位点和单位点。在双位点方案中，催化剂促进两个不同烷烃分子之间的烯烃片段交换，产生新的烷烃和烯烃产物。相反，在单位点方案中，单一催化剂位点经历一系列步骤，包括炔插入、烯烃重排和炔消除，以产生新的烷烃产物。这些过程中的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们在决定反应选择性和效率方面起着关键作用。催化剂在不同烷烃转化中的选择性和性能受催化剂表面积、支撑材料类型以及特定反应条件等因素的影响。双位点和单位点方案为烷烃交联提供了不同的途径，有助于产品多样性的实现和催化剂性能的优化，以适应不同应用需求。
