[3] "The computational study indicates that the mechanism of Snbeta and Zrbeta catalysis is similar, and involves the following steps: adsorption of both the ketone and the alcohol on the Lewis acid center, deprotonation of the alcohol, carbon-to-carbon hydride transfer, proton transfer from the catalyst, and products exchange."
[4] "As in the aluminum alkoxide catalyzed reaction, the hydride shift occurs through a six-membered transition state, and the role of the hydrolyzed and therefore more flexible MOH bond is just to facilitate the initial deprotonation of the alcohol."

The mechanism of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of cyclohexanone with 2-butanol catalyzed by Sn-beta and Zr-beta zeolites has been thoroughly analyzed using density functional theory (DFT) and cluster approach. The experimental catalytic study revealed that the active sites in the MPV reaction catalyzed by Sn-beta are identical to the partially hydrolyzed SnOH groups that are active for the Baeyer-Villiger (BV) reaction. The computational investigation demonstrates that the mechanisms of Sn-beta and Zr-beta catalysts are analogous, involving the adsorption of both the ketone and alcohol onto the Lewis acid center, deprotonation of the alcohol, carbon-to-carbon hydride transfer, proton transfer from the catalyst, and products exchange. The hydride shift takes place through a six-membered transition state, and the hydrolyzed MOH bond facilitates the initial deprotonation of the alcohol. For the Zr-beta catalyzed reaction, the only pathways leading to changes in the oxidation states of carbon atoms start from either structure A1 or A2. In the first step, A1Zr transforms into the deprotonated species D1Zr via the transition state TS1Zr with an activation energy of 4.0 kcal/mol. The less basic character of the Oc atom bonded to Zr is evident, as in TS1 the transferring Ha atom is closer to Oc than Ob, whereas in TS1Zr, the ObHa distance is shorter than the HaOc distance.

对甲基环己酮与2-丁醇在Sn-β和Zr-β沸石催化剂上的Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley（MPV）还原反应的机制进行了深入分析，使用密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇方法。实验催化研究表明，由Sn-β催化进行的MPV反应中的活性位点与Baeyer-Villiger（BV）反应中活跃的SnOH部分水合位点相同。计算研究显示，Sn-β和Zr-β催化剂的机制类似，包括酮和醇吸附到酸性中心、醇的去质子化、碳-碳氢转移、催化剂提供的质子转移以及产物交换等步骤。在铝烷氧基催化反应中观察到的六元过渡态中的氢转移同样发生在该反应中，而更灵活的MOH键的作用仅在于促进醇的初始去质子化。对于Zr-β催化的反应，能够导致碳原子氧化状态改变的唯一途径是从结构A1或A2开始。第一步，A1Zr转化为脱质子物种D1Zr通过过渡态TS1Zr，其活化能为4.0 kcal/mol。Oc原子与Zr结合的较弱基本性质在TS1中表现出来，在TS1中，转送的Ha原子靠近Oc而不是Ob；而在TS1Zr中，ObHa距离短于HaOc距离。
