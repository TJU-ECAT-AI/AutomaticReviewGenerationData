          [1] "The mechanism of the MeerweinPonndorfVerley (MPV) reduction of cyclohexanone with 2-butanol catalyzed by Snbeta and Zrbeta zeolites has been theoretically investigated using density functional theory (DFT) and the cluster approach."
          [2] "The computational study indicates that the mechanism of Snbeta and Zrbeta catalysis is similar, and involves the following steps: adsorption of both the ketone and the alcohol on the Lewis acid center, deprotonation of the alcohol, carbon-to-carbon hydride transfer, proton transfer from the catalyst, and products exchange."
          [3] "As in the aluminum alkoxide catalyzed reaction, the hydride shift occurs through a six-membered transition state, and the role of the hydrolyzed and therefore more flexible MOH bond is just to facilitate the initial deprotonation of the alcohol."
          [4] "Comparison of the initial rates measured for the BaeyerVilliger oxidation of adamantanone with H2O2 and the MPV reduction of cyclohexanone with 2-butanol for a series of samples of Snbeta catalysts subjected to different postsynthesis treatments shows that the active sites in the BV and MPV reactions are the same, i.e, the partially hydrolyzed framework SnOH sites."
          [5] "The mechanism for the Zrbeta catalyzed reaction is equivalent to that found for Snbeta and involves the same initial and intermediate species."

          The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. For linear alkane transformations, the process typically starts with the adsorption of the alkane onto the catalyst surface. Following this, deprotonation of the alkane takes place, leading to the formation of an alkene as a key intermediate. This alkene then undergoes a hydride transfer reaction, facilitated by the tantalum hydride species, to yield another alkene or alkane product. The role of the hydrolyzed SnOH or ZrOH groups in the catalytic cycle is to provide a Lewis acidic site for the adsorption and activation of the alkane, and to allow for the deprotonation step. The catalyst performance and selectivity in alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the specific catalyst preparation, the type of alkane substrate, and the reaction conditions. The one-site and two-site schemes refer to the ability of the catalyst to act on either a single site or multiple sites simultaneously, affecting the efficiency and product distribution of the metathesis reaction.

          催化硅负载钽氢化物进行烷烃互变异构的全面机制涉及双位点和单位点方案。对于线性烷烃转化，过程通常从烷烃吸附到催化剂表面开始。随后，通过形成关键中间体烯烃实现烷基的脱质子化。该烯烃随后经历由钽氢化物种促进的氢转移反应，产生另一个烯烃或烷烃产物。水解SnOH或ZrOH组分在催化循环中的作用是提供一个Lewis酸性位点用于烷烃的吸附和活化，并允许脱质子步骤的发生。催化剂性能和烷烃转化的选择性受特定催化剂制备、烷烃底物类型以及反应条件等因素的影响。单位点和双位点方案指的是催化剂是否能够同时作用于一个位点或多个位点，这影响了代谢反应的效率和产物分布。
