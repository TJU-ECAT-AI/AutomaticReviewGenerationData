[1] "The mechanism of the MeerweinPonndorfVerley (MPV) reduction of cyclohexanone with 2-butanol catalyzed by Snbeta and Zrbeta zeolites has been theoretically investigated using density functional theory (DFT) and the cluster approach."
[2] "The computational study indicates that the mechanism of Snbeta and Zrbeta catalysis is similar, and involves the following steps: adsorption of both the ketone and the alcohol on the Lewis acid center, deprotonation of the alcohol, carbon-to-carbon hydride transfer, proton transfer from the catalyst, and products exchange."
[3] "The nature of the active sites in Snbeta has been experimentally and theoretically investigated, and it has been found that the activity of this catalyst for the BaeyerVilliger oxidation of ketones with H2O2 is related to the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated framework tin atoms having one SnOSi bond."
[4] "In the second pathway found, the initial complex is again A2, but during the reaction the Ha proton of the 2-butanol molecule is directly transferred not to the carbonyl Oa, but to the Oc atom of the SnOH group, giving as a result structure D2."
[5] "Comparison of the energy profiles depicted in Figure 4 shows that the energy barrier for the rate-determining step is similar on both catalysts, suggesting that Zrbeta could also be a good catalyst for the MPV reaction."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two main schemes: the two-site and the one-site. In the two-site scheme, the catalyst facilitates the exchange of alkene fragments between two different alkane molecules, leading to the formation of new alkane and alkene products. In contrast, the one-site scheme involves a single catalyst site undergoing a series of steps including alkyne insertion, olefin rearrangement, and alkyne elimination to produce new alkane products. Key intermediates in these processes include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in determining the reaction's selectivity and efficiency. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the catalyst's surface area, the type of support material, and the specific reaction conditions. The two-site and one-site schemes offer distinct pathways for alkane metathesis, contributing to the diversity of products and the optimization of catalyst performance for different applications.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, linear and cyclic alkane transformations occur via the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These intermediates play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The processes involved include the deprotonation of the alcohol, followed by a hydride shift through a six-membered transition state, and finally, the transfer of a proton from the catalyst to form the desired products. The hydrolyzed SnOH group facilitates the initial deprotonation of the alcohol, acting as a hydrogen bond donor in the MPV reaction, unlike its role in the Baeyer-Villiger reaction where it binds the alcohol molecule.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. For linear alkane transformations, the process typically starts with the adsorption of the alkane onto the catalyst surface. Following this, deprotonation of the alkane takes place, leading to the formation of an alkene as a key intermediate. This alkene then undergoes a hydride transfer reaction, facilitated by the tantalum hydride species, to yield another alkene or alkane product. The role of the hydrolyzed SnOH or ZrOH groups in the catalytic cycle is to provide a Lewis acidic site for the adsorption and activation of the alkane, and to allow for the deprotonation step. The catalyst performance and selectivity in alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the specific catalyst preparation, the type of alkane substrate, and the reaction conditions. The one-site and two-site schemes refer to the ability of the catalyst to act on either a single site or multiple sites simultaneously, affecting the efficiency and product distribution of the metathesis reaction.

In the case of cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism follows a similar pattern but may involve additional steps to accommodate the ring structure of the alkane. The formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate might be a crucial step in the conversion of certain cyclic alkanes to linear alkanes. The catalyst's ability to efficiently convert cyclic to linear alkanes can depend on the precise conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the presence of co-catalysts or additives.

The role of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, is pivotal in determining the overall reaction pathway and the selectivity of the alkane metathesis. These intermediates can affect the catalyst's activity and lifetime, influencing the yield and purity of the final products. The formation of these intermediates is closely tied to the catalytic activity of the tantalum hydride species, which must balance the need for strong activation of the alkane with the efficient generation and control of reactive intermediates.

Catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is optimized through careful control of parameters such as the catalyst loading, the nature of the support material, and the reaction conditions. Theoretical investigations using computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), help in understanding the detailed mechanisms and in predicting the behavior of the catalyst under different operating conditions. Experimental studies, including catalytic activity tests, are also essential for validating theoretical predictions and for refining catalyst design and synthesis strategies.

催化硅负载钽氢化物进行烷烃互变异构的全面机制涉及双位点和单位点方案。对于线性烷烃转化，过程通常从烷烃吸附到催化剂表面开始。随后，通过形成关键中间体烯烃实现烷基的脱质子化。该烯烃随后经历由钽氢化物种促进的氢转移反应，产生另一个烯烃或烷烃产物。水解SnOH或ZrOH组分在催化循环中的作用是提供一个Lewis酸性位点用于烷烃的吸附和活化，并允许脱质子步骤的发生。催化剂性能和烷烃转化的选择性受特定催化剂制备、烷烃底物类型以及反应条件等因素的影响。单位点和双位点方案指的是催化剂是否能够同时作用于一个位点或多个位点，这影响了代谢反应的效率和产物分布。

对于环烷烃转化，机制遵循类似的模式，但可能需要额外步骤来适应烷烃的环结构。环烷烃到线性烷烃的转化过程中，可能形成金属环丁烷中间体作为关键步骤。催化剂有效转化环烷烃为线性烷烃的能力取决于精确的条件，包括温度、压力以及共催化剂或添加剂的存在。

关键中间体，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，在确定总体反应途径和烷烃互变异构选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。这些中间体可以影响催化剂活性和寿命，从而影响最终产品的产率和纯度。这些中间体的形成与钽氢化物种的催化活性紧密相关，必须平衡强烷基活化的需求与有效生成和控制反应中间体的能力。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能通过仔细控制参数如催化剂负载、支持材料性质以及反应条件来优化。计算方法，如密度泛函理论（DFT），有助于理解详细机制并预测在不同操作条件下催化剂的行为。实验研究，包括催化活性测试，对于验证理论预测和改进催化剂设计和合成策略也至关重要。

The mechanism of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of cyclohexanone with 2-butanol catalyzed by Sn-beta and Zr-beta zeolites has been thoroughly analyzed using density functional theory (DFT) and cluster approach. The experimental catalytic study revealed that the active sites in the MPV reaction catalyzed by Sn-beta are identical to the partially hydrolyzed SnOH groups that are active for the Baeyer-Villiger (BV) reaction. The computational investigation demonstrates that the mechanisms of Sn-beta and Zr-beta catalysts are analogous, involving the adsorption of both the ketone and alcohol onto the Lewis acid center, deprotonation of the alcohol, carbon-to-carbon hydride transfer, proton transfer from the catalyst, and products exchange. The hydride shift takes place through a six-membered transition state, and the hydrolyzed MOH bond facilitates the initial deprotonation of the alcohol. For the Zr-beta catalyzed reaction, the only pathways leading to changes in the oxidation states of carbon atoms start from either structure A1 or A2. In the first step, A1Zr transforms into the deprotonated species D1Zr via the transition state TS1Zr with an activation energy of 4.0 kcal/mol. The less basic character of the Oc atom bonded to Zr is evident, as in TS1 the transferring Ha atom is closer to Oc than Ob, whereas in TS1Zr, the ObHa distance is shorter than the HaOc distance.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, focusing on both two-site and one-site schemes, involves multiple stages. Key aspects include the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes into alkenes, the formation of metallacyclobutanes, and the role of key intermediates such as alkenes. Selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors including the nature of the active sites, the processes involved, and the formation of key intermediates.

For silica-supported tantalum hydrides, the two-site and one-site schemes refer to the ability of the catalyst to facilitate alkane metathesis through interactions with two distinct alkane molecules or a single alkane molecule, respectively. The processes involved typically include the breaking and reforming of alkene bonds, leading to the conversion of linear alkanes into cyclic alkanes or vice versa. The formation of key intermediates like alkenes plays a crucial role in the overall reaction mechanism, contributing to the selectivity of the conversion.

Metallacyclobutanes, formed during the reaction, serve as a significant intermediate in the catalytic cycle, particularly in the context of cyclic alkane transformations. These metallacyclobutanes undergo rearrangements and subsequent cleavage to regenerate the catalyst and produce the desired alkane products. The stability and reactivity of these intermediates, along with the efficiency of the catalytic sites, determine the overall performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions.

Selectivity in alkane conversions using silica-supported tantalum hydrides is influenced by the balance between competing reaction pathways, the nature of the active sites, and the ability of the catalyst to efficiently facilitate the desired alkene bond rearrangements. Catalyst performance is optimized by tuning parameters such as the support material, the nature of the metal hydride, and the operating conditions to achieve high yields of specific alkane products with minimal side reactions.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex interplay of multiple steps, including the formation of key intermediates, the role of metallacyclobutanes, and the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
