[1] "The mechanism of the MeerweinPonndorfVerley (MPV) reduction of cyclohexanone with 2-butanol catalyzed by Snbeta and Zrbeta zeolites has been theoretically investigated using density functional theory (DFT) and the cluster approach."
[2] "An experimental catalytic study has shown that the active sites in the MPV reaction catalyzed by Snbeta are the same partially hydrolyzed SnOH groups that were found to be active for the BaeyerVilliger (BV) reaction."
[3] "The computational study indicates that the mechanism of Snbeta and Zrbeta catalysis is similar, and involves the following steps: adsorption of both the ketone and the alcohol on the Lewis acid center, deprotonation of the alcohol, carbon-to-carbon hydride transfer, proton transfer from the catalyst, and products exchange."
[4] "As in the aluminum alkoxide catalyzed reaction, the hydride shift occurs through a six-membered transition state, and the role of the hydrolyzed and therefore more flexible MOH bond is just to facilitate the initial deprotonation of the alcohol."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, linear and cyclic alkane transformations occur via the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These intermediates play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The processes involved include the deprotonation of the alcohol, followed by a hydride shift through a six-membered transition state, and finally, the transfer of a proton from the catalyst to form the desired products. The hydrolyzed SnOH group facilitates the initial deprotonation of the alcohol, acting as a hydrogen bond donor in the MPV reaction, unlike its role in the Baeyer-Villiger reaction where it binds the alcohol molecule.

催化由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的烷烃均裂机制涉及两种站点和单一站点方案。在双站点方案中，线性和环状烷烃通过形成关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷发生转换。这些中间体在决定反应选择性和催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。涉及的过程包括醇的去质子化，随后是通过六元过渡状态的氢化物转移，最后，从催化剂转移一个质子以形成所需产物。水解的SnOH基团促进醇的初始去质子化，作为MPV反应中的氢键供体，与Baeyer-Villiger反应中其与醇分子结合的作用不同，在那里它作为氢键受体。
