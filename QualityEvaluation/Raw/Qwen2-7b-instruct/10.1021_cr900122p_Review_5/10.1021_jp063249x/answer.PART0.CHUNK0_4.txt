[1] "The mechanism of the MeerweinPonndorfVerley (MPV) reduction of cyclohexanone with 2-butanol catalyzed by Snbeta and Zrbeta zeolites has been theoretically investigated using density functional theory (DFT) and the cluster approach."
[2] "An experimental catalytic study has shown that the active sites in the MPV reaction catalyzed by Snbeta are the same partially hydrolyzed SnOH groups that were found to be active for the BaeyerVilliger (BV) reaction."
[3] "The computational study indicates that the mechanism of Snbeta and Zrbeta catalysis is similar, and involves the following steps: adsorption of both the ketone and the alcohol on the Lewis acid center, deprotonation of the alcohol, carbon-to-carbon hydride transfer, proton transfer from the catalyst, and products exchange."
[4] "As in the aluminum alkoxide catalyzed reaction, the hydride shift occurs through a six-membered transition state, and the role of the hydrolyzed and therefore more flexible MOH bond is just to facilitate the initial deprotonation of the alcohol."
[5] "The detailed computational study of the potential energy surface of the Snbeta catalyzed MPV reaction of cyclohexanone with 2-butanol indicates that the only reaction pathways that finally lead to a change in the oxidation states of Ca and Cb carbon atoms start either from A1 or from A2, and that the deprotonated species D2 is not involved in any of these mechanisms."
[6] "However, it was not possible to find a minima corresponding to structure A2Zr. The reason is the different natures of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in Snbeta and of that in Zrbeta, depicted in Figure 5."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, focusing on both two-site and one-site schemes, involves multiple stages. Key aspects include the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes into alkenes, the formation of metallacyclobutanes, and the role of key intermediates such as alkenes. Selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors including the nature of the active sites, the processes involved, and the formation of key intermediates.

For silica-supported tantalum hydrides, the two-site and one-site schemes refer to the ability of the catalyst to facilitate alkane metathesis through interactions with two distinct alkane molecules or a single alkane molecule, respectively. The processes involved typically include the breaking and reforming of alkene bonds, leading to the conversion of linear alkanes into cyclic alkanes or vice versa. The formation of key intermediates like alkenes plays a crucial role in the overall reaction mechanism, contributing to the selectivity of the conversion.

Metallacyclobutanes, formed during the reaction, serve as a significant intermediate in the catalytic cycle, particularly in the context of cyclic alkane transformations. These metallacyclobutanes undergo rearrangements and subsequent cleavage to regenerate the catalyst and produce the desired alkane products. The stability and reactivity of these intermediates, along with the efficiency of the catalytic sites, determine the overall performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions.

Selectivity in alkane conversions using silica-supported tantalum hydrides is influenced by the balance between competing reaction pathways, the nature of the active sites, and the ability of the catalyst to efficiently facilitate the desired alkene bond rearrangements. Catalyst performance is optimized by tuning parameters such as the support material, the nature of the metal hydride, and the operating conditions to achieve high yields of specific alkane products with minimal side reactions.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex interplay of multiple steps, including the formation of key intermediates, the role of metallacyclobutanes, and the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.
