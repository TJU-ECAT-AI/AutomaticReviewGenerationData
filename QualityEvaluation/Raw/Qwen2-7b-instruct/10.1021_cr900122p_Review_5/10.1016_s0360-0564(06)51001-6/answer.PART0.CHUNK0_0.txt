[1] "In this context, time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy (with con- stant temperature and pressure during the experiment) and also temperature-time resolved (with both temperature and time changing simultaneously in a controlled way during the experiment) can be useful for kinetic investigations of several types of reactions."
[2] "All these reactions are discussed in the framework of a few common potential energy profiles in which the evolution from the precursor through the intermediate species to the final products is governed by the relative height of the corresponding activation energy barriers."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the kinetic processes that occur under controlled temperature and pressure conditions. The evolution of the reaction from precursor species to final products follows potential energy profiles where the height of activation energy barriers dictates the pathway of transformation. This mechanism encompasses both two-site and one-site schemes, detailing the conversion of linear and cyclic alkanes through the formation and role of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes.
