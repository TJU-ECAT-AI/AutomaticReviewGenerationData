[1] "In this context, time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy (with constant temperature and pressure during the experiment) and also temperature-time resolved (with both temperature and time changing simultaneously in a controlled way during the experiment) can be useful for kinetic investigations of several types of reactions."
[2] "These are classified in four main categories: (i) adsorption processes and transformations in the adsorbed state; (ii) proton-catalyzed oligomerization and polymerization of alkenes and unsaturated molecules in protonic zeolites; (iii) oligomerization reactions catalyzed by basic surface sites, and (iv) oligomerization and polymerization of alkenes on catalysts incorporating supported transition metal ions."

The literature discusses the use of time-resolved Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for kinetic investigations of various types of reactions, including adsorption processes, proton-catalyzed oligomerization and polymerization of alkenes and unsaturated molecules in protonic zeolites, oligomerization reactions catalyzed by basic surface sites, and oligomerization and polymerization of alkenes on catalysts incorporating supported transition metal ions.
