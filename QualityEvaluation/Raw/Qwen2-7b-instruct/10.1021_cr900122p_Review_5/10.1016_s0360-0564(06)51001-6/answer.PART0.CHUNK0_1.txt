[1] "In this context, time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy (with constant temperature and pressure during the experiment) and also temperature-time resolved (with both temperature and time changing simultaneously in a controlled way during the experiment) can be useful for kinetic investigations of several types of reactions."
[2] "These are classified in four main categories: (i) adsorption processes and transformations in the adsorbed state; (ii) proton-catalyzed oligomerization and polymerization of alkenes and unsaturated molecules in protonic zeolites; (iii) oligomerization reactions catalyzed by basic surface sites, and (iv) oligomerization and polymerization of alkenes on catalysts incorporating supported transition metal ions."

The literature discusses the use of time-resolved Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for kinetic investigations of various reactions. It highlights four main categories of reactions that can benefit from this technique: adsorption processes, proton-catalyzed oligomerization and polymerization of alkenes and unsaturated molecules in protonic zeolites, oligomerization reactions catalyzed by basic surface sites, and oligomerization and polymerization of alkenes on catalysts incorporating supported transition metal ions.

文献讨论了时间分辨傅里叶变换红外（FTIR）光谱法在各种反应动力学研究中的应用。它强调了四个主要反应类别可以从这种技术中受益：吸附过程、质子催化烯烃和不饱和分子在质子型沸石中的同聚化和聚合、由碱性表面位点催化的同聚化反应，以及包含支持过渡金属离子的催化剂上的烯烃同聚化和聚合。
