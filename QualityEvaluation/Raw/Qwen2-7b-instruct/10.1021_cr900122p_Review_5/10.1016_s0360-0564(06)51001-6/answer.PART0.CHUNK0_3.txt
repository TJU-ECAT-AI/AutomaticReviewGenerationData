[1] "In this context, time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy (with con- stant temperature and pressure during the experiment) and also temperature-time resolved (with both temperature and time changing simultaneously in a controlled way during the experiment) can be useful for kinetic investigations of several types of reactions."
[2] "These are classified in four main categories: (i) adsorption processes and transformations in the adsorbed state; (ii) proton-catalyzed oligomerization and polymerization of alkenes and unsaturated molecules in protonic zeolites; (iii) oligomerization reactions catalyzed by basic surface sites, and (iv) oligomerization and polymerization of alkenes on catalysts incorporating supported transition metal ions."
