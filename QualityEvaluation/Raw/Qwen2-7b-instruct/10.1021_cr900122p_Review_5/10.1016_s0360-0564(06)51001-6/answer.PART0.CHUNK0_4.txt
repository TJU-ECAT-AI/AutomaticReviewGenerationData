[1] "In this context, time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy (with constant temperature and pressure during the experiment) and also temperature-time resolved (with both temperature and time changing simultaneously in a controlled way during the experiment) can be useful for kinetic investigations of several types of reactions."
[2] "These are classified in four main categories: (i) adsorption processes and transformations in the adsorbed state; (ii) proton-catalyzed oligomerization and polymerization of alkenes and unsaturated molecules in protonic zeolites; (iii) oligomerization reactions catalyzed by basic surface sites, and (iv) oligomerization and polymerization of alkenes on catalysts incorporating supported transition metal ions."

The literature discusses the use of time-resolved Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) for kinetic investigations of various reactions. It categorizes the types of reactions into four main groups: adsorption processes, proton-catalyzed oligomerization and polymerization of alkenes and unsaturated molecules, oligomerization reactions catalyzed by basic surface sites, and oligomerization and polymerization of alkenes on catalysts containing supported transition metal ions.

文献讨论了时间分辨傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）在各种反应动力学研究中的应用。它将反应类型分为四大类：吸附过程、质子催化烯烃和不饱和分子的同聚化和聚合、由碱性表面位点催化的同聚化反应，以及含负载过渡金属离子催化剂上的烯烃同聚化和聚合。
