Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides reveals that both two-site and one-site schemes are involved. Linear and cyclic alkane transformations are enabled by the formation of key intermediates including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These intermediates are pivotal in the reaction pathways, influencing the selectivity and efficiency of the catalyst in alkane conversions.
