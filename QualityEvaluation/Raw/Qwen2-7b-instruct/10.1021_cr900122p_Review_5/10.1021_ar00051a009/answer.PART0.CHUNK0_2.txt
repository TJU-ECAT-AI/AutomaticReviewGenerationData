[1] "Metal-Alkyl 0-Bond Metathesis. A second important class of C-H activation reactions involves addition of C-H bonds across M-X bonds, rather than to the metal atom itself (eqs 2 and 3).30-35 These reactions lead to products in which only one of the alkyl or hydrogen fragments is directly attached to the metal after the activation process."
[2] "Metal-Alkyl 0-Bond Metathesis. Early transition, lanthanide, and actinide metal alkyl and hydride complexes capable of activating C-H bonds as shown in eq 2 have been actively studied for the past 20 years.30 Initial investigations were prompted by Erk-ers discovery of a zirconium benzyne complex capable of activating arene C-H bonds.36"

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. In two-site schemes, linear alkane transformations occur through the formation of an alkene intermediate that subsequently reacts with another alkane to form a new alkane product. Cyclic alkane transformations, on the other hand, involve the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which then undergoes rearrangement to form a new cyclic alkane product. Key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The role of these intermediates contributes to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. For instance, the formation of alkenes allows for the transfer of alkyl groups between different alkane molecules, while the formation of metallacyclobutanes enables the rearrangement of cyclic structures, leading to the production of new cyclic alkane products. The selectivity of these transformations is influenced by factors such as the stability of the intermediates, the nature of the catalyst, and the specific alkane molecules involved.

分析由硅负载钽氢化物催化的大烷基交换的全面机制涉及理解两种站点和单站点方案。在两个站点方案中，线性烷基转换通过形成一个烯烃中间体发生，该中间体随后与另一个烷基反应形成新的烷基产品。在环烷基转换中，通过形成一种称为金属环丁烷的中间体来实现，然后进行重组以形成新的环烷基产品。关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。这些中间体的作用有助于各种烷基转换的反应选择性和催化剂性能。例如，烯烃的形成允许不同烷基分子之间转移烷基组，而形成金属环丁烷则允许环结构的重组，从而产生新的环烷基产品。这些转换的选择性受中间体稳定性、催化剂的性质以及具体参与的烷基分子等因素的影响。
