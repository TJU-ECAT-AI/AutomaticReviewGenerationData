The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In these reactions, linear and cyclic alkane transformations occur through the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These intermediates play crucial roles in the selective conversion of various alkane compounds due to the unique properties of the catalyst.
