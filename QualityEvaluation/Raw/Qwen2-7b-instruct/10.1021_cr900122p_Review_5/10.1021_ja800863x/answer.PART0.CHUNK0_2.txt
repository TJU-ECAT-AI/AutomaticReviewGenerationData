Answer: The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides is discussed in detail in the article. It involves both two-site and one-site schemes, where linear and cyclic alkane transformations occur through the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. These factors significantly contribute to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.
