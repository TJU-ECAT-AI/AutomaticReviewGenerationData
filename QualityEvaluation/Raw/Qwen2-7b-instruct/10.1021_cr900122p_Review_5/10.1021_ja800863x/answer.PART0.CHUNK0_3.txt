The non-oxidative coupling reaction of methane to ethane and hydrogen is catalyzed by a silica-supported tantalum hydride. This process involves several steps that start with the activation of methane, followed by its coupling with either ethane or hydrogen. Key intermediates in this process are alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The catalyst, (SiO)2TaH, is essential for the reaction's efficiency. This method enables the conversion of methane into ethane and hydrogen.
