1. Titanium silicalite (TS-1) facilitates the oxidation of unactivated alkanes with hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions, resulting in the formation of alcohols and ketones.
2. The rate of reaction is influenced by the solvent used.
3. The detailed structure and overall reactivity of titanium silicalite have been extensively documented in previous literature.
4. To perform the oxidation reaction, a reducing agent is often required alongside the hydrogen peroxide.
5. Alkanes oxidized by the TS-1 catalyst in the presence of hydrogen peroxide exhibit a higher ratio of ketone to alcohol products as the alkane conversion increases.
6. TS-1 is less effective as a catalyst due to its reduced titanium content compared to other catalysts.
7. The rate of the reaction is enhanced when the alkane being oxidized is converted to a higher degree.

1. 钛硅沸石（TS-1）在温和条件下催化未活化的烷烃与过氧化氢的氧化反应，生成醇和酮。
2. 反应速率受到所使用的溶剂的影响。
3. 钛硅沸石的结构和整体反应性已经在先前的文献中进行了详细的描述。
4. 在氧化反应中，除了过氧化氢之外，通常还需要还原剂。
5. 当烷烃被TS-1催化剂在过氧化氢的存在下氧化时，随着烷烃转化度的增加，酮类产物与醇类产物的比例会提高。
6. TS-1作为催化剂的效率较低，主要是由于其钛含量较低。
7. 随着烷烃转化度的增加，反应速率得到增强。
