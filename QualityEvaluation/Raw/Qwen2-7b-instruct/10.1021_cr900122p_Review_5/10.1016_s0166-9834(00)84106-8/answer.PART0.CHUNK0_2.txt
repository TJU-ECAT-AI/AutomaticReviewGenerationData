The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes, where key processes include linear and cyclic alkane transformations, leading to the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The role of key intermediates is significant, contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The mechanism highlights the importance of the structure of the catalyst and the role of hydrogen abstraction, involving the formation of a titanium hydroperoxo-species, which is likely to have a five-membered ring structure. This species plays a crucial role in the hydrogen abstraction step, affecting the overall reactivity of the catalyst towards alkanes. The dissociation of the titanium hydroperoxo-species leads to the formation of weak acids, which shift the equilibrium towards the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, influencing the selectivity of the reactions.
