[1] "Titanium silicalite (TS-1) catalyses the partial oxidation of unactivated alkanes with hydrogen peroxide, under mild conditions."
[2] "Alcohols and ketones are formed according to reaction ( 1)."
[3] "No C-H bond hydroxylation took place when t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) was used as the oxidant."
[4] "TS-1 and AI-TS-I are very active catalysts."
[5] "TS-1 has very weak acid properties."
[6] "Efforts were made to show possible intermediate radical species in the oxidation of n-hexane (Table 5)."
[7] "Mono-oxyfunctionalization of lower alkanes and remote C-H bond oxidation on 1-chlorohexane and on methyl heptanoate can be interpreted with the assumption that the active species which attacks C-H bonds has also electrophilic properties."
[8] "Electron withdrawing substituents, such as chlorine,hydroxyl, carbonyl,and ester groups decrease electron density on the alkyl chain."
[9] "Polar effects are larger on vicinal CH2 groups and rapidly decrease along the alkyl chain, in good agreement with experimental results."
