The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the process of linear alkane transformations, the alkane molecule is split into two fragments, each fragment then reacts with another alkane molecule to form a new alkane molecule. For cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism typically involves the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which then undergoes rearrangement to form a new alkane. Key intermediates in this process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The formation of these intermediates plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. The catalysts show high activity and specificity, capable of efficiently converting alkanes under mild conditions. The mechanism is consistent with the decrease in diffusivity in zeolites with increasing molecular weight, indicating a shape-selective effect. The active species involved in the hydrogen-abstraction step has electrophilic properties, contributing to the mechanism of alkane metathesis.

The catalysts exhibit weak acid properties, which influence the reaction rates and product distributions. The presence of acids or bases in the reaction medium can shift the equilibrium, affecting the concentration of the electrophilic species. This leads to changes in the reactivity of the system towards alkanes and alkenes, impacting the overall performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions. The study of titanium silicalite catalysis reveals that a titanium hydroperoxo-species is formed by the reaction of TS-1 with hydrogen peroxide, suggesting a five-membered ring structure for the active species. However, the exact nature of the active species involved in the hydrogen-abstraction step remains an area of ongoing research.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation and rearrangement of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, influenced by the electrophilic properties of the active species. The shape-selective effect and weak acid properties of the catalysts play critical roles in determining the selectivity and performance in various alkane conversions. Further research is needed to clarify the nature of the active species involved in the hydrogen-abstraction step.

催化硅酸盐支持的钽氢化物的烷烃裂解全面机制涉及双位点和单位点方案。在线性烷烃转化过程中，烷烃分子被分裂成两个片段，每个片段随后与另一个烷烃分子反应形成新的烷烃分子。对于环烷烃转化，机制通常涉及形成金属环丁烷中间体，然后进行重排形成新的烷烃。此过程中的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷。这些中间体的形成在确定各种烷烃转换的特异性方面起着关键作用。催化剂显示出高活性和特异性，能够在温和条件下高效地转化烷烃。机制与随着分子量增加，沸石中扩散性的降低一致，表明存在形状选择性。参与氢抽象步骤的活性物种具有亲电性质，对烷烃裂解的机制有贡献。

催化剂显示弱酸性质，影响反应速率和产物分布。反应介质中添加酸或碱可以改变平衡，影响活性物种的浓度，从而影响系统对烷烃和烯烃的反应性，影响催化剂的整体性能。硅酸盐催化研究揭示，通过TS-1与过氧化氢反应形成的钛过氧物种表明活性物种可能具有五元环结构。然而，参与氢抽象步骤的活性物种的确切性质仍然是一个持续研究的主题。
