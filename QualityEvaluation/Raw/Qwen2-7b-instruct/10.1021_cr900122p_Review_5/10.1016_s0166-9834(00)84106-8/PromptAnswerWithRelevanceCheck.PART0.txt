The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes, where key processes include linear and cyclic alkane transformations, leading to the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The role of key intermediates is significant, contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The mechanism highlights the importance of the structure of the catalyst and the role of hydrogen abstraction, involving the formation of a titanium hydroperoxo-species, which is likely to have a five-membered ring structure. This species plays a crucial role in the hydrogen abstraction step, affecting the overall reactivity of the catalyst towards alkanes. The dissociation of the titanium hydroperoxo-species leads to the formation of weak acids, which shift the equilibrium towards the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, influencing the selectivity of the reactions.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the process of linear alkane transformations, the alkane molecule is split into two fragments, each fragment then reacts with another alkane molecule to form a new alkane molecule. For cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism typically involves the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which then undergoes rearrangement to form a new alkane. Key intermediates in this process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The formation of these intermediates plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. The catalysts show high activity and specificity, capable of efficiently converting alkanes under mild conditions. The mechanism is consistent with the decrease in diffusivity in zeolites with increasing molecular weight, indicating a shape-selective effect. The active species involved in the hydrogen-abstraction step has electrophilic properties, contributing to the mechanism of alkane metathesis.

The catalysts exhibit weak acid properties, which influence the reaction rates and product distributions. The presence of acids or bases in the reaction medium can shift the equilibrium, affecting the concentration of the electrophilic species. This leads to changes in the reactivity of the system towards alkanes and alkenes, impacting the overall performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions. The study of titanium silicalite catalysis reveals that a titanium hydroperoxo-species is formed by the reaction of TS-1 with hydrogen peroxide, suggesting a five-membered ring structure for the active species. However, the exact nature of the active species involved in the hydrogen-abstraction step remains an area of ongoing research.

In summary, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation and rearrangement of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, influenced by the electrophilic properties of the active species. The shape-selective effect and weak acid properties of the catalysts play critical roles in determining the selectivity and performance in various alkane conversions. Further research is needed to clarify the nature of the active species involved in the hydrogen-abstraction step.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation and transformation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. In the context of this study, titanium silicalite (TS-1) forms a titanium hydroperoxo-species upon reacting with hydrogen peroxide. This species acts as an electrophilic reagent that abstracts a hydrogen atom from alkane C-H bonds, leading to the formation of alcohols. The process involves two-site and one-site schemes, with linear and cyclic alkane transformations occurring through the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, respectively. The role of acids and bases in shifting the equilibrium of the system influences the concentration of the electrophilic species, affecting the overall reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst. Factors contributing to reaction selectivity include the unique properties of the active species, the stability of the intermediates, and the specific conditions under which the reactions take place.
