The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the formation and transformation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. In the context of this study, titanium silicalite (TS-1) forms a titanium hydroperoxo-species upon reacting with hydrogen peroxide. This species acts as an electrophilic reagent that abstracts a hydrogen atom from alkane C-H bonds, leading to the formation of alcohols. The process involves two-site and one-site schemes, with linear and cyclic alkane transformations occurring through the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, respectively. The role of acids and bases in shifting the equilibrium of the system influences the concentration of the electrophilic species, affecting the overall reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst. Factors contributing to reaction selectivity include the unique properties of the active species, the stability of the intermediates, and the specific conditions under which the reactions take place.
