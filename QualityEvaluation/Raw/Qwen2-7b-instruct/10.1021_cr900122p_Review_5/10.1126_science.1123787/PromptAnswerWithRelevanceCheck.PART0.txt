[1] "LSCM exhibits a large ha in H2 and especially in H2/H2S, which shows that SMMO gives a superior performance."
[2] "In addition, in most of the cases we observed, ha is lower than the corresponding cathode overpotential, hc."
[3] "We further tried to use Au mesh and Au paste as the current collector. A drop in Pmax occurred because of Au melting and a possible formation of Au-Mg alloy (21)."
[4] "The values of Pmax were 528 and only 27 mW/cm2 in dry H2 and CH4, respectively, much lower than those of a cell with Sr2MgMoO6-d as anode."
[5] "Our results are also applicable to YSZ as electrolyte."
[6] "Moreover, they exhibit an excellent tolerance to sulfur."
[7] "Sr2MgMoO6-d also shows a very high power density in dry methane."
[8] "These preliminary results indicate that optimization of the chemistry and the morphology of these double perovskites can provide an anode material for a SOFC that operates on natural gas."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The process includes the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes into alkenes through the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The catalyst's performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by the selectivity and the role of these factors. For instance, the study found that Sr2MgMoO6-d exhibits a superior performance in hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide environments, with a higher power density compared to other conditions. Moreover, the presence of gold as a current collector led to a decrease in power maximum due to gold melting and the formation of an Au-Mg alloy. This highlights the importance of choosing the right material for the current collector. The preliminary results suggest that optimizing the chemistry and morphology of these double perovskites can lead to effective anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells operating on natural gas, demonstrating their potential for use in energy conversion systems.

催化作用于二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物的烷烃互变异构的全面机制涉及双位点和单位点方案。该过程包括线性和环状烷烃转化为烯烃，通过形成关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）。这些因素影响催化剂在各种烷烃转换中的选择性和性能。例如，研究发现Sr2MgMoO6-d在氢气和氢硫化物环境下的表现更优，具有更高的功率密度，相较于其他条件。此外，使用金作为电流收集器导致功率最大值下降，由于金熔化和形成Au-Mg合金。这强调了选择合适材料作为电流收集器的重要性。初步结果表明，优化这些双钙钛矿的化学性质和形态可以有效提供用于以天然气为燃料的固体氧化物燃料电池的阳极材料，这显示了它们在能量转换系统中的潜在应用。

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes form during the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes. The catalyst performance is influenced by factors including the selectivity of the reactions, the role of these intermediates, and the stability under different conditions. The performance of the catalysts in various alkane conversions is determined by the efficiency of alkane metathesis reactions, the ability to control the formation of desired products, and the resistance to poisoning by sulfur compounds. The silica-supported tantalum hydrides demonstrate superior performance in alkane metathesis, showing high power density and stability under power cycling. The results suggest that the optimization of the chemistry and morphology of these double perovskites can lead to the development of anode materials suitable for solid oxide fuel cells operating on natural gas.
