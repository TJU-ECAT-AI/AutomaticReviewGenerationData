[1] "LSCM exhibits a large ha in H2 and especially in H2/H2S, which shows that SMMO gives a superior performance."
[2] "In addition, in most of the cases we observed, ha is lower than the corresponding cathode overpotential, hc."
[3] "Because the LDC buffer layer is also an MIEC that is catalytically active for fuel oxidation, a cell with only the LDC layer as anode and with Pt mesh and Pt paste as current collector was tested."
[4] "The values of Pmax were 528 and only 27 mW/cm2 in dry H2 and CH4,respectively, much lower than those of a cell with Sr2MgMoO6-d as anode."
[5] "Furthermore, EDS results for the Sr2MgMoO6-d/LDC/LSGM/ SCF cell after operating in H2, H2/H2S, and CH4 for a total of 10 days showed no Pt in the LDC layer."
[6] "We further tried to use Au mesh and Au paste as the current collector. A drop in Pmax occurred because of Au melting and a possible formation of Au-Mg alloy (21)."
[7] "Our results are also applicable to YSZ as electrolyte. These preliminary results indicate that optimization of the chemistry and the morphology of these double perovskites can provide an anode material for a SOFC that operates on natural gas."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. Key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes form during the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes. The catalyst performance is influenced by factors including the selectivity of the reactions, the role of these intermediates, and the stability under different conditions. The performance of the catalysts in various alkane conversions is determined by the efficiency of alkane metathesis reactions, the ability to control the formation of desired products, and the resistance to poisoning by sulfur compounds. The silica-supported tantalum hydrides demonstrate superior performance in alkane metathesis, showing high power density and stability under power cycling. The results suggest that the optimization of the chemistry and morphology of these double perovskites can lead to the development of anode materials suitable for solid oxide fuel cells operating on natural gas.
