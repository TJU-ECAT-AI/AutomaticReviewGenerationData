The Lewis acid properties of a series of isolated and well-defined Sn centers in different micro- and mesoporous materials have been investigated by means of DFT calculations and IR spectroscopy of probe molecules, and the results have been related to the experimentally measured catalytic activity of these materials for different reactions. Different types of Sn centers have been detected and modelled: inactive fully coordinated Sn atoms in framework positions that weakly interact with Lewis bases, and highly active strong Lewis acid sites associated with Sn centers with one or two hydrolyzed SnOSi bridges. The relative amount of strong and weak sites depends on the zeolite structure, and can be modified by the catalyst pre-treatment conditions. On the other hand, it has been established that Sn-containing mesoporous materials obtained either by direct synthesis or by post-synthesis incorporation of Sn, show a similar distribution of centers. Finally, the influence of solvent and free space available around the active site on the diastereoselectivity of the cyclization of citronellal to isopulegol were investigated, and some hints were obtained on how to improve the catalyst performance.

Introduction The development of isolated and well-defined single-site Lewis acid solid catalysts that are active and selective for new environmentally friendly chemical processes is an urgent need and a challenging scientific target.1,2 A very successful example of such materials is Ti silicalite (TS-1), a catalyst for a series of oxidation reactions whose industrial implementation represented an important breakthrough in the use of Lewis acids as heterogeneous catalysts.36 The active sites of TS-1 and other related titanium-containing materials were characterized by XRD, IR, Raman, UV-Visible, XPS, and EXAFS/XANES spectroscopies. More recently, electrochemical and photo- chemical techniques have also been used to address this issue.711 The results from structural characterization with spectroscopic,electrochemical,and quantum-chemical methods with emphasis on the location of the Ti ions in framework or extraframework positions, their coordination,and the relationship of some spectral features with concrete structures at the atomic level, confirmed the presence of Ti(IV) framework sites.12 All this experimental and theoretical work on characterization is the basis for understanding catalyst behaviour and reaction mechanisms at the molecular scale,as well as for designing improved catalysts.
Interesting sites for catalytic applications were created when other metal atoms, namely tin atoms, were placed into framework positions of Beta zeolite (Sn-Beta). The catalytic behaviour of Sn sites in zeolites is different from that of Ti sites. Whereas TS-1 or Ti-Beta catalyze epoxidation reactions, Sn-Beta shows a null-activity for this reaction. In contrast, Sn-Beta is active for the BaeyerVilliger oxidation of cyclo- hexanone in the presence of hydrogen peroxide whereas Ti-Beta gives only low conversions.13,14 Water-resistant tin sites show activity for the carbonyl-ene reaction,15 Meerwein PonndorfVerley reduction16 and for ether formation starting with two alcohols,17 and they have been applied in the synthesis of industrially produced fragrance compounds such as nopol acetate,18 menthol,15 d-decalactone19 and melonal.20 The Lewis acid sites of Sn-Beta zeolite were characterized by 119Sn MAS NMR,14 DR-UV/Vis,14 XPS and in situ EXAFS spectroscopies and by TEM microscopy,21,22 and all these data suggested the presence of tetra-coordinated tin atoms incorporated into the zeolite framework by isomorphous substitution of silicon atoms. However, a clearer picture on the reactivity behaviour of Sn-Beta was obtained when density functional theory (DFT) calculations and IR spectroscopy of probe molecules were combined with catalytic activity studies.23 It was demonstrated that most sites in Sn-Beta zeolite consist of Sn atoms in framework positions coordinated to four silyloxy groups (site A), and that a second type of site consisting of partially hydrolyzed Sn atoms in framework positions (site B) are also present and show a higher catalytic activity.
Herein, we expand this study and include Sn sites in other matrices and with different ligands, and investigate the catalytic behaviour of these materials for other reactions.

(Sn-silicalite) and mesoporous amorphous MCM-41 have been considered. Lewis acid sites of types A and B in different frameworks, together with Sn atoms coordinated to two silyloxy groups and either two hydroxyl groups (site C) or two methyl groups (site D), and species with a SnOSn bridge (site E) have been studied. The Lewis acid properties of these sites have been investigated by means of DFT calculations on model clusters and by IR spectroscopy of probe molecules,and have been related to the experimentally measured catalytic activity of these materials for different reactions.

Experimental Materials MCM-41-Sn materials were prepared according to the following procedure.
Starting from an as-synthesized all-silicon MCM-41 the template was extracted following a previous work.24 By heating the sample to 100 1C for 2 hours with dynamic vacuum the adsorbed water was eliminated. The grafting of Me2SnCl2 onto the pre-treated and activated MCM-41 material was carried out with a solution of the corresponding amount of grafting agent (Sn/Si ratio of
0.0100.015) in anhydrous toluene at room temperature. After
1 h, triethylamine was added and the suspension stirred for one additional hour to eliminate and trap hydrochloric acid,i.e. to complete the SnOSn bond formation. After washing with toluene (50 mL) and drying overnight at 100 1C, the organic components were removed by calcination at 580 1C for 3 hours in an air stream. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples indicate that the mesoporous structure of the MCM-41 material is maintained after the grafting process.
Sn-MCM-41 samples with the tin introduced during the MCM-41 synthesis were prepared following the published procedure.25 Atomic absorption spectroscopy gave contents of 1.30 wt% and 1.07 wt% of SnO2 for Sn-MCM-41 and MCM-41-Sn(OH)2, respectively.
Sn-Beta zeolite with a Si/Sn molar ratio of 120 was hydro- thermally synthesized at 140 1C in fluoride medium according to previously reported procedures.14,26 The tin content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy and was
2.0 wt% of SnO2. The material was calcined in a furnace at
580 1C for 3 h and material Sn-Beta-B, rich in B sites was obtained.23 For the preparation of Sn-Beta-A samples, the catalyst precursor was calcined in a glass reactor in flow of dry air at 580 1C for 3 h.23 Sn-Silicalite with a similar Sn content (Si/Sn = 100) was prepared following recipes described in the literature.27,28 The synthesis was carried out hydrothermally at 150 1C in basic medium from a gel of the following molar composition:1 SiO2 : 0.009 SnO2 : 0.40 TPAOH : 30 H2O. The gel preparation involved the hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate in an aqueous solution of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) with stirring and, finally, an aqueous solution of SnCl45H2O was added. The crystallization lasted for 5 days and the product was recovered by filtration, washed with water, dried at 100 1C and calcined at 550 1C in a furnace in order to remove the occluded organic material. The samples were submitted to characterization by means of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, N2 adsorption measurements and diffuse reflectance (DR) spectroscopy in the UV-visible region.
Catalytic tests with adamantanone For the zeolite Beta samples, 500 mg of adamantanone were mixed with 500 mg of 35% aqueous hydrogen peroxide and
3.0 g of dioxane. For the MCM-41 samples 150 mg of
adamantanone were mixed with 150 mg of 35% aqueous hydrogen peroxide and 3.0 g of dioxane. A 50 mg sample of the catalyst was added and the reaction mixture was heated to 90 1C. The progress of the reaction was monitored by gas chromatography (HP-5 column,15 m, 0.32 mm inner diameter,
0.25
mm film with an adequate temperature program). A blank experiment showed that conversion in the absence of catalyst can be neglected. The TOF values were calculated taking all tin centers on an average with the yields obtained after one hour reaction time.
Catalytic tests for the cyclization of citronellal into isopulegol Citronellal (630 mg) was dissolved in acetonitrile (3.00 g) and a 50 mg sample of the catalyst added. The mixture was stirred and heated to 80 1C. The reaction was followed by gas chromatography (HP-5 column, 30 m, 0.32 mm innner diameter, 1.0 mm film with an adequate temperature program).
The TOF values were calculated with the yields obtained after one hour reaction time.
Catalytic tests with cyclopentanone and cyclobutanone One hundred mg of cyclopentanone or cyclobutanone and 100 mg of 50% aqueous hydrogen peroxide were dissolved in
3.0 g of dioxane. A 50 mg sample of the catalyst was added
and the reaction mixture stirred and heated to 90 1C (30 1C for cyclobutanone). The progress of the reaction was monitored by gas chromatography (HP-5 column, 15 m, 0.32 mm innner diameter, 0.25 mm film with an adequate temperature program).
The TOF values were calculated with the yields obtained after 30 minutes reaction time.

Computational details The model for the type A site in Sn-Beta was obtained by cutting a cluster of atoms containing a Si atom in the T9 position and four coordination spheres around it from the periodic structure of pure silica BEA29 zeolite. Then, the dangling bonds that connected the cluster to the rest of the solid were saturated with H atoms at 1.49 A from the Si atoms and oriented towards the positions occupied in the crystal by the oxygen atoms in the next coordination sphere, and the central Si atom was substituted by Sn. The hydrolysis of an SnOSi bridge to obtain a model for the type B sites was simulated by removing one Si atom from the model and saturating the corresponding dangling bonds with H atoms.
A similar procedure was followed to obtain type C sites,although in this case more (OSi) units were removed to better simulate grafted species. Type D sites were obtained by substitution of OH groups in the site C model by CH3 groups,and type E sites were obtained by substitution of a second Si atom by Sn. The clusters used to model type A and B in Sn-silicalite were constructed following the same procedure,but starting from a cluster of atoms containing a Si atom accessible from the main channel and four coordination spheres around it that was cut out from the periodic structure of pure silica MFI30,31 zeolite.
The geometries of the cluster models and of the structures obtained by adsorption of CH3CN on them, depicted in Fig. 1, were optimized with the density functional B3PW91 method32,33 using a LANL2DZ effective core potential basis set for Sn34 and the standard 6-31G(d,p) basis set35 for C, O, Si and H atoms. In these calculations only the coordinates of the terminal H atoms were kept fixed at their original positions.
Orbital energies and occupancies were produced with natural bond orbital
(NBO)
methods.36 All calculations were performed using the Gaussian03 computer program.37 IR measurements FTIR spectra have been recorded with a BioRad, FTS-40A FTIR spectrophotometer, by using a conventional quartz Fig. 1 Optimized structures of the acetonitrileSn adducts formed on the different sites considered in this work, and molecular composition of the LUMO of Sn-Beta zeolite. 2878  Phys.

The catalyst powder was pressed into self-supporting wafers (5 mg) and activated at 250 1C in a vacuum for 1 h, before carrying out adsorption experiments. Adsorption of deuterated acetonitrile (4200 mbar) and citronellal (0.73 mbar) were performed at room temperature using a calibrated volume (1.55 cm3). In all cases, FTIR spectra of the unloaded catalyst sample were recorded as reference spectra. Deconvolution of the IR spectra was done using the ORIGIN software program.

Results and discussion
3.1
Tin sites in amorphous MCM-41 mesoporous molecular sieve The catalytic activity of tin-containing zeolites is related to its Lewis acidity or ability to form an adduct with a Lewis base.
This interaction involves an electron density transfer from the occupied orbitals of the Lewis base to the empty orbitals of the Lewis acid, and is proportional to the energy difference and degree of overlap between these orbitals. Thus, in principle,the Lewis acidity of tin-containing zeolites can be related to the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy: the more stable the LUMO, the higher the acidity of the site.
Another aspect to be taken into account is that the LUMO of Sn-zeolites does not correspond to the dz 2 atomic orbital on the metal atom, as is the case for Ti-zeolites, but is a linear combination of the four anti-bonding s*(SnO) orbitals (see Fig. 1). As a consequence, an increase in the electron density in this orbital by formation of an acidbase adduct causes a lengthening of the four SnO distances, an action that is rendered difficult or even inhibited by the rigidity of the zeolite framework. Thus, the acceptance of electron density and therefore the Lewis acidity of a site will also depend on the framework flexibility around this site.
The interaction of a probe molecule such as acetonitrile with a Lewis acid center involves an electron density transfer from the lone pair on the N atom to the catalyst LUMO. As a consequence the CN distance becomes shorter and the n(CRN) vibration frequency shifts to higher values, this shift being an accurate measure of the acidity of the center. The LUMO energy of the model sites AE (geometries described above), and the calculated values of a number of parameters describing the interaction of acetonitrile with these sites are summarized in Table 1.
The hydrolysis of one SnOSi bridge in type A sites to obtain type B sites causes an increase in the intrinsic Lewis acid character of the site, reflected in a slight stabilization of the LUMO, and an increase in the framework flexibility around the Sn atom. Adsorption of acetonitrile on site B in the Sn-Beta zeolite model is more exothermic than on site A,the distance between the molecule and the Sn atom is shorter, the occupancy of the lone pair on the N atom orbital is smaller,indicating a larger degree of electron density transfer and,as a consequence, the shift in the n(CRN) vibration frequency is more pronounced. These two types of centers were identified in Sn-Beta samples by means of IR spectro- scopy of adsorbed acetonitrile. A band with a higher relative shift, appearing at 2316 cm1, was ascribed to a site interacting more strongly with acetonitrile (site B), while a band showing a much faster desorption of acetonitrile upon heating appears at lower frequencies, 2308 cm1 (site A). Then, the catalytic activity of a number of Sn-Beta samples with different concentrations of A and B sites was examined for a test reaction, the BaeyerVilliger oxidation of adamantanone.
A direct correlation between the initial reaction rates and the concentration of type B sites was obtained, while no correla- tion with the total amount of tin centres could be observed.
Moreover, it was found that higher concentrations of type B sites were achieved by increasing the water concentration during the catalyst activation procedure, which was related to the hydrolysis of more SnOSi bridges during this process.
This was the experimental confirmation that type B sites are the origin of the catalytic activity of Sn-Beta zeolites.23 Now, the question arose whether the Lewis acidity of Sn-containing catalysts could be further boosted by hydrolyzing a second SnOSi bridge, leading to the formation of type C sites. It can be seen in Table 1 that the LUMO energy of type C sites is slightly higher than that of B sites. However, the flexibility obtained by hydrolysis of a second SnOSi bridge compensates the lower intrinsic Lewis acidity of C sites, and all calculated parameters (adsorption energy, adduct geometry,orbital occupancy and n(CRN) shift) indicate that the inter- action with acetonitrile is as strong as on the B sites. It is also important to remark on the small difference in the frequency shift between sites B and C, that is not as significant as for sites A and B. So it can be concluded that it will be difficult to distinguish sites B and C by FTIR spectroscopy.
As a next step, these theoretical values should be compared with spectroscopic data. Hence, grafting of Sn centres onto mesoporous MCM-41 starting with a dialkyl precursor was considered to be the best way to prepare type C sites in or on a siliceous material, and therefore a MCM-41-Sn(OH)2 material was synthesized.38 For comparison reasons, Sn-MCM-41 was Table 1 Interaction of acetonitrile with different Sn-catalysts.

The FTIR spectra of acetonitrile adsorption on Sn-MCM-41 and MCM-41-Sn(OH)2 samples are similar. They show the presence of a broad band centered at 2310 cm1 due to acetonitrile interaction with Lewis acid sites together with another band at 2272 cm1 related to acetonitrile interacting with silanol groups (Fig. 2). The strong similarity between both spectra indicates the existence of the same type of Sn sites, but with a slightly different distribution. This was unexpected, since the direct synthesis started with a tin-precursor that was able to form four bonds with the siliceous matrix aiming for type A sites, whereas the tin precursor for the grafting process could only form two bonds with the siliceous matrix favouring the type C sites. This result indicates that,during the calcination process, a distribution of the tin atoms occurred governed by the surface morphology of the support.
Thereby, in the material with the grafted sites, the formation of type A sites can occur by condensation of a SnOH group,formed previously by oxidation of the alkyl in the grafted material, with a silanol group. This process is known to occur between two silanol groups during calcination, and should be responsible for the formation of type A and B sites in the grafted material. On the other hand, this result also indicates that, in the material obtained by adding the tin precursor to the synthesis of the siliceous matrix, i.e. Sn-MCM-41, type A sites are not the only Sn sites present. Analogously to Sn-Beta,these sites can be partly hydrolyzed to form sites B and C.
With respect to a more exact interpretation of the FTIR spectra of adsorbed acetonitrile, it was supposed that acetonitrile coordinated to sites A of MCM-41 should be reflected by an IR band at approximately 2308 cm1, and acetonitrile coordinated to sites B at approximately 2316 cm1. In a previous work we have shown that the local geometry of a site in a particular position of a zeolite has a certain influence on the Lewis acidity of the tin centre, but that this influence is not as important as that of hydrolyzing one SnOSi bridge to convert sites A into B. Since the mesoporous MCM-41 material is amorphous, the atoms are not situated in equivalent crystallographic positions and the local geometry of the centers is expected to be variable, but this effect is less important than the nature of the site (A or B).
When the deconvolution is carried out, the broad band centred at 2310 cm1 that should be due to acetonitrile interaction with Lewis acid sites was devolved into three components at 2318, 2308 and 2298 cm1 for the grafted material MCM-41-Sn(OH)2 and at 2322, 2310 and 2297 cm1 for the Sn-MCM-41 molecular sieve obtained by direct synthesis. In both materials an important contribution related to acetonitrile interacting with silanol groups was observed at 2271 cm1 and 2275 cm1 for MCM-41-Sn(OH)2 and Sn-MCM-41, respectively (Fig. 3). Hence, two of the three components of the band related to Lewis acid sites can be easily assigned. The higher n(CRN) stretching vibration shifts of the 2318 and 2322 cm1 IR bands are assigned to sites B and C, whereas the second component (2308 and 2310 cm1) Fig. 2 FTIR spectra of adsorbed acetonitrile on (a) MCM-41-Sn(OH)2,(b) Sn-MCM-41, and (c) MCM-41-SnMe2.

Attempts were also made to assign the bands appearing at 2298 and 2297 cm1, following two different working hypotheses.
It was first considered that the transformation of the grafted dimethyl precursor was incomplete, and that type D sites were present in the mesoporous material. DFT calcula- tions indicate that acetonitrile adsorption on type D sites is weak but energetically favourable. However, the LUMO energy is the highest among all the sites considered, and therefore the transfer of electron density is small and no shift in the n(CRN) vibration frequency is observed. This is in agreement with an FTIR experiment with the catalyst precursor. No acetonitrile adsorption has been observed by IR spectroscopy on the MCM-41-SnMe2 sample, the catalyst precursor before the calcination activation (see Fig. 2). Both results exclude sites D as the ones detected by acetonitrile adsorption causing a band at 2298 and 2297 cm1.
As a further origin of these IR bands, a model site E was considered containing SnOSn bridges formed either during the grafting process itself or during the subsequent activation.
The interaction of acetonitrile with site E was theoretically studied, but DFT calculations indicate that such species are as strong Lewis acids as sites B and C, and therefore cannot explain the observed 2298 and 2297 cm1 bands. However,although these sites could not be assigned to a definite geometry of a tin site, from the catalytic point of view the site should not play an important role. On one hand, the popula- tion of this unassigned species is minor (14 to 33%, cf. Table 2,entries 3 and 4) with respect to sites A and B/C. On the other hand, the catalytic activity should be zero since the frequency of adsorbed acetonitrile appears even at lower wavenumbers than the one obtained for catalytically inactive A sites.
Now the catalytic activity of the different samples for the BaeyerVilliger oxidation of adamantanone was examined.The TOF values (turnover frequency, mol of substrate converted per mol of metal per hour) reported in Table 2 were very close for MCM-41-Sn(OH)2 and for the Sn-Beta-B sample. These values were 160 h1 and 165 h1, respectively,when all tin sites were considered equivalent (see Table 2,entries 2 and 3). The numbers were much higher, but again in the same order of magnitude, when related only to the B/C sites as indicated by theoretical, spectroscopic and experi- mental observations, namely 889 h1 and 917 h1, respectively (see Table 2, entries 2 and 3). In contrast, the numbers obtained with the Sn-MCM-41 sample were lower namely 140 h1 and 667 h1 (cf. Table 2, entry 4). In this case, due to the amorphous structure of the walls it might be possible that not all tin centres were accessible. In the direct synthesis the tin is distributed all over and within the support whereas the grafting process introduced the metal only onto the surface of the material. This would lower the catalytic activity when calculated on an average for Sn-MCM-41 and this was indeed observed experimentally.
Finally, an MCM-41-SnMe2 sample was prepared that contains practically only type D sites. As expected, this material showed no activity (Table 2, entry 5). This result confirmed the theoretical calculations and the FTIR spectroscopy that have been discussed above.

Tin sites in an MFI structure The Lewis acid sites of Sn-Beta zeolite have been shown to be active for the carbonyl-ene reaction, both in the intramolecular version of the cyclization of citronellal to isopulegol15 and in an intermolecular version in which terminal olefins react with formaldehyde.18 The cyclization of citronellal is an inter- mediate step in the production of menthol. This fragrance compound has an estimated worldwide consumption of 6000 tons/year39 and is used in many consumer products such as cigarettes, chewing gums, toothpastes, pharmaceutical and personal care products. Of the eight stereoisomers of menthol,only ()-menthol possesses the refreshing peppermint odour and physiological cooling effect that makes it valuable. For a high selectivity towards this product the cyclization of citronellal to isopulegol has to be highly diastereoselective towards the ()-isopulegol isomer,something which is achieved in the industrial process with a homogeneous catalyst, namely with ZnBr2 in stoichiometric amounts.40 It is clear that a heterogeneous catalyst would lead to an intensification of the production process, and in this sense Table 2 Turnover frequencies (TOFs) for tin-containing zeolite Beta and MCM-41 materials as catalysts in the BaeyerVilliger oxidation of adamantanone Entry Catalyst TOFb/h1 Site distributiona TOFc/h1 B/C : A : other 1 Sn-Beta-A 16 1 : 99 : 0

Downloaded by Lomonosov Moscow State University on 21/01/2014 09:40:56. very promising results have been obtained with Sn-Beta and Zr-Beta zeolite.41,42 The mechanism of cyclization of citronellal to isopulegol was investigated by means of DFT calculations41 and it was suggested that, in an analogous way to the BaeyerVilliger reaction, the substrate is activated by coordination of the carbonyl group to the Lewis acid Sn centre. This was confirmed by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy. The IR spectra of citronellal adsorbed on the tin Beta zeolite showed two bands at 1729 and 1715 cm1 associated with two adsorption modes of the carbonyl group, a weaker one and a stronger one (cf. Fig. 4). Moreover, the cyclization reaction can be followed in situ by FT-IR spectroscopy since bands assigned to the citronellal substrate disappear (2714, 2816 and 2967 cm1) and bands characteristic for the isopulegol product arose (3088, 3552 2853 and 1395 cm1; cf. Fig. 4). The carbonyl band of the adsorbed citronellal at 1729 cm1 disappeared with time,i.e. during the transformation of citronellal into isopulegol. On a first view, this indicated the transformation of the substrate on the weaker Lewis acid site. However, it can also be considered that the transformation occurred on the stronger site and the isopulegol product is then displaced immediately by a fresh substrate molecule that moved from a weaker site to the stronger site. The latter explanation is in better accordance with earlier experimental and theoretical data.41 When the diastereoselectivity of this cyclization was examined it was found that although acetonitrile is not necessary for the reaction to proceed, it has a beneficial effect on conversion and also on the diastereoselectivity. In a working hypothesis it was discussed whether acetonitrile could be co-adsorbed to the catalytic centre and, thereby, restrict the space around the reac- tion centre, not as much as to impede the approach of a substrate molecule, but enough to improve the diastereoselectivity.41 The hypothesis was sustained by the fact that bulkier nitriles could further improve the diastereoselectivity, unless too bulky molecules impede the approach of the carbonyl substrate,and then the conversion decreased.
This problem has been studied here by in situ IR spectro- scopy. Hence, citronellal was adsorbed onto the Sn sites and the excess of substrate was removed by evacuation of the cell.
Then, acetonitrile was brought into contact with the catalyst and, indeed, a shift in the n(CN) stretching vibration was observed that indicated that acetonitrile was adsorbed onto sites A and B of Sn-Beta. However, no influence on the shift of the carbonyl group was observed and therefore, it has to be stated that no evidence for the co-adsorption of a carbonyl group and a solvent molecule (acetonitrile) could be found by in situ IR spectroscopy. Probably, the transition state of the cyclization is optimized by the presence of acetonitrile in an alternative way.
For the design of a heterogeneous catalyst for the cyclization,the space available around the catalytically active Lewis centre was identified as an important factor for achieving a high diastereoselectivity.41 Therefore, a zeolite structure with a smaller pore size than Beta zeolite, namely silicalite-1 with MFI structure, was chosen. Sn was incorporated into MFI zeolite by direct synthesis following a recipe based on previously published reports.27,28 The characterization of this material by using different techniques confirmed that it was a crystalline MFI zeolite. The XRD patterns of the as-prepared and calcined samples (Fig. 5) indicated that they matched well with those of the MFI structure and no diffraction lines corresponding to SnO2 were observed. Nitrogen adsorption measurements on the calcined Sn-Silicalite sample gave an isotherm very similar to that of Sn-free Silicalite confirming its good crystallinity. The DR-UV visible spectra (not shown) indicate that the intensity of the signal is very low and the absence of a band at around 280 nm allowed us to discard the presence of SnO2 particles. The infrared spectra in the frame- work vibration region of the calcined Sn-Silicalite was compared with a Sn-free Silicalite zeolite (not shown). The spectra of the two samples were very similar except for a more intense shoulder at around 960 cm1 exhibited by the Sn-containing Silicalite. This band has also been observed in different zeolites containing framework metals and has been attributed to SiOM vibrations. Although its origin is still under discussion, it is generally taken as an indication of metal incorporation into the framework.

The Sn-Silicalite (Sn-Sil-1) catalyst was first tested on its catalytic activity in the cyclization of citronellal into isopulegol.
Table 3 shows that the reaction in the presence of Sn-Sil-1 material was orders of magnitude slower than with the Sn-Beta-B catalyst. Two reasons to explain this result may be suggested, namely a lower intrinsic activity of the Sn sites in Sn-Sil-1 zeolite, or problems due to the smaller channel size either for diffusion or for accommodation of the transition state within the channel. With the aim of clarifying this point,a second test reaction was chosen with a smaller molecule, i.e. the BaeyerVilliger oxidation of cyclopentanone. This reaction minimized the potential problems due to diffusion through the pores of MFI zeolite and some activity was observed for Sn-Sil-1. The TOF number was significantly lower than for Sn-Beta, namely 10 versus 32, respectively (cf. Table 4,entries 1 and 2), and it could still be argued that the reaction product valerolactone, that involves a six-membered ring molecular structure, might still have diffusion problems in the Silicalite channels. Thus, an even smaller molecule,cyclobutanone, was also reacted to give the corresponding lactone. Again, similar results were obtained, namely a significantly higher activity for the Sn-Beta than for the Sn-Sil-1 catalyst (see Table 4, entries 3 and 4). It can then be concluded that the lower activity in the tin-sites of Sn-Sil-1, at least for cyclopentanone and cyclobutanone that can diffuse into the pores, has to be due to a lower intrinsic activity for the BaeyerVilliger oxidation.
The acidity of Sn-Sil-1 sites was also investigated by means of DFT calculations performed on models of sites A and B in an MFI structure. The LUMO energies summarized in Table 1 suggest that type A sites in Sn-Sil-1 might have a slightly higher intrinsic acidity than in Sn-Beta. However, the inter- action with acetonitrile is weak and the frequency shift in the n(CRN) stretching vibration is similar to that obtained for Sn-Beta-A. In the case of type B sites in Sn-Sil-1, the calculated parameters indicate a lower intrinsic acidity in relation to sites B in Sn-Beta, a slightly weaker interaction with acetonitrile,and a similar shift in the n(CRN) vibration frequency.
However, the most clear conclusion from these DFT calcula- tions is that the acid character of Sn centers in zeolites depends less on the zeolite structure than on the type of site (A or B).
Assuming that the catalytic activity for the BaeyerVilliger oxidation of cyclopentanone is only due to type B sites, a lower content of these B sites in the Sn-Sil-1 sample could be inferred from the results of Table 4.
For further insight on these sites, the Sn-Sil-1 sample was submitted to IR spectroscopy of acetonitrile adsorption. One band at 2309 cm1 was observed related to Lewis acid sites,together with another band at 2277 cm1 due to Brnsted acid sites or silanol groups. The band at 2309 cm1 confirms the incorporation of tin centres in zeolite network positions mainly as type A sites. The presence of type B sites could not be confirmed due to their low concentration. Even at low acetonitrile loading a clear asymmetry of the IR band is not observed. To definitively clarify this question, zeolite samples with a higher concentration of sites B should be synthesized.
The results obtained from the DFT and spectroscopic studies indicate that the Sn-Silicalite catalysts can still be improved by converting, at least partly, sites A into sites B or C. Hence,work on the generation of sites B in Sn-Silicalite is still in progress.

Conclusions Different types of tin sites can be evidenced by means of IR spectroscopy of adsorbed probe molecules such as acetonitrile in combination with DFT calculations. The nature of these sites depends on the zeolite structure and can be modified by the pre-treatment conditions. Tin species with one or two hydrolyzed SnOSi bridges act as strong Lewis acid sites,and are highly active in several reactions. On the other hand,tin species in framework positions coordinated to four framework siloxy groups are not active.
It has been established that synthesizing Sn-containing materials by different direct synthesis or post-synthesis methods does not necessarily produce different materials.

On the other hand it has been established that when introducing tin atoms by isomorphous substitution of silicon atoms into a zeolite framework, the resulting sites can possess a different geometry. Whereas tetrahedral tin sites in the Beta-zeolite environment are partly hydrolyzed to sites with three silyloxy groups, in a Silicalite-1 structure this hydrolysis has not been definitively confirmed by IR spectroscopy.
These two examples indicate that FTIR spectroscopy with probe molecules is a very useful method for the characterization of catalytically active sites, and when in combination with DFT calculations on model clusters it gives useful hints on the geometry of the metal sites.
