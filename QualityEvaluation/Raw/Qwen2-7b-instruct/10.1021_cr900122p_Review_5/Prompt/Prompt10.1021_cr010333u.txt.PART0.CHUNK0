I. Introduction and Scope
This review is focused on the use of solid Lewis acids to promote catalytic oxidations. While the concept of using Lewis acids to promote the reaction of organic substrates with oxidizing reagents is widely accepted in homogeneous catalysis, this concept has not become evident and generally used in heterogeneous catalysis until recent days. Certainly the development of new Lewis acid solids active and selective for catalytic oxidations is an urgent need and a challenging scientific target for some substrates especially using environmentally friendly oxidants. Since the replacement of current stoichiometric oxidations for the production of fine chemicals by environmentally benign catalytic oxidations is one of the major tasks in green chemistry, solid Lewis acids are called to play a crucial role to accomplish this goal.
In the review, we will see the still important role that stoichiometric oxidations play in our daily life, and how they are being substituted by catalytic oxidations. At this point, three general mechanisms in which Lewis acids are involved will be described, and the material has been organized starting from homogeneous and ending with solid catalysts for heterogeneous oxidations. A bridge between the two will be established by presenting catalytic systems that can fill the gap between the two systems helping to rationalize the nature of the catalytic active sites in solid systems.
This review is obviously focused on solid oxidation catalysts, and the core of the review is organized to show the evolution from the simplest strategy for heterogeneizing homogeneous catalysts, i.e., supporting the active species on large surface area solids, to the more elaborate ones in which the active sites are part of the solid structure. Given the importance of metallosilicates, and more specifically titanosilicates, as catalysts in commercial processes, special attention has been paid to these types of materials.
Although sufficient references are provided to early seminal work, special emphasis has been given to most recent contributions to this area, particularly of the last 10 years. Patent literature has also been extensively covered in this review. Examples to illustrate the concepts have been selected among recent publications, and an effort has been made to present a series of commercial and near commercial processes based on catalytic oxidations. Finally, twoshort sections have been devoted to present how catalytic oxidations can be used to eliminate a series of pollutants, and how catalytic oxidations are present in our domestic life.
II. Oxidation Strategies
Since the beginning of the petrochemical industry, oxygen was the only possible oxidant that could be used in the production of bulk chemicals due to the huge production volumes and the economics of the processes. The higher added value of specialty chemicals allows the choice among other oxygen atom donors such as H2O2, alkyl hydroperoxides, and sodium hypochlorite.
Fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals are characterized by a much lower production volume and much higher added value. In addition, from the chemical point of view they encompass a wide diversity of chemical structures, often relatively complex and having concurrently different functional groups. This complicates enormously the transfer of a chemical process from the synthesis of a given fine chemical to a different one. In practice, the synthesis of each individual chemical is considered independently and surely requires a specific research and development to be implemented. Also, their high molecular weight and the presence of functional groups generally precludes performing oxidations in the gas phase and the processes for the production of fine chemicals have to be necessarily developed in the liquid phase, very frequently in a multipurpose batch reactor.
In the synthesis of fine chemicals, the chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity of the oxidation reaction is the crucial issue. The wide diversity in structures, combined with the relatively low production volume and the need of selectivity, explains why innovation in these industrial oxidations did not become a priority.
Noncatalytic, stoichiometric oxidation using conventional oxidants are still in use for numerous processes involving the oxidative CC double bond cleavage, the transformation of primary and secondary alcohols into acid derivatives, aldehydes and ketones, heteroatom oxidation, oxidation at allylic and benzylic positions, etc. Stoichiometric oxidants are used in the production of a very wide number of pharmaceuticals, fragrances, agrochemicals, etc.; traditional oxidation methods involve the use of stoichiometric quantities of high oxidation state Cr, Mn, or Os reagents, among others. 1 Despite the important role still played by stoichiometric oxidations, the general trend is the development of catalytic processes to replace traditional stoichiometric oxidants such as dichromate, chromate, permanganate, manganese dioxide, osmium tetroxide, lead tetraacetate, etc. The need to develop alternative environmentally friendly catalytic oxidations derives not only from the nature and potential toxicity of the metal present in the stoichiometric oxidant, but also from the general principle of green chemistry to reduce the volume of byproducts formed in the overall synthetic route. In catalytic oxidations, the stoichiometric oxidants are molecular oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxide, persulfate, percarbonate, perborate, hypochlorite, etc., that do not release any metal ion as a byproduct in the process.
Two related examples in which an obsolete way to produce a chemical using a stoichiometric oxidant has been replaced by a catalytic oxidation are the preparation of hydroquinone from benzene and the production of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (menadione) that is an intermediate for vitamin K. In the first case (Scheme 1), not only the number of steps has been reduced and the stoichiometric oxidant replaced, but also the ratio between the weight of byproducts to the final product in the overall synthesis was decreased from over 10 to less than one. 2,3 Scheme 1 In the production of menadione (Scheme 2), the conventional route using chromium trioxide in sulfuric acid formed 18 kg of inorganic salts. This process was substituted by catalytic oxidation using 60% aqueous hydrogen peroxide over palladium(II) exchanged polystyrenesulfonic acid resin. 4 Scheme 2 The fact that Lewis acid sites can catalyze oxidation reactions is not sufficiently recognized and exploited in heterogeneous catalysis. Very frequently, solids containing transition metals are termed as redox catalysts, but they act in reality as solid Lewis acids. It is well established that soluble Lewis acids can act as promoters of oxidation reactions, and sufficient examples of this will be provided in the corresponding section.
Three are the general ways in which a Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions:(i) A Lewis acid can abstract a single electron from an electron-rich molecule.
(ii) The oxidation catalytic center is an assembly of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom that undergoes variation in its oxidation state through the catalytic cycle.
(iii) A Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions by forming acidbase adducts either with the substrate or with the oxidizing agent, enhancing their reactivity and thereby acting as catalyst for the oxidation.
The review has been organized by addressing each of these Lewis acid-catalyzed oxidation mechanisms in separate sections showing in each case the transition from homogeneous to heterogeneous catalysis.

III. Lewis Acids as Oxidation Catalysts
A. Oxidations by Single Electron Abstraction
Single electron transfer is in essence the most elementary oxidation in which oxidation is defined as a process in which a substrate losses electrons. Although electron abstraction by conventional Lewis acids is well documented, the location of the electron accepted by the Lewis acid cannot be frequently determined. The resulting organic radical cation is a highly reactive, short-lived reaction intermediate that can be subsequently trapped by water or any other nucleophile present in the medium or by oxygen, 5-7 and at the end oxygenated products are formed (Scheme 4). We will summarize briefly this type of process below.
Scheme 4 Benzene associates with strong Lewis acids such as antimmony pentafluoride or boron trifluoride in sulfur dioxide as a solvent. 8 The oxidation potential of benzene is lowered by this interaction, and the stronger the association with the Lewis acid the largest is the reduction of the potential. Values of 1.6 and 1.1 V have been determined for BF3 and SbF6, respectively.8 This decrease in the oxidation potential is responsible for benzene polymerization to form poly(p-phenylene) polymer.
AlCl3-doping can also serve to generate organic radical cations through electron abstraction from electron-rich substrates. Electron-rich aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds such as anthracene and thianthrene are readily converted into their corresponding radical cations by adding anhydrous AlCl3 in a polar, inert solvent such as liquid SO2.7 Analogously, quasi-monodimensional p-type semiconductors can be obtained by adding small amounts of AlCl3 into the hydrocarbon chain matrix of discotic liquid crystals such as those derived from hexahexyloxytriphenylene. 9,10 Lewis acid sites have been proposed to be responsible for the aerobic oxidation of polycyclic aromatic compounds adsorbed on silica and zeolites. For instance, tetracene gives rise to 5,12-tetracenequinone as the major product together with lesser amounts of 5,12-dihydroxytetracene and 5,12-dihydro-5,12-dihydroxytetracene following a first-order rate constant of 1 × 10-5 s-1. 11 Apparently, the reaction intermediates involved in this process are the corresponding radical cations of the electron rich aromatic generated through electron transfer from the arene to the Lewis acid sites.
Given the simplicity of the electron transfer generation of aromatic radical cations and their ability to react with molecular oxygen to form oxygenated products with high selectivity, it is surprising that these reactions have not yet been exploited in large-scale industrial processes. They will require only to have sufficiently high oxidation potential Lewis acid sites to generate the radical cation intermediate.
A practical scale for measuring the ability of the acid sites of a solid for the generation of radical cations versus truly acid behavior has been proposed based on the combination of reactant test molecules and quantification of the radical cation population by means of EPR spectroscopy. 12 1,4,5,8-Tetramethylnaphthalene undergoes a facile acid (either Brnsted or Lewis) rearrangement to 1,3,5,8-tetramethylnaphthalene and then to other tetramethylnaphthalene isomers. In contrast, the corresponding radical cation of 1,4,5,8-tetramethylnaphthalene is stable and does not undergo any rearrangement.12 By measuring the extent of methyl rearrangement and radical cation population, a scale of the capability of acid sites toward electron-transfer abstraction can be obtained for a series of oxidant-solvent combinations. This test reaction appears to be very useful to quantify acidity versus oxidation ability of Lewis acids and their applicability deserves to be demonstrated in other systems.
Lewis acids of zeolites are also known to generate organic radical cations. By combining an EPR study of the generated radical cations with MAS 27Al NMR spectra of dealuminated mordenite, a relationship between the presence of Lewis acid sites and the oxidizing ability of mordenite has been proposed. 13 Thus, the radical cation of 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene is characterized by EPR after adsorption of 2,5-dimethyl-1,5-hexadiene or 2,5-dimethyl-3-hexene on dealuminated mordenite. The intensity of the signal correlates with the presence of extraframework Al. When extraframework Al is removed by mineral acid leaching or chelation with oxalic acid, only a very weak EPR signal was detected. Thus, it was proposed that although Brnsted acid sites may be responsible for the major catalytic activity of mordenite, its ability to abstract one electron to generate persistent radical cations relies on extraframework Al.13 Analogously, incorporation of α-pinene, trans-isolimonene, and α-terpinene in H-mordenite allows one to record the same EPR spectrum that was assigned to α-terpinene radical cation. 14 From the lack of deuterium labeling when α-pinene was adsorbed on deuterated mordenite, it was concluded that the rearrangement to α-terpinene is not catalyzed by Brnsted acid sites, but most likely by Lewis acids which would be responsible for the single electron oxidation of the three terpenes.14 Vanadium(IV) and oxovanadium(IV) Schiff base complexes have been prepared and were found to exhibit catalytic activity toward the aerobic oxidation of p-phenylendiamine to the corresponding semi-oxidized radical cation form (Scheme 5). 15 Scheme 5 On the other hand, oxovanadium complex catalyzed oxygenation of disulfides is likewise facilitated by Lewis acids. It has been found that the activation of Lewis acids for the electron transfer to quinones and oxygenation with oxovanadium have in common a decrease in the oxidation potential of the diaryl disulfides, thus, facilitating their single electron oxidation. 16 It was found that catalytic amounts of Lewis acid (substrate/Lewis acid ratio 200) promotes polymerization of diaryl disulfides through a mechanism that involves the electron transfer from the diaryl disulfide to an equivalent amount of an oxidizing reagent such as p-benzoquinone.16 Compared to Brnsted acids such as trifluoracetic acid, SbCl5 and FeCl3 are over 200-fold more active to facilitate the electron transfer between diphenyl disulfide and p-benzoquinone in which linear poly(thio-1,4-phenylene) is formed.
Transition metal oxidative polymerization followed by concomitant doping of the resulting conjugated oligomer or polymer is sufficiently documented in the literature. 17,18 Doping of conjugated polymers increases enormously their electrical conductivity and is necessary in many of the potential applications of these materials. A procedure to obtain oligofurans with a high degree of conjugation and with an ordered aromatic structure consists of treating furan with FeCl3 as the oxidizing reagent in polar aprotic solvents, such as propionitrile. 19 The resulting oligomer is soluble in organic solvents and when blended with poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) a film with good mechanical resistance can be cast. The electrical conductivity of these films containing well-polymerized polyfuran after I2 doping is several orders of magnitude higher than that reported earlier for intractable polyfurans.19 Poly(2,5-furandiylvinylene) can be prepared by aldolic condensation of 5-methylfuran-2-carbaldehyde in a single step (Scheme 6). 20 This polyfurandiylvinylene can be doped with Lewis acids such as AsF5 and FeCl3 or iodine. The electric conductivity varies from 10-8 S cm-1 for the polyfuran to 10-2 S cm-1 for the AsF5 doped material.20 Scheme 6 Transition metals have been used to effect the chemical 21,22 or electrochemical polymerization 23 of pyrrole in water. FeCl3 is a general reagent to effect the polymerization of conducting polymers from five-member ring heterocycle monomers. 24 Polyaniline exhibiting a low polydispersity and high solubility in organic solvents can be obtained by oxidative polymerization with H2O2 using transition metal as catalysts. 25 Lewis acids such as metal chlorides oxidize the π electrons of conjugated polyene sequences formed in the dehydrochlorination of PVCs. 26 As result of this electron transfer, polarons of the incipient conjugated polymer are formed, which accelerate the chain mechanism of the dehydrochlorination. In contrast, organotin chlorides intercept the alkyl chains and produce the retardation of PVC dehydrochlorination.26 These processes are related to the degradation of PVC and the way in which it can be protected, and they have a considerable economic impact given the ample use of PVC.
The previous examples demonstrate that, in contrast to the general belief, Lewis acids can truly act as oxidation catalysts when the organic substrate has a sufficiently low oxidation potential and the corresponding radical cation is generated. In other cases, however, the reaction mechanism is more complex and the Lewis acid sites alone do not promote oxidation but they cooperate with other sites present in the catalyst. A classical example of this is the Mars and van Krevelen oxidation mechanism discussed in the next section.
B. Oxidations by an Assembly of Lewis Acid, Lewis Basic, and Redox Centers
In these type of oxidations, the catalytic center is in reality an assembly of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom that undergoes variation in its oxidation state through the catalytic cycle. This type of catalytic mechanism follows what is known as a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism. 27-34 The structure at the atomic level of active sites of metallic oxides that catalyze oxidation reactions via Mars and van Krevelen mechanism has been recently reviewed.32 The structure, size, and relative strength of each of these individual sites, that conform the catalytic centers, are termed as inorganic oxide molecular clusters and define the overall activity and specifity of the bulk solid catalyst. The Mars and van Krevelen mechanism is one of the most general mechanisms for oxidation reaction in metallic oxides, being the cooperation of acidbase and redox sites the key point for catalysis.31 It consists of a series of elementary steps that include: (i) activation of the substrate on a metallic cation; (ii) insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens; and (iii) a redox process at the metallic site and the transfer of one or several electrons. In the first step, metallic cations act as Lewis acid sites, and the basic sites are surface O= or OH- species. The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer. Thus, the active sites require a spatial organization at atomic level and the cooperation of distinctive atoms.31 Some examples of processes that are believed to occur through this mechanism include the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, isobutyric acid oxidative dehydrogenation to methacrylic acid on hydroxy phosphates, and propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide. In the latter case, it is known that the overall activity of the catalysts depends on the basicity of the support and on the presence of isolated VOx sites. Water has been found to be necessary in some cases to provide hydroxylated surface sites allowing the reaction mechanism to operate.31 Several transition metal oxides and ions are active catalysts for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, and the catalytic activity can also be explained based on their acidbase properties. In this way, higher valent incompletely coordinated metal ions or anionic vacancies on oxide surfaces can act as acidic sites, and oxygen ions, O2-, as basic sites. The influence of the acidbase properties on the selectivity for hydrocarbon oxidations has been largely reported in the literature. 35-38
1. Vanadium-Based Systems
Vanadium is among the most active transition metals capable to effect alkane oxydehydrogenation, oxygenations, and alkylaromatic oxidations. In this regard, vanadium phosphates and aluminophosphates, as well as supported vanadium oxides, are widely used for this purpose. In the next two sections, we will comment on the catalytic activities of these vanadium-containing solids and the established relationship with Lewis acid sites. a.Influence of the Acidity on the Catalytic Activity of Vanadium Phosphate. In agreement with the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, surface characterization techniques have provided some evidence in support of the presence of Lewis acid and basic sites during the operation of vanadyl phosphates as oxidation catalysts. Thus, high-resolution and in situ electron microscopy of vanadyl pyrophosphate after being reacted with n-butane or other reducing molecules has shown that the surface structure undergoes a significant modification during the catalytic process. 39 Two sets of symmetry related defects are created during the catalytic reaction. It is suggested that these defects are oxygen vacancies at sites linking corner-sharing phosphorus tetrahedra and vanadyl octahedra in the active plane.39 These vacancies create Lewis acid centers. It is proposed that these defect sites play a key role in the activation of the alkane, particularly for selective dehydrogenation reactions.39 Accordingly, this interpretation would indicate that oxygen atoms of the catalyst are consumed during the reaction.
For the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride by vanadyl pyrophosphate, the process is supposed to occur specifically on the (1.0.0) face of crystal. This assumption is supported by the spatial distribution of the atoms in the catalyst exposed to the CC and CH bonds of n-butane. 40 Vanadium phosphate catalysts have been modified by developing the (2.2.0) plane of VOHPO4·0.5H2O and introducing bismuth in its composition. The change in the surface characteristics by varying the P/V ratio results in an increase in the number of Lewis acid sites and the ionic strength of such sites, leading to an enhanced catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and an increased yield of ethylene. 41 Also ferric phosphate with and without Pd impregnation is active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid. During this reaction, amorphous FePO4 undergoes reduction to Fe2P2O7 at 300 C. The presence of palladium metal facilitates this reduction. 42 In some cases, acidity may play a negative role, as is the case for the selective catalytic oxidation of para-substituted toluenes to the corresponding benzaldehydes over vanadyl pyrophosphate. 43 Benzaldehyde adsorption on the catalyst surface largely facilitates deeper oxidation to aromatic carboxylic acids. Coadsorption of pyridine suppresses the strong aldehyde adsorption and improves benzaldehyde selectivity. Electron donating para-substituents favor the aldehyde adsorption on the catalyst and cause their total oxidation.43 Vanadium phosphate supported on TiO2 has been tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at temperatures between 300 and 400 C, showing satisfactory performances (80% selectivity to propene at 2% propane conversion at 300 C, and 56% propene selectivity at 9% propane conversion at 400 C). Addition of water or pyridine to the feed decreases propane conversion but increases propene selectivity. 44 Vanadium phosphate and other vanadia-supported solids are also catalysts for the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride. It is under discussion whether this reaction requires the presence of one or more vanadium sites. By means of in situ Raman spectroscopy, it has been proposed that the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is more efficient at sites with more than one vanadium atom. 45 A recent mechanistic investigation of n-butane oxidation using 13C-labeled butane has been interpreted, however, assuming that the two methyl groups bind to a single vanadium atom through a cyclic organometallic intermediate. 46 An industrial process for the butane oxidation to maleic anhydride (Alusuisse Italia-Lummus Crest maleic anhydride or ALMA) based on the use of unsupported (VO)2P2O7 in a fluidized bed reactor has been reported. 47 In situ Raman spectroscopy as well as low-temperature CO adsorption monitored by IR suggests that the reversible oxidation and reduction between vanadyl pyrophosphate and a phase of vanadyl phosphate operates on the surface during the selective oxidation of n-butane exhibiting a relatively high selectivity toward maleic anhydride. 48 In general, the influence of metal dopants and promoters on vanadium phosphates are discussed in terms of the Lewis acidity that they introduce in the solid. Thus, the influence of a series of promoters (Nb, Si, Ti, V, Zr, Cr) for the n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride over bulk vanadium phosphorus oxide has been compared with that occurring on supported vanadia. 49-51 It was concluded that in both cases the catalysts requires the simultaneous presence of surface redox and acid sites and that the acidity also plays a role controlling further kinetic steps of n-butane oxidation. In this way, a correlation between maleic anhydride selectivity and the Lewis acidity of the promoter cations and oxide support in the case of supported vanadia has been found.50 It has been found that niobium phosphate acts as promoter for the vanadyl pyrophosphate oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride. 52 Apparently, (NbO)PO4 is isostructural to α-(VO)PO4 both having a tetragonal structure, while the resulting mixed phosphate maintains the oxidizing capability of (VO)2P2O7 together with a strong Lewis acidity introduced by Nb.52 Characterization of the surface acidity of vanadiumphosphorus oxide catalysts with XRD pattern of vanadyl pyrophosphate has been undertaken using ammonia, pyridine, and acetonitrile as basic probes monitoring by IR spectroscopy. 53 The stronger bases detected the presence of both Brnsted and Lewis acid sites, whose ratio increased with the temperature indicating that Brnsted centers are stronger than the Lewis sites. A study of the use of these mixed oxides as catalysts for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride revealed that the yield of anhydride and the proportion of the strongest Lewis acid sites increases with time on stream, thus suggesting a relationship between both.53 In another study, the adsorption of ammonia on the surface of vanadyl pyrophosphate 54 used as catalyst for the ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile has been monitored by IR spectroscopy. Ammonia is adsorbed on Brnsted and Lewis acids sites. At room temperature, ammonia forms mainly ammonium, but increasing the temperature up to 400 C results in a progressive increase in the proportion of ammonia coordinated to surface Lewis sites.54 The presence of gaseous oxygen lowers the amount of coordinated ammonia, probably due to the formation of amido NH2 species. Propylene is adsorbed as a π-complex to the vanadium Lewis acid sites and in the absence of oxygen is transformed into acrylonitrile through the intermediacy of propylamine. On the other hand, propane does not form detectable adsorbates in the absence of oxygen, but in its presence the formation of acrylate is observed.54 This observation has led to the conclusion that two alternative pathways of acrylonitrile formation from propane operate in vanadyl pyrophosphate. The first in anaerobic conditions goes through propylamine, and the second, when oxygen is present, involves the reaction of acrylate and chemisorbed ammonia species, the latter pathway being much more rapid than the first. b.Influence of the Acidity on the Catalytic Activity of Supported Vanadium Oxides. Supported vanadium oxides are among the most important heterogeneous catalysts for the vapor-phase oxidation of alkylaromatics, alcohols, and alkenes. 55-58 It is well-known in this type of catalysts that the nature of the metal oxide support plays an important role modulating the nature of V species and the catalytic behavior for oxidation reactions. Vanadium dispersion (related to the loading and the nature of the support) and acidity of the catalyst are the main factors to be considered. 59-61 A correlation between the isoelectric point (acidbase character) of the support and the photoluminescence of VO groups has been recently found. 62 Acidity also plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity of the supported vanadium oxide. 63 Kinetics and mechanistic studies of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over a series of vanadium, molybdenum, and tungsten oxides supported on zirconia have led to the suggestion that the rate determining step is the CH bond activation using lattice O atoms (basic sites). 64 The activation energy of this step depends on the identity of the cation and increases in the order VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation activation energies are higher than those for propene combustion, but the relative rates of these reactions most probably also depends on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane. The latter parameter is mainly influenced by the Lewis acidity of the cations through π bonding with the CC double bond. This explains the observed difference in activation energy between propane oxidative dehydrogenation and propene combustion, that increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+).64 Potassium doping has a beneficial influence on the selectivity of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts for the oxydehydrogenation of butanes. 65 Apparently, addition of potassium results in a higher dispersion of vanadium species on the alumina support. This together with the presence of small amounts of K2O clusters leads to a decrease in the amount of exposed Al3+ Lewis acid sites and a lower redox ability of vanadium species.65 For all the supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the vanadium loading is a parameter of paramount importance in the catalytic activity of the solid. As the vanadium loading increases, aggregation occurs, thus, varying the nature of the vanadium species and their catalytic properties. For instance, for the catalytic behavior of δ-alumina-supported vanadium oxide for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and n-butane, it has been observed that the activity for dehydrogenation increases as the vanadium loading, while the selectivity toward alkene formation reaches a maximum at 34 wt %. 66 Apparently, the highest propene yields require of a solid containing redox sites of adequate potential combined with strong Lewis acid sites and mild basic sites.66 These findings seem to be in agreement with the operation of a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, that requires the combination of these three type of sites.Likewise, the selectivity of a series of catalysts based on vanadia supported on metal oxides toward the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride as a function of the loading shows that while the overall turnover number for butane oxidation is independent of the surface coverage of vanadium oxide, the selectivity toward maleic anhydride increases by a factor of 23 as the vanadium oxide coverage increases approaching monolayer coverage. 67 These observations were interpreted as indicating that n-butane oxidation only requires a single site, while formation of maleic anhydride requires the cooperation of a pair of vanadium sites. On the other hand, the metal oxide support influences both n-butane oxidation and maleic selectivity in a different way. It was found a correlation between the Lewis acid strength of the oxide support and the maleic anhydride selectivity.67 Divanadium pentoxide has been dispersed on a series of oxide supports including SiO2, TiO2, SnO2, TiO2/SiO2, MoO3/SiO2, and SnO2/SiO2 and the activity of the resulting solids as catalysts studied for the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. 68 The activity of these catalysts was also a function of the surface coverage. At very low conversions, formaldehyde selectivity increases linearly with the surface coverage, indicating that isolated V(V) species are responsible for the catalytic effect. In the case of V2O5 supported on SiO2, the selectivity reaches a maximum at 1%, and the decrease in the selectivity at higher coverages was explained as derived from an increase in the Lewis acid strength of the solid.40 The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide can be promoted by Lewis acid assistance of the support as, for instance, in alkane oxidation. Thus, studies of the structure and reactivity of group V metal oxides have been carried out by means of methanol adsorption and oxidation. 69 It has been found that the active sites present in pure V2O5 are primarily redox sites and the active sites in pure Nb2O5 are essentially acidic in nature. Furthermore, the surface redox sites present in pure V2O5 are orders of magnitude more active than the surface acid sites in pure Nb2O5 and consequently the catalytic activity of V2O5/Nb2O5 mixed oxides is largely dominated by the vanadia component.69 However, niobia presence enhances significantly the activity of vanadia for those catalytic reactions that require a dual nature of redox and acid sites. This is the case of butane oxidation to maleic anhydride and the selective oxidation of ammonia by NOx.In some cases such as magnesium meta-, ortho-, and pyrovanadates, the relative low activity toward alkane oxydehydrogenation as compared to other vanadia-supported selective oxidation catalysts such as V2O5/TiO2 and (VO)2P2O7 has been attributed to the basic environment generated by the MgO support, which causes a parallel decrease of the Lewis acidity influencing the oxidizing power of the active V ions. 70 On the contrary, the activity of Ag0.01Bi0.85V0.54Mo0.45Ox supported on δ-alumina, titania, silica, niobia, and zirconia for the direct conversion of propane to acrolein has been found to increase as the amount of Lewis acid sites surrounding the redox active VOx species present on the solid increases. 71 Although vanadium ions present on vanadium oxide act generally as redox sites, when supported on zirconia and titania they act as well as Lewis acid sites strong enough to form π complexes with toluene and m-xylene as evidenced by IR spectroscopy. 72 The methyl group of these π complexes becomes activated and undergoes hydrogen abstraction by the VO group leading to benzylic species and benzaldehyde.72 On the other hand, phenol is adsorbed through the oxygen atom and the phenyl ring is oriented perpendicular to the solid surface. Benzene is adsorbed forming mono and dimeric species.72 Lateral chain oxidation of alkylaromatics is an industrial process of paramount importance that can be also catalyzed by vanadium oxides. 73 Acidity also seems to play a role in this process, facilitating the oxidation. V2O7/TiO2 doped with K, Ba, Bi, W, and Sn oxides or carbonates exhibits catalytic activity in the oxidation of ortho-xylene to phthalic anhydride. At reaction temperatures higher than 370 C, good correlation between the strength of the acid sites and phthalic anhydride yield (K < Ba < Bi < unpromoted < W  Sn) was observed. 74 A restructuring of the catalyst, resulting in higher V/Ti surface ratios, occurs during the use of V2O7/TiO2 in o-xylene oxidation without any change in the crystallinity, the crystal size, or the +5 oxidation state of the V ions.74 In the heterocyclic version of the alkylaromatic oxidation, picoline can be directly oxidized with excellent yields (98%) by O2 in the gas-phase to nicotinic acid in the presence of V2O5-impregnated TiO2 (Scheme 7). 75 The latter catalyst contains Brnsted acid sites in addition to redox centers.Scheme 7 Propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile can be catalyzed by vanadiumantimony mixed oxides. 76 The use of these solids in propane ammoxidation causes the surface +V oxidation state to approach +IV and diminishes the vanadium surface enrichment. This is due to the aggregation of V species and the decrease in the surface density of V oxide. 77 Mixed NiCrV, MgCrV, and NiAlV oxides have been prepared by thermal decomposition of layered precursors of hydrotalcite structure at temperatures between 300 or 500 C. 78 Surface acidity of the resulting solids was studied by means of the FT-IR monitoring of pyridine adsorption and correlated with the dehydrogenation of 2-propanol to acetone at 300 C. It was found that this oxidation occurs more extensively on Cr-containing mixed oxides due to the lack of Brnsted acidity and the exclusive presence of Lewis acid sites.78 The results have been correlated again with the operation of the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism.In general, it can be summarized from the above two sections that vanadium phosphates and supported vanadium oxide are the solids of choice for alkane oxydehydrogenation and oxygenation in the gas phase. However, for oxidations in the liquid phase there is a considerable leaching of vanadium species from the solid to the solution. These dissolved vanadium species are responsible for most of the catalytic activity observed in solution. Attention has to be paid when trying to detect the leached vanadium species, since after cooling the reaction mixture, they can redeposit on the solid that will act as a reservoir for soluble catalytically active species.This lack of catalyst stability of vanadium-containing solid will be also commented on in the next sections and is the reason that despite the inherent activity of vanadium for catalytic oxidations, the use vanadium-containing solids has not been expanded to liquid-phase reactions. Although vanadium is by far the most important transition metal for hydrocarbon oxygenations, many other metal oxides have also been used as oxidation catalysts, and this will be discussed in the next section.
2. Metal Oxides Other than Vanadium
Compared to zirconia, sulfated zirconia exhibits also oxidizing properties giving rise to the formation of phenol and trimethylphosphane oxide by adsorption of benzene and trimethylphosphane, respectively. 79-81 These two oxidative processes are something that is not observed for sulfate-free zirconia.81 The reaction mechanism has been firmly correlated to the intermediacy of radical cations generated through electron transfer from the organic compound to sulfated zirconia. EPR spectroscopy provides some evidence suggesting the formation of SO3•- radical anion during the oxidation of trimethylphosphane oxide.80,81 Analogously to sulfate, it has been found that the addition of just a small amount of chromium oxide (1 wt % Cr) to zirconia increases remarkably both the number and strength of the acid sites. 82 Characterization indicates the presence of both Brnsted and Lewis acid sites on the surface of CrOx/ZrO2 and that the oxidation state of Cr can change reversibly between Cr(VI) and Cr(III).82 Supported metal catalysts are widely used for the partial oxidation of alkanes or alcohols. The catalytic effects are not only due to changes in the metal dispersity but also to the interaction of the metal with the Lewis acid sites of the support. Experimental evidence indicates that the support and modifiers or promoters play a pronounced influence on the oxidation state of the metal atoms, ions, or partly charged clusters. Some additives exert an electron seeking effect on the metal surface state, stabilizing ionic states and increasing the effective charge of the metal ions, favoring their fast reduction during the catalytic cycle. For instance, while platinum deposited on alumina forms a platinum compound on the solid surface, the weaker electron acceptor properties of charcoal compared to alumina determines that the species present on charcoal surface is predominantly metallic platinum. 83 The active oxidation states of supported metal catalysts, such as Cu, Ag, and Au can be discussed by IR spectroscopy, UVVis spectroscopy, XRD, XPS, EXAFS, and electron microscopy. Comparison of the catalytic and the spectroscopic data reveals that metal cations are the active sites of the metal catalyst surface in alcohol oxidation. 84 High temperature methanol chemisorption and in-situ IR spectroscopy have been used to determine quantitatively the number of active sites available for methanol oxidation in bulk mixed metal molybdates. 85,86 It was found that Mo atoms are the sites in which methanol are bound and that the activity of the mixed metal molybdates decreases with the increase in the accompanying cation electronegativity due to electronic variations on the metalOMo bonds. The same effect is observed for supported metal oxides.85,86 Diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy has been used to investigate the influence of the solid composition and treatment on the population and relative proportion of Brnsted/Lewis acid sites of silicaalumina supported Mo oxide catalysts. 87 It was found that the ratio Brnsted-to-Lewis acid population increases with the SiO2 content of the support reaching a maximum for silicaalumina 75:25 or for alumina-rich supports this ratio also increases with the MoO3 loading.87 Analogously, EPR spectroscopy supports that Ce(IV) ions not fully coordinated are responsible for the Lewis acidity of ceria and CeO2 supported on silica. 88 The matrix influences the cerium distribution and the electron-acceptor redox properties of coordinatively unsaturated Ce(IV) ions.88 IR titration using pyridine as base has shown that silica-, alumina-, and zirconia-supported tantalum oxide are considerably more Lewis acidic than analogous vanadia-supported oxides.63 Spectroscopic characterization reveals that there may be two different tantalum species present on the surface. Distorted tetrahedral TaO4, having a TaO tripodally bound to the solid surface through three single TaO bonds and octahedral TaO6. The former predominates at low coverages. The activity of supported tantalum oxide has been studied as catalyst for methanol oxidation and their performance compared to vanadia.63 The activity and stability of solid catalysts for methane-CO2 reforming depend on the formation of carbon deposits due to methane decomposition into C and H2. 89 This carbon deposited on a metal site can be reoxidized to CO by oxygen coming from the dissociation of adsorbed CO2. For noble metals, this oxidation of deposited carbon is fast, leading to low carbon accumulation on the metal particles.89 What is remarkable is that the rate of carbon formation from methane was proportional to the concentration of Lewis acids. Thus, the combination of Pt with a support with a low Lewis acidity such as ZrO2 was found more suitable for long stability of the catalysts. For nonnoble metals such as Ni, the rate of methane dissociation exceeds the rate of carbon reoxidation to CO, and carbon deposits develop rapidly in the form of filaments. The rate of carbon filament formation was proportional to the Ni particle size and may be interesting for the production of carbon nanotubes. 90,91 Thus, in order for these solids to act as efficient catalysts, it is necessary to reduce the particle size below a critical particle size value (d < 2 nm). Well dispersed Ni supported on ZrO2 is a viable alternative to noble metal-based catalysts for methane-CO2 reforming.89 Partial oxidation of propane to syngas has been carried out in a flow reactor using as catalyst nickel oxide supported on alumina, magnesia, and silica. 92 Alumina-supported NiO was found the most suitable catalyst. Modification of these catalysts by alkali metal oxides or rare-earth oxide reduces the strength of the Lewis acid sites, and by decreasing the carbon deposition increases the stability and lifetime of the catalyst during propane partial oxidation.92 In the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons under mild conditions, the solid oxide catalysts can be viewed as a reagent that is regenerated after each redox cycle.40 New reactor design like transported bed and membrane reactors have been developed based explicitly on this principle.40 In this context, it has been reported that alkali metal doping of transition metal oxides endowed the oxides with the ability to convert CH4 to ethane and ethene. Thus, nickel oxide doped with lithium was an active catalyst for oxidative coupling of methane. On the basis of XRD analysis, it has been proposed that LiNiO2 is the actual solid catalyst. According to eq 1, methane would react to form C-2 products and water with the lattice oxygens of LiNiO2. These structural oxygens would be in turn regenerated by molecular oxygen (eq 1). 93 The influence of the nature of a metal oxide among Ca, Sm, and Yb in mixed oxides with zirconia in equimolar amounts has been studied for the oxidative coupling of methane. The activity of the catalysts is proportional to the specific surface area of the mixed oxide, while the selectivity toward C2 hydrocarbons increases in the series CaO < Sm2O3 < Yb2O3. 94 Characterization has revealed that the solids do not have Brnsted acid sites, but there are three different types of Lewis acid sites. The total concentration of these Lewis sites however follows the reverse order found for the selectivity of these mixed oxides toward the oxidative methane coupling to C2.94 The applicability of surface science techniques to obtain insights on the mechanism of heterogeneous reactions catalyzed by metal oxides has been exemplified in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene catalyzed by iron oxide. 95 The information provided by surface science techniques in ultrahigh vacuum has been combined with batch reactor measurements at high pressure.95 Ethylbenzene and styrene adsorb on regular terrace sites with their phenyl rings oriented parallel to the surface. The π electron cloud of the aromatic rings interact with the Lewis acidic atoms on the surface. Atomic defects are identified as catalytically active sites. A complete mechanistic description of the process at the atomic level is proposed in which the upward tilted ethyl group of flat adsorbed ethylbenzene is dehydrogenated at Brnsted basic oxygens located at defects.The conversion of methane into methyl formate with high molar yields (>12%) has been attained by a two reactor system. In the first one, the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde is accomplished at 600700 C on SiO2. Subsequently, formaldehyde is dimerized to methyl formate through a Cannizzaro disproportionation at 130170 C on various metal oxides, including titania, silica, zirconia, and sulfated zirconia. 96 Partial oxidation by oxygen of methanol to formaldehyde has been studied over SiO2- or MoO3-supported ferric oxide in supercritical CO2 at 90 bar. 97 Formaldehyde selectivity was found to depend on the percentage of iron on the support, the nature of the support, and the reaction temperature. Compared to silica, molybdenum oxide as support favors the formation of formaldehyde. This higher selectivity is related to the formation of iron molybdate as the active catalytic phase. FT-IR data indicate that the first step in all reaction processes is the generation of adsorbed iron-methoxy species.97 Molybdena supported on titania prepared from aqueous solutions of ammonium heptamolybdate and titania or by mechanical mixing of both oxides is also very active for the partial oxidation of methanol. 98 Fine-tuning of the Lewis acid/base properties of the surface pairs has been proposed as the important factor to control the activity and selectivity for the oxidative coupling of methane using solid solutions of rare earth and bismuth oxides. 99 From the catalytic tests in fixed-bed flow reactors, it has been found that the activity toward C2 products increases with catalyst basicity, while an increase in the Lewis acidity of the Bi cation leads to an enhancement of the ethene selectivity.99 Solgel chemistry using metallic complexes as precursors has been used to prepare FeAl mixed oxide exhibiting activity as catalyst for the liquid-phase cumene oxidation. It has been proposed that the mixed oxide acts as a bifunctional catalyst containing Lewis acid sites and terminal O centers. 100 As mentioned for the case of supported vanadium oxides as catalysts for liquid-phase reactions, the possibility of metal leaching and subsequent homogeneous phase catalysis by the leached metal should be addressed in this type of catalyst.Likewise, heterogeneization of cobalt atoms by simple coprecipitation in the formation of silica gels using Co(OAc)2 has been reported to be effective for the side chain oxidation of alkylaromatic using tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant. Diffuse reflectance UVVis and IR spectra of the solid seem to support the presence of tetrahedral Co(II) (detached from acetate anions) in the silica framework. 101 Ozone and several of its 18O-labeled isotopomers have been adsorbed on metal oxides such as silica, titania, zirconia, magnesia, and ceria at liquid N2 temperature. 102 Ozone behaves as a weak basic molecule and interacts with surface hydroxyl groups. With weak Lewis acid sites, ozone molecules form coordination adducts via a terminal oxygen atom, with stronger Lewis acid sites (such as titania, alumina, and zinc oxide) no evidence of a Lewis adduct is obtained. Apparently, ozone dissociates on these sites generating highly reactive oxygen atoms. These oxygen atoms can participate in the catalytic oxidation of CO on oxide surfaces. 103 An IR study of adsorbed CO, NH3, C3H6, C3D6, and C3H6-O2 on oxidized and reduced samples of mixed titaniumantimony oxide showed that both oxidized and reduced solids contain basic sites, but lack of strong Lewis acid centers. 104 Interaction of propene occurs through the CH bond of the methyl group with the basic sites.104 Chromium(III) oxide is able to catalyze the disproportionation of chlorodifluoromethane. This reaction can be useful to prepare commercially important fluorinated methanes and apparently takes place on coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species. 105 Several solids have been developed for the MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer reactions exhibiting the typical advantages with respect to homogeneous catalysts, like easy handling and workup and recycling. A review discussing the use of amorphous metallic oxides and zeolites, particularly Beta and silicalite as catalysts for the MeerweinPonndorfVerley reaction has recently appeared. 106 Amorphous metallic oxides and zeolites that exhibit surface basicity or Lewis acidity are generally the solids used as catalysts for this type of disproportionation.Layered clays have been extensively used as acid catalysts and as supports for oxidants (clayfen and claycop) and Lewis acids (clayzic). 107-110 Hydrogen cyanide has been proposed as a probe of the Brnsted and Lewis nature of the acid sites in metal-oxide pillared clays. 111 Upon exposure of metal oxide-pillared clay to saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, a decrease in the density of sites that interact with HCN is observed by IR spectroscopy.111 The outcome of this study based on the HCN probe is that while the metal oxide pillars are responsible for the Lewis acidity, the Brnsted acid sites are located on the clay sheets. A third type of site appears in the pillar fixation process. These distinctive sites associated to the pillaring process are most affected by the nature of the pillar and may exhibit selectivity to interact with a hydrocarbon. For example, zirconium oxide pillared hectorite interacts most effectively with benzene or toluene than n-hexane or cyclohexane.111 A natural bentonite pillared with aluminum, aluminumiron, and aluminumruthenium polyoxocations has been further ion exchanged with iron. 112 All these solids were active materials for the catalytic transformation of propene into acetone at temperatures between 150 and 350 C.112 The reaction proceed via acid-catalyzed propene hydration followed by dehydrogenation of 2-propanol to acetone. Accordingly, the activity of the solids correlates with the nature and population of the redox and acid sites.112 K10-montmorillonite and 4A molecular sieves catalyze the oxidation of secondary benzylic alcohols by tert-butyl hydroperoxide in good yield and selectivity, except when an electron-donating group is present in the 4-position of the phenyl ring. 113 The reaction mechanism was assumed to involve an Oppenauer-type oxidation. Using zeolite 13X as catalyst, a very enhanced activity was observed and interpreted as reflecting the fact that the reactants can be accommodated inside the zeolite cavities. However, besides the fast formation of carbonylic compounds, other competitive side reactions take place lowering the resulting selectivity.113
C. Oxidations via Lewis AcidBase Adducts
The third general way in which a Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions is by forming an acidbase adduct either with the substrate or with the oxidizing reagent, enhancing their reactivity and thereby acting as catalyst for the oxidation (see chapter II and Scheme 8). A typical example is the olefin epoxidation by titanium-containing zeolites that will be discussed latter. In this type of mechanism, the metal atom does not undergo variation in its oxidation state and the catalysis occurs because tetracoordinated titanium atoms bind to the hydroperoxide and enhance the electrophilicity of this oxidant. Thus, while TS-1 was initially described as a redox catalyst, it is now being increasingly recognized simply as a Lewis acid solid. 114 Scheme 8 Comparison of the oxidation rates using as substrate a sulfide and the corresponding sulfoxide can be used to distinguish the electrophilic or nucleophilic nature of the catalytically relevant active species (Scheme 9). Thianthrene oxide has been proposed as a probe molecule for this purpose (Scheme 10). 115,116 This type of study allows one to gain insight into the oxygen atom insertion process (either electrophilic or nucleophilic) and on the role and optimum structure of the catalyst. Thus, for instance, similar reaction rates have been measured for the oxidation of methyl p-tolyl sulfide and the corresponding sulfoxide by cumyl peroxide using titanium(IV)-(R,R,R)-tris(2-phenylethoxy)amine as catalyst. 117 Such behavior stands in contrast with the remarkably high selectivity exhibited by d0 transition metal peroxo complexes. This has led to the conclusion that the alkylperoxo complex formed by the attack of the cumyl hydroperoxide to the titanium catalyst is the actual catalytic species. This alkylperoxo displays a biphilic nature, behaving as electrophilic oxidant toward the sulfide and nucleophilic oxidant when it reacts with the sulfoxide. Theoretical calculations (RHF/3-21G*) and kinetic evidence indicate that the Lewis acidity of the Ti(IV) metal center activates the hydroperoxide and the sulfoxide in a template intramolecular process.117 Scheme 9 Scheme 10 All Lewis acid catalysts active in the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons contain transition metal cation of d0 or d10 configuration. The interaction of weakly basic unsaturated hydrocarbons with transition metal ions has been considered as weak base (hydrocarbon)strong acid (d0 cations), or weak base (hydrocarbon)weak acid (d10 cations) interactions. 118-120 Taking this into account, the selectivity of the oxidation will depend on the activity of the transition metal and decreases in the order indicated in Scheme 11.118 Scheme 11 It appears then that the adsorption and activation of hydrocarbons in oxidation processes can be regarded as acidbase interactions. 121 In this sense, a too strong adsorption of hydrocarbon on the oxidation acid sites will result in a too long contact time on the surface with the corresponding loss of selectivity. The hallmark of these Lewis acid catalyzed oxidations is that the oxidation state of the metallic ion does not change during the catalytic cycle. This occurs typically in catalytic oxidations that follow a mechanism in which the oxygen transfer occurs via peroxometallic intermediates: 122,123 Transition metals that react through peroxometalic species are Ti, Zr, Mo, and W.
With respect to the oxidating agents, the production of bulk products involves the use of air or oxygen. However, when the added value of the product increases, then other oxidants with a higher cost can be used. In Table 1 different oxidants are presented together with the active oxygen content and the corresponding byproduct formed.

1. Oxidations in Homogeneous Phase
There are plenty of examples in which Lewis acids catalyze oxidation reactions by coordinating either with the substrate (increasing its electron deficiency) or with the oxidizing reagent (enhancing its electrophilicity). The catalysis occurs truly through an acid/base mechanism. However, since the outcome of the reaction is the oxidation of a substrate, some misleading rationalization can describe these Lewis acids as redox catalysts. This misconception has been particularly frequent when the catalyst is a solid Lewis acid. The following examples in homogeneous phase have been selected to illustrate that Lewis acid assistance of oxidation reactions is very well established in solution. a.Use of Conventional Lewis Acids. A Japanese patent describes the preparation of 2,3,5-trimethylhydroquinone, an intermediate in the synthesis of vitamin E, 124 by catalytic oxidation of 2,3,6-trimethylphenol by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of boron trifluoride etherate or sulfuric acid using methyl ethyl ketone as solvent (Scheme 12).124 Scheme 12 It has been found that the presence of just a few equivalents of Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride or aluminum trichloride accelerates considerably the room-temperature oxidation of alkanes with chromate or permanganate. 125 In this context, cyclohexane can be oxidized at room temperature by barium ferrate, 126 permanganate,125 chromate125 in a mixture of acetic acid and dichloromethane giving a product distribution containing cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, and cyclohexyl chloride. The reaction requires the presence of a Lewis acid. Among the series of Lewis acids tested, the oxidation rate follows the order AlCl3 > FeCl3 >MgCl2 > LiCl > ZnCl2. This system is also able to oxidize ethane and propane to give mixtures of chloroalkanes and carbonylic compounds. It was proposed that in the case of ferrate the active intermediate is the Lewis acid adduct formed by coordination of an oxo ligand of the ferrate to the Lewis metal center. This adduct initiates the oxidation by abstracting one hydrogen atom from the alkane and generating a carbon-centered radical. Also barium ruthenate in acetic acid-dichloromethane oxidizes alkanes at room temperature with appreciable rates and yields, the reaction being remarkably accelerated by the presence of a few equivalents of Lewis acids. 127 The BaeyerVilliger oxidation transforms aldehydes into carboxylic acids or ketones into esters by reaction with carboxylic peracids. Despite the availability of carbonylic compounds, the potential of the BaeyerVilliger reaction in organic synthesis remains underdeveloped due to the lack of chemoselectivity when other functional groups, particularly CC double bonds, are also present in the molecule. The development of catalytic versions of the BaeyerVilliger can help to overcome the limitation of poor selectivity. An example of asymmetric BaeyerVilliger reaction for the formation of β-substituted γ-butyrolactones based on the concept of chiral auxiliary has been reported. 128 The process consists of using an enantiomerically pure acetal as the starting material for the BaeyerVilliger oxidation. The acetal is prepared from the achiral 3-substituted cyclobutanone and enantiomerically pure 2,5-pentanediol. Oxidation is carried out at low temperatures (78 C) using m-chloroperbenzoic acid assisted with SnCl4 as catalyst (Scheme 13).128 Scheme 13 The oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides by permanganate in anhydrous acetone solutions has been shown to be catalyzed by Lewis acid such as FeCl3, ZnCl2, and HgCl2. 129 The kinetics unequivocally confirm that the function of the Lewis acid is to activate the oxidant by forming a permanganate/Lewis acid adduct analogous to the protonation of MnO4- by Brnsted acids. A Hammett analysis of the reaction rate constant in a series of substituted thioanisoles gives a negative ρ value, indicating an electron deficient transition state. All the kinetic data including secondary kinetic isotopic effect and sulfide/sulfoxide competitive oxidation are consistent with a mechanism in which the oxidant and the reductant react via initial ligation.129 Sodium and silver bromates (NaBrO3 and AgBrO3) are stoichiometric oxidizing reagents in organic solvents for a variety of organic functional groups provided that the oxidation is assisted by Lewis acid catalysts. Among the compounds that can be oxidized are alcohols, acyloins, hydroquinones, and aldehydes. Primary benzylic CH are oxidized to aromatic carboxylic acids, while secondary CH are oxidized to ketones. 130 A heterogeneous version of this process uses Amberlite IRA-400 supported bromate, and the system has the advantage of being regenerated. 131 An analogous bromate reagent is benzyltriphenylphosphonium bromate, prepared by ion metathesis from benzyltriphenylphosphonium chloride with sodium bromate. 132 The quaternary phosphonium counteranion renders bromate more soluble in organic solvents. This oxidizing reagent is thermally stable and in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts can be utilized to oxidize efficiently in organic aprotic solvents. This bromate salt converts benzylic alcohols, cycloalcanols, and hydroxyketones into the corresponding carbonyl compounds in good yields and thiols to disulfides in moderate yields.132 Benzyltriphenylphosphonium periodate has been prepared in the same way as the corresponding bromate and exhibits a parallel behavior. Its use as oxidant reagent also requires the assistance of a Lewis acid. 133 Thus, for instance, aluminum trichloride or boron trifluoride etherate are active catalysts for the oxidation by tetrabutylammonium periodate of a series of organic compounds such as alcohols to carbonyl compounds, α-hydroxyketones to diketones, and α-hydroxycarboxylic acids to carbonyl compounds after decarboxylation, thiols to disulfide, and thioethers to sulfoxides. 134 Primary and secondary benzylic and saturated trimethylsilyl ethers are efficiently converted to the corresponding carbonyl compounds with silver bromate assisted by AlCl3. 135p-Hydroquinone trimethylsilyl ether is also converted to p-benzoquinone with either AgBrO3/AlCl3 or with NaBrO3/AlCl3. AgBrO3/AlCl3 is able to oxidize primary trimethylsilyl ethers to their carboxylic acids. Primary and secondary benzylic trimethylsilyl ethers are also converted to their carbonyl compounds with NaBrO3/AlCl3. AgBrO3 is more efficient and selective than NaBrO3.130 Thiophenes treated with m-chloroperbenzoic and boron trifluoride etherate form S-monoxide intermediates that undergo in situ cycloaddition with dienophiles to give the corresponding cycloadducts. 136 The presence of the Lewis acid enhances considerably the yield of the oxidative cycloaddition. Moreover, a larger number of dienophiles react with thiophene S-oxide giving cycloaddition when the Lewis acid is present.136 FeCl3-promoted oxidative coupling of methoxyarenes to form the corresponding biaryls is significantly enhanced in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of AlCl3, whereby yields between 28 and 85% with excellent selectivity are obtained (Scheme 14). 137 Scheme 14 Primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols and aromatic lateral chains can be air oxidized using N-hydroxyphthalimide and Lewis acids such as BF3 as cocatalysts. 138 The role of the Lewis acids is to weaken the OH bond of the hydroxylimide through hydrogen bond formation, favoring the homolytic OH bond breaking. The oxidation occurs through a chain reaction mechanism initiated by the nitroxyl radical derived from the hydroxyphthalimide.138 From the previous examples, it can be concluded that the phenomenon of the assistance of oxidation reactions by conventional Lewis acids (AlCl3, BF3, etc.) is quite general and well established in liquid phase. We will follow showing that transition metals behaving as Lewis acids are also homogeneous oxidation catalysts. b. Use of Soluble Transition Metals and Transition Metal Complexes. Transition metal ions are also Lewis acids that can bind to oxidizing reagents and in this way catalyze oxidation reactions.
Hydroperoxides are widely used as environmentally acceptable oxidizing reagents. In the presence of an aqueous carbonate solution as buffer, simple manganese(II) salts, such as MnSO4, catalyze alkene epoxidations. 139 The epoxidations are carried out at room temperature by dissolving the alkene and manganese salt in dimethylformamide or tert-butyl alcohol and slowly adding 30% H2O2 and 0.2 M sodium bicarbonate buffer. Among the obvious advantages of this homogeneous epoxidation process, besides the use of hydrogen peroxide as oxidizing reagent, the major one is the use of an inexpensive and off-the-shelf available catalyst that does not contain or require sophisticated organic ligands. Since bicarbonate is a necessary additive, it is proposed that the reaction mechanism involves the intermediacy of hydrogen percarbonate as the active oxidant.139 Obviously, despite its simplicity the drawback of this homogeneous process is the impossibility to recycle the catalyst and the production of manganese byproducts in the oxidation, although in substoichiometric amounts.
Electron-rich aromatic compounds can be brominated with KBr and H2O2 using V2O5, Mo7(NH4)6O24, or NH4VO3 as catalysts. 140 Reexamination of this reaction has shown that the process consumes stoichiometric amounts of an acid such as sulfuric acid. The system NaBr or KBr, diluted mineral acid (HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, or H3PO4) and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of divanadium pentoxide has been proposed as an alternative to other bromination reagents. 141 Lower alkanes such as methane can be catalytically oxidized into esters in the liquid phase using a media that combines very strong acidity and oxidation activity such as sulfuric acid using stable Pt-2,2-bipyrimidine complexes as catalysts and tellerium or antimony salts as cocatalysts. 142 Aqueous solutions of transition metals can catalyze aerial oxidation of substrates in a different phase. Thus, isomerized kerosenegas oil fraction at 170 C under pressure in the presence of an aqueous solution of transition metal carboxylates, particularly cobalt(II), undergoes oxidation to high-purity succinic acid that crystallizes from the aqueous solution. 143 Lateral chain oxidation of alkylaromatics to aromatic carboxylic acids is an industrial oxidation of huge economic importance that can be effected by transition metal catalyzed oxidation using oxygen as oxidant. Thus, a process for the manufacture of benzoic acid and its salts in which a quaternary ammonium bromide facilitates the oxidation of toluene has been reported. 144 In this process, the quaternary ammonium ion acts as phase transfer catalyst and the oxidation occurs at about 150 C and high pressure of oxygen (1215 atm) in the presence of catalytic amounts of a transition metal salt such as CoCl2 dissolved in water.144 Terephthalic acid can also be obtained through liquid-phase oxidation of p-phenylene compounds catalyzed by transition metal compounds. 145 2,6-Diisopropyl- and related 2,6-dialkylnaphthalenes can be oxidized by air oxygen under pressure in a batchwise manner using a mixture of Cu(OAc)2, Mn(OAc)2, and KBr as catalyst and acetic acid as solvent to form 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid with high yields. 146 Likewise, 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid was also prepared by oxidation of 1,4-dialkylnaphthalenes with oxygen using as catalyst a solution of transition metal in acetic acid. 147 1,4-Naphthalenedicarboxylic acid is an important starting material for the production of polyesters.
The target in the vast majority of oxidations using organic hydroperoxides is to obtain a valuable oxidized product, hydroperoxides being considered as reagent. An exception to this is the case of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide formed in large scale quantities in the oxidation of cyclohexane with oxygen. To process cyclohexyl hydroperoxide, it has been proposed the use of cyclohexene soluble transition metal compounds to catalyze the epoxidation of cyclohexene. Subsequently, the resulting cyclohexene oxide is reduced to cyclohexanol or transformed to other valuable cyclohexane derived product. 148 A process to obtain highly pure 1,1-dialkyl-4,4-bipyridinium salts from 1-alkylpyridinium ions consists of the coupling of the latter in the presence of alkali cyanide 149 in aqueous methanol, followed by removing the cyanide ion as a divalent transition metal cyanide. Colloidal or supported Cu(II) and Fe(III) hydroxides catalyze at room temperature in aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions the oxidation of catechol to muconic acid and benzene to phenol. 150 In the classical MeerweinPonndorfVerley reaction, a carbonylic compound becomes reduced using 2-propanol as solvent and reducing agent in the presence of aluminum isopropoxide as catalyst (Scheme 15). 151 Alkali metal alkoxides are inefficient to promote this formal hydride transfer. The same reaction, but now considered as the selective oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone, is known as the Oppenauer oxidation. Quantitative information about the equilibrium of a given MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer reaction can be obtained from thermodynamic data.
Scheme 15 The reaction mechanism of the MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer reactions has been reviewed. 152 Mechanistically, the MeerweinPonndorf VerleyOppenauer reaction is an example of an oxidation or reduction equilibrium that is catalyzed by a Lewis acid. These processes are related to the Cannizzaro disporportionation since the key step is a hydride transfer from a donor to an acceptor. In the case of the MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer, the reaction generally proceeds through a six-membered transition state in which both reductant and oxidant are coordinated to the metal center of a metal alkoxide catalyst. In aluminum-catalyzed reactions, ligand exchange is always the rate determining step, and it can be so slow that it precludes the use of aluminum alkoxides in catalytic amounts.
More promising as homogeneous MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer catalysts are lanthanide, zirconium, or hafnium complexes, which combine strong Lewis acid character and good ligand exchangeability. In lanthanide-catalyzed reactions, the ligand exchange is much faster and the reaction rate is dominated either by ligand exchange or by the hydride transfer step.The catalytic activity of lanthanide isopropoxides increases in the order La < Nd < Gd  Er  Yb, which follows the sequence of metal ion size, indicating that the Lewis acidity of the lanthanide catalysts is the major factor in the MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer reactions. 153 Metal alkoxide catalysts can be prepared from the metal halides by alcoholysis.152 High enantioselective MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer reduction in which the catalyst was a chiral lanthanide(III) alkoxide has been reported.152 The Oppenauer oxidation is a useful method to transform secondary alcohols into ketones. However, it is in general difficult to apply this reaction to convert primary alcohols into aldehydes. It has been found that bis(pentafluorophenyl)borinic acid at a catalyst/substrate ratio between 1 and 2 mol % is a suitable catalyst to oxidize secondary as well as primary allylic and benzylic alcohols to the corresponding ketones or aldehydes (Scheme 16). 154 Pivalaldehyde was used as hydride acceptor and magnesium sulfate was present as drying agent. The reaction was performed at room temperature. Apparently, the stronger Lewis acidity of perfluorinated diarylborinic acid compared to analogous pentafluorophenylboronic is the most important factor responsible for the catalytic activity of the former compounds.154 Scheme 16 A water-soluble [Ir(COD)Cl]2 catalyst (COD: cycloctadiene) in combination with 2,2-biquinoline-4,4-dicarboxylate has been found highly efficient for the selective Oppenauer oxidation of secondary benzylic and aliphatic alcohols to the corresponding ketones at a catalyst/substrate ratios ranging between 0.4 and 2.5%. 155 Methyl trioxorhenium has been found a robust catalyst to effect epoxidations and alcohol oxidations using hydrogen peroxide as oxidizing reagents. 156-159 Because of its Brnsted acidity, the addition of pyridine and its derivatives can have a positive effect, trapping hydronium ions that may be produced in the reaction with MeReO3. It has been observed that the binding constant of pyridines and methyltrioxothenium is governed by electronic and steric effects. For instance, the binding constant of parent pyridine is 200 L mol-1, whereas that of a better electron donor 4-picoline is 730 L mol-1 and that of sterically encumbered 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine is lower than 1 L mol-1. 160 Pyridine stabilizes the MeReO3/H2O2 system by decreasing the steady-state concentration of free MeReO3. The presence of these nitrogen heterocycles considerably reduces the rate of epoxide ring opening having a beneficial influence in the selectivity of the alkene epoxidation catalyzed by MeReO3.160 Thus, pyridine accelerates the rate of epoxidation of α-methylstyrene, while avoiding the problems derived from the acidity of MeReO3.Methyltrioxorhenium at 1 mol % is able to catalyze the selective oxidation of electron-rich aromatic compounds to the corresponding quinones using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant and a mixture of acetic acid and anhydride as solvent.159 Apparently, the anhydride acts as dehydrating agent during the reaction avoiding the interference of the water that is formed as product. As an example, 2-methylnaphthalene is oxidized at 60 C to give 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone with 87% conversion and 92% selectivity (Scheme 17).159 Scheme 17 Alkenes can be oxidized into the corresponding carboxylic acids via bond cleavage by H2O2 using methyltrioxorhenium and HBF4 as cocatalyst.158 Cyclopentadienyl trioxorhenium is able to effect the stoichiometric oxidative rearrangement of the ring in a series of alkyl substituted cyclopropenes. 161 The reaction mechanism has been rationalized in terms of an initial alkenemetal interaction, followed by formation and fragmentation of a metallaoxetane. In contrast, phenyl substituted cyclopropenes rearrange in the presence of cyclopentadienyl trioxorhenium to indenes, a process that is catalytic from the point of view of the rhenium and based on the behavior of other Lewis acids is explained in terms of a Lewis acid-catalyzed reaction.161 Obviously, the problem inherent to the use of soluble rhenium compounds as oxidation catalysts is that despite their remarkable activity they cannot be reused.The study of the effect of bidentate ligands on the olefin epoxidation using molybdenum oxobisperoxo complexes L-LMoO(O2)2 has served to establish the relationship between the Lewis acidity and the catalytic activity for epoxidation. This relationship supports an epoxidation mechanism in which the peroxo complex activates the oxidizing agent, either H2O2 or ROOH, rather than directly transferring an oxygen atom from the peroxo ligand to the olefin. 162 Proton transfer is one of critical points in the catalytic activity of such complexes in olefin epoxidation. NMR studies of proton transfer from strong Brnsted and Lewis acid to L-LMoO(O2)2 proves that protons are transferred preferentially to the 2-peroxo and not to the oxo ligand. 163 Cerium ammonium nitrate is an strong oxidizing reagent that can effect the stoichiometric oxidation of alkylaromatics to benzylic alcohols and nitrates and primary alcohols to aldehydes. 164,165 Cerium ammonium nitrate can even oxidize methanol. The stoichiometry of the process indicates the concurrent formation of protons during the methanol oxidation. It is believed that these protons are responsible of the cerium ammonium nitrate-catalyzed methanolysis of allylic and benzylic alcohols. 166 This reaction can also be catalyzed equally well by other Lewis acids, thus, reinforcing the assumption that cerium ions intervene as Lewis acids in this alcoholysis.166 Benzyl esters are formed catalytically at moderate temperatures from alkyl benzenes using sodium bromate as oxidant and cerium ammonium nitrate as catalyst in a carboxylic acid as solvent. 167 Thus, toluene gives benzyl acetate in acetic acid. Ethylbenzene, cumene, 4-tert-butyltoluene, and 4-bromotoluene behave similarly. Xylenes undergoes a selective monoacetoxylation. The cerium salts not only promote the oxidation, but they also act as a Lewis acids that catalyze the conversion of benzyl bromides into the benzyl esters.Metallic complexes with achiral or chiral ligands are widely used as homogeneous oxidation catalysts. Remarkable examples in terms of selectivity have been reported, the problem being always the impossibility of catalyst recovering and reuse in homogeneous phase. In the following, we will comment on some examples of complexes in the homogeneous phase in which acidity has been found to play a role in catalytic oxidations.Fluorination of 2,2-dihydroxy-1,1-binaphthyl increases the electrophilic character of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) or cumyl hydroperoxide coordinated titanium center in the sulfide oxidation to sulfoxide. 168 Surprisingly, under identical conditions, the titanium-catalyzed sulfide oxidation using 2,2-dihydroxy-1,1-binaphthyl or its 5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8-octafluoro derivative of the same absolute configuration leads to opposite sense of chiral induction.168 Binuclear Fe(III) complexes derived from N,N,N,N-tetrasubstituted 1,3-diaminopropan-2-ol having N-(2-pyridylmethyl) or N-2-benzimidazolylmethyl substituents exhibit a high reactivity as catalysts for the reaction of phenol and 2-deoxyribose with hydrogen peroxide. The active oxidizing species possesses an electrophilic character. It was proposed that the Lewis acidity of Fe(III), and the steric hindrance imposed by the ligand play a role in the reaction mechanism. 169 Aimed at the search of a reaction for the efficient fixation of CO2, a new catalytic system using chromium(III) bis(salicylaldimine) as catalyst and 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine as cocatalyst has been reported. 170 The process gives high yields of cyclic carbonates from the coupling of epoxides and CO2 at 50 psig pressure (Scheme 18). A variety of terminal epoxides including aliphatic and aromatic and epichlorhydrin affords the corresponding carbonates in near quantitative yield and complete selectivity. The catalyst is air stable, maintains its activity over a long reaction time, and does not require any solvent.170 Scheme 18 Soluble titanium alkoxides can act as homogeneous epoxidation catalysts in various solvents. 171-173 For instance, homogeneous phase catalytic epoxidation of cyclooctene to form cyclooctene oxide by tert-butyl hydroperoxide has been reported in supercritical CO2 using supercritical CO2-soluble Ti(OCHMe2)4 as catalyst. 174 Following the work of Sharpless and Katsuki on the enantioselective epoxidation of allylic alcohols using chiral titanium complexes of diethyl tartrate, 175-178 Jacobsen and Katsuki reported a series of chiral Mn (III) complexes with Schiff bases as enantioselective epoxidation catalysts for alkenes. 179-181 In this enantioselective catalytic epoxidation of olefins by alkyl hydroperoxides or other related oxidizing agents, optically active oxo(salen)manganese(V) complexes are the key reaction intermediate in the oxygen atom insertion step. At temperatures below 78 C, the oxygen atom insertion ability of this oxo(salen)manganese species is suppressed and, under these conditions, they act exclusively as chiral Lewis acid catalysts for the Diels Alder cycloaddition of cyclopentene with α-bromoacrolein, giving the corresponding cycloadduct in 68% enantiomeric excess and with high exo selectivity (Scheme 19). 182 Scheme 19 A case of highly chemoselective oxidation of allylic alcohols to enones has been reported as a function of the (salen)Cr(III) counteranion using iodosobenzene as oxidant. 183 When Cl- is the (salen)Cr+ counteranion the chemoselectivity to enones is excellent, while for triflate and hexafluorophosphate nearly equal amounts of enone and the epoxy alcohol are obtained. This influence of the counteranion on the oxidation of allylic alcohols mediated by (salen)Cr+ complexes has been rationalized in terms of Lewis acid catalysis by the complex when Cl- is the counterion and redox catalysis in the case of CF3SO3- and PF6-.183 A review has recently appeared in which the ability of biomimetic metal complexes of Co(II), Fe(II), and Mn(II) derived from open chain N2O22- and macrocyclic N42- Schiff base ligands to bind and activate dioxygen has been discussed. 184 Oxygen binding has been correlated with the activity of these complexes to catalyze the oxidation of hydroquinone by O2. In general, catalytic activity is only observed for those complexes that are able to bind oxygen at the central metal atom in the +II oxidation state, although the observed differences in activity could not be rationalized by differences in the oxidation potentials and/or Lewis acidity of the central metal ions. Iron and manganese complexes with some special peripheral substituents reduce dioxygen completely to oxide giving oxygenated oxo derivatives.184 By means of sterically encumbered tris(pyrazolyl)borate as ligand, the way in which cobalt complexes activates dioxygen has been found. Initially, a peroxo dimer is formed that gives rise to the oxocobalt complex. Other oxidants such as N2O forms the hydroxycobalt active species. 185 Metalated porphyrins have been used as catalysts for the degradation of lignin in wood or pulp, hydroxylation of (cyclo)alkanes, and epoxidation of alkenes by TBHP 186 or iodosobenzene. 187 The use of perchlorinated porphyrins increases the stability of these compounds as catalysts. 188,189 The oxo transfer ability from the nitro ligand to alkenes using (nitro)(pyridyl)cobalt(III) tetraphenylporphyrin has been investigated as a function of the apical pyridine ligand either 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine or 3,5-dichloropyridine. 190 Very modest differences were observed for hexacoordinated complexes, while oxo transfer occurs rapidly through the pentacoordinated species (nitro)cobalt(III) tetraphenylporphyrin generated by dissociation of the pyridine ligand in the hexacoordinate complex. Pentacoordinated (nitro)cobalt(III) tetraphenylporphyrin can oxidize allyl bromide in minutes. This pentacoordinated (nitro)cobalt(III) with enhanced activity is more easily generated using weaker Lewis base pyridines such as 3,5-dichloropyridine. Mechanistic studies indicate that the oxo transfer process involves both radical and nonradical pathways.190 A supramolecular structure in which a manganese porphyrin having two peripheral pyridine rings spontaneously assembles inside a large cavity formed by four zinc porphyrins tied together by chlorotricarbonylrhenium has been reported to act as epoxidation catalyst. 191,192 The system behaves like an artificial enzyme since a catalytically active metalloporphyrin is encapsulated inside a cavity that protects the active center and defines the size and shape of the accessible reagents. The manganese porphyrin increases its lifetime under reaction conditions from 10 min for the same bare complex to more than 3 h upon encapsulation. Pure manganese porphyrin loses its activity after 50 cycles, but the supramolecular structure reaches turnover numbers as high as 21000. The selectivity of the catalyst can be tuned by adding up to two ligands which change the size of the cavity, allowing significant differentiation between substrates.191 These results nicely illustrate how the stability and selectivity of metallo complexes can be increased by incorporation into a well-defined supramolecular structure.The same authors had previously reported that several manganese(III) porphyrins show significantly increased turnover numbers for the catalytic epoxidation of styrene upon addition of zinc and magnesium tetraphenylporphyrins. 193-195 For manganese porphyrin bearing two pyridyl substituents, 24-fold enhancement of the catalytic activity was measured. As in the case commented on earlier for the superstructure of manganese porphyrin encapsulated in the cavity defined by zinc porphyrins, this increase in the catalytic activity was attributed to the formation of a coordination trimer (metal ion other than manganese coordinated to the two peripheral pyridyl groups). This trimer would provide steric protection to the active oxomanganate intermediate avoiding bimolecular decomposition. In agreement with this hypothesis, in the absence of coordinating pyridyl moieties on the manganese porphyrin, less significant enhancement is observed.193 The redox potentials for reversible oxidation to the corresponding oxovanadium(V) cations (0.35 V vs SCE in dichloromethane) and irreversible reduction waves (in the range of 1.9 to 2.1 V vs SCE) have been measured by means of cyclic voltammetry for the oxovanadium(IV) complex of substituted dibenzotetraaza[14]annulene ligands. 196 From a preparative point of view, the oxovanadium(V) complex can also be obtained by oxidation of the oxovanadium(IV) complex with ferricenium hexafluoroantimonate, while unstable anionic oxovanadium(IV) complex was obtained by reducing the complex with sodium/potassium metal alloys.196 Zirconium complexes of chiral aminodithiolate ligands act as catalyst for the enantioselective oxidation of geraniol with TBHP with 46% ee. 197 The same complex exhibits also Lewis acidity in the nitroaldol reaction with modest 30% enantioselectivity.197 The above examples show that transition metal salts and their complexes are Lewis acids that can act as highly active and selective oxidation catalysts through formation of acidbase adducts.
2. Oxidations in Biphasic Fluorous Systems
In the direction of development of catalytic oxidations in which the catalyst can be recovered and reused, one strategy is to use two immiscible liquid phases. An example of this approach is the biphasic fluorous system.
In the biphasic fluorous system, there is a perfluorinated organic solvent such as perfluoroalkanes that is not miscible at ambient temperature with most frequent organic solvents such as alkanes, ethers, or alcohols. 198-205 Upon heating of the sample at the reaction temperature, the system becomes homogeneous since miscibility of the two liquids increases considerably. Once the reaction has taken place, upon cooling the two liquid phases separate again, the catalyst remaining dissolved in the fluorous phase and the nonfluorinated solvent containing the reaction mixture. Scheme 20 summarizes the successive steps in a catalytic reaction based on fluorous system.
Scheme 20 Besides the temperature-dependent miscibility of the two solvents, the key point of this strategy resides in the fact that the catalyst has to be very soluble in the perfluorinated solvent while the products are not. Since perfluorinated liquids are bad solvents (particularly compared with the polychlorinated analogues), the reaction products are generally not soluble in the perfluorinated liquid, but the first condition (exclusive solubility of the catalyst in the fluorous phase) normally requires the adequate functionalization of the catalyst. In this functionalization, a perfluorinated skeleton or perfluorinated tag is introduced in the molecule. This is normally accomplished through extensive and dedicated synthesis of the catalyst. This synthetic work and the limited number of catalysts that are suitable to be modified by introducing fluorinated pony tails constitute the main drawbacks of the biphasic fluorous strategy. In addition, the fluorinated solvents are very expensive and their availability at industrial scale is limited.
Biphasic fluorous systems have been widely used to effect oxidation reactions. Molecular oxygen is the oxidant of choice in most of the reported examples, although ozone can be used equally well. 206,207 This is mainly due to the high solubility of molecular oxygen in perfluorohydrocarbons. This makes oxidation processes in fluorinated solvents very attractive in terms of the use of oxygen as terminal oxidant and the possibility of catalyst recycle. 208 Several oxidation types including epoxidations, alcohol oxidation, and BaeyerVilliger reactions have been carried out in fluorous solvents.
Readily available n-butyl 2,4-di(n-perfluorooctyl)phenyl selenide catalyzes the epoxidation of various olefins with H2O2 in a fluorous biphasic system. 209 The catalyst is selectively soluble in perfluorinated solvents, and can easily be separated, recovered, and reused several times without noticeable decrease in the final yield.209 Alkenes can also be transformed into the corresponding ketones using TBHP in the presence of Pd(II) having perfluorinated ligands using benzene and bromoperfluorooctane as biphasic system. 210 Chiral (salen)manganese(III) complexes have been employed for the asymmetric epoxidation of indene with enantiomeric excesses up to 90%. 211 Compared to the use of oxygen as oxidant on biphasic fluorous systems, it seems that H2O2 or alkyl hydroperoxides are less advantageous.
Pd(OAc)2 catalyzes the aerobic oxidation of alcohols into aldehydes and ketones in the presence of catalytic amounts of novel perfluoralkylated pyridine as ligand in a biphasic fluorous system composed of toluene and perfluorodecalin. 212 The fluorous phase containing the active Pd species is easily separated and can be reused several times without loss of activity. This catalytic system is applicable to benzylic and aliphatic alcohols.212 A catalytic system containing 4,4-bis(perfluorooctyl)-2,2-bipyridine (2 mol %), CuBr2-(CH3)2S (2 mol %) and TEMPO (3.5 mol %) has been also reported to oxidize alcohols to aldehydes and ketones in a biphasic fluorous system of chlorobenzene and perfluorooctane directly with O2. 213 The catalytic mixture can be reused four consecutive runs without observable loss in activity.
Cobalt(II) complexes of perfluorinated porphyrins and phthalocyanines have been used as catalysts for the oxidation of alkyl aryl sulfides with pivaldehyde/O2 in biphasic fluorous systems (Scheme 21). 214 Sulfoxide is preferentially formed, together with variable quantities of sulfone. Cobalt perfluorophthalocyanines were found less efficient in terms of substrate conversion, but afford sulfoxides selectively.214 The recycling of the catalyst was partly ineffectual owing to their partial degradation, particularly in the case of phthalocyanine complexes.
Scheme 21 It is obvious that biphasic fluorous systems are interesting since they allow recycling and reuse of the catalyst. However, the major drawback is the need of dedicated synthetic efforts to make the catalysts soluble in perfluorinated solvents. The use of these expensive fluorinated solvents is also a limitation, particularly for large scale applications.
3. Heteropolyacids as Oxidation Catalysts
Polyoxometalates and heteropolyacids are obtained by the condensation of two or more different types of oxoanions (eq 2). In these compounds, the anion contains a central atom, typically Si or P, tetrahedrically coordinated to oxygens and surrounded by 218 oxygen-linked hexavalent peripheral transition metals. 215-220 These are usually Mo or W, but it can also be others, such as Nb, Ta, U, either single or in combination. The most common structure in catalysis is the Keggin type heteropolyacid (XM12O40)n-, one specific example being the 12-tungstophosphoric acid.
Heteropolyacids are mainly Brnsted acids. Given the large size of the polyanion having a low charge density delocalized through the surface, the interaction between the polyoxometalate anion and the compensating proton is weak and consequently they are strongly acidic. However, the interconversion between two oxidation states of the transition metal atoms or Lewis acid interaction renders these molecules or corresponding anions also oxidation catalysts.
Product distribution (propene or acetone) upon 2-propanol adsorption and FT-IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine has been proposed as a test reaction to titrate the Brnsted and Lewis acid sites of commercial phosphomolybdic acid (Brnsted plus Lewis sites) or n-hexylammonium phosphomolybdate (exclusively Lewis sites) supported on silica. 221 Preferential propene formation over acetone, i.e., larger dehydration selectivity versus dehydrogenation, indicates a stronger surface acidity.
Polyoxometalates and phosphotungstates have been reported to act as catalysts for the direct formation of N-alkylacetamides and alkyl halides from adamantane, cyclohexane, and cyclooctane by reactiving them in acetonitrile or in halogenated solvents, respectively (Scheme 22). 222 It has also been found active to effect the catalytic conversion of highly toxic mustard gas bis(2-chloroethyl)sulfide into the nontoxic sulfoxides using TBHP in the presence of polyoxovanadate as catalyst. 223 Scheme 22 The oxidation of isobutane to methacrolein and methacrylic acid has been carried out over potassium/ammonium salts of phosphomolybdic acid of the Keggin-type with an overall selectivity to the desired products higher than 50%. 224 The presence of iron in the heteropolyacid composition led to a substantial enhancement of the catalytic activity with an increase of the desired products, even though the selectivity decreased.224 Also pyridine treatment at 420 C under N2 flow promotes an enhanced catalytic activity for isobutane and propane oxidation with molecular oxygen to methacrylic and acrylic acids, respectively. 225 The deeper the pyridine treatment is, the higher the oxidation activity and selectivity to partial oxidation products. FTIR reveals that pyridinium ions remain adsorbed in the lattice of heat-treated H3PMo12O40/pyridine, while on the surface Lewis acid sites are created due to oxygen vacancy defects in the Keggin structure.225 On the basis of the above findings, it is proposed that the mechanism of alkane oxidation over H3PMo12O40 involves acidity and electrons to activate O2.
In an attempt to render the catalytic oxidations with polyoxometalates heterogeneous, these compounds have been supported on large surface area inorganic oxides.
Oxidation of propene to acetone has been studied over silica and alumina supported molybdophosphoric acid catalysts at 190 C in the presence of water. 226 This overall process can be taken as the coupling of propene hydration and the oxydehydrogenation of 2-propanol, and, thus, the active catalysts must combine both acid and redox sites.226 FT-Raman characterization of the catalysts shows that molybdophosphoric acid adsorbed on SiO2 retains its Keggin structure while when supported on alumina it decomposes to MoO3. H3PMo12O40/SiO2 showed almost no activity, while MoO3/Al2O3 exhibits fairly good activity despite the stronger acid sites of the former. From this study, it was concluded that the rate-limiting step should be hydrogen abstraction on isopropoxy groups adsorbed on the catalyst surface.226 Heteropolytungstates have been immobilized by anion exchange with quaternary ammonium modified silica 227 and polysiloxane 228 or Amberlite IRA-900 resins.229 Unfortunately, leaching of metal occurs, diminishing the interest of these electrostatically immobilized polyoxometales as heterogeneous oxidation catalysts.
Heteropolyacids having a defect structure incorporating a transition metal can catalyze the oxidation of alkylaromatics with molecular oxygen to aromatic carboxylic acids in acid media.230 Analogously, oxidation of alkylarenes to the corresponding carboxylic acids or aromatic aldehydes by oxygen can be performed using a mixture of heteropolyacid and a transition metal complex dissolved in water.231 Thus, a mixture of ruthenium acetylacetonate and phosphotungstic acid is effective for the oxidation of p-xylene with oxygen (60 kg m2) at 200 C in an autoclave.231 The decomposition of cumene peroxide into phenol and acetone, a process of paramount industrial importance, has been reported to proceed at temperatures between 30 and 60 C in a batchwise procedure over supported heteropolyacid catalysts. The support for this process is a montmorillonite previously activated by H2SO4 treatment or metal ion (Zn, Fe, La, and Ce) impregnation.232 Dodecatungstophosphoric acid exhibits 100% conversion within 5 min at 30 C with complete selectivity. Correlation of the catalytic activity with acidity has revealed that both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites promote efficiently the decomposition.
As it will also be commented on later in the section devoted to permanganate, the pulp and paper industry is one of the industrial processes that consumes higher amounts of oxidants. A method to effect the oxidative degradation of soluble lignin and polysaccharide fragments dissolved during polyoxometalate delignification of pulps and fibers with oxygen has been reported. 233-235 This procedure to degrade oxidatively soluble lignin to volatile organic compounds can be catalyzed by a series of polyoxometalates of different compositions and stoichiometry, an example being H5(PV2Mo10O40).234 It has been found that during the process the polyoxometalate undergoes a one-electron reduction by the electron-rich phenolic residues of lignin, which degrade through a consecutive series of sequential single-electron oxidations, first to cyclohexadienyl radicals and subsequently to cyclohexadienyl cations. The latter cationic intermediates would degrade by lateral chain cleavage. 236 The catalytic cycle is closed upon reoxidation of the reduced polyoxometalate form by oxygen.
Laser excitation of solid catalysts in the near-IR region can stimulate methane partial oxidation. 237 On the solid surface of PW12O403- heteropolyanions, there exist Lewis basic sites located at WO and WOW oxygens as well as Lewis acid sites at W6+ cations. Methane is adsorbed by interacting with the Lewis basic sites, preferentially with WO groups. Laser excitation at 980 cm-1 of the WO groups stimulates the oxidation of methane to methanol at temperatures higher than 100 C. Other byproducts such as formaldehyde, dimethyl ether, and hydrocarbons are secondary products derived from primary methanol.237 As we have seen in the case of polyoxometalates, a widely used methodology to recover the catalyst is support the soluble Lewis acids onto an insoluble solid. In the next section, we will comment in detail on examples of this simple approach in the way towards isotropic (same composition and properties along the whole particle) solid catalysts.
4. Heterogeneized Homogeneous Lewis Acids as Oxidation Catalysts
a.Transition Metals Exchanged or Supported on Solids as Oxidation Catalysts. In many oxidation processes in liquid phase, homogeneous catalysts in the form of oxometallic soluble complexes are used. However, these catalysts may present some limitations derived from the tendency of oxometallic species to oligomerize forming μ-oxo complexes catalytically inactive, and also from the oxidative destruction of the ligands of the complex.
It appears that from the catalyst recovering point of view as well as for increasing the catalyst stability, it would be convenient to isolate and stabilize the metallic species by incorporating them into inorganic matrices and producing heterogeneous solid catalysts for liquid phase oxidations. This can be done by impregnating the active species on inorganic carriers, by anchoring one of the ligands of a transition metal complex on inorganic or organic carrier, by including ship in a bottle the metal complex within the cavities of a micro or mesoporous molecular sieve, by exchanging the Lewis acid in zeolites, and finally by synthesizing molecular sieves with framework Lewis acids able to carry out oxidation reactions.
Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates whose lattice consists of a network of SiO44- and AlO45- tetrahedra with Si or Al atoms at the centers and oxygen atoms in each corner. 238-242 The tetrahedra share the corners or edges; thus, the number of oxygens is twice that of Si plus Al atoms. In contrast to amorphous silica or silicaalumina, which lack long-range ordering, zeolites are crystalline; their tetrahedra are spatially arranged in strictly regular fashion.
A network of SiO44- tetrahedra is neutral; each AlO45- tetrahedron introduces one negative charge in the lattice. The negative charges are balanced by an appropriate number of cations, usually mono- or dipositive, inorganic or organic. Typical cations include alkali metal and quaternary ammonium ions. Since the chemical bonds between the crystalline framework and the cations are ionic, it is possible to exchange the cations partially or completely for different ones without modification of the rigid lattice. 243 The cations occupy empty space within the zeolites, in close proximity to the negative charges.
Concerning the chemical composition of the framework, the most important parameter is the Si/Al ratio. It may vary from Si/Al = 1 (faujasite X) to Si/Al =  (silicalite). The Al or any other TIII atom content of the silicate determines the number of cations in the framework, as well as other properties such as the thermal and chemical stability or the polarity of the internal surfaces. Typically, zeolites with a high Al content (X zeolite) are thermally and chemically less stable. In such cases, dehydration at high temperature may cause partial dealumination by the water being desorbed with a decrease of crystallinity (self-steaming). 244 The chemical composition of synthetic zeolites can be controlled at two different stages: during the synthesis by varying the composition of the gels, or by postsynthetic modifications of as-synthesized samples.
Concerning the crystal structure of zeolites, the long-range ordering of the primary tetrahedra defines nondeformable channels and cavities of strictly uniform dimensions on the molecular scale (nanometer dimensions). 245,246 This porosity explains why the surface area per unit weight of zeolites is among the highest for any solid. The total surface area of zeolites is the sum of the external and internal surfaces.
Brnsted acid sites in zeolites are due to hydroxyl groups bridging a Si and Al atom. 247-249 The H+ forms of zeolites can be prepared from alkali ion containing forms by ion exchange with concentrated hydrochloric acid at elevated temperatures. This procedure usually results in partial dealumination, causing damage to the crystalline structure. A milder dealumination method implies the exchange of alkali ions by NH4+, and subsequent thermal decomposition eliminates NH3, leaving H+ in the framework. Likewise, calcination of as-synthesized zeolites containing quaternary ammonium ions generates a proton in the lattice. The protons of acidic zeolites are not free, but covalently bonded to the oxygen closest to a negatively charged aluminum, forming oxonium species. The bridging Si(OH)-Al hydroxy groups can be monitored by IR spectroscopy.
Zeolites may contain Lewis sites in addition to Brnsted sites.247 These sites can be attributed to tricoordinated or partially dislodged Al centers. However, this type of Al has resisted detection by 27Al MAS NMR. On the other hand, samples exhibiting Lewis acidity have octahedrally coordinated Al extraframework species, and these extraframework Al species (EFAL) show Lewis acidity. EFAL centers are generated during steaming or calcination of hydrated zeolites, especially of the NH4+ or H+ forms. EFAL not only generates Lewis sites, but also reduces the population of Brnsted centers. Two types of EFALs can be distinguished. Mild steaming conditions favor low-weight oligomers of cationic polyoxoaluminate EFAL species, which can be removed by treatment with oxalic acid or (NH4)2SiF6,240 whereas more drastic steaming conditions lead to highly condensed (polymeric) EFAL, that cannot be dissolved by (NH4)2SiF6.
Finally, the interaction with EFAL Lewis sites is expected to enhance the strength of Brnsted sites also present. 250,251 The enhancement of Brnsted acidity by Lewis sites has also been invoked in other cases to explain the superacidity of sulfated zirconia and related transition metal superacidic oxides.250,251 In the case of zeolites, transition metal elements can be introduced in different structures, different oxidation states, and coordinations, either as extraframework exchanged cations, supported metal clusters, supported metal oxides, complexes or as lattice cations. These transition metals present in the composition of the zeolite will be responsible for the activity of the zeolite as catalysts in oxidation reactions.
For instance, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ ion exchanged X zeolite is able to oxidize n-hexane with O2 in liquid phase to yield 70 to 80% selectivity to acetic acid. The fact that the rate of formation of acetic acid is the same for the metal exchanged zeolites than for the homogeneous reaction with those metals, may indicate not only that the metals leach out of the zeolite but also that the leached metals play a determinant role in the observed activity.
Methane is an abundant hydrocarbon, and new processes to effect its partial oxidation are desirable. In this context, it has been found that water has a detrimental influence on the activity of In/HZSM-5 zeolite as catalyst for the selective oxidation of methane by nitric oxide. Apparently, water interacts with the Lewis acid sites of the zeolite and retards the transformation of NO into NO2 an elementary step in the oxidation of methane by NO. 252 The co-incorporation of Pt, Rh, or Ir to the In/HZSM-5 zeolite renders the catalyst more tolerant to the presence of water vapor.
Chromium oxide supported on mesoporous MCM-41 as well as Zr- or La-doped silica has been found to be an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane at temperatures between 350 and 550 C. The partial substitution of Cr(III) ions by Al(III) increases the Brnsted and Lewis acidity and favors the selectivity to propene. 253 On the other hand, substitution of Cr(III) by Ga increases the number of Lewis acid sites and the oxidizing power of the solid.253 Ethylene and propylene have been oxidized using transition metals on zeolites. For instance, ethylene is selectively oxidized to ethylene oxide on Ag+ impregnated on zeolites, but selectivity is low on Ag+ exchanged zeolites. 254 Propylene dissolved in benzene was oxidized with O2 at 150 C and 45 bar on molybdenum impregnated X zeolite with high selectivities to the epoxide. However, for conversions above 5% further oxidation of the epoxide occurs with formation of methanol, formic and acetic acid as well as esters of the epoxide and the above acids. 255 Propylene can be oxidized to acetone by Mo or Pd/Cu exchanged Y zeolites. 256-260 With the Pd/Cu catalyst the active component for olefin oxidation is Pd2+, and Cu2+ is used as a promoter for the reoxidation of Pd0.
