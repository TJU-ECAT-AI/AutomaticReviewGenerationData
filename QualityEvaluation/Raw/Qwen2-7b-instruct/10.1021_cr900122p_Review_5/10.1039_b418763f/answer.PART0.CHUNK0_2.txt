[1] "The perturbation induced on the n(OH) modes of the Brnsted sites by the interaction with basic molecules is analogous to that observed for the same interactions in homo- geneous conditions. This has allowed to adapt the BHW method (well established in solution) to intrinsically inhomo- geneous systems such as zeolitic materials."
[2] "Comparison with the immense literature concerning the IR spectra of acidbase adducts in solution, has also allowed to estimate the relative role played by the local structure and by the shape of the cages in determining the acid strength of Brnsted sites."
[3] "The acid base perturbation is not only influencing the vibrational modes of the adsorbing sites but is also influencing the internal modes of the basic probes."
[4] "From this perturbation a second spectro- scopic method for acid strength evaluation has been obtained which is particularly useful for Lewis sites either present on internal surfaces of cavities or on external positions."

Analyzing the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both the two-site and one-site schemes. The process typically starts with the formation of alkenes through the cleavage of alkane bonds. These alkenes then rearrange via a concerted mechanism, often involving the formation of metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. The catalyst performance and selectivity in alkane conversions are influenced by the formation and role of these intermediates, as well as the specific conditions and interactions within the catalyst structure.

分析由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的机制涉及理解两个位点和一个位点的方案。过程通常从通过断裂烷烃键形成烯烃开始。这些烯烃随后通过协同机制重新排列，通常涉及形成金属环丁烷作为关键中间体。催化剂性能和各种烷烃转化的选择性受这些中间体的形成及其在催化剂结构中的作用的影响。
