The vibrational spectroscopy, particularly infrared (IR) spectroscopy, is a powerful tool for evaluating the Lewis and Brnsted acidity of microporous materials such as zeolites, heteropolyacids, and sulfonated polymers. The method involves measuring the perturbation of the OH modes of Brnsted sites and the internal modes of the probe molecule caused by the interaction with basic molecules. This perturbation mirrors the behavior observed in homogeneous solutions, allowing researchers to adapt the Bellamy-Hallam-Williams (BHW) method to study acidity in inherently heterogeneous systems. The shape of the cages within these materials influences the acidity, and the role of the local structure is also assessed through comparison with literature on homogeneous acid-base adducts. Hydrogen molecules, in particular, play a crucial role as probes for acidity due to their unique spectroscopic responses. Spectroscopic methods have been successfully applied to evaluate acidity in dynamic systems like heteropolyacids and NAFION membranes, demonstrating their utility across a wide range of acidic materials.

红外光谱（IR）是评估微孔材料如沸石、多酸和磺化聚合物的路易斯和布内斯特酸性的强大工具。这种方法通过测量与碱性分子交互作用时Brnsted位点的OH模式和探针分子内部模式的扰动来工作。这种扰动在均相条件下观察到的行为类似，允许研究者将Bellamy-Hallam-Williams（BHW）方法应用于研究在本质上异质系统的酸性。这些材料中的笼形结构的形状影响了酸性，并且通过与溶液中均相酸基络合物的文献比较，评估了局部结构的作用。氢分子在作为酸性探针方面特别重要，因为它们具有独特的光谱响应特性。在动态系统如多酸和NAFION膜上，光谱方法的成功应用表明其在广泛酸性材料上的实用性。
