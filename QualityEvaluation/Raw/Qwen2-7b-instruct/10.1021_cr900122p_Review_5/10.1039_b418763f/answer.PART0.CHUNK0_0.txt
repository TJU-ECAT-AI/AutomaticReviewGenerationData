[1] "The data presented in this review show that the vibrational spectroscopy of simple basic molecules adsorbed on Brnsted and Lewis sites gives an invaluable help for the evaluation of the acid strength of sites located on internal and external surfaces of zeolitic systems and oxides."

[2] "The perturbation induced on the n(OH) modes of the Brnsted sites by the interaction with basic molecules is analogous to that observed for the same interactions in homo- geneous conditions."

[3] "The acid base perturbation is not only influencing the vibrational modes of the adsorbing sites but is also influencing the internal modes of the basic probes."

[4] "From this perturbation a second spectro- scopic method for acid strength evaluation has been obtained which is particularly useful for Lewis sites either present on internal surfaces of cavities or on external positions."

[5] "The great importance of IR spectroscopy of hydrogen molecule used as probe of acidity is also emerging clearly from this review."
