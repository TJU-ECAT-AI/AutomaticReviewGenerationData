<p>The data presented in this review show that the vibrational spectroscopy of simple basic molecules adsorbed on Brnsted and Lewis sites gives an invaluable help for the evaluation of the acid strength of sites located on internal and external surfaces of zeolitic systems and oxides.</p>
<p>The perturbation induced on the n(OH) modes of the Brnsted sites by the interaction with basic molecules is analogous to that observed for the same interactions in homo- geneous conditions. This has allowed to adapt the BHW method (well established in solution) to intrinsically inhomo- geneous systems such as zeolitic materials. Comparison with the immense literature concerning the IR spectra of acidbase adducts in solution, has also allowed to estimate the relative role played by the local structure and by the shape of the cages in determining the acid strength of Brnsted sites.</p>
<p>The acid base perturbation is not only influencing the vibrational modes of the adsorbing sites but is also influencing the internal modes of the basic probes. From this perturbation a second spectro- scopic method for acid strength evaluation has been obtained which is particularly useful for Lewis sites either present on internal surfaces of cavities or on external positions.</p>
<p>The great importance of IR spectroscopy of hydrogen molecule used as probe of acidity is also emerging clearly from this review.</p>
<p>The utility of the spectroscopic methods for the acid strength evaluation have also been tested and proved for fluxional acidic systems such as heteropolyacids and NAFION mem- branes.</p>

The vibrational spectroscopy of simple basic molecules adsorbed on Brnsted and Lewis sites aids in the evaluation of acid strength on zeolitic and oxide surfaces. This adaptation of the BHW method allows for the assessment of acid strength in heterogeneous systems like zeolites, with comparisons to solution-based literature providing insights into the role of local structure and cage shape on Brnsted site acidity. The perturbation affects both adsorbing sites' vibrational modes and the internal modes of basic probes, leading to a second spectroscopic method for acid strength evaluation, particularly for Lewis sites on internal or external surfaces. The significance of hydrogen molecule IR spectroscopy in acidity assessment is highlighted, and these methods have been validated in fluxional acidic systems such as heteropolyacids and NAFION membranes.

本文综述显示，简单碱性分子在Brnsted和Lewis位点的振动光谱学为评估位于沸石体系和氧化物表面的酸强度提供了宝贵帮助。通过将BHW方法适应于异质系统（如沸石），可以评估在溶液中已建立的方法。与溶液中酸碱络合物的红外光谱文献进行比较，提供了关于局部结构和笼形对Brnsted位点酸度作用的见解。这种扰动不仅影响吸附位点的振动模式，还影响基本探针的内部模式，导致了评估酸强度的第二种光谱方法，特别是对于内表面或外部位置的Lewis位点。氢分子的红外光谱学在酸度评估中的重要性从本文综述中明显显现出来，这些方法在多变酸性体系（如杂多酸和NAFION膜）上得到了测试和证实。
