The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, the catalyst enables the exchange of alkyl groups between two alkane molecules. In the one-site mechanism, the catalyst activates an alkane molecule, leading to the formation of an alkene and a metallacyclobutane intermediate in a concerted reaction. Linear alkane conversions predominantly follow the one-site mechanism, while cyclic alkane transformations are more suited to the two-site mechanism. Key intermediates in the reaction include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which are essential for the metathesis process. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions are affected by factors such as catalyst loading, reaction temperature, and substrate nature. The use of silica-supported tantalum hydrides offers advantages in terms of stability and recyclability, contributing to efficient alkane metathesis reactions.

烷烃互变异构催化由硅负载钽氢化物，涉及两种位点机制和单一位点机制。在双位点机制中，催化剂促进两个烷烃分子之间的烷基团交换。在单一位点机制中，催化剂激活一个烷烃分子，形成一个烯烃和一个金属环丁烷中间体，在协调反应中。线性烷烃转化通常遵循单一位点机制，而环烷烃转化更适合双位点机制。反应的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，对于促进互变异构过程至关重要。催化剂在烷烃转化中的选择性和性能受到催化剂负载、反应温度和烷烃底物性质等因素的影响。使用硅负载钽氢化物提供了稳定性与可回收性的优势，有助于高效的烷烃互变异构反应。
