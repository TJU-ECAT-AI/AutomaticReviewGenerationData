[1] "The presence of surface-generated gas-phase radicals is now well established for many catalytic decomposition and oxidation reactions."
[2] "The radicals generally are observed at reaction temperatures in excess of 4WC, and in some cases temperatures of approximately 800C are required."
[3] "The surface-generated radicals may be significant as (1) initiators of chain reactions, (2) intermediates in gas-phase coupling reactions, (3) a means for the transport of intermediates from one surface to another, (4) experimental evidence for a radical mechanism, and (5) a means of determining the rate-limiting step of a catalytic cycle."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, a linear alkane is converted into a cyclic alkane, and vice versa. This process involves the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. In the one-site scheme, a linear alkane is transformed into another linear alkane of different length through the breaking and forming of alkyl chains. The formation of these intermediates, especially the alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, plays a crucial role in determining the reaction selectivity and the performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. The role of these intermediates and the pathways they take contribute to the high efficiency and selectivity of the metathesis reactions.

催化二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的全面机制涉及两种位点和单一位点方案。在双位点方案中，线性烷烃转化为环烷烃，反之亦然。这个过程涉及到烯烃和金属环丁烷等关键中间体的形成。在单位点方案中，线性烷烃转化为不同长度的另一条线性烷烃，通过断裂和形成碳链实现。这些中间体的形成，特别是烯烃和金属环丁烷的作用，在各种烷烃转换中决定着反应的选择性和催化剂的性能。这些中间体的作用及其转化途径对裂合反应的高效率和选择性起着重要作用。
