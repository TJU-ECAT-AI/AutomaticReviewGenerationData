[1] "The presence of surface-generated gas-phase radicals is now well es- tablished for many catalytic decomposition and oxidation reactions."
[2] "The radicals generally are observed at reaction temperatures in excess of 4WC, and in some cases temperatures of approximately 800C are required."
[3] "The surface-generated radicals may be significant as (1) initiators of chain reactions, (2) intermediates in gas-phase coupling reactions, (3) a means for the transport of intermediates from one surface to another, (4) experimental evidence for a radical mechanism, and (5) a means of determining the rate- limiting step of a catalytic cycle."
[4] "Clearly, development of processes involving these gas-phase radicals will be based upon the fundamentals of catalytic chemistry, traditional chemical kinetics, and reactor engineering."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes, depending on whether linear or cyclic alkane transformations are considered. Key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the reaction pathways. 

During linear alkane transformations, the mechanism might proceed through a two-site scheme, where the metathesis reaction takes place between two different alkyl groups. This process is facilitated by the silica-supported tantalum hydrides acting as effective catalysts. The formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as intermediates suggests a dynamic rearrangement of alkyl groups under the influence of the catalyst.

For cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism might involve a one-site scheme, where the metathesis reaction takes place within the same alkyl group. This process leads to the formation of new alkyl chains, often resulting in the creation of more complex cyclic structures. The selectivity of the catalyst in these transformations depends on the stability of the intermediates and the overall reaction conditions.

The formation and role of these key intermediates contribute significantly to the reaction selectivity and the performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. Catalysts like silica-supported tantalum hydrides enable the efficient and controlled rearrangement of alkyl groups, leading to the formation of desired products.

The development of processes involving these gas-phase radicals will rely on the principles of catalytic chemistry, traditional chemical kinetics, and reactor engineering to optimize the reaction conditions, selectivities, and product yields. This includes understanding the reaction pathways, the stability of intermediates, and the role of the catalyst in facilitating these transformations efficiently.
