Spatial heterogeneities in catalytic solids refer to the variations in the properties of catalyst materials across different lengths and timescales. These variations occur due to the complex porous structures of catalysts, which contain numerous potential active sites. Understanding these heterogeneities is crucial for the rational design of more efficient and selective catalysts, as they affect the macroscopic properties such as activity, selectivity, porosity, adsorption, degree of reduction, and spectroscopic signatures. Spatiotemporal phenomena, which are more common in heterogeneous catalysts, result from the strong influence of the local environment on these properties. This leads to spatial heterogeneities or reaction fronts that are not captured by point measurements. Knowledge of these spatial gradients is essential for the development of more sustainable catalytic processes and for designing catalysts with improved performance.

催化固体中的空间异质性指的是催化剂材料在不同长度和时间尺度上的性质变化。这些变化由于催化剂复杂的多孔结构而发生，该结构包含许多潜在的活性位点。理解这些异质性对于合理设计更高效、选择性更强的催化剂至关重要，因为它们影响宏观性质，如活性、选择性、孔隙率、吸附、还原度和光谱特征签名。在异质催化剂中，常见的空间和时间现象是由局部环境对这些属性的强烈影响导致的。这导致了空间异质性或反应前沿的出现，这些现象不会被点测量捕捉到。了解这些空间梯度对于发展更可持续的催化过程以及设计性能更好的催化剂至关重要。
