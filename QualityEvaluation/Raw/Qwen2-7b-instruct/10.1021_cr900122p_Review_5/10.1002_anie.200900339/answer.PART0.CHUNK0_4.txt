[1] "Heterogeneous catalysts are the workhorses of chemical industry, and more than 80% of all chemicals have come into contact with at least one catalyst material during their manufacturing process."
[2] "Determining the nature of these active sites and elucidating their reaction mechanisms are important intellectual challenges that are of paramount importance for the rational design of heterogeneous catalysts."
[3] "However, these macroscopically determined properties are not necessarily identical across the entire reactor bed or within a catalyst grain. Spatiotemporal phenomena are more the rule than the exception for heterogeneous catalysts, as the local environment strongly affects the above-mentioned macroscopic properties."
[4] "Knowledge of spatiotemporal gradients in heterogeneous catalysts is of paramount importance for the rational design of new and more sustainable catalytic processes."
[5] "This Review documents the recent advances in the development of space- and time-resolved spectroscopic methods for imaging spatial heterogeneities within catalytic processes at these four length scales."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding both two-site and one-site schemes. Two-site schemes typically involve the formation of alkenes through the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds followed by the reformation of new bonds, leading to the transformation of linear and cyclic alkane structures. One-site schemes may involve the formation of metallacyclobutanes, which play a crucial role in the transformation of cyclic alkane structures. Key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, are pivotal in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The specific contributions of these factors to various alkane conversions depend on the detailed chemistry and the operational conditions of the catalytic system.
