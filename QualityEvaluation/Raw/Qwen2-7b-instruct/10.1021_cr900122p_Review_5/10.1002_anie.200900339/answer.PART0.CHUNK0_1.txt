[1] "Spatial heterogeneities resulting in space- and time-dependent phenomena occur at different length scales; that is, at the level of catalytic reactors (mm to m), catalyst bodies (mm to mm), catalyst grains (nm to mm), and active sites and metal (oxide) particles ( to nm)."
[2] "This Review documents the recent advances in the development of space- and time-resolved spectroscopic methods for imaging spatial heterogeneities within catalytic processes at these four length scales."
[3] "Particular emphasis will be on the use of magnetic resonance, optical, and synchrotron-based methods, their capabilities in providing spatial resolution (1D and 2D imaging) and depth profiling (3D imaging) as well as on their time-resolved application, potential for single-molecule and nanoparticle detection, and use under reaction conditions."

Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves understanding the spatial heterogeneities and temporal dynamics at various scales within catalytic processes. The silica-supported tantalum hydrides offer a unique platform for alkane conversion due to their ability to induce both two-site and one-site catalytic reactions. These mechanisms involve the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes into alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, respectively. The key intermediates play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in alkane conversions.
