[1] "Spatial heterogeneities resulting in space- and time-dependent phenomena occur at different length scales; that is, at the level of catalytic reactors (mm to m), catalyst bodies (mm to mm), catalyst grains (nm to mm), and active sites and metal (oxide) particles (to nm)."
[2] "This Review documents the recent advances in the development of space- and time-resolved spectroscopic methods for imaging spatial heterogeneities within catalytic processes at these four length scales."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes, as well as the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes. Key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, play crucial roles in the reaction processes. These factors significantly contribute to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.
