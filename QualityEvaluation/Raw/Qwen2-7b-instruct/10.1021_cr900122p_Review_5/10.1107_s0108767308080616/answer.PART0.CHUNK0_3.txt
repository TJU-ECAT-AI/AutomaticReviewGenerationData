The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides encompasses both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, the catalyst enables the exchange of alkyl groups between distinct alkane molecules. Conversely, the one-site scheme allows for the rearrangement of alkyl groups within a single alkane molecule. Linear alkane transformations involve the breaking and reformation of C-C bonds, resulting in the production of alkenes. Cyclic alkane transformations typically proceed through the formation of metallacyclobutanes as an intermediate, which subsequently leads to the formation of alkenes. Key intermediates, including alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, significantly impact the selectivity and efficiency of alkane conversions. The performance of the catalyst is determined by several factors, such as the structure of the silica support, the characteristics of the tantalum hydride, and the reaction conditions.

催化作用下由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃裂合的全面机制包括双位点和单位点方案。在双位点方案中，催化剂使不同烷烃分子之间的烷基团交换。相反，在单位点方案中，催化剂允许单个烷烃分子内烷基团的重新排列。线性烷烃转换涉及C-C键的断裂和重组，导致烯烃的产生。环烷烃转换通常通过形成金属环丁烷作为中间步骤，随后形成烯烃。关键中间体，包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，显著影响烷烃转换的选择性和效率。催化剂的性能由几个因素决定，如二氧化硅支撑结构、钽氢化物的特性以及反应条件。
