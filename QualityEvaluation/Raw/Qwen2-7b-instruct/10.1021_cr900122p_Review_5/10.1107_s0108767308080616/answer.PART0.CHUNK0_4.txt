Analyzing the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides reveals two primary schemes: two-site and one-site. In the two-site scheme, a hydride ion transfers between different alkyl groups, generating two new alkyl groups. Conversely, the one-site scheme sees a hydride ion move within the same alkyl group, creating an alkene intermediate. Linear alkane transformations entail the rearrangement of carbon atoms along the alkane chain, whereas cyclic alkane transformations result in the formation of a ring structure. Key intermediates in this process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which significantly influence the catalytic mechanism. The selectivity of the reactions is determined by the catalyst's nature, the reaction conditions, and the alkane substrates utilized. Catalyst performance in alkane conversions is evaluated based on its activity, stability, and efficiency in producing desired products.

在由硅负载的钽氢化物催化下进行的烷烃裂合的全面机制分析揭示了两种主要方案：两站点和单站点。在两站点方案中，一个氢离子在不同的烷基团之间转移，产生两个新的烷基团。相反，在单站点方案中，一个氢离子在同一个烷基团内移动，形成一个烯烃中间体。线性烷烃转换涉及沿着烷烃链重组碳原子，而环烷烃转换则导致形成环结构。这一过程的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们对催化机制有重要影响。反应的选择性取决于催化剂的性质、反应条件以及所使用的烷烃底物。催化剂在烷烃转化中的性能评估基于其活性、稳定性和产生所需产品的效率。
