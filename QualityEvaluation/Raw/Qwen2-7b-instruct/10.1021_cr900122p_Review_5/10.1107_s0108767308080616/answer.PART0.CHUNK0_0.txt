The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides encompasses both two-site and one-site schemes. Linear alkane transformation typically proceeds through an interaction with a metal center resulting in the formation of an alkene. Cyclic alkane transformations often require the creation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate. Key intermediates in these reactions consist of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The catalyst's performance and selectivity in alkane conversions are affected by variables including temperature, pressure, and the type of alkane substrate.
