The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context of this document, the focus is on the dehydrogenation of alkanes over chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. The document does not provide specific details on the metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. 

Linear alkane transformations involve the cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond to form an alkene, while cyclic alkane transformations can lead to the formation of metallacyclobutanes through a series of reactions including the insertion of hydrogen into the ring. Key intermediates in these processes include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by factors such as the structure and composition of the catalyst, the conditions under which the reactions take place, and the nature of the reactants.

The formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes is a result of the interaction between the alkane substrate and the catalyst surface. The specific pathways for these transformations depend on the catalyst type, the alkane structure, and the reaction conditions. Catalyst performance is optimized through the precise control of these parameters to achieve desired product distributions and yield.

However, the document does not delve into the mechanisms or the performance of silica-supported tantalum hydrides in alkane metathesis reactions. It focuses on the dehydrogenation of alkanes over chromium oxide catalysts, providing insights into the structure of the catalyst, the formation of surface species, and the effects of preparation and treatment conditions on the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, linear alkane molecules undergo a concerted process where a hydride group migrates from one carbon to form a double bond, creating a metallacyclobutane intermediate. Simultaneously, the original carbon gains a hydride group to form a second double bond. In the one-site scheme, a single site catalyzes the formation of a double bond, resulting in a linear alkene product. Key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in determining the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. The selectivity is influenced by the stability of these intermediates and the ease of their transformation into final products. The catalyst's performance is also affected by the regeneration ability to maintain the active sites, which are crucial for efficient alkane metathesis reactions.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, two distinct sites on the catalyst surface interact with alkane molecules, leading to the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. In the one-site scheme, a single active site facilitates the transformation of alkane molecules into various intermediates. Key intermediates in this process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and efficiency. The catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as the specific interaction between the catalyst and alkane molecules, the stability of the active sites, and the ability of the catalyst to suppress unwanted side reactions like thermal cracking. The formation of these intermediates and their subsequent transformations contribute significantly to the overall selectivity and efficiency of the alkane metathesis reactions.

The dehydrogenation of alkanes over supported chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3/Al2O3, is crucial for industrial production of propene and isobutene. Detailed information on the dehydrogenation site can be obtained through advanced spectroscopic tools. These catalysts enable selective conversion of alkanes into alkenes at high temperatures, while suppressing unwanted thermal cracking reactions. The dehydrogenation process is endothermic and requires high temperatures and low pressures for significant yield. Suitable catalysts must exhibit high activity and selectivity, effectively preventing the formation of lighter alkanes and coke.

Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes. Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective. Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke. As a consequence, suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions.

Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke, the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice. The main result concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s are summarized in review papers by Poole and Mclver, and by Kearby. Subsequently, numerous papers have been published in the literature on CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts.

Dehydrogenation reactions are rather unselective, because all equivalent CH bonds have an equal bonding energy, and therefore an equal chance of reacting. When two CH bonds of neighboring carbons are split, a double bond is formed and alkanes are converted to alkenes. However, when the two CH bonds belong to non-neighboring carbon atoms, dehydrocyclization and possibly also aromatization may occur.

Thermodynamics show that aromatization equilibria overtake dehydrogenation equilibria at higher temperatures. Thus, n-hexane is primarily converted to benzene, whereas toluene can be made from n-heptane. If the two CH bonds are part of two different alkane molecules, higher molecular-weight hydrocarbons are formed, and extensive CH bond breaking and CC bond formation may lead to hydrogen gas and coke.

Commercial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically composed of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support including dopants to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity. The Cr loading is mostly around 13 wt% Cr, but dehydrogenation activity has been observed in the entire range between 0 and 20 wt% Cr. Although alumina with a surface area of 50300 m2/g is the preferred support for industrial applications, other supports such as zirconia, silica, and magnesium oxide have also been studied in great detail.

Numerous papers have been published in the literature regarding the characterization of chromium oxides supported on different inorganic oxides, and much research has dealt with the use of specific spectroscopic techniques, such as electron spin resonance (ESR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and Raman spectroscopy (RS).

In situ characterization studies have been conducted using techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the UVVis region to monitor surface Cr-species during alkane dehydrogenations. In situ Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the reduction process of surface Cr6 species on a 5 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst in the presence of n-butane. It was concluded that polychromate was more readily reducible than monochromate. However, above 350°C the in situ Raman spectra became less informative due to coke formation.

In situ DRS spectroscopy studies on 0.18.0 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalysts show that surface Cr6 species are reduced at high temperature in the presence of n-butane or isobutane to mainly pseudo-octahedral Cr3. Thus, surface Cr3 species are formed under reaction conditions at the expense of Cr6. The nature of these surface Cr3 species was further unraveled by infrared spectroscopy measurements of adsorbed probe molecules (CO/NO). De Rossi et al. concluded that isolated Cr3 sites with two coordinative vacancies are formed on 0.161.55 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of n-propane.

The industrial cycling of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts under oxidizing and reducing conditions strongly affects their physicochemical structure, and ultimately leads to catalyst deactivation. The specific surface area of the catalyst decreases with increasing time-on-stream, increasing reaction temperature, and increasing number of catalytic cycles. In addition, the amount of surface Cr6 decreased with increasing number of cycles.

Similar results were obtained by De Rossi et al., who observed that the extent of reduction (as determined from the amount of H2 or CO consumed by their Cr/Al2O3 catalysts) decreases with increasing number of reduction-dehydrogenation recalcination cycles. This decrease has been attributed to an incomplete reoxidation of reduced Cr3 species.
