Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes. Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective. Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke. As a consequence, suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions. Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke, the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice.

The dehydrogenation of alkanes over supported chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3/Al2O3, is crucial for industrial production of propene and isobutene. Detailed information on the dehydrogenation site can be obtained through advanced spectroscopic tools. These catalysts enable selective conversion of alkanes into alkenes at high temperatures, while suppressing unwanted thermal cracking reactions. The dehydrogenation process is endothermic and requires high temperatures and low pressures for significant yield. Suitable catalysts must exhibit high activity and selectivity, effectively preventing the formation of lighter alkanes and coke.
