[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes has a considerable industrial impact, because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons [1]."
[2] "It will be shown that detailed information on the dehydrogenation site can be obtained by using advanced spectroscopic tools."
[3] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain significant yields of alkenes [3]."
[4] "Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke."
[5] "Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective."
[6] "The main result concerning Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts until the late 1960s are summarized in review papers by Poole and Mclver [6], and by Kearby [7]."
[7] "The initial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalyst of Frey and Huppke was prepared by coprecipitation of aluminium and chromium nitrates with ammonium hydroxide, but numerous modified preparation procedures have since been developed [6,7]."
[8] "In situ Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the reduction process of surface Cr6 species on a 5 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst in the presence of n-butane."
[9] "It was concluded that polychromate was more readily reducible than monochromate [32]."
[10] "In situ DRS spectroscopy studies on 0.18.0 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalysts show that surface Cr6 species are reduced at high temperature in the presence of n-butane or isobutane to mainly pseudo-octahedral Cr3 [5759]."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the context of this document, the focus is on the dehydrogenation of alkanes over chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. The document does not provide specific details on the metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. 

Linear alkane transformations involve the cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond to form an alkene, while cyclic alkane transformations can lead to the formation of metallacyclobutanes through a series of reactions including the insertion of hydrogen into the ring. Key intermediates in these processes include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. Reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by factors such as the structure and composition of the catalyst, the conditions under which the reactions take place, and the nature of the reactants.

The formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes is a result of the interaction between the alkane substrate and the catalyst surface. The specific pathways for these transformations depend on the catalyst type, the alkane structure, and the reaction conditions. Catalyst performance is optimized through the precise control of these parameters to achieve desired product distributions and yield.

However, the document does not delve into the mechanisms or the performance of silica-supported tantalum hydrides in alkane metathesis reactions. It focuses on the dehydrogenation of alkanes over chromium oxide catalysts, providing insights into the structure of the catalyst, the formation of surface species, and the effects of preparation and treatment conditions on the catalyst's activity and selectivity.
