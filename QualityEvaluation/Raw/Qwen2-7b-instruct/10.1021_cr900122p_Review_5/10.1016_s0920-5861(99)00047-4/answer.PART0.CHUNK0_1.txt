The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, linear alkane molecules undergo a concerted process where a hydride group migrates from one carbon to form a double bond, creating a metallacyclobutane intermediate. Simultaneously, the original carbon gains a hydride group to form a second double bond. In the one-site scheme, a single site catalyzes the formation of a double bond, resulting in a linear alkene product. Key intermediates include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in determining the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions. The selectivity is influenced by the stability of these intermediates and the ease of their transformation into final products. The catalyst's performance is also affected by the regeneration ability to maintain the active sites, which are crucial for efficient alkane metathesis reactions.

烷烃裂合由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的全面机制涉及两种位点和单一位点方案。在两个位点方案中，线性烷烃分子经历一个协同过程，其中氢化物团从一个碳原子迁移形成双键，产生金属环丁烷中间体。同时，原来的碳获得一个氢化物团形成第二个双键。在单一位点方案中，单个位点催化形成双键，导致线性烯烃产物。关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们在确定各种烷烃转化的选择性和催化剂性能中起着至关重要的作用。选择性受这些中间体的稳定性及其向最终产品的转换的容易程度的影响。催化剂的性能也受到维持活性位点再生能力的影响，这些活性位点对于有效的烷烃裂合反应至关重要。
