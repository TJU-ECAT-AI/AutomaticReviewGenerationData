[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes has a considerable industrial impact, because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons [1]."
[2] "Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective."
[3] "Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke."
[4] "As a consequence, suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions."
[5] "Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke [4,5], the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice."
[6] "In this respect, zirconia has some advantages over alumina,because of its high thermal stability and low surface acidity."
[7] "It was concluded that polychromate was more readily reducible than monochromate [32]."
[8] "In situ DRS spectroscopy studies on 0.18.0 wt% Cr/Al2O3 catalysts show that surface Cr6 species are reduced at high temperature in the presence of n-butane or isobutane to mainly pseudo-octahedral Cr3 [5759]."

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, two distinct sites on the catalyst surface interact with alkane molecules, leading to the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. In the one-site scheme, a single active site facilitates the transformation of alkane molecules into various intermediates. Key intermediates in this process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and efficiency. The catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is influenced by factors such as the specific interaction between the catalyst and alkane molecules, the stability of the active sites, and the ability of the catalyst to suppress unwanted side reactions like thermal cracking. The formation of these intermediates and their subsequent transformations contribute significantly to the overall selectivity and efficiency of the alkane metathesis reactions.
