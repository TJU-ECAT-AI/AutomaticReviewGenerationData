[1] "Global propylene demand trends remain strong, and with the change toward lighter feedstocks in modern steam crackers there will be a growing dependence on the FCC to balance the supply side of the propylene equation."
[2] "Some of the technologies described in this review are those that have been taken to the commercial stage such as DCC and HSFCC, and are by no means an exhaustive list because there is a rising interest and ongoing research in applying special reactors and catalysts to control the yield of olefins and improve energy efficiency."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as modern steam crackers increasingly rely on lighter feedstocks. This shift has emphasized the importance of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) technology in balancing the supply of propylene. Technologies like Deep Catalytic Cracking (DCC) and High Severity Fluid Catalytic Cracking (HSFCC) have been commercialized, and ongoing research aims to optimize the yield of olefins and enhance energy efficiency through the use of specialized reactors and catalysts.
