[1] "Global propylene demand trends remain strong, and with the change toward lighter feedstocks in modern steam crackers there will be a growing dependence on the FCC to balance the supply side of the propylene equation."
[2] "Some of the technologies described in this review are those that have been taken to the commercial stage such as DCC and HSFCC, and are by no means an exhaustive list because there is a rising interest and ongoing research in applying special reactors and catalysts to control the yield of olefins and improve energy efficiency."
[3] "The impact of feed composition and process variables on the yields and heat balance is significant and therefore requires a good understanding of the chemistry to help with designing the right FCC catalyst for a unit."
[4] "To guarantee high propylene yield, a good catalyst must have low hydrogen transfer,high accessibility and prevailing matrix technology to complement the right reaction system and reaction conditions."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). There is an ongoing debate about the active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, with recent research contributing to our current understanding of these catalysts.
2. Technologies like Deep Catalytic Cracking (DCC) and High Severity Fluid Catalytic Cracking (HSFCC) have been commercialized to control olefin yields and enhance energy efficiency. Ongoing research focuses on applying special reactors and catalysts for better olefin production.
3. Understanding the chemistry behind feed composition and process variables is crucial for optimizing the FCC process to ensure a balanced supply of propylene.
4. For achieving high propylene yields, catalysts need to have low hydrogen transfer, high accessibility, and complement the right reaction system and conditions.
