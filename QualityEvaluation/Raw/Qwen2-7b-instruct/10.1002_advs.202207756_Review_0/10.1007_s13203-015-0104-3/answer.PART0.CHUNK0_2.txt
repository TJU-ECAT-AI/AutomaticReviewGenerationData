[1] "Global propylene demand trends remain strong, and with the change toward lighter feedstocks in modern steam crackers there will be a growing dependence on the FCC to balance the supply side of the propylene equation."
[2] "Some of the technologies described in this review are those that have been taken to the commercial stage such as DCC and HSFCC, and are by no means an exhaustive list because there is a rising interest and ongoing research in applying special reactors and catalysts to control the yield of olefins and improve energy efficiency."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as modern steam crackers shift towards lighter feedstocks. The reliance on Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) technology to balance the supply of propylene is increasing. Technologies such as Deep Catalytic Cracking (DCC) and High Severity Fluid Catalytic Cracking (HSFCC) have been commercialized. There is also ongoing research into special reactors and catalysts to enhance olefin yields and energy efficiency.
