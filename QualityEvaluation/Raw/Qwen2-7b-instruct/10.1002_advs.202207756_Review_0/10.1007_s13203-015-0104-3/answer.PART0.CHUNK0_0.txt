[1] "Global propylene demand trends remain strong, and with the change toward lighter feedstocks in modern steam crackers there will be a growing dependence on the FCC to balance the supply side of the propylene equation."
[2] "Some of the technologies described in this review are those that have been taken to the commercial stage such as DCC and HSFCC, and are by no means an exhaustive list because there is a rising interest and ongoing research in applying special reactors and catalysts to control the yield of olefins and improve energy efficiency."
[3] "The impact of feed composition and process variables on the yields and heat balance is significant and therefore requires a good understanding of the chemistry to help with designing the right FCC catalyst for a unit."
[4] "To guarantee high propylene yield, a good catalyst must have low hydrogen transfer,high accessibility and prevailing matrix technology to complement the right reaction system and reaction conditions."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, including debates about active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts. The impact of feed composition and process variables on the yields and heat balance is significant. To ensure high propylene yield, a catalyst must have low hydrogen transfer, high accessibility, and prevailing matrix technology to complement the right reaction system and conditions.
