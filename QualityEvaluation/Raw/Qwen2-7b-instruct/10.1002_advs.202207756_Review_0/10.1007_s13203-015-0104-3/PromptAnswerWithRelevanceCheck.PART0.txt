<quotes>
[1] "Global propylene demand trends remain strong, and with the change toward lighter feedstocks in modern steam crackers there will be a growing dependence on the FCC to balance the supply side of the propylene equation."
[2] "Some of the technologies described in this review are those that have been taken to the commercial stage such as DCC and HSFCC, and are by no means an exhaustive list because there is a rising interest and ongoing research in applying special reactors and catalysts to control the yield of olefins and improve energy efficiency."
[3] "The impact of feed composition and process variables on the yields and heat balance is significant and therefore requires a good understanding of the chemistry to help with designing the right FCC catalyst for a unit."
[4] "To guarantee high propylene yield, a good catalyst must have low hydrogen transfer,high accessibility and prevailing matrix technology to complement the right reaction system and reaction conditions."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as modern steam crackers increasingly rely on lighter feedstocks. This shift has emphasized the importance of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) technology in balancing the supply of propylene. Technologies like Deep Catalytic Cracking (DCC) and High Severity Fluid Catalytic Cracking (HSFCC) have been commercialized, and ongoing research aims to optimize the yield of olefins and enhance energy efficiency through the use of specialized reactors and catalysts.

[1] "Recent market analysis show that the demand for propylene is outpacing that of ethylene and the current supply cannot match the demand."
[2] "Propylene production from steam crackers depends upon the operating rates of the steam cracker and the type of feedstock."
[3] "Most modern steam crackers use ethane-based feed in place of heavy liquids leading to less propylene being produced."
[4] "Propylene demand from FCC is growing at a faster rate than global FCC capacity and therefore propylene yields from FCC need to increase to keep up with demand."
[5] "There is a natural desire to go for maximizing propylene yields."
[6] "To guarantee high propylene yield, a good catalyst must have low hydrogen transfer, high accessibility and prevailing matrix technology to complement the right reaction system and reaction conditions."
