[1] "Recent market analysis show that the demand for propylene is outpacing that of ethylene and the current supply cannot match the demand."
[2] "Propylene production from steam crackers depends upon the operating rates of the steam cracker and the type of feedstock."
[3] "Most modern steam crackers use ethane-based feed in place of heavy liquids leading to less propylene being produced."
[4] "Propylene demand from FCC is growing at a faster rate than global FCC capacity and therefore propylene yields from FCC need to increase to keep up with demand."
[5] "There is a natural desire to go for maximizing propylene yields."
[6] "To guarantee high propylene yield, a good catalyst must have low hydrogen transfer, high accessibility and prevailing matrix technology to complement the right reaction system and reaction conditions."

The growing demand for propylene has led to a search for new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, with debates surrounding the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, indicating that low hydrogen transfer, high accessibility, and the prevailing matrix technology are crucial for achieving high propylene yields. Catalysts must effectively manage the reaction system and conditions to ensure optimal performance.
