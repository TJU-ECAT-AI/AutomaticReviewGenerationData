[1] "The results of catalytic tests and catalyst characterization with complementary techniques enabled us to conclude that coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) and neighboring lattice oxygen are catalytically active sites responsible for C3H6 formation."
[2] "In comparison with our previous short communication [20], the purpose of the current work was to elucidate the fundamentals of propane dehydrogenation over ZrO2-based catalysts, which are required for tailored catalyst design."
[3] "The concentration of such defect sites and, therefore that of Zrcus sites, can also be increased through high-temperature reduction of zirconia, e.g. by H2. The higher the reduction temperature, the higher the num-ber of oxygen vacancies."
[4] "It is also well known that the ability of dopants for the substitution of Zr cations and forma- tion of homogeneous binary solid solutions strongly depend on the ionic radius of dopant metal cation, which should be close to that of Zr4+ (0.79 Å)."
[5] "Compared to the Ru-free binary materials, the activity of the 0.005Ru/LaZrOx and 0.005Ru/YZrOx catalysts only slightly increased, whereas the activity of the 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx catalysts even decreased (Fig. 3) with an increase in reduction temperature."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Early research on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH involved debates over the active Ga species. Recent studies have provided insights into the nature of these active sites, contributing to our current knowledge of PDH catalysts. Factors such as dopants and reduction temperatures affect the concentration of Zrcus sites, which are crucial for the catalytic activity of PDH. The ionic radius of dopant metal cations plays a significant role in forming homogeneous binary solid solutions. The activity of PDH catalysts, especially those containing Ru nanoparticles, varies with the type of dopant and reduction temperature. Higher reduction temperatures can lead to an increase in oxygen vacancies, affecting the catalytic activity.

对于丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已经显著发展。早期关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的研究涉及对活性Ga物种的争论。近期研究提供了有关这些活性位点性质的见解，为当前的PDH催化剂知识做出了贡献。因素如掺杂剂和还原温度会影响Zrcus位点的浓度，这对PDH的催化活性至关重要。掺杂金属离子的半径在形成均相二元固溶体中起着重要作用。含有Ru纳米颗粒的PDH催化剂的活性随着掺杂剂类型和还原温度的变化而变化。较高的还原温度可能导致氧空位数量增加，影响催化剂活性。
