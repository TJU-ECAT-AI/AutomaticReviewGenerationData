[1] "Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other pro-cesses have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale pro-duction, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3,4]."
[2] "Among the latter materials, those containing sup-ported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have been identified to be the most suitable candidates [515]."
[3] "In our recent short communications, we introduced alternative type of alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, which have typically been used as supports, i.e. Al2O3 [19] and ZrO2 promoted with La2O3 [20]."
[4] "We also reported that PDH activity of ZrO2 promoted with La2O3 could be increased after depositing hydrogenation-active metals such as Ru, Cu, Ni, and Co [20]."
[5] "The metals were not assumed to be directly responsible for the increase in the activity but helped to increase the concentration of Zrcus sites through reaction-induced reduction of ZrO2."
[6] "It is also well known that the ability of dopants for the substitution of Zr cations and forma- tion of homogeneous binary solid solutions strongly depend on the ionic radius of dopant metal cation, which should be close to that of Zr4+ (0.79 Å)."
[7] "In comparison with our previous short communication [20], the purpose of the current work was to elucidate the fundamentals of propane dehydrogenation over ZrO2-based catalysts, which are required for tailored catalyst design."

[1] "High activity, selectivity, and durability of our catalysts were verified by comparing their performance under industrially relevant conditions with that of a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material in a series of 60 PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles at 550, 600, and 625 C."
[2] "The results of catalytic tests and catalyst characterization with complementary techniques enabled us to conclude that coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) and neighboring lattice oxygen are catalytically active sites responsible for C3H6 formation."
[3] "We have three general suggestions for interpreting the effect of catalyst over-reduction on PDH activity. As mentioned above, both Zrcus and neighboring surface lattice oxygen are a part of the PDH active site (Fig. 5(a)). Concentration of the latter species will, however, decline with an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction; thus, C3H8 dehydrogenation will be hindered."

The document discusses the impact of growing demand for propylene on the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It highlights the importance of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, emphasizing debates about active Ga species and recent research findings that have advanced our knowledge. The document explains that PDH activity relies on coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) and neighboring lattice oxygen, which are crucial for C3H6 formation. It also addresses the issue of catalyst over-reduction, suggesting that this can hinder C3H8 dehydrogenation by reducing the concentration of active sites involved in the process. The document verifies the high activity, selectivity, and durability of ZrO2-based catalysts through comparisons with a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material under industrial conditions.

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the commercialization of alternative processes for its large-scale production, including the metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes, and non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH stands as a viable alternative to meet the increasing demand.

2. The high activity, selectivity, and durability of the developed catalysts were confirmed by comparing their performance in industrial conditions against a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material, across 60 PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles at 550, 600, and 625 C.

3. The effect of catalyst over-reduction on PDH activity is multifaceted. It involves a decline in the concentration of neighboring surface lattice oxygen, which is part of the PDH active site alongside Zrcus. This reduction hinders the C3H8 dehydrogenation process.

4. The practical relevance of the catalysts was validated through 60 PDH/regeneration cycles under conditions representative of industrial use, focusing on propane conversion degrees.

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Early research on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH involved debates over the active Ga species. Recent studies have provided insights into the nature of these active sites, contributing to our current knowledge of PDH catalysts. Factors such as dopants and reduction temperatures affect the concentration of Zrcus sites, which are crucial for the catalytic activity of PDH. The ionic radius of dopant metal cations plays a significant role in forming homogeneous binary solid solutions. The activity of PDH catalysts, especially those containing Ru nanoparticles, varies with the type of dopant and reduction temperature. Higher reduction temperatures can lead to an increase in oxygen vacancies, affecting the catalytic activity.

[3] "The concentration of such defect sites and, therefore that of Zrcus sites, can also be increased through high-temperature reduction of zirconia, e.g. by H2."
[4] "The concentration of anion vacancies was calculated from the amount of O2 consumed under the assumption that one O2 molecule fills two vacancies."
[5] "Another important observation from Fig. 3 is the influence of temperature of catalyst reductive treatment on the rate of propene formation measured at 550 C."
[6] "For checking whether large oxygen consumption over 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx can be explained by oxidation of Ru to RuO2, we performed a control O2 titration test with 0.05Ru/Al (60 wt.%)-Si(40 wt.%)Ox (non-reducible support) possessing the same Ru nanoparticles as the ZrO2-based catalysts."
[7] "As previously reported in Ref. [44], bulk oxygen diffusion in ZrO2 occurs between 300 and 450 C, i.e. at lower temperatures than 550 C in our O2 titration tests."
[8] "It is worth noting that propane conversion without any catalyst (blank activity) was only 0.2 and 1.6% at 550 and 625 C respectively thus even with the latter value being well below about 10% in the presence of catalyst."
[9] "The following explanation suggests that such behavior of the latter materials cannot be due to irreversible catalyst deactivation caused by reduction at high temperature."
[10] "The acquired Ea values for LaZrOx, YZrOx, 0.005Ru/LaZrOx, and 0.005Ru/YZrOx are given in Table 1."
