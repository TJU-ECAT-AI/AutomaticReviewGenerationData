[1] "High activity, selectivity, and durability of our catalysts were verified by comparing their performance under industrially relevant conditions with that of a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material in a series of 60 PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles at 550, 600, and 625 C."
[2] "The results of catalytic tests and catalyst characterization with complementary techniques enabled us to conclude that coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) and neighboring lattice oxygen are catalytically active sites responsible for C3H6 formation."
[3] "We have three general suggestions for interpreting the effect of catalyst over-reduction on PDH activity. As mentioned above, both Zrcus and neighboring surface lattice oxygen are a part of the PDH active site (Fig. 5(a)). Concentration of the latter species will, however, decline with an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction; thus, C3H8 dehydrogenation will be hindered."

The document discusses the impact of growing demand for propylene on the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It highlights the importance of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, emphasizing debates about active Ga species and recent research findings that have advanced our knowledge. The document explains that PDH activity relies on coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) and neighboring lattice oxygen, which are crucial for C3H6 formation. It also addresses the issue of catalyst over-reduction, suggesting that this can hinder C3H8 dehydrogenation by reducing the concentration of active sites involved in the process. The document verifies the high activity, selectivity, and durability of ZrO2-based catalysts through comparisons with a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material under industrial conditions.

文档讨论了对丙烯需求增长对新生产方法发展的影响，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。它强调了理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂对于PDH的重要性，突出讨论了活性Ga物种的争论以及最近的研究发现如何推动了我们对此类催化剂知识的理解。文档解释了PDH活动依赖于协调不饱和锆离子（Zrcus）和相邻晶格氧，这些是C3H6形成的关键。它还解决了催化剂过还原的问题，指出这可能会阻碍C3H8脱氢，因为会降低参与过程的活性位点浓度。文档通过在工业条件下与常规K-CrOx/Al2O3参考材料进行比较验证了ZrO2基催化剂的高活性、选择性和耐用性。
