[1] "Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other pro-cesses have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3,4]."
[2] "High activity, selectivity, and durability of our catalysts were verified by comparing their performance under industrially relevant conditions with that of a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material in a series of 60 PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles at 550, 600, and 625 C."
[3] "We have three general suggestions for interpreting the effect of catalyst over- reduction on PDH activity. As mentioned above, both Zrcus and neighboring surface lattice oxygen are a part of the PDH active site (Fig. 5(a)). Concentration of the latter species will, however, decline with an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction; thus, C3H8 dehydrogenation will be hindered."
[4] "To check practical relevance of our catalysts, we performed additional tests consisting of 60 PDH/regeneration cycles under industrially relevant degrees of propane conversion."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the commercialization of alternative processes for its large-scale production, including the metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes, and non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH stands as a viable alternative to meet the increasing demand.

2. The high activity, selectivity, and durability of the developed catalysts were confirmed by comparing their performance in industrial conditions against a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material, across 60 PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles at 550, 600, and 625 C.

3. The effect of catalyst over-reduction on PDH activity is multifaceted. It involves a decline in the concentration of neighboring surface lattice oxygen, which is part of the PDH active site alongside Zrcus. This reduction hinders the C3H8 dehydrogenation process.

4. The practical relevance of the catalysts was validated through 60 PDH/regeneration cycles under conditions representative of industrial use, focusing on propane conversion degrees.

1. 随着丙烯需求的持续增长，已经商业化了用于目的的大规模生产过程，包括乙烯和2-丁烯的裂合以及非氧化性丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH成为满足这一需求的可行选择。

2. 我们开发的催化剂在工业条件下与传统的K-CrOx/Al2O3参考材料进行了比较，通过60个PDH/氧化再生循环验证了其高活性、选择性和耐用性，分别在550、600和625°C下进行。

3. 催化剂过还原对PDH活性的影响涉及表面相邻晶格氧浓度的下降，它是PDH活性位点的一部分，与Zrcus共同存在。这种减少阻碍了C3H8的脱氢过程。

4. 通过在代表工业使用条件下的60个PDH/再生循环中，关注丙烷转化度，验证了催化剂的实用性。
