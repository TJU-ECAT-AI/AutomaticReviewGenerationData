[1] "High activity, selectivity, and durability of our catalysts were verified by comparing their performance under industrially relevant conditions with that of a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material in a series of 60 PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles at 550, 600, and 625 C."
[2] "The results of catalytic tests and catalyst characterization with complementary techniques enabled us to conclude that coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) and neighboring lattice oxygen are catalytically active sites responsible for C3H6 formation."
[3] "The concentration of such defect sites and, therefore that of Zrcus sites, can also be increased through high-temperature reduction of zirconia, e.g. by H2."
[4] "The concentration of anion vacancies was calculated from the amount of O2 consumed under the assumption that one O2 molecule fills two vacancies."
[5] "Another important observation from Fig. 3 is the influence of temperature of catalyst reductive treatment on the rate of propene formation measured at 550 C."
[6] "For checking whether large oxygen consumption over 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx can be explained by oxidation of Ru to RuO2, we performed a control O2 titration test with 0.05Ru/Al (60 wt.%)-Si(40 wt.%)Ox (non-reducible support) possessing the same Ru nanoparticles as the ZrO2-based catalysts."
[7] "As previously reported in Ref. [44], bulk oxygen diffusion in ZrO2 occurs between 300 and 450 C, i.e. at lower temperatures than 550 C in our O2 titration tests."
[8] "It is worth noting that propane conversion without any catalyst (blank activity) was only 0.2 and 1.6% at 550 and 625 C respectively thus even with the latter value being well below about 10% in the presence of catalyst."
[9] "The following explanation suggests that such behavior of the latter materials cannot be due to irreversible catalyst deactivation caused by reduction at high temperature."
[10] "The acquired Ea values for LaZrOx, YZrOx, 0.005Ru/LaZrOx, and 0.005Ru/YZrOx are given in Table 1."

1. The study confirmed the high activity, selectivity, and durability of the catalysts through comparison with a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material in industrial conditions across 60 cycles at 550, 600, and 625 C.

2. The authors concluded that coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) and neighboring lattice oxygen are active sites responsible for propane dehydrogenation.

3. The concentration of active sites can be increased by reducing the zirconia at high temperatures, for example by hydrogen.

4. The concentration of oxygen vacancies was determined based on the amount of oxygen consumed during the titration experiments.

5. The reductive treatment temperature significantly influenced the rate of propene formation at 550 C.

6. The oxygen consumption tests showed that the large oxygen consumption over 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx was not due to Ru oxidation but rather to filling of oxygen vacancies.

7. Bulk oxygen diffusion in zirconia occurs between 300 and 450 C, which is lower than the temperatures used in the oxygen consumption tests.

8. The blank activity of the catalysts was very low, even below 10% at 625 C.

9. The behavior of the Ru-containing catalysts at high temperatures did not indicate irreversible deactivation, suggesting a change in the intrinsic activity or concentration of active sites.

10. The apparent activation energies (Ea) for the catalysts are listed in Table 1.

1. 研究通过在工业条件下与传统的K-CrOx/Al2O3参考材料进行比较，确认了催化剂的高活性、选择性和耐用性，在550、600和625摄氏度下进行了60个周期的比较。

2. 作者得出结论，协调不饱和的锆离子（Zrcus）和相邻的晶格氧是负责丙烷裂解的活性位点。

3. 可以通过在高温下还原锆化物来增加活性位点的浓度，例如通过氢气。

4. 氧气消耗测试确定了氧气消耗量与氧空位数量之间的关系。

5. 降低处理温度对550摄氏度下的丙烯形成速率有显著影响。

6. 大量的氧气消耗测试结果表明，0.05Ru/LaZrOx和0.05Ru/YZrOx中大的氧气消耗不是由于Ru氧化，而是填充了氧空位。

7. 在zirconia中的氧扩散发生在300到450摄氏度之间，低于我们在氧气消耗测试中使用的温度。

8. 催化剂的空白活性非常低，甚至在625摄氏度时低于10%。

9. 在高温下，Ru含有的催化剂的行为没有显示出不可逆的失活，这表明活性位点的内在活性或浓度发生了变化。
