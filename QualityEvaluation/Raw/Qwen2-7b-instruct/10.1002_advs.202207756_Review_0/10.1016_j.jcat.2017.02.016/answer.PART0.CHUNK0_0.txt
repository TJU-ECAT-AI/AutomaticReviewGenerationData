[1] "Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other pro-cesses have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale pro-duction, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3,4]."
[2] "Among the latter materials, those containing sup-ported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have been identified to be the most suitable candidates [515]."
[3] "In our recent short communications, we introduced alternative type of alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, which have typically been used as supports, i.e. Al2O3 [19] and ZrO2 promoted with La2O3 [20]."
[4] "We also reported that PDH activity of ZrO2 promoted with La2O3 could be increased after depositing hydrogenation-active metals such as Ru, Cu, Ni, and Co [20]."
[5] "The metals were not assumed to be directly responsible for the increase in the activity but helped to increase the concentration of Zrcus sites through reaction-induced reduction of ZrO2."
[6] "It is also well known that the ability of dopants for the substitution of Zr cations and forma- tion of homogeneous binary solid solutions strongly depend on the ionic radius of dopant metal cation, which should be close to that of Zr4+ (0.79 Å)."
[7] "In comparison with our previous short communication [20], the purpose of the current work was to elucidate the fundamentals of propane dehydrogenation over ZrO2-based catalysts, which are required for tailored catalyst design."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of alternative processes like metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes, and non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH is a method for producing propylene through the dehydrogenation of propane.
2. Researchers have identified GaOx, VOx, or InOx supported materials as promising candidates for PDH catalysts.
3. Alternative alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, including Al2O3 and ZrO2 promoted with La2O3, have been introduced.
4. Hydrogenation-active metals like Ru, Cu, Ni, and Co can enhance the PDH activity of ZrO2 promoted with La2O3 by increasing the concentration of Zrcus sites.
5. The role of these metals in PDH activity is not direct but rather facilitates the creation of more Zrcus sites.
6. The substitution of Zr cations and formation of binary solid solutions depend on the ionic radius of the dopant metal cation, which should closely match that of Zr4+.
7. The current study aimed to explore the fundamentals of propane dehydrogenation over ZrO2-based catalysts, essential for custom catalyst design.

1. 随着丙烯需求的持续增长，已经开发出了替代过程，如乙烯和2-丁烯的环化以及非氧化性丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH是一种通过脱氢丙烷产生丙烯的方法。
2. 研究人员已确定GaOx、VOx或InOx支持材料作为PDH催化剂的有希望候选者。
3. 引入了替代烷烃脱氢催化剂，包括Al2O3和La2O3促进的ZrO2。
4. 如Ru、Cu、Ni和Co等氢化活性金属可以增加La2O3促进的ZrO2的PDH活性，通过增加Zrcus位点的数量。
5. 这些金属在PDH活性中的作用并非直接，而是通过促进ZrO2的反应诱导还原来增加Zrcus位点数量。
6. Zr离子的取代和形成二元固溶体取决于掺杂金属离子半径，应与Zr4+紧密匹配。
7. 当前的研究旨在探索ZrO2基催化剂中丙烷脱氢的基本原理，这对于定制催化剂设计至关重要。
