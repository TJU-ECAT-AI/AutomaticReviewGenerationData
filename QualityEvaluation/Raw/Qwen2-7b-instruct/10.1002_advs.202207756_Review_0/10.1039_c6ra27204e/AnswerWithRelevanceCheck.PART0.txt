          [1] "In recent years, more attention has been paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene because the growing demand for propylene is beyond the production capacity of conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes."
          [2] "It is found that the supports determine the porous features, the state and dispersion of Ga species, and the acid-base properties of the corresponding catalysts."
          [3] "Moreover, as shown in Table 2, the catalytic performances over the synthesized catalysts with different loadings can be explained as following."
          [4] "The existence of strong acid sites in catalyst can lead to more well-dispersed Ga species."
          [5] "Moreover, as shown in Table 2, the catalytic performances of xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts are closely related to the variation of the total acid of the catalysts with respect to Ga2O3 content."

          1. The growing demand for propylene has led to increased focus on catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as traditional production methods cannot meet the demand for propylene.
          2. The structure of the support material affects the porosity, state, dispersion of gallium species, and acid-base properties of the catalyst.
          3. As demonstrated in Table 2, the catalytic performance of catalysts with different loadings can be explained based on their characteristics.
          4. The presence of strong acid sites in the catalyst can result in better dispersion of gallium species.
          5. As illustrated in Table 2, the catalytic performance of xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts is closely linked to the change in total acidity relative to the gallium oxide content.
