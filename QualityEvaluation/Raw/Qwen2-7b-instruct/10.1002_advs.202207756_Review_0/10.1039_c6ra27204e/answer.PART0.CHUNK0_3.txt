[1] "In recent years, more attention has been paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene because the growing demand for propylene is beyond the production capacity of conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes."
[2] "It is found that the supports determine the porous features, the state and dispersion of Ga species, and the acid-base properties of the corresponding catalysts."
[3] "Among the Ga2O3-based catalysts with different supports, the 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 sample exhibits the highest catalytic activity, which possesses the maximum well-dispersed gallium species and high dehydrogenation efficiency gallium ions (Gad+ cations, d < 2)."
[4] "The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic stability."
[5] "The initial propane conversion and propylene selectivity are above 32.0% and 90.0% respectively, and a final propane conversion of 17.0% is obtained after 30 h reaction."
[6] "As for the xGa2O3/SBA-15 samples, the 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 sample exhibits the best catalytic performance."
[7] "The initial conversion of propane for different catalysts decreases in the following order: 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 > 5Ga2O3/Al2O3 > 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 > 5Ga2O3/SiO2."
[8] "The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst shows the highest initial propane conversion (78.1%)."
[9] "The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst possesses the maximum gallium ions (Gad+ cations, d < 2), well-dispersed Ga species and strong acid sites."
[10] "The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic stability, the highest SBET value and the lowest acidity."
[11] "The propane conversion only declines 11% after reaction for 30 h."
[12] "The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 sample exhibits the highest catalytic performance, possesses the most well-dispersed Ga species and the best structure accompany with the relatively high loading amount."
