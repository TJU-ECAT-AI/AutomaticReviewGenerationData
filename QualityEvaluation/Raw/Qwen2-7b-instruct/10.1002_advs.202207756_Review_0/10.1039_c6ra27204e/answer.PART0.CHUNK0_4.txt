[1] "In recent years, more attention has been paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene because the growing demand for propylene is beyond the production capacity of conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes."
[2] "It is clear that 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits two ammonia desorption peaks. The first peak centered (peak I) at 220 C is attributed to the weak acid sites; while the second peak centered (peak II) at 420 C is attributed to the strong acid sites."
[3] "The high SBET value and the lowest acidity."
[4] "The initial propane conversions of 21.7%, 28.3%, 33.8% and 45.0% are obtained at 580, 600, 620 and 640 C respectively, and they decrease to 16.1%, 20.4%, 26.6% and 36.0% aer 20 h reaction."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to greater interest in developing new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is because traditional processes like hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking cannot meet the demand for propylene.

2. The 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 catalyst shows two ammonia desorption peaks. The first peak at 220°C corresponds to weak acid sites, while the second peak at 420°C is attributed to strong acid sites.

3. The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst has the highest SBET value and the lowest acidity, which contributes to its excellent catalytic stability.

4. The propane conversion decreases as the reaction temperature increases from 580°C to 640°C, reaching 16.1% at 580°C and 36.0% at 640°C after 20 hours of reaction.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，人们越来越关注丙烷脱氢为丙烯的方法。这是因为传统的烃类蒸汽裂解和催化裂解过程无法满足对丙烯的需求。

2. 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5催化剂表现出两个氨脱附峰。第一峰在220°C时对应弱酸位点，而第二峰在420°C时归因于强酸位点。

3. 5Ga2O3/SBA-15催化剂具有最高的比表面积和最低的酸性，这对其出色的催化稳定性做出了贡献。

4. 反应温度从580°C增加到640°C时，丙烷转化率逐渐下降，达到580°C时的16.1%，640°C时的36.0%，反应20小时后。
