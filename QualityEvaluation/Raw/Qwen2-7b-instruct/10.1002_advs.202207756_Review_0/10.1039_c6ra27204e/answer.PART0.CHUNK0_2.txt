[1] "In recent years, more attention has been paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene because the growing demand for propylene is beyond the production capacity of conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes."
[2] "It is found that the supports determine the porous features, the state and dispersion of Ga species, and the acid-base properties of the corresponding catalysts."
[3] "Moreover, as for the xGa2O3/SBA-15 samples, the 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 sample exhibits the best catalytic performance."
[4] "The initial propane conversion and propylene selectivity are above 32.0% and 90.0% respectively, and a final propane conversion of 17.0% is obtained after 30 h reaction."
[5] "For example, Shen et al.20 reported that the stability and selectivity of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation were enhanced by increasing the Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support."
[6] "As regards ZSM-5 zeolite, it has some particular physical properties such as unique three-dimensional channels, relatively large surface area and adjustable Si/Al ratio."
[7] "The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic stability, the highest SBET value and the lowest acidity."
[8] "The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 sample exhibits the highest catalytic performance, possesses the most well-dispersed Ga species and the best structure accompany with the relatively high loading amount, the final propane conversion and propylene selectivity still attain above 17.5% and 92.0% aer 30 h propane dehydrogenation reaction at 620 C."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to increased focus on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This is because the production capacity of traditional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking methods cannot meet the demand for propylene.
2. The structure of the support material plays a critical role in the performance of gallium oxide-based catalysts. It influences the porosity, state, dispersion, and acidity of gallium species.
3. Among gallium oxide-based catalysts with different supports, the 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst shows superior catalytic performance.
4. The initial conversion of propane and propylene selectivity reach 32.0% and 90.0% respectively, and the final propane conversion is 17.0% after 30 hours of reaction.
5. Increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support can enhance the stability and selectivity of the Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalyst in propane dehydrogenation, according to the research by Shen et al.
6. Zeolite ZSM-5 has unique three-dimensional channels, a relatively large surface area, and adjustable Si/Al ratio.
7. The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst displays the highest catalytic stability, the highest specific surface area, and the lowest acidity.
8. The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 sample achieves the best catalytic performance. It has the most evenly dispersed gallium species and optimal structure. Even after 30 hours of propane dehydrogenation at 620°C, the final propane conversion and propylene selectivity are over 17.5% and 92.0% respectively.
