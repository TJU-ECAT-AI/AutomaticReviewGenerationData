The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the search for more efficient and selective catalysts. Gallium oxide-based catalysts have emerged as promising alternatives due to their ability to activate hydrocarbon species and their superior catalytic efficiency compared to traditional catalysts like chromium (Cr) and vanadium (V). The research team from Shanghai Normal University focused on studying the effects of different supports (ZSM-5, SBA-15, g-Al2O3, and SiO2) and gallium oxide loading on the properties and catalytic performances of supported gallium oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Their work aimed to understand how the intrinsic nature of the supports and loading amount impact the dispersion of gallium species, surface chemical states, and coke formation, ultimately affecting the catalytic performance. The team found that the strong acid sites of catalysts largely determine the dispersion of gallium species, but they can also induce adverse side reactions. The balance between enhancing reaction activity through strong acid sites and decreasing selectivity and stability is crucial for the effectiveness of gallium oxide-supported catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

近年来，丙烯需求的增长促使了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），因为这种增长导致了传统烃蒸汽裂解和催化裂解过程的生产能力无法满足丙烯需求。镓氧化物基催化剂因其独特的能力激活碳氢化合物物种以及与传统Cr2O3-和V2O5基催化剂相比的出色催化效率而被认作是新型的烷烃脱氢材料。上海师范大学的研究团队专注于研究不同支持材料（ZSM-5、SBA-15、g-Al2O3和SiO2）和镓氧化物负载量对支持型镓氧化物催化剂的性质和丙烷脱氢性能的影响。他们的工作旨在理解支持材料的内在特性和负载量如何影响镓物种的分散、表面化学状态和焦炭形成，进而影响催化剂的性能。研究发现，催化剂中的强酸位点主要决定了镓物种的分散，但它们也可能引起不利的副反应。在镓氧化物支持催化剂的丙烷脱氢反应中，平衡强酸位点增强反应活性与降低选择性和稳定性的关系对于提高其效果至关重要。
