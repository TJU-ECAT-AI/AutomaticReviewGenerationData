[1] "In recent years, more attention has been paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene because the growing demand for propylene is beyond the production capacity of conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes."
[2] "It is found that the supports determine the porous features, the state and dispersion of Ga species, and the acid-base properties of the corresponding catalysts."
[3] "The existence of strong acid sites in catalyst can lead to more well-dispersed Ga species."
[4] "The catalytic performances over the synthesized catalysts with different loadings can be explained as following."
[5] "Moreover, as shown in Table 2, the catalytic performances of xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts are closely related to the variation of the total acid of the catalysts with respect to Ga2O3 content."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to increased focus on catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as traditional production methods are insufficient. This highlights the importance of developing efficient and effective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

2. The supports used in catalysts significantly influence the catalyst's porosity, the state and dispersion of gallium species, and the acid-base properties.

3. Strong acid sites in catalysts contribute to the dispersion of gallium species, which is crucial for optimal performance.

4. The performance of gallium oxide-based catalysts depends on the gallium content and the support used. 

5. The catalytic activities of xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts are closely tied to the total acidity of the catalysts, which changes with the gallium oxide content.
