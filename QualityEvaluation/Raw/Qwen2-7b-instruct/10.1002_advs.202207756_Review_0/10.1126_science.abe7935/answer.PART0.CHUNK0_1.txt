Propene (14) has been extensively used as a building unit for the production of plastics, fibers, and intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals. The current method for propene production predominantly relies on the steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha, but production using this method is still far from meeting the demands for propene, 116,000,000 tons in 2020. Recently, shale gas, which contains abundant propane, has been regarded as a promising source for propene to reduce dependence on petroleum.

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as traditional methods rely heavily on naphtha cracking, which does not meet the propene demands sufficiently. Shale gas, rich in propane, has emerged as a viable alternative to reduce dependency on petroleum.

对丙烯的日益增长的需求已经影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），因为传统的裂化方法主要依赖于石脑油，无法满足丙烯需求。页岩气富含丙烷，被视为减少对石油依赖的有前景的来源。

The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days. By calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 with an Si/B ratio of 62 was obtained. BS-1 catalyst was identified by x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibiting typical characteristics in its MFI structure (figs. S1 and S2). A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the BS-1 catalyst showed an average zeolite crystal size of 350 nm (fig. S3). A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of the BS-1 catalyst confirmed the open zeolite micropores (fig. S4). Energy dispersive spectroscopic elemental maps of the BS-1 catalyst revealed uniform distribution of boron species on the silica matrix (fig. S5). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis showed undetectable metal species (fig. S6), which excludes the suspected contribution of impurities on catalytic activity. For comparison, we also loaded the boron species on S-1 zeolite (B/S-1) and amorphous silica (B/SiO2) by impregnation (fig. S7), with Si/B ratios of 50 and 66, respectively.

BS-1催化剂通过无溶剂结晶法合成，使用四丙基铵氢氧化物，在180°C下反应3天，随后通过煅烧去除有机模板，得到Si/B比为62的催化剂。通过X射线衍射图、N2吸附等温线、扫描电子显微镜和透射电子显微镜成像识别出其MFI结构。元素映射显示了硅胶矩阵上硼物种的均匀分布。未检测到可检测金属物种，表明不存在影响催化活性的杂质。
