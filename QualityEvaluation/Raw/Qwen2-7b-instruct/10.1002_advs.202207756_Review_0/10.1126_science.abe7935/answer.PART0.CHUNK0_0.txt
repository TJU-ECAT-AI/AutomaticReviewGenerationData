Propene (14) has been extensively used as a building unit for the production of plastics, fibers, and intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals. The current method for propene production predominantly relies on the steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha, but production using this method is still far from meeting the demands for propene, 116,000,000 tons in 2020. Recently, shale gas, which contains abundant propane, has been regarded as a promising source for propene to reduce dependence on petroleum. Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as industrial technologies such as Oleflex by Honeywell UOP and Catofin by ABB Lumus (1, 2, 59) have been developed, but these have insufficient lifetimes because of thermodynamically favorable coke formation and metal sintering, which require frequent catalyst regeneration. By contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has substantial advantages regarding exothermic features and hindrance of coke formation but is easily overoxidized to form valueless CO2 (1018), and this remains a challenge for practical applications.

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Technologies like Oleflex by Honeywell UOP and Catofin by ABB Lumus have been developed, but they suffer from issues like coke formation and metal sintering, requiring frequent catalyst regeneration. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages such as exothermic features and prevention of coke formation, but it faces challenges due to the ease of overoxidation to form valueless CO2, which remains a significant hurdle for practical applications.

对丙烯日益增长的需求已经推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。如霍尼韦尔UOP的Oleflex和ABB Lumus的Catofin等技术被开发出来，但它们面临着焦炭形成和金属烧结的问题，需要频繁更换催化剂。氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）具有放热特性和防止焦炭形成的优点，但因其容易过氧化生成无价值的二氧化碳，这仍然是实际应用中的一个重大挑战。
