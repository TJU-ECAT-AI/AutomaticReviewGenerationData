Propene (14) has been extensively used as a building unit for the production of plastics, fibers, and intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals. The current method for propene production predominantly relies on the steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha, but production using this method is still far from meeting the demands for propene, 116,000,000 tons in 2020. Recently, shale gas, which contains abundant propane, has been regarded as a promising source for propene to reduce dependence on petroleum. Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as industrial technologies such as Oleflex by Honeywell UOP and Catofin by ABB Lumus (1, 2, 59) have been developed, but these have insufficient lifetimes because of thermodynamically favorable coke formation and metal sintering, which require frequent catalyst regeneration. By contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has substantial advantages regarding exothermic features and hindrance of coke formation but is easily overoxidized to form valueless CO2 (1018), and this remains a challenge for practical applications.

The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days. By calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 with an Si/B ratio of 62 was obtained. BS-1 catalyst was identified by x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibiting typical characteristics in its MFI structure (figs. S1 and S2). A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the BS-1 catalyst showed an average zeolite crystal size of 350 nm (fig. S3). A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of the BS-1 catalyst confirmed the open zeolite micropores (fig. S4). Energy dispersive spectroscopic elemental maps of the BS-1 catalyst revealed uniform distribution of boron species on the silica matrix (fig. S5). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis showed undetectable metal species (fig. S6), which excludes the suspected contribution of impurities on catalytic activity. For comparison, we also loaded the boron species on S-1 zeolite (B/S-1) and amorphous silica (B/SiO2) by impregnation (fig. S7), with Si/B ratios of 50 and 66, respectively.

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditionally, propene has been produced through steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha, which has proven insufficient to meet the high demand for propene, estimated at 116 million tons in 2020. Shale gas, rich in propane, has emerged as a promising alternative to reduce dependence on petroleum for propene production. However, nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane faces challenges due to thermodynamically favorable coke formation and metal sintering, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration. On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages with exothermic features and hindrance of coke formation, yet it is prone to overoxidation, leading to the formation of valueless CO2. Recent advancements have focused on catalysts containing boron, specifically those with isolated boron species. These catalysts, like the BS-1 catalyst, exhibit high activity and selectivity for ODHP, producing propene and ethene as valuable products. The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized using a solvent-free crystallization process, and its structure and composition were characterized through various analytical techniques. In ODHP experiments, the BS-1 catalyst demonstrated superior performance, achieving propane conversions up to 44% with selectivities for propene and ethene exceeding 80%. Importantly, the BS-1 catalyst retained its high activity and selectivity even after a 210-hour continuous test, showcasing its exceptional durability and water tolerance, which sets it apart from traditional supported boron catalysts that are often deactivated by water washing due to boron leaching and dissolution.

丙烯需求的增长已经影响了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。传统上，丙烯通过石脑油中的重碳氢化合物蒸汽裂解生产，这不足以满足对丙烯的巨大需求，估计在2020年为1.16亿吨。富含丙烷的页岩气已出现作为减少石油依赖以生产丙烯的有前景的替代品。然而，非氧化性丙烷脱氢面临挑战，由于热力学有利的焦炭形成和金属结块，需要频繁更换催化剂。相比之下，氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）具有放热特性和防止焦炭形成的优势，但仍容易过氧化，导致生成无价值的CO2。最近的研究集中在含硼催化剂上，尤其是那些包含孤立硼物种的催化剂。这些催化剂，如BS-1催化剂，在ODHP中表现出高活性和选择性，产生丙烯和乙烯作为有价值的产品。BS-1催化剂通过溶剂自由结晶过程合成，并通过各种分析技术对其结构和组成进行了表征。在ODHP实验中，BS-1催化剂表现出优越的性能，实现了高达44%的丙烷转化率，丙烯和乙烯的选择性超过80%。更重要的是，BS-1催化剂即使在长达210小时的连续测试后仍保持其高活性和选择性，展示了其出色的耐用性和水容忍度，这与传统的由于硼溶解而容易被水清洗导致活性丧失的硼基催化剂形成鲜明对比。

[15] "This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (figs. S37 and S38), giving good durability in the reaction process."
[16] "In addition, even if a small amount of B(OH)3 species exists on BS-1, such a species would not contribute to propane conversion, as supported by the extremely low activity of the B/S-1 catalyst (boric acid loaded on S-1 zeolite; Fig. 1A)."
[17] "For the catalyst with a dihydroxyl group on boron, O2 and C3H8 were initially coadsorbed on one hydroxyl group through weak van der Waals interaction (R; figs. S51 and S52)."

The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized using a solvent-free crystallization strategy. It was compared with B/S-1 and B/SiO2 catalysts, both loaded with boron species through impregnation. The ODHP was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor with a feed gas composition of propane and oxygen. The BS-1 catalyst showed high propane conversion, with selectivities for propene and ethene reaching 53.3% and 29.5%, respectively, after 210 hours of reaction. This indicates the good durability of the BS-1 catalyst in ODHP. The catalyst's structure was found to hinder full hydrolysis of boron species, contributing to its water tolerance and stability. Research suggests that the B(OH)2 groups and nearby silanol species play a crucial role in the reaction pathway, highlighting the importance of tuning the coordination environment for improving catalyst performance.

[7] "For these catalysts, the BOB oligomers are generally regarded as active centers (2628), whereas a single-site boron in zeolite (e.g., BMWW) is inert for the reaction (29)."
[8] "However, the BOB oligomers are associated with complete hydrolysis by water products to form boron with saturated hydroxyl groups (e.g., boric acid), which could deactivate the catalyst once the boric acid leaches from the reaction system because of the strong solubility of such species in water (24, 30)."
[9] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[15] "For example, 23.8 and 41.4% of propane conversions were realized on the BS-1 catalyst at 540 and 560C, respectively."
[16] "Fig. 1B and fig. S8 show that the BS-1 catalyst exhibited propene and ethene selectivities (based on carbon atoms) of 60.9 and 25.7% at a low propane conversions of 5.3%, giving an overoxidized propane selectivity of <0.5%."
[17] "This excellent selectivity was mostly maintained with raising the propane conversion."
[18] "In ODHP, high propane conversion usually leads to easy overoxidation (18)."
[19] "For example, VOx-based catalysts have selectivity for light olefins of <50%, with CO2 as a major product when propane conversion exceeds 30% in the ODHP (fig. S8)."
[20] "By contrast, high olefin selectivity (>81.2%) was always obtained over the BS-1 catalyst in a wide range of propane conversions (3.8 to 41.4%)."
[21] "The hexagonal carbon nitride (h-BN) catalyst, which has been regarded as a highly efficient catalyst for ODHP, showed slightly lower olefin selectivity (79.9%) under the comparable propane conversion (40.2%; fig. S8)."
[22] "Because of this reaction trend, the olefin formation rate over the BS-1 catalyst was much higher than that of the h-BN and B/S-1 catalysts (fig. S10)."
[23] "The supported boron catalysts were usually deactivated by washing with water because of boron leaching and dissolving (21, 22)."

[25] "The BS-1 catalyst retained this ability after the equivalent treatment (Fig. 1C)."
[26] "Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce 10 vol% water in the gas."
[27] "As shown in Fig. 1D, the propane conversion and propene and/or ethene selectivities were 32.5% and 53.8% and/or 28.6%, respectively, at the beginning of the reaction."
[28] "Even after reaction for 88 hours, the BS-1 catalyst exhibited similar propane conversion (32.9%) and propene and ethene selectivities (57.0 and 28.0%, respectively)."
[29] "Further reaction for longer times led to increased propane conversion, reaching 42.6% at 148 hours, whereas the olefin selectivity was almost unchanged."
[30] "Even after reaction for 210 hours, the catalyst still exhibited propane conversion at 43.7%, with propene and ethene selectivities at 53.3 and 29.5%, respectively, showing the good durability of the BS-1 catalyst in the ODHP."
[31] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2A)."
[32] "The two-dimensional (2D) 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species."
[33] "Further identification was performed by the 2D 11B11B proton driven spin diffusion (PDSD) homonuclear correlation spectrum (Fig. 2C), where the off-diagonal signal assigned to spatial correlations of different boron species was undetectable."
[34] "Considering that dehydration of a portion of B[4] sites (H+[H2O]n removal) could form B[3] sites, which is a reversible and stochastic process, the B[3]B[4] spatial correlations would be inevitable if there were agglomerated boron species (e.g., BOB)."
[35] "Therefore, the undetectable B[3]B[4] spatial correlations suggest isolated boron sites on BS-1."
[36] "The hydroxyl groups on the isolated boron were identified using NMR. Figure 3A shows the 1H MAS NMR spectra of BS-1 and B/S-1, with signals at 1.8 ppm assigned to terminal silanol hydroxyl groups (SiOH) on the zeolite matrix (Fig. 3B, I)."
[37] "In addition, B/S-1 has another signal at 2.9 ppm related to the fully hydrolyzed boron species [e.g., B(OH)3], whereas the BS-1 exhibits four additional 1H signals at 2.1, 2.6, 3.5, and 4.5 ppm, which are assigned to SiOH adjacent to oxygen on BOH (2.1 ppm, SiOHO(H)B; Fig. 3B, II), SiOH adjacent to boron (2.6 ppm; Fig. 3B, III), BOH adjacent to oxygen on SiOH [3.5 ppm, BOHO(H)Si; Fig. 3B, II], and the hydroniums [4.5 ppm, H+(H2O)n; Fig. 3B, IV]."
[38] "The signals at 3.5 and 2.1 ppm should be coproduced from the hydrolysis of the SiOB linkage in zeolite framework."
[39] "Compared with as-synthesized BS-1, the used sample exhibited enhanced signal intensity at (3.5, 5.6) ppm and (2.1, 5.6) ppm (Fig. 3C)."
[40] "This phenomenon is reasonably related to the further hydrolysis of SiOB bonds during the ODHP to form more spatially correlated BOH and SiOH species (e.g., isolated B[OHO(H)Si]2), which should be crucial for the high activity of BS-1 zeolite."

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as it seeks to reduce dependence on petroleum and leverage abundant propane sources from shale gas. PDH technologies like Oleflex by Honeywell UOP and Catofin by ABB Lumus have been developed, but they suffer from limitations due to issues like coke formation and metal sintering, requiring frequent catalyst regeneration. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of exothermic features and the hindrance of coke formation, but it faces challenges due to overoxidation, forming valueless CO2. The recent discovery of boron-containing catalysts, such as BN and supported boron oxide, has provided solutions to these issues by suppressing overoxidation and enhancing the selectivity for propene production.

2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with ongoing debates about the active Ga species. Research findings have contributed to identifying the active sites, such as the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1), which differs from catalysts containing BOB oligomers. These catalysts not only efficiently activate molecular oxygen and propane for dehydrogenation but also prevent full boron hydrolysis, leading to high activity and selectivity, especially in the presence of water. The structure of BS-1 helps maintain high activity and selectivity over long periods, demonstrating its water tolerance and durability.

1. 对丙烯的日益增长的需求已经影响了新的生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），以减少对石油的依赖并利用页岩气中丰富的丙烷资源。PDH 技术如霍尼韦尔UOP 的Oleflex 和ABB Lumus的Catofin 已经发展起来，但它们面临着焦炭形成和金属烧结等问题，需要频繁更换催化剂。氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）在热力学上具有优势，并且可以防止焦炭形成，但仍然面临过氧化的问题，导致生成无价值的CO2。最近发现的含硼催化剂，如BN和支持型硼氧化物，通过抑制过氧化和提高丙烯选择性，为解决这些问题提供了解决方案。

2. Ga/H-ZSM-5 催化剂用于PDH的理解随着关于活性Ga物种的持续争论而演变。研究发现贡献了识别活性位点的知识，例如在沸石MFI 框架中的单个隔离硼（B[OHO(H)Si]2）结构（BS-1），这与包含BOB 多聚体的催化剂不同。这些催化剂不仅有效地激活分子氧和丙烷进行脱氢，而且还可以防止硼的完全水解，从而保持高活性和选择性，尤其是在存在水分的情况下。BS-1 的结构有助于在长时间内维持高活性和选择性，证明了其在反应过程中的水耐受性和耐用性。
