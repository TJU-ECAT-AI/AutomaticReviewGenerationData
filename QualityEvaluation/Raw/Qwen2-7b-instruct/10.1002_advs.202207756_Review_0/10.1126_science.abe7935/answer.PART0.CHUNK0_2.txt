[1] "Propene (14) has been extensively used as a building unit for the production of plastics, fibers, and intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals."
[2] "The current method for propene production predominantly relies on the steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha, but production using this method is still far from meeting the demands for propene, 116,000,000 tons in 2020."
[3] "Recently, shale gas, which contains abundant propane, has been regarded as a promising source for propene to reduce dependence on petroleum."
[4] "Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as industrial technologies such as Oleflex by Honeywell UOP and Catofin by ABB Lumus (1, 2, 59) have been developed, but these have insufficient lifetimes because of thermodynamically favorable coke formation and metal sintering, which require frequent catalyst regeneration."
[5] "By contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has substantial advantages regarding exothermic features and hindrance of coke formation but is easily overoxidized to form valueless CO2 (1018), and this remains a challenge for practical applications."
[6] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."
[7] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days."
[8] "The catalytic ODHP was performed in a fixed-bed reactor containing a feed gas of propane and oxygen (C3H8/O2/He = 1/1/8) with a weight-hour-space-velocity (WHSV, LC3H8 kgcatalyst-1 h-1) of 3600 L kg-1 h-1."
[9] "Figure 1A shows the dependence of propane conversion on reaction temperature over various catalysts."
[10] "The BS-1 catalyst was active for the reaction, giving propane conversion with increasing reaction temperature."
[11] "For example, 23.8 and 41.4% of propane conversions were realized on the BS-1 catalyst at 540 and 560°C, respectively."
[12] "By contrast, B/S-1 and B/SiO2 catalysts exhibited lower propane conversions at 1.9 and 8.5% at 540°C, respectively."
[13] "Propene appeared in the boron-catalyzed ODHP as a dominant product, and the side reaction led to the formation of ethene, which is also a valuable olefin product, rather than the valueless COx that is usually formed in the oxidation."
[14] "Under these reaction conditions, the one-pass yield of olefins reached 33.6% (22.7% for propene and 10.9% for ethene)."
[15] "In ODHP, high propane conversion usually leads to easy overoxidation (18)."
[16] "For example, VOx-based catalysts have selectivity for light olefins of <50%, with CO2 as a major product when propane conversion exceeds 30% in the ODHP (fig. S8)."
[17] "By contrast, high olefin selectivity (>81.2%) was always obtained over the BS-1 catalyst in a wide range of propane conversions (3.8 to 41.4%)."
[18] "Because of this reaction trend, the olefin formation rate over the BS-1 catalyst was much higher than that of the h-BN and B/S-1 catalysts (fig. S10)."
[19] "The supported boron catalysts were usually deactivated by washing with water because of boron leaching and dissolving (21, 22)."
[20] "For example, the water-treated B/S-1 catalyst was markedly deactivated (Fig. 1C), giving a propane conversion at 1.9%, which is much lower than that of the fresh catalyst (9.2%, 560°C; fig. S11)."
[21] "The BS-1 catalyst retained this ability after the equivalent treatment (Fig. 1C)."
[22] "Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce 10 vol% water in the gas."
[23] "As shown in Fig. 1D, the propane conversion and propene and/or ethene selectivities were 32.5% and 53.8% and/or 28.6%, respectively, at the beginning of the reaction."
[24] "Even after reaction for 210 hours, the catalyst still exhibited propane conversion at 43.7%, with propene and ethene selectivities at 53.3 and 29.5%, respectively, showing the good durability of the BS-1 catalyst in the ODHP."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditionally, propene has been produced through steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha, which has proven insufficient to meet the high demand for propene, estimated at 116 million tons in 2020. Shale gas, rich in propane, has emerged as a promising alternative to reduce dependence on petroleum for propene production. However, nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane faces challenges due to thermodynamically favorable coke formation and metal sintering, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration. On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages with exothermic features and hindrance of coke formation, yet it is prone to overoxidation, leading to the formation of valueless CO2. Recent advancements have focused on catalysts containing boron, specifically those with isolated boron species. These catalysts, like the BS-1 catalyst, exhibit high activity and selectivity for ODHP, producing propene and ethene as valuable products. The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized using a solvent-free crystallization process, and its structure and composition were characterized through various analytical techniques. In ODHP experiments, the BS-1 catalyst demonstrated superior performance, achieving propane conversions up to 44% with selectivities for propene and ethene exceeding 80%. Importantly, the BS-1 catalyst retained its high activity and selectivity even after a 210-hour continuous test, showcasing its exceptional durability and water tolerance, which sets it apart from traditional supported boron catalysts that are often deactivated by water washing due to boron leaching and dissolution.

丙烯需求的增长已经影响了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。传统上，丙烯通过石脑油中的重碳氢化合物蒸汽裂解生产，这不足以满足对丙烯的巨大需求，估计在2020年为1.16亿吨。富含丙烷的页岩气已出现作为减少石油依赖以生产丙烯的有前景的替代品。然而，非氧化性丙烷脱氢面临挑战，由于热力学有利的焦炭形成和金属结块，需要频繁更换催化剂。相比之下，氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）具有放热特性和防止焦炭形成的优势，但仍容易过氧化，导致生成无价值的CO2。最近的研究集中在含硼催化剂上，尤其是那些包含孤立硼物种的催化剂。这些催化剂，如BS-1催化剂，在ODHP中表现出高活性和选择性，产生丙烯和乙烯作为有价值的产品。BS-1催化剂通过溶剂自由结晶过程合成，并通过各种分析技术对其结构和组成进行了表征。在ODHP实验中，BS-1催化剂表现出优越的性能，实现了高达44%的丙烷转化率，丙烯和乙烯的选择性超过80%。更重要的是，BS-1催化剂即使在长达210小时的连续测试后仍保持其高活性和选择性，展示了其出色的耐用性和水容忍度，这与传统的由于硼溶解而容易被水清洗导致活性丧失的硼基催化剂形成鲜明对比。
