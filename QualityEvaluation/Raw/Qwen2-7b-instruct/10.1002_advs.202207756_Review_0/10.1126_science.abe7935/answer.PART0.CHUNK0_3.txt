[1] "Propene (14) has been extensively used as a building unit for the production of plastics, fibers, and intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals."
[2] "The current method for propene production predominantly relies on the steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha, but production using this method is still far from meeting the demands for propene, 116,000,000 tons in 2020."
[3] "Recently, shale gas, which contains abundant propane, has been regarded as a promising source for propene to reduce dependence on petroleum."
[4] "Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as industrial technologies such as Oleflex by Honeywell UOP and Catofin by ABB Lumus (1, 2, 59) have been developed, but these have insufficient lifetimes because of thermodynamically favorable coke formation and metal sintering, which require frequent catalyst regeneration."
[5] "By contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has substantial advantages regarding exothermic features and hindrance of coke formation but is easily overoxidized to form valueless CO2 (1018), and this remains a challenge for practical applications."
[6] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."
[7] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days."
[8] "For comparison, we also loaded the boron species on S-1 zeolite (B/S-1) and amorphous silica (B/SiO2) by impregnation (fig. S7), with Si/B ratios of 50 and 66, respectively."
[9] "The catalytic ODHP was performed in a fixed-bed reactor containing a feed gas of propane and oxygen (C3H8/O2/He = 1/1/8) with a weight-hour-space-velocity (WHSV, LC3H8 kgcatalyst−1 h−1) of 3600 L kg−1 h−1."
[10] "Figure 1A shows the dependence of propane conversion on reaction temperature over various catalysts."
[11] "For example, 23.8 and 41.4% of propane conversions were realized on the BS-1 catalyst at 540 and 560°C, respectively."
[12] "Under these reaction conditions, the one-pass yield of olefins reached 33.6% (22.7% for propene and 10.9% for ethene)."
[13] "The BS-1 catalyst retained this ability after the equivalent treatment (Fig. 1C)."
[14] "Even after reaction for 210 hours, the catalyst still exhibited propane conversion at 43.7%, with propene and ethene selectivities at 53.3 and 29.5%, respectively, showing the good durability of the BS-1 catalyst in the ODHP."
[15] "This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (figs. S37 and S38), giving good durability in the reaction process."
[16] "In addition, even if a small amount of B(OH)3 species exists on BS-1, such a species would not contribute to propane conversion, as supported by the extremely low activity of the B/S-1 catalyst (boric acid loaded on S-1 zeolite; Fig. 1A)."
[17] "For the catalyst with a dihydroxyl group on boron, O2 and C3H8 were initially coadsorbed on one hydroxyl group through weak van der Waals interaction (R; figs. S51 and S52)."
[18] "In this case, the constructed eight-member ring in the transition state by three hydrogen bonds benefits the synergistic conversion of O2 (3Σg) and propane through the decreasing of energy barriers, indicating the importance of B(OH)2 groups and the nearby silanol species (figs. S53 and S54)."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift is due to the limitations of traditional methods, such as steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha, which cannot meet the demands for propene production. Shale gas, which contains abundant propane, has become a promising source for propene production to reduce dependence on petroleum. Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as industrial technologies, but they suffer from issues like coke formation and metal sintering, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of exothermic features and the hindrance of coke formation. However, it is easily overoxidized, posing a challenge for practical applications. Recent research has reported a new active center in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for ODHP, featuring isolated boron species. This catalyst maintains high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime, demonstrating substantial improvements in ODHP technology.

The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized using a solvent-free crystallization strategy. It was compared with B/S-1 and B/SiO2 catalysts, both loaded with boron species through impregnation. The ODHP was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor with a feed gas composition of propane and oxygen. The BS-1 catalyst showed high propane conversion, with selectivities for propene and ethene reaching 53.3% and 29.5%, respectively, after 210 hours of reaction. This indicates the good durability of the BS-1 catalyst in ODHP. The catalyst's structure was found to hinder full hydrolysis of boron species, contributing to its water tolerance and stability. Research suggests that the B(OH)2 groups and nearby silanol species play a crucial role in the reaction pathway, highlighting the importance of tuning the coordination environment for improving catalyst performance.

丙烯需求的增长影响了新型生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这一转变是因为传统方法如重质碳氢化合物裂解制丙烯无法满足丙烯生产的需要。含有丰富丙烷的页岩气已成为减少对石油依赖、生产丙烯的有前景来源。非氧化性丙烷脱氢已作为工业技术出现，但它们面临着焦炭形成和金属结块的问题，需要频繁更换催化剂。氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）在热力学特征和焦炭形成抑制方面具有优势。然而，它容易过氧化，这仍然是实际应用中的挑战。最近的研究报道了一种新的活性中心，在沸石MFI框架（BS-1）中用于ODHP，该中心包含孤立的硼物种。这种催化剂在连续测试中维持高活性和选择性长达210小时，表明在ODHP技术上取得了重大进展。

BS-1催化剂通过无溶剂结晶策略合成。与B/S-1和B/SiO2催化剂进行了比较，后者通过浸渍加载了硼物种。在固定床反应器中进行ODHP，采用丙烷和氧气作为反应气体组成。BS-1催化剂显示出高的丙烷转化率，丙烯和乙烯的选择性分别达到53.3%和29.5%，经过210小时的反应。这表明BS-1催化剂在ODHP中的耐久性良好。催化剂结构被发现可以防止硼物种的完全水解，从而贡献了其对水的耐受性和稳定性。研究指出，B(OH)2组分及其附近的硅醇基团在反应途径中起着关键作用，强调了调整配合环境以提高催化剂性能的重要性。
