          The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), leading to advancements in catalyst technology. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, addressing the ongoing debate about active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by focusing on the role of single co sites in ordered SiO2 channels, which has been shown to boost nonoxidative PDH.
