Answer: The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the search for more efficient and selective catalysts. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly over time, addressing the ongoing debate about active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by focusing on the role of single co sites in ordered SiO2 channels, which has been shown to boost nonoxidative PDH.
