[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[2] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[3] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."
[4] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[5] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[6] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices. This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."
[7] "For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."
[8] "The global demand of propylene was 103 million tons that year and is expected to increase by 45% on a yearly basis."
[9] "Literally dozens of new installations have been planned or are already under construction, amounting to an additional 14 million tons of propylene to be produced annually by 2018."
[10] "Furthermore, in Table 2, a comparison is made between the two most important processes, Catofin and Oleflex."
[11] "The STAR (UHDE) process will be applied for the first time in two installations in the Middle East."
[12] "Moreover, alkane conversion has been found to be inversely proportional to space velocity, and selectivity has been found to be directly proportional to alkene selectivity."
[13] "In studies where Cr/Al2O3 catalysts were used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, it was found that when the space velocity (GHSV) decreased from 3600 to 600 h−1, ethane conversion increased from 27.6% to 31.4%, while selectivity to ethylene decreased from 91.7% to 64.9%."
[14] "Indeed, experiments performed using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), shown in Figure 17, revealed that the weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages (10–40 min) of the reaction, no additional carbon being deposited after this time."
[15] "The authors argue that strong acid sites are rapidly deactivated, inhibiting cracking reactions and favoring the production of the alkene."

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by providing a profitable market for the conversion of propane into propylene. The shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States has been driven by the abundance and affordability of ethane from shale gas production. The profitability of PDH is heavily influenced by the price difference between propane and propylene, making it a lucrative process under current market conditions.

2. The increase in demand for butadiene, coupled with the decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has led to significant investments in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan. This is a direct response to the economic benefits derived from converting butane into butadiene.

3. The Star process, developed by Uhde, uses a different reactor setup for dehydrogenation, employing a fixed bed reactor system with two separate reactors placed in series. One is a top-fired tubular reformer-type reactor, heated by an oven, and the other is an oxyreactor where an oxygen and steam mixture is used to selectively combust part of the hydrogen formed, shifting the equilibrium towards higher olefin yields. 

4. The relationship between alkane conversion and space velocity is inversely proportional, while the relationship between alkene selectivity and alkane conversion is directly proportional. This means that lowering the space velocity can increase alkane conversion but decrease alkene selectivity, and vice versa.

5. The Star process has been applied for the first time in two installations in the Middle East, indicating its potential for wider adoption in regions with abundant natural resources.

6. The presence of strong acid sites on catalysts can rapidly deactivate, inhibiting cracking reactions and favoring the production of the alkene during dehydrogenation processes.

1. 对丙烯的需求增长推动了新型生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），为将丙烷转化为丙烯提供了有利的市场。美国从页岩气中获得的乙烷的丰富性和经济性导致了蒸汽裂解装置从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩气的乙烷，这推动了PDH的发展。PDH的盈利能力主要取决于丙烷和丙烯的价格差异，当前的市场条件非常有利。

2. 随着丁二烯需求的增加以及裂解成本的上升，对丁烷脱氢（BDH）的新投资在中美日等国激增。这是通过将丁烷转化为丁二烯来获取经济利益的结果。

3. Uhde开发的Star过程使用了不同的反应器设置进行脱氢，采用两段串联的固定床反应器系统。第一段是顶部加热的管式重整器类型反应器，由烤箱提供热量，第二段是氧反应器，在其中使用氧气和蒸汽混合物选择性地燃烧部分生成的氢，从而向更高的烯烃产率方向移动平衡。

4. 空间速度与烷烃转化率成反比，而乙烯选择性与烷烃转化率成正比。这意味着降低空间速度可以增加烷烃转化率但降低乙烯选择性，反之亦然。

5. Star过程首次在中东的两个安装中应用，显示了其在资源丰富的地区广泛应用的潜力。

6. 强酸性位点的存在可以使催化剂快速失活，抑制裂解反应并有利于烯烃的生成。
