[7] "For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."
[8] "The global demand of propylene was 103 million tons that year and is expected to increase by 45% on a yearly basis."
[9] "Literally dozens of new installations have been planned or are already under construction, amounting to an additional 14 million tons of propylene to be produced annually by 2018."

[14] "Indeed, experiments performed using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), shown in Figure 17, revealed that the weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages (10–40 min) of the reaction, no additional carbon being deposited after this time."
[15] "The authors argue that strong acid sites are rapidly deactivated, inhibiting cracking reactions and favoring the production of the alkene."

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by providing a profitable market for the conversion of propane into propylene. The shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States has been driven by the abundance and affordability of ethane from shale gas production. The profitability of PDH is heavily influenced by the price difference between propane and propylene, making it a lucrative process under current market conditions.

2. The increase in demand for butadiene, coupled with the decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has led to significant investments in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan. This is a direct response to the economic benefits derived from converting butane into butadiene.

3. The Star process, developed by Uhde, uses a different reactor setup for dehydrogenation, employing a fixed bed reactor system with two separate reactors placed in series. One is a top-fired tubular reformer-type reactor, heated by an oven, and the other is an oxyreactor where an oxygen and steam mixture is used to selectively combust part of the hydrogen formed, shifting the equilibrium towards higher olefin yields. 

4. The relationship between alkane conversion and space velocity is inversely proportional, while the relationship between alkene selectivity and alkane conversion is directly proportional. This means that lowering the space velocity can increase alkane conversion but decrease alkene selectivity, and vice versa.

5. The Star process has been applied for the first time in two installations in the Middle East, indicating its potential for wider adoption in regions with abundant natural resources.

6. The presence of strong acid sites on catalysts can rapidly deactivate, inhibiting cracking reactions and favoring the production of the alkene during dehydrogenation processes.

1. 对丙烯的需求增长推动了新型生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），为将丙烷转化为丙烯提供了有利的市场。美国从页岩气中获得的乙烷的丰富性和经济性导致了蒸汽裂解装置从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩气的乙烷，这推动了PDH的发展。PDH的盈利能力主要取决于丙烷和丙烯的价格差异，当前的市场条件非常有利。

2. 随着丁二烯需求的增加以及裂解成本的上升，对丁烷脱氢（BDH）的新投资在中美日等国激增。这是通过将丁烷转化为丁二烯来获取经济利益的结果。

3. Uhde开发的Star过程使用了不同的反应器设置进行脱氢，采用两段串联的固定床反应器系统。第一段是顶部加热的管式重整器类型反应器，由烤箱提供热量，第二段是氧反应器，在其中使用氧气和蒸汽混合物选择性地燃烧部分生成的氢，从而向更高的烯烃产率方向移动平衡。

4. 空间速度与烷烃转化率成反比，而乙烯选择性与烷烃转化率成正比。这意味着降低空间速度可以增加烷烃转化率但降低乙烯选择性，反之亦然。

5. Star过程首次在中东的两个安装中应用，显示了其在资源丰富的地区广泛应用的潜力。

6. 强酸性位点的存在可以使催化剂快速失活，抑制裂解反应并有利于烯烃的生成。

[3] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."
[4] "Akin to Al2O3, Ga2O3 has different polymorphs of which β-Ga2O3 is not only the most stable, but also the most active Ga species in PDH according to some authors."

[6] "This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity."
[7] "The heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism has been proposed where H adsorbs on a Ga+ Lewis acid site and C3H7+ on a neighboring oxygen, although these species can also be adsorbed reversed."
[8] "The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., (232) who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The abundance of shale gas in the United States has made it a low-cost source for chemical production. The shift from traditional oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations has created a surplus of ethane and a scarcity of propylene, which has increased its price and created opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies like PDH. The profitability of PDH is heavily influenced by the price gap between propane and propylene, which is currently very favorable. The PDH process converts light paraffins into olefins, providing key components for the chemical industry. This has led to significant investments in new PDH installations in the US and other countries, taking advantage of the abundant and cheap ethane supply from shale gas.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Recent research has contributed to the debate about the active Ga species. Studies have identified the importance of the structure of these catalysts, highlighting the need for a highly dispersed active phase. The nature of the active sites, their coordination, and nuclearity have been critical factors in determining the catalytic activity. The debate revolves around the identification of the most active Ga species and how they contribute to the overall catalytic performance. Recent findings have shed light on the role of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ species, suggesting they play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation reaction. These catalysts have shown high activity and selectivity towards the production of olefins, which has advanced the field of PDH technology. However, the exact mechanisms behind the activity and selectivity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are still under investigation, and ongoing research aims to refine and optimize these catalysts for better performance.

[1] "Due to the growing demand for propylene, alternative methods for obtaining olefins, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), have become increasingly competitive relative to more traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking."
[2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[3] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
[4] "Coke deposition represents an additional challenge, as coke deposition increases when the hydrogen partial pressure drops."
[5] "Recent reports suggest that in the near future, operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control."
[6] "For both the Pt and the CrOx formulations used industrially, the elimination of coke from the surface of the spent catalysts may result in irreversible catalyst deactivation if the regeneration conditions are not carefully controlled."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in alternative production methods like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Despite significant attention given to metal oxides like GaOx, MoOx, and VOx as catalysts, a practical alternative to the widely used PtSn and CrOx systems has not been identified. Solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2 and In2O3, are being explored as potential alternatives for selectively oxidizing hydrogen produced during reactions. Challenges like coke deposition and maintaining hydrogen partial pressures are being addressed through the development of operando spectroscopy techniques for more precise process control. Irreversible catalyst deactivation during coke removal remains a concern, highlighting the importance of careful control of regeneration conditions.

[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[2] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[3] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[4] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[5] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."
[6] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[7] "The global demand of propylene was 103 million tons that year and is expected to increase by 45% on a yearly basis."
[8] "Literally dozens of new installations have been planned or are already under construction, amounting to an additional 14 million tons of propylene to be produced annually by 2018."
[9] "For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."
[10] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[11] "A Catofin installation generally consists of 58 parallel adiabatic fixed bed reactors containing a chromiaalumina catalyst."
[12] "A schematic representation is shown in Figure 3."
[13] "The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span."
[14] "Moreover, fuel gas is added to the reactor during the regeneration step to generate supplementary heat, (47) and inert material is added to the catalyst bed to increase its heat storage capacity."
[15] "Moreover, these spinels also curtail the sintering of platinum due to a strong metalsupport interaction."
[16] "The authors suggest that in the presence of K, zeolite L can stabilize small PtSn particles in the micropores of the support."
[17] "The authors claim that the replacement of the framework Al3+ for Fe3+ ions is essential for the Pt precursor to anchor inside the 10-member ring zeolite channels, which in turn is necessary to obtain subnanometric Pt clusters after reduction."
