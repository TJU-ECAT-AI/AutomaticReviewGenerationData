[1] "The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which converts propane to propylene."
[2] "The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was debate about the active Ga species."
[3] "Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. These catalysts show high activity and stability."
[4] "However, the debate continues about the exact active Ga species involved in the dehydrogenation reaction."

1. The rising demand for propylene has prompted the development of new production techniques, with propane dehydrogenation (PDH) being a key method that transforms propane into propylene.
2. The comprehension of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has advanced substantially. At first, there was a contentious discussion about the active Ga species responsible for the reaction.
3. Recent studies have augmented our current understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, revealing their high level of activity and durability.
4. Yet, the debate around the precise active Ga species that drives the dehydrogenation process persists.
