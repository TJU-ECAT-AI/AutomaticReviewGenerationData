[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[2] "In fact, the United States already obtains one-quarter of their natural gas production from shale gas deposits, and this is expected to rise even further in the coming years due to the emphasis that is being given to the attainment of energy independence."
[3] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[4] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."
[5] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[6] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
[7] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[8] "Moreover, the products made by these olefins are shown in the graph to the right."
[9] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[10] "In fact, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
[11] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[12] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The abundance of shale gas in the United States has made it a low-cost source for chemical production. The shift from traditional oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations has created a surplus of ethane and a scarcity of propylene, which has increased its price and created opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies like PDH. The profitability of PDH is heavily influenced by the price gap between propane and propylene, which is currently very favorable. The PDH process converts light paraffins into olefins, providing key components for the chemical industry. This has led to significant investments in new PDH installations in the US and other countries, taking advantage of the abundant and cheap ethane supply from shale gas.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Recent research has contributed to the debate about the active Ga species. Studies have identified the importance of the structure of these catalysts, highlighting the need for a highly dispersed active phase. The nature of the active sites, their coordination, and nuclearity have been critical factors in determining the catalytic activity. The debate revolves around the identification of the most active Ga species and how they contribute to the overall catalytic performance. Recent findings have shed light on the role of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ species, suggesting they play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation reaction. These catalysts have shown high activity and selectivity towards the production of olefins, which has advanced the field of PDH technology. However, the exact mechanisms behind the activity and selectivity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are still under investigation, and ongoing research aims to refine and optimize these catalysts for better performance.

丙烯需求的增长极大地影响了新型生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。美国丰富的页岩气使其成为化学生产的低成本来源。从传统的石油基石脑油转向页岩气乙烷作为蒸汽裂解安装的原料，导致乙烷过剩和丙烯短缺，推高了丙烯价格，并为PDH等目的性催化技术创造了机会。PDH过程将轻烷烃转化为烯烃，为化工行业提供了关键成分。这促使美国和其他国家对新PDH装置进行了大量投资，利用页岩气丰富的廉价乙烷供应。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已经显著发展。最近的研究贡献了关于活性Ga物种的辩论。研究强调了这些催化剂结构的重要性，指出高度分散的活性相至关重要。活性位点的性质、配位和核数是确定催化活性的关键因素。争论围绕最活跃的Ga物种及其对总体催化性能的贡献。最近的研究揭示了协调不饱和Ga3+物种在脱氢反应中的重要作用。这些催化剂显示出高活性和选择性地产生烯烃，推动了PDH技术的进步。然而，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的活性和选择性的具体机制仍在调查中，正在进行的研究旨在优化这些催化剂以提高性能。
