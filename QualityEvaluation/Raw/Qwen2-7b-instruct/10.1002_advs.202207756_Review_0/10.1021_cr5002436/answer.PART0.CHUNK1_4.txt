[1] "Due to the growing demand for propylene, alternative methods for obtaining olefins, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), have become increasingly competitive relative to more traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking."
[2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[3] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
[4] "Coke deposition represents an additional challenge, as coke deposition increases when the hydrogen partial pressure drops."
[5] "Recent reports suggest that in the near future, operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control."
[6] "For both the Pt and the CrOx formulations used industrially, the elimination of coke from the surface of the spent catalysts may result in irreversible catalyst deactivation if the regeneration conditions are not carefully controlled."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in alternative production methods like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Despite significant attention given to metal oxides like GaOx, MoOx, and VOx as catalysts, a practical alternative to the widely used PtSn and CrOx systems has not been identified. Solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2 and In2O3, are being explored as potential alternatives for selectively oxidizing hydrogen produced during reactions. Challenges like coke deposition and maintaining hydrogen partial pressures are being addressed through the development of operando spectroscopy techniques for more precise process control. Irreversible catalyst deactivation during coke removal remains a concern, highlighting the importance of careful control of regeneration conditions.

由于对丙烯的高需求，丙烷脱氢（PDH）等替代生产方法越来越与传统的催化裂化和蒸汽裂解方法竞争。尽管金属氧化物如GaOx、MoOx和VOx等催化剂受到了大量关注，但到目前为止还没有找到取代PtSn和CrOx系统的实用替代品。CeO2、SbO4、In2O3、WO3、PbOx、Tl2O3和BiO3等固体氧载体正被研究用于选择性氧化反应中产生的氢气。通过开发原位光谱技术来精确控制过程，挑战如焦炭沉积和保持氢分压的问题正在得到解决。在去除焦炭过程中催化剂不可逆失活的风险提示了严格控制再生条件的重要性。
