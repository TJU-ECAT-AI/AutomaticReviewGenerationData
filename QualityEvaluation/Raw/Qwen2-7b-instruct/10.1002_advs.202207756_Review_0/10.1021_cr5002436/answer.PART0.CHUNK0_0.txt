[1] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."
[2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[3] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
[4] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[5] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."
[6] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[7] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."

1. Various factors, such as high energy consumption, low selectivity in olefin production, diminishing crude oil resources, and escalating oil prices, are prompting the petrochemical sector to explore more cost-effective feedstocks and efficient conversion methods.

2. There has been a steady increase in demand for these fundamental components in recent years, with all significant markets experiencing positive growth in demand and production, except for the Eurozone due to the economic downturn.

3. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has advanced significantly, enabling the extraction of substantial volumes of shale gas at a competitive cost.

4. The surge in shale gas production has led to a 75% decline in gas costs compared to 2005 levels, making this natural gas resource appealing for both energy generation and chemical manufacturing.

5. The upsurge in shale gas production in the United States has transformed it into the world's leading low-cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, evidenced by 126 investment projects worth $84 billion up to September 2013, tracked by the American Chemistry Council.

6. The abundance of affordable natural gas liquids, particularly ethane, has prompted a switch from naphtha-based steam cracking to ethane-based processes in the US, with ethane crackers being established and naphtha crackers being either decommissioned or adapted.

7. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is largely influenced by the price disparity between propane and propylene, which currently favors the process due to favorable market conditions.

1. 多个因素，包括高能耗、特定烯烃生产的低选择性、石油资源的减少和油价的上涨，促使石油化工行业探索更经济的原料和更高效的转化技术。

2. 这些基础组件的需求在过去几年中稳步增长，所有主要市场的需求和产量均呈现正增长趋势，除了欧元区，这主要是由于近期经济衰退的影响。

3. 水力压裂或压裂技术取得了显著进步，使得以较低成本提取大量页岩气成为可能。

4. 页岩气产量的激增导致天然气价格相对于2005年的水平下降了75%，使其作为能源来源和用于生产运输燃料或化学制品的原料变得极具吸引力。

5. 美国页岩气产量的快速增长使其转变为全球领先的中东以外低成本化工生产商，美国在截至2013年9月的126个总投资项目中投入了840亿美元，由美国化学理事会追踪。

6. 由于乙烷的丰富供应和相对低廉的价格，美国从基于石脑油的蒸汽裂解转向使用乙烷的裂解过程，乙烷裂解厂正在建设中，而石脑油裂解厂则要么被关闭，要么进行了改造。

7. 丙烷脱氢的盈利能力很大程度上取决于丙烷与丙烯之间的价格差异，目前市场条件非常有利，这有利于该过程。
