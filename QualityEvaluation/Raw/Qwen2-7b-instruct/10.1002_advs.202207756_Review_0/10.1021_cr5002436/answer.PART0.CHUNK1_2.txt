1. The increasing demand for propylene has prompted the creation of new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

2. There has been renewed interest in gallium oxide-based catalysts for PDH in recent years.

3. The precise nature of the active sites in gallium-based dehydrogenation catalysts remains uncertain.

4. Like aluminum oxide, gallium oxide comes in different polymorphs, with β-Ga2O3 being both the most stable and the most active form for PDH, according to some researchers.

5. β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure with gallium atoms arranged in tetrahedral and octahedral configurations.

6. This structure features a high density of weak Lewis acid sites, primarily coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral gallium ions, which are believed to drive the dehydrogenation process.

7. A heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism is proposed, where hydrogen binds to a gallium Lewis acid site and a hydrocarbon fragment to an adjacent oxygen, although they can also bind in reverse.

8. The role of Lewis acid sites as the active catalyst was supported by Chen et al., who demonstrated that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups, specifically coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral gallium ions, is essential for dehydrogenation activity through NH3-TPD analysis and activity data comparisons.

9. Acidic sites were found to catalyze the reaction, as evidenced by Michorczyk et al.'s observation that promoting the catalyst with a base led to a decline in activity.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，已经发展出了新的生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。

2. 在最近几年，对镓氧化物基催化剂用于PDH产生了新的兴趣。

3. 关于镓基脱氢催化剂中活性位点的确切性质仍存在争议。

4. 就像铝氧化物一样，镓氧化物有多种晶相，其中β-Ga2O3不仅是最稳定的，也是PDH中最活跃的镓物种，根据一些研究人员的说法。

5. β-Ga2O3具有单斜结构，其中镓原子在四面体和八面体配置之间等量分布。

6. 这种结构具有高浓度的弱路易斯酸位点，主要是协调不饱和四面体镓离子，被认为是脱氢作用的中心。

7. 提出了一个异裂解反应机制，其中氢与镓路易斯酸位点结合，碳氢化合物片段与相邻的氧结合，尽管它们也可以逆向结合。

8. 通过NH3-TPD分析和活性数据比较，陈等人证明了大量路易斯酸位点，特别是协调不饱和四面体镓离子，对于脱氢活性是必要的。

9. 通过观察促进催化剂与钾等碱基的反应导致活性下降，Michorczyk等人发现酸性位点催化了该反应。
