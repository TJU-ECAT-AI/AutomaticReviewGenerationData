1. The increasing demand for propylene has spurred the creation of more efficient production techniques, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift has also advanced the comprehension of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, particularly concerning the discussion around the active Ga species. Recent studies have provided insights into the mechanisms involved in PDH over Pt catalysts, enriching our current understanding of these catalysts.
