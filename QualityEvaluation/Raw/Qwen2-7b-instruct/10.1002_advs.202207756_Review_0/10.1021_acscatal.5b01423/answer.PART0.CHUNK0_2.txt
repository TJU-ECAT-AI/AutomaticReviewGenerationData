Answer: The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the need for more efficient and selective catalytic processes. This has led to advancements in catalyst design and understanding of their reaction mechanisms. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, with ongoing debates focusing on the active Ga species involved in the catalytic process. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, shedding light on their structure, activity, and selectivity, which are crucial for improving PDH efficiency and propylene yield.
