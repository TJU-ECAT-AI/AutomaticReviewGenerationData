[1] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."
[2] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."

[5] "Recently, novel preparation methods have been developed to improve the propylene productivity by constructing ultrasmall PtZn bimetal nanoclusters by embedding them inside S-1 zeolites.25,26 However, due to the very complex coordination structures in zeolites, e.g., the coexistence of PtO, PtPt, and PtZn coordinations, it is very difficult to identify the active site structures, regardless of experimental and theoretical simulations."
[6] "This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn intermetallic alloys, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C. No obvious deactivation was observed within the 160-h industrial PDH test."
[7] "Based on in situ X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, and density functional theory calculations, it is further revealed that surface [PtZn4] ensembles in Pt1Zn1 (110) serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promote desorption of the surface-bounded propylene and improve the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn atoms via structural ordering."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies, particularly focusing on utilizing light alkanes like natural gas and shale gas. The use of larger active site ensembles catalyzes structure-sensitive side reactions such as cracking and deep dehydrogenation, producing undesirable C1 and C2 molecules and coke. Active site isolation strategies, especially those involving single-atom catalysts (SACs), have proven effective in mitigating these issues. However, SACs based on materials like Pt/Cu exhibit poor stability due to thermal and chemical instabilities. Recent advancements involve constructing ultrasmall PtZn bimetal nanoclusters within zeolites to enhance propylene productivity. Despite the complexity of coordination structures in zeolites, identifying active site structures remains challenging. The paper described in the literature introduces a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst, which achieves over 95% propylene selectivity across a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C. The active site structures are identified as surface [PtZn4] ensembles in Pt1Zn1 (110), which promote the desorption of surface-bound propylene and improve stability through preventing coke formation and maintaining the structural ordering of Pt and Zn atoms.

需求的增长导致丙烯生产技术，特别是使用轻烷烃如天然气和页岩气的丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术的发展。较大的活性位点集会导致结构敏感的副反应，如裂解和深度脱氢，产生不良的C1和C2分子以及焦炭。通过活性位点隔离策略，尤其是单原子催化剂（SACs），已经证明了有效缓解这些问题。然而，基于材料如Pt/Cu的SACs显示出较差的稳定性，这是由于热稳定性和化学不稳定性。最近的研究涉及在沸石内构建超小的PtZn双金属纳米簇以提高丙烯产率。尽管沸石中的复杂配位结构仍然存在挑战，但在实验和理论模拟中确定活性位点结构仍然困难。文献中描述的论文引入了一种选择性和超稳定的单个站点[PtZn4]催化剂，能够在520°C到620°C的宽温度范围内实现超过95%的丙烯选择性。活性位点结构被识别为Pt1Zn1（110）表面上的[PtZn4]簇，这些簇促进表面吸附的丙烯的脱附并通过防止焦炭形成和保持Pt和Zn原子的结构排序来提高稳定性。
