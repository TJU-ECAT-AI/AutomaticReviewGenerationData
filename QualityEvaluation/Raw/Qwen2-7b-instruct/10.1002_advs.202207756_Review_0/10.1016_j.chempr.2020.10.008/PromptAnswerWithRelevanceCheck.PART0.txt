[1] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing develop-ment of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."
[2] "Isolating active metal components into single atoms can maximize atomic efficiency, and the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions with unprecedented selectivity."
[3] "The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures."
[4] "For example, the isolated Pt1 site in Pt/Cu single-atom alloy (SAA) can only interact with a single Pt atom for the deep dehydrogenated C3H5, a model pre- cursor of coke formation, instead of three more stable PtC interactions on a 3-fold Pt3 hollow site over Pt (111), leading to less carbon deposition."
[5] "The catalyst enables more than 95% of propylene selectivity from 520C to 620C. No obvious deac- tivation is observed within the 160-h test, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts."
[6] "Based on in situ X-ray ab- sorption fine structure, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measure- ments, and density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes the first and second C H cleavage of propane but inhibits further dehydrogenation of sur- face-bounded propylene."
[7] "In contrast, for the PtSn/Al2O3"

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the shift from naphtha to light alkanes as feedstock. The emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas have accelerated the adoption of PDH technologies. High reaction temperatures in PDH processes often lead to cracking and coking, which are significant challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. To address these challenges, the focus has shifted towards isolating active metal components into single atoms, thereby maximizing atomic efficiency and enhancing selectivity through unprecedented inhibition of structure-sensitive side reactions.

2. Recent research has explored the use of atomically ordered intermetallic alloys, such as PtZn, to create single-site catalysts that enable high propylene selectivity over a broad temperature range. These catalysts offer superior stability and selectivity compared to traditional Pt-based catalysts, with minimal deactivation observed even after extensive industrial testing. The active site structures identified in PtZn intermetallic alloys, specifically surface [PtZn4] ensembles, play a crucial role in promoting propylene production and preventing coke formation, thereby improving the stability and selectivity of the catalysts.

3. The development of highly efficient and stable single-site catalysts, particularly those containing PtZn intermetallic alloys, remains a significant challenge in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. While advancements have been made in creating single-atom catalysts (SACs) that maximize atomic efficiency and inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions, there is still a need for further research to identify clear active site structures and enhance propylene productivity. The use of atomically ordered intermetallic alloys offers a promising approach to achieving these goals by dispersing active sites into isolated Pt1 sites, providing enhanced thermal stability, and facilitating the creation of catalysts with improved selectivity and stability.

1. 随着对丙烯需求的增长，以及页岩气和天然气供应量的增加，从石脑油转向轻烷烃作为原料，导致了定向生产丙烯（PDH）技术的发展。高反应温度在PDH过程中会导致裂解和结焦，这是在高温下进行烷烃脱氢的挑战。为了应对这些挑战，研究重点转向将活性金属成分分离为单原子，以最大化原子效率，并通过前所未有的方式抑制结构敏感的副反应，从而提高选择性。

2. 最近的研究探索了使用原子有序的互金属合金，如PtZn，来创建单原子催化剂，这些催化剂能够在广泛的温度范围内实现高丙烯选择性。与传统的Pt基催化剂相比，这些催化剂表现出优越的稳定性和选择性，在工业操作条件下长时间测试后几乎没有明显的失活现象。在Pt1Zn1（110）表面发现的活性位点结构在促进丙烯生成并防止结焦形成中起着关键作用，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

3. 在高温下进行烷烃脱氢时，开发高效稳定的单原子催化剂，特别是包含PtZn互金属合金的催化剂，仍然是一个重大挑战。虽然已经取得了在最大化原子效率和抑制结构敏感副反应的同时创造单原子催化剂的进展，但仍然需要进一步的研究来明确活性位点结构并提高丙烯产率。通过使用原子有序的互金属合金，可以通过分散成孤立的Pt1位点提供增强的热稳定性，并促进具有改进稳定性和选择性的催化剂的创造。

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies, particularly focusing on utilizing light alkanes like natural gas and shale gas. The use of larger active site ensembles catalyzes structure-sensitive side reactions such as cracking and deep dehydrogenation, producing undesirable C1 and C2 molecules and coke. Active site isolation strategies, especially those involving single-atom catalysts (SACs), have proven effective in mitigating these issues. However, SACs based on materials like Pt/Cu exhibit poor stability due to thermal and chemical instabilities. Recent advancements involve constructing ultrasmall PtZn bimetal nanoclusters within zeolites to enhance propylene productivity. Despite the complexity of coordination structures in zeolites, identifying active site structures remains challenging. The paper described in the literature introduces a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst, which achieves over 95% propylene selectivity across a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C. The active site structures are identified as surface [PtZn4] ensembles in Pt1Zn1 (110), which promote the desorption of surface-bound propylene and improve stability through preventing coke formation and maintaining the structural ordering of Pt and Zn atoms.

需求的增长导致丙烯生产技术，特别是使用轻烷烃如天然气和页岩气的丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术的发展。较大的活性位点集会导致结构敏感的副反应，如裂解和深度脱氢，产生不良的C1和C2分子以及焦炭。通过活性位点隔离策略，尤其是单原子催化剂（SACs），已经证明了有效缓解这些问题。然而，基于材料如Pt/Cu的SACs显示出较差的稳定性，这是由于热稳定性和化学不稳定性。最近的研究涉及在沸石内构建超小的PtZn双金属纳米簇以提高丙烯产率。尽管沸石中的复杂配位结构仍然存在挑战，但在实验和理论模拟中确定活性位点结构仍然困难。文献中描述的论文引入了一种选择性和超稳定的单个站点[PtZn4]催化剂，能够在520°C到620°C的宽温度范围内实现超过95%的丙烯选择性。活性位点结构被识别为Pt1Zn1（110）表面上的[PtZn4]簇，这些簇促进表面吸附的丙烯的脱附并通过防止焦炭形成和保持Pt和Zn原子的结构排序来提高稳定性。
