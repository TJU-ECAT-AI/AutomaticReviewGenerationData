[1] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing develop-ment of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."
[2] "Isolating active metal components into single atoms can maximize atomic efficiency, and the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions with unprecedented selectivity."
[3] "The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures."
[4] "For example, the isolated Pt1 site in Pt/Cu single-atom alloy (SAA) can only interact with a single Pt atom for the deep dehydrogenated C3H5, a model pre- cursor of coke formation, instead of three more stable PtC interactions on a 3-fold Pt3 hollow site over Pt (111), leading to less carbon deposition."
[5] "The catalyst enables more than 95% of propylene selectivity from 520C to 620C. No obvious deac- tivation is observed within the 160-h test, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts."
[6] "Based on in situ X-ray ab- sorption fine structure, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measure- ments, and density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes the first and second C H cleavage of propane but inhibits further dehydrogenation of sur- face-bounded propylene."
[7] "In contrast, for the PtSn/Al2O3"

1. The shift towards using light alkanes, driven by the growth of shale gas and natural gas availability, has spurred advancements in purpose-built propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies.
2. The strategic placement of active metals into single-atom sites enhances efficiency and prevents structure-sensitive side reactions, offering unparalleled selectivity.
3. Developing highly effective and durable single-atom catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation at high temperatures remains a significant challenge.
4. In the Pt/Cu single-atom alloy (SAA), the isolated Pt1 site selectively interacts with deep dehydrogenated C3H5, reducing carbon deposition compared to interactions at a 3-fold Pt3 hollow site.
5. The [PtZn4] catalyst maintains over 95% propylene selectivity across a broad temperature range from 520°C to 620°C, showing no significant deactivation during a 160-hour test, outperforming PtSn/Al2O3 and other Pt-based catalysts.
6. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn intermetallic alloys act as the key active sites, facilitating the first and second C-H cleavages of propane while hindering further dehydrogenation of surface-bound propylene through their isolated and electron-rich Pt1 sites.
7. The performance of the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst contrasts with the [PtZn4] catalyst in terms of selectivity and stability.

1. 随着页岩气和天然气产量的增加，从石脑油转向轻烷烃作为原料，推动了专门用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术的发展。
2. 将活性金属置于单原子位点可以最大化原子效率，并产生具有前所未有的选择性的单原子催化剂（SACs），抑制结构敏感的副反应。
3. 在高温下开发高效稳定的SACs仍然是烷烃脱氢领域的重大挑战。
4. 在Pt/Cu单原子合金（SAA）中，孤立的Pt1位点仅与深脱氢的C3H5（形成焦炭的模型前体）交互，而不是在Pt（111）上3个更稳定的PtC交互，从而减少碳沉积。
5. 该催化剂在520°C至620°C的温度范围内保持超过95%的丙烯选择性，并在160小时的测试中未观察到明显的失活现象，优于PtSn/Al2O3和其他Pt基催化剂。
6. PtZn互金属合金表面的[PtZn4]簇作为关键活性位点，促进丙烷的第一和第二C-H断裂，同时阻止表面吸附丙烯的进一步脱氢，通过其孤立和电子丰富的Pt1位点。
7. PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的性能与PtZn4催化剂在选择性和稳定性方面存在对比。
