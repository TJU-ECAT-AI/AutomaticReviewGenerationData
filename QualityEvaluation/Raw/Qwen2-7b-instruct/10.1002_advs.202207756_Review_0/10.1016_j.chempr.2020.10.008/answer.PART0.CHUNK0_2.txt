[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology, but high reaction temperatures result in cracking and coking."
[2] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."
[3] "This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn intermetallic alloys, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C."
[4] "The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures."
[5] "By direct H2 temperature-programmed reduction strategy, we successfully constructed PtZn IMAs (molar ratio of Pt:Zn = 1) supported on SiO2, where the H2-rich atmosphere at high temperatures (HT) of 600C contributes to the transformation of disordered PtZn nanoparticles (NPs) into structurally ordered PtZn IMAs."
[6] "The crystalline phase has been transformed from the face-centered cubic (fcc) of Pt to body-centered tetragonal (bct) Pt1Zn1 IMA."
[7] "Compared to Pt/SiO2, AC-HAADF-STEM imaging showed that two atomic plane distances were measured as 0.229 and 0.199 nm, which were in agreement with the lattice spacing along the [111] and [200] directions."
[8] "Optimally, the PtZn/SiO2 with a low loading of 0.1 wt % Pt and 0.17 wt % Zn obtained about 48% of propane conversion and 96% of propylene selectivity at 600C and WHSV of propane = 4 h1."
[9] "Consequently, SiO2-supported PtZn IMAs showed ascendant temperature tolerance ranging from 520C to 620C, enabling over 95% selectivity of C3H6."
[10] "Moreover, the PtZn IMA catalysts ran more than 160 and 100 h of continuous operation with little deactivation at 520C and 575C, respectively."
[11] "After 160 h, dehydrogenation reaction showed a very slight decrease in the conversion of 0.04% per hour, suggesting that only slight deactivation had occurred."

1. The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to address the challenges posed by high reaction temperatures, such as cracking and coking. To mitigate these issues, researchers have focused on developing single-site intermetallic catalysts, like the [PtZn4] catalyst described in the document, which exhibits high propylene selectivity and stability.

2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, particularly regarding the debate over the active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to clarifying the role of Ga in these catalysts, although the document does not specifically discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The focus is on the [PtZn4] catalyst, which demonstrates improved selectivity and stability through its unique structure and composition.

3. The [PtZn4] catalyst achieves high propylene selectivity (over 95%) across a broad temperature range (520°C to 620°C) and maintains stability over extended periods, outperforming other Pt-based catalysts. This makes it a promising solution for the commercial PDH process.

4. The [PtZn4] catalyst was synthesized through a high-temperature hydrogen reduction process, transforming disordered PtZn nanoparticles into structurally ordered Pt1Zn1 intermetallic alloys. This transformation resulted in a body-centered tetragonal (bct) structure, enhancing the catalyst's stability and selectivity.

5. Compared to Pt/SiO2, the PtZn intermetallic catalyst showed distinct atomic structures, with two atomic plane distances measured at 0.229 and 0.199 nm, corresponding to lattice spacings along the [111] and [200] directions, respectively.

6. The optimal loading of 0.1 wt% Pt and 0.17 wt% Zn on SiO2 supported the catalyst's performance, achieving 48% propane conversion and 96% propylene selectivity at 600°C and a weight hourly velocity (WHV) of propane at 4 h^-1.

7. The [PtZn4] catalyst demonstrated excellent temperature tolerance, enabling high propylene selectivity across the range of 520°C to 620°C. Moreover, the catalyst operated for over 160 hours with minimal deactivation, showcasing its industrial viability.

8. The slight decrease in conversion rate of 0.04% per hour after 160 hours of operation indicates that the catalyst experiences only minor deactivation, highlighting its stability and efficiency in the PDH process.
