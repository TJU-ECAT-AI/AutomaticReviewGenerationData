1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the shift from naphtha to light alkanes as feedstock. The emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas have accelerated the adoption of PDH technologies. High reaction temperatures in PDH processes often lead to cracking and coking, which are significant challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. To address these challenges, the focus has shifted towards isolating active metal components into single atoms, thereby maximizing atomic efficiency and enhancing selectivity through unprecedented inhibition of structure-sensitive side reactions.

2. Recent research has explored the use of atomically ordered intermetallic alloys, such as PtZn, to create single-site catalysts that enable high propylene selectivity over a broad temperature range. These catalysts offer superior stability and selectivity compared to traditional Pt-based catalysts, with minimal deactivation observed even after extensive industrial testing. The active site structures identified in PtZn intermetallic alloys, specifically surface [PtZn4] ensembles, play a crucial role in promoting propylene production and preventing coke formation, thereby improving the stability and selectivity of the catalysts.

3. The development of highly efficient and stable single-site catalysts, particularly those containing PtZn intermetallic alloys, remains a significant challenge in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. While advancements have been made in creating single-atom catalysts (SACs) that maximize atomic efficiency and inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions, there is still a need for further research to identify clear active site structures and enhance propylene productivity. The use of atomically ordered intermetallic alloys offers a promising approach to achieving these goals by dispersing active sites into isolated Pt1 sites, providing enhanced thermal stability, and facilitating the creation of catalysts with improved selectivity and stability.

1. 随着对丙烯需求的增长，以及页岩气和天然气供应量的增加，从石脑油转向轻烷烃作为原料，导致了定向生产丙烯（PDH）技术的发展。高反应温度在PDH过程中会导致裂解和结焦，这是在高温下进行烷烃脱氢的挑战。为了应对这些挑战，研究重点转向将活性金属成分分离为单原子，以最大化原子效率，并通过前所未有的方式抑制结构敏感的副反应，从而提高选择性。

2. 最近的研究探索了使用原子有序的互金属合金，如PtZn，来创建单原子催化剂，这些催化剂能够在广泛的温度范围内实现高丙烯选择性。与传统的Pt基催化剂相比，这些催化剂表现出优越的稳定性和选择性，在工业操作条件下长时间测试后几乎没有明显的失活现象。在Pt1Zn1（110）表面发现的活性位点结构在促进丙烯生成并防止结焦形成中起着关键作用，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

3. 在高温下进行烷烃脱氢时，开发高效稳定的单原子催化剂，特别是包含PtZn互金属合金的催化剂，仍然是一个重大挑战。虽然已经取得了在最大化原子效率和抑制结构敏感副反应的同时创造单原子催化剂的进展，但仍然需要进一步的研究来明确活性位点结构并提高丙烯产率。通过使用原子有序的互金属合金，可以通过分散成孤立的Pt1位点提供增强的热稳定性，并促进具有改进稳定性和选择性的催化剂的创造。
