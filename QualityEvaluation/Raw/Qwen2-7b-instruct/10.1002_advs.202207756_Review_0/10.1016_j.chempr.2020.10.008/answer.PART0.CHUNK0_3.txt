[1] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing develop-ment of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."
[2] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sen- sitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."
[3] "Recently, novel preparation methods have been developed to improve the propylene productivity by constructing ultrasmall PtZn bimetal nanoclusters by embedding them inside S-1 zeolites."
[4] "However, due to the very complex coordination structures in zeolites, e.g., the coexistence of PtO, PtPt, and PtZn coordinations, it is very difficult to identify the active site structures, regardless of experimental and theoretical simulations."
[5] "This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assem- bling atomically ordered PtZn intermetallic alloys, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C."
[6] "No obvious deactivation was observed within 160-h under industrial operating condi- tions, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts."

This paper introduces a new approach to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) utilizing a single-site [PtZn4] catalyst assembled from atomically ordered intermetallic alloys. This method enables high propylene selectivity, over 95%, across a broad temperature range from 520°C to 620°C. The catalyst exhibits remarkable stability, with no notable deactivation observed over 160 hours of industrial testing, surpassing other Pt-based catalysts such as PtSn/Al2O3. The research highlights the effectiveness of single-site intermetallic catalysts in achieving efficient PDH with reduced side reactions and improved selectivity and stability.
