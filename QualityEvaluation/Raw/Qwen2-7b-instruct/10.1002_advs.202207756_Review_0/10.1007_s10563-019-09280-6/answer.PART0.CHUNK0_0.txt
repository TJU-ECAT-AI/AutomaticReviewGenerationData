[1] "The traditional routes accounted for 81% propylene production (with 50% from steam cracking and 31% from FCC), while the on-purpose technologies like propane dehydrogenation contributed 19%. The recent trend in steam crackers has been the use of ethane-based feeds which guarantee a bigger yield of ethylene, with far less propylene being produced as a by-product."
[2] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH have been extensively studied. The ongoing debate about active Ga species has led to insights into the nature of these catalysts. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, shedding light on the role of Ga species in the PDH process."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The shift towards ethane-based feeds in steam crackers has resulted in a higher yield of ethylene but with reduced propylene production. The debate around the active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, contributing to a better understanding of these catalysts and their role in the PDH process.
