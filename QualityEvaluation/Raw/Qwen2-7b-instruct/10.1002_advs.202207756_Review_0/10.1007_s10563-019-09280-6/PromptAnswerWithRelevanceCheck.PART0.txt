[1] "The traditional routes accounted for 81% propylene production (with 50% from steam cracking and 31% from FCC), while the on-purpose technologies like propane dehydrogenation contributed 19%. The recent trend in steam crackers has been the use of ethane-based feeds which guarantee a bigger yield of ethylene, with far less propylene being produced as a by-product."
[2] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH have been extensively studied. The ongoing debate about active Ga species has led to insights into the nature of these catalysts. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, shedding light on the role of Ga species in the PDH process."

[7] "Steam catalytic cracking influences the yield of light olefins, but the degree of to which this is effected is also a function of operating conditions, such as reaction temperature, residence time, steam to oil weight ratio, catalyst to oil weight ratio, and partial pressure."
[8] "The reaction temperature for steam catalytic cracking depends on the type of catalyst, feed and the expected product slate from the reaction."

The growing demand for propylene has led to a shift towards using ethane-based feeds in steam crackers, which produce a higher yield of ethylene but less propylene as a by-product. This has resulted in a predicted shortage of propylene, prompting the search for alternative methods and technologies to increase propylene yield. The fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) technology, originally designed for upgrading low-value feeds to gasoline, requires specific catalysts to produce significant amounts of light olefins. Steam catalytic cracking offers an alternative method that combines the beneficial aspects of catalytic cracking and steam cracking to produce both ethylene and propylene at lower temperatures compared to steam cracking. Higher temperatures combined with a suitable catalyst ensure that light olefins become the primary products. To achieve this, the development of catalysts capable of withstanding severe thermal and hydrothermal conditions is crucial. The catalysts should exhibit high stability, mechanical robustness, and be able to withstand the harsh conditions of steam crackers and FCC. The hierarchical pore architecture of FCC catalysts enables the conversion of heavy resid molecules into gas oil, with the matrix performing roles such as heat transfer and providing a porous structure for hydrocarbon diffusion. The incorporation of ZSM-5 into FCC catalyst formulations enhances the ability to produce gasoline and light olefins. Rare earth vanadates, due to their stability and inertness under FCC conditions, help reduce zeolite deactivation and minimize coke and dry gas formation. The presence of carbon dioxide suggests that steam participates in the reaction beyond just serving as a diluent and fluidizing gas. Basu and Kunzru's study on steam catalytic cracking of naphtha using a CaOAl2O3 catalyst demonstrated that increasing reaction temperature accelerates secondary reactions of propylene and butylene, explaining the yield patterns that peak at certain temperatures.
