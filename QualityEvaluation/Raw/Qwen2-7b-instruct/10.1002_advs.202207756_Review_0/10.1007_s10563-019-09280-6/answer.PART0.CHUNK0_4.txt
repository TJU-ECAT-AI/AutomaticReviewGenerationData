[1] "The recent trend in steam crackers has been the use of ethane-based feeds which guarantee a bigger yield of ethylene, with far less propylene being produced as a by-product."
[2] "Propylene is usually obtained as by-product from steam crackers and FCC units which produce with mainly ethylene and gasoline, respectively."
[3] "Therefore, there is expected to be a shortage of propylene, and therefore, there is need to look for alternative methods and technologies to increase the propylene yield to address forecasted supply and demand imbalance."
[4] "The FCC was originally designed to upgrade low value feeds such as vacuum gas oil (VGO) and atmospheric residue to gasoline, and as such, a suitable catalyst is required if light olefins are to form a major part of the product slate."
[5] "Therefore, a new route to convert light feeds such as naphtha into value added light olefins is required, and steam catalytic cracking is an alternative technology that combines useful aspects of catalytic cracking and steam cracking to increase the yield of both ethylene and propylene at relatively lower temperatures than in steam cracking."
[6] "The use of temperatures higher than those in FCC, but lower than those in steam crackers, in combination with a suitable catalyst can help ensure that light olefins are the main products as illustrated in Table2."
[7] "To achieve this objective, development of suitable catalysts capable of withstanding severe thermal and hydrothermal conditions such as those existing in steam crackers and FCC is important."
[8] "The catalyst should also display the properties of high stability, and mechanical robustness."
[9] "The nature of the pores in an FCC catalyst particle gives rise to a hierarchical pore architecture spanning from the macro- to meso- to microporosity as shown in Fig.5."
[10] "It is for this reason that ZSM-5 has been incorporated into the FCC catalyst formulation and/or FCC additives."
[11] "The stability and the inertness of rare earth vanadates under FCC conditions help to reduce zeolite deactivation and the formation of coke and dry gas."
[12] "The formation of carbon dioxide suggests that steam may also be taking part in the reaction."
[13] "The same phenomenon was observed by Basu and Kunzru [72] when they studied the steam catalytic cracking of naphtha using CaOAl2O3 catalyst in a fixed bed reactor."
[14] "The increase in reaction temperature helps accelerate secondary reactions of propylene and butylene, which explains why the yield patterns go through maxima."

The growing demand for propylene has led to a shift towards using ethane-based feeds in steam crackers, which produce a higher yield of ethylene but less propylene as a by-product. This has resulted in a predicted shortage of propylene, prompting the search for alternative methods and technologies to increase propylene yield. The fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) technology, originally designed for upgrading low-value feeds to gasoline, requires specific catalysts to produce significant amounts of light olefins. Steam catalytic cracking offers an alternative method that combines the beneficial aspects of catalytic cracking and steam cracking to produce both ethylene and propylene at lower temperatures compared to steam cracking. Higher temperatures combined with a suitable catalyst ensure that light olefins become the primary products. To achieve this, the development of catalysts capable of withstanding severe thermal and hydrothermal conditions is crucial. The catalysts should exhibit high stability, mechanical robustness, and be able to withstand the harsh conditions of steam crackers and FCC. The hierarchical pore architecture of FCC catalysts enables the conversion of heavy resid molecules into gas oil, with the matrix performing roles such as heat transfer and providing a porous structure for hydrocarbon diffusion. The incorporation of ZSM-5 into FCC catalyst formulations enhances the ability to produce gasoline and light olefins. Rare earth vanadates, due to their stability and inertness under FCC conditions, help reduce zeolite deactivation and minimize coke and dry gas formation. The presence of carbon dioxide suggests that steam participates in the reaction beyond just serving as a diluent and fluidizing gas. Basu and Kunzru's study on steam catalytic cracking of naphtha using a CaOAl2O3 catalyst demonstrated that increasing reaction temperature accelerates secondary reactions of propylene and butylene, explaining the yield patterns that peak at certain temperatures.

丙烯需求的增长导致蒸汽裂解炉转向使用以乙烷为基的原料，这种原料能产生更多的乙烯但丙烯作为副产品产出较少。这导致了丙烯短缺的预测，促使寻找增加丙烯产量的替代方法和技术。原设计用于将低价值物料升级为汽油的流化床催化裂化（FCC）技术需要特定催化剂来产生大量轻烯烃。蒸汽催化裂解提供了一种结合了催化裂解和蒸汽裂解优点的方法，能够在比蒸汽裂解更低的温度下生产乙烷和丙烷。提高反应温度并结合合适的催化剂能够确保轻烯烃成为主要产物。为了实现这一目标，需要开发能够在蒸汽裂解和FCC条件下承受严重热和水热条件的催化剂。催化剂应具备高稳定性和机械强度，并且能够在恶劣条件下保持活性。FCC催化剂的层级孔结构使重残分子转化为气体油成为可能，矩阵在热传递和提供供氢碳扩散的多孔结构方面发挥作用。ZSM-5的加入增强了FCC催化剂的性能，提高了汽油和轻烯烃的生产效率。由于其在FCC条件下的稳定性和惰性，稀有金属氧化物帮助减少了催化剂失活和焦炭及干气的形成。蒸汽的存在不仅作为稀释剂和流化气体，还参与了反应过程。巴苏和库恩祖的研究表明，使用CaOAl2O3催化剂进行蒸汽催化裂解时，提高反应温度会加速丙烯和丁烯的二次反应，解释了在一定温度范围内出现的产率峰值现象。
