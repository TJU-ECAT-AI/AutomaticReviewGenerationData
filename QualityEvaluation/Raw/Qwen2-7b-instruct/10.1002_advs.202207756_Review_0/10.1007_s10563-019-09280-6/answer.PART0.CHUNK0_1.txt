[1] "Propylene is usually obtained as by-product from steam crackers and FCC units which produce with mainly ethylene and gasoline, respectively."
[2] "The type of feedstock used in steam crackers affect the yield of propylene. While heavy feeds produce more propylene, lighter feeds tend to produce less propylene."
[3] "There is expected to be a shortage of propylene, and therefore, there is need to look for alternative methods and technologies to increase the propylene yield to address forecasted supply and demand imbalance."
[4] "Steam catalytic cracking is an alternative technology that combines useful aspects of catalytic cracking and steam cracking to increase the yield of both ethylene and propylene at relatively lower temperatures than in steam cracking."
[5] "The use of temperatures higher than those in FCC, but lower than those in steam crackers, in combination with a suitable catalyst can help ensure that light olefins are the main products."
[6] "Steam catalytic cracking gives high yields of light olefins and also mitigates the huge energy consumption issue, since it operates at much lower temperatures compared to the steam cracking."
[7] "Steam catalytic cracking influences the yield of light olefins, but the degree of to which this is effected is also a function of operating conditions, such as reaction temperature, residence time, steam to oil weight ratio, catalyst to oil weight ratio, and partial pressure."
[8] "The reaction temperature for steam catalytic cracking depends on the type of catalyst, feed and the expected product slate from the reaction."
[9] "Most of the catalyst development effort with CaO and KVO3 was carried out to either increase the yield of olefins or to lower the coke deposition on the reactor wall and on the catalyst in order to maintain its activity for the reaction."
[10] "Steam catalytic cracking involves catalytic cracking reactions and thermal pyrolysis reactions, controlled by both the free radical mechanism and the carbonium ion mechanism."
[11] "The Rm value decreases for all catalyst, as reaction temperature increases, indicating that the effect of the free radical mechanism in catalytic pyrolysis processes becomes more significant, and that of the carbonium ion mechanism becomes less significant."

1. The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to increase propylene yield. Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, including debates around active Ga species and recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts.

2. Steam catalytic cracking has emerged as an alternative method to produce light olefins, offering a more efficient way to generate both ethylene and propylene at lower temperatures compared to traditional steam cracking processes.

3. Operating conditions, such as reaction temperature, residence time, and steam-to-oil ratio, significantly influence the yield of light olefins in steam catalytic cracking processes.

4. The reaction temperature in steam catalytic cracking depends on the catalyst type, feedstock, and the desired product profile, balancing efficiency and yield.

5. Efforts in catalyst development for steam catalytic cracking aim to enhance olefin yield and reduce coke deposition, ensuring the catalyst remains active and efficient throughout the process.

6. The mechanism of steam catalytic cracking combines both free radical and carbonium ion reactions, influenced by the catalyst's properties and the operating conditions.

7. As the reaction temperature increases, the free radical mechanism becomes more dominant, while the carbonium ion mechanism's influence diminishes, affecting the overall product distribution and yield.
