[1] "The traditional routes accounted for 81% propylene production (with 50% from steam cracking and 31% from FCC), while the on-purpose technologies like propane dehydrogenation contributed 19%."
[2] "By employing a catalyst, it is also possible to tilt the selectivity in favor of propylene instead of ethylene."
[3] "It is therefore important to develop a technology that is capable of processing light feed like naphtha with the aim of maximizing light olefin production."
[4] "The very nature of the FCC unit means that it will also struggle to process light feeds such as naphtha, which require relatively high cracking temperatures than heavy feeds."
[5] "The use of temperatures higher than those in FCC, but lower than those in steam crackers, in combination with a suitable catalyst can help ensure that light olefins are the main products."
[6] "Steam catalytic cracking gives high yields of light olefins and also mitigates the huge energy consumption issue, since it operates at much lower temperatures compared to the steam cracking."
[7] "For steam catalytic cracking process, the main challenge is the synergistic integration of steam cracking and catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons in order to produce more light olefins especially propylene."
[8] "Steam catalytic cracking with molecular sieve based catalysts operates at lower temperatures than conventional steam cracking, thus providing energy savings."
[9] "Steam catalytic cracking over zeolite based catalysts involves catalytic cracking reactions and thermal cracking reactions both on catalyst surfaces and in the interspaces between catalyst particles."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH utilizes catalysts, especially Ga/H-ZSM-5, to convert propane into propylene. The debate around the active Ga species in these catalysts has been a topic of ongoing research. Recent studies suggest that the active Ga species are crucial for the PDH process, enhancing the conversion efficiency. This understanding has contributed significantly to advancements in PDH technology and the optimization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.
