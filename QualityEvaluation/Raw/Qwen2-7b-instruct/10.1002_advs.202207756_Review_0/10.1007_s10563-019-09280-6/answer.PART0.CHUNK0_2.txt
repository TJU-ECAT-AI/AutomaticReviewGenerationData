[1] "Propylene is usually obtained as by-product from steam crackers and FCC units which produce with mainly ethylene and gasoline, respectively."
[2] "The recent trend in steam crackers has been the use of ethane-based feeds which guarantee a bigger yield of ethylene, with far less propylene being produced as a by-product."
[3] "Therefore, there is expected to be a shortage of propylene, and therefore, there is need to look for alternative methods and technologies to increase the propylene yield to address forecasted supply and demand imbalance."
[4] "Propylene is usually obtained as by-product from steam crackers and FCC units which produce with mainly ethylene and gasoline, respectively."
[5] "A major alternative to the steam cracker as a source of propylene is the FCC where the use of catalysts leads to much lower operating temperatures than those in steam crackers."
[6] "Other challenges associated with the use of light feed such as naphtha are lower coke yield, lower regenerator temperature and elevated catalyst circulation rates to account for higher endothermic heat of reaction since catalyst is the main heat carrier in the FCC."
[7] "The amount of steam used in steam catalytic cracking will hydrothermally deactivate conventional FCC catalysts, therefore, special catalyst capable of withstanding high temperatures and high amount of steam need to be developed for commercial applications."
[8] "Steam catalytic cracking is an alternative technology that combines useful aspects of catalytic cracking and steam cracking to increase the yield of both ethylene and propylene at relatively lower temperatures than in steam cracking."
[9] "In steam catalytic cracking, steam is used as an inexpensive diluent and also to decrease the amount of coke deposition on catalysts."
[10] "The catalyst should also display the properties of high stability, and mechanical robustness."
[11] "It is widely accepted that steam catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons over oxide catalysts follows the free-radical mechanism."
[12] "Cracking reactions over acidic catalysts like zeolites usually proceed via the carbonium ion mechanism."
[13] "Cracking on Lewis acid sites proceeds via both the carbonium ion mechanism and the free radical mechanism."
[14] "The above observation show that the reaction mechanism used to describe steam catalytic cracking varies with catalyst and technologies."
[15] "Steam catalytic cracking involves catalytic cracking reactions and thermal pyrolysis reactions, controlled by both the free radical mechanism and the carbonium ion mechanism."
[16] "The combination of steam cracking and catalytic cracking means the interplay of free radical and catalytic cracking mechanisms, since the reaction temperature is relatively high."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by shifting the focus towards increasing propylene yields. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Researchers have debated the active Ga species, and recent studies have provided insights into the mechanisms and factors affecting the performance of these catalysts. These advancements have contributed to a deeper comprehension of the catalytic processes involved in PDH, enabling more efficient and selective production of propylene.
