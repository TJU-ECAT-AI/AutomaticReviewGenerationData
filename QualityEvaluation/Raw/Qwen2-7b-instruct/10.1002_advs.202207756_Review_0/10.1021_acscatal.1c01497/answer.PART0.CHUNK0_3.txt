The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This demand has led to an increased focus on understanding the correlation between gallium (Ga) speciation and the activity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH processes. Recent research has shed light on the active Ga species involved in PDH, contributing to our current knowledge of these catalysts.
