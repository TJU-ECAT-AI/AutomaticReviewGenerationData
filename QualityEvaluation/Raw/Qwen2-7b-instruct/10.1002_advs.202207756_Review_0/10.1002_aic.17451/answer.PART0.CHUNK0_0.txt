The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the search for alternative, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly catalysts. The document discusses the evolution of understanding regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, highlighting debates about the active Ga species and recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge. For instance, it is mentioned that the encapsulation of metal species within zeolites (M@zeolite) by ligand-assisted in situ crystallization has been frequently reported, exhibiting various advantages for light hydrocarbon catalytic reactions. This method allows for the preparation of catalysts with improved activity and stability, as exemplified by the Co-acac@S-1 catalyst, which exhibits high PDH activity and durability. The encapsulated CoO clusters are suggested to offer favorable propane adsorption and stabilization of detached H* species, leading to lower dehydrogenation barriers compared to framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles. Furthermore, the document suggests that the encapsulation effect and metal-support interaction can prevent CoO clusters from reducing and sintering, contributing to the high stability of the Co-acac@S-1 catalyst. Overall, the study indicates that oxygenated extraframework CoO clusters are more active than isolated framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles in PDH reactions, and the catalytic performance is expected to further improve by regulating the size and channel location of clusters.

丙烯需求的增长已经影响了新的生产方法，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）的发展，推动了对替代、经济实惠且环境友好的催化剂的寻找。文献讨论了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的演变理解，强调了关于活性Ga物种的辩论以及对当前知识的最新研究发现的贡献。例如，文献提到通过配体辅助原位结晶将金属物种封装到沸石中（M@沸石），经常报告具有轻烃催化反应的各种优势。这种方法允许制备具有改进的活性和稳定性的催化剂，例如，Co-acac@S-1催化剂，它表现出高PDH活性和耐用性。封装的CoO簇被建议提供有利的丙烷吸附和稳定化从丙烷脱离的H*物种，导致与框架Co2+离子和Co3O4纳米粒子相比更低的脱氢障碍。此外，文献表明封装效果和金属支持相互作用可以防止CoO簇还原和烧结，从而促进Co-acac@S-1催化剂的高稳定性。总的来说，研究表明氧化的额外框架CoO簇在PDH反应中比孤立的框架Co2+离子和Co3O4纳米粒子更活跃，并且通过调节簇的大小和通道位置，预计催化剂的催化性能将进一步提高。
