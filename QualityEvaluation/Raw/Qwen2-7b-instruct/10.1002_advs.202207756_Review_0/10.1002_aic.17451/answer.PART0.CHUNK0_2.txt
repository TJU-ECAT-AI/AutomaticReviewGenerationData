[1] "With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands. The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products."
[2] "However, the as-prepared well-dispersed Co sites tend to aggregate and are reduced to metallic Co (Co0) under high temperature and strongly reducing PDH atmosphere, which exacerbates the formation of coke deposit and is unfavorable for catalyst stability."
[3] "The high PDH activity of CoO@S-1 is assigned to the encapsulated CoO clusters are favorable for propane adsorption and can better stabilize the detached H* species from propane, leading to the lower dehydrogenation barriers than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles."
[4] "Moreover, the bands correlated with Co2+-CO species in Co-edta@S-1 remains its initial position with increasing CO pressure, and meantime, no bands ascribed to bridged adsorbed CO were observed, indicating the highly isolated framework Co2+ sites in this catalyst."
[5] "This joint computational and experimental study indicate that oxygenated extraframework CoO clusters are more active than isolated framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles in PDH reaction, and the catalytic performance is expected to further improve by regulating the size and channel location of clusters."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in PDH as a method for producing propylene due to the abundance of propane as a feedstock and the minimal by-products. However, the instability of cobalt sites in PDH catalysts, particularly their aggregation and reduction to metallic cobalt, negatively impacts catalyst stability.

2. The high activity of the CoO@S-1 catalyst in PDH is attributed to the encapsulated cobalt oxide clusters, which enhance propane adsorption and stabilize the detached hydrogen species, reducing the dehydrogenation barriers compared to cobalt(II) cations and cobalt(III) oxide nanoparticles.

3. The encapsulated cobalt oxide clusters in the CoO@S-1 catalyst are more effective in stabilizing the detached hydrogen species from propane, leading to lower dehydrogenation barriers and higher activity in PDH reactions.

4. The Co-edta@S-1 catalyst displays highly isolated framework cobalt(II) sites, which remain unchanged with increasing carbon monoxide pressure and show no bridged adsorption of carbon monoxide, indicating the isolation and stability of these sites.

5. The study suggests that extraframework cobalt oxide clusters are more active than isolated cobalt(II) cations and cobalt(III) oxide nanoparticles in PDH reactions. The catalytic performance could be improved by adjusting the size and channel location of these clusters.

1. 随着化石能源消耗的增加，传统的丙烯生产过程如石脑油蒸汽裂解已无法满足日益增长的需求。直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）生产丙烯因其原料丰富且副产品少而受到广泛关注。

2. 准备好的分散良好的钴位点倾向于聚集并还原为金属钴（Co0），在高温度和强烈还原PDH气氛下，这加剧了焦炭沉积的形成，对催化剂稳定性不利。

3. CoO@S-1催化剂的高PDH活性归因于封装的钴氧化物簇，它们有利于丙烷吸附并更好地稳定从丙烷脱出的氢物种，导致与框架钴(II)离子和钴(III)氧化物纳米粒子相比更低的脱氢障碍。

4. Co-edta@S-1催化剂中的框架钴(II)位点高度隔离，随着二氧化碳压力的增加，其位置保持不变，并未观察到桥接吸附的二氧化碳，表明这些位点的隔离性和稳定性。

5. 研究表明，额外框架的钴氧化物簇在PDH反应中比孤立的框架钴(II)离子和钴(III)氧化物纳米粒子更为活跃。可以通过调整这些簇的大小和通道位置来进一步提高催化性能。
