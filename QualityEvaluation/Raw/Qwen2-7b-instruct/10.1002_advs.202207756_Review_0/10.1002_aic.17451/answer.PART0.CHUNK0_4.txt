[1] "The high PDH activity of CoO@S-1 is assigned to the encapsulated CoO clusters are favorable for propane adsorption and can better stabilize the detached H* species from propane, leading to the lower dehydrogenation barriers than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles."
[2] "The absence of bands around 1540cm1 were observed for all tested catalysts, indicating the absence of Brnsted acid sites."
[3] "The CoO clusters possess a superior PDH activity than Co0 sites based on the superior activity of Co-acac@S-1 than Co-acac@S-1 (800)."
[4] "The electronic density of states (DOS) of active centers was investigated as shown in Figure 5C. The lowest d-band center (ξd) and occupied p-band center (ξp) values of Co-edta@S-1 model are consistent with its highest dehydrogenation barrier."
[5] "For presenting the efficient activity of Co-acac@S-1, the effect of WHSVC3H8 on PDH activity was investigated. As shown in Figure S20, the propylene formation rate increases with WHSVC3H8 and reaches 13.17mmol C3H6 · gcat1 · h1 at WHSVC3H8 of 3.125h1."

1. The encapsulated CoO clusters within silicalite-1 zeolite enhance propane dehydrogenation activity by favoring propane adsorption and stabilizing detached H* species, resulting in lower dehydrogenation barriers compared to framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles.
2. There are no Brnsted acid sites present on the tested catalysts, as indicated by the absence of adsorption bands around 1540cm1 in their FTIR spectra.
3. The CoO clusters show superior PDH activity relative to Co0 sites, which is evident from the higher activity of Co-acac@S-1 compared to Co-acac@S-1 (800°C reduction).
4. The lowest d-band center (ξd) and occupied p-band center (ξp) values of the Co-edta@S-1 model correlate with its highest dehydrogenation barrier, as observed in the electronic density of states (DOS) investigation.
5. The propylene formation rate for Co-acac@S-1 increases with WHSVC3H8, reaching a maximum of 13.17 mmol C3H6 per gram of catalyst per hour at a WHSVC3H8 of 3.125 h-1.

1. 封装在硅铝酸盐-1沸石中的CoO簇通过促进丙烷吸附并稳定从丙烷脱氢的H*物种，降低了与框架Co2+离子和Co3O4纳米粒子相比的脱氢能垒，从而提高了丙烷脱氢化活性。
2. 所有测试催化剂中未检测到Brnsted酸位点，因为其傅里叶变换红外光谱中没有在1540cm1附近的吸附带。
3. 相对于Co0位点，CoO簇在丙烷脱氢化过程中显示出更优的活性，这可以从Co-acac@S-1相对于Co-acac@S-1（800°C还原）的更高活性中看出。
4. Co-edta@S-1模型的最低d能级中心（ξd）和占据的p能级中心（ξp）值与其最高的脱氢能垒相关联，这是在电子密度状态（DOS）调查中观察到的。
5. Co-acac@S-1的丙烯生成速率随着WHSVC3H8的增加而增加，在WHSVC3H8为3.125 h-1时达到最大值13.17 mmol C3H6每克催化剂每小时。
