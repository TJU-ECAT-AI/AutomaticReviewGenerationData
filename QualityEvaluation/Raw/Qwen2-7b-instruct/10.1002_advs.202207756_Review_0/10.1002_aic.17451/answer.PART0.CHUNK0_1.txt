1. The encapsulated CoO clusters within silicalite-1 zeolite are credited for the high PDH activity, as they favorably assist propane adsorption and stabilize detached H* species, resulting in lower dehydrogenation barriers compared to framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles.
2. The reduction temperature for the Co sites in the impregnated Co/S-1 catalyst is higher than those in Co-exchanged ZSM-5 and Co-substituted dealumination Beta zeolite, indicating stronger bonding with the support.
3. The bands at 2133 and 2141 cm-1 are associated with physically adsorbed CO molecules on the catalyst surface.
4. The simulated CO adsorption frequencies align with the experimental observations, and DFT simulations adequately explain the absence of dicarbonyl-related bands in experiments.
5. The absence of dinitrosyl-related bands in experimental observations is further explored through DFT simulation.
6. The optimal Co-acac@S-1 catalyst experiences activity loss upon 800°C reduction but recovers upon re-oxidation at 550°C.
7. The lowest activation energy (Ea) value in Co-acac@S-1 signifies the lowest dehydrogenation barrier among the catalysts.
8. The CoO clusters show a stronger interaction with a variety of gas molecules (C3H8, CO, pyridine, NO) than framework Co2+ sites and metallic Co surface, as confirmed by DFT calculations.
9. The superficial Co3O4 in the Co/S-1 catalyst is easily reduced to Co0, leading to over-dehydrogenation rather than desorption of formed C3H6, which causes severe coke deposit.

1. 封装在硅铝酸盐-1沸石中的CoO簇因其有利于丙烷吸附并能更好地稳定从丙烷脱氢的H*物种，导致低于框架Co2+离子和Co3O4纳米粒子的脱氢壁垒，从而赋予了高PDH活性。
2. Co/S-1催化剂中的Co位点的还原温度高于Co交换ZSM-5和Co取代去铝化Beta沸石，表明与支持物的更强结合。
3. 2133和2141 cm-1的带与催化剂表面物理吸附的CO分子相关联。
4. CO吸附的模拟频率与实验观察一致，DFT模拟充分解释了实验中未发现二羰基相关带的原因。
5. 实验观察中缺失的dinitrosyl相关带的缺失原因也通过DFT模拟进行了进一步探索。
6. 最佳的Co-acac@S-1催化剂在800°C还原后出现明显的活性损失，但在550°C空气重新氧化后活性再次恢复。
7. Co-acac@S-1中最低的激活能（Ea）值表示最低的脱氢壁垒。
8. CoO簇与框架Co2+位点和金属Co表面相比，显示出与各种气体分子（C3H8、CO、吡啶、NO）更强的相互作用，这一点得到了DFT计算的证实。
9. Co/S-1催化剂表面的浅层Co3O4容易还原为Co0，形成的C3H6倾向于过脱氢而不是脱附，从而导致严重的结焦沉积。
