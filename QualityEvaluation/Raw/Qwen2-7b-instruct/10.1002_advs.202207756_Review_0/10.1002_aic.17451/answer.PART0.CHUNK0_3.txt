[1] "With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands. The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products."
[2] "However, the as-prepared well-dispersed Co sites tend to aggregate and are reduced to metallic Co (Co0) under high temperature and strongly reducing PDH atmosphere, which exacerbates the formation of coke deposit and is unfavorable for catalyst stability."
[3] "Recently, the encapsulation of metal species within zeolites (M@zeolite) by ligand-assistance in situ crystallization strategy has been frequently reported, which exhibits various advantages for light hydrocarbon catalytic reactions."
[4] "Indeed, several recent reports have employed the subnanometric CoO clusters to catalyze oxidative alkane dehydrogenation reaction, achieving a promising result."
[5] "Moreover, it is revealed that the encapsulated CoO clusters exhibit superior catalytic PDH performance than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles."

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is because the conventional methods, like naphtha steam cracking, are unable to meet the increasing needs due to the depletion of fossil resources. PDH stands out due to its use of readily available propane feedstock and minimal by-product generation. The instability of cobalt sites, which can aggregate and reduce to metallic cobalt under PDH conditions, negatively impacts catalyst stability. Recent advancements in encapsulating metal species within zeolites through ligand-assisted in situ crystallization offer advantages for light hydrocarbon catalytic reactions. The utilization of subnanometer cobalt oxide clusters in oxidative alkane dehydrogenation reactions has shown promise. The study demonstrates that encapsulated cobalt oxide clusters perform better in PDH reactions than cobalt(II) cations and cobalt(III) oxide nanoparticles within the zeolite framework.

随着丙烯需求的增长，新的生产方法，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），得到了发展。这是因为传统的裂解方法如石脑油蒸汽裂解无法满足日益增长的需求，主要是由于化石资源的耗尽。PDH因其使用易于获取的丙烷原料以及较少的副产品生成而受到关注。钴位点的不稳定性是一个问题，它们在PDH条件下容易聚集并还原为金属钴，这对催化剂稳定性不利。最近，通过配体辅助原位结晶策略在沸石中封装金属物种的进展为轻烃催化反应提供了优势。利用亚纳米钴氧化物簇在氧化烷烃脱氢反应中的应用显示出潜力。研究表明，封装的钴氧化物簇在PDH反应中的性能优于沸石框架中的钴(II)离子和钴(III)氧化物纳米颗粒。
