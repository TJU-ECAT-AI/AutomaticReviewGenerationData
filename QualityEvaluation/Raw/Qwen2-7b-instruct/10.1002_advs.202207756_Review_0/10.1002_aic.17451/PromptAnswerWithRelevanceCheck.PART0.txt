[1] "With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands."
[2] "However, the sintering and reduction of unstable Co sites cause fast deactivation."
[3] "This CoO@S-1 catalyst exhibits an attractive propylene formation rate of 13.66mmolC3H6·gcat1·h1 with selectivity of >92% and is durable during 120-h PDH reaction with five successive regeneration cycles."
[4] "The high PDH activity of CoO@S-1 is assigned to the encapsulated CoO clusters are favorable for propane adsorption and can better stabilize the detached H* species from propane, leading to the lower dehydrogenation barriers than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles."
[5] "The key findings of this study include the simple in situ crystallization method to obtain well-dispersed and anti-reducing CoO clusters encapsulated within S-1 channels."
[6] "The absence of bands around 1950 and 2066cm1 excludes the presence of Co3+ or Co0 species in tested catalysts."
[7] "The results clearly demonstrate the PDH intrinsic activity follows the sequence of Co-acac@S-1>Co/S-1 >>Co-edta@S-1."
[8] "Moreover, a long-term test with five successive regeneration cycles further confirms the high stability of optimal Co-acac@S-1 catalyst."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the search for alternative, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly catalysts. The document discusses the evolution of understanding regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, highlighting debates about the active Ga species and recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge. For instance, it is mentioned that the encapsulation of metal species within zeolites (M@zeolite) by ligand-assisted in situ crystallization has been frequently reported, exhibiting various advantages for light hydrocarbon catalytic reactions. This method allows for the preparation of catalysts with improved activity and stability, as exemplified by the Co-acac@S-1 catalyst, which exhibits high PDH activity and durability. The encapsulated CoO clusters are suggested to offer favorable propane adsorption and stabilization of detached H* species, leading to lower dehydrogenation barriers compared to framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles. Furthermore, the document suggests that the encapsulation effect and metal-support interaction can prevent CoO clusters from reducing and sintering, contributing to the high stability of the Co-acac@S-1 catalyst. Overall, the study indicates that oxygenated extraframework CoO clusters are more active than isolated framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles in PDH reactions, and the catalytic performance is expected to further improve by regulating the size and channel location of clusters.

丙烯需求的增长已经影响了新的生产方法，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）的发展，推动了对替代、经济实惠且环境友好的催化剂的寻找。文献讨论了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的演变理解，强调了关于活性Ga物种的辩论以及对当前知识的最新研究发现的贡献。例如，文献提到通过配体辅助原位结晶将金属物种封装到沸石中（M@沸石），经常报告具有轻烃催化反应的各种优势。这种方法允许制备具有改进的活性和稳定性的催化剂，例如，Co-acac@S-1催化剂，它表现出高PDH活性和耐用性。封装的CoO簇被建议提供有利的丙烷吸附和稳定化从丙烷脱离的H*物种，导致与框架Co2+离子和Co3O4纳米粒子相比更低的脱氢障碍。此外，文献表明封装效果和金属支持相互作用可以防止CoO簇还原和烧结，从而促进Co-acac@S-1催化剂的高稳定性。总的来说，研究表明氧化的额外框架CoO簇在PDH反应中比孤立的框架Co2+离子和Co3O4纳米粒子更活跃，并且通过调节簇的大小和通道位置，预计催化剂的催化性能将进一步提高。

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in PDH as a method for producing propylene due to the abundance of propane as a feedstock and the minimal by-products. However, the instability of cobalt sites in PDH catalysts, particularly their aggregation and reduction to metallic cobalt, negatively impacts catalyst stability.

2. The high activity of the CoO@S-1 catalyst in PDH is attributed to the encapsulated cobalt oxide clusters, which enhance propane adsorption and stabilize the detached hydrogen species, reducing the dehydrogenation barriers compared to cobalt(II) cations and cobalt(III) oxide nanoparticles.

3. The encapsulated cobalt oxide clusters in the CoO@S-1 catalyst are more effective in stabilizing the detached hydrogen species from propane, leading to lower dehydrogenation barriers and higher activity in PDH reactions.

4. The Co-edta@S-1 catalyst displays highly isolated framework cobalt(II) sites, which remain unchanged with increasing carbon monoxide pressure and show no bridged adsorption of carbon monoxide, indicating the isolation and stability of these sites.

5. The study suggests that extraframework cobalt oxide clusters are more active than isolated cobalt(II) cations and cobalt(III) oxide nanoparticles in PDH reactions. The catalytic performance could be improved by adjusting the size and channel location of these clusters.

1. 随着化石能源消耗的增加，传统的丙烯生产过程如石脑油蒸汽裂解已无法满足日益增长的需求。直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）生产丙烯因其原料丰富且副产品少而受到广泛关注。

2. 准备好的分散良好的钴位点倾向于聚集并还原为金属钴（Co0），在高温度和强烈还原PDH气氛下，这加剧了焦炭沉积的形成，对催化剂稳定性不利。

3. CoO@S-1催化剂的高PDH活性归因于封装的钴氧化物簇，它们有利于丙烷吸附并更好地稳定从丙烷脱出的氢物种，导致与框架钴(II)离子和钴(III)氧化物纳米粒子相比更低的脱氢障碍。

4. Co-edta@S-1催化剂中的框架钴(II)位点高度隔离，随着二氧化碳压力的增加，其位置保持不变，并未观察到桥接吸附的二氧化碳，表明这些位点的隔离性和稳定性。

5. 研究表明，额外框架的钴氧化物簇在PDH反应中比孤立的框架钴(II)离子和钴(III)氧化物纳米粒子更为活跃。可以通过调整这些簇的大小和通道位置来进一步提高催化性能。

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is because the conventional methods, like naphtha steam cracking, are unable to meet the increasing needs due to the depletion of fossil resources. PDH stands out due to its use of readily available propane feedstock and minimal by-product generation. The instability of cobalt sites, which can aggregate and reduce to metallic cobalt under PDH conditions, negatively impacts catalyst stability. Recent advancements in encapsulating metal species within zeolites through ligand-assisted in situ crystallization offer advantages for light hydrocarbon catalytic reactions. The utilization of subnanometer cobalt oxide clusters in oxidative alkane dehydrogenation reactions has shown promise. The study demonstrates that encapsulated cobalt oxide clusters perform better in PDH reactions than cobalt(II) cations and cobalt(III) oxide nanoparticles within the zeolite framework.
