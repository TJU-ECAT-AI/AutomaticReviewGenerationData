<p>Despite the presence of similar intermetallic phases in the XRD patterns, i.e. Pt3Co, the varying (PtCo):(PtPt) ratios in the FT magnitude EXAFS at the Pt LIII edge and the presence of two phases in some of the XRD patterns suggest that the average compositions of the nanoparticles among the catalysts are not similar.</p>
<p>At very low Co loadings, there are two phases: metallic Pt and a smaller ordered Pt3Co alloy phase. As the Co loading increases, an ordered Pt3Co alloy phase is formed. At high Co loading, formation of a more Co-rich PtCo alloy phase is likely and metallic Co nanoparticles are also present.</p>

1. The composition of the nanoparticles varies among the catalysts due to differences in the (PtCo):(PtPt) ratios observed in the EXAFS spectra and the presence of multiple phases in the XRD patterns.
2. At low Co loadings, the catalysts consist of metallic Pt and a smaller ordered Pt3Co alloy phase. As Co loading increases, an ordered Pt3Co alloy phase is formed. At high Co loadings, a more Co-rich PtCo alloy phase is likely present alongside metallic Co nanoparticles.

1. 不同催化剂中纳米颗粒的组成存在差异，这是由EXAFS谱中（PtCo）：（PtPt）比的变化和XRD模式中出现的多个相所显示的。
2. 在低Co负载下，催化剂包含金属Pt和较小的有序Pt3Co合金相。随着Co负载增加，形成有序的Pt3Co合金相。在高Co负载下，更富含Co的PtCo合金相以及金属Co纳米颗粒可能同时存在。
