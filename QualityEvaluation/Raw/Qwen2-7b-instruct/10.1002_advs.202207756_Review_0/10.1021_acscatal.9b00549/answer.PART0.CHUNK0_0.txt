<quotes>
<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become increasingly important due to the growing demand for propylene, which is a key intermediate in the petrochemical industry. New production methods, particularly PDH, have been developed to meet this demand more efficiently and economically.</p>
<p>The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was considerable debate about the active Ga species involved in the PDH process. However, recent research has contributed to a clearer picture of the catalyst's mechanism.</p>
