The growing demand for propylene has led to advancements in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) methods, particularly utilizing Co/H-ZSM5 catalysts. This method allows for the conversion of propane into propene and hydrogen through dehydrogenation, and into methane and ethene via cracking. The propene and hydrogen are primary products, followed by secondary products like ethane, formed through ethene hydrogenation, and aromatics, produced from the dehydrocyclization reactions of C6+ alkenes participating in rapid oligomerization-cracking cycles. Cobalt (Co) cations facilitate the removal of hydrogen as hydrogen gas (H2) from the reactive intermediates involved in dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization steps, similar to the roles played by gallium (Ga) and zinc (Zn) cations. The presence of Co cations enhances the rates of propane dehydrogenation, ethene hydrogenation, and alkene dehydrocyclization reactions by catalyzing the hydrogen adsorption-desorption steps. However, propane cracking rate constants are not influenced by hydrogen or Co cations since cracking occurs on Bronsted acid sites. Co cations increase the reversibility of hydrogen removal steps and improve the communication between the surface and the gas-phase hydrogen pools.

对丙烯日益增长的需求推动了丙烷脱氢（PDH）方法的发展，特别是利用Co/H-ZSM5催化剂。这种方法允许将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气通过脱氢，以及通过裂解生成甲烷和乙烯。丙烯和氢气是主要产品，其次是乙烷，通过乙烯的氢化形成，以及从快速烯烃聚合裂解循环中的C6+烯烃参与的脱氢反应生成的芳烃。钴（Co）离子促进了从参与脱氢和脱氢环化步骤的活性中间体中氢的去除，类似于镓（Ga）和锌（Zn）离子的作用。存在Co离子可以增强丙烷脱氢、乙烯氢化和烯烃脱氢环化反应的速率，通过催化氢吸附-脱附步骤。然而，丙烷裂解速率常数不受氢或Co离子的影响，因为裂解发生在布隆斯特酸位点上。Co离子增加了氢去除步骤的可逆性，并改善了表面与气体相氢池之间的通信。

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Research has debated the active Ga species, and recent studies have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts.

2. Co/H-ZSM5 catalysts have been reported to catalyze alkane dehydrocyclodimerization reactions. On this catalyst, propane undergoes primary dehydrogenation and cracking reactions, forming propene, H2, methane, and ethene. The selectivities of these products vary with the conversion level.

3. The formation of propene directly from propane and the subsequent formation of aromatics via secondary reactions of alkenes are observed in the reaction pathways. The selectivities of methane, ethene, and ethane increase with contact time, while the formation of aromatics increases with propane conversion.

4. Propane dehydrogenation and cracking reactions form propene and H2, and CH4 and C2H4, respectively. The initial propene selectivity is non-zero due to direct dehydrogenation, whereas aromatic selectivities are low initially and increase with conversion.

5. H2 affects the rate of individual reaction steps during propane conversion on Co/H-ZSM5. It decreases the propane dehydrogenation rate constant (k1) slightly but does not influence the propane cracking rate constant (k2).

6. Cracking rate constants (k2) are not influenced by H2 or Co cations, as these reactions occur on Bronsted acid sites.

7. Ethene hydrogenation rate constants (k3) increase with H2 concentration, and Co cations catalyze the hydrogen removal steps, enhancing the hydrogen availability for ethene hydrogenation.

8. Increasing amounts of Co in H-ZSM5 catalysts lead to higher propane turnover rates and the rate of formation of dehydrogenated products. Co cations provide sites for hydrogen removal steps.

9. The rate constant corresponding to alkene reactions to form aromatics (k4) increases with Co content, suggesting that Co cations enhance alkene dehydrogenation and cyclization reactions to form aromatics.

10. Co2+ cations increase the reversibility of hydrogen removal steps, facilitating better communication between the surface and the gas-phase hydrogen pools.

2. Co/H-ZSM5 催化剂已被报告用于催化烷烃脱氢环二聚反应。在该催化剂上，丙烷通过主要的脱氢和裂解反应形成，形成丙烯、H2、甲烷和乙烷。这些产物的选择性随着接触时间的变化而变化。

3. 从丙烷直接形成丙烯以及随后通过烯烃的二次反应形成芳香族化合物的形成路径被观察到。甲烷、乙烯和乙烷的形成选择性随接触时间增加，而芳香族化合物的形成选择性则随丙烷转化率增加。

4. 丙烷脱氢和裂解反应形成丙烯和H2，以及CH4 和C2H4。初始丙烯选择性非零，因为它是通过直接脱氢形成的，而芳香族选择性最初很低，随转化率增加。

5. 在Co/H-ZSM5 上进行丙烷转化时，H2 减少了丙烷脱氢步骤的速率常数（k1），但没有影响丙烷裂解速率常数（k2）。

6. 丙烷裂解速率常数（k2）不受H2 或Co 离子的影响，因为这些反应发生在Bronsted 酸位点上。

7. 乙烷氢化速率常数（k3）随H2 浓度增加，Co 离子催化氢移除步骤，增加了乙烷氢化的氢可用性。

8. Co含量的增加导致H-ZSM5 催化剂的丙烷周转率和形成脱氢产物的速率提高。Co 离子提供了氢移除步骤的站点。

9. 芳烃反应速率常数（k4）随Co 含量增加而增加，表明Co 离子增强了烯烃脱氢和环化反应以形成芳烃。

10. Co2+ 离子增加了氢移除步骤的可逆性，促进了表面与气体相氢池之间的更好通信。

<p>On Co/H-ZSM5, propane reaction pathways include primary dehydrogenation steps that form C3H6 and primary cracking steps that form CH4 and C2H4 directly from propane.1 Secondary products include C2H6 and C6C8 aromatics.1 Aromatics form via dehydrocyclization reactions of C6+ alkenes, which form and participate in rapid acid-catalyzed oligomerization-cracking cycles, as previously reported on Zn/H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5.2,7-9 Initial propene selectivities (extrapolated to zero reactant conversion) show a nonzero value, because propene forms directly from propane, but aromatic selectivities are initially very low and increase with increasing conversion, as expected from their formation via secondary reactions of alkenes.1 Methane, ethene, and ethane selectivities are shown as a function of conversion on Co/H-ZSM5 (Co/Al = 0.17) in Figure 1.</p>
<p>These conclusions are consistent with the product site-yields plots shown in Figures 2 and 3 on Co/H-ZSM5 (Co/Al = 0.12). Methane site-yields increase linearly with contact time, suggesting that methane forms predominantly from propane and not from the propene products, which become more abundant with increasing contact time (Figure 2). Ethene site-yield curves show that ethene formation rates, given by the local slope of the site-yield curve, decrease, while ethane formation rates increase, with increasing contact time (Figure 3).</p>
<p>The 13C content and the isotopomer distribution in products formed from 2-13C-propane reactants can also be used to probe propane reaction pathways. Oligomerization-cracking cycles lead to increasingly binomial isotopomer distributions as alkenes spend longer times within such cycles before their irreversible conversion to aromatics. 9,16 At low conversions, propene molecules do not show a binomial 13C isotopomer distribution and contain mostly one 13C atom, because they form initially only via direct dehydrogenation of propane (Figure 4).</p>
<p>Propane undergoes initial dehydrogenation to form propene and H2 or cracking to form methane and ethene. Propene and ethene can enter oligomerization-cracking cycles where CC bonds are broken and re-formed several times before a stable aromatic molecule forms via cyclization and dehydrogenation steps. Products exit this cycle either via dehydrogenation steps to form aromatics and H2 or via hydrogenation or cracking steps to form alkanes.</p>
<p>The primary propane dehydrogenation rate constant (k1) decreased slightly with increasing H2 concentration (Figure 10). H2 is expected to decrease the concentration of hydrogen-deficient intermediates involved in dehydrogenation reactions. Ethene hydrogenation rate constants (k3) increase with increasing H2 concentration (Figure 11).</p>
<p>Co2+ cations catalyze the recombinative desorption of hydrogen as H2, by providing alternate pathways for the kinetically relevant H2 removal steps. As a result, Co2+ cations increase propane turnover rates and the rate of formation of dehydrogenated products.1 This role of Co cations is similar to those ascribed to Zn and Ga in these reactions.2,7,16 Here, we report the specific role of Co cations and of acid sites on individual reaction stepsprimary dehydrogenation and cracking of propane, secondary hydrogenation of ethene to ethane, and alkene reactions to form aromatics.</p>
<p>The deuterium content in the products of Co/H-ZSM5 is higher than H-ZSM5 and increases with increasing Co content. Initially, protium atoms at acidic OH groups are incorporated into the reaction products. As the protons are exchanged with deuterium, the D fraction in the products increases during initial contact between a D2-containing gas phase and a protium-containing surface (Figure 15).</p>
<p>Co cations increase the rate constants for propane dehydrogenation (k1), ethene hydrogenation (k3), and alkene dehydrocyclization (k4) because Co cations catalyze the kinetically relevant hydrogen adsorptiondesorption steps for these reactions. Propane cracking rate constants are not influenced by H2 or by Co cations, because these reactions occur on Bronsted acid sites. Co cations increase the reversibility of hydrogen removal steps and the communication between the surface and the gas-phase hydrogen pools.</p>
