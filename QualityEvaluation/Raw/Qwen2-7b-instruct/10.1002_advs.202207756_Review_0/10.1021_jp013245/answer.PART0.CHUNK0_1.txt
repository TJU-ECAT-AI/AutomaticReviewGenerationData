<p>Co/H-ZSM5 catalyzes propane dehydrogenation and aromatization reactions.</p>
<p>Propane undergoes two primary reactions: dehydrogenation to propene and H2, and cracking to methane and ethene.</p>
<p>Propene and ethene then form aromatics via oligomerization-cracking reactions.</p>
<p>Both ethene and propene hydrogenate to form ethane and propane, respectively, via both hydrogen transfer from coadsorbed intermediates and dissociative adsorption of H2.</p>
<p>H2 inhibits propane dehydrogenation to propene and alkene conversion to aromatics, and increases the rate and the rate constant for ethene hydrogenation.</p>
<p>The role of Co cations is similar to those ascribed to Zn and Ga in these reactions.</p>
<p>Propane cracking rate constants (k2) were not influenced by Co cations, because cracking occurs on acid sites and its stoichiometry and mechanism do not require hydrogen.</p>
<p>The kinetic model accurately describes the experimental evolution of all reaction products.</p>
<p>The influence of H2 on the different reaction steps and the dependence of the different rate constants on the amount of exchanged Co cations in H-ZSM5 are consistent with the previously proposed role of these cations in providing sites for kinetically relevant hydrogen removal steps during propane dehydrogenation reactions.</p>
<p>Co cations increase the reversibility of hydrogen adsorption-desorption steps and the communication between the surface and the gas-phase hydrogen pools.</p>

The growing demand for propylene has led to advancements in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) methods, particularly utilizing Co/H-ZSM5 catalysts. This method allows for the conversion of propane into propene and hydrogen through dehydrogenation, and into methane and ethene via cracking. The propene and hydrogen are primary products, followed by secondary products like ethane, formed through ethene hydrogenation, and aromatics, produced from the dehydrocyclization reactions of C6+ alkenes participating in rapid oligomerization-cracking cycles. Cobalt (Co) cations facilitate the removal of hydrogen as hydrogen gas (H2) from the reactive intermediates involved in dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization steps, similar to the roles played by gallium (Ga) and zinc (Zn) cations. The presence of Co cations enhances the rates of propane dehydrogenation, ethene hydrogenation, and alkene dehydrocyclization reactions by catalyzing the hydrogen adsorption-desorption steps. However, propane cracking rate constants are not influenced by hydrogen or Co cations since cracking occurs on Bronsted acid sites. Co cations increase the reversibility of hydrogen removal steps and improve the communication between the surface and the gas-phase hydrogen pools.

对丙烯日益增长的需求推动了丙烷脱氢（PDH）方法的发展，特别是利用Co/H-ZSM5催化剂。这种方法允许将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气通过脱氢，以及通过裂解生成甲烷和乙烯。丙烯和氢气是主要产品，其次是乙烷，通过乙烯的氢化形成，以及从快速烯烃聚合裂解循环中的C6+烯烃参与的脱氢反应生成的芳烃。钴（Co）离子促进了从参与脱氢和脱氢环化步骤的活性中间体中氢的去除，类似于镓（Ga）和锌（Zn）离子的作用。存在Co离子可以增强丙烷脱氢、乙烯氢化和烯烃脱氢环化反应的速率，通过催化氢吸附-脱附步骤。然而，丙烷裂解速率常数不受氢或Co离子的影响，因为裂解发生在布隆斯特酸位点上。Co离子增加了氢去除步骤的可逆性，并改善了表面与气体相氢池之间的通信。
