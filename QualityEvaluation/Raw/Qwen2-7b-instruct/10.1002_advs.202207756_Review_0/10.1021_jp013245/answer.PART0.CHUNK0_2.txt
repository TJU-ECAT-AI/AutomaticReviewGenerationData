[1] "Co/H-ZSM5 catalysts have been recently reported to catalyze alkane dehydrocyclodimerization reactions."
[2] "On Co/H-ZSM5, propane reaction pathways include primary dehydrogenation steps that form C3H6 and primary cracking steps that form CH4 and C2H4 directly from propane."
[3] "Initial propene selectivities (extrapolated to zero reactant conversion) show a nonzero value, because propene forms directly from propane, but aromatic selectivities are initially very low and increase with increasing conversion, as expected from their formation via secondary reactions of alkenes."
[4] "Propane undergoes initial dehydrogenation to form propene and H2 or cracking to form methane and ethene."
[5] "Ethene and ethene hydrogenation rate constants (k3) increase with increasing H2 concentration (Figure 11)."
[6] "Propane dehydrogenation rate constant (k1) decreased slightly with increasing H2 concentration (Figure 10)."
[7] "Cracking rate constants (k2) per Al are similar for H-ZSM5 and for Co/H-ZSM5 with varying Co/Al ratio, except for the Co/H-ZSM5 with a Co/Al ratio of 0.05 (Figure 13)."
[8] "Ethene hydrogenation rate constants (k3) increase with increasing Co/Al ratio, because Co cations increase both the desorption of hydrogen during propane dehydrogenation, but also its microscopic reverse, the dissociative adsorption of H2, which provides the hydrogen required for ethene hydrogenation."
[9] "Rate constants for alkene conversion to aromatics (k4) are shown in Figure 14 as a function of the Co/Al ratio. This rate constant increases with increasing Co content."
[10] "The deuterium content in the products of Co/H-ZSM5 is higher than H-ZSM5 and increases with increasing Co content."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Research has debated the active Ga species, and recent studies have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts.

2. Co/H-ZSM5 catalysts have been reported to catalyze alkane dehydrocyclodimerization reactions. On this catalyst, propane undergoes primary dehydrogenation and cracking reactions, forming propene, H2, methane, and ethene. The selectivities of these products vary with the conversion level.

3. The formation of propene directly from propane and the subsequent formation of aromatics via secondary reactions of alkenes are observed in the reaction pathways. The selectivities of methane, ethene, and ethane increase with contact time, while the formation of aromatics increases with propane conversion.

4. Propane dehydrogenation and cracking reactions form propene and H2, and CH4 and C2H4, respectively. The initial propene selectivity is non-zero due to direct dehydrogenation, whereas aromatic selectivities are low initially and increase with conversion.

5. H2 affects the rate of individual reaction steps during propane conversion on Co/H-ZSM5. It decreases the propane dehydrogenation rate constant (k1) slightly but does not influence the propane cracking rate constant (k2).

6. Cracking rate constants (k2) are not influenced by H2 or Co cations, as these reactions occur on Bronsted acid sites.

7. Ethene hydrogenation rate constants (k3) increase with H2 concentration, and Co cations catalyze the hydrogen removal steps, enhancing the hydrogen availability for ethene hydrogenation.

8. Increasing amounts of Co in H-ZSM5 catalysts lead to higher propane turnover rates and the rate of formation of dehydrogenated products. Co cations provide sites for hydrogen removal steps.

9. The rate constant corresponding to alkene reactions to form aromatics (k4) increases with Co content, suggesting that Co cations enhance alkene dehydrogenation and cyclization reactions to form aromatics.

10. Co2+ cations increase the reversibility of hydrogen removal steps, facilitating better communication between the surface and the gas-phase hydrogen pools.

1. 对丙烯日益增长的需求推动了新生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）的发展。Ga/H-ZSM-5 催化剂用于PDH 的理解已显著发展。关于活性Ga物种的研究争论，以及最近的研究成果，为我们当前对这些催化剂的知识做出了贡献。

2. Co/H-ZSM5 催化剂已被报告用于催化烷烃脱氢环二聚反应。在该催化剂上，丙烷通过主要的脱氢和裂解反应形成，形成丙烯、H2、甲烷和乙烷。这些产物的选择性随着接触时间的变化而变化。

3. 从丙烷直接形成丙烯以及随后通过烯烃的二次反应形成芳香族化合物的形成路径被观察到。甲烷、乙烯和乙烷的形成选择性随接触时间增加，而芳香族化合物的形成选择性则随丙烷转化率增加。

4. 丙烷脱氢和裂解反应形成丙烯和H2，以及CH4 和C2H4。初始丙烯选择性非零，因为它是通过直接脱氢形成的，而芳香族选择性最初很低，随转化率增加。

5. 在Co/H-ZSM5 上进行丙烷转化时，H2 减少了丙烷脱氢步骤的速率常数（k1），但没有影响丙烷裂解速率常数（k2）。

6. 丙烷裂解速率常数（k2）不受H2 或Co 离子的影响，因为这些反应发生在Bronsted 酸位点上。

7. 乙烷氢化速率常数（k3）随H2 浓度增加，Co 离子催化氢移除步骤，增加了乙烷氢化的氢可用性。

8. Co含量的增加导致H-ZSM5 催化剂的丙烷周转率和形成脱氢产物的速率提高。Co 离子提供了氢移除步骤的站点。

9. 芳烃反应速率常数（k4）随Co 含量增加而增加，表明Co 离子增强了烯烃脱氢和环化反应以形成芳烃。

10. Co2+ 离子增加了氢移除步骤的可逆性，促进了表面与气体相氢池之间的更好通信。
