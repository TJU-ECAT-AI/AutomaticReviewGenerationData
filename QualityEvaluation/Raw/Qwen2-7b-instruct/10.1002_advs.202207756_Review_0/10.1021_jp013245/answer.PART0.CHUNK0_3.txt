<p>On Co/H-ZSM5, propane reaction pathways include primary dehydrogenation steps that form C3H6 and primary cracking steps that form CH4 and C2H4 directly from propane.1 Secondary products include C2H6 and C6C8 aromatics.1 Aromatics form via dehydrocyclization reactions of C6+ alkenes, which form and participate in rapid acid-catalyzed oligomerization-cracking cycles, as previously reported on Zn/H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5.2,7-9 Initial propene selectivities (extrapolated to zero reactant conversion) show a nonzero value, because propene forms directly from propane, but aromatic selectivities are initially very low and increase with increasing conversion, as expected from their formation via secondary reactions of alkenes.1 Methane, ethene, and ethane selectivities are shown as a function of conversion on Co/H-ZSM5 (Co/Al = 0.17) in Figure 1.</p>
<p>These conclusions are consistent with the product site-yields plots shown in Figures 2 and 3 on Co/H-ZSM5 (Co/Al = 0.12). Methane site-yields increase linearly with contact time, suggesting that methane forms predominantly from propane and not from the propene products, which become more abundant with increasing contact time (Figure 2). Ethene site-yield curves show that ethene formation rates, given by the local slope of the site-yield curve, decrease, while ethane formation rates increase, with increasing contact time (Figure 3).</p>
<p>The 13C content and the isotopomer distribution in products formed from 2-13C-propane reactants can also be used to probe propane reaction pathways. Oligomerization-cracking cycles lead to increasingly binomial isotopomer distributions as alkenes spend longer times within such cycles before their irreversible conversion to aromatics. 9,16 At low conversions, propene molecules do not show a binomial 13C isotopomer distribution and contain mostly one 13C atom, because they form initially only via direct dehydrogenation of propane (Figure 4).</p>
<p>Propane undergoes initial dehydrogenation to form propene and H2 or cracking to form methane and ethene. Propene and ethene can enter oligomerization-cracking cycles where CC bonds are broken and re-formed several times before a stable aromatic molecule forms via cyclization and dehydrogenation steps. Products exit this cycle either via dehydrogenation steps to form aromatics and H2 or via hydrogenation or cracking steps to form alkanes.</p>
<p>The primary propane dehydrogenation rate constant (k1) decreased slightly with increasing H2 concentration (Figure 10). H2 is expected to decrease the concentration of hydrogen-deficient intermediates involved in dehydrogenation reactions. Ethene hydrogenation rate constants (k3) increase with increasing H2 concentration (Figure 11).</p>
<p>Co2+ cations catalyze the recombinative desorption of hydrogen as H2, by providing alternate pathways for the kinetically relevant H2 removal steps. As a result, Co2+ cations increase propane turnover rates and the rate of formation of dehydrogenated products.1 This role of Co cations is similar to those ascribed to Zn and Ga in these reactions.2,7,16 Here, we report the specific role of Co cations and of acid sites on individual reaction stepsprimary dehydrogenation and cracking of propane, secondary hydrogenation of ethene to ethane, and alkene reactions to form aromatics.</p>
<p>The deuterium content in the products of Co/H-ZSM5 is higher than H-ZSM5 and increases with increasing Co content. Initially, protium atoms at acidic OH groups are incorporated into the reaction products. As the protons are exchanged with deuterium, the D fraction in the products increases during initial contact between a D2-containing gas phase and a protium-containing surface (Figure 15).</p>
<p>Co cations increase the rate constants for propane dehydrogenation (k1), ethene hydrogenation (k3), and alkene dehydrocyclization (k4) because Co cations catalyze the kinetically relevant hydrogen adsorptiondesorption steps for these reactions. Propane cracking rate constants are not influenced by H2 or by Co cations, because these reactions occur on Bronsted acid sites. Co cations increase the reversibility of hydrogen removal steps and the communication between the surface and the gas-phase hydrogen pools.</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation pathways on Co/H-ZSM5 include primary dehydrogenation to form propene and hydrogen, as well as cracking to form methane and ethene. Secondary products include ethane, formed through ethene hydrogenation, and aromatics, formed via dehydrocyclization of C6+ alkenes in rapid oligomerization-cracking cycles.
2. The rate constant for propane dehydrogenation (k1) decreased slightly with increasing hydrogen (H2) concentration, while the rate constant for ethene hydrogenation (k3) increased with H2 concentration.
3. Co2+ cations enhance the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation steps by catalyzing the reversible hydrogen removal, increasing the rate of propane dehydrogenation, ethene hydrogenation, and alkene dehydrocyclization to aromatics.
4. The reversibility of hydrogen desorption steps during propane conversion on Co/H-ZSM5 is enhanced by Co cations, allowing for more effective communication between the surface and gas-phase hydrogen pools.
