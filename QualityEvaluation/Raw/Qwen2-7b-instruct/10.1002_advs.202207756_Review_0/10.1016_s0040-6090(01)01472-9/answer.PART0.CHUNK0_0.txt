[1] "Some of the difficulties in interpreting literature data concerning chemisorption on polycrystalline zinc oxide stem from a poor characterization of surface morpholo- gy."
[2] "Zinc oxide becomes an n-type semiconductor when prepared in a relatively high- surface-area form, finding important applications in heterogeneous catalysis and in gas-sensor technology."
[3] "Surface phenomena responsible for catalytic activity and gas sensing ability of ZnO stem from a combination of factors which include the presence of acid (Zn ) 2q and basic (O ) surface sites, the variety of exposed 2y crystal faces (and structures), and the possibility of electron transfer from the adsorbent to the adsorbate or vice-versa."
[4] "These features give rise to a complex surface chemistry which remains poorly understood, despite a large number of studies devoted to the adsorption of both single gases w515x and binary mixtures w1618x on ZnO."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was a debate about the active Ga species involved in the catalytic process. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by elucidating the specific roles and mechanisms of Ga species in the PDH reaction. The catalysts have been optimized for better performance, leading to more efficient propylene production.
