[1] "Surface phenomena responsible for catalytic activity and gas sensing ability of ZnO stem from a combination of factors which include the presence of acid (Zn ) 2q and basic (O ) surface sites, the variety of exposed 2y"
[2] "It was the aim of this work to carry out a detailed FTIR study on the adsorption and co-adsorption of several gases on well characterized ZnO microcrystals."
[3] "Adsorption lowers the CH symmetry from T to C , which is reflected in activation of the v (symmetric stretching) mode and discrete 4 d 3v 1 frequency shifts of the v (antisymmetric stretching) and n (bending) modes."
[4] "The magnitude of these shifts depends upon the nature y1 of the co-adsorbed gas."
[5] "This work proves that dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen affects only a small portion of sites available for coordination of other adsorbed molecules."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process involves the conversion of propane into propylene. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts play a crucial role in PDH, enabling efficient conversion. The understanding of these catalysts has evolved significantly. Initially, the debate centered around the active Ga species within the catalyst. Recent research has shed light on the complex nature of these catalysts, indicating that the activity of Ga species is influenced by various factors, including surface coverage and the chemical nature of the co-adsorbed phase. This understanding has led to advancements in the design and optimization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, contributing to more efficient and sustainable propylene production.
