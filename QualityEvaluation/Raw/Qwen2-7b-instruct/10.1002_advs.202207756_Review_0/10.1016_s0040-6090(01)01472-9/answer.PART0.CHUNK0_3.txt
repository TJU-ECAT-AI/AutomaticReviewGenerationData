[1] "Adsorption of dihydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane, and co-adsorption of H2, CO, and CH4 on zinc oxide was studied by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy."
[2] "When coverage is increased, ny1 decreases down to 1690 cm while ny1 increases up to 3512 cm."
[3] "Further details on this subject can be found elsewhere."
[4] "It is thus shown that CO displaces CH from its adsorption sites."
[5] "Simultaneously, the n(OH) band undergoes a hypsochromic shift from the initial value of 3492 up to 3499 cm."

1. The document discusses the adsorption of dihydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane on zinc oxide using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. It examines the changes in the vibrational frequencies of adsorbed molecules as their coverage on the surface increases.
2. As the coverage of hydrogen on zinc oxide increases, the frequency of the ZnH band shifts to lower wavenumbers, while the frequency of the OH band increases.
3. The document suggests that more detailed information about the subject can be found in other sources.
4. The presence of carbon monoxide causes methane to be displaced from its adsorption sites on zinc oxide, indicating that zinc ions are the primary adsorption sites for methane.
5. Upon the adsorption of methane, the n(OH) band experiences a hypsochromic shift, moving from an initial value of 3492 cm to 3499 cm.

1. 文档讨论了氢、一氧化碳和甲烷在锌氧化物上的吸附，使用傅里叶变换红外光谱法。它研究了表面覆盖度增加时吸附分子振动频率的变化。
2. 随着氢在锌氧化物上的覆盖度增加，ZnH带的频率向较低波数移动，而OH带的频率增加。
3. 文档表明，关于此主题的更多详细信息可以在其他来源中找到。
4. 碳一氧化物的存在导致甲烷从其吸附位点被锌氧化物排斥，表明锌离子是甲烷的主要吸附位点。
5. 甲烷吸附后，n(OH)带经历了一个蓝移，从初始值3492 cm 移动到3499 cm。
