[1] "Some of the difficulties in interpreting literature data concerning chemisorption on polycrystalline zinc oxide stem from a poor characterization of surface morpholo- gy."
[2] "Zinc oxide becomes an n-type semiconductor when prepared in a relatively high- surface-area form, finding important applications in heterogeneous catalysis and in gas-sensor technology."
[3] "Surface phenomena responsible for catalytic activity and gas sensing ability of ZnO stem from a combination of factors which include the presence of acid (Zn ) 2q and basic (O ) surface sites, the variety of exposed 2y crystal faces (and structures), and the possibility of electron transfer from the adsorbent to the adsorbate or vice-versa."
[4] "These features give rise to a complex surface chemistry which remains poorly understood, despite a large number of studies devoted to the adsorption of both single gases w515x and binary mixtures w1618x on ZnO."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was a debate about the active Ga species involved in the catalytic process. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by elucidating the specific roles and mechanisms of Ga species in the PDH reaction. The catalysts have been optimized for better performance, leading to more efficient propylene production.

When methane is adsorbed on zinc oxide, its CH symmetry changes from tetrahedral (T) to cubic (C). This change activates the symmetric stretching mode and leads to distinct frequency shifts in the antisymmetric stretching and bending modes. The n(OH) band experiences a blue shift from 3492 cm to 3499 cm. In comparison to methane, ethylene causes shifts of 67 cm and 42 cm in the n(ZnH) and n(OH) bands, respectively. For more detailed information, refer to w14x.

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process involves the conversion of propane into propylene. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts play a crucial role in PDH, enabling efficient conversion. The understanding of these catalysts has evolved significantly. Initially, the debate centered around the active Ga species within the catalyst. Recent research has shed light on the complex nature of these catalysts, indicating that the activity of Ga species is influenced by various factors, including surface coverage and the chemical nature of the co-adsorbed phase. This understanding has led to advancements in the design and optimization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, contributing to more efficient and sustainable propylene production.

1. The document discusses the adsorption of dihydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane on zinc oxide using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. It examines the changes in the vibrational frequencies of adsorbed molecules as their coverage on the surface increases.
2. As the coverage of hydrogen on zinc oxide increases, the frequency of the ZnH band shifts to lower wavenumbers, while the frequency of the OH band increases.
3. The document suggests that more detailed information about the subject can be found in other sources.
4. The presence of carbon monoxide causes methane to be displaced from its adsorption sites on zinc oxide, indicating that zinc ions are the primary adsorption sites for methane.
5. Upon the adsorption of methane, the n(OH) band experiences a hypsochromic shift, moving from an initial value of 3492 cm to 3499 cm.

[2] "These features give rise to a complex surface chemistry which remains poorly understood, despite a large number of studies devoted to the adsorption of both single gases w515x and binary mixtures w1618x on ZnO."
[3] "We only remark that frequency shifts take place in discrete steps (Fig. 2). This fact supports the model of Tsyganenko et al. w21x which considers discrete geometrical arrangements of neighbouring adsorbates on an extended wurtzite-type (1010) face, the structure of which has been discussed in detail by Duke w22x."
[4] "The band at 2989 cm is assigned to the n (antisymmetric) CH stretching mode, which 3 appears at 3020 cm in free CH . The 2872 cm band correspond to the n (symmetric) stretching mode,1 which is IR-inactive for free CH (2914 cm ) and y1 becomes activated in the perturbed (adsorbed) molecule."
[5] "When CO was dosed (at 77 K) on ZnO having pre-adsorbed methane, the characteristic bands of adsorbed CH (Section 3.4) were found to disappear. Fig. 5 shows that the only IR adsorption bands remaining after CO adsorption are a sharp peak at 2168 cm , which corresponds to adsorbed CO, and the characteristic bands of free methane at 3020 (n ) and at 1302 cm (n ); it y1 3 4 is thus shown that CO displaces CH from its adsorption 4 sites."

2. Dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen affects only a small portion of sites available for coordination of other adsorbed molecules. As more sites are occupied by co-adsorbates, several coverage-dependent arrangements of co-adsorbed phases arise, affecting the n(ZnH) and n(OH) modes to varying extents depending on surface coverage and the chemical nature of the co-adsorbed phase.
