[1] "Surface phenomena responsible for catalytic activity and gas sensing ability of ZnO stem from a combination of factors which include the presence of acid (Zn ) 2q and basic (O ) surface sites, the variety of exposed 2y"
[2] "These features give rise to a complex surface chemistry which remains poorly understood, despite a large number of studies devoted to the adsorption of both single gases w515x and binary mixtures w1618x on ZnO."
[3] "We only remark that frequency shifts take place in discrete steps (Fig. 2). This fact supports the model of Tsyganenko et al. w21x which considers discrete geometrical arrangements of neighbouring adsorbates on an extended wurtzite-type (1010) face, the structure of which has been discussed in detail by Duke w22x."
[4] "The band at 2989 cm is assigned to the n (antisymmetric) CH stretching mode, which 3 appears at 3020 cm in free CH . The 2872 cm band correspond to the n (symmetric) stretching mode,1 which is IR-inactive for free CH (2914 cm ) and y1 becomes activated in the perturbed (adsorbed) molecule."
[5] "When CO was dosed (at 77 K) on ZnO having pre-adsorbed methane, the characteristic bands of adsorbed CH (Section 3.4) were found to disappear. Fig. 5 shows that the only IR adsorption bands remaining after CO adsorption are a sharp peak at 2168 cm , which corresponds to adsorbed CO, and the characteristic bands of free methane at 3020 (n ) and at 1302 cm (n ); it y1 3 4 is thus shown that CO displaces CH from its adsorption 4 sites."

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, including debates around active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts.

2. Dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen affects only a small portion of sites available for coordination of other adsorbed molecules. As more sites are occupied by co-adsorbates, several coverage-dependent arrangements of co-adsorbed phases arise, affecting the n(ZnH) and n(OH) modes to varying extents depending on surface coverage and the chemical nature of the co-adsorbed phase.

1. 对丙烯日益增长的需求已经影响了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经发展，包括关于活性Ga物种的争论。最近的研究发现已经为我们当前对这些催化剂的知识做出了贡献。

2. 分离化化学吸附的氢只会影响一小部分可用的位点进行其他吸附分子的配位。随着更多的位点被共吸附物占据，表面覆盖度依赖的共吸附相的各种排列出现，根据表面覆盖度和共吸附物化学性质的不同程度地影响n(ZnH)和n(OH)模式。
