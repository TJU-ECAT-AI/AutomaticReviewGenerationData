[1] "Adsorption 2q lowers the CH symmetry from T to C , which is reflected in activation of the v (symmetric stretching) mode and discrete 4 d 3v 1 frequency shifts of the v (antisymmetric stretching) and n (bending) modes."
[2] "Simultaneously, the n(OH) band undergoes a hypsochromic shift from the initial value of 3492 up to 3499 cm ."
[3] "In the case of ethylene corresponding shifts were y67 and q42 cm , respectively."
[4] "Further details on this subject can be found elsewhere w14x."

When methane is adsorbed on zinc oxide, its CH symmetry changes from tetrahedral (T) to cubic (C). This change activates the symmetric stretching mode and leads to distinct frequency shifts in the antisymmetric stretching and bending modes. The n(OH) band experiences a blue shift from 3492 cm to 3499 cm. In comparison to methane, ethylene causes shifts of 67 cm and 42 cm in the n(ZnH) and n(OH) bands, respectively.

当甲烷吸附在锌氧化物上时，其CH对称性从四面体（T）变为立方（C）。这种变化激活了对称拉伸模式，并导致反向伸缩模式和弯曲模式的频率发生离散变化。n(OH)波段经历了一个蓝移，从3492 cm增加到3499 cm。与甲烷相比，乙烯引起n(ZnH)和n(OH)波段分别发生67 cm和42 cm的位移。对于更多详细信息，请参阅w14x。
