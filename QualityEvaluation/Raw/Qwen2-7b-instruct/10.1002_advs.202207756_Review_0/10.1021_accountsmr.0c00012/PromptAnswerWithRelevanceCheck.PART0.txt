[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing."
[2] "The PDH reaction is as illustrated below:"
[3] "Comparatively, Pt-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly than CrOx-based catalysts."
[4] "Intrinsically, propane dehydrogenation as structure-insensitive reactions can occur on the individual active site. However, larger particles induce structure-sensitive side reactions, such as cracking, deep dehydrogenation, etc."
[5] "For metal oxides, differing from metallic Pt in activation of CH bonds, MO sites serve as the adsorption sites for propane molecules."
[6] "Promoters such as Cu, Fe, Mn, Co, Sn, Ga, In, Zn can be alloyed with Pt."
[7] "Ordered intermetallic alloy (IMA) contains one active metal and another inert component, which can disperse the active sites into isolated atoms."
[8] "Coreshell nanostructures provide an effective approach for decreasing the usage of noble metals through constructing 3dTM@noble metal NCs."
[9] "Metal oxides exhibit lower cost but higher barriers of CH activation and coking inclination."
[10] "The CH bond cleavage has been promoted by inducing intrinsic defect sites, such as oxygen vacancies, hydroxyls, and hydrides on the surface and heterogeneous doping in the bulk."
[11] "The confinement approach of embedding active sites in zeolite frameworks significantly inhibits the sintering of metal NPs."
[12] "As discussed above, dehydrogenation of propane on extended metal and oxide surface is significantly dependent on its surface structures, namely, the geometric features and electronic properties, where adsorption strength and manner of adsorbates can be both greatly perturbed."

[14] "For supported Pt-based catalysts, it is generally accepted that the alkali metal promoters such as Mg help to neutralize the surface acid sites."

Morphology and composition, such as changing compositions, constructing intermetallic compounds, single-atom catalysts, coreshell, metaloxide interaction, encapsulation, defect engineering, and so forth, controlled by promoters and supports on metal and oxide NCs have been proved as the most effective strategies to regulate the geometric features and electronic properties and thus increase the propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and antideactivation capacity."
[16] "Despite the significant progress, future challenges remain:(1) NCs with well-defined morphologies and active sites are required to investigate the propertystructure relations at the nanoscale level."
[17] "In situ or operando technologies provide fundamental insights into the structures of NCs under reaction conditions, for illustrating the geometric and electronic effects and identifying their individual influence."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH), aiming to efficiently convert propane into propylene. PDH faces challenges due to its endothermic nature, requiring high temperatures, which affects selectivity and catalyst stability. Nanostructured catalysts (NCs) based on metals and/or metal oxides with tunable geometric and electronic properties are crucial because they inherently influence the adsorption of propyl intermediates on the catalyst surface. These NCs are being rationally designed to address the challenges faced in PDH reactions.

2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with the recognition of the active Ga species. Recent research has shown that a very low enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ·mol1 is observed on [GaH]2+ together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, which contributes to the enhanced catalytic performance. This finding resolves the ongoing debate about the active Ga species and highlights the importance of both the GaH species and the basic framework oxygen in the PDH reaction.
