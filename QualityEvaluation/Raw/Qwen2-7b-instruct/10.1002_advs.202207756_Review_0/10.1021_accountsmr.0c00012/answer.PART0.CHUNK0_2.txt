The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH is seen as a promising method for propylene production, offering advantages over methanol-to-olefins and Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins. The regulation of material structure and reaction performance at the molecular and atomic levels is a focus area. The PDH process involves the adsorption of propyl intermediates on the catalyst surface. To enhance the PDH process, strategies such as promoter and support effects have been developed. Catalysts with tunable geometric and electronic properties play a crucial role. Promoters like Cu, Fe, Mn, Co, Sn, Ga, In, Zn can enhance dispersion and electronic states. Supports like Al2O3, SiO2, zeolites can regulate the shape of nanostructured particles and metals-support interaction.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新型生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH被认为是丙烯生产最有前景的方法之一，与甲醇到烯烃和费希尔-特罗普斯到烯烃等相比具有优势。在分子和原子级别上调节材料结构和反应性能是关注的重点领域。PDH过程涉及丙基中间体在催化剂表面的吸附。为了提高PDH过程，开发了促进剂和支撑效应策略。具有可调几何和电子性质的金属和/或金属氧化物催化剂起着关键作用。如Cu、Fe、Mn、Co、Sn、Ga、In、Zn这样的促进剂可以增强分散并调整电子状态。Al2O3、SiO2、沸石等支持可以调节纳米结构粒子的形状以及金属-支持相互作用。还原处理可以引入氧缺陷、羟基团、氢化物等，从而增强催化活性。Mg这样的促进剂可以帮助分散V2O5纳米颗粒成聚合化的VOx，减少焦炭形成。通过金属促进剂的封装通过MSI可以改变电子状态，影响催化性能。介孔材料提供了一种访问更多活性位点的替代方案，并且限制了氧化物NP的聚集以防止结块。未来面临的挑战包括设计具有明确形态和活性位点的NC，利用原位/在线技术。扩大筛选范围至更便宜的过渡金属以及发展规模化合成技术仍是一个挑战。化学循环氧化性脱氢（CL-ODH）提供了潜在可能性，但需要开发无毒的氧气载体，具有高活性和稳定性。
