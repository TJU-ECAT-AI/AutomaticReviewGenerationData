[1] "The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[2] "Among propylene production processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH), a process of direct conversion of propane into propylene and hydrogen, is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods."
[3] "A defect occurs when oxides are treated by a reductive treatment, leading to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated M cations in MO sites."
[4] "Incorporating a small amount of Mg helps disperse V2O5 nanoparticles into polymerized VOx, decreasing the coke formation on VOx."
[5] "Considering the unique properties of VOx/MO systems, consisting of isolated and/or polymeric nanostructures that wet the supporting MO, we constructed the submonolayer and/or monolayer VOx nanoclusters on Al2O3 and ZrO2."
[6] "MCM-41-supported VOx species exhibited superior PDH performance, showing that isolated VOx species are more active than their oligomerized counterparts."

The demand for propylene has driven the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a promising method for propylene production. Reductive treatments of oxides introduce defects, such as coordinatively unsaturated M cations, enhancing CH bond activation. Adding magnesium to vanadium oxides increases dispersion and reduces coke formation. Constructing submonolayer or monolayer vanadium oxide nanoclusters on supports improves PDH performance. MCM-41-supported vanadium oxides demonstrate that isolated species are more active than aggregated forms.
