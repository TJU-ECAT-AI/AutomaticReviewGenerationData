[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing."
[2] "The PDH reaction is as illustrated below:"
[3] "Comparatively, Pt-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly than CrOx-based catalysts."
[4] "Intrinsically, propane dehydrogenation as structure-insensitive reactions can occur on the individual active site. However, larger particles induce structure-sensitive side reactions, such as cracking, deep dehydrogenation, etc."

Morphology and composition, such as changing compositions, constructing intermetallic compounds, single-atom catalysts, coreshell, metaloxide interaction, encapsulation, defect engineering, and so forth, controlled by promoters and supports on metal and oxide NCs have been proved as the most effective strategies to regulate the geometric features and electronic properties and thus increase the propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and antideactivation capacity."
