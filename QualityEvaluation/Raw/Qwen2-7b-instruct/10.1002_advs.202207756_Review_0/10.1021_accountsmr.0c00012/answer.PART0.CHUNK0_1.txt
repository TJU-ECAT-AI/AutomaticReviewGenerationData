1. The demand for propylene has led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a method for propylene production. This technology has gained prominence due to the environmental benefits of Pt-based catalysts over CrOx-based ones.

2. In the PDH reaction, the cleavage of propane's CH bonds is categorized into two types: α-type, which occurs at the terminal methyl group, and β-type, which happens at the central carbon, producing 1-propyl and 2-propyl species, respectively.

3. The PDH process typically involves four stages: propane adsorption, CH bond cleavage, C3H6 desorption, and site recovery on the catalyst surface.

4. The single-site Ga species generated through grafting of [Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)] on silica and subsequent thermolysis at 500°C under high vacuum conditions exhibited remarkable catalytic properties, characterized by high activity, selectivity, and stability.

1. 对丙烯的需求推动了丙烷脱氢化（PDH）作为丙烯生产技术的发展。由于铂基催化剂在环境方面的优势，这种技术获得了重视，相较于铬氧化物基催化剂。

2. 在PDH反应中，丙烷的CH键断裂被分为两种类型：α型，在末端甲基上发生；β型，在中心碳上发生，分别产生1-丙基和2-丙基物种。

3. PDH过程通常包括四个阶段：丙烷吸附、CH键断裂、C3H6释放以及催化表面的站点恢复。

4. 通过在硅胶上嫁接Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)，随后在高真空条件下于500°C进行热解制得的单个Ga位点表现出卓越的催化性能，特征为高活性、选择性和稳定性。
