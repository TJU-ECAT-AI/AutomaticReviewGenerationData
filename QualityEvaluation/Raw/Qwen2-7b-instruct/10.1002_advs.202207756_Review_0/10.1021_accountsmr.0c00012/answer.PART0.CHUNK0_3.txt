[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry."
[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH), aiming to efficiently convert propane into propylene. PDH faces challenges due to its endothermic nature, requiring high temperatures, which affects selectivity and catalyst stability. Nanostructured catalysts (NCs) based on metals and/or metal oxides with tunable geometric and electronic properties are crucial because they inherently influence the adsorption of propyl intermediates on the catalyst surface. These NCs are being rationally designed to address the challenges faced in PDH reactions.

2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with the recognition of the active Ga species. Recent research has shown that a very low enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ·mol1 is observed on [GaH]2+ together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, which contributes to the enhanced catalytic performance. This finding resolves the ongoing debate about the active Ga species and highlights the importance of both the GaH species and the basic framework oxygen in the PDH reaction.

1. 对丙烯的日益增长的需求推动了新生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），旨在高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。PDH面临挑战，因其为吸热过程，需要高温操作，这影响了选择性和催化剂稳定性。基于金属和/或金属氧化物的纳米结构催化剂（NCs）具有可调的几何和电子性质，对丙烯中间体在催化剂表面的吸附起关键作用。这些NCs正在被合理设计以解决PDH反应面临的挑战。

2. 对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已经发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论得到了解决。最近的研究表明，在[GaH]2+上观察到非常低的焓变壁垒（56 kJ·mol1），并伴有基本框架氧的Brnsted酸位点，这有助于增强催化性能。这一发现解决了活性Ga物种的争议，并强调了GaH物种和基本框架氧在PDH反应中的重要性。
