<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the existence of hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) between adsorbed oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) molecules, as well as hydroxyl (-OH) groups on a silica surface. It also suggests that a similar hydrogen bonding competitive complexation process might regulate the effectiveness of fluorocarbons. Furthermore, it mentions the impact of H-bond donors on the glass transition temperature of linear alcohols, indicating that H-bonding plays a role in various chemical interactions and properties.
