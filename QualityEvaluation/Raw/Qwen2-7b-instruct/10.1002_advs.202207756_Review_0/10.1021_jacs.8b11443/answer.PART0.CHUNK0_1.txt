Answer: The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the need for more efficient and selective catalytic processes. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, with researchers focusing on the identification of active Ga species and the optimization of the catalyst preparation process. Recent studies have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by elucidating the role of specific Ga species and their interaction with the ZSM-5 framework, leading to enhanced selectivity and activity in PDH reactions.
