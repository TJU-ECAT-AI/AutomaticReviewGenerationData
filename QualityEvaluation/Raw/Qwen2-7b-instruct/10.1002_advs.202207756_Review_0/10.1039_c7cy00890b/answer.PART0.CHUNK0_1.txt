The production of light alkanesethane and propanehas increased from 237 000 barrels per day in 2005 to over 400 000 barrels per day in 2015 because of extraction of shale gas using hydraulic fracturing technology.1 As a result, the cost of ethane and propane has decreased substantially, creat- ing an opportunity for converting these alkanes into more valuable products (olefins and aromatics). Aromatics (BTX) are mainly produced by naphtha reforming, a process in which the cost of naphtha represents about 80% of the BTX production cost.2 Therefore, replacing naphtha with inexpen- sive and abundant feedstocks such as light alkanes is an eco- nomically desirable goal and could reduce the environmental footprint of aromatics synthesis.

Early research on the aromatization of light alkanes was conducted using bi-functional catalysts such as Pt/Al2O3 3,4 or metal oxides/alumina.5,6 Although metals, such as Pt, have advantages such as increasing the rate of dehydrogenation,they also catalyze hydrogenolysis of the products which is detrimental to the process economics.7 More recently, ZnII) or GaIII) exchanged into aluminosilicate zeolites has shown promising properties for the aromatization of light alkanes.2,810

Processes for aromatization of light alkanes propane and butaneson acid zeolites, such as H-ZSM-5 in Mobil's M2-forming (in which ethane was considered non- aromatizable),11 or on metal (Ga or Zn) loaded ZSM-5 such as the Cyclar process by BP/UOP,12 Topas by Topse,13 Alpha by Asahi/Sanyo,14 Aroforming by IFP/Salutec and Z-forming by Mitsubishi/Chiyoda15 have been developed.

In the aromatization reaction of light alkanes, the feed composition determines the overall reactivity, product yield,rate of deactivation and required reaction temperature. The more reactive the components and the lower their hydrogen content (such as olefins), result in higher aromatics yield, in lower reaction temperature and in faster deactivation rate

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift has led to the exploration and optimization of catalysts for PDH, such as Ga/H-ZSM-5. The debate around active Ga species highlights the complexity of catalyst performance. Recent research findings have contributed to a better understanding of the role of Ga in PDH, emphasizing the importance of the balance between metal/Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites (BAS) for product selectivity. The active Ga species are likely involved in the activation and dehydrogenation processes, influencing the overall efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process. The ongoing research aims to refine the catalyst design and operating conditions to optimize propylene yield while minimizing by-product formation, contributing to more sustainable and economically viable production methods.
