[1] "The production of light alkanesethane and propanehas increased from 237 000 barrels per day in 2005 to over 400 000 barrels per day in 2015 because of extraction of shale gas using hydraulic fracturing technology.1 As a result, the cost of ethane and propane has decreased substantially, creat- ing an opportunity for converting these alkanes into more valuable products (olefins and aromatics)."

[2] "Aromatics (BTX) are mainly produced by naphtha reforming, a process in which the cost of naphtha represents about 80% of the BTX production cost.2 Therefore, replacing naphtha with inexpen- sive and abundant feedstocks such as light alkanes is an eco- nomically desirable goal and could reduce the environmental footprint of aromatics synthesis."

[3] "Early research on the aromatization of light alkanes was conducted using bi-functional catalysts such as Pt/Al2O3 3,4 or metal oxides/alumina.5,6 Although metals, such as Pt, have advantages such as increasing the rate of dehydrogenation,they also catalyze hydrogenolysis of the products which is detrimental to the process economics."

[4] "More recently, ZnII) or GaIII) exchanged into aluminosilicate zeolites has shown promising properties for the aromatization of light alkanes.2,810 Processes for aromatization of light alkanes propane and butaneson acid zeolites, such as H-ZSM-5 in Mobil's M2-forming (in which ethane was considered non- aromatizable),11 or on metal (Ga or Zn) loaded ZSM-5 such as the Cyclar process by BP/UOP,12 Topas by Topse,13 Alpha by Asahi/Sanyo,14 Aroforming by IFP/Salutec and Z-forming by Mitsubishi/Chiyoda15 have been developed."

[5] "In the aromatization reaction of light alkanes, the feed composition determines the overall reactivity, product yield,rate of deactivation and required reaction temperature. The more reactive the components and the lower their hydrogen content (such as olefins), result in higher aromatics yield, in lower reaction temperature and in faster deactivation rate"

[6] "It is known that BAS can oligomerize ethyl- ene; however, it seems that Zn in the form of Lewis sites can also catalyze oligomerization/aromatization of ethane since high Zn/BAS showed high selectivity toward aromatics."

[7] "The cause of the deactivation was coke formation, reducing acces- sibility to active sites."

1. The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), aiming to convert cheaper feedstocks like ethane and propane into more valuable olefins and aromatics. This shift reduces the reliance on expensive naphtha as a feedstock in the production of aromatics.

2. The economic benefits of substituting naphtha with abundant feedstocks like ethane and propane for aromatics synthesis are significant, offering cost savings and potentially reducing environmental impact. 

3. Traditional methods of aromatization using bi-functional catalysts like Pt/Al2O3 or metal oxides/alumina have limitations, including the catalysis of hydrogenolysis, which can be economically detrimental.

4. Research has shown that zinc (Zn) and gallium (Ga) exchanged into aluminosilicate zeolites are effective catalysts for the aromatization of light alkanes. Processes like the Cyclar process by BP/UOP, Topas by Topse, Alpha by Asahi/Sanyo, Aroforming by IFP/Salutec, and Z-forming by Mitsubishi/Chiyoda have been developed using these catalysts.

5. The efficiency of aromatization processes depends on various factors including the reactivity of the feed components, their hydrogen content, and the resulting product yield, deactivation rate, and optimal reaction temperature. 

6. The ability of zinc sites, especially in the form of Lewis acids, to catalyze both the oligomerization and aromatization of ethane suggests a novel approach in the development of efficient catalysts for light alkane conversion.

7. The deactivation of catalysts, such as the formation of coke, affects their performance by reducing the accessibility to active sites, necessitating the development of strategies to mitigate this issue.

1. 对丙烯需求的增长推动了新型生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），旨在将成本较低的乙烷和丙烷等原料转化为更有价值的烯烃和芳香族化合物。这种转变减少了对昂贵石脑油作为芳烃合成原料的依赖。

2. 将廉价原料如乙烷和丙烷替换为芳烃合成的经济优势显著，既能降低成本，又可能减少环境影响。

3. 传统的芳香化方法使用双功能催化剂如Pt/Al2O3或金属氧化物/铝酸盐存在局限性，包括催化氢解，这可能对生产工艺经济性产生不利影响。

4. 研究表明，锌（Zn）和镓（Ga）交换到铝硅酸盐沸石中是有效催化剂，用于轻质烷烃的芳香化。BP/UOP的Cyclar工艺、Topse的Topas、Asahi/Sanyo的Alpha、IFP/Salutec的Aroforming和Mitsubishi/Chiyoda的Z-forming等过程已经开发出来，使用这些催化剂。

5. 芳香化过程的效率取决于多种因素，包括反应物的活性、它们的氢含量以及由此产生的产品产率、脱活速率和最优反应温度。

6. 锌位点，尤其是以路易斯酸形式存在的锌位点，能够催化乙烷的聚合作用和芳香化，表明在轻质烷烃转换方面发展高效催化剂的一种新途径。

7. 催化剂的失活，如焦炭形成，影响其性能，因为减少了活性位点的可访问性，需要开发策略来解决这个问题。
