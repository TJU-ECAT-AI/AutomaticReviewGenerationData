Early research on the aromatization of light alkanes was conducted using bi-functional catalysts such as Pt/Al2O3 3,4 or metal oxides/alumina.5,6 Although metals, such as Pt, have advantages such as increasing the rate of dehydrogenation,they also catalyze hydrogenolysis of the products which is detrimental to the process economics.7 More recently, ZnII) or GaIII) exchanged into aluminosilicate zeolites has shown promising properties for the aromatization of light alkanes.2,810 Processes for aromatization of light alkanes propane and butaneson acid zeolites, such as H-ZSM-5 in Mobil's M2-forming (in which ethane was considered non- aromatizable),11 or on metal (Ga or Zn) loaded ZSM-5 such as the Cyclar process by BP/UOP,12 Topas by Topse,13 Alpha by Asahi/Sanyo,14 Aroforming by IFP/Salutec and Z-forming by Mitsubishi/Chiyoda15 have been developed.

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with ongoing debates about active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, highlighting the importance of balance between metal/Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites (BAS) for product selectivity in PDH.

对丙烯的日益增长的需求已经影响了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已随着关于活性Ga物种的持续辩论而发展。最近的研究发现为当前关于这些催化剂的知识做出了贡献，强调了在PDH中金属/路易斯酸中心与Brnsted酸位点（BAS）之间的平衡对于产品选择性的关键性。
