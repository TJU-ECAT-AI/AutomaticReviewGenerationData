[1] "Early research on the aromatization of light alkanes was conducted using bi-functional catalysts such as Pt/Al2O3 3,4 or metal oxides/alumina.5,6 Although metals, such as Pt, have advantages such as increasing the rate of dehydrogenation,they also catalyze hydrogenolysis of the products which is detrimental to the process economics.7 More recently, ZnII) or GaIII) exchanged into aluminosilicate zeolites has shown promising properties for the aromatization of light alkanes.2,810"
[2] "Processes for aromatization of light alkanes propane and butaneson acid zeolites, such as H-ZSM-5 in Mobil's M2-forming (in which ethane was considered non- aromatizable),11 or on metal (Ga or Zn) loaded ZSM-5 such as the Cyclar process by BP/UOP,12 Topas by Topse,13 Alpha by Asahi/Sanyo,14 Aroforming by IFP/Salutec and Z-forming by Mitsubishi/Chiyoda15 have been developed."
[3] "Increasing the amount of zinc in the samples resulted in a decrease in the microporous volume of samples (Table 1). This is due primarily to the formation (ZnO)n clusters in the zeolite pores,25 but is also due, in part, to the higher density of the samples. In the case of ZSM-5 loaded with 10% zinc, a significant decrease in micropore volume was observed (about 39% lower microporous vol- ume than that of 5.3% Zn-ZSM-5), which indicates potential pore blocking by ZnO."
[4] "Zn-ZSM-5 showed the highest activity for ethane conver- sion. The active sites for ethane activation were zinc sites (Zn2+, [ZnOZn]2+ or small clusters of ZnO). Zn, as Lewis acid sites, can catalyze aromatization while ZnO clusters (on their own) cannot. Increasing Zn/BAS resulted in an increase in both ethane conversion and selectivity toward aromatics,while for ethylene aromatization low Zn/BAS forms more aro- matics. This could be due to the fast reaction of ethylene compared to ethane on BAS."
[5] "The cause of the deactivation was coke formation, reducing acces- sibility to active sites."

1. The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), aiming to efficiently convert propane into propylene. This is crucial as propylene is a key intermediate in the production of various petrochemicals and plastics. Research on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has seen advancements, focusing on understanding the active Ga species and their role in the conversion process. While the debate around the specific active species continues, recent studies have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by elucidating their mechanism and optimization parameters for efficient propylene production.

2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through a series of studies that have shed light on the active Ga species and their catalytic activity. Despite the ongoing debate, recent research findings have provided insights into the mechanism of PDH over these catalysts, highlighting factors such as the support properties, metal loading, and the nature of Ga species that influence the efficiency of propylene production. These findings contribute to the development of more effective and economically viable PDH processes.
