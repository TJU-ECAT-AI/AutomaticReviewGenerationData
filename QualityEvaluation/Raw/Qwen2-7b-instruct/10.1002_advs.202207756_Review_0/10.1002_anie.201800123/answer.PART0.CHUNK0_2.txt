[1] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively.4 The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."
[2] "Commercial production of propylene is mainly based on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts.2 With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."
[3] "Hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst (VOH) are produced under H2 pre-reduction, and the catalytic performance for PDH is closely connected to the concentration of VOH species on the catalyst."
[4] "The catalyst covered by hydroxyl groups, which mainly contains V4+ species throughout the reaction, exhibits a relatively low PDH activity but good resistance to coke formation."
[5] "The effects of H2 pretreatment were further characterized by in situ DRIFTS experiments. The 6V sample was in situ reduced under a H2 atmosphere in the sample cell of a DRIFTS instrument, and the evolution of the surface species were monitored by the IR spectra."
[6] "The intensity of the VOH band is normalized by relative intensity (defined in the experimental section in the Supporting Information) to quantitatively describe the concentration of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species."
[7] "A scheme of the VOH evolution is proposed. The VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is firstly reduced by H2, and the V=O structure on the outer most surface is combined with the adsorbed H2 molecules to form an adsorbed H2O, which is supported by the generation of a broad band attributed to H2O and a negative band led by V=O consumption."
[8] "As shown in Figure3A presents the DRIFTS profiles of a series of 6V samples after a 30minute reaction at 600C, among which the samples are pretreated with H2 for different periods of time (3120min)."
[9] "Our previous research showed that IR bands between 1620 and 1555cm1 resulted from coke deposits on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, and the location of the peak herein falls well within the range.5a Therefore, the IR band at 1590cm1 is attributed to coke deposits on the 6V samples and its intensity represents the amount of the coke deposit."
[10] "Bader charge analysis indicates the V oxidation state follows the trend V2O5>V2O5H2>V2O3, and is consistent with the valence-state distribution of vanadium by XPS."
[11] "The highest dehydrogenation barrier, 1.98eV, was observed over V2O5H2, which is consistent with the lowest initial activity observed experimentally with the existence of a surface VOH group."
[12] "In terms of the V2O5 (structure I), although it cannot bind C3H6 strongly, its dehydrogenation barrier is low compared with that of V2O5H2 (structure II). Therefore, V2O5 (structure I) can lose a top-site oxygen easily by forming acetone7f (see SectionS2.2.2 and FigureS31)."

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the low price of propane from shale gas production. PDH offers a more economically viable option for on-purpose propylene production compared to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes.

2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, especially regarding the active Ga species. Research has contributed to identifying the role of hydroxyl groups on the surface of supported vanadium catalysts, which impact the PDH activity and coke formation resistance. The presence of hydroxyl groups reduces PDH activity but enhances stability by preventing coke formation.

3. Hydroxyl groups on the surface of VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are produced through H2 pre-reduction, affecting the catalytic performance for PDH. The concentration of VOH species on the catalyst is crucial for PDH activity and coke resistance.

4. The catalyst covered by hydroxyl groups, containing mainly V4+ species, shows lower PDH activity but better resistance to coke formation compared to catalysts without hydroxyl groups.

5. In situ DRIFTS experiments were conducted to characterize the evolution of surface species on the 6V catalyst under H2 reduction. These experiments helped quantify the concentration of hydroxyl groups on the VOx species.

6. The intensity of the VOH band was normalized to measure the concentration of hydroxyl groups on the VOx species, providing insight into the catalyst's performance.

7. The scheme of VOH evolution suggests that the catalyst is initially reduced by H2, forming an adsorbed H2O, which supports the consumption of V=O structure, indicated by the appearance of a broad band attributed to H2O and a negative band led by V=O consumption.

8. The DRIFTS profiles of the 6V samples after a 30-minute reaction at 600°C revealed that the intensity of the IR band at 1590 cm-1, attributed to coke deposits, correlated with the amount of coke deposited on the samples.

9. Bader charge analysis confirmed the V oxidation state trend, supporting the valence-state distribution of vanadium as determined by XPS. 

10. The highest dehydrogenation barrier was observed over V2O5H2, consistent with the lowest initial activity of the catalysts with a surface VOH group.

11. V2O5 (structure I) can lose a top-site oxygen easily by forming acetone, facilitating the formation of V2O3 (structure III) and subsequent coke formation when directly treated by propane.

12. The existence of hydroxyl groups blocks the exposed V ions, enhancing C3H6 desorption and preventing coke formation, thus improving catalyst stability.
