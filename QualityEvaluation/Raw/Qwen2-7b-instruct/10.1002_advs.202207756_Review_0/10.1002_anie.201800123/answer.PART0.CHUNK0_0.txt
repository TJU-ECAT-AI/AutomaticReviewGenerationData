[1] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."
[2] "Commercial production of propylene is mainly based on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."
[3] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

[5] "Many density-functional theory (DFT) studies have focused on the surface structure of supported VOx catalysts under oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and found that the surface oxygen atom was the active site for the ODH reaction."

[7] "It is shown that hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst (VOH) are produced under H2 pre-reduction, and the catalytic performance for PDH is closely connected to the concentration of VOH species on the catalyst."

[11] "The initial activity (Figure2a) and relative deactivation rate (Figure2b) are found to be linearly related to the intensity of VOH band which represents the concentration of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species."
[12] "As shown in Figure4b and TableS8, the highest dehydrogenation barrier, 1.98eV, was observed over V2O5H2, which is consistent with the lowest initial activity observed experimentally with the existence of a surface VOH group."
[13] "In contrast, the formation of acetone is much harder over structure II, thus leading to favorable production of propylene."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the low price of propane making PDH more commercially attractive. Traditional propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), have limitations. Supported vanadium catalysts have emerged as an alternative due to their high activity, appropriate propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. Research on PDH catalysts, especially the surface structure of vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts, has evolved significantly. Initially, DFT studies focused on the active site for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, identifying the surface oxygen atom as the key active site. However, the active sites and surface structure for nonoxidative PDH remained unclear. Recent studies have shown that hydroxyl groups on the surface of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts improve stability and reduce coke formation. These hydroxyl groups are produced during hydrogen pre-reduction and are crucial for the catalytic performance of PDH reactions. The concentration of these hydroxyl groups affects both the initial activity and stability of the catalyst. DFT calculations support these findings, illustrating how the presence of hydroxyl groups influences the catalytic activity and stability of PDH reactions. The research highlights the importance of surface chemistry in PDH catalysts, particularly the role of hydroxyl groups in enhancing catalyst stability and reducing coke formation.

随着丙烯需求的增长，对新的生产方法的需求，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），产生了影响。由于丙烷价格低廉，PDH在目的丙烯生产中更具商业吸引力。传统的丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂化（FCC），存在局限性。支持型钒催化剂因其高活性、适当的丙烯选择性和出色的再生性能而成为替代品。PDH催化剂的研究，特别是钒氧化物（VOx）催化剂的表面结构，已经取得了显著进展。起初，密度泛函理论（DFT）研究集中在氧化脱氢反应的活性位点上，确定了表面氧原子是关键活性位点。然而，非氧化性PDH的活性位点和表面结构仍然未知。最近的研究表明，在铝酸盐支持的VOx催化剂的表面上，羟基团可以改善稳定性并减少焦炭形成。这些羟基团是在氢预处理过程中产生的，并且对于PDH反应的催化性能至关重要。羟基团的浓度影响催化剂的初始活性和稳定性。DFT计算支持这些发现，说明了羟基团如何影响PDH反应的催化活性和稳定性。研究强调了表面化学在PDH催化剂中的重要性，特别是在通过提高稳定性并减少焦炭形成来增强羟基团的作用。
