[1] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."
[2] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

[6] "The hydroxyl groups have been proved to have a fundamental effect on the catalytic performance of the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for PDH reaction."
[7] "The VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is firstly reduced by H2, and the V=O structure on the outer most surface is combined with the adsorbed H2 molecules to form an adsorbed H2O."
[8] "The higher V loading sample (12V) and lower V loading samples (4V and 1V) were also tested with the same method as the 6V sample, and similar results (see SectionS1.4) were obtained, thus indicating that the results were not a coincidence."
[9] "Our previous study has shown that the V3+ site is more active for PDH reaction than others on supported VOx catalysts,5a which might, to some extent, explain why the catalyst without H2 reduction shows higher initial activity in the present study."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the low price of propane. Supported vanadium catalysts are considered an alternative due to their high activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. Studies on the surface structure of supported VOx catalysts under oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have shown that the surface oxygen atom is the active site for the ODH reaction. A VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was synthesized with a vanadium loading of 6 wt%, which is less than the theoretical monolayer V loading on γ-Al2O3. The catalytic performance, including initial activity and stability, is closely related to the concentration of VOH species on the catalyst, which is controlled by the hydrogen pretreatment time. Hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface improve stability by suppressing coke formation. The catalyst undergoes hydrogen reduction, converting the V=O structure to adsorbed water. Higher and lower vanadium loading samples showed similar results, indicating consistency in the findings. The vanadium 3+ site is more active for PDH reactions on supported VOx catalysts, potentially explaining the higher initial activity of the catalyst without hydrogen reduction.

随着石蜡气产量的增长，丙烷价格低廉使得丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程在直接生产丙烯方面更具商业吸引力。支持型钒催化剂因其高活性、适当的丙烯选择性和出色的再生性能而被考虑为替代品。关于支持型VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢（ODH）下的表面结构的研究表明，表面氧原子是ODH反应的活性位点。通过浸渍湿法制备了γ-Al2O3上的VOx催化剂，钒负载量为6 wt%，低于γ-Al2O3上理论单层钒负载量。催化剂的催化性能，包括初始活性和稳定性，与催化剂表面的VOH物种浓度密切相关，该浓度由氢预处理时间控制。催化剂表面的羟基团通过提高稳定性来抑制焦炭形成，这主要是通过抑制焦炭沉积来实现的。催化剂通过氢还原进行处理，将V=O结构转化为吸附水。较高和较低的钒负载样品显示出相似的结果，表明研究结果的一致性。已知支持型VOx催化剂上的钒3+位点对PDH反应更为活跃，可能部分解释了未经氢处理的催化剂具有更高初始活性的原因。
