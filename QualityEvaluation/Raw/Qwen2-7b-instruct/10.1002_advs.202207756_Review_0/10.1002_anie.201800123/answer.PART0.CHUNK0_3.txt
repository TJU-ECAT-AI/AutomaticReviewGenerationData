[3] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

[6] "The hydroxyl groups are found to improve the catalyst that leads to better stability by suppressing the coke deposition."
[7] "It is shown that hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst (VOH) are produced under H2 pre-reduction, and the catalytic performance for PDH is closely connected to the concentration of VOH species on the catalyst."
[8] "The catalyst covered by hydroxyl groups, which mainly contains V4+ species throughout the reaction, exhibits a relatively low PDH activity but good resistance to coke formation."

[10] "The effects of H2 pretreatment were further characterized by in situ DRIFTS experiments."
[11] "The VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is firstly reduced by H2, and the V=O structure on the outer most surface is combined with the adsorbed H2 molecules to form an adsorbed H2O."

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the increasing availability and low cost of propane. PDH becomes more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production.
2. Industrial PDH catalysts often use supported vanadium due to its high activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance, which contrasts with the limitations of Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts in terms of cost and toxicity.
3. The surface structure and role of hydroxyl groups on VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts have been studied through in situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculations, showing their impact on PDH catalytic performance and stability.
4. Hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface enhance stability by suppressing coke formation, despite slightly reducing PDH activity. These groups influence the valence state of exposed V atoms, affecting catalytic performance.
5. DFT simulations of different reduced VOx structures correlate well with experimental results, providing insights into the PDH process and catalytic mechanisms.
6. The VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst undergoes H2 reduction, leading to the formation of hydroxyl groups and altering the surface structure to improve stability and PDH activity.
7. The relative intensity of the hydroxyl group band quantifies the concentration of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, linking it to the PDH catalytic performance.
8. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface blocks exposed V ions, enhancing C3H6 desorption and preventing coke formation, which contributes to higher stability.
