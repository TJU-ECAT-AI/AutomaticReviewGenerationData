[1] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."
[2] "Commercial production of propylene is mainly based on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."
[3] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."
[4] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."
[5] "Many density-functional theory (DFT) studies have focused on the surface structure of supported VOx catalysts under oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and found that the surface oxygen atom was the active site for the ODH reaction."
[6] "For the nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation, the active sites and surface structure of the VOx species under reductive reaction conditions still remain elusive."
[7] "It is shown that hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst (VOH) are produced under H2 pre-reduction, and the catalytic performance for PDH is closely connected to the concentration of VOH species on the catalyst."
[8] "The hydroxyl groups have been proved to have a fundamental effect on the catalytic performance of the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for PDH reaction."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the low price of propane making PDH more commercially attractive. Traditional propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), have limitations. Supported vanadium catalysts have emerged as an alternative due to their high activity, appropriate propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. Research on PDH catalysts, especially the surface structure of vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts, has evolved significantly. Initially, DFT studies focused on the active site for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, identifying the surface oxygen atom as the key active site. However, the active sites and surface structure for nonoxidative PDH remained unclear. Recent studies have shown that hydroxyl groups on the surface of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts improve stability and reduce coke formation. These hydroxyl groups are produced during hydrogen pre-reduction and are crucial for the catalytic performance of PDH reactions. The concentration of these hydroxyl groups affects both the initial activity and stability of the catalyst. DFT calculations support these findings, illustrating how the presence of hydroxyl groups influences the catalytic activity and stability of PDH reactions. The research highlights the importance of surface chemistry in PDH catalysts, particularly the role of hydroxyl groups in enhancing catalyst stability and reducing coke formation.

随着丙烯需求的增长，对新的生产方法的需求，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），产生了影响。由于丙烷价格低廉，PDH在目的丙烯生产中更具商业吸引力。传统的丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂化（FCC），存在局限性。支持型钒催化剂因其高活性、适当的丙烯选择性和出色的再生性能而成为替代品。PDH催化剂的研究，特别是钒氧化物（VOx）催化剂的表面结构，已经取得了显著进展。起初，密度泛函理论（DFT）研究集中在氧化脱氢反应的活性位点上，确定了表面氧原子是关键活性位点。然而，非氧化性PDH的活性位点和表面结构仍然未知。最近的研究表明，在铝酸盐支持的VOx催化剂的表面上，羟基团可以改善稳定性并减少焦炭形成。这些羟基团是在氢预处理过程中产生的，并且对于PDH反应的催化性能至关重要。羟基团的浓度影响催化剂的初始活性和稳定性。DFT计算支持这些发现，说明了羟基团如何影响PDH反应的催化活性和稳定性。研究强调了表面化学在PDH催化剂中的重要性，特别是在通过提高稳定性并减少焦炭形成来增强羟基团的作用。

[4] "The catalyst covered by hydroxyl groups, which mainly contains V4+ species throughout the reaction, exhibits a relatively low PDH activity but good resistance to coke formation."
[5] "The effects of H2 pretreatment were further characterized by in situ DRIFTS experiments. The 6V sample was in situ reduced under a H2 atmosphere in the sample cell of a DRIFTS instrument, and the evolution of the surface species were monitored by the IR spectra."
[6] "The intensity of the VOH band is normalized by relative intensity (defined in the experimental section in the Supporting Information) to quantitatively describe the concentration of the hydroxyl groups on the VOx species."
[7] "A scheme of the VOH evolution is proposed. The VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is firstly reduced by H2, and the V=O structure on the outer most surface is combined with the adsorbed H2 molecules to form an adsorbed H2O, which is supported by the generation of a broad band attributed to H2O and a negative band led by V=O consumption."
[8] "As shown in Figure3A presents the DRIFTS profiles of a series of 6V samples after a 30minute reaction at 600C, among which the samples are pretreated with H2 for different periods of time (3120min)."
[9] "Our previous research showed that IR bands between 1620 and 1555cm1 resulted from coke deposits on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, and the location of the peak herein falls well within the range.5a Therefore, the IR band at 1590cm1 is attributed to coke deposits on the 6V samples and its intensity represents the amount of the coke deposit."

[12] "In terms of the V2O5 (structure I), although it cannot bind C3H6 strongly, its dehydrogenation barrier is low compared with that of V2O5H2 (structure II). Therefore, V2O5 (structure I) can lose a top-site oxygen easily by forming acetone7f (see SectionS2.2.2 and FigureS31)."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the low price of propane. Supported vanadium catalysts are considered an alternative due to their high activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. Studies on the surface structure of supported VOx catalysts under oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have shown that the surface oxygen atom is the active site for the ODH reaction. A VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was synthesized with a vanadium loading of 6 wt%, which is less than the theoretical monolayer V loading on γ-Al2O3. The catalytic performance, including initial activity and stability, is closely related to the concentration of VOH species on the catalyst, which is controlled by the hydrogen pretreatment time. Hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface improve stability by suppressing coke formation. The catalyst undergoes hydrogen reduction, converting the V=O structure to adsorbed water. Higher and lower vanadium loading samples showed similar results, indicating consistency in the findings. The vanadium 3+ site is more active for PDH reactions on supported VOx catalysts, potentially explaining the higher initial activity of the catalyst without hydrogen reduction.

随着石蜡气产量的增长，丙烷价格低廉使得丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程在直接生产丙烯方面更具商业吸引力。支持型钒催化剂因其高活性、适当的丙烯选择性和出色的再生性能而被考虑为替代品。关于支持型VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢（ODH）下的表面结构的研究表明，表面氧原子是ODH反应的活性位点。通过浸渍湿法制备了γ-Al2O3上的VOx催化剂，钒负载量为6 wt%，低于γ-Al2O3上理论单层钒负载量。催化剂的催化性能，包括初始活性和稳定性，与催化剂表面的VOH物种浓度密切相关，该浓度由氢预处理时间控制。催化剂表面的羟基团通过提高稳定性来抑制焦炭形成，这主要是通过抑制焦炭沉积来实现的。催化剂通过氢还原进行处理，将V=O结构转化为吸附水。较高和较低的钒负载样品显示出相似的结果，表明研究结果的一致性。已知支持型VOx催化剂上的钒3+位点对PDH反应更为活跃，可能部分解释了未经氢处理的催化剂具有更高初始活性的原因。
