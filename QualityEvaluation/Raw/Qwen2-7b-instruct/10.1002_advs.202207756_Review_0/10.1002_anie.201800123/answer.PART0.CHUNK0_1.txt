The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by making PDH processes more commercially attractive due to the low price of propane. Propylene is crucial for various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and phenol. Traditionally, propylene production relies on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts. Supported vanadium catalysts offer an alternative due to their significant activity, appropriate propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. In the context of PDH, hydroxyl groups on the supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts are closely linked to the intrinsic activity for PDH reactions and the rate of coke formation, as demonstrated through both experimental and computational studies.

由于丙烷价格低廉，对丙烯日益增长的需求已经推动了新生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程，使其在目的性丙烯生产中更具商业吸引力。丙烯是制造聚丙烯、丙烯氧化物、丙烯腈和苯酚等产品的关键原料。传统的丙烯生产主要依赖于石脑油、轻柴油和其他石油副产品通过蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂化（FCC）进行。而支持型钒催化剂因其显著的活性、适当的丙烯选择性和出色的再生性能，作为替代品具有潜力。在PDH反应中，支持型钒氧化物（VOx）催化剂上的羟基团与PDH反应的内在活性和焦炭沉积速率紧密相关，这是通过结合实验和计算研究得出的结论。
