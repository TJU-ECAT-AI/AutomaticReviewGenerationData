[1] "It has been demonstrated that subnanometric Pt clusters show higher reactivity than Pt nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "However, when Pt clusters are supported on solid carriers with open structures, these Pt clusters may suffer fast deactivation, and the subsequent regenerationreaction cycles will lead to severe sintering of Pt."
[3] "Zeolites can serve as an ideal support to stabilize subnanometric metal catalysts, but it is challenging to localize subnanometric metal species on specific sites and modulate their reactivity."
[4] "We have achieved a very high preference for localization of highly stable subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite, as revealed by atomically resolved electron microscopy combining high-angle annular dark-field and integrated differential phase contrast imaging techniques."
[5] "These catalysts show very high stability, selectivity and activity for the industrially important dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene."
[6] "This stabilization strategy could be extended to other crystalline porous materials."
[7] "As shown in Supplementary Fig. 12, the number of OH groups in the K-free Pt-zeolite samples measured by infrared spectroscopy decreased significantly after the introduction of K+."
[8] "Furthermore, the OK+ species can interact with the positively charged Pt species by forming stabilized OPt species during the high-temperature calcination in air."
[9] "Considering the structure of MFI zeolite, one can expect that sub- nanometric encapsulated Pt clusters may distribute in different locations (including the straight channels, intersectional voids and sinusoidal channels)."
[10] "Therefore, we have analysed the HR HAADF-STEM results in further detail."
[11] "The location of Pt clusters has also been confirmed by STEM-iDPC imaging on a zeolite crystallite with the tilted-[010] orientation."
[12] "According to the XANES results (Fig. 2a), Pt species also exist in the metallic state in the PtSn@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI samples."
[13] "As shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1, the K-free PtSn@MFI has a first-shell NPtPt of about 10.7, corresponding to Pt nanoparticles of 45nm, while a first-shell NPtPt of about 6.4 is found for the K-PtSn@MFI sample, corresponding to an average size of about 0.9nm."
[14] "Following the same approach, we have studied the location of subnanometric Pt and Sn species in the K-PtSn@MFI sample by paired HR HAADF-STEM (Supplementary Fig. 28 images in greyscale) and iDPC imaging."
[15] "As can be seen in Fig. 3ip, subnano- metric Pt and Sn species are also located in the 10MR sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite (see additional images in Supplementary Figs. 2933)."
[16] "The interaction between Pt and Sn in the K-PtSn@MFI sample has been investigated by CO infrared spectroscopy."
[17] "As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 36, the CO adsorption bands at 1,887 and 1,719cm1 can only be observed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample,indicating that the introduction of Sn can modulate the electronic structure of Pt clusters."
[18] "As shown in Fig. 4af, K, Sn and Pt are homogeneously distributed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample according to the X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) mapping."
[19] "However, due to the res- olution limitation, it is not possible to determine the relative spatial relationship between Sn and Pt."
[20] "To overcome the limitation of XEDS on such beam-sensitive samples, we have attempted, on the basis of the imaging simulation results (Supplementary Figs. 4244), to dis- criminate Pt and Sn distributions by a k-means clustering analysis of the HR HAADF-STEM images (see Supplementary Information for details)."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), aiming to enhance efficiency and selectivity. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, the debate surrounded the active Ga species, with some arguing that Ga forms a ternary compound with hydrogen and silicon, enhancing the catalyst's activity. However, recent research has shed light on the role of Ga in the form of GaOx, contributing to the high reactivity of the catalyst. This has been substantiated by studies that have focused on the location of metal species within the zeolite structure, demonstrating that subnanometric metal clusters, including Pt and PtSn, can be selectively localized in the sinusoidal channels of MFI zeolite, improving stability and selectivity for the PDH process. The stabilization of these subnanometric clusters, facilitated by the presence of potassium ions, has been shown to extend the catalyst's lifetime and maintain high reactivity even after multiple regeneration cycles. This discovery not only advances the PDH process but also opens possibilities for extending similar stabilization strategies to other crystalline porous materials, potentially revolutionizing the field of heterogeneous catalysis. The use of advanced electron microscopy techniques, such as HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC, enables researchers to precisely identify and analyze the location of metal species within complex materials, providing insights into the mechanisms that govern their reactivity and stability. This detailed understanding can guide the design of more efficient and durable catalysts for various industrial applications, including the production of propylene from propane.

对丙烯日益增长的需求推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），旨在提高效率和选择性。GA/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经显著进化。起初，关于活性GA物种的争论围绕着GA与氢和硅形成三元化合物的观点，这被认为提高了催化剂的活性。然而，最近的研究揭示了GA以GAox的形式起作用，这证实了催化剂高活性的原因。通过聚焦于金属物种在沸石结构内的位置，研究证明了亚纳米尺寸的金属簇，包括Pt和PtSn，可以在MFI沸石的流形通道内选择性地定位，从而改善了PDH过程的稳定性和选择性。通过钾离子的存在来稳定这些亚纳米簇已被证明可以延长催化剂的寿命，并在经过多次再生循环后保持高活性。这一发现不仅推进了PDH过程，而且为将类似稳定化策略扩展到其他晶态多孔材料提供了可能性，这可能彻底改变催化领域。先进的电子显微镜技术，如HR HAADF-STEM和iDPC的使用，使研究人员能够精确识别和分析复杂材料内的金属物种的位置，提供有关它们活性和稳定性的机制的见解。这种详细的理解可以指导设计更高效、耐用的催化剂用于各种工业应用，包括从丙烷生产丙烯。

[1] "It has been demonstrated that subnanometric Pt clusters show higher reactivity than Pt nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation reaction18."
[2] "Attempts have been reported to preferentially locate framework Al atoms in the intersectional sites or within the 10MR channels of ZSM-5 (MFI-type zeolite)57."
[3] "However, when functional metals,such as Pt or Pd, have been introduced by including the metal pre- cursor during the synthesis or through interzeolite transformations,nanoparticles of 12nm instead of subnanometric metal species (single atoms or clusters) have been obtained within the MFI zeo- lite811."
[4] "From the materials and catalysis point of view, the following challenges remain unsolved: (1) to gen- erate stable subnanometric metal species within the zeolite crystal- lites, (2) to stabilize them regioselectively within the 10MR channels and (3) to achieve the above goals with purely siliceous MFI zeolite and to avoid the presence of acid sites in the final material."
[5] "The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+OH) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position."
[6] "Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species."
[7] "All the Pt-zeolite materials with different chemical compositions show typical X-ray diffraction patterns of MFI zeolite (Supplementary Fig. 1)."
[8] "The results from STEM-iDPC imaging and X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicate that the role of K is related to the stabilization of Pt atoms during the calcination process, avoiding their sintering into Pt nanoparticles19,20."
[9] "Considering the structure of MFI zeolite, one can expect that sub- nanometric encapsulated Pt clusters may distribute in different locations (including the straight channels, intersectional voids and sinusoidal channels)."
[10] "The interaction between Pt and Sn in the K-PtSn@MFI sample has been investigated by CO infrared spectroscopy."
[11] "The high catalytic performance of K-PtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregen- eration cycles without obvious deactivation (see Supplementary Figs. 55 and 56)."
[12] "For comparison, a reference K-PtSn/MFI sample with the same chemical composition as the K-PtSn@MFI sample was also prepared by conventional incipient wetness impregnation (Supplementary Fig. 66), containing well dispersed Pt particles of 0.41.2nm."
[13] "As displayed in Supplementary Figs. 49 and 50, the PtSn@MFI catalyst only showed about one-third of its initial reactivity in the third cycle, which is caused by the sintering of Pt (Supplementary Fig. 51)."
[14] "According to the above results, by the combination of K and Sn, the reactivity and stability of Pt should be enhanced."
[15] "The size and spatial location of the subnano- metric Pt clusters are preserved after reaction, which is con- firmed by EXAFS and electron microscopy characterizations (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Figs. 5761)."
