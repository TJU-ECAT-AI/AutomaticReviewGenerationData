[1] "It has been demonstrated that subnanometric Pt clusters show higher reactivity than Pt nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation reaction18."
[2] "Attempts have been reported to preferentially locate framework Al atoms in the intersectional sites or within the 10MR channels of ZSM-5 (MFI-type zeolite)57."
[3] "However, when functional metals,such as Pt or Pd, have been introduced by including the metal pre- cursor during the synthesis or through interzeolite transformations,nanoparticles of 12nm instead of subnanometric metal species (single atoms or clusters) have been obtained within the MFI zeo- lite811."
[4] "From the materials and catalysis point of view, the following challenges remain unsolved: (1) to gen- erate stable subnanometric metal species within the zeolite crystal- lites, (2) to stabilize them regioselectively within the 10MR channels and (3) to achieve the above goals with purely siliceous MFI zeolite and to avoid the presence of acid sites in the final material."
[5] "The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+OH) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position."
[6] "Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species."
[7] "All the Pt-zeolite materials with different chemical compositions show typical X-ray diffraction patterns of MFI zeolite (Supplementary Fig. 1)."
[8] "The results from STEM-iDPC imaging and X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicate that the role of K is related to the stabilization of Pt atoms during the calcination process, avoiding their sintering into Pt nanoparticles19,20."
[9] "Considering the structure of MFI zeolite, one can expect that sub- nanometric encapsulated Pt clusters may distribute in different locations (including the straight channels, intersectional voids and sinusoidal channels)."
[10] "The interaction between Pt and Sn in the K-PtSn@MFI sample has been investigated by CO infrared spectroscopy."
[11] "The high catalytic performance of K-PtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregen- eration cycles without obvious deactivation (see Supplementary Figs. 55 and 56)."
[12] "For comparison, a reference K-PtSn/MFI sample with the same chemical composition as the K-PtSn@MFI sample was also prepared by conventional incipient wetness impregnation (Supplementary Fig. 66), containing well dispersed Pt particles of 0.41.2nm."
[13] "As displayed in Supplementary Figs. 49 and 50, the PtSn@MFI catalyst only showed about one-third of its initial reactivity in the third cycle, which is caused by the sintering of Pt (Supplementary Fig. 51)."
[14] "According to the above results, by the combination of K and Sn, the reactivity and stability of Pt should be enhanced."
[15] "The size and spatial location of the subnano- metric Pt clusters are preserved after reaction, which is con- firmed by EXAFS and electron microscopy characterizations (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Figs. 5761)."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Recent research has focused on understanding the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, including debates about active Ga species. New findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts.
2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Researchers have explored the regioselective localization of extraframework metal species, particularly Pt, in zeolite structures. Techniques such as HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC have been used to study the precise location of metal species in catalysts at the atomic level.
3. The concept of regioselective localization of extraframework metal species has broadened beyond zeolites to include other crystalline porous materials like metalorganic frameworks. This approach has been instrumental in enhancing the stability and selectivity of catalysts, particularly for PDH reactions.
