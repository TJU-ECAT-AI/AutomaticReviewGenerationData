1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, particularly concerning the debate around active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts.

2. Zeolites have been identified as ideal supports for stabilizing subnanometric metal catalysts. However, the challenge lies in localizing these species precisely and adjusting their reactivity. The research demonstrates a significant achievement in localizing highly stable subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters within the sinusoidal channels of MFI zeolite.

3. The localized clusters exhibit remarkable stability, selectivity, and activity in the industrial process of converting propane into propylene. 

4. The reduction of the K-Pt@MFI sample in hydrogen gas at 600°C resulted in the formation of subnanometric Pt clusters, highlighting the role of potassium in stabilizing Pt atoms during the calcination process.

5. Incorporating Sn as a promoter significantly enhances the activity and selectivity of the PtSn@MFI catalyst, indicating its potential for improving PDH efficiency.

6. The reactivity of the deactivated K-Pt@MFI catalyst can be fully restored through multiple cycles of calcination-reduction treatments, showcasing the stability of the subnanometric Pt clusters.

7. The research findings clearly establish that subnanometric PtSn clusters confined in the 10MR channels of MFI zeolite are highly stable and selective catalysts for PDH, offering a promising solution for propylene production.
