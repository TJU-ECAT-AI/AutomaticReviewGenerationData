1. The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as propylene is a key feedstock for polymer production. With a total consumption of 83 million tons in 2013 and forecasted growth at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.8% from 2013 to 2018, there is a continuous search for improved PDH catalysts. Recent attention has been given to catalysts involving group IIIA metal oxides, specifically Ga2O3, which has shown promise despite the uncertainty around the nature of its active site due to structural complexity and polymorph co-existence.

2. The development of new PDH catalysts is driven by the increasing demand for propylene, a crucial feedstock for polymer production. With a significant consumption of 83 million tons in 2013 and a forecasted growth rate of 4.8% per year from 2013 to 2018, there is a constant pursuit of catalyst improvements. Among these, group IIIA metal oxides, notably Ga2O3, have garnered attention due to their potential in PDH processes, despite uncertainties surrounding the active site's nature, which is attributed to the material's structural complexity and polymorph co-existence.

3. The research on PDH catalysts, particularly focusing on group IIIA metal oxides like Ga2O3, aims to address the challenges posed by the unclear nature of the active site in Ga2O3, primarily due to its structural complexity and the co-existence of multiple polymorphs within mixed oxide materials. This uncertainty has led to the hypothesis that binary In2O3Ga2O3 mixed oxide catalysts might exhibit distinct PDH properties compared to the individual components.

4. The mixed InGa oxide catalysts demonstrated significantly higher activity in propane conversion than previously reported mixed In2O3Al2O3 catalysts, and they surpassed -Ga2O3 catalysts in terms of both catalyst mass and surface area basis, highlighting their potential in PDH processes.

1. 对丙烯的日益增长的需求推动了新生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），因为丙烯是聚合物生产的关键原料。到2013年，丙烯的总消费量为8.3亿吨，并预计从2013年到2018年的复合年增长率将达到4.8%。因此，对改进PDH催化剂的持续需求。最近，人们将注意力集中在涉及第IIIA族金属氧化物的催化剂上，特别是Ga2O3，尽管对其活性位点的性质存在不确定性，这主要是由于材料的结构复杂性和混氧化合物中Ga2O3的多种晶型共存所导致。

3. PDH催化剂的研发，特别是针对第IIIA族金属氧化物如Ga2O3的研究，旨在解决Ga2O3活性位点性质不清的问题，这是由其结构复杂性和混氧化合物材料中存在的多种晶型所导致的。这种不确定性促使假设二元In2O3Ga2O3混合氧化物催化剂可能与单个成分相比，在PDH过程中表现出不同的特性。

4. 混合的InGa氧化物催化剂在丙烷转化方面的活性明显高于先前报道的混合In2O3Al2O3催化剂，并且它们在催化剂质量基础和表面积基础上超越了-Ga2O3催化剂，突显了它们在PDH过程中的潜力。
