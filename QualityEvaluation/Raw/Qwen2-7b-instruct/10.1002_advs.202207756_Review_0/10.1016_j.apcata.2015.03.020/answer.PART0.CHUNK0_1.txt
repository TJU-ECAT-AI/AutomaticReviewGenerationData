1. The growing demand for propylene has driven interest in new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the availability of new feedstocks from hydraulic fracturing operations. This process converts propane into propylene, a key ingredient in polymer production.

2. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is especially significant in the family of dehydrogenation reactions because propylene serves as a critical feedstock for polymer production. Propylene's demand was estimated to be around 83 million tons in 2013, with forecasts predicting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4.8% during 2013-2018.

3. There is currently no research available that explores the use of binary In2O3Ga2O3 mixed oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

4. It was hypothesized that the mixed InGa oxide catalysts could demonstrate distinct PDH properties compared to their individual oxide components due to each component showing some activity.

5. The mixed InGa oxides demonstrated significantly higher activity in terms of propane conversion than previously reported mixed In2O3Al2O3 catalysts and -Ga2O3 catalysts, both on a mass and surface area basis.

6. The study focused on evaluating the catalytic performance of novel In2O3Ga2O3 mixed oxides synthesized through the alcoholic-coprecipitation method for propane dehydrogenation.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，人们对新的生产方法产生了兴趣，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），因为这种过程可以利用来自水力压裂操作的大量新原料。这个过程将丙烷转化为关键的聚合物生产原料——丙烯。

2. 在这一系列反应中，丙烷脱氢（PDH）特别重要，因为丙烯是聚合物生产的关键原料。预计2013年丙烯消费量约为8300万吨，未来几年的复合年增长率（CAGR）预计为4.8%。

3. 目前没有研究报告涉及到二元In2O3Ga2O3混合氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的应用。

4. 假设混合的InGa氧化物催化剂与各自氧化物成分相比，可能显示出不同的PDH特性，因为每个成分都表现出一定的活性。

5. 混合的InGa氧化物在丙烷转化率方面比先前报道的混合In2O3Al2O3催化剂和-Ga2O3催化剂显示了显著更高的活性，无论是在质量基础还是表面积基础上。

6. 研究关注的是通过醇酸沉淀法合成新型In2O3Ga2O3混合氧化物的催化性能评估，用于丙烷脱氢。
