[1] "Dehydrogenation is of renewed interest due to the large availability of new feed- stocks derived from hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operations [1]."
[2] "Among this family of reactions,propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is of particular interest,since propylene is a crucial feedstock for polymer production [2]."
[3] "Recently,PDH catalysts involving group IIIA metal oxides have attracted attention."
[4] "However,to the best of our knowledge,there are no reports investigating binary In2O3Ga2O3 mixed oxide catalysts for Pdh."
[5] "Since each single oxide component exhibited some activity,we hypothesized that the mixed InGa oxide catalysts could show interesting Pdh properties different from the two individual oxide catalysts."
[6] "The resulting mixed-metal oxides exhibit a considerably higher activity in terms of propane conversion than previously reported mixed In2O3Al2O3,as well as compared to -Ga2O3,on both a catalyst mass basis and surface area basis."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to renewed interest in dehydrogenation processes, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the increased availability of feedstocks from hydraulic fracturing operations. Propylene is a vital feedstock for polymer production, making PDH a key process in the industry.
2. Among the family of dehydrogenation reactions, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) stands out as a critical process, mainly because propylene is a crucial raw material for polymer production. This highlights the importance of PDH in the chemical industry.
3. Researchers have recently shown interest in PDH catalysts that incorporate group IIIA metal oxides, such as In2O3 and Ga2O3.
4. To date, there are no known studies that have explored the use of binary In2O3Ga2O3 mixed oxide catalysts for PDH.
5. Given that each of the single oxide components shows some activity, the hypothesis is that the mixed InGa oxide catalysts might display distinct PDH properties compared to their individual oxide counterparts.
6. The newly developed mixed-metal oxides demonstrate significantly higher activity in terms of propane conversion than previously reported mixed In2O3Al2O3 catalysts and pure Ga2O3 catalysts, both in terms of catalyst mass and surface area.
