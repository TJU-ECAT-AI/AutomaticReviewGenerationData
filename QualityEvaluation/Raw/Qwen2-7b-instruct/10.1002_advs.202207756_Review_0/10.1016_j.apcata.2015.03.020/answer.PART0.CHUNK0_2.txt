The growing demand for propylene has spurred the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, with researchers now recognizing the structural complexity and polymorph coexistence in Ga2O3 materials. The debate about active Ga species continues, and recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts. This study specifically highlights the lack of investigation into binary In2O3Ga2O3 mixed oxide catalysts for PDH. The team hypothesized that these mixed oxides might exhibit distinct PDH properties compared to their individual components. The findings revealed that these mixed-metal oxides showed significantly higher activity in propane conversion than previously reported mixed In2O3Al2O3 catalysts, as well as -Ga2O3, both on a catalyst mass basis and surface area basis. The underlying reasons for this behavior are discussed in the paper.

需求的增长推动了丙烯生产方法的创新，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的研究有了显著进展，人们现在认识到Ga2O3材料的结构复杂性和共存的多种形态对理解催化活性的影响。关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续，近期的研究成果为这些催化剂的性能提供了新的见解。本研究特别关注了二元In2O3Ga2O3混合氧化物催化剂在PDH中的应用，发现这类混合金属氧化物在丙烷转化率方面比之前报道的混合In2O3Al2O3催化剂和-Ga2O3催化剂都表现出更高的活性，无论是在催化剂质量基础还是表面积基础上。论文讨论了这一行为背后的原因。
