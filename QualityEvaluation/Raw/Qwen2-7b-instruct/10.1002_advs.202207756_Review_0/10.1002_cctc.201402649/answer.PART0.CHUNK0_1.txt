The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The shift from naphtha crackers to ethane crackers in the USA has led to a shortage of propylene and consequently increased prices. In response to these market conditions, the production of propylene through the dehydrogenation of propane has become more attractive, leading to the announcement of numerous new installations. Operando Raman spectroscopy has been utilized to study the formation of coke deposits on catalyst materials, providing insights into the chemical nature of these deposits at reaction conditions. This quantitative approach has been further developed to apply in a pilot-scale reactor setting, enabling the examination of coke deposition rates and chemical characteristics at various heights within the catalyst bed.

随着丙烯需求的增长，新的生产方法得到了发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。美国从石脑油裂解器转向乙烷裂解器以生产乙烯，导致了丙烯短缺和价格上升。在这些市场条件下，通过丙烷脱氢生产丙烯变得更具商业吸引力，因此宣布了多个新项目。原位拉曼光谱已被用于研究催化剂材料上的焦炭沉积形成，提供了反应条件下的碳沉积化学性质的见解。这一定量方法被进一步扩展到中试规模的反应器设置，允许对催化剂床内不同高度的焦炭沉积速率和化学特性进行检查。
