<p>Two processes have been applied industrially for the dehydrogenation of propane, namely the Catofin and Oleflex processes.2 The former uses a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst in a fixed bed reactor.</p>
<p>Catalyst deactivation is a clear issue for this system and takes place first and foremost by coke deposition. Carbon deposits on the catalyst are necessary on one hand, as the heat generated during the regeneration step is used to run the endothermic reaction. On the other hand, the catalyst performance drops as active sites become covered by coke.</p>
<p>Operando Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the formation of coke deposits on catalyst materials, and has proven to be a non-invasive method to investigate the chemical nature of carbon deposits formed on catalyst materials at reaction conditions.3 In principle it is a quantitative technique, as the intensity of the scattered Raman light is directly proportional to the amount of scattering molecules. However, depending on the degree of coloration of the catalyst solid, part of the scattered Raman light will be absorbed. This means that as the catalyst material deactivates by coke deposition, the self-absorption of the Raman signal becomes more prevalent as the catalytic solid becomes increasingly black. This results in an overall decrease of the Raman intensity collected, making quantitative use of the technique difficult, if not impossible.</p>
<p>For the above equation to remain valid, the scattering coefficient has to remain constant during the experiment. Furthermore, as this formula is derived from the KubelkaMunk equation, the correlation between absorption and the concentration of light absorbing species breaks down at very high values for light absorption, which means at very low values of R.6 By using this approach, Tinnemans etal. have studied the deactivation of a CrOx-based dehydrogenation catalyst in a lab-scale reactor during the dehydrogenation of propane by simultaneously collecting operando Raman spectroscopic data and the diffuse reflectance R by UV/vis spectroscopy. In this way, the process of coke formation was studied in a quantitative manner. This approach was taken one step further by Bennici etal., who developed an expert catalytic reactor control system for a lab-scale reactor, where the dehydrogenation-regeneration cycling was completely controlled by on-line operando spectroscopic methods.7 More specifically, the regeneration process was started when a specific amount of coke was measured, and halted again when the coke was combusted.</p>
<p>Recently, we have described the use of operando UV/vis probes to study the deactivation of mm-sized CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates during the dehydrogenation of propane in a pilot-scale reactor.8 By collecting operando UV/vis spectra, differences in the rate of coke deposition and combustion were observed as a function of catalyst bed height. Here, we further this analysis by showing the design, construction and testing of an optical fiber probe for conducting operando Raman spectroscopy in a pilot-scale reactor.</p>
<p>In Figure1, a schematic display and a photograph are shown of the newly designed Raman probe. Laser light (λ=532nm) enters the Raman probe through an optical fiber and is converted into a parallel beam by a lens, after which it passes through a band-pass filter that only transmits light of λ=532nm. In this way, the Raman signal of the SiO vibrations of the fiber is filtered out. The light then travels along the length of the probe through a dichroic window to a lens fixed at the tip of the probe, which focuses the laser light on the catalyst sample. Backscattered light is collected and converted to a parallel beam by the same lens. From this direction, the dichroic filter functions as a mirror, and through another mirror the light passes through a long-pass filter assembly, which only allows Stokes shifted light through. A third lens then focusses the Raman signal on an optical fiber, which is connected to the spectrometer.</p>
<p>For the first propane dehydrogenation experiment, two cycles, which consist of 6h of propane dehydrogenation followed by 4h of regeneration were performed at 550C. During this experiment, the two operando UV/vis optical fiber probes were positioned in the upper two reactor opening slots and the operando Raman optical fiber probe was placed in the third opening slot at the bottom of the catalyst bed.</p>
<p>Operando Raman and UV/vis spectra were also collected during the subsequent regeneration step. As is shown in Figure5, the catalyst darkening, as measured by UV/vis spectroscopy, as well as the typical coke bands in the Raman spectra disappear rapidly as the coke is combusted during the regeneration step. The time where the coke is combusted depends on the height of the catalyst bed. Indeed, the spectral features corresponding with coke deposits disappear after 80min at the top, 120min in the middle and 180min at the bottom of the catalyst bed. In other words, coke combustion gradually travels as a front from the top to the bottom of the reactor bed.</p>
<p>The actual intensity of the Raman bands obtained during different experiments cannot be compared directly, as the probe will be positioned slightly differently with respect to the catalyst extrudate. This will result in differences in the quality of the spectra obtained, including the intensity of the Raman bands. However, the rate at which the intensity of the Raman bands increases can be compared.</p>
<p>The chemical nature of the coke deposits is expressed as the ratio of the intensity of the two Raman bands, the so-called D1/G ratio, and the results obtained are shown in Figure8. To accurately determine the intensity of the Raman bands, the spectra have been deconvoluted in a set of four bands, as demonstrated by previous work.10 It is clear that the value of the D1/G varies a lot in the consecutively measured operando Raman spectra. Other than this noise, however, the ratio measured at the top and bottom of the reactor bed is not clearly different. Furthermore, no clear changes as a function of reaction time are observed.</p>
<p>The design, construction, and testing of an operando Raman probe is described, which could be inserted in a pilot-scale reactor to study the process of coke deposition on CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. The probe is made as such that a flow of N2 can be used to cool the probe and keep the tip clear of coke deposits. Furthermore, the probe can be moved with respect to the catalyst bed, for focusing purposes.</p>
<p>In addition to the Raman probe, two UV/vis probes were used to study the catalyst bed during two consecutive propane dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. By performing an identical experiment while switching the position of the two types of optical fiber probes, the obtained information by the UV/vis and Raman spectroscopic probes can be combined to determine the type and amount of coke formed at different heights of the catalyst bed for the first hour of the dehydrogenation cycles. Differences in the rate of coke deposition were observed as a function of catalyst bed height, which are related to changes in the temperature of the catalyst bed. At higher reaction temperatures, the rate of coke deposition was increased, while the chemical nature of the coke deposits, as expressed by the D1/G ratio, is independent of catalyst bed height and reaction time. In addition, the combustion of the coke deposits could be visualized by the operando spectroscopic probes, and it took place as a reacting front, travelling down the length of the catalyst bed.</p>
<p>It should be clear that the developed pilot-scale reactor set-up, including the Raman and UV/vis operando spectroscopy probes, will be useful for studies on many other catalytic reactions, and, therefore, the approach has a much larger application field than the catalytic dehydrogenation system described in this work.</p>
<p>The pilot-scale reactor was filled with approximately 500g of CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates, with 14cm of inert stainless steel balls (diameter of 6mm) at the reactors extremities. The catalyst extrudates have a diameter of about 3mm and a length of 38mm. They consist of 20wt% of Cr (which is a mixture of Cr3+ and Cr6+) and 1wt% of Na on a Al2O3 support.</p>

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH processes, such as the Catofin and Oleflex, use a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst in a fixed bed reactor. Catalyst deactivation occurs primarily through coke deposition, affecting catalyst performance and requiring careful control during regeneration steps to avoid irreversible deactivation.

2. Operando Raman spectroscopy has proven effective in studying the chemical nature and formation of coke deposits on catalyst materials, providing insights into PDH processes. While it is inherently a quantitative technique, the self-absorption of the Raman signal complicates its use for precise measurements, especially at low light reflection levels.

Expert systems have been developed to control the dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles based on real-time operando spectroscopic data.

3. The use of operando UV/vis probes to study catalyst deactivation during PDH in a pilot-scale reactor has revealed differences in the rate of coke deposition across the catalyst bed, which correlates with changes in the temperature of the catalyst bed.
