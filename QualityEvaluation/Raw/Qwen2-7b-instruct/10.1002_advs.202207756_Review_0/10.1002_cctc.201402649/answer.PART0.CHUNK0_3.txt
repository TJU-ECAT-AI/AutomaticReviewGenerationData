<p>Combined operando UV/visRaman spectroscopy has been used to study the deactivation of CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst extrudates in a pilot scale propane dehydrogenation reactor.</p>
<p>In addition to the Raman probe, two UV/vis probes were used to study the catalyst bed during two consecutive propane dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.</p>
<p>Differences in the rate of coke deposition were observed as a function of catalyst bed height, which are related to changes in the temperature of the catalyst bed.</p>
<p>The chemical nature of the coke deposits formed on a catalyst extrudate, as expressed by the D1/G ratio, was independent of reaction time as well as of the position of the catalyst extrudate within the reactor bed.</p>

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH involves the use of catalysts, such as Ga/H-ZSM-5, to convert propane into propylene. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with debates around the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the chemical nature of coke deposits formed on the catalyst extrudates. These deposits, as expressed by the D1/G ratio, are independent of reaction time and position within the reactor bed.

对丙烯的日益增长的需求推动了新的生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH涉及使用催化剂，如Ga/H-ZSM-5，将丙烷转化为丙烯。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的PDH理解已经发展，围绕活性Ga物种存在争议。最近的研究为这些催化剂的当前知识做出了贡献，包括在催化剂颗粒上形成的焦炭沉积物的化学性质。这些沉积物通过D1/G比率表达，与反应时间及床内位置无关。
