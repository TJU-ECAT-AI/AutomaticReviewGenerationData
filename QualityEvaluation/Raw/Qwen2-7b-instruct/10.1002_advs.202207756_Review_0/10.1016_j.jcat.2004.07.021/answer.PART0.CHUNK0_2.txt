[1] "The most extensive in situ study of the state of gallium in the working GaZSM-5 catalyst for propane aromatization has been carried out in Refs. [24,7]."
[2] "This study provides some new insight into the chemistry of zeolite-occluded gallium, we will compare our interpretation to that proposed in other studies of Ga/ZSM-5."
[3] "Subsequent cooling in a hydrogen atmosphere to room temperature resulted in the formation of Ga3+ ions either by oxidation of the reduced species by traces of water present in the hydrogen flow or due to interaction with the zeolite framework oxygen."
[4] "However, we directly observed the formation of gallium hydrides by DRIFT measurements. Moreover, DRIFT spectra of adsorbed CO gave insight into coordinatively unsaturated gallium species."
[5] "Reduction of gallium at high temperatures leads to the formation of low-coordinated Ga+ ions and to dihydride species to some extent. The amount of the latter strongly increased after slow cooling of the gallium-modified samples to room temperature in hydrogen."

1. The demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through ongoing debates about active Ga species, which have been recently researched to contribute to our current knowledge of these catalysts.
2. The study offers new insights into the chemistry of zeolite-encapsulated gallium, comparing interpretations with those proposed in other studies of Ga/ZSM-5.
3. Cooling a reduced Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst in a hydrogen atmosphere to room temperature resulted in the formation of Ga3+ ions, either through oxidation of reduced species by hydrogen or interaction with the zeolite framework oxygen.
4. The study directly observed the formation of gallium hydrides using DRIFT measurements, providing additional information on coordinatively unsaturated gallium species.
5. Reduction of gallium at high temperatures produces low-coordinated Ga+ ions and gallium dihydrides. The amount of dihydrides significantly increases after slow cooling of the catalyst to room temperature in hydrogen.

1. 对丙烯的需求推动了新生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已经通过关于活性Ga物种的持续辩论和最近的研究得到了进展。
2. 该研究提供了有关封装在沸石中的镓化学的新见解，并将其解释与Ga/ZSM-5其他研究中提出的解释进行了比较。
3. 将还原后的Ga/ZSM-5催化剂在氢气氛围下冷却至室温，形成了Ga3+离子，这可能是由氢气对还原物种的氧化或与沸石骨架氧的相互作用引起的。
4. 研究使用DRIFT测量直接观察到了镓氢化物的形成，提供了关于配位不饱和镓物种的额外信息。
5. 高温下的镓还原产生了低配位的Ga+离子和镓氢化物。在氢气氛围下缓慢冷却催化剂至室温后，氢化物的数量显著增加。
