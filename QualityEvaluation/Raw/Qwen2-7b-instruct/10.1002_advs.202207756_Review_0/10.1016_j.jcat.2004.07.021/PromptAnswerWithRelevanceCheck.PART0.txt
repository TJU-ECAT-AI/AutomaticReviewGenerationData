[1] "The modification of HZSM-5 with gallium suppresses dealumination of the hydrogen form due to substitution of protons by gallium species."
[2] "Substitution of acidic hydroxyl groups by gallium ions in the zeolite micropores was only of a minor importance."
[3] "Reduction of GaZSM-5 in hydrogen at 773 K results in the substitution of acid protons by cationic Ga species."
[4] "Replacement of acidic protons by reaction with Ga2O is easier and more complete than by the species resulting from dealumination."
[5] "Suppression of dealumination for the gallium-modified samples is then connected with compensation of the negatively charged aluminum-centered oxygen tetrahedra by gallium oxo-ions instead of (AlO)+ species."
[6] "After evacuation at high temperature the univalent cat- ionic gallium species exhibit DRIFT bands of weakly adsorbed CO with stretching frequencies of 2130 and 2147 cm1."
[7] "Formation of gallium hydrides by adsorption of hydrogen on univalent gallium cations is reversible by evacuation at 773 K."
[8] "Oxidative treatment of univalent gallium or gallium dihydrides with N2O results in their oxidation into singly positively charged oxo-ions: Ga+ + N2O GaO+ + N2."
[9] "Carbon monoxide probe DRIFT spectroscopy further allows the identification of the various Ga species in the micropore space of ZSM-5 zeolite."
[10] "These results suggest that the earlier observed oxidation of reduced Ga/HZSM-5 can also be related to the oxidative addition of hydrogen giving tervalent gallium hydride species."

The growing demand for propylene has led to advancements in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology. The development of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has been pivotal, with researchers focusing on the active gallium species involved in the catalytic process. Recent studies have clarified the role of gallium in suppressing dealumination, which enhances the efficiency of PDH. The understanding of Ga species within the zeolite structure has evolved, particularly through the use of DRIFT spectroscopy to identify gallium hydrides and their reversible oxidation states. This has contributed to a clearer picture of the chemistry involved in PDH catalysis, supporting the hypothesis that oxidation of reduced gallium species occurs via the oxidative addition of hydrogen, leading to tervalent gallium hydride species.

对丙烯日益增长的需求推动了丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术的进步。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH领域的应用至关重要，研究人员着重于催化过程中活性镓物种的作用。最近的研究澄清了镓在抑制dealumination方面的作用，这提高了PDH的效率。对zeolite结构中镓物种的理解已经发展，特别是通过使用DRIFT光谱来识别镓化物和其可逆氧化状态，为PDH催化过程的化学反应提供了一幅更清晰的图景。这支持了这样一个假设：在减压后的镓物种的氧化过程中，氢的氧化添加导致了三价镓化物的形成。

The demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH processes often utilize Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The understanding of these catalysts has evolved significantly, particularly concerning the nature of active Ga species. Early interpretations suggested that reduced Ga3+ ions could lead to Ga+ ions or even Ga metal upon cooling in a hydrogen atmosphere. However, recent research has shown that the formation of gallium hydrides through hydrogen adsorption on univalent gallium cations is a reversible process. This discovery challenges the traditional view of Ga species in the PDH process and suggests that the oxidative addition of hydrogen gives rise to tervalent gallium hydride species, rather than the previously hypothesized oxidation of reduced species by water or interaction with the zeolite framework oxygen. This new insight contributes to a more nuanced understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH processes.

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process converts propane into propylene through thermal cracking. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was a debate about the active Ga species involved in the catalytic process. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by revealing that reduction at high temperatures leads to the formation of low-coordinated Ga+ ions and dihydride species. After slow cooling of the gallium-modified samples to room temperature in hydrogen, the amount of these dihydride species increased significantly. It is now proposed that the oxidation of univalent gallium ions does not occur via traces of water but through the oxidative addition of hydrogen, leading to the formation of tervalent gallium hydride species. These findings suggest that the observed oxidation of reduced Ga/HZSM-5 can indeed be related to the oxidative addition of hydrogen.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这一过程通过热裂解将丙烷转化为丙烯。对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已经显著发展。最初，关于催化过程中活性Ga物种的辩论。最近的研究成果已经为这些催化剂的当前知识做出了贡献，揭示了在高温下还原会形成低配位的Ga+离子和二氢化物物种。在慢速冷却到室温的氢气中，这些二氢化物物种的数量显著增加。现在提出，单价镓离子的氧化并非通过氢流中的微量水分发生，而是通过氢的氧化插入形成三价镓氢化物物种。这些发现表明，观察到的减少Ga/HZSM-5的氧化确实可以与氢的氧化插入相关联。
