[1] "The present study confirms previous findings that reduction of Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite in hydrogen results in the substitution of acid protons by cationic Ga species."
[2] "Suppression of dealumination for the gallium-modified samples is then connected with compensation of the negatively charged aluminum-centered oxygen tetrahedra by gallium oxo-ions instead of (AlO)+ species."
[3] "The modification of HZSM-5 by gallium suppressed dealumination that is thought to result in the positively charged (AlO)+ oxo-ions according to Eq. (2)."
[4] "Our results also show that replacement of acidic protons by reaction with Ga2O is easier and more complete than by the species resulting from dealumination."
[5] "After evacuation at high temperature the univalent cat- ionic gallium species exhibit DRIFT bands of weakly adsorbed CO with stretching frequencies of 2130 and 2147 cm1."
[6] "This study provides some new insight into the chem- istry of zeolite-occluded gallium, we will compare our in- terpretation to that proposed in other studies of Ga/ZSM-5."

The demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH processes often utilize Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The understanding of these catalysts has evolved significantly, particularly concerning the nature of active Ga species. Early interpretations suggested that reduced Ga3+ ions could lead to Ga+ ions or even Ga metal upon cooling in a hydrogen atmosphere. However, recent research has shown that the formation of gallium hydrides through hydrogen adsorption on univalent gallium cations is a reversible process. This discovery challenges the traditional view of Ga species in the PDH process and suggests that the oxidative addition of hydrogen gives rise to tervalent gallium hydride species, rather than the previously hypothesized oxidation of reduced species by water or interaction with the zeolite framework oxygen. This new insight contributes to a more nuanced understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH processes.

对丙烯的需求推动了新型生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH过程通常使用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。这些催化剂的理解已经显著发展，特别是关于活性Ga物种的性质。早期解释表明，在氢气流中冷却后，可能形成Ga+离子或甚至Ga金属，这是从还原的Ga3+离子形成的。然而，最近的研究显示，通过氢气吸附在单价镓离子上形成镓化物是可逆的过程。这一发现挑战了传统对Ga物种在PDH过程中的看法，并表明氢的氧化性添加可以产生三价镓化物，而不是先前假设的由水氧化或与沸石骨架氧相互作用的还原物种。这一新见解为理解PDH过程中Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂提供了更深入的理解。
