[1] "The most extensive in situ study of the state of gallium in the working GaZSM-5 catalyst for propane aromatization has been carried out in Refs. [24,7]."
[2] "Subsequent cooling in a hydrogen atmosphere to room temperature resulted in the formation of Ga3+ ions either by oxidation of the reduced species by traces of water present in the hydrogen flow or due to interaction with the zeolite framework oxygen."
[3] "Moreover, DRIFT spectra of adsorbed CO gave insight into coordinatively unsaturated gallium species."
[4] "Reduction of gallium at high temperatures leads to the formation of low-coordinated Ga+ ions and to dihydride species to some extent."
[5] "The amount of the latter strongly increased after slow cooling of the gallium-modified samples to room temperature in hydrogen."
[6] "Therefore, we propose that oxidation of the univalent gallium ions does not proceed via traces of water but by the oxidative addition of hydrogen giving tervalent gallium hydride species."
[7] "All acid protons can be replaced by univalent Ga species upon reduction at 773 K of Ga/HZSM-5."
[8] "The replacement of protons by Ga suppresses dealumination to a large extent."
[9] "Evacuation of a reduced sample at 773 K leads to coordinatively unsaturated Ga+ ions."
[10] "These ions can be reversibly oxidized by nitrous oxide at 673 K."
[11] "On the other hand, cooling of a reduced sample in molecular hydrogen leads to the formation of gallium hydride species that compensate the negative framework charge."
[12] "The latter species are quite stable and can only be completely decomposed at relatively high temperature (773 K)."
[13] "Carbon monoxide probe DRIFT spectroscopy further allows the identification of the various Ga species in the micropore space of ZSM-5 zeolite."
