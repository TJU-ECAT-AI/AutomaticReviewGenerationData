The growing demand for propylene has led to advancements in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology. The development of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has been pivotal, with researchers focusing on the active gallium species involved in the catalytic process. Recent studies have clarified the role of gallium in suppressing dealumination, which enhances the efficiency of PDH. The understanding of Ga species within the zeolite structure has evolved, particularly through the use of DRIFT spectroscopy to identify gallium hydrides and their reversible oxidation states. This has contributed to a clearer picture of the chemistry involved in PDH catalysis, supporting the hypothesis that oxidation of reduced gallium species occurs via the oxidative addition of hydrogen, leading to tervalent gallium hydride species.

对丙烯日益增长的需求推动了丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术的进步。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH领域的应用至关重要，研究人员着重于催化过程中活性镓物种的作用。最近的研究澄清了镓在抑制dealumination方面的作用，这提高了PDH的效率。对zeolite结构中镓物种的理解已经发展，特别是通过使用DRIFT光谱来识别镓化物和其可逆氧化状态，为PDH催化过程的化学反应提供了一幅更清晰的图景。这支持了这样一个假设：在减压后的镓物种的氧化过程中，氢的氧化添加导致了三价镓化物的形成。
