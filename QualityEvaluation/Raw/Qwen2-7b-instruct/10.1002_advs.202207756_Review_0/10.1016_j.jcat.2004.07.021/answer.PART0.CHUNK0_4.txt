[1] "The most extensive in situ study of the state of gallium in the working GaZSM-5 catalyst for propane aromatization has been carried out in Refs. [24,7]."
[2] "Subsequent cooling in a hydrogen atmosphere to room temperature resulted in the formation of Ga3+ ions either by oxidation of the reduced species by traces of water present in the hydrogen flow or due to interaction with the zeolite framework oxygen."
[3] "Reduction of gallium at high temperatures leads to the formation of low-coordinated Ga+ ions and to dihydride species to some extent."
[4] "The amount of the latter strongly increased after slow cooling of the gallium-modified samples to room temperature in hydrogen."
[5] "Therefore, we propose that oxidation of the univalent gallium ions does not proceed via traces of water but by the oxidative addition of hydrogen giving tervalent gallium hydride species."
[6] "These results suggest that the earlier observed oxidation of reduced Ga/HZSM-5 can also be related to the oxidative addition of hydrogen."

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process converts propane into propylene through thermal cracking. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was a debate about the active Ga species involved in the catalytic process. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by revealing that reduction at high temperatures leads to the formation of low-coordinated Ga+ ions and dihydride species. After slow cooling of the gallium-modified samples to room temperature in hydrogen, the amount of these dihydride species increased significantly. It is now proposed that the oxidation of univalent gallium ions does not occur via traces of water but through the oxidative addition of hydrogen, leading to the formation of tervalent gallium hydride species. These findings suggest that the observed oxidation of reduced Ga/HZSM-5 can indeed be related to the oxidative addition of hydrogen.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这一过程通过热裂解将丙烷转化为丙烯。对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已经显著发展。最初，关于催化过程中活性Ga物种的辩论。最近的研究成果已经为这些催化剂的当前知识做出了贡献，揭示了在高温下还原会形成低配位的Ga+离子和二氢化物物种。在慢速冷却到室温的氢气中，这些二氢化物物种的数量显著增加。现在提出，单价镓离子的氧化并非通过氢流中的微量水分发生，而是通过氢的氧化插入形成三价镓氢化物物种。这些发现表明，观察到的减少Ga/HZSM-5的氧化确实可以与氢的氧化插入相关联。
