[1] "Apart from high oil prices, there are some other drivers in the search for alternative routes and feedstocks:• The production of lower olefins via steam cracking is one of the ten most energy-consuming processes of the chemical and petrochemical industry. (7) • There is a growing awareness of the depletion of conventional oil reserves. Some analysts suggest that oil consumption will surpass the discovery of new reserves followed by the depletion of known reserves. (8) • The oil contained in unconventional reserves is heavy oil in the case of so-called oil sands. The extraction and upgrading of unconventional oil currently may involve higher costs and higher CO2 emissions in comparison with conventional oil. (9) • There is a pressing necessity to decrease CO2 emissions. (10) Feedstocks such as biomass have lower net CO2 contribution. (11) • Many countries, among them Japan, China, and Brazil, are searching for alternatives to reduce their reliance on imported crude oil and refined products."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the high energy consumption of traditional steam cracking processes. The awareness of declining conventional oil reserves and the associated environmental impacts has accelerated the exploration of alternative feedstocks and production routes. Propane dehydrogenation utilizes propane as a feedstock to produce propylene, offering a more sustainable alternative. This method reduces dependency on imported crude oil and refined products, aligning with global efforts to decrease CO2 emissions and enhance energy efficiency. Research into Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, focusing on the identification of active gallium species and optimizing catalyst performance to enhance propylene selectivity and yield. Recent studies have contributed to a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanisms involved, leading to advancements in catalyst design and operation conditions for efficient propylene production.
