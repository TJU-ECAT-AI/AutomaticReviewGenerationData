[1] "Apart from high oil prices, there are some other drivers in the search for alternative routes and feedstocks:• The production of lower olefins via steam cracking is one of the ten most energy-consuming processes of the chemical and petrochemical industry."
[2] "The increased availability of natural gas from shale deposits has produced a major shift in the feedstocks used for the production of ethylene in U.S., and consequently it has affected the propylene and butadiene markets."
[3] "These processes are based on alternative feedstock such as coal, natural gas, or biomass."
[4] "For this reason, the South African government issued a license to start the oil-from-coal project after the Second World War."
[5] "The main aim of this process is to produce liquid fuels although lower olefins are also obtained depending on the operating conditions and the type of catalysts."
[6] "The highest light olefins selectivity was achieved with a coprecipitated catalysts (15:85 Mn:Fe). At a very high CO conversion (>90%), this catalyst showed a high C2C4 olefins selectivity (50%) and a methane selectivity of about 30%."
[7] "The highest C2C4 olefins selectivity (43%) was achieved at a high CO conversion (98%) along with a methane selectivity of about 30%."
[8] "In view of the importance of the nature of the support and its influence on catalytic performance extensive research has been performed to find an optimal combination of active metal, support, and modifiers."
[9] "A high selectivity to light olefins was observed by Yao et al. (88) when they performed the FischerTropsch reaction at 400 C and 18 bar using a ZrAl catalyst."
