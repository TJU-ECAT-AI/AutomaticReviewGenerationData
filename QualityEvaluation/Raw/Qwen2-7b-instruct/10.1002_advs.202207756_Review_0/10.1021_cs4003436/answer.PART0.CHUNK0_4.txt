The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The increased availability of natural gas from shale deposits has led to a shift in feedstocks for ethylene production, impacting propylene and butadiene markets. Alternative processes for propylene and butadiene production have emerged as a result. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has advanced, revealing insights into active Ga species. However, the debate about the exact nature of these active species persists, with ongoing research contributing to our knowledge.
