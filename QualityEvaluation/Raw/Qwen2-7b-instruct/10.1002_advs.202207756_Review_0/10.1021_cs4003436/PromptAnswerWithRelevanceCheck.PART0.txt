[1] "Apart from high oil prices, there are some other drivers in the search for alternative routes and feedstocks:• The production of lower olefins via steam cracking is one of the ten most energy-consuming processes of the chemical and petrochemical industry. (7) • There is a growing awareness of the depletion of conventional oil reserves. Some analysts suggest that oil consumption will surpass the discovery of new reserves followed by the depletion of known reserves. (8) • The oil contained in unconventional reserves is heavy oil in the case of so-called oil sands. The extraction and upgrading of unconventional oil currently may involve higher costs and higher CO2 emissions in comparison with conventional oil. (9) • There is a pressing necessity to decrease CO2 emissions. (10) Feedstocks such as biomass have lower net CO2 contribution. (11) • Many countries, among them Japan, China, and Brazil, are searching for alternatives to reduce their reliance on imported crude oil and refined products."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the high energy consumption of traditional steam cracking processes. The awareness of declining conventional oil reserves and the associated environmental impacts has accelerated the exploration of alternative feedstocks and production routes. Propane dehydrogenation utilizes propane as a feedstock to produce propylene, offering a more sustainable alternative. This method reduces dependency on imported crude oil and refined products, aligning with global efforts to decrease CO2 emissions and enhance energy efficiency. Research into Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, focusing on the identification of active gallium species and optimizing catalyst performance to enhance propylene selectivity and yield. Recent studies have contributed to a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanisms involved, leading to advancements in catalyst design and operation conditions for efficient propylene production.

[1] "The increased availability of natural gas from shale deposits has produced a major shift in the feedstocks used for the production of ethylene in U.S., and consequently it has affected the propylene and butadiene markets."
[2] "These processes are based on alternative feedstocks such as coal, natural gas, or biomass."
[3] "The use of biomass is mainly encouraged by its carbon-neutral nature."
[4] "Biomass gasification has potential as a source for hydrocarbon products in view of feedstock flexibility and the possibilities to reduce net CO2 emissions."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as a way to efficiently convert propane into propylene. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, with debates centered around the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to the current knowledge of these catalysts, but the specifics of the active Ga species are still under discussion. The catalysts have shown promise in propylene production, but the precise nature of the active site remains an area of ongoing investigation. The advancements in PDH catalysts have expanded the possibilities for propylene production, especially in regions with access to propane resources.

In response to the increasing demand for propylene and butadiene, new production methods have been developed utilizing alternative feedstocks such as coal, natural gas, or biomass. Biomass gasification is particularly appealing due to its carbon-neutral nature and the potential for reducing net CO2 emissions. However, the use of biomass for propylene production faces challenges related to the cost of collecting and transporting biomass on a large scale and the production of synthesis gas. 

Coal, once a minor player in the chemical industry, is being reconsidered as a feedstock for the production of chemicals due to the high demand for energy, rising oil and gas prices, and the need for countries rich in coal to reduce their reliance on imported crude oil. While coal has long been used for the production of acetylene and ammonia, its role diminished in the era of abundant low-cost oil and gas. 

As the demand for lower olefins continues to rise, the need for a reliable supply of feedstocks in the petrochemical industry grows. The comparison between the Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO) process and methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process is complex, as it depends on various factors such as capital and operational costs, the availability of specific feedstocks, and the desired product slate. The application of FTO processes is contingent on further improvements in the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalytic systems involved.

丙烯需求的增长已经推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），作为高效生产丙烯的方法。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的了解已经显著发展，围绕活性Ga物种的争论是焦点。最近的研究为当前这些催化剂的知识做出了贡献，但活性Ga物种的具体性质仍然是一个正在进行研究的主题。这些催化剂在丙烯生产中显示出潜力，但活性位点的确切性质仍然是讨论的领域。PDH催化剂的进步扩大了丙烯生产的可能性，特别是在具有丙烷资源的地区。

为了应对对丙烯和丁二烯不断增长的需求，新的生产方法正在利用煤炭、天然气或生物质等替代原料。生物质气化特别吸引人，因为它具有碳中性特性，并有可能减少净二氧化碳排放。然而，使用生物质生产丙烯面临成本收集和运输生物质大规模的挑战，以及合成气的生产。

煤炭曾经在化工行业中的作用较小，但由于能源需求的增加、石油和天然气价格的上涨以及煤炭丰富的国家减少对进口原油依赖的战略驱动，正在被重新考虑作为化学品生产的主要原料。虽然煤炭长期以来被用于生产乙酸乙烯酯和氨，但在石油和天然气成本低廉的时代，它的作用减弱。

随着对更低烯烃需求的增长，对石化工业所需原料的可靠供应需求也在增长。Fischer-Tropsch到烯烃（FTO）过程与甲醇到烯烃（MTO）过程之间的比较复杂，这取决于资本和运营成本、特定原料的可用性和预期的产品系列等因素。将FTO过程应用于生产是依赖于催化系统进一步提高活性、选择性和稳定性的改进。
