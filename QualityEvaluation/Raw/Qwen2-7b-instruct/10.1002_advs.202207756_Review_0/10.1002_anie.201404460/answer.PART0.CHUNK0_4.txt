[1] "Currently, the USA is at the lowest level of crude oil imports in 25years."
[2] "While oil production has greatly increased in these shale plays, natural gas has increased even more significantly, with the Energy Information Agency projecting that by 2040, 50% of the natural gas production within the USA will come from shale."
[3] "A recent study estimates that there are 207trillion cubic meters of technically recoverable shale gas globally."
[4] "Although most shale gas outside of the USA is not currently produced, it is reasonable to expect that these low-cost feedstocks for chemicals and fuels production will become available worldwide."
[5] "Since substantial amounts of heavier paraffins, such as propane are obtained from shale gas deposits, there is a vast and growing interest in utilizing propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies for the on purpose production of propene."
[6] "Within this context, it is important to mention that there have been five newly announced PDH units in the USA, while 9 to 17PDH units may be built in China."
[7] "This is in contrast with our current catalyst, in which Pt is present in minute amounts and Ga is the active dehydrogenation element."
[8] "Evidently, both Pt and Ga are required to obtain a highly active selective and stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst."
[9] "In case of the catalysts containing both Pt and Ga, this value is close to the equilibrium conversion (which is ca. 55% at 620C and 1atm pressure) for the first dehydrogenation cycle."
[10] "It was found that the PDH activity drops significantly during the first two days of testing, after which the catalyst performance remained stable during a twelve-day evaluation period."
[11] "Interestingly, the presence of Pt in the catalyst material has a significant effect on the D/G ratio."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by increasing the need for efficient and selective catalysts capable of converting propane to propene. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with the debate shifting towards recognizing Ga as the active dehydrogenation element rather than just a promoter. Recent research findings suggest that the synergy between platinum (Pt) and gallium (Ga) is crucial for achieving high activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH catalysts. Pt acts as a promoter, enhancing the performance of the Ga component, while Ga facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction. The presence of both elements ensures that the catalysts can maintain high conversion rates and selectivity for propene production, even after multiple dehydrogenation cycles. The catalysts' ability to resist deactivation, especially by coke deposition, is attributed to the introduction of alkali metal dopants like potassium (K), which increases propene selectivity and reduces coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst surface. This advancement in catalyst design addresses the ongoing challenges in PDH technology, aiming to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact in the production of propene from propane feedstock.

对丙烯的日益增长的需求已经影响了生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），因为需要高效和选择性的催化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯。对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解已经发展，争论从认为Ga只是促进剂转向认可Ga作为脱氢反应的活性元素。最近的研究发现表明，铂（Pt）和镓（Ga）之间的协同作用对于实现高活性、选择性和稳定性的PDH催化剂至关重要。Pt作为促进剂，增强Ga组件的性能，而Ga则促进脱氢反应。两个元素的存在确保催化剂能够保持高的转化率和丙烯选择性，即使在多次脱氢循环后也是如此。催化剂抵抗失活的能力，特别是由焦炭沉积导致的失活，归因于引入碱金属掺杂如钾（K），这通过毒化催化剂表面的Brnsted酸位点来增加丙烯选择性和减少焦炭形成。这种催化剂设计的进步解决了PDH技术的持续挑战，旨在提高效率并减少生产丙烯时的环境影响。
