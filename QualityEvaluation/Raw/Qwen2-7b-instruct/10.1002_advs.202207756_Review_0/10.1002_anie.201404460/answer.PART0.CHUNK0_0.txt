Platinum-Promoted Ga/Al2O3 as Highly Active, Selective, and Stable Catalyst for the Dehydrogenation of Propane

Since substantial amounts of heavier paraffins, such as propane are obtained from shale gas deposits, there is a vast and growing interest in utilizing propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies for the on purpose production of propene.

A few papers have already been published, in which Pt and Ga were combined to produce PDH catalysts, but in these systems Ga is deemed to function as a promoter element, with Pt being the active dehydrogenation element. 

This is in contrast with our current catalyst, in which Pt is present in minute amounts and Ga is the active dehydrogenation element. A clear synergistic effect is observed between both components, which results in a very stable catalyst material that is highly resistant to deactivation, e.g., by coking.

Alkali metal dopants, such as K, are known to increase the propene selectivity and decrease coke deposition by poisoning the Brnsted acid sites present in the PDH catalysts.

For the eighth cycle, the values of propane conversion and propene selectivity have dropped for all catalysts. The deactivation is the least severe for those catalysts containing both Pt and Ga. It is known that Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts deactivate due to sintering of the metal nanoparticles, an effect provoked by the harsh conditions of the dehydrogenation reaction.

In Figure3, the operando Raman spectra obtained at the end of the eighth propane dehydrogenation cycle are shown for the different investigated catalysts.

The nature of the coke deposits formed on the catalyst surface can be obtained from the ratio of these two Raman bands. 

When looking at the D/G ratio shown in Table1, the catalyst materials that contain Pt and Ga have a D/G ratio of around 0.75, while catalyst materials that do not have Pt in their composition have a D/G ratio of approximately 0.97.

A possible explanation is that Pt further dehydrogenates the carbon deposits, leading to a higher graphitic portion in the coke.

The specific nature of the gallium species present on the catalyst was investigated by collecting 71Ga MAS NMR (magic-angle spinning NMR) and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) spectra of the fresh Pt3Ga and 3Ga catalysts.

The presence of Pt results in a higher concentration of surface tetrahedral Ga3+ species.

Nevertheless, such a relatively small increase in active sites cannot account for the high activity observed for the Pt3Ga catalyst, compared to 3Ga.

We postulate that the Pt assists in the recombination of the hydrogen atoms on the catalyst, making the active sites available for the following dehydrogenation cycle.

Finally, the Pt3GaK catalyst was compared with a wide range of other catalyst materials reported in literature, as well as a commercial CrOx catalyst.

When comparing the propylene yield with the weight hourly space velocity, the Pt3GaK catalyst displays a superior activity, further highlighting the excellent catalytic performance of the material.

In summary, different Pt-Ga-K-containing catalyst materials have been examined for the selective dehydrogenation of propane into propene and it was found that the combination of 1000ppm Pt and 1.53wt% Ga results in a highly active and selective catalyst.

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by increasing interest in on-purpose propene production from shale gas. Research has evolved to understand Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, highlighting the role of gallium as an active dehydrogenation element rather than just a promoter. Studies have shown that gallium, in synergy with platinum, forms a highly active and stable catalyst that is resistant to deactivation. Alkali metal dopants like potassium improve propene selectivity and reduce coke deposition. The Pt3GaK catalyst, in particular, demonstrates superior activity in PDH, indicating a synergistic effect between platinum and gallium, and the assistance of platinum in recombining hydrogen atoms to maintain active sites for subsequent dehydrogenation cycles.

The active gallium species in the Ga/Al2O3 catalysts are identified as coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species, which are responsible for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The presence of platinum enhances the activity of the gallium species by facilitating the recombination of hydrogen atoms, ensuring the availability of active sites for the next dehydrogenation cycle. The Pt3GaK catalyst, with its optimized gallium and platinum composition, outperforms other catalysts in terms of propylene yield, showcasing its exceptional catalytic performance.

丙烯需求的增长对生产方法的发展产生了影响，特别是通过增加从页岩气中制备丙烯的兴趣来生产丙烯。对于PDH催化剂的研究已经进化到理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂，强调了镓作为活性脱氢化元素的角色，而不仅仅是促进剂。研究表明，镓与铂的协同作用形成了一个高度活跃且不易失活的催化剂。碱土金属掺杂剂如钾可以提高丙烯的选择性和减少焦炭沉积，通过毒化PDH催化剂上的布兰斯特酸位点。Pt3GaK催化剂特别表现出在PDH中的优越活性，表明了镓和铂之间协同作用的效果，并且铂有助于重组氢原子，保持活性位点以进行后续的脱氢化循环。

Ga/Al2O3催化剂中的活性镓物种被识别为配位不饱和Ga3+物种，这些物种负责将丙烷转化为丙烯。铂的存在增强了镓物种的活性，通过促进氢原子的重组，确保活性位点可用于下一个脱氢化循环。优化了镓和铂组成的Pt3GaK催化剂，在丙烯产量方面表现出色，突显其出色的催化性能。
