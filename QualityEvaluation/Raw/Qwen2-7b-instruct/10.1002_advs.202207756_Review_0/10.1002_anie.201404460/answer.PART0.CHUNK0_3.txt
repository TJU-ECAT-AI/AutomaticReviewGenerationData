1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by increasing the interest in utilizing propane for propene production. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with recent research findings that Ga performs the actual dehydrogenation reaction, while Pt acts as a promoter element, challenging the previous view that Ga functions solely as a promoter.

2. The synergy between platinum (Pt) and gallium (Ga) has led to the development of highly active and stable catalysts for the selective dehydrogenation of propane. This has resulted in the creation of a bifunctional active phase, where coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species are the active species and Pt promotes the reaction.

3. The catalyst materials developed involve the combination of 1000 ppm Pt, 3 wt% Ga, and 0.25 wt% K supported on alumina, which exhibits a synergy between Ga and Pt, making the catalyst highly active and stable.

4. The catalyst materials prepared through the incipient wetness impregnation method show a complex structure with a synergistic and bifunctional character originating from the supported Ga and Pt moieties.

5. Gallium (Ga) is now recognized as the active species in the dehydrogenation reaction, rather than functioning merely as a promoter, as previously thought in the literature.

6. The Pt-containing catalyst, despite its presence, is nearly inactive in the dehydrogenation reaction, and its dispersion decreases significantly after being treated under air at high temperatures. This implies that the active role in the reaction is attributed to Ga species.

1. 石油烯烃需求的增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），这增加了对利用丙烷生产丙烯的兴趣。对于PDH催化剂的了解已经发展，特别是在最近的研究发现中，镓（Ga）执行脱氢反应，而铂（Pt）作为促进剂，挑战了之前认为Ga仅作为促进剂的角色。

2. 铂和镓之间的协同作用导致了高度活性和稳定的催化剂开发，用于选择性脱氢丙烷。这导致了具有双功能活性相的催化剂的创建，其中协调不饱和的Ga3+物种是活性物种，而Pt促进了反应。

3. 开发的催化剂材料涉及以1000 ppm Pt、3 wt% Ga和0.25 wt% K支持在氧化铝上，显示了Ga和Pt物种支持的复杂结构，具有协同性和双功能特性。

4. 通过浸渍湿法准备的催化剂材料显示出复杂的结构，具有协同性和双功能特性，源于支持的Ga和Pt物种。

5. 现在认识到Ga是反应中的活性物种，而不是仅作为促进剂的角色，这是以前文献中所认为的。

6. 即使存在Pt催化剂，其在脱氢反应中几乎是无效的，并且在高温度下被空气处理后其分散度显著降低。这意味着活性角色归因于Ga物种。
