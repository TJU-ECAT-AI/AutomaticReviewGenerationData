[1] "Since substantial amounts of heavier paraffins, such as propane are obtained from shale gas deposits, there is a vast and growing interest in utilizing propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies for the on purpose production of propene."
[2] "A few papers have already been published, in which Pt and Ga were combined to produce PDH catalysts, but in these systems Ga is deemed to function as a promoter element, with Pt being the active dehydrogenation element.7 This is in contrast with our current catalyst, in which Pt is present in minute amounts and Ga is the active dehydrogenation element."
[3] "A bifunctional active phase is proposed, in which coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species are the active species and Pt functions as promoter."
[4] "We postulate that the Pt assists in the recombination of the hydrogen atoms on the catalyst, making the active sites available for the following dehydrogenation cycle."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by increasing interest in technologies that can efficiently convert propane into propene. Recent advancements in PDH catalysts have focused on utilizing a synergistic combination of platinum (Pt) and gallium (Ga) on alumina supports. Unlike previous catalyst systems where Ga primarily served as a promoter, this new catalyst design positions Ga as the active dehydrogenation element with Pt functioning as a promoter. This bifunctional active phase enables highly active and stable catalysts that resist deactivation, particularly by coke formation. The Pt assists in recombining hydrogen atoms, making the active sites available for subsequent dehydrogenation cycles, thus enhancing the overall catalytic performance.

对丙烯的巨大需求已经影响了生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），人们越来越关注能够高效将丙烷转化为丙烯的技术。最近在PDH催化剂领域的进步集中在利用铂（Pt）和镓（Ga）的协同组合在氧化铝载体上。与之前催化剂系统中镓主要作为促进剂不同，这种新型催化剂设计将镓定位为活性脱氢元素，而铂则作为促进剂发挥作用。这种双功能活性相使催化剂具有高度的活性和稳定性，并且能抵抗失活，尤其是避免焦炭沉积。铂帮助重组氢原子，使得活性位点可供后续脱氢周期使用，从而增强整体催化性能。
