Plastic waste is a significant environmental concern due to its slow degradation and accumulation in ecosystems. Various recycling technologies are being developed to address this issue, including mechanical recycling, chemical recycling, and advanced recycling. Advanced recycling, also known as chemical recycling, involves converting plastics back into their original monomers or smaller chemical building blocks, which can then be used to manufacture new products.

One of the key challenges in plastic recycling is the lack of suitable catalysts for efficient and selective chemical recycling processes. This is particularly true for the dehydrogenation of propane, a common byproduct in plastic manufacturing, to produce propene, which is essential for downstream chemical synthesis. The development of efficient catalysts is crucial for enhancing the sustainability and efficiency of the entire plastic recycling process.

The recent exploration and production of hydrocarbons from shale basins in the USA, such as in Barnett, Marcellus, Haynesville, and Eagle Ford, has led to a rebound in energy competitiveness. Currently, the USA is at the lowest level of crude oil imports in 25 years. While oil production has greatly increased in these shale plays, natural gas has increased even more significantly, with the Energy Information Agency projecting that by 2040, 50% of the natural gas production within the USA will come from shale. These developments will undoubtedly impose significant technical and economic challenges and opportunities on the chemical industry as a whole.

Since substantial amounts of heavier paraffins, such as propane, are obtained from shale gas deposits, there is a vast and growing interest in utilizing propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies for the on-purpose production of propene. This is particularly relevant given the increasing demand for propylene in various industries, including petrochemicals, plastics, and synthetic fibers. Within this context, it is important to mention that there have been five newly announced PDH units in the USA, while 9 to 17 PDH units may be built in China. The majority of these projects is based on one of the two primary existing technologies for PDH; i.e., the Oleflex process from UOP and the CATOFIN process from CB&I Lummus. Although substantial improvements in catalyst materials (Pt-Sn/Al2O3 for Oleflex and Cr/Al2O3 for CATOFIN) and process conditions have been made for both technologies, challenges related to their activity, stability, and selectivity still have to be overcome.

Here we present a new family of very stable, active, and selective catalyst materials for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene based on PtGa/Al2O3. A few papers have already been published, in which Pt and Ga were combined to produce PDH catalysts, but in these systems, Ga is deemed to function as a promoter element, with Pt being the active dehydrogenation element. This is in contrast with our current catalyst, in which Pt is present in minute amounts and Ga is the active dehydrogenation element. A clear synergistic effect is observed between both components, which results in a very stable catalyst material that is highly resistant to deactivation, e.g., by coking.

To perform a systematic study, a series of nine catalyst materials was prepared by depositing 1000ppm Pt, 1.5 or 3wt% Ga, and 0.25wt% K on an alumina support. From these characterization data, it is concluded that all the compounds are homogeneously and highly dispersed on the catalyst materials as there is no evidence for the presence of crystalline nanoparticles.

The catalytic performance of the prepared materials has been tested in a lab-scale reactor for eight successive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. Each cycle consists of a 15 min PDH step at 620°C, followed by a treatment in air at 750°C for 30 min. The reactor is flushed with He between these steps. The resultant gas stream is analyzed by gas chromatography. The setup also allows for the use of operando Raman and UV/Vis spectroscopy to track the deposition of coke on the catalyst materials.

The exact values of conversion (X) and selectivity (S) for the first, second, and eighth cycle are summarized in Table 1. Additionally, Figure 1 shows a comparison between the conversion and selectivity obtained during the first eight cycles for the bare Al2O3 support, Pt, 3Ga, Pt3Ga, and Pt3GaK catalyst materials.

From Table 1 and Figure 1, it can be concluded that the catalytic conversion varies strongly between the different catalyst materials. In case of the catalysts containing both Pt and Ga, this value is close to the equilibrium conversion (which is ca. 55% at 620°C and 1 atm pressure) for the first dehydrogenation cycle. When Pt is absent, the conversion is roughly halved, while the absence of Ga results in an even greater drop in conversion. At the same time, the selectivity is high for all catalysts containing both Pt and Ga, but decreases for the materials containing only Pt or Ga. This implies a synergy between Pt and Ga that results in a highly active and selective catalyst. Alkali metal dopants, such as K, are known to increase the propene selectivity and decrease coke deposition by poisoning the Brnsted acid sites present in the PDH catalysts.

Finally, the Pt3GaK catalyst was compared with a wide range of other catalyst materials reported in literature, as well as a commercial CrOx catalyst. When comparing the propylene yield with the weight hourly space velocity, the Pt3GaK catalyst displays a superior activity, further highlighting the excellent catalytic performance of the material.

In summary, different Pt-Ga-K-containing catalyst materials have been examined for the selective dehydrogenation of propane into propene and it was found that the combination of 1000ppm Pt and 1.5-3wt% Ga results in a highly active and selective catalyst. The catalyst is highly resistant to coking and remains active for prolonged reaction times. A combination of structural, morphological, and surface characterization reveals a complex catalyst material with a synergistic and bifunctional character originating from the supported Ga and Pt moieties, with Ga performing the actual dehydrogenation reaction and Pt being a unique promoting element.

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to efficiently convert propane into propene. This is crucial for meeting the increasing demand for propylene in various industries. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, particularly concerning the active Ga species. Recent research has identified that the synergy between Pt and Ga, where Ga acts as the active dehydrogenation element and Pt as a unique promoting agent, leads to highly active and selective catalysts. These catalysts are resistant to deactivation and remain effective over prolonged reaction times, offering a sustainable solution for the chemical industry's challenges and opportunities in plastic recycling and propylene production.
