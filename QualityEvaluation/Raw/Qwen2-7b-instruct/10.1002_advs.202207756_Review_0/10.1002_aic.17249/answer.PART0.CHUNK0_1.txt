[1] "The global CO2 emission has increased its atmospheric concentration to 415 ppm in 2019, which has been linked to climate change and ocean acidification."
[2] "The majority of the anthropogenic CO2 emission comes from power plants, transportation, cement and steel industries, and agriculture, among which fossil fuel-based power plants contribute to 33%40% of the total CO2 emission."
[3] "Several strategies have been proposed to minimize CO2 emission, such as deployment of renewable (e.g., solar and wind) or nuclear energy, shift from coal to natural/shale gas (less CO2 emission per unit energy2), and CO2 capture, storage, and utilization (CCSU)."
[4] "To date, a huge reserve (ca. 16.1 quadrillion cubic feet) of shale gas has been discovered globally. The advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques have boosted the supply of shale gas, mainly from the US market, which is altering the global energy landscape."
[5] "Although the prominent component in shale gas is methane, other light alkanes (ethane, propane, and butane) account for up to 15% hydrocarbons in shale basins and are typically under-utilized."
[6] "Instead of using molecular H2, light alkanes can be used as the source of hydrogen to activate and upgrade CO2."
[7] "The emerging strategy of simultaneously upgrading the greenhouse gas CO2 and the underutilized light alkanes has demonstrated potentials to synthesize several important petrochemical feedstocks from the abundant CO2 and shale gas."
[8] "Moreover, the gaseous product stream (CO, H2, and olefins) can be further upgraded into value-added liquid products, such as aromatics (e.g., benzene, toluene, and xylenes [BTX]) via a tandem aromatisation process20 or oxygenates via a downstream hydroformylation process using tandem reactors.21"
[9] "Furthermore, in order to achieve a net reduction in CO2 emission, the upgrading of CO2 should avoid the utilization of molecular H2 unless it is produced from renewable sources such as those highlighted in previous studies."
[10] "For both environmental and sustainability reasons, shale/natural gas has been treated as a highly appealing alternative to petroleum and coal before the large-scale application of renewable energy resources."
[11] "The utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant has been mentioned for the dehydrogenation of alkanes."
[12] "However, fundamental understanding of actives sites or reaction mechanisms was lacking."
[13] "In this Perspective, we discuss recent advances of CO2-assited dehydrogenation, aramatisation, and hydroformylation reactions."
[14] "Depending on the selective bond cleavage of light alkanes, the gaseous products can be syngas (CO and H2) and olefins from the CO2-assisted dry reforming (DR, both CC and CH bond scission) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH, CH bond scission only) pathways, respectively."
[15] "Moreover, the gaseous product stream (CO, H2, and olefins) can be further upgraded into value-added liquid products, such as aromatics (e.g., benzene, toluene, and xylenes [BTX]) via a tandem aromatisation process or oxygenates via a downstream hydroformylation process using tandem reactors."
[16] "In this Perspective, we will discuss recent results from our group in reacting CO2 and light alkanes to produce syngas, olefins, aromatics, and oxygenates."
[17] "We will mainly use the simultaneous upgrading of CO2 and ethane (SU-CO2Et) as examples to demonstrate the feasibility and reaction pathways of these processes."
[18] "We will briefly discuss synthesis methods and essential structural characterization techniques that can be applied to SU-CO2Et catalysts."
[19] "We will then illustrate how to identify and apply distinct active sites for different upgrading processes, using a combination of kinetic studies, in situ characterization, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations."
[20] "We will conclude the Perspective by pointing out challenges and potential directions in catalyst design and synthesis, as well as structural characterization and mechanistic investigations, to further advance the simultaneous upgrading of CO2 and light alkanes."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by shifting focus towards more efficient and environmentally friendly processes. Propane dehydrogenation involves converting propane into propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. The use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has been a subject of considerable interest and research. These catalysts incorporate gallium (Ga) and hydrogen (H) into zeolite ZSM-5, a type of molecular sieve that is effective for catalytic processes. The ongoing debate around the active Ga species in these catalysts pertains to understanding which form of gallium is most effective in promoting the dehydrogenation reaction. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge by exploring the structure-function relationships of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, identifying the specific active sites that drive the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, and optimizing the catalyst design to enhance the yield and selectivity of propylene production. The advancements in this area aim to address challenges such as coke deposition and to improve the overall efficiency and sustainability of propane dehydrogenation processes.
