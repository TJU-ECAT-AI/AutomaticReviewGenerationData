[1] "The majority of the anthropogenic CO2 emission comes from power plants, transportation, cement and steel industries, and agriculture, among which fossil fuel-based power plants contribute to 33%40% of the total CO2 emission."
[2] "Several strategies have been proposed to minimize CO2 emission, such as deployment of renewable (e.g., solar and wind) or nuclear energy, shift from coal to natural/shale gas (less CO2 emission per unit energy2), and CO2 capture, storage, and utilization (CCSU)."
[3] "For both environmental and sustainability reasons, shale/natural gas has been treated as a highly appealing alternative to petroleum and coal before the large-scale application of renewable energy resources."
[4] "The utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant has been mentioned for the dehydrogenation of alkanes."
[5] "Depending on the selective bond cleavage of light alkanes, the gaseous products can be syngas (CO and H2) and olefins from the CO2-assisted dry reforming (DR, both CC and CH bond scission) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH, CH bond scission only) pathways, respectively."
[6] "Moreover, the gaseous product stream (CO, H2, and olefins) can be further upgraded into value-added liquid products, such as aromatics (e.g., benzene, toluene, and xylenes [BTX]) via a tandem aromatization process or oxygenates via a downstream hydroformylation process using tandem reactors."
[7] "Furthermore, in order to achieve a net reduction in CO2 emission, the upgrading of CO2 should avoid the utilization of molecular H2 unless it is produced from renewable sources such as those highlighted in previous studies."
[8] "To date, a huge reserve (ca. 16.1 quadrillion cubic feet) of shale gas has been discovered globally."
[9] "Although the prominent component in shale gas is methane, other light alkanes (ethane, propane, and butane) account for up to 15% hydrocarbons in shale basins and are typically under-utilized."
[10] "Instead of using molecular H2, light alkanes can be used as the source of hydrogen to activate and upgrade CO2."
[11] "The emerging strategy of simultaneously upgrading the greenhouse gas CO2 and the underutilized light alkanes has demonstrated potentials to synthesize several important petrochemical feedstocks from the abundant CO2 and shale gas."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process involves the conversion of propane into propylene. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was a debate about the active Ga species. However, recent research has provided insights into the role of Ga in these catalysts. It has been found that Ga influences the strength of the acid sites on the zeolite, facilitating the H2/ethylene desorption and lowering the activation energy for CH bond scission. Additionally, the incorporation of P in ZSM-5 can increase the hydrothermal stability, tune the acid-base properties, and decrease coke formation. This combination of Ga and P in ZSM-5 has been shown to improve the liquid aromatic yield and stability in the presence of CO2.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。该过程涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经显著发展。最初，关于活性Ga物种存在争议。然而，最近的研究提供了这些催化剂中Ga的作用的见解。研究发现，Ga影响了沸石上的酸性位点的强度，促进了H2/乙烯的脱附，并降低了CH键断裂的活化能。此外，在ZSM-5中加入P可以提高水热稳定性，调节酸碱性质，并减少焦炭形成。Ga和P在ZSM-5中的结合已被证明可以在CO2的存在下改善液体芳香族产量和稳定性。
