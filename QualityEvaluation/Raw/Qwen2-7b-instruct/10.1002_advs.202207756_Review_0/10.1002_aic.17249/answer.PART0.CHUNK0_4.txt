[1] "The global CO2 emission has increased its atmospheric concentration to 415 ppm in 2019, which has been linked to climate change and ocean acidification."
[2] "Several strategies have been proposed to minimize CO2 emission, such as deployment of renewable (e.g., solar and wind) or nuclear energy, shift from coal to natural/shale gas (less CO2 emission per unit energy2), and CO2 capture, storage, and utilization (CCSU)."
[3] "The utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant has been mentioned for the dehydrogenation of alkanes."
[4] "In this Perspective, we discuss recent advances of CO2-assited dehydrogenation,aromatization,and hydroformylation reactions."
[5] "Depending on the selective bond cleavage of light alkanes, the gaseous products can be syngas (CO and H2) and olefins from the CO2-assisted dry reforming (DR, both C C and C H bond scission) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH, C H bond scission only) pathways, respec- tively."
[6] "Moreover, the gaseous product stream (CO, H2, and olefins) can be further upgraded into value-added liquid products, such as aro- matics (e.g., benzene, toluene, and xylenes [BTX]) via a tandem aromati- zation process20 or oxygenates via a downstream hydroformylation process using tandem reactors.21"
[7] "The emerging strategy of simultaneously upgrading the greenhouse gas CO2 and the underutilized light alkanes has demonstrated poten- tials to synthesize several important petrochemical feedstocks from the abundant CO2 and shale gas."

The demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was a debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has provided new insights into the role of Ga in the PDH process. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been found to enhance the conversion of propane to propylene, thanks to the strong acidity of the Ga-containing zeolite. These catalysts have the ability to facilitate the dehydrogenation of propane, leading to propylene production. The Ga dopant modifies the structure and acidity of the zeolite, thus improving its activity and selectivity for the PDH reaction. This has contributed to the development of more efficient PDH technologies for propylene production from propane.

丙烯需求的增长已经推动了新型生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH过程中的作用有了新的理解。最初，关于活性Ga物种存在争议。最近的研究提供了这些催化剂在PDH过程中角色的新见解。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂被发现能够增强丙烷转化为丙烯的能力，这归功于Ga掺杂的沸石的强酸性。这些催化剂能够促进丙烷的脱氢反应，从而生成丙烯。Ga掺杂物改变了沸石的结构和酸性，从而提高了其PDH反应的活性和选择性。这为从丙烷生产丙烯的更高效的PDH技术的发展做出了贡献。
