[1] "The global CO2 emission has increased its atmospheric concentration to 415 ppm in 2019, which has been linked to climate change and ocean acidification."
[2] "The majority of the anthropogenic CO2 emission comes from power plants, transportation, cement and steel industries, and agriculture, among which fossil fuel-based power plants contribute to 33%40% of the total CO2 emission."
[3] "Several strategies have been proposed to minimize CO2 emission, such as deployment of renewable (e.g., solar and wind) or nuclear energy, shift from coal to natural/shale gas (less CO2 emission per unit energy2), and CO2 capture, storage, and utilization (CCSU)."
[4] "To date, a huge reserve (ca. 16.1 quadrillion cubic feet) of shale gas has been discovered globally. The advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques have boosted the supply of shale gas, mainly from the US market, which is altering the global energy landscape."
[5] "Although the prominent component in shale gas is methane, other light alkanes (ethane, propane, and butane) account for up to 15% hydrocarbons in shale basins and are typically under-utilized."
[6] "Instead of using molecular H2, light alkanes can be used as the source of hydrogen to activate and upgrade CO2."
[7] "The emerging strategy of simultaneously upgrading the greenhouse gas CO2 and the underutilized light alkanes has demonstrated potentials to synthesize several important petrochemical feedstocks from the abundant CO2 and shale gas."
[8] "The utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant has been mentioned for the dehydrogenation of alkanes."
[9] "Depending on the selective bond cleavage of light alkanes, the gaseous products can be syngas (CO and H2) and olefins from the CO2-assisted dry reforming (DR, both CC and CH bond scission) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH, CH bond scission only) pathways, respectively."
[10] "Moreover, the gaseous product stream (CO, H2, and olefins) can be further upgraded into value-added liquid products, such as aromatics (e.g., benzene, toluene, and xylenes [BTX]) via a tandem aromatization process or oxygenates via a downstream hydroformylation process using tandem reactors."

To address the growing demand for propylene, particularly from propane dehydrogenation (PDH), new production methods have emerged that leverage the use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. These catalysts have been pivotal in enhancing the efficiency of PDH processes. Research on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts has significantly evolved, shedding light on the active Ga species and their role in the catalytic activity. The catalysts' ability to promote dehydrogenation reactions has been a focus of ongoing debates and recent studies. These catalysts are known for their potential to influence the strength of acid sites on zeolites, facilitating the H2/ethylene desorption, and lowering the activation energy for C-H bond scission. Incorporating Ga in ZSM-5 zeolites has been shown to impact the acid-base properties, potentially leading to improved stability and reduced coke formation. Recent advancements have highlighted the importance of modifying ZSM-5 with P to tune its hydrothermal stability, adjust its acid-base characteristics, and decrease coke formation. Ga/ZSM-5/P catalysts, specifically, have demonstrated improved liquid aromatic yields and enhanced stability in CO2-assisted PDH processes. These catalysts have the potential to bridge the gap between decreasing supplies and increasing demands for BTX products by efficiently converting propane into aromatic compounds through the synergistic effects of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation and aromatization steps.

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by shifting focus towards more efficient and environmentally friendly processes. Propane dehydrogenation involves converting propane into propylene, a key petrochemical feedstock. The use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has been a subject of considerable interest and research. These catalysts incorporate gallium (Ga) and hydrogen (H) into zeolite ZSM-5, a type of molecular sieve that is effective for catalytic processes. The ongoing debate around the active Ga species in these catalysts pertains to understanding which form of gallium is most effective in promoting the dehydrogenation reaction. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge by exploring the structure-function relationships of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, identifying the specific active sites that drive the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, and optimizing the catalyst design to enhance the yield and selectivity of propylene production. The advancements in this area aim to address challenges such as coke deposition and to improve the overall efficiency and sustainability of propane dehydrogenation processes.
