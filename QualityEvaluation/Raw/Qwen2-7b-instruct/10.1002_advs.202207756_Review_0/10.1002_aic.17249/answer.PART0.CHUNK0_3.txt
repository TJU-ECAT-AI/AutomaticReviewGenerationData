[1] "The global CO2 emission has increased its atmospheric concentration to 415 ppm in 2019, which has been linked to climate change and ocean acidification."
[2] "The majority of the anthropogenic CO2 emission comes from power plants, transportation, cement and steel industries, and agriculture, among which fossil fuel-based power plants contribute to 33%40% of the total CO2 emission."
[3] "Several strategies have been proposed to minimize CO2 emission, such as deployment of renewable (e.g., solar and wind) or nuclear energy, shift from coal to natural/shale gas (less CO2 emission per unit energy2), and CO2 capture, storage, and utilization (CCSU)."
[4] "In recent years, extensive efforts have been devoted to reducing the additional operating costs and energy penalty resulted from capturing and concentrating CO2, making it attractive to utilize CO2 at point sources (e.g., power plants) for the sustainable synthesis of value-added chemicals or fuels."
[5] "Shale/natural gas has been treated as a highly appealing alternative to petroleum and coal before the large-scale application of renewable energy resources."
[6] "The utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant has been mentioned for the dehydrogenation of alkanes."
[7] "Moreover, the gaseous product stream (CO, H2, and olefins) can be further upgraded into value-added liquid products, such as aromatics (e.g., benzene, toluene, and xylenes [BTX]) via a tandem aromatization process20 or oxygenates via a downstream hydroformylation process using tandem reactors.21"
[8] "Furthermore, in order to achieve a net reduction in CO2 emission, the upgrading of CO2 should avoid the utilization of molecular H2 unless it is produced from renewable sources such as those highlighted in previous studies."
[9] "The emerging strategy of simultaneously upgrading the greenhouse gas CO2 and the underutilized light alkanes has demonstrated potentials to synthesize several important petrochemical feedstocks from the abundant CO2 and shale gas."
