The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as companies seek more efficient ways to produce propylene. This has led to a focus on understanding the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts used in PDH processes. There is an ongoing debate regarding the active Ga species within these catalysts, and recent research has provided insights that have advanced our understanding of their functionality.
