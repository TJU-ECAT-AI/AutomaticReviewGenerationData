Answer: The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the need for more efficient and selective catalytic processes. This has led to advancements in catalyst design and evaluation. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by elucidating factors such as the role of Ga in promoting the PDH reaction, the stability of the catalyst under operational conditions, and the mechanisms behind its activity and selectivity. These studies have helped refine the synthesis and use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for optimal performance in PDH processes.
