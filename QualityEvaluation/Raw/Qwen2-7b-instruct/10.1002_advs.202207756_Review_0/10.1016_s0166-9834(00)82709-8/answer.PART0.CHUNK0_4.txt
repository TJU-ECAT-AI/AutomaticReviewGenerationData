1. The BTX selectivity over ZSM-5-Zn increased slightly with space velocity, contrasting with the decreasing BTX selectivity over ZSM-5-H with increasing space velocity.

2. The main conversion mechanism involves propane dehydrogenation followed by oligomerization and aromatization.

3. ZSM-5-Zn provided better BTX selectivity compared to ZSM-5-H.

4. Concurrent reactions include cracking to Cl-C2 products.

5. The primary dehydrogenation reaction over ZSM-5-Zn differs from that over ZSM-5-H; it is in quasi-equilibrium rather than rate-controlled.

6. Lowering the carbon number of the reactant alkane makes the reaction increasingly difficult.

7. The products from propane over ZSM-5-H resemble those obtained from propylene over ZSM-5-H by a carbenium ion mechanism.

8. The enhanced C2 product formation from propane, especially over ZSM-5-H, indicates a cracking reaction not initiated by isopropylene.

9. Hydrogen affects the propane conversion and BTX content over ZSM-5-Zn, reducing both.

1. 在ZSM-5-Zn上，BTX选择性随空间速度增加略有增加，与ZSM-5-H在增加空间速度时BTX选择性降低形成对比。

2. 主要的转化机制包括丙烷脱氢，随后是聚合和芳构化。

3. ZSM-5-Zn的BTX选择性优于ZSM-5-H。

4. 并行反应包括裂解生成Cl-C2产物。

5. ZSM-5-Zn的主要脱氢反应与ZSM-5-H不同；它处于准平衡状态，而不是速率控制。

6. 降低反应物烷烃的碳数使反应变得越来越困难。

7. 丙烷在ZSM-5-H上的产品类似于从丙烯在ZSM-5-H上获得的产品通过碳正离子机制。

8. 丙烷在ZSM-5-H中的高C2产物形成表明了一种由异丙烯启动的裂解反应。

9. 氢气对ZSM-5-Zn的丙烷转化和BTX含量有影响，两者都减少了。
