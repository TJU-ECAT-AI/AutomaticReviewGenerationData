[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K."

1. The study focused on the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons using ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts, specifically the zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms, at temperatures between 730-820 K.
2. Over ZSM-5-H, the BTX selectivity decreased with increasing space velocity, whereas over ZSM-5-Zn, the BTX selectivity showed a slight increase.
3. The primary conversion mechanism proposed involved propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization.
4. The zinc-exchanged catalysts demonstrated higher activity than their protonated counterparts during propane conversion.
5. The enhanced production of C, and C2 products from propane, especially over ZSM-5-H, indicated the presence of a cracking reaction that did not originate from iso-C3H.
6. The zinc cation in ZSM-5-Zn acted as a hydride acceptor, forming a transient species like [Zn-HI+, contributing to the conversion process.

1. 研究关注了在730-820 K的温度范围内，使用ZSM-5沸石催化剂（特别是锌交换（ZSM-5-Zn）和质子交换（ZSM-5-H）形式）将丙烷转化为芳香烃的转化。
2. 对于ZSM-5-H，在空间速度增加的情况下，BTX选择性下降，而ZSM-5-Zn的情况则略有增加。
3. 提议的主要转化机制涉及丙烷脱氢，随后是多聚化和芳构化。
4. 锌交换催化剂的活性高于其质子化形式，在丙烷转化过程中表现更好。
5. 特别是在ZSM-5-H中，丙烷转化为C,和C2产品的增强表明存在一个不从iso-C3H出发的裂解反应。
6. ZSM-5-Zn中的锌离子作为氢接受体，形成暂态物种如[Zn-HI+，促进了转化过程。
