<p>The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH is a process that converts propane to propylene, which is a key component in the production of polyethylene and other petrochemical products. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, particularly regarding the active Ga species. Recent research has provided insights into the role of gallium in the PDH process, including the identification of active gallium sites within the ZSM-5 zeolite framework. This has led to advancements in catalyst design and optimization for improved propylene yield and selectivity.</p>
