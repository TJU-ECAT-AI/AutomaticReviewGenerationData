[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K."
[2] "Over ZSM-5-H the BTX selectivity decreased with increasing space velocity, while over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX selectivity increased to a small extent."
[3] "The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation,followed by oligomerization and aromatization."
[4] "As indicated in Table 1, the composition of the C2 products was considerably different over ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn in that reaction at a low space velocity over ZSM-5-H gave relatively larger proportions of methane and ethylene."
[5] "The data in Table 1 for the reaction of propane over (non-acidic and zinc-free) silicalite show that if the temperature is high enough (e.g. 909 K), conversion can be substantial."
[6] "We suggest that these effects arise because the respective dehydrogenation steps are in quasi-equilibrium,with reaction 4 controlling the conversion and a dehydrogenation between aromatic and cyclic precursor controlling the BTX selectivity (both processes may well involve species of the type [Zn-HI+,c.f. reaction 4."

The demand for propylene has led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) methods. The study of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, it was believed that the active Ga species played a crucial role in the conversion process. However, recent research has revealed that the zinc cation (Zn) in ZSM-5 zeolite acts as a hydride acceptor, facilitating the conversion of propane. The zinc ion can accept hydride ions to form a transient species such as [Zn-HI+, which aids in the dehydrogenation of propane. This contrasts with the protonic sites in ZSM-5-H zeolite, which directly accept hydrides. The understanding of these catalysts has been refined to recognize the complex interplay between dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and aromatization in the PDH process. The BTX selectivity and the composition of C2 products vary significantly depending on the type of catalyst and the operating conditions, such as space velocity. The zinc-exchanged catalysts (ZSM-5-Zn) exhibit improved BTX selectivity and different product distributions compared to proton-exchanged catalysts (ZSM-5-H). The presence of hydrogen in the system affects the conversion rate and product distribution differently over ZSM-5-Zn and ZSM-5-H catalysts, highlighting the importance of hydrogen scavenging agents in optimizing PDH processes.

对于丙烯的需求推动了丙烷脱氢（PDH）方法的发展。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的研究经历了显著的演变。最初，人们认为活性Ga物种在转化过程中起着关键作用。然而，最近的研究揭示了锌离子（Zn）在ZSM-5沸石中的作用，它作为氢化物接受体，促进了丙烷的转化。锌离子可以接受氢离子形成一种过渡态物种[Zn-HI+，有助于丙烷的脱氢。这与质子化的ZSM-5-H沸石中的质子站点直接接受氢离子形成了对比。对这些催化剂的理解已经细化到认识到脱氢、聚合和芳香化在PDH过程中的复杂相互作用。不同类型的催化剂和操作条件（如空间速度）下，BTX选择性和C2产品的组成存在显著差异。锌交换催化剂（ZSM-5-Zn）在BTX选择性和产品分布方面表现出比质子交换催化剂（ZSM-5-H）更好的性能。系统中氢的存在以不同的方式影响ZSM-5-Zn和ZSM-5-H催化剂的转化率和产品分布，突出了氢捕获剂在优化PDH过程中的重要性。
