Answer: The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process involves converting propane into propylene, which is a crucial component in the petrochemical industry for the production of various plastics and solvents. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. There has been ongoing debate regarding the active Ga species involved in the catalytic process. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge by elucidating the role of specific Ga species and their interaction with the zeolite framework. These findings have helped in optimizing the catalyst performance, enhancing selectivity, and improving the efficiency of PDH reactions.
