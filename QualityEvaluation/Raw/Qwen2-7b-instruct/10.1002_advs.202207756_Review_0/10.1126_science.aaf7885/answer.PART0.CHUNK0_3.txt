[1] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[2] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption (4, 5). This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the fact that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale."
[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction. While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
[4] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions. For instance, h-BN afforded 79% selectivity to propene at 14% propane conversion (Fig. 1A). Meanwhile, the traditional V/SiO2 allows for a modest 61% propene selectivity at only 9% propane conversion (12)."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by creating a gap between demand and supply for propene and other higher olefins. The shift towards using shale gas as a feedstock for steam crackers has increased the availability of ethene but also highlighted the need for on-purpose propene technologies. Among these, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows promise for improving reaction efficiency compared to non-oxidative PDH due to its favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface). However, achieving high propene selectivity remains a challenge. Recent studies have shown that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) can catalyze the ODHP reaction with exceptional selectivity to propene, reaching 79% selectivity at 14% propane conversion, significantly higher than traditional V/SiO2 catalysts.

丙烯的日益增长的需求已经影响了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），因为它在需求和供应之间产生了缺口，特别是在丙烯和其他更高烯烃方面。随着页岩气作为蒸汽裂解装置的原料使用趋势的增长，乙烯的可用性得到了提高，但也揭示了需要专门的丙烯技术。在这些技术中，丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）显示出与非氧化PDH相比，由于其有利的动力学（放热、较低的反应温度）和催化剂稳定性（防止催化剂表面焦炭沉积）的潜力来提高反应效率。然而，实现高丙烯选择性仍然是一个挑战。最近的研究表明，六方氮化硼（h-BN）和氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs）能够催化ODHP反应，表现出对丙烯的极高选择性，在14%丙烷转化率下达到79%的选择性，远高于传统的V/SiO2催化剂。
