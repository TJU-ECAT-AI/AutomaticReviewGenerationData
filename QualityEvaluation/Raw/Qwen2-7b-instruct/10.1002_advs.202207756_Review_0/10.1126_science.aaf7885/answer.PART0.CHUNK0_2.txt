[1] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[2] "This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
[3] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption (4, 5)."
[4] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[5] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts show the most promising activity for ODHP, owing to the favorable redox properties of the active vanadium sites (6, 7)."
[6] "Even after decades of research propene selectivity remains too low, even at moderate propane conversion."
[7] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[8] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes boron nitride materials from supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 1B)."
[9] "The analogous product distributions for both h-BN and BNNTs suggest a similar reaction mechanism for these BN materials."
[10] "Indeed,boron nitride samples from various suppliers, containing different impurities (fig. S5) show almost identical catalytic performance (figs. S6 and S7), which indicates that said metal impurities in the material are unlikely to play a significant role."
[11] "We therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O- N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."
[12] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl-radical site."

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by motivating the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies. The potential energy savings of 45% when transitioning to ODHP highlight its efficiency advantage over traditional methods.

2. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts have shown promise in ODHP due to their favorable redox properties, but despite decades of research, propene selectivity remains insufficiently high, even at moderate propane conversion levels.

3. The use of boron nitride (BN) materials in ODHP reactions results in extraordinarily high propene selectivity, surpassing that of traditional catalysts. The distinct product distribution further emphasizes the unique catalytic properties of BN materials.

4. The reaction mechanism for ODHP using BN materials is characterized by oxygen-terminated armchair edges acting as active sites, capable of performing oxidation reactions and contributing to the high olefin selectivity.

5. The stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl-radical site is considered a significant factor behind the high olefin selectivity observed in ODHP reactions using BN materials.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，新的生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），受到了影响，推动了针对目标丙烯技术的探索。向ODHP过渡的潜在能源节省高达45%，突显了其在传统方法中的效率优势。

2. 支持的钒氧化物催化剂在ODHP中显示出前景，由于它们具有有利的氧化还原性质，但尽管经过几十年的研究，即使在适度的丙烷转化率下，丙烯选择性仍然不足。

3. 在ODHP反应中使用硼氮材料导致了极高的丙烯选择性，超过了传统催化剂。该独特的产物分布进一步强调了BN材料的独特催化特性。

4. 使用BN材料进行ODHP反应的反应机制由BN边缘上的氧终止臂链边缘作为活性位点构成，能够执行氧化反应，并有助于高烯烃选择性。

5. 丙基自由基由硝基基团稳定是观察到高烯烃选择性的一个重要因素，在使用BN材料进行ODHP反应时。
