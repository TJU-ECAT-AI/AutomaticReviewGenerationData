[1] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[2] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[3] "Based upon the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O-N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."
[4] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl-radical site."

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by creating a need for more efficient and selective processes. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, with debates around the active Ga species shifting focus to the role of boron nitride (BN) materials in enhancing selectivity. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge by proposing that an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN acts as the active site for the ODHP reaction, stabilizing propyl radicals and influencing olefin selectivity.
2. The use of BN materials has resulted in exceptional selectivity for propene in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, surpassing traditional catalysts like supported vanadia.
3. An oxygen molecule bonded to one boron and one nitrogen atom (an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN) is proposed to be the active site for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, based on a combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and computational studies.
4. The high olefin selectivity observed in the ODHP process may be largely attributed to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl-radical site, which is associated with the proposed active site on the BN material.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，新的生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），受到了影响，需要更高效、选择性更高的过程。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经显著发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论转向了硼氮（BN）材料在提高选择性方面的作用。近期的研究贡献了当前的知识，提出了BN臂链边缘上一个氧原子连接到一个硼和一个氮原子上的分子作为ODHP反应的活性位点，稳定丙基自由基并影响烯烃选择性。
2. 使用BN材料在氧化脱氢过程中获得了极高的丙烯选择性，超过了传统催化剂如支持的钒。
3. 基于催化活性、光谱数据和计算研究的组合以及观察到的氧气依赖性动力学，提出一个氧原子连接到一个硼和一个氮原子上的分子（BN的臂链边缘上带有氧）是ODHP反应的活性位点。
4. 观察到的高烯烃选择性可能主要归因于与提议的BN材料活性位点相关的氮氧化物基团对丙基自由基的稳定作用。
