[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction."
[2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[3] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption (4, 5)."
[4] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[5] "To date, supported vanadium oxide catalysts show the most promising activity for ODHP, owing to the favorable redox properties of the active vanadium sites (6, 7)."
[6] "However, even after decades of research propene selectivity remains too low, even at moderate propane conversion."
[7] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[8] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes boron nitride materials from supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 1B)."
[9] "We furthermore verified that the catalytic activity of the BN material remains stable for at least 32 hours on stream (fig. S2), validating the catalyst stability."
[10] "Indeed, boron nitride samples from various suppliers, containing different impurities (fig. S5) show almost identical catalytic performance (figs. S6 and S7), which indicates that said metal impurities in the material are unlikely to play a significant role."
[11] "Based upon the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O-N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by highlighting the need for more efficient and selective processes. Traditional PDH technologies, such as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, have emerged as the primary method, offering advantages like lower energy consumption and enhanced catalyst stability. However, the pursuit of more energy-efficient methods has led to the exploration of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which presents opportunities for greater reaction efficiency due to its exothermic nature and lower temperatures. This shift could result in significant energy savings, estimated to be around 45% of the energy consumption, thus impacting the chemical industry's sustainability and cost-effectiveness.

The scientific challenge in ODHP lies in preventing the facile over-oxidation of propene into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2, which is a critical hurdle for commercial viability. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts have shown promise in ODHP due to their favorable redox properties, but achieving high propene selectivity, even at moderate propane conversion levels, remains a challenge. Recent studies highlight the potential of metal-free materials, specifically hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), in enhancing propene selectivity to unprecedented levels, significantly outperforming conventional vanadium-based catalysts. These materials exhibit not only high selectivity but also exceptional stability, making them promising candidates for commercial applications in propene production. The proposed mechanism for the ODHP reaction involves an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN acting as an active site, capable of performing oxidation reactions and contributing to the observed high olefin selectivity. This finding offers a novel perspective on the reaction mechanism and active sites in ODHP, diverging from those found in previously studied catalysts, and provides a foundation for further advancements in the field.

丙烯的不断增长需求已经影响了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），强调了更高效和选择性过程的需求。传统的PDH技术，如非氧化性丙烷脱氢，作为主要方法出现，提供了较低能源消耗和催化剂稳定性等优势。然而，追求更高效的生产方式促使人们探索氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP），这为提高反应效率提供了机会，由于其放热性质和较低温度，这一转变可能带来显著的能源节省，估计约为能源消耗的45%，从而影响化学工业的可持续性和成本效益。

ODHP的科学挑战在于防止丙烯容易过氧化为更热力学稳定的CO和CO2，这是商业可行性的关键障碍。支持的钒氧化物催化剂在ODHP中显示出有希望的活性，得益于它们有利的还原性性质，但即使在适度的丙烷转化率下，高丙烯选择性仍然难以实现。近期研究表明，金属自由材料，特别是六方氮化硼（h-BN）和氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs），在提高丙烯选择性方面具有非凡的潜力，显著超过了传统钒基催化剂。这些材料不仅表现出极高的选择性，而且具有出色的稳定性，使其成为大规模丙烯生产有前景的选择。提出的机制显示，在BN上氧终止的臂状边缘作为活性位点，能够执行氧化反应，并对观察到的高烯烃选择性作出贡献。这一发现为ODHP的反应机制和活性位点提供了一个新颖的视角，与之前研究的催化剂不同，为该领域的进一步发展奠定了基础。
