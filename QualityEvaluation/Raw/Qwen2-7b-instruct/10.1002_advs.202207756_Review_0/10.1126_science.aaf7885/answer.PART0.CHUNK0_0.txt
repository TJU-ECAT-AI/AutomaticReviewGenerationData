[1] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[2] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[3] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes boron nitride materials from supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 1B)."
[4] "Indeed, boron nitride samples from various suppliers, containing different impurities (fig. S5) show almost identical catalytic performance (figs. S6 and S7), which indicates that said metal impurities in the material are unlikely to play a significant role."
[5] "We therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O- N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was a debate about the active Ga species involved in the catalytic process. However, recent research has contributed to a clearer understanding of these catalysts, highlighting the importance of the Ga species in facilitating the PDH reaction. The active Ga species play a crucial role in promoting the dehydrogenation of propane, leading to the formation of propylene. The advancements in catalyst design and characterization techniques have provided insights into the active sites and mechanisms of PDH catalysis, enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The current knowledge of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH includes detailed information on the role of Ga species, the structure of the catalyst, and the optimization strategies for improving the performance of PDH reactors.
