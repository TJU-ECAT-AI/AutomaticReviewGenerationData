The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). A novel catalyst, PtZn encapsulated within an epitaxial high-crystallized zeolite, has been introduced, featuring a low surface barrier. The field's comprehension of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has seen substantial advancements, including discussions on the active Ga species. Recent studies have added to our understanding of these catalysts.
