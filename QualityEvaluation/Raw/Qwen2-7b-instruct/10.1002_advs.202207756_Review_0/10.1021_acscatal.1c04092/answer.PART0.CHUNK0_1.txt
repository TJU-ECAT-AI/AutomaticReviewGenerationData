Answer: The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the search for more efficient and selective catalysts. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, including the ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by elucidating the role of different Ga species in the PDH process and their impact on the catalytic activity and stability. These advancements aim to improve the yield of propylene and reduce energy consumption, thereby enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of PDH processes.
