          "Propylene is an essential industrial intermediate with a gap between supply and anticipated demand."
          "[Tandem catalysis couples multiple reactions and promises to improve chemical processing, but precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates remains elusive.]"
          "[Tandem and cooperative catalysis could revolutionize chemical production (1, 2) by minimizing separations, coupling reactions to drive transformations forward, or controlling selectivity in reaction networks (3).]"
          "[Some complex biomolecular assemblies can pass reactive intermediates sequentially among catalyst sites (11), but heterogeneous catalysts generally do not have the precise positioning of different functions required to do this.]"
          "[In this work, a tandem catalyst was developed for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.]"

          The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly focusing on propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has advanced, with ongoing debates about active Ga species contributing to the evolution of these catalysts. Research has enhanced our knowledge of these catalysts, improving the efficiency and selectivity of propylene production. Tandem catalysis, which combines multiple reactions, holds promise for chemical processing but faces challenges in precisely controlling reactive intermediates in space and time. Tandem and cooperative catalysis could transform chemical production by reducing separations, linking reactions to advance transformations, or managing selectivity in reaction networks. Some complex biomolecular assemblies enable sequential passing of reactive intermediates among catalyst sites, unlike most heterogeneous catalysts which lack the necessary precision for such functions. In this study, a tandem catalyst was created for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, aiming to overcome limitations in PDH and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

          对丙烯的日益增长的需求推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已有所进步，关于活性Ga物种的持续辩论促进了这些催化剂的发展。研究为当前的知识做出了贡献，提高了丙烯生产的效率和选择性。串联催化，结合多个反应，有可能改善化学加工，但面临空间和时间精确控制活性中间体的挑战。串联和协同催化有可能通过减少分离、链接反应推进转换或管理反应网络中的选择性来彻底改变化学生产。一些复杂的生物分子组装体能够在催化剂位点之间顺序传递活性中间体，而大多数异质催化剂缺乏执行此类功能所需的精确度。在此研究中，创建了一个串联催化剂用于选择性催化丙烷脱氢到丙烯，旨在克服PDH和丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的局限性。

          "Overcoming propylene oxidation"
          "Significantly, the overcoated tandem catalyst outperformed state-of-the-art ODHP catalysts (table S1 and fig S15), and yields also exceeded the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion of 24% for nonoxidative PDH."
          "Other nanostructures, including platinum on In2O3 or platinum mixed with In2O3, favor propane combustion because they cannot organize the reactions sequentially."
          "The tandem catalyst boosts propylene yields to up to 30% and maintains high stability, surpassing state-of-the-art ODHP catalysts."

          Efforts to overcome the oxidation of propylene have been pivotal in advancing the development of new production methods, particularly focusing on propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Recent findings indicate that the overcoated tandem catalyst significantly outperforms state-of-the-art oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) catalysts, surpassing the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion of 24% for nonoxidative PDH. Other nanostructures, such as those containing platinum on In2O3 or mixed with In2O3, favor propane combustion due to their inability to organize reactions sequentially. This tandem catalyst design enables the sequential coupling of dehydrogenation and combustion, resulting in a boost of up to 30% in propylene yields while maintaining high stability, surpassing the performance of contemporary ODHP catalysts.

          努力克服丙烯氧化在推动新生产方法的发展方面起到了关键作用，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）领域。最新发现显示，过涂覆串联催化剂显著优于最先进的氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）催化剂，超过非氧化性PDH的热力学平衡转化率24%。其他纳米结构，例如包含铂在In2O3上的或混合在In2O3中的，有利于丙烷燃烧，因为它们不能按顺序组织反应。这种串联催化剂设计允许脱氢和燃烧的顺序耦合，从而在保持高稳定性的前提下将丙烯产率提升至最高30%，超越了当前ODHP催化剂的性能。
