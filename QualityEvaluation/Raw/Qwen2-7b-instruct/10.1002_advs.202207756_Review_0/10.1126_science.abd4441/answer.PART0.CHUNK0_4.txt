1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by highlighting the need for more efficient and selective processes. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with debates around active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to current knowledge by focusing on catalyst design and operational parameters to enhance selectivity and yield.

2. The tandem catalyst for propane dehydrogenation to propylene integrates a PDH catalyst (Pt/Al2O3) and a selective H2 combustion catalyst (In2O3) through atomic layer deposition. The In2O3 overcoat exposes the Pt nanoparticles for dehydrogenation while enabling selective hydrogen combustion at the interface, leading to high propylene yields and stability.

3. The tandem catalyst design allows for the coupling of multiple reactions, addressing the limitations of PDH and ODHP. It balances activity on the Pt surface and selectivity on the In2O3 phase, demonstrating potential for highly selective catalytic performance in grand challenge reactions.

4. The optimal tandem catalyst composition includes 35 cycles of In2O3 deposition, achieving a selectivity of 75% at 40% conversion at 450°C. This configuration ensures both high yield and stability, surpassing state-of-the-art ODHP catalysts.

5. Further improvements and examples of tandem catalysts can be expected through optimization of process conditions and independent tuning of the identities and amounts of dehydrogenation and SHC sites, aiming to enhance performance and efficiency in industrial applications.
