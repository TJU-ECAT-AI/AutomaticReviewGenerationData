The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly focusing on propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. There is an ongoing debate about the active Ga species, which has been crucial for improving the efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, enhancing the ability to produce propylene more efficiently and sustainably.

The tandem catalyst developed in this study uses an indium oxide (In2O3) coating over a platinum (Pt)/alumina (Al2O3) catalyst for the coupling of propane dehydrogenation to selective hydrogen combustion. This innovative design allows for a balance between activity on the Pt surface and selectivity on the In2O3 surface, leading to biomimetic, direct transfer of reactive intermediates between two different catalyst functions. The results show that the overcoated tandem catalyst outperforms state-of-the-art oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) catalysts, surpassing the equilibrium conversion for nonoxidative PDH.

对于丙烯的日益增长的需求，已经推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已显著发展。关于活性Ga物种的争论对提高这些催化剂的效率和选择性至关重要。最近的研究为当前对这些催化剂的了解做出了贡献，提高了更高效、更可持续地生产丙烯的能力。

这项研究中开发的串联催化剂使用了氧化铟（In2O3）涂层覆盖铂（Pt）/氧化铝（Al2O3）催化剂，以耦合丙烷脱氢到选择性氢燃烧。这种创新设计允许在Pt表面和In2O3表面之间实现活动与选择性的平衡，导致生物模拟，直接将反应中间体从两种不同的催化剂功能转移。结果显示，过涂覆串联催化剂超越了最先进的氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）催化剂，超过了非氧化性PDH的平衡转化率。
