[Tandem catalysis couples multiple reactions and promises to improve chemical processing, but precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates remains elusive.]
[Tandem and cooperative catalysis could revolutionize chemical production (1, 2) by minimizing separations, coupling reactions to drive transformations forward, or controlling selectivity in reaction networks (3).]
[Some complex biomolecular assemblies can pass reactive intermediates sequentially among catalyst sites (11), but heterogeneous catalysts generally do not have the precise positioning of different functions required to do this.]
[In this work, a tandem catalyst was developed for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.]
[Other nanostructures, including platinum on In2O3 or platinum mixed with In2O3, favor propane combustion because they cannot organize the reactions sequentially.]
[The overcoat also stabilizes Pt nanoparticles against aggregation during reaction.]

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, including debates about active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by elucidating the mechanisms and interactions within the catalyst structure.
