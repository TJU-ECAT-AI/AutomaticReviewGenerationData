Tandem In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling of propane dehydrogenation to selective H2 combustion Overcoming propylene oxidation Catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and water become less selective with increasing conversion because propylene itself is more readily oxidized than propane.
Yan et al. created nanoscale tandem catalysts by growing an 2-nanometer shell of indium oxide, a selective hydrogen combustion catalyst, over a propane dehydrogenation catalyst, platinum nanoparticles supported on alumina spheres.
This overcoat exposed the platinum nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation. Surface hydrogen atoms were oxidized at the indium oxideplatinum interface. This approach boosted yields of propylene to up to 30%.
Other nanostructures, including platinum on In2O3 or platinum mixed with In2O3, favor propane combustion because they cannot organize the reactions sequentially.
The net effect is rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high per-pass yields exceeding the PDH equilibrium.
Tandem catalysis using this nanoscale overcoating geometry is validated as an opportunity for highly selective catalytic performance in a grand challenge reaction.

Answer: This study introduces a tandem catalyst that combines a selective hydrogen combustion catalyst (In2O3) with a propane dehydrogenation catalyst (Pt/Al2O3). By applying atomic layer deposition, an In2O3 shell is grown over the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, enabling the sequential reactions of propane dehydrogenation and selective hydrogen combustion. This design boosts propylene yields up to 30% and maintains high selectivity. The tandem catalyst overcomes the issue of decreasing selectivity in traditional oxidative dehydrogenation processes, providing a potential solution for selective catalytic performance in challenging reactions like the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
