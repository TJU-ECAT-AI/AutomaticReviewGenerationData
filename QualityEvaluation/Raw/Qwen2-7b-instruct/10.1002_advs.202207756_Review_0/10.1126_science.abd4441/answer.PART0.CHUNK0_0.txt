Tandem In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling of propane dehydrogenation to selective H2 combustion Overcoming propylene oxidation Catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and water become less selective with increasing conversion because propylene itself is more readily oxidized than propane. Yan et al. created nanoscale tandem catalysts by growing an 2-nanometer shell of indium oxide, a selective hydrogen combustion catalyst, over a propane dehydrogenation catalyst, platinum nanoparticles supported on alumina spheres (see the Perspective by Pei and Gong). This overcoat exposed the platinum nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation. Surface hydrogen atoms were oxidized at the indium oxideplatinum interface. This approach boosted yields of propylene to up to 30%.

This literature discusses the development of a tandem catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, focusing on overcoming the issue of propylene oxidation. It introduces a method where an indium oxide (In2O3) layer, selective for hydrogen combustion, is grown over a platinum (Pt)/alumina (Al2O3) catalyst, which is effective for propane dehydrogenation. The In2O3 layer exposes the Pt nanoparticles for dehydrogenation while oxidizing surface hydrogen atoms at the interface. This approach increases the yield of propylene to up to 30%.
