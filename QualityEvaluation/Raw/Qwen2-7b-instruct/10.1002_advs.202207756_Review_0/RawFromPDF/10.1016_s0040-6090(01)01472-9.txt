pre-adsorbed hydrogen results, in all cases, in a bathochromic shift of the v(Zn–H) band and a hypsochromic shift of the v(O–
H) band, which originally appear at 1710 and 3492 cm
, respectively. The magnitude of these shifts depends upon the nature

1. Introduction
Stoichiometric zinc oxide has the band structure
typical of an insulator material; the fully occupied 2s
and 2p orbitals of the O
ion constitute the valence
2y
band, while the empty 4s orbitals of Zn
give rise to
2q
the conduction band. When excess zinc atoms are
present, which often happens, ZnO becomes an n-type
semiconductor. When prepared in a relatively high-
surface-area form, zinc oxide finds important applica-
tions in heterogeneous catalysis and in gas-sensor
technology. Chemical processes for which ZnO can act
as a main catalyst component include the water–gas
shift reaction w1x, methanol synthesis w2x, olefin hydro-
genation w3x and oxidation of methane to formaldehyde
w4x.
Surface phenomena responsible for catalytic activity
and gas sensing ability of ZnO stem from a combination
of factors which include the presence of acid (Zn
)
2q
and basic (O
) surface sites, the variety of exposed

crystal faces (and structures), and the possibility of
electron transfer from the adsorbent to the adsorbate or
vice-versa. These features give rise to a complex surface
chemistry which remains poorly understood, despite a
large number of studies devoted to the adsorption of
both single gases w5–15x and binary mixtures w16–18x
on ZnO.
Some of the difficulties in interpreting literature data
concerning chemisorption on polycrystalline zinc oxide
stem from a poor characterization of surface morpholo-
gy. It was the aim of this work to carry out a detailed
FTIR study on the adsorption and co-adsorption of
several gases on well characterized ZnO microcrystals.
First, dihydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane were
individually considered. Secondly, binary mixtures of
these gases were investigated in order to gain further
knowledge on the nature of adsorption sites and on
lateral interactions between co-adsorbates.
2. Experimental
The zinc oxide sample used was Kadox 25 (New
Jersey Zinc Co.) obtained by combustion of zinc metal;

it had a surface area of 10 m g
, as determined by
2
y1
nitrogen adsorption at 77 K (BET method). High reso-
lution electron microscopy (HRTEM) was used to char-
acterize crystal morphology. For infrared studies, thin
self-supported wafers of ZnO were prepared and acti-
vated by outgassing at 773 K for 1 h under a dynamic
vacuum (residual pressure 10
torr) inside an IR cell
y4
which also allowed gas dosage and low temperature IR
measurements to be carried out. In order to compensate
for oxygen lost during thermal activation of the wafers,
at the end of the activation period, 20 torr of oxygen
was dosed into the cell (still at 773 K), the sample was
then cooled to room temperature and oxygen outgassed
to a final pressure of 10
torr. Transmission IR spectra
y4
were recorded by using a Bruker IFS 28 spectrometer
working at 2 cm
resolution.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Sample morphology
Electron micrographs have shown that ZnO crystal-
lites were prevalently hexagonal single crystals, elon-
gated along the c-axis. An example is shown in Fig. 1,
and further details were given elsewhere w12,14x. Indi-
vidual crystals had typical dimensions of 30–60 nm
wide and 150–300 nm long, which is consistent with
the measured surface area of 10 m g
. These crystals
2
y1
expose mainly the non-polar (1010) and (1120) faces
of the wurtzite-type structure and have a high degree of
perfection (Fig. 1) although kinks and steps do exist,
mainly at rounded crystal ends.
3.2. FTIR spectra of adsorbed hydrogen
Fig. 2 shows the FTIR spectra obtained after adsorp-
tion of dihydrogen, at 77 K and increasing coverage, on
ZnO. These spectra, which depict the characteristic
features already reported in the literature w3,9,19,20x,
are shown here with the main purpose of facilitating
understanding of co-adsorption experiments. Briefly the
spectra in Fig. 2 show, at the lowest coverage, two IR
adsorption bands at 1710 and at 3492 cm
which
y1
correspond, respectively, to the fundamental stretching
vibration of hydride (Zn–H) and hydroxyl (O–H) sur-
face species formed upon dissociative chemisorption of
the dihydrogen molecule on adjacent Zn
O
ion pairs,
2q
2y
which act as a Lewis acid-base couple. When coverage
is increased, n(ZnH) decreases down to 1690 cmy1
while n(OH) increases up to 3512 cm
. This coverage-
y1
dependent frequency shift of the Zn–H and O–H stretch-
ing bands was explained by Griffin and Yates w9x in
terms of a combination of lateral interactions among
neighbouring adsorbates and through solid-inductive
effects.
We only remark that frequency shifts take place in
discrete steps (Fig. 2). This fact supports the model of
Tsyganenko et al. w21x which considers discrete geo-
metrical arrangements of neighbouring adsorbates on an

, is stepwise shifted to higher wavenumbers

upon adsorption of molecular hydrogen. Simultaneously, the Zn–H band (1710 cm
) is displaced towards lower wavenumbers.

extended wurtzite-type (1010) face, the structure of
which has been discussed in detail by Duke w22x.
3.3. FTIR spectra of adsorbed CO
Fig. 3 shows the IR spectra of CO adsorbed, at 77 K
and increasing equilibrium pressure, on ZnO. At the
lowest coverage a single band is observed at 2190
cm
. In agreement with previous reports w14,15,17x,
y1
this band is assigned to the fundamental C–O stretching
mode of Zn
–CO adducts. The upward shift of 47
2q
cm
in relation to the free CO (2143 cm
) should be
y1
y1
assigned mainly to the vibrational Stark effect induced
in the CO molecule by the (axial) electric field created
by the Zn
ion w23x. However, a contribution from s-
2q
donation from the 5s molecular orbital of CO to the
cation is also likely to exist, as suggested from ultravi-
olet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements w8,24x.
It should be noted that the asymmetry and broadness
of the 2190 cm
band can be explained in terms of
y1
CO adsorption on Zn
ions belonging to both (1010)
2q
and (1120) faces, which have a slightly different con-
figuration of coordinatively-unsatured cations w22x.
When CO equilibrium pressure is increased, the 2190
cm
band undergoes a bathochromic shift down to
y1
2168 cm
. Similarly to the case of adsorbed hydrogen,
y1
several discrete bands can be observed in the 2190–
2168 cm
range; they should correspond to different
y1
arrangements of neighbouring adsorbed CO molecules,
which are related to surface coverage, and which give

rise to resultant lateral interaction effects of different
magnitude w21,25x. Further details on this subject can
be found elsewhere w14x. Note also that for high cover-
age two minor peaks (marked with asterisks in Fig. 3)
are seen at approximately 2180 and 2185 cm
. We
y1
tentatively assign these peaks to the C–O stretching of
Zn
–CO adducts formed near edges of extended pris-
2q
matic faces; such adducts would have a reduced number
of neighbours, and hence they would be less influenced
by lateral interactions.
3.4. FTIR spectra of adsorbed methane
Fig. 4 shows that, at a low equilibrium pressure,
adsorbed methane gives IR adsorption bands at 2989,
2872 and 1308 cm
. The 2989 cm
band is assigned
y1
y1
to the n (antisymmetric) C–H stretching mode, which
3
appears at 3020 cm
in free CH . The 2872 cm
y1
y1
4
band correspond to the n (symmetric) stretching mode,
1
which is IR-inactive for free CH
(2914 cm
) and
y1
4
becomes activated in the perturbed (adsorbed) molecule.

before, and (2) after methane adsorption.
The band at 1308 cm
is assigned to the n bending
y1
4
mode, which has a free molecule value of d(CH) s
1302 cm
. It is clear that adsorption lowers the CH
y1
4
point group symmetry from T
to C , which renders
d
3v
IR-active the n mode, and brings about discrete batho-
1
cromic shifts of the C–H stretching modes and a small
hypsochromic shift of the n bending mode. These facts
4
suggest that methane is molecularly adsorbed, forming
H CH–Zn
adducts
with
coordinatively
unsatured
2q
3
Zn
ions. Further evidence comes from the COyCH
2q
4
co-adsorption studies discussed below.
At relatively high equilibrium pressure, additional IR
adsorption peaks develop at 3000 and 2900 cm
. These
y1
peaks are assigned to weakly perturbed (physisorbed)
methane: n and n modes, respectively.

3.5. Studies on co-adsorbed gases
When CO was dosed (at 77 K) on ZnO having pre-
adsorbed methane, the characteristic bands of adsorbed
CH (Section 3.4) were found to disappear. Fig. 5 shows
4
that the only IR adsorption bands remaining after CO
adsorption are a sharp peak at 2168 cm
, which
y1
corresponds to adsorbed CO, and the characteristic bands
of free methane at 3020 (n ) and at 1302 cm
(n ); it
y1
3
4
is thus shown that CO displaces CH from its adsorption
4
sites. Since CO is known to form surface adducts with
Zn
(Section 3.3) but not with O
ions, this experi-
2q
2y
ment proves that Zn
ions are the adsorption sites for
2q
methane, hence giving support to the surface adduct
structure proposed in Section 3.4. Note that O
ions
2y
could not be discarded beforehand as possible adsorption
sites for methane.
Fig. 6 shows the effect of increasing doses of meth-
ane, at 77 K, on the n(ZnH) and n(OH) bands formed
after pre-adsorption of hydrogen on ZnO. The n(ZnH)
band, originally at 1710 cm
shifts step-wise to 1696
y1
cm
upon adsorption of CH . Simultaneously, the
y1
4
n(OH) band undergoes a hypsochromic shift from the
initial value of 3492 up to 3499 cm
. These shifts
y1
parallel those observed when dihydrogen was dosed on
ZnO containing hydride and hydroxyl groups (Section
3.2). Note, however, that the magnitude of the maximum
shifts is smaller in the case of co-adsorbed methane.
Carbon monoxide, and ethylene, were also dosed on
zinc oxide having pre-adsorbed hydrogen (spectra not
shown). CO was found to cause a maximum shift of y
68 cm
in the n(ZnH) band and of q32 cm
in the
y1
y1
n(OH) band. In the case of ethylene corresponding
shifts were y67 and q42 cm
, respectively.
y1
The whole set of results proves that dissociative
chemisorption of hydrogen affects only a small portion
of sites available for coordination of other adsorbed
molecules. Progressive occupation of the remaining sites
by co-adsorbates gives rise to several coverage-depend-
ent arrangement of co-adsorbed phases; as a result of
lateral
and
through-solid
interactions, n(ZnH) and
n(OH) modes are thus affected to a extent which
depends on surface coverage and on the chemical nature
of the co-adsorbed phase. Further details will be given
elsewhere w26x.
