Abstract. The catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane may occur via dry reforming to produce 
syngas (CO + H2) or oxidative dehydrogenation to yield propylene. Utilizing propane and CO2 
as co-reactants presents several advantages over conventional methane dry reforming or direct 
propane dehydrogenation, including lower operating temperatures and less coke formation. 
Thus, it is of great interest to identify catalytic systems that can either effectively break the C-C 
bond to generate syngas or selectively break C-H bonds to produce propylene. In this study, 
several precious and non-precious bimetallic catalysts supported on reducible CeO2 were 
investigated using flow reactor studies at 823 K to identify selective catalysts for CO2-assisted 
reforming and dehydrogenation of propane.

Introduction  
Carbon dioxide management is a prominent issue facing society that requires a diverse 
portfolio of innovative technologies. High atmospheric concentrations of CO2 contribute to 
adverse effects that impact human health and the climate. The need to reduce CO2 is evident, and 
the International Panel on Climate Change has stated that climate stabilization (no more than a 
2oC rise from pre-industrial levels) will require a combination of mitigation, utilization, and even

negative emission technologies.1 Thus, one key approach will be to transform abundant CO2 into 
a useful feedstock for processes that not only produce high value products but also match the 
scale necessary to impact anthropogenic emissions.  
The two most relevant reactions for the catalytic conversion of CO2 to CO are reverse 
water gas shift (RWGS) and dry reforming of methane (DRM). The CO product can be utilized 
as feedstock for Fischer-Tropsch reactions or methanol synthesis. These two reduction 
chemistries are not without obstacles, beginning with the challenge that CO2 is the most 
thermodynamically stable carbon/oxygen-based molecule (∆GF = -394 kJ mol-1).2 Current 
implementation of RWGS has limited feasibility since efforts to obtain large amounts of 
renewable and CO2-free hydrogen are still under development.3 Furthermore, high coke 
deposition rates at the reaction temperatures required for DRM hinders further significant 
improvements in catalyst stability.4,5   
A viable alternative is to utilize other light hydrocarbons, such as ethane or propane, as 
feedstock for CO2 reduction. In addition to reforming, these light alkanes contain the C-C bond 
that can be advantageously utilized to build olefins.6 Thus, the reduction of CO2 via light alkanes 
offers two distinct reaction pathways: dry reforming and oxidative dehydrogenation. 
Specifically, it is of interest to explore the use of propane due to its increasing abundance, 
competitive pricing, and the demand for propylene, which is one of the most diverse 
petrochemical building blocks used in the production of various chemicals such as fibers and 
textiles for a variety of applications. Currently, propylene is primarily co-produced by steam

cracking of naphtha and fluidized cracking of both heavy and light oil. Recently, the cracking of 
lighter feeds has caused a significant gap in propylene production.7 As the demand for propylene 
increases globally so does the need for more economic on-purpose propylene production 
processes. 
The primary reactions of CO2 + C3H8 include the dry reforming of propane (DRP) and 
CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), both can occur 
simultaneously at temperatures above 823 K, Eqs. 1 and 2, respectively. 
  
Other relevant reactions include propane decomposition (or cracking) to carbon, H2, and CH4 [Eq. 
3], the reverse Boudouard reaction [Eq. 4], the RWGS reaction [Eq. 5], and direct 
dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) [Eq. 6] as listed below. 
 
 
The DRP reaction reaches 50% equilibrium conversion at a temperature of 150 K lower than that 
of DRM and results in a H2:CO ratio of 2.3. The CO2-ODHP has several thermodynamic 
advantages over DDP or even O2-assisted dehydrogenation (O2-ODHP).8 The equilibrium

conversion of the DDP reaction is limited by the high H2 partial pressure, which shifts the 
reaction to the reverse direction, but CO2 can help consume the produced H2 via the RWGS and 
increase olefin yield in CO2-ODHP. The RWGS coupled with CO2 assisted abstraction of H 
from propane should decrease the Gibbs free energy of the overall reaction and potentially allow 
a reduction in operating temperatures.9 In addition, CO2 is a mild oxidant and can suppress over-
oxidation to increase olefin yield. Among one of the key differences between CO2-ODHP and 
O2-ODHP is the overall net reduction of CO2 in the former and possible emission of 
anthropogenic CO2 in the latter. Coke formation is expected for reactions that involve allylic 
hydrogens. CO2 can help stabilize the catalyst by consuming coke via the reverse Boudouard 
reaction, which has been reported to occur at temperatures as low as 773 K.10,11 Overall, these 
thermodynamic benefits allow for milder reaction conditions, thus increasing the opportunity to 
develop active, selective, and more stable catalytic systems. 
At present the CO2-ODHP efforts focus primarily on chromium-based catalysts supported 
on zeolites, mesoporous silica, and metal oxides.12 The activation of CO2 for chromium-based 
catalysts is typically attributed to a Cr6+ active center generated from a redox cycle with 
Cr3+.13,14,15,16 Increased alkane conversion is observed with high Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios, but there is a 
maximum amount of Cr6+ that can be added until no further improvement is observed. For 
example, on the SBA support the maximum loading is 4.3 wt.% of Cr6+.13,17 While Cr-based 
catalysts show high initial conversion and selectivity, their implementation is limited due to short 
lifecycles and high toxicity. Other metal modified zeolites tested for dehydrogenation include the

Pt-Sn/HZSM-5 catalysts, which have only been shown to work in the absence of CO2. For the 
DRP reaction, initial focus centered on precious metal catalysts18,19,20 and later extended to Ni-
based catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 or Mg hydrotalcite-derived catalysts.21,22,23 The Ni-based 
DRP catalysts exhibit instability and deactivate due to coke formation.  
Due to the lack of studies investigating both reaction pathways simultaneously over 
bimetallic catalysts, there is little understanding regarding which catalytic systems can 
effectively break the C-H bond to produce propylene or break the C-C bond to produce 
reforming products. In the present study, we investigated bimetallic catalysts composed of 
precious (Pt or Pd) with non-precious metals (Fe, Co, or Ni), as well as combinations of non-
precious metals, all supported on CeO2 for the reactions of CO2 + C3H8 at 823 K. CeO2 is a 
readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+ and is  well 
known for oxygen exchange properties that are critical for CO2 activation.24,25,26,27 
Experimental  
Catalyst preparation  
The catalysts evaluated in this study were synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation 
of metals onto commercially obtained CeO2 (35-45 m2/g Sigma-Aldrich). The active metal 
precursors 
Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2, 
Pd(NO3)2∙2H2O, 
Fe(NO3)3∙9H2O, 
Ni(NO3)2∙6H2O, 
and 
Co(NO3)2∙6H2O (Alfa Aesar) were dissolved in a volume of water equivalent to 90% of the pore 
volume of the CeO2 support. The pore volume was determined from an aliquot sample of 
support. The salt solutions were added dropwise to the support and subsequently mixed.

Bimetallic catalysts were synthesized via co-impregnation. Catalysts were then dried at 363 K 
for 6 hours to remove water and allow the metal salt to crystallize on the pores and pore surface. 
Once dried, the catalysts were calcined in air at 563 K for 2 hours with a 0.8 K/min ramp rate.  
Catalysts were synthesized by atomic ratios corresponding to a 1.67 wt.% Pt1 basis for 
consistency with previous investigations of other bimetallic catalysts in our group and to 
maximize bimetallic bond formation.28 A summary of in situ EXAFS measurements providing 
structural information on Pt-Ni, Pd-Ni, and Pt-Co from previous CO2 reduction studies is 
available in Table S1 and demonstrates the presence of bimetallic bonds in these catalysts. 
For bimetallic synthesis, Pt (1.67 wt.%) was replaced with another metal with an 
equivalent atomic concentration. For example, in the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst, Ni1 replaced Pt and 
then the Fe loading was calculated such that for every atom of Ni there were 3 atoms of Fe, see 
Table 1 for metal loading wt.%. An example calculation is shown below: 
Example using 1.67 wt.% Pt as a reference:  
 
𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 % 𝑜𝑓 𝑁𝑖1 = 
1.67
𝑀𝑊 𝑜𝑓 𝑃𝑡 × 𝑀𝑊 𝑜𝑓 𝑁𝑖= 0.5   
Thus, to obtain an equivalent amount of atomic concentration corresponding to 1.67 wt.% Pt, the 
Ni loading was 0.5 wt.%. If the catalyst was to have 3 atoms of Fe for every atom of Ni, then the 
Fe wt.% loading would be 1.43 wt.% and the assigned nomenclature would be Fe3. However, if 
Fe were to be the metal replacing Pt1 then the wt.% would be 0.48% and the nomenclature would 
be Fe1. For this investigation metal loadings, calcination, and drying treatment conditions were 
consistent with previous studies.29,30 ,31

Particle size distributions from TEM images of freshly synthesized Ni3Pt1/CeO2, 
Ni3Pd1/CeO2, and Co3Pt1/CeO2 were previously reported by our group to be 1.7, 2.4, and 1.3 nm, 
respectively.32  However, it is very challenging to obtain a reliable particle size distribution for 
several of the other evaluated catalysts using TEM because of the low contrast of 3d elements 
(Fe, Co, and Ni) over the CeO2 support. In situ XRD measurements performed on Fe3Ni1/CeO2 
in a previous investigation did not show any diffraction patterns due to metal particles, 
suggesting that the particles of Fe3Ni1 should be finely dispersed and most likely under 2 nm in 
size.29  
Effective catalysts for CO2-ODHP and DRP require the ability to activate CO2 on the 
metal oxide support and/or at the interfacial sites. CeO2 has the ability to accommodate high 
oxygen vacancy concentrations without a change in crystallographic structure even at high 
temperatures. Effective CO2 adsorption on a ceria surface is structure dependent and the 
adsorption configurations dictate the mechanism and energetics of CO2 reduction. The 
adsorption process itself can weaken the C-O bond, but the vacancy geometry determines if CO2 
would fill the vacancy. Cheng et al. performed DFT calculations regarding the adsorption of CO2 
on a CeO2(111) surface and reported that parallel adsorption on a bridge between two Ce atoms 
adjacent to the vacancy provides a favorable angle that allows CO2 to occupy an oxygen vacancy 
on CeO2.33 Winter et al. demonstrated with isotope-labeled C18
O2 that the oxygen exchange 
between bulk CeO2 and gas phase CO2 readily occurs during the reaction of CO2 + H2.34  Apart 
from CO2 filling vacancies or providing lattice oxygen, the exchange over CeO2 can also provide

lattice oxygen for coke suppression. From previous synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments 
we have confirmed that the CeO2 support is crystalline and approximately 33 nm in size.35 In 
addition, under reaction conditions for the reduction of CO2 with ethane the CeO2 lattice has 
been shown to undergo abrupt expansions indicating an increase of the average Ce-O bond 
length due to the partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+.36,35 The BET surface area of the support has 
been reported by our group to be 49.1 m2·g-1 while the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst has a surface area of 
44.5 m2·g-1. 27 
Flow reactor studies 
Flow reactor studies were conducted at 823 K and atmospheric pressure utilizing a 6.35 
mm quartz U-tube shaped reactor. All catalysts were reduced at 723 K for 1 hour under 1:1 
H2/Ar flow (40mL/min total). After catalyst pretreatment, the temperature was increased to (6.5 
K/min) and held at 823 K in the presence of 1:1:2 CO2, C3H8, and Ar for over 12 hours. Reactor 
effluent was analyzed on stream utilizing an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (GC) equipped 
with a flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Ar was used as 
the inert internal standard to calculate the total flow rate of reactants and products.  Conversion 
(X) was defined as the rate of reactant fed initially into the reactor minus the rate of 
disappearance of the reactant over the initial rate:

To effectively compare different catalysts, the turnover frequency (TOF) value accounts for the 
available active sites determined by CO chemisorption, and was defined as: 
 where, Finlet reactant (mol∙min-1) and X are the flow rate and conversion of a given reactant, 
respectively, UCO is the CO uptake value in mol CO∙g-1, and W is the mass of catalyst used in g. 
Since the amount of hydrogen produced for catalysts with low activity is near the lowest 
detection limit of the GC, the selectivity was defined on a C3H8 basis for consistency:  
  
The CO2-ODHP activity was based on the amount of propylene produced, while reforming 
activity was based on the amount of CO produced from 1 mol of C3H8, and cracking was based 
on the sum of the total methane, ethane, and ethylene produced. The amount of CO produced 
from C3H8 was calculated via the oxygen balance since all the oxygen in CO and H2O comes 
from CO2. Thus, the CO selectivity was defined as: 
 
It can be assumed that over-oxidation is included in reforming because all the olefins, lighter 
components, and C(s) were produced from C3H8 and are then oxidized by CO2 to finally produce 
CO. Among one of the fundamental differences between CO2-ODHP and conventional oxidative

Kinetic measurements 
Apparent activation energy and reaction order experiments were conducted at slightly 
different reaction conditions to ensure operation in a true intrinsic kinetic regime and minimize 
transport effects. The reaction conditions for kinetic experiments adopted in the present work 
were chosen based on our previous work (Xie, et al. Appl. Catal. B: Environ., 245: 376-388, 
2019), in which operation in a truly intrinsic kinetic regime free of heat and transport limitations 
was validated by both experimental approaches (e.g., intra- and inter- particle dilution) and 
numerical criteria (e.g., Weisz-Prater criterion).27 For catalysts that exhibit high steady state 
conversions the kinetic measurements were performed with approximately 100 mg of diluted 
(1:5 SiO2) and sieved catalyst (40-60 mesh) with enough treated acid-purified granulated quartz 
(calcined at 1173 K, ≤ 80 mesh) to maintain a constant isothermal length and to achieve ≤10% 
conversion. Kinetic experiments underwent the same pretreatment as steady state experiments 
but were only held for 8-9 hours. Then, temperature or gas flow was altered. Deactivation extents

were measured by revisiting the steady state treatment conditions after finishing kinetic 
experiments at different temperature or partial pressure. 
Pulse CO Chemisorption  
To quantitatively compare the number of active sites in each catalyst and calculate the 
TOF values, pulse CO chemisorption was performed. Experiments were conducted using an 
AMI-300ip characterization instrument. Samples were prepared for chemisorption by loading 
100 mg of fresh catalyst into a quartz U-tube. The sample was then dried at 393 K for 30 minutes 
with a He flow of 50 mL/min. Once dried, the catalyst was reduced in the presence of 10% H2/Ar 
mixture (30 mL/min total) with a heating rate of 10 K/min from 323 K to 723 K and held for 40 
minutes. Reduced samples were then flushed with 50 mL/min of He at 723 K for 20 minutes and 
allowed to cool to 313 K. Pulses of 10% CO/He (590 μL loop) were passed through the sample. 
A TCD was used to analyze the amount of gas exiting the bed. The amount of gas adsorbed on 
the sample was the difference between the amount injected and the amount exiting the bed that 
was not adsorbed. CO chemisorption results are listed in Table 2.  
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) 
TGA experiments were conducted using a TA Instrument 8500. Approximately 15 mg of 
spent catalyst was subjected to a drying program that began at room temperature and increased to 
473K with a 15 K/min ramp rate. Temperature was held for 45 minutes in the presence of Ar (40 
mL/min). Then, the temperature was ramped to 1273 K (10 K/min) in the presence of O2/Ar (20 
mL/min each).

In situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy 
In situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements for the Fe K edge 
(7112 eV), Ni K edge (8333 eV), Co K edge (7709 eV), and Pd K edge (24350 eV) were 
collected at the Beamline 9-BM of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National 
Laboratory. For each experiment, ~200 mg of sieved sample (60-80 mesh) was loaded into a 
custom Cu microchannel cell and held in place with graphite paper, as described previously.36 
Using similar procedures as flow reactor experiments, the catalysts were first reduced in a 50/50 
mixture of Ar and He at 723 K for 60 minutes. After reduction, the temperature was increased to 
823 K and data collection began after the catalyst had been in contact with reaction gasses and at 
temperature for 10 minutes. Collecting the fluorescence or transmission signal of 3d metals, 
especially those of low loading (Table 1) on a support composed by high Z element (CeO2 in our 
system) usually results in relatively weak signals, due to the strong absorption of the oxide 
support as well as the relatively strong absorption of window materials at low energy edges. To 
improve the signal, data were collected using a vortex detector that provided higher 3d metal 
counts and lowered the interference from Ce. Three spectra for each edge were collected in 
fluorescence mode. XANES spectra were analyzed using the Athena software package with the 
appropriate metal foil and powder oxide as references.

Results and Discussion 
Catalytic evaluation 
Table 2 summarizes the activity of the CeO2 supported bimetallic catalysts. For 
comparison, the results of Fe3Pt1, Fe3Ni1, and Ni3Pt1 from a previous publication29, are also 
provided in Table 2.  Conversions following time on stream for various catalysts are available in 
Figure S1. The conversion and selectivity of Cu-based catalysts with Pt1, Pd1, Ni3, and Co3, as 
well as Ni and Co combinations with Mo, are available in Table S2.  
Bimetallic catalysts of precious (Pt and Pd) and non-precious (Fe, Co, and Ni) metals 
Bimetallic catalysts often show distinct electronic and chemical properties compared to 
their parent metals, providing an opportunity to design catalysts with improved activity, 
selectivity, and stability.37 Among the Pt and Pd based catalysts with Fe3, Co3, and Ni3 an 
improvement in both conversion and stability compared to the respective parent monometallics 
was observed for Co3Pd1, Co3Pt1, and Ni3Pt1, shown in Figure 1. Among the bimetallic catalysts, 
lower overall activity (conversion and TOF) was observed over Pd-based bimetallics compared 
to the Pt-based counterparts, as shown in Figure 2. Therefore, further bimetallic effect studies 
were performed with Co3Pt1 and Ni3Pt1. As shown in Figure 3, bimetallic Co3Pt1 and Ni3Pt1 
showed higher conversion and stability compared to physical mixtures of the respective 
monometallics (Co3+Pt1 and Ni3+Pt1), indicating that there was a synergistic interaction between 
Co-Pt and Ni-Pt when combined. Additional comparison is shown in shown in Figure S2 for the 
evaluation of Fe3Pt1, Fe3Pd1, and Ni3Pd1 with their respective monometallics. The Fe3

monometallic was inactive at the tested conditions. Compared to Pt1, Fe3Pt1 showed lower steady 
state conversion and stability but with higher propylene selectivity. The Fe3Pd1 catalyst was less 
active than Pd1 and no improvements in stability were observed. The Ni3Pd1 bimetallic only 
showed higher conversion and stability when compared to Pd1 but not Ni3.  
The Fe-containing catalysts with Pt1 and Pd1 were CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their 
ability to produce propylene, but these combinations exhibited the lowest conversion. The Fe3Pt1 
catalyst was active and at steady state illustrated 2.6% and 1.1% CO2 and C3H8 conversion, 
respectively, with 32% and 65% C3H6 and CO selectivities, respectively.29 In comparison, the 
Fe3Pd1 catalyst quickly deactivated within the first 2 hours on stream while exhibiting C3H6 
selectivity greater than 50%. Changing Fe3 to Co3 with Pt1 (Co3Pt1) not only increased the 
conversion to 20.3% CO2 and 5.6% C3H8 conversion, but also enhanced the dry reforming 
pathway with 88.8% CO selectivity. Compared to the Co3Pt1 catalyst, the conversion of CO2 
over the Co3Pd1 catalyst was 2.5 times lower. A diluted Co3Pt1 sample (dCo3Pt1), which showed 
similar reactant conversion to Co3Pd1, is listed in Table 2 to more accurately examine the 
selectivity at comparable conversions. While the Co3Pd1 catalyst was only slightly less selective 
to CO (66.7% Co3Pd1 vs. 71.7% dCo3Pt1), the selectivity to cracking products (C1, C2, C2
=) 
increased by a factor of 8 compared to the dCo3Pt1 sample. On the other hand, both Ni3Pt1 and 
Ni3Pd1 were DRP catalysts and demonstrated higher activity and stability than the Pt and Pd 
counterparts with Fe3 and Co3. A twofold increase in conversion was observed over the Ni3Pd1 
and Ni3Pt1 catalysts compared to Co3Pd1 and Co3Pt1 (Figure 4a), respectively.

Detailed kinetic measurements comparing the two most promising Pt based bimetallic 
catalysts, Ni3Pt1 and Co3Pt1, are shown in Figure 5. When examining the effect of increasing 
CO2 partial pressure with the CO2 consumption rate, it was evident that Ni3Pt1 consumed CO2 at 
a faster rate than Co3Pt1. Upon reaching a C3H8/CO2 ratio of 0.42 the rate began to plateau and 
then eventually declined over the Co3Pt1 catalyst, indicative of competitive adsorption. 
Additionally, the kinetic study demonstrated that the Co3Pt1 catalyst exhibited higher C3H8 
consumption rates with increasing C3H8 partial pressure compared to Ni3Pt1. However, the 
transformation of propane into products over the Co3Pt1 catalyst, which mainly produced CO, 
occurred at a lower rate compared to Fe3Ni1, which mainly produced C3H6.   Additionally, in a 
previous investigation for the reduction of CO2 with propane it was observed that the rate of 
reactant consumption decreased at high propane partial pressures for both CO2-ODHP and DRP 
catalysts.29 This suggested that as the reaction progressed intermediates from propane  blocked 
surface sites, which led to a loss in CO2-ODHP and DRP activity, and consequently increased 
the cracking products. 
To further assess the potential differences and similarities among the Co3Pt1 and Ni3Pt1 
catalysts, apparent activation barriers and thermogravimetric values are provided. The apparent 
activation barrier of the reforming route over the Co3Pt1 catalyst was 126 kJ⸳mol-1 and the 
previously reported value for Ni3Pt1 was 119 kJ⸳mol-1, refer to Figure S3 for the Arrhenius-type 
plot. These similar apparent activation energies signified that both catalysts potentially undergo 
similar oxidative reaction routes. Based on previous density functional theory (DFT)

calculations, the ODH pathway requires the adsorbed oxygen species (produced from the 
dissociation of CO2) to react with adsorbed CxHy fragments to form an oxygenated intermediate 
before further C-C bond cleavage to form CO.28 Furthermore, if the reaction pathways were 
similar over both catalysts then the mechanism for deactivation should also be consistent with 
coking. The previously reported TGA weight loss of Ni3Pt1 was 8%, and the Co3Pt1 catalyst in 
this study lost 4%, see Figure S4.  The extent of coking was similar after considering the 
different C3H8 conversions over the two catalysts. 
Non-precious bimetallic catalysts composed of Fe, Co, and Ni  
To assess which non-precious catalysts exhibited inherent activity for CO2-ODHP or 
DRP, flow reactor studies were performed on the FexNiy, CoxNiy, and FexCoy bimetallic systems. 
Figure 6 illustrates the conversion and selectivity of the parent metals for the FexNiy, CoxNiy, and 
FexCoy catalysts. Monometallic Fe1, Fe3, and Co1 were all inactive at steady state and the Co3 
monometallic, as stated in the last section, exhibited low conversion. Both Ni3 and Ni1 were 
active dry reforming catalysts. The various Fe-Ni catalysts showed different conversion and 
selectivity profiles than their parent monometallics, illustrating that there was a unique 
interaction between Fe and Ni on CeO2 see Figure S5. Of all the Fe-Ni catalysts examined, only 
Fe3Ni1 was selected for further bimetallic effect experiments. A physical mixture of Fe3 and Ni1 
illustrated less than 14% propylene selectivity at 4% C3H8 conversion whereas the bimetallic 
Fe3Ni1 exhibited 58% propylene selectivity at 2.7% C3H8 conversion, see Figure 7. Both Fe1Co3 
and Fe3Co1 only exhibited higher CO2 and C3H8 conversions compared to their respective

monometallics during the first 5 hours on stream. The stability of Fe1Co3 was greater than Fe1 
but less than Co3, whereas for the Fe3Co1 catalyst the stability was less than both monometallics. 
The Co3Ni1 catalyst showed higher steady state conversion over both reactants and improved 
stability compared to Ni1 and Co3, while keeping high CO selectivity that was comparable to Ni1 
(but higher than Co3).  Co1Ni3 and Co3Ni3 both showed comparable reactant conversion and 
stability profiles compared to their respective monometallic counterparts. The stability profiles 
can be found in Figure 8.  
As stated above, the previously reported Fe3Ni1 catalyst was a promising system for the 
CO2-ODHP reaction. To further explore this bimetallic system three additional Fe-Ni catalysts 
were evaluated in the current study to investigate the bimetallic effect on activity and selectivity. 
Doubling the catalyst metal loading but maintaining the 3:1 Fe to Ni ratio (Fe9Ni3) increased the 
conversion but negatively impacted the selectivity toward propylene (22.5% SC3H6 at 3.4% 
XC3H6). Setting an equal atomic concentration of Fe to Ni (Fe3Ni3) also increased the conversion, 
but at 5.0% C3H8 conversion only exhibited 20.4% C3H6 selectivity.  Finally, changing the 
atomic ratio from Fe3Ni1 to Fe1Ni3 also increased the catalyst activity but completely altered the 
selectivity pathway to favor the DRP (90.6% SCO) even at a comparable propane conversion of 
2.1%, see Table S2.  
The FexCoy bimetallic catalysts had low overall activity compared to the FexNiy systems. 
The Fe3Co1 catalyst was inactive after 12 hours on stream. The steepest loss in activity for the 
Fe3Co1 catalyst occurred within the first 5 hours on stream, however during that time the C3H6

selectivity was above 50%, see Figure S1(g-h). The Fe1Co3 catalyst also experienced a loss in 
activity with time on stream (TOS) resulting in low steady state conversions of CO2 and C3H8 
that corresponded to 1.5% and 0.9%, respectively.  In addition, as TOS increased, the selectivity 
toward C1, C2, and C2
= products increased over both the Fe3Co1 and Fe1Co3 catalysts. 
While atomic percentages in most bimetallic catalysts can influence the conversion and 
selectivity, FexNiy and to some extent the stability of the FexCoy system, the CoxNiy catalysts 
were not influenced. Co3Ni1, Co1Ni3, and Co3Ni3, were examined to investigate the effect of 
varying the atomic ratio of Co to Ni. All three CoxNiy catalysts exhibited similar conversion, 
stability, and selectivity toward CO (average of 96.2). 
In situ characterization of metal oxidation states 
In situ XANES measurements were conducted to examine the oxidation states of the 
catalysts under reaction conditions, shown in Figure 9.  Ni3Pt1 had previously been examined and 
it was determined that the catalyst under reaction conditions consisted of metallic Ni and Pt.29 In 
the present study, in situ XANES results showed that Ni3Pd1 consisted of metallic Ni and Pd, see 
Figure S6. Therefore, both Ni3Pt1 and Ni3Pd1 were DRP catalysts that consisted of metallic 
phases under reaction conditions and showed improved stability compared to their respective 
precious metal monometallics.  
Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to 
consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in 
the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction

conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway. Thus, it 
was of interest in this study to investigate if the selectivity difference between the CO2-ODHP 
Fe3Ni1 catalyst and the DRP Fe1Ni3 catalyst was attributed to different oxidation states. The in 
situ XANES results shown in Figure 10 revealed that like Fe3Ni1, the DRP Fe1Ni3 catalyst also 
consisted of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. Therefore, the selectivity differences among the 
various FexNiy catalysts were not caused by changes in oxidation state. From the previous DFT 
calculations, it was also observed that in the presence of oxygen (from the dissociation of CO2), 
Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O. However, on a 
surface that contained a greater amount of Ni than Fe, it was inferred that metallic Ni particles 
would be more pronounced. This could essentially dampen the catalytic effect observed with 
oxidized Fe, thereby changing the active site and promoting activity in favor of the dry reforming 
reaction, similar to those described previously for the reactions of CO2 with ethane.36   
The Fe-Co bimetallic catalysts also illustrated a preference to form propylene but have 
low performance due to deactivation. The in situ XANES results revealed that the Fe3Co1 
catalyst consisted mainly of metallic Co and oxidized Fe, but the extent of Fe oxidation was less 
than that in the Fe3Ni1 catalyst (Figure 9a), which may be the cause of the observed lower steady 
state activity and stability. Figure 9(b-c) depicts the in situ XANES spectra of the DRP Co3Ni1 
catalyst which demonstrated that under reaction conditions the catalyst consisted of metallic Ni 
and metallic Co; this is unlike the other non-precious systems, Fe-Ni and Fe-Co, which were

influenced by atomic concentration and contained an oxidized component in the catalysts.  This 
comparison was consistent with the argument that unoxidized metals favored the DRP pathway. 
Conclusions 
The reduction of CO2 by propane can proceed via the DRP or CO2-ODHP pathways to 
produce synthesis gas or propylene, respectively, and both reactions may occur simultaneously at 
823 K. The present work aimed to identify bimetallic combinations that were active and selective 
for the reactions of CO2+C3H8. Pt1 and Pd1 based bimetallic catalysts with Fe3, Co3, and Ni3 as 
well as non-precious metal combinations with varying atomic composition have been evaluated 
in flow reactor studies.  
Pt-based bimetallic catalysts outperformed Pd-based catalysts on both mass-based 
conversion and site-specific TOF values. Of the three transition metals examined with Pt1 and 
Pd1, Ni3 outperformed Fe3 and Co3 in terms of CO2 and propane conversions. Compared to 
monometallic Pt1 and Pd1, the bimetallics with Ni3 and Co3 were not only more active, but also 
exhibited greater stability. The CoxNiy catalyst, which are composed of metallic Co and Ni under 
reaction conditions, were also active and selective for the DRP pathway. In comparison, the 
FexNiy catalysts exhibited selectivity toward CO2-ODHP, and the selectivity can be further 
modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition. Increasing the Ni atomic 
ratio above 1 altered the selectivity to favor the DRP pathway rather than CO2-ODHP. Overall, a 
bimetallic catalyst library to determine inherent activity toward DRP or CO2-ODHP was 
established and can be used toward future efforts to increase activity, stability, and selectivity.
