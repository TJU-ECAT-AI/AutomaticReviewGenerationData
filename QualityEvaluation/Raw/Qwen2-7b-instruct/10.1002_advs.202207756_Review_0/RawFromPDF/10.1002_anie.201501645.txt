Inside Cover: Microfluidic Synthesis of Rigid Nanovesicles for Hydrophilic Reagents Delivery (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 13/2015)
Graphical Abstract
Nanocarriers for the delivery of hydrophilic reagents are important in drug therapy and disease diagnosis. In their Communication on page 3952 ff., J. Sun, X. Jiang, and co-workers report a three-stage microfluidic chip that can assemble water core/PLGA shell/lipid layer rigid nanovesicles (RNV) in one step for hydrophilic-reagent delivery (PLGA=poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)). For a multi-drug-resistant tumor model, co-delivery of siMDR1 and doxorubicin using RNVs has an enhanced antitumor effect in both in vitro and in vivo experiments.
