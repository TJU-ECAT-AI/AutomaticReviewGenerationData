Abstract
Conspectus
Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an “on purpose” propylene production technology is developing. Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are widely applied in commercialized PDH processes, and both exhibit high activity and propylene yields. However, as an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 °C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth. Nanostructured catalysts (NCs) based on metals and/or metal oxides with tunable geometric and electronic properties play significant roles because such features intrinsically influence the adsorption of propyl intermediates on the catalyst surface. However, thermodynamical metastability of these NCs results in grand challenges in their structure-controlled preparation. The regulation of material structure and reaction performance at the molecular and atomic levels has attracted extended attention over the past few years.
This Account describes our recent advances in controllable regulation of metal and oxide NCs toward efficient propane dehydrogenation. As a structure-insensitive reaction, the dehydrogenation of propane can occur on an individual active site, while larger ensembles of active sites also induce structure-sensitive side reactions, leading to C–C cracking and coke deposition. This paper is aimed at delivering general fundamentals for rational design of NCs in PDH reactions. We start with the catalytic kinetics on the active sites regarding the adsorption of key propyl intermediates on the surface. In subsequent sections, we present the effective regulation strategies for metal and oxide NCs by promoter and support effects. Upon metal NCs, coke deposition and nanoparticles (NPs) sintering tend to occur, which can be suppressed with the increase of geometric separation and charge density of surface active sites by changing alloy compositions, ordered intermetallic alloys, single-atom catalysts, core–shell, and metal–oxide interface structures. Notably, the confinement approach of embedding active sites in zeolite frameworks significantly inhibits the sintering of metal NPs. As alternatives to metals, metal oxides exhibit lower cost but higher barriers of C–H activation and coking inclination. The C–H bond cleavage has been promoted by inducing intrinsic defect sites, such as oxygen vacancies, hydroxyls, and hydrides on the surface and heterogeneous doping in the bulk. Importantly, the structures of the submonolayer/monolayer triggered by spontaneous dispersion and confinement in mesoporous materials significantly improve the oxide activity and stability. All of these strategies have been essential for the efficient PDH reactions. Moreover, the challenges and perspectives are also discussed. It is hoped that the deliberate manipulation of nanostructured catalysts to regulate the reaction mechanism will hold the key to efficient alkane conversion.

1. Introduction
Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, propylene, acetone, polyacrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products. (1−4) Among propylene production processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH), (5−7) a process of direct conversion of propane into propylene and hydrogen is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods compared with methanol-to-olefins, Fischer–Tropsch-to-olefins, etc. The PDH reaction is as illustrated below:
(1)
As an endothermic process, high operation temperatures and harsh conditions extensively limit the catalyst development. Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts have been applied in commercialized PDH processes on account of their excellent activity and propylene productivity. (2) Comparatively, Pt-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly than CrOx-based catalysts. However, Pt suffers from deactivation of sintering and coking. Meanwhile, the high cost of Pt-based catalysts attracts us to rationally design Pt nanostructures and develop alternatives, such as VOx-, (8,9) GaOx-, (10,11) ZrO2-based (12,13) oxide catalysts.
Intrinsically, propane dehydrogenation as structure-insensitive reactions can occur on the individual active site. However, larger particles induce structure-sensitive side reactions, such as cracking, deep dehydrogenation, etc. These side reactions could occur due to the adsorption of propylene intermediate on the catalyst surface, as shown in Scheme 1, which could be regulated via tailoring geometric and electronic features. Different design strategies including changing compositions, constructing intermetallic compounds, single-atom catalysts, core–shell, metal–oxide interaction, encapsulation, defect engineering, and so forth on metal and oxide nanostructure catalysts (NCs) have been developed. Particularly, the induced “geometric effect” and “electronic effect” have been demonstrated to play significant roles in obtaining high activity, selectivity, and stability. (6,7) In this Account, we review mainly our work on fundamentals and experimental design of nanostructured catalysts toward efficient propane dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Fundamentals of Structure Design
Both metal and oxides can be active for dehydrogenation, particularly, due to their affinity for C–H bonds. It is acknowledged that four steps occur on catalyst surface: C3H8 adsorption, C–H cleavage, C3H6 desorption, and site recovery. (14) In terms of the initial C–H activation, the C–H bond cleavage of propane can be divided into two types: α-type (occur at the terminal methyl group) and β-type (occur at the central carbon), which yields the 1-propyl and 2-propyl species, respectively. This step is the rate-determining step and its energy barrier can measure the activity of propane dehydrogenation. Besides, the difference of energy barriers between propylene desorption and further dehydrogenation is the key to determining the selectivity of propylene. (15) Therefore, it is of vital importance to understand the active sites and corresponding reaction kinetics which can shine a light on precise structure design.
2.1. Active Sites and Reaction Kinetics over Metals
Transitional metals such as Pt are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state. Derived from model catalysis, C–H bond cleavage was investigated by Weinberg and Sun in the dissociative chemisorption of propane on Pt(110)-(1×2). (16) They found that the energy barrier for primary C–H bond cleavage was determined to be 1.8 kJ·mol−1 higher than that of secondary C–H bond cleavage. (17) Sykes’ group further studied the C–H bond activation with atomistic detail on single-atom alloys (SAAs). (18) The single-atom Pt sited on the Cu surface showed a lower barrier of C–H cleavage than Cu. Additionally, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H6 were observed on Pt/Cu SAA, indicating the similar ability as Cu to avoid coking via C–C coupling.
By the probability analysis, recently, we further investigated the influencing mechanisms of geometric features and electronic properties over PtM bimetal catalysts. (19) A relatively simplified reaction network was selected via two sequential dehydrogenation reactions (Figure 1a). From a geometric perspective, the geometric effect of M such as In is to help disperse Pt atoms. This induces transformation of propylene adsorption from strong di-σ to weak π mode. As to the electronic effect of In, the d band center of the surface Pt is lowered by alloying with In, leading to the facile desorption of C3H6 (Figure 1b,c).

Therefore, considering the structure-insensitive character of propane dehydrogenation, C–H bond cleavage can occur on every surface Pt atom, while the geometrically dispersed Pt atoms could suppress the structure-sensitive C–C cleavage and further dehydrogenation reactions. Additionally, increasing the electron density of Pt atoms contributes to weakening the bonds of Pt–(C–C) and repulsing the adsorbed propylene and improving the propylene selectivity.
2.2. Active Sites and Reaction Kinetics over Oxides
For metal oxides, differing from metallic Pt in activation of C–H bonds, M–O sites serve as the adsorption sites for propane molecules. Taking CrOx as an example, there are a variety of Crx+ ions, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+. (20,21) Previous research showed that reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ occurs at the beginning and the active site is considered to be the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+, (22) and the adsorbed propane is converted to a Cr3+-C3H8 η3-H,H,H adduct. (23,24) Heterolytic activation of a C–H bond yields the Cr3+–C3H7 intermediate, which is subsequently transformed to Cr3+–C3H6 hydride surface species. Notably, isolated CrO42– species form at a very low loading of Cr; however, the species of Cr–O–Cr could occur with increasing Cr loadings. Kumar et al. observed that among various Cr species, isolated Cr3+ species showed the highest activity. (25) Therefore, it seems that coordinatively unsaturated and highly dispersed M–O sites possess higher dehydrogenation activity.
As discussed above, dehydrogenation of propane on extended metal and oxide surface is significantly dependent on its surface structures, namely, the geometric features and electronic properties, where adsorption strength and manner of adsorbates can be both greatly perturbed. Therefore, the controllable regulation of geometric features and electronic properties is indispensable in modulating the C–H activation and propyl intermediate adsorption and paving the way for rational catalyst design of metal and oxide NCs.
3. Regulating Metal Nanostructured Catalysts
Theoretical analysis has shown that the geometrically dispersed and electron-rich Pt sites exhibited higher propylene selectivity. A bottom-up regulation approach was proposed by alloying/dealloying with promoters and/or anchoring on the specific supports to enhance the dispersion, and at the meantime, tailoring the electronic states by electron redistribution and/or transfer.
3.1. Role of the Promoters
Promoters such as Cu, (26) Fe, (27,28) Mn, (29) Co, (30) Sn, (31) Ga, (32) In, (33) Zn, (34) etc. can be alloyed with Pt. The catalyst design strategy, based on the contribution degree of geometric and electronic features as two orientations, has been proposed from pure Pt phase to disordered, ordered, subsurface, and SAAs with a maximum atomic utilization (Figure 2). Importantly, the thermal stabilities of the alloys play a significant role in PDH, which typically requires temperatures higher than 500 °C. The catalytic data of representative Pt-based catalysts and calculated deactivation rates are summarized in Table 1.

Initially, a higher propylene selectivity and lower deactivation were observed over disordered PtCu alloy (Figure 3a) than over Pt (Figure 3b,c). (26) However, the Pt–Cu interaction is limited due to the disordered Pt–Cu atom distribution. Comparatively, ordered intermetallic alloy (IMA) contains one active metal and another inert component, which can disperse the active sites into isolated atoms. Additionally, this ordered structure provides active sites with higher thermal stability compared with conventional single-atom alloys (Figure 3d). By using the method of sequential incipient wetness impregnation (IWI), the researchers have developed a series of IMAs with high stabilities, such as PtIn, (19) PtFe, (28) PtGa, (35) and so forth, which are very tolerant in PDH reactions (Table 1). In situ synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirmed that an ordered PtFe3 IMA formed and Pt atoms are isolated by neighboring Fe atoms (Figure 3e). (28) The isolated Pt atoms are active in the first and second C–H bond cleavage but inactive in the subsequent dehydrogenation, which drastically improves the selectivity and stability (Figure 3f).

Compared to disordered/ordered alloys, core–shell nanostructures provide an effective approach for decreasing the usage of noble metals through constructing 3dTM@noble metal NCs (Figure 3g), meanwhile tuning the electron properties by TMs in subsurface regions. (27) Experimentally, by H2 reduction and post-acid leaching treatments, we successfully prepared the Pt 3dTM@Pt [3dTM = Fe, Co, and Ni] core–shell nanostructures. (27)Figure 3h presents the energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) line profiles of PtFe@Pt catalysts; about a 1.3 nm Pt shell was observed. Importantly, we found a linear relationship between the d band center and propylene selectivity, where the propylene selectivity increases in the order Pt < PtNi@Pt < PtCo@Pt < PeFe@Pt (Figure 3i). However, the increase of C3H6 selectivity fundamentally accompanies the compromise of C3H8 conversion. Therefore, it is desirable to improve activity and selectivity concurrently. (36)
A reductionist approach involves the stabilization of individual, single-atom catalysts (SACs) (Figure 3j). (37) Combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that SAAs can break the scaling relationship to promote propylene selectivity and propane conversion concurrently. (38) A modified incipient wetness impregnation method was used to form γ-alumina-supported Pt/Cu SAA catalysts. Single Pt atoms were observed on Cu nanoparticles (Figure 3k) to inhibit further dehydrogenation. Consequently, the SAA catalyst achieved a propylene formation rate of 10.6 mol g–1Pt h–1 while maintaining a high selectivity of ∼90% (Figure 3l).
3.2. Role of the Supports
In addition to promoter effects, the supports can regulate the shape of nanostructured particles (NPs) and metal–support interaction (MSI) by changing its morphologies and surface composition.
For example, when Al2O3 is used to support the Pt NPs, the coordinatively unsaturated aluminum atoms have a great impact on anchoring Pt atoms (Figure 4a). Lu’s group (31) reported a γ-Al2O3 nanosheet with rich pentacoordinate Al3+ ions supported on PtSn catalysts, which help disperse and stabilize raft-like Pt–Sn clusters (Figure 4b,c). Additionally, subnanometric metal species can form within zeolite pores (Figure 4d). Corma and co-workers successfully prepared subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.5–0.6 nm) confined in MFI zeolites. (39) In H2 pretreatment (600 °C, >6 h), the PtSn clusters remained stable (Figure 4e). Importantly, this PtSn cluster embedding in the zeolite framework exhibited a low deactivation rate while maintaining high intrinsic catalytic activity (Figure 4f).

Besides morphologies, the support surface composition impacts MSI with supported metal NPs (Figure 4g) by modulating the electronic states. Tauster et al. first described MSI in Pt/TiO2 catalysts, where the electron transfers from the partially reduced supports to the metals. (40) Recently, we have shown that the addition of an appropriate amount of TiO2 on Al2O3 supports increases the electron density of Pt and improves the propylene selectivity and the catalytic stability (Figure 4h). (5) Obviously, desorption peaks of propylene (C3H6-TPD) shift to lower temperatures when TiO2 is added (Figure 4i), which decreases the interactions between propylene and catalysts and thereby decreases the amount of adsorbed propylene.
In addition to oxides, nanocarbons as supports have attracted much attention due to abundant surface sites in hosting metal atoms (Figure 4j). (41) Recently, a-PtSn/ND@G catalyst was prepared over the nanodiamond@ graphene hybrid support with a diamond core and a thin graphene shell. (42) Consequently, atomically dispersed Pt clusters were formed and observed (Figure 4k). Compared with traditional Pt3Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, the turnover frequency (TOF) over a-PtSn/ND@G is significantly increased (Figure 4l).
4. Regulating Oxide Nanostructured Catalysts
Differing from metal NCs, metal oxides activate the propane C–H bonds by the Lewis acid M–O sites. Fundamental insights have revealed that the coordinatively unsaturated and highly dispersed M–O sites show lower energy barriers of C–H activation and higher dehydrogenation activity. The catalyst design strategy has been proposed by inducing defects by reductive treatment and doping as well as increasing dispersion by monomer, polymer, and/or monolayer triggered by spontaneous dispersion (Figure 5).
Figure 5
Figure 5. To improve propane conversion and product selectivity, the catalyst design strategy has been proposed by inducing defects, doping as well as increasing dispersion by monomer, polymer and/or monolayer over oxide NCs.
4.1. Role of the Reductive Treatment
A defect occurs when oxides are treated by a reductive treatment, leading to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated M cations in M–O sites. Zhang et al. suggested that bulk ZrO2 crystallites, with controllable oxygen vacancy concentration (Figure 6a,b) induced by reducing agent treatment, could enable efficient C–H bond activation. (13) A 7 times improvement of the C3H6 formation rate was obtained after CO reduction treatment for 30 min (Figure 6c). Two coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy after reduction pretreatment are demonstrated to be active in the homolytic C–H bond dissociation.

In addition to oxygen vacancies, H2 treatment could contribute to the formation of surface hydroxyl groups (M–OH) (Figure 6d). Combining experimental and calculation study, we designed the Al2O3-supported VOx NCs with different surface V–OH coverages through controlling H2 pretreatment and cofeeding. (43) As shown in Figure 6e,f, the introduction of hydroxyl groups on the VOx surface significantly improves the propylene selectivity and decreases the deactivation rate. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTs) showed that the formation rate of coke deposits (1590 cm–1) is much slower on VOx with hydroxyl groups (V–OH, 3660 cm–1), and this explains that H2-pretreatment contributes to the formation of V–OH possessing higher stability. DFT calculations showed a stronger binding strength of C3H6 over V2O3 (−2.05 eV) compared with the VOx covered with hydroxyl (−0.28 eV). Therefore, the surface V–OH promotes C3H6 desorption and prevents its deep dehydrogenation from forming coke.
Besides, H2 cofeeding can induce the formation of hydrides on oxides (M–H) (Figure 6g). For example, Ga–H species could form on Ga-modified zeolites, or Ga-supported on oxides (i.e., SiO2, ZrO2, TiO2, Al2O3). (44) Recently, Lercher’s group found that, in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, a very low enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ·mol−1 in a heterolytically activating propane C–H bond was observed on [GaH]2+ together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site (Figure 6h,i). (11) Comparably, Maeno et al. (45) investigated In-CHA catalysts and they suggested that [InH2]+ ions are the catalytic active sites for PDH reactions, which shows better performance than [GaH]2+ sites.
4.2. Role of the Promoters
In addition to intrinsic defects as discussed above, introducing foreign atoms to increase the dispersion and tailor the electron states is another effective approach (Figure 7a). Previous research has shown that with the increasing of polymerization degrees of oxide species, the coke formation rate increases, which implies that highly dispersed oxide species (e.g., monomers and polymers) are less active in coke formation than crystalline bulk oxides. For supported Pt-based catalysts, it is generally accepted that the alkali metal promoters such as Mg help to neutralize the surface acid sites. (46) Instead of altering the surface acid–base properties, the doping of a small amount of Mg (i.e., 1 wt %) helps disperse V2O5 nanoparticles into polymerized VOx (Figure 7b). (8) In situ DRIFTs showed that the position of the peak at 1450 cm–1 (C–H vibration) remains unchanged, while the band at 1555 cm–1 gradually shifted to higher wavenumbers (e.g., 1610 cm–1 on 12V1Mg) (1555–1610 cm–1, polymerized hydrocarbons or aromatics) (Figure 7c), indicating Mg doping decreases the coke formation on VOx. Additionally, Kondratenko and co-workers found that the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations in ZrO2-based catalysts can also be increased by depositing tiny amounts of hydrogenation-active metal promoters, (12) catalyzing ZrO2 reduction in situ under dehydrogenation conditions or during reductive catalyst treatment to promote C–H bond dissociation.

Besides the increased dispersion by heterogeneous doping, the electron states of oxide NCs can also be altered by encapsulating metal promoters induced by MSI (Figure 7d). For example, we prepared the ZnO catalysts modified with trace Pt (0.1 wt %) and the ZnO species were identified as active sites while Pt serves as an electronic promoter. (47) Structural characterization showed that most of the Pt surface is encapsulated by ZnO species (Figure 7e). NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) profiles indicated that the Lewis acidity of ZnO was modified by Pt because of the electron transfer from ZnO to Pt; thus, easier C–H breaking and accelerated H2 desorption were achieved. Consequently, the reduction deactivation of ZnO was significantly suppressed (Figure 7f).
4.3. Role of the Supports
Besides promoters, support is another vital factor. For supported VOx-based catalysts, it is proposed that V─O─S (support) bonds are active sites. (48,49) Considering the unique properties of VOx/MO systems, consisting of isolated and/or polymeric nanostructures that wet the supporting MO (Figure 8a), we constructed the submonolayer and/or monolayer VOx nanoclusters on Al2O3 and ZrO2 (Figure 8b), respectively. (50,51) A set of Raman bands were observed over monolayer VOx/Al2O3: broad bands in the range 500–700 cm–1 (V─O─V) and at 910 cm–1 (V─O─Al), intense ones at 994 cm–1, and sharp bands at ∼1021 cm–1 (V═O). Comparatively, we found that VOx/ZrO2 has a more superior PDH performance than VOx/Al2O3. The calculated TOF of the former is almost 6-fold higher, which implies that supports significantly determine the activity. Notably, whether Al2O3 or ZrO2, 1 V/Al and 1 V/Zr showed the highest dehydrogenation activity among different V surface densities, indicating that, compared with their oligomerized counterparts, isolated VOx species possess higher intrinsic activities (Figure 8c). However, the conventional preparation methods cannot obtain the homogeneous structures of isolated oxide NCs.

Alternatively, novel methods such as surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) provide well-defined surface species on supports with isolated −OH sites (Figure 8d). Copéret’s group developed a series of single-site MOx using the SOMC method. For example, isolated Ga sites were achieved through grafting of [Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)] on silica with a thermolysis step at 500 °C under a high vacuum (Figure 8e). This single-site Ga species exhibited superior catalytic performances, combining high activity, selectivity, and stability (Figure 8f). (52) Similarly, Basset and co-workers reported the single-site VOx moieties generated on silica using a μ2-oxo-bridged, (53) bimetallic [V2O4(acac)2] (1) (acac = acetylacetonate anion) complex as a precursor. However, the above used organic precursors are typically expensive (e.g., V2O4(acac)2, by 2 orders of magnitude compared to NH4VO4). Alternatively, using high surface area supports may allow the effective method to increase the geometric dispersion.
The mesoporous materials (Figure 8g) (such as SBA-15 and ordered mesoporous Al2O3) provide alternatives to access more active sites, compared with the conventional supports such as Al2O3 and SiO2. Additionally, the confinement environment provided by supports exerts a spatial restriction on oxide NPs hampering their sintering. Rodemerck et al. reported that MCM-41-supported VOx species exhibited superior PDH performance. (54) Compared with their oligomerized counterparts, it was found that isolated VOx species are more active (Figure 8h,i). However, syntheses of these supports are very complex, time-consuming, and expensive in practical use.
5. Summary and Perspectives
The design of nanostructured catalysts has already opened a new exciting avenue for efficient propane dehydrogenation reactions. This account emphasizes the remarkable progress made mainly in controllable regulation of metal- and oxide-based NCs. The nature of active sites and reaction kinetics has been revealed through theoretical identification. Morphology and composition, such as changing compositions, constructing intermetallic compounds, single-atom catalysts, core–shell, metal–oxide interaction, encapsulation, defect engineering, and so forth, controlled by promoters and supports on metal and oxide NCs have been proved as the most effective strategies to regulate the geometric features and electronic properties and thus increase the propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and antideactivation capacity. Certainly, different strategies could be combined on the basis of the specific demands of the structures. Despite the significant progress, future challenges remain:
(1) NCs with well-defined morphologies and active sites are required to investigate the property–structure relations at the nanoscale level. Different strategies have different deficiencies, for example, expensive precursors and large surface area supports are needed in obtaining highly dispersed active sites. More efficient and refined strategies should be further investigated in future work. Especially, the design of thermodynamically and kinetically stable SAC catalysts such as the ordered single-site intermetallic alloys for propane dehydrogenation reactions is highly desired.
(2) In situ or operando technologies provide fundamental insights into the structures of NCs under reaction conditions, for illustrating the geometric and electronic effects and identifying their individual influence. This can provide guidance for rational design and synthesis of functional materials at atomic levels to regulate propane C–H bond activation and propyl intermediate adsorption.
(3) In addition to noble-metal-based catalysts, some cheaper transition metals, such as Ni, Fe, and Co, are also essential in C–H activation. Extending the screening of Pt-based catalysts to cheaper transition metals remains a grand challenge for future research work.
(4) The preparation and structures of NCs and supports have been mostly investigated in the laboratory, but it is vital to explore synthesis technologies that are applied for large-scale production. Future demand for such materials will not be met by today’s limited manufacturing technologies.
(5) Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) as an alternative propylene production technologies can break through the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation of nonoxidative dehydrogenation. On the other hand, the CL-ODH reaction consumes lattice oxygen, which requires frequent regeneration. Moreover, the propylene formation rate is relatively low and some metal oxides are highly toxic. Therefore, developing nontoxic oxygen carriers with high activity, oxygen capacity, and regeneration stability are needed.
We believe that future efforts are surely not limited to what has been mentioned above. The rapid development in this field will finally lead to the deliberated manipulation of nanostructured catalysts, which is the key to efficient alkane conversions.
