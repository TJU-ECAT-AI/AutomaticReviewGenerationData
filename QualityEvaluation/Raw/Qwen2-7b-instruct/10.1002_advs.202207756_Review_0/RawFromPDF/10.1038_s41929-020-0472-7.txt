I
t has been demonstrated in numerous systems that the introduc-
tion of a second metal into nanoparticulate metal catalysts can 
substantially modulate the electronic structure of pristine metals 
and further influence their catalytic behaviour1. Furthermore, the 
electronic structures and surface properties of bimetallic nanopar-
ticles are strongly dependent on the spatial distribution of the two 
elements. By tuning the procedure for preparing the bimetallic 
nanoparticles or by post-synthetic treatments, the spatial distri-
bution of the two elements as well as their chemical states can be 
modified and, thus, their reactivity2–4. Under reaction conditions, 
structural transformation and reconstruction of the metal ensem-
bles may also occur, which may result in further changes of the cata-
lytic behaviour with time on stream.
Platinum-based materials are widely used for reforming, hydro-
genation and dehydrogenation catalysts in numerous industrial 
processes due to their excellent properties for the activation of C–H 
bonds while limiting the extent of C–C bond cleavage through 
hydrogenolysis5. Nonetheless, a second metal is typically incor-
porated together with Pt to further improve the selectivity and/or 
stability of the process, particularly when the reaction temperature 
needs to be high (for example, endothermic reactions). For instance, 
tin is introduced as a second metal for propane dehydrogenation to 
propylene in the UOP Oleflex process6,7. Pt and the second metal (in 
this work, Sn) can be found in bimetallic catalysts as multiple struc-
tures that range from completely segregated phases of each metal 
to perfectly mixed (Pt/Sn) alloys8. The optimal catalyst is achieved 
when C–C bond cleavage is shut down with no or minimal loss of 
the active sites responsible for the reaction of interest (for example, 
dehydrogenation). Although PtSn alloys notably promote the selec-
tivity to propylene in propane dehydrogenation, they also reduce 
and/or modulate the active Pt sites, decreasing the catalytic activity5.
The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts (M = Ga, Zn, In, Sn) 
have been studied by in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray 
absorption spectroscopy (XAS). High Sn content and high activa-
tion temperature favour the formation of alloyed structures that 
substantially promote catalyst selectivity and stability in dehydro-
genation reactions8. However, the resulting large alloyed PtM par-
ticles are suboptimal from an activity standpoint, and there is an 
interest in designing more active, selective and stable subnanomet-
ric bimetallic catalysts9–12. In this respect, taking advantage of the 
confinement effect of zeolite structures, subnanometric metal spe-
cies (single atoms and clusters with a few atoms) can be generated 
and stabilized in the porous structures within zeolite crystallites13–17.
In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact 
interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters 
(0.5–0.6 nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R chan-
nels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic 
performance. To understand the interaction between the subnano-
metric Pt and Sn species, we have employed several characteriza-
tion techniques, including XAS, quasi in situ transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) and CO infrared (CO-IR) spectroscopy. It will 
be shown that subtle changes in the structural features of the sub-
nanometric PtSn clusters, which are not immediately visible by 
conventional spectroscopic techniques, can drastically affect their 
performance for propane dehydrogenation.

K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample (containing 0.4 wt% Pt, 0.9 wt% Sn and 
0.6 wt% K) was prepared by a one-pot synthesis according to our

Modulating the structures of subnanometric metal clusters at the atomic level is a great synthetic and characterization chal-
lenge in catalysis. Here, we show how the catalytic properties of subnanometric platinum clusters (0.5–0.6 nm) confined in the 
sinusoidal 10R channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite are modulated upon introduction of partially reduced tin species that 
interact with the noble metal at the metal/support interface. The platinum–tin clusters are stable in H2 over an extended period 
of time (>6 h), even at high temperatures (for example, 600 °C), which is determined by only a few additional tin atoms added to 
the platinum clusters. The structural features of platinum–tin clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional char-
acterization techniques but can be established after combination of in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure, high-angle 
annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and CO infrared data, are key to providing a one-order of magni-
tude lower deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction while maintaining high intrinsic (initial) catalytic activity.

As shown in Fig. 1a–d and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, the location 
of the singly dispersed Pt atoms in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air 
sample was determined by a combination of high-resolution 
high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron 
microscopy (HR-HAADF-STEM) and integrated differential phase 
contrast (iDPC) imaging, which can simultaneously provide infor-
mation on the location of heavy elements (Pt in this work) and the 
structure of the zeolite, respectively, under low-dose conditions18,19. 
To ensure the presence of atomically dispersed Pt atoms in the 
K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample, a reference K-MFI sample (without Sn 
or Pt) was analysed and compared. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 
3, and considering the image simulation results from our previous 
work, the bright dots appearing in the HR-HAADF-STEM images 
can be ascribed to Pt atoms17.

The chemical states of Pt in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air 
sample during H2 reduction at 600 °C were investigated by in situ 
XAS. It was found that, regardless of the reduction time, the Pt 
species in the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample were completely reduced 
to metallic Pt at 600 °C (ref. 14), as inferred by the intensity of the 
white line in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) 
spectra compared with a Pt foil reference (Fig. 2a) and the appear-
ance of Pt–Pt contributions in the extended X-ray absorption fine 
structure (EXAFS) spectra (Fig. 2b and Table 1). The STEM images 
show that the majority of the metal reassembles as subnanometric 
clusters of 0.5–0.6 nm during the H2 treatment (Fig. 1). The size of 
the Pt clusters remains virtually unaltered regardless of the reduc-
tion time from 0 to 22 h, indicating high structural robustness 
(Supplementary Figs. 4–9). The average size of the Pt species in the 
K-PtSn@MFI samples after reduction at 600 °C for 0–22 h was also 
analysed by EXAFS (see fitting details for the Pt-edge EXAFS results 
in Supplementary Fig. 10). As shown in Table 1, the Pt–Pt coordi-
nation number remains unchanged at around 6–7 for all reduction 
times. We note that a small fraction of larger particles coexist with 
the very small clusters in all these samples, leading to an average 
EXAFS coordination number slightly larger than that one would 
expect for Pt clusters of 0.5–0.6 nm. However, the vast majority of 
Pt ensembles observed by electron microscopy have a size below 
0.6 nm and remain stable regardless of the reduction time at 600 °C. 
Analysis of the STEM-iDPC (combination of HR-HAADF-STEM 
and iDPC) images indicates that the Pt clusters in these reduced 
K-PtSn@MFI samples are in the 10R sinusoidal channels, regardless 
of the H2 reduction time at 600 °C (Fig. 1e–t and Supplementary 
Figs. 11–16)
The nature of the Sn species and their coordination environ-
ments in the K-PtSn@MFI samples were also studied by Sn K-edge 
XAS. Sn is inferred to be Sn(iv) in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air 
sample, as indicated by the pronounced white line in the XANES 
spectra (Fig. 2c). Analysis of the EXAFS region (Fig. 2d, Table 1 and 
Supplementary Fig. 17) shows the virtual lack of heavy backscatter-
ing in this sample (for example, the absence of Sn–O–Sn ensembles, 
which are observed in the bulk SnO2 standard), which indicates 
that Sn is atomically dispersed inside the MFI. Furthermore, the 
31P magic-angle-spinning NMR data for trimethylphosphine oxide 
(TMPO) adsorbed on Sn species within Pt-free K-Sn-MFI (pre-
pared by the same procedure as the K-PtSn@MFI sample but with-
out the addition of the Pt precursor) show resonances below 50 ppm 
(Supplementary Fig. 18), which indicates that the vast majority of 
the Sn species are present as extra-framework species in the unre-
duced catalyst rather than as framework Sn species, for which 31P 
resonances at 50–60 ppm would be observed20.
After treatment with H2 at 600 °C, the Sn(iv) species are reduced 
to Sn species with an average of approximately three Sn–O bonds, 
according to the EXAFS data (Table 1), and a white line intensity 
that matches that of Sn(ii) in a bulk SnO standard. We infer that

labile oxygen in the unreduced K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample reacts 
with H2 to form Sn(ii) species covalently bonded to oxygen atoms in 
the support. The 31P NMR spectrum of adsorbed TMPO confirms 
this observation, as new bands at 50–60 ppm grow in the presence 
of H2 that can be attributed to coordinatively unsaturated SnO2–x 
that have adsorbed TMPO and exhibit a 31P NMR signal in the same 
region as framework-type Sn species (Supplementary Fig. 18)20. 
Within the sensitivity limits of XANES, the chemical states of Sn 
remain unchanged when the reduction time at 600 °C is extended 
from 0 to 22 h. Fitting of the EXAFS spectra also shows almost the 
same Sn–O coordination number regardless of the reduction time 
(Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 17). However, and interestingly, 
we observed drastic changes in the catalytic performance for pro-
pane dehydrogenation as a function of reduction time (vide infra), 
which indicates some structural changes on prolonged exposure to 
H2. The fraction of Sn responsible for tuning the Pt catalytic proper-
ties appears to be too small to detect using an averaging technique 
such as EXAFS, in which Sn–O contributions clearly dominate (see 
Supplementary Discussion).
In summary, neither the Pt LIII-edge nor the Sn K-edge EXAFS 
spectra show evidence of any kind of bimetallic interactions in this 
series of samples, in contrast to literature reports in which the two 
metals form well-established alloys21–23. Nevertheless, the presence 
of Sn in these catalysts has a strong effect on the catalytic proper-
ties of Pt, which will be discussed later in this report. Interestingly, 
these properties can be controlled by varying the reduction time, 
following a change in structure that is too subtle to be detected 
 
by EXAFS24.
Direct measurement of PtSn clusters by quasi in situ TEM. To 
avoid the oxidation of PtSn clusters in air, TEM experiments were 
carried out using a vacuum transfer TEM holder when trans-
ferring the reduced sample into the microscope (see details in 
Supplementary Fig. 19)25,26. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 20–23, 
 
these quasi in situ TEM experiments revealed well-distributed 
subnanometric Pt clusters that are located in the 10R sinusoidal 
channels, according to the STEM-iDPC images (Supplementary 
 
Figs. 24–31). Due to the very small size of the PtSn clusters and 
the relatively low stability of the zeolite support under the elec-
tron beam, it was extremely difficult to obtain information on the 
distribution of Pt and Sn by conventional X-ray energy dispersive 
spectroscopy, although this technique has been used to provide 
information on other bimetallic nanoparticles27,28. To quantitatively 
describe the spatial distribution of subnanometric Pt and Sn in the 
various K-PtSn@MFI samples, the HR-HAADF-STEM images were 
analysed by a modified K-means clustering method (an unsuper-
vised machine learning algorithm for signal processing, as explained 
in Supplementary Figs. 32 and 33)17. As can be seen in Fig. 3, only 
Pt and Sn species that can be identified by the K-means cluster-
ing analysis based on the different Z contrast of Pt and Sn species 
in the HR-HAADF-STEM image can be considered. We should 
note that only small Sn clusters adjacent to small Pt clusters can be 
detected by this analysis method because of the lack of sensitivity 
to locate single Sn atoms, as discussed in our previous work17. As 
shown in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 34–37, we have found that 
as the reduction time increases, the percentage of bimetallic PtSn 
clusters in the K-PtSn@MFI sample also increases, reaching >40% 
in both the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-
22h samples. We note that this analysis is only semi-quantitative as 
HAADF-STEM does not provide sufficient Z contrast to detect iso-
lated Sn atoms that may be contacting the Pt clusters and also part 
of the three-dimensional information on the zeolite is lost in the 
two-dimensional image processing. However, our K-means cluster-
ing analysis identifies a gradually greater contact between Pt and Sn 
on increasing the reduction time. Independent observations of the 
Pt performance in CO chemisorption and propane dehydrogena-
tion experiments suggest that the number of Pt clusters that contain 
Sn is actually much greater than 40% at the longest reduction times

(vide infra). Considering the size of the metal clusters confined in 
the sinusoidal channels of MFI (Fig. 1), the lack of Pt–Sn interac-
tions detectable by EXAFS and the clear presence of Sn–O and 
Pt–Pt bonds (Table 1), we speculate that a representative reduced 
bimetallic PtSn cluster in this sample comprises a Pt core of 8–10 
atoms and a few Sn atoms that make direct contact with the oxygen 
 
atoms of the support. Nevertheless, a notable fraction of the Sn 
seems to exist as partially reduced SnO2–x clusters that do not 
directly interact with the Pt, appearing as strong Sn–O signals in 
the EXAFS spectra.
For comparison, we also carried out the same K-means cluster-
ing analysis on the HR-HAADF-STEM images of samples that were 
exposed to atmospheric air after H2 treatment and prior to introduc-
tion into the microscope (see Fig. 3e–h). When the reduced samples 
were exposed to atmospheric air, the number of Sn in close prox-
imity to Pt decayed markedly (Fig. 4). At very low reduction times 
(K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h), the percentage of Pt clusters interacting 
with Sn is very low (~15%). That value initially increases to ~27% 
and then decreases to ~20% as the reduction time is prolonged for 
the next 22 h (Supplementary Figs. 38–43). We infer that the two 
metals segregate as the oxophilic Sn is mobilized on contact with 
air, as has been widely reported for bimetallic nanoparticles in the 
literature29–31.
As noted above, the K-means clustering analysis is based on 
two-dimensional projection images, whereas the K-PtSn@MFI 
zeolite is a three-dimensional material. Moreover, the complicated 
structure of K-PtSn@MFI also makes it difficult to distinguish the 
Pt and Sn species, which has already been explained in our pre-
vious work17. Despite the artifacts that may be introduced by the 
above factors, the percentages of Pt–Sn contacts in K-PtSn@MFI 
samples measured under quasi in situ conditions are clearly higher 
than the values obtained in the corresponding ex situ experiments, 
confirming the influence of the reduction on the spatial relationship 
between Pt and Sn species, and stressing the need to protect the 
reduced sample from air to obtain reliable results.
Subnanometric Pt clusters seem to show a higher probability of 
interacting with subnanometric Sn species during long reduction 
times. Such a characteristic indicates that Pt clusters are probably 
reduced first by H2, consistent with previous work showing full Pt 
reduction at <200 °C (ref. 14), followed by reduction of the Sn(iv) 
species and subsequent migration to meet the Pt clusters, which is 
also consistent with the time-resolved Pt LIII-edge and Sn K-edge 
XANES spectra of the pristine K-PtSn@MFI in H2 reported here 
(Supplementary Figs. 44 and 45).

we employed IR spectroscopy using CO as a probe molecule to 
investigate the electronic properties of the Pt species. As shown 
in Fig. 5a, the bimetallic K-PtSn@MFI samples show a band at 
~1,887 cm−1 that the monometallic K-Pt@MFI does not. This band 
is slightly blue-shifted relative to that observed in the K-Sn@MFI 
sample, which can be attributed to CO adsorbed on Pt–SnOx sites. 
Interestingly, the contribution of this band decreases on increasing 
the pre-reduction time, as reduction of Sn(iv) species occurs. The 
Sn-edge XANES and EXAFS spectra show, in contrast, that the Sn 
species exist as highly dispersed SnOx and that the averaged oxida-
tion state of the Sn species in the whole sample is close to Sn(ii), 
regardless of the reduction time (Fig. 2 and Table 1). We believe that 
the reduced Sn species in contact with Pt clusters represent a frac-
tion of the total Sn species in the whole material, which is too small 
to be captured by an averaging technique such as EXAFS24.
The formation of interactions between Pt clusters and partially 
reduced Sn species during the H2 treatment is also reflected in the 
changes in the CO absorption bands in the range 1,850−1,650 cm−1. 
The CO bands in this range should be associated with the CO 
adsorbed on the metal clusters32–34. The positions of the bands are 
related to the electronic structures of the metal clusters, which 
are controlled by their chemical composition, size and geometric 
structure. Therefore, it is difficult to assign the absorption band 
to a specific type of species. Nevertheless, we can still see some 
trends in the changes in the spectra caused by the pre-treatment 
with H2. The μ3-absorption band of CO on Pt clusters (1,690 cm−1) 
can be observed in both K-Pt@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-1h, 
and decreases drastically after 3 h of reduction treatment. On the 
other hand, the band at 1,659 cm−1 increases in the K-PtSn@MFI-
600H2-3h spectrum compared with in the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-1h 
spectrum. These changes indicate the modulation of the electronic 
structures of the Pt clusters during the H2 treatment, which may be 
related to the interaction between Pt and Sn species.
Nevertheless, the formation of PtSn nanoparticles is confirmed 
by the decrease in the CO-IR band at 2,018 cm−1 in the K-PtSn@
MFI samples on increasing the reduction time from 1 to 3 h. The 
contribution of this band, which corresponds to CO adsorbed on 
highly under-coordinated Pt sites of nanoparticles35, decreases 
notably when the K-PtSn@MFI sample is reduced for ≥3 h at 600 °C 
by H2, as more Sn adds to the cluster and inhibits the adsorption 
of CO on the adjacent Pt atoms36–38. However, we did not observe 
 
Pt–Sn bonding by EXAFS, indicating that the fraction of PtSn 
nanoparticles in the whole sample is low, consistent with the 
 
fact that the vast majority of Pt atoms retain their original Pt–Pt 
coordination (Table 1).
The formation of Pt clusters interacting with partially reduced 
Sn species in the reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples can also be inferred 
from the CO chemisorption results. As displayed in Fig. 5b, the 
apparent Pt dispersion decreases with reduction time, especially 
from 0 to 6 h. Because the size of the Pt clusters remains almost 
unchanged according to the STEM and EXAFS data, the decrease 
in exposed surface Pt should be caused by the formation of 
 
Pt–Sn interactions in a scenario in which partially reduced Sn 
 
species interact with the external surface of the Pt clusters. Again, 
we note that the number of Sn atoms interacting with the Pt clusters 
 
must be low, which causes the absence of a Pt–Sn contribution 
 
in the EXAFS spectra and a Pt dispersion of ~30% in the K-PtSn@
MFI-600H2-22h sample39,40.
According to all the spectroscopic results discussed above 
(Sn-edge XANES and EXAFS, CO-IR), it can be concluded that 
pre-reduction treatment induces the reduction of Sn(iv) species 
in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI sample and that the reduced Sn spe-
cies can interact with subnanometric Pt clusters. A schematic of 
the structural evolution of the Pt and Sn species starting from the 
pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample is presented in Fig. 6, in which 
we postulate that the reduction of Pt single atoms to Pt clusters, the 
reduction of atomically dispersed Sn(iv) to reduced Sn species and 
the formation of PtSn bimetallic clusters occur stepwise with a final 
PtSn cluster structure consisting of a few Pt atoms (we deduce less 
than 15 based on microscopy results) and a few Sn atoms (for exam-
ple, 2–3) coordinated to the external surface, probably through 
Pt–O–Sn bonding. We note that the geometric and electronic 
 
features of these PtSn bimetallic clusters are not common to most 
conventional PtSn bimetallic catalysts41,42.
Catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation. To demon-
strate the implications of the structural changes occurring during 
H2 reduction, we tested various K-PtSn@MFI samples as catalysts 
for propane dehydrogenation. For this study, we used a short con-
tact time to achieve conversions below the thermodynamic equi-
librium (~70%), to better study the influence of the pre-reduction 
treatment. The catalytic performance of K-PtSn@MFI after differ-
ent pre-reduction treatments is shown in Fig. 7. As can be seen in

conversion from propane to propylene and H2 is ~70% at a theo-
retical 100% propylene selectivity) and the selectivity to propylene 
was ~82%, giving ~18% hydrogenolysis products (methane, eth-
ane and ethylene) and a very small amount of aromatics. A fast 
decay of the activity was observed over ~15 h of time on stream, 
caused by the blockage of the Pt sites by coke. When the starting 
K-PtSn@MFI sample was kept in H2 at 600 °C for 1 h before the 
propane dehydrogenation reaction (using the activation conditions 
of our previous work17; see Fig. 7b), then the initial activity for the 
dehydrogenation decreased slightly, whereas the selectivity to pro-
pylene increased to 93%. More importantly, the deactivation rate 
was lower than that of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample. When 
the pre-reduction time at 600 °C was further increased to 3, 6 and 
12 h (Fig. 7c–e), the initial conversion of propane remained almost 
unchanged, whereas the deactivation of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst 
was markedly suppressed. Coke preferentially forms on unselective 
Pt sites and therefore the K-PtSn@MFI sample with higher initial 
selectivity also exhibits slower deactivation43. The slower deacti-
vation is associated with the reductive atmosphere, because ther-
mal treatment in N2 at 600 °C does not alleviate the deactivation 
(Supplementary Fig. 46). However, when the K-PtSn@MFI sample 
was pre-reduced with H2 for a longer time of 22 h (see Fig. 7f), a 
slight decrease in the initial activity was observed, but high initial 
selectivity and very slow deactivation were achieved. Note that no 
H2 was introduced into the feed gas in any of the above catalytic 
tests. Slower deactivation and a longer lifetime would be expected 
if H2 was introduced, although with a penalty in the equilibrium 
conversion44,45.
As can be seen in Fig. 7g,h, the initial activity on a per mol Pt 
basis is almost the same, regardless of the pre-reduction treatments 
from 0 to 22 h, whereas the deactivation constant varies drastically. 
This result is remarkable, because the number of Pt sites and their 
reactivity must remain high while Sn is incorporated to (selectively) 
modulate the Pt reactivity to avoid hydrogenolysis and coke forma-
tion reactions. In this sense, the microscopy and EXAFS analyses 
confirmed not only that the K-PtSn@MFI samples remain ultra-
dispersed after the various thermal treatments, but also that the 
incorporation of Sn at the longest reduction times is just enough to 
greatly inhibit the deactivation by coke without compromising the 
dehydrogenation catalytic activity.
To further confirm the role of Sn, we studied the influence of Sn 
loading in the K-PtSn@MFI sample on the catalytic performance 
(see Supplementary Figs. 47–51 and Supplementary Discussion). 
The sample with lowest Sn loading gave lower initial selectiv-
ity to propylene and faster deactivation, which can be associated 
with fewer Pt–Sn contacts in the sample, whereas in the sample 
with highest Sn loading, PtSn alloy nanoparticles (>2 nm) were 
formed due to the presence of plenty of defects in the MFI zeolite 
crystallites, and this sintering of Pt species resulted in a decrease in 
activity. These results confirm the critical role of Sn in improving 
the selectivity to propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation. 
Furthermore, the results clearly show that the formation of bime-
tallic PtSn clusters is much more favourable when Pt and Sn are 
confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of MFI zeolite.
The K-PtSn@MFI samples were also characterized after the 
 
propane dehydrogenation tests by STEM. As shown in 
Supplementary Figs. 52–57, no sintering of the Pt clusters into 
larger particles was observed in any of the samples after propane 
dehydrogenation, and the location of PtSn clusters in the 10R sinu-
soidal channels is also preserved, further confirming their high 
stability (Supplementary Figs. 58–61). Furthermore, as shown in 
Supplementary Figs. 62 and 63, the high initial activity, very slow 
deactivation and size of the subnanometric PtSn clusters were pre-
served for three reaction cycles.
The good performance of the Pt species confined in the 10R 
channels of MFI zeolite is also reflected by comparison of the initial 
reactivity for propane dehydrogenation with results reported in the 
literature. We have summarized the catalyst activation conditions

Fig. 6 | Structural evolution of K-PtSn@MFI during reduction with H2. a, In the pristine K-PtSn@MFI sample, both Pt and Sn(iv) exist as atomically 
dispersed species in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite. b, After reduction by H2 at ~400 °C, Pt single atoms will be reduced and form 
subnanometric Pt clusters. whereas only a few of the Sn(iv) species will be reduced. c, When the temperature is increased to 600 °C, most of the Sn(iv) 
species are reduced to Sn(ii), but these reduced Sn species mainly remain separated from the Pt clusters. d, After being kept in a flow of H2 for a long time 
(≥12 h), some of the reduced Sn species migrate towards the Pt clusters and bimetallic PtSn clusters with reduced Sn species interacting with the external 
surface of Pt clusters are formed in the sinusoidal 10R channels of the MFI zeolite. It should be noted that, due to the complexity of the structures of the 
PtSn clusters, the models proposed in this Figure could be over simplified. PtSn clusters with different structures could exist in the working catalyst, as 
indicated by the CO-IR spectra.

and selectivity of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The catalyst was reduced by H2 from room temperature 
up to 600 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C min–1. Once the temperature reached 600 °C, the atmosphere was switched to the propane dehydrogenation feed 
gases. b–f, Activity and selectivity of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2 catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation reaction following pre-reduction for the given time: 
K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-1h (b), K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-3h (c), K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-6h (d), K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h (e) and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h (f). For 
the samples shown in b–f, the catalyst was reduced by H2 from room temperature up to 600 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C min–1 and then kept at 600 °C 
for the given time. All the initial activity values are below that corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for propylene yield, which is close to 70% 
(assuming 100% selectivity to propylene). Analyses were carried out on an on-line GC with an automated sample injector, with an error within ±3% for 
each data point. g, Initial specific activity for the production of propylene with the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst after different pre-reduction treatments at 600 °C.

and catalytic performances of supported Pt catalysts reported in 
the recent literature (see Supplementary Table 1); the initial activ-
ity of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h sample on a per mol Pt basis 
is amongst the highest, at the same time that the deactivation rate 
is amongst the lowest. Compared with our previous work (catalyst 
activated by reduction for 1 h at 600 °C in H2)17, the optimized acti-
vation conditions developed in the current work lead to a sevenfold 
decrease in the deactivation constant.
On the basis of the above results, it can be deduced that a long 
reduction treatment at 600 °C is necessary to form subnanometric 
Pt clusters modified with partially reduced SnOx species that show 
high activity, selectivity and stability for propane dehydrogenation. 
In additional experiments, we observed that a shorter pre-reduction 
treatment (1 h) of the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample at higher tempera-
ture (700 °C) also resulted in subnanometric PtSn clusters in the 
sinusoidal channels (Supplementary Fig. 64) that showed similar 
high selectivity and a very low deactivation rate in the propane 
dehydrogenation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 65).
The amount of coke in the K-PtSn@MFI samples after the 
propane dehydrogenation reaction was analysed by thermo-
gravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry. As shown in 
Supplementary Figs. 66–71, the amount of coke in all the samples 
remained below 1 wt%, but no correlation between stability and 
the amount of deposited coke was found. The coke in the used 
catalysts was also studied by Raman spectroscopy. As shown in 
Supplementary Fig. 72, the ratio of the D and G bands ranges 
from 0.45 to 0.5 for all the samples, exhibiting only minor differ-
ences (see Supplementary Table 2). Therefore, it can be concluded 
that the amount of coke and its physicochemical properties seem 
to be similar for all the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2 samples after dif-
ferent pre-reduction times. From a structural point of view, the 
PtSn clusters are mainly located in the sinusoidal channels. Even 
though coke formation is associated with catalytic events occur-
ring at the metal surface, the resulting carbonaceous species seem 
not to remain directly blocking the active sites. The extended life-
times of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-
22h samples could be associated with much less deposition of 
coke on the PtSn clusters, leading to lower deactivation rates46. 
Because the deposition of coke on Pt-based catalysts for the pro-
pane dehydrogenation reaction is related to the chemical com-
position of the bimetallic PtM particles47, the results presented 
indicate that a minimal interaction between the two metals is suf-
ficient to suppress most of the coke formation, provided that the 
active species remain small (in the subnanometric regime) during 
the lifetime of the catalyst .
Finally, to show the potential of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst acti-
vated under the optimized conditions, we tested the catalytic perfor-
mance of K-PtSn@MFI under more industrially relevant conditions 
(for example, no N2 dilution) for the propane dehydrogenation 
reaction. As presented in Supplementary Fig. 73, the K-PtSn@MFI 
catalyst showed an initial propane conversion of ~20% at 550 °C, 
and a high initial selectivity to propylene (>97%) under a high 
weight hourly space velocity of ~118 h−1. After nearly 70 h of time on 
stream, the propane conversion decreased very slowly from ~20 to 
~17%, demonstrating the outstanding performance of the K-PtSn@
MFI catalyst in this reaction.
Conclusions
The geometric and electronic structures of subnanometric bimetal-
lic clusters in confined space may be different from the correspond-
ing nanoparticles supported on open-structure carriers, which can 
lead to unique reactivity. Combining multiple in situ characteriza-
tion techniques (both averaging techniques such as EXAFS and 
site-specific techniques such as IR and TEM) is critical to elucidat-
ing the nature of the active sites in supported catalysts containing 
isolated atoms and/or clusters48.
Methods
One-pot synthesis of the K-PtSn@MFI sample. First, a tetrapropylammonium 
hydroxide (TPAOH) solution was prepared by mixing 5.0 g K-free TPAOH 
solution (40 wt%, Alfa-Aesar without K), 6.24 g TPAOH (20 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich, 
containing ~0.6 wt% of K) and 17.0 g distilled water at room temperature. Then, 
8.24 g tetraethyl orthosilicate was hydrolysed with the TPAOH solution at room 
temperature for 6 h under stirring (500 r.p.m.). The resultant solution was divided 
into two parts with the same weight. To each portion of solution, 80 μl aqueous 
H2[PtCl6] (0.38 mol l−1), 50 mg SnCl4·5H2O and 150 μl ethylenediamine were added 
to the above solution and the mixture stirred for 20 min. The resultant yellow 
solution was then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated in an electric 
oven at 175 °C for 96 h under static conditions. The amounts of Pt, Sn and K in the 
final product were ~0.4, ~0.9 and ~0.6 wt%, respectively. After the hydrothermal 
process, the solid product was isolated by filtration, washed with distilled water and 
acetone, and dried at 60 °C. Then, the solid sample was calcined under a flow of air 
at 560 °C for 8 h and then at 600 °C for 2 h.
Characterization. Powder X-ray diffraction was performed with a HTPhilips 
X’Pert MPD diffractometer equipped with a PW3050 goniometer using Cu Kα 
radiation and a multisampling handler.
Samples for electron microscopy studies were prepared by dropping a 
suspension of the solid sample in CH2Cl2 directly onto holey carbon-coated copper 
grids. Electron microscopy measurements were performed using two types of 
microscopes. Thus, a non-corrected JEOL 2100F microscope operating at 200 kV 
both in transmission (TEM) and scanning transmission modes (STEM) was used 
to record the HAADF Z-contrast images at low resolution. HR-HAADF-STEM and 
iDPC imaging were performed on a double aberration-corrected, monochromated 
FEI Titan3 Themis 60–300 microscope operating at 300 kV. The latter technique 
provides atomically resolved images in which the contrasts are related to the atomic 
number of the elements under the beam instead of the roughly Z2-dependent 
contrasts obtained in the HAADF-STEM images. By using a four-segment detector, 
this technique allows imaging of light elements, such as O, in the presence of 
heavier ones (Si, Z = 14) under very low electron dose conditions, which is a key 
aspect of the atomic-scale structural analysis of zeolites, which are very sensitive to 
electron beams. In particular, 2,048 × 2,048 STEM-iDPC image pairs were recorded 
simultaneously using a convergence angle of 18.6 mrad and a camera length of 
91 mm. This configuration allowed us to optimize the collection of signals on the 
HAADF and FEI DF4 detectors. To limit the damage by the electron beam, a fast 
image recording protocol was used by combining a beam current of 10–30 pA, a 
1.25–2.5 μs dwell time and an automated fine-tuning alignment of A1 and C1 using 
the OptiSTEM software. To obtain images of good quality, the beam current and 
image acquisition time should be optimized according to the stability of the sample 
under the beam.
For the quasi in situ TEM studies of the K-PtSn@MFI samples, a pristine 
K-PtSn@MFI-Air powder sample was reduced in a flow of H2 at 600 °C for a 
given time (1–22 h), and then the reactor for reduction treatment was closed and 
transferred to a glove box. The grid for TEM measurements was prepared in the 
glove box to protect samples from oxidation by air. After sample preparation, the 
TEM grid was sealed in the vacuum transfer TEM holder and then transferred to 
the electron microscope for STEM-iDPC measurements.
To determine the spatial distribution of the metallic species within the zeolite 
framework, a specific methodology for the digital analysis of the experimental 
images was developed and coded in a home-made Matlab script. First, to 
improve the signal-to-noise ratio, the HR-HAADF-STEM images were de-noised 
by combining the Anscombe transform and undecimated wavelet transforms 
(UWVT)49. Then, a user-independent, fully automated segmentation of image 
contrasts by clustering techniques (K-means method) was applied to recognize 
and classify the metallic entities, which is a requirement to guarantee statistically 
meaningful and unbiased results.
To support the K-means clustering analysis and interpret the details of the 
experimental images, the HR-HAADF-STEM images were simulated using 
the TEMSIM software50. The complex structural models used as input in these 
simulations were built using the Rhodius software developed at Universidad de 
Cadiz51. To approach as close as possible the experimental imaging conditions, a 
mixture of Poisson and white Gaussian noise was added to the simulated images. 
Then, the same methodology used to analyse the experimental images was applied 
to the deliberately noise-corrupted simulated images.
XAS experiments at the Pt LIII (11,564 eV) and Sn K (29,200 eV) edges 
were performed in the ALBA synchrotron52. The beam was monochromatized 
using Si(111) and Si(311) double crystals, respectively; harmonic rejection was 
performed using rhodium-coated silicon mirrors. The spectra were collected in 
transmission (Pt LIII-edge) and fluorescence (Sn K-edge) modes using ionization 
chambers filled with the appropriate gases (Pt LIII-edge: 95% N2 + 5% Kr for I0 and 
17.1% N2 + 82.9% Kr for I1; Sn K-edge: 89.4% N2 + 10.6% Kr for I0 and 100% Kr for 
I1) and a fluorescence solid-state detector. Samples in the form of self-supported 
pellets of optimized thickness were positioned inside an in-house built 
multipurpose cell described by Guilera et al., allowing in situ experiments53. Several 
scans were acquired at each measurement step to ensure spectral reproducibility 
and good signal-to-noise ratio. Data reduction and extraction of the χ(k) function

were performed using the ATHENA code. EXAFS data analysis was performed 
using the ARTEMIS software54. The phase and amplitudes were calculated using 
the FEFF6 code. The values of E0 (inflection point in the first derivative of the 
XANES spectra) used for data alignment taken from the literature are as follows: 
29,200 eV for Sn metal, 29,201 eV for SnO, 29,204 eV for SnO2 and 11,564 eV  
for Pt metal.
The IR spectra of adsorbed CO on Pt−zeolite and Sn−zeolite samples were 
recorded at room temperature with a Nexus 8700 FTIR spectrometer using a 
deuterated-triglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector at 4 cm−1 resolution. The K-PtSn@
MFI samples were reduced at 600 °C in an oven for different times and then 
transferred to an IR cell connected to a vacuum system with a gas dosing facility, 
allowing in situ treatments in controlled atmospheres at temperatures from 25 to 
500 °C . For the IR studies, the samples were pressed into self-supported wafers 
and pre-treated in a flow of H2 at 450 °C for 2 h, followed by vacuum treatment 
(10−5 mbar). After activation, the samples were cooled to 25 °C under dynamic 
vacuum conditions, followed by CO dosing at increasing pressure (0.4–8.5 mbar). 
IR spectra were recorded after each dosage of CO. The dispersion of Pt in K-PtSn@
MFI samples was estimated from CO adsorption using the double isotherm 
method on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1C instrument55,56. Prior to adsorption, 
the samples (200–300 mg) were reduced in situ in a flow of pure H2 (25 ml min–1) 
at 600 °C for a given time. After the reduction treatment, the samples were 
degassed at 1.33 Pa for 2 h at 600 °C and then cooled to ~40 °C. Then pure CO 
was admitted and the first adsorption isotherm (that is, the total CO uptake) was 
measured. After evacuation at 25 °C, the second isotherm (that is, the reversible 
CO uptake) was measured. The amount of chemisorbed CO was then obtained by 
subtracting the two isotherms. The pressure range studied was (0.5–11) × 104 Pa. 
The dispersion of Pt (D) was calculated from the amount of irreversibly adsorbed 
CO, assuming a stoichiometry of Pt/CO = 1. The mean particle size (d) of Pt was 
determined from the chemisorption data, assuming a spherical geometry for the 
metal particle according to the procedure. Equations (1)–(3) were used to calculate 
the dispersion of Pt:
D %
ð
Þ ¼ Nm ´ Fs ´ M ´ 104=L
ð1Þ
where Nm is the chemisorption uptake, expressed in mol CO per gram sample,  
Fs is the adsorption stoichiometry, which is 1 in our measurement, M is the 
molecular mass of the supported metal (Pt) and L is the loading of the  
supported metal.
d ¼ 6 ´ L= Sa ´ Z ´ 100
ð
Þ
ð2Þ
where d is the mean particle size, Z is the density of the supported metal (Pt) and Sa 
is the active surface area (m2 per gram metal), calculated from equation (3):
Sa ¼ Nm ´ Fs ´ Am ´ Na
ð3Þ
where Am is the cross-sectional area occupied by each active surface Pt atom and Na 
is Avogadro’s constant.
Trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO, Alfa Aesar) was adsorbed on the different 
catalysts as probe molecules by deposition in dichloromethane solution to study 
the coordination environment of Sn species by NMR spectroscopy. First, all 
the catalysts were degassed for 4 h under dynamic vacuum at 573 K to remove 
any adsorbed water molecules. They were then transferred to a glove box to 
prevent any exposure to moisture, which could interact with the metal sites 
in the catalysts or with TMPO molecules. A solution of 0.02 wt% TMPO was 
prepared with anhydrous dichloromethane in a glove box. Then, 0.3 g of this 
solution was added to each catalyst (75 mg) in a vial and the samples were left to 
stir overnight. Dichloromethane was fully removed by heating at 353 K for 6 h. 
Samples dosed with TMPO were packed under an inert atmosphere into zirconia 
magic-angle-spinning NMR rotors with gas-tight caps for analysis. The metal 
and phosphorus contents were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic 
emission spectroscopy analysis to determine the TMPO/M ratio.
Catalytic studies of K-PtSn@MFI for propane dehydrogenation reactions. 
The reactions were performed in a fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure 
using N2/propane as feed gas at 600 °C. The products were analysed by GC, which 
can detect cracking products (methane, ethene and ethane), propylene, C4 and C5 
compounds, and aromatics. Before the reactions, the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst was 
reduced in a flow of H2 (35 ml min–1) at 600 °C for a given time with a ramp rate of 
10 °C min–1 from room temperature up to 600 °C. After reduction pre-treatment, 
the atmosphere was changed to the reaction feed gas (5 ml min–1 propane and 
16 ml min–1 N2 as balance gas). The analysis was carried out on an on-line  
GC with an automated sample injector, which gave an error within ±3% for  
each data point.
