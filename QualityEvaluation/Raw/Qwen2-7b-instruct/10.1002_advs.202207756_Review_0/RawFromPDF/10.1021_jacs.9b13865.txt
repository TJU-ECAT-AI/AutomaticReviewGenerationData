Abstract
The study of the formation, characterization, and functionality of isolated surface hydrides on solid materials is a formidable task because of the complexity of solid surfaces and the difficulty of analyzing structures in solids. Herein, we found the formation of indium (In) hydride species supported by CHA zeolites. The In hydrides were formed by treatment of an In-exchanged CHA zeolite (In-CHA) with H2 at high temperatures (>773 K). In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that an [InH2]+ ion on a framework anionic site is a plausible structure. In-CHA exhibited high selectivity and durable catalytic activity for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane for at least 90 h. Kinetic and in situ spectroscopic studies as well as transition state (TS) calculations suggested that [InH2]+ ions serve as catalytically active sites for selective dehydrogenation using In-CHA.

Introduction
Hydrides in/on solid materials have attracted significant attention in many research fields, including energy engineering, (1−4) electrochemistry, (5−7) and catalysis. (8,9) In catalysis, hydrides on solid surfaces have been involved in heterogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and hydrogenolysis. Hydrides on metallic surfaces exhibit high mobility, while surface hydrides on metal oxides are considered to be relatively stable due to their site isolation (isolated surface hydrides). (8,9) Various reports regarding the formation of surface hydrides on metal oxides (10−16) and metals (17−23) have been published for more than 40 years. Their formation from H2 is induced by heterolytic activation on pair sites of metal (M) and oxygen (O) atoms (M–O bonds on metal oxides, unbonded M and O pairs, and interface of metal and supports) or homolytic activation on metallic surfaces or on metal oxides that involves reduction of the metal centers. Several metal oxides and supported metal nanoparticles have the potential to promote efficient hydrogenations, dehydrogenations, and deoxygenations, where surface metal hydrides were proposed as key intermediates, regardless of the presence or absence of experimental evidence. As another approach, syntheses of well-regulated metal hydrides on metal oxides via surface organometallic chemistry have been developed. This method involves immobilization of well-defined metal–alkyl complexes on oxides and subsequent reaction with H2 to promote the hydrogenolysis of M–carbon bonds, affording supported metal hydrides. A number of supported transition-metal hydride complexes of Co, (24) Ti, (25) Zr, (26,27) Ru, (28,29) Rh, (30) Hf, (31) Ta, (32) W, (33) Os, (34) and Ir (35) were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques (infrared (IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and/or electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)) and described to exhibit unique catalytic properties for hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, metathesis, and polymerization reactions. As described above, a great deal of continuous effort has been devoted to studies of the isolated surface hydrides and their catalysis. However, detailed characterizations are challenging due to the complexity and analytical difficulty of solid surfaces. For catalysis, surface metal hydrides are often involved in the reaction as transient and/or unstable intermediates, and consequently, the details of the structures and catalytic functions remain unclear. Research on the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic function of the isolated surface hydrides is an attractive but formidable task.
Aluminosilicate zeolites are well-defined porous frameworks that consist of four-coordinate [SiO4] or [AlO4] subunits. Various cations can be stabilized at the framework anionic [AlO4]− sites in their pores, and the number of sites can be changed by controlling the Si/Al ratio of the zeolites. (36,37) A few zeolite-supported metal hydrides containing Ga, Zn, Ag, and Rh have been developed, and Ga hydrides on ZSM-5 have been the most thoroughly investigated. The formation of Ga hydrides in ZSM-5 was first indicated by Iglesia and coworkers during in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements under an H2 atmosphere at high temperature. (38) Subsequently, Hensen and coworkers detected Ga hydrides by diffuse reflectance infrared transform (DRIFT) measurements and proposed detailed structures that included [GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+. (39,40) These structures were well supported by vibration frequency calculations. (41) Their catalytic properties for dehydrogenation/cracking of light alkanes, which are elementary steps of industrially important dehydrocyclization reactions, (42) have been experimentally and theoretically investigated. (41,43−45) Zn hydrides on ZSM-5 are formed via H2 treatment of Zn-exchanged ZSM-5 (46,47) and are considered as intermediates for the dehydrogenation of alkanes. (48) For Ag-exchanged zeolites, H2 treatment afforded Ag-clustered hydride species (Ag3H) via a multiple-step reaction. (49) The synthesis of Rh(CO)(H)x via reaction of dealuminated Y zeolite immobilized Rh(CO)2 has also been reported. (50) The aforementioned studies demonstrated that zeolites have potential as effective supports for the formation of isolated surface hydrides and catalytic applications, motivating the development of surface hydride species and unique catalysis.
Herein, we found the formation of indium (In) hydrides by H2 treatment of In-exchanged CHA zeolite (In-CHA). No reports regarding isolated In hydrides in zeolites have been published, although an isolated hydride on indium oxides has been reported very recently by Ozin and coworkers (16) The formation and detailed structure of In hydrides in CHA zeolites was investigated by in situ Fourier transform IR (FTIR) and XAFS spectroscopy as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In-CHA showed high selectivity and durability for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in comparison to Ga- and Zn-exchanged CHA zeolites. A mechanistic investigation based on kinetic, in situ spectroscopic, and theoretical studies indicated that [InH2]+ ions are potential catalytically active sites.
Experimental Section
In-CHA was prepared via a reductive solid-state ion-exchange (RSSIE) methodology. (51) Briefly, In2O3 supported on the proton-type CHA (In2O3/CHA) was synthesized through impregnation of In(NO3)3·nH2O (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) in the NH4+-type CHA zeolite (Tosoh, SiO2/Al2O3 = 22.3), followed by drying in an oven and calcination under air for 1 h at 773 K. Afterward, the RSSIE reaction of In2O3/CHA was conducted in the presence of H2 at 773 K, affording In-CHA as a white powder. The In/Al ratio was determined on the basis of the amounts of In precursor and CHA zeolites. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) analysis was performed using a Shimadzu EDX-700 instrument, where the In/Al ratio obtained by XRF measurements was 0.37 and 0.76 for the In-CHA prepared with theoretical In/Al ratios of 0.4 and 0.8, respectively. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a Rigaku MiniFlex II/AP diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. For FTIR spectroscopic experiments, the In-CHA disk was prepared in situ in a quartz reactor from a self-supported disk of In2O3/CHA. The background spectrum was obtained after in situ preparation of In-CHA followed by vacuum treatment at 773 K. The In K-edge XAFS measurement was performed using the BL14B2 station at SPring-8, JASRI in transmission mode (Proposal Nos. 2019A1614 and 2019B1686). A flow reaction system with a flow-type cell was used for in situ measurements, and all XAFS spectra were recorded at room temperature (298 K). Athena (Demeter 0.9.26) was used for X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended XAFS (EXAFS) analyses. Ethane dehydrogenation using In-CHA was investigated using a fixed-bed continuous flow system at 933 K. First, 100 mg of In2O3/CHA was introduced into a quartz reactor with quartz wool as a catalyst bed. After H2 treatment at 773 K for 0.5 h followed by He purging, the temperature was increased to 933 K and 10 mL/min of 10% C2H6/He was subsequently introduced. The conversions, yields, and selectivities were determined by GC analysis (Shimadzu GC-14B with a SHINCARBON ST column). Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was performed under a 50% O2/50% He atmosphere while CO2 generated through coke oxidation was monitored. DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) with a periodic boundary condition under the Kohn–Sham formulation. During the calculations, all atoms were allowed to relax fully. For vibration calculations, all atoms except for the In hydrides were fixed. Free energies were calculated at 873 K, 0.02 atm of ethane, 0.0002 atm of ethylene, and 0.0002 atm of H2 on the basis of the experimental conditions of kinetic studies. Further details regarding the experimental conditions and calculation are described in the Supporting Information.
Results and Discussion
In Situ FTIR Measurement of In Hydrides in CHA
The in situ FTIR measurement of In-CHA treated with H2 at 773 K (In-CHA(H2)) was performed. The FTIR spectrum of In-CHA(H2) exhibited a band with a maximum at 1720 cm–1 (Figure 1A) arising from In–H stretching vibrations. (16,52) This band remained unchanged even at 473 K, indicating the relatively high stability of the In hydrides. However, when ethylene was introduced at 473 K, this band disappeared and new bands with maxima at 2957, 2930, and 2875 cm–1 appeared (Figure 1B,C), corresponding to the C–H stretching vibrations of the adsorbed ethane and/or ethyl fragments. (53) This indicated that the introduced ethylene reacted with the In hydrides. As control experiments, D2 was used instead of H2 for the above measurements. After D2 treatment (denoted as In-CHA(D2)), no bands around 1720 cm–1 were observed (Figure 1A), indicating the shift of the band at 1720 cm–1. However, the expected new band at 1219 cm–1 was not observed because of overlap with the strong peak derived from the zeolite framework. After the reaction of ethylene with In-CHA(D2), the resulting spectrum showed new bands with maxima at 2208 and 2171 cm–1, assignable to the C–D vibration of partially deuterated ethane (CDH2CDH2) and/or corresponding ethyl fragments (54) (Figure 1D), suggesting the formation of In deuteride species after D2 treatment. These FTIR spectroscopic studies demonstrated the presence of In hydrides in In-CHA.

To support the formation of In hydrides, we conducted an H–D exchange reaction. In in situ FTIR measurements, the treatment of In-CHA(H2) with D2 at 373 K caused a decrease in the band derived from ν(In–H) and this band disappeared upon heating to 473 K (Figure 2A). When this D2-treated sample was exposed to H2 at 473 K, a band assignable to ν(In–H) appeared again. The gas-phase products were also analyzed by mass spectroscopy during the H–D exchange reaction with an increase in the temperature from 313 to 473 K (for details, see the Supporting Information). The reaction of In-CHA(H2) with D2 afforded a positive peak for m/z = 3 with a negative peak for m/z = 4 around 373–473 K (Figure 2B), while a peak for m/z = 2 was hardly observed. In the reverse reaction, namely In-CHA(D2) with H2, a positive peak for m/z = 3 and a negative peak for m/z = 2 were observed and the signal for m/z = 4 did not show any peak (Figure S1). These results show the reversible nature of the H–D exchange reaction (In-CHA(H2) with D2 as well as In-CHA(D2) with H2) and that the gas-phase product is mainly HD rather than H2 or D2. A control experiment using proton-type CHA (H-CHA) instead of In-CHA (H2-treated H-CHA with D2) was conducted where no peak was observed for all signals, supporting the occurrence of an H–D exchange reaction between In hydrides and D2 (Figure 2B). The above results of H–D exchange reactions strongly indicate the formation of In hydrides in In-CHA after H2 treatment. A shoulder peak at around 1660 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum after D2 treatment of In-CHA(H2) at 373 K (Figure 2A) may be assigned to the stretching vibration of In–H of partially deuterated In hydrides. The lower wavenumber in comparison to that of In hydrides was reported in the previous paper concerning InH2 and InHD. (55) This interpretation is consistent with the formation of HD as a main product during H–D exchange reactions.

DFT Calculations for Frequency Analysis and Origin of Stability of the In Hydrides
To support the formation of In hydrides and further examine their structures, the frequencies of In–H vibrations for several In hydride models were calculated and compared with the experimental results. (41) Several types of In hydride models were considered: [InH2]+ on a single [AlO4]− site (Z[InH2], where Z denotes one [AlO4]− site), a [InH2]+-H+ cation pair on two [AlO4]− sites (Z[H]/Z[InH2]), and [InH]2+ on two [AlO4]− sites (Z2[InH]). For the Z2 sites, five paired sites were used as second-nearest-neighbors (2NN) in a six-membered-ring (6MR) (denoted as 6MR(2NN)), 6MR(3NN), 8MR(2NN), 8MR(3NN), and 8MR(4NN) on the basis of previous theoretical studies for metal-exchanged CHA zeolites (56,57) (all optimized structure files are given in the Supporting Information). The calculated frequencies of the possible [InH2]+ and [InH]2+ ions are summarized in Table 1. The frequencies of νsym(In–H) for [InH2]+ models are 1721–1736 cm–1, in much better agreement with that for maximum absorption in the experiment (1720 cm–1) in comparison to the frequencies of νasym(In–H) (1787–1810 cm–1). For [InH]2+, the frequencies of the three models (Z2[InH2] on 6MR(2NN), 6MR(3NN), and 8MR(2NN)) were calculated to be 1763–1793 cm–1, which are similar to those of νasym(In–H) for [InH2]+, while the other two models, Z2[InH2] on 8MR(3NN) and 8MR(4NN), were not available due to the conversion of Z2[InH] affording Z[H]/Z[In] during geometry optimization. The band around 1700–1800 cm–1 can be deconvoluted into a main peak at 1717 cm–1 and a minor peak at 1781 cm–1 (Figure S2). On the basis of the results of frequency analysis and deconvolution of the band, [InH2]+ ions are likely to be formed as the main In hydrides on both Z and Z2 sites and [InH]2+ ions possibly exist as a minor species on the Z2 sites with shorter Al–Al distances. Hereinafter, Z[InH2] was adopted as the model of In hydrides in CHA for further calculations (Figure 3).

It is well-known that In hydrides such as indane (InH3) easily decompose below room temperature. (52,58) Despite the significant effort that has been devoted to obtaining thermal stability by complexation with bulky ligands, few examples of indane complexes exhibiting room-temperature stability have been reported. (59,60) To obtain further insight regarding the formation and stability of CHA-supported In hydrides, transition state (TS) calculations for the interconversion between Z[InH2] and Z[In] were performed (Figure 3). The desorption of H2 from Z[InH2] is exothermic, while the activation enthalpy (ΔH⧧) was determined to be 262.8 kJ/mol. For the direct formation of Z[InH2] from Z[In] with H2, ΔH⧧ was calculated to be 342.9 kJ/mol. In the indirect pathway, the heterolytic cleavage of H2 on Z[In] into Z[H] and InH requires a lower ΔH⧧ value of 242.3 kJ/mol and the generated intermediates are converted to Z[InH2] without any barrier. The free energy profiles also show the lower energy values for the indirect pathway in comparison to the direct pathway (Figure S3). These TS calculations indicate that [InH2]+ ion formation requires high temperatures and the ions are thermodynamically unstable but kinetically stable. The obtained results support the formation and stability of In hydrides at high temperatures observed in the FTIR measurements.
In Situ XAFS Measurement
In K-edge XAFS measurement of In-CHA under a H2 atmosphere was conducted. It should be noted that the in situ XAFS measurement during RRSIE from In2O3/CHA to In-CHA at 773 K was reported previously (61) and the measurement for In-CHA after RSSIE under a H2 atmosphere at room temperature (298 K) was the focus herein. The XANES spectrum of In-CHA showed an absorption edge (E0) at E0 = 27928.1 eV, lower than that of In2O3/CHA (E0 = 27932.1 eV) by ca. 4 eV and different from that of In foil (E0 = 27929.6 eV; Figure 3A). A similar edge shift after RSSIE was reported in in situ Ga K-edge XAFS measurement of Ga zeolites, although the structure of Ga species after RSSIE (Ga+ cation or Ga hydrides) remains a topic of considerable debate. Iglesia and coworkers first reported the edge shift in XANES spectra (ΔE0 = 4.7 eV) during H2 treatment of Ga-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolites obtained through impregnation of Ga(NO3)3 at a high temperature of 783 K and suggested the possibility of a monomeric Ga hydride species at basic oxygen sties in zeolites. (38) Other groups reported an edge shift toward lower energies during the H2 treatment of Ga zeolites prepared by the impregnation method (62,63) or chemical vapor deposition of trimethylgallium, (64) while each group indicated that the Ga species after H2 treatment were Ga+ cations. Hock et al. compared the XANES spectrum of Ga-exchanged BEA zeolites after H2 treatment with those of several Ga3+ alkyl complexes as zeolite-coordinated Ga hydride analogues. (65) The authors proposed that the edge shift after H2 treatment could be considered as evidence of the formation of Ga hydrides. The same group also discussed the shift of absorption edge in the In K-edge XANES spectra of SiO2-supported In ions during H2 treatment by comparison with several In alkyl complexes and claimed that the formation of In hydrides occurred despite the unsuccessful observation of In–H groups by other spectroscopic techniques. (66) As described above, the interpretation of the edge shift during H2 treatment remains controversial for Ga zeolites and few studies on XANES for H2-treated supported In ions are available.
The XAFS spectrum of In-CHA showed no scattering peak in the EXAFS region (Figure 4A). EXAFS analysis revealed that the scattering peak from In–O of the In–In shell was hardly observed in the FT of the EXAFS spectrum (Figure 4B). A similar disappearance of EXAFS features during H2 reduction was reported in the in situ XAFS measurement by Iglesia et al., as mentioned above. In combination with the different adsorption edge in comparison to that of Ga metal, the authors proposed the formation of a monomeric Ga hydride species at basic oxygen sites in zeolites. (38) Although XAFS measurements generally do not provide direct evidence for the formation of metal hydrides, the large energy shift in the XANES spectra and disappearance of EXAFS features clearly indicated the immobilization of reduced monomeric In species in CHA zeolites. The formation of monomeric In species was supported by the XRD measurements, where the peaks derived from bulk In2O3 disappeared after RSSIE, while the diffraction pattern of the CHA zeolite was maintained (Figure S4).

Nonoxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane
The dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, which is an important and fundamental transformation, (67,68) was investigated using several catalysts, including In-CHA. Thermal cracking of ethane at high reaction temperatures (>1173 K) is utilized industrially, but rapid cooling of the outlet gas (<1073 K) and very short contact times are required to suppress undesired reactions of the obtained ethylene. (69) Catalytic nonoxidative dehydrogenation is a promising alternative because of the absence of an oxidant and coformation of H2. To date, various metal catalyst systems containing Cr, (70,71) Ga, (72−74) and Pt-based alloys (75−78) have been studied for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. In this context, In has attracted significant attention as an effective additive to enhance the activity/selectivity of Pt-based catalysts. (79−81) However, catalyst systems utilizing In as the main active species have been rarely reported, (82,83) and their dehydrogenation catalysis has not been fully explored.
Ethane dehydrogenation was conducted using In-CHA at 933 K, and the time courses of ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity are shown in Figure 5A,B, with the values after 0.5, 20, and 90 h being provided in Table 2. In-CHA promoted the dehydrogenation in 96.1% selectivity for ethylene in 25.9% ethane conversion at 0.5 h without cofeeding of H2. The selectivity and conversion values were maintained for at least 90 h (27.2% conversion and 96.9% selectivity). During the reaction, CH4 was formed as a side product in ca. 3% selectivity and the carbon balance was >98%. The effect of the In/Al ratio on the catalysis of In-CHA was also investigated. The carbon balance increased with increasing In/Al ratio from 0.2 to 0.8 (Figure 5C). This dependence on the In/Al ratio was likely due to the decreased Brønsted acid sites with increasing In/Al ratio, as revealed by the NH3 adsorption experiment monitored via FTIR spectroscopy. The FTIR spectrum for H-CHA showed a strong peak at approximately 1470 cm–1 derived from the adsorbed NH3 on the Brønsted acid sites, (84) and the absorbance decreased with an increasing In/Al ratio of In-CHA. The extent of the decreased peak area was roughly proportional to the In/Al ratio (Figure S4), and a higher loading of In ions decreased the amount of Brønsted acid sites, resulting in an improved carbon balance.

Ga- and Zn-exchanged CHA zeolites (Ga- and Zn-CHA, M/Al = 0.8) were also prepared and compared with In-CHA. Ga- and Zn-CHA exhibited much lower selectivities (Table 2, 76.1% and 67.3%, respectively), while the conversion values were higher at 0.5 h (57.4% and 47.6%, respectively). Their activities decreased with increasing reaction time, resulting in conversions lower than that observed for the In-CHA after 20 h. The conversion values for In-, Ga-, and Zn-CHA at 20 h were 27.2%, 22.4%, and 18.6%, respectively. The TPO measurement of the catalysts used for the 2 h reaction (Figure 5D) revealed much more formation of coke for Ga- and Zn-CHA in comparison with In-CHA. In-CHA was also compared with Ga-exchanged ZSM-5 (Ga-ZSM-5) and Al2O3-supported PtSn and PtGa catalysts (PtSn/Al2O3 and PtGa/Al2O3), which have been widely studied for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These catalysts were gradually deactivated due to coke formation (Figure 5B), resulting in lower conversions (22.0% for Ga-ZSM-5 at 20 h, 21.4% for PtSn/Al2O3 at 90 h, 19.7% for PtGa/Al2O3 at 20 h) in comparison to In-CHA, although PtSn/Al2O3 exhibited better durability in comparison with the Ga- and Zn-exchanged zeolites and PtGa/Al2O3. Furthermore, the relationship between conversion and selectivity was obtained for In-CHA, Ga-ZSM-5, and PtSn/Al2O3 by changing the temperature and then compared (Figure 5E). For PtSn/Al2O3 and Ga-ZSM-5, the selectivity values dropped below 95% when the conversion reached above 30%. In contrast, In-CHA showed a better selectivity of 95.7% with 36.8% conversion.
After the 90 h reaction using In-CHA, the catalyst was treated with O2/He at 873 K, reduced using H2/He at 873 K, and subsequently reused for catalysis of the dehydrogenation reaction (for further details, see the Supporting Information). The conversion and selectivity values remained almost constant for at least 20 h in comparison to the fresh In-CHA (Figure 5A), indicating the reusability of In-CHA. The XRD pattern of the used In-CHA exhibited a diffraction pattern similar to those of the fresh In-CHA and H-CHA (Figure S4), consistent with the good reusability observed for In-CHA. In addition, a dehydrogenation at a higher temperature of 973 K was conducted. In-CHA showed a higher conversion of 37.4% with high selectivity (95.1% selectivity, 98% carbon balance) at 30 min (Figure 6). The conversion slowly decreased to 31.2% by extending the reaction time to 40 h, while the high selectivity was retained (>96% selectivity and >98% carbon balance) during the reaction. After the regeneration of the used In-CHA (O2/He, 873 K) followed by H2 treatment, the catalyst exhibited catalytic performance similar to that of the fresh catalyst (35.8% conversion and 97.4% selectivity), showing that In-CHA was regenerable. These results demonstrate the high selectivity and durability of In-CHA for dehydrogenation of ethane at high reaction temperatures, which is advantageous from the perspective of the endothermic nature of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

Kinetic Study of Ethane Dehydrogenation Catalyzed by In- and Ga-CHA
To discuss active In species for dehydrogenation, kinetic studies were performed for Ga- and In-CHA. Bell and coworkers recently reported mechanistic and kinetic studies of the dehydrogenation/cracking of propane using Ga-exchanged ZSM-5, indicating that the dehydrogenation reaction rate decreased with increasing partial pressure of H2 (p(H2)) and that the reaction order of p(H2) was −0.1 to −0.3. (85) The authors proposed that [GaH]2+ on two [AlO4]− sites were the active sites and that the inhibition by H2 could be ascribed to the conversion of [GaH]2+ to [GaH2]+-H+ cation pairs via competitive adsorption of H2 with propane. In the kinetic study described herein for the dehydrogenation of ethane using Ga-CHA (Figure 7A,B), similar phenomena were observed. Increasing p(H2) inhibited the dehydrogenation, and the reaction order of p(H2) was determined to be −0.24 (Figure 7A). In contrast to the Ga zeolites, ethane dehydrogenation using In-CHA was hardly inhibited by H2 and exhibited zero-order kinetics with respect to H2 (the reaction order of p(H2) is −0.04; Figure 7A), indicating that competitive adsorption of H2 with ethane is unlikely. The reaction orders of p(C2H6) were determined to be 0.85 and 0.92 for Ga-CHA and In-CHA, respectively (Figure 7B). The effect of the M/Al ratio (M = In, Ga) on the ethylene formation rate was also examined. The formation rate almost doubled with an increase in the In/Al ratio from 0.4 to 0.8 for In-CHA, while an increase in the Ga/Al ratio from 0.4 to 0.8 did not increase the formation rate with the Ga-CHA catalyst (Figure 7C). Therefore, it is likely that the [InH2]+ ion or an In+ cation coordinated to one [AlO4]− site, acting as plausible active sites rather than the [InH]2+ ion coordinating to two [AlO4]− sites. This interpretation is supported by the NH3 adsorption experiment in Figure S5. The experimental activation enthalpy (ΔH⧧exp) for In-CHA was determined to be 236 kJ/mol from the Eyring plot, which is approximately twice that obtained for Ga-CHA (ΔH⧧exp = 108 kJ/mol; Figure 7D).

TS Calculations for Ethane Dehydrogenation on Possible In Species in CHA
TS calculations for dehydrogenation on In hydrides (Z[InH2] and Z2[InH]) and In+ cations were performed and then the highest ΔH⧧ values and the corresponding elementary steps were compared. Six mechanisms (concerted, alkyl, or σ-bond metathesis mechanism on [InH2]+ ions, carbenium or alkyl mechanism on [InH]2+ ions, and alkyl mechanism on In+ cations) were considered according to previous theoretical studies regarding the dehydrogenation of light alkanes catalyzed by Ga zeolites (41,43,45) and the CH4 activation on a silica-supported Zr hydride catalyst. (86) The obtained enthalpy profiles are described by solid lines in Figures 8–10. In the concerted mechanism on Z[InH2], as shown in Figure 8A, cleavage of C–H bonds and formation of dehydrogenation products (ethylene and H2) simultaneously occur after ethane adsorption. This step is endothermic (ΔH = 149.4 kJ/mol), and ΔH⧧ was estimated to be 213.9 kJ/mol. The generated ethylene and H2 desorb smoothly, regenerating Z[InH2]. In the alkyl mechanism (Figure 8B), an [InH2]+ ion tilts from the 8MR side toward the 6MR side before adsorption of ethane. After adsorption, the cleavage of the first C–H bond occurs to afford [InH2(C2H5)] and Z[H] (first step). Next, a coordinated hydride transfer from [InH2(C2H5)] to Z[H] proceeds without a barrier to yield H2 and Z[In(H)(C2H5)] in an exothermic manner (second step). Finally, the second C–H bond is cleaved to form ethylene, followed by desorption of ethylene and regeneration of Z[InH2] (third step). The first step (from Z[InH2] with ethane to Z[H] with [InH2(C2H5)]) and third step (from Z[In(H)(C2H5)] to Z[InH2] with ethylene) proceeds with ΔH⧧ values of 239.9 and 163.1 kJ/mol, respectively. Furthermore, the σ-bond metathesis mechanism was investigated (Figure 8C). The C–H bond cleavage occurs in a σ-bond metathesis manner to give Z[InH(C2H5)] with H2 (first step). The calculated ΔH⧧ value is 329.2 kJ/mol, which is higher than those in concerted and alkyl mechanisms. After desorption of H2 followed by barrierless rotation of the coordinated C2H5 moiety, the cleavage of the second C–H bond proceeds with a ΔH⧧ value of 289.9 kJ/mol to give Z[InH2] and ethylene (second step). The desorption of the generated ethylene results in regeneration of Z[InH2].

Enthalpy (solid lines) and free energy (dashed lines) profiles for the ethane dehydrogenation on Z[InH2] (A) via a concerted mechanism, (B) via an alkyl mechanism, and (C) via a σ-bond metathesis mechanism. The schematic illustrations of several intermediates and transition states are also described. All of the optimized structure files are given in the Supporting Information.
The TS calculation for the carbenium mechanism on Z2[InH] (Figure 9A) indicated that the first C–H bond cleavage of the adsorbed ethane occurs via hydride transfer to afford Z[InH2]/Z[C2H5] (first step), and the corresponding ΔH⧧ value was estimated to be 236.7 kJ/mol. In the second step, ethylene is generated via the second C–H bond cleavage on Z[C2H5] with a ΔH⧧ value of 128.7 kJ/mol, affording Z[InH2]/Z[H]. After desorption of the generated ethylene, H2 is generated from Z[InH2]/Z[H] (third step; ΔH⧧ = 27.4 kJ/mol) followed by H2 desorption, regenerating Z2[InH]. In ethane dehydrogenation on Z2[InH] via the alkyl mechanism (Figure 9B), the reaction proceeds via C–H bond cleavage of the adsorbed ethane (first step) with a ΔH⧧ of 194.7 kJ/mol, affording Z[In(H)(C2H5)] and Z[H]. Ethylene and H2 are formed from Z[In(H)(C2H5)]/Z[H] via the second C–H bond cleavage, forming Z2[InH] (second step). The ΔH⧧ value of the second step was determined to be 145.4 kJ/mol, and the generated H2 desorbs smoothly while the desorption of ethylene requires a ΔH value of 93.4 kJ/mol. In these reaction mechanisms on In hydrides except for the σ-bond metathesis mechanism on Z[InH2], the rate-determining step is the first C–H cleavage and the associated ΔH⧧ values (194.7–239.9 kJ/mol) are in good agreement with the experimentally obtained values from the Eyring plot (ΔH⧧exp = 236 kJ/mol; Figure 7D).

The schematic illustrations of several intermediates are also described. All of the optimized structure files are given in the Supporting Information.
In contrast, dehydrogenation via the alkyl mechanism on Z[In] (Figure 10) requires a much higher ΔH⧧ value of 410.3 kJ/mol for the rate-determining C–H bond cleavage of the adsorbed ethane to afford Z[InH(C2H5)] (first step). Subsequently, ethylene and H2 are formed from Z[InH(C2H5)] with a relatively small activation barrier of 74.3 kJ/mol (second step) followed by product desorption, regenerating Z[In]. The above TS calculations for ethane dehydrogenation on possible In species showed that In hydrides are more reactive than In+ cations and are potential active sites for dehydrogenation catalyzed by In-CHA.

The steps for the formation of Z[InH2] from the intermediate Z[In(H)(C2H5)] via formation and desorption of C2H4 are included. The schematic illustrations of several intermediates are also described. All of the optimized structure files are given in the Supporting Information.
Furthermore, the calculations in free energy were conducted for the six mechanisms described above on different In species. The profiles are shown by dashed lines in Figures 8–10. In all cases, the free energy barrier for the first C–H cleavage is the highest in each mechanism, which is consistent with our consideration of the rate-determining step based on enthalpy calculations. Among the mechanisms investigated for Z[InH2] (Figure 8), the associated free energy for a concerted mechanism (347.6 kJ/mol) is lower than those for alkyl and σ-bond metathesis mechanisms (416.6 and 376.6 kJ/mol, respectively). For Z2[InH] (Figure 9), the corresponding free energy values are relatively low for both mechanisms (337.2 and 313.9 kJ/mol for carbenium and alkyl mechanisms, respectively). However, the free energy required for Z[In] is much higher (541.6 kJ/mol, Figure 10) than those for five mechanisms on In hydrides (Z[InH2] and Z2[InH]), which also evidence higher reactivity of In hydrides in comparison to In+ cations.
Active In Species for Selective Dehydrogenation of Ethane
Table 3 summarizes the results of in situ spectroscopic, kinetic, and theoretical studies for ethane dehydrogenation using In-CHA. The in situ FTIR measurement (Figure 1) and frequency analysis (Table 1) revealed that [InH2]+ ions are likely to form as the main In hydrides and [InH]2+ ions possibly form as minor species. The kinetic studies (Figure 7) indicated that the catalytically active sites for ethane dehydrogenation are possibly [InH2]+ ions or In+ cations, rather than [InH]2+ ions, while the TS calculations (Figures 8–10) suggested [InH2]+ and [InH]2+ ions as plausible active sites rather than In+ cations. Thus, [InH2]+ ions are the most plausible catalytically active sites among the In hydrides and In+ cations. To further investigate the feasibility of [InH2]+ active sites during dehydrogenation, in situ FTIR and XAFS measurements and TS calculations of the reaction of In-CHA with ethane were performed. The FTIR spectrum of In-CHA after treatment with ethane at 773 K showed a band derived from the In–H stretching vibration of [InH2]+ ions (Figure S6). Note that our FTIR measurement system has a limitation, where the temperature can be increased only up to 773 K. The XANES spectrum of In-CHA in the presence of ethane at 933 K was similar to that in the presence of H2 (Figure S7). The TS calculation for the reaction of Z[In] with ethane to form Z[In(H)(C2H5)] and successive formation of ethylene showed that Z[InH2] can be formed from Z[In(H)(C2H5)] with a ΔH⧧ value of 284.6 kJ/mol (Figure 10). From the kinetic, theoretical, and in situ spectroscopic studies, a possible reaction mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation on [InH2]+ ions is proposed. In the presence of ethane or coproduct H2 at high reaction temperatures, an [InH2]+ ion is generated in the CHA zeolite. The generated [InH2]+ is thermodynamically unstable but is kinetically trapped in the CHA pore, serving as a catalytically active site to promote the selective dehydrogenation of ethane. The concerted and alkyl mechanisms are possible rather than the σ-bond metathesis, as revealed by the DFT calculations. In these two possible mechanisms, the ΔH⧧ value for the rate-determining C–H cleavage of the adsorbed ethane is lower than that for the desorption of H2 from an [InH2]+ ion, supporting the feasibility of dehydrogenation on [InH2]+ ions.

The low coke formation can be ascribed to the low abundance of in situ generated protons and carbenium ions which can promote coke formation. Dehydrogenations via the concerted mechanism and the σ-bond metathesis mechanism on [InH2]+ ions do not include the generation of the above species (Figure 8A,C), whereas, in an alkyl mechanism on [InH2]+ ions, the in situ generated Z[H] after the first step smoothly reacts with the coordinated hydride in [In(H)2(C2H5)] without a barrier, affording H2 and Z[In(H)(C2H5)] (Figure 8B). For [InH]2+ ions, ethylene formation from Z[C2H5]/Z[InH2] (second step in the carbenium mechanism; Figure 9A) and formation of dehydrogenation products from Z[H]/Z[In(H)(C2H5)] (second step in the alkyl mechanism; Figure 9B) requires high ΔH⧧ values of 128.7 and 145.4 kJ/mol, respectively. The abundance of in situ generated protons and carbenium ions during dehydrogenation on [InH2]+ ions is likely lower than that during dehydrogenation on [InH]2+ ions. Similar differences in TS calculations between [GaH2]+ and [GaH]2+ ions were indicated by Bell and workers (41) Therefore, the distinction of catalytically active M hydrides between In and Ga ([InH2]+ vs [GaH]2+ ions) is the origin of the superior selectivity and durability of In-CHA over those of Ga zeolites.
Conclusion
Herein, the first report of surface-isolated In hydrides in zeolites, including formation, characterization, and catalysis, is described. The isolated In hydrides were formed in CHA zeolites by H2 treatment of In-CHA at high reaction temperatures. Characterization by in situ FTIR measurements including isotopic experiments with D2 and vibration calculations revealed that the [InH2]+ ions are plausible structures. The necessity of high temperature for the formation of [InH2]+ ions and their kinetic stability were also discussed in the context of TS calculations. The results of in situ XAFS measurements are compatible with the formation of In hydrides. With regard to the catalysis, In-CHA exhibited high selectivity and durability for the nonoxidative ethane dehydrogenation without cofeeding of H2. The activity and selectivity of In-CHA were maintained for at least 90 h, and the catalyst was reusable without loss of its efficiency. Kinetic studies revealed that In-CHA was not inhibited by H2 and that the formation rate increased with an increase in the M/Al ratio to 0.8, which were different from those operative in Ga zeolites. The TS calculations for dehydrogenation on In hydrides and In+ cations indicated that [InH2]+ ions likely act as catalytically active sites for dehydrogenation and that both concerted and alkyl mechanisms are possible. The [InH2]+ ion plays a key role in the selective dehydrogenation, where the abundance of zeolite-coordinated protons and/or carbenium species during the dehydrogenation would be lower in comparison to the case of Ga zeolites. This leads to much less coke formation, resulting in the superior selectivity and durability of In-CHA. Rational studies for formation and characterization of In hydrides in various types of zeolites and their dehydrogenation catalysis activity remain under investigation.
