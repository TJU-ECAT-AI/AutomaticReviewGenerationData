<c>For instance, the coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites present on the (100) facets of commercial c-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites to anchor atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites.</c>
<c>This PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst displayed an excellent performance at an ultrahigh space velocity in a long-term PDH reaction.</c>
<c>In addition to being an appropriate support, the hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 showed a high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as the surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene.</c>
<c>Furthermore, the diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction.</c>
<c>Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction.</c>
<c>We further illustrate the effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in the Co-catalyzed PDH reaction.</c>

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by stimulating the search for cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts that can replace traditional ones. This includes the exploration of Ga-based catalysts for PDH, which have been studied for their potential in enhancing catalytic activity and stability. Recent research findings have contributed to our understanding of the role of Ga species in these catalysts, emphasizing the importance of their active states and dispersion. These catalysts aim to improve the selectivity and stability in the PDH reaction through the control of catalyst structure, particularly focusing on the surface acidity and coordination of Al sites, which impact the adsorption and activation of propane as well as coke deposition.
