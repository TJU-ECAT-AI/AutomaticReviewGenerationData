<citation>Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide,acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [14].</citation>
<citation>The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies,the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin pro-cess with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst [5].</citation>
<citation>For Pt-based catalysts, the electronic modification by promoters and the specific interaction with the optimized supports lead to the enhancement in both catalytic activity and stability [611].</citation>
<citation>Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge [1224].</citation>
<citation>Nearly 80% propylene selectivity could be obtained on a mesoporous CoAl2O4 spinel catalyst in the PDH reaction, whereas the rapid deactivation was observed [31].</citation>
<citation>Modified spinel Co3O4 has shown good activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, however, it can be easily reduced to metallic Co0 species during the anaerobic PDH reaction, causing the CC cracking and formation of significant methane and C2 molecules [33,34].</citation>
<citation>Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability.</citation>
<citation>Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction.</citation>

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), aiming to find alternatives to the existing Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. These alternatives aim to reduce costs and environmental impact while maintaining high efficiency. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with research focusing on the nature of active Ga species. Recent studies suggest that the diversity and complexity of Al2O3 structure influence its properties in adsorption and activation of propane, which impacts coke deposition in the PDH reaction. Tailoring the structure of Co2+ and Al2O3 composites has been proposed to improve catalytic performance in PDH, showing promise in enhancing both selectivity and stability.
