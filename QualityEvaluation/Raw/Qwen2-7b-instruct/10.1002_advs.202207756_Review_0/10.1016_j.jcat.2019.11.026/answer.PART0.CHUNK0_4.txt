The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in developing new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The use of Pt-based catalysts has shown enhancements in both activity and stability through electronic modification by promoters and specific interaction with optimized supports. However, the high cost of Pt and toxicity issues with Cr catalysts limit their further development. Research continues to explore cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives, such as Ga-, Zn-, or Sn-based catalysts. Cobalt species, especially low-coordinate Co+/Co2+, are known for their efficiency in hydrocarbon activation. Studies on isotopic labeling kinetics reveal that Co+ in an exited state favors the activation of CH and CC bonds over the ground state. The mesoporous CoAl2O4 spinel catalyst showed nearly 80% propylene selectivity in PDH, but rapid deactivation was observed. This was attributed to a lack of structure control over the Co sites. Alumina, due to its structural advantages and stability, is commonly used as a support in heterogeneous catalysis. Removing hydroxyl groups from alumina enhances the activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as surface active sites for non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The diversity and complexity of alumina's structure, particularly the surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites, influence the adsorption and activation of propane and coke deposition in PDH reactions. Sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts were synthesized using a one-step hydrothermal method for efficient PDH catalysis.

丙烯作为制造聚丙烯、丙烯氧化物、乙酸、丙烯腈和丙烯酸的重要原料，其不断增长的需求以及页岩气储备中大量的丙烷，促使人们关注通过催化丙烷脱氢（PDH）生产丙烯的新方法。铂基催化剂在活性和稳定性上的增强得益于促进剂的电子修饰以及与优化支持物的特定相互作用。然而，铂金属的价格高昂和Cr催化剂的严重毒性问题限制了PDH过程的进一步发展。研究继续探索成本效益高且环境友好的替代品，如Ga、Zn或Sn基催化剂。低配合度的Co+/Co2+物种对于烃类的活化是高效的。关于同位素标记动力学的研究表明，Co+处于激发态比处于基态时更有利于CH和CC键的活化。多孔的CoAl2O4尖晶石催化剂在PDH反应中显示出近80%的丙烯选择性，但观察到快速失活现象。这主要是由于缺乏对Co位点的结构控制。由于其结构优势和稳定性，氧化铝是异质催化中常用的载体之一。去除氧化铝中的羟基组分提高了表面配位不饱和Al3+的活性，作为非氧化脱氢化异丁烷生成异丁烯的表面活性位点。氧化铝结构的多样性和复杂性，特别是表面酸性在低配位Al位点，决定了丙烷吸附和丙烷脱氢以及焦炭沉积在PDH反应中的不同性质。在此工作中，采用一步水热法制备了片状CoAl2O3HT催化剂，用于高效催化PDH反应。
