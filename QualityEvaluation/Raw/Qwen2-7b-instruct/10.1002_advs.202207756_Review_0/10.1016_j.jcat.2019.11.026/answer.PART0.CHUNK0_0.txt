<c>Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide,acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [14].</c>
<c>The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies,the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst [5].</c>
<c>For Pt-based catalysts, the electronic modification by promoters and the specific interaction with the optimized supports lead to the enhancement in both catalytic activity and stability [611].</c>
<c>However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process.</c>
<c>Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge [1224].</c>
<c>Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability.</c>
<c>The c-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support.</c>
<c>This PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst displayed an excellent performance at an ultrahigh space velocity in a long-term PDH reaction.</c>
<c>In addition to being an appropriate support, the hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 showed a high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as the surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene [40].</c>
<c>Furthermore, the diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction.</c>
<c>It is therefore desirable to tailor the structure of Co2+ and Al2O3 composites for improving the catalytic performance in the PDH reaction.</c>
<c>Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction.</c>

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to increase the supply of propylene. This has driven the search for more efficient and less costly catalysts, especially in comparison to the traditional Pt- and Cr-based catalysts which are expensive and toxic. The development of Ga-, Zn-, or Sn-based catalysts represents a significant challenge in this field.

2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. These catalysts have shown promise due to their ability to enhance both the activity and stability of PDH processes. However, the debate around the active Ga species continues, with recent research contributing to a clearer picture of the role of Ga in the activation of CH and CC bonds, and its influence on the selectivity towards propylene in the PDH reaction.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，为了增加丙烯供应，已经开发了新的生产方法，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），这推动了对更高效和成本更低催化剂的需求，特别是与传统的Pt-和Cr基催化剂相比，这些催化剂昂贵且有毒。Ga、Zn或Sn基催化剂的发展是这一领域的一个重要挑战。

2. Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随着时间的推移而发展。这些催化剂显示出提高PDH过程的活性和稳定性的潜力。然而，关于活性Ga物种的争论持续存在，最近的研究为更好地理解Ga在CH和CC键活化以及PDH反应中丙烯选择性的作用提供了清晰的图景。
