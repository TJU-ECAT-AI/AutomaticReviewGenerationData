<c>For instance, the coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites present on the (100) facets of commercial c-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites to anchor atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites [36,37].</c>
<c>The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type c-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, leading to an enhanced activity and stability in PDH reaction [38].</c>
<c>The c-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support [39].</c>
<c>This PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst displayed an excellent performance at an ultrahigh space velocity in a long-term PDH reaction.</c>
<c>In addition to being an appropriate support, the hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 showed a high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as the surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene [40].</c>

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the search for more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, focusing on the active species responsible for the catalytic activity. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites in determining the adsorption and activation of propane, as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction. This has led to the development of novel catalysts, such as the CoAl2O3HT catalyst, which employs a one-step hydrothermal method to synthesize sheet-shaped materials that can enhance the efficiency of the PDH reaction.
