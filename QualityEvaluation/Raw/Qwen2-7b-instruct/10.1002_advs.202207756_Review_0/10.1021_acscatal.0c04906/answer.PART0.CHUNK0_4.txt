Answer: The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debates about the active Ga species involved. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, shedding light on their mechanism and kinetics in the process of light alkane dehydrogenation and cracking.
