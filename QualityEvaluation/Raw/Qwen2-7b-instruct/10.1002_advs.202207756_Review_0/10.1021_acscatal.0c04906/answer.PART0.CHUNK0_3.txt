The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species. Recent research findings have provided insights into the mechanism and kinetics of light alkane dehydrogenation and cracking over isolated Ga species in Ga/H-MFI.
