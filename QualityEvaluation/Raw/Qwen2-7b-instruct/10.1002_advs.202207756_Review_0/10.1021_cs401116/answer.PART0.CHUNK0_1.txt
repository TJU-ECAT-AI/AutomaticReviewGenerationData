[2] "For example, propane thermal cracking produces propylene, ethylene, methane, and hydrogen. Because of lower propylene selectivity associated with thermal cracking, catalyst deactivation due to the deposition of carbon on the catalyst surface is often severe, requiring frequent or continuous catalyst regeneration."
[3] "At high temperatures, it reduces to form zinc metal, which is a liquid (mp 420 C (4)) around the temperatures where dehydrogenation becomes favorable. Thus, hydrogenation is possible over ZnO, but dehydrogenation is not, because of the instability of ZnO at high temperatures."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), aiming for more efficient utilization of hydrocarbon resources while promoting sustainable energy generation. PDH typically involves the use of catalysts, with challenges like catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition necessitating frequent regeneration. The instability of ZnO at high temperatures prevents its use for dehydrogenation, as it tends to reduce to zinc metal. In this study, researchers have synthesized a silica-supported, single-site Zn(II) catalyst that is highly effective for propylene hydrogenation and demonstrates exceptional selectivity in the reverse reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propene and hydrogen. The catalyst is susceptible to poisoning by Lewis bases, indicating its high activity and uniformity among its sites. The proposed reaction pathway suggests that the 3-coordinate Zn(II) site facilitates the heterolytic dissociation of alkane and olefin bonds, followed by β hydride elimination, thus explaining the observed selectivity in propane dehydrogenation.

The contact time for propane dehydrogenation in this study was set at 3.8 seconds, indicating the efficiency of the process under these conditions.

随着丙烯需求的增长，为了更高效地利用这些资源并促进可持续能源的开发与部署，已经发展出了新的生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），旨在实现资源的更有效利用并推动可持续能源的发展。PDH通常涉及到催化剂的使用，面临的挑战是催化剂在碳沉积作用下的失效，这需要频繁或连续的催化剂再生。由于ZnO在高温下不稳定，它倾向于还原为液态锌金属，从而阻止了其用于脱氢。本研究中，研究人员合成了一个基于二氧化硅的单个Zn(II)位点催化剂，该催化剂对于丙烯氢化具有活性，并且在逆反应中对丙烷脱氢到丙烯和氢气表现出高度的选择性。催化剂对Lewis碱中毒敏感，表明其活性高且各活性位点均匀。提出的反应途径表明，3价Zn(II)位点能够促进烷烃和烯烃键的异裂，随后进行β氢消除，这解释了在丙烷脱氢过程中观察到的选择性。

在本研究中，丙烷脱氢的接触时间为3.8秒，表明在这些条件下过程的效率。
