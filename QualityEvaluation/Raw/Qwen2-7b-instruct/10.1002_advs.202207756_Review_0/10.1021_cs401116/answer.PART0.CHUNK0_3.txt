Answer: The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of more efficient methods for its production, particularly focusing on propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditionally, propylene is produced through thermal cracking, which involves high temperatures and results in a mixture of CC and CH products. The use of catalysts has improved propylene yield but often leads to catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition, necessitating frequent regeneration. Single-site Zn(II) ions in MFI zeolite have been suggested for alkane dehydrogenation, but their effectiveness in PDH has been debated. Recent research has synthesized a silica-supported, single-site Zn(II) catalyst that demonstrates high selectivity in propylene hydrogenation and propane dehydrogenation, addressing the limitations of conventional methods and enhancing propylene production efficiency.
