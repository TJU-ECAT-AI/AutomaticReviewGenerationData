[1] "As global demand for hydrocarbon reserves has continued to increase, more efficient utilization of these resources has become an important and complementary strategy to the development and deployment of sustainable energy generation."
[2] "For alkanes with three or more carbons, all the current processes result in mixtures of CC and CH cracked products. For example, propane thermal cracking produces propylene, ethylene, methane, and hydrogen."
[3] "Although higher propylene selectivity is generally attained, catalyst deactivation due to the deposition of carbon on the catalyst surface is often severe, requiring frequent or continuous catalyst regeneration."
[4] "ZnO is weakly active for the catalytic hydrogenation of olefins (3) at room temperature but becomes active after high-temperature treatment."
[5] "Single-site Zn(II) ions in MFI zeolite have often been suggested to catalyze alkane dehydrogenation during conversion of propane to aromatics."
[6] "Attempts have been made to neutralize the acid sites, but residual protons contribute significantly to the observed catalysis."
[7] "In this paper, we report the synthesis of a silica-supported, single-site Zn(II) catalyst that is catalytically active for propylene hydrogenation and highly selective for the reverse reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propene and hydrogen."
[8] "The catalyst is readily poisoned by Lewis bases, with the loss of one active site per adsorbed poison, suggesting that nearly every Zn(II) is equally active."
[9] "A key step in the pathway is the reaction of 3-coordinate Zn(II) to heterolytically dissociate CH sigma bonds in alkane dehydrogenation and HH sigma bonds in olefin hydrogenation, followed by rate-determining β hydride elimination of the resulting Zn(II) propyl (for the dehydrogenation reaction)."
[10] "The hydrogenation reactivity of ZnO and the catalytic properties Zn/MFI suggest that low-coordinate, single-site Zn2+ may be capable of dehydrogenating alkanes to olefin and hydrogen if it can be stabilized toward reduction."

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by increasing the focus on more efficient utilization of hydrocarbon resources. This has led to advancements in catalyst technology aimed at achieving higher propylene selectivity while minimizing catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition on the surface.

2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with debates around the active Ga species. Research findings have contributed to current knowledge by elucidating the role of specific catalyst components and their interaction with the reaction medium, which in turn affects the selectivity and efficiency of PDH processes. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of catalyst structure and composition in determining the activity and selectivity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH.
