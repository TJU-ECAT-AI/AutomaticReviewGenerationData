The ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies. In particular, in China, it is predicted that the processing capacity of propane dehydrogenation will increase to 30 million t per annum by 2030 from about 7 million t per annum at present.

In order to study the catalytic role of these isolated sites independently, inert carrier silica without Brnsted acid sites is applied, and at the same time, the Si vacancies on the surface can protect the low coordinated metal ions from reducing to metallic phase or sintering into metal oxide clusters.

Very recently, supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS) introduced a new and promising concept for heterogeneous reaction. For alkane dehydrogenation, supported Ga-containing liquid metal alloys have been studied, since Ga with a low melting point of 29.7 °C can dissolve a variety of transition metals.

For the dehydrogenation of isobutane, the spacing of two adjacent active sites should be even larger to reduce the formation of 1,3-butadiene caused by the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane. However, if 1,3-butadiene is the desired product, it will be favorable to shorten the spacing by increasing the density of active sites.

Whether on the basis of an active metal or a surface area, Ga2O3In2O3 exhibits higher propane conversion compared to In2O3Al2O3, while the selectivity to propylene is relatively low.

The growing demand for propylene has spurred the development of new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This has led to advancements in catalysts and reactor designs. Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, there is an ongoing debate about the active Ga species involved. Recent research has contributed to our understanding by studying the role of isolated Ga sites on the surface of the catalyst. These sites are protected by the surrounding silica matrix, which prevents the Ga from reducing to a metallic phase or aggregating into metal oxide clusters. This isolation ensures the catalytic activity of Ga for PDH. The melting point of Ga is a key factor in its use for liquid metal catalysts, as it allows for the dissolution of various transition metals, which can enhance the dehydrogenation activity. The spacing between active sites plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity and conversion rates. For instance, to avoid the formation of 1,3-butadiene from n-butane, the spacing needs to be larger. However, if 1,3-butadiene is the desired product, the spacing can be shortened to increase its production. Lastly, Ga2O3In2O3 catalysts have shown higher propane conversion rates compared to In2O3Al2O3, albeit with lower selectivity to propylene.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新型生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这导致催化剂和反应器设计的进展。关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH，存在关于活性Ga物种的持续争论。最近的研究通过研究催化剂表面孤立Ga物种的作用，为我们提供了更深入的理解。这些位点被周围的二氧化硅矩阵保护，防止Ga转化为金属相或聚集为金属氧化物簇。这种隔离确保了Ga在PDH中的催化活性。Ga的熔点是其作为液态金属催化剂的关键因素，因为它允许多种过渡金属的溶解，从而增强脱氢活性。活性位点之间的间距对于确定转化率和选择性至关重要。例如，为了避免n-丁烷形成1,3-丁二烯，间距需要更大。但是，如果1,3-丁二烯是目标产物，则可以通过增加活性位点密度来缩短间距以增加其产量。最后，Ga2O3In2O3催化剂显示出与In2O3Al2O3相比更高的丙烷转化率，尽管丙烯选择性较低。

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This increased demand has led to a surge in research and commercial application of PDH technologies. In China, it is forecasted that the processing capacity for propane dehydrogenation will expand from around 7 million tons annually to 30 million tons by 2030. 

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the understanding of these catalysts has evolved with advancements in the field. These catalysts demonstrate relatively good dehydrogenation performance, particularly in the context of isobutane dehydrogenation. Research has shown that the selectivity to isobutylene can reach up to 85% at a conversion rate of 50%. The catalysts are based on the use of Al2O3 or ZrO2 carriers, each with unique properties. Al2O3, while capable of catalyzing the dehydrogenation process, exhibits a longer induction period and higher rates of coke formation. Meanwhile, the coordinatively unsaturated Zrcus and Alcus sites are typically attributed to the dehydrogenation process.

There is ongoing debate about the active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. Research indicates that isolated vanadium, with higher Lewis acidity, exhibits higher intrinsic activity but lower selectivity to isobutylene compared to oligomerized vanadium species. This is due to the increased likelihood of isomerization and cracking reactions. The dehydrogenation performance of modified ZrO2-based catalysts matches that of commercial catalysts, but achieving long-term high activity remains challenging. Efforts to prolong the time between catalyst regenerations focus on studying the catalyst's chemical environment changes and the role of coke deposition in the deactivation process.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新型生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这种增加的需求导致PDH技术的研究和商业应用激增。在中国，预计丙烷脱氢的加工能力将从目前的大约每年700万吨增加到2030年的3000万吨左右。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH，这些催化剂的理解随着该领域的进步而演变。这些催化剂显示出相对较好的脱氢性能，特别是在异丁烷脱氢的情况下。研究表明，异丁烯选择性可以达到85%，转化率为50%。这些催化剂基于使用Al2O3或ZrO2载体，每种载体都有其独特的性质。Al2O3虽然能够催化脱氢过程，但具有较长的诱导期和较高的焦炭生成速率。同时，协调不饱和Zrcus和Alcus位点通常归因于脱氢过程。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的活性Ga物种，存在持续的辩论。研究显示，与聚集体范德华物种相比，孤立的钒，具有更高的Lewis酸度，显示出更高的内在活性但较低的选择性异丁烯，这是由于异丁烯异构化和裂解反应的可能性增加。修改后的ZrO2基催化剂的脱氢性能与商用催化剂相匹配，但实现长时间的高活性仍然具有挑战性。努力延长催化剂再生之间的间隔集中在研究催化剂化学环境的变化和焦炭沉积在失活过程中的作用。
