[1] "In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies."
[2] "The main purpose of dehydrogenation of n-butane is to produce 1,3-butadiene directly or in combination with the oxidative dehydrogenation of 1-butylene."
[3] "In fact, there are many things in common for the dehydrogenation of these light alkanes."
[4] "In the paper, in addition to the research progress of the catalysts, the new understanding of the reaction mechanism and the technical advances of the dehydrogenation reactors are also introduced."
[5] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."
[6] "Actually, as long as the interaction between Pt and the carrier is strong enough, the sintering of Pt can be effectively slowed down."
[7] "Moreover, the addition of Sn reduces the energy barriers of olefin desorption and simultaneously increases the activation energy for deep dehydrogenation."
[8] "However, under high temperatures the formation of low-melting-point CrO3 inevitably occurs, which is detrimental to the stable operation of the dehydrogenation unit."
[9] "The dehydrogenation performance of the NiP catalyst is also affected by the introduced P content."
[10] "Therefore, maintaining the surface Zr species active and slowing down the coking rate are two effective measures to improve the stability for industrial applications."
[11] "The shortest distance between the two hydrogen atoms bonded with the adjacent carbons of alkane molecules is about 0.25 nm; thus, for propane dehydrogenation, the spacing between two neighboring active sites should be larger than this value."
[12] "Moreover, Lewis acid sites on alumina probably play an important role in stabilizing highly dispersed Ga sites."
[13] "For example, it is reported that the highest selectivity to propylene is above 99 mol% in propane dehydrogenation over supported PtSn catalysts."
