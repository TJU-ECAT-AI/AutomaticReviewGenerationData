The ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies. In particular, in China, it is predicted that the processing capacity of propane dehydrogenation will increase to 30 million t per annum by 2030 from about 7 million t per annum at present.

In order to study the catalytic role of these isolated sites independently, inert carrier silica without Brnsted acid sites is applied, and at the same time, the Si vacancies on the surface can protect the low coordinated metal ions from reducing to metallic phase or sintering into metal oxide clusters.

Very recently, supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS) introduced a new and promising concept for heterogeneous reaction. For alkane dehydrogenation, supported Ga-containing liquid metal alloys have been studied, since Ga with a low melting point of 29.7 °C can dissolve a variety of transition metals.

For the dehydrogenation of isobutane, the spacing of two adjacent active sites should be even larger to reduce the formation of 1,3-butadiene caused by the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane. However, if 1,3-butadiene is the desired product, it will be favorable to shorten the spacing by increasing the density of active sites.

Whether on the basis of an active metal or a surface area, Ga2O3In2O3 exhibits higher propane conversion compared to In2O3Al2O3, while the selectivity to propylene is relatively low.

The growing demand for propylene has spurred the development of new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This has led to advancements in catalysts and reactor designs. Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, there is an ongoing debate about the active Ga species involved. Recent research has contributed to our understanding by studying the role of isolated Ga sites on the surface of the catalyst. These sites are protected by the surrounding silica matrix, which prevents the Ga from reducing to a metallic phase or aggregating into metal oxide clusters. This isolation ensures the catalytic activity of Ga for PDH. The melting point of Ga is a key factor in its use for liquid metal catalysts, as it allows for the dissolution of various transition metals, which can enhance the dehydrogenation activity. The spacing between active sites plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity and conversion rates. For instance, to avoid the formation of 1,3-butadiene from n-butane, the spacing needs to be larger. However, if 1,3-butadiene is the desired product, the spacing can be shortened to increase its production. Lastly, Ga2O3In2O3 catalysts have shown higher propane conversion rates compared to In2O3Al2O3, albeit with lower selectivity to propylene.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新型生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这导致催化剂和反应器设计的进展。关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH，存在关于活性Ga物种的持续争论。最近的研究通过研究催化剂表面孤立Ga物种的作用，为我们提供了更深入的理解。这些位点被周围的二氧化硅矩阵保护，防止Ga转化为金属相或聚集为金属氧化物簇。这种隔离确保了Ga在PDH中的催化活性。Ga的熔点是其作为液态金属催化剂的关键因素，因为它允许多种过渡金属的溶解，从而增强脱氢活性。活性位点之间的间距对于确定转化率和选择性至关重要。例如，为了避免n-丁烷形成1,3-丁二烯，间距需要更大。但是，如果1,3-丁二烯是目标产物，则可以通过增加活性位点密度来缩短间距以增加其产量。最后，Ga2O3In2O3催化剂显示出与In2O3Al2O3相比更高的丙烷转化率，尽管丙烯选择性较低。
