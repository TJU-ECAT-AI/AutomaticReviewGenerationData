<p>In the past several decades, light alkane dehydrogenation to mono-olefins, especially propane dehydrogenation to propylene has gained widespread attention and much development in the field of research and commercial application.</p>
<p>The growing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies. In particular, in China,it is predicted that the processing capacity of propane dehydrogenation will increase to 30 million t per annum by 2030 from about 7 million t per annum at present.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the conventional carrier ZrO2 145 or Al2O3 58 with surface defects has been demonstrated to exhibit relatively good dehydrogenation performance.</p>
<p>For isobutane dehydrogenation, the selectivity to isobutylene of 85% was obtained at isobutane conversion of 50% over the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst for isobutane dehydrogenation (isobutane : nitrogen = 40: 60, GHSV of 1200 L h1 kgcat 1).</p>
<p>Al2O3 itself can catalyze the dehydrogenation of light alkanes,while having a long induction period and relatively high coke formation rate. The coordinatively unsaturated Zrcus and Alcus sites are generally regarded to be responsible for dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Research has indicated that isolated vanadium, with higher Lewis acidity, possesses higher intrinsic activity and lower selectivity to isobutylene compared with oligomerized vanadium species for isobutane dehydrogenation due to the increased possibility for isomerization of isobutylene and cracking reactions.</p>

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This increased demand has led to a surge in research and commercial application of PDH technologies. In China, it is forecasted that the processing capacity for propane dehydrogenation will expand from around 7 million tons annually to 30 million tons by 2030. 

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the understanding of these catalysts has evolved with advancements in the field. These catalysts demonstrate relatively good dehydrogenation performance, particularly in the context of isobutane dehydrogenation. Research has shown that the selectivity to isobutylene can reach up to 85% at a conversion rate of 50%. The catalysts are based on the use of Al2O3 or ZrO2 carriers, each with unique properties. Al2O3, while capable of catalyzing the dehydrogenation process, exhibits a longer induction period and higher rates of coke formation. Meanwhile, the coordinatively unsaturated Zrcus and Alcus sites are typically attributed to the dehydrogenation process.

There is ongoing debate about the active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. Research indicates that isolated vanadium, with higher Lewis acidity, exhibits higher intrinsic activity but lower selectivity to isobutylene compared to oligomerized vanadium species. This is due to the increased likelihood of isomerization and cracking reactions. The dehydrogenation performance of modified ZrO2-based catalysts matches that of commercial catalysts, but achieving long-term high activity remains challenging. Efforts to prolong the time between catalyst regenerations focus on studying the catalyst's chemical environment changes and the role of coke deposition in the deactivation process.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新型生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这种增加的需求导致PDH技术的研究和商业应用激增。在中国，预计丙烷脱氢的加工能力将从目前的大约每年700万吨增加到2030年的3000万吨左右。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH，这些催化剂的理解随着该领域的进步而演变。这些催化剂显示出相对较好的脱氢性能，特别是在异丁烷脱氢的情况下。研究表明，异丁烯选择性可以达到85%，转化率为50%。这些催化剂基于使用Al2O3或ZrO2载体，每种载体都有其独特的性质。Al2O3虽然能够催化脱氢过程，但具有较长的诱导期和较高的焦炭生成速率。同时，协调不饱和Zrcus和Alcus位点通常归因于脱氢过程。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的活性Ga物种，存在持续的辩论。研究显示，与聚集体范德华物种相比，孤立的钒，具有更高的Lewis酸度，显示出更高的内在活性但较低的选择性异丁烯，这是由于异丁烯异构化和裂解反应的可能性增加。修改后的ZrO2基催化剂的脱氢性能与商用催化剂相匹配，但实现长时间的高活性仍然具有挑战性。努力延长催化剂再生之间的间隔集中在研究催化剂化学环境的变化和焦炭沉积在失活过程中的作用。
