<p>The growing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies.</p>
<p>For isobutane dehydrogenation, the selectivity to isobutylene exceeds 80% for isobutane dehydrogenation over all these catalysts.33,104 The fundamental cause of the great change in selectivity should be attributed to the longer distance between metal atoms in metal sulfides than that in metals.</p>
<p>Whether on the basis of an active metal or a surface area, Ga2O3In2O3 exhibits higher propane conversion compared to In2O3Al2O3, while the selectivity to propylene is relatively low.</p>

1. The rising demand for propylene has accelerated the development of new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This technology has seen significant advancements to meet market needs. 

2. The catalyst Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been explored for PDH. Research indicates that the active Ga species on the catalyst surface play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process. There has been a debate regarding the nature of these active sites, with some studies suggesting that the Ga+ ion, monomeric [GaO]+ or dimeric [Ga2O2]2+ cations, and [GaH]2+ ion are potentially active for PDH. Recent studies have contributed to a deeper understanding of the Ga species' functionality on the catalyst surface.

1. 对丙烯的日益增长的需求已经推动了新型生产方法，尤其是丙烷脱氢化（PDH）技术的快速应用和发展。为了满足市场需求，这项技术已经取得了显著进展。

2. 针对PDH，研究了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。研究表明，催化剂表面的活性Ga物种在脱氢过程中起着关键作用。关于这些活性位点的性质存在争论，一些研究认为Ga+离子、单体的[GaO]+或二聚体的[Ga2O2]2+阴离子以及[GaH]2+离子可能是PDH的潜在活性位点。最近的研究为理解催化剂表面Ga物种的功能提供了更深入的知识。
