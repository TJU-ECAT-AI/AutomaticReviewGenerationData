1. Under reaction conditions, metal ensembles might undergo transformation and reconstruction, leading to changes in their catalytic behavior over time.

2. The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts, where M can be Ga, Zn, In, or Sn, have been studied using in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).

3. Introducing a second metal into nanoparticulate metal catalysts can significantly alter the electronic structure of the pristine metal and impact its catalytic properties.

4. The ideal catalyst ensures that CC bond cleavage is inhibited with minimal loss of active sites crucial for the targeted reaction, like dehydrogenation.

5. The chemical state of Sn remains consistent when the reduction time at 600°C is prolonged from 0 to 22 hours.

6. The amount of coke formed in all samples stayed below 1 wt%, and there was no link between stability and the quantity of deposited coke.

7. The formation of PtSn clusters is favored when Pt and Sn are contained within the sinusoidal 10R channels of MFI zeolite.

1. 在反应条件下，金属簇可能经历转变和重建，导致其催化行为随时间变化。

2. PtM催化剂（M为Ga、Zn、In或Sn）的结构通过原位X射线衍射和原位X射线吸收光谱（XAS）进行了研究。

3. 将第二种金属引入纳米颗粒金属催化剂中可以显著改变原始金属的电子结构并影响其催化性能。

4. 理想的催化剂能够抑制CC键断裂，同时减少或无损失地保持负责目标反应（如脱氢）的关键活性位点。

5. 当在600°C下延长还原时间为0至22小时时，Sn的化学状态保持不变。

6. 所有样品中的焦炭量保持在1 wt%以下，稳定性与沉积焦炭量之间没有相关性。

7. 当Pt和Sn被限制在MFI沸石的正弦10R通道内时，形成PtSn簇更有利于。
