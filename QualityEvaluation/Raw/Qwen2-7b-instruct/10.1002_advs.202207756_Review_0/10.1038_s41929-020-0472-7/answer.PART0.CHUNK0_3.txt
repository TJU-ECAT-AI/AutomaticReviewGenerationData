[1] "It has been demonstrated in numerous systems that the introduction of a second metal into nanoparticulate metal catalysts can substantially modulate the electronic structure of pristine metals and further influence their catalytic behaviour1."
[2] "Furthermore, the electronic structures and surface properties of bimetallic nanopar- ticles are strongly dependent on the spatial distribution of the two elements."
[3] "By tuning the procedure for preparing the bimetallic nanoparticles or by post-synthetic treatments, the spatial distri- bution of the two elements as well as their chemical states can be modified and, thus, their reactivity24."
[4] "The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts (M=Ga, Zn, In, Sn) have been studied by in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)."
[5] "High Sn content and high activa- tion temperature favour the formation of alloyed structures that substantially promote catalyst selectivity and stability in dehydro- genation reactions8."
[6] "However, the resulting large alloyed PtM par- ticles are suboptimal from an activity standpoint, and there is an interest in designing more active, selective and stable subnanomet- ric bimetallic catalysts912."
[7] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R chan- nels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."
[8] "It will be shown that subtle changes in the structural features of the sub- nanometric PtSn clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional spectroscopic techniques, can drastically affect their performance for propane dehydrogenation."
[9] "The chemical states of Pt in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample during H2 reduction at 600C were investigated by in situ XAS. It was found that, regardless of the reduction time, the Pt species in the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample were completely reduced to metallic Pt at 600C (ref. 14), as inferred by the intensity of the white line in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra compared with a Pt foil reference (Fig. 2a) and the appear- ance of PtPt contributions in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra (Fig. 2b and Table 1)."
[10] "Analysis of the STEM-iDPC (combination of HR-HAADF-STEM and iDPC) images indicates that the Pt clusters in these reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples are in the 10R sinusoidal channels, regardless of the H2 reduction time at 600C (Fig. 1et and Supplementary Figs. 1116)"
[11] "As can be seen in Fig. 7a,after a short pre-reduction treatment (K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample), the initial conversion was 50% (the thermodynamic conversion from propane to propylene and H2 is 70% at a theoretical 100% propylene selectivity) and the selectivity to propylene was 82%, giving 18% hydrogenolysis products (methane, eth- ane and ethylene) and a very small amount of aromatics."
[12] "When the starting K-PtSn@MFI sample was kept in H2 at 600C for 1h before the propane dehydrogenation reaction (using the activation conditions of our previous work17; see Fig. 7b), then the initial activity for the dehydrogenation decreased slightly, whereas the selectivity to pro- pylene increased to 93%."
[13] "The sample with lowest Sn loading gave lower initial selectiv- ity to propylene and faster deactivation, which can be associated with fewer PtSn contacts in the sample, whereas in the sample with highest Sn loading, PtSn alloy nanoparticles (>2nm) were formed due to the presence of plenty of defects in the MFI zeolite crystallites, and this sintering of Pt species resulted in a decrease in activity."
[14] "Furthermore, the results clearly show that the formation of bime- tallic PtSn clusters is much more favourable when Pt and Sn are confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of MFI zeolite."
[15] "The K-PtSn@MFI samples were also characterized after the propane dehydrogenation tests by STEM. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 5257, no sintering of the Pt clusters into larger particles was observed in any of the samples after propane dehydrogenation, and the location of PtSn clusters in the 10R sinu- soidal channels is also preserved, further confirming their high stability (Supplementary Figs. 5861)."
[16] "The good performance of the Pt species confined in the 10R channels of MFI zeolite is also reflected by comparison of the initial reactivity for propane dehydrogenation with results reported in the literature.

1. The introduction of a second metal into nanoparticulate metal catalysts can significantly alter the electronic structure of pristine metals and impact their catalytic behavior. The spatial distribution of the two elements in bimetallic nanoparticles plays a crucial role in modifying their chemical states and reactivity.
2. The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts, including those containing gallium (Ga), zinc (Zn), indium (In), and tin (Sn), have been studied using in situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). High tin content and high activation temperature favor the formation of alloyed structures that enhance catalyst selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation reactions.
3. Large alloyed PtM particles, resulting from the aforementioned processes, are less optimal for activity, and there is a growing interest in developing more active, selective, and stable subnanometric bimetallic catalysts.
4. Researchers have investigated how precisely controlling the interaction between platinum (Pt) and tin (Sn) in subnanometric PtSn clusters, located selectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is essential for achieving optimal catalytic performance.
5. Subtle changes in the structural features of the subnanometric PtSn clusters, not immediately evident through conventional spectroscopic techniques, can significantly affect their performance in propane dehydrogenation.
6. During hydrogen reduction at 600°C, the platinum species in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample were completely reduced to metallic platinum, as indicated by the intensity of the white line in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra and the presence of Pt-Pt contributions in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra.
7. The Pt clusters in the reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples are found to be in the 10R sinusoidal channels, regardless of the hydrogen reduction time at 600°C, as determined by STEM-iDPC images.
8. The initial conversion of propane to propylene in the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample was 50%, with a selectivity of 82%, yielding 18% hydrogenolysis products and a small amount of aromatics. The initial activity for the dehydrogenation decreased slightly, while the selectivity to propylene increased to 93% when the catalyst was pre-reduced for 1 hour at 600°C.
9. Catalysts with lower tin loading showed lower initial selectivity to propylene and faster deactivation, likely due to fewer PtSn contacts. In contrast, catalysts with higher tin loading exhibited decreased activity due to the formation of PtSn alloy nanoparticles exceeding 2 nanometers, which resulted from the presence of numerous defects in the MFI zeolite crystallites, causing sintering of the Pt species.
10. The formation of PtSn clusters is more favorable when Pt and Sn are confined within the sinusoidal 10R channels of MFI zeolite, as shown in the study's findings.
11. After propane dehydrogenation tests, no sintering of the Pt clusters into larger particles was observed in any of the samples, and the location of PtSn clusters in the 10R sinusoidal channels was preserved, indicating their high stability.
12. The performance of the Pt species confined in the 10R channels of MFI zeolite was compared with results reported in the literature, showing that the optimized activation conditions developed in the current work led to a sevenfold decrease in the deactivation constant compared to previous work.

1. 在纳米颗粒金属催化剂中引入第二种金属可以显著改变基态金属的电子结构并进一步影响其催化行为。两种元素在双金属纳米粒子中的空间分布对它们的化学状态和反应性有着至关重要的作用。
2. 包含镓（Ga）、锌（Zn）、铟（In）和锡（Sn）的双金属PtM催化剂的结构已经被通过原位X射线衍射和原位X射线吸收光谱（XAS）进行了研究。高锡含量和高活化温度有利于形成促进脱氢反应选择性和稳定性的合金结构。
3. 结果显示，从活性角度看，大尺寸的合金化PtM颗粒并不理想，因此有研究兴趣开发更具有活性、选择性和稳定性的亚纳米级双金属催化剂。
4. 研究人员发现，在纯硅酸盐MFI分子筛的正弦通道中选择性地定位在亚纳米级PtSn簇（0.50.6nm）之间精确调整铂（Pt）和锡（Sn）之间的相互作用对于实现最佳催化性能至关重要。
5. 结构特征的细微变化，这些变化可能不立即通过传统的光谱技术可见，但可以通过结合原位扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）数据、高角度环形暗场扫描透射电子显微镜（HR-HAADF-STEM）图像和CO红外（CO-IR）光谱来确定，可以显著影响它们在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能。
6. 在600°C氢气还原过程中，K-PtSn@MFI-Air样品中的铂物种完全还原为金属铂，这一事实由X射线吸收近边结构（XANES）谱中白色线的强度以及与铂箔参考相比的出现的Pt-Pt贡献在EXAFS谱中得到证实。
7. 减少后，这些减少的K-PtSn@MFI样品中的Pt簇位于10R正弦通道中，无论是在600°C下氢气减少的时间，这一点由STEM-iDPC图像所示。
8. K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h样本的初始丙烷转化率为50%，丙烯选择性为82%，产生18%的氢解产物和少量芳香族化合物。当催化剂在600°C下预还原1小时时，初始活性略有下降，而丙烯选择性增加至93%。
9. 低锡负载的催化剂显示出较低的初始丙烯选择性和更快的失活，这可能与样品中较少的PtSn接触有关。相比之下，高锡负载的催化剂由于MFI沸石晶粒中存在的大量缺陷导致Pt物种聚集，形成了超过2纳米的PtSn合金纳米颗粒，这导致活性下降。
10. 当Pt和Sn被限制在MFI沸石分子筛的正弦10R通道内时，PtSn簇的形成更为有利，这是研究结果所表明的。
11. 在丙烷脱氢测试后，任何样品中都没有观察到Pt簇聚集为更大颗粒的现象，且PtSn簇位于10R正弦通道的位置得到了保持，这进一步证实了它们的高稳定性。
12. 与文献中报告的结果进行比较，当前工作优化的激活条件导致了与先前工作相比七倍降低的失活常数。
