[1] "Under reaction conditions,structural transformation and reconstruction of the metal ensembles may also occur, which may result in further changes of the catalytic behaviour with time on stream."
[2] "The optimal catalyst is achieved when CC bond cleavage is shut down with no or minimal loss of the active sites responsible for the reaction of interest (for example,dehydrogenation)."
[3] "It has been demonstrated in numerous systems that the introduc- tion of a second metal into nanoparticulate metal catalysts can substantially modulate the electronic structure of pristine metals and further influence their catalytic behaviour1."
[4] "The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts (M=Ga, Zn, In, Sn) have been studied by in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)."
[5] "It will be shown that subtle changes in the structural features of the sub- nanometric PtSn clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional spectroscopic techniques, can drastically affect their performance for propane dehydrogenation."
[6] "As can be seen in Fig. 7g,h, the initial activity on a per mol Pt basis is almost the same, regardless of the pre-reduction treatments from 0 to 22h, whereas the deactivation constant varies drastically."
[7] "The specific activities were calculated using the initial activities shown in af."

1. Under reaction conditions, the structure of metal ensembles might change, leading to altered catalytic behavior over time. 
2. For optimal performance, the catalyst should prevent the cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds while preserving the active sites involved in the desired reaction, like dehydrogenation.
3. Introducing a second metal into nanoparticulate metal catalysts often significantly alters the electronic structure of the pristine metal, influencing its catalytic properties.
4. The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts, where M stands for various metals, have been studied using in situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy.
5. Small changes in the structure of subnanometric PtSn clusters, not easily detected by conventional methods, can dramatically impact their performance in propane dehydrogenation.
6. Regardless of the pre-reduction treatments, the initial activity of the Pt-based catalysts per mol of Pt remained constant, but the deactivation rate varied significantly.
7. The specific activity of the catalyst was calculated using the initial activity values presented in the figures.
