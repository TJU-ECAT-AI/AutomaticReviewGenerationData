1. Under reaction conditions, the structural transformation and reconstruction of metal ensembles might happen, causing changes in the catalyst's behavior over time.

2. The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts, where M can be Ga, Zn, In, or Sn, have been explored using in situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

3. While PtSn alloys enhance propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation, they can also decrease or alter the active Pt sites, impacting the catalytic activity.

4. Due to the limited sensitivity for locating individual Sn atoms, only Sn clusters close to Pt clusters can be identified by the analysis method discussed previously.

5. Based on the size of metal clusters in MFI channels, the lack of PtSn interactions detected by EXAFS, and the presence of SnO and PtPt bonds, it is speculated that a reduced bimetallic PtSn cluster contains a Pt core of 8-10 atoms with a few Sn atoms directly interacting with support oxygen atoms.

6. The implications of structural changes during H2 reduction were demonstrated by testing various K-PtSn@MFI catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

7. After a short pre-reduction treatment, the initial conversion was 50%, with 82% selectivity to propylene, leading to 18% hydrogenolysis products and a negligible amount of aromatics.

8. Specific activities were calculated using the initial activities presented in figures and tables.

1. 在反应条件下，金属簇的结构转变和重建可能发生，导致催化剂行为随流化时间的变化。

2. 对于PtM双金属催化剂（M可以是Ga、Zn、In或Sn），利用原位X射线衍射和X射线吸收光谱技术进行了结构研究。

3. PtSn合金在丙烷脱氢过程中显著提高了丙烯的选择性，但也可能减少或调节活性Pt位点，降低催化活性。

4. 由于检测单个Sn原子的灵敏度有限，仅能识别靠近Pt簇的小Sn簇。

5. 根据MFI通道中金属簇的大小，缺乏可由EXAFS检测到的PtSn相互作用，以及存在的SnO和PtPt键，推测一个还原的双金属PtSn簇包含一个8-10个原子的Pt核心，与支持物氧原子直接接触的几个Sn原子。

6. 通过测试各种K-PtSn@MFI催化剂进行丙烷脱氢，展示了结构变化期间H2还原的影响。

7. 短时间预处理后，初始转化率为50%，丙烯选择性为82%，产生18%的氢解产物和少量芳烃。

8. 使用图和表中给出的初始活动计算了特定活性。
