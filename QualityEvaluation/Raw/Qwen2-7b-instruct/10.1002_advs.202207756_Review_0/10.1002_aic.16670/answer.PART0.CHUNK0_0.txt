[1] "The catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane may occur via dry reforming to produce syngas (CO + H2) or oxidative dehydrogenation to yield propylene."
[2] "Utilizing propane and CO2 as co-reactants presents several advantages over conventional methane dry reforming or direct propane dehydrogenation, including lower operating temperatures and less coke formation."
[3] "In this study,several precious and non-precious bimetallic catalysts supported on reducible CeO2 were investigated using flow reactor studies at 823 K to identify selective catalysts for CO2-assisted reforming and dehydrogenation of propane."
[4] "Compared to Pt1, Fe3Pt1 showed lower steady state conversion and stability but with higher propylene selectivity."
[5] "Changing Fe3 to Co3 with Pt1 (Co3Pt1) not only increased the conversion to 20.3% CO2 and 5.6% C3H8 conversion, but also enhanced the dry reforming pathway with 88.8% CO selectivity."
[6] "The Co3Ni1 catalyst showed higher steady state conversion over both reactants and improved stability compared to Ni1 and Co3, while keeping high CO selectivity that was comparable to Ni1 (but higher than Co3)."
[7] "Doubling the catalyst metal loading but maintaining the 3:1 Fe to Ni ratio (Fe9Ni3) increased the conversion but negatively impacted the selectivity toward propylene (22.5% SC3H6 at 3.4% XC3H6)."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by necessitating more efficient and selective catalysts. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Recent research findings suggest that the nature of Ga species plays a crucial role in the activity and selectivity of these catalysts. There has been ongoing debate about whether the active Ga species are in a monomeric or polymeric form. However, recent studies indicate that the presence of Ga in the zeolite framework contributes to the catalyst's performance. This knowledge has been instrumental in refining the synthesis and optimization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, leading to increased efficiency in propylene production through PDH.

对丙烯的高需求已推动了新的生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），这要求更高效和选择性的催化剂。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的PDH理解已显著发展。最近的研究发现表明，Ga物种的性质在催化剂的活性和选择性中起着关键作用。关于Ga物种是单体还是聚合体的争论一直在持续。然而，近期的研究显示，Zeolite框架中的Ga的存在对催化剂的性能有贡献。这些知识在改进和优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的合成和优化方面起到了关键作用，从而提高了通过PDH生产丙烯的效率。
