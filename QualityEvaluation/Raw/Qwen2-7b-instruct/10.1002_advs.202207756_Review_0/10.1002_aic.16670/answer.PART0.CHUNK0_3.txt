[1] "The catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane may occur via dry reforming to produce syngas (CO + H2) or oxidative dehydrogenation to yield propylene."
[2] "Thus, it is of great interest to identify catalytic systems that can either effectively break the C-C bond to generate syngas or selectively break C-H bonds to produce propylene."
[3] "In this study, several precious and non-precious bimetallic catalysts supported on reducible CeO2 were investigated using flow reactor studies at 823 K to identify selective catalysts for CO2-assisted reforming and dehydrogenation of propane."
[4] "Among the Pt and Pd based catalysts with Fe3, Co3, and Ni3 an improvement in both conversion and stability compared to the respective parent monometals was observed for Co3Pd1, Co3Pt1, and Ni3Pt1, shown in Figure 1."
[5] "Compared to Pt1, Fe3Pt1 showed lower steady state conversion and stability but with higher propylene selectivity."
[6] "Both Ni3 and Ni1 were active dry reforming catalysts."
[7] "Of all the Fe-Ni catalysts examined, only Fe3Ni1 was selected for further bimetallic effect experiments."
[8] "The Co3Ni1 catalyst showed higher steady state conversion over both reactants and improved stability compared to Ni1 and Co3, while keeping high CO selectivity that was comparable to Ni1 (but higher than Co3)."
[9] "The Fe3Co1 catalyst was inactive after 12 hours on stream."
[10] "In situ XANES measurements were conducted to examine the oxidation states of the catalysts under reaction conditions, shown in Figure 9."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This has been influenced by the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, which includes debates about active Ga species and recent research findings. The document discusses the evaluation of various bimetallic catalysts, including those with Fe, Co, Ni, Pt, and Pd, for the reactions of CO2+C3H8. It highlights the selectivity and activity differences between Pt- and Pd-based catalysts, as well as the role of Ni3 and Co3 in improving conversion and stability compared to their respective parent monometals. The study also examines the selectivity towards propylene and the activity of different Fe-Ni, Fe-Co, and Co-Ni catalysts. In situ XANES measurements were used to determine the oxidation states of the catalysts under reaction conditions.
