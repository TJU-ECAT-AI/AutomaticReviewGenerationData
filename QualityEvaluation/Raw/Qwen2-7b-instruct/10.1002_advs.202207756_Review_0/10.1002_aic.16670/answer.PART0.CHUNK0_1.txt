[1] "The catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane may occur via dry reforming to produce syngas (CO + H2) or oxidative dehydrogenation to yield propylene."
[2] "Utilizing propane and CO2 as co-reactants presents several advantages over conventional methane dry reforming or direct propane dehydrogenation, including lower operating temperatures and less coke formation."
[3] "The two most relevant reactions for the catalytic conversion of CO2 to CO are reverse water gas shift (RWGS) and dry reforming of methane (DRM)."
[4] "Specifically, it is of interest to explore the use of propane due to its increasing abundance,competitive pricing, and the demand for propylene, which is one of the most diverse petrochemical building blocks used in the production of various chemicals such as fibers and textiles for a variety of applications."
[5] "Currently, propylene is primarily co-produced by steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized cracking of both heavy and light oil."
[6] "Recently, the cracking of lighter feeds has caused a significant gap in propylene production."
[7] "As the demand for propylene increases globally so does the need for more economic on-purpose propylene production processes."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by necessitating more efficient and cost-effective processes. Traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized cracking of both heavy and light oil have been widely used, but the increasing demand for propylene has highlighted gaps in production capacity, especially from lighter feedstocks. This has driven the search for more economic on-purpose propylene production processes. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, with debates around active Ga species and recent research contributing to current knowledge. Although specific details on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are not provided in the text, advancements in PDH technology aim to enhance efficiency and reduce costs in response to the rising demand for propylene.
