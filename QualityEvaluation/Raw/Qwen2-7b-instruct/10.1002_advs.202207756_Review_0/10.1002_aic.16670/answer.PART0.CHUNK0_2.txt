[1] "The catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane may occur via dry reforming to produce syngas (CO + H2) or oxidative dehydrogenation to yield propylene."
[2] "The two most relevant reactions for the catalytic conversion of CO2 to CO are reverse water gas shift (RWGS) and dry reforming of methane (DRM)."
[3] "Thus, it is of great interest to identify catalytic systems that can either effectively break the C-C bond to generate syngas or selectively break C-H bonds to produce propylene."
[4] "Among the Pt and Pd based catalysts with Fe3, Co3, and Ni3 an improvement in both conversion and stability compared to the respective parent monometals was observed for Co3Pd1, Co3Pt1, and Ni3Pt1."
[5] "The Fe3Pt1 catalyst was active and at steady state illustrated 2.6% and 1.1% CO2 and C3H8 conversion, respectively, with 32% and 65% C3H6 and CO selectivities, respectively."
[6] "Compared to monometallic Pt1 and Pd1, the bimetallics with Ni3 and Co3 were not only more active, but also exhibited greater stability."
[7] "In comparison, the FexNiy catalysts exhibited selectivity toward CO2-ODHP, and the selectivity can be further modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition."
[8] "Increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altered the selectivity to favor the DRP pathway rather than CO2-ODHP."

1. The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This demand has led to advancements in understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, including debates around active Ga species and recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts.

2. The catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane can occur through dry reforming to produce syngas (CO + H2) or oxidative dehydrogenation to yield propylene. This process is of great interest for generating useful feedstocks from CO2.

3. Among the Pt and Pd based catalysts with Fe3, Co3, and Ni3, there was an improvement in both conversion and stability for Co3Pd1, Co3Pt1, and Ni3Pt1 compared to their respective parent monometals.

4. The Fe3Pt1 catalyst was active and showed steady state conversions of 2.6% CO2 and 1.1% C3H8, with selectivities of 32% C3H6 and 65% CO.

5. Bimetallic catalysts with Ni3 and Co3 were not only more active but also exhibited greater stability compared to monometallic Pt1 and Pd1.

6. FexNiy catalysts exhibited selectivity towards CO2-ODHP, and this selectivity could be modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition.

7. Increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 in FexNiy catalysts altered the selectivity to favor the DRP pathway over CO2-ODHP.

1. 对丙烯日益增长的需求推动了新的生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这种需求导致了对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解的进展，包括围绕活性Ga物种的辩论以及最近的研究发现，这些发现已经为我们当前对这些催化剂的知识做出了贡献。

2. 通过干重整产生合成气或通过氧化脱氢生成丙烯，CO2由丙烷催化还原的过程具有重要意义，以产生有用的原料。

3. 在Fe3、Co3和Ni3的Pt和Pd基催化剂中，Co3Pd1、Co3Pt1和Ni3Pt1相对于各自的单金属表现出改善的转化率和稳定性。

4. Fe3Pt1催化剂表现出活性，并在稳态下显示出2.6%的CO2转化率和1.1%的C3H8转化率，以及32%的C3H6选择性和65%的CO选择性。

5. Ni3和Co3的双金属催化剂不仅比单金属Pt1和Pd1更活跃，而且表现出更大的稳定性。

6. FexNiy催化剂表现出对CO2-ODHP的选择性，并且可以通过改变bimetallic组合中的Ni含量来修改这种选择性。

7. 将Ni原子比率增加到1以上在FexNiy催化剂中改变了选择性，以有利于DRP途径而不是CO2-ODHP。
