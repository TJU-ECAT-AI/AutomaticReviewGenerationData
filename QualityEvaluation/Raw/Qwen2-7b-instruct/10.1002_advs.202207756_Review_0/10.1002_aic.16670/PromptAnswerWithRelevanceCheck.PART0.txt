[1] "The catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane may occur via dry reforming to produce syngas (CO + H2) or oxidative dehydrogenation to yield propylene."
[2] "Utilizing propane and CO2 as co-reactants presents several advantages over conventional methane dry reforming or direct propane dehydrogenation, including lower operating temperatures and less coke formation."
[3] "In this study,several precious and non-precious bimetallic catalysts supported on reducible CeO2 were investigated using flow reactor studies at 823 K to identify selective catalysts for CO2-assisted reforming and dehydrogenation of propane."
[4] "Compared to Pt1, Fe3Pt1 showed lower steady state conversion and stability but with higher propylene selectivity."
[5] "Changing Fe3 to Co3 with Pt1 (Co3Pt1) not only increased the conversion to 20.3% CO2 and 5.6% C3H8 conversion, but also enhanced the dry reforming pathway with 88.8% CO selectivity."
[6] "The Co3Ni1 catalyst showed higher steady state conversion over both reactants and improved stability compared to Ni1 and Co3, while keeping high CO selectivity that was comparable to Ni1 (but higher than Co3)."
[7] "Doubling the catalyst metal loading but maintaining the 3:1 Fe to Ni ratio (Fe9Ni3) increased the conversion but negatively impacted the selectivity toward propylene (22.5% SC3H6 at 3.4% XC3H6)."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by necessitating more efficient and selective catalysts. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Recent research findings suggest that the nature of Ga species plays a crucial role in the activity and selectivity of these catalysts. There has been ongoing debate about whether the active Ga species are in a monomeric or polymeric form. However, recent studies indicate that the presence of Ga in the zeolite framework contributes to the catalyst's performance. This knowledge has been instrumental in refining the synthesis and optimization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, leading to increased efficiency in propylene production through PDH.

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by necessitating more efficient and cost-effective processes. Traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized cracking of both heavy and light oil have been widely used, but the increasing demand for propylene has highlighted gaps in production capacity, especially from lighter feedstocks. This has driven the search for more economic on-purpose propylene production processes. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, with debates around active Ga species and recent research contributing to current knowledge. Although specific details on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are not provided in the text, advancements in PDH technology aim to enhance efficiency and reduce costs in response to the rising demand for propylene.
