[1] "The catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane may occur via dry reforming to produce syngas (CO + H2) or oxidative dehydrogenation to yield propylene."
[2] "The two most relevant reactions for the catalytic conversion of CO2 to CO are reverse water gas shift (RWGS) and dry reforming of methane (DRM)."
[3] "Specifically, it is of interest to explore the use of propane due to its increasing abundance,competitive pricing, and the demand for propylene, which is one of the most diverse petrochemical building blocks used in the production of various chemicals such as fibers and textiles for a variety of applications."
[4] "Among one of the key differences between CO2-ODHP and O2-ODHP is the overall net reduction of CO2 in the former and possible emission of anthropogenic CO2 in the latter."
[5] "Catalysts were synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of metals onto commercially obtained CeO2 (35-45 m2/g Sigma-Aldrich)."
[6] "The Fe3Ni1 catalyst was inactive after 12 hours on stream."
[7] "The Fe3Ni1 catalyst consisted of metallic Ni and Pt."
[8] "Therefore, both Ni3Pt1 and Ni3Pd1 were DRP catalysts that consisted of metallic phases under reaction conditions and showed improved stability compared to their respective precious metal monometallics."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by pushing for more efficient and selective catalysts. Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with ongoing debates about active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by identifying specific active sites and mechanisms involved in the PDH process. For instance, it has been found that the catalysts can be optimized to enhance propylene yield, while minimizing unwanted byproducts. This evolution in understanding has led to advancements in catalyst design and operational strategies, aiming to improve efficiency and sustainability in propylene production.
