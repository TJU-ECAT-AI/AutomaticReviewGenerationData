[1] "In 2015, SC and FCC combined accounted for 81% of global propylene production capacity."
[2] "PDH can be broadly grouped into two categories: non-oxidative and oxidative."
[3] "Non-oxidative PDH typically exhibits good selectivity for propylene (generally >90%), but low propylene yields (typically < 50%) due to the unfavorable thermodynamics and catalyst deactivation are an obstacle to further market penetration."
[4] "To the authors' knowledge, no ODHP process with O2 has been commercialized, mainly due to its low selectivity for propylene."
[5] "Among these, the Catofin process employs fixed-bed reactors with CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts containing more than 18% CrOx as the active ingredient and 12 wt% alkaline metals as promoters."
[6] "The best-reported TOFPt is more than 1000 times higher than that of TOFCr (Table 1)."
[7] "Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing. Gallium oxide was investigated as a cracking catalyst as early as the 1960s."
[8] "The detailed discussion of Ga speciation and PDH mechanism will be included in the next section."
[9] "Similar to Ga/H-ZSM-5, multiple Zn species have been reported in Zn/H-ZSM-5, that is, isolated Zn2+, isolated [ZnOH]+, multinuclear ZnO clusters, and bulk ZnO aggregates."
[10] "Those conflicting hypotheses could be caused by the different catalyst preparation methods (IE, IWI, CVD, ALD, or solid-state ion exchange with ZnCl2), leading to the formation of different Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM-5."
[11] "An isolated [InH2]+ site was proposed as the active center in these catalysts based on FTIR and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements."
[12] "It was concluded that isolated In+ sites rather than InHx were the stable active site for PDH, which was independent of the Al distribution."

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by shifting focus towards methods that can meet the increasing need for propylene. PDH has become a significant source of propylene production, accounting for about 10% of the global production. Non-oxidative PDH has been the primary focus due to its ability to produce propylene selectively, although the low yield is a challenge. The introduction of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) with oxygen has faced obstacles due to its low selectivity for propylene.

2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly over time. Initially, Ga/H-ZSM-5 was recognized for its dehydrogenation capabilities of light alkanes. However, the debate around the active Ga species has been ongoing. Recent research has provided insights into the speciation of Ga in the catalyst, emphasizing the importance of both Ga/Al ratios and Al distribution in determining its performance. The active site in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts has been proposed to involve various Ga species, including Ga+ and [GaO]+, with the exact structure of the active site being a subject of continuous investigation.

3. The catalyst preparation methods for Ga/H-ZSM-5 have been diverse, including liquid phase ion-exchange, reductive solid-state ion-exchange, and vapor-phase ion-exchange. These methods lead to the introduction of different Ga species, influencing the catalytic activity and selectivity. Understanding the specific speciation of Ga and its impact on the PDH mechanism remains a critical area of research for optimizing the catalyst performance.

4. In contrast to Ga/H-ZSM-5, Zn/H-ZSM-5 has been found to have multiple Zn species, including isolated Zn2+, isolated [ZnOH]+, multinuclear ZnO clusters, and bulk ZnO aggregates. The preparation methods for Zn/H-ZSM-5 can affect the formation of these species, which in turn impacts the catalytic activity and selectivity. Research has highlighted the importance of the speciation of Zn in the catalyst for understanding its behavior in PDH reactions.

5. Indium-based catalysts, such as In/H-CHA, have also received attention for alkane dehydrogenation. These catalysts were initially thought to involve the formation of the active site [InH2]+ based on ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. However, recent research has concluded that isolated In+ sites are the stable active site for PDH, independent of the Al distribution in the catalyst. The intrinsic PDH rate on In+ suggests that it may not be commercially relevant despite its potential activity.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，新的生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），受到了影响。PDH已成为满足这一需求的主要来源之一，约占全球产量的10%。非氧化性PDH因其能够选择性地产生丙烯而受到关注，尽管其较低的产率是一个挑战。与氧气结合的氧化性脱氢（ODHP）过程由于其低的丙烯选择性而面临障碍。

2. 对于镓/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已经显著发展。最初，人们认识到镓/H-ZSM-5具有轻质烷烃脱氢的能力。然而，关于活性镓物种的争论一直持续。最近的研究提供了关于镓在催化剂中的不同种类的见解，强调了镓/铝比例和铝分布对于确定其性能的重要性。镓/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的活性位点被提议涉及各种镓物种，包括Ga+和[GaO]+，具体结构仍然是研究的重点。

3. 镓/H-ZSM-5催化剂的制备方法多种多样，包括液相离子交换、还原固体离子交换和气相离子交换。这些方法导致引入不同的镓物种，影响催化活性和选择性。理解镓的具体种类及其对PDH机制的影响是优化催化剂性能的关键领域。

4. 相比之下，锌/H-ZSM-5催化剂被发现含有多种锌物种，包括孤立的Zn2+、孤立的[ZnOH]+、多核ZnO簇和大量ZnO聚集体。锌/H-ZSM-5催化剂的制备方法可以影响这些物种的形成，进而影响催化活性和选择性。研究表明，锌的种类在催化剂中对于理解其在PDH反应中的行为至关重要。

5. 铟基催化剂，如In/H-CHA，也因烷烃脱氢而受到关注。这些催化剂最初被认为涉及到活性位点[InH2]+的形成，基于离线傅里叶变换红外光谱和第一性原理计算。然而，最近的研究得出结论，孤立的In+位点是PDH的稳定活性位点，与催化剂中的铝分布无关。In+的固有PDH速率表明，尽管其潜在的活性，它可能不具有商业相关性。
