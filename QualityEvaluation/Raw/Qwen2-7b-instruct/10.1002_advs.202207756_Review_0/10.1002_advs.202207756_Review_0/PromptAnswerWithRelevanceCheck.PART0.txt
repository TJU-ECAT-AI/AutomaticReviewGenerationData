[1] "The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030,"

[2] "PDH can be broadly grouped into two categories: non-oxidative and oxidative."

[3] "Among these, the Catofin process employs fixed-bed reactors with CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts containing more than 18% CrOx as the active ingredient and 12 wt% alkaline metals as promoters."

[4] "The Oleflex process employs fluidized bed reactors with Pt-based catalysts, with propane conversion and propylene selectivity of 30-40% and 85.5-88%, respectively."

[5] "As synthesized CrOx-based catalysts contain multiple oxidation states of Cr, including VI, IV, III, and II, but Cr3+ becomes the main species at reaction conditions."

[6] "The ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated."

[7] "Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, that is, Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair."

[8] "We combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites."

Propylene demand has surged, leading to increased interest in new production methods like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through various research methods. Initially, Ga/H-ZSM-5 was recognized for its ability to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes. However, debates over the active Ga species persisted. Recent studies have provided insights into the complex Ga speciation within the zeolite matrix, revealing that the Ga/Al ratio and Al distribution significantly impact the catalyst's performance. This understanding is crucial for developing more active and selective PDH catalysts.

The evolution of knowledge on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH includes the identification of multiple Ga species as potential active centers, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pairs. Researchers have utilized advanced techniques like in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to determine the relationship between Ga speciation and the catalyst's performance. These studies highlight the dependence of Ga speciation on the Ga/Al ratio and Al distribution within the zeolite structure.

Similarly, understanding the active Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts has evolved. Multiple Zn species, including isolated Zn2+, isolated [ZnOH]+, multinuclear ZnO clusters, and bulk ZnO aggregates, have been reported. The synthesis methods, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), and solid-state ion exchange, influence the formation of these Zn species, affecting the catalyst's activity for PDH. Insights into the active Zn species are essential for optimizing the catalyst's performance.

Lastly, the role of In+ sites as the stable active center for PDH on In-CHA catalysts has been established, independent of the Al distribution. This finding contributes to the broader understanding of the active sites in metal-containing zeolite catalysts for PDH. Future research directions aim to address unresolved questions and develop more active and selective PDH catalysts.

丙烯需求的增长，推动了新的生产方法，如丙烷脱氢（PDH）的发展。对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经通过各种研究方法得到了发展。最初，Ga/H-ZSM-5因其能够将轻质烷烃脱氢为烯烃而被认可。然而，关于活性Ga物种的争论持续存在。最近的研究提供了关于Ga在沸石矩阵中复杂物种组成的见解，表明Ga/Al比例和铝分布显著影响催化剂性能。这对于开发更活跃、选择性更高的PDH催化剂至关重要。

在对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解发展方面，包括确定多种Ga物种作为潜在活性中心的可能性，如Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaOH]2+、[GaH]2+、[GaH2]+和Ga+H+对。研究人员利用先进的技术，如原位透射傅里叶变换红外光谱、脉冲滴定法和PDH动力学，来确定Ga物种与催化剂性能之间的关系。这些研究表明，Ga的物种依赖于Ga/Al比率和沸石结构内的Al分布。

类似地，对Zn/H-ZSM-5催化剂中活性Zn物种的理解也有所发展。报告的Zn物种包括孤立的Zn2+、孤立的[ZnOH]+、多核ZnO簇和大块ZnO聚集物。合成方法，如化学气相沉积（CVD）、原子层沉积（ALD）和固体离子交换，会影响这些Zn物种的形成，从而影响催化剂的PDH活性。对于活性Zn物种的洞察对于优化催化剂性能至关重要。

最后，In+位点作为在CHA沸石催化剂上PDH的稳定活性中心的作用被建立起来，独立于Al分布。这一发现为金属含杂沸石催化剂在PDH中的活性位点提供了更广泛的了解。未来的研究方向旨在解决未解决的问题，并开发出更活跃、选择性更高的PDH催化剂。

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by encouraging the exploration of alternative catalysts due to the high cost of Pt and health/environmental concerns associated with Cr. For instance, Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been extensively studied for PDH due to their potential as a cost-effective alternative to Pt. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through various research efforts, including the characterization of active Ga species. Early studies suggested that Ga+ is the dominant species upon reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5. Recent research has provided insights into the Ga speciation and its impact on PDH performance, highlighting the dependency on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions within the zeolite matrix. Additionally, the identification of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation on In/H-CHA catalysts has contributed to the broader understanding of PDH mechanisms on metal-containing zeolite catalysts. These advancements aim to address unresolved questions and enable the development of more active and selective PDH catalysts.

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by shifting focus towards methods that can meet the increasing need for propylene. PDH has become a significant source of propylene production, accounting for about 10% of the global production. Non-oxidative PDH has been the primary focus due to its ability to produce propylene selectively, although the low yield is a challenge. The introduction of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) with oxygen has faced obstacles due to its low selectivity for propylene.

2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly over time. Initially, Ga/H-ZSM-5 was recognized for its dehydrogenation capabilities of light alkanes. However, the debate around the active Ga species has been ongoing. Recent research has provided insights into the speciation of Ga in the catalyst, emphasizing the importance of both Ga/Al ratios and Al distribution in determining its performance. The active site in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts has been proposed to involve various Ga species, including Ga+ and [GaO]+, with the exact structure of the active site being a subject of continuous investigation.

3. The catalyst preparation methods for Ga/H-ZSM-5 have been diverse, including liquid phase ion-exchange, reductive solid-state ion-exchange, and vapor-phase ion-exchange. These methods lead to the introduction of different Ga species, influencing the catalytic activity and selectivity. Understanding the specific speciation of Ga and its impact on the PDH mechanism remains a critical area of research for optimizing the catalyst performance.

4. In contrast to Ga/H-ZSM-5, Zn/H-ZSM-5 has been found to have multiple Zn species, including isolated Zn2+, isolated [ZnOH]+, multinuclear ZnO clusters, and bulk ZnO aggregates. The preparation methods for Zn/H-ZSM-5 can affect the formation of these species, which in turn impacts the catalytic activity and selectivity. Research has highlighted the importance of the speciation of Zn in the catalyst for understanding its behavior in PDH reactions.

5. Indium-based catalysts, such as In/H-CHA, have also received attention for alkane dehydrogenation. These catalysts were initially thought to involve the formation of the active site [InH2]+ based on ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. However, recent research has concluded that isolated In+ sites are the stable active site for PDH, independent of the Al distribution in the catalyst. The intrinsic PDH rate on In+ suggests that it may not be commercially relevant despite its potential activity.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，新的生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），受到了影响。PDH已成为满足这一需求的主要来源之一，约占全球产量的10%。非氧化性PDH因其能够选择性地产生丙烯而受到关注，尽管其较低的产率是一个挑战。与氧气结合的氧化性脱氢（ODHP）过程由于其低的丙烯选择性而面临障碍。

2. 对于镓/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已经显著发展。最初，人们认识到镓/H-ZSM-5具有轻质烷烃脱氢的能力。然而，关于活性镓物种的争论一直持续。最近的研究提供了关于镓在催化剂中的不同种类的见解，强调了镓/铝比例和铝分布对于确定其性能的重要性。镓/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的活性位点被提议涉及各种镓物种，包括Ga+和[GaO]+，具体结构仍然是研究的重点。

3. 镓/H-ZSM-5催化剂的制备方法多种多样，包括液相离子交换、还原固体离子交换和气相离子交换。这些方法导致引入不同的镓物种，影响催化活性和选择性。理解镓的具体种类及其对PDH机制的影响是优化催化剂性能的关键领域。

4. 相比之下，锌/H-ZSM-5催化剂被发现含有多种锌物种，包括孤立的Zn2+、孤立的[ZnOH]+、多核ZnO簇和大量ZnO聚集体。锌/H-ZSM-5催化剂的制备方法可以影响这些物种的形成，进而影响催化活性和选择性。研究表明，锌的种类在催化剂中对于理解其在PDH反应中的行为至关重要。

5. 铟基催化剂，如In/H-CHA，也因烷烃脱氢而受到关注。这些催化剂最初被认为涉及到活性位点[InH2]+的形成，基于离线傅里叶变换红外光谱和第一性原理计算。然而，最近的研究得出结论，孤立的In+位点是PDH的稳定活性位点，与催化剂中的铝分布无关。In+的固有PDH速率表明，尽管其潜在的活性，它可能不具有商业相关性。
