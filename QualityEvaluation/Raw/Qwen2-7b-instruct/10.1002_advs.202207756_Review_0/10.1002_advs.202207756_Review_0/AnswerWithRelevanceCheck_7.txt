Questions:

How has the growing demand for propylene influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), and how has the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH evolved, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species and recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts?

Answers:

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by increasing interest in this process which currently accounts for 10% of global propylene production. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through ongoing debates about active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the characterization method, determination of active structure, and multiple PDH reaction mechanisms. The active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been a subject of debate, with recent studies providing insights into the Ga speciation and PDH mechanism. This has led to a clearer understanding of the active sites involved in PDH, which is crucial for developing more active and selective PDH catalysts.

The growing demand for propylene has shifted focus towards methods capable of meeting the increasing need for propylene, making PDH a significant source of propylene production. Non-oxidative PDH has been the primary focus due to its ability to produce propylene selectively, although the low yield is a challenge. The introduction of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) with oxygen has faced obstacles due to its low selectivity for propylene. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly over time, recognizing its dehydrogenation capabilities of light alkanes. However, the debate around the active Ga species has been ongoing. Recent research has provided insights into the speciation of Ga in the catalyst, emphasizing the importance of both Ga/Al ratios and Al distribution in determining its performance. The active site in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts has been proposed to involve various Ga species, including Ga+ and [GaO]+, with the exact structure of the active site being a subject of continuous investigation. Catalyst preparation methods for Ga/H-ZSM-5 have been diverse, including liquid phase ion-exchange, reductive solid-state ion-exchange, and vapor-phase ion-exchange, leading to the introduction of different Ga species that influence the catalytic activity and selectivity.

The catalyst preparation methods for Ga/H-ZSM-5 have been diverse, including liquid phase ion-exchange, reductive solid-state ion-exchange, and vapor-phase ion-exchange. These methods lead to the introduction of different Ga species, influencing the catalytic activity and selectivity. Understanding the specific speciation of Ga and its impact on the PDH mechanism remains a critical area of research for optimizing the catalyst performance.

In contrast to Ga/H-ZSM-5, Zn/H-ZSM-5 has been found to have multiple Zn species, including isolated Zn2+, isolated [ZnOH]+, multinuclear ZnO clusters, and bulk ZnO aggregates. The preparation methods for Zn/H-ZSM-5 can affect the formation of these species, which in turn impacts the catalytic activity and selectivity. Research has highlighted the importance of the speciation of Zn in the catalyst for understanding its behavior in PDH reactions.

Indium-based catalysts, such as In/H-CHA, have also received attention for alkane dehydrogenation. These catalysts were initially thought to involve the formation of the active site [InH2]+ based on ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. However, recent research has concluded that isolated In+ sites are the stable active site for PDH, independent of the Al distribution in the catalyst. The intrinsic PDH rate on In+ suggests that it may not be commercially relevant despite its potential activity.
