Questions:

1. How has the growing demand for propylene influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), and how has the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH evolved, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species and recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts?

Relevant Answers:

1. The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030.
2. PDH can be broadly grouped into two categories: non-oxidative and oxidative.
3. Among these, the Catofin process employs fixed-bed reactors with CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts containing more than 18% CrOx as the active ingredient and 12 wt% alkaline metals as promoters.
4. As synthesized CrOx-based catalysts contain multiple oxidation states of Cr, including VI, IV, III, and II, but Cr3+ becomes the main species at reaction conditions.
5. Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing. Gallium oxide was investigated as a cracking catalyst as early as the 1960s.
6. The ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated.
7. Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, that is, Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair.
8. We combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites.
9. Similar to Ga/H-ZSM-5, multiple Zn species have been reported in Zn/H-ZSM-5, that is, isolated Zn2+, isolated [ZnOH]+, multinuclear ZnO clusters, and bulk ZnO aggregates.
10. It was concluded that isolated In+ sites rather than InHx were the stable active site for PDH, which was independent of the Al distribution.

English Answer:
The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to meet the increasing need for propylene. PDH, as a significant source of propylene production, accounts for approximately 10% of the global production. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through ongoing debates on the active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the catalyst preparation methods, determination of active structure, and multiple PDH reaction mechanisms. The active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been a subject of debate, with recent studies providing insights into the Ga speciation and PDH mechanism. This has led to a clearer understanding of the active sites involved in PDH, which is crucial for developing more active and selective PDH catalysts.

Chinese Answer:
随着丙烯需求的增长，新的生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），受到了推动以满足不断增加的需求。PDH作为丙烯生产的重要来源，约占全球产量的约10%。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已经通过关于活性Ga物种的持续辩论而发展。最近的研究发现为我们当前对这些催化剂的知识做出了贡献，包括催化剂的制备方法、活性结构的确定和PDH反应机制的多个方面。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的活性Ga物种一直是讨论的主题，最近的研究提供了有关Ga物种分类和PDH机制的见解。这有助于我们对参与PDH的活性位点有更清晰的理解，这对于开发更高效、选择性更强的PDH催化剂至关重要。
