Questions:

1. How has the growing demand for propylene influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), and how has the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH evolved, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species and recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts?

Answers:

Relevant Answers:

- The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030.
- PDH can be broadly grouped into two categories: non-oxidative and oxidative.
- Among these, the Catofin process employs fixed-bed reactors with CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts containing more than 18% CrOx as the active ingredient and 12 wt% alkaline metals as promoters.
- As synthesized CrOx-based catalysts contain multiple oxidation states of Cr, including VI, IV, III, and II, but Cr3+ becomes the main species at reaction conditions.
- The ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated.
- Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, that is, Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair.
- We combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites.
- Similar to Ga/H-ZSM-5, multiple Zn species have been reported in Zn/H-ZSM-5, that is, isolated Zn2+, isolated [ZnOH]+, multinuclear ZnO clusters, and bulk ZnO aggregates.
- It was concluded that isolated In+ sites rather than InHx were the stable active site for PDH, which was independent of the Al distribution.

Summary:

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), leading to increased interest in exploring alternative catalysts. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have emerged as a focus due to their potential as a cost-effective alternative to platinum. The understanding of these catalysts has evolved through various research efforts, including the characterization of active Ga species. It is now known that different Ga species, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair, can play roles as active centers in PDH. Research has shown that the performance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts depends on both the Ga/Al ratio and the Al distribution within the zeolite structure. Similar studies on Zn/H-ZSM-5 and In-CHA catalysts have also contributed to the broader understanding of PDH mechanisms on metal-containing zeolite catalysts.
