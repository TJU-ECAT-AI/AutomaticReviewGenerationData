[1] "In 2015, SC and FCC combined accounted for 81% of global propylene production capacity."
[2] "PDH can be broadly grouped into two categories: non-oxidative and oxidative. In non-oxidative PDH, propane is catalytically dehydrogenated to produce stoichiometric amounts of propylene and hydrogen."
[3] "To achieve significant propylene yields, PDH typically operates at 550–700°C."
[4] "Non-oxidative PDH typically exhibits good selectivity for propylene (generally >90%), but low propylene yields (typically <50%) due to the unfavorable thermodynamics and catalyst deactivation."
[5] "Most recently, Yan et al. reported that In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst achieves 22% propylene yield at 450°C with C3H8:O2 = 2:1 (32% propane conversion and 70% propylene selectivity)."
[6] "For Ga-based catalysts, different supports, such as SiO2, Al2O3, SBA-15, MFI, and H-ZSM-5, have been used to prepare Ga-based catalysts, achieving TOFGa between 8 and 2120 h−1 (Table 1)."
[7] "Although it is still more than ten times lower than that of Pt-based catalysts, the marked difference in the cost of the two metals makes the Ga-based catalyst a promising alternative."
[8] "Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing. Gallium oxide was investigated as a cracking catalyst as early as the 1960s."
[9] "Early studies suggested that Ga+ is the dominant species upon reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5."
[10] "We combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites."
[11] "The ability of Zn/H-ZSM-5 to catalyze alkane dehydrogenation was recognized in the 1980s, and has been widely investigated ever since."
[12] "Nozik et al. recently employed solid-state ion exchange of ZnCl2 with H-ZSM-5 to prepare Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalyst to investigate the effect of Zn/Al ratios on Zn speciation and PDH rates."
[13] "Jones and co-workers investigated In2O3-Ga2O3 and ternary In-Ga-Al mixed oxides as catalysts for PDH."
[14] "Lobo and co-workers recently investigated the In speciation in In-CHA catalysts through the combination of in situ FTIR spectroscopy, pulse titrations, and PDH kinetics."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by encouraging the exploration of alternative catalysts due to the high cost of Pt and health/environmental concerns associated with Cr. For instance, Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been extensively studied for PDH due to their potential as a cost-effective alternative to Pt. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through various research efforts, including the characterization of active Ga species. Early studies suggested that Ga+ is the dominant species upon reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5. Recent research has provided insights into the Ga speciation and its impact on PDH performance, highlighting the dependency on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions within the zeolite matrix. Additionally, the identification of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation on In/H-CHA catalysts has contributed to the broader understanding of PDH mechanisms on metal-containing zeolite catalysts. These advancements aim to address unresolved questions and enable the development of more active and selective PDH catalysts.
