[1] "The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030."
[2] "The rapid increase in shale gas productionwith its substantial content of natural gas liquids[6] and thus propane[5]has led to increased interest in PDH: it currently accounts for 10% of global propylene production."
[3] "Among these, the Catofin process employs fixed-bed reactors with CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts containing more than 18% CrOx as the active ingredient and 12 wt% alkaline metals as promoters."
[4] "As synthesized CrOx-based catalysts contain multiple oxidation states of Cr, including VI, IV, III, and II, but Cr3+ becomes the main species at reaction conditions."
[5] "Cr-based catalysts show TOF between 8 and 2120 h1, and propylene selectivity between 90% and 98%."
[6] "Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing. Gallium oxide was investigated as a cracking catalyst as early as the 1960s."
[7] "Ga2O22+ sites in H-ZSM-5 exhibit TOFGa at least one order of magnitude higher than other Ga-based catalysts."
[8] "Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites."
[9] "The detailed discussion of Ga speciation and PDH mechanism will be included in the next section."
[10] "Similar to Ga/H-ZSM-5, multiple Zn species have been reported in Zn/H-ZSM-5, that is, isolated Zn2+, isolated [ZnOH]+, multinuclear ZnO clusters, and bulk ZnO aggregates."
[11] "Bulk ZnO is known to heterolytically cleave H2 even at liquid nitrogen temperature,[115] suggesting the possibility of the ZnO clusters in MFI pores to activate the HH and CH bond."
[12] "An isolated [InH2]+ site was proposed as the active center in these catalysts based on FTIR and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements."
[13] "It was concluded that isolated In+ sites rather than InHx were the stable active site for PDH, which was independent of the Al distribution."
[14] "The low intrinsic PDH rate on In+ makes it less likely to be commercially relevant (Figure 1)."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by increasing interest in this process which currently accounts for 10% of global propylene production. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through ongoing debates about active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, including the characterization method, determination of active structure, and multiple PDH reaction mechanisms. The active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been a subject of debate, with recent studies providing insights into the Ga speciation and PDH mechanism. This has led to a clearer understanding of the active sites involved in PDH, which is crucial for developing more active and selective PDH catalysts.
