[1] "The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030,"

[2] "PDH can be broadly grouped into two categories: non-oxidative and oxidative."

[3] "Among these, the Catofin process employs fixed-bed reactors with CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts containing more than 18% CrOx as the active ingredient and 12 wt% alkaline metals as promoters."

[4] "The Oleflex process employs fluidized bed reactors with Pt-based catalysts, with propane conversion and propylene selectivity of 30-40% and 85.5-88%, respectively."

[5] "As synthesized CrOx-based catalysts contain multiple oxidation states of Cr, including VI, IV, III, and II, but Cr3+ becomes the main species at reaction conditions."

[6] "The ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated."

[7] "Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, that is, Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair."

[8] "We combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites."

[9] "Similar to Ga/H-ZSM-5, multiple Zn species have been reported in Zn/H-ZSM-5, that is, isolated Zn2+, isolated [ZnOH]+, multinuclear ZnO clusters, and bulk ZnO aggregates."

[10] "It was concluded that isolated In+ sites rather than InHx were the stable active site for PDH, which was independent of the Al distribution."

Propylene demand has surged, leading to increased interest in new production methods like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through various research methods. Initially, Ga/H-ZSM-5 was recognized for its ability to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes. However, debates over the active Ga species persisted. Recent studies have provided insights into the complex Ga speciation within the zeolite matrix, revealing that the Ga/Al ratio and Al distribution significantly impact the catalyst's performance. This understanding is crucial for developing more active and selective PDH catalysts.

The evolution of knowledge on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH includes the identification of multiple Ga species as potential active centers, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pairs. Researchers have utilized advanced techniques like in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to determine the relationship between Ga speciation and the catalyst's performance. These studies highlight the dependence of Ga speciation on the Ga/Al ratio and Al distribution within the zeolite structure.

Similarly, understanding the active Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts has evolved. Multiple Zn species, including isolated Zn2+, isolated [ZnOH]+, multinuclear ZnO clusters, and bulk ZnO aggregates, have been reported. The synthesis methods, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), and solid-state ion exchange, influence the formation of these Zn species, affecting the catalyst's activity for PDH. Insights into the active Zn species are essential for optimizing the catalyst's performance.

Lastly, the role of In+ sites as the stable active center for PDH on In-CHA catalysts has been established, independent of the Al distribution. This finding contributes to the broader understanding of the active sites in metal-containing zeolite catalysts for PDH. Future research directions aim to address unresolved questions and develop more active and selective PDH catalysts.

丙烯需求的增长，推动了新的生产方法，如丙烷脱氢（PDH）的发展。对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经通过各种研究方法得到了发展。最初，Ga/H-ZSM-5因其能够将轻质烷烃脱氢为烯烃而被认可。然而，关于活性Ga物种的争论持续存在。最近的研究提供了关于Ga在沸石矩阵中复杂物种组成的见解，表明Ga/Al比例和铝分布显著影响催化剂性能。这对于开发更活跃、选择性更高的PDH催化剂至关重要。

在对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解发展方面，包括确定多种Ga物种作为潜在活性中心的可能性，如Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaOH]2+、[GaH]2+、[GaH2]+和Ga+H+对。研究人员利用先进的技术，如原位透射傅里叶变换红外光谱、脉冲滴定法和PDH动力学，来确定Ga物种与催化剂性能之间的关系。这些研究表明，Ga的物种依赖于Ga/Al比率和沸石结构内的Al分布。

类似地，对Zn/H-ZSM-5催化剂中活性Zn物种的理解也有所发展。报告的Zn物种包括孤立的Zn2+、孤立的[ZnOH]+、多核ZnO簇和大块ZnO聚集物。合成方法，如化学气相沉积（CVD）、原子层沉积（ALD）和固体离子交换，会影响这些Zn物种的形成，从而影响催化剂的PDH活性。对于活性Zn物种的洞察对于优化催化剂性能至关重要。

最后，In+位点作为在CHA沸石催化剂上PDH的稳定活性中心的作用被建立起来，独立于Al分布。这一发现为金属含杂沸石催化剂在PDH中的活性位点提供了更广泛的了解。未来的研究方向旨在解决未解决的问题，并开发出更活跃、选择性更高的PDH催化剂。
