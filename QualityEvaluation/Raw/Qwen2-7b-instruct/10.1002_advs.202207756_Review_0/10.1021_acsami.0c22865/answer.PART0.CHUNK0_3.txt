Answer: The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process converts propane into propylene, which is essential for the production of various chemical products, including plastics and synthetic fibers. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, addressing the ongoing debate about the active Ga species involved in the catalytic process. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, highlighting the importance of the subsurface regulation of PtGa nanoparticles confined in silicalite-1 for enhancing the efficiency of PDH.
