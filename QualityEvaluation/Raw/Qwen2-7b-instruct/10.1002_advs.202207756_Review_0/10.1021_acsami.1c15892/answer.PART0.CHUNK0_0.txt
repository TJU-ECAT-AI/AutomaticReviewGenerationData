1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process converts propane into propylene, a key chemical used in various industries. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, focusing on the active Ga species involved in the catalytic process. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, addressing debates around their effectiveness and performance.
