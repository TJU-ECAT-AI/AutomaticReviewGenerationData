[1] "Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research [911,2123]."
[2] "However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock [3]. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to producing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based cat- alyst, have been commercialized [4,5]."
[3] "This was supported by FTIR spectroscopic and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic stability analysis [11]."
[4] "The Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions,and DFT calculations."
[5] "In this work, we employ in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratio (01.7)."
[6] "A one-to-one correspondence in the consumption of BAS and Ga loading is found in samples with low Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios by quantitative FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine, however,exchange with BAS becomes increasingly difficult at higher Ga loadings due to the scarcity of BAS."
[7] "This is supported by spectral observations with water as a probe molecule, in which only isolated Ga+ can be oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH, while Ga+H+ pair sites, regardless of the existence of GaHx species, do not react with water."

1. The demand for propylene has led to the exploration of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Despite decades of research, the identity of active Ga species on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH remains uncertain.

2. The gap between propylene demand and supply, due to increased natural gas availability, has encouraged the development of alternative production methods, like PDH. Commercial PDH processes include Catofin and Oleflex.

3. FTIR spectroscopy and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic analysis, provided support for the use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

4. Ga+H+ paired sites have shown higher activity than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst in PDH reactions.

5. Researchers used in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy to investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

6. Quantitative FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine revealed a one-to-one relationship between the consumption of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) and Ga loading in low Si/Al and Ga/Al ratio samples. The exchange becomes more challenging at higher Ga loadings due to limited BAS availability.

7. Spectral observations with water as a probe molecule showed that only isolated Ga+ sites can react with water at 150 C, forming GaOOH. Ga+H+ pair sites do not react with water, suggesting differences in their catalytic properties.

1. 丙烯需求的增长促使了新生产方法的研发，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。尽管几十年的研究，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂上PDH反应活性物种的身份仍然存在争议。

2. 随着天然气供应量的增加导致丙烯供需缺口扩大，PDH成为了替代生产丙烯的有效方式。商业PDH过程包括Catofin和Oleflex。

3. FTIR光谱和NH3-TPD结果，以及热力学稳定性分析，为使用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂提供了支持。

4. Ga+H+配对位点在PDH反应中比单个Ga+位点和基础H-ZSM-5催化剂表现出更高的活性。

5. 研究人员使用原位传输FTIR光谱研究了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂上的Ga物种分布。

6. 使用吡啶进行定量FTIR光谱分析显示，在低Si/Al和Ga/Al比例样品中，BAS消耗与Ga负载成一对一关系。随着Ga负载增加，由于BAS数量有限，交换变得更加困难。

7. 通过水作为探针分子的光谱观察发现，只有孤立的Ga+位点能在150°C下与水反应形成GaOOH。Ga+H+配对位点无论是否存在GaHx物种，都不与水反应，这表明它们可能具有不同的催化性质。
