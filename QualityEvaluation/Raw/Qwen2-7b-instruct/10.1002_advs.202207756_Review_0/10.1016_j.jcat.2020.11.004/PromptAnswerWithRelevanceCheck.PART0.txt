[1] "Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research [911,2123]."
[2] "However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock [3]. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to producing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based cat- alyst, have been commercialized [4,5]."
[3] "This was supported by FTIR spectroscopic and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic stability analysis [11]."
[4] "The Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions,and DFT calculations."
[5] "In this work, we employ in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratio (01.7)."
[6] "A one-to-one correspondence in the consumption of BAS and Ga loading is found in samples with low Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios by quantitative FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine, however,exchange with BAS becomes increasingly difficult at higher Ga loadings due to the scarcity of BAS."
[7] "This is supported by spectral observations with water as a probe molecule, in which only isolated Ga+ can be oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH, while Ga+H+ pair sites, regardless of the existence of GaHx species, do not react with water."

1. The demand for propylene has led to the exploration of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Despite decades of research, the identity of active Ga species on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH remains uncertain.

2. The gap between propylene demand and supply, due to increased natural gas availability, has encouraged the development of alternative production methods, like PDH. Commercial PDH processes include Catofin and Oleflex.

3. FTIR spectroscopy and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic analysis, provided support for the use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

4. Ga+H+ paired sites have shown higher activity than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst in PDH reactions.

5. Researchers used in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy to investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

6. Quantitative FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine revealed a one-to-one relationship between the consumption of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) and Ga loading in low Si/Al and Ga/Al ratio samples. The exchange becomes more challenging at higher Ga loadings due to limited BAS availability.

7. Spectral observations with water as a probe molecule showed that only isolated Ga+ sites can react with water at 150 C, forming GaOOH. Ga+H+ pair sites do not react with water, suggesting differences in their catalytic properties.

1. The growing demand for propylene has encouraged the development of alternative production methods such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The catalyst Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been recognized for its efficiency in dehydrogenating and dehydroaromatizing alkanes. Despite extensive research, the exact nature of active Ga species, their role in PDH, and the reaction mechanism remain subjects of ongoing debate.
2. Much of the understanding about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has been deduced from ex-situ analyses. To gain insights into this issue, researchers have applied in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy to study Ga speciation in catalyst samples with varying Si/Al ratios and Ga/Al ratios.
3. The formation of Ga hydrides and the consumption of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) show divergent trends, indicating that not all Ga species that replace BAS are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction.
4. It is hypothesized that Ga+H+ pairs, formed when Ga+ replaces a paired BAS, are the species capable of forming GaHx compounds, based on spectroscopic observations.
5. The distinct properties of isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair species are evident when exposed to water at 150°C, further suggesting potential differences in their catalytic activity in PDH reactions.

[1] "Propylene plays a central role in the chemical industry infrastructure and it is used for the production of a wide range of chemicals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene [1]."

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to producing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based catalyst, have been commercialized [4,5]."
[4] "The high cost of Pt and the health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incentivized development of other PDH catalysts [4], such as Ga- [612], Zn- [13], Co- [1416], V-based [17] and ZrO2 [1820] catalysts."
[5] "Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research [911,2123]."
[6] "A number of Ga species, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga (OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 based on several experimental and computational techniques [911,24,2628]."
[7] "Early in-situ X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the utilized reducing gas [24,29], which is consistent with a more recent report by Schreiber et al. [10]"
[8] "Recently, Phadke et al. [9] proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, and the catalysts reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio. This was supported by FTIR spectroscopic and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic stability analysis [11]."
[9] "FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments in these studies were conducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state [11], where the Ga speciation could be quite different from that of the reduced sample."
[10] "In this work, we employ in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratio (01.7)."
[11] "These observations offer direct experimental evidence for the presence of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species. This conclusion is further supported by FTIR investigations using water as a probe molecule; these show that isolated Ga+ sites on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples can be quickly oxidized by water at 150 C while Ga+H+ pair sites cannot."

Answer: The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as a potential alternative to traditional methods that rely on natural gas. This shift has been driven by the increasing abundance of natural gas as a feedstock. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Despite decades of research, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion. Recent research findings have provided direct experimental evidence for the presence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5: Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species. This conclusion is supported by FTIR investigations using water as a probe molecule, which showed that isolated Ga+ sites can be quickly oxidized by water at 150°C while Ga+H+ pair sites cannot.

答案：对丙烯需求的增长已经影响了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），作为替代传统依赖天然气的方法。这一转变是由于天然气作为原料的供应增加所驱动的。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经显著进化。尽管研究了数十年，但催化活性位点的身份和PDH反应机制仍然是活跃讨论的话题。最近的研究发现提供了直接的实验证据，证明在还原的Ga/H-ZSM-5样品上存在两种Ga物种：Ga+H+配对位点和孤立的Ga+位点。这一结论得到了使用水作为探针分子的FTIR调查的支持，结果表明，在150°C时，孤立的Ga+位点可以快速被水氧化而Ga+H+配对位点不能。

The development of Ga-based catalysts for PDH, including Ga/H-ZSM-5, has been ongoing, but the active Ga species and their role in the PDH reaction remain topics of debate. Recent research has provided insights into the speciation of Ga on H-ZSM-5, showing that Ga species exchange with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) to form Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species. The properties of these species, especially their reactivity towards water, suggest they might have different catalytic activities in PDH reactions.
