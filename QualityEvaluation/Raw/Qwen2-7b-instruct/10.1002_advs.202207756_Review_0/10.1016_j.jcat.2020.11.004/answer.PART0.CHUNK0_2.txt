[1] "Propylene plays a central role in the chemical industry infrastructure and it is used for the production of a wide range of chemicals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene [1]."
[2] "However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock [3]."
[3] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to producing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based catalyst, have been commercialized [4,5]."
[4] "The high cost of Pt and the health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incentivized development of other PDH catalysts [4], such as Ga- [612], Zn- [13], Co- [1416], V-based [17] and ZrO2 [1820] catalysts."
[5] "Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research [911,2123]."
[6] "A number of Ga species, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga (OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 based on several experimental and computational techniques [911,24,2628]."
[7] "Early in-situ X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the utilized reducing gas [24,29], which is consistent with a more recent report by Schreiber et al. [10]"
[8] "Recently, Phadke et al. [9] proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, and the catalysts reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio. This was supported by FTIR spectroscopic and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic stability analysis [11]."
[9] "FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments in these studies were conducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state [11], where the Ga speciation could be quite different from that of the reduced sample."
[10] "In this work, we employ in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratio (01.7)."
[11] "These observations offer direct experimental evidence for the presence of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species. This conclusion is further supported by FTIR investigations using water as a probe molecule; these show that isolated Ga+ sites on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples can be quickly oxidized by water at 150 C while Ga+H+ pair sites cannot."

Answer: The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as a potential alternative to traditional methods that rely on natural gas. This shift has been driven by the increasing abundance of natural gas as a feedstock. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Despite decades of research, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion. Recent research findings have provided direct experimental evidence for the presence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5: Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species. This conclusion is supported by FTIR investigations using water as a probe molecule, which showed that isolated Ga+ sites can be quickly oxidized by water at 150°C while Ga+H+ pair sites cannot.

答案：对丙烯需求的增长已经影响了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），作为替代传统依赖天然气的方法。这一转变是由于天然气作为原料的供应增加所驱动的。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经显著进化。尽管研究了数十年，但催化活性位点的身份和PDH反应机制仍然是活跃讨论的话题。最近的研究发现提供了直接的实验证据，证明在还原的Ga/H-ZSM-5样品上存在两种Ga物种：Ga+H+配对位点和孤立的Ga+位点。这一结论得到了使用水作为探针分子的FTIR调查的支持，结果表明，在150°C时，孤立的Ga+位点可以快速被水氧化而Ga+H+配对位点不能。
