1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Despite decades of research, the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH remains a topic of active discussion, focusing on Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites, and the reaction mechanism of PDH. 

2. Various Ga species, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga (OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5. Early studies suggested that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5.

3. Ga+H+ paired sites were found to be more active than single Ga+ sites, and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst, based on reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations.

4. Quantitative FTIR experiments revealed that not all Brnsted acid sites (BAS) can be exchanged by Ga species, even at high Ga/Al ratios up to 1.7 during the reduction treatment.

5. The ability to form Ga hydride species after H2 treatment at 550°C is limited to Al-rich zeolites with lower Si/Al ratios.

6. The threshold Ga/Al ratio (0.13) on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) at which the combined GaHx band area levels off as Ga loading increases coincides with the transition point.

7. Ga+H+ pair sites, formed by exchanging Ga+ with paired BAS, are capable of forming GaHx species, distinguishing them from isolated Ga+ sites.

8. Water vapor treatment at 550°C leads to the recovery of BAS and the formation of Ga(OH)x species on Ga/H-ZSM-5.

9. Upon water introduction at 150°C, the production of H2 confirms water's role as an oxidant.

10. The band at 2052 cm−1 is assigned to GaOOH, indicating that GaHx species do not react with water at 150°C.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，已经开发出了新的生产方法，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。尽管几十年的研究，对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的作用的理解仍然是一个活跃讨论的话题，重点关注Ga物种的特征，催化活性位点的身份和PDH反应机制。

2. 多种Ga物种，包括Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga (OH)]2+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaH2]+、[GaH]2+，在Ga/H-ZSM-5的还原后已被提出。早期的研究表明，在Ga/H-ZSM-5中孤立的Ga+离子是主要物种。

3. Ga+H+配对位点被发现比单个Ga+位点和母体H-ZSM-5催化剂更活跃，基于反应性、定量脉冲反应和DFT计算。

4. 定量FTIR实验显示，即使在高达1.7的Ga/Al比值的还原处理过程中，也并非所有Brnsted酸位点（BAS）都能被Ga物种交换。

5. 在550°C的H2处理后形成Ga氢化物物种的能力仅限于Al含量高、Si/Al比率低的沸石。

6. Ga/H-ZSM-5（Si/Al = 15）中，结合Ga负载增加时GaHx峰面积水平的阈值Ga/Al比率（0.13）与GaHx峰面积开始平稳的点相匹配。

7. 通过与配对BAS相互作用交换Ga+形成的Ga+H+对位点能够形成GaHx物种，区别于孤立的Ga+位点。

8. 在550°C下，水蒸气处理导致BAS的恢复和Ga(OH)x物种在Ga/H-ZSM-5上的形成。

9. 在150°C下引入水产生H2，证实了水作为氧化剂的作用。

10. 位于2052 cm−1的谱带被分配为GaOOH，表明GaHx物种在150°C下不会与水反应。
