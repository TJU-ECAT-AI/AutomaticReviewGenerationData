[1] "Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research [911,2123]."
[2] "However, much of this information has been inferred from ex-situ characterizations."
[3] "To address these questions, in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy is employed to investigate the Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratio (01.7)."
[4] "These diverging trends for the Ga hydride formation and the BAS consumption indicate that not all Ga species exchanged with the BAS are capable of form- ing Ga hydrides upon reduction."
[5] "We propose that the Ga+H+ pair sites formed by exchanging Ga+ with one of the paired BAS is the species capable of forming GaHx species based on the spec- troscopic observation (Fig. 5a and b)."
[6] "This result then verifies that the reactivity of isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair species are quite different."

1. The growing demand for propylene has encouraged the development of alternative production methods such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The catalyst Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been recognized for its efficiency in dehydrogenating and dehydroaromatizing alkanes. Despite extensive research, the exact nature of active Ga species, their role in PDH, and the reaction mechanism remain subjects of ongoing debate.
2. Much of the understanding about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has been deduced from ex-situ analyses. To gain insights into this issue, researchers have applied in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy to study Ga speciation in catalyst samples with varying Si/Al ratios and Ga/Al ratios.
3. The formation of Ga hydrides and the consumption of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) show divergent trends, indicating that not all Ga species that replace BAS are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction.
4. It is hypothesized that Ga+H+ pairs, formed when Ga+ replaces a paired BAS, are the species capable of forming GaHx compounds, based on spectroscopic observations.
5. The distinct properties of isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair species are evident when exposed to water at 150°C, further suggesting potential differences in their catalytic activity in PDH reactions.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，已经开发出了替代生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂因其在烷烃脱氢和脱芳化方面的高效性而受到认可。尽管进行了大量研究，但活性Ga物种、其在PDH中的作用以及反应机制仍然是争论的焦点。
2. 对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解主要来自于离线分析。为了深入了解这一问题，研究人员使用了原位传输傅里叶变换红外光谱法来研究具有不同Si/Al比率和Ga/Al比率的催化剂样本中的Ga物种分布。
3. Ga氢化物的形成和BAS消耗的趋势存在差异，表明并非所有替换BAS的Ga物种都能够在还原后形成Ga氢化物。
4. 认为当Ga+替换配对的BAS时形成的Ga+H+对是能够形成GaHx化合物的物种，这是基于光谱观察得出的结论。
5. 当暴露于150°C的水时，孤立的Ga+和Ga+H+对表现出不同的性质，进一步表明它们在PDH反应中可能具有不同的催化活性。
