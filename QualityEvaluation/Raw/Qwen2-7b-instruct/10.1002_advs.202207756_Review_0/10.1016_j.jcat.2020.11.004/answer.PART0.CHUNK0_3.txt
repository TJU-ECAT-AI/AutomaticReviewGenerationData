[1] "Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research [911,2123]."

[2] "The Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions,and DFT calculations."

[3] "FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments in these studies were con-ducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state [11], where the Ga spe- ciation could be quite different from that of the reduced sample."

[4] "Isolated Ga+ exchanged with isolated BAS are produced on samples with a high Si/Al ratio."

[5] "Spectral features of GaHx observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples at 550 C show that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than isolated Ga+ sites, which provides the first direct experimental evi- dence of inhomogeneity of exchanged Ga species."

[6] "The drastically different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 upon reaction with H2 at 550 C and water at 150 C strongly suggest the possibility that they could have different cat- alytic properties in the PDH."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH processes like Catofin and Oleflex have been commercialized. The development of Ga-based catalysts for PDH, including Ga/H-ZSM-5, has been ongoing, but the active Ga species and their role in the PDH reaction remain topics of debate. Recent research has provided insights into the speciation of Ga on H-ZSM-5, showing that Ga species exchange with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) to form Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species. The properties of these species, especially their reactivity towards water, suggest they might have different catalytic activities in PDH reactions.

对于丙烯日益增长的需求已经影响了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。商业化生产的Catofin和Oleflex等PDH过程已经问世。基于Ga的催化剂，包括Ga/H-ZSM-5，用于PDH的发展一直在进行中，但Ga活性物种及其在PDH反应中的作用仍然是讨论的焦点。最近的研究为H-ZSM-5上的Ga物种提供了见解，表明Ga物种与Brnsted酸位点（BAS）交换形成Ga+H+对物种和孤立的Ga+物种。这些物种的性质，尤其是它们与水的反应性，表明它们可能在PDH反应中具有不同的催化性质。
