[1] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
[2] "Vanadium-based catalysts have garnered increased interest as alternative materials to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for the DDH reaction, to their comparative low cost and toxicity."
[3] "A comparative approach to study the effect of the support acidity was taken by Szeto et al. through which marked differences were observed in the reactivity of silica and alumina supported Ga catalysts."
[4] "Utilizing a pH-controlled incipient-wetness impregnation method the resultant catalyst contained a high proportion of isolated Lewis acidic Ga3+ sites dispersed on SiO2, with the ability to activate hydrocarbon CH bonds with up to 99% selectivity through a non-redox pathway at 550 C."
[5] "Generally, the oxidation state of vanadium (i.e., V3+, V4+, V5+) determines the catalytic activity."
[6] "It was reported that at 1 wt% V/AlSiOx (with 10 wt% SiO2 in the support) was only around 25% less active than a PtSn/Al2O3 comparison sample."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by increasing interest in more sustainable and economically viable processes. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Szeto et al.'s comparative study showed marked differences in reactivity between silica and alumina supported gallium catalysts. Cybulskis et al. utilized a pH-controlled impregnation method to create gallium catalysts with a high proportion of isolated Lewis acidic Ga3+ sites, which activated hydrocarbon CH bonds with high selectivity. The nature of vanadium, specifically its oxidation state, plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity of vanadium-based catalysts. Sokolov et al.'s investigation revealed that gallium catalysts supported on AlSiOx with 10 wt% SiO2 were only 25% less active than PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, indicating potential for more active gallium catalysts in PDH.

丙烯需求的增长已经推动了新型生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），的发展，这增强了对更可持续和经济可行过程的兴趣。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经显著发展。Szeto等人进行的比较研究显示了硅酸盐和氧化铝支持的镓催化剂之间的显着差异反应性。Cybulskis等人使用pH控制的浸渍法来创建具有高比例孤立路易斯酸性Ga3+位点的镓催化剂，这些位点通过非还原途径激活了碳氢化合物CH键，并且具有高达99%的选择性。钒的性质，尤其是其氧化态，在确定钒基催化剂的催化活性中起着关键作用。Sokolov等人进行的研究表明，含有10 wt% SiO2的AlSiOx支持的镓催化剂仅比PtSn/Al2O3催化剂低25%，暗示有可能开发出更高效的镓催化剂用于PDH。
