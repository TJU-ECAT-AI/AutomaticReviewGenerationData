[1] "Overall, each dehydrogenation reaction has unique operating conditions and challenges, which are dictated by their thermodynamics. In the case of DDH, the formation of coke remains the biggest challenge, as it is thermodynamically favoured under conditions that enable high propane conversion."
[2] "The importance of Al speciation in improving catalyst performance and stability was investigated by Shi et al. The effect of surface penta-coordinated (AlV), Al3+ sites on a PtSn/γ-Al2O3 nanosheet catalyst was investigated and after a 24 h reaction, a 4.1% drop in propane conversion with 45% propene yield was observed, corresponding to a STY of 95 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 3, entry 8)."
[3] "The Ga/SiO2 catalyst was reported to have low activity (8% conversion initially) and moderately high selectivity to propene (90%) under identical testing conditions. This highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate support for different active centres."
[4] "It was found that all the catalysts modified with K displayed respectable regeneration ability as well as an improvement in the catalyst's STY, which was measured to be 13 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 4, entry 5)."

1. The formation of coke is the primary challenge in direct dehydrogenation (DDH) processes, as it is energetically favorable under conditions that allow for high propane conversion. 

2. Surface penta-coordinated (AlV) and Al3+ sites on a PtSn/γ-Al2O3 nanosheet catalyst can lead to a 4.1% drop in propane conversion and a 45% propene yield after 24 hours of reaction, corresponding to a space time yield (STY) of 95 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1.

3. The Ga/SiO2 catalyst demonstrates low initial activity (8% conversion) and moderate selectivity (90%) to propene, indicating the significance of choosing the right support for achieving optimal activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

4. Catalysts modified with potassium (K) exhibit improved regeneration ability and a higher space time yield (STY) of 13 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, highlighting the potential benefits of incorporating potassium in the catalyst design for dehydrogenation processes.

1. 在直接脱氢（DDH）过程中，焦炭的形成是主要挑战，因为它在能够实现高丙烷转化的条件下是热力学上有利的。

2. 表面五配位（AlV）和Al3+ 离子在PtSn/γ-Al2O3纳米片催化剂上的存在会导致24小时反应后丙烷转化率降低4.1%，丙烯产率提高到45%，对应的时空产率为95 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1。

3. Ga/SiO2催化剂显示出初始活性较低（8%转化率）和中等的丙烯选择性（90%），表明选择合适的支撑对于实现最优的活性和选择性在脱氢反应中的重要性。

4. 通过钾（K）改性的催化剂表现出改善的再生能力和更高的时空产率（STY）为13 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1，这突显了在脱氢过程中设计催化剂时引入钾的潜在益处。
