[1] "The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by necessitating more efficient and sustainable processes. PDH offers a pathway to produce propylene without relying on traditional oil refining methods."

[2] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH have evolved significantly, with researchers focusing on understanding the active Ga species responsible for the dehydrogenation process. Various models propose that Ga forms Ga-OH groups, which act as strong Lewis acids and facilitate the activation of propane."

[3] "Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts by identifying the role of the zeolite framework in stabilizing Ga-OH species. Studies have also explored the effect of modifying the zeolite structure to enhance the stability and selectivity of the Ga catalysts."

[4] "The ongoing debate about active Ga species has led to the investigation of different Ga loading strategies and support materials to optimize the catalyst performance. These efforts aim to improve the yield of propylene while minimizing unwanted side reactions, such as cracking and overoxidation."

[5] "New insights into the reaction mechanism have revealed that the Ga-OH groups interact with propane molecules, facilitating the breaking of the C-H bonds and the subsequent dehydrogenation process. This understanding has guided the development of more effective Ga-based catalysts for PDH."
