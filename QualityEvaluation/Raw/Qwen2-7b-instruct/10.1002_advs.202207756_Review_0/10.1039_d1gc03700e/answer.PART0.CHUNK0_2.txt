[1] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. Although propane is a minor component in shale gas, it is facile to separate and therefore represents a valuable, but non-renewable source of propane."
[2] "The most common deactivation pathway is coking, which can cause sintering in both the support and Cr. Efforts to improve catalyst design include using supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity, both of which aid mass transfer and avoid undesirable secondary reactions."
[3] "In comparison to Pt catalysts, CrOx catalysts generally exhibit lower STYs, although the most active CrOx catalysts (typically supported on Al2O3) are as active as moderate supported Pt catalysts."
[4] "An initial conversion and selectivity of 24% and 79%, respectively, were reported for Ga/Al2O3. The STY was 5.9 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 5, entry 4)."
[5] "Generally, the oxidation state of vanadium (i.e., V3+, V4+, V5+) determines the catalytic activity.132 In addition, the distribution of V oxidation states is controlled by the V loading, which in turn influences the degree of polymerization. It has been reported that V5+ is the least active, whereas V4+ and V3+ species (generated from the reduction of V5+) are more active in the DDH reaction."

1. The rising demand for propylene has fueled the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the falling price of propane as a result of shale gas discoveries in North America. Propane is considered a valuable, albeit non-renewable, source of propylene. 

2. The primary reason for the deactivation of catalysts is coking, which can lead to sintering in both the support and chromium components. Efforts to improve catalyst design include utilizing supports with ordered mesoporosity and moderate surface acidity, which facilitate mass transfer and prevent unwanted secondary reactions.

3. Chromium oxide-based catalysts generally yield lower space-time yields (STYs) compared to platinum catalysts. However, the most active chromium oxide catalysts, typically supported on aluminum oxide, demonstrate performance on par with moderate platinum catalysts.

4. A Ga/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited an initial conversion of 24% and selectivity of 79%, resulting in an STY of 5.9 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 5, entry 4).

5. Vanadium's catalytic activity is determined by its oxidation state (V3+, V4+, V5+). V5+ is the least active, whereas V4+ and V3+ species, generated from the reduction of V5+, are more active in the PDH reaction. The distribution of vanadium oxidation states is influenced by its loading, affecting the degree of polymerization.

1. 石油裂解对丙烯的需求增加，促进了新型生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），因为北美页岩气储量的发现导致丙烷价格下跌。丙烷被视为一种有价值的、但不可再生的丙烯来源。

2. 催化剂失效的主要原因是焦化，这可能导致支持和铬组件的熔结。改进催化剂设计的努力包括使用具有有序介孔结构和适度表面酸性的支持材料，这些有助于物质传递并防止副反应。

3. 铬氧化物基催化剂的时空产率（STY）通常低于铂催化剂。然而，最活跃的铬氧化物催化剂，通常是铝氧化物支持的，其性能与适度的铂催化剂相当。

4. 一个Ga/Al2O3催化剂表现出初始转化率为24%，选择性为79%，产生了一个STY为5.9 molC3H6 kg1cat h1（表5，第4项）。

5. 钒的催化活性由其氧化态（V3+、V4+、V5+）决定。V5+是最不活跃的，而V4+和V3+物种（从V5+还原产生）在PDH反应中更活跃。钒氧化态分布受到其负载的影响，影响聚合度。
