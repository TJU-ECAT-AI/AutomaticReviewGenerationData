[1] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
[2] "Direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
[3] "Overall, each dehydrogenation reaction has unique operating conditions and challenges, which are dictated by their thermodynamics. In the case of DDH, the formation of coke remains the biggest challenge, as it is thermodynamically favoured under conditions that enable high propane conversion. In ODH-CO2, dry reforming is also a competing pathway under typical reaction conditions and in the case of ODH-O2, overoxidation is prevalent due to CO2 being the thermodynamically favoured product."
[4] "As a feedstock, C3H8 is non-toxic, unlike methanol in the MTO process. The high flammability of C3H8 may present a safety risk in a chemical plant, but such a risk is present in all forms of C3H6 production."
[5] "While the results in this work reveal a crucial role in the sub-surface composition of the catalyst, this aspect of catalyst design is often overlooked."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by encouraging researchers to explore more environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. This shift towards PDH has been further stimulated by the fall in propane prices due to the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America. PDH is seen as a more sustainable option due to its high atom economy, lack of toxic reactants or by-products, and potential utilization of renewable feedstocks.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the understanding of these catalysts has evolved significantly. Initially, there was a debate about the active Ga species, with some suggesting that isolated Ga3+ sites were the key active centers for CH activation. However, recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge by elucidating that the active sites might involve a combination of Ga species, possibly including Ga3+ and Ga2O3, interacting with the H-ZSM-5 framework. This interaction is thought to facilitate the activation of CH bonds without undergoing a redox process, leading to enhanced selectivity and stability in the PDH reaction.

The operating conditions and challenges associated with different dehydrogenation processes have also been clarified. For instance, direct dehydrogenation (DDH) faces the challenge of coke formation, which is thermodynamically favored under high propane conversion conditions. Oxidative dehydrogenation with oxygen (ODH-O2) is prone to overoxidation, and oxidative dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide (ODH-CO2) faces issues with dry reforming and the formation of coke when using CO2 as the oxidant. These thermodynamic tendencies necessitate careful kinetic control to optimize the yield of propene.

The non-toxic nature of propane, while presenting a safety risk due to its high flammability, is a shared characteristic among all forms of propene production. This risk underscores the importance of robust safety measures in chemical plants utilizing propane as a feedstock.

The role of sub-surface composition in catalyst design has been recognized as a crucial factor that often goes overlooked. Studies have shown that the composition of the sub-surface layers can significantly impact the performance of supported nanoparticles, affecting the activation of reactants and the overall stability of the catalyst. This finding highlights the need for a more nuanced approach to catalyst design, taking into account not just the surface properties but also the internal structure of the catalyst particles.

丙烯需求的增长已经推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），这促使研究者探索更环保的替代方案，比如传统的蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解。由于北美地区发现了大量页岩气储备，丙烷价格下跌，进一步促进了PDH的发展。PDH因其高原子经济性、不使用有毒反应物或副产物以及理论上可利用可再生能源作为原料而被视为更具可持续性的选择。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用，对这些催化剂的理解已有所发展。最初，关于活性Ga物种的讨论存在分歧，有人认为孤立的Ga3+位点是CH激活的关键活性中心。然而，最近的研究结果为我们的当前知识提供了补充，表明活性位点可能包括Ga3+和Ga2O3与H-ZSM-5框架的相互作用，这有助于在不经历氧化还原过程的情况下激活CH键，从而提高PDH反应的选择性和稳定性。

不同脱氢过程的操作条件和挑战也得到了澄清。例如，在直接脱氢（DDH）中面临的挑战是焦炭形成，这是在高丙烷转化条件下热力学上有利的现象。使用氧气的氧化脱氢（ODH-O2）容易发生过氧化，而使用二氧化碳的氧化脱氢（ODH-CO2）面临干重整和使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂时焦炭形成的问题。这些热力学倾向需要仔细的动力学控制来优化丙烯的产率。

丙烷的非毒性虽然带来了化工厂使用丙烷作为原料的安全风险，但由于其高度易燃性，这也是所有形式的丙烯生产共有的特征。这强调了在使用丙烷作为原料的化工厂中采取稳健安全措施的重要性。

子表面组成在催化剂设计中的作用被认识到是一个关键因素，通常被忽视。研究表明，催化剂颗粒的子表面层的组成可以显著影响性能，影响反应物的活化和催化剂的整体稳定性。这一发现突出了催化剂设计需要更加细致的方法，不仅考虑表面性质，还要考虑催化剂颗粒的内部结构。

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by providing a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional cracking processes. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with ongoing debates about the active Ga species. Research has contributed to our current knowledge by showing that Ga3+ species are crucial for CH activation, while studies like those by Cybulskis et al. have revealed that the preparation strategy can greatly influence the structure of Ga/SiO2 catalysts, leading to high selectivity for PDH.

2. The addition of tin (Sn) to Pt-based catalysts enhances propene selectivity, lowers support acidity, and promotes the diffusion of coke away from the active Pt site. This improves the overall performance and stability of the catalyst in PDH reactions.

3. Platinum (Pt) has been found to be the most effective catalyst for PDH due to its low transition state energy for CH bond activation, consistently outperforming other transition metals in both theoretical and experimental studies. Araujo-Lopez et al.'s DFT calculations support this claim by demonstrating that Pt has the lowest transition state energy for both non-oxidative and oxidative CH bond activation.

4. Different supports can significantly impact the reactivity of Ga catalysts in PDH reactions. For instance, silica-supported Ga catalysts may exhibit lower activity compared to alumina-supported Ga catalysts, as shown in Szeto et al.'s study. This highlights the importance of selecting the right support to optimize catalyst performance.

5. The preparation of Ga/SiO2 catalysts can greatly influence their structure and activity. Cybulskis et al. demonstrated that using a pH-controlled incipient-wetness impregnation method can result in a high proportion of isolated Lewis acidic Ga3+ sites on SiO2. These sites are capable of activating hydrocarbon CH bonds with high selectivity through a non-redox pathway at 550°C, showcasing the potential of Ga-based catalysts for PDH.

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by increasing interest in more sustainable and economically viable processes. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Szeto et al.'s comparative study showed marked differences in reactivity between silica and alumina supported gallium catalysts. Cybulskis et al. utilized a pH-controlled impregnation method to create gallium catalysts with a high proportion of isolated Lewis acidic Ga3+ sites, which activated hydrocarbon CH bonds with high selectivity. The nature of vanadium, specifically its oxidation state, plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity of vanadium-based catalysts. Sokolov et al.'s investigation revealed that gallium catalysts supported on AlSiOx with 10 wt% SiO2 were only 25% less active than PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, indicating potential for more active gallium catalysts in PDH.
