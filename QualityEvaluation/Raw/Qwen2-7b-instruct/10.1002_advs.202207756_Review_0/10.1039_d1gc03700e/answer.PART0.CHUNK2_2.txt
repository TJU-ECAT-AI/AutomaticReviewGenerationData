丙烯需求的增长已经影响了生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），这需要更高效和环境友好的过程。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂对于PDH的演变显著，活性Ga物种是研究者持续辩论的话题。最近的研究为这些催化剂提供了新的理解。研究表明，负责PDH活性的Ga物种不仅仅是Ga3+物种，还包括先前被认为不活跃的Ga2+物种。在沸石骨架上的Ga2+物种对于PDH活性至关重要，这表明我们对Ga物种反应性的传统观点需要被修订。最近的研究还强调了沸石框架酸性在调节Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂PDH活性中的重要性。提高Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的PDH选择性和稳定性仍然是一个重大挑战，但正在进行的研究继续推动我们对这些催化剂的理解和应用边界。
