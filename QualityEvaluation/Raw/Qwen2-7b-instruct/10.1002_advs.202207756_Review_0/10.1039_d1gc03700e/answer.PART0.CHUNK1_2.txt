The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Gallium (Ga)-based catalysts, especially those utilizing Ga/H-ZSM-5, have gained attention due to their potential to enhance PDH efficiency. There is ongoing debate regarding the active Ga species involved in these catalysts, and recent research has contributed to a better understanding of their roles and interactions within the zeolite framework. Advanced characterization techniques have provided insights into the behavior of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts during PDH, helping clarify the role of gallium in promoting activity and selectivity. Although the debate about the exact nature of active Ga species continues, current research findings are advancing the optimization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH.
