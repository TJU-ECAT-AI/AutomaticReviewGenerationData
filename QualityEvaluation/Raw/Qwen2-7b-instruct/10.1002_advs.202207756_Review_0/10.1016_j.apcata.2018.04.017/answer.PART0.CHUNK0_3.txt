1. The increasing demand for propylene has led to the development of more efficient and eco-friendly production methods, with propane dehydrogenation (PDH) being one of these methods. Traditionally, the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst system has been utilized for PDH, yet the exact nature of the active gallium (Ga) species within these catalysts is still under debate. Recent studies have provided insights into the role of Ga in the PDH process, contributing to a deeper understanding of the catalyst's effectiveness.
