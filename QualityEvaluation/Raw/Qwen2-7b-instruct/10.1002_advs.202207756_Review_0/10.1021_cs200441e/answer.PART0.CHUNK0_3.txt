The increasing demand for propylene has prompted advancements in production techniques, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The utilization of gallium (Ga) on hydrogenated zeolite ZSM-5 (Ga/H-ZSM-5) has been a focal point of investigation in PDH processes. There remains a contentious discussion regarding the active forms of gallium species within these catalysts. Recent studies have provided insights that have enhanced our comprehension of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.
