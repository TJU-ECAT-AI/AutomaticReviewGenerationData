The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This has sparked interest in enhancing the efficiency of PDH processes. Recent studies have concentrated on the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts used in PDH, focusing on the active Ga species. An ongoing debate exists regarding the nature of these active Ga species, as they play a crucial role in the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. Recent research has contributed valuable insights into the mechanisms of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH, advancing our understanding of these catalysts.
