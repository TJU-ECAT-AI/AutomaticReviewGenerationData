<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Answer: The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the need for more efficient and selective catalysts. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly over time, addressing the ongoing debate about active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by focusing on the importance of clustered cationic Zn complexes in enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts.
