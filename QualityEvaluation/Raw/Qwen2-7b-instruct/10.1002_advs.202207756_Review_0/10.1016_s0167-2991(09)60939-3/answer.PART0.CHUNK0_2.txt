[1] "The conversion of propene into aromatic hydrocarbons over H-, Ga-, and Zn-ZSM-5 and the corresponding borosilicates has been studied."
[2] "The yield of aromatic hydrocarbons is greatly enhanced by introducing Ga or Zn cations into ZSM-5 or the borosilicate."
[3] "Over ZSM-5, the interconversion of olefins proceeds much faster than the aromatization, giving a variety of aromatic hydrocarbons."
[4] "Over borosilicates, the rate of the olefin interconversion proceeds much more slowly, and the main aromatic products from propene and I-butene are benzene and xylenes, respectively, at least at low conversion levels and at higher reaction temperatures."
[5] "Zn-borosilicate has no activity for propane conversion, while it shows a good activity for propene aromatization, indicating that zinc cations have no direct interaction with alkanes, but they activate olefinic species."
[6] "It is concluded that zinc or gallium cations act as a dehydrogenation catalyst to give allylic species from olefins in the conversion of both alkanes and alkenes."
[7] "The transformation of alkanes into more useful chemicals like aromatics is of great importance in the respect of the effective utilization of hydrocarbon resources."
[8] "The present authors have studied the conversion of propane and pentane over gallium containing zeolites and concluded that the gallium species have nothing to do with the activation of alkane molecules, but take part in the pathway from alkenes to aromatics."
[9] "Here, alkenes are supposed to be the primary products from alkanes. Therefore, in order to clear the role of gallium or zinc species, it is essential to examine the interaction of alkenes with incorporated metal species."
[10] "The present work concerns with the conversion of propene over H-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM-5, and Zn-ZSM-5. For comparison, the conversion over borosilicates is also studied."

1. The study investigates the conversion of propene into aromatic hydrocarbons using various catalysts such as H-, Ga-, and Zn-ZSM-5, along with their borosilicate counterparts. The introduction of Ga or Zn cations significantly increases the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons compared to their absence.

2. Over ZSM-5, the process of olefin interconversion occurs much faster than the aromatization, resulting in diverse aromatic hydrocarbons. In contrast, over borosilicates, the rate of olefin interconversion is slower, leading to primarily benzene and xylenes as products from propene and I-butene, respectively.

3. Zinc borosilicates show no activity for propane conversion but exhibit good activity for propene aromatization. This indicates that zinc cations do not directly interact with alkanes but activate olefinic species instead.

4. Zinc and gallium cations act as dehydrogenation catalysts, transforming olefins into allylic species during the conversion of both alkanes and alkenes. This conclusion is based on observations made in the conversion of both alkanes and alkenes using these catalysts.

5. The transformation of alkanes into more valuable chemicals, such as aromatics, is crucial for the efficient utilization of hydrocarbon resources. Gallium or zinc species in zeolites enhance the capability of these materials for aromatization.

6. The study by the present authors explores the conversion of propane and pentane over gallium-containing zeolites, concluding that gallium species play a role in the pathway from alkenes to aromatics rather than directly activating alkane molecules.

7. Alkenes are considered the primary products from alkanes, necessitating the examination of the interaction between alkenes and incorporated metal species to clarify the role of gallium or zinc species in the conversion process.

8. The current work focuses on the propene conversion over H-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM-5, and Zn-ZSM-5 catalysts, and compares this with the conversion over borosilicates.

1. 研究了丙烯在H-、Ga-、Zn-ZSM-5及其对应的硼硅酸盐催化剂上的转化成芳烃的过程。添加Ga或Zn离子显著提高了芳烃的产率。

2. 在ZSM-5上，烯烃互变异构比芳香化快得多，产生各种芳烃。而在硼硅酸盐上，烯烃互变异构速率较慢，从丙烯和异丁烯得到的主要芳烃产物是苯和二甲苯，至少在低转化率和较高反应温度下。

3. 钴硼硅酸盐对丙烷转化没有活性，但对于丙烯芳香化显示良好的活性，表明钴离子与烷烃没有直接作用，而是激活了烯烃基团。

4. 铝和镓或锌离子作为脱氢催化剂，在烷烃和烯烃的转化中将烯烃转化为烯醇基物种。这一结论基于在使用这些催化剂进行烷烃和烯烃转化时观察到的现象。

5. 烷烃向更有价值的化学物质，如芳烃的转变对于有效利用碳氢化合物资源至关重要。在沸石中加入镓或锌可以增强这些材料的芳香化能力。

6. 现在的研究探索了丙烷和戊烷在含镓沸石上的转化，结论是镓物种参与了从烯烃到芳烃的途径，而不是直接激活烷烃分子。

7. 考虑到烯烃是从烷烃产生的，有必要研究烯烃与掺入金属物种之间的相互作用，以阐明镓或锌物种在转化过程中的作用。

8. 当前的工作专注于丙烯在H-ZSM-5、Ga-ZSM-5和Zn-ZSM-5催化剂上的转化，并将其与硼硅酸盐的转化进行了比较。
