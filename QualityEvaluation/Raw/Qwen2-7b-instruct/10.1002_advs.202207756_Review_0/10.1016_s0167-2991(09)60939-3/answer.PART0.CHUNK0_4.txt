[1] "The transformation of alkanes into more useful chemicals like aromatics is of great importance in the respect of the effective utilization of hydrocarbon resources."
[2] "Over ZSM-5, the interconversion of olefins proceeds much faster than the aromatization, giving a variety of aromatic hydrocarbons."
[3] "Over borosilicates, the rate of the olefin interconversion proceeds much more slowly, and the main aromatic products from propene and I-butene are benzene and xylenes, respectively, at least at low conversion levels and at higher reaction temperatures."
[4] "It is concluded that zinc or gallium cations act as a dehydrogenation catalyst to give allylic species from olefins in the conversion of both alkanes and alkenes."
[5] "The yield of aromatic hydrocarbons is greatly enhanced by introducing Ga or Zn cations into ZSM-5 or the borosilicate."
[6] "It is worthwhile to note that ethene and butenes are formed appreciably at the early stage, where the yield of aromatics was still very low, indicating that the interconversion between olefins is very fast and precedes the aromatization."
[7] "Over H-borosilicate the yield of aromatics was very small even at 873 K."
[8] "Over Zn-borosilicate the aromatic hydrocarbons were produced in yields of 25 and 45% and 773 K and 873 K, respectively."
[9] "The fact that zinc cations are effective for the dehydrogenation of olefins was further supported by the reaction of I-butene over Zn-borosilicate."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, including debates about the active Ga species. Recent research findings have provided insights into the mechanism of PDH catalysis by Ga/H-ZSM-5, confirming the role of Ga cations as dehydrogenation catalysts.

2. The introduction of Ga or Zn cations into ZSM-5 or borosilicate significantly enhances the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons during the conversion process. This is due to the faster interconversion of olefins facilitated by Ga or Zn cations, leading to a variety of aromatic hydrocarbons.

3. The rate of olefin interconversion over borosilicates is notably slower compared to ZSM-5. As a result, at low conversion levels and higher temperatures, the main aromatic products from propene and I-butene are benzene and xylenes, respectively.

4. Zinc or gallium cations play a crucial role in the conversion of both alkanes and alkenes, acting as dehydrogenation catalysts to produce allylic species. This has been confirmed through studies on the use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH processes.

5. In the context of PDH, the interconversion between olefins occurs rapidly, often preceding the aromatization process. This rapid interconversion is evident from the formation of ethene and butenes even at low aromatic yield stages.

6. When examining borosilicate catalysts, the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons is notably lower compared to ZSM-5 catalysts. Even at high temperatures, the yield remains minimal, indicating the lack of activity for aromatic hydrocarbon formation.

7. Incorporating zinc into borosilicate catalysts has shown to induce aromatization activity, with benzene being the predominant aromatic product at high temperatures. This demonstrates that zinc cations can effectively convert olefins into aromatic hydrocarbons.

8. The effectiveness of zinc cations in dehydrogenation processes is further supported by studies involving the conversion of I-butene over Zn-borosilicate. High yields of butadiene were achieved, indicating the potential of zinc in facilitating the formation of aromatic compounds from olefins.

9. The use of Zn-borosilicate catalysts in PDH processes has revealed that zinc cations are effective for the conversion of olefins into aromatic hydrocarbons. This finding contributes to the broader understanding of the role of metal cations in chemical transformations, particularly in the context of hydrocarbon processing.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，已经开发出了新的生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的作用有了深入的理解，包括关于活性Ga物种的争论。最近的研究结果提供了PDH催化机制的见解，证实了Ga离子作为脱氢催化剂的作用。

2. 将Ga或Zn离子引入ZSM-5或硼硅酸盐中显著提高了芳烃生成量，在转化过程中。这是由于由Ga或Zn离子促进的烯烃间转化速度更快，导致产生多种芳烃。

3. 与ZSM-5相比，硼硅酸盐的烯烃间转化速率明显较慢。在较低转化率和较高温度下，丙烯和异丁烯的主要芳烃产物分别是苯和二甲苯。

4. 锌或镓离子在烷烃和烯烃的转换过程中起着关键作用，作为脱氢催化剂产生烯醇基物种。这已经在使用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂进行PDH过程的研究中得到确认。

5. 在PDH过程中，烯烃间的快速转化往往先于芳构化过程发生。从低芳烃产率阶段形成的乙烯和丁烯可以清楚地看出这一点。

6. 当研究硼硅酸盐催化剂时，芳烃生成量明显低于ZSM-5催化剂。即使在高温下，产率也极低，表明缺乏芳烃形成活性。

7. 在硼硅酸盐中加入锌可以诱导芳香化作用，苯在高温下是主要的芳香产物。这表明锌离子可以有效地将烯烃转化为芳香化合物。

8. 对于在Zn-borosilicate催化剂上进行的I-丁烯转化过程，锌离子在促进从烯烃到芳香化合物的转化方面显示出有效性。高丁二烯产率的实现进一步支持了锌在化学转化中的作用，特别是在烃类加工领域。

9. 使用Zn-borosilicate催化剂进行PDH过程揭示了锌离子在将烯烃转化为芳香化合物方面的有效性。这一发现扩大了我们对金属离子在化学转换中作用的理解，尤其是在烃类处理领域的应用。
