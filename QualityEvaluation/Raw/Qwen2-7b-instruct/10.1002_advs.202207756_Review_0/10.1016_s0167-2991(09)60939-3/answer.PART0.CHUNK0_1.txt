[1] "The conversion of propene into aromatic hydrocarbons over H-, Ga-, and Zn-ZSM-5 and the corresponding borosilicates has been studied."
[2] "The yield of aromatic hydrocarbons is greatly enhanced by introducing Ga or Zn cations into ZSM-5 or the borosilicate."
[3] "Over ZSM-5, the interconversion of olefins proceeds much faster than the aromatization, giving a variety of aromatic hydrocarbons."
[4] "Over borosilicates, the rate of the olefin interconversion proceeds much more slowly, and the main aromatic products from propene and I-butene are benzene and xylenes, respectively, at least at low conversion levels and at higher reaction temperatures."
[5] "Zn-borosilicate has no activity for propane conversion, while it shows a good activity for propene aromatization, indicating that zinc cations have no direct interaction with alkanes, but they activate olefinic species."
[6] "It is concluded that zinc or gallium cations act as a dehydrogenation catalyst to give allylic species from olefins in the conversion of both alkanes and alkenes."
[7] "The transformation of alkanes into more useful chemicals like aromatics is of great importance in the respect of the effective utilization of hydrocarbon resources."
[8] "The present authors have studied the conversion of propane and pentane over gallium containing zeolites and concluded that the gallium species have nothing to do with the activation of alkane molecules, but take part in the pathway from alkenes to aromatics."
[9] "In order to clear the role of gallium or zinc species, it is essential to examine the interaction of alkenes with incorporated metal species."
[10] "This work concerns with the conversion of propene over H-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM-5, and Zn-ZSM-5. For comparison, the conversion over borosilicates is also studied."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which converts propane into propylene. This process is crucial for the effective utilization of hydrocarbon resources. Research has focused on enhancing the conversion of propene into aromatic hydrocarbons using various catalysts, including ZSM-5 zeolites modified with gallium (Ga) or zinc (Zn) ions. The introduction of Ga or Zn cations into these catalysts significantly improves the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons. Over ZSM-5 zeolites, the interconversion of olefins occurs much faster than aromatization, resulting in a variety of aromatic hydrocarbons. In contrast, over borosilicates, the rate of olefin interconversion is slower, leading to the formation of benzene and xylenes as the main aromatic products from propene and I-butene, respectively. Zinc borosilicate lacks activity for propane conversion but shows excellent activity for propene aromatization, indicating that zinc ions do not directly interact with alkanes but activate olefinic species. Zinc and gallium ions act as dehydrogenation catalysts, transforming olefins into allylic species during the conversion of both alkanes and alkenes. Gallium species in zeolites have been found to play a role in the pathway from alkenes to aromatics, rather than activating alkane molecules directly. The study of interactions between alkenes and incorporated metal species is essential for understanding the role of Ga and Zn in propene conversion processes.

丙烯日益增长的需求推动了新型生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），该过程将丙烷转化为丙烯。这一过程对于有效利用碳氢化合物资源至关重要。研究聚焦于使用各种催化剂提高丙烯转化为芳香烃的转化率，包括添加镓（Ga）或锌（Zn）离子的ZSM-5沸石。在这些催化剂中引入Ga或Zn离子显著提高了芳香烃的产率。在ZSM-5沸石中，烯烃的互变比芳构化快得多，导致多种芳香烃的生成。相比之下，在硼硅酸盐中，烯烃互变的速度较慢，从丙烯和异丁烯产生的主要芳香产物分别为苯和二甲苯。锌硼硅酸盐对丙烷转化无活性，但对丙烯芳构化有很好的活性，表明锌离子不直接与烷烃相互作用，而是激活烯烃物种。锌和镓离子作为脱氢催化剂，在烷烃和烯烃的转化过程中将烯烃转化为烯丙基物种。Zn-ZSM-5中发现的镓物种在从烯烃到芳香烃的路径中起作用，而不是直接激活烷烃分子。研究烯烃与嵌入金属物种的相互作用对于理解Ga和Zn在丙烯转化过程中的作用至关重要。
