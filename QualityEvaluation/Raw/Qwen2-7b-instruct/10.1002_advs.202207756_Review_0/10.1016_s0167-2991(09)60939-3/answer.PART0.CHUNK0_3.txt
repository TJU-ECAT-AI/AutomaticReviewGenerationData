[1] "The transformation of alkanes into more useful chemicals like aromatics is of great importance in the respect of the effective utilization of hydrocarbon resources."
[2] "Over ZSM-5, the interconversion of olefins proceeds much faster than the aromatization, giving a variety of aromatic hydrocarbons."
[3] "Over borosilicates, the rate of the olefin interconversion proceeds much more slowly, and the main aromatic products from propene and I-butene are benzene and xylenes, respectively, at least at low conversion levels and at higher reaction temperatures."
[4] "It is concluded that zinc or gallium cations act as a dehydrogenation catalyst to give allylic species from olefins in the conversion of both alkanes and alkenes."
[5] "The present authors have studied the conversion of propane and pentane over gallium containing zeolites and concluded that the gallium species have nothing to do with the activation of alkane molecules, but they take part in the pathway from alkenes to aromatics."
[6] "Therefore, in order to clear the role of gallium or zinc species, it is essential to examine the interaction of alkenes with incorporated metal species."
[7] "The conversion of propene over H-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM-5 and Zn-ZSM-5 was carried out."
[8] "For comparison, the conversion over borosilicates is also studied."
[9] "The effect of the reaction temperature on the product distribution in the conversion of propene over H-ZSM-S and Ga-ZSM-S was examined."
[10] "Over H-ZSM-5, the conversion of propene was over 9S% below 673 K, while it decreased to about 80% over 773 K."
[11] "The yield of aromatics was almost constant at 30% over 573 K."
[12] "Over Ga-ZSM-5, the total conversion and the selectivity were much higher than those obtained with H-ZSM-S."
[13] "The total conversion was almost 100% and the selectivity to aromatics reached 7S% at longer contact time."

[15] "Over Zn-borosilicate the selectivity to benzene as high as 50% among aromatic products was obtained at 873 K."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process involves transforming propane into propylene, which is a crucial feedstock for the petrochemical industry. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Early studies by Mole et al. and the present authors revealed that zinc cations play a key role in the dehydrogenation of olefins to produce allylic species, which then undergo aromatization. This process is more efficient over Ga/ZSM-5 compared to H-ZSM-5, due to the faster interconversion of olefins and enhanced aromatization capabilities. Recent research has confirmed that zinc or gallium cations act as dehydrogenation catalysts, facilitating the conversion of both alkanes and alkenes into useful chemical products. The study also highlighted the importance of examining the interaction of alkenes with incorporated metal species to better understand the role of gallium or zinc in the conversion processes.

The findings indicate that over Zn-borosilicate, aromatic hydrocarbons are produced with high efficiency, especially benzene, suggesting that zinc cations are effective in converting olefins into aromatic hydrocarbons. This is in contrast to H-borosilicate and Zn-ZSM-5, which show limited activity for propane conversion and aromatic hydrocarbons production, respectively. The selectivity to benzene is notably high at 50% in Zn-borosilicate, indicating a comparable rate of aromatization to the interconversion among olefins over these less acidic catalysts. These insights contribute to the ongoing debate about the active Ga species and provide a clearer picture of the mechanisms involved in PDH catalysis.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH过程涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯，这是石化行业的重要原料。对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已经显著发展。早期由Mole等人和当前作者的研究表明，锌离子在烯烃脱氢生成烯丙基物种中起关键作用，然后这些物种进一步进行芳香化。与H-ZSM-5相比，在Ga/ZSM-5上，这一过程更高效，主要是由于烯烃间快速互转化和增强的芳香化能力。近期研究确认了锌或镓离子作为脱氢催化剂的作用，促进了烷烃和烯烃向有用化学产品的转化。

研究结果表明，相对于Zn-borosilicate，丙烷转化为芳香烃的效率更高，特别是苯，这表明锌离子有效于烯烃转化为芳香烃。相比之下，H-borosilicate和Zn-ZSM-5对于丙烷转化和芳香烃生产显示出有限的活性。Zn-borosilicate中苯的选择性高达50%，显示其芳香化速率与较酸性催化剂中的烯烃间互转化相当。这些发现为正在进行的关于活性Ga物种的辩论提供了新的见解，并为PDH催化机制提供了一幅更清晰的画面。
