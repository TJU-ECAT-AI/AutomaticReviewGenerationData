[1] "The transformation of alkanes into more useful chemicals like aromatics is of great importance in the respect of the effective utilization of hydrocarbon resources."
[2] "It is known that gallium or zinc species incorporated in ZSM-5 zeolites enhances the capability of the zeolites for the aromatization."
[3] "The yield of aromatic hydrocarbons is greatly enhanced by introducing Ga or Zn cations into ZSM-5 Or the borosilicate."
[4] "Over ZSM-5, the interconversion of olefins proceeds much faster than the aromatization, giving a variety of aromatic hydrocarbons."
[5] "Over borosilicates, the rate of the olefin interconversion proceeds much more slowly, and the main aromatic products from propene and I-butene are benzene and xylenes, respectively, at least at low conversion levels and at higher reaction temperatures."
[6] "It is concluded that zinc or gallium cations act as a dehydrogenation catalyst to give allylic species from olefins in the conversion of both alkanes and alkenes."
[7] "The effect of the reaction temperature on the product distribution in the conversion of propene over H-ZSM-S and Ga-ZSM-S was examined."
[8] "Over H-ZSM-5, the conversion of propene was over 9S% below 673 K, while it decreased to about 80% over 773 K."
[9] "At 573 K, aromatics with 8 or more carbon atoms were main products."
[10] "Over Ga-ZSM-5, the aromatization seems to proceed with a bifunctional action of the catalysts: Bronsted acid sites are responsible for oligomerization and cracking, while cationic species plausibly serve as a dehydrogenation catalyst."
[11] "The acidity of borosilicates is known to be very weak."
[12] "Over Zn-borosilicate the aromatic hydrocarbons were produced in yields of 2S and 4S% and 773 K and 873 K, respectively."
[13] "This shows that the incorporation of zinc cations to the borosilicates induced the aromatization activity."
[14] "The fact that zinc cations are effective for the dehydrogenation of olefins was further supported by the reaction of I-butene over Zn-borosilicate."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process transforms propane into propylene, which is a crucial feedstock for the production of polymers and other petrochemicals. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, with research focusing on the role of gallium (Ga) species in enhancing the catalyst's performance. Recent studies have highlighted the catalytic properties of Ga species, demonstrating their ability to act as a dehydrogenation catalyst, facilitating the conversion of alkanes and alkenes into more valuable aromatic hydrocarbons.

2. In the context of PDH, Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts show improved activity compared to conventional catalysts. The introduction of Ga cations into the zeolite structure leads to a significant enhancement in the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons. This is attributed to the unique catalytic behavior of Ga species, which promote the dehydrogenation of olefins, leading to the formation of allylic species that can further react to produce aromatic compounds. The research also indicates that the interconversion of olefins occurs much faster over Ga/H-ZSM-5 compared to other catalysts, contributing to a broader spectrum of aromatic products.

3. The rate of olefin interconversion over borosilicate catalysts is notably slower than that over Ga/H-ZSM-5. At lower conversion levels and higher temperatures, the main aromatic products from propene and I-butene are benzene and xylenes, respectively, suggesting a more direct conversion route facilitated by the borosilicate structure. This highlights the distinct catalytic pathways employed by different types of catalysts in PDH processes.

4. Zinc (Zn) cations have been found to play a crucial role in enhancing the aromatization capabilities of borosilicate catalysts. The incorporation of Zn into the borosilicate matrix induces aromatization activity, allowing for the efficient conversion of propane and propene into aromatic hydrocarbons. Unlike Ga/ZSM-5, Zn-borosilicate catalysts exhibit a higher selectivity towards benzene, indicating a comparable rate of aromatization and interconversion among olefins. This finding underscores the versatility of metal cations in catalyzing PDH reactions, depending on the type of support material used.

1. 对丙烯需求的增长推动了新型生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这种过程将丙烷转化为丙烯，是生产聚合物和其他石油化工产品的重要原料。对于PDH而言，镓/沸石-5（Ga/H-ZSM-5）催化剂的理解已经显著发展，研究重点在于镓（Ga）物种如何增强催化剂性能。最近的研究揭示了Ga物种的催化特性，证明它们能够作为脱氢催化剂，促进烷烃和烯烃转化为更有价值的芳香烃化合物。

2. 在PDH背景下，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂表现出显著的活性提升，与传统催化剂相比，引入Ga离子到沸石结构中能显著提高芳香烃的产率。这种活性的增强归因于Ga物种的独特催化行为，它们促进烯烃的脱氢反应，生成可以进一步反应形成芳香化合物的亚甲基物种。研究表明，与其它催化剂相比，Ga/H-ZSM-5能够在更低的温度下进行更快的烯烃互变异构，导致更广泛的芳香产物谱系。

3. 与Ga/H-ZSM-5相比，硼硅酸盐催化剂中的烯烃互变异构速率明显较慢。在较低转化率和较高温度下，丙烯和异丁烯的主要芳香产物分别是苯和二甲苯，这表明硼硅酸盐结构采用了一种更为直接的转换途径。这一发现突出了不同催化剂在PDH过程中所采用的不同催化路径。

4. 锌（Zn）离子被发现在增强硼硅酸盐催化剂的芳香化能力方面发挥关键作用。将Zn引入硼硅酸盐矩阵中会诱导芳香化活性，从而高效地将丙烷和丙烯转化为芳香烃化合物。与Ga/ZSM-5相比，Zn-硼硅酸盐催化剂对苯的选择性更高，表明芳香化和烯烃互变异构的速率相当。这一发现强调了金属离子在PDH反应中催化作用的多样性，这取决于所使用的支持材料类型。
