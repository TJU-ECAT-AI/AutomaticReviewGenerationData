Answer: The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the need for more efficient and selective catalysts. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly over time, with researchers exploring various aspects such as the nature of active Ga species. Recent studies have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, providing insights into their mechanisms and improving their performance.
