[1] "The RSSIE reactions of In2O3 and zeolites under H2 at high temperature have been investigated by H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and/or thermogravimetric analysis in several previous studies [52,54,57]."
[2] "However, in-situ characterization of In2O3 and zeolites has not been reported yet."
[3] "We have reported the preparation of In-CHA through RSSIE of CHA-supported In2O3 obtained by impregnation (In2O3/CHA), revealing the formation of highly dispersed In species by spectroscopic and microscopic analysis [58]."
[4] "In this study, in-situ XRD was conducted for RSSIE of In2O3/CHA under 5% H2/N2 flow."
[5] "The XRD measurements showed that the peaks assignable to In2O3 (222), (400), and (440) disappeared after RSSIE in each case (Figure 2), indicating the high dispersion of In species."
[6] "In-MFI, In-MOR, and In-BEA exhibit inferior activities compared to that of In-CHA, whereas a higher conversion value was achieved using In-CHA with a higher Al content (In-CHA(Al-rich))."
[7] "Kinetic study and in-situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicated that [InH2]+ ions are formed in CHA zeolites regardless of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, and that they serve as catalytically active sites for the dehydrogenation of ethane."

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), leading to advancements in catalyst technology and operational efficiency.
2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly over time. Initially, there was considerable debate about the active Ga species responsible for the catalytic activity. Recent research findings have contributed to a clearer picture of the active species and the underlying mechanisms, including the identification of Ga species that promote PDH efficiently.
