Acids 3a3f (general procedure). A suspension of 0.01 mol of acid 1a1e and 0.01 mol of triphenylphosphazene 2a or 2b in 3040 mL of anhydrous toluene was stirred at 2025C until complete dissolution of the reactants. The resulting solution was cooled to 05C, and the precipitate was filtered off and recrys- tallized from acetonitrile.

To synthesize acids 3a3f, a suspension of 0.01 mol of acid 1a1e and 0.01 mol of triphenylphosphazene 2a or 2b in 30-40 mL of anhydrous toluene was stirred at 20-25°C until the reactants dissolved completely. The solution was then cooled to 0-5°C, and the precipitate was filtered and recrystallized from acetonitrile.
