If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Acids 3a3f (general procedure). A suspension of 0.01 mol of acid 1a1e and 0.01 mol of triphenylphosphazene 2a or 2b in 3040 mL of anhydrous toluene was stirred at 2025C until complete dissolution of the reactants. The resulting solution was cooled to 05C, and the precipitate was filtered off and recrys- tallized from acetonitrile.

To synthesize acids 3a3f, a suspension of 0.01 mol of acid 1a1e and 0.01 mol of triphenylphosphazene 2a or 2b in 30-40 mL of anhydrous toluene was stirred at 20-25°C until the reactants dissolved completely. The solution was then cooled to 0-5°C, and the precipitate was filtered and recrystallized from acetonitrile.
