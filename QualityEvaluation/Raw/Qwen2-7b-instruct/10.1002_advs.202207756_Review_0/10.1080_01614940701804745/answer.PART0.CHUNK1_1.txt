[1] "The Haag-Dessau mechanism for protolytic activation of the alkane via penta-coordinated carbonium-ion-like transition states explains the observed product distribution."
[2] "Experimental studies show different rates for H/D exchange, C-H bond cleavage, and C-C bond cleavage, and also address the crucial role of alkane adsorption in determining the intrinsic reaction rates."
[3] "The current challenge lies in extending this understanding to longer and branched hydrocarbon molecules, both experimentally and theoretically."
[4] "Initial work from McVicker and coworkers, NMR studies from Gorte and coworkers as well as Haw and coworkers, and theoretical studies from Kazansky and coworkers have established the for- mation of neutral alkoxide structures upon olefin adsorption in zeolites."
[5] "Hence, experimental measurements for olefin adsorption are challenging and are typically undertaken at low temperatures and low pressures to minimize secondary reactions."
[6] "The observed perturbations were attributed to the formation of a 1:1 p-complex as shown in Figure 5; resulting in a red-shift of 389 cm−1 for the O-H Brnsted acid site stretching frequency and reduced symmetry of the adsorbed C2H4 as well as reduced density of charge on the carbon-carbon double bond."
[7] "At longer times on stream, oligomeric products with branched chains could also be discerned."
[8] "Although these studies cannot directly examine the nature of the surface species on the catalyst, the observed product distribution was consistent with carbenium ion reactions."
[9] "The observed product distribution for hexene and heptene was found to be independent of the particular olefin fed, indicating that isomerization was rapid compared to cracking."
[10] "For each feed, Buchanan et al. (187) have enumerated all the plausible b-scission reactions and related these steps to the observed product distribution to obtain relative rates for the various modes of b-scission."
[11] "Although several modified ZSM-5 formulations have been developed to enhance the para-selectivity for toluene disproportionation, only recently theoretical studies have elucidated the novel reaction pathways involving physisorbed intermediates for alkylation and dealkylation of aromatic species."
[12] "The above study also extends to determining the sensitivity of the kinetic model to various steps in the reaction scheme."
[13] "This explanation however, is derived in the limit of low coverage, a scenario which may not be applicable in this case."
[14] "The authors noted an increase in catalytic activity when the Si/Al ratio decreased from 21.5 to 35.25 and attribute this to enhanced acidity, however; this explanation contradicts observations from several other experimental studies wherein no acidity change is observed with Si/Al ratio."
[15] "There was good agreement between model predictions and experimental data is for n-heptane cracking, even though this model does not incorporate any features dependent on the primary, secondary or tertiary nature of the surface species or transition states."
[16] "Based on the observed product distribution as a function of contact time, the authors were able to discern an inhibitory effect of aromatics due to competitive adsorption as well as postulate C-C bond cleavage on gallium sites based on the high ethane production for propane aromatization reactions."
[17] "The introduction of gallium was observed to increase the dehydrogenation rate constant by a factor of 7, while the protolytic cracking rate was not observed to be significantly altered."
[18] "The model developed acknowledges the carbon number dependence of alkane adsorption energetics, considers the existence of methoxy surface species, includes alkyl- lation reactions as discussed in Section 3.1.4, as well as postulates the elementary steps for cyclization and subsequent aromatization by hydride abstraction reactions."
