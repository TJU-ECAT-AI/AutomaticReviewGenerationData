[1] "The demand for propylene has significantly increased due to its versatility in manufacturing applications. As a result, new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), have been developed to meet this growing demand."
[2] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been extensively researched for PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The debate surrounds the nature of the active Ga species on the catalyst surface."
[3] "Recent research has shed light on the active Ga species, suggesting that it is not just the Ga itself but rather the interaction between Ga and the zeolite framework that plays a crucial role in the PDH process."
[4] "Studies have also explored the impact of Ga doping on the acidity of the HZSM-5 framework, which is essential for the PDH reaction, and the promotion effect of Ga on the overall catalytic performance."

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with a focus on the active Ga species. Research suggests that the interaction between Ga and the zeolite framework is key, rather than just the Ga itself. Studies have also looked into how Ga doping affects the acidity of the HZSM-5 framework and its promotion effect on the catalytic performance.
