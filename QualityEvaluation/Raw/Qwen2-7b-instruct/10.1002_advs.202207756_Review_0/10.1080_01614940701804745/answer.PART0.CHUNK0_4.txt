The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH is a process that converts propane into propylene, a key component in the production of plastics, rubbers, and other petrochemical products. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, especially concerning the debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by exploring the role of gallium in enhancing the catalytic activity, particularly in the context of the promotion effect of gallium on the zeolite structure. This includes studies on the nature of surface intermediates, adsorption phenomena, confinement effects, and the detailed mechanistic understanding of light alkane aromatization over these catalysts. The catalysts have been shown to promote efficient conversion of propane to propylene, with gallium addition enhancing the catalytic performance through the introduction of new reaction pathways and promoting the formation of active surface sites.
