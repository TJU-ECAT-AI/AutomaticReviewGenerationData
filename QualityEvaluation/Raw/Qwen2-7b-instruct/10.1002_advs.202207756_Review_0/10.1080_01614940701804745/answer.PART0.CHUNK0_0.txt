The expanding need for propylene has spurred the creation of new production techniques, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been thoroughly examined for their application in PDH. There exists a continuous argument regarding the active gallium (Ga) species in these catalysts. Recent studies have significantly advanced our comprehension of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH.
