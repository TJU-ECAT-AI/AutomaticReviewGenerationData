<p>Most gallium modified formulations are prepared by impregnating, refluxing, or by mechanical mixing of Ga2O3 and HZSM-5, with subsequent thermal activation or reduction.</p>
<p>Gallium-containing ZSM-5 formulations are industrially preferred mainly due to the high volatility of zinc.</p>
<p>Wet impregnation of HZSM-5 with gallium salt solutions guarantees gallium deposition on the catalyst, nevertheless, most of the gallium is found to be located on the outside of the zeolite crystals as evidenced by XPS and electron microscopy studies.</p>
<p>A study of zinc and gallium containing ZSM-5 zeolites by Yakerson et al. confirmed that Zn2 cations led to ion exchange and generated Lewis acid sites while Ga3 cations did not show any significant ion exchange or Lewis acidity upon deposition.</p>
<p>Nowak et al. confirmed that exchanging trivalent cations into ZSM-5 was difficult due to the hydrophobicity of the materials as well as the weak anionic field due to the separation of the Al sites required for ion exchange.</p>
<p>Electron microscopy studies of catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation and wet impregnation by Joly et al. revealed that gallium was mainly located on the outer surface of the zeolite crystallites as thin layers.</p>

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as a means to convert propane into propylene. Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, with key insights including the location of gallium species on the outer surface of the zeolite crystallites. Research has shown that gallium does not readily undergo ion exchange or generate Lewis acid sites, unlike zinc. Electron microscopy studies confirm that gallium tends to be deposited on the outer surface of the zeolite crystals as thin layers, contributing to the effectiveness of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH processes.

对丙烯的日益增长的需求推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），以将丙烷转化为丙烯。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经显著提高，关键见解包括镓物种位于沸石晶体表面。研究表明，镓不易进行离子交换或产生Lewis酸性位点，而锌则不同。电子显微镜研究证实，镓倾向于沉积在沸石晶体的表面上作为薄层，这有助于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH过程中的有效性。
