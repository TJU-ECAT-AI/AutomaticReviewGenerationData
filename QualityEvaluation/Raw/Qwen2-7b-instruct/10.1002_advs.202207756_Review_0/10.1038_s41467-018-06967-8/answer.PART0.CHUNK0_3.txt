[1] "Previous studies have shown that the alkane dehydrogenation reaction is insensitive to the structure of the Pt particles, because single atoms of Pt are capable of catalyzing the reaction40. However, undesired side reactions that occur during the alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis,isomerization and coke formation, are structure sensitive reac- tions, requiring more than one Pt atom41."
[2] "Unlike previous reported low temperature SAA applications26,29,3739, our synthesized Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability for at least 120 h on stream at 520 C."
[3] "Single Pt atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity (90%)."
[4] "The binding strength of π adsorbed propylene over Pt/Cu SAA (0.57 eV) is also weaker than the di- σ ones over Pt3Cu(111) (0.88 eV) and Pt(111) (1.10 eV),further facilitating propylene desorption over Pt/Cu SAA."
[5] "Compared with Pt(111), Pt/Cu SAA only slightly increases the corresponding dehydrogenation barriers by 0.4 eV, resulting in similar PDH activity over pure Pt and Pt/Cu SAA."
[6] "Our DFT calculations suggest that Pt/Cu SAA indeed breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH (Fig. 1b)."
[7] "The initial propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 is 3.2 times of that for 0.1Pt/Al2O3, at the same time the selectivity to propylene improves to 90% for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 at 13.1% conversion compared with 70% for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 at 5.8% conversion."
[8] "The thermodynamic conversion calculated as mole g1Pt h1 is presented (dash line)."
[9] "The TPSR of PD scrambling experiment indicates similar CH activation ability between Pt/Ag SAA and Pt/Cu SAA (Supplementary Figure 20a)."
[10] "We prepared the Pt/Ag SAA catalyst according to similar atomic dilution method mentioned above."

1. The structure of platinum particles does not significantly affect the dehydrogenation of alkanes, as single atoms of platinum can effectively catalyze this process. However, side reactions like hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coke formation during dehydrogenation require multiple platinum atoms, making them structure-sensitive reactions.
2. The synthesized Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) shows exceptional stability for at least 120 hours under operation at 520 degrees Celsius, unlike previous low-temperature SAA applications.
3. Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles significantly increase the desorption of surface-bound propylene and prevent further dehydrogenation, leading to high propylene selectivity reaching 90%.
4. The binding strength of π adsorbed propylene over Pt/Cu SAA is weaker than di-σ ones over Pt3Cu(111) and Pt(111), which facilitates propylene desorption over Pt/Cu SAA.
5. Compared to pure platinum, Pt/Cu SAA increases the corresponding dehydrogenation barriers by only 0.4 eV, maintaining similar PDH activity.
6. Our computational models suggest that Pt/Cu SAA breaks the traditional scaling relationship for platinum alloys during propane dehydrogenation, differing from conventional Pt alloys.
7. The propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 is 3.2 times higher than that for 0.1Pt/Al2O3, with a propylene selectivity of 90% at 13.1% conversion versus 70% for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 at 5.8% conversion.
8. The dashed line represents the thermodynamic conversion in moles per gram of platinum per hour.
9. The dehydrogenation activation ability of the Pt/Ag SAA catalyst is similar to that of Pt/Cu SAA based on the PD scrambling experiment results.
10. The Pt/Ag SAA catalyst was prepared using a similar atomic dilution technique as described above.

1. 铂颗粒的结构对烷烃脱氢反应的影响不大，因为单个铂原子能够有效催化这个过程。然而，在脱氢过程中发生的副反应如氢解、异构化和焦炭形成需要多个铂原子，因此它们是结构敏感反应。
2. 合成的铂/铜单原子合金（SAA）在520摄氏度下操作至少120小时显示出了极佳的稳定性，这与之前报道的低温SAA应用不同。
3. 分散在铜纳米粒子上的单个铂原子显著增强了表面束缚丙烯的脱附，并阻止了进一步的脱氢，导致丙烯选择性达到90%。
4. 丙烯π吸附在Pt/Cu SAA上的结合强度弱于Pt3Cu(111)和Pt(111)上的双-σ结合，进一步促进了Pt/Cu SAA上的丙烯脱附。
5. 相对于纯铂，Pt/Cu SAA仅增加了相应的脱氢壁垒0.4 eV，保持了与纯铂相似的PDH活性。
6. 我们的计算模型表明，Pt/Cu SAA打破了传统铂合金在丙烷脱氢中的尺度关系，与常规铂合金不同。
7. 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3催化剂的丙烯形成速率是0.1Pt/Al2O3的3.2倍，丙烯选择性在13.1%转化时达到90%，而0.1Pt/Al2O3在5.8%转化时仅为70%。
