<p>Previous studies have shown that the alkane dehydrogenation reaction is insensitive to the structure of the Pt particles, because single atoms of Pt are capable of catalyzing the reaction40. However, undesired side reactions that occur during the alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization and coke formation, are structure sensitive reactions, requiring more than one Pt atom41. Therefore, isolated Pt atoms are expected to be a potential active center with high propylene selectivity.</p>
<p>Note that noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state41. Xiong et al. reported that single Pt atoms on CeO2 can only promote the cleavage of CC bonds of hydrocarbons with no observed selectivity toward dehydrogenation42. Therefore, SAAs attract our attention, where the catalytically active metal is atomically dispersed in the surface layer of the more inert host metal and exists in the metallic state, distinguishing from single atoms positively charged on metal oxides26,43. Such SAAs have been widely used as a strategy for selective hydrogenation reactions, such as the selective hydrogenation of styrene, acetylene, and 1,3-butadiene26,29. Recently, Pt/Cu SAAs were suggested as an approach to coke-resistant CH activation chemistry and examined in the systems of methyl groups, methane, butane, and propane37. However, no stable SAA under reducing environment at high temperatures (>400 C) has been reported so far. This raises the question whether SAAs are capable of breaking the restriction of the scaling relationship for PtM alloys and catalyzing dehydrogenation reactions at high temperatures stably.</p>
<p>Note that our DFT calculation shows that different from the conventional Pt alloys, the Pt/Cu SAA breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship during PDH, displaying a quite negative difference between the desorption energy and further dehydrogenation barrier of propylene, and at the same time maintaining a reasonable dehydrogenation energy barrier for propane. We further synthesized a kind of SAA catalysts with single Pt atoms dispersed on Cu and Ag nanoparticles through an atom dilution method. In the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with the low loading of Pt (0.1 wt%) displays propylene selectivity of 90% with the high formation rate of 10.6 mol g1Pt h1 under the conditions of atmospheric pressure, 520 C, WHSV = 4 h1, C3H8/N2 = 1/1 and shows excellent stability for at least 120 h on stream.</p>

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Research has evolved to understand Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, including debates about active Ga species. Recent findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts. The literature does not explicitly discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, but it does highlight the role of SAAs in improving propylene selectivity and stability in PDH reactions. The Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst, with a low loading of Pt (0.1 wt%), demonstrates high propylene selectivity and stability under PDH conditions.

丙烯的日益增长的需求已经影响了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的作用和活性Ga物种的讨论，研究已经取得了进展，并为当前的知识贡献了这些催化剂。文献没有明确讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用，但强调了SAAs在提高PDH反应中丙烯选择性和稳定性方面的作用。含铂量为0.1 wt%的Pt/Cu单原子合金（SAA）催化剂在大气压力、520°C、空速为4 h−1、C3H8/N2 = 1/1的条件下显示出高丙烯选择性和长达至少120小时的稳定性。
