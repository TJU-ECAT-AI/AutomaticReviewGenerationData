1. The ultimate goal of researchers in the field of catalysis is the development of new catalysts that offer both enhanced activity and selectivity simultaneously.

2. Studies have revealed that the structure of the platinum particles does not affect the alkane dehydrogenation reaction, as single atoms of platinum are sufficient to catalyze this process.

3. The relationship between the first dehydrogenation barrier and the propylene desorption barrier/deep dehydrogenation barrier is demonstrated.

4. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) breaks the scaling relationship for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), unlike conventional Pt alloys.

5. The initial conversion of propane increases until the content of copper reaches 6.7 wt%, and beyond this point, further increases in copper content do not lead to additional increases in propane conversion.

6. In the process of propane dehydrogenation, the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with a low platinum loading (0.1 wt%) exhibits a high propylene selectivity of 90% along with a rapid propylene formation rate of 10.6 mol g1Pt h1 under atmospheric pressure conditions at 520 C.

1. 研究人员在催化领域的终极目标是开发同时具有增强活性和选择性的新催化剂。

2. 研究表明，铂颗粒的结构不会影响烷烃脱氢反应，因为单个铂原子足以催化此过程。

3. 第一脱氢化壁垒与丙烯脱附壁垒/深层脱氢化壁垒（从双σ丙烯到C3H4的最大壁垒）之间的关系被展示出来。

4. 我们的密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，Pt/Cu单原子合金（SAA）在PDH过程中确实打破了PtM合金的缩放关系，这与常规的Pt合金不同。

5. 烯烃转化率的初始增加直到铜含量达到6.7 wt%，之后，即使进一步增加铜含量，烯烃转化率也不会再增加。

6. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，当铂加载量为0.1 wt%时，Pt/Cu SAA催化剂显示出90%的高丙烯选择性以及在520 C的大气压力条件下，丙烯形成速率高达10.6 mol g1Pt h1。
