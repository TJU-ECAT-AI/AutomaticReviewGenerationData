[1] "Due to the exis- tence of scaling properties of adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces, the enhancement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by side reactions leading to a reduction in selectivity for the target product."
[2] "Our previous DFT calculations indicate that the catalytic properties of these PtM alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehy- drogenation of propane."
[3] "However, isolated Pt atoms dispersed in Cu nanoparticles maintain a reasonable dehydro- genation activation barrier and at the same time display a quite high selectivity, which is reflected by the low binding strength of propylene and high deep dehydrogenation barrier."
[4] "Our synthesized Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability for at least 120 h on stream at 520 C."
[5] "Compared with Pt(111), Pt/Cu SAA only slightly increases the corresponding dehydrogenation barriers by 0.4 eV, resulting in similar PDH activity over pure Pt and Pt/Cu SAA."

The growing demand for propylene has led to a focus on developing new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to meet this demand efficiently. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was a debate about the active Ga species involved in the process. However, recent research has contributed to clarifying the role of Ga species and the mechanism of PDH catalysis. The literature discusses how the scaling relationship between adsorption energies and catalytic activity affects the selectivity of PDH. It explains that by dispersing Pt atoms on Cu nanoparticles, the catalyst can maintain a reasonable dehydrogenation activation barrier while achieving high selectivity for propylene. Furthermore, the stability of the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst has been demonstrated to exceed 120 hours under operational conditions, showcasing its robust performance. The slight increase in dehydrogenation barriers by 0.4 eV for Pt/Cu SAA compared to pure Pt ensures similar PDH activity while enhancing propylene selectivity.

丙烯的日益增长的需求已经推动了新的生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），以满足这一需求。对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解有了显著发展。最初，关于参与过程的活性Ga物种存在争议。然而，最近的研究为澄清Ga物种的作用和PDH催化机制做出了贡献。文献讨论了吸附能与催化活性之间的尺度关系如何影响PDH的选择性。它解释了通过在Cu纳米颗粒上分散Pt原子，催化剂可以保持合理的脱氢化激活壁垒，同时实现丙烯高选择性。此外，文献证明了Pt/Cu SAA催化剂在运行条件下至少持续120小时的稳定性，展示了其出色的性能。与纯Pt相比，Pt/Cu SAA的脱氢化壁垒仅增加0.4 eV，确保了相似的PDH活性，同时提高了丙烯选择性。
