[1] "Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit Hitting the limits on propene synthesis The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock."
[2] "Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation."
[3] "The use of undiluted reactants allowed the reaction to run near the thermodynamically limit of about 67% conversion with a selectivity to propylene of more than 99%."
[4] "This catalyst also does not build up carbon and could run up to 30 hours without deactivation."
[5] "Shale gas production has led to a switch in the industrial feedstocks for propylene, from naphtha to propane."
[6] "Global demand for propylene is >100 million metric tons per year, with 4% annual growth."
[7] "Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) produced 13.6 million metric tons of propylene in 2019, accounting for 11% of global propylene production."
[8] "Commercial PDH processes utilize either chromium (Cr)based (Catofin process) or platinum (Pt)based catalysts [Oleflex and steam-activated reforming (STAR) processes]."
[9] "Under PDH reaction conditions, PtSn intermetallic NPs on Al2O3 separate into Pt and Sn atoms and form segregated SnOx and Pt phases on Al2O3 supports."
[10] "Even with these augmentations, to combat deactivation, commercial Pt-based catalysts are operated at low per-pass propane conversion, and the catalyst is continuously regenerated with a moving-bed adiabatic reactor."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), aiming to utilize the abundant propane from shale gas efficiently. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, with debates about the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by providing insights into the active components and their roles in the dehydrogenation process. This has helped refine the catalyst design and operational strategies, leading to higher efficiency and selectivity in propylene production.
