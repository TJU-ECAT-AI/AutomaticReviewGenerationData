<p>Global demand for propylene is >100 million metric tons per year, with 4% annual growth (2).</p>
<p>Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) produced 13.6 million metric tons of propylene in 2019, accounting for 11% of global propylene production (8).</p>
<p>The main drawbacks with Cr-based catalysts are relatively low selectivity to propylene and high catalyst deactivation rate due to extensive deposition of solid carbon (coke) on the catalyst surface.</p>

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the need for more efficient and selective catalysts. This includes the shift from chromium (Cr)-based catalysts to platinum (Pt)-based catalysts, which offer higher selectivity to propylene but face challenges with rapid deactivation due to carbon deposition.

2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was a debate about the active Ga species, with some suggesting that Ga was responsible for the catalyst's activity. Recent research has contributed to a clearer picture of the role of Ga, showing that it interacts with the zeolite framework and affects the catalyst's structure and activity. This has led to a better understanding of how Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts function in PDH processes.

3. The new Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst, developed in this study, offers thermodynamically limited conversion levels without hydrogen dilution, achieving high propylene selectivity and stability. It avoids the issues of Pt and Sn segregation and formation of SnOx phases, which are common problems with traditional alumina-supported catalysts.

4. The catalyst synthesis involves creating a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex that maintains the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms during reduction and the PDH reaction. This ensures the formation of small intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles on the silica support, which interact benignly with the support material and prevent segregation.

5. The performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is demonstrated through its ability to reach near-thermodynamic conversion levels with over 99% selectivity to propylene, even under challenging conditions such as undiluted propane streams. This highlights its superior stability and productivity compared to existing catalysts.

6. The regeneration studies on the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst show that it can be partially regenerated after forced carbon-induced deactivation, maintaining high activity and selectivity over multiple cycles. This feature is crucial for the practical implementation of the catalyst in industrial settings, as it allows for continuous operation without significant loss in performance.

7. The characterization techniques used for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst, including UV-Vis spectroscopy, TEM imaging, XRD, XPS, DRIFTS, and EXAFS/XANES analyses, provide insights into the structure-property relationships of the catalyst. These studies confirm the presence of mixed Pt-Sn alloys on the surface and within the nanoparticles, which contribute to the catalyst's unique properties and performance.
