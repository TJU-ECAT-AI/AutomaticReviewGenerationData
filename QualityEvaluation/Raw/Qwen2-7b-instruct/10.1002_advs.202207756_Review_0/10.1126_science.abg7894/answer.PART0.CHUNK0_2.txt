<p>Global demand for propylene is >100 million metric tons per year, with 4% annual growth (2). Oxidative propane dehydrogenation (OPDH) is an emerging technology in which thermodynamically driven overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides (COx) is a major drawback (3, 4).</p>
<p>Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) produced 13.6 million metric tons of propylene in 2019, accounting for 11% of global propylene production (8).</p>
<p>Shale gas production has led to a switch in the industrial feedstocks for propylene, from naphtha to propane (1).</p>
<p>For stable performance, traditional alumina-supported platinum-based catalysts require excess tin and feed dilution with hydrogen; however, this reduces per-pass propylene conversion and thus lowers catalyst productivity.</p>
<p>We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (<2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%).</p>
<p>The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction.</p>
<p>Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2).</p>
<p>The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of >66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and >99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles).</p>
<p>Propane streams are diluted in commercial operations to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure (fig. S2).</p>
<p>In an undiluted propane stream, the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst reached the thermodynamic conversion limit of 40% (Fig. 1D and fig. S2).</p>
<p>Data in Fig. 2A and table S1 show the comparison of the initial (fresh catalyst) selectivity-conversion results reported for different catalysts.</p>
<p>For example, PtSn/Al2O3 nanosheets (45) reach near-equilibrium conversion (point labeled as 42 in Fig. 2A); however, the propane is diluted with hydrogen (C3H8:H2 = 0.8) and an inert gas, leading to low propane partial pressure.</p>
<p>The overall catalyst performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts was also studied at different WHSVs (i.e., including those away from the equilibrium conversion).</p>
<p>Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic.</p>
<p>We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C (see supplementary materials for details of the regeneration procedure).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Sn 3d5/2 XPS spectra in Fig. 4C show that most Sn atoms were metallic Sn, and a small fraction of Sn existed as SnO or SnO2, further confirming the formation of PtSn intermetallic NPs (63, 64).</p>

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as companies seek to efficiently convert propane into propylene without relying on traditional feedstocks. PDH has emerged as an alternative method to oxidative propane dehydrogenation (OPDH), which faces challenges due to the thermodynamically driven overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides. Nonoxidative PDH has become increasingly important, producing 13.6 million metric tons of propylene in 2019, accounting for 11% of global propylene production. The shift towards shale gas production has also led to a change in the industrial feedstocks for propylene from naphtha to propane. Traditional alumina-supported platinum-based catalysts, which require excess tin and feed dilution with hydrogen, struggle to maintain high per-pass propylene conversion and productivity. New catalysts, such as silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles, have been developed to operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, offering excellent stability and selectivity to propylene. These nanoparticles, synthesized to ensure the mixing of Pt and Sn, form intermetallic phases that improve propylene selectivity and reduce the rate of hydrogenolysis and coke formation. The catalysts perform well under PDH conditions, achieving high propane conversion and propylene selectivity without the need for hydrogen dilution, which can compromise catalyst productivity. This innovation in catalyst design addresses the limitations of existing technologies and contributes to the efficient production of propylene, aligning with the increasing global demand and the shift in feedstock usage.

丙烯需求的增长已经影响了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），公司寻求高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需依赖传统的原料。PDH已成为替代氧化丙烷脱氢（OPDH）的一种方法，OPDH面临着由于丙烷过氧化为碳氧化物而导致的挑战。非氧化PDH变得越来越重要，在2019年生产了1360万吨丙烯，占全球丙烯产量的11%。随着页岩气生产的增加，工业上用于丙烯的原料从石脑油转向了丙烷。传统上，以氧化铝为支持的铂基催化剂需要过量的锡和丙烷流中的氢气稀释，这会降低每通过一次的丙烯转化率并从而降低催化剂的生产力。开发了新型催化剂，如二氧化硅支持的铂锡（Pt1Sn1）纳米颗粒，可以在热力学限制的转化水平下运行，具有出色的稳定性和丙烯选择性。这些纳米颗粒在合成时确保铂和锡的混合，形成互金属相，提高丙烯选择性并减少氢化和焦炭形成的速率。这些催化剂在PDH条件下表现出色，实现了高丙烷转化率和高丙烯选择性，无需氢气稀释，这可以损害催化剂生产力。这种创新的催化剂设计解决了现有技术的局限性，并有助于高效生产丙烯，符合不断增长的全球需求和原料使用的转变。
