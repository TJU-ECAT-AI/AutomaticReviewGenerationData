[1] "Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit"
[2] "Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation."
[3] "This catalyst also does not build up carbon and could run up to 30 hours without deactivation."
[4] "Silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (<2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%)."
[5] "Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation."
[6] "The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports."
[7] "For stable performance, traditional alumina-supported platinum-based catalysts require excess tin and feed dilution with hydrogen; however, this reduces per-pass propylene conversion and thus lowers catalyst productivity."
[8] "This catalyst has three main features: (i) The PtSn NPs form an atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursor. (ii) Upon reduction, very small (less than 2 nm diameter) intermetallic PtSn NPs form. (iii) A benign interaction of these NPs with the SiO2 support avoids segregation of Pt and Sn and formation of a SnOx phase."
[9] "The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1."
[10] "The data above show that the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts exhibited very high productivity and stability compared with other catalysts."
[11] "The process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex."
[12] "The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of H2PtCl6 is characterized by a prominent absorption peak at 260 nm; SnCl2 exhibits no absorption in the visible range."
[13] "The XRD spectra in Fig. 3D show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn."
[14] "The CO-DRIFTS spectra for Pt/SiO2 and Pt1Sn1/SiO2 (Fig. 4A) revealed linear (on top) and bridge-bonded CO on Pt/SiO2 with infrared adsorption peaks at 2073 and 1821 cm1, respectively."
[15] "The Pt LIII-edge XANES spectra in Fig. 4E are consistent with the analysis of the EXAFS data, indicating that the mixing of Pt and Sn took place in the reduced Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by leading to the creation of catalysts that operate at thermodynamic limits. These catalysts, such as silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles, offer high stability and selectivity to propylene. They avoid issues like carbon buildup and alloy segregation, unlike traditional alumina-supported catalysts. The use of excess tin and hydrogen dilution in conventional catalysts reduces propylene conversion and lowers productivity. New catalysts, like the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst, maintain excellent stability and selectivity without hydrogen dilution, achieving high per-pass propane conversion and propylene yield. The interaction of these nanoparticles with the silica support prevents segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase, contributing to their stability and performance. The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is shown to operate efficiently at thermodynamic limits, achieving near-thermodynamic conversion levels with high propylene selectivity and prolonged stability, making it a significant advancement in PDH technology.
