[1] "Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit"
[2] "Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation."
[3] "This catalyst also does not build up carbon and could run up to 30 hours without deactivation."
[4] "Silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (<2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%)."
[5] "Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation."
[6] "The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports."
[7] "For stable performance, traditional alumina-supported platinum-based catalysts require excess tin and feed dilution with hydrogen; however, this reduces per-pass propylene conversion and thus lowers catalyst productivity."
[8] "This catalyst has three main features: (i) The PtSn NPs form an atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursor. (ii) Upon reduction, very small (less than 2 nm diameter) intermetallic PtSn NPs form. (iii) A benign interaction of these NPs with the SiO2 support avoids segregation of Pt and Sn and formation of a SnOx phase."
[9] "The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by leading to the creation of catalysts that operate at thermodynamic limits. These catalysts, such as silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles, offer high stability and selectivity to propylene. They avoid issues like carbon buildup and alloy segregation, unlike traditional alumina-supported catalysts. The use of excess tin and hydrogen dilution in conventional catalysts reduces propylene conversion and lowers productivity. New catalysts, like the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst, maintain excellent stability and selectivity without hydrogen dilution, achieving high per-pass propane conversion and propylene yield. The interaction of these nanoparticles with the silica support prevents segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase, contributing to their stability and performance. The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is shown to operate efficiently at thermodynamic limits, achieving near-thermodynamic conversion levels with high propylene selectivity and prolonged stability, making it a significant advancement in PDH technology.

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the need for more efficient and selective catalysts. This includes the shift from chromium (Cr)-based catalysts to platinum (Pt)-based catalysts, which offer higher selectivity to propylene but face challenges with rapid deactivation due to carbon deposition.

2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was a debate about the active Ga species, with some suggesting that Ga was responsible for the catalyst's activity. Recent research has contributed to a clearer picture of the role of Ga, showing that it interacts with the zeolite framework and affects the catalyst's structure and activity. This has led to a better understanding of how Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts function in PDH processes.

3. The new Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst, developed in this study, offers thermodynamically limited conversion levels without hydrogen dilution, achieving high propylene selectivity and stability. It avoids the issues of Pt and Sn segregation and formation of SnOx phases, which are common problems with traditional alumina-supported catalysts.

4. The catalyst synthesis involves creating a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex that maintains the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms during reduction and the PDH reaction. This ensures the formation of small intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles on the silica support, which interact benignly with the support material and prevent segregation.

5. The performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is demonstrated through its ability to reach near-thermodynamic conversion levels with over 99% selectivity to propylene, even under challenging conditions such as undiluted propane streams. This highlights its superior stability and productivity compared to existing catalysts.

6. The regeneration studies on the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst show that it can be partially regenerated after forced carbon-induced deactivation, maintaining high activity and selectivity over multiple cycles. This feature is crucial for the practical implementation of the catalyst in industrial settings, as it allows for continuous operation without significant loss in performance.

7. The characterization techniques used for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst, including UV-Vis spectroscopy, TEM imaging, XRD, XPS, DRIFTS, and EXAFS/XANES analyses, provide insights into the structure-property relationships of the catalyst. These studies confirm the presence of mixed Pt-Sn alloys on the surface and within the nanoparticles, which contribute to the catalyst's unique properties and performance.

1. 对丙烯需求的增长已经推动了新的生产方法，尤其是丙烷裂解（PDH），以提高效率和选择性催化剂。这包括从基于铬（Cr）的催化剂转向铂（Pt）基催化剂，后者提供了更高的丙烯选择性，但面临碳沉积导致催化剂快速失活的问题。

2. Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的作用理解已经显著发展。最初，关于活性Ga物种的辩论存在，有人认为Ga负责催化活性。最近的研究为Ga的作用提供了一幅更清晰的图景，表明它与沸石框架相互作用，并影响催化剂结构和活性。这导致了对Ga/ZSM-5催化剂在PDH过程中的功能有了更好的理解。

3. 在这项研究中开发的Pt1Sn1/SiO2催化剂在没有氢稀释的情况下实现了热力学限制的转化水平，同时保持高丙烯选择性和稳定性。它避免了传统氧化铝支持催化剂中Pt和Sn分离以及形成SnOx相的问题。

4. 催化剂合成涉及创建一个Pt-Sn异质金属配合物，该配合物在还原和PDH反应过程中保留了Pt和Sn原子的混合状态。这确保了在二氧化硅支撑材料上形成小的互金属PtSn纳米颗粒，这些颗粒与支持材料良性交互并防止分离。

5. Pt1Sn1/SiO2催化剂的性能通过其在接近热力学转化水平下达到超过99％的丙烯选择性的能力得到证明，即使在如纯丙烷流等具有挑战性的条件下也是如此。这突显了其优越的稳定性和生产力与现有催化剂相比。

6. Pt1Sn1/SiO2催化剂的再生研究表明，在被迫由碳引起的失活后，它可以部分再生，保持高活性和选择性多个周期。这一特性对于在工业设置中实施催化剂至关重要，因为它允许连续操作而不会显著降低性能。

7. 用于Pt1Sn1/SiO2催化剂的表征技术，包括紫外可见光谱、透射电子显微镜成像、XRD、XPS、DRIFTS和EXAFS/XANES分析，提供了催化剂结构-性质关系的见解。这些研究确认了表面和纳米颗粒内部混合的Pt-Sn合金的存在，这有助于催化剂的独特特性和性能。

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as companies seek to efficiently convert propane into propylene without relying on traditional feedstocks. PDH has emerged as an alternative method to oxidative propane dehydrogenation (OPDH), which faces challenges due to the thermodynamically driven overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides. Nonoxidative PDH has become increasingly important, producing 13.6 million metric tons of propylene in 2019, accounting for 11% of global propylene production. The shift towards shale gas production has also led to a change in the industrial feedstocks for propylene from naphtha to propane. Traditional alumina-supported platinum-based catalysts, which require excess tin and feed dilution with hydrogen, struggle to maintain high per-pass propylene conversion and productivity. New catalysts, such as silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles, have been developed to operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, offering excellent stability and selectivity to propylene. These nanoparticles, synthesized to ensure the mixing of Pt and Sn, form intermetallic phases that improve propylene selectivity and reduce the rate of hydrogenolysis and coke formation. The catalysts perform well under PDH conditions, achieving high propane conversion and propylene selectivity without the need for hydrogen dilution, which can compromise catalyst productivity. This innovation in catalyst design addresses the limitations of existing technologies and contributes to the efficient production of propylene, aligning with the increasing global demand and the shift in feedstock usage.
