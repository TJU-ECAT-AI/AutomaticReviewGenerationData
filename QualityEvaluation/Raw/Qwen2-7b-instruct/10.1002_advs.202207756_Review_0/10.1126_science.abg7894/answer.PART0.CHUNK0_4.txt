[1] "Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit"
[2] "This catalyst also does not build up carbon and could run up to 30 hours without deactivation."
[3] "Silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (<2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%)."
[4] "Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation."
[5] "This catalyst has three main features: (i) The PtSn NPs form an atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursor. (ii) Upon reduction, very small (less than 2 nm diameter) intermetallic PtSn NPs form. (iii) A benign interaction of these NPs with the SiO2 support avoids segregation of Pt and Sn and formation of a SnOx phase."
[6] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%)."
[7] "Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5%."
[8] "The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of >66% and >99% selectivity to propylene."
[9] "Even under these harsh, high-conversion and undiluted propane stream conditions, the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst was stable and operated at the thermodynamic conversion limit and >99% selectivity for at least 30 hours on stream."
[10] "We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This study introduces a stable and selective catalyst for PDH that can operate at thermodynamic limits without hydrogen dilution, achieving high selectivity and stability. The catalyst is composed of silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles that maintain atomic mixing during catalytic operation. This feature allows for excellent stability and selectivity to propylene. The catalyst can run up to 30 hours without deactivation, even under high conversion and undiluted propane conditions. It demonstrates high productivity and stability compared to other catalysts, making it a promising solution for PDH processes.
