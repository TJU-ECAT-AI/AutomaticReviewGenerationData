<p>There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15. According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species. To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15.</p>
<p>Recently,we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane1820.</p>
<p>Coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus) and neighbouring lattice oxygen were suggested to participate in the dehydrogenation reaction. Yet, the promoter used to purposefully create Zrcus sites either increased or decreased the activity hence proving the limitations of this classical approach for tailored catalyst design.</p>
<p>Here, we describe how nanostructuring of ZrO2 crystallites enables the identification of the nature of active sites for efficient CH bond activation and the control of their concentration without the usage of any dopant or supported species.</p>
<p>Acidbase, redox and electrical conductivity properties of ZrO2 can also be controlled through crystallite size. A structural model of the active site is established owing to our multi-disciplinary approach combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a number of complementary experimental methods including catalytic tests. The active site consists of two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy, which homolytically break the CH bond in alkanes. The kind of this site differs from that previously suggested by some of us for doped ZrO2-based catalysts18,19 and by other researchers for different metal oxides used for PDH2123, where metal cation and neighbouring lattice oxygen were assumed to form the active site. Bare ZrO2 designed especially to maximize the concentration of the active sites shows industrially relevant performance in comparison with commercial-like catalysts containing CrOx or Pt species and other alternative state-of-the-art catalysts.</p>
<p>No effect of the area would be visible if this catalyst property determined the activity exclusively. Moreover, although amor-phous ZrO2 samples (ZrO2_24 and ZrO2_26 in Supplementary Table 1) possess the highest surface area, they showed the lowest activity. The PDH activity of ZrO2 is governed by the number of the active sites, which depends on the size of crystallites. A further experimental support for the importance of the latter catalyst property for PDH is the fact that apparent activation energy of propene formation depends on the size. The energy increases from about 140 to 300 kJ mol1 with an increase in the size from 9 to 43 nm (Supplementary Fig. 3).</p>

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with ongoing debates about active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts. The document discusses the limitations of traditional catalysts, such as those containing CrOx or Pt species, due to health risks, high cost, and deactivation issues. It highlights the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which require promotion with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to exhibit high activity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The document explains how the nature of active sites for efficient CH bond activation and the control of their concentration can be identified through nanostructuring of ZrO2 crystallites, without the use of dopants or supported species. The active sites consist of two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy, which homolytically break the CH bond in alkanes. The document also mentions that the activity of ZrO2 catalysts is governed by the number of active sites, which depends on the size of crystallites. The apparent activation energy of propene formation increases with the size of crystallites, providing further experimental support for the importance of crystallite size in PDH activity.
