<p>The ability of scientists to elaborate and apply fundamental principles for rational design of heterogeneous catalysts is decisive for the global sustainable development and the environment protection applications.</p>
<p>One possible way in this direction is to identify the active sites or key atomic structures1,2 and, for the most part, to use this knowledge for catalyst design and preparation.</p>
<p>For example, owing to the well-defined structure (size and/or shape) and composition of nanoparticles of metals or metal oxides, they are successfully used for the development of supported catalysts with controlled properties38.</p>
<p>Modifying structure of bulk metal oxides at a nanoscale level also has striking effects on their physico-chemical and catalytic proper- ties913.</p>
<p>There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15.</p>
<p>Recently,we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane1820.</p>
<p>Coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus) and neighbouring lattice oxygen were suggested to participate in the dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>Yet, the promoter used to purposefully create Zrcus sites either increased or decreased the activity hence proving the limitations of this classical approach for tailored catalyst design.</p>
<p>Here, we describe how nanostructuring of ZrO2 crystallites enables the identification of the nature of active sites for effi- cient CH bond activation and the control of their concentra- tion without the usage of any dopant or supported species.</p>
<p>Acidbase, redox and electrical conductivity properties of ZrO2 can also be controlled through crystallite size.</p>
<p>A structural model of the active site is established owing to our multi- disciplinary approach combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a number of complementary experi- mental methods including catalytic tests.</p>
<p>The active site con- sists of two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy, which homolytically break the CH bond in alkanes.</p>
<p>The kind of this site differs from that previously suggested by some of us for doped ZrO2-based catalysts18,19 and by other researchers for different metal oxides used for PDH2123, where metal cation and neighbouring lattice oxygen were assumed to form the active site.</p>
<p>Bare ZrO2 designed especially to maximize the concentration of the active sites shows industrially relevant performance in comparison with commercial-like catalysts containing CrOx or Pt species and other alternative state-of- the-art catalysts.</p>

A further experimental support for the importance of the latter catalyst property for PDH is the fact that apparent activation energy of propene formation depends on the size.</p>
<p>The activity-size relationship in Fig. 1a can be explained by an increase in the concentration of the catalytically active Zrcus sites with a decrease in crystallite size. To validate the importance of such sites for propene formation, catalytic tests were performed with ZrO2 treated with either H2 or CO at 550 C before testing in PDH at the same temperature. The idea was to create additional Zrcus sites through removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2 in form of H2O or CO2. The rate of propene formation increased by a factor of 2 after 6 h on H2 stream in comparison with the non-treated sample (Fig. 1c).</p>
<p>When CO was used as a reducing agent, a seven-time increase in the rate of propene formation was achieved after only 30 min treatment. Such distinctive effects of the reducing agents on the increase in the rate are related to their ability to remove lattice oxygen from ZrO2 as proven by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) tests with H2 or CO (Supplementary Fig. 5).</p>
<p>Our DFT calculations also predict that oxygen vacancies are easier formed through removal of lattice oxygen by CO than by H2 (Supplementary Table 3). The relevance of the so-generated surface defects for propene formation is further supported by the higher ratio of the yield of propene (Y(C3H6)) to that of cracking products (Y(C1C2)) in a broad range of propane conversion obtained over the CO-treated catalyst in comparison to its H2-treated counterpart (Fig. 1d).</p>
<p>The use of ZrO2 composed of small crystallites is also beneficial for propene selectivity, which increased with a decrease in the crystallite size (Fig. 1b). Such positive effect holds over a broad range of propane conversion (Supplementary Fig. 6).</p>

1. The demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Commercial catalysts often contain CrOx or Pt species, which have drawbacks such as health risks associated with Cr(VI) exposure, high cost, and deactivation due to sintering of Pt species. These catalysts require treatment with harmful compounds like Cl2 or Cl-containing solutions to redistribute the Pt.

2. Researchers have developed eco-friendly and cost-effective catalysts based on ZrO2 that require promotion with metal oxides, specifically Ru or Rh nanoparticles, to demonstrate high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane, or iso-butane.

3. The concentration of active sites, rather than surface area, determines the activity of ZrO2 catalysts. The active sites consist of two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy, which homolytically break the CH bond in alkanes. This type of site differs from those proposed for doped ZrO2-based catalysts and other metal oxides used for PDH.

4. The PDH activity of ZrO2 is governed by the number of active sites, which depends on the size of crystallites. This is supported by experimental evidence showing that the apparent activation energy of propene formation varies with the size of the crystallites.

5. The activity of ZrO2 catalysts can be enhanced by creating additional active sites through removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2 using reducing agents like H2 or CO. This leads to an increase in the rate of propene formation.

6. DFT calculations predict that oxygen vacancies are easier formed through removal of lattice oxygen by CO compared to H2. The surface defects generated by CO play a crucial role in propene formation, leading to a higher yield of propene compared to H2 treatment.

7. The use of ZrO2 catalysts with small crystallite sizes improves propene selectivity. This positive effect is observed across a wide range of propane conversions.

2. 研究人员已经开发出基于ZrO2的环保且成本效益高的催化剂，需要通过添加金属氧化物，特别是Ru或Rh纳米颗粒来促进，在非氧化性丙烷脱氢过程中表现出高活性。

3. ZrO2催化剂的活性受其晶粒大小影响，而不是表面积。活性位点由位于氧空位上的两个Zr离子组成，它们能够同裂烷烃中的CH键。这种类型的位点与掺杂的ZrO2基催化剂和其他用于PDH的金属氧化物中提出的位点不同。

4. ZrO2的PDH活性由活性位点的数量决定，而活性位点的数量取决于晶粒大小。实验证据表明，丙烷转化过程中的活性能显着影响丙烯形成。

5. 通过使用还原剂如H2或CO从ZrO2中去除晶格氧可以增强ZrO2催化剂的活性，这会导致丙烯生成速率增加。 

6. DFT计算预测，相对于H2，CO更容易形成氧空位。表面缺陷产生的CO对于丙烯形成具有关键作用，导致与H2处理相比，丙烯的产率更高。

7. 使用晶粒大小较小的ZrO2催化剂提高了丙烯选择性。这种正向效应在丙烷转化范围较宽时仍然有效。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as it is a more environmentally friendly process compared to oil-based cracking technologies. This is because propane and iso-butane dehydrogenation rely on natural or shale gas, which contains significantly fewer impurities than oil-based feedstocks. This has led to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, though these often require metal oxides or contain supported Ru or Rh nanoparticles to achieve high activity in PDH.

2. Commercial catalysts containing CrOx or Pt species have faced several flaws. Chromium(VI) exposure can cause health issues, and Pt-based catalysts suffer from high cost and deactivation due to sintering of Pt species. Redispersing platinum typically involves treating the catalysts with ecologically harmful compounds like Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds.

3. The active sites for efficient CH bond activation in ZrO2 are located at oxygen vacancies and consist of two Zr cations. This differs from the active sites reported for other metal oxides used in PDH, which involve metal cations and neighboring lattice oxygen. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2.

4. The use of ZrO2 with small crystallite sizes enhances propene selectivity and performance in PDH, surpassing commercial catalysts with CrOx or Pt species. The size of the crystallites impacts the concentration of active sites and the apparent activation energy of propene formation.

5. To increase the concentration of active Zr sites, lattice oxygen can be removed from ZrO2 using reducing agents like H2 or CO. This leads to higher propene formation rates, especially with CO, as it removes more lattice oxygen than H2.

6. Coke formation in PDH is influenced by the size of ZrO2 crystallites. There is a delay before coke formation begins, and the duration of this induction period increases with decreasing crystallite size. 

7. The activity order for olefin formation from alkanes, including CH4, C2H6, C3H8, and iso-C4H10, correlates with the strength of the CH bond. However, the size of ZrO2 crystallites does not change this order but increases the dehydrogenation rate of C2H6, C3H8, and iso-C4H10.

8. The size of ZrO2 crystallites affects the formation of anion vacancies, which are crucial for oxygen-ionic conductivity in ZrO2-based materials. The conductivity increases with decreasing crystallite size, indicating a higher concentration of anion vacancies.

9. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that oxygen vacancies facilitate the formation of active sites on ZrO2 surfaces, leading to enhanced catalytic activity in PDH.

10. Propene and cracking products are formed on distinct sites on the ZrO2 catalyst surface, which can be inferred from the UV-vis analysis during PDH.

11. The size of ZrO2 crystallites impacts the rate of carbon deposition during PDH. Larger crystallites lead to higher carbon deposition rates due to more propene molecules adsorbing horizontally to the catalyst surface.

12. DFT calculations reveal that the Zr6cIO2c site on the s-ZrO2( 111) surface is the most favorable for propane activation through a heterolytic route. In contrast, a homolytic process occurs on the d-ZrO2( 111) surface, involving two adjacent Zr cations.

13. After propane activation, the Zr6cI iso-C3H7 fragment binds to the Zr5cI site, while the H atom is located in a bridged position between Zr5cI and Zr6cII or Zr5cI and Zr6cIII.

14. The presence of oxygen vacancies facilitates the formation of active sites on the d-ZrO2( 111) surface, leading to enhanced activity in the activation of both propane and methane.

15. The H2 formation process on the s-ZrO2( 111) surface is exothermic, while on the d-ZrO2( 111) surface, it is endothermic. This difference in activation barriers is attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies.

16. The size of ZrO2 crystallites impacts the formation of anion vacancies, which are responsible for oxygen-ionic conductivity in ZrO2-based materials. This impact is crucial for controlling the catalytic activity and selectivity in PDH.

17. DFT calculations provide molecular insights into the role of Zr sites on the ZrO2 surface in the dehydrogenation of propane and methane, highlighting the importance of oxygen vacancies in facilitating these reactions.

18. The size of ZrO2 crystallites influences the formation of the iso-C3H7 fragment and subsequent propene formation, with smaller crystallites leading to more efficient propene formation.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，新的生产方法，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），受到了影响。与基于石油裂解技术相比，丙烷和异丁烷脱氢是更环保的过程，因为它们依赖于杂质含量显著低于石油基原料的天然或页岩气。这导致了基于ZrO2的环境友好型和低成本催化剂的发展，尽管这些催化剂往往需要金属氧化物或包含Ru或Rh纳米粒子以在PDH中实现高活性。

2. 商业上使用的含CrOx或Pt物种的催化剂存在一些缺陷。美国职业安全与健康管理局报告指出，Cr(VI)的接触可能引起各种健康问题。Pt基催化剂的主要缺点是成本高，并且由于Pt物种的烧结而失活。为了重新分散铂，通常使用诸如Cl2或含Cl化合物之类的生态有害物质进行处理。

3. ZrO2中的活性位点由氧空位上的两个Zr离子组成，负责烷烃的离域CH键断裂。这与用于PDH的其他金属氧化物中的活性位点不同，后者涉及金属离子和相邻晶格氧。可以通过调整ZrO2结晶体的大小来控制这些活性位点的数量。

4. 使用具有小结晶体尺寸的ZrO2可以提高丙烯选择性和PDH性能，超越包含CrOx或Pt物种的商业催化剂和其他先进的替代催化剂。结晶体尺寸影响活性位点的浓度和丙烯形成的有效活化能。

5. 通过使用还原剂如H2或CO来增加ZrO2中的活性Zr位点数量，可以增加丙烯形成速率，特别是在使用CO时，因为它比H2去除更多的晶格氧。

6. ZrO2结晶体尺寸对焦炭形成的影响存在延迟现象，在焦炭形成开始之前存在诱导期，随着结晶体尺寸的减小，这种诱导期的持续时间增加。

7. 芳烃的形成顺序与烷烃中CH键的强度相关，但ZrO2结晶体尺寸的变化不会改变这个顺序，而是增加了C2H6、C3H8和iso-C4H10的脱氢速率。

8. ZrO2结晶体尺寸影响形成阴离子空位的数量，这是ZrO2基材料的氧离子电导性的直接指示。随着结晶体尺寸的减小，电导率增加，表明阴离子空位的浓度更高。

9. 实验和理论研究表明，氧空位促进了ZrO2表面的活性位点形成，从而提高了PDH的催化活性。

10. 从PDH期间的UV-vis分析可以推断出丙烯和裂解产物是在ZrO2催化剂表面上的不同位置形成的。

11. ZrO2结晶体尺寸影响碳沉积速率，较大的结晶体导致更高的碳沉积速率，因为更多的丙烯分子水平吸附到催化剂表面。

12. DFT计算揭示了在s-ZrO2( 111)表面上，Zr6cIO2c位点是最有利于丙烷激活的异裂途径。相比之下，d-ZrO2( 111)表面上的活性过程为同裂，涉及相邻的两个Zr离子。

13. 激活后，Zr6cI iso-C3H7片段与Zr5cI位点结合，而H原子位于Zr5cI和Zr6cII或Zr5cI和Zr6cIII之间的桥接位置。

14. d-ZrO2( 111)表面上的氧空位的存在对于甲烷的激活至关重要，因为它允许更低的活化势垒和放热反应。

15. 在s-ZrO2( 111)表面上，H2形成过程是放热的，而在d-ZrO2( 111)表面上，它是吸热的。这种差异归因于d-ZrO2( 111)表面上的氧空位。

16. ZrO2结晶体尺寸影响形成阴离子空位，这对ZrO2基材料的氧离子电导性至关重要，这对于控制PDH的催化活性和选择性具有重要影响。

17. DFT计算提供了关于ZrO2表面在丙烷和甲烷脱氢过程中作用的分子级见解，强调了氧空位在促进这些反应方面的重要性。

18. ZrO2结晶体尺寸影响丙烷激活后iso-C3H7片段的形成以及随后的丙烯形成效率，较小的结晶体尺寸导致更高效的丙烯形成。

19. d-ZrO2( 111)表面上的氧空位的存在对于甲烷的激活至关重要，因为它允许更低的活化势垒和放热反应。

20. 在s-ZrO2( 111)表面上，H2形成是放热的，而在d-ZrO2( 111)表面上，它则是吸热的。这种差异归因于d-ZrO2( 111)表面上的氧空位。
