<p>The ability of scientists to elaborate and apply fundamental principles for rational design of heterogeneous catalysts is decisive for the global sustainable development and the environment protection applications.</p>
<p>One possible way in this direction is to identify the active sites or key atomic structures1,2 and, for the most part, to use this knowledge for catalyst design and preparation.</p>
<p>For example, owing to the well-defined structure (size and/or shape) and composition of nanoparticles of metals or metal oxides, they are successfully used for the development of supported catalysts with controlled properties38.</p>
<p>Modifying structure of bulk metal oxides at a nanoscale level also has striking effects on their physico-chemical and catalytic proper- ties913.</p>
<p>There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15.</p>
<p>Recently,we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane1820.</p>
<p>Coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus) and neighbouring lattice oxygen were suggested to participate in the dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>Yet, the promoter used to purposefully create Zrcus sites either increased or decreased the activity hence proving the limitations of this classical approach for tailored catalyst design.</p>
<p>Here, we describe how nanostructuring of ZrO2 crystallites enables the identification of the nature of active sites for effi- cient CH bond activation and the control of their concentra- tion without the usage of any dopant or supported species.</p>
<p>Acidbase, redox and electrical conductivity properties of ZrO2 can also be controlled through crystallite size.</p>
<p>A structural model of the active site is established owing to our multi- disciplinary approach combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a number of complementary experi- mental methods including catalytic tests.</p>
<p>The active site con- sists of two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy, which homolytically break the CH bond in alkanes.</p>
<p>The kind of this site differs from that previously suggested by some of us for doped ZrO2-based catalysts18,19 and by other researchers for different metal oxides used for PDH2123, where metal cation and neighbouring lattice oxygen were assumed to form the active site.</p>
<p>Bare ZrO2 designed especially to maximize the concentration of the active sites shows industrially relevant performance in comparison with commercial-like catalysts containing CrOx or Pt species and other alternative state-of- the-art catalysts.</p>

The document discusses the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), driven by the growing demand for propylene. It highlights the evolution of understanding regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, emphasizing the ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to a clearer picture of these catalysts' active sites and mechanisms.

The document mentions that Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been used for PDH, but the debate continues about the exact active Ga species involved. The document also states that researchers have recently focused on identifying active sites and controlling their concentration in ZrO2 catalysts, aiming to improve PDH efficiency without relying on dopants or supported species. The active sites identified involve coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus) and neighboring lattice oxygen, leading to homolytic CH bond activation in alkanes.

In summary, the growing demand for propylene has led to advancements in PDH production methods, particularly focusing on catalysts like Ga/H-ZSM-5 and ZrO2. Research continues to refine the understanding of active sites and mechanisms in these catalysts to enhance their performance and efficiency.

文档讨论了由丙烯需求增长推动的新生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。它强调了对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解演变，特别是关于活性Ga物种的持续争论。最近的研究发现为这些催化剂的活性位点和机制提供了更清晰的图像。

文档提到，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂已被用于PDH，但关于涉及的活性Ga物种的辩论仍在继续。文档还表示，研究人员最近集中在识别ZrO2催化剂中的活性位点并控制其浓度上，以提高PDH效率，无需依赖掺杂剂或支持物种。确定的活性位点涉及可协调的不饱和Zr（Zrcus）和相邻的晶格氧，导致烷烃中的异裂CH键断裂。

总之，由于对丙烯的需求增长，PDH生产方法取得了进展，特别是针对催化剂如Ga/H-ZSM-5和ZrO2。研究继续细化对这些催化剂中活性位点和机制的理解，以提高它们的性能和效率。
