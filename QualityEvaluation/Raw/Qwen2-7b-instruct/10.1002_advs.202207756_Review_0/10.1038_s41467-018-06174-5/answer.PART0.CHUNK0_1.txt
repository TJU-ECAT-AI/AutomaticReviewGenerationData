<p>There are however flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15. According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species. To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15.</p>
<p>Recently,we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane18-20.</p>
<p>Coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus) and neighbouring lattice oxygen were suggested to participate in the dehydrogenation reaction. Yet, the promoter used to purposefully create Zrcus sites either increased or decreased the activity hence proving the limitations of this classical approach for tailored catalyst design.</p>
<p>Here, we describe how nanostructuring of ZrO2 crystallites enables the identification of the nature of active sites for efficient CH bond activation and the control of their concentration without the usage of any dopant or supported species.</p>
<p>The active site consists of two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy, which homolytically break the CH bond in alkanes. The kind of this site differs from that previously suggested by some of us for doped ZrO2-based catalysts18,19 and by other researchers for different metal oxides used for PDH21-23, where metal cation and neighbouring lattice oxygen were assumed to form the active site.</p>
<p>Bare ZrO2 designed especially to maximize the concentration of the active sites shows industrially relevant performance in comparison with commercial-like catalysts containing CrOx or Pt species and other alternative state-of-the-art catalysts.</p>
