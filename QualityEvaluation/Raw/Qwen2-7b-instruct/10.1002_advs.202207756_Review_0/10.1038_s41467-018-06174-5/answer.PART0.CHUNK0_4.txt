[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry,ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso- butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
[2] "Recently,we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane."
[3] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15. According to the U.S. Occu- pational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. A key drawback of Pt- based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species."
[4] "To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15."
[5] "The active site consists of two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy, which homolytically break the CH bond in alkanes."
[6] "This pathway differs from that reported for other metal oxides used for alkane activation, where metal cation and neighbouring lattice oxygen form the active site."
[7] "Bare ZrO2 designed especially to maximize the concentration of the active sites shows industrially relevant performance in comparison with commercial-like catalysts containing CrOx or Pt species and other alternative state-of- the-art catalysts."
[8] "The kind of this site differs from that previously suggested by some of us for doped ZrO2-based catalysts18,19 and by other researchers for different metal oxides used for PDH2123, where metal cation and neighbouring lattice oxygen were assumed to form the active site."
[9] "The concentration of anion vacancies in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size."
[10] "The idea was to create additional Zrcus sites through removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2 in form of H2O or CO2."
[11] "Such distinctive effects of the reducing agents on the increase in the rate are related to their ability to remove lattice oxygen from ZrO2 as proven by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) tests with H2 or CO."
[12] "The use of ZrO2 composed of small crystallites is also beneficial for propene selectivity, which increased with a decrease in the crystallite size."
[13] "An insight into the formation and the kind of carbon deposits, which are the main undesired reaction product, was derived from the operando UV-vis analysis upon PDH over three ZrO2 samples with 9.1, 13.0 or 43.4 nm crystallites."
[14] "The effect of the size of ZrO2 crystallites on coke formation can be explained as follows."
[15] "Exactly this trend was observed experimentally. Further experi- mental and theoretical studies are, however, required to clarify the size effect on coke formation."
[16] "Regardless of the size of ZrO2 crystallites, the activity order did not change, while the dehydrogenation rate of C2H6, C3H8 and iso-C4H10 increased with a decrease in the size."
[17] "The crystallite size is also decisive for the formation of anion vacancies as proven by TPR tests with CO."
[18] "The formed iso-C3H7 fragment is bound to the Zr5cI site, while the H atom is located in a bridged position between Zr5cI and Zr6cII or between Zr5cI and Zr6cIII."
[19] "When one H atom is subtracted from the methyl group of Zr5cIiso-C3H7 stabilized on the d-ZrO2( 111) surface (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 21), weakly adsorbed propene (0.46 eV) is formed."
[20] "Moreover, CH4 activation on the latter centre is exothermic by 1.06 eV."
[21] "The presence of anion vacancies also affects H2 formation (Fig. 6). This process on the s-ZrO2 ( 111) surface has an effective activation barrier of 0.47 eV and is exothermic by 0.28 eV, while the formation of H2 on the d-ZrO2 ( 111) surface is endothermic by 1.40 eV."

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as it is a more environmentally friendly process compared to oil-based cracking technologies. This is because propane and iso-butane dehydrogenation rely on natural or shale gas, which contains significantly fewer impurities than oil-based feedstocks. This has led to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, though these often require metal oxides or contain supported Ru or Rh nanoparticles to achieve high activity in PDH.

2. Commercial catalysts containing CrOx or Pt species have faced several flaws. Chromium(VI) exposure can cause health issues, and Pt-based catalysts suffer from high cost and deactivation due to sintering of Pt species. Redispersing platinum typically involves treating the catalysts with ecologically harmful compounds like Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds.

3. The active sites for efficient CH bond activation in ZrO2 are located at oxygen vacancies and consist of two Zr cations. This differs from the active sites reported for other metal oxides used in PDH, which involve metal cations and neighboring lattice oxygen. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2.

4. The use of ZrO2 with small crystallite sizes enhances propene selectivity and performance in PDH, surpassing commercial catalysts with CrOx or Pt species. The size of the crystallites impacts the concentration of active sites and the apparent activation energy of propene formation.

5. To increase the concentration of active Zr sites, lattice oxygen can be removed from ZrO2 using reducing agents like H2 or CO. This leads to higher propene formation rates, especially with CO, as it removes more lattice oxygen than H2.

6. Coke formation in PDH is influenced by the size of ZrO2 crystallites. There is a delay before coke formation begins, and the duration of this induction period increases with decreasing crystallite size. 

7. The activity order for olefin formation from alkanes, including CH4, C2H6, C3H8, and iso-C4H10, correlates with the strength of the CH bond. However, the size of ZrO2 crystallites does not change this order but increases the dehydrogenation rate of C2H6, C3H8, and iso-C4H10.

8. The size of ZrO2 crystallites affects the formation of anion vacancies, which are crucial for oxygen-ionic conductivity in ZrO2-based materials. The conductivity increases with decreasing crystallite size, indicating a higher concentration of anion vacancies.

9. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that oxygen vacancies facilitate the formation of active sites on ZrO2 surfaces, leading to enhanced catalytic activity in PDH.

10. Propene and cracking products are formed on distinct sites on the ZrO2 catalyst surface, which can be inferred from the UV-vis analysis during PDH.

11. The size of ZrO2 crystallites impacts the rate of carbon deposition during PDH. Larger crystallites lead to higher carbon deposition rates due to more propene molecules adsorbing horizontally to the catalyst surface.

12. DFT calculations reveal that the Zr6cIO2c site on the s-ZrO2( 111) surface is the most favorable for propane activation through a heterolytic route. In contrast, a homolytic process occurs on the d-ZrO2( 111) surface, involving two adjacent Zr cations.

13. After propane activation, the Zr6cI iso-C3H7 fragment binds to the Zr5cI site, while the H atom is located in a bridged position between Zr5cI and Zr6cII or Zr5cI and Zr6cIII.

14. The presence of oxygen vacancies facilitates the formation of active sites on the d-ZrO2( 111) surface, leading to enhanced activity in the activation of both propane and methane.

15. The H2 formation process on the s-ZrO2( 111) surface is exothermic, while on the d-ZrO2( 111) surface, it is endothermic. This difference in activation barriers is attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies.

16. The size of ZrO2 crystallites impacts the formation of anion vacancies, which are responsible for oxygen-ionic conductivity in ZrO2-based materials. This impact is crucial for controlling the catalytic activity and selectivity in PDH.

17. DFT calculations provide molecular insights into the role of Zr sites on the ZrO2 surface in the dehydrogenation of propane and methane, highlighting the importance of oxygen vacancies in facilitating these reactions.

18. The size of ZrO2 crystallites influences the formation of the iso-C3H7 fragment and subsequent propene formation, with smaller crystallites leading to more efficient propene formation.

19. The presence of oxygen vacancies on the d-ZrO2( 111) surface is essential for the activation of methane, as it allows for a lower activation barrier and exothermic reaction.

20. The formation of H2 on the d-ZrO2( 111) surface is endothermic, while on the s-ZrO2( 111) surface, it is exothermic. This difference is attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies on the d-ZrO2( 111) surface.
