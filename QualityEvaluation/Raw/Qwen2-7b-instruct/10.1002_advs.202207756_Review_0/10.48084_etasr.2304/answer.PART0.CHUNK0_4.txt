This study focuses on the numerical analysis of the photocatalytic oxidation of phenol using TiO2 under UV irradiation for wastewater treatment. The research reveals that phenol compounds are completely oxidized at the bottom of the reactor, with the highest conversion rates observed near the reactor walls. Increasing the irradiation time enhances phenol oxidation rates due to enhanced water hydrolysis. Additionally, the study indicates that the oxidation rate of phenol increases with an increase in the initial phenol concentration.

本研究侧重于通过紫外光照射下TiO2的光催化氧化法对工业废水中的苯酚进行去除的数值分析。研究表明，苯酚化合物在反应器底部被完全氧化，在反应器壁附近获得最高转化率。增加照射时间可以提高苯酚氧化速率，这是由于水解作用增强所致。此外，研究发现，初始苯酚浓度的增加会提高苯酚的氧化速率。
