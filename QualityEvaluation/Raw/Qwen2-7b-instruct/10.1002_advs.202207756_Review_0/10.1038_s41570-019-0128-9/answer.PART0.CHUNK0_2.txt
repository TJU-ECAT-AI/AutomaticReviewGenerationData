[1] "The demand for these alkenes is high because they are important petrochemical building blocks."
[2] "However, the conventional routes to produce the alkenes require high operating temperatures and often suffer from severe catalyst coking problems due to over-oxidation and cracking."
[3] "Alternatively, light alkenes can be catalytically produced from non-petroleum resources, such as coal and natural gas."
[4] "This motivates the search for alternative routes to alkenes, which brings us to reactions in which CO2 effects oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) of light alkanes."
