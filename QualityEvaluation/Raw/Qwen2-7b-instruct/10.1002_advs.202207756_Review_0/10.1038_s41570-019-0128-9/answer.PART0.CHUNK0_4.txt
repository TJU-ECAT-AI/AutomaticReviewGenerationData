[1] "The demand for these alkenes is high because they are important petrochemical building blocks."
[2] "Unlike CH4 (ref.2), these light alkanes contain CC bonds that can be dehydrogen- ated to produce C2H4, C3H6 and C4H8 isomers (denoted 
C2
=, C3
= and C4 =, respectively), as well as 1,3-butadiene."
[3] "The conventional routes to produce the alkenes  thermal
steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation (DD) require high operating temperatures and often suffer from severe catalyst coking problems due to over- oxidation and cracking3,4."
[4] "Alternatively, light alkenes can be catalytically produced from non- petroleum resources, such as coal and natural gas. However, the
methanol- to-olefins (MTO)5 and methanol- to-propylene
(MTP) processes6 can produce 610 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of olefin7, while the modified Fischer-Tropsch synthesis8 is capital- intensive."
[5] "More specifically, if we were to source our C2H4 from the CO2-ODH of C2H6, the reaction would offset 9.8% of total global chemical industry CO2 emissions per year and would consume only 0.026% of total global natu- ral gas reserves11, assuming that their C2H6 content is at least1% v/v1."

The growing demand for propylene has driven the exploration of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as traditional methods face challenges such as high temperatures and catalyst coking. For instance, the conventional thermal steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation (DD) processes require high temperatures and often result in severe catalyst degradation due to over-oxidation and cracking. Alternative methods, like the conversion of propane to propylene using carbon dioxide (CO2) in tandem with dehydrogenation, offer a more sustainable route. This method not only reduces the demand for natural gas but also significantly cuts down on CO2 emissions, potentially offsetting 9.8% of global chemical industry CO2 emissions per year by sourcing propylene from the CO2-ODH of propane.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），因为传统方法面临高温和催化剂结焦的问题。例如，传统的蒸汽裂解和直接脱氢（DD）过程需要高温，并经常导致严重的催化剂降解，由于过氧化和裂解。替代方法，如通过二氧化碳（CO2）与脱氢并行转换丙烷到丙烯，提供了更可持续的途径。这种方法不仅减少了对天然气的需求，而且大大减少了二氧化碳排放，有可能每年通过从丙烷的CO2-ODH中获取丙烯来抵消9.8%的全球化学工业二氧化碳排放量。
