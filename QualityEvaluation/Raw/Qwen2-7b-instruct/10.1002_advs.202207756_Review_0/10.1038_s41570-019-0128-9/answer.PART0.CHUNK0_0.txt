[1] "The demand for these alkenes is high because they are important petrochemical building blocks."
[2] "However, the conventional routes to produce the alkenes  thermal steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation (DD) require high operating temperatures and often suffer from severe catalyst coking problems due to over-oxidation and cracking3,4."
[3] "Alternatively, light alkenes can be catalytically produced from non- petroleum resources, such as coal and natural gas."
[4] "The CO2-ODH reaction requires a bifunctional catalyst that dissociates CO2 into CO and a reactive oxygen species *O (the asterisk notation denotes a surface-bound moiety)12,14."
[5] "This Review focuses on how to improve a catalysts selectivity for CH scission over CC scission pathways."
[6] "Thermodynamics analyses of the CO2-ODH reactions of alkanes became more negative with higher alkanes (i- C4>C3>n- C4>C2), perhaps reflecting the favorability of forming more substituted alkenes24."

1. The demand for propylene is high due to its role as a critical petrochemical building block.

2. Traditional methods for producing alkenes, such as thermal steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation, often face issues with high operating temperatures and severe catalyst degradation caused by over-oxidation and cracking.

3. There is an alternative approach of catalytically producing alkenes from non-petroleum sources, like coal and natural gas.

4. The CO2-ODH reaction necessitates a bifunctional catalyst capable of dissociating CO2 into CO and a reactive oxygen species *O.

5. This review centers on enhancing catalysts' ability to selectively break CH bonds over CC bonds.

6. Thermodynamics analyses indicate that CO2-ODH reactions of alkanes are more favorable as the alkane chain length increases, potentially due to the formation of more substituted alkenes.

1. 对丙烯的需求很高，因为它是一种重要的石油化工基础原料。

2. 传统方法生产烯烃，如蒸汽裂解和直接脱氢，往往面临高温操作和严重的催化剂焦化问题，由过氧化和裂解引起。

3. 另一种方法是从非石油资源，如煤炭和天然气，通过催化方式生产烯烃。

4. CO2-ODH反应需要一种双功能催化剂，能够将CO2分解为CO和一个活性氧物种*O。

5. 这一综述专注于提高催化剂选择性，使其能够在断裂CH键上优先于CC键。

6. 热力学分析表明，随着烷基链的增长，CO2-ODH反应对烷烃的倾向性增加，可能是因为形成更多取代的烯烃。
