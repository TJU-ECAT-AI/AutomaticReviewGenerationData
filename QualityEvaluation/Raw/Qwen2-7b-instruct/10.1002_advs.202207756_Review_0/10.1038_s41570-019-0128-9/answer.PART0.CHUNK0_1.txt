[1] "In response to the growing demand for propylene, new production methods have been developed, especially focusing on propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process involves the conversion of propane into propylene using heat and catalysts, offering a viable alternative to traditional steam cracking methods."

[2] "The use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has gained significant attention due to their potential in improving propylene yields and reducing environmental impact. Recent studies have shed light on the active Ga species involved in the PDH process, contributing to a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanisms."

[3] "Research has identified that the active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts play a crucial role in the PDH process. The debate around these species has been ongoing, with some studies suggesting that the Ga-O species are key for the dehydrogenation of propane."

[4] "Recent findings have contributed to our current knowledge of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH by demonstrating the importance of specific surface properties of the catalyst. These properties, such as the presence of acidic sites and the coordination of Ga atoms, are essential for the effective conversion of propane to propylene."
