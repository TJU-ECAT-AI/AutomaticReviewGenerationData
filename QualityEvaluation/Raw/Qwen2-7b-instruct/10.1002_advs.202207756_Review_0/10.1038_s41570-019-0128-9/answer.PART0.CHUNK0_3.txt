[1] "The demand for these alkenes is high because they are important petrochemical building blocks. However, the conventional routes to produce the alkenes  thermal
steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation (DD) require high operating temperatures and often suffer from severe catalyst coking problems due to over- oxidation and cracking3,4."
[2] "Alternatively, light alkenes can be catalytically produced from non- petroleum resources, such as coal and natural gas."
[3] "More specifically, if we were to source our C2H4 from the CO2-ODH of C2H6, the reaction would offset 9.8% of total global chemical industry CO2 emissions per year and would consume only 0.026% of total global natural gas reserves11, assuming that their C2H6 content is at least1% v/v1."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as traditional methods like thermal steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation (DD) require high operating temperatures and often suffer from severe catalyst coking problems due to over-oxidation and cracking. Alternatives include catalytic production from non-petroleum resources like coal and natural gas. Specifically, sourcing propylene from the CO2-ODH of propane could offset 9.8% of total global chemical industry CO2 emissions per year, consuming only 0.026% of total global natural gas reserves, assuming a minimum of 1% v/v of propane in the natural gas.

丙烯需求的增长导致了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），因为传统的热蒸汽裂解和直接脱氢（DD）方法需要高温操作，并且经常遭受严重的催化剂结焦问题，由于过氧化和裂解。替代方案包括从煤炭和天然气等非石油资源的催化生产。具体而言，从二氧化碳氧化脱氢（CO2-ODH）获取丙烷可以抵消全球化工行业9.8%的二氧化碳排放量，仅消耗全球天然气总储量的0.026%，前提是天然气中的丙烷含量至少为1%体积分数。

[1] "In the CO2-ODH reaction, CO2 is a mild oxidant that is not prone to over- oxidizing substrates and does not form an explosive reactive mixture (unlike O2 in the O2-ODH)."
[2] "One must also consider that CO2 can mod- ify the surface and/or bulk composition of a catalyst,and these changes in redox, adsorption and electronic properties can influence activity and selectivity12,13."
[3] "The best catalysts are oxides of reducible metal ions  metal centres that readily donate abundant Carbon dioxide reduction in tandem with light- alkane dehydrogenation ElaineGomez 1, BinhangYan 2, ShyamKattel 1,4 and JingguangG.Chen 1,2*"

In the CO2-ODH reaction, CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, avoiding over-oxidation of substrates and forming a non-explosive reactive mixture unlike oxygen in the O2-ODH reaction. It can modify the surface and/or bulk composition of a catalyst, impacting its redox, adsorption, and electronic properties, which in turn affect its activity and selectivity. The best catalysts for this reaction are oxides of reducible metal ions, with metal centers that readily donate abundant carbon.

在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中，二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂，避免了对底物的过度氧化，并形成了与氧气在O2-ODH反应中的爆炸性反应混合物不同的一种反应性混合物。它能够改变催化剂的表面和/或内部组成，影响其氧化还原、吸附和电子性质，从而影响其活性和选择性。这种反应的最佳催化剂是可还原金属离子的氧化物，具有易于捐赠丰富碳的金属中心。
