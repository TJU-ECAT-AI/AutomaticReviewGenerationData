[1] "In the CO2-ODH reaction, CO2 is a mild oxidant that is not prone to over- oxidizing substrates and does not form an explosive reactive mixture (unlike O2 in the O2-ODH)."
[2] "One must also consider that CO2 can mod- ify the surface and/or bulk composition of a catalyst,and these changes in redox, adsorption and electronic properties can influence activity and selectivity12,13."
[3] "The best catalysts are oxides of reducible metal ions  metal centres that readily donate abundant Carbon dioxide reduction in tandem with light- alkane dehydrogenation ElaineGomez 1, BinhangYan 2, ShyamKattel 1,4 and JingguangG.Chen 1,2*"

In the CO2-ODH reaction, CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, avoiding over-oxidation of substrates and forming a non-explosive reactive mixture unlike oxygen in the O2-ODH reaction. It can modify the surface and/or bulk composition of a catalyst, impacting its redox, adsorption, and electronic properties, which in turn affect its activity and selectivity. The best catalysts for this reaction are oxides of reducible metal ions, with metal centers that readily donate abundant carbon.

The growing demand for propylene has driven the exploration of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as traditional methods face challenges such as high temperatures and catalyst coking. For instance, the conventional thermal steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation (DD) processes require high temperatures and often result in severe catalyst degradation due to over-oxidation and cracking. Alternative methods, like the conversion of propane to propylene using carbon dioxide (CO2) in tandem with dehydrogenation, offer a more sustainable route. This method not only reduces the demand for natural gas but also significantly cuts down on CO2 emissions, potentially offsetting 9.8% of global chemical industry CO2 emissions per year by sourcing propylene from the CO2-ODH of propane.
