The increasing demand for propylene has led to the development of innovative production methods, with a particular focus on propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Recent studies have advanced our understanding of silica-supported GaPt nanoparticles derived from single-sites as highly effective PDH catalysts. The field has also seen progress in elucidating the role of active gallium (Ga) species within Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, which are crucial for PDH processes.
