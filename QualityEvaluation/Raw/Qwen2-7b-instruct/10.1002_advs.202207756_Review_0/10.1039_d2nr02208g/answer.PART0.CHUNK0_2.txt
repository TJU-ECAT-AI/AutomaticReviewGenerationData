1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process has gained significant attention due to its potential for direct propylene production, which has been realized through large-scale applications. However, the use of commercial Pt/Cr-based catalysts has faced challenges such as fast deactivation and reduced stability due to issues like active species sintering and coke deposition.

2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Research has focused on the active Ga species, leading to ongoing debates about their role in the catalytic process. Recent studies have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by providing insights into material design, active origins, and existing problems in the development of PDH catalysts. Advanced synthetic strategies have been developed to improve dehydrogenation activity and stability, addressing the limitations of traditional catalysts.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，新的生产方法得到了发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。由于其潜在的直接丙烯生产能力，该过程已通过大规模应用获得了广泛的关注。然而，使用商业Pt/Cr基催化剂面临着快速失活和稳定性降低的问题，这些问题与活性物种聚集和焦炭沉积有关。

2. 对于PDH中的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解已经显著演变。研究集中在活性Ga物种上，导致关于它们在催化过程中的作用的持续辩论。最近的研究为当前对这些催化剂的知识提供了见解，通过提供有关材料设计、活性起源以及PDH催化剂发展中现有问题的见解。为了提高脱氢活性和稳定性，开发了先进的合成策略，以解决传统催化剂的限制。
