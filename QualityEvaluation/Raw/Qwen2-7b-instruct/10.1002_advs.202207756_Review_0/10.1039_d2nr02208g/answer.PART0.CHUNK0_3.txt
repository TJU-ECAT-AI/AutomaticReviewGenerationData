The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by focusing on the improvement of catalysts. Commercial Pt/Cr-based catalysts have issues with fast deactivation and poor stability due to active species sintering and coke deposition. To address these problems, researchers have suggested strategies such as modifying the support and adding additives to enhance the catalytic performance and durability of these catalysts. This review provides an overview of the development of PDH and PDH catalysts, summarizes advanced research on supported noble and non-noble metals, metal-free materials, and their design, active origins, and existing challenges. It also highlights innovative synthesis strategies for PDH catalysts that improve dehydrogenation activity and stability. Future challenges and directions for PDH catalysts are discussed to facilitate their broader industrial application.
