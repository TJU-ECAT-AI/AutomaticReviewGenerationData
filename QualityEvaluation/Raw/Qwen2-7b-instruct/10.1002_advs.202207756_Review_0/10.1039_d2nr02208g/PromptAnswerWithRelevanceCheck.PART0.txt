The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH technology has become more prominent due to its efficiency in directly producing propylene. However, the current commercial Pt/Cr-based catalysts face challenges such as fast deactivation and poor stability, which are primarily attributed to active species sintering and coke deposition. To address these issues, researchers have explored various strategies, including modifying the support and incorporating additives, to enhance the catalytic performance and durability of these catalysts. This review provides insights into the evolution of PDH and PDH catalysts, summarizing advancements in supported noble and non-noble metals, metal-free materials, material design, active origins, and existing challenges. It also highlights cutting-edge synthesis techniques designed to improve dehydrogenation activity and stability. Future directions for PDH catalysts are outlined to facilitate their industrial application.
