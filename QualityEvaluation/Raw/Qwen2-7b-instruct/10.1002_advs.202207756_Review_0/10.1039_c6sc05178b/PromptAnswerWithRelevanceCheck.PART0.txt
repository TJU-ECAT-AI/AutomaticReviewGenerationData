[1] "The increasing propylene demand combined with the use of alternative feedstocks such as shale gas has amplified the pressure towards propene production and the development of light alkane dehydrogenation processes."
[2] "While the two principal industrial processes for PDH utilize CrAl2O3 (CATOFIN) and PtSnAl2O3 (Oleflex) supported catalysts, other materials such as gallium-based catalysts are receiving considerable attention as alternative catalysts."
[3] "Silica-supported gallium species have been recently prepared by electrostatic adsorption methods. While showing promising results, the structure of the active sites is unknown."
[4] "Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) allows for the generation of well-defined surface species on a variety of supports via grafting of tailored molecular precursors on supports with isolated OH sites. Thus, we reasoned that the development of an appropriate molecular precursor would allow for generating well-defined isolated active sites of gallium outside of bulk Ga2O3."
[5] "These isolated gallium sites were achieved through grafting of 1 on silica followed by a thermolysis step at 500 C under high vacuum."
[6] "The stability of the catalyst probably results from site-isolation of the active site on a non-reducible support such as silica, diminishing facile reduction typical of Ga2O3 catalysts."
[7] "Silica-supported is isolated gallium sites as highly active, selective and stable propane dehydrogenation catalysts."
[8] "The presented gallium species display unprecedented catalytic performances, combining high activity, selectivity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased pressure on developing new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to meet the rising market needs. Alternative catalysts, including gallium-based catalysts, have gained attention as potential replacements for traditional materials like CrAl2O3 (CATOFIN) and PtSnAl2O3 (Oleflex). Gallium-based zeolites have been explored for converting lightweight alkanes to aromatics and hydrogen, suggesting a tandem dehydrogenation aromatization process. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) catalysts have also been investigated, but they often suffer from facile reduction, leading to catalyst deactivation. 

In recent years, researchers have focused on developing isolated gallium sites on silica surfaces through surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC). By using a molecular precursor and grafting it onto silica, they have successfully synthesized gallium single-sites with controlled oxidation states and nuclearities. This method has produced catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and remarkable stability in propane dehydrogenation, surpassing previous Ga2O3 catalysts in performance. The isolation of the active site on a non-reducible support like silica likely contributes to the catalyst's enhanced stability under PDH conditions.

对丙烯的日益增长的需求已经推动了开发新生产方法的压力，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），以满足不断增长的市场需求。作为传统材料如CrAl2O3（CATOFIN）和PtSnAl2O3（Oleflex）替代品，基于镓的催化剂受到了越来越多的关注。基于镓的沸石已经被探索用于将轻质烷烃转化为芳烃和氢气，表明了一种串联脱氢芳香化过程。对于镓氧化物（Ga2O3）催化剂，它们通常容易被还原，导致催化剂失活。

近年来，研究人员集中于通过表面有机金属化学（SOMC）在硅酸盐表面上合成孤立的镓位点。通过使用分子前体并将其接枝到硅酸盐上，他们成功合成了具有控制的氧化状态和核性的孤立镓单点。这种方法产生了在丙烷脱氢中表现出前所未有的催化性能、高活性、选择性和显著稳定性的催化剂，超过了以往的Ga2O3催化剂。孤立的活性位点位于不易还原的支持如硅酸盐上，可能有助于催化剂在PDH条件下的增强稳定性。

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by increasing the pressure for efficient and sustainable production techniques. The shift from naphtha to ethane as a feedstock in cracking plants has led to a decrease in propylene production, highlighting the importance of on-site PDH for maintaining supply. Alternative catalysts, such as gallium-based catalysts, are gaining attention as they offer potential improvements over traditional catalysts like CrAl2O3 (CATOFIN) and PtSnAl2O3 (Oleflex).

Recent research has focused on synthesizing and structurally characterizing gallium complexes, like [Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)], which can be used to create isolated gallium sites on silica surfaces. These sites are achieved through a two-step process involving grafting and thermolysis, resulting in gallium single-sites that demonstrate exceptional catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. The gallium sites possess high activity, selectivity, and stability, contributing to the advancement of PDH technology and the development of more efficient catalysts for propylene production.
