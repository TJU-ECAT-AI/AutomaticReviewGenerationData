[1] "The increasing propylene demand combined with the use of alternative feedstocks such as shale gas has amplified the pressure towards propene production and the development of light alkane dehydrogenation processes."
[2] "While the two principal industrial processes for PDH utilize CrAl2O3 (CATOFIN) and PtSnAl2O3 (Oleflex) supported catalysts,1c, 2 other materials such as gallium-based catalysts are receiving considerable attention as alternative catalysts."
[3] "Gallium-based zeolites have already been implemented for the conversion of lightweight alkanes to aromatics and H2, a process proposed to involve a tandem dehydrogenation aromatization process."
[4] "Ga2O3 and related materials have also been investigated as catalysts for alkane conversion, specifically PDH due to the high selectivity for propylene."
[5] "Several computational and experimental studies have aimed at identifying these active sites,4f, 4h, 4i, 7 which so far remains a topic of debate."
[6] "Silica-supported gallium species have been recently prepared by electrostatic adsorption methods.7a While showing promising results, the structure of the active sites is unknown."
[7] "Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) allows for the generation of well-defined surface species on a variety of supports via grafting of tailored molecular precursors on supports with isolated OH sites.8 Thus, we reasoned that the development of an appropriate molecular precursor would allow for generating well-defined isolated active sites of gallium outside of bulk Ga2O3."
[8] "A two-step approach, involving both SOMC and the thermolytic molecular precursor approach has previously been implemented to generate isolated surface sites with controlled oxidation state and nuclearity.9 Herein we describe the synthesis, structural characterization of the molecular complex [Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)] (1)10 and its utilization as a precursor for generating gallium single-sites on silica."
[9] "These isolated gallium sites were achieved through grafting of 1 on silica followed by a thermolysis step at 500 C under high vacuum."
[10] "The presented gallium species display unprecedented catalytic performances, combining high activity, selectivity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to increased pressure for propene production and the development of light alkane dehydrogenation processes. Alternative catalysts, such as gallium-based materials, are gaining attention as viable alternatives to traditional CrAl2O3 (CATOFIN) and PtSnAl2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts. Gallium-based zeolites have been implemented for converting lightweight alkanes to aromatics and hydrogen, suggesting a tandem dehydrogenation aromatization process. Research has focused on identifying the active sites of gallium in Ga2O3 and related materials, which are known for their high selectivity in PDH due to their propensity for producing propylene. Despite computational and experimental studies, the exact nature of these active sites remains a subject of debate.

2. The development of gallium catalysts for propane dehydrogenation involves a two-step process that combines surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) with thermolytic molecular precursors. This approach allows for the generation of well-defined gallium single-sites on silica surfaces. By grafting a molecular complex onto silica and then thermolyzing it at 500°C under high vacuum, researchers have created isolated gallium sites that exhibit unprecedented catalytic performance. These sites demonstrate high activity, selectivity, and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane, offering a promising avenue for improving PDH efficiency.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，以及对替代原料如页岩气的应用，对丙烯生产和轻质烷烃脱氢过程的压力加大。作为替代催化剂的镓基材料正受到越来越多的关注。已经实施了基于镓的沸石用于将轻质烷烃转化为芳烃和氢气的过程，这被认为是串联脱氢芳构化过程。计算和实验研究已经致力于确定镓在Ga2O3及其相关材料中的活性位点，这些位点由于其对丙烯的高选择性而被用于烷烃转化，尤其是PDH。然而，关于这些活性位点的确切性质仍然存在争议。

2. 铝镓催化剂用于丙烷脱氢涉及两步过程，结合表面有机金属化学（SOMC）与热解分子前体方法。这种方法允许在硅酸盐表面上生成定义明确的孤立镓单点。通过将分子复合物嫁接到硅酸盐上并随后在500°C的高真空下进行热解，研究人员创造了孤立的镓点。这些点在丙烷脱氢中表现出前所未有的催化性能，具有高活性、选择性和稳定性。这一发现为提高PDH效率提供了有前景的途径。
