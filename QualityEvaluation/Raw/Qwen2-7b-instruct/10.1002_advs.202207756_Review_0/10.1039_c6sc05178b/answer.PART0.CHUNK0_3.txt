1. The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in developing new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Gallium-based catalysts, known for their high selectivity in PDH reactions, are being explored as alternatives to traditional catalysts like CrAl2O3 (CATOFIN) and PtSnAl2O3 (Oleflex).

2. Gallium-based zeolites have been utilized for converting lightweight alkanes into aromatics and hydrogen, suggesting they might also be effective in tandem dehydrogenation aromatization processes. Gallium(III) oxide (Ga2O3) and related materials have been studied for alkane conversion, especially PDH, due to their high propylene selectivity.

3. The reducibility of Ga2O3 leads to facile reduction of its active sites, causing catalyst deactivation. This limitation necessitates the development of stable gallium catalysts for PDH.

4. Recent research involves the preparation of silica-supported gallium species through electrostatic adsorption. However, the exact structure of the active sites on these surfaces remains unknown.

5. Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) facilitates the generation of well-defined gallium surface species by grafting tailored molecular precursors onto supports with isolated hydroxyl (OH) sites. This method enables the creation of isolated gallium sites on silica surfaces.

6. The gallium species developed through this process exhibit exceptional catalytic performance, featuring high activity, selectivity, and stability in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长以及页岩气等替代原料的使用，对丙烯生产及其轻质烷烃脱氢过程开发的压力增大。镓基催化剂作为传统催化剂（如CrAl2O3（CATOFIN）和PtSnAl2O3（Oleflex））的替代品，受到了广泛的关注。

2. 镓基沸石已被用于将轻质烷烃转化为芳烃和氢气，这表明它们可能也适用于串联脱氢芳构化过程。镓(III)氧化物（Ga2O3）及其相关材料因高丙烯选择性而被研究用作烷烃转化，特别是PDH反应中的催化剂。

3. 镓(III)氧化物的可还原性导致其活性位点容易被还原，最终导致催化剂失活。因此，需要开发稳定性的镓催化剂以用于PDH反应。

4. 最近的研究涉及通过静电吸附法制备硅胶支持的镓物种。然而，这些表面活性位点的确切结构仍未知。

5. 表面有机金属化学（SOMC）通过在具有孤立羟基（OH）位点的支持体上接枝定制的分子前体来生成定义明确的镓表面物种。这种方法允许在硅胶表面上形成孤立的镓位点。

6. 通过这种过程开发的镓物种表现出卓越的催化性能，结合了高活性、高选择性和稳定性，在丙烷脱氢反应中。
