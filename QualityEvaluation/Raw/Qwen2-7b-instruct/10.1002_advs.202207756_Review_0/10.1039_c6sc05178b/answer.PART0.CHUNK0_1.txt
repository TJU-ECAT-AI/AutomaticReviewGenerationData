The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by increasing the pressure for efficient and sustainable production techniques. The shift from naphtha to ethane as a feedstock in cracking plants has led to a decrease in propylene production, highlighting the importance of on-site PDH for maintaining supply. Alternative catalysts, such as gallium-based catalysts, are gaining attention as they offer potential improvements over traditional catalysts like CrAl2O3 (CATOFIN) and PtSnAl2O3 (Oleflex).

Recent research has focused on synthesizing and structurally characterizing gallium complexes, like [Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)], which can be used to create isolated gallium sites on silica surfaces. These sites are achieved through a two-step process involving grafting and thermolysis, resulting in gallium single-sites that demonstrate exceptional catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. The gallium sites possess high activity, selectivity, and stability, contributing to the advancement of PDH technology and the development of more efficient catalysts for propylene production.

丙烯需求的增长已经影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），通过增加对高效和可持续生产技术的压力。从石脑油到乙烷的裂化工艺转变导致了丙烯产量的下降，这凸显了现场PDH在维持供应方面的关键作用。替代催化剂，如镓基催化剂，正受到关注，因为它们有可能改进传统的催化剂，如CrAl2O3（CATOFIN）和PtSnAl2O3（Oleflex）。

近期的研究集中在合成和结构表征镓复合物，如[Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)]，这些复合物可以用于在硅酸盐表面上创建孤立的镓位点。这一过程涉及两步：接枝和热解，最终形成具有高活性、选择性和稳定性的孤立镓位点，在丙烷脱氢中表现出卓越的催化性能。这些镓位点的性能优异，为PDH技术的进步和更高效的丙烯生产催化剂的发展做出了贡献。
