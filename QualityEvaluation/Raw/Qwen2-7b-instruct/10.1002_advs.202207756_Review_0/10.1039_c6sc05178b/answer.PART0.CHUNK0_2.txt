[1] "The increasing propylene demand combined with the use of alternative feedstocks such as shale gas has amplified the pressure towards propene production and the development of light alkane dehydrogenation processes."
[2] "While the two principal industrial processes for PDH utilize CrAl2O3 (CATOFIN) and PtSnAl2O3 (Oleflex) supported catalysts,1c, 2 other materials such as gallium-based catalysts are receiving considerable attention as alternative catalysts."
[3] "Gallium-based zeolites have already been implemented for the conversion of lightweight alkanes to aromatics and H2, a process proposed to involve a tandem dehydrogenation aromatization process.3 Ga2O3 and related materials have also been investigated as catalysts for alkane conversion, specifically PDH due to the high selectivity for propylene.4"
[4] "Silica-supported gallium species have been recently prepared by electrostatic adsorption methods.7a While showing promising results, the structure of the active sites is unknown."
[5] "Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) allows for the generation of well-defined surface species on a variety of supports via grafting of tailored molecular precursors on supports with isolated OH sites.8 Thus, we reasoned that the development of an appropriate molecular precursor would allow for generating well-defined isolated active sites of gallium outside of bulk Ga2O3."
[6] "These isolated gallium sites were achieved through grafting of 1 on silica followed by a thermolysis step at 500 C under high vacuum. The presented gallium species display unprecedented catalytic performances, combining high activity, selectivity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane."

1. The rising demand for propylene and the adoption of alternative feedstocks, like shale gas, have intensified the focus on propene production and the development of light alkane dehydrogenation processes. Gallium-based catalysts, particularly those on silica supports, have gained attention as alternatives to traditional materials such as CrAl2O3 (CATOFIN) and PtSnAl2O3 (Oleflex).

2. Gallium-based catalysts, including gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and related materials, have been explored for the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics and hydrogen, suggesting a tandem dehydrogenation aromatization process. These catalysts are noted for their high selectivity in producing propylene.

3. There has been an interest in preparing silica-supported gallium species through electrostatic adsorption techniques, although the structure of the active sites remains unknown. Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) offers a method for creating well-defined gallium sites on various supports by grafting tailored molecular precursors onto surfaces with isolated hydroxyl (OH) sites.

4. By grafting a molecular complex on silica followed by a thermolysis step at 500°C under high vacuum, researchers have successfully created isolated gallium sites on the silica surface. These sites demonstrate unparalleled catalytic performance, characterized by high activity, selectivity, and stability in propane dehydrogenation.
