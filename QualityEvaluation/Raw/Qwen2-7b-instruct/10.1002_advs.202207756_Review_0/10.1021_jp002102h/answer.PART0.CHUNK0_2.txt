[1] "The exchange of protons by Co increases propane conversion rates and the rates of formation of desired dehydrogenated products (propene and aromatics)."
[2] "The role of Co cations in desorbing the H atoms formed in CH bond activation steps as H2 is consistent with D2OH measurements, which showed a substantial decrease in the activation energy for D2-dissociation when Co was exchanged onto H-ZSM5."
[3] "Co cations decrease the concentration of surface hydrogen atoms during propane reactions and the hydrogen content in the products of this reaction."
[4] "The anchoring of Co2+ cations at exchange sites places them in close proximity to acid sites, which may be required for the effective transfer of hydrogens, formed at acid sites during alkane dehydrogenation or olefin dehydrocyclization steps, to cations for removal as H2."
[5] "The unreducible nature of Co species suggests that they exist predominantly as Co2+ monomers and (CoOCo)2+ dimers."
[6] "Three types of exchanged Co2+ ions located at different cationic sites in Co/H-ZSM5 were suggested on the basis of a study using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy."

1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, including debates about active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts.
2. Cobalt (Co) cations play a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation by increasing conversion rates and the formation of desired dehydrogenated products such as propene and aromatics. They facilitate the desorption of hydrogen atoms formed during the reaction as hydrogen gas (H2), decreasing the concentration of surface hydrogen atoms in the products.
3. Cobalt cations effectively decrease the hydrogen content in propane dehydrogenation products, thereby enhancing the selectivity towards propene and aromatics.
4. The anchoring of Co2+ cations at exchange sites creates a close proximity to acid sites, enabling efficient hydrogen transfer from these sites to Co cations for removal as H2 during alkane dehydrogenation or olefin dehydrocyclization steps.
5. The structure of Co/H-ZSM5 catalysts consists predominantly of Co2+ monomers and (CoOCo)2+ dimers, which are anchored at exchange sites, contributing to their effectiveness in PDH.
6. Studies utilizing diffuse reflectance spectroscopy have identified three types of exchanged Co2+ ions located at various cationic sites within Co/H-ZSM5 catalysts, further elucidating their roles in PDH processes.

1. 对丙烯日益增长的需求已经推动了新的生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经演进，包括关于活性Ga物种的争论。最近的研究为当前对这些催化剂的知识做出了贡献。
2. 钴（Co）离子在丙烷脱氢过程中起着关键作用，通过提高转化率和形成所需的脱氢产物（丙烯和芳烃），并促进氢原子的脱附作为氢气（H2）。它们降低了反应产物中表面氢原子的浓度。
3. 钴离子有效地降低了丙烷脱氢产物中的氢含量，从而提高了丙烯和芳烃的选择性。
4. 锚定在交换位点的Co2+离子与酸位点紧密相邻，使得酸位点产生的氢转移到Co离子以作为H2去除，这对于烷基脱氢或烯烃脱氢化步骤至关重要。
5. Co/H-ZSM5催化剂的结构主要由Co2+单体和（CoOCo）2+二聚体组成，它们锚定在交换位点上，这有助于其在PDH过程中的有效性。
6. 利用反射光谱技术的研究已识别出三种不同类型的交换Co2+离子位于Co/H-ZSM5催化剂的各种阳离子位点内，进一步阐明了它们在PDH过程中的作用。
