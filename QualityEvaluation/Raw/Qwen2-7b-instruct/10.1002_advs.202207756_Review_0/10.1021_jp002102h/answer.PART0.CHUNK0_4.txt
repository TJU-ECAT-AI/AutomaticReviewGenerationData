The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This technology aims to convert propane into propylene, a crucial component in the petrochemical industry. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was a debate about the active Ga species involved in the catalytic process. Recent research has provided insights into the structure and properties of these catalysts, confirming the presence of Ga species that enhance the efficiency of PDH reactions.
