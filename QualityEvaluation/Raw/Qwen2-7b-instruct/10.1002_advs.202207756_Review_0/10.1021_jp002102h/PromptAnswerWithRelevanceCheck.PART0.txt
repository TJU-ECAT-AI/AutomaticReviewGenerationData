[1] "The exchange of protons in H-ZSM5 with Co2+ cations significantly increased initial propane conversion turnover rates (per Al), from 9.6 × 10-4 s-1 on H-ZSM5 to 2.6 × 10-3 s-1 on Co-ZSM5 (Co/Al = 0.12) and to 4.2 × 10-3 s-1 on Co-ZSM5 (Co/Al = 0.22)."
[2] "The selectivities to C1C2 and propene products show a non-zero intercept suggesting that these products can form via primary cracking reactions of propane."
[3] "The effects of Co on the product selectivity are shown in Figure 15 at the same propane conversion (10%). C1C2 selectivity decreased and C6C8 aromatics selectivity increased with increasing Co content, indicating that the addition of Co favors the formation of dehydrogenated products."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH involves the conversion of propane to propylene, a key intermediate in the petrochemical industry. This process has seen advancements in catalyst design, particularly focusing on zeolite materials like H-ZSM-5. Researchers have developed cobalt (Co)-exchanged versions of H-ZSM-5 to enhance the efficiency of PDH. These catalysts have demonstrated higher rates of propane conversion, improved selectivity towards propylene and aromatics, and an increased ability to desorb hydrogen as hydrogen gas, which is crucial for maintaining the efficiency of the PDH process.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the understanding has evolved over time. Initially, there was debate about the active species involved in the catalytic process. Recent research has contributed to a clearer understanding of these catalysts. It has been found that the Ga species play a role in enhancing the activity of the catalysts, particularly in promoting the dehydrogenation reactions. The Ga ions are believed to anchor the active sites, facilitating the transfer of hydrogen from the acidic sites of the zeolite to the metal ions for desorption as hydrogen gas. This mechanism helps in optimizing the conversion of propane to propylene and minimizing unwanted side reactions. Additionally, the study of the structural and functional requirements in alkane reactions catalyzed by cation-exchanged H-ZSM-5 materials has provided insights into the role of the exchanged cations in enhancing the catalytic properties of these materials. The findings suggest that the cations, such as Co, interact closely with acid sites, enabling efficient hydrogen transfer and removal, which is critical for achieving high selectivities and yields in PDH processes.
