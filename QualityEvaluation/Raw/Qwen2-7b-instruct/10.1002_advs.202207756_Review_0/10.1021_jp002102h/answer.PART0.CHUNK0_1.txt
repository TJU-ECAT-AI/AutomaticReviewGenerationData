The demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH converts propane to propylene, a key component in the production of plastics and other petrochemicals. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly over time. Initially, there was considerable debate about the active Ga species involved in the PDH process. Recent research has provided insights into the structure and functionality of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, revealing the presence of Ga2+ cations that play a crucial role in facilitating the dehydrogenation reactions.

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly focusing on propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH technology aims to convert propane into propylene, which is vital for the manufacturing of plastics and other petrochemical products. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has seen substantial progress. There was once a considerable discussion about the active Ga species involved in the PDH process. However, recent studies have offered valuable insights into the structure and function of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, highlighting the importance of Ga2+ cations in driving the dehydrogenation reactions.
