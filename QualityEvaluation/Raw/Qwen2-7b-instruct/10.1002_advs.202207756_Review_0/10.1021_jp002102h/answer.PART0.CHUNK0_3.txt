[1] "The exchange of protons in H-ZSM5 with Co2+ cations significantly increased initial propane conversion turnover rates (per Al), from 9.6 × 10-4 s-1 on H-ZSM5 to 2.6 × 10-3 s-1 on Co-ZSM5 (Co/Al = 0.12) and to 4.2 × 10-3 s-1 on Co-ZSM5 (Co/Al = 0.22)."
[2] "The selectivities to C1C2 and propene products show a non-zero intercept suggesting that these products can form via primary cracking reactions of propane."
[3] "The effects of Co on the product selectivity are shown in Figure 15 at the same propane conversion (10%). C1C2 selectivity decreased and C6C8 aromatics selectivity increased with increasing Co content, indicating that the addition of Co favors the formation of dehydrogenated products."
[4] "The role of Co cations in desorbing the H atoms formed in CH bond activation steps as H2 is consistent with D2OH measurements, which showed a substantial decrease in the activation energy for D2-dissociation when Co was exchanged onto H-ZSM5."
[5] "Co cations decrease the concentration of surface hydrogen atoms during propane reactions and the hydrogen content in the products of this reaction."
[6] "The anchoring of Co2+ cations at exchange sites places them in close proximity to acid sites, which may be required for the effective transfer of hydrogens, formed at acid sites during alkane dehydrogenation or olefin dehydrocyclization steps, to cations for removal as H2."
[7] "In situ near-edge X-ray absorption (XAS) studies indicate that Co species exist at cation exchange sites with tetrahedral coordination after dehydration and that they remain as divalent cations during exposure to H2 or to C3H8 at 773 K."
[8] "Near-edge and fine structure analysis of XAS data showed the presence of well-dispersed Co2+ cations in all Co/H-ZSM5 samples (Co/Al < 0.22), indicating the formation of similar exchanged species at all Co contents."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH involves the conversion of propane to propylene, a key intermediate in the petrochemical industry. This process has seen advancements in catalyst design, particularly focusing on zeolite materials like H-ZSM-5. Researchers have developed cobalt (Co)-exchanged versions of H-ZSM-5 to enhance the efficiency of PDH. These catalysts have demonstrated higher rates of propane conversion, improved selectivity towards propylene and aromatics, and an increased ability to desorb hydrogen as hydrogen gas, which is crucial for maintaining the efficiency of the PDH process.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the understanding has evolved over time. Initially, there was debate about the active species involved in the catalytic process. Recent research has contributed to a clearer understanding of these catalysts. It has been found that the Ga species play a role in enhancing the activity of the catalysts, particularly in promoting the dehydrogenation reactions. The Ga ions are believed to anchor the active sites, facilitating the transfer of hydrogen from the acidic sites of the zeolite to the metal ions for desorption as hydrogen gas. This mechanism helps in optimizing the conversion of propane to propylene and minimizing unwanted side reactions. Additionally, the study of the structural and functional requirements in alkane reactions catalyzed by cation-exchanged H-ZSM-5 materials has provided insights into the role of the exchanged cations in enhancing the catalytic properties of these materials. The findings suggest that the cations, such as Co, interact closely with acid sites, enabling efficient hydrogen transfer and removal, which is critical for achieving high selectivities and yields in PDH processes.

丙烯的日益增长的需求已经影响了生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯，这是石油化工行业的关键中间体。这一过程在催化剂设计方面取得了进步，特别是针对像H-ZSM-5这样的沸石材料。研究人员开发了钴（Co）交换的H-ZSM-5催化剂来提高PDH的效率。这些催化剂表现出更高的丙烷转化率、对丙烯和芳香族化合物的改进选择性以及增强从催化材料表面去除氢气的能力，这对于保持PDH过程的效率至关重要。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH，其理解经历了演变。最初，关于催化过程中的活性物种存在争议。最近的研究为这些催化剂提供了更清晰的理解。研究发现Ga物种在提高催化剂活性方面发挥了作用，尤其是在促进脱氢反应中。Ga离子被认为锚定了活性位点，促进了氢从沸石的酸性位点转移到金属离子进行脱氢，从而作为氢气气体释放。这一机制有助于优化丙烷转化为丙烯的过程并减少不希望的副反应。此外，对交换H-ZSM-5材料中烷烃反应结构和功能要求的研究提供了这些材料催化性能增强的见解。研究结果表明，这些离子，如Co，与酸性位点紧密相互作用，能够高效地转移和去除氢气，这对于实现PDH过程的高选择性和产率至关重要。
