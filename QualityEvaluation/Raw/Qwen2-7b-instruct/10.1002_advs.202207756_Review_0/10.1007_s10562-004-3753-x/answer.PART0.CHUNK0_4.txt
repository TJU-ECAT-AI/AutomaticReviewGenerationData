[1] "Despite considerable research efforts in the area of Ga-containing zeolites [311], the exact role of gallium in this mechanism has not been totally elucidated yet, with proposals for its role as dehydrogenation function in a pure bifunctional [36] or concerted mechanism [7] and as a promoter to recombinative hydrogen removal during alkane dehydrogenation on Brnsted acid sites [811] receiving most attention."
[2] "The structure of the active intrazeolite Ga species and their reactivity in oxidative and reductive conditions has not been fully resolved yet, owing to the wide variety of possible structures including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga species such as Ga2O and cationic Ga species in oxidized or reduced form."
[3] "The activation of a dimethylgallium/ZSM-5 precursor to well-defined reduced and oxidized species is studied by in situ Ga K edge XANES. The precursor is prepared by chemical implanting of trimethylgallium on acidic HZSM-5."
[4] "Subsequent reduction leads to charge-compensating Ga+ species. Direct oxidation of the trimethylgallium precursor leads to various forms of gallium oxide and regeneration of Brnsted acid protons."
[5] "Oxidation of the reduced Ga+ species yields predominantly to GaO+ species."
[6] "GaO+ species exhibit a much higher H2/D2 exchange activity than reduced Ga+ species."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through ongoing debates about active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by studying the activation of Ga/ZSM-5 precursors. This involves preparing the catalyst by chemical implanting of trimethylgallium on acidic HZSM-5, leading to the formation of various gallium oxide species upon oxidation. These studies show that the GaO+ species exhibit a higher H2/D2 exchange activity compared to reduced Ga+ species.

丙烯需求的增长已经影响了新的生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已通过关于活性Ga物种的持续争论而发展。最近的研究发现通过研究Ga/ZSM-5前体的活化，已经为这些催化剂的知识做出了贡献。这涉及到通过在酸性HZSM-5上化学植入三甲基镓来制备催化剂，随后通过氧化形成各种镓氧化物物种。研究表明，GaO+物种的H2/D2交换活性高于还原的Ga+物种。
