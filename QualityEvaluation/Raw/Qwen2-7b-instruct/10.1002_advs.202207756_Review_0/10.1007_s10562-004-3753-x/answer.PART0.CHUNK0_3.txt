[1] "Gallium dispersed in acid materials can be applied to dehydrogenate alkanes."
[2] "Despite considerable research efforts in the area of Ga-containing zeolites [311], the exact role of gallium in this mechanism has not been totally elucidated yet."
[3] "The activation of a dimethylgallium/ZSM-5 precursor to well-defined reduced and oxidized species is studied by in situ Ga K edge XANES."
[4] "Acti- vation was carried out by reduction with molecular hydrogen because this results in better-defined species compared to an oxidative pretreatment [21]."
[5] "We report an in situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) study of the thermal activation of these species."
[6] "A previous Ga K edge XAS study [10] indicated that the oxidation state of the reduced Ga species changes upon cooling indicating that in situ studies at relatively high temperatures are a prerequisite."

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with ongoing debates about the active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts.
2. The X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) study of the thermal activation of dimethylgallium/ZSM-5 precursors provides insights into the role of gallium in the dehydrogenation process. The use of molecular hydrogen for activation results in better-defined species compared to oxidative pretreatment.
3. An in situ XANES study of the thermal activation of gallium alkyl species in medium-pore zeolites offers valuable information about the structure and reactivity of the active intrazeolite Ga species.
4. The oxidation state of reduced Ga species changes upon cooling, highlighting the importance of in situ studies at relatively high temperatures for understanding these catalysts.
