[1] "Despite considerable research efforts in the area of Ga-containing zeolites [3-11], the exact role of gallium in this mechanism has not been totally elucidated yet, with proposals for its role as dehydrogenation function in a pure bifunctional [3,6] or concerted mechanism [7] and as a promoter to recombinative hydrogen removal during alkane dehydrogenation on Brnsted acid sites [8-11] receiving most attention."
[2] "The structure of the active intrazeolite Ga species and their reactivity in oxidative and reductive conditions has not been fully resolved yet, owing to the wide variety of possible structures including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga species such as Ga2O and cationic Ga species in oxidized or reduced form."
[3] "Various methods to incorporate extra-framework gallium into the micropore space of HZSM-5 have been described [12] including impregnation [13,14] and ion-exchange [15] with Ga3+ salts, physical mixing with Ga2O3 [16] and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of GaCl3 [17,18]."
[4] "In order to prepare better-defined Ga species in medium-pore zeolites we have recently examined the CVD of trimethylgallium (TMG) in HZSM-5 and HMOR [21]. In short, TMG can effectively replace the Brnsted acid protons in HZSM-5, resulting in mononuclear dimethylgallium species."
[5] "Activation was carried out by reduction with molecular hydrogen because this results in better-defined species compared to an oxidative pretreatment [21]. Nevertheless, we will also address the oxidation of the zeolite-occluded gallium alkyl species."
[6] "The GaO+ species exhibit a much higher H2/D2 exchange activity than reduced Ga+ species."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was considerable debate about the active Ga species involved in the catalytic process. However, recent research has provided insights into the structure of the active intrazeolite Ga species and their reactivity in both oxidative and reductive conditions. This includes the discovery that TMG can effectively replace Brnsted acid protons in HZSM-5, leading to the formation of mononuclear dimethylgallium species. These species show higher H2/D2 exchange activity when oxidized, compared to reduced Ga+ species. The activation of these catalysts often involves reduction with molecular hydrogen, which helps in forming better-defined species, though oxidation of the zeolite-occluded gallium alkyl species is also considered.

丙烯日益增长的需求推动了新的生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的作用，理解已经显著进步。最初，关于活性Ga物种的作用存在大量争议。然而，最近的研究提供了关于活性内沸石Ga物种结构及其在氧化和还原条件下的反应性的见解。这包括发现TMG可以有效地取代HZSM-5上的Brnsted酸质子，导致形成单核二甲基镓物种。这些物种在氧化时显示出比还原态Ga+物种更高的H2/D2交换活性。催化剂的激活通常涉及使用分子氢进行还原，有助于形成更明确的物种，尽管对嵌入沸石中的镓烷基物种的氧化也有所考虑。
