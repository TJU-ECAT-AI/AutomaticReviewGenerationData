<p>The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process converts propane into propylene, a key component in the petrochemical industry. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly.</p>
<p>Recent research has focused on the nature of active Ga species within these catalysts. Contrary to earlier beliefs, it has been found that Ga atoms do not act as acid sites. Instead, they play a role in the formation of oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for the catalytic activity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 in PDH.</p>

The increasing need for propylene has prompted the creation of new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The study of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has seen advancements, particularly concerning the active Ga species. Contrary to previous assumptions, Ga atoms do not function as acid sites. Rather, they contribute to the creation of oxygen vacancies, which are essential for the catalytic effectiveness of Ga/H-ZSM-5 in PDH processes.
