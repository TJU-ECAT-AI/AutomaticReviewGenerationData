[1] "During the past few years, organometallic cobalt-catalyzed CH activation has emerged as an increasingly viable tool for the step-economical functionalization and assembly of organic molecules."
[2] "The development of low-valent cobalt-catalysis set the stage for CH arylations, alkenylations, benzylations, and alkylations of arenes as well as alkenes under rather mild reaction conditions."
[3] "In contrast, the discovery of high-valent cobalt(II) and cobalt(III) catalysis recently set the stage for versatile CH functionalization processes."
[4] "Generally, the high-valent cobalt catalyst precursors are air-stable and offer an excellent functional group tolerance at rather low catalyst loading."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), leading to the emergence of organometallic cobalt-catalyzed CH activation as a viable tool for step-economical functionalization and assembly of organic molecules. Low-valent cobalt-catalysis has set the stage for various CH functionalizations, including arylations, alkenylations, benzylations, and alkylations of arenes and alkenes under mild conditions. The discovery of high-valent cobalt(II) and cobalt(III) catalysis has further advanced the field, offering versatile CH functionalization processes with air-stable precursors that exhibit excellent functional group tolerance at low catalyst loadings.

The increasing need for propylene has prompted the creation of new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The study of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has seen advancements, particularly concerning the active Ga species. Contrary to previous assumptions, Ga atoms do not function as acid sites. Rather, they contribute to the creation of oxygen vacancies, which are essential for the catalytic effectiveness of Ga/H-ZSM-5 in PDH processes.

<p>During the past few years, organometallic cobalt-catalyzed CH activation has emerged as an increasingly viable tool for the step-economical functionalization and assembly of organic molecules. Thus, the development of low-valent cobalt-catalysis set the stage for CH arylations, alkenylations, benzylations, and alkylations of arenes as well as alkenes under rather mild reaction conditions.</p>
<p>In addition to hydroarylations and hydroacylations, CH functionalizations with organic electrophiles have proven particularly instrumental for the development of step-economical syntheses. Hence, these inexpensive catalysts proved generally applicable and enabled applications to the synthesis of block-buster drug scaffolds, among others.</p>
<p>A significant ligand rate acceleration was achieved, most notably with monodentate N-heterocyclic carbene or phosphine ligands that provide kinetic stabilization through a bulky substitution pattern.</p>
<p>The majority of low-valent cobalt-catalyzed CH activations thus far called for stoichiometric amounts of Grignard reagents, partly because of the reductive in situ generation of the catalytically active cobalt catalysts, with notable exceptions by Vinogradov, Kisch, Brookhart, and Petit in addition reactions.</p>
<p>In contrast, the discovery of high-valent cobalt(II) and cobalt(III) catalysis recently set the stage for versatile CH functionalization processes.</p>
<p>For instance, the positional and chemo selectivities in direct allylations, and annulations were found considerably improved, while the catalytic efficacy in CH amidations or annulations of aldehydes proceeded best with cobalt(III) catalysts.</p>

<p>The growing demand for propylene has led to a surge in the exploration and development of new production methods, with particular emphasis on propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This technology allows for the conversion of propane into propylene, a key component in the petrochemical industry.</p>
<p>Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was considerable debate about the active Ga species involved in the catalytic process. Recent research has shed light on the role of these catalysts, confirming the importance of gallium (Ga) in the dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>One of the key findings is that gallium, when incorporated into the zeolite structure, enhances the activity and stability of the catalyst. This is due to its ability to form strong bonds with the zeolite framework, facilitating the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene.</p>
<p>Another critical aspect is the regeneration process of these catalysts. Researchers have discovered that the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts can be effectively regenerated, allowing for continuous operation without significant loss of efficiency. This property is crucial for industrial applications, as it reduces operational costs and environmental impact.</p>
