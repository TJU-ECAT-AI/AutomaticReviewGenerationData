[1] "During the past few years, organometallic cobalt-catalyzed CH activation has emerged as an increasingly viable tool for the step-economical functionalization and assembly of organic molecules."
[2] "The development of low-valent cobalt-catalysis set the stage for CH arylations, alkenylations, benzylations, and alkylations of arenes as well as alkenes under rather mild reaction conditions."
[3] "In contrast, the discovery of high-valent cobalt(II) and cobalt(III) catalysis recently set the stage for versatile CH functionalization processes."
[4] "Generally, the high-valent cobalt catalyst precursors are air-stable and offer an excellent functional group tolerance at rather low catalyst loading."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), leading to the emergence of organometallic cobalt-catalyzed CH activation as a viable tool for step-economical functionalization and assembly of organic molecules. Low-valent cobalt-catalysis has set the stage for various CH functionalizations, including arylations, alkenylations, benzylations, and alkylations of arenes and alkenes under mild conditions. The discovery of high-valent cobalt(II) and cobalt(III) catalysis has further advanced the field, offering versatile CH functionalization processes with air-stable precursors that exhibit excellent functional group tolerance at low catalyst loadings.

丙烯需求的增长已经影响了新的生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），导致了使用有机金属钴催化CH激活作为步骤经济化功能化和有机分子组装的有效工具的出现。低价钴催化剂的发展为芳基化、烯基化、苯基化和烷基化等各种CH功能化提供了舞台，这些反应可以在温和条件下进行。高价钴(II)和钴(III)催化体系的发现进一步推动了该领域的发展，提供了一种空气稳定的前体，其在较低催化剂负载下表现出优秀的功能团兼容性。
