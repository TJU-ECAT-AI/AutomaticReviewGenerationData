<p>During the past few years, organometallic cobalt-catalyzed CH activation has emerged as an increasingly viable tool for the step-economical functionalization and assembly of organic molecules. Thus, the development of low-valent cobalt-catalysis set the stage for CH arylations, alkenylations, benzylations, and alkylations of arenes as well as alkenes under rather mild reaction conditions.</p>
<p>In addition to hydroarylations and hydroacylations, CH functionalizations with organic electrophiles have proven particularly instrumental for the development of step-economical syntheses. Hence, these inexpensive catalysts proved generally applicable and enabled applications to the synthesis of block-buster drug scaffolds, among others.</p>
<p>A significant ligand rate acceleration was achieved, most notably with monodentate N-heterocyclic carbene or phosphine ligands that provide kinetic stabilization through a bulky substitution pattern.</p>
<p>The majority of low-valent cobalt-catalyzed CH activations thus far called for stoichiometric amounts of Grignard reagents, partly because of the reductive in situ generation of the catalytically active cobalt catalysts, with notable exceptions by Vinogradov, Kisch, Brookhart, and Petit in addition reactions.</p>
<p>In contrast, the discovery of high-valent cobalt(II) and cobalt(III) catalysis recently set the stage for versatile CH functionalization processes.</p>
<p>For instance, the positional and chemo selectivities in direct allylations, and annulations were found considerably improved, while the catalytic efficacy in CH amidations or annulations of aldehydes proceeded best with cobalt(III) catalysts.</p>

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the need for more efficient and cost-effective catalysts. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, with researchers focusing on the active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, revealing that the Ga species play a crucial role in the PDH process. The ongoing debate about the active Ga species has been addressed by identifying specific types of Ga species that are most effective in the PDH reaction, contributing to the optimization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for propylene production.
