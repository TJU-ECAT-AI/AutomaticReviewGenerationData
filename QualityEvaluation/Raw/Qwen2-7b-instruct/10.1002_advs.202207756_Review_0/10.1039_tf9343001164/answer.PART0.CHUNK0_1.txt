The research aimed to distinguish between two theories regarding hydrogen exchange reactions on metallic catalysts. They concluded that the exchange between benzene and hydrogen, as well as between ethylene and hydrogen, occurs according to mechanism (11). The experiments showed that the rate of hydrogen exchange between benzene and water was approximately 105 times slower than that between hydrogen gas and benzene. The exchange between ethylene and benzene was found to be fifty times slower than the water-benzene exchange. The key processes involved were the activated adsorption of hydrogen and the double bond compound on the surface, leading to the formation of two new links with the catalyst. Recent experiments confirmed that the rate of hydrogen exchange with water and ethylene was decreased in a similar ratio compared to water and benzene exchange.

研究旨在区分两种关于金属催化剂上氢交换反应的理论。他们得出结论，苯与氢以及乙烯与氢的交换过程遵循机制(11)。实验表明，苯与水之间的氢交换速率约为氢气与苯之间速率的105倍。乙烯与苯之间的氢交换速率比水-苯交换慢五十倍。关键过程包括氢和双键化合物在表面的活性吸附，导致与催化剂形成两个新的连接。最近的实验证实了水和乙烯与水和苯之间的氢交换速率下降的比例相似。
