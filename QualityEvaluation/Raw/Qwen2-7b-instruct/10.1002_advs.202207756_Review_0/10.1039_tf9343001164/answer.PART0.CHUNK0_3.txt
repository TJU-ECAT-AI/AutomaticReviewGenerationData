1. The experiments leading to the conclusion were based on specific considerations regarding hydrogen exchange mechanisms.
2. The rate of hydrogen exchange between molecules can be governed by the slower dissociation process of the two molecules.
3. The decision-making process involves comparing the rates of hydrogen exchange in different scenarios.
4. Hydrogen is allowed to undergo atomic interchange with benzene on a platinum or nickel surface.
5. If the rate of hydrogen replacement is significantly slower in the second experiment compared to the first, mechanism (I) is not responsible for the reaction in the first case.
6. The rate of hydrogen exchange between benzene and water is notably slower than between hydrogen gas and benzene on nickel.
7. The first-order rate of reaction for benzene and hydrogen is specified at a certain temperature.
8. The rate of exchange between water and ethylene has been decreased similarly to the decrease between water and benzene.
9. The rate of exchange between ethylene and benzene is approximately fifty times slower than between water and benzene.
10. The experiments confirm that atomic exchanges between benzene and hydrogen, and between ethylene and hydrogen, occur according to mechanism II, not I.
11. Mechanism II(b) is represented as a four-atom problem.
12. Mechanism II(a) is represented as a five-atom problem.
13. The primary difference between II(a) and II(b) is that II(b) simplifies to a four-atom problem, while II(a) remains a five-atom problem.
14. The wandering of the double bond upon adsorption suggests a chemi-adsorption of unsaturated compounds.
