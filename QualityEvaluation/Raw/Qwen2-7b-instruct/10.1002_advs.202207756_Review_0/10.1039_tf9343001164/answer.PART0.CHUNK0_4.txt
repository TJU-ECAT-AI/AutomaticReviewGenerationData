1. Heavy water was sourced from the California Isotope Company and distilled several times over potassium permanganate before use. The deuterium content was determined to be 2.70% through the use of a micropycnometer to measure the density of the water. Kahlbaum's thiophene-free benzene was used directly without additional treatment.
2. The final purification of benzene involved drying with phosphorus pentoxide. Any remaining traces of benzene in the water were eliminated by passing it through the furnace used for the combustion of benzene and ethylene.
3. The hydrogen exchange between water and benzene is documented in Table I.
4. No exchange was observed in the experiments conducted at room temperature.
5. The reaction with ethylene was incomplete at 80°C after seven hours of contact, achieving equilibrium after twenty-seven hours.
6. Preliminary results were published in Nature in 1934.
7. The rate of hydrogen exchange between benzene and water is approximately 105 times slower than that between hydrogen gas and benzene on nickel.
8. The rate of exchange with water and ethylene has decreased in a similar ratio to the exchange between water and benzene.
9. The rate of exchange between ethylene and benzene is roughly fifty times slower than between water and benzene.

1. 重水从加州同位素公司获得，经过多次高锰酸钾蒸馏后使用。通过微气相法测量水的密度确定其氘含量为2.70%。没有进一步处理，直接使用卡哈尔无噻吩苯。
2. 苯的最终纯化是通过干燥五氧化二磷完成的。水中的任何剩余苯被通过用于燃烧苯和乙烷的炉子消除。
3. 水与苯之间的氢交换记录在表一中。
4. 在室温下进行的实验未观察到交换。
5. 乙烷反应在80°C时不完全，在接触7小时后达到不完全平衡，并在27小时后达到平衡。
6. 1934年，初步结果发表在《自然》杂志上。
7. 苯与水之间的氢交换速率大约是氢气与镍表面的苯之间交换速率的105倍。
8. 水和乙烷与水之间的交换速率降低的比例与水和苯之间的交换速率相似。
9. 乙烷与苯之间的交换速率大约是水与苯之间的交换速率的50倍。
