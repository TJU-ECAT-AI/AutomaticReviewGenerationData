[1] "The experiments which have led us to this conclusion are based on the following considerations."
[2] "We allow (i) hydrogen to enter into atomic interchange with benzene on a platinum or nickel surface, as described in our first note and (ii) then bring the same catalyst into contact with water and benzene; if, now,we find that the rate of replacement of hydrogen is much slower in the second experiment than in the first, we may conclude that mechanism (I) is not the one responsible for the reaction in the first case."
[3] "The results for hydrogen exchange between water and ethylene are shown in Table 11."
[4] "We can apply the arguments of paragraph 11 to this reaction and to the comparison of this reaction with those between the separate hydrocarbons and water."
[5] "Mechanism II(b).-This can be represented as :-"
[6] "H*--Ni"
[7] "H*--Ni / \ H H"
[8] "Initial state."
[9] "Transition state."
[10] "Final replaced state."
[11] "Mechanism II(a).-This can be represented as :-"
[12] "H H"
[13] "H Ni-H C-H* - Ni I Ni-H C H*-Ni Ni---H--&--H---Ni"
[14] "II H-C"
[15] "I H-C"
[16] "I H-C"
[17] "H-C"
[18] "Initial state."
[19] "Transition state."
[20] "Final replaced state."
[21] "The hydrogen atoms will approach the two carbon atoms of an unsaturated link or the neighbouring carbon atoms of a benzene molecule independently of one another, and we can assume that they will in general attach themselves to these two carbon atoms at different times."
[22] "If, however, the separate approaches of the two hydrogen atoms occur within a very short interval of time (so that the attachment of the hydrogen to the second carbon atom occurs before the other carbon atom has lost a hydrogen atom), the configuration corresponding to the hydrogenated compound will become stable."
[23] "An essential feature of this point of view is that the hydrogenation process results from the statistically independent approach of two hydrogen atoms ; hence, hydrogenation will be a bimolecular process, whereas replacement is unimolecular with respect to the hydrogen."
[24] "Therefore, at low pressures the replacement reaction will predominate ;this conclusion is strikingly borne out by the experiments with water and ethylene and with water and benzene."

The document describes the development of hydrogen exchange experiments to differentiate between two mechanisms (I and II) for hydrogen exchange reactions on metallic catalysts. The experiments involve allowing hydrogen to interact with benzene or ethylene on a catalyst, and then comparing the rate of hydrogen exchange with water. Slower exchange rates with water compared to hydrogen indicate that mechanism (I), which involves hydrogen dissociation, is not responsible. The document also discusses the mechanism of hydrogenation, distinguishing it from replacement reactions, and how at low pressures, replacement rather than hydrogenation predominates. The text provides insights into the dynamics of hydrogen exchange and catalysis on metallic surfaces.

文档描述了通过氢交换实验来区分金属催化剂上氢交换反应的两种机制（I和II）。实验包括允许氢与苯或乙烯在催化剂上相互作用，然后比较与水的氢交换速率。与氢相比，使用水进行交换速率较慢，这表明机制（I），涉及氢解离的过程，不是负责该反应的原因。文本还讨论了氢化过程的机制，将其与替换反应区分开，并指出在低压下，替换而不是氢化占主导地位。文本提供了关于金属表面氢交换和催化动力学的见解。
