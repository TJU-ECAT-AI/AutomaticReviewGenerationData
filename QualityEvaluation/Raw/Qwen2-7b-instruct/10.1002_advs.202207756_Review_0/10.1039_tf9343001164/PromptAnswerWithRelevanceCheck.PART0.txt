The research aimed to distinguish between two theories regarding hydrogen exchange reactions on metallic catalysts. They concluded that the exchange between benzene and hydrogen, as well as between ethylene and hydrogen, occurs according to mechanism (11). The experiments showed that the rate of hydrogen exchange between benzene and water was approximately 105 times slower than that between hydrogen gas and benzene. The exchange between ethylene and benzene was found to be fifty times slower than the water-benzene exchange. The key processes involved were the activated adsorption of hydrogen and the double bond compound on the surface, leading to the formation of two new links with the catalyst. Recent experiments confirmed that the rate of hydrogen exchange with water and ethylene was decreased in a similar ratio compared to water and benzene exchange.

[22] "If, however, the separate approaches of the two hydrogen atoms occur within a very short interval of time (so that the attachment of the hydrogen to the second carbon atom occurs before the other carbon atom has lost a hydrogen atom), the configuration corresponding to the hydrogenated compound will become stable."
[23] "An essential feature of this point of view is that the hydrogenation process results from the statistically independent approach of two hydrogen atoms ; hence, hydrogenation will be a bimolecular process, whereas replacement is unimolecular with respect to the hydrogen."
[24] "Therefore, at low pressures the replacement reaction will predominate ;this conclusion is strikingly borne out by the experiments with water and ethylene and with water and benzene."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document describes the development of hydrogen exchange experiments to differentiate between two mechanisms (I and II) for hydrogen exchange reactions on metallic catalysts. The experiments involve allowing hydrogen to interact with benzene or ethylene on a catalyst, and then comparing the rate of hydrogen exchange with water. Slower exchange rates with water compared to hydrogen indicate that mechanism (I), which involves hydrogen dissociation, is not responsible. The document also discusses the mechanism of hydrogenation, distinguishing it from replacement reactions, and how at low pressures, replacement rather than hydrogenation predominates. The text provides insights into the dynamics of hydrogen exchange and catalysis on metallic surfaces.
