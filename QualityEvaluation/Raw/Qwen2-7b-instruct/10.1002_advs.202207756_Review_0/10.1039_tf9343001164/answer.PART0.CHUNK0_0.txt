1. If molecules A and B exchange their hydrogens, the rate of exchange depends on the slower dissociation process between A or B.
2. Hydrogen was allowed to exchange with benzene on a platinum or nickel surface and then brought into contact with water and benzene.
3. At lower temperatures, the reactants form Gm.
4. The results for hydrogen exchange between water and ethylene are detailed in Table 11.
5. The reaction with ethylene was incomplete at 80°C after seven hours of contact and reached equilibrium in twenty-seven hours.
6. The rate of hydrogen exchange between benzene and water is approximately 105 times slower than with hydrogen gas on nickel.
7. The general conclusions from these measurements are stated.
8. There is no indication that water molecules affect the adsorption equilibrium or dissociation of hydrocarbons.
9. The smaller of the dissociation velocities must be less than the measured rate of interchange.
10. The experiments demonstrate that atomic exchange between benzene and hydrogen, and between ethylene and hydrogen, occurs according to mechanism II, not I.

3. 在较低温度下，反应物形成Gm。
4. 水与乙烷之间的氢交换结果详细列在表11中。
5. 在80°C下，与乙烷接触七小时后，反应未完成，平衡在二十七小时后达到。
6. 苯与水之间的氢交换速率大约是镍上氢气的105倍慢。
7. 这些测量得出的一般结论被陈述。
8. 没有迹象表明水分子影响吸附平衡或这些烃的解离。
