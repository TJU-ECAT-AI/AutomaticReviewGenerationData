[1] "The global consumption of propylene reached 90 million tons in 2015 and its market is still growing."
[2] "Propylene is a key building block in the synthesis of a large number of chemicals such as poly(propylene), acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide."
[3] "Owing to the importance of this approach to propylene synthesis, continuing efforts have focused on new catalyst development, with an eye towards lower-cost catalysts that might provide improved performance."
[4] "Several reviews provide a detailed discussion of ODH routes for light-olefin synthesis."
[5] "This approach is an endothermic pathway with equilibrium limitations. Hence, these reactions are often performed under high-temperature (i.e., >450°C) and low-pressure conditions (i.e., atmospheric) to obtain a relatively high yield of propylene."
[6] "However, a key problem with this approach is combustion of the hydrocarbons."
[7] "For In2O3 catalysts, a metallic indium phase has been proposed as the active site, with evidence of an induction period at the beginning of the reaction suggested to be associated with indium reduction."
[8] "Overall, the nature of the active site(s) of GroupIIIA metal oxides is still not fully understood, and it may depend on the metal oxide composition and operating conditions."
[9] "The system shows superior performance compared to the binary mixture (In2O3Ga2O3, or In2O3Al2O3), in terms of stability and C3H6 selectivity."

1. The increasing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, including debates about active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by elucidating the role of active sites and their dependence on metal oxide composition and operating conditions.
