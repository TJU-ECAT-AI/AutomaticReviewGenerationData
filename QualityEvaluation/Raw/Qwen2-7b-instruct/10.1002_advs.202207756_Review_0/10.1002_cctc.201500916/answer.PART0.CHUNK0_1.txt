The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH is now a key focus for increasing propylene supply to meet market needs. Research on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has revealed evolving understandings. Early studies debated the active Ga species, but recent findings have provided insights into the nature of these catalysts and their active sites. The current work suggests that an optimal In/Ga ratio exists, leading to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability in these catalysts.
