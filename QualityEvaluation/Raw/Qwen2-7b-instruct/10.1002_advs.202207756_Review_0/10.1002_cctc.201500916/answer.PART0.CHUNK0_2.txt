[1] "The global consumption of propylene reached 90million tons in 2015 and its market is still growing."
[2] "Propylene is a key building block in the synthesis of a large number of chemicals such as poly(propylene), acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide."
[3] "Owing to the importance of this approach to propylene synthesis, continuing efforts have focused on new catalyst development, with an eye towards lower-cost catalysts that might provide improved performance."
[4] "There are two well-known commercial processes applied in industry, namely the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus and the Oleflex process from UOP."
[5] "However, both of the above-mentioned processes suffer from rapid catalyst deactivation owing to coke formation and deposition on active sites."
[6] "This initial study of this family of mixed oxides suggests that an ideal In/Ga ratio may exist whereby catalyst properties may be optimized."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the search for catalysts that can efficiently convert propane to propylene with high selectivity and stability. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through research that has attempted to identify the active Ga species involved in the reaction mechanism. These catalysts are known for their ability to promote dehydrogenation reactions, but the exact nature of the active Ga species has been a subject of debate. Recent findings have contributed to our current knowledge by elucidating the structure and reactivity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, suggesting that an optimal ratio of Ga to other components might exist for achieving the best catalytic performance. This research not only advances the field of PDH but also paves the way for developing more efficient and cost-effective catalysts for propylene synthesis.
