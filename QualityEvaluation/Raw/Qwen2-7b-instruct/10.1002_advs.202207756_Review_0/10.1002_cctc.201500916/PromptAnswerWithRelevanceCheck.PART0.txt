[1] "The global consumption of propylene reached 90million tons in 2015 and its market is still growing."
[2] "With the influx of new supplies of light gases in North America owing to hydraulic fracturing and because catalytic dehydrogenation has been demonstrated to be an effective method to produce unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons on a commercial scale, catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is attracting significant attention as a means to fill the supply-demand gap."
[3] "Among the means of propylene production from propane, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been widely studied because of its thermodynamically favorable pathway."
[4] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation has been widely investigated and is more commercially successful."
[5] "However, a key problem with this approach is combustion of the hydrocarbons."
[6] "For In2O3 catalysts, a metallic indium phase has been proposed as the active site, with evidence of an induction period at the beginning of the reaction suggested to be associated with indium reduction."
[7] "Overall, the nature of the active site(s) of GroupIIIA metal oxides is still not fully understood, and it may depend on the metal oxide composition and operating conditions."
[8] "InGaAl mixed oxides showed promising performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability."
[9] "The best catalytic performance was associated with the IGA5-15-80 catalyst, giving approximately 86% initial C3H6 selectivity at approximately 17% conversion."
[10] "Regeneration tests show that removal of surface coke and oxidizing reduced indium species to the In2O3 state helps to regain the initial activity, whereas reducing the In2O3 domains to In0 does not improve the performance."
[11] "Raman analysis of carbonaceous species deposited on the catalyst surface indicates catalysts with more gallium give more graphitic carbon species, which is associated with a higher level of C3H6 selectivity than catalysts with more disordered coke."
[12] "However, higher gallium loading also causes a larger amount of coke formation, which leads to faster deactivation."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is because catalytic PDH is an effective method for producing unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation is more commercially successful than oxidative dehydrogenation, but both methods face challenges such as combustion of hydrocarbons. The nature of the active sites in GroupIIIA metal oxides, such as In2O3, is not fully understood and can depend on the oxide composition and operating conditions. Recent studies have explored ternary InGaAl mixed oxides as catalysts for PDH, which have shown promising performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability. The IGA5-15-80 catalyst was found to be the most effective, providing high C3H6 selectivity and conversion rates. The regeneration tests revealed that removing surface coke and oxidizing reduced indium species to In2O3 can regain the initial activity, whereas reducing In2O3 domains to In0 does not improve performance. The Raman analysis indicated that catalysts with more gallium give more graphitic carbon species, which correlates with higher C3H6 selectivity. However, higher gallium loading also causes more coke formation, leading to faster deactivation.

对于丙烯不断增长的需求，已经推动了新生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。因为催化PDH是生产不饱和短链烃的有效方法。非氧化性脱氢比氧化性脱氢在商业上更成功，但两种方法都面临着燃烧烃类的问题。组IIIA金属氧化物（如In2O3）中的活性位点的性质尚未完全了解，并且可能取决于氧化物组成和操作条件。最近的研究探索了InGaAl三元混合氧化物作为PDH催化剂，这些催化剂在活性、选择性和稳定性方面表现出前景。IGA5-15-80催化剂被发现是最有效的，提供了高C3H6选择性和转化率。再生试验显示，通过去除表面焦炭并氧化还原了的铟物种为In2O3可以恢复初始活性，而将In2O3域减少到In0不会改善性能。拉曼分析表明，含有更多镓的催化剂产生更多的石墨碳物种，这与更高的C3H6选择性相关。然而，更高的镓负载也导致更多焦炭形成，导致更快的失活。

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the search for catalysts that can efficiently convert propane to propylene with high selectivity and stability. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through research that has attempted to identify the active Ga species involved in the reaction mechanism. These catalysts are known for their ability to promote dehydrogenation reactions, but the exact nature of the active Ga species has been a subject of debate. Recent findings have contributed to our current knowledge by elucidating the structure and reactivity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, suggesting that an optimal ratio of Ga to other components might exist for achieving the best catalytic performance. This research not only advances the field of PDH but also paves the way for developing more efficient and cost-effective catalysts for propylene synthesis.

1. The demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to meet the increasing market needs. Research on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, focusing on understanding the active Ga species and their roles in the catalytic process. Recent studies have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by identifying the most effective compositions and conditions for optimal performance.

2. The composition of the ternary mixed metal oxides plays a crucial role in determining their catalytic properties. The best-performing catalyst contains In, Ga, and Al in a ratio of 5:15:80, offering a high conversion rate of 17% and excellent C3H6 selectivity of approximately 86%. This catalyst also demonstrates high initial activity, with rates of 4.6mmolh1gcat1 and 24.1μmolh1m2.

3. Gallium (Ga) loading influences both the catalytic activity and stability of the mixed metal oxides. Higher Ga content leads to the formation of more graphitic carbon species on the catalyst surface, which correlates with higher C3H6 selectivity. However, this also results in a larger amount of coke formation, accelerating the deactivation rate of the catalyst.
