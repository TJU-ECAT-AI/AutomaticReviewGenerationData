The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is because catalytic PDH is an effective method for producing unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation is more commercially successful than oxidative dehydrogenation, but both methods face challenges such as combustion of hydrocarbons. The nature of the active sites in GroupIIIA metal oxides, such as In2O3, is not fully understood and can depend on the oxide composition and operating conditions. Recent studies have explored ternary InGaAl mixed oxides as catalysts for PDH, which have shown promising performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability. The IGA5-15-80 catalyst was found to be the most effective, providing high C3H6 selectivity and conversion rates. The regeneration tests revealed that removing surface coke and oxidizing reduced indium species to In2O3 can regain the initial activity, whereas reducing In2O3 domains to In0 does not improve performance. The Raman analysis indicated that catalysts with more gallium give more graphitic carbon species, which correlates with higher C3H6 selectivity. However, higher gallium loading also causes more coke formation, leading to faster deactivation.

对于丙烯不断增长的需求，已经推动了新生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。因为催化PDH是生产不饱和短链烃的有效方法。非氧化性脱氢比氧化性脱氢在商业上更成功，但两种方法都面临着燃烧烃类的问题。组IIIA金属氧化物（如In2O3）中的活性位点的性质尚未完全了解，并且可能取决于氧化物组成和操作条件。最近的研究探索了InGaAl三元混合氧化物作为PDH催化剂，这些催化剂在活性、选择性和稳定性方面表现出前景。IGA5-15-80催化剂被发现是最有效的，提供了高C3H6选择性和转化率。再生试验显示，通过去除表面焦炭并氧化还原了的铟物种为In2O3可以恢复初始活性，而将In2O3域减少到In0不会改善性能。拉曼分析表明，含有更多镓的催化剂产生更多的石墨碳物种，这与更高的C3H6选择性相关。然而，更高的镓负载也导致更多焦炭形成，导致更快的失活。
