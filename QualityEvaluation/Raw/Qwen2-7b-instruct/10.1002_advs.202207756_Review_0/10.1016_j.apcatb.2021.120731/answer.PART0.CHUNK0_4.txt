1. The growing demand for propylene has led to an increase in market prices and spurred industrial development. Efforts have been made to convert propane into propylene, driven by the large-scale production of propane through shale-gas extraction. Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) due to their desirable performance in the Oleflex process, offering longer reaction lifetimes and being more environmentally friendly.

2. The PDH process is characterized by high endothermicity, requiring high reaction temperatures. Research aims to achieve good catalytic performance at lower temperatures, addressing the challenge of thermal stability and energy consumption reduction.

3. Lu et al. found that the surface of Pd/Al2O3 catalysts can be effectively regulated by depositing controllable Al2O3 overcoatings. This method improves the anti-sintering ability of Pd particles and weakens the adsorption affinity of product molecules on Pd species due to the confinement effect of Al2O3 atomic layers.

4. The enhanced stability of the catalyst is attributed to the stable Pt active sites anchored by Ga clusters and silica layers on the catalyst surface. This method demonstrates a new approach to improving the thermal stability of catalysts for alkane catalytic conversion at lower temperatures.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，丙烯市场价格上涨，并推动了工业发展。人们致力于通过页岩气提取大规模生产丙烷来将丙烷转化为丙烯。到目前为止，铂基催化剂广泛应用于丙烷直接脱氢（PDH），在Oleflex过程中表现出较长的反应寿命和更环保的特点。

2. PDH过程以高吸热性为特征，需要高温条件。研究目标是实现低温下的良好催化性能，以解决热稳定性挑战并降低能耗。

3. 卢等人发现，可以通过沉积可控的Al2O3过涂层来调节Pd/Al2O3催化剂表面。这种方法提高了Pd颗粒的抗聚集能力，并由于Al2O3原子层的限制效应而减弱了产物分子在Pd物种上的吸附亲和力。

4. 催化剂增强的稳定性归因于稳定Pt活性位点由Ga簇和催化剂表面的二氧化硅层锚定。这种方法探索了在较低温度下进行烷烃催化转换的新方法，并展示了提高催化剂热稳定性的新途径。
