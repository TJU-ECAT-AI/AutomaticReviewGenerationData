[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for industrial production to many chemical products including polypropylene, which is an essential material to prepare non-woven fabric for personal protection equipment amid global COVID-19 [1] ,[2] ,[3] ."
[2] "Due to the increasing global demand for propylene, the market price of propylene has been rising accompanied with the booming trend of industrial development [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ."
[3] "Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to the transformation of propane into propylene stimulated by the large scale production of propane by the development of shale-gas extraction [9] ."
[4] "However, the wider application is still hampered since the usage of noble metal and catalyst deactivation."
[5] "In this work, we report a strategy to decrease the Pt loading amount to only 0.1 wt% for obtaining a stable catalyst via silica coating for high PDH activity at a temperature as low as of 450 C."
[6] "The as-prepared 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst shows outstanding catalytic activity (propylene productivity rate 0.5 mol/gcat.·h) close to its equilibrium conversion (24.5%) with much better stability (deactivation constant: 0.007 h1) at 450 C."
[7] "The interface between catalyst and silica coating changes the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) to immobilize the Ga oxide clusters, further tightly anchoring the Pt catalytic sites for PDH process."
[8] "Moreover, the electronic state of Pt is also influenced by the silica coating layers."
[9] "The Ga was introduced to immobilize the Pt active sites in the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst as a promoter."

The growing demand for propylene has led to advancements in the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to leverage the abundance of propane derived from shale-gas extraction. This shift aims to reduce the reliance on noble metals and mitigate catalyst deactivation issues. In this context, Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH have been explored, focusing on improving the dispersion and electronic properties of Pt sites to achieve high activity and stability at lower temperatures. Research has indicated that the presence of Al-O-Ga sites might facilitate the heterolysis of C-H bonds, contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance of these catalysts.
