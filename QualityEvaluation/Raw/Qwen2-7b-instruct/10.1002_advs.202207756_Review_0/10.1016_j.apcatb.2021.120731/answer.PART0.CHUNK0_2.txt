<p>Due to the increasing global demand for propylene, the market price of propylene has been rising accompanied with the booming trend of industrial development.</p>
<p>Many efforts have been devoted to the transformation of propane into propylene stimulated by the large scale production of propane by the development of shale-gas extraction.</p>
<p>However, the wider application is still hampered since the usage of noble metal and catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>To date, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively used as industrial catalysts for propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) with a desirable performance in Oleflex process for its longer reaction lifetime and more environmental friendly.</p>
<p>The PDH process is featured by its high endothermicity (Hθ298 = 124.3 kJ mol1).</p>
<p>The introduction of co-catalyst species such as Ga could regulate the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between metal and oxide support, and further help to maintain the dispersion of Pt species.</p>
<p>This work explores alkane catalytic conversion at lower temperature and demonstrates a new method to improve thermal stability of catalyst.</p>
<p>Controlled experiment shows that γ-Al2O3 support is not active for the PDH reaction under the same experimental condition.</p>
<p>In comparison, PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst shows notably enhanced catalytic performance with 17.4% initial propane conversion (Fig. 4), which is 1.7 times higher than that of Pt/Al2O3 catalyst under identical conditions.</p>
<p>Although the initial activity of the catalyst has been greatly improved over PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst, the stability of the catalyst is still poor due to the unstable Pt active sites.</p>

The growing demand for propylene has led to an increase in its market price and a surge in industrial development. Efforts have been made to convert propane into propylene, driven by the widespread use of shale gas. However, the application of noble metal catalysts and their deactivation hinder its broader use. Platinum-based catalysts are widely used in industrial processes, offering desirable performance in the Oleflex process due to their longer reaction lifetime and environmental friendliness. The PDH process is characterized by high endothermicity. The addition of co-catalysts like gallium can modulate the strong metal-support interaction, maintaining the dispersion of platinum species. This study introduces a new approach to enhance catalyst stability at lower temperatures. Contrary to γ-Al2O3, the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits significantly improved catalytic activity, achieving 17.4% initial propane conversion, which is 1.7 times higher than that of Pt/Al2O3 under identical conditions. Despite the enhanced activity, the catalyst's stability remains poor due to unstable platinum sites.

对于丙烯的日益增长的需求导致其市场价格上涨，并推动了工业发展的热潮。人们已经致力于通过大规模生产页岩气来刺激丙烷转化为丙烯。然而，由于使用贵金属和催化剂失效的问题，其广泛应用仍然受到阻碍。到目前为止，铂基催化剂已经被广泛用作工业催化剂进行丙烷直接脱氢（PDH），在Oleflex过程中表现出更长的反应寿命和更环保的性能。PDH过程以其高吸热性（Hθ298 = 124.3 kJ mol1）为特征。添加如镓这样的共催化剂可以调节金属与氧化物支持之间的强金属-支撑相互作用，进一步帮助维持铂物种的分散。本研究探索了在较低温度下进行烷烃催化转化的新方法，并展示了提高催化剂稳定性的新途径。与γ-Al2O3相比，PtGa/Al2O3催化剂表现出显著增强的催化活性，初始丙烷转化率为17.4%，是相同条件下Pt/Al2O3的1.7倍。尽管催化剂的活性得到了显著提高，但由于不稳定铂活性位点，催化剂的稳定性仍然较差。
