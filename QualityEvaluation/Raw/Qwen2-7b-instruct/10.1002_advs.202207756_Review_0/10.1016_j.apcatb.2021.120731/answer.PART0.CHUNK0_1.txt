1. The growing demand for propylene has led to an increase in market prices and spurred industrial development. Efforts have been made to transform propane into propylene using shale gas extraction. Pt-based catalysts have been widely used in the Oleflex process due to their performance and environmental benefits, although their wider use is limited by the high cost of noble metals and catalyst deactivation issues.

2. The PDH process is characterized by high endothermicity, requiring high temperatures (550-700°C). Achieving good catalytic performance at lower temperatures is a significant emerging challenge due to thermodynamic equilibrium limitations.

3. Various catalysts with different silica coatings have been synthesized by introducing controlled amounts of silica onto the catalyst surfaces. The 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated the best stability and catalytic activity for PDH at 450°C.

4. The structure and performance relationship of the catalysts have been comprehensively investigated using various analytical techniques such as ICP-OES, BET, HAADF-STEM, AC-TEM, XRD, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, XPS, DRIFTS-CO, Raman spectroscopy, TGA, and TG-DSC.

1. 对丙烯的巨大需求导致了丙烯市场价格的上涨和工业发展的蓬勃趋势。为了利用页岩气的大规模生产，人们致力于将丙烷转化为丙烯。到目前为止，铂基催化剂在丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）过程中被广泛用作工业催化剂，并在Oleflex工艺中表现出良好的性能，因为它具有更长的反应寿命和更环保的特点。然而，由于贵金属的使用和催化剂失活问题，其更广泛的使用仍然受到限制。

2.PDH过程以其高热力学势（Hθ298 = 124.3 kJ mol1）为特征。考虑到PDH的热力学平衡随温度变化的功能，实现低温下的良好催化性能成为一项新兴的重要挑战。

3. 各种不同的催化剂通过向催化剂表面引入控制的硅酸盐量进行了合成。在2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3催化剂上显示出了PDH在450°C时最佳的稳定性和催化活性。

4. 使用各种分析技术，如ICP-OES、BET、HAADF-STEM、AC-TEM、XRD、H2-TPR、NH3-TPD、XPS、DRIFTS-CO、拉曼光谱、TGA和TG-DSC，全面研究了催化剂的结构和性能关系。
