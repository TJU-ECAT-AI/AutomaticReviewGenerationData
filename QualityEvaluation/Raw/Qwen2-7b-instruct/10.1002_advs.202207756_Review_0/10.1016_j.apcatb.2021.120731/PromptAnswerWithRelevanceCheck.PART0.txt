The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), aiming to reduce energy consumption and inhibit coking and sintering. The use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with the ongoing debate about active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by demonstrating that Ga can regulate the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between metal and oxide support, helping to maintain the dispersion of Pt species. This, in turn, improves the thermal stability of the catalyst and enhances its resistance to coke formation. The PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst coated with silica overlayer exhibits excellent catalytic performance and stability for PDH at low temperatures, specifically at 450°C. The enhanced stability is attributed to the anchoring of stable Pt active sites by Ga clusters and silica layers on the catalyst surface. Contrary to the active role of Ga, γ-Al2O3 support alone is inactive for the PDH reaction under similar conditions. The PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst shows notably enhanced catalytic performance with 17.4% initial propane conversion, which is 1.7 times higher than that of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst under identical conditions. However, the stability of the catalyst remains poor due to unstable Pt active sites. The presence of Al-O-Ga sites is reported to promote heterolysis C-H bond activation, contributing to the effectiveness of these catalysts in PDH processes.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新型生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），旨在降低能源消耗并抑制结焦和聚集。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的使用已经发展，并且关于活性Ga物种的争论持续进行。最近的研究发现为这些催化剂的当前知识做出了贡献，通过证明Ga可以调节金属与氧化物支持之间的强金属-支持相互作用（SMSI），帮助维持铂物种的分散性。这进一步提高了催化剂的热稳定性，并增强了其抗结焦性能。铂Ga/Al2O3催化剂涂覆有二氧化硅过膜层，表现出PDH在低温下的出色催化性能和稳定性，具体为450°C。增强的稳定性归因于由Ga簇和催化剂表面的二氧化硅层锚定的稳定铂活性位点。与Ga的积极作用相反，γ-Al2O3支持本身在相似条件下对PDH反应无效。铂Ga/Al2O3催化剂显示出显著增强的催化性能，初始丙烷转化率为17.4%，是相同条件下铂/Al2O3催化剂的1.7倍。然而，催化剂的稳定性仍然不佳，由于不稳定铂活性位点。据报道，Al-O-Ga位点的存在促进了C-H键的异裂解，这有助于这些催化剂在PDH过程中的有效性。

The growing demand for propylene has led to an increase in its market price and a surge in industrial development. Efforts have been made to convert propane into propylene, driven by the widespread use of shale gas. However, the application of noble metal catalysts and their deactivation hinder its broader use. Platinum-based catalysts are widely used in industrial processes, offering desirable performance in the Oleflex process due to their longer reaction lifetime and environmental friendliness. The PDH process is characterized by high endothermicity. The addition of co-catalysts like gallium can modulate the strong metal-support interaction, maintaining the dispersion of platinum species. This study introduces a new approach to enhance catalyst stability at lower temperatures. Contrary to γ-Al2O3, the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits significantly improved catalytic activity, achieving 17.4% initial propane conversion, which is 1.7 times higher than that of Pt/Al2O3 under identical conditions. Despite the enhanced activity, the catalyst's stability remains poor due to unstable platinum sites.
