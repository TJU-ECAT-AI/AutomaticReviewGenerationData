The increasing demand for propylene has led to the development of more efficient and sustainable production methods, with propane dehydrogenation (PDH) being a promising approach. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been widely investigated for PDH, and there is an ongoing discussion about the active Ga species involved. Recent studies have contributed to a better understanding of the mechanism of action of these catalysts.
