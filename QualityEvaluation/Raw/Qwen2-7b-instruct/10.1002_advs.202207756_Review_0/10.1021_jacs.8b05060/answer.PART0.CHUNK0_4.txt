1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), leading to the exploration of more efficient and selective catalysts. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, including the ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by elucidating their structure, activity, and stability.
