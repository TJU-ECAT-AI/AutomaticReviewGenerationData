1. The increasing demand for propylene has prompted the development of new production techniques, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Recent investigations have concentrated on non-noble-metal intermetallic compound catalysts for PDH. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been intensively studied due to their potential for PDH. There remains an ongoing discussion about the active Ga species, with recent research enhancing our comprehension of these catalysts.
