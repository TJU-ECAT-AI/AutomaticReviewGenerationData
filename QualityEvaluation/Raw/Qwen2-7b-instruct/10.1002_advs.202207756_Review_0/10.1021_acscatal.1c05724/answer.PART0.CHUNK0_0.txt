1. The increasing demand for propylene has prompted the development of new production techniques, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Research on gallium (Ga)-laden H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has centered on the function of Ga species. There is a persistent discussion concerning the active Ga species involved in these catalysts. Recent discoveries have enhanced our comprehension of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH processes.
