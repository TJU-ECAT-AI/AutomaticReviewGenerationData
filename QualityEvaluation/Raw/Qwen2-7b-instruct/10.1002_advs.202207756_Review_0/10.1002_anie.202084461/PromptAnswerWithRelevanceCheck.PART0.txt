The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process converts propane into propylene, which is essential for the production of various chemical products such as polymers, solvents, and detergents. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, addressing the ongoing debate about the active Ga species involved in the reaction. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, revealing insights into their structure, activity, and stability.
