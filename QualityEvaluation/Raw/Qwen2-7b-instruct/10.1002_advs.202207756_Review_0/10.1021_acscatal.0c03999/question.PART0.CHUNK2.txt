On iron containing ZSM-5, studies report that FeOAl species are likely active sites for N2O-mediated ODHP. (19,35,36) Grunert et al. have used FT-IR analysis paired with NO adsorption to characterize the abundant Fe species (Figure 18A) and catalytic evaluation of Fe-ZSM-5 (Figure 18) to support such hypothesis. (36) Of note, FT-IR spectroscopy, along with NO adsorption, is commonly used to characterize active sites for Fe-containing catalysts. For samples without calcination (Fe-MFI-24G), NO adsorption results in a broad band at 1850 cm1, indicating mononitrosyl on ferrous ions in the straight channels of ZSM-5. When samples are calcined at high temperatures, two strong bands at 1875 and 1890 cm1 are observed in the IR spectra. The band at 1875 cm1 corresponds to the mononitrosyl species on extra-framework Fe2+OAl sites; the other band at 1890 cm1 is assigned to the mononitrosyl species on isolated ferrous ions located on γ sites of the ZSM-5 structure. The band observed at 1810 cm1 is assigned to poly nitrosyl species on ferrous ion sites. As initial adsorption of NO on Fe-MFI-1173 results in the emergence of a band at 1875 cm1, it is hypothesized that both bands at 1810 and 1875 cm1 come from the same ferrous species, namely isolated extra-framework Fe2+OAl species. Clearly, calcining Fe-MFI-24G samples leads to the transformation of iron sites from isolated ions to isolated extra-framework FeOAl species. Figure 18B shows the C3H6 yield during N2O-mediated ODHP for samples calcined at different temperatures. An increase in C3H6 yield is observed as the calcination temperature rises from 600 C (Fe-MFI-24G-873) to 800 C (Fe-MFI-24G-1073), while the samples calcined at 800 (Fe-MFI-24G-1073) and 900 C (Fe-MFI-24G-1173) show similar highest C3H6 yields between 27% and 30%. On the basis of this correlation between exposed active iron sites and the observed catalytic performance, it is proposed that the isolated FeOAl site is the active center responsible for N2O-mediated ODHP reaction. (19,35,36) Figure 18 Figure 18. (A) FT-IR spectra of NO adsorption on Fe-MFI-24G samples calcined at different temperatures. (Numbers at the end show calcination temperatures in Kelvin.)

Further analyses with in situ DRIFTS and TPD reveal that reoxidation of the Fe2+OAl site with N2O forms an O species, which is thermally stable and highly selective in the target reaction. (19,35,36) On the basis of such observations, the following mechanism is proposed:(4-3) (4-4) (4-5) (4-6) (4-7) (4-8) In the proposed mechanism, the Fe3+Fe2+ cycle operates on the highly isolated extra-framework FeOAl site to decompose N2O to N2 and O2 (eq 4-3-eq 4-6) and forms Fe3+O species. (208210) Since the direct reaction of C3H8 and gaseous O2 produces COx as the main products, it is hypothesized that C3H8 reacts with the deposited O species to produce C3H6 with a high selectivity (eq 4-7). The C3H6 may further react with adsorbed O to form undesired COx species, as depicted in eq 4-8.
Despite its high initial catalytic performance, a major drawback of iron-containing zeolites is deactivation by coke, which causes a rapid decrease in C3H6 yield. (180183) A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled with GC analysis (Figure 19) performed on MFI, BEA, and silicate catalysts is used to illustrate how zeolite catalysts deactivates over time during ODHP reaction. (182) Of note, c- indicates calcined only, and ex- indicates steam-activated samples after calcination; As presented in Figure 19, most catalysts show their highest C3H6 yields within the first few minutes on stream, and then deactivate rapidly within the first 20 min on stream. An excellent correlation between the increase in coke formation and decrease in C3H6 yield is observed, and based on such correlation it is hypothesized that coke formation is responsible for deactivation of the catalysts during the reaction. (182,183) Among the different zeolites tested, steam activated Fe-ZSM-5, with abundant extra-framework iron sites, presents the highest resistance to deactivation, and shows a C3H6 yield above 20% up to 75 min on stream. Even after 400 min on stream, it is able to maintain a C3H6 yield of 8%, unlike other catalysts that deactivate almost completely. It is hypothesized that this elevated performance likely originates from the absence of large cages in ZSM-5. Since the size of the channel and intersections are similar, coke precursors are not trapped in intersections and are hypothesized to more effectively diffuse out. On the other hand, BEA zeolites have large cavities with relatively small apertures in the framework. Such cavities may trap bulky organics, completely blocking the access to active sites and causing rapid deactivation. While the amount of coke formation and the C3H6 yield usually display a nice correlation, for ex-Fe-ZSM-5 and ex-H-ZSM-5, this is not the case. While the coke content is 4 to 5 times higher for ex-Fe-ZSM-5 than ex-H-ZSM-5, similar C3H6 yields are obtained after 400 min on stream. On the basis of this observation, Gallardo-Llamas and co-workers hypothesize that the location of the coke is another important factor that affects the deactivation process. (182,183) Such a hypothesis is also supported by the work of Prez-Ramrez et al., in which gallium-containing MFI zeolites exhibit higher coke formation than the corresponding aluminum-containing zeolite, yet still show a higher C3H6 yield after 120 min on stream for the ODHP reaction. (196) While such deactivated zeolite catalysts can be regenerated by treatment with air at elevated temperatures, it is reported that regenerated catalysts tend to deactivate much faster than the fresh ones, showing a sharp decrease in catalytic activity within a few minutes on stream. (180,183,196) Better understanding of catalyst deactivation and improvement of catalyst stability still remain as challenge for efficient utilization of N2O for ODHP reactions.

There have only been a few reports where other metal-containing MFI catalysts such as cobalt or manganese have been tested for N2OODHP. (198,211) While it is reported that both cobalt- and manganese-containing ZSM-5 catalysts are less active in N2OODHP than iron-containing ZSM-5, there are insufficient data to definitively draw assertion. Furthermore, stability or deactivation studies using N2OODHP on such catalysts are still very scarce, thereby making it difficult to evaluate their potential for this reaction at this stage.
4.2.2. Effect of Zeolite Topology
There have been reports deploying other zeolite frameworks for the N2OODHP reaction as well, including MOR, FAU, and BEA. (18,36,182,200,201,204,212) However, the catalytic performance of most of these frameworks is inferior to the MFI zeolites, not only possessing lower C3H6 yield but also fast deactivation. FAU and BEA zeolites are the frameworks that show relatively better performance and are close to the MFI-based catalysts, with their highest C3H6 yields between 7% and 17%. (36,204) However, the BEA zeolites suffer from rapid deactivation. (182,200) Sobalik and co-workers find that C3H6 yield decreases to 25% of its initial yield for iron-containing BEA within 2 h on stream. (201) Prez-Ramrez et al. also report that a lab-synthesized Fe-BEA deactivates rapidly, showing a decrease by 90% of its initial yield within the first hour of reaction. (182) MOR or FER frameworks are much less active in the N2OODHP reaction, exhibiting very low C3H6 yields (i.e., <2%). (36,204) A summary of the catalytic performance of different zeolite catalysts is shown in Table 12. While Fe-ZSM-5 has been extensively studied for this reaction because of its superior performance, studies of other frameworks are still limited. More efforts are needed to explore the effect of other framework topologies on catalytic performance.Table 12.

5. Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane with Sulfur-/Halogen-Containing Compounds
Alternate oxidants, such as sulfur or halogen-based oxidants, have shown promising results to selectively dehydrogenate propane to propylene. For example, co-feeding sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can improve propylene yield. Using SO2 as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize SO2, which is an acidic gas. However, the SO2ODHP pathway results in low propylene because of the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts. Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2. (213) Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP. (213) In the future, developing a structureactivity relationship will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field.
Selective activation of C3H8 can also be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways, such as (i) dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), (ii) oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), (iii) propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and (iv) molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2). Specifically, oxychlorination chemistry over CeO2, EuOX, and metal phosphate-based, such as CrPO4, catalysts have shown good selectivity (up to 95%) and conversion (up to 70% at 500 C) in comparison to conventional ODHP. (4850) Still, the olefin selectivity is limited because of the formation of COx and polyhalogenation products. Continuous efforts have been put forth to obtain an optimal propane oxyhalogenation catalyst, which should exhibit moderate redox properties so that it enables alkane activation but does not favor alkane overoxidation, combustion, and evolution of Cl2, while possessing fast dehydrochlorination kinetics.
5.1. Propane Dehydrogenation in the Presence of Sulfur-Based Feed
Thermal (or steam) cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of hydrocarbons are the most important processes in the production of olefins, the building blocks of the chemical industry. To improve selectivity (i.e., reduce hydrogenolysis or coke formation), sulfur-based additives, such as dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and H2S, are often added as a dilute co-feed during the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons. (214216) The role of sulfur as a promoter or inhibitor is well studied in the literature for hydrogenation reactions. (217219) In particular, sulfur has been found to suppress the cracking of organic molecules on metal catalysts. Assuming the ability of sulfur to suppress the cracking reactivity is stronger than its ability to poison the dehydrogenation reactivity of metallic (or metal oxide) catalysts (Fe, Ni, Cu, Co, Zn Mn, Mo), sulfur compounds can be good promoters for enhancing the dehydrogenation performance. (220222) Typically, the effect of sulfur on the catalytic propane dehydrogenation has been studied in one of the following categories (Figure 20), namely, (i) in situ catalyst sulfidation (in the presence of H2S) but in the absence of O2, (ii) mixture of H2S + O2 or (iii) SO2, and (iv) S2. (39,40,44,220234) Figure 20 Figure 20. Various routes investigated in the past for propane conversion to propylene, including homogeneous reactions (red box) and catalyst-assisted reactions (brown). Reaction conditions are shown for each route. Typically, reaction studies have been conducted at 1 atm.
5.1.1. H2S-Catalyzed DHP/ODHP
Several patents highlight the merits of adding H2S during the uncatalyzed propane dehydrogenation. (235,236) For example, the addition of H2S in the reactant stream doubles the C3H6 yield to 31% at 815 C. (235) Further, Resasco et al. demonstrate that the Ni/Al2O3, treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), exhibits improved selectivity and decreased coke formation during isobutane dehydrogenation. (237) Similarly, the selectivity of C3H6 on Pt/MgAl2O4 is significantly improved from 47% to 95% without changing its activity when H2S (425 ppm) is co-fed, thus establishing a promoting effect. (238) On the basis of CO-chemisorption and Bader charge analysis, Wang et al. explain that the improved selectivity in the presence of H2S is due to the electron transfer from adsorbed sulfur species to Pt atoms, thereby resulting in weaker PtC3H6 interactions. (239) Of note, H2S can inhibit the conversion and adversely affect the selectivity of propylene at higher concentrations (about 850 ppm) over Pt/Al2O3 underlining the dual role of H2S as an inhibitor and promoter depending on H2S concentration in the feed. (238) Subsequently, Shan et al. show that the exposure of metal oxides to sulfur feed can lead to the formation of corresponding metal sulfides (or surface sulfur species) and reported improved isobutane dehydrogenation yield, suggesting that the sulfur can play a key role in modifying the active phase of the catalyst. (220222) The authors argued that higher selectivity is due to the preferential activation of CH bonds over CC bonds on metalsulfur ensembles, coupled with facile olefin desorption, thus, effectively reducing the possibility of side reactions and coke generation. (220222) In summary, the resulting metal sulfides formed due to exposure to H2S, show improved dehydrogenation performance over their parent metals or metal oxides, presenting a unique opportunity to design new catalysts with enhanced oxidative or nonoxidative dehydrogenation capability with improved selectivity and stability. (220223) Sulfur compounds, such as S2 and H2S, have been used as cocatalysts to reduce overoxidation of alkanes and olefins during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions (ODH). (40,42,44,240) Clark et al. have investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using γ-Al2O3 and 13% V/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of H2S + O2 at short residence times (t = 5 ms) and achieved a C3H6 yield of 30.4% at 700 C. (40) The C3H6 selectivity increases at residence times below 0.5 s, indicating that shorter residence times are required to suppress the cracking reaction. (40) Gasper et al. demonstrate that C3H6 yields of up to 60% can be obtained for H2S-promoted ODH over LiCl/KCl/MnCl2 molten salt at 705 C. (39) As postulated, sulfur in the diatomic state (active species) may abstract H species from an alkane. Of particular note is that significantly higher C3H6 yield (i.e., 60%) is evident in the presence of molten salt for H2S-assisted ODH than is obtained with the catalyst (i.e., 30%) or in gas-phase reactions (i.e., 20%) at 700 C. (39,40,44) The addition of gaseous sulfur, either S2/COS/SO2/H2S or combinations of sulfur compounds over Al2O3, (Co, Mo, Fe, W, Ni-mono or bimetallic) metals supported either on Al2O3 or SiO2 demonstrates excellent performance (up to 98% C3H8 conversion, C3H6 selectivity = 95%, and CS2 selectivity = 1%) in the temperature range of 400750 C, which is summarized in Table 13. (42,229233) In these studies, the catalyst precursor, which may be metal oxides/metal sulfides/metal oxysulfides, is typically activated in the presence of one or more sulfur-containing compounds, such as S2, H2S, SO2, COS. Recently, oxidative propane dehydrogenation utilizing sulfur vapor (S2: C3H8 = 1: 0.3) as an oxidant has been investigated at 600950 C over bulk Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3 catalysts that are activated in a mixture of S2/H2S. (234) The study reveals that the C3H6 yield and selectivity improve in the presence of S2; however, the conversion (C3H8 conversion = 10% and C3H6 selectivity = 73%, at 650 C) is barely affected by the catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions. DFT calculations on the H2S-assisted gas-phase ODH reaction reveal that the in situ generated sulfur intermediate (S2) can abstract the hydrogen from the alkane, leading to the formation of olefin products (see section 6.3 for details). (44) It highlights that the sulfur is participating in the reaction as a catalyst. The formation of sulfur-based byproducts, such as CS2, 1- and 2-propyl thiol mercaptan, and sulfur (S8), is also observed in the reactor effluent. (229234) Recently, Marks and co-workers have evaluated the role of sulfur as a soft oxidant for propane dehydrogenation (S2ODHP) over transition metal oxide (ZrO2, TiO2, Cr2O3) and sulfide (PdS, MoS2) at milder reaction temperature (T = 470550 C). (213) They found that the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with lower metalsulfur bond strength, indicating a more active sulfur species. The authors proposed that CH activation (RDS) proceeds by a surface sulfur species based on first order dependence on propane. Consequently, propylene and H2S formation leads to sulfur vacancy, and gas phase S2 replenishes these sulfur vacant sites.

5.1.2. Metal Sulfate- and SO2-Assisted DHP/ODHP
The effect of sulfation has been studied via either synthesizing MeSO4 (Me = Co, Fe, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Mn) or the introduction of SO2 as an oxidant in the co-feed. In the former case, sulfate-promoted FeOx and Co/Al2O3 catalytic systems show excellent activity in C3H8 dehydrogenation accompanied by relatively better stability than the nonsulfated catalyst. (225228) The improved performance of the catalyst is attributed to the electron-withdrawing effect of sulfate species from the metal ion, as illustrated in Figure 21. The strong interaction of SO42 species with the support and Fe results in C3H8 polarization, followed by cleaving of the CH bond over the Feδ+ and Oδ pair. The loss of sulfate groups via in situ generation of SO2 or FeSx over prolonged reaction times induces coke formation and results in a loss of activity. The loss in activity with TOS has motivated Sun et al. to introduce SO2 into the reactant stream over sulfated 20% Fe/Al2O3, which results in stable performance for up to 15 h with 20% C3H6 yield at 560 C. (227) Further tests are carried out over 20% Fe anchored on different supports including ZrO2, SiO2, and γ-Al2O3. Among them, γ-Al2O3 has the best performance, which is probably due to the formation of stable sulfate species.

Additionally, propane dehydrogenation has been performed with the introduction of SO2 as an oxidant. (37,38,241245) Ashmawy has investigated the reaction of propane with SO2 over a 0.5% PdAl2O3 catalyst. (37,38) The addition of SO2 (i.e., C3H8: SO2 of 6: 1) to the co-feed increases the C3H8 conversion; however, the selectivity decreases markedly (i.e., 93.1% to 20%) with increasing SO2 partial pressure in the co-feed. As suggested, SO2 can abstract a H atom from C3H8, and the low selectivity may be caused by oxidation of C3H8 or C3H6 to form water and COx species. Adams et al. further investigate C3H8 oxidation with SO2 using a calciumnickel phosphate catalyst and reported 14% selectivity toward C3H6, along with 31% C3H8 conversion at 550 C and GHSV = 90 h1. (241) To investigate the factors behind the low C3H6 selectivity, the same group has conducted additional experiments in which ammonia is added to the C3H8 and SO2 mixture. It was hypothesized that, in the presence of ammonia, the calciumnickel phosphate catalyst would scavenge the C3H6 molecule formed under reaction conditions via the formation of isothiazole and prevents its oxidation to COx compounds. However, the selectivity barely changes with ammonia addition, indicating that the initial reaction of SO2 with C3H8 can be related to the formation of undesired combustion products (COx) rather than C3H6.
Sokolovskii et al. have investigated the role of activated carbon in selective catalytic oxidation of propane in the presence of SO2. (242) Improved C3H6 formation can be obtained over γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and Ga2O3 because of the in situ generation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) or activated coke. (243) In contrast, Fe2O3, Bi2O3, and PbO-based bulk catalysts undergo sulfidation, which leads to decreases in the C3H6 yield under similar reaction conditions (Table 13). Danilova and Ivanova have investigated the effect of pore size (textural properties) on the catalytic performance of SO2-assisted ODHP over SiO2Al2O3 catalysts at 640 C with an SO2 co-feed of 10 mol %. (244) Pores that are smaller than 10 nm lead to oxidation or coke products, whereas pores between 10 and 100 nm are optimal for C3H6 formation. Similar to Sokolovskiis observation, the accrual of OCP over silica is accompanied by the improved C3H6 yield from 3.4 to 46 mol % at 640 C with a C3H8: SO2: He ratio of 10: 10: 80 mol %. It is important to note that, because of the formation of OCP, the carbon balance is reported to vary between 60% and 100%. Danilova et al. have studied the effect of OCP accumulation (040 wt %) on catalytic performance over SiO2 via various ex situ techniques. (245) DRIFTS spectra reveal that the OCP system is composed of a polycyclic aromatic structures consisting of C, O, H, and S atoms with the spectral signature of carbonyl, carboxylic acid, and lactone groups. However, the exact nature of the active sites remain elusive because of the lack of structureactivity relationship and characterization studies using state-of-the-art, in situ/operando techniques. (242245)
5.2. Halogen-Assisted Dehydrogenation
A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C. To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2). It is important to note that the catalytic transformation of C3H8 in these routes is quite different from other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of the differences in reactivity of the respective alkanes. (45,46) Figure 22 Figure 22. Various routes investigated in past decades for propane conversion to propylene, homogeneous reaction (red box), and catalyst-assisted reaction (brown). Reaction conditions are mentioned for each route.
5.2.1. Propane Oxyhalogenation
The propane oxyhalogenation reaction proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water (eqs 2-242-29). Theoretically, 100% halogen atom efficiency can be achieved in the presence of O2, whereas efficiency is limited to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation (eqs 2-18, 2-20, and 2-22) due to the formation of HX. (46) C3H6 selectivity during the C3H8 oxidative dehydrogenation is generally lower than that of C2H4 from C2H6 because of the presence of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms in the case of C3H6, which can lead to successive oxidation of C3H6. (246) It is important to note that during oxyhalogenation reactions, the alkane conversion can be enhanced due to the gas-phase reactions. The highly reactive radical species are liberated from the catalyst surface and allow the formation of desired and undesired products in the gas phase. To date, research has mainly focused on the propane oxychlorination (POC), including reports of a wide range of catalytic materials, such as metal oxides (i.e., CeO2), metal phosphates, and metal oxyhalides. On the other hand, propane oxybromination (POB) leads to much lower yields because of polyhalogenation and overoxidation.
5.2.1.1. CeO2-Based Catalyst
CeO2-based catalysts have been studied extensively because of their high activity toward hydrogen halide oxidation, alkane, and alkene oxyhalogenation. (247) Xie et al. have investigated bulk transition metal oxide catalysts (i.e., RuO2, Fe2O3, CuO, NiO) and rare earth metal oxides (i.e., CeO2, La2O3, Eu2O3) for POC. (49) Among transition metal oxides, Fe2O3, CuO, and NiO are unstable during the reaction, whereas RuO2 leads to the formation of COx as major products, indicating high reactivity of oxygen species on the RuO2 surface. Bulk CeO2 shows the highest C3H8 conversion (i.e., 29%) and a good C3H6 selectivity of 61% at 500 C (Table 14). The POC is demonstrated to be structure-sensitive over various facets and morphology of CeO2. CeO2 nanorods (110 + 100 facet) are the most active for POC. (49) To improve activity and selectivity and suppress the overoxidation potential during POC, a solid solution of transition metal oxides with CeO2 has been investigated (Table 14). (49) In particular, 8% NiOCeO2 demonstrates an excellent single pass yield up to 55% with 80% C3H6 selectivity, outperforming other catalysts with different compositions. Raman results demonstrate that the catalyst activity is correlated with surface oxygen vacancies. The band at 831 cm1 due to O22 surface species is the strongest for 8% NiCeO2 followed by CeO2 nanorods and CeO2 nanocubes, while the bands for CeO2 nano-octahedra and CeO2 particles are too weak to be registered. Similarly, surface chloride coverage is determined to be crucial for controlling olefin selectivity, as evidenced by XPS results. (49) Table 14.

The presence of HCl not only suppresses the reactivity toward oxidation products over CeO2 but also induces new active site pairs for selective C3H6 production. DFT calculations reveal that the reaction is initiated by the formation of peroxide species over oxygen vacancies, which can oxidize Cl into Cl•, and the surface-bound Cl• radical is responsible for CH activation. (49) DFT calculations combined with detailed kinetic analysis provide insights into the reaction mechanisms, in which the reaction proceeds via propyl chloride generation and subsequent dehydrochlorination into C3H6 over the catalyst surface, as illustrated in Figure 23. (49) The energy barrier of CH activation on Ce4+O2 (1.8 eV) is higher than that on Cl• adjacent to O2 (0.9 eV), indicating that the latter pair is responsible for C3H8 activation. (248) It is generally agreed that the formation of propyl chloride inhibits the overoxidation. (49,248) The formation of Cl2 is found to be negligible in the presence of C3H8, suggesting gas-phase conversion is unlikely.

5.2.1.2. Metal Oxyhalide
While CeO2 exhibits the highest activity (Table 14), europium oxychloride (EuOCl) leads to better C3H6 selectivity (i.e., >95% with C3H8 conversion of 20%) during POC. (48,249) The excellent performance in the case of EuOCl can be rationalized by the unique balance of its mild redox nature that enables alkane activation, minimizes gas-phase reaction by inhibiting the evolution of Cl2 (Figure 24), and suppresses alkane overoxidation. Europium is predominantly found in Eu3+ with minor contributions from Eu2+ via XPS analysis. As suggested, the presence of a redox couple (Eu3+/Eu2+) is responsible for propane activation. (45) LaOCl is less selective toward C3H6 (i.e., 40% with C3H8 conversion of 51%) at 400 C, in contrast to EuOCl (Table 14).
Figure 24 Figure 24. Rate of propane consumption in oxychlorination reaction (POC) as a function of the ability of the catalyst to evolve Cl2 during oxychlorination (T10(HCl)). T10(HCl) corresponds to the temperature at which 10% HCl is converted into Cl2. Adapted from refs (48and50).
In the case of EuOBr, the POB reaction favors the formation of alkyl bromides (C3H7Br), resulting in poor C3H6 selectivity (i.e., 22% with C3H8 conversion of 45%) at 500 C. (45) It is postulated that the C3H8 activation during POB occurs in the gas phase by the in situ generated Br2, leading to polyhalogenation, cracking, and combustion (Figure 25). (45) Characterization of the spent EuOBr catalyst reveals the presence of the EuBr2 and EuBr phases after POB reaction, indicating bromination of the catalyst; whereas the EuOBr phase is stable during HBr oxidation and methane oxybromination in contrast to POC. (250) The bromination of the catalyst is formed due to the reduction of the catalyst surface by the C3H7Br generated in situ during the reaction.

5.1.1.3. Metal Phosphates
Transition metal phosphates such as V, Ti, Mn, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu have been investigated for the oxyhalogenation reaction of alkanes (Table 14). (50,249) The product distribution is strongly dependent on the nature of catalyst and the type of halogen. Among the metal phosphates, CrPO4 and FePO4 have shown excellent C3H6 selectivity (i.e., > 95%) during C3H8 oxychlorination. In contrast, Mn-, Ni-, Co-, and Ti-based phosphates result in cracking, V-phosphate only yields oxidation products, and Cu-phosphate favors the formation of chlorinated hydrocarbons. CrPO4 exhibits the maximum C3H6 yield 50% with selectivity of 95%. (50) Similar to EuOBr, vanadium-phosphate (VPO) shows 35% C3H8 conversion and 24% C3H6 selectivity during POB, but with a yield as low as 8% (Table 14). (251) Prez-Ramrez and co-workers describe several kinetic parameters to explain the differences in activity and selectivity toward different products over different catalysts. (50) In particular, the catalytic ability for the oxidation of HCl to molecular Cl2 is quantified based on the temperature at which 10% conversion of HCl oxidation (T10(HCL)) can be achieved (Figure 24). Similarly, the trends toward dehydrochlorination of C3H7Cl, cracking, and oxidation of propane are investigated for all catalysts. As shown in Figure 24, the rate of propane consumption via POC reaction correlates linearly with catalyst ability to evolve molecular Cl2 during oxidation of HCl. The high C3H6 selectivity over CrPO4 is attributed to the fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a low propensity to cracking and overoxidation, as well as hindered ability to evolve Cl2.
Operando photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy enables the detection of reactants, products, and short-lived intermediates such as radicals under reaction conditions. Recently, PEPICO has been applied in propane oxyhalogenation over the CrPO4 catalyst to shed light on mechanisms, especially in the gas phase. (246) Operando PEPICO reveals that neither Cl• nor Cl2 are present under POC reaction conditions. This indicates that propane activation occurs primarily on the catalyst surface, namely, a surface-confined mechanism, and proceeds via the formation of C3H7Cl, followed by fast dehydrochlorination to yield olefins. This is in line with the kinetic studies and corroborates that propane oxychlorination proceeds via surface-driven reaction pathways. (50,246) The propane oxybromination chemistry leads to a lower propylene yield due to the formation of coke, cracking, and oxidation products (COx), as well as brominated hydrocarbons (such as C3H7Br and C3H5Br) over VOPO4/CrPO4/EuOBr. (45,246,251,252) Detailed kinetic analysis, complemented by operando PEPICO, demonstrates that C3H8 activation proceeds in the gas phase with in situ generated bromine species (Br•/Br2) via catalytic HBr oxidation over CrPO4. The evolution of reactive intermediates, such as Br•, is correlated with C3H6 formation via operando PEPICO with increasing temperatures indicates that reaction takes place in gas phase primarily. Similar to POC, POB also proceeds through the formation of propyl halide, which subsequently undergo dehydrohalogenation to yield C3H6. (246) Further, this technique sheds light on the coking and cracking reaction pathways observed under oxybromination reaction conditions during POB (Figure 25). The presence of C3 radicals due to the resonance stabilization prolongs their lifetime in the reactor, leading to coke formation. The coke formation proceeds via consecutive hydrogen abstraction of 2-propyl by Br• to yield allyl and propargyl species which results in the formation of coke precursors such as benzene. Additionally, the cracking of CC bonds may also form ethyl and methyl radicals. The presence of methyl radicals likely facilitates the formation of C4C6 species through chain growth, thus contributing to the formation of coke precursors from alternative pathways. (246) In brief, the relationships between propane oxyhalogenation, gas-phase halogenation, C3H7X elimination, hydrogen halide oxidation, and propane oxidative dehydrogenation have been elucidated over a wide set of catalysts. Results suggest that the selectivity in the oxyhalogenation reaction depends on (i) the ability of the catalyst to selectively dehydrogenate the propyl halide into propylene, (ii) hindered ability to evolve molecular halogen, and (iii) suppressed overoxidation and combustion tendency. Of note, the high reactivity toward HCl oxidation can give rise to undesired products because of the gas-phase reactions, indicating the need for a balanced redox nature. (48,249,253)
5.2.2. Other Halogen-Assisted Systems
Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst that achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400 C. (254) The HCl generated during the reaction requires an oxychlorination reactor to recycle Cl2 via the Deacon reaction (4 HCl + O2  Cl2 + 2H2O). Alkali metal chloride catalysts also have been probed for oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8, though scarcely. (46,255,256) The C3H6 yield obtained over LiK/Dy2O3 is below 20% at 600 C, along with propylene selectivity lower than 60%. (255) The effect of organochloride compounds, such as CCl4, has also been studied for oxidative propane dehydrogenation over CeO2, Fe2O3, and CuO, in which improved C3H6 selectivities of up to 80% are evident at P(CCl4) = 0.17 kPa under oxygen-limiting conditions. (257259) These studies are conducted under relatively low conversions (i.e., 25% at 450 C and FT/W  40006000 cm3 h1 gcat1), which limits the C3H8 yield below 20%. Of note, the presence of chlorinated species near the surface region and in the gas phase accounts for the improved performance with the addition of CCl4. (257,258) Oxychlorination on a PtSn/θ-Al2O3 catalyst also shows the restoration of catalytic activity during conventional DHP because of the excellent dispersion of sintered Pt agglomerates. (260)
5.2.3. Molten Salt-Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenation
The oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons on metal iodide-based molten salt was first developed by Shell. (261,262) In those approaches, the ODHP reaction can occur between 450 and 600 C in the presence of metal iodides (i.e., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2), and a C3H6 yield up to 70% can be achieved (Table 15). The molten salt catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation can be considered a special case of halogen-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation, in which a halogen, such as I2, is generated in situ via the reaction between metal iodide and oxygen. The reaction, however, primarily takes place in the gas phase.
Table 15. Molten Salt-Mediated Gas-Phase Dehydrogenation of C3H8 mediator temp (C) space time (s) feed ratio aimed product C3H8 conv. (%) C3H6 selec.

(263,264) A constant-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics study has been used to investigate the reactions between LiI and gaseous molecules (O2, H2O, and I2). (265) Results demonstrate that the most favorable process is the formation of gaseous I2, coproduced with LiOH or Li2O, depending on the availability of water; the reaction most likely occurs in the gas phase. These observations are supported by the fact that a similar product distribution is observed using either LiI/LiOH or I2 as an iodine source for the dehydrogenation reaction. (263) The high C3H6 yield can be achieved if the molten salt meets the following prerequisites: (i) the metal oxide can be converted into the corresponding iodide by exposure to iodide species under the reaction conditions and vice versa and (ii) I2 (g) can be obtained by oxidation under dehydrogenation conditions. (261) Similarly, an optimal concentration of O2 is vital for this reaction because (i) it is responsible for generating iodine radicals for chain reactions and (ii) excess oxygen can cause combustion reactions. (263,264) It is important to note that the corrosive nature of the mixture of molten salt, I2, HI, and alkyl halides, is a serious concern that might impair efforts for its commercial applications.
6. Progress in Theoretical Studies of Reaction Mechanisms
Regardless of the oxidant or catalyst used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the CH bond must first be activated. In metal oxides, this commonly occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acidbase pair. (266268) In the redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group. (269) This forms water, which desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst. (270272) In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies. (273275) In this context, the role of the oxidant is to regenerate the catalyst by either reoxidizing the vacancy site through providing its oxygen, or reacting with adsorbed hydrogen species on the surface.
While ODHP has featured extensively in theoretical studies, examples where soft oxidants are explicitly considered are considerably fewer. In this section, we include examples of ODHP with soft oxidants but also supplement similar examples with other alkanes, such as ethane and methane partial oxidation, which share many similarities in their reaction mechanism. Oxidants discussed in this section include CO2, N2O, NOx, and other soft oxidants, such as sulfides and halides. We discuss both scenarios where the soft oxidant participates in the reaction by regenerating oxygen vacancy sites and where they react with surface hydrogen directly, as well as additional routes such as via forming gas-phase radicals.
6.1. Reactions with CO2
6.1.1. CO2 Dissociation in ODHP
When CO2 is used as an oxidant, there are generally two proposed mechanisms for its participation in ODHP. One involves direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, and the other involves the hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO. For the CO2 dissociation route, its high stability can be problematic because it prevents it from being easily activated to oxidize the surface. Therefore, finding a catalyst with a strong affinity for CO2 and its dissociation is an important criterion for ODHP with CO2. Fan et al. have explored the feasibility of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 on a V2O5 catalyst. (276) They found the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV, suggesting an extremely difficult process. The authors therefore have concluded that CO2 is unable to reoxidize the surfaces following dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, which leads to a deactivation of the catalyst. Meanwhile, on a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy. (28) It is concluded that vanadia in the WOxVOx/SiO2 cannot be fully oxidized to V2O5 with CO2 but instead oxidized to V2O4. In contrast, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily on the CeO2 (110) surface with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies. (277) The ability of the reduced CeO2 surface to dissociate CO2 is utilized in a series of studies with bifunctional catalysts containing a CeO2 support. (12,155,278280) Transition metals, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have also been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation. One study found a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV could be obtained on Ni4/MgO which provides active oxygen species for alkane CH activation. (281)
6.1.2. Factors Controlling Selectivity between ODH and Dry Reforming
CO2 can often participate in parallel competing reactions from ODHP, such as dry reforming and the RWGS at high temperatures. Selective ODHP catalysts, therefore, need to prevent dry reforming from occurring. In one such study, Myint et al. have examined a number of bifunctional catalysts, containing CoPt, CoMo, and FeNi supported on CeO2 for ethane ODH with CO2 from experiments and theory. (280) The authors observe the highest selectivity to the ODH product with FeNi/CeO2. DFT is used to rationalize this behavior by comparing the energy profiles for successive CH dissociation and CC dissociation reactions. As shown in Figure 26, these two paths represent the formation of the ODH product ethylene and the dry reforming product, respectively. On the CoPt surface, the intermediates for CC dissociation are found to be considerably more favorable in energy than the CH products, whereas the trend is reversed on the FeNi surface. The clear differences in energetics between the two paths in this comparison supports the experimentally observed selectivity trends. Thermodynamic comparisons from DFT have also been used to explain selectivity of ODHP versus dry reforming on a variety of other catalytic systems, such as Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C, (282) FeNi3 and FeOx/Ni(111), (278) and Ni3Pt and FeO/Ni(111).

Kattel et al. have followed up on this study with a thorough theoretical investigation of the reaction network and kinetics. (283) In the studied reaction network for ethane ODH, CO2 goes through either a dissociative mechanism or an associative one forming HOCO (Figure 27A). In the dissociative mechanism, CO is formed and desorbs into the gas phase, while the remaining oxygen can assist in the CH activation or become hydrogenated after unassisted CH activation. In the associative mechanism, CH activation first occurs independently of CO2, which provides hydrogen to form the HOCO intermediate. Once formed, it can dissociate with a barrier of 0.83 eV, significantly lower than the direct dissociation of CO2 having a barrier of 2.13 eV. In the dry reforming path, ethylene is also formed via the same intermediates (Figure 27B). However, the paths diverge upon further oxidation of ethylene to CH2CH2O, CH2CH, CH3CH, or CH2CHO, which eventually leads to CC scission. Kinetic Monte Carlo calculations find dry reforming to be favored over ODH. Interestingly, it is revealed that the CO2 dissociation is favored over HOCO formation, despite the higher energy barriers for the former. The calculations also find the dehydrogenation of CH3CH2 to CH2CH2 to be a key descriptor of ODH selectivity, which should be promoted to improve the selectivity on the catalyst.

6.1.3. CO2 Hydrogenation in ODHP
In a work by Gomez et al., ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and subsequent aromatization by CO2 is investigated for P- and Ga-modified ZSM-5 catalysts. (284) The associative pathway for CO2 is computed with DFT, where CO2 is hydrogenated by a nearby H2 that is formed as part of the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H5 (Figure 28). The reaction of CO2 follows roughly that of reverse watergas shift, which forms CO and H2O. The concerted hydrogenation of CO2 occurs with the dissociation of H2 to form COOH with a barrier of 1.00 eV, followed by a second concerted dissociation of the COH bond to form CO and H2O in a single step with a barrier of 1.78 eV. The authors find the primary role of CO2 for this reaction on Ga/ZSM5 is to consume hydrogen, which promotes portions of the reaction where H2 formation is kinetically and thermodynamically less favorable. The mechanism is also found to be consistent with 13CO2 isotope studies in the same paper, which does not report any carbon from CO2 in the final hydrocarbon products.

6.1.4. CO2 Poisoning in ODHP
On catalysts with strong basic sites, such as MgO, CO2 can interact strongly with surface sites and poisons the catalyst, which is an issue when considering CO2 as an oxidant. In oxidative coupling and dehydrogenation, it has long been noted in experiments that CO2 strongly inhibits the reaction from proceeding. (128,285,286) This is consistent with theoretical calculations which find very negative CO2 adsorption energies of 2 to 3 eV on the MgO and CaO surfaces, particularly at the step sites. (287) On these surfaces CO2 interacts with the lattice oxygen to form surface bound carbonate species. The same sites which strongly bind CO2 are also responsible for CH activation, which remain blocked because of the much weaker interaction between the alkane and the surface. Similarly, on the perovskite BaZrO3, CO2 is found to bind strongly to form a stable carbonate layer under ambient concentrations, which suggests such a catalyst would also be inactive for ODHP with CO2. (288) Consequently, poisoning by CO2 is an important potential factor preventing its use in ODHP and may also apply to the other oxidants as well.
6.2. Reactions with N2O and NOx
6.2.1. Reactions with N2O
In an early work, Rozanska et al. have investigated ODHP on vanadia using DFT for a cluster model, and compared the differences between O2 and N2O as oxidants. (177) On this catalyst, propane first undergoes homolytic CH activation on the terminal oxygen of the V5+ sites, reducing the site to V4+ and forming a hydroxyl. The propyl then undergoes a second CH activation on the hydroxyl site forming propylene and a water and leaving a further reduced V3+ site, which must be regenerated by an oxidant to close the catalytic cycle. From their calculations, they find N2O to be a weaker oxidant for the catalyst, which can only oxidize the V3+ sites, whereas O2 can oxidize both V3+ and V4+ sites, as evidenced by the lower energy barriers required for O2 (Figure 29A). The oxidization of the V4+ site by O2 also leads to the formation of HO2 radicals, which can either oxidize another V4+ site or activate the CH bonds in a side reaction, with a barrier of 0.67 eV for propane. Finally, when oxidizing the sites, N2O restores the V3+ sites back to V5+ by providing its single oxygen, whereas O2 instead forms a peroxovanadate species. This is found to be possible on both the monomeric and dimeric vanadate. Subsequent investigation found the peroxovanadate to be more active for both propane activation and propylene oxidation than the V5+ site, having lower reaction barriers and a more exothermic reaction by comparison (Figure 29B). In particular, propylene activation on peroxovanadate has a low barrier of 0.84 eV and is exothermic by 2.59 eV, whereas activation on V5+ has a barrier of 1.43 eV and is endothermic by 1.17 eV. The authors estimate the oxidation rate of propylene is one to 2 orders of magnitude greater than propane under the reaction conditions, which could contribute to the overoxidation of propane to undesired COx, when O2 is used as the oxidant. Thus, the authors point toward peroxovanadate formation as a key factor in the lower selectivity to propylene with O2 as the oxidant over N2O.

A similar hypothesis regarding differences in active oxygen sites due to the choice of oxidant has been put forward by Dasireddy et al. for butane ODH on the NiMoO4 catalyst. (289) On the basis of the DFT reaction energies for surface oxidation by O2, N2O, and CO2, it is found that the full oxidation of Ni and Mo sites is thermodynamically favorable with O2, whereas N2O and CO2 can only partially oxidize the surface, recovering only the Mo sites. On the fully oxidized surface, CH activation is facile with a barrier of 0.05 eV, irreversibly forming butan-1-ol in a single, highly exothermic step, which eventually leads to the formation of COx. By comparison, on the partially oxidized surface, CH activation is rate-limiting with a barrier of 1.49 eV, in reasonable agreement with the experimental activation energies in the same paper. Therefore, the higher oxidizing ability of O2 provides more reactive oxygen species on the surface, leading to the overoxidation of butane.
Using N2O as an oxidant has also been explored in metalorganic framework (MOF) systems for alkane partial oxidation and ODH. In methane partial oxidation, the terminal oxygen of the metal nodes is commonly proposed to be the active site, which activates the methane CH bond and forms methanol via a radical-rebound mechanism. (290,291) Upon desorption of the product, N2O reoxidizes the site. In a more recent combined experimental and theoretical study, Barona et al. propose a similar mechanism for alkane ODH on the Fe3M nodes of MOF PCN-250 (Figure 30A). (292) Here, the alkane undergoes homolytic CH activation on the terminal oxygen of the metal node, resulting in a hydroxyl group which is further reduced to form water or an alcohol. The products, then, desorb and leave an open metal site, which is subsequently filled by the oxygen from N2O activation, regenerating the site and closing the catalytic loop. In this work, they find the ability of the site to regenerate the oxygen from N2O activation and the ability of the oxygen to activate the CH bond are correlated to a single descriptor, the oxygen binding energy on the metal node. The more negative the oxygen binding energy, the lower the N2O activation energy and the higher the CH activation energy, and vice versa. In the regime where N2O activation is rate-limiting, a direct correlation between the DFT N2O activation energies and the experimental rates is observed, supporting this mechanism (Figure 30B). The rational design of better MOF catalysts following this mechanism may be realized by tuning the oxygen binding energy of the metal node from changing its elemental composition.

6.2.2. Reactions with NOx
NOx is another potential oxidant for alkane oxidation, though few theoretical studies have been conducted in the context of ODHP. However, some hints toward its role and reactivity in ODHP can be found in existing studies of NOx dissociation and reduction. One DFT study finds that the dissociation of NO2 can be a moderately facile process on certain metal surfaces, such as Cu(111) with a barrier of 0.61 eV. (293) Another study has looked at NO2 reduction on V2O5, and found that the reduction of NO2 to HNO2 over a hydroxyl on the V4+ site can occur with little to no barrier. (294) These V4+ sites are identical with those formed from CH activation in ODHP, suggesting that NO2 can similarly oxidize the V4+ site like O2 as previously described (Figure 29A). (177) For the case of NO, a DFT study on Pt(100) has investigated both dissociation and hydrogenation pathways, finding the dissociation to N and O to be more favorable with a barrier of 0.96 eV. (295) These results provide guidance for catalysts which could effectively use NOx as an oxidant in the ODHP reaction.
Another perspective for the participation of NOx in ODHP has been introduced in a recent experimental and theoretical study by Annamalai et al. (296) They find that gas phase NOx can promote selective ODHP via the formation of OH radicals, which can then activate CH bonds in ODHP in the absence of a solid catalyst. A reaction mechanism is proposed where OH radicals are formed continuously from the reaction of NO and NO2 with O2 and sacrificial H donors, such as the alkyl radicals. The reason behind the high selectivity of OH radicals for ODHP is then explained by the differences in the activation energy of various CH bonds as a function of the hydrogen abstraction strength of the catalytic site. It is found that sites with low hydrogen abstraction strength have a greater preference for activating weaker CH bonds (such as propylene) over stronger ones (such as propane), leading to overoxidation and a reduced selectivity to propylene. Meanwhile, the OH radical, having a strong hydrogen abstraction strength (measured by a hydrogen adsorption energy of 5.39 eV from DFT), has no such preference to the weaker CH bonds, which prevents overoxidation from occurring. Relating this back to heterogeneous catalysis, NO is also found to be generated from boron nitride catalysts under ODHP conditions, which could also participate in this process. (297) Further theoretical studies are needed to elucidate the impact of radical formation by NOx on the ODHP reaction in the presence of a solid catalyst.
6.3. Reactions with Other Soft Oxidants
6.3.1. Sulfides
Zhu et al. have explored the possibility of sulfur as another less active oxidant for alkane conversion, specifically for methane oxidative coupling. (298) The authors note that the thermodynamic well for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2 is 13.41 eV, whereas for sulfur oxidation to CS2, it is considerably higher in energy at 3.45 eV. Therefore, the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation is much lower for the sulfur oxidant. This approach is realized by carrying out the reaction under gaseous sulfur flow on a selection of transition metal sulfides. Presumably, the gaseous sulfur regenerates vacancies on the surface formed from H2S desorption during methane coupling. An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C. High temperatures are needed for this process due to both the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on the sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides. These barriers range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2. While the performance of this catalyst is found to be relatively modest and far from practical consideration, it is conceivable that future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening. In particular, the authors have observed the MS bond energy to be a good descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers.
Premji et al. have explored the role of H2S in ODHP in the gas phase from experimental and theoretical perspectives. (44) From theoretical calculations, it was proposed the co-feed of H2S/O2 and partial oxidation of H2S can produce sulfur radical species SH and HS2 which participate in hydrogen abstraction along with OH and OOH. Subsequently, after CH activation to form propyl radicals, both O2 and S2 can then form adducts with the propyl and undergo further reactions. With the propyl-O2 adduct, the propylene is the kinetic product, though a side distribution of other products can be formed, such as propanal, methyloxirane, and oxetane, all of which are more thermodynamically stable than propylene. On the other hand, with the propyl-S2 adduct, propylene is more favored both kinetically and thermodynamically, in part due to the relative instability of the S-containing hydrocarbon products. The more favorable energetics for propylene formation with sulfide species is consistent with experimental observation of higher propylene selectivity observed in the paper.
6.3.2. Halides
There has been recent interests in using halogens, such as Cl2 and Br2, as oxidants, particularly in oxyhalogenation reactions, which can be used for alkane to alkene conversion. (249,299) Zichittella et al. have explored the mechanism and factors governing alkene selectivity for oxyhalogenation in a combined theoretical and experimental study of an iron phosphate catalyst. (252) Interestingly, the authors have observed a divergence in the mechanism for ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination, with the former being dominated by surface reactions and the latter being mainly dominated by gas-phase reactions (Figure 31). In the proposed mechanism, ethane oxychlorination follows a surface-mediated CH activation (with a barrier of 0.61 eV) to form an ethyl intermediate which then reacts with a surface chloride to form ethyl chloride in a barrierless process. Ethyl chloride is subsequently dehydrohalogenated (where a hydrogen and halogen are both removed from the alkyl in a concerted step) to ethylene, the desired product, in another surface reaction. By contrast, when Br2 is used, a gas-phase reaction is found to be more favorable where bromine desorbs as radicals which dehydrogenate and polybrominate ethane in a process unselective to ethylene. These results highlight the importance of the competition between surface and gas phase reactions that control the selectivity of the alkene and how the different oxidants shift their relative contributions.

7. Conclusions and Future Directions
Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants over a variety of catalysts are reviewed in this work. Figure 32 summarizes and compares the catalytic performance of key catalysts explored in each reaction route in the form of the correlation between selectivity and conversion. In general, transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides. For CO2- and N2OODHP, the explored catalyst systems are analogous. However, differences in inherent properties of reactions and difficulties in dealing with corrosiveness have led to complications in advancing the research, resulting in unique challenges and future research directions for each route. In general, future efforts should be devoted to designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the CH bond in C3H8 with good regenerability, as well as to renovating the reaction systems that can reconcile the need for industrial processes with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases.
Figure 32 Figure 32. Summarized catalytic performance of developed catalysts for CO2ODHP at 550 C (A), N2OODHP at 400 C (B), oxyhalogenation at 500 C (C), and SO2-mediated dehydrogenation at 640 C (D).
In CO2ODHP, the major efforts have been devoted toward exploring redox-type and nonredox-type catalysts and developing compositionstructurecatalysis relationship. As a representative of redox-type catalysts, CrOx exhibits higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion among all catalysts at 550 C, as presented in Figure 32A. The activity is found to depend on the redox cycles, dispersion of Cr species, surface Cr density, and nature of the support. The catalytic performance of other redox-type catalysts, VOx, has not yet reached high C3H8 conversion at 550 C (i.e., >20%), though high C3H6 selectivity (i.e., 95%98%) is achieved at low conversion (Figure 32A). The non-redox-type catalyst, Ga2O3, shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion. Although Ga2O3 can be reduced upon contact with C3H8 molecules, its oxidation state remains stable during reaction. Instead, the reaction appears to proceed through the proposed heterolytic dissociation mechanism. (127) Combined with these developed redox- and nonredox-type catalysts, the zeolite-supported counterparts are also promising candidates (Figure 32A). Other catalysts that have been explored include Fe, precious metal, Mo2C, and Ni catalysts. Screening tests and mechanistic studies on these materials shed light on their roles in the selective activation of the CH bond. For example, the Mo oxycarbide, formed through CO2-induced oxidation of Mo2C, favors the activation of methylene CH bond in C3H8 molecules; (160) the presence of Pd can promote the oxidation activity of redox sites such as Ce4+  Ce3+, through which it promotes not only C3H8 conversion, but also inhibits Pd-catalyzed DRP reactions to undesired CO and H2, leading to well-preserved C3H6 selectivity. (171) The presence of CO2 shows an overall promoting effect on C3H6 formation. Major positive roles of CO2 include: (i) completing redox cycles, though the oxidation potential is weak, (ii) shifting the reaction equilibrium of ODHP to the product side by consuming the produced H2 via RWGS, and (iii) serving as an agent for coke removal by the reverse Boudouard reaction. Competitive adsorption between C3H8 and CO2 is known for CrOx (24) and HZSM-5-supported Ga2O3. (127) However, the presence of CO2 also enhances C3H6 production on CrOx as a result of promoted C3H6 desorption. (24) Despite these achievements, there are still elusive points that need to be addressed in future studies:(i) Identification of redox cycles on redox-type catalysts. In the case of redox-type catalysts, there exist two different redox scenarios, including Cr6+  Cr3+/Cr2+ and Cr3+  Cr2+, which seems to depend on the nature of the support and metalsupport interactions. Such divergence necessitates the efforts to develop an in-depth understanding of the correlations.
(ii) Reaction mechanisms. Liu et al. have observed the resemblance of DRIFT spectra between DHP and the reverse reaction C3H6 hydrogenation in terms of strong adsorbed surface species. (109) A new intermediate propenyl-vanadium (VC3H5) has been proposed as an alternative key intermediate for CO2ODHP by taking the elementary steps of C3H6 hydrogenation into consideration, yet still requiring solid evidence. Besides, side reactions are involved in addition to CO2ODHP reaction, such as RWGS and reverse Boudouard reaction. Continuous efforts have been put forth to identify the intermediates and plausible reaction paths of each reaction by both experimental and computational approaches. However, there is a lack of studies in clarifying the key intermediates and dominating reaction paths by taking the entire reaction network of CO2ODHP into consideration. In particular, this requires a sufficient amount of in situ characterization techniques to fill the gap.
(iii) Competitive adsorption between CO2, C3H8, and C3H6. There is a competitive adsorption between these molecules, which impacts the C3H8 adsorption and C3H6 yield. Dopants that enable the balance between C3H8 and CO2 adsorption and inhibition of strong C3H6 adsorption are desired.
(iv) Catalyst deactivation and regeneration. For CO2ODHP, rapid deactivation occurs as a consequence of reduction of active sites and coke formation. Although catalyst stability and regenerability have been examined, testing of long-term stability is rather scarce, nor have regeneration guidelines been comprehensively covered for different catalyst systems. Therefore, endeavors should be made in developing robust, coke-resistant catalysts that meet the requirement of practical implementation in the mid to long-term.
VOx and Fe-containing zeolites are reported to be the most superior catalysts for N2OODHP (Figure 32B). Because of the absence of thermodynamic restraints, these Fe-containing zeolite catalysts show activity at a relatively lower temperature of 400 C. Notwithstanding, potential catalysts that have been tested for N2OODHP are still scarce, and more catalyst screening is needed in future studies. For example, there are only a few works regarding metals other than iron-supported/modified zeolites which have been reported. Also, while there are multiple reports regarding MFI and BEA zeolite topology for N2OODHP, the effects of other zeolite topologies remain unknown.
Similar to CO2ODHP, deactivation and regeneration of catalysts in N2OODHP remains a challenge. As discussed in section 3.5.3, CO2 can serve as an agent for coke removal, thereby enhancing the catalyst stability, while N2O cannot. Together with the variation in oxidation potential between N2O and CO2, these are likely the reasons why similar catalysts show worse stability in N2OODHP. Although a few studies have reported the rapid deactivation of iron-containing zeolite catalysts and vanadia oxide-based catalysts for N2OODHP, deactivation studies regarding molybdenum oxide catalysts have been scarcely touched. Thus, further study of these catalysts is needed to address the challenges of stability of catalysts for N2OODHP route. (180183,186,187) For iron-containing zeolite catalysts, there have been studies suggesting that the nature and strength of acid sites have significant impacts on the rate of deactivation, implying that catalyst stability can be further improved based on catalyst design. (182,211) Noteworthily, dehydrogenation using N2O as a soft oxidant has been studied for other alkanes as well, such as ethane, butane, or isobutane, of which isobutane dehydrogenation shows better catalytic performance than propane dehydrogenation using N2O. (211,289,300303) Therefore, further study to improve catalyst stability seems to be warranted, as dehydrogenation using N2O may not only offer additional ways to subvert challenges faced by O2 oxidant but also may provide a method to utilize N2O.
The introduction of exogenous mild oxidizers is a potentially selective route for DHP. Catalytic oxyhalogenation is a promising route for single-step C3H6 production and yields of up to 55% have been achieved. (49,50) Specifically, oxychlorination chemistry over CeO2 and metal phosphate-based catalysts show good selectivity (up to 95%) and conversion (up to 70% at 500 C) in comparison to conventional ODHP (Figure 32C). In contrast, the selective activation of propane in oxybromination chemistry is impractical either because of poor selectivity or insufficient stability of catalysts. (45,251) CeO2 possesses strong oxidizing characteristics and results in the highest reactivity in oxychlorination reactions. The overoxidation potential of Ce-based catalysts can be improved by heteroatom doping into the CeO2 structure. The high C3H6 yield (i.e., 55%) and selectivity (i.e., 80%) for 8% NiOCeO2 are mainly due to a balanced redox ability at 500 C. (49) On the other hand, metal phosphates such as CrPO4 (yield = 50% at 500 C) are moderate oxidizers, leading to high selectivity (i.e., 95%) but lower activity than CeO2 under identical conditions. (50) To summarize, an optimal propane oxychlorination catalyst should exhibit moderate redox properties so that it enables alkane activation but does not favor alkane overoxidation, combustion, and evolution of Cl2, while possessing fast dehydrochlorination kinetics.The gaseous sulfur compounds, on the other hand, act as effective DHP mediators because of their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction from a hydrocarbon molecule (Figure 32D). C3H6 yield rises up to 81% over Al2O3 at 750 C and 93% over CoMo/Al2O3 at 450 C, indicating a potential to revolutionize propane dehydrogenation chemistry. (231,232) Interestingly, the highest reported yield for C3H6 (either in DHP or ODHP) in various patents are over Al2O3 and CoMo/Al2O3, which are used in industrial Claus or hydrodesulfurization process. However, the exact nature of the active sites is still unclear from the studies to date because of the lack of catalyst characterization and mechanistic studies. (40,222,242245) Because of the extremely corrosive nature of sulfur or halogen, operando and in situ techniques are seldom used. The potential scalability of the underlying process and corrosion issues combined with the recovery process of sulfur, halogen, or hydrogen halide products will require suitable materials, reactors, and sophisticated process engineering. Sulfur-mediated dehydrogenation chemistry in particular has shown potential to selectively activate propane by capitalizing on abundant natural gas reserves. (25,26) However, the susceptibility of the material to be attacked by sulfur, halogens, HX, and halogenated products requires testing of materials under actual reaction conditions. To deal with the above-mentioned hurdles, significant endeavors should be devoted to developing a sufficiently active and stable catalyst with an in-depth understanding of the structureactivity relationship, as well as reaction kinetics. This is especially true for various recent industry efforts outlined in a number of patents, where efforts toward developing innovative strategies, such as either using gaseous sulfur or some sulfur compound (H2S/S2/COS) with O2 have ensued. However, catalyst characterization, stability tests, structureactivity relationships, and reaction kinetics are nearly nonexistent in the patent literature. The absence of detailed kinetic studies makes it impossible to have information about the reaction network for sulfur-based ODHP. Therefore, this process requires the systematic kinetic and operando studies (such as PEPICO) to understand the genesis of sulfur-based byproducts obtained in the process. Furthermore, techno-economic analysis is scarce and should be performed comparing the best catalyst (or processes) with existing technologies, such as DHP and ODHP.A comparison of catalytic performance is also made between O2ODHP and ODHP with soft oxidants in the form of selectivityconversion correlation over the array of developed catalysts, as presented in Figure 33. In comparison to O2ODHP, ODHP with soft oxidants shows comparable C3H6 selectivity under the same range of C3H8 conversion (i.e., <20%). In particular, CO2ODHP exhibits higher selectivity among all reaction routes. Moreover, the high selectivity, namely, >80%, can be well retained at the C3H8 conversion as high as 53%. The C3H8 conversion of other reaction routes with soft oxidants, such as SO2-mediated DHP and oxyhalogenation can also reach high values (i.e., 3070%), yet with lower selectivity (i.e., 5080%). Noteworthily, this way of comparison is not completely fair, as it overlooks the effects of other critical parameters, such as temperature, feed compositions, GHSV, etc. However, a general trend of activityselectivity spans of each reaction route has been revealed and provided perspective for further research in the dehydrogenation of propane and other light alkanes.Figure 33 Figure 33. Propylene selectivity plotted against propane conversion for ODHP with different oxidants. Data of O2ODHP were adapted from ref (7). h-BN and BNNTs stand for hexagonal boron nitride and boron nitride nanotubes, respectively.While there is still significant progress to be made in the development of better ODHP catalysts, theoretical studies in the literature have provided useful insights toward this problem with regards to mechanistic understanding and catalyst design principles. With CO2 for example, its dissociation, hydrogenation, and poisoning on the surface can all factor prominently toward its catalytic activity. In addition, there are a number of competing reactions that can govern the selectivity to the ODHP product that also should be considered. (304) Modeling these pathways through microkinetics or kinetic Monte Carlo has been shown to be very useful in that regard. (283) On the other hand, descriptors, when available, have also proven to be useful when there is a need to screen across a large number of potential catalysts. (292,298) However, high-throughput screening of catalysts for alkane conversion has remained primarily focused on CH activation, with far less study on the catalyst reoxidation step. (269) In addition, investigations into the catalyst stability using soft oxidants have yet to feature prominently in modeling efforts, which is relevant for the practical applications. In conclusion, additional theoretical studies in these areas would be highly beneficial to move the field forward and guide experimental efforts, particularly in finding catalysts suitable for corrosive or less-studied oxidants, such as NOx, SOx, and halides.Efforts are also devoted to developing alternative technologies beyond packed catalyst bed, such as chemical looping and membrane reactor. Chemical looping offers opportunities for process intensification and energy loss minimization, which is of significance in future commercialization. (305) Current progress focuses on the feasibility of O2-assisted dehydrogenation of light alkanes. (306,307) Membrane reactors are emerging as an active research direction in light alkane conversion, such as propane dehydrogenation (308,309) and methane conversion, (310) because it enables the process intensification by integrating oxidant permeability and catalytic activity in one unit. (311) In ODHP, this novel reactor can achieve a uniform distribution of oxidant, thereby resulting in inhibited overoxidation and enhanced C3H6 selectivity. Kawi et al. have applied a novel hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor for O2ODHP, in which the membrane reactor was fabricated by integrating BaBi0.05Ci0.8Nb0.15O3δ (BBCN) perovskite hollow fiber membrane with silica-supported isolated Co2+ catalyst. (311) The fabricated membrane reactor has achieved C3H6 yield and selectivity of 50% and 74%, respectively, at 650 C with the TOS at 50 h. The key aspect to guarantee a higher C3H6 selectivity is to optimize the C3H8/O2 ratio to maintain high C3H8 conversion and to avoid overoxidation. Specifically, the C3H8 feeding rate should match the oxygen permeation through the membrane. The soft oxidants discussed in this review have similar kinetic diameters (i.e., 320360 pm), which are all smaller than the reagent C3H8 (i.e., 430 pm) and target product C3H6 (i.e., 450 pm), corroborating the feasibility of utilizing membrane reactors for further enhancement in activity and selectivity.Author Information Corresponding Author Zili Wu - Chemical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37831, United States;  Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37831, United States;  http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4468-3240;  Email: wuz1@ornl.gov Authors Xiao Jiang - Chemical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37831, United States;  Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37831, United States Lohit Sharma - Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania 18015, United States Victor Fung - Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37831, United States;  http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3347-6983 Sang Jae Park - School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, United States Christopher W.
