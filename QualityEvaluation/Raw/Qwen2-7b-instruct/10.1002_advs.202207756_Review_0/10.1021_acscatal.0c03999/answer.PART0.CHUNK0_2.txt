[1] "The major roles of soft oxidants include inhibiting overoxidation and improving propylene selectivity, which are considered to be current challenges in O2-assisted dehydrogenation."
[2] "Continuous efforts have been put forth to clarify the relationship of catalytic performance and essential factors for enhancements, primarily focusing on metal oxide dispersion (e.g., active site configuration, redox properties, etc.) and the nature of the support (e.g., textural property, acidbase property, etc.)."
[3] "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none."
[4] "Carbon deposition and reduction in active sites might be responsible for such rapid deactivation, the dominance of which depends on the nature of metal oxide, roles of CO2, and reaction mechanisms."
[5] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity. Below monolayer coverage, the C3H6 yield usually increases with an increase in Cr content; but beyond this threshold, the excess redox Cr species cannot be attached with the support so that unstable Cr species may decompose to nonredox crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles with no activity."

1. Soft oxidants play a crucial role in inhibiting overoxidation and enhancing propylene selectivity, addressing challenges in oxygen-assisted dehydrogenation processes.

2. Researchers are actively studying the interplay between catalyst performance and key factors, such as metal oxide dispersion and support characteristics, aiming to improve dehydrogenation efficiency.

3. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) demonstrates superior activity compared to iron oxide (Fe2O3) and chromium oxide (Cr2O3), showing a decline in propylene yield as the material progresses down the list.

4. Rapid catalyst deactivation, characterized by carbon deposition and reduction in active sites, is influenced by the nature of the metal oxide, CO2 involvement, and the specific reaction mechanisms.

5. A single monolayer of Cr coverage represents the ideal point for achieving optimal activity. Below this layer, increased Cr content leads to enhanced yield, whereas beyond it, excessive Cr species become unstable, leading to the formation of inactive α-Cr2O3 particles.

1. 软氧化剂在抑制过氧化和提高丙烯选择性方面起着关键作用，解决了氧气辅助脱氢过程中的挑战。

2. 研究人员积极研究催化剂性能与关键因素之间的关系，如金属氧化物分散性和支持材料特性，以期提高脱氢效率。

3. 氧化镓(Ga2O3)在活性方面优于氧化铁(Fe2O3)和氧化铬(Cr2O3)，随着材料顺序的下降，丙烯产率呈现递减趋势。

4. 快速催化剂失活，表现为碳沉积和活性位点的减少，受金属氧化物性质、CO2参与以及特定反应机制的影响。

5. 单层Cr覆盖代表理想点，可实现最佳活性。在此之下，增加Cr含量导致产率增强，但超过此阈值后，过剩的Cr物种变得不稳定，导致形成无活性的α-Cr2O3粒子。
