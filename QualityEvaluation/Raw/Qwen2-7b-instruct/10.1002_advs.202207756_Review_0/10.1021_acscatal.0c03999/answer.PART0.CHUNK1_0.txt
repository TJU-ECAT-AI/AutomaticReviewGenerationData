[1] "Early efforts have been put forth to modify the acidbase properties of Ga2O3 catalysts by introducing alkali metal oxides such as K. (23) However, the incorporated K covers the acid sites on Ga2O3, exerting a negative impact on both conversion and selectivity (Table 5)."
[2] "For the DHP reaction, various methods have been developed to tune the textural properties of Ga2O3, such as the nanocasting technique using mesoporous carbon as a hard template (131) and the urea-based hydrothermal method using polyethylene glycol as a soft template agent. (132)"
[3] "Clearly, there is a synergistic effect on Fe3Ni1 (i.e., C3H6 yield = 1.6%) in comparison to the simple sum of yields on the monometallic counterpart (e.g., 0.4% and 0.2% for Ni1 and Fe3, respectively)."

1. Efforts to modify the acidbase properties of Ga2O3 catalysts by introducing alkali metal oxides like K negatively impacted both the conversion and selectivity of the catalysts.
2. Methods to adjust the textural properties of Ga2O3 for the DHP reaction include the nanocasting technique and the urea-based hydrothermal method.
3. There is a synergistic effect between Fe and Ni when combined, leading to a higher C3H6 yield compared to individual yields of Ni and Fe catalysts.
