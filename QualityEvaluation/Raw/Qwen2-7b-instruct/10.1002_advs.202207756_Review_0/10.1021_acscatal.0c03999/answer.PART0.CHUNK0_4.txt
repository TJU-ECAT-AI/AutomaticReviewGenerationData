[1] "There have been several excellent reviews regarding ODHP with CO2 as an oxidant."
[2] "Most of them have concentrated on the feasibility of utilizing CO2 as an oxidant for multiple reactions but fewer focused on the details of the ODHP reaction."
[3] "Also, there has been little covered regarding the development of catalysts for other soft oxidant-assisted ODHP."
