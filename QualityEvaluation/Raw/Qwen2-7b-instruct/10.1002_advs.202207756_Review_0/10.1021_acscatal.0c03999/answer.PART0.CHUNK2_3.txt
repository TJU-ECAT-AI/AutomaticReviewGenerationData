On iron containing ZSM-5, studies report that FeOAl species are likely active sites for N2O-mediated ODHP. (19,35,36) Grunert et al. have used FT-IR analysis paired with NO adsorption to characterize the abundant Fe species (Figure 18A) and catalytic evaluation of Fe-ZSM-5 (Figure 18) to support such hypothesis. (36) Of note, FT-IR spectroscopy, along with NO adsorption, is commonly used to characterize active sites for Fe-containing catalysts. For samples without calcination (Fe-MFI-24G), NO adsorption results in a broad band at 1850 cm1, indicating mononitrosyl on ferrous ions in the straight channels of ZSM-5. When samples are calcined at high temperatures, two strong bands at 1875 and 1890 cm1 are observed in the IR spectra. The band at 1875 cm1 corresponds to the mononitrosyl species on extra-framework Fe2+OAl sites; the other band at 1890 cm1 is assigned to the mononitrosyl species on isolated ferrous ions located on γ sites of the ZSM-5 structure. The band observed at 1810 cm1 is assigned to poly nitrosyl species on ferrous ion sites. As initial adsorption of NO on Fe-MFI-1173 results in the emergence of a band at 1875 cm1, it is hypothesized that both bands at 1810 and 1875 cm1 come from the same ferrous species, namely isolated extra-framework Fe2+OAl species. Clearly, calcining Fe-MFI-24G samples leads to the transformation of iron sites from isolated ions to isolated extra-framework FeOAl species. Figure 18B shows the C3H6 yield during N2O-mediated ODHP for samples calcined at different temperatures. An increase in C3H6 yield is observed as the calcination temperature rises from 600 C (Fe-MFI-24G-873) to 800 C (Fe-MFI-24G-1073), while the samples calcined at 800 (Fe-MFI-24G-1073) and 900 C (Fe-MFI-24G-1173) show similar highest C3H6 yields between 27% and 30%. On the basis of this correlation between exposed active iron sites and the observed catalytic performance, it is proposed that the isolated FeOAl site is the active center responsible for N2O-mediated ODHP reaction.

The active sites for N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) on iron containing ZSM-5 are believed to be FeOAl species. FT-IR spectroscopy, alongside NO adsorption, is frequently used to characterize these active sites. Calcination of the catalyst samples at high temperatures transforms the iron sites from isolated ions to isolated extra-framework FeOAl species. The increase in the yield of propylene (C3H6) with the increase in calcination temperature from 600°C to 800°C indicates that the isolated FeOAl site is the active center responsible for N2O-mediated ODHP reaction.

铁含有的ZSM-5中的活性位点被认为是FeOAl物种。傅里叶变换红外光谱以及NO吸附经常被用来表征这些活性位点。在高温下煅烧催化剂样品会将铁位点从孤立离子转化为孤立的额外框架FeOAl物种。随着煅烧温度从600°C增加到800°C，丙烯（C3H6）产率的增加表明孤立的FeOAl位点是N2O介导的ODHP反应的活性中心。

On the basis of such observations, the following mechanism is proposed:(4-3) (4-4) (4-5) (4-6) (4-7) (4-8) In the proposed mechanism, the Fe3+Fe2+ cycle operates on the highly isolated extra-framework FeOAl site to decompose N2O to N2 and O2 (eq 4-3-eq 4-6) and forms Fe3+O species. (208210) Since the direct reaction of C3H8 and gaseous O2 produces COx as the main products, it is hypothesized that C3H8 reacts with the deposited O species to produce C3H6 with a high selectivity (eq 4-7). The C3H6 may further react with adsorbed O to form undesired COx species, as depicted in eq 4-8.

基于这些观察结果，提出了以下机制：（4-3）（4-4）（4-5）（4-6）（4-7）（4-8）。在这个提出的机制中，Fe3+Fe2+循环在高度隔离的额外框架FeOAl位点上运行，以分解N2O为N2和O2（方程式4-3到4-6），并形成Fe3+O物种。（208-210）由于C3H8与气态O2的直接反应会产生COx为主要产物，因此推测C3H8与沉积的O物种反应生成具有高选择性的C3H6（方程式4-7）。C3H6可能进一步与吸附的O反应形成不希望的COx物种，如方程式4-8所示。

Despite its high initial catalytic performance, a major drawback of iron-containing zeolites is deactivation by coke, which causes a rapid decrease in C3H6 yield. (180183) A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled with GC analysis (Figure 19) performed on MFI, BEA, and silicate catalysts is used to illustrate how zeolite catalysts deactivates over time during ODHP reaction. (182) Of note, c- indicates calcined only, and ex- indicates steam-activated samples after calcination; As presented in Figure 19, most catalysts show their highest C3H6 yields within the first few minutes on stream, and then deactivate rapidly within the first 20 min on stream. An excellent correlation between the increase in coke formation and decrease in C3H6 yield is observed, and based on such correlation it is hypothesized that coke formation is responsible for deactivation of the catalysts during the reaction. (182,183) Among the different zeolites tested, steam activated Fe-ZSM-5, with abundant extra-framework iron sites, presents the highest resistance to deactivation, and shows a C3H6 yield above 20% up to 75 min on stream. Even after 400 min on stream, it is able to maintain a C3H6 yield of 8%, unlike other catalysts that deactivate almost completely.

尽管其初始催化性能很高，但铁基沸石的主要缺点是焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活，这会导致C3H6产率迅速下降。[180-183]使用尖端元素振荡微平衡（TEOM）结合GC分析（图19）来展示如何在ODHP反应过程中，沸石催化剂失活。[182]值得注意的是，'c-'表示仅煅烧，'ex-'表示在煅烧后蒸汽激活的样品。根据图19所示，大多数催化剂在启动的前几分钟内表现出最高的C3H6产率，并且在最初的20分钟内快速失活。观察到焦炭形成的增加与C3H6产率的下降之间存在良好的相关性，据此假设焦炭形成是催化剂在反应期间失活的原因。[182,183]在测试的各种沸石中，蒸汽激活的Fe-ZSM-5，具有丰富的额外框架铁位点，显示出对失活的最高抵抗力，直到75分钟保持超过20%的C3H6产率。即使在400分钟后，它仍能维持8%的C3H6产率，而其他催化剂几乎完全失效。
