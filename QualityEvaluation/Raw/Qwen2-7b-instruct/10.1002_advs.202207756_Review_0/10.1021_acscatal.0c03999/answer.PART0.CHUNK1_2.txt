[1] "To establish the correlation between activity and Ga2O3 polymorphs, Zheng et al. have evaluated the activity performance of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs for CO2ODHP."
[2] "β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5)."
[3] "The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3."
[4] "On the other hand, surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8."
[5] "Combined with the weak reducibility of Ga2O3 (15 mol % of the fresh Ga2O3) and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ in catalysts (XPS), one can postulate that the reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP but only at the initial stage of the reaction."
[6] "At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle."
[7] "As proposed in Figure 10, reactions on Ce0.25Zr0.25Al0.5Ox proceed through a combined Mars van Krevelen (MvK) and RWGS mechanism linked by a common step."
[8] "Clearly, there is a synergistic effect on Fe3Ni1 (i.e., C3H6 yield = 1.6%) in comparison to the simple sum of yields on the monometallic counterpart (e.g., 0.4% and 0.2% for Ni1 and Fe3, respectively)."
[9] "It is reported that isolated VOx sites tend to be more selective toward C3H6, while more polymerized VOx species lead to drop in selectivity."
