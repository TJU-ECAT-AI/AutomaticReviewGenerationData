Of note, FT-IR spectroscopy, along with NO adsorption, is commonly used to characterize active sites for Fe-containing catalysts. For samples without calcination (Fe-MFI-24G), NO adsorption results in a broad band at 1850 cm1, indicating mononitrosyl on ferrous ions in the straight channels of ZSM-5. When samples are calcined at high temperatures, two strong bands at 1875 and 1890 cm1 are observed in the IR spectra. The band at 1875 cm1 corresponds to the mononitrosyl species on extra-framework Fe2+OAl sites; the other band at 1890 cm1 is assigned to the mononitrosyl species on isolated ferrous ions located on γ sites of the ZSM-5 structure. The band observed at 1810 cm1 is assigned to poly nitrosyl species on ferrous ion sites. As initial adsorption of NO on Fe-MFI-1173 results in the emergence of a band at 1875 cm1, it is hypothesized that both bands at 1810 and 1875 cm1 come from the same ferrous species, namely isolated extra-framework Fe2+OAl species. Clearly, calcining Fe-MFI-24G samples leads to the transformation of iron sites from isolated ions to isolated extra-framework FeOAl species. Figure 18B shows the C3H6 yield during N2O-mediated ODHP for samples calcined at different temperatures. An increase in C3H6 yield is observed as the calcination temperature rises from 600 C (Fe-MFI-24G-873) to 800 C (Fe-MFI-24G-1073), while the samples calcined at 800 (Fe-MFI-24G-1073) and 900 C (Fe-MFI-24G-1173) show similar highest C3H6 yields between 27% and 30%.

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Research on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. The FT-IR spectroscopy, along with NO adsorption, is a common technique to characterize active Ga species in these catalysts. Without calcination, the NO adsorption results in a broad band at 1850 cm1, indicating mononitrosyl on ferrous ions. Calcination at high temperatures transforms the iron sites from isolated ions to isolated extra-framework FeOAl species, which leads to an increase in C3H6 yield. Samples calcined at temperatures of 800 and 900 C showed similar highest C3H6 yields between 27% and 30%.

对丙烯日益增长的需求推动了新型生产方法的发展，包括丙烷脱氢（PDH）。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的研究已经取得了显著进展。使用FT-IR光谱结合NO吸附是常用的方法来表征这些催化剂中的活性Ga物种。未经煅烧处理时，NO吸附在1850 cm1位置产生一个宽峰，这表明铁离子上存在单硝基化物。高温煅烧后，铁位点从孤立离子转变为孤立的额外框架FeOAl物种，导致C3H6产率增加。在800°C和900°C煅烧的样品显示出相似的最高C3H6产率，在27%-30%之间。
