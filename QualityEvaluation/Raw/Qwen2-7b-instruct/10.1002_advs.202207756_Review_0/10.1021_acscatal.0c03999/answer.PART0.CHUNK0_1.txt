[1] "There has been significant progress in the development of catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants, including CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogens/halides."
[2] "Among these, CO2-/NOx-assisted ODHP reactions have been mostly studied, with significant efforts aimed at developing supported metal oxide catalysts including redox-type transition metal oxides (e.g., chromium, vanadium, and iron) (5,1820) and main group metal oxides with nonredox property (e.g., gallium)."
[3] "Catalytic performance has been found to strongly depend on the dispersion of active species and the nature of the support."
[4] "In the present Review, we start with a thermodynamic analysis of ODHP with various soft oxidants, then endeavor to cover the progress in ODHP with each soft oxidant, with emphasis on the following aspects: (i) the relationship between composition, structure, and catalytic performance, presenting the composition-induced molecular structure and active sites of catalysts in correlation with observed kinetic behavior; (ii) the influence of the nature of the support and its acidity on the activity and selectivity; and (iii) mechanistic insights, using the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and catalytic performance in conjunction with theoretical calculations to provide an overview of the working principles of ODHP reactions for different soft oxidants."
[5] "A perspective on future research opportunities is also provided at the very end."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by necessitating the exploration of alternative and sustainable processes. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through extensive research. The active Ga species debate has been a central focus, with studies suggesting that Ga is dispersed on the zeolite surface, playing a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process. Recent research has contributed to the current knowledge by elucidating the specific interactions between Ga and the zeolite framework, as well as the precise mechanisms by which Ga activates and deactivates during the PDH process. This has provided insights into optimizing the catalyst's performance and stability, leading to more efficient PDH operations.
