1. Some studies have tested cobalt- and manganese-containing MFI catalysts for N2OODHP, but these catalysts are less active than iron-containing ZSM-5 catalysts, with insufficient data to confirm their performance definitively.

2. Iron-containing zeolites face a major drawback of deactivation by coke formation, which leads to a rapid decrease in the yield of C3H6.

3. Grunert et al. used FT-IR analysis and NO adsorption to characterize Fe species in Fe-ZSM-5, supporting the hypothesis that these species are active in N2OODHP.

4. Calcination of Fe-MFI-24G samples results in the transformation of iron sites from isolated ions to isolated extra-framework FeOAl species.

5. The mechanism proposed for N2OODHP includes several steps involving the transformation of FeOAl species.

6. Research on cobalt- and manganese-containing MFI catalysts for N2OODHP is limited, with reported lower activity compared to iron-containing ZSM-5 catalysts, but definitive conclusions are lacking due to insufficient data.

7. Studies have been conducted on cobalt- and manganese-containing MFI catalysts for N2OODHP, but their performance is generally less than that of iron-containing ZSM-5 catalysts, with the need for more comprehensive data to confirm their effectiveness.

1. 一些研究测试了钴和锰基的MFI催化剂用于N2OODHP，但这些催化剂在N2OODHP中的活性低于铁基的ZSM-5催化剂，缺乏足够的数据来确定它们的性能。

2. 铁基沸石存在由焦炭形成导致的活性下降问题，这会迅速降低C3H6的产率。

3. 格伦特等人使用FT-IR分析和NO吸附来表征Fe-ZSM-5中的Fe物种，支持这些物种在N2OODHP中的活性假说。

4. 焙烧后的Fe-MFI-24G样品导致铁位点从孤立离子转变为孤立的额外框架FeOAl物种的转变。

5. 提出的N2OODHP机制包括几个步骤，涉及FeOAl物种的转化。

6. 对于钴和锰基MFI催化剂在N2OODHP中的研究相对有限，报道的活性普遍低于铁基的ZSM-5催化剂，但要得出明确结论，需要更多的数据支持。

7. 对钴和锰基MFI催化剂进行了N2OODHP的研究，但它们的性能一般低于铁基的ZSM-5催化剂，需要更多的全面数据来确认其有效性。
