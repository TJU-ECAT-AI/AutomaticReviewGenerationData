[1] "Early efforts have been put forth to modify the acidbase properties of Ga2O3 catalysts by introducing alkali metal oxides such as K."
[2] "Clearly, there is a synergistic effect on Fe3Ni1 (i.e., C3H6 yield = 1.6%) in comparison to the simple sum of yields on the monometallic counterpart (e.g., 0.4% and 0.2% for Ni1 and Fe3, respectively)."
[3] "Clearly, not only can CO2 contribute to the coke removal, but it can also inhibit coking, benefiting the overall stability of Cr catalysts for CO2ODHP."
[4] "For weakly acidic supports, like silica, adsorption of C3H6 does not occur well, so very small change in selectivity despite change in the exposed support surface area."

1. Efforts have been made to alter the acidbase properties of Ga2O3 catalysts by incorporating alkali metal oxides such as potassium (K).
2. There is a synergistic effect between iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni) in catalysts like Fe3Ni1, enhancing the C3H6 yield beyond the sum of individual contributions from Fe3 and Ni1.
3. Carbon deposits can be removed and prevented from forming on chromium (Cr) catalysts for CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) when carbon dioxide (CO2) is present.
4. Silica, being a weakly acidic support, does not significantly adsorb C3H6, leading to minimal changes in selectivity despite variations in the exposed surface area of the support.

1. 已经尝试通过引入碱金属氧化物，如钾（K），来改变Ga2O3催化剂的酸碱性质。
2. 在Fe3Ni1这类催化剂中，铁和镍之间存在协同效应，使得C3H6产率远超单个Fe3和Ni1贡献之和。
3. 在CO2氧化脱氢反应中，碳二亚甲基可以通过去除和抑制沉积来提高铬催化剂的整体稳定性。
4. 硅酸盐作为弱酸性支撑，对C3H6的吸附不明显，导致尽管支持表面面积发生变化，选择性变化也较小。
