[1] "The major roles of soft oxidants include inhibiting overoxidation and improving propylene selectivity, which are considered to be current challenges in O2-assisted dehydrogenation."
[2] "There have been several excellent reviews regarding ODHP with CO2 as an oxidant. Most of them have concentrated on the feasibility of utilizing CO2 as an oxidant for multiple reactions but fewer focused on the details of the ODHP reaction."
[3] "Catalytic performance has been found to strongly depend on the dispersion of active species and the nature of the support."
[4] "The thermodynamic restraint of S2ODHP is lower than that of N2OODHP (i.e., ΔG175C = 0.4 kJ mol1)."
[5] "HI oxidation is thermodynamically more favorable than the rest, rendering it an outstanding candidate among the halogens in the case of the halo-dehydrogenation reaction."

1. The growing demand for propylene has prompted the development of new production methods, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This has led to an increased focus on catalysts that can efficiently convert propane to propylene with minimal overoxidation and high propylene selectivity. The use of soft oxidants like carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfur-containing compounds, and halogens/halides has become a key area of investigation due to their potential in addressing these challenges.

2. Reviews on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant have predominantly emphasized the feasibility of utilizing CO2 for various reactions. However, there is a need for more detailed exploration of the specifics related to the ODHP reaction itself, including the role of different soft oxidants and catalysts.

3. The performance of catalysts in PDH is significantly influenced by the dispersion of active species and the characteristics of the support material. Understanding these factors is crucial for optimizing catalyst efficiency and selectivity.

4. The thermodynamic restraint of sulfur-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (SO2ODHP) is less stringent than that of nitrogen dioxide-assisted ODHP (N2OODHP). This suggests that SO2ODHP might offer a more favorable thermodynamic environment for propylene production.

5. Among halogens, hydrogen iodide (HI) stands out as the most thermodynamically favorable for dehydrogenation reactions, making it a promising candidate in halogen-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，新的生产方法，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），得到了发展。这导致了对能够有效转化丙烷为丙烯并减少过氧化和提高丙烯选择性的催化剂的重视。软氧化剂，如二氧化碳（CO2）、一氧化二氮（N2O）、含硫化合物和卤素/卤化物，成为了研究的重点领域。

2. 关于使用二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的综述主要关注了利用CO2进行多种反应的可能性，但较少聚焦于ODHP反应本身的细节。

3. 催化剂在PDH中的性能受到活性物种分散性和支撑材料特性的显著影响。理解这些因素对于优化催化剂效率和选择性至关重要。

4. 硫辅助的氧化脱氢化丙烷（SO2ODHP）的热力学约束低于氮氧化物辅助的ODHP（N2OODHP）。这意味着SO2ODHP可能提供一个更有利于丙烯生产的热力学环境。

5. 在卤素中，氢碘酸（HI）因其在脱氢反应中极高的热动力学优势而成为卤素促进氧化脱氢过程的一个有前景的候选者。
