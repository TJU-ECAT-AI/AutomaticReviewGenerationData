The research aims to utilize atomic layer deposition (ALD) to create highly dispersed zinc oxide (ZnO) species on ZSM-5 and Y zeolites. The study investigates the physical and chemical characteristics of ALD ZnO-modified zeolites using various techniques such as mass gain analysis, physical adsorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), pyridine adsorption Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (Py-IR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The catalytic activities of these modified zeolites are assessed in propane dehydrogenation and aromatization processes. The results indicate that ALD ZnO catalysts produced with 1 or 2 cycles perform better than those made with multiple cycles, suggesting that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for converting propane to propylene and aromatics.

本研究旨在利用原子层沉积（ALD）在ZSM-5和Y沸石上生成高度分散的锌氧化物（ZnO）物种。通过各种方法，如质量增益分析、物理吸附、扫描电子显微镜（SEM）、X射线衍射（XRD）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、温度程序还原（TPR）、吡啶吸附傅里叶变换红外光谱（Py-IR）和热重分析（TGA），研究了ALD ZnO修饰沸石的物理和化学性质。评估了这些改性沸石在丙烷脱氢和芳构化过程中的催化性能。结果表明，仅使用1或2次ALD循环制成的ALD ZnO催化剂比多循环制成的催化剂表现更好，这表明孤立的Zn(OH)+物种对于将丙烷转化为丙烯和芳香烃更为有效。
