[1] "For the ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite, small peaks corresponding to [101] and [110] crystal planes of ZnO can be observed at 2y = 36.2 and 56.51."
[2] "The intensities of the peaks at low diffraction angles (2y = 5151) are reduced. It has been demonstrated that the reduced peak intensity at low diffraction angles is attributed to foreign species (in this case, ZnO) incorporated inside the channels of the zeolites rather than collapse of the zeolitic framework."
[3] "The average sizes of the ZnO crystals are estimated to be 710 nm."
[4] "These ZnO crystals are probably generated through dehydration between adjacent ZnOH sites."

The ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite shows the presence of ZnO crystals with [101] and [110] crystal planes, evident at 2y angles of 36.2 and 56.51, respectively. The reduced intensities of the diffraction peaks at low angles indicate the incorporation of ZnO within the zeolite's channels. The average size of these ZnO crystals is approximately 710 nanometers, suggesting they are formed through dehydration between neighboring ZnOH sites.

ALD锌氧化合物修饰的Y沸石中可以观察到晶格为[101]和[110]的锌氧化合物晶体，分别在2y角度为36.2和56.51。低角度处衍射峰强度的降低表明，锌氧化合物被集成到了沸石的通道中，并非是骨架结构的坍塌。这些锌氧化合物晶体的平均大小约为710纳米，这表明它们是通过相邻的ZnOH位点脱水形成。
