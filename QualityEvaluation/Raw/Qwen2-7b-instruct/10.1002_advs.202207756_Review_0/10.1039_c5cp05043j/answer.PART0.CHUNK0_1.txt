This study explores the utilization of zeolites as acid catalysts in the petroleum refining and petrochemical industries, with a particular emphasis on the effectiveness of zinc-modified zeolites in dehydrogenation and aromatization processes. Various methods, including wet chemistry-based techniques, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and atomic layer deposition (ALD), are employed to incorporate zinc species into zeolites, leading to the formation of isolated Zn2+ or Zn(OH)+ cations, binuclear or multinuclear clusters, and bulk ZnO. The ALD process utilizes a homemade system based on designs by Elam and George, and the characterization methods employed include X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), pyridine adsorption Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (Py-IR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). These methods are utilized to assess the catalytic performance of zinc-modified zeolites in propane conversion, focusing on the dehydrogenation and aromatization of propane to propylene and aromatics, respectively.
