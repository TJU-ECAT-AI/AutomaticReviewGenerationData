Catalytic properties of Ga-containing MFI-type zeolite in cyclohexane dehydrogenation and propane aromatization
Three series of gallium-containing MFI zeolite were prepared with different gallium content by weight, by hydrothermal synthesis [Ga]-MFI (0.24.7 wt% Ga), ion exchange Ga/P (0.56.8 wt% Ga) and mechanical mixture Ga+P (0.510 wt% Ga).

Surprisingly, the catalytic performance of Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts is similar to that of Ga+ZSM-5 catalysts [15] and slightly higher than that of [Ga]-MFI catalysts [16,17].

The catalyst efficiency was evaluated by cyclohexane transformation and propane aromatization. Cyclohexane dehydrogenation will allow characterization of the dehydrogenating function of the gallium-based catalysts.

The aluminosilicates doped with Ga are more active in both cyclohexane dehydrogenation and propane aromatization than the gallosilicates: the gallium in the framework is much less active than gallium in the exchange position.

Regardless of the preparation method (MM or IE), the acidic properties (nature and concentration of acid sites) are strongly modified during the hydrogen treatment at high temperature (873 K). The changes are more important on Ga/P than on Ga + P series. The reduction leads to the appearance of new sites able to coordinate with pyridine (PyL) concomitant with the disappearance of Brnsted acid sites (PyH+).

The coke formation is more rapid on the less acidic bifunctional catalysts, and in the case of the gallosilicate catalyst, coke appears practically as a primary product.

The presence of intracrystalline mesopores can be a good option for mitigating the coke toxicity by limiting its growth in the zeolite micropores, owing to better diffusion of coke precursors.

The temperature used for the pre-treatment of [Ga]-MFI catalysts (873 K) is too low to cause the degallation and formation of extra-framework gallium species [11]. Hence, the framework gallium in the [Ga]-MFI series is less active than the extra-framework gallium present in the reduced Ga + P and Ga/P series.

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was confusion about the active Ga species in these catalysts, but recent research has clarified this issue. The key finding is that the active Ga species are those located in the exchange position rather than in the zeolite framework. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the aluminosilicates doped with Ga are more active in both cyclohexane dehydrogenation and propane aromatization than the gallosilicates. The gallium in the framework is much less active than gallium in the exchange position. 

During the hydrogen treatment at high temperature (873 K), the acidic properties of the catalysts are modified. The changes are more pronounced on the Ga/P series compared to the Ga + P series. The reduction process leads to the creation of new acid sites (Lewis acid sites) while eliminating the Brnsted acid sites. 

Coke formation is a critical issue in PDH processes. It is more rapid on less acidic catalysts, particularly on the gallosilicate catalysts. This highlights the importance of the acidity level in controlling coke formation. 

To mitigate the toxicity of coke, the presence of intracrystalline mesopores can be beneficial. These pores offer a better diffusion pathway for coke precursors, preventing the growth of coke within the zeolite micropores.

The effectiveness of the Ga + P and Ga/P catalysts is superior to that of the [Ga]-MFI series. This is because the gallium in the framework of the [Ga]-MFI series is less active than the gallium in the exchange position of the Ga + P and Ga/P catalysts. This finding underscores the importance of the location of gallium species for catalytic activity.

丙烯需求的增长已经推动了新的生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解也有了显著的进步。最初，关于活性Ga物种的问题存在混淆，但最近的研究已经澄清了这个问题。关键发现是活性Ga物种位于交换位置而不是在沸石框架中。这一结论得到了证实，即掺杂Ga的铝硅酸盐比含镓硅酸盐更活跃，在环己烷脱氢和丙烷芳构化两个过程中都表现出更高的活性。框架中的镓活性远低于交换位置的镓。

在高温氢处理（873 K）期间，催化剂的酸性性质发生了改变。变化更为明显的是Ga/P系列而非Ga + P系列。还原过程导致新酸位（Lewis酸位）的产生同时消除了Brnsted酸位。

焦炭形成是PDH过程中的一大问题。在较低酸性的催化剂上，焦炭形成更为迅速，特别是对于含镓硅酸盐催化剂而言。这强调了酸度水平对控制焦炭形成的重要性。

为了降低焦炭的毒性，晶体内的介孔可以是一个好选择。这些孔道提供了焦炭前体更好的扩散途径，从而防止焦炭在沸石微孔中的生长。

Ga + P和Ga/P催化剂的有效性优于[Ga]-MFI系列。这是因为[Ga]-MFI系列中的框架镓活性低于Ga + P和Ga/P催化剂中位于交换位置的镓。这一发现突显了镓物种位置对于催化活性的重要性。
