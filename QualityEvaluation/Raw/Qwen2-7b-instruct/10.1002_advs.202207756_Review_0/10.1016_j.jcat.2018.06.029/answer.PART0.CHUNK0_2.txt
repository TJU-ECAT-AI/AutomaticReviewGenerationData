[1] "Three series of gallium-containing MFI zeolite were prepared with different gallium content by weight,by hydrothermal synthesis [Ga]-MFI (0.24.7 wt% Ga), ion exchange Ga/P (0.56.8 wt% Ga) and mechan- ical mixture Ga+P (0.510 wt% Ga)."
[2] "Under hydrogen at 600 C on the aluminosilicate doped with gallium,a reducing solid ionic exchange occurs between a mobile species (Ga2O) and the protonic sites of the zeo- lite."
[3] "The proportion of Ga implied in this exchange depends on both the proximity between Ga2O3 and the zeolite and the initial gallium content."
[4] "The aluminosilicates doped with Ga are more active in both cyclohexane dehydrogenation and propane aromatization than the gallosilicates: the gallium in the framework is much less active than gallium in the exchange position."
[5] "Regardless of the preparation method (MM or IE), the acidic properties (nature and concentration of acid sites) are strongly modified during the hydrogen treatment at high temperature (873 K)."
[6] "The concentration of Brnsted acid sites on gallosilicate is slightly higher (363 molg1) than the one observed for Ga + P or Ga/P catalysts, although the number of Ga atoms is two times higher (Si/Ga = 23) than that of Al atoms (Si/Al = 40)."
[7] "The main difference concerns the coke quantity in the catalysts,which ranks as follows: [Ga]-MFI  Ga/P > Ga + P."
[8] "The coke, which is heavy, is also extremely toxic."

1. Three series of gallium-containing MFI zeolite were prepared with varying gallium contents through hydrothermal synthesis, ion exchange, and mechanical mixture.

2. At 600°C under hydrogen, a reducing solid ionic exchange takes place between gallium oxide and protonic sites of the zeolite.

3. The proportion of gallium involved in the exchange is influenced by the proximity of gallium oxide to the zeolite and the initial gallium content.

4. Gallium-doped aluminosilicates exhibit greater activity in cyclohexane dehydrogenation and propane aromatization compared to gallosilicates, with the gallium in the framework being less active than that in the exchange position.

5. Regardless of whether the catalyst was prepared by mechanical mixing (MM) or ion exchange (IE), the acidic properties were significantly altered during the high-temperature hydrogen treatment.

6. The concentration of Brnsted acid sites on gallosilicates is slightly higher (363 mol/g) than those on Ga + P or Ga/P catalysts, even though there are twice as many gallium atoms (Si/Ga = 23) relative to aluminum atoms (Si/Al = 40).

7. The coke quantity varies across the catalyst types, ranking as follows: [Ga]-MFI > Ga/P > Ga + P.

8. The heavy coke produced is highly toxic.

1. 制备了三种不同镓含量的MFI沸石系列，通过水热合成、离子交换和机械混合。

2. 在600°C的氢气环境下，镓氧化物与沸石上的质子化位点之间发生还原固体离子交换。

3. 镓在交换中的比例受到镓氧化物与沸石之间的距离以及初始镓含量的影响。

4. 镓掺杂的铝硅酸盐在环己烷脱氢和丙烷芳构化反应中比镓硅酸盐更为活跃，框架中的镓活性低于交换位置的镓。

5. 不论是通过机械混合（MM）还是离子交换（IE）制备催化剂，在高温氢处理后其酸性性质都会显著改变。

6. 镓硅酸盐的Brnsted酸性位点浓度略高于Ga + P或Ga/P催化剂，尽管镓原子数量是铝原子的两倍（Si/Ga = 23）。

7. 催化剂中的焦炭量存在差异，排名如下：[Ga]-MFI > Ga/P > Ga + P。

8. 产生的重焦炭具有高度毒性。
