          [1] "Three series of gallium-containing MFI zeolite were prepared with different gallium content by weight,by hydrothermal synthesis [Ga]-MFI (0.24.7 wt% Ga), ion exchange Ga/P (0.56.8 wt% Ga) and mechanical mixture Ga+P (0.510 wt% Ga)."
          [2] "Under hydrogen at 600 C on the aluminosilicate doped with gallium,a reducing solid ionic exchange occurs between a mobile species (Ga2O) and the protonic sites of the zeo- lite."
          [3] "Regardless of the method used, the oxi- dation state of gallium is always +3."
          [4] "The catalytic performance (activity, selectivity, and stability) is slightly influenced by the mode of preparation used, as the real bifunctional catalyst is pre- pared in situ during the pretreatment under hydrogen [18,19]."
          [5] "Surprisingly, the catalytic performance of Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts is similar to that of Ga+ZSM-5 catalysts [15] and slightly higher than that of [Ga]-MFI catalysts [16,17]."
          [6] "The acidic properties (nature and concentration of acid sites) are strongly modified during the hydrogen treatment at high temperature (873 K)."
          [7] "The total disappearance of the bridging OH (Fig. 3) does not imply that of Brnsted acid sites; they decrease partially and not totally (Table 3)."
          [8] "The concentration of created LAS is proportional to the concentration of gallium, which is higher on IE than on MM series (Fig. 4)."
          [9] "On the two catalyst ser- ies, the concentrations of created Lewis acid sites (LAS) are propor- tional to the concentration of gallium, which is higher on IE than on MM series (Fig. 4)."
          [10] "The reductive solid ionic exchange occurs up to complete exchange with the bridged OH groups (Fig. 3), after which the nanoparticles of gallium oxide accumulate on the external surface (crystal) of the zeolite (Fig. 1)."
          [11] "The proportion of gallium in the IE series that migrates and reacts with the BAS remains limited despite a strong proximity between Ga2O3 and the zeolite: only a quarter on the least loaded catalyst (Table 3)."
          [12] "For a gallium content of 0.4 wt% in the zeolite, the aromatic yield is six times higher on catalyst with extra-framework gallium species than with Ga located into the framework."

          1. Three series of gallium-containing MFI zeolites were synthesized using hydrothermal synthesis, ion exchange, and mechanical mixture methods with varying gallium contents.
          2. During the reduction treatment at 600°C, a solid ionic exchange occurs between gallium species (Ga2O) and protonic sites of the zeolite.
          3. The oxidation state of gallium is consistently +3 across all synthesis methods.
          4. The catalytic performance is somewhat affected by the preparation method, as the actual bifunctional catalyst is synthesized in place during hydrogen pretreatment.
          5. The catalytic performance of Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts is comparable to Ga+ZSM-5 catalysts and slightly superior to [Ga]-MFI catalysts.
          6. The acidic properties of the catalysts significantly change during the high-temperature hydrogen treatment.
          7. The disappearance of bridging OH groups does not fully eliminate Brnsted acid sites; their concentration decreases partially.
          8. The number of created Lewis acid sites is directly proportional to the gallium concentration, being higher in the ion exchange series compared to the mechanical mixture series.
          9. The concentrations of created Lewis acid sites on the two catalyst series are proportional to the gallium concentration, with a higher concentration in the ion exchange series.
          10. The reductive solid ionic exchange reaches complete exchange with bridged OH groups, leading to accumulation of gallium oxide nanoparticles on the zeolite surface.
          11. The migration and reaction of gallium with Brnsted acid sites is limited in the ion exchange series, with a quarter reacting on the least loaded catalyst.
          12. For a 0.4 wt% gallium content in the zeolite, aromatic yield is six times higher on catalysts with extra-framework gallium species compared to gallium located in the framework.
