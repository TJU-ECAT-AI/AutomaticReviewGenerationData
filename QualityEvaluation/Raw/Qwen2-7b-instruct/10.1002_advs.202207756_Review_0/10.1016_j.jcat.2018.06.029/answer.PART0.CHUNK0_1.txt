[1] "The propane aromatization process, developed 40 years ago, runs with a bifunctional catalyst based on gallium and MFI zeolite."
[2] "Ga-MFI catalyst can be synthetized in several manners: wetness impregnation (Ga-HZSM-5) [24], ion exchange (Ga/HZSM-5) [58], mechanical mixture of Ga2O3 and protonated MFI-type zeolite (Ga+HZSM-5) [9,10], hydrothermal synthesis ([Ga]-MFI) [1113], etc."
[3] "Regardless of the method used, the oxidation state of gallium is always +3."
[4] "The catalytic performance (activity, selectivity, and stability) is slightly influenced by the mode of preparation used, as the real bifunctional catalyst is prepared in situ during the pretreatment under hydrogen [18,19]."
[5] "This study focuses on the influence of the content and location of gallium in the MFI zeolite (in, on, or outside), on the efficiency of the reductive solid ionic exchange, and therefore on the catalytic performance of such bifunctional catalysts."
[6] "The catalyst efficiency was evaluated by cyclohexane transformation and propane aromatization."
[7] "The main difference concerns the coke quantity in the catalysts, which ranks as follows: [Ga]-MFI > Ga/P > Ga + P."
[8] "Surprisingly, the coke formation is more rapid on the less acidic bifunctional catalysts, and in the case of the gallosilicate catalyst, coke appears practically as a primary product."
[9] "The behavior of Ga + P and Ga/P series is similar: fast initial increase of the propane conversion with the gallium content up to a maximum of 40% at 2.5 wt% Ga, followed by a slow decrease of conversion."
[10] "The effect of the gallium content on the bifunctional catalysts prepared by ionic exchange or by mechanical mixture in the propane aromatization leads to similar product yields (Fig. 11B); all the yields increase with the gallium content to reach a plateau more or less rapidly."

1. The development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes, particularly focusing on the use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, has been driven by the growing demand for propylene, a key component in the petrochemical industry. This catalyst has evolved significantly, with researchers exploring various synthesis methods, including hydrothermal synthesis, ion exchange, and mechanical mixture, to optimize its performance. The understanding of Ga species' roles and their locations within the catalyst has been crucial in enhancing the catalytic efficiency.

2. The catalytic performance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is influenced by the preparation method, with slight variations in activity, selectivity, and stability observed. However, these differences are minimal, as the actual bifunctional catalyst is formed during in-situ pretreatment under hydrogen. The study focuses on the impact of gallium content and location within the MFI zeolite on the efficiency of reductive solid ionic exchange and thus the catalyst's overall performance.

3. The catalysts are evaluated based on their ability to transform cyclohexane and aromatize propane. The coke formation is notably higher in gallosilicate catalysts compared to those containing gallium in the zeolite framework. Less acidic catalysts, like those with gallium in the zeolite, exhibit lower coke formation rates.

4. The Ga + P and Ga/P catalyst series show a similar pattern in propane conversion, with a sharp rise up to 40% at a gallium content of 2.5 wt%, followed by a gradual decline. The product yields across the series increase with gallium content until they reach a plateau, demonstrating a consistent trend in catalytic performance.

1. 对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程的发展，特别是Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的应用，受到了对丙烯日益增长的需求的驱动。通过研究不同合成方法（如水浸渍、离子交换、机械混合和水热合成）以优化催化剂性能，这一催化剂的演变取得了显著进展。理解Ga物种的作用及其在催化剂中的位置对于提高催化效率至关重要。

2. Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的催化性能受制备方法的影响，表现出轻微的差异，包括活性、选择性和稳定性的变化。然而，这些差异较小，因为实际的双功能催化剂是在氢气中进行原位预处理时形成的。本研究关注了镓含量和位置对MFI沸石中还原固体离子交换效率的影响，进而影响此类双功能催化剂的整体性能。

3. 催化剂根据其对环己烷的转化能力和丙烷的芳构化能力进行评估。与含镓的沸石催化剂相比，含镓的沸石框架催化剂中的焦炭形成量更高。较低酸性催化剂，即含镓的沸石中，焦炭的形成率较低。

4. Ga + P和Ga/P催化剂系列在丙烷转化方面显示出了相似的趋势，随着镓含量从2.5 wt%达到峰值的40%，转化率迅速上升，然后逐渐下降。随着镓含量的增加，产品产率直到达到平台期，显示出一致的催化性能趋势。
