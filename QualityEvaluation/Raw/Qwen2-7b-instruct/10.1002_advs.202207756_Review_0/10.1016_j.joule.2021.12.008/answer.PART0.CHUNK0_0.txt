[1] "At present, thermal steam cracking is the most mature industrial process to produce light olefins, which is highly energy-intensive and a significant emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2)."
[2] "However, the presence of O2 as a co-reactant also facilitates deep oxidation to carbon oxides (i.e., CO and CO2), thus lowering olefin product selectivity."
[3] "Since O2-ODHE is an exothermic process, the required heat input can be provided by the reaction itself, so minimal external energy is required."
[4] "It is noted that these values also include emissions associated with the compression, recovery, and separation sections of the process, which were not quantified for the dehydrogenation processes in this study due to the lack of available reference data."
[5] "Although several catalysts have already been reported in the literature with >80% selectivity toward olefins,9 extensive formation of CO and CO2 is often observed at higher alkane conversions."
[6] "Therefore, it may be beneficial to use the CO2-ethane reaction as the feedstock source in tandem thermochemical processes."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), aiming to enhance efficiency and reduce environmental impact. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, especially concerning the active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to the clarification of the role of these catalysts in the PDH process, highlighting the importance of their structure and composition. The ongoing debate about the active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts continues, with new insights suggesting that the active sites for propylene production are more complex than initially thought. This complexity involves not just the Ga species but also the interactions within the zeolite framework, leading to improved selectivity and activity. These advancements contribute to the current knowledge of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize their performance and enhance the sustainability of PDH processes.
