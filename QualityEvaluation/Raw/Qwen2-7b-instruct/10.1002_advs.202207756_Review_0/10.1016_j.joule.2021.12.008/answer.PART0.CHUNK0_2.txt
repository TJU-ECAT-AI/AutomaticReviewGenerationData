[1] "The utilization of light alkanes to generate value-added chemicals has gained significant attention due to the U.S. shale gas boom in recent decades."
[2] "For example, after methane, ethane (316 vol.%) and propane (up to 5 vol.%) are the most abundant hydrocarbon species in shale gas deposits."
[3] "These inexpensive, widely available, but often underutilized, light alkanes can be used as a feedstock to produce olefins, which are among the most important petrochemical building blocks in chemical industry."
[4] "At present, thermal steam cracking is the most mature industrial process to produce light olefins, which is highly energy-intensive and a significant emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2)."
[5] "CO2-ODH is an overall endothermic reaction, although CO2 is consumed as a co-reactant in CO2-ODH as opposed to being generated in O2-ODH."
[6] "The general trends in Figure 2 B are similar to the ethylene-normalized results in Figure 2 A, although the absolute values and crossover points are different."
[7] "Direct dehydrogenation can be competitive with the use of nearly carbon-free energy sources, but oxidative dehydrogenation pathways appear to have much greater potential in reducing CO2 emissions."
[8] "Furthermore, as illustrated in Figure 2, a CO2-ODHE process complemented by a dry reforming contribution produces both ethylene and syngas, which would have greater net negative CO2 emissions."

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), aiming to efficiently convert propane into propylene with minimized environmental impact. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through the exploration of active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to the current knowledge of these catalysts, emphasizing the importance of Ga species in the PDH process. While the debate about active Ga species continues, ongoing studies aim to optimize catalyst performance and enhance the selectivity towards propylene production. The development of efficient catalysts for PDH remains a key challenge and opportunity in the field of olefin production.
