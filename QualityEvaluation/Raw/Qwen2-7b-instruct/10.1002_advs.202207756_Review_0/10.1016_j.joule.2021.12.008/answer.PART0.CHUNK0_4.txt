[1] "The utilization of light alkanes to generate value-added chemicals has gained significant attention due to the U.S. shale gas boom in recent decades."
[2] "At present, thermal steam cracking is the most mature industrial process to produce light olefins, which is highly energy-intensive and a significant emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2)."
[3] "The non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of alkanes is able to produce olefins at lower process temperatures than that of steam cracking (usually above 1073 K)."
[4] "Alternatively, CO2 can be used as a soft oxidant for ODH (CO2-ODH). Although CO2-ODH is an overall endothermic reaction, CO2 is consumed as a co-reactant in CO2-ODH as opposed to being generated in O2-ODH."
[5] "For example, after methane, ethane (316 vol.%) and propane (up to 5 vol.%) are the most abundant hydrocarbon species in shale gas deposits."
[6] "In this analysis, net CO2 emissions were estimated based on the mass balances and energy requirements of the equilibrium processes discussed in Figure 1."
[7] "It is noted that these values also include emissions associated with the compression, recovery, and separation sections of the process, which were not quantified for the dehydrogenation processes in this study due to the lack of available reference data."
[8] "However, the steam cracking reaction alone, assuming zero emissions from fuel combustion or utilities, still emits 0.27 tons of CO2/tons of ethylene (0.17 moles of CO2/moles of ethylene)."
[9] "In comparison, concerted ODHE and ethane dry reforming reactions, as well as side reactions (e.g., reverse water-gas shift and reverse Boudouard reactions), are necessary to achieve the desirable feede.g., a stoichiometric ratio of C2H4/CO/H2 (1:1:1)for a downstream hydroformylation process, posing additional challenges for tuning catalyst selectivity."

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This technique allows for the conversion of propane into propylene, which is essential for the manufacturing of various petrochemical products. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, with the ongoing debate about the active Ga species and recent research findings contributing to our current knowledge of these catalysts.
