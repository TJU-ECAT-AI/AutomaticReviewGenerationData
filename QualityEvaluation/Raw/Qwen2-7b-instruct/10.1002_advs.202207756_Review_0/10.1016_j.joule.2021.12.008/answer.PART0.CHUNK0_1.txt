[1] "At present, thermal steam cracking is the most mature industrial process to produce light olefins, which is highly energy-intensive and a significant emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2)."
[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has also been studied as an alternative to the high-temperature steam cracking process."
[3] "Using O2 as the oxidant (O2-ODH) results in an exothermic reaction and significantly reduces the operating temperatures."
[4] "Alternatively, CO2 can be used as a soft oxidant for ODH (CO2-ODH). Although CO2-ODH is an overall endothermic reaction, CO2 is consumed as a co-reactant in CO2-ODH as opposed to being generated in O2-ODH."
[5] "For example, after methane, ethane (316 vol.%) and propane (up to 5 vol.%) are the most abundant hydrocarbon species in shale gas deposits."
[6] "These inexpensive, widely available, but often underutilized, light alkanes can be used as a feedstock to produce olefins, which are among the most important petrochemical building blocks in chemical industry."
[7] "Therefore, more sustainable methods of olefin production with lower energy consumption and reduced CO2 emissions are of great interest."
[8] "In this commentary, we perform a thermodynamic comparison of the DDH, O2-ODH, and CO2-ODH processes."
[9] "At completely carbon-free energy sources (0 kg of CO2 per kWh), the experimental CO2-ODHE consumes 1.5 moles of CO2 to produce 1 mole of ethylene (and 1.8 moles of CO)."
[10] "It is noted that conventional steam cracking itself would also benefit from reduced emissions if cleaner energy sources for heating and electricity are used."
[11] "However, the steam cracking reaction alone, assuming zero emissions from fuel combustion or utilities, still emits 0.27 tons of CO2/tons of ethylene (0.17 moles of CO2/moles of ethylene)."
[12] "O2-ODH can also be more attractive with fully optimized heat integration by utilizing the exothermic reaction heat to displace energy from fossil fuel-based sources."
[13] "Moreover, as illustrated in Figure 2, a CO2-ODHE process complemented by a dry reforming contribution produces both ethylene and syngas, which would have greater net negative CO2 emissions."
[14] "The direct production of liquid aromatics and oxygenates can reduce the energy cost associated with product separation and minimize safety risks during the transportation/storage of flammable ethylene and toxic syngas."
[15] "In comparison, concerted ODHE and ethane dry reforming reactions, as well as side reactions (e.g., reverse water-gas shift and reverse Boudouard reactions), are necessary to achieve the desirable feed-e.g., a stoichiometric ratio of C2H4/CO/H2 (1:1:1) for a downstream hydroformylation process, posing additional challenges for tuning catalyst selectivity."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species and recent research findings. The document does not directly discuss the specific evolution of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts or the active Ga species debate. However, it mentions that oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is an alternative to the high-temperature steam cracking process, which could imply advancements in catalyst technology, including Ga/H-ZSM-5, for more efficient and sustainable olefin production. The document focuses on the comparison of different dehydrogenation processes, such as direct dehydrogenation (DDH), O2-ODH, and CO2-ODH, rather than detailing the specifics of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH.

Answer: The development of new production methods for propylene, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), has been influenced by the growing demand for propylene. While the document discusses the advancements in catalyst technology for olefin production, it does not specifically address the evolution of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts or the active Ga species debate for PDH.

丙烯需求的增长已经推动了新型生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。对于GA/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解和应用也有了显著的进步，包括对活性GA物种的持续争论和最近的研究发现。文档并未直接讨论GA/H-ZSM-5催化剂的具体发展或活跃GA物种的争论。然而，它提到氧化脱氢（ODH）是高温蒸汽裂解过程的替代方案，这可能意味着催化剂技术的进步，包括GA/H-ZSM-5，以实现更高效和可持续的烯烃生产。文档的重点是不同脱氢过程的比较，如直接脱氢（DDH）、O2-ODH和CO2-ODH，而不是详细说明GA/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的具体应用。

答案：丙烯需求的增长已经推动了新型生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。尽管文档讨论了烯烃生产中催化剂技术的进步，但并未具体涉及GA/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的演变或活跃GA物种的争论。
