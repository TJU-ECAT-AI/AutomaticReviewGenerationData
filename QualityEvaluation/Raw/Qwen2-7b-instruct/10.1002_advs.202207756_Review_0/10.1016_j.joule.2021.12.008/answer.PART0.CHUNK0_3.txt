[1] "The utilization of light alkanes to generate value-added chemicals has gained significant attention due to the U.S. shale gas boom in recent decades."
[2] "These inexpensive, widely available, but often underutilized, light alkanes can be used as a feedstock to produce olefins, which are among the most important petrochemical building blocks in chemical industry."
[3] "The non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of alkanes is able to produce olefins at lower process temperatures than that of steam cracking (usually above 1073 K)."
[4] "Using O2 as the oxidant (O2-ODH) results in an exothermic reaction and significantly reduces the operating temperatures."
[5] "Alternatively, CO2 can be used as a soft oxidant for ODH (CO2-ODH). Although CO2-ODH is an overall endothermic reaction, CO2 is consumed as a co-reactant in CO2-ODH as opposed to being generated in O2-ODH."
[6] "For example, after methane, ethane (316 vol.%) and propane (up to 5 vol.%) are the most abundant hydrocarbon species in shale gas deposits."
[7] "At present, thermal steam cracking is the most mature industrial process to produce light olefins, which is highly energy-intensive and a significant emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2)."
[8] "Therefore, more sustainable methods of olefin production with lower energy consumption and reduced CO2 emissions are of great interest."
[9] "Net CO2 emissions were estimated based on the mass balances and energy requirements of the equilibrium processes discussed in Figure 1."
[10] "Similar to Figure 2 A, the lower red line in Figure 2 B also represents CO2-ODHE with the competing dry reforming reaction, illustrating the large amount of CO2 converted to CO relative to the amount of ethane converted."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in developing new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH utilizes propane to produce propylene, which is a key component in the production of plastics and other petrochemical products. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, with ongoing debates about the active Ga species involved. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, revealing insights into their structure and activity. This has led to improvements in catalyst design and performance, enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of PDH processes.
