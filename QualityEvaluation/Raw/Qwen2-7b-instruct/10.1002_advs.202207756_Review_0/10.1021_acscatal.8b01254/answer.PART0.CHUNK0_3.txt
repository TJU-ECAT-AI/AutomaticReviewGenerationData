The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This method has gained prominence due to its efficiency in converting propane into propylene. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts used in PDH processes has advanced over time, leading to debates on the nature of active Ga species. Recent research has provided valuable insights into these catalysts, enhancing our comprehension of their functionality and optimization potential.
