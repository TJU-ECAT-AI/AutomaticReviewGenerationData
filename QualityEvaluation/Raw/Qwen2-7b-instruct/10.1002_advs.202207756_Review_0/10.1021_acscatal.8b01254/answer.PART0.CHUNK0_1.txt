The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This method has become a key approach to meet the increasing need for propylene. The field's understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts used in PDH production has advanced over time. There remains an ongoing debate about the active Ga species involved, and recent research has added to our comprehension of these catalysts.
