The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This method has gained prominence due to its potential for efficiently producing propylene. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been widely studied for their application in PDH processes. However, the active species responsible for the catalytic activity in these catalysts is still under debate. Recent research findings have provided valuable insights into the nature of active Ga species within these catalysts, contributing to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in the PDH process and the role of Ga species within the catalyst structure.
