[1] "Propylene is a vital and basic building block and used for production of a variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid and acrylonitrile."
[2] "However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."
[3] "As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."
[4] "Zn-based catalysts have received more attention due to its low-cost and environment-friendly properties."
[5] "Both isolated Zn2+ species and nanosized ZnO assemblies were active for PDH reactions."
[6] "It was much more stable than the unpromoted ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst."
[7] "Recently, Li et al. contructed Zn-containing catalysts Zn@S-1 through in-situ hydrothermal synthesis for PDH reaction and the partially reduced zinc cations were identified as the active sites."
[8] "The presence of abundant defects makes S-1 widely used as catalyst support."
[9] "The 5%Zn/S-1 delivers a stable performance within a 6h PDH test and there is little coke detected."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to produce propylene with fewer byproducts. Research on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with debates about the active Ga species. Recent studies have contributed to our understanding by identifying partially reduced zinc cations as active sites in PDH reactions on Zn@S-1 catalysts. The use of catalyst supports with abundant defects, like silicalite-1 (S-1), enhances the stability and efficiency of PDH catalysts. The S-1 supported ZnO catalyst, specifically 5%Zn/S-1, demonstrated excellent PDH performance with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, showing stability over a 6-hour test period.

对丙烯的日益增长的需求推动了新的生产方法的发展，尤其是PDH（丙烷脱氢）工艺，以生产丙烯并减少副产品。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的研究已经发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论正在进行。最近的研究通过确定部分还原的锌离子作为PDH反应中Zn@S-1催化剂上的活性位点，为我们的理解做出了贡献。使用具有大量缺陷的催化剂载体，如S-1沸石，可以增强PDH催化剂的稳定性和效率。具体来说，5%Zn/S-1 S-1支持的ZnO催化剂展示了优秀的PDH性能，具有高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，并且在6小时测试期间表现出稳定性。
