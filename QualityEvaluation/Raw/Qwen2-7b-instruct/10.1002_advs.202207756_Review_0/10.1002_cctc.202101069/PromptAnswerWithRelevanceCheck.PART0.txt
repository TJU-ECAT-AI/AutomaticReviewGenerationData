Research on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with debates about the active Ga species. Recent studies have contributed to our understanding by identifying partially reduced zinc cations as active sites in PDH reactions on Zn@S-1 catalysts. The use of catalyst supports with abundant defects, like silicalite-1 (S-1), enhances the stability and efficiency of PDH catalysts.

Silicalite-1 supported ZnO catalysts were prepared by a simple impregnation method. The as-prepared catalysts exhibited an excellent catalytic activity and stability for PDH reaction. Dispersed ZnO species could be obtained and stabilized via interaction between silanol nests of silicalite-1 support and ZnO species. The interaction between silanol nests and ZnO species could suppress aggregation of ZnO species under reaction conditions.

Among Zn, V, Zr, Co and Fe-based catalysts,11-15 Zn-based catalysts have received more attention due to its low-cost and environment-friendly properties. Both isolated Zn2+ species and nanosized ZnO assemblies were active for PDH reactions.16 However, small ZnO assemblies were generally unstable especially under harsh reaction conditions17 and they were frequently dispersed and stabilized on supports. 

A high initial propylene selectivity ranging from 89.2% to 98.8% is achieved on Zn/S-1 catalysts with Zn loading from 1% to 5% with a small amount of methane, ethane, ethylene and C4+ species (Figure1b and TableS1).

Considering the thermodynamic constraints, PDH reactions were also carried out over 5%Zn/S-1 catalyst at different reaction temperatures of 500, 525, 550 and 575C. As shown in Figure3, the initial propane conversion significantly increases from 18.8% to 66.7% while propylene selectivity decreases with the stepwise increasing temperature. The propylene selectivity at 575C decreases significantly due to the facilitated side reactions at high temperature.25 Therefore, the most suitable temperature is chosen as 550C in order to achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity simultaneously.

The XRD patterns in Figure4 show that the S-1 zeolite exhibits a typical MFI structure. Its crystal structure remains unchanged after being supported with ZnO. No diffraction peaks corresponding to ZnO are observed for the catalysts with Zn loading up to 5%, suggesting that Zn species are well dispersed or existing as tiny ZnO particles which are beyond XRD detection limitation.26 However, at 10% loading, weak diffraction peaks attributed to ZnO appear, indicating the growth of Zn species.

N2 physisorption results (Table1) indicate that the specific surface area and pore volume gradually decrease with the increasing Zn loadings. Below 5% Zn loading, mainly the external surface area decreases, indicating that ZnO species are dispersed on the external surface. Meanwhile, it is reasonable to assume that some ZnO species deposit inside the zeolitic pores considering the slight decrease of microporous surface area.27 As the Zn loading further increases to 10%, both the external surface area and the microporous surface area decrease. This may be attributed to large ZnO particles at a high Zn loading blocking the pore openings of S-1.28

The DR UV-vis in Figure6 shows a band at around 370nm and a weak shoulder one at about 265nm upon introduction of zinc species to S-1 zeolite. These two bands are generally attributed to ZnO crystals on the external zeolite surface and subnanometric ZnO clusters inside zeolitic pores, respectively.29 Furthermore, the intensity of the 370nm band is enhanced with the increasing Zn loading, especially for Zn/S-1 catalyst with higher Zn loading such as 10%Zn/S-1 indicating enhanced formation of ZnO species on the external surface.

NH3-TPD and Py-IR are employed to characterize the acidic properties of the catalysts considering that Zn species exhibiting Lewis acidity are generally considered as active sites in PDH reaction.20 As shown in Figure7a and Table1, S-1 zeolite only has a slight signal of NH3 desorption, demonstrating its weak acidic property. However, the acid amount of catalysts is significantly improved after supporting ZnO with the desorption peaks of Zn/S-1 catalysts falling in similar temperature range from 100500C. The Py-IR spectra in Fig. 7b further show that the Zn/S-1 catalysts exhibit Lewis acidity, confirmed by the infrared band at 1453cm1 and no Brnsted acid sites (1540cm1) are decteted.30 The amounts of Lewis acid sites determined from the NH3 desorption amounts gradually increase with the increase of Zn loading. Concretely, the acid amount increase from 0.227mmol/g (1%Zn/S-1) to 0.416mmol/g (3%Zn/S-1), 0.484mmol/g (5%Zn/S-1) and 0.552 mmol/g (10%Zn/S-1).

The XPS spectra in Figure8 shows the spin-orbit splitting value of the Zn 2p peaks in Zn/S-1 is 23eV, which is typical for Zn2+,31 consistent with TEM and UV-vis results. In addition, the binding energy peaks of Zn 2p in Zn/S-1 is 1.1eV higher than that of ZnO (1045eV and 1022eV), suggesting that Zn2+ becomes more electron deficient.19 It indicates SiOZn exists considering that the electron density of Zn in the SiOZn bond is lower than that in the ZnOZn bond. The above result indicates interaction develops between the ZnO species and the support.32

29Si MAS NMR is further applied to explore the interaction between the ZnO species and S-1 zeolite. As shown in Figure9a, two signals are observed over S-1. The Q4 signal at 113ppm is generally assigned to Si(SiO)4 while the Q3 signal at around 103ppm is attributed to (SiOH)(SiO)3 group.33 After the introduction of Zn, the intensity of the 103ppm signal significantly declines, indicating the consumption of silanol groups by interaction with ZnO species. FT-IR is applied to characterize the hydroxyl groups on S-1 and Zn/S-1 catalysts. As shown in Figure9b, there are two major types of OH groups present for S-1 zeolite. The band at 3731cm1 is attributed to isolated silanol groups exposed on external surface while the broad band centered at 3500cm1 is generally characteristic of silanol nests.28, 34 The presence of abundant silanol groups indicates the existence of a large number of defects in S-1 zeolite.35 After the introduction of Zn species at increasing loading, the peak at 3731cm1 weakens slightly. In comparison, the decreased intensity of the 3500cm1 signal is much more significant, indicating that ZnO species are attached to the support mainly through interaction with the silanol nests. In addition, with the increasing Zn loading to 3%, a new band appears at 3672cm1, which may arise from the external Zn-OH groups.36

The interaction between silanol nests and ZnO species also suppresses aggregation of ZnO species under reaction conditions, as verified by TEM. Therefore, dispersed active ZnO species through interaction with abundant silanol nests lead to excellent PDH catalytic performance. Furthermore, TGA shows that the amount of coke over the spent 5%Zn/S-1 catalyst after 6h reaction at 550C and a space velocity 8000mLg1h1 is determined to be as low as 2.03%. The good anti-coking ability is another reason for the reaction stability in PDH.

Conclusion In summary, S-1 zeolite has been demonstrated to be a good support for dispersion and stabilization of ZnO species. ZnO species interact with silanol nests of S-1 zeolite. Thus, the resulting Zn/S-1 catalysts exhibit excellent PDH catalytic performance. For instance, propane conversion reaches 49% and propylene selectivity is around 90% under the conditions of 550C, 0.1Mpa and a space velocity 5000mLh1gcat1. By contrast, propane conversion is only 0.32% and 1.67% over 5%Zn/SiO2 and 5%Zn/Al2O3, and propylene selectivity is 39.8% over 5%Zn/H-ZSM-5. The 5%Zn/S-1 delivers a stable performance within a 6h PDH test and there is little coke detected.

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process is favored due to its ability to produce propylene from propane without generating significant byproducts, unlike traditional methods that use expensive platinum and toxic chromium oxide catalysts. The study highlights the potential of using low-cost and environmentally friendly zinc oxide (ZnO) based catalysts for PDH. 

2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH production has evolved significantly. Initially, there was a debate about the active Ga species involved in the reaction. Recent research has contributed to a clearer understanding of these catalysts. The silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite serves as an effective support for dispersing and stabilizing ZnO species, enhancing the catalytic performance of the Zn/S-1 catalysts. The study demonstrates that ZnO species interact with silanol nests on the S-1 support, suppressing aggregation under reaction conditions and leading to excellent PDH performance. The S-1 support is characterized by a large number of defects, which contribute to the dispersion and stabilization of ZnO species. This interaction also leads to high initial propylene selectivity and stability during PDH reactions, even at higher temperatures. The results suggest that the presence of ZnO species and their interaction with silanol nests on the S-1 support play crucial roles in achieving high propane conversion and propylene selectivity in PDH reactions.

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by necessitating more efficient and cost-effective alternatives to traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. PDH offers the advantage of producing propylene with fewer byproducts, but challenges remain in achieving high activity and stability, especially with catalysts like platinum and chromium oxide which are expensive and toxic. Research into low-cost, environmentally friendly catalysts, such as those based on zinc (Zn), has gained prominence. Zinc-based catalysts, both in the form of isolated zinc ions (Zn2+) and nanostructured zinc oxide (ZnO) assemblies, have shown promise for PDH reactions due to their inherent reactivity and low environmental impact. 

A notable study reported the use of silicalite-1 (S-1) as a support for ZnO catalysts in PDH, aiming to disperse and stabilize active ZnO species. The S-1 zeolite was found to effectively support ZnO catalysts, leading to an excellent PDH performance characterized by high propane conversion and propylene selectivity. The S-1 support was noted for its ability to maintain the dispersion and stability of ZnO species, contributing to the high catalytic activity and stability of the resulting Zn/S-1 catalysts. This work highlights the potential of using S-1 as a support material for developing highly efficient PDH catalysts, addressing the need for sustainable and economically viable propylene production methods.

In terms of the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, while the literature does not directly discuss gallium (Ga)-based catalysts, it emphasizes the importance of support materials and dispersed active sites for PDH reactions. The presence of abundant defects in the S-1 zeolite, for example, was mentioned as a key factor in its utility as a catalyst support. This suggests that the design of catalysts, including the selection of support materials, plays a crucial role in achieving high catalytic performance in PDH reactions. The ongoing debate about the active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts might involve considerations related to site dispersion, stability, and reactivity, which are central themes in the broader context of PDH catalyst development. The study on Zn/S-1 catalysts contributes to this field by demonstrating the effectiveness of a different metal (zinc) in a similar type of reaction, potentially offering insights and strategies that could be applicable to the optimization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts or other PDH catalyst systems.

丙烯作为基本的化工原料，广泛用于生产聚丙烯、丙烯酸和丙烯腈等化学品，其需求的增长推动了新型生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH的优势在于能以较少的副产品生产丙烯，但铂、铬氧化物等传统催化剂因成本高、毒性大且快速失活而限制了其广泛应用。锌基催化剂因其低成本和环境友好性而受到更多关注。孤立的锌离子（Zn2+）和纳米结构的锌氧化物（ZnO）组装体在PDH反应中显示出活性。

一项研究报道了利用硅铝沸石（S-1）作为锌氧化物催化剂的支持物，旨在分散和稳定活性锌氧化物物种。S-1沸石被发现能够有效支持锌氧化物催化剂，从而实现PDH性能的优异表现，包括高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。S-1支持材料被指出能够维持锌氧化物物种的分散性和稳定性，进而贡献于Zn/S-1催化剂的高催化活性和稳定性。这一工作揭示了使用S-1作为催化剂支持材料开发高效PDH催化剂的潜力，解决了可持续和经济高效的丙烯生产方法的需求。

关于镓/分子筛H-ZSM-5（Ga/H-ZSM-5）催化剂的PDH理解，文献并未直接讨论镓（Ga），而是强调了支持材料和活性位点在PDH反应中的重要性。S-1沸石中丰富的缺陷被提及为其作为催化剂支持材料的特性，这暗示了设计催化剂，包括选择支持材料，在PDH反应中实现高催化性能的关键作用。关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中活性Ga物种的争论可能涉及位点分散、稳定性和反应性的考虑，这是PDH催化剂发展领域中的核心主题。Zn/S-1催化剂的研究成果为这一领域提供了有效的金属（锌）在类似反应中的应用示例，可能为优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂或其他PDH催化剂系统提供见解和策略。

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in developing new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to its potential for producing propylene with fewer byproducts. PDH processes, such as Catofin and Oleflex, traditionally use Platinum and Chromium oxide catalysts, which are expensive and potentially hazardous. Zinc oxide (ZnO) based catalysts have gained attention for their low-cost and environmental friendliness. Research has shown that S-1 zeolite can effectively support and stabilize ZnO species, leading to high activity and stability in PDH reactions. However, the stability of ZnO catalysts can be affected by the size and aggregation of ZnO particles. For instance, smaller ZnO nanoclusters anchored in the framework of dealuminated Beta zeolite have shown high activity and selectivity. The performance of ZnO-based catalysts can vary depending on the loading of Zn and the type of support material used.
