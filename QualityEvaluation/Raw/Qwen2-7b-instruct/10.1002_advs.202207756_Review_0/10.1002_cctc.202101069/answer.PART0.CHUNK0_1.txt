<p>Propylene is a vital and basic building block and used for production of a variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid and acrylonitrile.1-5 Propylene is generally produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process. However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand.4, 5 As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts.</p>
<p>Both isolated Zn2+ species and nanosized ZnO assemblies were active for PDH reactions.16 However, small ZnO assemblies were generally unstable especially under harsh reaction conditions17 and they were frequently dispersed and stabilized on supports.</p>
<p>ZnO/Al2O3 modified by a trace amount of Pt showed excellent PDH activity, in which Lewis acidic ZnO served as active sites and Pt worked as a promoter by increasing the Lewis acidity of Zn2+.20 Furthermore, it was much more stable than the unpromoted ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst.</p>
<p>In comparison, silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite has the same MFI topology without strong acidity. Recently, Li et al. contructed Zn-containing catalysts Zn@S-1 throngh in-situ hydrothermal synthesis for PDH reaction and the partially reduced zinc cations were identified as the active sites.22 Furthermore, the presence of abundant defects makes S-1 widely used as catalyst support.23 We wonder whether S-1 is an effective support to directly disperse and stabilize active ZnO species for PDH reaction.</p>
<p>The results show that 5%Zn/S-1 exhibited a much higher propylene yield than 5%Zn/SiO2, 5%Zn/Al2O3 and 5%Zn/H-ZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3=360) under the same reaction condition. The role of ZnO species and support in Zn/S-1 catalysts was elucidated on the basis of detailed characterizations and PDH catalytic performance.</p>
<p>Considering the thermodynamic constraints, PDH reactions were also carried out over 5%Zn/S-1 catalyst at different reaction temperatures of 500, 525, 550 and 575°C. As shown in Figure3, the initial propane conversion significantly increases from 18.8% to 66.7% while propylene selectivity decreases with the stepwise increasing temperature.</p>
<p>The XRD patterns in Figure4 show that the S-1 zeolite exhibits a typical MFI structure. Its crystal structure remains unchanged after being supported with ZnO. No diffraction peaks corresponding to ZnO are observed for the catalysts with Zn loading up to 5%, suggesting that Zn species are well dispersed or existing as tiny ZnO particles which are beyond XRD detection limitation.</p>
<p>Below 5% Zn loading, mainly the external surface area decreases, indicating that ZnO species are dispersed on the external surface. Meanwhile, it is reasonable to assume that some ZnO species deposit inside the zeolitic pores considering the slight decrease of microporous surface area.</p>
<p>The DR UV-vis in Figure6 shows a band at around 370nm and a weak shoulder one at about 265nm upon introduction of zinc species to S-1 zeolite. These two bands are generally attributed to ZnO crystals on the external zeolite surface and subnanometric ZnO clusters inside zeolitic pores, respectively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the intensity of the 370nm band is enhanced with the increasing Zn loading, especially for Zn/S-1 catalyst with higher Zn loading such as 10%Zn/S-1 indicating enhanced formation of ZnO species on the external surface.</p>
<p>The XPS spectra in Figure8 shows the spin-orbit splitting value of the Zn 2p peaks in Zn/S-1 is 23eV, which is typical for Zn2+,31 consistent with TEM and UV-vis results. In addition, the binding energy peaks of Zn 2p in Zn/S-1 is 1.1eV higher than that of ZnO (1045eV and 1022eV), suggesting that Zn2+ becomes more electron deficient.</p>
<p>Concretely, the acid amount increase from 0.227mmol/g (1%Zn/S-1) to 0.416mmol/g (3%Zn/S-1), 0.484mmol/g (5%Zn/S-1) and 0.552 mmol/g (10%Zn/S-1).</p>

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in PDH as an alternative production method, especially since PDH offers the advantage of producing less byproducts compared to traditional steam cracking and FCC processes. The development of new catalysts for PDH has been driven by the need for more efficient and sustainable propylene production.

2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, with debates about the nature of active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by identifying specific active sites and improving catalyst stability. However, the document does not provide details on the specific findings related to Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

1. 对丙烯日益增长的需求推动了PDH作为一种替代生产方法的发展，特别是因为PDH相比传统的蒸汽裂解和FCC过程具有生产副产品更少的优势。对于更高效和可持续的丙烯生产，对PDH催化剂的新发展产生了需求。

2. Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已经发展，关于活性Ga物种的性质存在争论。最近的研究已经为这些催化剂提供了当前的知识，通过识别特定的活性位点并提高催化剂稳定性。但是，文档没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的具体发现详情。
