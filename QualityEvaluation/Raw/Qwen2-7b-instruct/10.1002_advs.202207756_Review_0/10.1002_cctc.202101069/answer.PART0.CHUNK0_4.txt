[1] "Propylene is a vital and basic building block and used for production of a variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid and acrylonitrile."
[2] "However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."
[3] "As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."
[4] "Compared with high-priced Platinum and toxic Chromium oxide, ZnO based catalysts attract wide attention due to its low-cost and environment-friendly character."
[5] "It was much more stable than the unpromoted ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst."
[6] "For instance, well dispersed small ZnO nanoclusters anchored in the framework of dealuminated Beta zeolite was shown with a high activity and propylene selectivity."
[7] "Considering the thermodynamic constraints, PDH reactions were also carried out over 5%Zn/S-1 catalyst at different reaction temperatures of 500, 525, 550 and 575C."
[8] "In comparison, the 10%Zn/S-1 exhibits similar initial propane conversion with 5%Zn/S-1 but it suffers a slightly faster deactivation probably due to the formation of a small number of larger ZnO particles with the increase of Zn loading."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in developing new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to its potential for producing propylene with fewer byproducts. PDH processes, such as Catofin and Oleflex, traditionally use Platinum and Chromium oxide catalysts, which are expensive and potentially hazardous. Zinc oxide (ZnO) based catalysts have gained attention for their low-cost and environmental friendliness. Research has shown that S-1 zeolite can effectively support and stabilize ZnO species, leading to high activity and stability in PDH reactions. However, the stability of ZnO catalysts can be affected by the size and aggregation of ZnO particles. For instance, smaller ZnO nanoclusters anchored in the framework of dealuminated Beta zeolite have shown high activity and selectivity. The performance of ZnO-based catalysts can vary depending on the loading of Zn and the type of support material used.

对于丙烯日益增长的需求，已经引起了对新生产方法的兴趣，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），因为它有可能以较少的副产品生产丙烯。传统的PDH过程，如Catofin和Oleflex，通常使用铂金和铬氧化物催化剂，这些催化剂成本高且可能存在安全隐患。锌氧化物（ZnO）基催化剂因其低成本和环境友好性而受到关注。研究表明，S-1沸石可以有效地支持并稳定ZnO物种，从而在PDH反应中表现出高活性和稳定性。然而，ZnO催化剂的稳定性可能会受到ZnO颗粒大小和聚集的影响。例如，在去铝化Beta沸石框架中锚定的小型ZnO纳米簇显示出高活性和选择性。根据负载的Zn和所用支持材料的不同，ZnO基催化剂的性能会有所变化。
