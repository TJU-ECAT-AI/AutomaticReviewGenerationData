Silicalite-1 supported ZnO catalysts were prepared by a simple impregnation method. The as-prepared catalysts exhibited an excellent catalytic activity and stability for PDH reaction. Dispersed ZnO species could be obtained and stabilized via interaction between silanol nests of silicalite-1 support and ZnO species. The interaction between silanol nests and ZnO species could suppress aggregation of ZnO species under reaction conditions.

Among Zn, V, Zr, Co and Fe-based catalysts,11-15 Zn-based catalysts have received more attention due to its low-cost and environment-friendly properties. Both isolated Zn2+ species and nanosized ZnO assemblies were active for PDH reactions.16 However, small ZnO assemblies were generally unstable especially under harsh reaction conditions17 and they were frequently dispersed and stabilized on supports. 

A high initial propylene selectivity ranging from 89.2% to 98.8% is achieved on Zn/S-1 catalysts with Zn loading from 1% to 5% with a small amount of methane, ethane, ethylene and C4+ species (Figure1b and TableS1).

Considering the thermodynamic constraints, PDH reactions were also carried out over 5%Zn/S-1 catalyst at different reaction temperatures of 500, 525, 550 and 575C. As shown in Figure3, the initial propane conversion significantly increases from 18.8% to 66.7% while propylene selectivity decreases with the stepwise increasing temperature. The propylene selectivity at 575C decreases significantly due to the facilitated side reactions at high temperature.25 Therefore, the most suitable temperature is chosen as 550C in order to achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity simultaneously.

The XRD patterns in Figure4 show that the S-1 zeolite exhibits a typical MFI structure. Its crystal structure remains unchanged after being supported with ZnO. No diffraction peaks corresponding to ZnO are observed for the catalysts with Zn loading up to 5%, suggesting that Zn species are well dispersed or existing as tiny ZnO particles which are beyond XRD detection limitation.26 However, at 10% loading, weak diffraction peaks attributed to ZnO appear, indicating the growth of Zn species.

N2 physisorption results (Table1) indicate that the specific surface area and pore volume gradually decrease with the increasing Zn loadings. Below 5% Zn loading, mainly the external surface area decreases, indicating that ZnO species are dispersed on the external surface. Meanwhile, it is reasonable to assume that some ZnO species deposit inside the zeolitic pores considering the slight decrease of microporous surface area.27 As the Zn loading further increases to 10%, both the external surface area and the microporous surface area decrease. This may be attributed to large ZnO particles at a high Zn loading blocking the pore openings of S-1.28

The DR UV-vis in Figure6 shows a band at around 370nm and a weak shoulder one at about 265nm upon introduction of zinc species to S-1 zeolite. These two bands are generally attributed to ZnO crystals on the external zeolite surface and subnanometric ZnO clusters inside zeolitic pores, respectively.29 Furthermore, the intensity of the 370nm band is enhanced with the increasing Zn loading, especially for Zn/S-1 catalyst with higher Zn loading such as 10%Zn/S-1 indicating enhanced formation of ZnO species on the external surface.

NH3-TPD and Py-IR are employed to characterize the acidic properties of the catalysts considering that Zn species exhibiting Lewis acidity are generally considered as active sites in PDH reaction.20 As shown in Figure7a and Table1, S-1 zeolite only has a slight signal of NH3 desorption, demonstrating its weak acidic property. However, the acid amount of catalysts is significantly improved after supporting ZnO with the desorption peaks of Zn/S-1 catalysts falling in similar temperature range from 100500C. The Py-IR spectra in Fig. 7b further show that the Zn/S-1 catalysts exhibit Lewis acidity, confirmed by the infrared band at 1453cm1 and no Brnsted acid sites (1540cm1) are decteted.30 The amounts of Lewis acid sites determined from the NH3 desorption amounts gradually increase with the increase of Zn loading. Concretely, the acid amount increase from 0.227mmol/g (1%Zn/S-1) to 0.416mmol/g (3%Zn/S-1), 0.484mmol/g (5%Zn/S-1) and 0.552 mmol/g (10%Zn/S-1).

The XPS spectra in Figure8 shows the spin-orbit splitting value of the Zn 2p peaks in Zn/S-1 is 23eV, which is typical for Zn2+,31 consistent with TEM and UV-vis results. In addition, the binding energy peaks of Zn 2p in Zn/S-1 is 1.1eV higher than that of ZnO (1045eV and 1022eV), suggesting that Zn2+ becomes more electron deficient.19 It indicates SiOZn exists considering that the electron density of Zn in the SiOZn bond is lower than that in the ZnOZn bond. The above result indicates interaction develops between the ZnO species and the support.32

29Si MAS NMR is further applied to explore the interaction between the ZnO species and S-1 zeolite. As shown in Figure9a, two signals are observed over S-1. The Q4 signal at 113ppm is generally assigned to Si(SiO)4 while the Q3 signal at around 103ppm is attributed to (SiOH)(SiO)3 group.33 After the introduction of Zn, the intensity of the 103ppm signal significantly declines, indicating the consumption of silanol groups by interaction with ZnO species. FT-IR is applied to characterize the hydroxyl groups on S-1 and Zn/S-1 catalysts. As shown in Figure9b, there are two major types of OH groups present for S-1 zeolite. The band at 3731cm1 is attributed to isolated silanol groups exposed on external surface while the broad band centered at 3500cm1 is generally characteristic of silanol nests.28, 34 The presence of abundant silanol groups indicates the existence of a large number of defects in S-1 zeolite.35 After the introduction of Zn species at increasing loading, the peak at 3731cm1 weakens slightly. In comparison, the decreased intensity of the 3500cm1 signal is much more significant, indicating that ZnO species are attached to the support mainly through interaction with the silanol nests. In addition, with the increasing Zn loading to 3%, a new band appears at 3672cm1, which may arise from the external Zn-OH groups.36

The interaction between silanol nests and ZnO species also suppresses aggregation of ZnO species under reaction conditions, as verified by TEM. Therefore, dispersed active ZnO species through interaction with abundant silanol nests lead to excellent PDH catalytic performance. Furthermore, TGA shows that the amount of coke over the spent 5%Zn/S-1 catalyst after 6h reaction at 550C and a space velocity 8000mLg1h1 is determined to be as low as 2.03%. The good anti-coking ability is another reason for the reaction stability in PDH.

Conclusion In summary, S-1 zeolite has been demonstrated to be a good support for dispersion and stabilization of ZnO species. ZnO species interact with silanol nests of S-1 zeolite. Thus, the resulting Zn/S-1 catalysts exhibit excellent PDH catalytic performance. For instance, propane conversion reaches 49% and propylene selectivity is around 90% under the conditions of 550C, 0.1Mpa and a space velocity 5000mLh1gcat1. By contrast, propane conversion is only 0.32% and 1.67% over 5%Zn/SiO2 and 5%Zn/Al2O3, and propylene selectivity is 39.8% over 5%Zn/H-ZSM-5. The 5%Zn/S-1 delivers a stable performance within a 6h PDH test and there is little coke detected.

1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process is favored due to its ability to produce propylene from propane without generating significant byproducts, unlike traditional methods that use expensive platinum and toxic chromium oxide catalysts. The study highlights the potential of using low-cost and environmentally friendly zinc oxide (ZnO) based catalysts for PDH. 

2. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH production has evolved significantly. Initially, there was a debate about the active Ga species involved in the reaction. Recent research has contributed to a clearer understanding of these catalysts. The silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite serves as an effective support for dispersing and stabilizing ZnO species, enhancing the catalytic performance of the Zn/S-1 catalysts. The study demonstrates that ZnO species interact with silanol nests on the S-1 support, suppressing aggregation under reaction conditions and leading to excellent PDH performance. The S-1 support is characterized by a large number of defects, which contribute to the dispersion and stabilization of ZnO species. This interaction also leads to high initial propylene selectivity and stability during PDH reactions, even at higher temperatures. The results suggest that the presence of ZnO species and their interaction with silanol nests on the S-1 support play crucial roles in achieving high propane conversion and propylene selectivity in PDH reactions.
