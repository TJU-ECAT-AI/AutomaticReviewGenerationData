          The increasing demand for propylene has notably spurred the creation of new production techniques, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This interest has intensified due to the growing need for efficient propylene production. The comprehension of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has advanced significantly, with a continuous discussion around the active Ga species. Recent studies have provided insights that enhance our current understanding of these catalysts.
