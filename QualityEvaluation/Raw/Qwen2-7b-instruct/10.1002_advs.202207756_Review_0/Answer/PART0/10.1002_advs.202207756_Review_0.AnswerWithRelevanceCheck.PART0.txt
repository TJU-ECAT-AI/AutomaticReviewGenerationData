          [1] "The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030,"
          [2] "PDH can be broadly grouped into two categories: non-oxidative and oxidative."
          [3] "Among these, the Catofin process employs fixed-bed reactors with CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts containing more than 18% CrOx as the active ingredient and 12 wt% alkaline metals as promoters."
          [4] "The Oleflex process employs fluidized bed reactors with Pt-based catalysts, with propane conversion and propylene selectivity of 30-40% and 85.5-88%, respectively."

          The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), leading to the exploration of alternative catalysts due to the high cost of Pt and health/environmental concerns associated with Cr. PDH processes like the Catofin and Oleflex have been developed, utilizing different types of catalysts (CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-based, respectively) to address the need for efficient propylene production.

          [5] "As synthesized CrOx-based catalysts contain multiple oxidation states of Cr, including VI, IV, III, and II, but Cr3+ becomes the main species at reaction conditions."
          [6] "The ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated."
          [7] "Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, that is, Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair."
          [8] "We combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites."
          [9] "Similar to Ga/H-ZSM-5, multiple Zn species have been reported in Zn/H-ZSM-5, that is, isolated Zn2+, isolated [ZnOH]+, multinuclear ZnO clusters, and bulk ZnO aggregates."
          [10] "It was concluded that isolated In+ sites rather than InHx were the stable active site for PDH, which was independent of the Al distribution."

          The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through various research efforts. It has been recognized that Ga/H-ZSM-5 can effectively dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes. Multiple Ga species, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair, have been proposed as potential active centers. Recent studies have provided insights into the complex Ga speciation within the zeolite matrix and the relationship between Ga/Al ratios, Al distribution, and PDH performance. This understanding helps in optimizing the catalysts for PDH. Similarly, the active Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM-5 have been identified, and it was concluded that isolated In+ sites are the stable active site for PDH, independent of the Al distribution.

          对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解通过各种研究努力得到了发展。人们已经认识到Ga/H-ZSM-5可以有效地将轻质烷烃脱氢为烯烃。提出了多种Ga物种，包括Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaOH]2+、[GaH]2+、[GaH2]+和Ga+H+对，作为潜在的活性中心。最近的研究提供了关于在沸石矩阵中复杂Ga物种组成的见解，以及Ga/Al比例、Al分布与PDH性能之间的关系。这些理解有助于优化PDH催化剂。同样，在Zn/H-ZSM-5中，活性Zn物种已被确定，结论是孤立的In+位点是PDH的稳定活性位点，与Al分布无关。
