          <c>Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide,acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [14].</c>
          <c>The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies,the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst [5].</c>
          <c>For Pt-based catalysts, the electronic modification by promoters and the specific interaction with the optimized supports lead to the enhancement in both catalytic activity and stability [611].</c>
          <c>However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process.</c>
          <c>Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge [1224].</c>
          <c>Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability.</c>

          The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), aimed at finding alternatives to traditional Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. This pursuit seeks to reduce costs and minimize environmental impact while maintaining high efficiency. The exploration of Ga-based catalysts for PDH has advanced with a focus on the nature of active Ga species. Recent studies highlight the significance of the structure of Al2O3 in determining its properties in adsorption and activation of propane, which impacts coke deposition in the PDH reaction. Efforts are ongoing to tailor the structure of Co2+ and Al2O3 composites to enhance catalytic performance in PDH, showing potential for improved selectivity and stability.

          <c>For instance, the coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites present on the (100) facets of commercial c-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites to anchor atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites [36,37].</c>
          <c>The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type c-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, leading to an enhanced activity and stability in PDH reaction [38].</c>
          <c>The c-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support [39].</c>
          <c>This PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst displayed an excellent performance at an ultrahigh space velocity in a long-term PDH reaction.</c>
          <c>In addition to being an appropriate support, the hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 showed a high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as the surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene [40].</c>
          <c>Furthermore, the diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction.</c>
          <c>Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction.</c>

          The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), aiming to find alternatives to traditional Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with a focus on the nature of active Ga species. Recent studies suggest that the structure of Al2O3 plays a crucial role in determining the adsorption and activation of propane, influencing coke deposition in the PDH reaction. This has led to the development of novel catalysts, such as CoAl2O3HT, employing a one-step hydrothermal method to synthesize sheet-shaped materials that can enhance the efficiency of the PDH reaction.
