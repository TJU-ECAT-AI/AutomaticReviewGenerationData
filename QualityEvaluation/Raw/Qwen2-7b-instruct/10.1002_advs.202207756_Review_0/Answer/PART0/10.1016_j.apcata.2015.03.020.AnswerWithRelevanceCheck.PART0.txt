          The growing demand for propylene has driven interest in new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the availability of new feedstocks from hydraulic fracturing operations. Propane dehydrogenation is especially significant in the family of dehydrogenation reactions because propylene is a critical feedstock for polymer production. Researchers continue to seek improved PDH catalysts. Recently, PDH catalysts involving group IIIA metal oxides, such as In2O3 and Ga2O3, have gained attention. The mixed InGa oxide catalysts, which show activity when each single oxide component does, are hypothesized to exhibit distinct PDH properties compared to their individual oxide counterparts. The resulting mixed-metal oxides demonstrate significantly higher activity in terms of propane conversion than previously reported mixed In2O3Al2O3 catalysts and -Ga2O3 catalysts, both on a catalyst mass basis and surface area basis.

          随着丙烯需求的增长，人们对新的生产方法产生了兴趣，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），因为水力压裂操作提供了大量新原料。在这一系列的脱氢反应中，丙烷脱氢尤其重要，因为丙烯是聚合物生产的关键原料。研究人员一直在寻求改进的PDH催化剂。近年来，涉及第III族金属氧化物（如In2O3和Ga2O3）的PDH催化剂引起了关注。当每个单一氧化物成分显示活性时，混合的InGa氧化物催化剂被假设可能表现出与各自氧化物不同的PDH特性。这些混合金属氧化物在丙烷转化率方面显示出显著高于已报道的混合In2O3Al2O3催化剂和-Ga2O3催化剂的活性，无论是在催化剂质量基础还是表面积基础上。

          In the context of the reactions analyzed, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is of particular interest because it is a critical process for producing propylene, a vital feedstock in polymer manufacturing. Efforts are ongoing to improve PDH catalysts. There has been recent interest in PDH catalysts that incorporate group IIIA metal oxides, like In2O3 and Ga2O3. Our hypothesis is that the mixed InGa oxide catalysts might display unique PDH characteristics compared to their individual oxide counterparts due to each component showing some level of activity. The mixed-metal oxides generated have shown notably higher activity in converting propane, surpassing previous mixed In2O3Al2O3 catalysts and -Ga2O3 catalysts, both in terms of catalyst mass and surface area.
