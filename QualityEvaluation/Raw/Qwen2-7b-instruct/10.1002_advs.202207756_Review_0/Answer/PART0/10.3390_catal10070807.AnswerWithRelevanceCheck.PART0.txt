          The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH is a critical process for propylene production. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debates about the active Ga species and recent research findings contributing to our current knowledge of these catalysts. These catalysts demonstrate high activity and selectivity in PDH reactions.

          对丙烯日益增长的需求已影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH是丙烯生产的重要过程之一。我们对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随着时间的推移而显著发展，关于参与PDH反应的活性Ga物种的争论持续进行，并且最近的研究结果为我们当前对这些催化剂的知识做出了贡献。这些催化剂在PDH反应中表现出高活性和选择性。
