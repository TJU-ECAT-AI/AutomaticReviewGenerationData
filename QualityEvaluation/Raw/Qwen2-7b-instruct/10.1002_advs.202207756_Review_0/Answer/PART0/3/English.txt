The demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH is an intensive endothermic process that requires high temperatures (typically above 500 C) for operation, which limits C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability due to side reactions like coking and particle sintering. Nanostructured catalysts (NCs) based on metals and/or metal oxides with tunable geometric and electronic properties play a significant role, as these properties inherently affect the adsorption of propyl intermediates on the catalyst surface. This paper focuses on delivering general principles for the rational design of NCs in PDH reactions. Side reactions can occur due to the adsorption of propylene intermediates on the catalyst surface, which can be regulated by tailoring the geometric and electronic features. Platinum-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly than chromium oxide-based catalysts. The confinement approach of embedding active sites in zeolite frameworks effectively inhibits the sintering of metal nanoparticles. Metal oxides, though less expensive, have higher barriers for CH activation and a higher risk of coking. The structures of submonolayer/monolayer in mesoporous materials, triggered by spontaneous dispersion and confinement, significantly enhance oxide activity and stability. Notably, the confinement strategy in zeolite frameworks prevents the sintering of metal nanoparticles. Hydroxyl groups introduced onto the surface of vanadium oxides significantly improve propylene selectivity and reduce deactivation rates. Recently, Lerchers' team discovered that in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, a very low enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ·mol1 was observed for heterolytic activation of propane CH bonds on [GaH]2+ with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site. Additionally, Kondratenko and colleagues found that increasing the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations in ZrO2-based catalysts can be achieved by depositing small amounts of hydrogenation-active metal promoters, catalyzing ZrO2 reduction in situ under dehydrogenation conditions or during reductive catalyst treatment to promote CH bond dissociation.

Although the XRD patterns exhibit similar intermetallic phases like Pt3Co, the differing (PtCo):(PtPt) ratios in the EXAFS spectra at the Pt LIII edge and the presence of multiple phases in some XRD patterns indicate that the average compositions of the nanoparticles across the catalysts are distinct. At low Co loadings, the catalysts consist of metallic Pt and a smaller ordered Pt3Co alloy phase; as Co loading increases, an ordered Pt3Co alloy phase is formed. At high Co loadings, a more Co-rich PtCo alloy phase is likely present alongside metallic Co nanoparticles.

The growing demand for propylene has led to a surge in the exploration and development of new production methods, particularly focusing on propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, with initial debates about the active Ga species involved in the catalytic process. Recent research has highlighted the role of these catalysts, confirming the significance of gallium (Ga) in the dehydrogenation reaction. Gallium, when integrated into the zeolite structure, enhances the activity and stability of the catalyst. Furthermore, these catalysts can be effectively regenerated, enabling continuous operation with minimal efficiency loss.

The escalating demand for propylene has had a considerable impact on the development of new production approaches, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH provides a practical substitute for conventional propylene manufacturing methods, facilitating increased output and reduced expenses. The insight into Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has progressed over time, with discussions on the nature of the active Ga species remaining a key area of interest. Recent discoveries have illuminated the function of these catalysts in PDH processes, enhancing our current understanding.

The demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH is an intensive endothermic process that requires high temperatures (typically above 500 C) for operation, which limits C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability due to side reactions like coking and particle sintering. Nanostructured catalysts (NCs) based on metals and/or metal oxides with tunable geometric and electronic properties play a significant role, as these properties inherently affect the adsorption of propyl intermediates on the catalyst surface. This paper focuses on delivering general principles for the rational design of NCs in PDH reactions. Side reactions can occur due to the adsorption of propylene intermediates on the catalyst surface, which can be regulated by tailoring the geometric and electronic features. Platinum-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly than chromium oxide-based catalysts. The confinement approach of embedding active sites in zeolite frameworks effectively inhibits the sintering of metal nanoparticles. Metal oxides, though less expensive, have higher barriers for CH activation and a higher risk of coking. The structures of submonolayer/monolayer in mesoporous materials, triggered by spontaneous dispersion and confinement, significantly enhance oxide activity and stability. Notably, the confinement strategy in zeolite frameworks prevents the sintering of metal nanoparticles. Hydroxyl groups introduced onto the surface of vanadium oxides significantly improve propylene selectivity and reduce deactivation rates. Recently, Lerchers' team discovered that in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, a very low enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ·mol1 was observed for heterolytic activation of propane CH bonds on [GaH]2+ with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site. Additionally, Kondratenko and colleagues found that increasing the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations in ZrO2-based catalysts can be achieved by depositing small amounts of hydrogenation-active metal promoters, catalyzing ZrO2 reduction in situ under dehydrogenation conditions or during reductive catalyst treatment to promote CH bond dissociation.

Although the XRD patterns exhibit similar intermetallic phases like Pt3Co, the differing (PtCo):(PtPt) ratios in the EXAFS spectra at the Pt LIII edge and the presence of multiple phases in some XRD patterns indicate that the average compositions of the nanoparticles across the catalysts are distinct. At low Co loadings, the catalysts consist of metallic Pt and a smaller ordered Pt3Co alloy phase; as Co loading increases, an ordered Pt3Co alloy phase is formed. At high Co loadings, a more Co-rich PtCo alloy phase is likely present alongside metallic Co nanoparticles.

The growing demand for propylene has led to a surge in the exploration and development of new production methods, particularly focusing on propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, with initial debates about the active Ga species involved in the catalytic process. Recent research has highlighted the role of these catalysts, confirming the significance of gallium (Ga) in the dehydrogenation reaction. Gallium, when integrated into the zeolite structure, enhances the activity and stability of the catalyst. Furthermore, these catalysts can be effectively regenerated, enabling continuous operation with minimal efficiency loss.

The escalating demand for propylene has had a considerable impact on the development of new production approaches, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH provides a practical substitute for conventional propylene manufacturing methods, facilitating increased output and reduced expenses. The insight into Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has progressed over time, with discussions on the nature of the active Ga species remaining a key area of interest. Recent discoveries have illuminated the function of these catalysts in PDH processes, enhancing our current understanding.
