Hydroxyl groups introduced onto the surface of vanadium oxides significantly improve propylene selectivity and reduce deactivation rates. Recently, Lerchers' team discovered that in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, a very low enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ·mol1 was observed for heterolytic activation of propane CH bonds on [GaH]2+ with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site. Additionally, Kondratenko and colleagues found that increasing the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations in ZrO2-based catalysts can be achieved by depositing small amounts of hydrogenation-active metal promoters, catalyzing ZrO2 reduction in situ under dehydrogenation conditions or during reductive catalyst treatment to promote CH bond dissociation.", "Chinese": "对丙烯的需求推动了新生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH是一个强烈的吸热过程，需要高于500°C的高温操作，这限制了C3H6的选择性和催化剂结构稳定性，因为存在副反应如焦化和颗粒聚集等问题。基于金属和/或金属氧化物的纳米结构催化剂（NCs）具有可调的几何和电子性质，对丙基中间体在催化剂表面的吸附起着重要作用，这些特性本质上影响了吸附过程。本文专注于提供PDH反应中NCs的理性设计的一般原则。由于丙烯中间体在催化剂表面的吸附可能会引起副反应，可以通过调整几何和电子特性来调节这些反应。铂基催化剂在环境友好性上优于铬氧化物基催化剂。将活性位点嵌入沸石框架中的封闭策略有效地阻止了金属纳米颗粒的聚集。金属氧化物虽然成本更低，但对于CH激活的障碍更高，且更容易形成焦炭。在介孔材料中由自发分散和封闭触发的亚单层/单层结构显著提高了氧化物的活性和稳定性。值得注意的是，沸石框架中的封闭策略防止了金属纳米颗粒的聚集。在范德华氧化物表面上引入羟基团显著提高了丙烯的选择性和降低了失活率。最近，Lerchers团队发现，在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中，对于异裂激活丙烷CH键，[GaH]2+与Brnsted酸位点的基本框架氧一起观察到了非常低的焓变壁垒（56 kJ·mol1）。此外，Kondratenko及其同事发现，通过在原位下脱氢条件或在还原催化剂处理期间催化ZrO2还原，可以增加ZrO2基催化剂中协调不饱和Zr阳离子的浓度，从而沉积少量氢化活性金属促进剂，以促进CH键的离解。", "Doi": "10.1021/accountsmr.0c00012"},
