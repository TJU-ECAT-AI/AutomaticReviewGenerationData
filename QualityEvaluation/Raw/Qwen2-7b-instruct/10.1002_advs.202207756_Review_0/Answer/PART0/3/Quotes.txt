          [14] "Gallium, when incorporated into the zeolite structure, enhances the activity and stability of the catalyst."
          [15] "Moreover, the catalysts can be effectively regenerated, ensuring continuous operation with minimal loss of efficiency."

[1] "The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
          [2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) offers a viable alternative to traditional propylene production methods, enabling higher yields and lower costs."
          [3] "The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with the ongoing debate about the active Ga species."
          [4] "Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, shedding light on their role in PDH reactions."
