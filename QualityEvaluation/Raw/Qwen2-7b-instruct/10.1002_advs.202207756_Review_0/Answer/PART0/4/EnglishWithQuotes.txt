PDH is an intensive endothermic process that requires high temperatures (typically above 500 C) for operation, which limits C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability due to side reactions like coking and particle sintering. Nanostructured catalysts (NCs) based on metals and/or metal oxides with tunable geometric and electronic properties play a significant role, as these properties inherently influence the adsorption of propyl intermediates on the catalyst surface. This paper focuses on delivering general principles for the rational design of NCs in PDH reactions.

Platinum-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly than chromium oxide-based catalysts. The confinement approach of embedding active sites in zeolite frameworks effectively inhibits the sintering of metal nanoparticles. Metal oxides, though less expensive, have higher barriers for CH activation and a higher risk of coking.
