The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH is an intensive endothermic process that requires high temperatures (typically above 500 C) for operation, which limits C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability due to side reactions like coking and particle sintering. Nanostructured catalysts (NCs) based on metals and/or metal oxides with tunable geometric and electronic properties play a significant role, as these properties inherently influence the adsorption of propyl intermediates on the catalyst surface. This paper focuses on delivering general principles for the rational design of NCs in PDH reactions. Side reactions can occur due to the adsorption of propylene intermediates on the catalyst surface, which can be regulated by tailoring the geometric and electronic features. Platinum-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly than chromium oxide-based catalysts. The confinement approach of embedding active sites in zeolite frameworks effectively inhibits the sintering of metal nanoparticles. Metal oxides, though less expensive, have higher barriers for CH activation and a higher risk of coking. The structures of submonolayer/monolayer in mesoporous materials, triggered by spontaneous dispersion and confinement, significantly enhance oxide activity and stability. Notably, the confinement strategy in zeolite frameworks prevents the sintering of metal nanoparticles. Hydroxyl groups introduced onto the surface of vanadium oxides significantly improve propylene selectivity and reduce deactivation rates. Recently, Lerchers' team discovered that in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, a very low enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ路mol1 was observed for heterolytic activation of propane CH bonds on [GaH]2+ with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site. Additionally, Kondratenko and colleagues found that increasing the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations in ZrO2-based catalysts can be achieved by depositing small amounts of hydrogenation-active metal promoters, catalyzing ZrO2 reduction in situ under dehydrogenation conditions or during reductive catalyst treatment to promote CH bond dissociation.

The increasing demand for propylene has notably shaped the advancement of new production strategies, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The comprehension of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has grown, with researchers concentrating on the discussion surrounding the active Ga species. Recent studies have provided valuable insights that enrich our current knowledge of these catalysts.
