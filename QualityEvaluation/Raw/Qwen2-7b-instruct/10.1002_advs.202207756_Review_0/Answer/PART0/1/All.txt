PDH is seen as a promising method for propylene production, offering advantages over methanol-to-olefins and Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins. The regulation of material structure and reaction performance at the molecular and atomic levels is a focus area. The PDH process involves the adsorption of propyl intermediates on the catalyst surface. To enhance the PDH process, strategies such as promoter and support effects have been developed. Catalysts with tunable geometric and electronic properties play a crucial role. Promoters like Cu, Fe, Mn, Co, Sn, Ga, In, Zn can enhance dispersion and electronic states. Supports like Al2O3, SiO2, zeolites can regulate the shape of nanostructured particles and metals-support interaction. Reductive treatment can introduce defects like oxygen vacancies, hydroxyl groups, hydrides enhancing catalytic activity. Promoters like Mg can help disperse V2O5 nanoparticles into polymerized VOx, reducing coke formation. Encapsulation of metal promoters through MSI can alter electron states, affecting catalytic performance. Mesoporous materials provide alternatives for accessing more active sites, confining oxide NPs to prevent sintering.
