          [2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one such method that has gained attention."

[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."
          [2] "PDH technologies, i.e., the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr."
          [3] "Many other catalysts for PDH have been investigated including Ga-,210 Zn-,11,12 Co-,1315 Fe-,1618 V-,1922 Zr-based materials,2325 and nanocarbon catalysts."
          [4] "Metal cations (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, etc.) exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-52832 have shown promising alkane dehydrogenation properties as well: among them, Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation."
          [5] "They showed that In2O3, initially present on the external surface of CHA, can be reduced and then reacts with the Brnsted acid sites (BASs) of the zeolite to form an indium-exchanged (In+) CHA catalyst through the so-called reductive solid-state-ion exchange (RSSIE) process."
          [6] "This point has also been debated in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with respect to propane dehydrogenation. Bell and coworkers32 believe that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species; however, Schreiber et al.31 reported that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active sites, a model supported by results from our laboratory."

[1] "Many groups have examined the catalytic role of these Zn species during light alkane aromatization; the struc- ture and location of these Zn cations in Zn/H-ZSM5, however, were not explored until recently."
          [2] "These metal cations increase propane conversion rates and the selectivity to unsaturated products by increasing the rate of propane and propene dehydrogenation and by avoiding the preferential removal of hydrogen by transfer to hydrocarbon fragments to form light alkanes."
          [3] "In contrast, Berndt et al. (16) showed that CO reacts on Zn/H-ZSM5 (<2 wt% Zn, Si/Al = 23) to produce equimolar amounts of CO2 and H2,suggesting that (ZnOH)+ is present."
