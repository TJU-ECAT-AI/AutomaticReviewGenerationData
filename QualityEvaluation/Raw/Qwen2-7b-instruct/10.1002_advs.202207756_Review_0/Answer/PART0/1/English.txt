The growing demand for propylene and the low cost of propane sourced from shale gas have reignited interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional PDH processes, such as the Catofin method employing chromium oxide/alumina catalysts and the Oleflex process utilizing supported platinum-silver catalysts, are characterized by high costs, swift catalyst degradation, and environmental concerns due to chromium usage. Numerous alternative catalysts, including those based on gallium (Ga), zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co), iron (Fe), vanadium (V), zirconium (Zr), and nanocarbons, have been studied. Gallium exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-5 displays exceptional stability and a high propylene yield (90%) during propane dehydrogenation. Indium (In) on the surface of chabazite zeolite can be reduced and subsequently interact with the Brnsted acid sites (BASs) of the zeolite via a reductive solid-state-ion exchange (RSSIE) process to create an In+-exchanged CHA catalyst. The nature of the active gallium species is subject to debate, with some studies suggesting single [GaH]2+ sites (Bell et al., 2022) and others proposing Ga+H+ pairs (Schreiber et al., 2021), a concept supported by laboratory findings.

The growing demand for propylene has led to advancements in new production methods, particularly focusing on propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, addressing the ongoing debate about the active Ga species.

The growing demand for propylene has led to advancements in the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with a focus on understanding and utilizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The structure and location of Ga species within these catalysts have been a subject of recent investigation, contributing to a deeper understanding of their catalytic role during light alkane aromatization. This includes the exploration of Ga/H-ZSM-5's ability to increase propane conversion rates, improve selectivity towards unsaturated products, and avoid preferential hydrogen removal to form light alkanes. Studies have also delved into the synthesis of Ga cation-exchanged H-ZSM5 zeolite, detailing the structure and location of Ga species through various analytical techniques. Additionally, the nature of Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM5 has been examined using a combination of site titration, kinetic, and isotopic methods along with in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Ga K-edge, providing insights into their catalytic behavior.
