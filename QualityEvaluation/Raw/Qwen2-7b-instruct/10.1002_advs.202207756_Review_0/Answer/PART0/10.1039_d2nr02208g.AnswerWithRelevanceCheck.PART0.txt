          The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which has gained significant attention and has been widely applied. Commercial Pt/Cr-based catalysts face challenges due to fast deactivation and poor stability caused by active species sintering and coke deposition. Strategies such as modifying the support and introducing additives have been proposed to enhance the performance and stability of these catalysts. This review covers the development of PDH and PDH catalysts, summarizing advanced research on supported noble and non-noble metals, metal-free materials, material design, active origins, and existing issues in PDH catalyst development. It also highlights innovative synthesis strategies for PDH catalysts that improve dehydrogenation activity and stability. Future challenges and directions for PDH catalysts are discussed to support their broader industrial application.
