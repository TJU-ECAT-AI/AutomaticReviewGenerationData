          The increasing demand for propylene and the utilization of alternative feedstocks, such as shale gas, have significantly heightened the pressure for propene production and the development of light alkane dehydrogenation processes. Gallium-based catalysts, particularly those supported on silica, have garnered considerable attention as alternatives to traditional catalysts like CrAl2O3 (CATOFIN) and PtSnAl2O3 (Oleflex). Recent research has focused on synthesizing gallium species on silica surfaces through electrostatic adsorption methods. Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) facilitates the creation of well-defined gallium surface species on a variety of supports by grafting tailored molecular precursors onto supports with isolated hydroxyl (OH) sites. The isolated gallium sites achieved through this process are stable and show exceptional catalytic performance, characterized by high activity, selectivity, and stability in propane dehydrogenation reactions. These advancements contribute to the optimization of PDH technology and the development of more efficient catalysts for propylene production.

          The growing demand for propylene and the adoption of alternative feedstocks, such as shale gas, have intensified the pressure for propene production and the development of light alkane dehydrogenation processes. Gallium-based catalysts, including gallium-based zeolites and gallium(III) oxide (Ga2O3) and related materials, are receiving significant attention as alternative catalysts for alkane conversion, particularly for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to their high selectivity for propylene. Various computational and experimental studies have aimed to identify the active sites involved in these processes, but the exact nature of these sites remains a subject of discussion. Recent research has focused on preparing silica-supported gallium species through electrostatic adsorption methods, where the structure of the active sites is currently unknown. Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) provides a method for generating well-defined gallium surface species on different supports by grafting tailored molecular precursors onto supports with isolated hydroxyl (OH) sites. It has been reasoned that developing an appropriate molecular precursor could enable the creation of well-defined isolated gallium active sites outside of bulk Ga2O3. A two-step process, combining SOMC and thermolytic molecular precursor approaches, has been used to generate isolated surface sites with controlled oxidation state and nuclearity. In this work, the synthesis and structural characterization of the molecular complex [Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)] (1) and its application as a precursor for generating gallium single-sites on silica are described. The isolated gallium sites were formed by grafting this complex onto silica followed by a thermolysis step at 500°C under high vacuum. The presented gallium species exhibit unprecedented catalytic performances, featuring high activity, selectivity, and stability in propane dehydrogenation, which contributes to the advancement of PDH technology and the development of more efficient catalysts for propylene production.

          对丙烯的日益增长的需求以及对替代原料（如页岩气）的采用，已经加剧了对丙烯生产及轻质烷烃脱氢过程发展的压力。包括基于镓的沸石和镓(III)氧化物（Ga2O3）及其相关材料在内的镓基催化剂正在受到高度关注，作为烷烃转换的替代催化剂，尤其是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，因其对丙烯的高选择性。各种计算和实验研究旨在识别这些过程中的活性位点，但这些位点的确切性质仍然是讨论的话题。近期的研究集中在通过静电吸附方法制备硅胶支持的镓物种，其中活性位点的结构目前未知。表面有机金属化学（SOMC）提供了一种方法，在具有孤立羟基（OH）位点的支持体上通过接枝定制的分子前体来生成定义明确的镓表面物种。人们认为，开发合适的分子前体可以使镓活性位点在块状Ga2O3之外得到明确定义。一个两步过程，结合SOMC和热解分子前体方法，被用来生成具有可控氧化状态和核性的孤立表面位点。在此工作中，描述了分子复合物[Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)]（1）的合成和结构表征及其作为在硅胶上生成镓单点的前体的应用。通过将此复合物接枝到硅胶上并随后在500°C的高真空下进行热解步骤来形成孤立的镓位点。所展示的镓物种表现出前所未有的催化性能，包括高活性、高选择性和稳定性在丙烷脱氢过程中的应用，这有助于PDH技术的进步并促进了更高效丙烯生产催化剂的发展。
