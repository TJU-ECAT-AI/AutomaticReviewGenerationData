          The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the need for more efficient and selective catalysts. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with researchers focusing on the identification of active Ga species. Recent studies have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by exploring different modulation strategies, such as siliceous zeolite addition, which aim to enhance the coking resistance of iron catalysts used in ethane dehydrogenation. These advancements could potentially lead to improved performance and longevity of PDH catalysts.
