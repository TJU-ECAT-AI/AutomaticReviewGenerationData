Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) provides a method for generating well-defined gallium surface species on different supports by grafting tailored molecular precursors onto supports with isolated hydroxyl (OH) sites.

The catalytic performance is somewhat affected by the preparation method, as the actual bifunctional catalyst is synthesized in place during hydrogen pretreatment.\n          5. The catalytic performance of Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts is comparable to Ga+ZSM-5 catalysts and slightly superior to [Ga]-MFI catalysts.\n          6. The acidic properties of the catalysts significantly change during the high-temperature hydrogen treatment.\n          7. The disappearance of bridging OH groups does not fully eliminate Brnsted acid sites; their concentration decreases partially.\n          8.

The concentrations of created Lewis acid sites on the two catalyst series are proportional to the gallium concentration, with a higher concentration in the ion exchange series.\n          10. The reductive solid ionic exchange reaches complete exchange with bridged OH groups, leading to accumulation of gallium oxide nanoparticles on the zeolite surface.\n          11. The migration and reaction of gallium with Brnsted acid sites is limited in the ion exchange series, with a quarter reacting on the least loaded catalyst.\n          12.

Gallium-based catalysts, including gallium-based zeolites and gallium(III) oxide (Ga2O3) and related materials, are receiving significant attention as alternative catalysts for alkane conversion, particularly for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to their high selectivity for propylene. Various computational and experimental studies have aimed to identify the active sites involved in these processes, but the exact nature of these sites remains a subject of discussion. Recent research has focused on preparing silica-supported gallium species through electrostatic adsorption methods, where the structure of the active sites is currently unknown. Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) provides a method for generating well-defined gallium surface species on different supports by grafting tailored molecular precursors onto supports with isolated hydroxyl (OH) sites. It has been reasoned that developing an appropriate molecular precursor could enable the creation of well-defined isolated gallium active sites outside of bulk Ga2O3. A two-step process, combining SOMC and thermolytic molecular precursor approaches, has been used to generate isolated surface sites with controlled oxidation state and nuclearity. In this work, the synthesis and structural characterization of the molecular complex [Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)] (1) and its application as a precursor for generating gallium single-sites on silica are described. The isolated gallium sites were formed by grafting this complex onto silica followed by a thermolysis step at 500°C under high vacuum.

Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) provides a method for generating well-defined gallium surface species on different supports by grafting tailored molecular precursors onto supports with isolated hydroxyl (OH) sites. It has been reasoned that developing an appropriate molecular precursor could enable the creation of well-defined isolated gallium active sites outside of bulk Ga2O3. A two-step process, combining SOMC and thermolytic molecular precursor approaches, has been used to generate isolated surface sites with controlled oxidation state and nuclearity. In this work, the synthesis and structural characterization of the molecular complex [Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)] (1) and its application as a precursor for generating gallium single-sites on silica are described. The isolated gallium sites were formed by grafting this complex onto silica followed by a thermolysis step at 500°C under high vacuum. The presented gallium species exhibit unprecedented catalytic performances, featuring high activity, selectivity, and stability in propane dehydrogenation, which contributes to the advancement of PDH technology and the development of more efficient catalysts for propylene production.", "Doi": "10.1039/c6sc05178b"},

Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) provides a method for generating well-defined gallium surface species on different supports by grafting tailored molecular precursors onto supports with isolated hydroxyl (OH) sites.

The catalytic performance is somewhat affected by the preparation method, as the actual bifunctional catalyst is synthesized in place during hydrogen pretreatment.\n          5. The catalytic performance of Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts is comparable to Ga+ZSM-5 catalysts and slightly superior to [Ga]-MFI catalysts.\n          6. The acidic properties of the catalysts significantly change during the high-temperature hydrogen treatment.\n          7. The disappearance of bridging OH groups does not fully eliminate Brnsted acid sites; their concentration decreases partially.\n          8.

The concentrations of created Lewis acid sites on the two catalyst series are proportional to the gallium concentration, with a higher concentration in the ion exchange series.\n          10. The reductive solid ionic exchange reaches complete exchange with bridged OH groups, leading to accumulation of gallium oxide nanoparticles on the zeolite surface.\n          11. The migration and reaction of gallium with Brnsted acid sites is limited in the ion exchange series, with a quarter reacting on the least loaded catalyst.\n          12.

Gallium-based catalysts, including gallium-based zeolites and gallium(III) oxide (Ga2O3) and related materials, are receiving significant attention as alternative catalysts for alkane conversion, particularly for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to their high selectivity for propylene. Various computational and experimental studies have aimed to identify the active sites involved in these processes, but the exact nature of these sites remains a subject of discussion. Recent research has focused on preparing silica-supported gallium species through electrostatic adsorption methods, where the structure of the active sites is currently unknown. Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) provides a method for generating well-defined gallium surface species on different supports by grafting tailored molecular precursors onto supports with isolated hydroxyl (OH) sites. It has been reasoned that developing an appropriate molecular precursor could enable the creation of well-defined isolated gallium active sites outside of bulk Ga2O3. A two-step process, combining SOMC and thermolytic molecular precursor approaches, has been used to generate isolated surface sites with controlled oxidation state and nuclearity. In this work, the synthesis and structural characterization of the molecular complex [Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)] (1) and its application as a precursor for generating gallium single-sites on silica are described. The isolated gallium sites were formed by grafting this complex onto silica followed by a thermolysis step at 500°C under high vacuum.

Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) provides a method for generating well-defined gallium surface species on different supports by grafting tailored molecular precursors onto supports with isolated hydroxyl (OH) sites. It has been reasoned that developing an appropriate molecular precursor could enable the creation of well-defined isolated gallium active sites outside of bulk Ga2O3. A two-step process, combining SOMC and thermolytic molecular precursor approaches, has been used to generate isolated surface sites with controlled oxidation state and nuclearity. In this work, the synthesis and structural characterization of the molecular complex [Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)] (1) and its application as a precursor for generating gallium single-sites on silica are described. The isolated gallium sites were formed by grafting this complex onto silica followed by a thermolysis step at 500°C under high vacuum. The presented gallium species exhibit unprecedented catalytic performances, featuring high activity, selectivity, and stability in propane dehydrogenation, which contributes to the advancement of PDH technology and the development of more efficient catalysts for propylene production.", "Doi": "10.1039/c6sc05178b"},
