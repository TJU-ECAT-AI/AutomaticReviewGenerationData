The growing demand for propylene and the adoption of alternative feedstocks, such as shale gas, have intensified the pressure for propene production and the development of light alkane dehydrogenation processes. Gallium-based catalysts, including gallium-based zeolites and gallium(III) oxide (Ga2O3) and related materials, are receiving significant attention as alternative catalysts for alkane conversion, particularly for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to their high selectivity for propylene. Various computational and experimental studies have aimed to identify the active sites involved in these processes, but the exact nature of these sites remains a subject of discussion.

The introduction of Zn cations into the H-ZSM5 catalyst enhances its performance in PDH processes by increasing the rate of propane conversion and propene dehydrogenation, thus leading to higher selectivity for unsaturated products. This improvement is achieved by avoiding the preferential removal of hydrogen atoms during the formation of light alkanes.
