Gallium-based catalysts, including gallium-based zeolites and gallium(III) oxide (Ga2O3) and related materials, are receiving significant attention as alternative catalysts for alkane conversion, particularly for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to their high selectivity for propylene. Various computational and experimental studies have aimed to identify the active sites involved in these processes, but the exact nature of these sites remains a subject of discussion. Recent research has focused on preparing silica-supported gallium species through electrostatic adsorption methods, where the structure of the active sites is currently unknown. Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) provides a method for generating well-defined gallium surface species on different supports by grafting tailored molecular precursors onto supports with isolated hydroxyl (OH) sites. It has been reasoned that developing an appropriate molecular precursor could enable the creation of well-defined isolated gallium active sites outside of bulk Ga2O3.

Gallium-based catalysts, including gallium-based zeolites and gallium(III) oxide (Ga2O3) and related materials, are receiving significant attention as alternative catalysts for alkane conversion, particularly for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to their high selectivity for propylene. Various computational and experimental studies have aimed to identify the active sites involved in these processes, but the exact nature of these sites remains a subject of discussion. Recent research has focused on preparing silica-supported gallium species through electrostatic adsorption methods, where the structure of the active sites is currently unknown. Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) provides a method for generating well-defined gallium surface species on different supports by grafting tailored molecular precursors onto supports with isolated hydroxyl (OH) sites. It has been reasoned that developing an appropriate molecular precursor could enable the creation of well-defined isolated gallium active sites outside of bulk Ga2O3.
