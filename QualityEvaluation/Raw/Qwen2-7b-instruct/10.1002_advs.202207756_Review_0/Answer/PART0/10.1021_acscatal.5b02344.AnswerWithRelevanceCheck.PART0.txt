          [1] "The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), leading to the emergence of organometallic cobalt-catalyzed CH activation as a viable tool for step-economical functionalization and assembly of organic molecules."
          [2] "Low-valent cobalt-catalysis has set the stage for various CH functionalizations, including arylations, alkenylations, benzylations, and alkylations of arenes and alkenes under mild conditions."
          [3] "The discovery of high-valent cobalt(II) and cobalt(III) catalysis has further advanced the field, offering versatile CH functionalization processes with air-stable precursors that exhibit excellent functional group tolerance at low catalyst loadings."
          [4] "The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
          [5] "Recent research has focused on the nature of active Ga species within these catalysts."
          [6] "Contrary to earlier beliefs, it has been found that Ga atoms do not act as acid sites. Instead, they play a role in the formation of oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for the catalytic activity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 in PDH."

          丙烯需求的增长已经推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），导致了有机分子的步骤经济化功能化和组装的有效工具——有机金属钴催化CH激活的出现。低价钴催化作用为各种CH功能化提供了舞台，包括芳基化、烯基化、苯基化和烷基化等在温和条件下的都是反应。高价钴(II)和钴(III)催化体系的发现进一步推动了该领域的进展，提供了具有空气稳定前体的多功能CH功能化过程，这些前体在低催化剂负载下表现出出色的功能团兼容性。最近的研究集中在这些催化剂中活性Ga物种的本质上，发现Ga原子不充当酸性位点，而是参与了氧空位的形成，这是Ga/H-ZSM-5在PDH中的催化活性的关键。
