          [1] "Despite the presence of similar intermetallic phases in the XRD patterns, i.e. Pt3Co, the varying (PtCo):(PtPt) ratios in the FT magnitude EXAFS at the Pt LIII edge and the presence of two phases in some of the XRD patterns suggest that the average compositions of the nanoparticles among the catalysts are not similar."
          [2] "At very low Co loadings, there are two phases: metallic Pt and a smaller ordered Pt3Co alloy phase. As the Co loading increases, an ordered Pt3Co alloy phase is formed. At high Co loading, formation of a more Co-rich PtCo alloy phase is likely and metallic Co nanoparticles are also present."

          Although the XRD patterns exhibit similar intermetallic phases like Pt3Co, the differing (PtCo):(PtPt) ratios in the EXAFS spectra at the Pt LIII edge and the presence of multiple phases in some XRD patterns indicate that the average compositions of the nanoparticles across the catalysts are distinct. At low Co loadings, the catalysts consist of metallic Pt and a smaller ordered Pt3Co alloy phase; as Co loading increases, an ordered Pt3Co alloy phase is formed. At high Co loadings, a more Co-rich PtCo alloy phase is likely present alongside metallic Co nanoparticles.

          尽管XRD模式显示相似的互金属相如Pt3Co，但在Pt LIII边的EXAFS谱中（PtCo）：（PtPt）比的差异以及某些XRD模式中存在的多个相表明催化剂中纳米颗粒的平均组成各不相同。在低Co负载下，催化剂包含金属Pt和较小的有序Pt3Co合金相；随着Co负载增加，形成有序的Pt3Co合金相。在高Co负载下，更富含Co的PtCo合金相以及金属Co纳米颗粒可能同时存在。
