        The evolving landscape of propylene production has seen a significant shift towards more efficient and selective methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH), driven by the escalating demand for propylene. The development of new production methods, particularly PDH, has been accompanied by advancements in understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, which have become pivotal in propylene production. This review focuses on the pivotal role of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH, emphasizing the ongoing scientific debate surrounding the active Ga species and the contributions of recent research findings to our current knowledge of these catalysts.

        Recent studies have emphasized the importance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, highlighting their high activity and selectivity. The ongoing debate about the active Ga species underscores the complexity of catalyst function in PDH. This discussion has been enriched by recent research findings that have contributed to a better understanding of these catalysts. These advancements include the elucidation of mechanisms involved in PDH processes and the role of Ga species within the catalyst structure.

        Key studies have also focused on the use of gallium (Ga)-based catalysts, notably those supported on silica, as highly active, selective, and stable propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The isolation of gallium sites through electrostatic adsorption methods and surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) have demonstrated unprecedented catalytic performances in propane dehydrogenation, combining high activity, selectivity, and stability.

        The scientific discourse on Ga species' activity in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts continues to evolve, with recent research findings providing valuable insights into the nature of active sites and the role of gallium species. These advancements have not only refined our understanding of PDH technology but also paved the way for the development of more efficient catalysts that can meet the growing demand for propylene.
