        The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This demand has led to a surge in interest in PDH technology as a means to produce propylene efficiently. Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved considerably, addressing the ongoing debate about active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, shedding light on their mechanisms and optimization.

        The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030. PDH can be broadly grouped into two categories: non-oxidative and oxidative. Among these, the Catofin process employs fixed-bed reactors with CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts containing more than 18% CrOx as the active ingredient and 12 wt% alkaline metals as promoters. The Oleflex process employs fluidized bed reactors with Pt-based catalysts, with propane conversion and propylene selectivity of 30-40% and 85.5-88%, respectively.

        The expanding demand for propylene has propelled the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), influencing the evolution of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. Recent studies have illuminated Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, despite an ongoing debate over active Ga species. These advancements reflect the industry's response to the escalating demand for propylene, driven by the high cost of platinum and environmental concerns, leading to the development of more sustainable and cost-effective alternatives.

        As the demand for propylene surged, necessitating an expansion in production capacity from 130 to 191 megatons by 2030, new methods emerged, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH techniques, such as the Catofin and Oleflex processes, utilize distinct catalysts—CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-based, respectively—to enhance efficiency. The Catofin process employs fixed-bed reactors with high chromium oxide content and alkaline metal promoters, while Oleflex uses fluidized bed reactors with Pt-based catalysts. This shift reflects the industry's response to the escalating demand for propylene, driven by the high cost of platinum and environmental concerns, leading to the development of more sustainable and cost-effective alternatives.
