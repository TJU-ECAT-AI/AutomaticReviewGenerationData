            <c>Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [14].</c>\n          <c>The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst [5].</c>\n          <c>For Pt-based catalysts, the electronic modification by promoters and the specific interaction with the optimized supports lead to the enhancement in both catalytic activity and stability [611].</c>\n          <c>However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process.</c>\n          <c>Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge [1224].</c>\n          <c>Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability.</c>\n          <c>Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction.</c>\n          <c>Understanding the behavior of gallium (Ga) in H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has been a subject of ongoing research due to its critical role in enhancing the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.</c>\n          <c>Recent studies have focused on elucidating the nature of active Ga species within H-ZSM-5, aiming to optimize their presence for improved PDH performance.</c>\n          <c>The debate around the identity and reactivity of Ga species in H-ZSM-5 has been central to advancing the design and application of PDH catalysts.</c>\n          <c>Research findings suggest that specific configurations and interactions of Ga atoms within the zeolite framework contribute significantly to the catalyst's efficiency in PDH reactions.</c>\n          <c>Driven by the rising demand for propylene, new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH), have emerged, aiming to replace traditional Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for lower costs and environmental benefits.</c>\n          <c>Research on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, central to PDH, has evolved, focusing on enhancing catalyst selectivity and activity.</c>\n          <c>Understanding the active Ga species and optimizing Al2O3's structure in adsorption and activation are pivotal for reducing coke deposition.</c>\n          <c>Recent studies highlight the importance of tailored CoAl2O3 composites for improved selectivity and stability, addressing the ongoing scientific debate on Ga catalysts in PDH.</c>\n          <c>From the study of reference [1],
