                The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This demand has led to a surge in research aimed at enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of PDH processes. Among the various catalysts utilized in PDH reactions, the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have garnered considerable attention due to their potential for high activity and selectivity. However, the understanding of the Ga species involved in the catalytic process remains a subject of debate within the scientific community. Recent studies have contributed to a more nuanced understanding of the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, shedding light on the nature of active Ga species and the factors influencing their performance.

                The increasing propylene demand combined with the use of alternative feedstocks such as shale gas has amplified the pressure towards propene production and the development of light alkane dehydrogenation processes. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a key process for propene production, with traditional catalysts like CrAl2O3 (CATOFIN) and PtSnAl2O3 (Oleflex) facing challenges in terms of cost and environmental impact. This has led to an increased interest in exploring alternative catalysts, with gallium (Ga)-based catalysts, notably those supported on silica, gaining prominence. Recent research has emphasized the synthesis of gallium species on silica surfaces through electrostatic adsorption and surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), yielding isolated gallium sites that display unprecedented catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. These advancements underscore the potential of gallium-based catalysts for optimizing PDH technology and enhancing propylene production efficiency.

                Silica-supported gallium species have been recently prepared by electrostatic adsorption methods, highlighting the versatility of these techniques in synthesizing active gallium sites. Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) allows for the generation of well-defined surface species on a variety of supports via grafting of tailored molecular precursors on supports with isolated OH sites. These isolated gallium sites were achieved through grafting of 1 on silica followed by a thermolysis step at 500Â°C under high vacuum, resulting in catalysts that are stable and exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane.

                The stability of the catalyst probably results from site-isolation of the active site on a non-reducible support such as silica, diminishing facile reduction typical of Ga2O3 catalysts. The presented gallium species display unprecedented catalytic performances, combining high activity, selectivity, and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane. This highlights the importance of precise catalyst design in enhancing PDH efficiency and addressing future challenges in creating nanostructured catalysts (NCs) with tailored morphologies and active sites, as well as advancing scalable synthesis technologies.
