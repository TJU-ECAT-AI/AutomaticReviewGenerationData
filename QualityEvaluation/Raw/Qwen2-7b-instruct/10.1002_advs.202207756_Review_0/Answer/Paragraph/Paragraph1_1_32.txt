            <c>Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [14].</c>\n          <c>The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst [5].</c>\n          <c>For Pt-based catalysts, the electronic modification by promoters and the specific interaction with the optimized supports lead to the enhancement in both catalytic activity and stability [611].</c>\n          <c>However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process.</c>\n          <c>Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge [1224].</c>\n          <c>Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability.</c>\n          <c>Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction.</c>\n          <c>Recent studies on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH have contributed to the ongoing debate about the active Ga species. These catalysts show high activity and selectivity in PDH reactions, highlighting the evolving science behind optimizing PDH processes.</c>\n          <c>Dehydrogenation is of renewed interest due to the large availability of new feedstocks derived from hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operations [4]. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is of particular interest, since propylene is a crucial feedstock for polymer production [2]. Improved PDH catalysts are continuously sought [3]. Recently, PDH catalysts involving group IIIA metal oxides have attracted attention. Since each single oxide component exhibited some activity, we hypothesized that the mixed InGa oxide catalysts could show interesting PDH properties different from the two individual oxide catalysts [5]. The resulting mixed-metal oxides exhibit a considerably higher activity in terms of propane conversion than previously reported mixed In2O3Al2O3, as well as compared to -Ga2O3, on both a catalyst mass basis and surface area basis [6].</c>\n          <c>Driven by the escalating demand for propylene, new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH), have emerged, focusing on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH production. Recent research has illuminated debates on active Ga species, enhancing our understanding of these catalysts, and contributing to the evolving landscape of propylene production.</c>\n          <c>Trends in PDH catalyst development, particularly those involving gallium (Ga)-based catalysts, highlight the ongoing scientific discourse around active Ga species. These catalysts, including Ga/H-ZSM-5, have shown promise in enhancing PDH efficiency, but the debate over their active components continues. Recent research findings have provided insights into the nature of these species, contributing to a better understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts' role in PDH processes. This section synthesizes these advancements, emphasizing the pivotal role of PDH in responding to propylene demand and the evolution of catalyst knowledge.</c>\n          <c>The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH offers a pathway to produce propylene from propane, potentially from renewable sources, highlighting the evolving landscape of propylene production.</c>\n          <c>In the realm of PDH, there has been considerable interest in the use of gallium (Ga)-based catalysts. However, the nature of the active Ga species has been a subject of ongoing debate among researchers. Recent studies have provided insights into the role of Ga in PDH catalysts, contributing to our current understanding.</c>\n          <c>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been a focus area due to its importance in the chemical industry, especially as a route to produce propylene. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, reflecting ongoing debates about the active Ga species and recent research findings contributing to current knowledge of these catalysts. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, shedding light on the role of gallium in the PDH reaction.</c>\n          <c>This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the advancements in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) production, with a particular emphasis on the development and ongoing scientific debate surrounding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. It delves into the evolution of PDH technology, the role of Ga species in catalytic activity, and the latest research findings that have contributed to our understanding of these catalysts. The discussion encompasses the challenges faced in the PDH process, such as catalyst deactivation and coke formation, and the strategies proposed to overcome these issues. This synthesis highlights the importance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in the efficient production of propylene, underscoring the pivotal role of PDH in the petrochemical industry and the continuous efforts to optimize these catalysts for enhanced performance.</c>\n          <c>As demand for propylene grows, so too does the need for more efficient and sustainable production methods. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) emerges as a key process in this context, offering a cleaner alternative to traditional methods. The focus on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts represents a significant advancement in PDH technology, with ongoing debates about the active Ga species driving further research and innovation. Recent studies have provided insights into the mechanisms underlying PDH catalysis, highlighting the potential of these catalysts to meet the escalating demand for propylene in a more environmentally friendly manner.</c>\n          <c>Advancements in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology have been pivotal in responding to the growing demand for propylene, particularly in the realm of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. These catalysts, with their potential for high activity and selectivity in PDH reactions, have become a focal point in the ongoing scientific discourse on active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to a better understanding of these catalysts, underscoring their role in propylene production and the evolving landscape of petrochemical industry practices.</c>\n          <c>The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH) [1]. PDH technologies, i.e., the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr. Many other catalysts for PDH have been investigated, including Ga-, Zn-, Co-, Fe-, V-, Zr-based materials, and nanocarbon catalysts. Metal cations (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, etc.) exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-5 have shown promising alkane dehydrogenation properties as well: among them, Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation. They showed that In2O3, initially present on the external surface of CHA, can be reduced and then reacts with the Brnsted acid sites (BASs) of the zeolite to form an indium-exchanged (In+) CHA catalyst through the so-called reductive solid-state-ion exchange (RSSIE) process. This point has also been debated in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with respect to propane dehydrogenation. Bell and coworkers believe that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species; however, Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active sites, a model supported by results from our laboratory.</c>\n          <c>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a promising and booming method for direct propylene production, driven by the growing demand for propylene and the affordability of propane from shale gas. This preview highlights some recent important works that are moving forward the propane dehydrogenation process toward high performance with excellent propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and durability.
