            随着丙烯需求的不断增长以及页岩气等替代原料的使用，对丙烯生产的需求和开发轻烷烃脱氢过程的压力也随之增加。这一背景下，PDH成为了重点关注的领域，尤其是在丙烯生产中的重要性。传统的工业PDH过程主要采用CrAl2O3（CATOFIN）和PtSnAl2O3（Oleflex）支撑催化剂，而近年来，镓基催化剂因其潜在的高活性和选择性，受到越来越多的关注作为替代催化剂。

            近期研究通过静电吸附方法制备了硅酸盐支持的镓物种，并利用表面有机金属化学（SOMC）技术，通过在具有孤立羟基位点的支持体上接枝定制分子前体来生成各种支撑材料上的孤立镓物种。这些孤立的镓位点通过在硅酸盐上进行接枝后，在高温下进行热解步骤制得，展现出高度稳定的特性，从而在非可还原性支持如硅酸盐上隔离活性位点，避免了镓氧化物催化剂常见的易还原问题。这些硅酸盐支持的孤立镓物种被证明是高效的、选择性和稳定的丙烷脱氢催化剂，其在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出前所未有的催化性能，结合了高活性、选择性和稳定性。

            这一研究不仅推动了PDH技术的优化，还为高效催化剂的开发提供了重要启示，特别是对于丙烯生产的效率和可持续性提升。展望未来，随着对镓/H-ZSM-5催化剂和PDH过程的深入研究，预计会有更多创新的催化设计和优化策略出现，以进一步提高丙烯产率和选择性，同时满足对丙烯日益增长的需求并应对环境挑战。
