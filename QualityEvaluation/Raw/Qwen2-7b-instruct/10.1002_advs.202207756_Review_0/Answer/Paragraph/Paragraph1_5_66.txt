                The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift has led to a surge in research aimed at enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of PDH processes. Among the various catalysts utilized in PDH reactions, the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have garnered considerable attention due to their potential for high activity and selectivity. However, the understanding of the Ga species involved in the catalytic process remains a subject of debate within the scientific community. Recent studies have contributed to a more nuanced understanding of the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, shedding light on the nature of active Ga species and the factors influencing their performance.
