        <p>Driven by the escalating demand for propylene, new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH), have emerged, focusing on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. These catalysts' evolving understanding, particularly concerning active gallium species, reflects ongoing scientific debates. Recent research highlights significant advancements in PDH technology, offering insights into catalyst functionality. As per quotes, this development underscores PDH's importance and the catalysts' advancing understanding, encompassing the shift towards more efficient and sustainable PDH methods, underpinning the evolving landscape of propylene production.</p>
        
        <p>The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH technologies, i.e., the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr. Many other catalysts for PDH have been investigated including Ga-, Zn-, Co-, Fe-, V-, Zr-based materials, and nanocarbon catalysts. Gallium (Ga)-based materials, notably gallium exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-5, have shown promising alkane dehydrogenation properties. Research now centers on the active gallium species in these catalysts, amid a debate on whether single [GaH]2+ sites or Ga+H+ pairs are the stable active sites. Indium (In) on chabazite zeolite surfaces, through a reductive solid-state-ion exchange (RSSIE) process, further diversifies the catalyst landscape.</p>
        
        <p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) offers a pathway to produce propylene from propane, potentially from renewable sources. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been a focus of recent research due to their potential in PDH. The debate surrounding active gallium species in these catalysts continues, with differing opinions on the exact role of gallium. Research has contributed to our understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, revealing insights into the active sites and the role of gallium species in PDH efficiency. This understanding has advanced propylene production technology, aiming to optimize PDH processes for greater efficiency and sustainability.</p>
        
        <p>The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030. PDH can be broadly grouped into two categories: non-oxidative and oxidative. Among these, the Catofin process employs fixed-bed reactors with CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts containing more than 18% CrOx as the active ingredient and 12 wt% alkaline metals as promoters. The Oleflex process employs fluidized bed reactors with Pt-based catalysts, with propane conversion and propylene selectivity of 30-40% and 85.5-88%, respectively. This shift reflects the industry's response to the escalating demand for propylene, driven by the high cost of platinum and environmental concerns, leading to the development of more sustainable and cost-effective alternatives.</p>
