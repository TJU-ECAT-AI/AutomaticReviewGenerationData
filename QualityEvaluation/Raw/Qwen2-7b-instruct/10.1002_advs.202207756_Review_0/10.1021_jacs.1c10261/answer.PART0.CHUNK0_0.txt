The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly focusing on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to achieve more efficient and environmentally friendly processes. Traditionally, Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been utilized due to their high activity and selectivity in PDH. However, the active Ga species on these catalysts remain a topic of debate, with various theories suggesting different forms of Ga as the active site. Recent research has contributed to our current understanding of these catalysts, providing insights into the role of specific Ga species and their interaction with the zeolite framework. These studies have led to improvements in catalyst design and performance, enhancing the efficiency of PDH catalysis.
