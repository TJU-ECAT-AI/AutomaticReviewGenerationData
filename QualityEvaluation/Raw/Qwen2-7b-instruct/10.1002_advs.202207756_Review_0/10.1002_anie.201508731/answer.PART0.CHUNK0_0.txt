[1] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene is an established large-scale process that, however, faces challenges, particularly in catalyst development; these are the toxicity of chromium compounds, high cost of platinum, and catalyst durability."
[2] "Propene, used in the chemical industry for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs is mainly produced from crude oil."
[3] "In view of finite petroleum reserves but growing demand for this olefin, vast reserves of shale gas consisting predominantly of methane and of lower amounts of ethane and propane1 could provide an economical alternative to crude oil."
[4] "Consequently, demand for PDH catalysts will also increase."
[5] "Commercial catalysts with CrOx or PtSn species typically supported on Al2O33 are either toxic or have a limited availability of the active components."
[6] "Recently, Weckhuysen and co-workers5 developed an active Al2O3-supported catalyst consisting of two typical propane dehydrogenation components, that is, Pt and Ga2O3."
[7] "The noble metal was assumed to participate directly in PDH through assisting in the recombination of hydrogen atoms thus helping the active Ga3+ sites to recover."
[8] "Importantly, dispersed ZrOx species supported on SiO2 or Al2O3SiO2 are significantly less active than Zrcus on the surface of bulk ZrO2-based catalysts."
[9] "Our working hypothesis was that oxides of metals which usually have an unchangeable oxidation state but a high oxygen mobility can generate the required defects under PDH conditions."
[10] "Remarkably, pristine LaZrOx with the weakest metaloxygen bond gave an even higher rate than the catalysts with Ru or RhNPs on SiO2Al2O3 and slightly lower than Pt/SiO2Al2O3."
[11] "Based on the results presented above and mechanistic studies on alkane dehydrogenation over CrOx-containing12 and GaOx-containing7d,13 catalysts, we postulate that Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen participate in the CH bond activation resulting in the formation of ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species."
[12] "Control experiments with ZrOx/SiO2 and ZrOx/SiAlOx revealed that the surface Zr4+cus of bulk LaZrOx are significantly more active than supported ZrOx species."
[13] "All these catalysts revealed up to five-times higher rate of propene formation than LaZrOx, with Cu(0.05wt%)/LaZrOx showing the highest rate among them."
[14] "It also showed propene selectivity above 90% (FigureS7)."
[15] "Our preliminary results revealed that such catalysts could even find their application for dehydrogenation of iso- or n-butanes to generate corresponding olefins or dienes, which are also important building blocks of the chemical industry."

In response to the growing demand for propylene, new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), have been developed to address the limitations of traditional methods, such as the toxicity of chromium compounds, high cost of platinum, and catalyst durability. Recent research has focused on bulk metal oxides with lattice defects as active sites, leading to the development of catalysts like those based on ZrO2. These catalysts feature coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) as the active sites for PDH. The concentration of these active sites can be adjusted by doping ZrO2 with metal oxides or depositing small amounts of hydrogenation-active metals. For instance, Cu(0.05wt%)/LaZrOx catalysts have shown high activity and durability over 240 hours in a series of 60 PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles, indicating their potential for industrial application. Moreover, this research has contributed to the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, highlighting the role of Ga species in the activation of CH bonds, and suggesting that Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen participate in this process. The use of alternative materials like YZrOx, TiZrOx, and CeZrOx has also been explored, showcasing the versatility of ZrO2-based catalysts in various dehydrogenation reactions, including the dehydrogenation of iso- or n-butanes to generate olefins or dienes.

为了应对对丙烯日益增长的需求，新的生产方法，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），已被开发以解决传统方法的限制，例如铬化合物的毒性、铂的成本高和催化剂的耐用性。近期的研究集中在具有表面缺陷的多金属氧化物上作为活性位点，导致基于ZrO2的催化剂的发展。这些催化剂的特点是表面配位不饱和的Zr离子（Zrcus）作为PDH的活性位点。这些活性位点的浓度可以通过掺杂ZrO2或沉积少量氢化活性金属来调整。例如，Cu(0.05wt%)/LaZrOx催化剂在一系列60个PDH/氧化再生循环中显示出了高活性和耐用性超过240小时，表明其可能用于工业应用。此外，这项研究为Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的PDH作用提供了了解，强调了Ga物种在CH键活化中的作用，并指出Zrcus和相邻的晶格氧参与此过程。还探索了诸如YZrOx、TiZrOx和CeZrOx等替代材料的应用，展示了ZrO2基催化剂在各种脱氢反应中的灵活性，包括异丁烷或正丁烷的脱氢生成相应的烯烃或二烯。
