[1] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene is an established large-scale process that, however, faces challenges, particularly in catalyst development; these are the toxicity of chromium compounds, high cost of platinum, and catalyst durability."
[2] "Propene, used in the chemical industry for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs is mainly produced from crude oil."
[3] "Consequently, demand for PDH catalysts will also increase."
[4] "Commercial catalysts with CrOx or PtSn species typically supported on Al2O33 are either toxic or have a limited availability of the active components."
[5] "Recently, Weckhuysen and co-workers5 developed an active Al2O3-supported catalyst consisting of two typical propane dehydrogenation components, that is, Pt and Ga2O3."
[6] "Our mechanistic analysis led us to the conclusion that coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus, where cus=coordinatively unsaturated) are the active sites possessing PDH activity and selectivity comparable to those of an industrially relevant CrOx-containing catalyst."
[7] "The main side products were light hydrocarbons and coke."
[8] "Our preliminary results revealed that such catalysts could even find their application for dehydrogenation of iso- or n-butanes to generate corresponding olefins or dienes, which are also important building blocks of the chemical industry."
[9] "Such sites can be created by promoting ZrO2 with metal oxides, which induce formation of structural anion vacancies or enhance ZrO2 reducibility."

In response to the growing demand for propylene, new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), have been developed to reduce reliance on crude oil as a feedstock. The use of chromium compounds in commercial catalysts is problematic due to their toxicity, and platinum, though effective, is costly. Recent advancements have focused on developing alternative catalysts, such as those containing gallium (Ga) and zirconia (ZrO2), which aim to address these issues while maintaining or improving efficiency and selectivity. Research has identified coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations as active sites in ZrO2-based catalysts, which offer comparable PDH activity and selectivity to industrially relevant chromium oxide catalysts. These catalysts can also be tailored to efficiently dehydrogenate iso- or n-butanes, generating olefins or dienes, which are crucial components in various chemical industries. The use of gallium in these catalysts, along with promoting ZrO2 with metal oxides, enhances the reducibility of ZrO2 and the concentration of active sites, contributing to improved catalyst performance and sustainability in propylene production.

面对丙烯需求的增长，新的生产方法，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），已被开发以减少对原油作为原料的依赖。由于商用催化剂中铬化合物的毒性问题，以及铂金虽然有效但成本高昂，因此近年来在发展替代催化剂方面取得了进展，这些催化剂旨在解决这些问题的同时保持或提高效率和选择性。研究已确定锆氧物种中的配位不饱和锆离子作为活性位点，在锆基催化剂中具有与工业上相关氧化铬催化剂相当的PDH活性和选择性。这些催化剂甚至可以被调整用于异丁烷或正丁烷的脱氢，生成相应的烯烃或二烯，这对于化学工业来说也是关键的组成部分。在这些催化剂中使用镓，以及通过金属氧化物促进锆氧物种，可以增强锆氧物种的可还原性和活性位点的浓度，从而提高催化剂性能和可持续性，在丙烯生产中发挥重要作用。
