[1] "Propene, used in the chemical industry for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs is mainly produced from crude oil."
[2] "In view of finite petroleum reserves but growing demand for this olefin, vast reserves of shale gas consisting predominantly of methane and of lower amounts of ethane and propane1 could provide an economical alternative to crude oil."
[3] "One way to convert propane to propene is the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is a successful example of raw-material change in the chemical industry."
[4] "Recently, Weckhuysen and co-workers5 developed an active Al2O3-supported catalyst consisting of two typical propane dehydrogenation components, that is, Pt and Ga2O3."
[5] "Our mechanistic analysis led us to the conclusion that coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus, where cus=coordinatively unsaturated) are the active sites possessing PDH activity and selectivity comparable to those of an industrially relevant CrOx-containing catalyst."
[6] "Significantly higher Ea values were obtained in a second series of tests (Figure2), when the catalysts were reduced at the same temperature, at which the rate of propene formation was measured, that is, at 525, 550, and 575C."
[7] "Accordingly designed Cu(0.05wt%)/ZrO2-La2O3 showed industrially relevant activity and durability over ca. 240h on stream in a series of 60dehydrogenation and oxidative regeneration cycles between 550 and 625C."
[8] "Our working hypothesis was that oxides of metals which usually have an unchangeable oxidation state but a high oxygen mobility can generate the required defects under PDH conditions."
[9] "Importantly, dispersed ZrOx species supported on SiO2 or Al2O3SiO2 are significantly less active than Zrcus on the surface of bulk ZrO2-based catalysts."
[10] "Our preliminary results revealed that such catalysts could even find their application for dehydrogenation of iso- or n-butanes to generate corresponding olefins or dienes, which are also important building blocks of the chemical industry."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by encouraging researchers to explore alternative methods to utilize abundant natural gas resources. Traditionally, propylene was mainly produced from crude oil, but the finite petroleum reserves and increasing demand for propylene have led to the search for alternatives. Shale gas, rich in methane with lower amounts of ethane and propane, offers a viable substitute. The non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is recognized as a successful method to convert propane to propene, marking a significant shift in raw material usage in the chemical industry.

Regarding the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, early research focused on the active Ga species, with debates around their identity and mechanism of action. Recent studies have contributed to our current knowledge by identifying coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) as the active sites for PDH, comparable to industrially relevant CrOx-containing catalysts. These findings suggest that the active sites in these catalysts are not directly related to the presence of Ga or Pt, but rather to the creation of defects in the ZrO2 lattice through the presence of other metal oxides. This insight has led to the development of novel catalysts based on ZrO2 promoted with various metal oxides, capable of generating active sites through structural anion vacancies or enhanced reducibility. These catalysts have shown promising activity and durability, particularly when using metals like Cu, Ni, or Co instead of traditional Pt or Ga.

These advancements in understanding and utilizing ZrO2-based catalysts for PDH not only offer a more sustainable and economically viable route to propylene production but also pave the way for the potential application of these catalysts in the dehydrogenation of butanes to generate olefins or dienes, which are crucial building blocks in the chemical industry.

丙烯需求的增长已经推动了新型生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），这鼓励研究人员探索利用丰富天然气资源的新途径。传统上，丙烯主要从石油中生产，但有限的石油储备和对丙烯的日益增长的需求促使人们寻找替代方案。丰富的页岩气含有大量的甲烷，以及较少的乙烷和丙烷，提供了一种经济可行的替代方案。非氧化性丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程被公认为是将丙烷转化为丙烯的成功例子，标志着化学工业原料使用方式的重大转变。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解，早期的研究集中在活性Ga物种上，围绕它们的身份和作用机制存在争议。近期的研究为当前的知识贡献提供了依据，通过识别ZrO2表面的可配位不饱和锆离子（Zrcus）作为PDH的活性中心，与工业相关CrOx催化剂的活性和选择性相当。这些发现表明，这些催化剂中的活性中心并不直接关联于Ga或Pt的存在，而是通过其他金属氧化物在ZrO2晶格中产生缺陷来实现。这一洞察导致了基于促进ZrO2的多种金属氧化物开发新型催化剂的发展，这些催化剂能够通过结构阴离子空位或增强可还原性生成活性中心。这些催化剂显示出了令人满意的活性和耐用性，特别是当使用Cu、Ni或Co等金属替代传统的Pt或Ga时。

这些在理解和利用ZrO2基催化剂方面取得的进展不仅为丙烯生产提供了一个更可持续和经济上可行的途径，而且还为应用这些催化剂到丁烷脱氢生成烯烃或二烯烃开辟了道路，这些化合物是化学工业的重要组成部分。
