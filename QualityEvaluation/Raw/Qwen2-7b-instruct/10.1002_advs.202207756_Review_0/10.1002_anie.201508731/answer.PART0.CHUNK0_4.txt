<p>Propene, used in the chemical industry for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs is mainly produced from crude oil. In view of finite petroleum reserves but growing demand for this olefin, vast reserves of shale gas consisting predominantly of methane and of lower amounts of ethane and propane1 could provide an economical alternative to crude oil.2One way to convert propane to propene is the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is a successful example of raw-material change in the chemical industry.</p>
<p>Comprehensive characterization supports the hypothesis that coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. Their concentration can be adjusted by varying the kind of ZrO2 promoter and/or supporting tiny amounts of hydrogenation-active metal.</p>
<p>Remarkably, pristine LaZrOx with the weakest metal-oxygen bond gave an even higher rate than the catalysts with Ru or Rh NPs on SiO2Al2O3 and slightly lower than Pt/SiO2Al2O3.</p>
<p>To further validate our hypothesis about the kind of PDH active sites, we measured the rate of propene formation over LaZrOx, Ru/LaZrOx, and Rh/LaZrOx at different reaction temperatures.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Cu(0.05wt%)/LaZrOx catalyst was only two-times less active than the Ru(0.05wt%)/LaZrOx catalyst.</p>
<p>Our preliminary results revealed that such catalysts could even find their application for dehydrogenation of iso- or n-butanes to generate corresponding olefins or dienes, which are also important building blocks of the chemical industry.</p>

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by shifting focus towards utilizing alternative feedstocks like shale gas. This is due to the finite reserves of petroleum and the increasing demand for propylene, leading to the exploration of non-conventional sources for propylene production. PDH is considered an effective raw-material change in the chemical industry, offering an economical alternative to traditional crude oil-based processes. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with ongoing debates about active Ga species, highlighting the importance of identifying and optimizing active sites for efficient PDH reactions. Recent research findings have contributed to a deeper insight into the role of coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations as active sites in PDH, emphasizing the potential of bulk metal oxides with lattice defects as catalysts. The use of hydrogenation-active metals like copper has shown promise in enhancing the activity of these catalysts, with Cu(0.05wt%)/LaZrOx demonstrating high performance and stability over multiple cycles, comparable to industrially relevant catalysts. These catalysts not only improve propene production efficiency but also expand their applicability to dehydrogenation of other hydrocarbons, contributing to the diversification of chemical industry feedstocks and processes.
