[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."

1. The rising demand for propylene and the low cost of propane from shale gas have sparked renewed interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Researchers have explored various catalysts for PDH, including Ga-, Zn-, Co-, Fe-, V-, Zr-based materials, and nanocarbon catalysts. Zeolite H-ZSM-5, when modified with Ga ions, has demonstrated high stability and propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation.

2. Indium (In) on zeolite chabazite (CHA) has been found to be a stable and selective catalyst for PDH. Initially, In2O3 is present on the surface of the CHA zeolite. Upon reduction in hydrogen gas, In2O3 is displaced from the Brnsted acid sites (BASs) of the zeolite, forming extra-framework In+ species. This process, known as reductive solid-state-ion exchange (RSSIE), creates an indium-exchanged (In+) CHA catalyst.

3. There is ongoing debate regarding the active species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. Bell and coworkers propose that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species. However, Schreiber et al. suggested that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active sites, a model supported by findings from their laboratory.

1. 对丙烯日益增长的需求以及从页岩气中获得的廉价丙烷推动了丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的关注。研究人员探索了各种催化剂，包括Ga、Zn、Co、Fe、V、Zr基材料和纳米碳催化剂。当将Ga离子引入H-ZSM-5沸石时，它表现出高稳定性和高达90%的丙烯选择性用于丙烷脱氢。

2. 铟（In）在沸石查巴兹特（CHA）上的应用被发现是PDH反应的稳定且选择性高的催化剂。最初，In2O3存在于CHA沸石表面。在氢气气体中进行还原后，In2O3从沸石的Brnsted酸位点（BASs）上移除，形成额外框架的In+物种。这个过程被称为还原固态离子交换（RSSIE），产生了一个掺杂了In+的CHA催化剂。

3. 在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中，关于活性物种存在争议。Bell等人提出单个 [GaH]2+ 离子可能是活性物种。然而，Schreiber等人认为Ga+H+对是稳定的活性物种，这一模型得到了他们实验室研究的支持。
