[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."
[2] "Many other catalysts for PDH have been investigated including Ga-,210 Zn-,11,12 Co-,1315 Fe-,1618 V-,1922 Zr-based materials,2325 and nanocarbon catalysts."
[3] "Among them, Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "They have also shown that the CHA zeolite is superior to other zeolite frameworks for this reaction (BEA, MFI, and MOR) and that an Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates."
[5] "The identification of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was primarily based on ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations."
[6] "However, the spectra used in support of the presence of [InH2]+ were collected at low temperature (below 153 K, after treating with H2 at 773 K), and therefore whether the indium hydride is stable at the reaction temperature (600 C) remains to be determined."
[7] "This point has also been debated in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with respect to propane dehydrogenation."
[8] "Understanding the support impact on indium speciation and the corresponding influence on catalytic performance is thus important to advance In-based catalyst understanding for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."

The growing demand for propylene has spurred interest in PDH, leading to the investigation of various catalysts such as Ga-, Zn-, Co-, Fe-, V-, Zr-based materials, and nanocarbons. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit high stability and propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation. Research indicates that the CHA zeolite is superior for PDH compared to other frameworks like BEA, MFI, and MOR. An Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provides higher dehydrogenation rates. The active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation remains a subject of debate. The support's impact on indium speciation and its correlation with catalytic performance is crucial for advancing In-based catalyst understanding in alkane dehydrogenation.
