[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."
[2] "PDH technologies, i.e., the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr."

[5] "They showed that In2O3, initially present on the external surface of CHA, can be reduced and then reacts with the Brnsted acid sites (BASs) of the zeolite to form an indium-exchanged (In+) CHA catalyst through the so-called reductive solid-state-ion exchange (RSSIE) process."
[6] "Isolated [InH2]+ sites were put forward as the active center in these catalysts based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements."

1. The growing demand for propylene and the low cost of propane derived from shale gas have revived interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional PDH technologies face challenges due to high costs and rapid catalyst deactivation, as well as environmental concerns related to chromium usage.

2. Various alternative catalysts have been explored for PDH, including Ga-, Zn-, Co-, Fe-, V-, Zr-based materials, and nanocarbon catalysts. Ga/H-ZSM-5 stands out for its high stability and propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation.

3. Research indicates that indium (In) in the form of In2O3 on the surface of chabazite zeolite (CHA) can be reduced to form extra-framework In+ species, which then interacts with Brnsted acid sites (BASs) in the zeolite. This process forms an In+-exchanged CHA catalyst through a reductive solid-state-ion exchange (RSSIE).

4. Indium (In) in CHA zeolite has been identified as a potential active site for PDH, with isolated In+ sites playing a crucial role. FTIR spectroscopy and XAFS measurements support the existence of In+ species in these catalysts.

5. The nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH is a topic of debate. Bell et al. suggest single [GaH]2+ sites, while Schreiber et al. propose Ga+H+ pair sites, a model validated by experimental data.

6. The impact of support material on indium speciation and its effect on catalyst performance is critical for advancing the understanding of In-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation.

1. 石油需求的增长和来自页岩气的丙烷成本低廉，使得对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应重新引起了关注。传统的PDH技术存在高成本、铂快速失效以及铬可能带来的环境影响等问题。

2. 各种替代催化剂被用于PDH研究，包括镓（Ga）、锌（Zn）、钴（Co）、铁（Fe）、钒（V）、锆（Zr）基材料和纳米碳催化剂。其中，Ga/H-ZSM-5以其在丙烷脱氢过程中展现出的高稳定性和高丙烯选择性而著称。

3. 研究表明，在CHA沸石表面的氧化铟（In2O3）可以通过还原过程转化为位于额外框架位置的In+物种，并与沸石上的酸性Brnsted位点（BASs）相互作用，形成一个In+-交换的CHA催化剂，这一过程通过所谓的固态离子交换（RSSIE）进行。

4. 在CHA沸石中，铟（In）被认为是PDH反应的关键活性中心，孤立的In+物种在这些催化剂中起着关键作用。傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）和X射线吸收精细结构（XAFS）测量支持In+物种的存在。

5. 关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中活性位点的性质存在争议。贝尔等人认为单个[GaH]2+位点是活性物种；然而，施赖伯等人报告了Ga+H+配对位点是稳定的活性位点，这一模型得到了实验室实验数据的支持。

6. 支撑材料对铟（In）物种化及其对催化剂性能的影响对于推进In基催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的理解至关重要。
