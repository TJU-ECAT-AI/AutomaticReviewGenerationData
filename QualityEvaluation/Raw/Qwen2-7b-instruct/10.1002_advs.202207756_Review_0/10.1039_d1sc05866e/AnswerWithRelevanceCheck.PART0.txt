          [1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."
          [2] "PDH technologies, i.e., the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr."
          [3] "Many other catalysts for PDH have been investigated including Ga-,210 Zn-,11,12 Co-,1315 Fe-,1618 V-,1922 Zr-based materials,2325 and nanocarbon catalysts."
          [4] "Metal cations (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, etc.) exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-52832 have shown promising alkane dehydrogenation properties as well: among them, Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation."
          [5] "They showed that In2O3, initially present on the external surface of CHA, can be reduced and then reacts with the Brnsted acid sites (BASs) of the zeolite to form an indium-exchanged (In+) CHA catalyst through the so-called reductive solid-state-ion exchange (RSSIE) process."
          [6] "This point has also been debated in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with respect to propane dehydrogenation. Bell and coworkers32 believe that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species; however, Schreiber et al.31 reported that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active sites, a model supported by results from our laboratory."

          The growing demand for propylene and the low cost of propane sourced from shale gas have reignited interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional PDH processes, such as the Catofin method employing chromium oxide/alumina catalysts and the Oleflex process utilizing supported platinum-silver catalysts, are characterized by high costs, swift catalyst degradation, and environmental concerns due to chromium usage. Numerous alternative catalysts, including those based on gallium (Ga), zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co), iron (Fe), vanadium (V), zirconium (Zr), and nanocarbons, have been studied. Gallium exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-5 displays exceptional stability and a high propylene yield (90%) during propane dehydrogenation. Indium (In) on the surface of chabazite zeolite can be reduced and subsequently interact with the Brnsted acid sites (BASs) of the zeolite via a reductive solid-state-ion exchange (RSSIE) process to create an In+-exchanged CHA catalyst. The nature of the active gallium species is subject to debate, with some studies suggesting single [GaH]2+ sites (Bell et al., 2022) and others proposing Ga+H+ pairs (Schreiber et al., 2021), a concept supported by laboratory findings.

          对丙烯的日益增长的需求以及来自页岩气的丙烷的低成本激发了对丙烷脱氢（PDH）的兴趣。传统的PDH工艺，如使用铬氧化物/铝氧催化剂的Catofin方法和使用支持型铂银催化剂的Oleflex过程，由于高昂的成本、催化剂快速失效以及铬可能引发的环境问题而受到质疑。各种替代催化剂，包括基于镓（Ga）、锌（Zn）、钴（Co）、铁（Fe）、钒（V）、锆（Zr）和纳米碳的催化剂，已经被探索。在H-ZSM-5沸石中交换的镓显示出在丙烷脱氢过程中的优异稳定性和90%的丙烯产率。在CHA沸石表面上的铟（In）可以通过还原过程与沸石的Brnsted酸位点（BASs）相互作用，并通过所谓的还原固态离子交换（RSSIE）过程形成掺杂有In+的CHA催化剂。关于活性镓物种的性质存在争议，一些研究认为单个 [GaH]2+位点是活性位点（Bell等人，2022），而另一些研究则提出Ga+H+对是稳定的活性位点（Schreiber等人，2021），这一概念得到了实验室结果的支持。
