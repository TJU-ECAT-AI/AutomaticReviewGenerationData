[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."
[2] "Many other catalysts for PDH have been investigated including Ga-, Zn-, Co-, Fe-, V-, Zr-based materials, and nanocarbon catalysts."
[3] "They showed that In2O3, initially present on the external surface of CHA, can be reduced and then reacts with the Brnsted acid sites (BASs) of the zeolite to form an indium-exchanged (In+) CHA catalyst through the so-called reductive solid-state-ion exchange (RSSIE) process."
[4] "Isolated [InH2]+ sites were put forward as the active center in these catalysts based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements."
[5] "However, the spectra used in support of the presence of [InH2]+ were collected at low temperature (below 153 K, after treating with H2 at 773 K), and therefore whether the indium hydride is stable at the reaction temperature (600 C) remains to be determined."
[6] "The identification of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was primarily based on ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations."
[7] "The examination of Si/Al ratios suggests that higher Si/Al ratios are beneficial to propane dehydrogenation."
[8] "At comparable conversion, the propane dehydrogenation reaction over In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In/SiO2, In/Al2O3 and bulk In2O3."
[9] "Understanding the support impact on indium speciation and the corresponding influence on catalytic performance is thus important to advance In-based catalyst understanding for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
