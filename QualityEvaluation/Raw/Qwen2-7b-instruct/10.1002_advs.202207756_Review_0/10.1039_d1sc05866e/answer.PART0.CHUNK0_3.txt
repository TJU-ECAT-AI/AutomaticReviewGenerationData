[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."
[2] "PDH technologies, i.e., the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr."
[3] "Many other catalysts for PDH have been investigated including Ga-,210 Zn-,11,12 Co-,1315 Fe-,1618 V-,1922 Zr-based materials,2325 and nanocarbon catalysts.26,27"
[4] "Metal cations (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, etc.) exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-52832 have shown promising alkane dehydrogenation properties as well: among them, Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation.31,32"
[5] "They showed that In2O3, initially present on the external surface of CHA, can be reduced and then reacts with the Brnsted acid sites (BASs) of the zeolite to form an indium-exchanged (In+) CHA catalyst through the so-called reductive solid-state-ion exchange (RSSIE) process."
[6] "This point has also been debated in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with respect to propane dehydrogenation. Bell and coworkers32 believe that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species; however, Schreiber et al.31 reported that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active sites, a model supported by results from our laboratory.36"

The growing demand for propylene and the low cost of propane from shale gas have sparked renewed interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional PDH processes, such as the Catofin process using chromium oxide/alumina catalysts and the Oleflex process using supported platinum-silver catalysts, suffer from high costs, rapid catalyst deactivation, and environmental concerns. Various alternative catalysts, including gallium, zinc, cobalt, iron, vanadium, zirconium-based materials, and nanocarbons, have been explored. Among these, gallium exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-5 demonstrates high stability and propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation. The reduction of gallium oxide (In2O3) on the external surface of chabazite zeolite (CHA) allows it to react with Brnsted acid sites (BASs) and form indium-exchanged (In+) CHA catalysts through a reductive solid-state-ion exchange (RSSIE) process. The nature of active gallium species has been debated, with some researchers suggesting single [GaH]2+ sites (Bell and coworkers, 2022) while others propose Ga+H+ pair sites (Schreiber et al., 2021).

丙烯需求的增长和从页岩气中获得的丙烷成本低廉，激发了对丙烷脱氢（PDH）的兴趣。传统的PDH工艺，如使用铬氧化物/铝氧催化剂的Catofin过程和使用支持型铂银催化剂的Oleflex过程，存在高成本、催化剂快速失效和环境影响的问题。各种替代催化剂，包括镓、锌、钴、铁、钒、锆基材料和纳米碳，已经被探索。其中，交换在H-ZSM-5沸石中的镓显示出了高稳定性和90%的丙烯选择性用于丙烷脱氢。镓氧化物（In2O3）在CHA沸石外部表面的还原允许其与Brnsted酸位点（BASs）反应并形成通过所谓的还原固态离子交换（RSSIE）过程形成的掺杂有In+的CHA催化剂。关于活性镓物种的性质存在争论，一些研究者认为单个[GaH]2+位点是活性位点（贝尔等人，2022），而其他研究者则提出Ga+H+对位点是稳定的活性位点，这一模型得到了实验室结果的支持（施赖伯等，2021）。
