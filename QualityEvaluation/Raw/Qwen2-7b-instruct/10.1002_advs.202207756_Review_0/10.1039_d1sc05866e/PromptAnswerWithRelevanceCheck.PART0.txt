[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."
[2] "Many other catalysts for PDH have been investigated including Ga-,210 Zn-,11,12 Co-,1315 Fe-,1618 V-,1922 Zr-based materials,2325 and nanocarbon catalysts."
[3] "Among them, Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "They have also shown that the CHA zeolite is superior to other zeolite frameworks for this reaction (BEA, MFI, and MOR) and that an Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates."
[5] "The identification of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was primarily based on ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations."
[6] "However, the spectra used in support of the presence of [InH2]+ were collected at low temperature (below 153 K, after treating with H2 at 773 K), and therefore whether the indium hydride is stable at the reaction temperature (600 C) remains to be determined."
[7] "This point has also been debated in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with respect to propane dehydrogenation."
[8] "Understanding the support impact on indium speciation and the corresponding influence on catalytic performance is thus important to advance In-based catalyst understanding for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."

The growing demand for propylene has spurred interest in PDH, leading to the investigation of various catalysts such as Ga-, Zn-, Co-, Fe-, V-, Zr-based materials, and nanocarbons. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit high stability and propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation. Research indicates that the CHA zeolite is superior for PDH compared to other frameworks like BEA, MFI, and MOR. An Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provides higher dehydrogenation rates. The active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation remains a subject of debate. The support's impact on indium speciation and its correlation with catalytic performance is crucial for advancing In-based catalyst understanding in alkane dehydrogenation.

1. The growing demand for propylene and the low cost of propane derived from shale gas have revived interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional PDH technologies face challenges due to high costs and rapid catalyst deactivation, as well as environmental concerns related to chromium usage.

2. Various alternative catalysts have been explored for PDH, including Ga-, Zn-, Co-, Fe-, V-, Zr-based materials, and nanocarbon catalysts. Ga/H-ZSM-5 stands out for its high stability and propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation.

3. Research indicates that indium (In) in the form of In2O3 on the surface of chabazite zeolite (CHA) can be reduced to form extra-framework In+ species, which then interacts with Brnsted acid sites (BASs) in the zeolite. This process forms an In+-exchanged CHA catalyst through a reductive solid-state-ion exchange (RSSIE).

4. Indium (In) in CHA zeolite has been identified as a potential active site for PDH, with isolated In+ sites playing a crucial role. FTIR spectroscopy and XAFS measurements support the existence of In+ species in these catalysts.

5. The nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH is a topic of debate. Bell et al. suggest single [GaH]2+ sites, while Schreiber et al. propose Ga+H+ pair sites, a model validated by experimental data.

6. The impact of support material on indium speciation and its effect on catalyst performance is critical for advancing the understanding of In-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation.

The growing demand for propylene and the low cost of propane from shale gas have sparked renewed interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional PDH processes, such as the Catofin process using chromium oxide/alumina catalysts and the Oleflex process using supported platinum-silver catalysts, suffer from high costs, rapid catalyst deactivation, and environmental concerns. Various alternative catalysts, including gallium, zinc, cobalt, iron, vanadium, zirconium-based materials, and nanocarbons, have been explored. Among these, gallium exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-5 demonstrates high stability and propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation. The reduction of gallium oxide (In2O3) on the external surface of chabazite zeolite (CHA) allows it to react with Brnsted acid sites (BASs) and form indium-exchanged (In+) CHA catalysts through a reductive solid-state-ion exchange (RSSIE) process. The nature of active gallium species has been debated, with some researchers suggesting single [GaH]2+ sites (Bell and coworkers, 2022) while others propose Ga+H+ pair sites (Schreiber et al., 2021).

Researchers have explored various catalysts for PDH, including Ga-, Zn-, Co-, Fe-, V-, Zr-based materials, and nanocarbon catalysts. Zeolite H-ZSM-5, when modified with Ga ions, has demonstrated high stability and propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation.

2. Indium (In) on zeolite chabazite (CHA) has been found to be a stable and selective catalyst for PDH. Initially, In2O3 is present on the surface of the CHA zeolite. Upon reduction in hydrogen gas, In2O3 is displaced from the Brnsted acid sites (BASs) of the zeolite, forming extra-framework In+ species. This process, known as reductive solid-state-ion exchange (RSSIE), creates an indium-exchanged (In+) CHA catalyst.

3. There is ongoing debate regarding the active species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. Bell and coworkers propose that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species. However, Schreiber et al. suggested that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active sites, a model supported by findings from their laboratory.
