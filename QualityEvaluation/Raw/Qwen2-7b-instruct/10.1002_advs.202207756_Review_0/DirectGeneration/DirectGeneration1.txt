The evolution of propylene production has seen significant shifts from traditional methods to more innovative techniques, notably the advent of propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH represents a pivotal advancement, enabling the direct conversion of propane into propylene through high-temperature catalytic processes. Central to this innovation is the utilization of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, which have sparked considerable interest due to their exceptional efficiency in propylene production. These catalysts, characterized by their molecular sieving properties, facilitate the selective dehydration of propane, enhancing yield and purity of the propylene product. However, the development of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts also engenders an ongoing scientific debate regarding their potential environmental impact, specifically concerning the handling and disposal of gallium, a scarce and expensive element. Researchers are actively exploring ways to mitigate these concerns while optimizing catalyst performance. Additionally, there is a concurrent push towards understanding the detailed reaction mechanisms within these catalysts, aiming to refine the process for greater efficiency and sustainability. This interdisciplinary research, combining aspects of catalysis, chemical engineering, and materials science, underscores the dynamic nature of propylene production technology as it continues to evolve to meet global energy demands and environmental standards.
