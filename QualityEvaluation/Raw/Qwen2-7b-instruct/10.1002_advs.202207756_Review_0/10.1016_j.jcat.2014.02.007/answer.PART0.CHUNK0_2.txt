[1] "The catalytic properties of framework iron-containing zeolites were investigated using the monomolecular propane reaction. It was shown that the reaction proceeds with very high dehydrogenation selectivity and occurs via isolate framework Fe sites. The measured TOFs per framework iron atom were the same for the samples with different Si/Fe ratios (15, 26, and 48)."
[2] "Because there is an 8090% decrease in reaction rates over the sodium-exchanged samples, it is concluded that framework Fe sites were the sites responsible for catalysis."
[3] "The steamed [Fe]ZSM-5 also showed lower reaction rates than those for H-[Fe]ZSM-5, indicating that the Fe sites isolated in the framework are the main channel for propane conversion on H-[Fe] zeolites."
[4] "Active sites in both framework and extra-framework positions showed very high dehydrogenation selectivity and low activation energies compared with those for H-[Al]ZSM-5."
[5] "These results indicate that a reaction mechanism different from proton donation from the acid site, that is, a redox reaction mechanism, could explain the observed properties of H-[Fe] zeolites."
[6] "The spontaneous formation of naphthalene radical cations upon adsorption on H-[Fe] zeolites at room temperature supports the notion that H-[Fe]-zeolites have redox properties that can lead to catalytic reactivity."

The development of new production methods for propylene, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), has been influenced by the growing demand for propylene. PDH is a critical process for the conversion of propane into propylene, a key component in the petrochemical industry. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was debate about the active Ga species involved in the catalytic process. Recent research has provided insights into the nature of these active sites, showing that they operate via a redox mechanism rather than a simple proton donation process. This redox mechanism is supported by the spontaneous formation of naphthalene radical cations upon adsorption on H-[Fe]-zeolites, indicating the presence of redox properties in these catalysts. This finding suggests that the active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts facilitate the PDH process through a redox reaction, offering a more detailed understanding of the catalytic activity and selectivity observed in these systems.

丙烯的日益增长的需求推动了新型生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）的发展。PDH 是将丙烷转化为丙烯的关键过程，在石化工业中至关重要。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经发生了显著变化。起初，关于催化过程中活性Ga物种的争论。最近的研究提供了这些活性位点的见解，显示它们通过氧化还原机制而非简单的质子捐赠过程起作用。这一氧化还原机制由吸附在H-[Fe]-沸石上的萘自由基阳离子的自发形成支持，表明这些催化剂具有氧化还原性质。这一发现表明，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的活性位点通过氧化还原反应促进PDH过程，为这些系统观察到的催化活性和选择性提供了更详细的理解。
