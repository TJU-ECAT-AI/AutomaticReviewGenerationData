The strength of acid sites can be measured using heats of adsorption of bases such as ammonia, pyridine, and acetonitrile. The heats of adsorption for ammonia and pyridine are similar for both H-[Fe] and H-[Al]ZSM-5 (145 kJ mol1 for ammonia and 195-200 kJ mol1 for pyridine), and the heat of adsorption of acetonitrile for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (95 kJ mol1) is slightly less than that for H-[Al]ZSM-5 (110 kJ mol1). These heats of adsorption suggest that the deprotonation enthalpy of the H-[Al] zeolites and H-[Fe] zeolites is similar and the strength of acid sites is also similar.

Conversion of small alkanes has been used frequently as a model reaction because the cleavage of CC and CH bonds in hydrocarbons is a problem of fundamental scientific interest. Product distributions tend to be simple and the results are easy to model and quantify. Alkane activation on acid sites in zeolites can proceed through bimolecular and monomolecular pathways. The bimolecular pathway involves hydride transfer between an alkane and an adsorbed carbenium ion when the concentration of surface species is high. On the contrary, the monomolecular pathway (protolytic mechanism), involving the formation of alkanium ions, is kinetically dominant at high temperatures (773 K), low alkane partial pressure, and low conversion (<2%).

In this contribution, we investigate the catalytic activity and selectivity for the monomolecular propane reaction over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 with different Si/Fe ratios (26 and 48) and over H-[Fe]beta zeolite (Si/Fe ratio, 15). The migration of Fe species from framework to extra-framework positions was monitored using UV/Vis spectroscopy and using the volume of the unit cell determined using XRD patterns. Conversion of propane resulted in a high selectivity to propene on H-[Fe] zeolites with lower activation energies when compared to H-[Al] zeolites. The results suggest that a redox mechanism is a plausible explanation for the hydrocarbon conversion on [Fe] zeolites reported here, as had been hypothesized earlier for Al-containing zeolites.

The catalytic reactions of propane were measured for the acid form of [Fe] zeolites with Si/Fe ratios of 15, 26, and 48 (H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (26), H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (48), H-[Fe]beta (15)) and an Arrhenius plot was used to compare the reaction rates over the various iron-silicate zeolites. The iron-silicate zeolites with higher iron concentration had higher reaction rates for propane dehydrogenation. H-[Fe]beta (15) had the highest reaction rates, and H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (48) had the lowest reaction rates. The measured activation energies were the same, within the experimental error, for all samples.

After conversion of propane, the H-[Fe]ZSM-5 sample was collected and exchanged with sodium to investigate the migration of Fe atoms during reaction. The Na-[Fe]ZSM-5* (after reaction) sample had higher reaction rates than Na-[Fe]ZSM-5 (before reaction), indicating that a portion of the Fe atoms in the framework migrated to extra-framework positions during the reaction.

The reaction mechanism depicted in Scheme 1 is suggested for the propane reaction over framework Fe sites in H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and H-[Fe]beta. An electron is extracted from the propane molecule at the framework Fe site when the propane contacts the sites, and a propane radical cation is formed. The propane radical cation is unstable and dissociates into the more stable propene radical cation and molecular hydrogen. Because Na-[Fe]ZSM-5 show lower reaction rates than H-[Fe]ZSM-5, electron capture is presumed to be related to the acid sites in H-[Fe]ZSM-5.

This reaction mechanism is similar to that introduced for a thermally dehydroxylated catalyst in a previous report.

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH has been studied extensively, with a focus on catalysts like Ga/H-ZSM-5. The understanding of these catalysts has evolved significantly, particularly concerning the nature of active Ga species. Early debates centered on the identity and role of active Ga species in PDH. Recent research has contributed to clarifying the mechanisms involved in PDH catalysis, highlighting the importance of the interaction between the Ga species and the zeolite framework. The literature suggests that active Ga species can be both extracrystaline and located within the zeolite framework. The active sites are often proposed to involve Ga species that are capable of participating in redox reactions, leading to the formation of radical cations, which can facilitate the dehydrogenation process. The role of these active sites in the PDH process is still a subject of ongoing research and debate, with new insights continually being developed to refine our understanding of the complex interactions between Ga species, the zeolite structure, and the PDH reaction mechanism.

对丙烯日益增长的需求推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH 已经受到广泛研究，重点是催化剂如Ga/H-ZSM-5。这些催化剂的理解已经显著进化，尤其是在PDH活性Ga物种的性质方面。早期的辩论集中在活性Ga物种的身份和作用上。最近的研究为澄清PDH催化机制做出了贡献，强调了Ga物种与沸石骨架相互作用的重要性。文献表明，活性Ga物种可以是晶态外的，也可以位于沸石骨架内。活性位点通常被提议涉及能够参与氧化还原反应的Ga物种，导致自由基的形成，这可以促进脱氢过程。活性位在PDH过程中仍是一个持续研究和辩论的主题，不断发展的新见解正在不断细化我们对Ga物种、沸石结构和PDH反应机制之间复杂相互作用的理解。
