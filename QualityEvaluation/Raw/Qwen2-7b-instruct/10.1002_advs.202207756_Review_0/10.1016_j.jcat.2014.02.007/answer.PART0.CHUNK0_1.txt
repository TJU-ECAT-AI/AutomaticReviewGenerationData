[1] "Isomorphously substituted iron-silicate zeolites were prepared and their catalytic properties for the monomolecular propane reaction were investigated."
[2] "The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenation-to-cracking ratio 0.36)."
[3] "The activation energy for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 is also lower than the activation energy for H-[Al]ZSM-5."
[4] "A redox catalytic cycle is suggested for the hydrocarbon reaction over isolated Fe framework sites in [Fe] zeolites via the formation of propane radical cations since a protolytic mechanism seems to be unable to explain the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity."

1. Iron-silicate zeolites were created and studied for their ability to convert propane monomolecularly. 
2. The iron zeolites showed much faster dehydrogenation rates compared to cracking rates, whereas aluminum zeolites with a similar silica to aluminum ratio did not exhibit such selective dehydrogenation.  
3. The iron zeolites had lower activation energies for dehydrogenation than aluminum zeolites. 
4. A redox catalytic process is proposed for the hydrocarbon reactions on isolated iron framework sites, involving propane radical cations, suggesting a different mechanism than simple proton donation.

1. 合成并研究了铁硅酸盐沸石的单分子丙烷反应催化性能。
2. 铁沸石的脱氢选择性远高于裂解，而具有相似硅铝比的铝沸石则没有表现出这种脱氢选择性。 
3. 铁沸石的脱氢活化能低于铝沸石。 
4. 提出了在铁框架位点上进行的红氧化学催化循环，通过形成丙烷自由基阳离子来解释观察到的活化能和选择性差异，暗示了不同于简单质子捐赠的机制。
