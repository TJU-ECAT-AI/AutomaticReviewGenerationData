Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over iron-silicate zeolites Jang Ho Yun, Raul F. Lobo
Isomorphously substituted iron-silicate zeolites were prepared and their catalytic properties for the monomolecular propane reaction were investigated.
Unit cell volumes, determined using XRD, were used to monitor the presence of Fe in the framework and the migration of Fe species from framework to extra-framework positions.
Migration of Fe species from framework to extra-framework positions can occur during the monomolecular propane reaction as well.
The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenation-to-cracking ratio 0.36).
A redox catalytic cycle is suggested for the hydrocarbon reaction over isolated Fe framework sites in [Fe] zeolites via the formation of propane radical cations since a protolytic mechanism seems to be unable to explain the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity.

The study investigated the catalytic properties of iron-silicate zeolites for the dehydrogenation of propane, revealing that these materials exhibit significantly higher dehydrogenation rates compared to cracking rates. They showed much higher selectivity for dehydrogenation over the similar aluminum-silicate zeolite H-[Al]ZSM-5, suggesting that a redox mechanism might be at play rather than a protolytic mechanism. This is because the redox mechanism can better explain the differences in activation energy and selectivity observed in the iron-silicate zeolites.

[1] "The catalytic properties of framework iron-containing zeolites were investigated using the monomolecular propane reaction. It was shown that the reaction proceeds with very high dehydrogenation selectivity and occurs via isolate framework Fe sites. The measured TOFs per framework iron atom were the same for the samples with different Si/Fe ratios (15, 26, and 48)."
[2] "Because there is an 8090% decrease in reaction rates over the sodium-exchanged samples, it is concluded that framework Fe sites were the sites responsible for catalysis."
[3] "The steamed [Fe]ZSM-5 also showed lower reaction rates than those for H-[Fe]ZSM-5, indicating that the Fe sites isolated in the framework are the main channel for propane conversion on H-[Fe] zeolites."
[4] "Active sites in both framework and extra-framework positions showed very high dehydrogenation selectivity and low activation energies compared with those for H-[Al]ZSM-5."
[5] "These results indicate that a reaction mechanism different from proton donation from the acid site, that is, a redox reaction mechanism, could explain the observed properties of H-[Fe] zeolites."
[6] "The spontaneous formation of naphthalene radical cations upon adsorption on H-[Fe] zeolites at room temperature supports the notion that H-[Fe]-zeolites have redox properties that can lead to catalytic reactivity."

The development of new production methods for propylene, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), has been influenced by the growing demand for propylene. PDH is a critical process for the conversion of propane into propylene, a key component in the petrochemical industry. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, there was debate about the active Ga species involved in the catalytic process. Recent research has provided insights into the nature of these active sites, showing that they operate via a redox mechanism rather than a simple proton donation process. This redox mechanism is supported by the spontaneous formation of naphthalene radical cations upon adsorption on H-[Fe]-zeolites, indicating the presence of redox properties in these catalysts. This finding suggests that the active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts facilitate the PDH process through a redox reaction, offering a more detailed understanding of the catalytic activity and selectivity observed in these systems.

The strength of acid sites can be measured using heats of adsorption of bases such as ammonia, pyridine, and acetonitrile. The heats of adsorption for ammonia and pyridine are similar for both H-[Fe] and H-[Al]ZSM-5 (145 kJ mol1 for ammonia and 195-200 kJ mol1 for pyridine), and the heat of adsorption of acetonitrile for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (95 kJ mol1) is slightly less than that for H-[Al]ZSM-5 (110 kJ mol1). These heats of adsorption suggest that the deprotonation enthalpy of the H-[Al] zeolites and H-[Fe] zeolites is similar and the strength of acid sites is also similar.

Conversion of small alkanes has been used frequently as a model reaction because the cleavage of CC and CH bonds in hydrocarbons is a problem of fundamental scientific interest. Product distributions tend to be simple and the results are easy to model and quantify. Alkane activation on acid sites in zeolites can proceed through bimolecular and monomolecular pathways. The bimolecular pathway involves hydride transfer between an alkane and an adsorbed carbenium ion when the concentration of surface species is high. On the contrary, the monomolecular pathway (protolytic mechanism), involving the formation of alkanium ions, is kinetically dominant at high temperatures (773 K), low alkane partial pressure, and low conversion (<2%).

In this contribution, we investigate the catalytic activity and selectivity for the monomolecular propane reaction over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 with different Si/Fe ratios (26 and 48) and over H-[Fe]beta zeolite (Si/Fe ratio, 15). The migration of Fe species from framework to extra-framework positions was monitored using UV/Vis spectroscopy and using the volume of the unit cell determined using XRD patterns. Conversion of propane resulted in a high selectivity to propene on H-[Fe] zeolites with lower activation energies when compared to H-[Al] zeolites. The results suggest that a redox mechanism is a plausible explanation for the hydrocarbon conversion on [Fe] zeolites reported here, as had been hypothesized earlier for Al-containing zeolites.

The catalytic reactions of propane were measured for the acid form of [Fe] zeolites with Si/Fe ratios of 15, 26, and 48 (H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (26), H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (48), H-[Fe]beta (15)) and an Arrhenius plot was used to compare the reaction rates over the various iron-silicate zeolites. The iron-silicate zeolites with higher iron concentration had higher reaction rates for propane dehydrogenation. H-[Fe]beta (15) had the highest reaction rates, and H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (48) had the lowest reaction rates. The measured activation energies were the same, within the experimental error, for all samples.

After conversion of propane, the H-[Fe]ZSM-5 sample was collected and exchanged with sodium to investigate the migration of Fe atoms during reaction. The Na-[Fe]ZSM-5* (after reaction) sample had higher reaction rates than Na-[Fe]ZSM-5 (before reaction), indicating that a portion of the Fe atoms in the framework migrated to extra-framework positions during the reaction.

The reaction mechanism depicted in Scheme 1 is suggested for the propane reaction over framework Fe sites in H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and H-[Fe]beta. An electron is extracted from the propane molecule at the framework Fe site when the propane contacts the sites, and a propane radical cation is formed. The propane radical cation is unstable and dissociates into the more stable propene radical cation and molecular hydrogen. Because Na-[Fe]ZSM-5 show lower reaction rates than H-[Fe]ZSM-5, electron capture is presumed to be related to the acid sites in H-[Fe]ZSM-5.

This reaction mechanism is similar to that introduced for a thermally dehydroxylated catalyst in a previous report.

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH has been studied extensively, with a focus on catalysts like Ga/H-ZSM-5. The understanding of these catalysts has evolved significantly, particularly concerning the nature of active Ga species. Early debates centered on the identity and role of active Ga species in PDH. Recent research has contributed to clarifying the mechanisms involved in PDH catalysis, highlighting the importance of the interaction between the Ga species and the zeolite framework. The literature suggests that active Ga species can be both extracrystaline and located within the zeolite framework. The active sites are often proposed to involve Ga species that are capable of participating in redox reactions, leading to the formation of radical cations, which can facilitate the dehydrogenation process. The role of these active sites in the PDH process is still a subject of ongoing research and debate, with new insights continually being developed to refine our understanding of the complex interactions between Ga species, the zeolite structure, and the PDH reaction mechanism.
