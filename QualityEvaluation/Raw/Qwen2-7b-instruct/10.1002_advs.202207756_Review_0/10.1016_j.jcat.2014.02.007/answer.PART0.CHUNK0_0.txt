Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over iron-silicate zeolites Jang Ho Yun, Raul F. Lobo
Isomorphously substituted iron-silicate zeolites were prepared and their catalytic properties for the monomolecular propane reaction were investigated.
Unit cell volumes, determined using XRD, were used to monitor the presence of Fe in the framework and the migration of Fe species from framework to extra-framework positions.
Migration of Fe species from framework to extra-framework positions can occur during the monomolecular propane reaction as well.
The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenation-to-cracking ratio 0.36).
A redox catalytic cycle is suggested for the hydrocarbon reaction over isolated Fe framework sites in [Fe] zeolites via the formation of propane radical cations since a protolytic mechanism seems to be unable to explain the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity.

The study investigated the catalytic properties of iron-silicate zeolites for the dehydrogenation of propane, revealing that these materials exhibit significantly higher dehydrogenation rates compared to cracking rates. They showed much higher selectivity for dehydrogenation over the similar aluminum-silicate zeolite H-[Al]ZSM-5, suggesting that a redox mechanism might be at play rather than a protolytic mechanism. This is because the redox mechanism can better explain the differences in activation energy and selectivity observed in the iron-silicate zeolites.

研究调查了铁硅酸盐沸石对于丙烷脱氢的催化性能，发现这些材料在脱氢速率上远高于裂解速率。与具有相似Si/Al比的铝硅酸盐沸石H-[Al]ZSM-5相比，它们对脱氢的专属性要高得多，暗示可能正在发生氧化还原机制而非质子转移机制。这是因为氧化还原机制可以更好地解释在铁硅酸盐沸石中观察到的活化能和选择性差异。
