INTRODUCTION
Exchanged Zn cations increase propane conversion turnover rates, hydrogen formation rates, and selectivity to aromatics on H-ZSM5.

EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
2.1. Catalyst Preparation
Na+ ions in Na-ZSM5 were replaced with NH4+ by contacting the Na-ZSM5 with a solution of 0.67 M NH4NO3 at 353 K for 10 h.

2.2. Elemental Analysis
The elemental composition of all samples was obtained by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The Zn contents of the ion-exchanged samples were 0.62, 1.07, and 1.30 wt%, which correspond to Zn/Al atomic ratios of 0.10, 0.16, and 0.19 respectively.

2.3. In Situ Zinc K-Edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
X-ray absorption measurements were conducted using an in situ cell similar to that described by Clausen et al. The cell consists of a quartz capillary (0.9-mm diameter, 0.1-mm wall thickness, 10-cm length) mounted horizontally into a stainless-steel base using compression fittings with graphite ferrules.

2.4. Temperature-Programmed Reduction
Temperature-programmed reduction experiments were carried out using a Quantasorb unit modified with a programmable furnace.

2.5. Measurement of Ammonia Irreversibly Adsorbed at 383 K
Ammonia titration experiments were carried out using a temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) unit consisting of a gas manifold unit connected to a quartz capillary cell followed by an online mass spectrometer.

2.6. Isotopic Titration of Brnsted Acid Sites with Deuterium
Isotopic titration experiments were also carried out using the TPSR unit.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Effect of Zn Metal Cations on Propane Conversion Rate and Selectivity
Propane conversion turnover rates are greater on Zn/H-ZSM5 than on H-ZSM5. When Zn cations are introduced into H-ZSM5 channels, dehydrogenated products are produced with higher selectivity and the rate of formation of aromatics increases markedly.

3.2. X-ray Absorption Zn K-Edge Near-Edge Spectra
Near-edge X-ray absorption spectra at the Zn K-edge for fresh Zn/H-ZSM5 at room temperature show a sharp increase in absorbance caused by the excitation of Zn 1s electrons. The edge energy depends on the oxidation state of the absorber atom.

3.3. X-ray Absorption Extended Fine Structure (EXAFS)
EXAFS measurements at the Zn K-edge were analyzed using ZnO and Zn foil as standards to detect the presence of ZnO, ZnOZn, and ZnZn species.

3.4. Temperature-Programmed Reduction
Bulk oxide crystallites, when present, can also be detected by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR).

3.5. Transformation of Zn into Active Zn Species during High-Temperature Treatment
Structural zeolitic studies of several M2+ cations (i.e., Cu, Mg) prepared by ion exchange from aqueous solution suggest that cationic species are initially present in zeolites as (M2+OH)+.

3.6. Titration of Brnsted and Lewis Acid Sites with Ammonia
The density of Brnsted acid sites on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 sample was measured by temperature-programmed desorption of preadsorbed ammonia.

3.7. Isotopic Titration of Brnsted Acid Sites with Deuterium
Because ammonia titrants interact with both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites in Zn/H-ZSM5, the isotopic exchange of D2 with surface hydrogens was used to measure the number of protons remaining after Zn exchange.

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH utilizes catalysts like Ga/H-ZSM-5 to convert propane into propylene efficiently. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species. Recent research has provided insights into the structure and location of active Ga species within the catalyst, contributing to our current knowledge of these catalysts.

1. The development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), has been influenced by the growing demand for propylene. This has led to advancements in understanding and utilizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, including debates and research findings about the active Ga species.

2. The structure and location of Zn cations in Zn/H-ZSM5 were not thoroughly explored until recently. The studies revealed that Zn is present as isolated ZnOx species, mostly at zeolitic exchange sites, with approximately four oxygen nearest neighbors and without Zn next nearest neighbors.

3. Zn cations in Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts do not reduce to zero-valent species at temperatures up to 1173 K. This indicates they remain as Zn2+ cations.

4. Samples prepared by impregnation techniques tend to form extracrystalline ZnO, which is ineffective as a catalyst for propane conversion. This contrasts with Zn cations in ion-exchanged samples.

5. The most probable species from nitrate solution for Zn is (ZnOH)+, but this Zn species is not thermally stable. Upon heating, it undergoes dehydration, forming H2O and Zn2+ cations.

2. Zn/H-ZSM5中Zn离子的结构和位置直到最近才得到深入研究。研究显示，Zn以孤立的ZnOx物种的形式存在，最有可能位于沸石交换位点，与约四个氧邻近原子相邻，并且没有Zn下一个最邻近原子。

3. Zn离子在Zn/H-ZSM5催化剂中不会在超过1173 K的温度下还原为零价物种。这表明它们保持为Zn2+离子。

4. 通过浸渍技术制备的样品倾向于形成非晶态ZnO，这作为丙烷转化的催化剂效果不佳。这与离子交换样品中的Zn离子形成对比。

5. 硝酸盐溶液中最可能的Zn物种是(ZnOH)+，但这种Zn物种在热力学上不稳定。加热时，它会脱水，形成H2O和Zn2+离子。

1. INTRODUCTION
H-ZSM5 catalyzes the conversion of light alkanes to aro- matics with low selectivity because of cracking side reac- tions (17). The introduction of Zn species into H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions (817).
