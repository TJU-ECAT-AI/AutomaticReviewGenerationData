1. INTRODUCTION
H-ZSM5 catalyzes the conversion of light alkanes to aro- matics with low selectivity because of cracking side reac- tions (17). The introduction of Zn species into H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions (817).

Many groups have examined the catalytic role of these Zn species during light alkane aromatization; the struc- ture and location of these Zn cations in Zn/H-ZSM5, how- ever, were not explored until recently. Structural studies of Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM5 have led to conflicting reports.

This passage discusses the use of Zn species in H-ZSM5 catalysts for improving the conversion of light alkanes into aromatics. The structure and location of Zn cations within Zn/H-ZSM5 have been a subject of investigation due to conflicting reports from various studies. Yakerson et al. (18) suggested that one Zn2+ cation replaces two protons and interacts with two aluminum sites (OZnO). In contrast, Berndt et al. (16) demonstrated that CO reacts on Zn/H-ZSM5 to produce equal amounts of CO2 and H2, indicating the presence of (ZnOH)+.

本文讨论了在H-ZSM5催化剂中使用Zn物种以提高轻烷烃转化为芳烃的转化率。Zn离子在Zn/H-ZSM5中的结构和位置是研究的重点，因为有报告存在争议。Yakerson等人（18）认为一个Zn2+离子替换两个质子并与两个铝原子（OZnO）相互作用。相反，Berndt等人（16）表明CO在Zn/H-ZSM5上反应产生等摩尔的CO2和H2，这表明存在(ZnOH)+。
