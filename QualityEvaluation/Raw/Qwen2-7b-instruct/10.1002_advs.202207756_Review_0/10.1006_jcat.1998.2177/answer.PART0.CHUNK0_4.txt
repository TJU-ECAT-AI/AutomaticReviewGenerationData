[1] "Exchanged Zn cations increase propane conversion turnover rates, hydrogen formation rates, and selectivity to aromatics on H-ZSM5."
[2] "These metal cations increase propane conversion rates and the selectivity to unsaturated products by increasing the rate of propane and propene dehydrogenation and by avoiding the preferential removal of hydrogen by transfer to hydrocarbon fragments to form light alkanes."
[3] "In contrast, Berndt et al. (16) showed that CO reacts on Zn/H-ZSM5 (<2 wt% Zn, Si/Al = 23) to produce equimolar amounts of CO2 and H2,suggesting that (ZnOH)+ is present."
[4] "This study addresses the synthesis of Zn cation-exchanged H-ZSM5 zeolite and the detailed characterization of the structure and location of the Zn species."
[5] "The nature of Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM5 was examined by combining site titration and kinetic and isotopic methods with in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Zn K-edge."
[6] "The presence of Zn species leads to an increase in the rate of H2 formation. The hydrogen (H2) selectivity increases with increasing Zn content (Fig. 3)."
[7] "Propane dehydrogenation reactions proceed via elementary steps that involve CH bond activation and disposal of hydrogen atoms formed in these reactions."
[8] "The presence of ex- changed Zn cations increases the rate of these hydrogen re- moval steps by introducing portholes for recombinative desorption of H atoms as H2."
[9] "In situ Zn K-edge X-ray absorption studies have shown that Zn in Zn/H-ZSM5 (Si/Al = 14.5, ion exchange) is present as isolated ZnOx species, most likely located at ze- olitic exchange sites, with about four oxygen nearest neigh- bors and without Zn next nearest neighbors."
[10] "Temperature-programmed reduction studies indicate that reduction of bulk ZnO begins at 800 K, but Zn cations in Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts do not reduce at temperatures exceeding 1173 K."
[11] "Extracrystalline ZnO forms on samples prepared by im- pregnation techniques. These bulk ZnO crystals appear to be ineffective as catalysts for propane conversion."
[12] "By analogy with other divalent metal cations, the most probable species from nitrate solution is (ZnOH)+, but this Zn species is not thermally stable."
[13] "Ammonia adsorption measurements indicate that the in- troduction of Zn species into ZSM5 channels leads to a decrease in the amount of NH3 adsorbed per Al site and is consistent with one Zn2+ cation replacing two protons and interacting with two Al sites."
[14] "The isotopic titration of Brnsted acid sites with D2 confirms these ammonia ad- sorption measurements."
[15] "Calculations based on the Zn load- ing from elemental analysis suggest that the number of hydrogen atoms desorbed is in agreement with the theoret- ical value expected for Zn2+ interacting with two Al sites (OZn2+O)."

1. The demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH), aiming to increase the rate of propane conversion and the selectivity to aromatics. Zn cations enhance the PDH process by boosting propane and propene dehydrogenation rates and preventing hydrogen loss to hydrocarbon fragments, thus forming lighter alkanes.
2. Berndt et al.'s work suggests that CO reacts on Zn/H-ZSM5 to produce CO2 and H2, implying the presence of (ZnOH)+ species. This finding contributes to understanding the active Zn species involved in PDH reactions.
3. This study focuses on synthesizing Zn cation-exchanged H-ZSM5 zeolite and characterizing its structure and location of Zn species using various analytical techniques.
4. The Zn cations increase H2 formation rates and hydrogen selectivity, which are crucial for PDH efficiency.
5. Propane dehydrogenation involves CH bond activation and hydrogen atom removal, with Zn cations facilitating these steps.
6. The introduction of Zn cations enhances the rate of hydrogen removal, providing portholes for hydrogen recombinative desorption as H2.
7. X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM5 exist as isolated ZnOx, most likely situated within zeolite channels.
8. Zn cations prevent reduction to zero valency, maintaining their stability at 773 K during PDH reactions.
9. Impregnation techniques result in the formation of extracrystalline ZnO, which is less effective as a PDH catalyst compared to ion-exchanged samples.
10. The most probable Zn species from nitrate solution is (ZnOH)+, but it is unstable upon heating.
11. Ammonia adsorption measurements confirm that Zn species replace protons and interact with two Al sites, supporting the theoretical model of Zn2+ interaction.
12. The isotopic titration of Brnsted acid sites with D2 validates the ammonia adsorption findings, reinforcing the presence of Zn2+ species.
13. Calculations based on Zn loading from elemental analysis align with the expected number of hydrogen atoms desorbed by Zn2+ interacting with two Al sites (OZn2+O).
