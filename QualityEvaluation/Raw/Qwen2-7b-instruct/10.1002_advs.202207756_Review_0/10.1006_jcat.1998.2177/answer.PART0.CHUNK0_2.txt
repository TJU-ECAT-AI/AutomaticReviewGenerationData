[1] "Many groups have examined the catalytic role of these Zn species during light alkane aromatization; the structure and location of these Zn cations in Zn/H-ZSM5, however, were not explored until recently."
[2] "These metal cations increase propane conversion rates and the selectivity to unsaturated products by increasing the rate of propane and propene dehydrogenation and by avoiding the preferential removal of hydrogen by transfer to hydrocarbon fragments to form light alkanes."
[3] "In contrast, Berndt et al. (16) showed that CO reacts on Zn/H-ZSM5 (<2 wt% Zn, Si/Al = 23) to produce equimolar amounts of CO2 and H2,suggesting that (ZnOH)+ is present."
[4] "This study addresses the synthesis of Zn cation-exchanged H-ZSM5 zeolite and the detailed characterization of the structure and location of the Zn species."
[5] "The nature of Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM5 was examined by combining site titration and kinetic and isotopic methods with in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Zn K-edge."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH). One such method involves the use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The understanding of these catalysts has evolved significantly, including debates about the active Ga species involved. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by elucidating the structure and location of the active Ga species within the H-ZSM-5 zeolite. The research combined site titration, kinetic, and isotopic methods with in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Ga K-edge to characterize the structure and location of the Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5. This has helped clarify the catalytic role of Ga during light alkane aromatization and provided insights into the nature of the active Ga species.
