          [1] "Many groups have examined the catalytic role of these Zn species during light alkane aromatization; the struc- ture and location of these Zn cations in Zn/H-ZSM5, however, were not explored until recently."
          [2] "These metal cations increase propane conversion rates and the selectivity to unsaturated products by increasing the rate of propane and propene dehydrogenation and by avoiding the preferential removal of hydrogen by transfer to hydrocarbon fragments to form light alkanes."
          [3] "In contrast, Berndt et al. (16) showed that CO reacts on Zn/H-ZSM5 (<2 wt% Zn, Si/Al = 23) to produce equimolar amounts of CO2 and H2,suggesting that (ZnOH)+ is present."
          [4] "This study addresses the synthesis of Zn cation-exchanged H-ZSM5 zeolite and the detailed characterization of the structure and location of the Zn species."
          [5] "The nature of Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM5 was examined by combining site titration and kinetic and isotopic methods with in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Zn K-edge."

          The growing demand for propylene has led to advancements in the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with a focus on understanding and utilizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The structure and location of Ga species within these catalysts have been a subject of recent investigation, contributing to a deeper understanding of their catalytic role during light alkane aromatization. This includes the exploration of Ga/H-ZSM-5's ability to increase propane conversion rates, improve selectivity towards unsaturated products, and avoid preferential hydrogen removal to form light alkanes. Studies have also delved into the synthesis of Ga cation-exchanged H-ZSM5 zeolite, detailing the structure and location of Ga species through various analytical techniques. Additionally, the nature of Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM5 has been examined using a combination of site titration, kinetic, and isotopic methods along with in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Ga K-edge, providing insights into their catalytic behavior.

          The introduction of Zn cations into the H-ZSM5 catalyst enhances its performance in PDH processes by increasing the rate of propane conversion and propene dehydrogenation, thus leading to higher selectivity for unsaturated products. This improvement is achieved by avoiding the preferential removal of hydrogen atoms during the formation of light alkanes. The enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the increased rate of hydrogen removal, facilitated by the presence of Zn cations, which create pathways for recombinative desorption of hydrogen atoms as H2. As a result, the hydrogen selectivity improves with increasing Zn content, making the catalyst more efficient in PDH reactions.

          将锌离子引入H-ZSM5催化剂中可以提高其在PDH过程中的性能，通过增加丙烷转化率和丙烯脱氢速率，从而提高不饱和产品的选择性。这种改进是通过避免形成轻烷烃时优先移除氢原子实现的。增强的催化活性归因于氢移除速率的增加，这是由锌离子的存在所促进的，为氢原子重组脱出提供通道作为H2。因此，随着锌含量的增加，氢选择性提高，使催化剂在PDH反应中更有效。
