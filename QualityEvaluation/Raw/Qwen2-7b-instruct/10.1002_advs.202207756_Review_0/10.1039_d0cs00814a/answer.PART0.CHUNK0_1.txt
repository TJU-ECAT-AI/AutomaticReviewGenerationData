How has the growing demand for propylene influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), and how has the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH evolved, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species and recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts?

[1] "With the rapid consumption of fossil energy, traditional propylene production methods can no longer meet the increasing demands."
[2] "Comparatively, some metal oxides in regions C and D such as InOx-based catalysts show relatively lower activity."
[3] "Importantly, GaOx-based catalysts, in region A, show preferable formation rates at lower deactivation rates, and might be promising alternative PDH catalysts."
[4] "Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+."
[5] "By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned."
[6] "As for the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, when the reduction degree of ZrO2 increases, propylene can adsorb onto Rh strongly, leading to the blockage of the hydrogen recombination site."
[7] "However, most of them concentrate on oxidative dehydrogenation. However, a low olefin selectivity is the major issue due to the overoxida- tion to COx."
[8] "In short, CrOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and selectivity, but low stability, with about 1 mol gCr 1 h1 or 1 mol gcat 1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.5 h1."
[9] "The high activity of b-Ga2O3 is due to its monoclinic structure, where Ga3+ ions are evenly distributed on the octahedron and tetrahedron,which can provide a large number of weak acid sites."
[10] "Additionally, H2 pretreatment leads to an increase of Zrcus sites, which accordingly increases the PDH performance."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product. This makes it one of the most promising propylene production methods. In the case of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the active Ga species have been a subject of ongoing debate. Recent research findings suggest that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. Altering the particle size and crystalline phase can significantly tune the concentration of Zrcus cations, enhancing the catalyst's performance. However, as the reduction degree of ZrO2 increases in Rh/ZrO2 catalysts, propylene can adsorb onto Rh strongly, leading to the blockage of the hydrogen recombination site, which hinders the promoting effect of the metal. The high activity of b-Ga2O3 is attributed to its monoclinic structure, which provides a large number of weak acid sites. H2 pretreatment increases the Zrcus sites, thereby enhancing the PDH performance.

需求的增长推动了丙烯生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为一种仅产生丙烯的专有方法。这使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法之一。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂，活性Ga物种一直存在争议。最近的研究发现表明，Ga2O3的活性位点是提供由配位不饱和Ga3+提供的Lewis酸位点。通过改变颗粒大小和晶体结构可以显著调整Zrcus离子的浓度，从而提高催化剂性能。然而，在Rh/ZrO2催化剂中，随着ZrO2的还原程度增加，丙烯会强烈吸附到Rh上，导致氢重组位点堵塞，从而阻碍金属的促进效果。b-Ga2O3的高活性归因于其单斜晶系结构，该结构提供了大量的弱酸位点。H2预处理可增加Zrcus位点，从而增强PDH性能。
