1. The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The Catofin/HGM concept was demonstrated on a commercial scale in industrial Catofin installations in 2012. 

2. Ni/SiO2 catalysts showed high reactivity but suffered from significant deactivation over time due to coke formation and accumulation during propane dehydrogenation. 

3. VOx-based catalysts had higher olefin selectivity than CrOx-based catalysts, indicating better stability during continuous regeneration cycles. 

4. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts were found to be active for PDH, with a stable performance over time. The ongoing debate revolves around identifying the specific active Ga species responsible for this catalytic behavior.

5. Ga2O3 catalysts were found to be active due to the Lewis acid sites provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ ions. 

6. Doping techniques were used to enhance GaOx-based catalysts' activity by increasing the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. 

7. Over-reduction of ZrO2 led to the blockage of hydrogen recombination sites, hindering the promoting effect of Rh on PDH reactions. 

8. Similar to Rh/ZrO2 catalysts, the blockage of hydrogen recombination sites occurred in catalysts with increased reduction levels of ZrO2.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，新的生产方法得到了发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。在2012年，工业卡托芬/热管理概念在卡托芬安装上进行了商业规模的演示。 

2. Ni/SiO2催化剂显示出高反应性，但由于丙烷沉积和积累导致严重的催化剂失活，在丙烷脱氢过程中。 

3. VOx基催化剂比CrOx基催化剂具有更高的烯烃选择性，表明其在连续再生周期中的稳定性更好。 

4. Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂被发现对PDH活性，随着时间的推移表现出稳定的性能。围绕特定活性Ga物种的辩论持续进行。 

5. Ga2O3催化剂由于提供 coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+离子的Lewis酸位点而被发现是活跃的。 

6. 通过掺杂技术增强了GaOx基催化剂的活性，通过增加coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+位点的数量。 

7. 当ZrO2的还原程度增加时，氢再组合位点被阻塞，阻碍了Rh对PDH反应的促进效果。 

8. 相似于Rh/ZrO2催化剂，随着ZrO2还原程度的增加，氢再组合位点在催化剂中被阻塞。
