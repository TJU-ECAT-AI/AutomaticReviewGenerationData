How has the growing demand for propylene influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), and how has the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH evolved, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species and recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts?

[1] "The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, including the use of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to convert propane to propylene. This process requires catalysts that can efficiently and selectively convert propane into propylene, minimizing side reactions."

[2] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH have evolved with ongoing debates about the active Ga species. Research has shown that the [GaH]2+ ion on a framework anionic site is the authentic structure of the active site. This ion functions as a catalytically active site for selective dehydrogenation."

1. The increasing demand for propylene has accelerated the development of new production methods, notably propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH relies on catalysts capable of converting propane into propylene efficiently and selectively, reducing unwanted side reactions.

2. The use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has seen advancements with discussions centered on the active Ga species. Studies have confirmed that the [GaH]2+ ion on a framework anionic site constitutes the true active site. This ion acts as a selective dehydrogenation catalyst.

1. 随着丙烯需求的增长，已经推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是通过丙烷脱氢（PDH）将丙烷转化为丙烯。该过程需要能够高效且选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯的催化剂，以减少副反应。

2. Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH经历了发展，并围绕活性Ga物种展开了讨论。研究发现，在框架阴离子位点上的[GaH]2+离子是真正的活性位点结构。这个离子作为选择性脱氢的催化剂起作用。
