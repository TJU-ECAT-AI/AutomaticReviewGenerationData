How has the growing demand for propylene influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), and how has the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH evolved, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species and recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts?

Active sites. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of propane dehydrogenation behavior on metal oxide-based catalysts, identifying the exact nature of Lewis acid MO sites on which the adsorption of paraffin molecules takes place is quite necessary.

For CrOx-based catalysts, as discussed above, unsaturated and/or clustered Cr3+ sites are usually considered to be the active sites.

Over GaOx and ZrO2-based catalysts, there seem to be different dehydrogenation active sites.

Over GaOx-based catalysts, the activity for PDH is strongly dependent on the structure of Ga species.

Over ZrO2-based catalysts, coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ cations (Zrcus) are the active sites exhibiting PDH activity and selectivity.

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), aiming to efficiently convert propane into propylene. Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, particularly concerning the debate about the active Ga species. The catalysts involve Ga species like Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and polymorphs of gallium oxides, which play crucial roles in PDH reactions. Research findings have contributed to identifying the specific active sites on GaOx and ZrO2-based catalysts. This understanding helps in optimizing the performance of these catalysts for PDH processes, aiming to achieve higher propylene selectivity and stability under reaction conditions.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），旨在高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用，我们对活性Ga物种的争论有了更深入的理解。催化剂涉及Ga物种如Ga3+、[GaH2]+、[GaH]2+和镓氧化物的多晶形体，在PDH反应中起着关键作用。研究发现为识别GaOx和ZrO2基催化剂上的特定活性位点提供了帮助，这有助于优化这些催化剂在PDH过程中的性能，以实现更高的丙烯选择性和稳定性。
