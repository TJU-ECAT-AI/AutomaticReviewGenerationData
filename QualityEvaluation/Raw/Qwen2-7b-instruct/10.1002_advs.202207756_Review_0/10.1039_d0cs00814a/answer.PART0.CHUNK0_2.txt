[1] "The Dow Chemical Company announced in October 2016 that it developed a fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation (FCDh) technology to produce pro- pylene from shale gas feedstock."
[2] "Over the course of a catalytic cycle, due to the coke deposition, frequent regeneration operations are needed. Although the catalysts recover most of their activity after each reaction-regeneration cycle, the loss of activity due to regeneration sintering is not entirely reversible."
[3] "Evgenii V. Kondratenko and coworkers found that regardless of supports for VOx-based catalysts, the coke deposition on VOx is more severe than that over the acid sites on supports."

1. In October 2016, Dow Chemical Company introduced a fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation technology for producing propylene from shale gas feedstock.
2. In PDH reactions, coke deposition is a major cause of catalyst deactivation. After each reaction-regeneration cycle, catalyst activity mostly recovers, but the degradation due to sintering during regeneration isn't completely reversible.
3. Research by Evgenii V. Kondratenko and colleagues revealed that, irrespective of the support used, vanadium oxide-based catalysts experience more severe coke deposition compared to the acid sites on other supports.

1. 在2016年10月，道化学公司宣布开发了一种流化催化脱氢技术，用于从页岩气原料中生产丙烯。
2. 在PDH反应中，焦炭沉积是催化剂失活的主要原因。在每次反应-再生周期后，催化剂活性大多会恢复，但再生过程中的结块导致的活性损失并不能完全逆转。
3. Evgenii V. Kondratenko和同事的研究发现，无论使用何种载体，钒氧化物基催化剂的焦炭沉积都比其他支持上的酸性位点更为严重。
