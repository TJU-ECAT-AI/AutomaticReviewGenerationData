[1] "The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), to enhance propylene yields and efficiency."
[2] "Recent research on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has revealed that the debate about active Ga species is ongoing. There are various Ga species on the surface, including Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and polymorphs of gallium oxides."
[3] "The active sites of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH are still under investigation. The [GaH]2+ ion on a framework anionic site is suggested to function as a catalytically active site for selective dehydrogenation."
