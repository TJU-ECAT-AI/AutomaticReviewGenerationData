The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH offers a more efficient and specialized route to produce propylene compared to traditional methods. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through recent research. Studies have debated the active Ga species, with one key finding being the role of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites in the monoclinic structure of Ga2O3. These sites provide a large number of weak acid sites and are considered crucial for the high activity of GaOx-based catalysts. Moreover, the introduction of Pt as a promoter has helped facilitate hydrogen desorption and recover gallium hydride and hydroxide species, further enhancing the performance of GaOx catalysts. Recent research has confirmed that GaOx-based catalysts, especially those with active Ga3+ sites, offer promising alternatives for PDH processes, although their activity is still limited compared to noble Pt-based catalysts. Efforts to improve the activity of GaOx catalysts through doping and pretreatment with a reductive atmosphere are ongoing.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新型生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH相比传统方法提供了一条更高效、更专业的丙烯生产途径。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用，近年来的研究取得了进展。研究中关于活性Ga物种的争论主要集中在Ga2O3的单斜结构中协调不饱和Ga3+位点的作用。这些位点提供了大量的弱酸性位点，被认为是GaOx基催化剂高活性的关键。此外，引入Pt作为促进剂有助于促进氢解离并恢复镓氢和羟基物种，进一步提高了GaOx催化剂的性能。近期研究证实，特别是具有活性Ga3+位点的GaOx基催化剂为PDH过程提供了有前景的选择，尽管其活性仍低于贵金属基催化剂。通过掺杂和还原气氛预处理等方法提高GaOx催化剂活性的努力正在进行。
