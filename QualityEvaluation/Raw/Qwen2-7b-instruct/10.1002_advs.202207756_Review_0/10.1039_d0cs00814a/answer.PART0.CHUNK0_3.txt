1. The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the limitations of traditional methods in meeting increasing demands. The Catofin process utilizes chromium oxide catalysts for its low price and high catalytic Lewis acid activity.

2. PDH is a process that catalytically converts propane into propylene and hydrogen. It is considered one of the most promising propylene production methods due to its proprietary nature.

3. The Catofin process employs counter-current flow technology, which changes the flow direction of reactive materials, air downward and hydrocarbons directly upward, to enhance product yield and reduce costs.

4. Oleflex technology utilizes a fully recyclable platinum-based alumina catalyst, offering low production costs, high returns on investment, and minimal environmental impact.

5. Nickel-based catalysts have lower costs compared to platinum-based catalysts, making them an attractive option for propylene production.

6. Gallium oxide (GaOx) catalysts are being studied for their potential in propane dehydrogenation due to their active Lewis acid sites provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ ions.

7. Doping GaOx catalysts can significantly enhance their activity by increasing the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, leading to improved performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 随着化石能源消费的快速增长，传统的丙烯生产方法无法满足不断增长的需求，这促使了新型生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH），以满足需求。Catofin工艺利用铬氧化物催化剂因其低廉的价格和高催化Lewis酸活性而被采用。

2. PDH是一个催化转化丙烷为丙烯和氢的过程，被认为是最有前景的丙烯生产方法之一，因为它是一种专有的方法。

3. Catofin过程采用了逆流流动技术，改变反应材料、空气向下流动和烃类直接向上流动的方向，从而在较少的原料中获得更多的产品，降低了投资和运营成本。

4. Oleflex技术使用全可回收的铂基氧化铝催化剂，具有较低的生产成本、较高的投资回报率和较低的环境影响。

5. 镍基催化剂的成本低于铂基催化剂，因此它们是丙烯生产的一个有吸引力的选择。

6. 由于提供由共价不饱和Ga3+离子提供的Lewis酸位点，镓氧化物（GaOx）催化剂正在被研究用于丙烷脱氢。

7. 对GaOx催化剂进行掺杂可以显著提高其活性，通过增加共价不饱和Ga3+位点的数量，从而提高脱氢反应的性能。
