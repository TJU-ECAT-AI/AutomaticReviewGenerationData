Active sites. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of propane dehydrogenation behavior on metal oxide-based catalysts, identifying the exact nature of Lewis acid MO sites on which the adsorption of paraffin molecules takes place is quite necessary.

For CrOx-based catalysts, as discussed above, unsaturated and/or clustered Cr3+ sites are usually considered to be the active sites.

Over GaOx and ZrO2-based catalysts, there seem to be different dehydrogenation active sites.

Over GaOx-based catalysts, the activity for PDH is strongly dependent on the structure of Ga species.

Over ZrO2-based catalysts, coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ cations (Zrcus) are the active sites exhibiting PDH activity and selectivity.

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), aiming to efficiently convert propane into propylene. Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, particularly concerning the debate about the active Ga species. The catalysts involve Ga species like Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and polymorphs of gallium oxides, which play crucial roles in PDH reactions. Research findings have contributed to identifying the specific active sites on GaOx and ZrO2-based catalysts. This understanding helps in optimizing the performance of these catalysts for PDH processes, aiming to achieve higher propylene selectivity and stability under reaction conditions.

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product. This makes it one of the most promising propylene production methods. In the case of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the active Ga species have been a subject of ongoing debate. Recent research findings suggest that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. Altering the particle size and crystalline phase can significantly tune the concentration of Zrcus cations, enhancing the catalyst's performance. However, as the reduction degree of ZrO2 increases in Rh/ZrO2 catalysts, propylene can adsorb onto Rh strongly, leading to the blockage of the hydrogen recombination site, which hinders the promoting effect of the metal. The high activity of b-Ga2O3 is attributed to its monoclinic structure, which provides a large number of weak acid sites. H2 pretreatment increases the Zrcus sites, thereby enhancing the PDH performance.

需求的增长推动了丙烯生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为一种仅产生丙烯的专有方法。这使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法之一。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂，活性Ga物种一直存在争议。最近的研究发现表明，Ga2O3的活性位点是提供由配位不饱和Ga3+提供的Lewis酸位点。通过改变颗粒大小和晶体结构可以显著调整Zrcus离子的浓度，从而提高催化剂性能。然而，在Rh/ZrO2催化剂中，随着ZrO2的还原程度增加，丙烯会强烈吸附到Rh上，导致氢重组位点堵塞，从而阻碍金属的促进效果。b-Ga2O3的高活性归因于其单斜晶系结构，该结构提供了大量的弱酸位点。H2预处理可增加Zrcus位点，从而增强PDH性能。

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH offers a more efficient and specialized route to produce propylene compared to traditional methods. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through recent research. Studies have debated the active Ga species, with one key finding being the role of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites in the monoclinic structure of Ga2O3. These sites provide a large number of weak acid sites and are considered crucial for the high activity of GaOx-based catalysts. Moreover, the introduction of Pt as a promoter has helped facilitate hydrogen desorption and recover gallium hydride and hydroxide species, further enhancing the performance of GaOx catalysts. Recent research has confirmed that GaOx-based catalysts, especially those with active Ga3+ sites, offer promising alternatives for PDH processes, although their activity is still limited compared to noble Pt-based catalysts. Efforts to improve the activity of GaOx catalysts through doping and pretreatment with a reductive atmosphere are ongoing.
