[1] "The increasing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, including the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process, aiming to improve efficiency and selectivity."
[2] "Recent studies have revealed that the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst system can efficiently convert propane into propylene with high selectivity, demonstrating the potential of Ga species in this process."
[3] "There is an ongoing debate about the active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, with some suggesting that [GaH2]+ ions and the basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site play crucial roles in heterolytic CH bond activation."
