[1] "The traditional catalysts of PDH reaction are Pt and CrOx based catalysts,5,6 while the former is costly and the latter is noxious."
[2] "Numerous novel catalyst systems such as Zn, Sn, Co, Ga and carbon based catalysts have been reported for catalyzing PDH,3,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 which are void of shortcomings typical of commercial CrOx and Pt based catalysts."
[3] "Among them, Zn based materials are found to be one of the most promising catalysts due to the low price, environmental-friendly-ness and high catalytic performance in PDH.10,14,15"
[4] "The issue of this kind of catalysts is that a large proportion of Zn species is prone to form macrocrystalline ZnO on the external zeolite surface, and thus SN ZnO with catalytic potential are hard to be obtained."
[5] "However, the optimal Znβ-10 shows superior catalytic performance with the initial propane conversion as high as 53.3% at a high propylene selectivity of 92.9%."
[6] "The optimal catalyst of Znβ-10 exhibits high propane conversion and great propylene selectivity compared with the ZnHβ-10 and other Znβ catalysts."

1. The demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, especially PDH. Traditional catalysts like Pt and CrOx-based catalysts are costly and harmful, leading researchers to explore alternatives such as Zn, Sn, Co, Ga, and carbon-based catalysts. These alternatives are cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and display high catalytic performance in PDH.

2. In the context of PDH catalysts, Zn-based materials stand out as promising candidates due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high catalytic efficiency. However, these catalysts often struggle to retain their potential when macrocrystalline ZnO forms on the external surface of the zeolite.

3. The dealuminated β zeolite, with its vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups, has been identified as an ideal support for generating well-dispersed small ZnO clusters (SN ZnO) through host-guest interactions. These SN ZnO clusters are active sites in PDH, offering high catalytic activity and excellent propylene selectivity.

4. The Znβ-10 catalyst showcases outstanding performance in PDH, achieving an initial propane conversion of 53.3% alongside a high propylene selectivity of 92.9%.

5. Compared to the ZnHβ-10 and other Znβ catalysts, the Znβ-10 catalyst displays superior catalytic performance, demonstrating high propane conversion and great propylene selectivity.

1. 对丙烯的需求推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是PDH。传统的催化剂如Pt和CrOx基催化剂成本高且有害，促使研究者探索替代方案，如Zn、Sn、Co、Ga和碳基催化剂。这些替代方案具有成本效益、环保且在PDH中表现出高催化性能。

2. 在PDH催化剂领域，Zn基材料因其低成本、环保性和高催化效率而成为有前景的候选材料。然而，这些催化剂往往难以保持其潜力，当大量的ZnO晶粒形成在沸石表面时。

3. 处理后的β沸石，具有与硅醇基团关联的空T-原子位点，被识别为生成分散良好的小ZnO簇（SN ZnO）的理想支持，通过主客体相互作用。这些SN ZnO簇是PDH中的活性位点，提供高催化活性和出色的丙烯选择性。

4.Znβ-10催化剂在PDH中表现出卓越性能，初始丙烷转化率为53.3%，丙烯选择性高达92.9%。

5. 相比于ZnHβ-10和其他Znβ催化剂，Znβ-10催化剂在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面显示出优越的催化性能。

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Research has shown that Zn, Sn, Co, Ga, and carbon-based catalysts can effectively catalyze PDH without inheriting the drawbacks of traditional CrOx and Pt-based catalysts. Zinc oxide (ZnO) supported on aluminum oxide can act as Lewis acid sites (LAS) and efficiently catalyze PDH. Small ZnO nanoclusters (SN ZnO) are capable of activating the C-H bond, indicating their potential for PDH. However, active ZnO nanoclusters are small and unstable under harsh conditions. Zeolites offer an advantageous structure for dispersing and anchoring ZnO nanoclusters, ensuring stable and resistant conditions. Wang et al. prepared sub-nanometric ZnO clusters in the micropores of zeolite L using the incipient wetness impregnation method. Studies have revealed that small ZnO clusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite exhibit high catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH. The dealuminated β zeolite allows metal species to be accommodated and anchored due to the reaction between metal species and silanol groups. The optimal catalyst with 10 wt% Zn on dealuminated β zeolite shows a high initial propane conversion of approximately 53% and an outstanding propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000 cm³/gcat·h, along with high stability and satisfactory reusability.

丙烷对丙烯的巨大需求推动了新型生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。研究表明，锌、锡、钴、镓和碳基催化剂可以有效催化PDH，而无需继承传统CrOx和Pt基催化剂的缺点。锌氧化物（ZnO）支持在铝氧化物上可以作为Lewis酸中心（LAS），并能有效地催化PDH。小尺寸的ZnO纳米簇（SN ZnO）能够激活C-H键，表明它们具有PDH的潜在催化能力。然而，在恶劣条件下，活性ZnO纳米簇非常微小且不稳定。沸石提供了分散和锚定ZnO纳米簇的有利结构，确保了稳定和抗酸条件。王等人通过浸渍湿法在微孔沸石L中制备了亚纳米级的ZnO簇。研究发现，小尺寸的ZnO簇支持在去铝β沸石上的活性在PDH中表现良好。去铝β沸石允许金属物种被吸附和锚定，这归因于金属物种与硅醇基团之间的反应。最佳催化剂为含10 wt% Zn的去铝β沸石，表现出约53%的初始丙烷转化率和约93%的丙烯选择性，空间速度为4000 cm³/gcat·h，同时具有高稳定性和满意的可重复使用性。

Propane's abundance and the significant price difference between propane and propylene have led to the recognition of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) as an efficient production method. Zinc-based materials are considered among the most promising catalysts due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high catalytic efficiency in PDH. Numerous innovative catalyst systems, including zinc, tin, cobalt, gallium, and carbon-based catalysts, have been reported for PDH catalysis. However, most zinc species tend to aggregate on the external surface of zeolite to form bulk zinc oxide. This study suggests a novel approach to designing and synthesizing highly active PDH catalysts with high selectivity and stability. The dealuminated β zeolite is nearly devoid of strong acid sites, effectively minimizing side reactions.

丙烷的丰富来源以及丙烷和丙烯之间巨大的价格差距，使得将丙烷直接脱氢为丙烯（PDH）被视为最有效的方法之一。锌基材料被认为是最有前景的催化剂之一，因为它们具有低价格、环保性和在PDH中的高催化性能。已报道了许多创新的催化剂系统，包括锌、锡、钴、镓和碳基催化剂用于PDH催化。然而，大多数锌物种倾向于在沸石表面聚集形成批量锌氧化物。本研究提出了一种设计和合成具有高选择性和稳定性的高效PDH催化剂的新途径。去铝β沸石几乎不含强酸位点，有效减少了副反应。
