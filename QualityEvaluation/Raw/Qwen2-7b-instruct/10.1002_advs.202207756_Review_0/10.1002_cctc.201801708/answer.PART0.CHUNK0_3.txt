Propane's abundance and the significant price difference between propane and propylene have led to the recognition of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) as an efficient production method. Zinc-based materials are considered among the most promising catalysts due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high catalytic efficiency in PDH. Numerous innovative catalyst systems, including zinc, tin, cobalt, gallium, and carbon-based catalysts, have been reported for PDH catalysis. However, most zinc species tend to aggregate on the external surface of zeolite to form bulk zinc oxide. This study suggests a novel approach to designing and synthesizing highly active PDH catalysts with high selectivity and stability. The dealuminated β zeolite is nearly devoid of strong acid sites, effectively minimizing side reactions.

丙烷的丰富来源以及丙烷和丙烯之间巨大的价格差距，使得将丙烷直接脱氢为丙烯（PDH）被视为最有效的方法之一。锌基材料被认为是最有前景的催化剂之一，因为它们具有低价格、环保性和在PDH中的高催化性能。已报道了许多创新的催化剂系统，包括锌、锡、钴、镓和碳基催化剂用于PDH催化。然而，大多数锌物种倾向于在沸石表面聚集形成批量锌氧化物。本研究提出了一种设计和合成具有高选择性和稳定性的高效PDH催化剂的新途径。去铝β沸石几乎不含强酸位点，有效减少了副反应。
