[1] "The traditional catalysts of PDH reaction are Pt and CrOx based catalysts,5,6 while the former is costly and the latter is noxious."
[2] "Numerous novel catalyst systems such as Zn, Sn, Co, Ga and carbon based catalysts have been reported for catalyzing PDH,3,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 which are void of shortcomings typical of commercial CrOx and Pt based catalysts."
[3] "It is reported that ZnO supported on Al2O3 could serve as Lewis acid sites (LAS), which can efficiently catalyze PDH.14"
[4] "However, the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with ongoing debates about active Ga species."
[5] "Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts."
