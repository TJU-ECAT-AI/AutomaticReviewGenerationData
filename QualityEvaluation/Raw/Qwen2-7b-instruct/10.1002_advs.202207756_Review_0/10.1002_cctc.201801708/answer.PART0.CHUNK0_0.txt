[1] "The traditional catalysts of PDH reaction are Pt and CrOx based catalysts,5,6 while the former is costly and the latter is noxious."
[2] "Numerous novel catalyst systems such as Zn, Sn, Co, Ga and carbon based catalysts have been reported for catalyzing PDH,3,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 which are void of shortcomings typical of commercial CrOx and Pt based catalysts."
[3] "Among them, Zn based materials are found to be one of the most promising catalysts due to the low price, environmental-friendly-ness and high catalytic performance in PDH.10,14,15"
[4] "The issue of this kind of catalysts is that a large proportion of Zn species is prone to form macrocrystalline ZnO on the external zeolite surface, and thus SN ZnO with catalytic potential are hard to be obtained."
[5] "However, the optimal Znβ-10 shows superior catalytic performance with the initial propane conversion as high as 53.3% at a high propylene selectivity of 92.9%."
[6] "The optimal catalyst of Znβ-10 exhibits high propane conversion and great propylene selectivity compared with the ZnHβ-10 and other Znβ catalysts."

1. The demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, especially PDH. Traditional catalysts like Pt and CrOx-based catalysts are costly and harmful, leading researchers to explore alternatives such as Zn, Sn, Co, Ga, and carbon-based catalysts. These alternatives are cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and display high catalytic performance in PDH.

2. In the context of PDH catalysts, Zn-based materials stand out as promising candidates due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high catalytic efficiency. However, these catalysts often struggle to retain their potential when macrocrystalline ZnO forms on the external surface of the zeolite.

3. The dealuminated β zeolite, with its vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups, has been identified as an ideal support for generating well-dispersed small ZnO clusters (SN ZnO) through host-guest interactions. These SN ZnO clusters are active sites in PDH, offering high catalytic activity and excellent propylene selectivity.

4. The Znβ-10 catalyst showcases outstanding performance in PDH, achieving an initial propane conversion of 53.3% alongside a high propylene selectivity of 92.9%.

5. Compared to the ZnHβ-10 and other Znβ catalysts, the Znβ-10 catalyst displays superior catalytic performance, demonstrating high propane conversion and great propylene selectivity.

1. 对丙烯的需求推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是PDH。传统的催化剂如Pt和CrOx基催化剂成本高且有害，促使研究者探索替代方案，如Zn、Sn、Co、Ga和碳基催化剂。这些替代方案具有成本效益、环保且在PDH中表现出高催化性能。

2. 在PDH催化剂领域，Zn基材料因其低成本、环保性和高催化效率而成为有前景的候选材料。然而，这些催化剂往往难以保持其潜力，当大量的ZnO晶粒形成在沸石表面时。

3. 处理后的β沸石，具有与硅醇基团关联的空T-原子位点，被识别为生成分散良好的小ZnO簇（SN ZnO）的理想支持，通过主客体相互作用。这些SN ZnO簇是PDH中的活性位点，提供高催化活性和出色的丙烯选择性。

4.Znβ-10催化剂在PDH中表现出卓越性能，初始丙烷转化率为53.3%，丙烯选择性高达92.9%。

5. 相比于ZnHβ-10和其他Znβ催化剂，Znβ-10催化剂在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面显示出优越的催化性能。
