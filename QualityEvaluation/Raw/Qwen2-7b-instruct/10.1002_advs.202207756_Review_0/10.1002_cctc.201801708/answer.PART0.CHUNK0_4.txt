[1] "Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."
[2] "Numerous novel catalyst systems such as Zn, Sn, Co, Ga and carbon based catalysts have been reported for catalyzing PDH,3,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 which are void of shortcomings typical of commercial CrOx and Pt based catalysts."
[3] "Among them, Zn based materials are found to be one of the most promising catalysts due to the low price, environmental-friendly-ness and high catalytic performance in PDH.10,14,15"
[4] "The traditional catalysts of PDH reaction are Pt and CrOx based catalysts,5,6 while the former is costly and the latter is noxious."
[5] "However, the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debates about active Ga species."
[6] "Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, shedding light on the role of Ga in the PDH process."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as it offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional methods that rely on expensive catalysts like Pt and CrOx. Zinc-based materials have emerged as promising catalysts for PDH due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high catalytic efficiency. The traditional catalysts, Pt and CrOx, are known for their high costs and toxicity, respectively. Research on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has seen a progression in understanding the active species involved in the process. Recent studies have shed light on the role of Ga in facilitating the PDH reaction, contributing to a deeper comprehension of the mechanism and enhancing the performance of these catalysts.
