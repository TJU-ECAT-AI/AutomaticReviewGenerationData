[1] "Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Research has shown that Zn, Sn, Co, Ga, and carbon-based catalysts can effectively catalyze PDH without inheriting the drawbacks of traditional CrOx and Pt-based catalysts. Zinc oxide (ZnO) supported on aluminum oxide can act as Lewis acid sites (LAS) and efficiently catalyze PDH. Small ZnO nanoclusters (SN ZnO) are capable of activating the C-H bond, indicating their potential for PDH. However, active ZnO nanoclusters are small and unstable under harsh conditions. Zeolites offer an advantageous structure for dispersing and anchoring ZnO nanoclusters, ensuring stable and resistant conditions. Wang et al. prepared sub-nanometric ZnO clusters in the micropores of zeolite L using the incipient wetness impregnation method. Studies have revealed that small ZnO clusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite exhibit high catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH. The dealuminated β zeolite allows metal species to be accommodated and anchored due to the reaction between metal species and silanol groups. The optimal catalyst with 10 wt% Zn on dealuminated β zeolite shows a high initial propane conversion of approximately 53% and an outstanding propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000 cm³/gcat·h, along with high stability and satisfactory reusability.

丙烷对丙烯的巨大需求推动了新型生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。研究表明，锌、锡、钴、镓和碳基催化剂可以有效催化PDH，而无需继承传统CrOx和Pt基催化剂的缺点。锌氧化物（ZnO）支持在铝氧化物上可以作为Lewis酸中心（LAS），并能有效地催化PDH。小尺寸的ZnO纳米簇（SN ZnO）能够激活C-H键，表明它们具有PDH的潜在催化能力。然而，在恶劣条件下，活性ZnO纳米簇非常微小且不稳定。沸石提供了分散和锚定ZnO纳米簇的有利结构，确保了稳定和抗酸条件。王等人通过浸渍湿法在微孔沸石L中制备了亚纳米级的ZnO簇。研究发现，小尺寸的ZnO簇支持在去铝β沸石上的活性在PDH中表现良好。去铝β沸石允许金属物种被吸附和锚定，这归因于金属物种与硅醇基团之间的反应。最佳催化剂为含10 wt% Zn的去铝β沸石，表现出约53%的初始丙烷转化率和约93%的丙烯选择性，空间速度为4000 cm³/gcat·h，同时具有高稳定性和满意的可重复使用性。
