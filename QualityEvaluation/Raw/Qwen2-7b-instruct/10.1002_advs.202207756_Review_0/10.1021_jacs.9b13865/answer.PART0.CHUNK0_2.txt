1. The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), by driving the need for more efficient and selective catalysts. The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, providing insights into their structure and activity.
