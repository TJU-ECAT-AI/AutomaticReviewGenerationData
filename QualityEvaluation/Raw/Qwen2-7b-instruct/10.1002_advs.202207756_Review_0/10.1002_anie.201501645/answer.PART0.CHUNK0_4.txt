Inside Cover: Microfluidic Synthesis of Rigid Nanovesicles for Hydrophilic Reagents Delivery (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 13/2015) Graphical Abstract Nanocarriers for the delivery of hydrophilic reagents are important in drug therapy and disease diagnosis. In their Communication on page3952ff., J. Sun, X. Jiang, and co-workers report a three-stage microfluidic chip that can assemble water core/PLGA shell/lipid layer rigid nanovesicles (RNV) in one step for hydrophilic-reagent delivery (PLGA=poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)).
