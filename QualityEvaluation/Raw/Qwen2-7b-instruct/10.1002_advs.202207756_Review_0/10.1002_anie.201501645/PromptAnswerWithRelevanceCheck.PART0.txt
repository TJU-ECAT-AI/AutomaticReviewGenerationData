Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The development of a three-stage microfluidic chip by J. Sun, X. Jiang, and their team enables the assembly of rigid nanovesicles (RNVs) with a water core, PLGA shell, and lipid layer. These RNVs are used for the delivery of hydrophilic reagents, such as siMDR1 and doxorubicin, which exhibit an enhanced antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo when co-delivered to a multi-drug-resistant tumor model.

Inside Cover: Microfluidic Synthesis of Rigid Nanovesicles for Hydrophilic Reagents Delivery (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 13/2015) Graphical Abstract Nanocarriers for the delivery of hydrophilic reagents are important in drug therapy and disease diagnosis. In their Communication on page3952ff., J. Sun, X. Jiang, and co-workers report a three-stage microfluidic chip that can assemble water core/PLGA shell/lipid layer rigid nanovesicles (RNV) in one step for hydrophilic-reagent delivery (PLGA=poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)).
