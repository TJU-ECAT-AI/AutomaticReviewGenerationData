The development of a three-stage microfluidic chip by J. Sun, X. Jiang, and their team enables the assembly of rigid nanovesicles (RNVs) with a water core, PLGA shell, and lipid layer. These RNVs are used for the delivery of hydrophilic reagents, such as siMDR1 and doxorubicin, which exhibit an enhanced antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo when co-delivered to a multi-drug-resistant tumor model.
