The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Early studies suggested that Ga species catalyze the rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during alkane to aromatic conversion by promoting recombinative desorption of H-adatoms as H2, inhibiting unwanted cracking reactions. However, recent research indicates that Ga+3 species in fresh catalysts reduce at lower temperatures during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions, becoming present in a highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, likely as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. During propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, these hydride species release molecular hydrogen due to high surface hydrogen fugacities. Notably, reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when cooled to room temperature under flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist solely under reaction conditions. This highlights the importance of in-situ techniques in establishing the chemical form of catalytic sites, as pre- and post-reaction characterization alone can lead to misleading conclusions regarding the nature of these sites.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新型生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解经历了显著的演变。早期的研究表明，Ga物种通过促进H-adatom的重组脱附作为H2，催化烷烃到芳香族化合物转化过程中的限速脱氢步骤，同时抑制不希望的裂解反应。然而，最近的研究显示，在氢气预处理或丙烷反应过程中，新鲜催化剂中初始存在的Ga+3物种在低于770 K的温度下减少，以高度分散的形式存在，没有Ga邻近原子，可能以单体氢化物物种协调基本氧原子存在于沸石通道内。在H-ZSM5上的丙烷脱氢二聚化过程中，这些氢化物物种由于表面氢分压的高发展而释放分子氢。值得注意的是，当冷却至室温并在流动H2下时，还原的Ga物种重新氧化为Ga+3，这表明仅在反应条件下存在的活性Ga形式。这强调了原位技术在确定催化位点化学形式的重要性，因为仅通过前反应和后反应表征得出的结论可能导致关于这些位点性质的误导性结论。
