The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through ongoing debates about active Ga species. Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts. Initially, Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze the rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics. Reduced Ga species are present in a highly dispersed form, possibly as monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species release molecular hydrogen under the high surface hydrogen fugacities developed during propane dehydrocyclodimerization. Active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions, as reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when cooled to room temperature in flowing H2.

对丙烯的日益增长的需求已经影响了新的生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随着关于活性Ga物种的持续辩论而发展。最近的研究发现为当前关于这些催化剂的知识做出了贡献。最初，Ga物种在H-ZSM5沸石中催化烷烃转化为芳香族化合物的速率限制性脱氢步骤。减少的Ga物种以高度分散的形式存在，可能作为与沸石通道内的基本氧基配位的单体氢化物物种。这些氢化物物种在丙烷脱氢环二聚化过程中，在表面氢分压高的情况下释放分子氢。只有在反应条件下，减少的Ga物种才会在流动的H2中冷却至室温时重新氧化为Ga+3，表明仅在反应条件下存在活性的Ga形式。
