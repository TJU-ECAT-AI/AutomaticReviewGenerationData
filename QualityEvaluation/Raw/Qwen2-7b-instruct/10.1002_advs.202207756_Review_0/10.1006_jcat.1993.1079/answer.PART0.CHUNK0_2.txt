[1] "Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics."
[2] "Specifically, they promote the recombinative desorption of H-adatoms as H2 and thus inhibit undesired cracking reactions."

[4] "Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels."
[5] "These hydride species are driven to release molecular hydrogen by the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5."
[6] "Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through ongoing debates about active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, revealing that Ga+3 species initially present in fresh catalysts reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions. These reduced Ga species are likely monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. They are driven to release molecular hydrogen by high surface hydrogen fugacities during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. Notably, reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, indicating that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions.

丙烯的日益增长的需求已经影响了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的PDH理解已经通过关于活性Ga物种的持续辩论而演变。最近的研究为这些催化剂的当前知识做出了贡献，揭示了在低于770 K的温度下，新鲜催化剂中的Ga+3物种在氢预处理或丙烷反应期间会还原。这些还原的Ga物种很可能是协调在沸石通道内的基本氧原子上的单体氢化物物种。它们在H-ZSM5上的丙烷脱氢环二聚化过程中被高表面氢分压驱动释放分子氢。值得注意的是，当样品冷却至室温并在流动H2中时，还原的Ga物种重新氧化为Ga+3，这表明只有在反应条件下才存在活性形式的Ga。
