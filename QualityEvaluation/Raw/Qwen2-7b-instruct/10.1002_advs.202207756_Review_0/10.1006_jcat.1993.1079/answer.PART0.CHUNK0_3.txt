The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Initially, Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze the rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics. They promote the recombinative desorption of H-adatoms as H2, inhibiting undesired cracking reactions. Studies indicate that Ga+3 species present in fresh catalysts reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions. Reduced Ga is found in a highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, possibly as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species release molecular hydrogen due to high surface hydrogen fugacities during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 upon cooling to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist solely under reaction conditions.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经显著进化。最初，H-ZSM5沸石中的Ga物种催化烷烃转化为芳香烃的速率限制步骤。它们促进H-原子团的重组脱附为H2，从而抑制了不希望的裂解反应。研究表明，新鲜催化剂中的Ga+3物种在低于770 K的温度下通过氢气预处理或丙烷反应时会还原。还原的Ga以高度分散的形式存在，没有Ga邻近邻居，可能是一种与沸石通道内的基本氧基协调的单体氢化物物种。这些氢化物物种由于在H-ZSM5上的丙烷脱氢二聚化过程中表面氢分压的提高而释放分子氢。当样品冷却至室温并在流动H2中冷却时，还原的Ga物种重新氧化为Ga+3，这表明活性形式的Ga仅在反应条件下存在。
