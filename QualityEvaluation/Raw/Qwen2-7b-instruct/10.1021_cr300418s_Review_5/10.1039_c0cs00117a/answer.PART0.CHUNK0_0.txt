[1] "The fundamental properties of H2, CO, NO and C2H4 are shortly described in order to justify their different behaviour in respect of isolated sites in different environments, extended surfaces, clusters, crystalline or amorphous materials."
[2] "The limitations in the use of H2 as a probe is however represented by the very low interaction energy with most adsorbing centers, a fact which often requires very low temperatures (at least 77 K or even lower) to obtain reasonable H2 coverage."
[3] "Dihydrogen appears as an ideal molecule for the characterization of the Brnsted and Lewis acid properties of a complex system like Fe-silicalite, which is still extensively studied because of the unique properties as catalyst for one-step oxidation of benzene to phenol."
[4] "Dihydrogen has been also extensively used for the characterization of Brnsted acidity of zeolites. Also in this case the interaction is mainly electrostatic in nature and shows typical D n(HH) values for the OH  H2 interaction in the range E70 (strongly acid RSi(OH)AlR groups in H-SSZ-13 zeolite) C E30 cm1 (weakly acid RSiOH species),"
[5] "In the case of transition metal cations possessing partially filled d orbitals, a significant Mn+ - CO p-donation can occur from the orbitals of the d-block metal back to the orbitals of the CO molecule."

The fundamental properties of hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), and ethylene (C2H4) are briefly outlined to explain their varying behaviors on isolated sites within different environments, extended surfaces, clusters, crystalline, or amorphous materials. Hydrogen's low interaction energy with adsorbing centers necessitates the use of very low temperatures (typically below 77 K) to achieve reasonable coverage. Hydrogen proves to be an ideal molecule for characterizing the Brnsted and Lewis acid properties of complex systems like iron-silicalite, due to its unique characteristics as a catalyst in the one-step oxidation of benzene to phenol. In the context of zeolite characterization, hydrogen's interaction is primarily electrostatic, with distinct D n(HH) values observed for OH-H2 interactions on different types of zeolite surfaces. Transition metal cations with partially filled d orbitals can exhibit significant p-donation from the metal's orbitals to the CO molecule's orbitals, affecting their bonding characteristics.

氢（H2）、一氧化碳（CO）、二氧化氮（NO）和乙烷（C2H4）的基本性质被简要描述，以解释它们在不同环境、扩展表面、簇、晶体或非晶材料上的孤立位点表现出的不同行为。氢与吸附中心的低相互作用能量需要使用非常低的温度（通常低于77 K）来实现合理的覆盖率。氢是表征复杂体系如铁硅酸盐的独特性质作为苯到苯酚的一步氧化催化剂的理想分子。在对沸石的表征中，氢的相互作用主要是静电的，对不同的沸石表面观察到了明显的D n(HH)值。过渡金属离子具有部分填充的d轨道，可以显示出显著的从金属轨道向CO分子轨道的p捐赠，影响它们的键合特性。
