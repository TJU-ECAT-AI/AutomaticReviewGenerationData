[1] "The fundamental properties of H2, CO, NO and C2H4 are shortly described in order to justify their different behaviour in respect of isolated sites in different environments, extended surfaces, clusters, crystalline or amorphous materials."
[2] "The interaction of H2 with the following class of materials will be reviewed from the insight of IR spectroscopy;section 2.2: microporous polymers;section 2.3: zeolitic materials; section 2.4: MOFs materials; section 2.5: high surface area oxides; section 2.6: composite metal nanoparticles/zeolitic materials."
[3] "The spectra obtained upon dosage of H2 (PH2 E 8 kPa) at 20 K on a sample at the three different stages of treatment are compared in Fig. 5a): protonic (activated at 573 K in vacuum:black curve) activated (treated in high vacuum at 973 K: blue curve), oxidized (obtained by treating activated samples in oxygen (13 kPa) at 773 K and outgassing at 573 K: red curve)."
[4] "Dihydrogen is strongly perturbed by CPO-27-Ni, as testified by the doublet observed at 4035 and 4028 cm1 (D n(HH) = 130 cm1 DHads = 13.7 kJ mol1) starting from 180 K (orange curve in Fig. 6)."
[5] "In the case of Pd0Y the appearance of HF and LF bands are evident even if LF peak is only (1/10)th of the original indicating that the reduction process is more favored in the large super-cages than in the small sodalite and prismatic units."
[6] "It is also a matter of fact that the OH species in the super-cages are exchanged more rapidly and more efficiently by deuterium than those located in the sodalite-cages. This phenomenon can be explained on the basis of the potential barrier that atomic hydrogen (deuterium) has to overcome in order to access the cage."

1. The properties of hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen monoxide (NO), and ethylene (C2H4) are briefly described to explain their distinct behaviors on isolated sites in various environments, surfaces, clusters, crystalline, or amorphous materials.
2. The investigation of hydrogen interaction with different materials, such as microporous polymers, zeolitic materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), high surface area oxides, and composite metal nanoparticles/zeolitic materials, will be explored through infrared spectroscopy.
3. The spectra of hydrogen adsorption at 20 K on samples treated at different stages—protonic (activated at 573 K), activated (treated at 973 K), and oxidized (treated in oxygen at 773 K and outgassed at 573 K)—are compared visually.
4. Hydrogen's interaction with CPO-27-Ni is characterized by a doublet at 4035 and 4028 cm1, indicating a perturbation of 130 cm1 with a binding enthalpy of 13.7 kJ/mol.
5. In Pd0Y, the appearance of high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) bands is observed, with the LF peak being only 1/10th of the original, suggesting that the reduction process favors the super-cages over smaller units.
6. The OH species in super-cages are exchanged more quickly and efficiently by deuterium than those in sodalite-cages, which can be explained by the potential barrier hydrogen (deuterium) needs to surpass to enter the cage.

1. 氢（H2）、一氧化碳（CO）、二氧化氮（NO）和乙烷（C2H4）的性质简要描述，以解释它们在不同环境、表面、簇、晶体或非晶材料上的孤立位点行为的差异。
2. 将通过红外光谱法研究氢与微孔聚合物、沸石材料、金属有机框架（MOF）、高比表面积氧化物以及复合金属纳米粒子/沸石材料的相互作用。
3. 在不同处理阶段——原生质（573 K活化）、激活（973 K活化）、氧化（氧中活化后573 K退火）——样品的谱图在20 K下进行比较。
4. CPO-27-Ni与氢的相互作用表现为4035和4028 cm1的双峰，表明有130 cm1的扰动和13.7 kJ/mol的结合热。
5. 在Pd0Y中，HF和LF峰的出现是明显的，但LF峰值仅为原始值的1/10，这表明还原过程更倾向于超笼而不是较小的单位。
6. 超笼中的OH物种比sodalite笼更快更有效地被氘交换，这可以用氢（氘）进入笼子时需要克服的势垒来解释。
