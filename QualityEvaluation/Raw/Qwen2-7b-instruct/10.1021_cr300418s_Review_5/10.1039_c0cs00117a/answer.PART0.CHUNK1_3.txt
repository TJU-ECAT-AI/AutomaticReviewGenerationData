[1] "The importance of the Phillips catalyst in the industrial PE production287,288 and of surface modified ones289291 makes Cr/SiO2 one of the most investigated systems by several experimental techniques.16,292294"
[2] "Despite the huge amount of published literature, the structure of Cr6+/SiO2 and of its relative Cr2+/SiO2 (which is the most studied from a spectro- scopic point of view) is still unresolved."
[3] "This is mainly due to the amorphous nature of the support that prevents the use of diffraction techniques and is responsible of heterogeneity in the grafted species."
[4] "Also EXAFS spectroscopy, often used to investigate the local structure of amorphous systems, still did not fully elucidate the structure of Cr2+ sites due to the low Cr loading (0.5 wt%) and to its high reactivity toward O2/H2O poisons."
[5] "Finally, the absence of a structural model and the difficulty in treating open shell systems makes a computational approach not straightforward."
[6] "Indirect information on the coordination environment of Cr2+ sites have been obtained by vibrational spectroscopies of probe molecules."

1. The Phillips catalyst, particularly when surface-modified, is extensively studied due to its significant role in industrial polyethylene production.
2. The structures of Cr6+/SiO2 and Cr2+/SiO2 are not fully understood despite considerable research.
3. The lack of understanding is primarily attributed to the amorphous nature of the SiO2 support, which hinders the use of diffraction techniques.
4. Even EXAFS spectroscopy, typically utilized for studying amorphous systems, has not fully clarified the structure of Cr2+ sites due to low Cr loading and high reactivity towards O2/H2O poisons.
5. Computational approaches are challenging due to the absence of a structural model and difficulties in handling open-shell systems.
6. Vibrational spectroscopies of probe molecules provide indirect information about the coordination environment of Cr2+ sites.

1. 理查德催化剂，尤其是经过表面修饰的，由于其在工业聚乙烯生产中的重要性而被广泛研究。
2. Cr6+/SiO2和Cr2+/SiO2的结构尚未完全理解，尽管已经进行了大量的研究。
3. 缺乏理解主要是由于SiO2支持的非晶质性质，这阻碍了衍射技术的应用，并导致了物种的异质性。
4. 即使是EXAFS光谱，通常用于研究非晶态系统，也没有完全阐明Cr2+位点的结构，原因在于Cr的低负载量和对O2/H2O毒物的高反应性。
5. 由于缺乏结构模型和处理开放壳层系统的困难，计算方法的应用并不直接。
6. 探测分子的振动光谱提供了关于Cr2+位点配位环境的间接信息。
