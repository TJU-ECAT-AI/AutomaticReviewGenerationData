[1] "The vibrational spectroscopy of metal-bonded olefins has produced an abundant literature concerning metals-olefin systems in low temperature matrices, in which the metals are in the zerovalent state."
[2] "The formation of the polymer, already in the first stages of the reaction, is evidenced by the appearance of a pair of bands at 29242918 and 2851 cm1, growing with time in a parallel way at nearly constant rates."
[3] "The few bands evidenced in Fig. 35, which are observed also in absence of CO poison (although much lower in intensity) have been assigned to small, strained, metallacycle intermediate species."

The vibrational spectroscopy of metal-bonded olefins has provided extensive research on metal-olefin systems in low temperature environments. The formation of polymers is confirmed by the emergence of specific bands at 2924-2918 cm1 and 2851 cm1, which increase in parallel over time. In the absence of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, several small, strained, metallacycle intermediate species have been identified through FT-IR spectroscopy.

金属与烯烃之间的振动光谱研究在低温矩阵中产生了大量关于零价金属体系的文献。聚合物的形成可以通过在2924-2918 cm1和2851 cm1处出现的特定带证明，在时间上以几乎恒定的速度增长。在无CO毒害的情况下，通过FT-IR光谱技术识别出一些小、受约束的冶金环中间物种。

[1] "The vibrational modes of adsorbed ethylene are perturbed with respect to those of the gas phase,as summarized in Table 4."
[2] "The IR absorption bands at 2960 and 2876 cm1 (nasym(CH3) and nsym(CH3)) and at 1460 and 1382 cm1 (dasym(CH3) and dsym(CH3)), are characteristic of the terminal methyl group."
[3] "It is evident that, as the oligomerization proceeds, the relative intensity ratio of the CH3 and CH2 characteristic bands changes in favour to the CH2 ones."

The vibrational patterns of adsorbed ethylene are altered compared to the gas phase, as outlined in Table 4. The bands at 2960 and 2876 cm1 (nasym(CH3) and nsym(CH3)) and 1460 and 1382 cm1 (dasym(CH3) and dsym(CH3)) are indicative of the terminal methyl group. As oligomerization progresses, the relative intensity ratio between the CH3 and CH2 characteristic bands shifts in favor of the CH2 groups.

吸附的乙烯的振动模式相对于气相有所改变，这一信息总结于表4中。在2960和2876 cm1（nasym(CH3)和nsym(CH3)）以及1460和1382 cm1（dasym(CH3)和dsym(CH3)）处的吸收峰是末端甲基团的特征。随着寡聚化过程的进行，CH3和CH2特征峰的相对强度比向CH2方向变化。
