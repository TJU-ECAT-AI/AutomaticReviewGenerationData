1. The complex spectroscopy encountered when carbon monoxide (CO) is dosed onto real palladium (Pd) supported nanoparticle catalysts can provide significant insights into the structure and properties of the catalysts.
2. As the pressure of CO (PCO) is reduced, the most intense and sharp band in the spectra shifts from 1994 cm−1 to 1988 cm−1 with a decrease in the difference in natural frequency (Dn) by 6 cm−1, accompanied by a slight increase in intensity.
3. The frequency shifts observed in the spectra reported in Fig. 22c are much smaller than those seen in the single crystal experiments depicted in Fig. 22a and b.
4. When analyzing the intensities of the bands, caution must be exercised in relating the integrated area at the maximum coverage (ymax) to the relative abundance of the components.
5. By decreasing the equilibrium pressure (PNO), the relative contribution of adsorbed N2O2 (nitrogen dioxide dimer) and NO (nitrogen monoxide) can be favorably adjusted.
6. The formation of NO+ species (isoelectronic with neutral CO) on oxidic surfaces is a result of the interaction of NO with oxygen adsorbed on transition metal centers.
7. NO+ species formation is the outcome of direct electron donation to vanadium (V) centers or electron abstraction from a fluorine (F) center.
8. Due to the large direct Cu+  NO interaction energy, Cu+(NO)2 (copper(II)-NO complexes) are preferentially formed upon NO interaction, preventing the formation of N2O2 dimers.
9. The formation of unstable NO and C2O2 (carbon dioxide) species on defective potassium chloride (KCl) containing vanadium (V) and fluorine (F) centers is not a result of direct interaction with strong Lewis acid centers or vanadium centers.
10. The formation of NO+ species on oxidic surfaces is a consequence of the interaction of NO with oxygen adsorbed on transition metal centers.

1. 实际钯（Pd）负载纳米粒子催化剂上注入一氧化碳（CO）时遇到的复杂光谱学现象，可以为催化剂的结构和性质提供重要信息。
2. 随着CO压力（PCO）的降低，最强烈的且尖锐的光谱带从1994 cm−1移动到1988 cm−1，自然频率差（Dn）减少了6 cm−1，同时伴随着轻微的强度增加。
3. 在图22c中报告的光谱的频率偏移远小于在图22a和b中报告的单晶实验中的偏移量。
4. 分析强度时，需要小心地将最大覆盖度（ymax）处的积分面积与各成分的相对丰度联系起来。
5. 通过降低平衡压力（PNO），可以有利地调整吸附态N2O2（二氧化氮二聚体）和NO（一氧化氮）的相对贡献。
6. 由于直接Cu+  NO相互作用能量足够大，在NO的相互作用下，Cu+(NO)2（铜（II）-NO复合物）优先形成，阻止了N2O2二聚体的生成。
7. NO+物种（等电荷的CO）在氧化物表面上的形成是NO与过渡金属中心上吸附的氧的相互作用的结果。
8. 由于直接Cu+  NO相互作用能较大，Cu+(NO)2（铜（II）-NO复合物）在NO相互作用时优先形成，从而阻止了N2O2二聚体的生成。
9. 在含有钒（V）和氟（F）中心的缺陷钾氯化物（KCl）上形成的不稳定NO和C2O2（二氧化碳）物种并非直接与强Lewis酸中心或钒中心相互作用的结果。
10. NO+物种在氧化物表面上的形成是NO与过渡金属中心上吸附的氧的相互作用的结果。
