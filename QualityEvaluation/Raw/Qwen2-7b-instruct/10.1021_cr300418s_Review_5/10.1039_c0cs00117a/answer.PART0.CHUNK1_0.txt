nCO. See Fig. 25b for the analogous spectra of NO dosed on alkali metal exchanged-ferrierite. Part (b): when M posses empty orbitals of suitable energy an electron transfer from the CO MO to the s M AO occurs, resulting in a positive D nCO. Part (c): When M possesses d-electrons a back-donation from atomic d orbital to the molecular anti-bonding p-CO orbitals occurs, weakening the CO bond and inducing a negative D nCO. In some cases the three effects may occur concomitantly. Part (a) adapted with permission from ref. 169 (copyright American Institute of Physics 1995); part (b) unpublished.

The spectra of NO adsorbed on alkali metal exchanged-ferrierite show analogous characteristics to those of CO adsorbed on similar materials. When the metal M possesses empty orbitals of suitable energy, an electron transfer from the CO molecular orbital to the s M atomic orbital occurs, leading to a positive D nCO. When M has d-electrons, a back-donation from the atomic d-orbital to the CO's anti-bonding p-orbital happens, weakening the CO bond and causing a negative D nCO. These effects can occur simultaneously in some cases.

在碱金属交换沸石上吸附的NO的谱图与相似材料上吸附的CO的谱图具有类似特性。当金属M拥有适合能量的空轨道时，CO分子轨道向M原子轨道的电子转移发生，导致D nCO为正。当M有d电子时，原子d轨道向CO的反键p轨道的后捐赠发生，削弱CO键并导致D nCO为负。这些效应在某些情况下可以同时发生。
