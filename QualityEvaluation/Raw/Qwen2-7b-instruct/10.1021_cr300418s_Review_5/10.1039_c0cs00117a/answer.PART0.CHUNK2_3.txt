[1] "In order to be able to compare IR data with the surface science literature, i.e. to reach lower y values, the desorption process was progressively performed (down to PCO = 104 Torr) at increasing temperatures, up to 573 K."
[2] "The lowest y spectrum (red curve in Fig. 22d) exhibits three main components, at 1900, 1800 and 1694 cm1."
[3] "The 1900 cm1 component, due to the two-fold bridged carbonyls on Pd(100) faces, progressively shifts upwards at 1922, 1958, 1976, 1981 and up to 1988 cm1,for the spectrum collected after CO evacuation at 300 K (orange spectrum in Fig. 22d)."
[4] "As advanced above,the frequency evolution of these two components confirms their attribution to linear carbonyls adsorbed on defects (low frequency one) and on Pd(111) faces (high frequency one)."

1. To align infrared (IR) data with surface science literature and reach lower coverage (y) values, the desorption process was carried out progressively, from 104 Torr to 573 K, increasing temperatures.
2. The lowest coverage spectrum, represented by the red curve in Figure 22d, comprises three principal components at 1900, 1800, and 1694 cm1.
3. The 1900 cm1 component, associated with two-fold bridged carbonyls on Pd(100) faces, moves upward from 1922, 1958, 1976, 1981, to 1988 cm1, when the sample was desorbed at 300 K.
4. The frequency progression of these two components validates their assignment as linear carbonyls adsorbed on defects (lower frequency) and on Pd(111) surfaces (higher frequency).

1. 为了将红外（IR）数据与表面科学文献相匹配，即达到较低的y值，通过从104托到573开尔文的逐步升温过程进行脱附，温度逐渐升高。
2. 最低覆盖度光谱，由图22d中的红色曲线表示，包含三个主要成分，分别位于1900、1800和1694厘米1。
3. 当样品在300开尔文下被脱附时，与Pd(100)面上的二桥接羰基相关的1900厘米1组件向上移动至1922、1958、1976、1981和最终的1988厘米1。
4. 这两个频率的变化证实了它们分别对应于吸附在缺陷上的线性羰基（低频）和吸附在Pd(111)表面上的线性羰基（高频）的归属。
