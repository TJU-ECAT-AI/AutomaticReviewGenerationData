[1] "The vibrational spectroscopy of metal-bonded olefins has produced an abundant literature concerning metals-olefin systems in low temperature matrices, in which the metals are in the zerovalent state."
[2] "Only few vibrational data are present in the literature concerning the interaction of olefins with charged metal species."
[3] "The vibrational properties of the Cr(II)ethylene adducts are resumed in Table 4, and compared to those of the complexes formed on a-Cr2O3."
[4] "The shift of the n(CQ) vibrational mode with respect to the gas phase (Raman value) is the largest reported in the table (33 cm1), testifying that the molecule is strongly activated."
[5] "The few bands evidenced in Fig. 35, which are observed also in absence of CO poison (although much lower in intensity) have been assigned to small, strained, metallacycle intermediate species."

1. Vibrational spectroscopy has provided extensive research on metal-olefin systems with metals in the zerovalent state.
2. There are limited studies documenting the interaction of olefins with charged metal species.
3. The vibrational characteristics of the Cr(II)ethylene complexes are listed in Table 4 and contrasted with those formed on a-Cr2O3.
4. The Cr(II)ethylene complex shows significant activation, as evidenced by the largest shift in the n(CQ) vibrational mode compared to the gas phase.
5. The bands identified in Fig. 35 without CO poisoning belong to small, strained, metallacycle intermediates, albeit with lower intensity.
