[1] "The vibrational spectroscopy of metal-bonded olefins has produced an abundant literature concerning metals-olefin systems in low temperature matrices, in which the metals are in the zerovalent state."
[2] "In contrast, only few vibrational data are present in the literature concerning the interaction of olefins with charged metal species."

[5] "As already discussed in the previous chapter, these bands are assigned to in-phase and out-of phase stretching vibrations of CH2 groups, belonging to the growing polymeric chains."
[6] "Starting from the few reduced sites, the polymer chains grow and spread out on the flat a-Cr2O3 surfaces and tend to gradually cover the whole microcrystal."
[7] "The Phillips catalyst, in contrast to Ziegler and metallocene catalysts, is the only olefin polymerization catalyst where the active sites do not contain an initial alkyl ligand from which to grow the first polymer chain."
[8] "Consequently, the polymerization mechanism operating on the Phillips catalyst requires several additional and yet ill-defined steps that must precede polymerization itself, in order to transform the Cr(II) precursors into the real active sites."

Metal vibrational spectroscopy has extensively studied the interaction of olefins with zerovalent metals in low temperature matrices. In contrast, the interaction of olefins with charged metal species is less explored. FT-IR spectroscopy plays a crucial role in detecting intermediate species and understanding the ethylene polymerization mechanism. Scarano et al. conducted a detailed time-resolved FT-IR investigation on the interaction of ethylene with Cr3+ centers on a-Cr2O3. The bands assigned to CH2 stretching vibrations belong to the growing polymeric chains. Polymer chains start from reduced sites and spread across the a-Cr2O3 surfaces. The Phillips catalyst lacks initial alkyl ligands, necessitating additional steps for transforming Cr(II) precursors into active sites for ethylene polymerization.

金属振动光谱在低温矩阵中广泛研究了烯烃与零价金属的相互作用。相比之下，烯烃与带电金属物种的相互作用较少被探索。FT-IR光谱在检测中间物种和理解乙烯聚合机制中起着关键作用。Scarano等人对乙烯与a-Cr2O3上的Cr3+中心的相互作用进行了详细的时域FT-IR研究。分配给CH2拉伸振动的条带属于生长的聚合物链。聚合链从还原位点开始，并在整个a-Cr2O3表面上扩展。Phillips催化剂缺乏初始烷基配体，需要额外步骤将Cr(II)前体转化为活性位点以进行乙烯聚合。
