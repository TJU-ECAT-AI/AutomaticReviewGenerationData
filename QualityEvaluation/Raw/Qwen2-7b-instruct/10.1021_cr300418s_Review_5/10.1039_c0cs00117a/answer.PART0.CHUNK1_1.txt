[1] "The complexity of the IR spectroscopy of CO adsorbed on well defined oxide and halides surfaces is well documented by the set of coverage-dependent spectra reported in Fig. 20 (for ZnO,138 a-Cr2O3,334,383,384,389,400 MgCr2O4,10 LaCr2O3,10 TiO2 10,397 and CuCl),390 Fig. 21 (for MgO)14,17,182,389,401404 and Fig. 26a (for NiO).182,405407 The main components of the IR bands reported in those Figures are briefly commented on."
[2] "The stepwise evolution of the spectra of adsorbed CO as a function of coverage is a unique characteristic of ZnO: the five bands arise from the stepwise occupation of the surface Zn2+ sites, and correspond to different surroundings of any given CO molecules."
[3] "The spectra at increasing PCO adsorbed at 60 K on hsa, sintered and smoke MgO samples: parts (a), (b) and (c), respectively. All spectra have been vertically shifted for the sake of clarity. The decrease of the band intensity by moving from high (a) to low (c) surface area samples is remarkable."
[4] "The evolution of the IR spectra of CO dosed on low surface area NiO crystals as a function of coverage is reported in section 4.3 to allow a direct comparison with the series of spectra obtained dosing NO on the same material (vide infra Fig. 26a)."

1. The complexity of the infrared (IR) spectroscopy of carbon monoxide (CO) adsorbed on well-defined oxide and halide surfaces is documented by coverage-dependent spectra in Figures 20, 21, and 26a, which illustrate the spectra for various materials including ZnO, a-Cr2O3, MgCr2O4, LaCr2O3, TiO2, CuCl, and NiO.

2. The stepwise evolution of CO adsorption spectra on ZnO surfaces shows five distinct bands, each representing a different surrounding environment of CO molecules as the surface is occupied step-by-step by CO molecules.

3. The spectra of CO adsorbed on MgO samples of varying surface areas (high, sintered, and smoke) show a decrease in band intensity as the surface area decreases. This illustrates the impact of surface area on the characteristics of CO adsorption.

4. The evolution of CO IR spectra on low surface area NiO crystals is reported for comparison with NO adsorption spectra on the same material, as detailed in Section 4.3 of the document.

1. ZnO，a-Cr2O3，MgCr2O4，LaCr2O3，TiO2，CuCl和NiO等材料的表面吸附CO的红外光谱复杂性通过在图20、21和26a中的覆盖度依赖谱图得到证明。这些图展示了ZnO、a-Cr2O3、MgCr2O4、LaCr2O3、TiO2、CuCl和NiO等材料的吸附CO的谱图特性。

2.ZnO表面的CO吸附谱图的步进演化显示五种不同类型的谱带，每种代表CO分子周围环境的不同，随着表面被CO分子逐层占据。

3. 高、烧结和烟雾状MgO样品上的CO吸附谱图显示出随表面面积减少，谱带强度下降的趋势。这表明表面面积对CO吸附特性的影响。

4. 低表面区域NiO晶体上CO红外光谱的演化被报告用来与同种材料上NO吸附的谱图进行直接对比，详细信息在第4.3节中。
