[1] "Dihydrogen has been also extensively used for the characterization of Brnsted acidity of zeolites. Also in this case the interaction is mainly electrostatic in nature and shows typical D n(HH) values for the OH  H2 interaction in the range E70 (strongly acid RSi(OH)AlR groups in H-SSZ-13 zeolite) C E30 cm1 (weakly acid RSiOH species),154"
[2] "For electrostatic-type interactions, when comparison is made with the spectroscopic data concerning adsorption on the same sites of the much more popular CO probe (vide infra section 3), it is found that the shifts of the n(CO) and n(HH) frequencies are linearly correlated and that and D n(HH) E 2D n(CO)."
[3] "The close shell configuration of all alkali metal cations M+ makes them ideal probing sites for a pure electrostatic interaction. In such a case, the perturbation of the CO stretching frequency is proportional to the local electric field strength (E) according to the Stark effect:169"

1. Dihydrogen has been used to characterize Brnsted acidity in zeolites, typically showing OH-H2 interaction shifts in the range of 70 cm1 for strongly acid sites and 30 cm1 for weakly acid sites. 
2. The shifts in the frequencies of CO and H2 adsorption are linearly correlated, with the shift of H2 being twice that of CO. 
3. Alkali metal cations with a close shell configuration are ideal for probing pure electrostatic interactions, causing the CO stretching frequency to shift proportionally to the local electric field strength.

1. 氢分子也被用来表征沸石的Brnsted酸性，通常显示强酸位点的OH-H2相互作用偏移范围为70 cm1，弱酸位点为30 cm1。  
2. CO和H2吸附的频率偏移是线性相关的，H2的偏移量是CO的两倍。  
3. 具有紧密壳层配置的所有碱金属离子都是理想的电静电力探测站点，导致CO伸缩频率随局部电场强度的比例变化。
