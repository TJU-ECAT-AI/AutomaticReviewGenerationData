nCO. See Fig. 25b for the analogous spectra of NO dosed on alkali metal exchanged-ferrierite. Part (b): when M posses empty orbitals of suitable energy an electron transfer from the CO MO to the s M AO occurs, resulting in a positive D nCO. Part (c): When M possesses d-electrons a back-donation from atomic d orbital to the molecular anti-bonding p-CO orbitals occurs, weakening the CO bond and inducing a negative D nCO. In some cases the three effects may occur concomitantly. Part (a) adapted with permission from ref. 169 (copyright American Institute of Physics 1995); part (b) unpublished.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The spectra of NO adsorbed on alkali metal exchanged-ferrierite show analogous characteristics to those of CO adsorbed on similar materials. When the metal M possesses empty orbitals of suitable energy, an electron transfer from the CO molecular orbital to the s M atomic orbital occurs, leading to a positive D nCO. When M has d-electrons, a back-donation from the atomic d-orbital to the CO's anti-bonding p-orbital happens, weakening the CO bond and causing a negative D nCO. These effects can occur simultaneously in some cases.

[1] "The fundamental properties of H2, CO, NO and C2H4 are shortly described in order to justify their different behaviour in respect of isolated sites in different environments, extended surfaces, clusters, crystalline or amorphous materials."
[2] "The limitations in the use of H2 as a probe is however represented by the very low interaction energy with most adsorbing centers, a fact which often requires very low temperatures (at least 77 K or even lower) to obtain reasonable H2 coverage."
[3] "Dihydrogen appears as an ideal molecule for the characterization of the Brnsted and Lewis acid properties of a complex system like Fe-silicalite, which is still extensively studied because of the unique properties as catalyst for one-step oxidation of benzene to phenol."

The fundamental properties of hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), and ethylene (C2H4) are briefly outlined to explain their varying behaviors on isolated sites within different environments, extended surfaces, clusters, crystalline, or amorphous materials. Hydrogen's low interaction energy with adsorbing centers necessitates the use of very low temperatures (typically below 77 K) to achieve reasonable coverage. Hydrogen proves to be an ideal molecule for characterizing the Brnsted and Lewis acid properties of complex systems like iron-silicalite, due to its unique characteristics as a catalyst in the one-step oxidation of benzene to phenol. In the context of zeolite characterization, hydrogen's interaction is primarily electrostatic, with distinct D n(HH) values observed for OH-H2 interactions on different types of zeolite surfaces. Transition metal cations with partially filled d orbitals can exhibit significant p-donation from the metal's orbitals to the CO molecule's orbitals, affecting their bonding characteristics.

The vibrational properties of dihydrogen in the free state include two isomers differing for the orientation of the nuclear spins, para- (nuclear singlet state, I = 0) and ortho-H2 (nuclear triplet state, I = 1). These isomers give rise to distinguishable spectroscopic manifestations in the Raman spectrum of normal H2. Dihydrogen explores surfaces of polymers, zeolitic materials, MOFs, high surface area oxides, and composite metal nanoparticles/zeolitic materials. It is used to probe the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts by in situ IR spectroscopy, with the fundamental properties of dihydrogen, carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and ethylene briefly described to justify their different behaviors in various environments. The vibrational properties of dihydrogen in the free state are crucial for understanding its interactions with different materials. The evaluation of the intensity of specific IR bands upon changing temperature allows for the identification of adsorption enthalpies for various families of sites.

The spectra of dihydrogen adsorbed on Fe-Silicalite at different stages of treatment (protonic, activated, and oxidized) are compared. The spectra show that the thermal treatment causes iron migration from framework to extra-framework positions. The spectra also reveal the formation of iron complexes with dihydrogen, with the interaction energies and adsorption enthalpies dependent on the iron content and activation procedure. The evaluation of the intensity of specific IR bands upon lowering the surface coverage by changing the temperature enables the identification of adsorption enthalpies for different families of sites.

The vibrational properties of dihydrogen in the free state are essential for its use as a probe molecule in the characterization of heterogeneous catalysts. The evaluation of the intensity of specific IR bands upon changing temperature provides valuable insights into the adsorption enthalpies of various families of sites on the catalyst surfaces.

1. The complex spectroscopy encountered when carbon monoxide (CO) is dosed onto real palladium (Pd) supported nanoparticle catalysts can provide significant insights into the structure and properties of the catalysts.
2. As the pressure of CO (PCO) is reduced, the most intense and sharp band in the spectra shifts from 1994 cm−1 to 1988 cm−1 with a decrease in the difference in natural frequency (Dn) by 6 cm−1, accompanied by a slight increase in intensity.
3. The frequency shifts observed in the spectra reported in Fig. 22c are much smaller than those seen in the single crystal experiments depicted in Fig. 22a and b.
4. When analyzing the intensities of the bands, caution must be exercised in relating the integrated area at the maximum coverage (ymax) to the relative abundance of the components.
5. By decreasing the equilibrium pressure (PNO), the relative contribution of adsorbed N2O2 (nitrogen dioxide dimer) and NO (nitrogen monoxide) can be favorably adjusted.
6. The formation of NO+ species (isoelectronic with neutral CO) on oxidic surfaces is a result of the interaction of NO with oxygen adsorbed on transition metal centers.
7. NO+ species formation is the outcome of direct electron donation to vanadium (V) centers or electron abstraction from a fluorine (F) center.
8. Due to the large direct Cu+  NO interaction energy, Cu+(NO)2 (copper(II)-NO complexes) are preferentially formed upon NO interaction, preventing the formation of N2O2 dimers.
9. The formation of unstable NO and C2O2 (carbon dioxide) species on defective potassium chloride (KCl) containing vanadium (V) and fluorine (F) centers is not a result of direct interaction with strong Lewis acid centers or vanadium centers.
10. The formation of NO+ species on oxidic surfaces is a consequence of the interaction of NO with oxygen adsorbed on transition metal centers.

[1] "The importance of the Phillips catalyst in the industrial PE production287,288 and of surface modified ones289291 makes Cr/SiO2 one of the most investigated systems by several experimental techniques.16,292294"
[2] "Despite the huge amount of published literature, the structure of Cr6+/SiO2 and of its relative Cr2+/SiO2 (which is the most studied from a spectro- scopic point of view) is still unresolved."
[3] "This is mainly due to the amorphous nature of the support that prevents the use of diffraction techniques and is responsible of heterogeneity in the grafted species."
[4] "Also EXAFS spectroscopy, often used to investigate the local structure of amorphous systems, still did not fully elucidate the structure of Cr2+ sites due to the low Cr loading (0.5 wt%) and to its high reactivity toward O2/H2O poisons."
[5] "Finally, the absence of a structural model and the difficulty in treating open shell systems makes a computational approach not straightforward."
[6] "Indirect information on the coordination environment of Cr2+ sites have been obtained by vibrational spectroscopies of probe molecules."

[1] "The fundamental properties of H2, CO, NO and C2H4 are shortly described in order to justify their different behaviour in respect of isolated sites in different environments, extended surfaces, clusters, crystalline or amorphous materials."
[2] "The interaction of H2 with the following class of materials will be reviewed from the insight of IR spectroscopy;section 2.2: microporous polymers;section 2.3: zeolitic materials; section 2.4: MOFs materials; section 2.5: high surface area oxides; section 2.6: composite metal nanoparticles/zeolitic materials."
[3] "The spectra obtained upon dosage of H2 (PH2 E 8 kPa) at 20 K on a sample at the three different stages of treatment are compared in Fig. 5a): protonic (activated at 573 K in vacuum:black curve) activated (treated in high vacuum at 973 K: blue curve), oxidized (obtained by treating activated samples in oxygen (13 kPa) at 773 K and outgassing at 573 K: red curve)."
[4] "Dihydrogen is strongly perturbed by CPO-27-Ni, as testified by the doublet observed at 4035 and 4028 cm1 (D n(HH) = 130 cm1 DHads = 13.7 kJ mol1) starting from 180 K (orange curve in Fig. 6)."
[5] "In the case of Pd0Y the appearance of HF and LF bands are evident even if LF peak is only (1/10)th of the original indicating that the reduction process is more favored in the large super-cages than in the small sodalite and prismatic units."
[6] "It is also a matter of fact that the OH species in the super-cages are exchanged more rapidly and more efficiently by deuterium than those located in the sodalite-cages. This phenomenon can be explained on the basis of the potential barrier that atomic hydrogen (deuterium) has to overcome in order to access the cage."

1. The properties of hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen monoxide (NO), and ethylene (C2H4) are briefly described to explain their distinct behaviors on isolated sites in various environments, surfaces, clusters, crystalline, or amorphous materials.
2. The investigation of hydrogen interaction with different materials, such as microporous polymers, zeolitic materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), high surface area oxides, and composite metal nanoparticles/zeolitic materials, will be explored through infrared spectroscopy.
3. The spectra of hydrogen adsorption at 20 K on samples treated at different stages—protonic (activated at 573 K), activated (treated at 973 K), and oxidized (treated in oxygen at 773 K and outgassed at 573 K)—are compared visually.
4. Hydrogen's interaction with CPO-27-Ni is characterized by a doublet at 4035 and 4028 cm1, indicating a perturbation of 130 cm1 with a binding enthalpy of 13.7 kJ/mol.
5. In Pd0Y, the appearance of high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) bands is observed, with the LF peak being only 1/10th of the original, suggesting that the reduction process favors the super-cages over smaller units.
6. The OH species in super-cages are exchanged more quickly and efficiently by deuterium than those in sodalite-cages, which can be explained by the potential barrier hydrogen (deuterium) needs to surpass to enter the cage.
