The vibrational properties of dihydrogen in the free state include two isomers differing for the orientation of the nuclear spins, para- (nuclear singlet state, I = 0) and ortho-H2 (nuclear triplet state, I = 1). These isomers give rise to distinguishable spectroscopic manifestations in the Raman spectrum of normal H2. Dihydrogen explores surfaces of polymers, zeolitic materials, MOFs, high surface area oxides, and composite metal nanoparticles/zeolitic materials. It is used to probe the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts by in situ IR spectroscopy, with the fundamental properties of dihydrogen, carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and ethylene briefly described to justify their different behaviors in various environments. The vibrational properties of dihydrogen in the free state are crucial for understanding its interactions with different materials. The evaluation of the intensity of specific IR bands upon changing temperature allows for the identification of adsorption enthalpies for various families of sites.

The spectra of dihydrogen adsorbed on Fe-Silicalite at different stages of treatment (protonic, activated, and oxidized) are compared. The spectra show that the thermal treatment causes iron migration from framework to extra-framework positions. The spectra also reveal the formation of iron complexes with dihydrogen, with the interaction energies and adsorption enthalpies dependent on the iron content and activation procedure. The evaluation of the intensity of specific IR bands upon lowering the surface coverage by changing the temperature enables the identification of adsorption enthalpies for different families of sites.

The vibrational properties of dihydrogen in the free state are essential for its use as a probe molecule in the characterization of heterogeneous catalysts. The evaluation of the intensity of specific IR bands upon changing temperature provides valuable insights into the adsorption enthalpies of various families of sites on the catalyst surfaces.
