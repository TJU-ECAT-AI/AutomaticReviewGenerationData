The EELS technique, when utilized in conjunction with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), has garnered significant interest due to its capability to ascertain oxidation state information at an atomic level, as highlighted in recent studies [3134]. Furthermore, the fitting method employed in electron loss near-edge spectroscopy (ELNES) is deemed a reliable approach for determining transition metal (TM) oxidation states, provided that precise peak positions are accounted for. This methodology is notably valid, with the exception scenarios involving alterations in the spin state.

结合扫描透射电子显微镜(STEM)使用，EELS技术因其能够在原子级别提供氧化态信息而受到近年来的广泛关注，如最近的研究[3134]所示。此外，应用于电子损失近边光谱(ELNES)的拟合方法被证明是测定过渡金属(TM)氧化状态的有效手段，前提是准确的峰位置得到考虑。这种方法通常被认为是有效的，除非涉及到自旋状态的变化情况。
