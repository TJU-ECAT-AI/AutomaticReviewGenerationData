[1] "Transition metal L2;3 electron energy-loss spectra for a wide range of V-, Mn- and Fe-based oxides were recorded and carefully analyzed for their correlation with the formal oxidation states of the transition metal ions."
[2] "The obtained conclusions are of fundamental importance, e.g., for obtaining atomic resolution oxidation state information in modern experiments."
[3] "Oxidation states can be accurately measured by redox titration techniques or thermogravimetric reduction but these techniques are material dependent and provide information averaged over the whole sample."
[4] "The ability of EELS to obtain oxidation state information at atomic resolution when combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has drawn much attention in recent years."
[5] "The white-line ratio method, chemical shift method, ELNES fitting method, two-parameter method and other methods are compared and their validity is discussed."
[6] "The peak position uncertainty obtained in this way is within 0.05 eV (1 CCD channel)."
[7] "The fact that a series of spectra is taken over time also allows to carefully check for changes in the spectra over time due to beam damage."
[8] "The obtained edge onset energies for all the investigated materials are summarized in Tables 13 for the Mn/Fe/V oxides,respectively."
[9] "Generally speaking, these L3 edge onset energies show a monotonic increase with cation oxidation state."
[10] "The onset of Fe3.8 in BaFeO2.9 is at the same level as Fe3. This can be explained as BaFeO2.9 is a non-stoichiometric compound where, to compensate the deficiency of oxygen, part of the Fe ions may be randomly reduced to the 3 state."
[11] "The absolute peak position method measures the energy-loss of excitations, which is closely related to the energy level of the inner-shell electrons and the final states."

1. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is utilized to analyze transition metal L2;3 spectra for a wide range of V-, Mn-, and Fe-based oxides, providing insight into their formal oxidation states.

2. Obtained conclusions from the analysis of these spectra are crucial for achieving atomic resolution oxidation state information in contemporary experiments.

3. Accurate measurement of oxidation states can also be achieved through redox titration techniques or thermogravimetric reduction, although these methods provide averaged information across the entire sample.

4. The combination of EELS with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) enables the acquisition of oxidation state information at the atomic resolution level, garnering attention recently.

5. Multiple methods, including the white-line ratio, chemical shift, ELNES fitting, and two-parameter approaches, are compared and their validity is discussed.

6. The uncertainty in measuring the core-loss edge position is minimized to within 0.05 eV.

7. Continuous monitoring of spectra over time allows for careful assessment of potential changes due to beam damage.

8. Edge onset energies for various oxides, including Mn, Fe, and V, are compiled and presented in tables.

9. These L3 edge onset energies consistently demonstrate a monotonic increase with the cation's oxidation state.

10. The Fe3.8 compound in BaFeO2.9 has an onset level similar to Fe3, attributable to BaFeO2.9's non-stoichiometry, causing some Fe ions to be randomly reduced to the 3 state to compensate for oxygen deficiency.

11. The absolute peak position method quantifies the energy-loss transitions, closely related to the energy levels of inner-shell electrons and final states.

12. The ELNES fitting method, when accurate peak positions are used, is considered a reliable approach for measuring transition metal oxidation states.
