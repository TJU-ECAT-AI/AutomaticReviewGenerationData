How does Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contribute to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts, particularly in terms of their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity, and what insights can it provide about the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility, as exemplified by studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania?

There are no specific quotes from the provided literature regarding the use of Raman spectroscopy in the context of doped catalysts, their composition, structure, in situ behavior, reactivity, or the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility. The document focuses on electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) techniques for studying transition metal oxidation states in oxides, rather than Raman spectroscopy.

没有与提供的文献中关于掺杂催化剂的拉曼光谱应用、组成、结构、原位行为、反应性，或谱特征与催化剂性质（如还原性）之间的关系相关的具体引文。该文档主要关注在氧化物中研究过渡金属氧化态的电子能量损失光谱技术，而不是拉曼光谱。
