[1] "The ability of EELS to obtain oxidation state information at atomic resolution when combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has drawn much attention in recent years [3134]."
[2] "In electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), a considerable amount of publications exist linking TM oxidation states to the detailed shape of the L2,3 (2p-3d) excitation edge [1430]."
[3] "The L2,3 edge appears to be split and the intensity ratio of the split peaks was found to be the same with the well-crystalized hausmannite mineral [16,31]."
[4] "The white-line ratio also sensitively depends on the size and position of the integration window due to the subtle differences in the ELNES shape of the different compounds."
[5] "The obtained conclusions are of fundamental importance, e.g., for obtaining atomic resolution oxidation state information in modern experiments."
[6] "The L3 peak maximum is strongly affected by its ELNES and hence by oxidation state, coordination geometry and spin states [19,52]."
