<p>Transition metals (TMs) in oxide materials are known to adopt many different oxidation states, which leads to a wide range of chemical and physical properties of the TM complex oxides.</p>
<p>The obtained conclusions are of fundamental importance, e.g., for obtaining atomic resolution oxidation state information in modern experiments.</p>
<p>To obtain spatially selective information,several spectroscopic techniques are routinely used; obtaining valency information from the shape of the excitation spectra of TMs in e.g., X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).</p>
<p>The ability of EELS to obtain oxidation state information at atomic resolution when combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has drawn much attention in recent years.</p>
<p>The discovery of 2D materials, in particular, having conducting (or superconducting [39]) electron gas at the interface between two insulating materials dramatically increased the interest in measuring the oxidation state of TM cations with high spatial resolution.</p>
<p>Although many solutions for this charge counting problem have been proposed, formal charge counting remains of fundamental importance for understanding the physics and properties of complex TM oxides.</p>
<p>In spite of this great potential, there are several restrictions in linking the detailed shape of EELS excitation edges to the oxidation state.</p>
<p>Several procedures exist, and undoubtedly the most popular is a procedure called the white-line ratio or L2,3 ratio method.</p>
<p>Although this method was successful in determining the oxidation states of Mn and Fe in some minerals in a limited oxidation state range, it is experimentally and theoretically clear that the white-line ratio has no strict one to one correspondence with the oxidation state.</p>
<p>Especially for Fe, this relation is not monotonic, making unambiguous oxidation state determination difficult.</p>
<p>This could be because the K edge is mainly related to bond distance and coordination number,whereas L edges provide information about the oxidation state and symmetry of the coordination environment of the 3d TM ions.</p>
<p>Garvie et al. reported the high similarity of Mn-L edge energy-loss near-edge structures (ELNES) for different compounds with the same Mn formal oxidation states of 2, 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the L edge ELNES of TMs has successfully been used to determine their oxidation states by direct comparison or ELNES fitting to reference spectra.</p>
<p>In the present paper, this method is further improved and systematically applied to a wide group of V/Mn/Fe oxides aiming at revealing the relation between the oxidation states of these TMs and their EELS spectra.</p>
<p>This work can serve as a reference to interpret modern spatially resolved EELS data.</p>
<p>EELS experiments were performed using a JEOL 3000F microscope equipped with a Gatan GIF2000 1 K Phosphor spectrometer system operating at 300 kV.</p>
<p>Special attention is paid to obtain an accurate energy scale which provides absolute energy positions for all core-loss edges.</p>
<p>The obtained conclusions are of fundamental importance, e.g., for obtaining atomic resolution oxidation state information in modern experiments.</p>
<p>Oxidation states can be accurately measured by redox titration techniques or thermogravimetric reduction but these techniques are material dependent and provide information averaged over the whole sample.</p>
<p>To obtain spatially selective information,several spectroscopic techniques are routinely used; obtaining valency information from the shape of the excitation spectra of TMs in e.g., X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).</p>
<p>In electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), a considerable amount of publications exist linking TM oxidation states to the detailed shape of the L2,3 (2p-3d) excitation edge.</p>
<p>The ability of EELS to obtain oxidation state information at atomic resolution when combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has drawn much attention in recent years.</p>
<p>The discovery of 2D materials, in particular, having conducting (or superconducting [39]) electron gas at the interface between two insulating materials dramatically increased the interest in measuring the oxidation state of TM cations with high spatial resolution.</p>
<p>Despite the potential of EELS, several limitations exist when linking the detailed shape of EELS excitation edges to the oxidation state.</p>
<p>One widely used method is the white-line ratio method, which correlates the integral intensity ratio of the L3 (2p3=2-3d) and L2 (2p1=2-3d) excitation peaks of a TM with its formal oxidation state.</p>
<p>However, this method has limitations and is not always accurate due to factors such as sample thickness, measurement procedure, and the non-monotonic relationship with Fe oxidation state.</p>
<p>Another approach is the chemical shift method, which relies on the observation that the excitation edges of TMs shift to higher energy losses for higher oxidation states.</p>
<p>Studies on the ELNES of TMs in various oxides have shown a monotonic increase in the L3 edge onset energy with increasing oxidation state.</p>
<p>These findings support the use of ELNES fitting as a method to measure TM oxidation states, particularly when accurate peak positions are utilized.</p>
