[1] "The ability of EELS to obtain oxidation state information at atomic resolution when combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has drawn much attention in recent years [3134]."
[2] "The ELNES fitting method to measure TM oxidation states is generally valid especially when accurate peak positions are used (except when the spin state changes)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The EELS technique, when utilized in conjunction with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), has garnered significant interest due to its capability to ascertain oxidation state information at an atomic level, as highlighted in recent studies [3134]. Furthermore, the fitting method employed in electron loss near-edge spectroscopy (ELNES) is deemed a reliable approach for determining transition metal (TM) oxidation states, provided that precise peak positions are accounted for. This methodology is notably valid, with the exception scenarios involving alterations in the spin state.

<p>Transition metals (TMs) in oxide materials are known to adopt many different oxidation states, which leads to a wide range of chemical and physical properties of the TM complex oxides.</p>
<p>The obtained conclusions are of fundamental importance, e.g., for obtaining atomic resolution oxidation state information in modern experiments.</p>
<p>To obtain spatially selective information,several spectroscopic techniques are routinely used; obtaining valency information from the shape of the excitation spectra of TMs in e.g., X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).</p>
<p>The ability of EELS to obtain oxidation state information at atomic resolution when combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has drawn much attention in recent years.</p>
<p>The discovery of 2D materials, in particular, having conducting (or superconducting [39]) electron gas at the interface between two insulating materials dramatically increased the interest in measuring the oxidation state of TM cations with high spatial resolution.</p>
<p>Although many solutions for this charge counting problem have been proposed, formal charge counting remains of fundamental importance for understanding the physics and properties of complex TM oxides.</p>
<p>In spite of this great potential, there are several restrictions in linking the detailed shape of EELS excitation edges to the oxidation state.</p>
<p>Several procedures exist, and undoubtedly the most popular is a procedure called the white-line ratio or L2,3 ratio method.</p>
<p>Although this method was successful in determining the oxidation states of Mn and Fe in some minerals in a limited oxidation state range, it is experimentally and theoretically clear that the white-line ratio has no strict one to one correspondence with the oxidation state.</p>
<p>Especially for Fe, this relation is not monotonic, making unambiguous oxidation state determination difficult.</p>
<p>This could be because the K edge is mainly related to bond distance and coordination number,whereas L edges provide information about the oxidation state and symmetry of the coordination environment of the 3d TM ions.</p>
<p>Garvie et al. reported the high similarity of Mn-L edge energy-loss near-edge structures (ELNES) for different compounds with the same Mn formal oxidation states of 2, 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the L edge ELNES of TMs has successfully been used to determine their oxidation states by direct comparison or ELNES fitting to reference spectra.</p>
<p>In the present paper, this method is further improved and systematically applied to a wide group of V/Mn/Fe oxides aiming at revealing the relation between the oxidation states of these TMs and their EELS spectra.</p>
<p>This work can serve as a reference to interpret modern spatially resolved EELS data.</p>
<p>EELS experiments were performed using a JEOL 3000F microscope equipped with a Gatan GIF2000 1 K Phosphor spectrometer system operating at 300 kV.</p>
<p>Special attention is paid to obtain an accurate energy scale which provides absolute energy positions for all core-loss edges.</p>
<p>The obtained conclusions are of fundamental importance, e.g., for obtaining atomic resolution oxidation state information in modern experiments.</p>
<p>Oxidation states can be accurately measured by redox titration techniques or thermogravimetric reduction but these techniques are material dependent and provide information averaged over the whole sample.</p>
<p>To obtain spatially selective information,several spectroscopic techniques are routinely used; obtaining valency information from the shape of the excitation spectra of TMs in e.g., X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).</p>
<p>In electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), a considerable amount of publications exist linking TM oxidation states to the detailed shape of the L2,3 (2p-3d) excitation edge.</p>
<p>The ability of EELS to obtain oxidation state information at atomic resolution when combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has drawn much attention in recent years.</p>
<p>The discovery of 2D materials, in particular, having conducting (or superconducting [39]) electron gas at the interface between two insulating materials dramatically increased the interest in measuring the oxidation state of TM cations with high spatial resolution.</p>
<p>Despite the potential of EELS, several limitations exist when linking the detailed shape of EELS excitation edges to the oxidation state.</p>
<p>One widely used method is the white-line ratio method, which correlates the integral intensity ratio of the L3 (2p3=2-3d) and L2 (2p1=2-3d) excitation peaks of a TM with its formal oxidation state.</p>
<p>However, this method has limitations and is not always accurate due to factors such as sample thickness, measurement procedure, and the non-monotonic relationship with Fe oxidation state.</p>
<p>Another approach is the chemical shift method, which relies on the observation that the excitation edges of TMs shift to higher energy losses for higher oxidation states.</p>
<p>Studies on the ELNES of TMs in various oxides have shown a monotonic increase in the L3 edge onset energy with increasing oxidation state.</p>
<p>These findings support the use of ELNES fitting as a method to measure TM oxidation states, particularly when accurate peak positions are utilized.</p>
