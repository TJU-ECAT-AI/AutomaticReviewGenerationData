[1] "We have found that the activity and the selectivity of the Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 catalyst for CO2 methanation is comparable to that of the best catalysts reported previously."
[2] "It is always difficult to prove that the catalyst is a doped oxide."
[3] "Our electron microscopy and XRD measurements suggest that Ru is incorporated into the ceria lattice."
[4] "The XPS measurements indicate that Ru is ionic and is present in the surface region."
[5] "The DFT calculations show that Ce1xRuxO2 has the lowest energy when the Ru atoms are in the second Ce layer (of the CeO2(1 1 1) surface)."
[6] "Therefore, if the Ru atoms are close to being in chemical equilibrium, most of them are likely to be in the surface region."
[7] "Given the surface area and the number of surface sites and given the number of Ru atoms we add to the system, we conclude that many Ru atoms are in the bulk."
[8] "The XRD measurements show that Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 has the ceria structure with a modified lattice constant, which can only happen if a substantial fraction of the Ru atoms are in the bulk."
[9] "The catalyst made by the combustion method is more reducible than ceria."
[10] "In much of the literature on CO2 methanation, it is assumed (and sometimes proven) that the hydrogenation of CO2 consists of the reduction of CO2 to CO, followed by the conversion to alkanes by a FischerTropsch process."
[11] "Our TPR measurements show that CO + H2 react to produce CO2 and water and practically no methane; therefore, gas-phase CO is not a reaction intermediate for the methanation of CO2 by Ce0.95Ru0.05O2."
