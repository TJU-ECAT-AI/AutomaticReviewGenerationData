[1] "Ceria doped with Ni or Co is not selective: it catalyzes methanation and the reverse watergas shift reaction."
[2] "Pd-doped ceria produces only CO."
[3] "The activity and the selectivity of the Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 catalyst for CO2 methanation is comparable to that of the best catalysts reported previously."
[4] "A variety of temperature-programmed reaction measurements show that the catalyst made by the combustion method is more reducible than ceria."
[5] "In the past, we have used density functional calculations to try to classify the possible roles played by substitutional doping of oxides."
[6] "Hydrogen reduces the surface at a temperature well below the temperature at which methanation occurs. Therefore, the methanation reaction takes place on the reduced surface and the role of the dopant is to facilitate the reduction of the oxide."

1. Ceria doped with Ni or Co is not selective—it catalyzes both CO2 methanation and the reverse watergas shift reaction. 
2. Pd-doped ceria only produces CO.
3. The Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 catalyst has activity and selectivity for CO2 methanation similar to the best catalysts previously reported.
4. The catalyst made by the combustion method is more reducible than pure ceria, as shown by temperature-programmed reaction measurements.
5. Density functional calculations have been utilized to categorize the possible roles of substitutional doping in oxides.
6. The role of the dopant in the Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 catalyst is to facilitate the reduction of the oxide, which occurs at a lower temperature than the methanation reaction. This enables the methanation reaction to occur on the reduced surface.

1. 添加镍或钴的氧化铈不具有选择性，它催化二氧化碳甲烷化和逆水煤气变换反应。
2. 铑钯（Pd）掺杂的氧化铈仅产生一氧化碳。
3. Ce0.95Ru0.05O2催化剂在二氧化碳甲烷化过程中的活性和选择性与之前报道的最佳催化剂相似。
4. 通过温度程序反应测量显示，由燃烧法制备的催化剂比纯氧化铈更易还原。
5. 密度泛函计算已被用来对氧化物中的掺杂作用进行分类。
6. Ce0.95Ru0.05O2催化剂中掺杂的作用是促进氧化物的还原，该过程发生在甲烷化反应温度以下的较低温度。这使得甲烷化反应可以在还原后的表面发生。
