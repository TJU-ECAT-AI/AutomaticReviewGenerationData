[1] "The addition of oxygen in the feed poisons the reaction by annihilating the oxygen vacancies."
[2] "We have found the following qualitative rules: (1) Dopants that have a lower valence than the cation replaced in the host oxide (Li-doped MgO, La-doped ceria, etc.) tend to weaken the bonds of the oxygen atoms to the surface."
[3] "The XRD results of Ce0.98Pd0.02O2, Ce0.95Co0.05O2, and Ce0.95Ni0.05O2 are shown in Fig. 3. They all crystallize in the fluorite structure."
[4] "The XPS measurements indicate that Ru is ionic and is present in the surface region."
[5] "The most convincing proof that a doped oxide has been prepared is to show that the chemistry of the surface is different from that of other structures that might have been synthesized."

1. The presence of oxygen in the feed can harm the reaction by eliminating the oxygen vacancies.

2. Dopants with a lower valence than the replaced cation in the host oxide tend to weaken the bonds of the oxygen atoms to the surface.

3. The XRD patterns of Ce0.98Pd0.02O2, Ce0.95Co0.05O2, and Ce0.95Ni0.05O2 all indicate they crystallize in the fluorite structure.

4. Ru is found to be ionic and located in the surface region based on XPS measurements.

5. Demonstrating that the surface chemistry of a doped oxide is distinct from other possible structures serves as convincing proof of successful doping.
