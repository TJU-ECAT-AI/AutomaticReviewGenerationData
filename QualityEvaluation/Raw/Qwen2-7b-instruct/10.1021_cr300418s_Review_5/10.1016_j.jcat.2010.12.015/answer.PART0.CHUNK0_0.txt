[1] "A variety of temperature-programmed reaction measurements show that the catalyst made by the combustion method is more reducible than ceria."
[2] "In the past, we have used density functional calculations to try to classify the possible roles played by substitutional doping of oxides."
[3] "The addition of oxygen in the feed poisons the reaction by annihilating the oxygen vacancies."
[4] "There are by now many examples in which a very low dopant concentration modifies substantially the reactivity of an oxide (and by extension of a sulfide or a halide) catalyst, especially when the dopant has a tendency to segregate at the surface either because it has lower energy there or because its energy in the surface layer is lowered by interaction with the adsorbed molecules."

1. A range of temperature-programmed reaction tests demonstrate that the catalyst produced via combustion is more easily reduced than pure ceria.
2. We previously employed density functional theory computations to categorize the various functions exerted by the substitutional doping of oxides.
3. The inclusion of oxygen within the feed stream can sabotage the reaction by eliminating the oxygen vacancies.
4. Numerous instances currently exist where even a minute dopant concentration significantly alters the reactivity of oxide (and similarly, sulfide or halide) catalysts, particularly when the dopant tends to aggregate at the surface due to its lower energy presence or its reduced energy within the surface layer through interaction with adsorbed molecules.

1. 多种温度程序化反应测试表明，通过燃烧法制备的催化剂比纯氧化铈更易被还原。
2. 我们之前使用密度泛函理论计算来对氧化物中掺杂的可能作用进行了分类。
3. 添加到流体中的氧气可以破坏反应，因为它消除了氧空位。
4. 目前有许多例子显示，即使掺杂物浓度非常低，也能显著改变氧化物（同样适用于硫化物或卤化物）催化剂的活性，尤其是当掺杂物倾向于在表面聚集时，无论是因为它在那里具有更低的能量，还是因为吸附分子与其相互作用导致表面层中其能量降低。
