[1] "The addition of oxygen in the feed poisons the reaction by annihilating the oxygen vacancies."
[2] "In much of the literature on CO2 methanation, it is assumed (and sometimes proven) that the hydrogenation of CO2 consists of the reduction of CO2 to CO, followed by the conversion to alkanes by a FischerTropsch process."
[3] "Our electron microscopy and XRD measurements suggest that Ru is incorporated into the ceria lattice."
[4] "The XPS measurements indicate that Ru is ionic and is present in the surface region."
[5] "The DFT calculations show that Ce1xRuxO2 has the lowest energy when the Ru atoms are in the second Ce layer (of the CeO2(1 1 1) surface)."
[6] "Therefore, if the Ru atoms are close to being in chemical equilibrium, most of them are likely to be in the surface region."
[7] "Given the surface area and the number of surface sites and given the number of Ru atoms we add to the system, we conclude that many Ru atoms are in the bulk."
[8] "This is supported by the XRD measurements which show that Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 has the ceria structure with a modified lattice constant, which can only happen if a substantial fraction of the Ru atoms are in the bulk."

添加氧气在流体中会破坏反应，因为它消除了氧空位。在CO2甲烷化文献中的许多部分，人们假设CO2的氢化过程包括将CO2还原为CO，然后通过费希尔-特罗斯普希过程将碳氢化合物转化为烷烃。电子显微镜和X射线衍射测量表明，Ru被整合到铈氧化物晶格中。X射线光电子能谱（XPS）测量显示，Ru是离子性的，并且存在于表面区域。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，当Ru原子位于CeO2（1 1 1）表面的第二层时，Ce1xRuxO2具有最低的能量。如果Ru原子接近化学平衡状态，那么它们很可能大部分位于表面区域。考虑到表面积和表面位点的数量，可以得出结论，大量Ru原子位于内部，这得到了X射线衍射测量的支持，这些测量显示Ce0.95Ru0.05O2具有修改后的晶格常数。
