How does Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contribute to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts, particularly in terms of their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity, and what insights can it provide about the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility, as exemplified by studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania?

[1] "A variety of temperature-programmed reaction measurements show that the catalyst made by the combustion method is more reducible than ceria."
[2] "In the past, we have used density functional calculations to try to classify the possible roles played by substitutional doping of oxides."
[3] "The addition of oxygen in the feed poisons the reaction by annihilating the oxygen vacancies."
[4] "There are by now many examples in which a very low dopant concentration modifies substantially the reactivity of an oxide (and by extension of a sulfide or a halide) catalyst, especially when the dopant has a tendency to segregate at the surface either because it has lower energy there or because its energy in the surface layer is lowered by interaction with the adsorbed molecules."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

1. A range of temperature-programmed reaction tests demonstrate that the catalyst produced via combustion is more easily reduced than pure ceria.
2. We previously employed density functional theory computations to categorize the various functions exerted by the substitutional doping of oxides.
3. The inclusion of oxygen within the feed stream can sabotage the reaction by eliminating the oxygen vacancies.
4. Numerous instances currently exist where even a minute dopant concentration significantly alters the reactivity of oxide (and similarly, sulfide or halide) catalysts, particularly when the dopant tends to aggregate at the surface due to its lower energy presence or its reduced energy within the surface layer through interaction with adsorbed molecules.

2. 我们之前使用密度泛函理论计算来对氧化物中掺杂的可能作用进行了分类。
3. 添加到流体中的氧气可以破坏反应，因为它消除了氧空位。
4. 目前有许多例子显示，即使掺杂物浓度非常低，也能显著改变氧化物（同样适用于硫化物或卤化物）催化剂的活性，尤其是当掺杂物倾向于在表面聚集时，无论是因为它在那里具有更低的能量，还是因为吸附分子与其相互作用导致表面层中其能量降低。

[1] "The addition of oxygen in the feed poisons the reaction by annihilating the oxygen vacancies."
[2] "In much of the literature on CO2 methanation, it is assumed (and sometimes proven) that the hydrogenation of CO2 consists of the reduction of CO2 to CO, followed by the conversion to alkanes by a FischerTropsch process."
[3] "Our electron microscopy and XRD measurements suggest that Ru is incorporated into the ceria lattice."
[4] "The XPS measurements indicate that Ru is ionic and is present in the surface region."
[5] "The DFT calculations show that Ce1xRuxO2 has the lowest energy when the Ru atoms are in the second Ce layer (of the CeO2(1 1 1) surface)."
[6] "Therefore, if the Ru atoms are close to being in chemical equilibrium, most of them are likely to be in the surface region."
[7] "Given the surface area and the number of surface sites and given the number of Ru atoms we add to the system, we conclude that many Ru atoms are in the bulk."
[8] "This is supported by the XRD measurements which show that Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 has the ceria structure with a modified lattice constant, which can only happen if a substantial fraction of the Ru atoms are in the bulk."

添加氧气在流体中会破坏反应，因为它消除了氧空位。在CO2甲烷化文献中的许多部分，人们假设CO2的氢化过程包括将CO2还原为CO，然后通过费希尔-特罗斯普希过程将碳氢化合物转化为烷烃。电子显微镜和X射线衍射测量表明，Ru被整合到铈氧化物晶格中。X射线光电子能谱（XPS）测量显示，Ru是离子性的，并且存在于表面区域。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，当Ru原子位于CeO2（1 1 1）表面的第二层时，Ce1xRuxO2具有最低的能量。如果Ru原子接近化学平衡状态，那么它们很可能大部分位于表面区域。考虑到表面积和表面位点的数量，可以得出结论，大量Ru原子位于内部，这得到了X射线衍射测量的支持，这些测量显示Ce0.95Ru0.05O2具有修改后的晶格常数。

[1] "The addition of oxygen in the feed poisons the reaction by annihilating the oxygen vacancies."
[2] "We have found the following qualitative rules: (1) Dopants that have a lower valence than the cation replaced in the host oxide (Li-doped MgO, La-doped ceria, etc.) tend to weaken the bonds of the oxygen atoms to the surface."
[3] "The XRD results of Ce0.98Pd0.02O2, Ce0.95Co0.05O2, and Ce0.95Ni0.05O2 are shown in Fig. 3. They all crystallize in the fluorite structure."
[4] "The XPS measurements indicate that Ru is ionic and is present in the surface region."
[5] "The most convincing proof that a doped oxide has been prepared is to show that the chemistry of the surface is different from that of other structures that might have been synthesized."
