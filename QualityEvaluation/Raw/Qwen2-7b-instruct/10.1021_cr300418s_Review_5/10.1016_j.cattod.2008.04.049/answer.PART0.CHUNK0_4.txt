[1] "The combination of theoretical and experimental studies describes in a consistent way the effect of the alkali additives on the titania-supported vanadium oxide catalysts."
[2] "The alkali atoms bind to both vanadia units and support forming strong ionic bonds."
[3] "The vanadia/titania materials modified by alkali atoms possess a lower reducibility than the undoped catalyst."
[4] "The bridging oxygen VOTi is more reactive than the terminal oxygen of vanadyl group (V O)."
[5] "It determines a priori which can be an active site."
[6] "The reducibility of the vanadium oxide species decreases according to a sequence undoped > Li > Na > K."

The Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with theoretical modeling, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It provides insights into the composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity of these materials. Specifically, Raman spectroscopy elucidates the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility. By observing shifts in vibrational frequencies, one can deduce the weakening of bonds, like the vanadyl (V O) bond, indicating the effect of alkali additives. This helps identify active sites on the catalyst surface, as seen with the bridging oxygen VOTi being more reactive than the terminal oxygen of the vanadyl group. Moreover, the spectroscopic data aligns with the theoretical predictions, showing a decrease in reducibility as the alkali ion size increases in the sequence undoped > Li > Na > K. This comprehensive approach enhances our understanding of catalyst behavior and guides the design of more efficient catalysts.

拉曼光谱与理论模型相结合，对掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了重要贡献。它为这些材料的组成、结构、原位行为和活性提供了深入见解。特别是，通过观察振动频率的变化，可以推断出键的减弱，如V O键，从而揭示了碱金属添加剂的效果。这有助于识别催化剂表面的活性位点，因为桥接氧VOTi比范德酰基末端氧更为反应性。此外，光谱数据与理论预测相吻合，显示了随着碱离子大小的增加（顺序为未掺杂 > 锂 > 钠 > 钾），可还原性的降低。这种综合方法增强了我们对催化剂行为的理解，并指导了更高效催化剂的设计。
