<p>Vanadium oxide, as an active species, is present in most of the catalysts for selective oxidation of alkanes.</p>
<p>The molecular structure of supported vanadium oxides and oxide supports (e.g. TiO2) has been studied by different experimental techniques.</p>
<p>However, the role of alkali dopants on the structure and properties of supported vanadium oxide is not fully understood.</p>
<p>The present work aims to provide a molecular description of the structure and reactivity of the vanadium oxide catalysts supported on titanium oxide and the importance of alkali doping on their structure and reactivity by a combined theoretical and experi- mental studies.</p>
<p>The alkali atoms form a strong ionic bond with both the vanadium and the support units.</p>
<p>The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to V O bond.</p>
<p>It indicates a weakening of the V O double bond.</p>
<p>The experimental results obtained confirm the prediction of V O bond elongation by alkali promoters addition to the vanadia/ titania system described by modeling.</p>
<p>For the same VOTi (OB) site, the alkali-doped systems show a decrease of the first hydrogen adsorption energy in the order undoped (2.97 eV) > Li (2.70 eV) > Na (2.63 eV) > K (2.54 eV).</p>
<p>In view of these results, the catalyst doped with lithium is more reducible than doped with potassium.</p>
<p>The reducibility decreases in the sequence undoped >Li > Na > K.</p>
<p>All catalysts keep the same V/alkali ion atomic ratio.</p>
<p>The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system.</p>

1. Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. Specifically, it helps in identifying the nature of active sites and the changes in chemical bonds upon doping.

2. Insights gained through Raman spectroscopy can elucidate the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility. For example, shifts in vibration frequencies and bond lengths can indicate alterations in bond strength and reactivity.

3. Raman spectroscopy can also reveal the distribution and nature of dopants within the catalyst, offering information on how they interact with the matrix and influence the overall catalytic performance.
