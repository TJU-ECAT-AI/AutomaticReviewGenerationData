2. The Raman spectra of alkali-free and titania-supported vanadium oxide species are shown in Fig. 2. The Raman band at 1020 cm−1 corresponds to the vibration of the terminal vanadyl group (VO). The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to the VO bond. It indicates a weakening of the VO double bond.
3. The Raman spectra of dehydrated vanadia/titania catalysts without and with alkali promoter: (a) without promoter; (b) with Li; (c) with Na; (d) with K (bottom). Calculated Raman frequencies for the material with V/K = 2 atomic ratio (top).

The Raman spectroscopy provides information about the vibrational modes of the vanadyl group (VO) in the catalyst. The addition of alkali promoters causes a red shift in the Raman band frequency, indicating a weakening of the VO double bond. This change in the Raman spectrum correlates with the effect of alkali doping on the structure and reactivity of the catalyst.
