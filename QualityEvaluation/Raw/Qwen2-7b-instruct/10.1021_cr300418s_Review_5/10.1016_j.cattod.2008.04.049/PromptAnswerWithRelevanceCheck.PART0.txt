[3] "The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to V O bond."
[4] "The Raman band position of the vanadyl mode is extremely sensitive to the length of the bond."
[5] "The V O bond is lengthened from 1.615 A to 1.652 A with a movement of the corresponding Raman band toward minor energies."
[6] "Hydrogen atom is anchored to different oxygen sites in the model."

Raman spectroscopy, alongside other analytical techniques, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts, particularly in elucidating their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. By analyzing the shifts and intensities of specific vibrational bands, such as those associated with the vanadyl (V-O) group, researchers can gain insights into the effects of dopants on the catalyst's properties. In the context of alkali-doped vanadia on titania, the red shift in the vibration frequency of the V-O bond, indicating a weakening of the bond, is directly correlated with the introduction of alkali promoters. This weakening suggests a decrease in the reducibility of the catalyst, which aligns with the observed trends in hydrogen adsorption energies and experimental reducibility profiles. The findings highlight the close interaction between alkali additives and both the vanadia units and the support, influencing the catalyst's reactivity through alterations in bond strengths and reactivity patterns. The detailed analysis of spectral features provides a quantitative basis for understanding the complex interplay between dopant incorporation, catalyst structure, and its catalytic performance.

2. The Raman spectra of alkali-free and titania-supported vanadium oxide species are shown in Fig. 2. The Raman band at 1020 cm−1 corresponds to the vibration of the terminal vanadyl group (VO). The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to the VO bond. It indicates a weakening of the VO double bond.

The Raman spectroscopy, along with theoretical modeling, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It helps in identifying the composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity of these catalysts. Specifically, Raman spectroscopy can reveal details about the vibrational modes of different chemical bonds, providing insights into the bonding state of elements within the catalyst. The sensitivity of the Raman band position to the bond length allows for the detection of subtle changes caused by the addition of alkali metals.

The Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with theoretical modeling, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It provides insights into the composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity of these materials. Specifically, Raman spectroscopy elucidates the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility. By observing shifts in vibrational frequencies, one can deduce the weakening of bonds, like the vanadyl (V O) bond, indicating the effect of alkali additives. This helps identify active sites on the catalyst surface, as seen with the bridging oxygen VOTi being more reactive than the terminal oxygen of the vanadyl group. Moreover, the spectroscopic data aligns with the theoretical predictions, showing a decrease in reducibility as the alkali ion size increases in the sequence undoped > Li > Na > K. This comprehensive approach enhances our understanding of catalyst behavior and guides the design of more efficient catalysts.
