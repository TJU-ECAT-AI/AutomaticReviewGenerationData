The Raman spectroscopy, along with theoretical modeling, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It helps in identifying the composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity of these catalysts. Specifically, Raman spectroscopy can reveal details about the vibrational modes of different chemical bonds, providing insights into the bonding state of elements within the catalyst. The sensitivity of the Raman band position to the bond length allows for the detection of subtle changes caused by the addition of alkali metals. This method can also determine which oxygen sites are more reactive, indicating potential active sites for the catalyst. Additionally, the modeling techniques help correlate these spectral features with the catalyst's properties, such as reducibility, offering a deeper understanding of the role of alkali additives in modifying the catalyst's performance.
