[4] "Second, in some cases, the catalyst resists sintering better than the supported metallic particles [811]."
[5] "Finally, a catalytic center consisting of one ion is likely to be more sensitive to its environment than a metal cluster containing thousands of atoms; it is therefore more likely that its activity can be tuned by changing M and N."

The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that doped oxides could serve as effective oxidation catalysts. They offer advantages over traditional catalysts by requiring less metal and showing improved resistance against sintering. Additionally, a single ion-based catalytic center is more responsive to environmental changes, allowing for tuning of activity through modifications of the dopant and oxide materials.

密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，掺杂氧化物可以作为有效的氧化催化剂。它们在需要较少金属和表现出更好的抗烧结性方面优于传统催化剂。此外，一个基于单离子的催化中心对环境变化更为敏感，通过改变掺杂剂和氧化物材料可以调整其活性。
