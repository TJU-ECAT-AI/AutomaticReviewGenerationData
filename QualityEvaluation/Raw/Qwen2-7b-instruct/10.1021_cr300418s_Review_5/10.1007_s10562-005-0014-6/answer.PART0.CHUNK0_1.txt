[1] "We used density functional theory to examine whether doping oxides makes them better oxidation catalysts."
[2] "We studied in detail titania doped with Au and used CO oxidation as a test of the oxidizing power of the system."
[3] "Doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."
[4] "These calculations suggest that it is worthwhile to explore doped oxides as oxidation catalysts."

The Raman spectroscopy, combined with other analytical techniques, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It aids in identifying the catalyst's composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. Specifically, it provides insights into the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties, such as reducibility. For instance, studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania reveal how Raman spectroscopy elucidates the changes in the spectral features upon doping, which correlate with the catalyst's enhanced reactivity and reducibility.

拉曼光谱与其它分析技术结合，对掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了重大贡献。它有助于确定催化剂的组成、结构、原位行为以及活性。特别是，它提供了谱特征与催化剂属性（如还原性）之间的关系的见解。例如，在Ce掺杂CoCr2O4和碱金属掺杂氧化钛的研究中，拉曼光谱揭示了掺杂后谱特征的变化，这些变化与催化剂增强的活性和还原性相一致。
