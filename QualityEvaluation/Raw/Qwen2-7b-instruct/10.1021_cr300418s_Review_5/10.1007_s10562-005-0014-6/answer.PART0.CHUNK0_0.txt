[1] "Density functional theory (DFT) was used to examine whether doping oxides makes them better oxidation catalysts."
[2] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."
[3] "These calculations suggest that it is worthwhile to explore doped oxides as oxidation catalysts."
[4] "The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site."

The study uses density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the effect of doping oxides on their ability to function as oxidation catalysts. Doping with metals like Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni significantly weakens the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, making the doped oxides better at oxidation reactions. The researchers suggest that exploring doped oxides as potential oxidation catalysts could be worthwhile due to their enhanced catalytic properties. The effectiveness of the doping is attributed to the weakening of the oxygen-oxide bond and the increased reactivity of oxygen vacancies and adsorbed molecules at these sites.

研究使用密度泛函理论（DFT）来探讨掺杂氧化物对其作为氧化催化剂性能的影响。Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni等金属的掺杂显著减弱了表面氧与氧化物之间的键合，使掺杂的氧化物在氧化反应中表现出更好的催化性能。研究者建议探索掺杂氧化物作为潜在氧化催化剂的可能性是值得的，因为它们具有增强的催化特性。掺杂的有效性归因于削弱氧-氧化物键以及氧空位及其吸附分子在这些位置的活性增加。
