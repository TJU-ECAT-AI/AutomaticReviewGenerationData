<p>Our results suggest that the Au-doped TiO2 is a stronger oxidant than the pure oxide or the one with a neutral Au cluster on it.</p>
<p>On the AuxTi1xO2(110), CO binds most strongly to the oxygen atoms most weakened by the presence of gold, and forms an adsorbed CO2 molecule.</p>
<p>After the surface oxygen 1 is removed, the surface oxygen 2 can react with CO, to form a CO2 molecule, which desorbs from the surface, leaving behind a second bridging-oxygen vacancy.</p>
<p>One may presume that a dopant that makes it very easy to remove oxygen, will slow down the annihilation of the oxygen vacancy.</p>
<p>It is well known that density functional theory does not describe correctly the electronic structure of transition metal and rare-earth oxides.</p>

The study demonstrates that doping oxides, specifically titanium dioxide (TiO2), with gold (Au) significantly enhances their oxidizing capabilities. Gold doping weakens the bond between surface oxygen atoms and the oxide, making the system more reactive towards oxidation. Carbon monoxide (CO) binds most strongly to the oxygen atoms that are most affected by gold presence, leading to the formation of an adsorbed CO2 molecule. Further, the removal of surface oxygen atoms facilitates the conversion of the ion to a neutral Au atom, suggesting a mechanism for the stability of the catalyst. The study also cautions about the limitations of density functional theory (DFT) in accurately describing the electronic structure of transition metal oxides, particularly regarding the self-interaction error in DFT calculations.

研究显示，通过在氧化物（特别是二氧化钛）中掺入金（Au），可以显著提高它们的氧化能力。金掺杂削弱了表面氧原子与氧化物之间的键合，使系统更易于进行氧化反应。一氧化碳（CO）最强烈地结合到受金影响最大的氧原子上，形成吸附的CO2分子。进一步，表面氧原子的去除有助于将离子转化为中性Au原子，表明催化剂稳定性的机制。研究还对密度泛函理论（DFT）在准确描述过渡金属氧化物电子结构时的局限性发出警告，特别是关于DFT计算中的自相互作用误差对于描述这类化合物的性质的影响。
