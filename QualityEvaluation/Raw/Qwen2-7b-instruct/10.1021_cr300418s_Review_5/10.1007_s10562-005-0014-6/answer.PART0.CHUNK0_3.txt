The density functional theory (DFT) was applied to investigate if doping oxides enhances their performance as oxidation catalysts. Specifically, the CO oxidation on doped titania surfaces was analyzed to assess their catalytic power. The findings revealed that doping with metals such as Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni significantly weakens the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide, thereby improving the system's oxidizing capability. These computational results imply that doped oxides could be a valuable class of oxidation catalysts worth exploring experimentally.

密度泛函理论（DFT）被用来研究掺杂氧化物是否能使其成为更好的氧化催化剂。具体地，对掺金钛酸盐表面的CO氧化进行了分析，以评估系统的催化能力。发现用Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni等金属掺杂能够显著减弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键合，从而提高系统的氧化能力。这些计算结果表明，掺杂氧化物可能是值得通过实验探索的一类有效的氧化催化剂。
