1. The bond between the oxygen atoms and the oxide is weakened by the presence of dopants such as Au, Ag, and Cu on the CeO2(111) surface according to density functional theory calculations.
2. Doping CeO2 with Au enables the oxide to readily react with CO and form carbonates during CO oxidation.
3. The oxygen vacancy created during the oxidation process adsorbs oxygen from the gas, weakens its bond, and reacts with CO to form a carbonate, which then decomposes to release CO2 and heal the oxygen vacancy.
4. Au supported on various oxides is known to be a good low-temperature CO oxidation catalyst.
5. The study uses density functional theory calculations to investigate CO oxidation by the Au-doped CeO2(111) surface and compares its activity with the pure oxide surface.

1. 根据密度泛函理论计算，CeO2(111)表面掺杂Au、Ag和Cu会使氧原子与氧化物之间的键变弱。
2. CeO2掺杂Au后，氧化物能够容易地与CO反应并生成碳酸盐。
3. 氧空位在氧化过程中生成，吸附气体中的氧，减弱其键合，然后与CO反应形成碳酸盐，该碳酸盐分解释放CO2并修复氧空位。
4. Au支持在各种氧化物上是低温CO氧化反应的良好催化剂。
5. 本研究使用密度泛函理论计算来研究CeO2(111)表面掺杂Au的CO氧化，并将其活性与纯氧化物表面进行比较。
