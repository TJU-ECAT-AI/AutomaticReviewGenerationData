1. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the bond between the oxygen atoms and the oxide in CeO2(111) is weakened by the presence of dopants like Au, Ag, and Cu. This makes the surface oxygen more reactive and lowers the temperature at which the oxide is reduced.
2. The calculations indicate that the dopant modifies the surface properties of the oxide, leading to increased reactivity and reduced activation temperatures.
3. The impact of doping on the oxide surface can be observed by analyzing the distances between the oxygen atoms and the dopant, as well as the oxygen atoms and the host oxide atoms.
4. The distances between the oxygen atoms and the dopant in compounds like Au2O3, Ag2O, and Cu oxides (CuO and CuO2) vary significantly compared to the distances in the doped ceria system.
5. In doped ceria, the distances between the dopant and the oxygen atoms are notably larger than those in the dopant's own oxide, indicating structural changes due to doping.

1. 密度泛函理论计算表明，CeO2(111)表面掺杂Au、Ag和Cu时，氧原子与氧化物之间的键被掺杂剂削弱。这使得表面氧更具反应性，并降低了氧化物的还原温度。
2. 计算结果显示，掺杂剂修改了氧化物表面的性质，导致增加反应性和降低激活温度。
3. 分析氧原子与掺杂剂及宿主氧化物原子之间的距离可以观察到掺杂对氧化物表面的影响。
4. Au2O3、Ag2O以及Cu氧化物（CuO和CuO2）中氧原子与掺杂剂之间的距离与掺杂铈氧化物系统中的距离显著不同。
5. 在掺杂铈氧化物中，掺杂剂与氧原子之间的距离明显大于其自身氧化物中的距离，表明由于掺杂引起的结构变化。
