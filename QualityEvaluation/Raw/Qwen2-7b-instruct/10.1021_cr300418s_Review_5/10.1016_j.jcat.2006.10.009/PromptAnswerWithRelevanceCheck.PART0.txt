<p>It is well known that small gold clusters supported on various oxides catalyze the water-gas shift reaction at low temperature [115]. In a series of remarkable papers Fu, Deng, Salzburg,and Flytzani-Stephanopoulos [10,1315] proposed that the cat- alytic activity in this system is due to gold ions and not to the neutral gold clusters.</p>
<p>Subsequent work [16] concluded that catalysis is performed by neutral gold;at present, the active site in this system is unclear.</p>
<p>Au supported on a various oxides is a good low-temperature CO oxidation catalyst [1733]. Cormas group [3436] has shown that the activity of Au supported on ceria increases with increasing Au3+-to-Au0 ratio.</p>
<p>The presence of Au3+ was inferred from the vibrational frequency of CO adsorbed on the catalyst; that of CO adsorbed on Au3+ differs from that of CO adsorbed on Au0.</p>
<p>Venezia et al. [37] have used several meth- ods for preparing a gold/ceria catalyst and have shown that the samples with no Au0 had the highest activity for CO oxidation;100% conversion was reached at lower temperatures than those used for the samples containing Au0.</p>
<p>Recently Zhang et al. [38] prepared a Au/ZrO2 catalyst and dissolved the neutral Au clusters in KCN. XPS measurements indicated that after dissolution, the sample contained Au3+.</p>
<p>This catalyst is very active and selective for partial hydrogena- tion of butadiene.</p>
<p>In the articles mentioned above, the nature of the active cen- ter was not established with certainty.</p>
<p>We have proposed [39] that the active Au species is a gold atom that substitutes one of the cations in the host oxide and suggested that such sub- stitution is a general method for modifying the reactivity of oxide-based catalysts.</p>
<p>In all of these systems, the doped oxide is a better catalyst than the pure oxide.</p>
<p>A group in Japan [5053] has shown that several doped per- ovskites are good automotive catalysts; in particular, LaPdx- Fe1xO3 is a better catalyst than Pd supported on alumina.</p>
<p>However, doping does not always improve catalytic ac- tivity. Zhao and Gorte [54] have shown that Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9, Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9, La0.2Ce0.8O1.9, Nb0.1Ce0.9O2.05, and Ta0.1- Ce0.9O2.05 have lower activity for n-butane oxidation than ce- ria.</p>
<p>Wilkes et al. [55] showed that the rate of CO oxidation by ceria doped with La, Pr, Gd, or Nb is lower than the rate of oxidation by pure ceria by a factor of 35.</p>
<p>Exploratory calculations (V. Shapovalov and H. Metiu, unpublished data), including the on-site Coulomb repulsion (DFT + U), do not change the con- clusions reached here.</p>
<p>To test the convergence of the calculations with respect to the slab thickness, we computed the surface energies for slabs hav- ing 6, 9, and 12 atomic layers. The surface energies were 1.66,
1.66, and 1.64 eV per CeO2 formula unit, respectively.</p>
<p>The composition of the slab used in our calculations was Ce18O36 or Au1Ce17O36, corresponding to the approximate sto- ichiometric formula Au0.06Ce0.94O2 or, equivalently, atomic % Au = 5.6 (i.e., 1 × 100/18).</p>
<p>The reaction energy differences reported here are the ener- gies of the products minus the energies of the reactants; a neg- ative reaction energy corresponds to an exothermic process.</p>
<p>In this section we examine the sequence of events that fol- low the reaction of a CO molecule with an oxygen atom nearest to Au.</p>
<p>On the AuxCe1xO2(111) surface, we find that CO re- acts with two oxygen atoms neighboring the Au dopant to form the carbonate shown in Fig. 3b.</p>
<p>This carbonate is formed by binding the carbon atom to the Ot,Au (atom 1) and Ob,Au (atom 2).</p>
<p>The bridging carbonate, formed by adsorbing CO on doped ceria, is rather stable; it takes 0.91 eV to remove CO2 from the carbonate into the gas phase and leave behind an oxygen va- cancy.</p>
<p>The vacancy formed by the decomposition of the second carbonate adsorbs an oxygen molecule from the gas phase (Fig. 3e), with an exothermicity of 0.91 eV.</p>
<p>The bond length of the adsorbed molecule is longer than that of gas-phase O2,indicating that the πorbital of O2 is populated and the bond in O2 is weakened.</p>
<p>The system returns to the state shown in Fig. 3b.</p>
<p>To determine on which sites a CO molecule will form a carbonate, we check which two oxygen atoms on the surface are separated by a distance that is close to the distance by which they would be separated in a carbonate.</p>
<p>There are three such oxygen-atom pairs: (3,4), (3,5), and (3,6)</p>
<p>We found that the CO does not form a carbonate with the last two pairs.</p>
<p>We have also performed calculations to determine the activ- ity of oxygen atoms located outside the first coordination shell of the dopant.</p>
<p>The oxygen atoms 1 and 2 (Fig. 4a) react with CO to form a bidentate carbonate (Fig. 4b).</p>
<p>This reaction is exothermic by 2.22 eV and creates an oxy- gen vacancy by pulling the oxygen atom 2 out of its place; the location of the vacancy is shown by the dotted line.</p>
<p>Any surface modification that facilitates vacancy formation is likely to facilitate formation of the carbonate.</p>
<p>The carbonate decomposes by releasing CO2 in the gas phase and leaving behind an oxygen vacancy (Fig. 5c).</p>
<p>An O2 molecule binds strongly to the vacancy (Fig. 5d), with an exothermicity of 2.73 eV.</p>
<p>The adsorbed oxygen molecule is weakened by the electron-rich environment at the vacancy site and reacts with CO to form a bridging carbonate (Fig. 5e) and release 3.38 eV of energy.</p>
<p>The reaction energy differences reported here are the ener- gies of the products minus the energies of the reactants; a neg- ative reaction energy corresponds to an exothermic process.</p>
<p>In Au2O3 the distances between the oxygen atoms and Au vary between 1.93 and 2.07 Å, the OAg distance in Ag2O is 2.05 Å and the OCu in the Cu oxides (CuO and CuO2) vary between 1.82 and 2.00 Å.</p>
<p>The dopantoxygen distance in doped ceria is much larger than the distance between the dopant and the oxygen in the dopants own oxide.</p>
<p>There is also a small symmetry breaking among the bottom oxygen atoms.</p>
<p>The oxygencerium distances are disturbed substantially only in the CuxCe1xO2 compound.</p>
<p>The distances between the oxygen atoms O1 to O6 and the dopant or the cerium atoms they bind to, in Å are given in Table 1.</p>
<p>Table 2 gives the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at the surface of ceria doped with Au, Ag, and Cu.</p>

<p>Evac is the energy needed to form one oxygen vacancy and half and oxygen molecule in the gas phase.</p>
<p>Several observations by Bera et al. [40] are consistent with our results.</p>
<p>They found that the concentration of the Cu atoms at the surface of CuxCe1xO2 is four to six times higher that what would be derived by assuming that the Cu atoms initially introduced in the system take surface or bulk sites with equal probability.</p>
<p>Finally, their temperature- programmed reduction (TPR) measurements indicated that Cu- doped ceria oxidizes hydrogen at lower temperature than CuO or ceria.</p>

1. The literature discusses the catalytic activity of doped oxides, particularly in CO oxidation and the water-gas shift reaction. It highlights the role of gold ions, rather than neutral gold clusters, in certain systems. The activity of doped oxides, especially those containing gold, is influenced by the ratio of Au3+ to Au0. Higher activity is observed with increasing Au3+-to-Au0 ratio, suggesting that the active site in these systems is related to the Au3+ species.

2. Raman spectroscopy, alongside other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It enables the identification of dopant species, their distribution, and interactions with the host oxide. Spectral features can correlate with properties such as reducibility, indicating how the presence of dopants affects the catalyst's ability to reduce or oxidize reactants. For instance, studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania could reveal changes in spectral patterns that reflect the introduction of dopants and their impact on the catalyst's performance.

3. Doped oxides can exhibit improved thermal stability, particularly when compared to unsupported metals or other doped systems. This enhanced stability may contribute to their utility in applications requiring high operating temperatures, such as automotive catalysis. The literature suggests that doping strategies can be employed to modify the reactivity of oxide-based catalysts, potentially leading to catalysts that are more selective and efficient in various oxidation reactions.

4. Doping oxides with different metals, such as Au, Ag, and Cu, can lead to variations in the chemical reactivity of the surface oxygen atoms. The weakening of the bond between the oxide and oxygen atoms by the dopant facilitates the oxidation of gases like CO, leading to the formation of carbonates that decompose to release CO2. This process demonstrates how doping can enhance the oxidative power of the host oxide, enabling more efficient catalytic cycles.

5. The literature indicates that the stability of doped oxides under reaction conditions can be influenced by the dopant itself. Some dopants, like Cu, may undergo reduction under certain conditions, potentially affecting the catalyst's activity and stability. The recovery of the original catalyst state upon exposure to oxygen at high temperatures suggests that the reduced state may not always lead to irreversible degradation, offering opportunities for reversible catalytic cycles.

1. 文献讨论了掺杂氧化物在CO氧化和水气转换反应中的催化活性。它强调了在某些系统中金离子而不是中性金簇作为催化活性中心的作用。掺杂氧化物，尤其是含有金的那些，其活性受到Au3+与Au0比例的影响。随着Au3+-to-Au0比例的增加，观察到更高的活性，表明这些系统的活性位点与Au3+物种有关。

2. 罗曼光谱与其他分析技术一起，对掺杂催化剂进行全面表征，提供对其组成、结构、原位行为和活性的见解。它可以识别掺杂剂物种、它们的分布及其与主体氧化物的相互作用。光谱特征可以与可还原性等属性相关联，反映掺杂剂的存在如何影响催化剂对还原或氧化反应物的能力。例如，对于Ce-doped CoCr2O4和碱金属掺杂的钛酸盐，可以揭示光谱模式的变化，反映出掺杂剂的引入及其对催化剂性能的影响。

3. 掺杂氧化物可能表现出改进的热稳定性，特别是在与未掺杂金属或其他掺杂系统相比时。这种增强的稳定性可能使其在需要高温操作的应用中具有实用性，如汽车催化。文献表明，通过掺杂策略可以修改氧化物基催化剂的活性，这可能导致更选择性和高效的氧化反应催化剂。

4. 向氧化物中掺杂不同的金属，如Au、Ag和Cu，可以使表面氧原子的化学活性发生变化。掺杂剂削弱了氧化物与氧原子之间的键，促进了气体如CO的氧化，导致碳酸盐的形成，这些碳酸盐分解释放CO2。这一过程展示了掺杂如何增强主体氧化物的氧化能力，使催化循环更加有效。

5. 文献表明，掺杂氧化物在反应条件下的稳定性可能会受到掺杂剂本身的影响。一些掺杂剂，如Cu，在特定条件下可能经历还原，可能会影响催化剂的活性和稳定性。在高温度下暴露于氧气后恢复原始催化剂状态的实验揭示，还原状态并不总是不可逆的降解，为可逆催化循环提供了机会。

The literature discusses the use of doped oxides, specifically focusing on the catalytic activity of ceria doped with gold for the oxidation of carbon monoxide. It mentions that gold ions, not neutral gold clusters, are responsible for the catalytic activity in the water-gas shift reaction. The activity of gold supported on ceria increases with the ratio of Au3+ to Au0. The authors propose that the active gold species is a gold atom substituting a cation in the host oxide, suggesting a general method for modifying the reactivity of oxide-based catalysts. Additionally, the text highlights that doping can sometimes improve catalytic activity, as demonstrated with doped perovskites being better automotive catalysts compared to palladium supported on alumina. However, the text also notes that doping does not always improve activity, with certain compounds having lower activity for n-butane oxidation than ceria. The study of doped titanium dioxide using density functional theory reveals that gold dopants weaken the bond between surface oxygen atoms and the doped oxide, making it more reactive. This leads to the formation of a CO2 molecule, an oxygen vacancy, and a carbonate, which decomposes easily to produce CO2 and heal the oxygen vacancy. The text also compares the effect of doping with gold, copper, silver, nickel, palladium, or platinum on weakening the oxygen bond to the surface, noting that gold has a lesser effect compared to these other metals.

文献主要讨论了掺杂氧化物的应用，特别是针对二氧化碳氧化的铈基氧化物掺金催化剂。它提到在水煤气变换反应中，催化活性来源于金离子而非中性金簇。在铈基氧化物上添加金的活性随三价金与零价金的比例增加而提高。作者提出，活性金物种是一种取代宿主氧化物中阳离子的金原子，并建议这种取代是修改氧化物基催化剂活性的一种普遍方法。此外，文本指出掺杂有时可以提高催化活性，例如掺杂的钙钛矿是比铝酸钯更好的汽车催化剂。然而，文本也指出掺杂并不总是能提高活性，某些化合物对异丁烷的氧化活性低于铈。使用密度泛函理论研究掺金二氧化钛显示，金掺杂剂削弱了表面氧原子与掺杂氧化物之间的键，使其更活跃。这导致二氧化碳分子、氧空位和碳酸盐的形成，后者很容易分解产生二氧化碳并修复氧空位。文本还比较了掺入金、铜、银、镍、钯或铂对减弱表面氧键的影响，指出与这些其他金属相比，金的影响较小。

The document explains that when ceria is doped with metals like Au, Ag, and Cu, the bond between the oxygen atoms and the oxide is weakened. This makes the oxygen atoms more reactive. Specifically, the doped oxygen atoms react with CO to form CO2, which readily desorbs. The removal of an oxygen atom creates an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy then adsorbs an oxygen molecule from the gas phase, which reacts with CO to form a carbonate. The carbonate decomposes easily, producing CO2 and healing the oxygen vacancy. The two critical steps in the oxidation reaction are the removal of an oxygen atom to form an oxygen vacancy and the reaction of this vacancy with gas-phase oxygen to prevent the complete reduction of the oxides.

文档说明，当铈氧化物掺杂有Au、Ag和Cu等金属时，氧原子与氧化物之间的键会被削弱。这使得氧原子更加活跃。具体来说，掺杂的氧原子会与CO反应生成CO2，该产物能够容易地脱附。氧原子的去除形成一个氧空位。这个空位会吸附气体中的氧分子，该氧分子与CO反应形成碳酸盐。碳酸盐很容易分解，产生CO2并修复氧空位。氧化反应的两个关键步骤是通过还原剂移除氧原子以形成氧空位，以及这个空位与气体中的氧分子反应来防止氧化物完全被还原。
