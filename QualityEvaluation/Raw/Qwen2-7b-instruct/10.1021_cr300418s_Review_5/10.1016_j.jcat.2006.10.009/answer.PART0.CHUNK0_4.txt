[1] "Density functional theory calculations for the CeO2(111) surface doped with Au, Ag, and Cu show that the bond between the oxygen atoms and the oxide is weakened by presence of the dopant."

The document explains that when ceria is doped with metals like Au, Ag, and Cu, the bond between the oxygen atoms and the oxide is weakened. This makes the oxygen atoms more reactive. Specifically, the doped oxygen atoms react with CO to form CO2, which readily desorbs. The removal of an oxygen atom creates an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy then adsorbs an oxygen molecule from the gas phase, which reacts with CO to form a carbonate. The carbonate decomposes easily, producing CO2 and healing the oxygen vacancy. The two critical steps in the oxidation reaction are the removal of an oxygen atom to form an oxygen vacancy and the reaction of this vacancy with gas-phase oxygen to prevent the complete reduction of the oxides.

文档说明，当铈氧化物掺杂有Au、Ag和Cu等金属时，氧原子与氧化物之间的键会被削弱。这使得氧原子更加活跃。具体来说，掺杂的氧原子会与CO反应生成CO2，该产物能够容易地脱附。氧原子的去除形成一个氧空位。这个空位会吸附气体中的氧分子，该氧分子与CO反应形成碳酸盐。碳酸盐很容易分解，产生CO2并修复氧空位。氧化反应的两个关键步骤是通过还原剂移除氧原子以形成氧空位，以及这个空位与气体中的氧分子反应来防止氧化物完全被还原。
