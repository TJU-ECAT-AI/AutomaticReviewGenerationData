<p>It is well known that small gold clusters supported on various oxides catalyze the water-gas shift reaction at low temperature [115]. In a series of remarkable papers Fu, Deng, Salzburg,and Flytzani-Stephanopoulos [10,1315] proposed that the cat- alytic activity in this system is due to gold ions and not to the neutral gold clusters.</p>
<p>Au supported on a various oxides is a good low-temperature CO oxidation catalyst [1733]. Cormas group [3436] has shown that the activity of Au supported on ceria increases with increasing Au3+-to-Au0 ratio. The presence of Au3+ was in- ferred from the vibrational frequency of CO adsorbed on the catalyst; that of CO adsorbed on Au3+ differs from that of CO adsorbed on Au0.</p>
<p>In the articles mentioned above, the nature of the active cen- ter was not established with certainty. We have proposed [39] that the active Au species is a gold atom that substitutes one of the cations in the host oxide and suggested that such sub- stitution is a general method for modifying the reactivity of oxide-based catalysts.</p>
<p>A group in Japan [5053] has shown that several doped per- ovskites are good automotive catalysts; in particular, LaPdx- Fe1xO3 is a better catalyst than Pd supported on alumina.</p>
<p>However, doping does not always improve catalytic ac- tivity. Zhao and Gorte [54] have shown that Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9, Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9, La0.2Ce0.8O1.9, Nb0.1Ce0.9O2.05, and Ta0.1- Ce0.9O2.05 have lower activity for n-butane oxidation than ce- ria.</p>
<p>Previously, we used density functional theory (DFT) to study CO oxidation by AuxTi1xO2 [39] and found the following:(1) The gold dopant prefers to substitute a five-coordinated Ti atom on the surface rather than go into the bulk; (2) the dopant weakens the bond between the surface oxygen atoms and the doped oxide, making it more reactive; (3) these oxygen atoms react with gas-phase CO to form a CO2 molecule that read- ies desorbs; (4) the oxygen vacancy created by CO2 removal adsorbs an oxygen molecule that reacts with CO to form a car- bonate; (5) the carbonate decomposes easily to produce gaseous CO2 and heal the oxygen vacancy; and (6) doping with Cu, Ag, Ni, Pd, or Pt weakens the oxygen bond to the surface more than doping with Au.</p>

The literature discusses the use of doped oxides, specifically focusing on the catalytic activity of ceria doped with gold for the oxidation of carbon monoxide. It mentions that gold ions, not neutral gold clusters, are responsible for the catalytic activity in the water-gas shift reaction. The activity of gold supported on ceria increases with the ratio of Au3+ to Au0. The authors propose that the active gold species is a gold atom substituting a cation in the host oxide, suggesting a general method for modifying the reactivity of oxide-based catalysts. Additionally, the text highlights that doping can sometimes improve catalytic activity, as demonstrated with doped perovskites being better automotive catalysts compared to palladium supported on alumina. However, the text also notes that doping does not always improve activity, with certain compounds having lower activity for n-butane oxidation than ceria. The study of doped titanium dioxide using density functional theory reveals that gold dopants weaken the bond between surface oxygen atoms and the doped oxide, making it more reactive. This leads to the formation of a CO2 molecule, an oxygen vacancy, and a carbonate, which decomposes easily to produce CO2 and heal the oxygen vacancy. The text also compares the effect of doping with gold, copper, silver, nickel, palladium, or platinum on weakening the oxygen bond to the surface, noting that gold has a lesser effect compared to these other metals.

文献主要讨论了掺杂氧化物的应用，特别是针对二氧化碳氧化的铈基氧化物掺金催化剂。它提到在水煤气变换反应中，催化活性来源于金离子而非中性金簇。在铈基氧化物上添加金的活性随三价金与零价金的比例增加而提高。作者提出，活性金物种是一种取代宿主氧化物中阳离子的金原子，并建议这种取代是修改氧化物基催化剂活性的一种普遍方法。此外，文本指出掺杂有时可以提高催化活性，例如掺杂的钙钛矿是比铝酸钯更好的汽车催化剂。然而，文本也指出掺杂并不总是能提高活性，某些化合物对异丁烷的氧化活性低于铈。使用密度泛函理论研究掺金二氧化钛显示，金掺杂剂削弱了表面氧原子与掺杂氧化物之间的键，使其更活跃。这导致二氧化碳分子、氧空位和碳酸盐的形成，后者很容易分解产生二氧化碳并修复氧空位。文本还比较了掺入金、铜、银、镍、钯或铂对减弱表面氧键的影响，指出与这些其他金属相比，金的影响较小。
