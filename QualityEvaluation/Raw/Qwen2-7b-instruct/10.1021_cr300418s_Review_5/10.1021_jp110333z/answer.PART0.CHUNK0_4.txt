[1] "The goal of these calculations is to document several aspects of the chemistry of oxides doped substitutionally with dopants whose valence is lower by one than the valence of the cation they substitute (LVD1)."
[2] "First, we extrapolate numerous computations (by us and by others) and propose that all LVD1 dopants substantially activate the oxygen atoms at the surface of any doped oxide."
[3] "To probe the change in oxygen activity caused by the dopant, we used the energy ΔEv of making an oxygen vacancy, the energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 to bind a H atom or a CH3 radical to an oxygen atom in the surface layer, and the energy ΔECH4 of the dissociative adsorption of methane to form a hydroxyl and a methoxide."
[4] "Second, we extrapolate the present calculations to postulate that the adsorption of an electron donor (H or CH3, in the examples given here) on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD1 counteracts the effect of the dopant."
[5] "We are tempted to think that all LVDs have the ability to induce long-range modifications in the chemistry of the oxygen atoms on the surface, but we have not performed calculations that would back up this guess."

The document outlines the use of density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the chemistry of oxides doped with cations having a lower valence than the host. It documents two key rules: the presence of a dopant enhances the oxide's oxidizing capability, and adsorbing an electron donor on the surface mitigates the dopant's effect. The document further posits that doping with low valence dopants (LVDs) generally activates the surface oxygen atoms, making them more reactive. It also suggests that adsorbing an electron donor onto a surface doped with an LVD can counteract the dopant's influence, a phenomenon termed the chemical compensation effect. The document hints at the possibility that all LVDs might induce long-range modifications in the surface oxygen chemistry but lacks supporting calculations to confirm this assumption. The findings imply complexities in reactions catalyzed by LVD-doped oxides, particularly concerning the formation of electron-donating adsorbates, which could lower the catalyst's activity due to the chemical compensation effect.

本文利用密度泛函理论（DFT）研究了取代掺杂氧化物中电荷电荷低于宿主电荷的离子的化学性质。它记录了两条规则：掺杂剂的存在使氧化物的氧化能力增强，吸附电子供体在表面上可以抵消掺杂剂的影响。该文档进一步推测，掺杂低电荷掺杂剂（LVD）通常激活表面氧原子，使其更活跃。它还提出了一个假设，即所有LVD都可能在表面氧化学上诱导长程修改，但缺乏支持性计算来验证这一假设。发现指出，LVD掺杂氧化物催化反应中形成电子供体吸附物的复杂性，这可能导致催化剂活性降低，由于化学补偿效应。
