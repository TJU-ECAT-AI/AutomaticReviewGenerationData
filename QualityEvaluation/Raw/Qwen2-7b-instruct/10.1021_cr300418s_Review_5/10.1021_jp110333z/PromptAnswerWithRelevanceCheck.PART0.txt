[1] "We document two rules. (1) The presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant. (2) Adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts strongly the effect of the dopant."
[2] "The calculations presented here also show that when a H atom or a CH3 radical are adsorbed on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD, the chemistry of the surface becomes very similar to that of the undoped oxide."
[3] "We have explained that the long-range effect of the dopant or of the compensating H atom occurs because a delocalized orbital, involving the atomic orbitals of the surface oxygen atoms, is filled or empty."
[4] "The reason for this chemical compensation effect can be understood as follows: having a lower valence than the cation it substitutes, an LVD creates a deficit of electrons in the surface. The oxygen atoms, which are very electrophilic, no longer bind as strongly to the doped surface and are therefore more inclined to react with adsorbates."
[5] "We have explained that the long-range effect of the dopant or of the compensating H atom occurs because a delocalized orbital, involving the atomic orbitals of the surface oxygen atoms, is filled or empty."
[6] "The compensation effect leads to a similar coadsorption behavior. Let us look, for illustration, at the dissociative adsorption of CH4 on LaCeO2."

1. Two rules are stated: the presence of the dopant enhances the oxidant capability of the oxide, and adsorbing an electron donor on the surface mitigates the dopant's effect.

2. When a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical is adsorbed on the surface of an oxide doped with a low valence dopant, the surface chemistry becomes akin to that of the undoped oxide.

3. The long-range effect of the dopant or compensating hydrogen atom is attributed to the filling or emptying of a delocalized orbital that involves the atomic orbitals of the surface oxygen atoms.

4. An LVD creates an electron deficit in the surface due to its lower valence compared to the substituted cation. Oxygen atoms, being electrophilic, bind less strongly to the doped surface, making them more reactive. Adsorbing an electron donor compensates this deficit.

5. The long-range effect of the dopant or compensating hydrogen atom is explained by the modification of the electronic structure involving the delocalized orbital of the surface oxygen atoms.

6. When considering the dissociative adsorption of methane on LaCeO2, the presence of a compensating agent leads to a repulsive behavior between the fragments of the dissociated methane, stabilizing the final state on the surface.

1. 我们记录了两条规则：掺杂剂的存在使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。吸附电子供体到表面可以强烈抵消掺杂剂的作用。

2. 当氢原子或甲基基团吸附在低价掺杂剂掺杂的氧化物的表面上时，表面化学性质会类似于未掺杂的氧化物。

3. 掺杂剂或补偿氢原子的远距离效应归因于涉及表面氧原子原子轨道的离域轨道的填充或空缺。

4. 由于其较低的电荷数与替代阳离子相比，低价掺杂剂在表面产生电子缺陷。由于氧原子的强亲电性，它们不再紧密地结合到掺杂的表面上，因此更容易与吸附剂反应。吸附电子供体可以补偿这个缺陷。

5. 通过修改涉及表面氧原子原子轨道的电子结构，解释了掺杂剂或补偿氢原子的远距离效应。

[1] "The goal of these calculations is to document several aspects of the chemistry of oxides doped substitutionally with dopants whose valence is lower by one than the valence of the cation they substitute (LVD1)."
[2] "First, we extrapolate numerous computations (by us and by others) and propose that all LVD1 dopants substantially activate the oxygen atoms at the surface of any doped oxide."
[3] "Second, we extrapolate the present calculations to postulate that the adsorption of an electron donor (H or CH3, in the examples given here) on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD1 counteracts the effect of the dopant."
[4] "The reason for this chemical compensation effect can be understood as follows: having a lower valence than the cation it substitutes, an LVD creates a deficit of electrons in the surface. The oxygen atoms, which are very electrophilic, no longer bind as strongly to the doped surface and are therefore more inclined to react with adsorbates."
[5] "Adsorbing an electron donor on the doped oxide heals (in full or in part) the electron deficit, increasing the strength of the oxygen bond to the oxide and making it less reactive."
[6] "This crude picture is reinforced by the analysis of the partial density of states for all the systems studied here. The presence of an LVD on the surface produces a partially filled orbital in the valence band and the adsorption of a compensating electron donor fills this orbital, making the density of states of the compensated surface very similar to that of the undoped oxide."
[7] "In the case of LaCeO2 the molecular orbital in question is delocalized and consists mainly of oxygen atomic orbitals. This is why doping with La equally affects the reactivity of all oxygen atoms in the supercell used for calculations."
[8] "We are tempted to think that all LVDs have the ability to induce long-range modifications in the chemistry of the oxygen atoms on the surface, but we have not performed calculations that would back up this guess."
[9] "We conclude this section by discussing the implications that our findings have for catalysis by oxides doped with LVD1s."
[10] "The compensation effect proposed here introduces interesting complications in those reactions, catalyzed by an oxide doped with an LVD1, that involve the formation of electron-donating adsorbates (e.g., hydroxyls or organic radicals)."
[11] "Consider, for example, the activation of methane by an oxide catalyst doped with an LVD1. The presence of the LVD1 substantially increases the energy gained by the dissociative adsorption of methane."
[12] "Assuming that the EvansPolanyi rules work for this case, this will lower the activation energy for breaking the CH bond and oxides doped with LVD1 should be better catalysts for methane activation than the undoped oxides."
[13] "However, the dissociation produces H and CH3 bonded to the oxygen atoms of the surface, which act as compensating agents."
[14] "If these two species are not removed promptly from the surface, their presence substantially lower the activity of the surface (by the chemical compensation effect) and they poison the catalyst."
[15] "We may have a situation where the rate-limiting step is not the breaking of the CH bond but the removal of H and CH3 from the surface."

1. The aim of these calculations is to elucidate various facets of the chemistry of oxides doped with dopants having a valence one less than the cation they replace (LVD1).

2. We hypothesize that all LVD1 dopants significantly enhance the reactivity of the surface oxygen atoms across various doped oxides.

3. We propose that adsorbing an electron donor (H or CH3) on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD1 mitigates the dopant's influence.

4. An LVD creates an electron deficiency in the surface, weakening the oxygen atoms' attachment to the doped oxide. 

5. An electron donor adsorbed on the doped oxide rectifies this deficiency, strengthening the oxygen bond and diminishing its reactivity.

6. The analysis of partial density of states confirms the electron deficiency induced by an LVD on the surface and the impact of an electron donor in restoring the oxide's original electronic state.

7. The LVD's influence on the reactivity of all oxygen atoms in the supercell used for calculations is due to the delocalized molecular orbital comprising oxygen atomic orbitals.

8. Our research findings suggest intriguing complexities in catalytic reactions involving oxides doped with LVD1s and electron-donating adsorbates.

9. The presence of an LVD1 significantly boosts the energy gained during the dissociative adsorption of methane.

10. Under the assumption that the EvansPolanyi rules apply, this enhancement lowers the activation energy for breaking the CH bond, making LVD1-doped oxides more effective catalysts for methane activation.

11. The dissociation of methane forms H and CH3 bound to the oxide surface, acting as compensating agents.

12. If these species remain on the surface, their presence reduces the catalyst's activity via the chemical compensation effect, potentially poisoning the catalyst.

13. The rate-limiting step in such reactions might not be the CH bond breaking but the removal of H and CH3 from the surface.

The Raman spectroscopy combined with other analytical techniques provides comprehensive insights into doped catalysts. It contributes to characterizing their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It can offer detailed information about the spectral features that correlate with catalyst properties such as reducibility. For instance, studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania have revealed that the Raman spectra can distinguish between different dopants and their effects on the catalyst structure and activity. The spectral shifts and intensity changes can reflect the introduction of dopants and their influence on the electronic properties and catalytic behavior of the materials.

In the context of Ce-doped CoCr2O4, the Raman spectra might show distinct peaks attributed to the Ce ions, indicating the incorporation of cerium into the cobalt-chromium oxide lattice. This could provide information on the Ce oxidation state, the coordination environment, and the degree of redox activity. Similarly, for alkali-doped vanadia on titania, the Raman spectra can differentiate between the alkali metals and reveal how they modify the vanadia structure, affecting its acid-base properties and reactivity towards various chemical transformations.

The insights gained from Raman spectroscopy can help understand the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties. For example, the spectral shifts and intensity changes associated with the dopants can correlate with changes in the reducibility of the catalysts. By analyzing these features, researchers can infer the impact of dopants on the electronic structure, surface chemistry, and catalytic mechanisms, providing a deeper understanding of the material's behavior under various conditions.

In summary, Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with other analytical techniques enables a detailed examination of doped catalysts, offering valuable information about their structure, reactivity, and the effects of dopants on their properties. This knowledge can guide the design and optimization of catalysts for specific applications, enhancing their performance and efficiency.

Density functional theory is used to study the chemistry of oxides doped with cations having lower valence than the host. Two rules are documented: the presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant, and adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts the effect of the dopant. In the presence of an LVD, the energy required to make an oxygen vacancy, the binding energies of a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical to an oxygen atom, and the energy of dissociative adsorption of methane are significantly reduced. This is due to the creation of a partially filled orbital in the valence band, which is filled by the adsorption of an electron donor, making the density of states of the compensated surface similar to that of the undoped oxide.

The document outlines the use of density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the chemistry of oxides doped with cations having a lower valence than the host. It documents two key rules: the presence of a dopant enhances the oxide's oxidizing capability, and adsorbing an electron donor on the surface mitigates the dopant's effect. The document further posits that doping with low valence dopants (LVDs) generally activates the surface oxygen atoms, making them more reactive. It also suggests that adsorbing an electron donor onto a surface doped with an LVD can counteract the dopant's influence, a phenomenon termed the chemical compensation effect. The document hints at the possibility that all LVDs might induce long-range modifications in the surface oxygen chemistry but lacks supporting calculations to confirm this assumption. The findings imply complexities in reactions catalyzed by LVD-doped oxides, particularly concerning the formation of electron-donating adsorbates, which could lower the catalyst's activity due to the chemical compensation effect.
