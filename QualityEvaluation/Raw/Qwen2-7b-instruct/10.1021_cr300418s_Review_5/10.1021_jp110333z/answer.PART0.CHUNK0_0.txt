[1] "We document two rules. (1) The presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant. (2) Adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts strongly the effect of the dopant."
[2] "The calculations presented here also show that when a H atom or a CH3 radical are adsorbed on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD, the chemistry of the surface becomes very similar to that of the undoped oxide."
[3] "We have explained that the long-range effect of the dopant or of the compensating H atom occurs because a delocalized orbital, involving the atomic orbitals of the surface oxygen atoms, is filled or empty."
[4] "The reason for this chemical compensation effect can be understood as follows: having a lower valence than the cation it substitutes, an LVD creates a deficit of electrons in the surface. The oxygen atoms, which are very electrophilic, no longer bind as strongly to the doped surface and are therefore more inclined to react with adsorbates."
[5] "We have explained that the long-range effect of the dopant or of the compensating H atom occurs because a delocalized orbital, involving the atomic orbitals of the surface oxygen atoms, is filled or empty."
[6] "The compensation effect leads to a similar coadsorption behavior. Let us look, for illustration, at the dissociative adsorption of CH4 on LaCeO2."

1. Two rules are stated: the presence of the dopant enhances the oxidant capability of the oxide, and adsorbing an electron donor on the surface mitigates the dopant's effect.

2. When a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical is adsorbed on the surface of an oxide doped with a low valence dopant, the surface chemistry becomes akin to that of the undoped oxide.

3. The long-range effect of the dopant or compensating hydrogen atom is attributed to the filling or emptying of a delocalized orbital that involves the atomic orbitals of the surface oxygen atoms.

4. An LVD creates an electron deficit in the surface due to its lower valence compared to the substituted cation. Oxygen atoms, being electrophilic, bind less strongly to the doped surface, making them more reactive. Adsorbing an electron donor compensates this deficit.

5. The long-range effect of the dopant or compensating hydrogen atom is explained by the modification of the electronic structure involving the delocalized orbital of the surface oxygen atoms.

6. When considering the dissociative adsorption of methane on LaCeO2, the presence of a compensating agent leads to a repulsive behavior between the fragments of the dissociated methane, stabilizing the final state on the surface.

1. 我们记录了两条规则：掺杂剂的存在使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。吸附电子供体到表面可以强烈抵消掺杂剂的作用。

2. 当氢原子或甲基基团吸附在低价掺杂剂掺杂的氧化物的表面上时，表面化学性质会类似于未掺杂的氧化物。

3. 掺杂剂或补偿氢原子的远距离效应归因于涉及表面氧原子原子轨道的离域轨道的填充或空缺。

4. 由于其较低的电荷数与替代阳离子相比，低价掺杂剂在表面产生电子缺陷。由于氧原子的强亲电性，它们不再紧密地结合到掺杂的表面上，因此更容易与吸附剂反应。吸附电子供体可以补偿这个缺陷。

5. 通过修改涉及表面氧原子原子轨道的电子结构，解释了掺杂剂或补偿氢原子的远距离效应。

6. 考虑到LaCeO2上甲烷的离解吸附，补偿剂的存在导致甲烷碎片之间的排斥行为，稳定了最终状态在表面上。
