[1] "We use density functional theory to study the chemistry of oxides doped substitutionally with cations having lower valence than that of the host."
[2] "We document two rules. (1) The presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant. (2) Adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts strongly the effect of the dopant."
[3] "In all examples that we have examined, the presence of an LVD in the surface of an oxide makes ΔEv much smaller and ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4 much larger than in the case of the undoped oxide."
[4] "We postulate that the presence of an LVD on the surface produces a partially filled orbital in the valence band and the adsorption of a compensating electron donor fills this orbital, making the density of states of the compensated surface very similar to that of the undoped oxide."

Density functional theory is used to study the chemistry of oxides doped with cations having lower valence than the host. Two rules are documented: the presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant, and adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts the effect of the dopant. In the presence of an LVD, the energy required to make an oxygen vacancy, the binding energies of a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical to an oxygen atom, and the energy of dissociative adsorption of methane are significantly reduced. This is due to the creation of a partially filled orbital in the valence band, which is filled by the adsorption of an electron donor, making the density of states of the compensated surface similar to that of the undoped oxide.

我们使用密度泛函理论研究了通过替换具有较低价态的离子取代主族的氧化物的化学性质。记录了两条规则：掺杂剂的存在使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂，吸附电子供体到表面可以强烈抵消掺杂剂的作用。在掺杂剂存在的情况下，形成氧空位的能量、氧原子吸附氢原子或甲基自由基的能量以及甲烷的解离吸附能显著降低。这是由于在价带中产生部分填充的轨道，该轨道由吸附的电子供体填充，使得补偿表面的能级分布与未掺杂氧化物相似。
