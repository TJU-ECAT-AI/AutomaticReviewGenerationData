[1] "The vast majority of crystal structures are determined by X-ray diffraction. The interaction of an X-ray with the crystal charge density is sufficiently strong to yield diffraction data with high signal-to-noise but weak enough to be described as kinemati- cal in nature."
[2] "The consequences of improved resolution are manifold."
[3] "The probe size of a convergent beam in precession varies approximately as the square of the precession angle and linearly with the spherical aberration coefficient of the probe-forming lens."
[4] "Many complex devices and materials are three-dimensional in nature at many different length scales. A large fraction of catalysts used are highly porous structures with complex 3D structural networks and particle distributions."
[5] "The electron intensity is much weaker and the features are analogous to the absorption edges found in X-ray absorption spectra, and they arise from scattering of the transmitted electrons by inner-shell (core) electrons of each element present in the specimen."

The text does not provide specific information regarding the use of Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with other analytical techniques for characterizing doped catalysts. It focuses on the advancements in electron microscopy techniques such as high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM), electron tomography, electron holography, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). However, it indirectly mentions that these techniques can offer insights into the composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity of catalysts. For instance, high-resolution electron microscopy can provide detailed structural information about catalysts, while electron tomography can visualize the 3D structure at the nanoscale, revealing internal structures and defects. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy can provide information about the valence states, bond distances, and composition of the catalysts. 

To answer the question, we can infer that Raman spectroscopy, when used in combination with these electron microscopy techniques, might complement the analysis by providing additional information about the vibrational modes of dopants or functional groups present in the catalysts. This could help in understanding the relationship between the spectral features and the properties of the catalysts, such as reducibility. However, the text does not specifically discuss how Raman spectroscopy is integrated with electron microscopy techniques for doped catalysts.

The text does not provide explicit information about the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility in the context of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 or alkali-doped vanadia on titania. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the question based on the provided information.

文档没有提供关于拉曼光谱与其它分析技术在表征掺杂催化剂时的具体应用信息。它主要关注电子显微镜技术的进步，如高分辨率电子显微镜（HREM）、电子体层摄影、电子全息图和电子能量损失光谱（EELS）。然而，它间接提到这些技术可以为催化剂的组成、结构、原位行为和活性提供见解。例如，高分辨率电子显微镜可以提供催化剂的详细结构信息，而电子体层摄影则可以以纳米尺度可视化结构，并揭示内部结构和缺陷。电子能量损失光谱可以提供催化剂中元素价态、键长和组成的详细信息。

基于此，我们可以推断，在使用电子显微镜技术时，结合拉曼光谱可能能够补充分析，通过提供催化剂中掺杂剂或功能基团的振动模式信息，帮助理解谱特征与催化剂性质（如可还原性）之间的关系。然而，文档并没有具体讨论如何将拉曼光谱与电子显微镜技术结合用于研究掺杂催化剂。

文档也没有提供关于在Ce掺杂CoCr2O4或碱金属掺杂氧化钛的上下文中，谱特征与催化剂属性（如可还原性）之间关系的具体信息。因此，根据提供的信息，无法直接回答这个问题。

The study of catalysts has been significantly advanced by the development of high-resolution electron microscopy techniques. The ability to image individual metal atoms and small metal clusters on various supports has provided insights into the location and mode of action of catalytic activity. This includes the identification of catalytic sites at the atomic level, such as single Pt atoms on Al2O3 (Kwak et al.), and the examination of gold nanoparticles (Liu et al.). These advancements have led to a better understanding of catalyst structure-function relationships, particularly in relation to the size and composition of active sites. The preparation of minute metal clusters with controlled size and composition has become crucial for elucidating the root causes of catalytic efficiency. The use of tungsten oxide supported on zirconia as a catalyst for alkane isomerization highlights the importance of support materials in catalysis. Altering the support to enhance the quantity of specific metal clusters, like Zr-WOx, has improved the performance of catalysts in processes like methanol dehydration. The detailed examination of catalysts at the atomic scale using advanced electron microscopy techniques has been instrumental in advancing the field of catalysis.

<p>There has been a number of recent reviews dealing with the subject of the article;[16] but such is the pace of change in technical improvements of the microscopes themselves, and in the specimen stages that have been devised to cope with in situ and other studies, that it is timely to outline some key recent developments which, we believe, have already added significantly to our knowledge of solid catalysts and which are likely to contribute further both to progress in understanding catalytic action of known catalysts and in pointing the way to the formulation of new ones.</p>
<p>The types of catalysts that we focus upon are of two main kinds: those that are of the oxide-supported precious-metal or transition-metal variety; and those that are either microporous or mesoporous solids of zeolitic or more generally nanoporous variety.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is now increasingly argued that it is not the nanostructures (nanoparticles of 310 nm diameter) in systems such as supported Au or Pt (on CeO2 and after oxides) that are the loci of catalytic activity, but, instead, catalytic activity is thought to be located at much smaller entities, possibly consisting of one or a few individual metal atoms (i.e., see Ref. [16] , the work of Flytzani-Stephanopoulos et al.[17] and the work of Kwak et al.[14] shown in Figure 2c, in which the single atoms of Pt are anchored directly to Al ions at the surface of the Al2O3 support).</p>
<p>Improvement in resolution has the effect of not only improving the image but also, through the near-elimination of delocalization, the interpretability of image contrast. A key example of this second benefit is the work of Su et al. using AC-HREM to investigate the atomic structure of the surface of Ag particles, revealing terraces, steps, and edges.[18]</p>
<p>Significant is this work that Liu et al., in the light of the continuing debate pertaining to the root cause of exception, that it now seems desirable that carefully designed experiments, using mass-selected minute clusters of Au are prepared (in the manner of Bernhardt et al.[21] or Li et al.,[22] or Tsukuda, in more detail later) so that such monodisperse preparations of Aun (n=1,2, etc. up to 10 or so) could then be systematically tested for various catalytic reactions.</p>
<p>Buttrey has recently reported that, in his investigation of the structural subtleties exhibited by M1 phases in which Ta replaced Nb, there are definite indications of there being miscibility gaps in the solid-state.[30] To what extent such gaps may have catalytic significance remains to be discovered.</p>
<p>Clarifying the nature and designing superior supported oxide-on oxide, solid-acid catalysts. The case of WOx on ZrO2 It has long been known that tungsten oxide supported on zirconia is a good catalyst for isomerizing light alkanes (C4 to C8) through the intermediacy of surface protons. Much, however, remains to be learnt about this kind of catalyst. In particular, what is the precise nature and optimum size of the clusters of WO3 (generally designated WOx) when bound to a ZrO2 support (Scheme 1)? Is the most active catalyst one that has monotungstate or polytungstate moieties at the surface?</p>
<p>By ingenious application of HAADF-STEM investigations, Kiely and co-workers[31] have identified the key active site, and have thereby been led to design a superior catalyst. Their work is, in essence, summarized in Figures 9 and 10, in which both mono- and poly-tungstate entities supported on ZrO2 are clearly visible (through the utilization of a 200 kV JEOL 2200FS (STEM) microscope equipped with a CEOS probe Cs-corrector).</p>
<p>The approach of electron crystallography entails solving the structure of many small crystals in three dimensions using both the diffracted beams and the image formed in an electron microscope. The incoming beam is focused onto a small part of the specimen and then a selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is recorded using the aperture at the image plane. One for the great advantages of solving 3D structures by electron crystallography is that the beams that form the diffraction patterns may be refocused to form an image (the electron micrograph). This electron micrograph is, in essence, a hologram constructed from the diffracted beams and contains all the information about the relative phases of the beams, that is, the micrograph is a result of both the reconstructed amplitude and relative phases of the diffracted beam.</p>
<p>Recently, X-ray powder diffraction has been combined with electron crystallography to determine the structures of several complex zeolite catalysts such as TNU-9,[39] SSZ-74,[40] and ITQ-37,[41,42] and the advantages of doing so have been emphasized by Sun et al.[38]</p>
<p>Precession electron diffraction and its potential in solving the structure of new catalysts The vast majority of crystal structures are determined by X-ray diffraction. The interaction of an X-ray with the crystal charge density is sufficiently strong to yield diffraction data with high signal-to-noise but weak enough to be described as kinematical in nature. In this kinematical limit, the intensities of reflections are proportional to the square of the structure factor for that reflection and this has huge advantages in solving crystal structures. The interaction of an electron, with the crystal potential is in general far stronger, intensities of reflections are dynamical and are dominated by multiple scattering events.</p>
<p>The use of precession electron diffraction for structure solution has been growing in recent years. There have been a number of studies of complex oxide systems including minerals (e.g., beryl, andalusite, cordierite, uvarovite, kaermanite and mordenite), other mixed metal oxides including (Ga,In)2SnO4, Ba6Mn5O15, and La4Cu3MoO12, and studies of intermetallic systems such as Al-Fe and Al-Mg-Zn. In the catalysis field, electron diffraction has been applied for many years to zeolite and related structures, known to be difficult to solve with conventional X-ray methods.</p>
<p>The probe size of a convergent beam in precession varies approximately as the square of the precession angle and linearly with the spherical aberration coefficient of the probe-forming lens. In order to reduce the effects of multiple scattering, and thus to record usable electron diffraction intensities, the precession angle has to be relatively large (typically 238).</p>
<p>Electron tomography and electron holography Many complex devices and materials are three-dimensional in nature at many different length scales. A large fraction of catalysts used are highly porous structures with complex 3D structural networks and particle distributions. These are often challenging structures to investigate by electron microscopy, and electron tomography has proven to be a very powerful tool in unraveling the 3D structure at the nanoscale.</p>
<p>The work of Calvino et al.[65] on the oxygen storage capacity of CeO2-based solids that are used in a three-way, auto-exhaust catalyst has benefited enormously from investigations involving HREM (STEM) and electron tomography.</p>
<p>By adding an electron spectrometer to either a STEM or a TEM instrument, a great deal of extra structural information about the specimen may be extracted. For example, the wealth of information schematized in Figure 21 is retrievable.</p>
<p>Owing to the very recent availability of high-intensity, sharply focused (ca. 1 μm diameter) electron beams operating within AC-STEM instruments, truly atomic-scale chemical imaging is now possible, as recently demonstrated by Muller et al.[67] who examined perovskite layers (Figure 22).</p>
<p>Four-dimensional (4D) ultrafast (stroboscopic) electron microscopy became feasible some five years ago, thanks to the efforts of Zewail and co-workers.[69] Similar efforts have been made to develop ultrafast single-shot experiments at the Lawrence Livermore labs, known as dynamic TEM, or DTEM.[70] It is an approach that adds the dimensions of time to the three spa- tial ones that are retrievable by HREM; and it has opened up new vistas and applications by using timed, single-electron (or just a few electron) packets.</p>
