[1] "The vast majority of crystal structures are determined by X-ray diffraction. The interaction of an X-ray with the crystal charge density is sufficiently strong to yield diffraction data with high signal-to-noise but weak enough to be described as kinemati- cal in nature."
[2] "The consequences of improved resolution are manifold."
[3] "The probe size of a convergent beam in precession varies approximately as the square of the precession angle and linearly with the spherical aberration coefficient of the probe-forming lens."
[4] "Many complex devices and materials are three-dimensional in nature at many different length scales. A large fraction of catalysts used are highly porous structures with complex 3D structural networks and particle distributions."
[5] "The electron intensity is much weaker and the features are analogous to the absorption edges found in X-ray absorption spectra, and they arise from scattering of the transmitted electrons by inner-shell (core) electrons of each element present in the specimen."

The text does not provide specific information regarding the use of Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with other analytical techniques for characterizing doped catalysts. It focuses on the advancements in electron microscopy techniques such as high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM), electron tomography, electron holography, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). However, it indirectly mentions that these techniques can offer insights into the composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity of catalysts. For instance, high-resolution electron microscopy can provide detailed structural information about catalysts, while electron tomography can visualize the 3D structure at the nanoscale, revealing internal structures and defects. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy can provide information about the valence states, bond distances, and composition of the catalysts. 

To answer the question, we can infer that Raman spectroscopy, when used in combination with these electron microscopy techniques, might complement the analysis by providing additional information about the vibrational modes of dopants or functional groups present in the catalysts. This could help in understanding the relationship between the spectral features and the properties of the catalysts, such as reducibility. However, the text does not specifically discuss how Raman spectroscopy is integrated with electron microscopy techniques for doped catalysts.

The text does not provide explicit information about the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility in the context of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 or alkali-doped vanadia on titania. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the question based on the provided information.

文档没有提供关于拉曼光谱与其它分析技术在表征掺杂催化剂时的具体应用信息。它主要关注电子显微镜技术的进步，如高分辨率电子显微镜（HREM）、电子体层摄影、电子全息图和电子能量损失光谱（EELS）。然而，它间接提到这些技术可以为催化剂的组成、结构、原位行为和活性提供见解。例如，高分辨率电子显微镜可以提供催化剂的详细结构信息，而电子体层摄影则可以以纳米尺度可视化结构，并揭示内部结构和缺陷。电子能量损失光谱可以提供催化剂中元素价态、键长和组成的详细信息。

基于此，我们可以推断，在使用电子显微镜技术时，结合拉曼光谱可能能够补充分析，通过提供催化剂中掺杂剂或功能基团的振动模式信息，帮助理解谱特征与催化剂性质（如可还原性）之间的关系。然而，文档并没有具体讨论如何将拉曼光谱与电子显微镜技术结合用于研究掺杂催化剂。

文档也没有提供关于在Ce掺杂CoCr2O4或碱金属掺杂氧化钛的上下文中，谱特征与催化剂属性（如可还原性）之间关系的具体信息。因此，根据提供的信息，无法直接回答这个问题。
