[1] "New possibilities with aberration-corrected elec- tron microscopes was the subject of a recent, comprehensive Royal Society Discussion,[7]"
[2] "However, in addition to this fact, specialized approaches involving electron tomogra- phy, electron holography, and precession electron diffraction,not to mention the growing use of computational assistance,such as exit-wave reconstruction, are now widely used even with microscopes that are not fitted with aberration correc- tions."
[3] "Indeed, one stalwart investigator, who pioneered the general use of electron microscopes fifty years ago, recently expressed[8] the opinion that the quest to understand more about the nature and mode of action of catalyst is now the single most important factor responsible for the ever increas- ing deployment of AC microscopes."
[4] "Many major advances registered within the past few years are high- lighted in this article and along with their significance."
[5] "Nowadays, however, it had become almost routine to image individual, as well as small clusters of, metal atoms on supports such as carbon, Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 (Figure 2)."
[6] "Improved resolution is manifold. Firstly, it is now increasingly argued that it is not the nano- structures (nanoparticles of 310 nm diameter) in systems such as supported Au or Pt (on CeO2 and after oxides) that are the loci of catalytic activity, but, instead, catalytic activity is thought to be located at much smaller entities, possibly con- sisting of one or a few individual metal atoms (i.e., see Ref. [16] , the work of Flytzani-Stephanopoulos et al.[17] and the work of Kwak et al.[14] shown in Figure 2c, in which the single atoms of Pt are anchored directly to Al ions at the surface of the Al2O3 support)."
[7] "Aberration correction has the effect of not only improving the resolution of the image but also, through the near-elimination of delocalization, the interpretability of image contrast."
[8] "Liu et al., in the light of the continuing debate pertaining to the root cause of exception,that it now seems desirable that carefully designed experi- ments, using mass-selected minute clusters of Au are prepared (in the manner of Bernhardt et al.[21] or Li et al.,[22] or Tsukuda,in more detail later) so that such monodisperse preparations of Aun (n=1,2, etc. up to 10 or so) could then be systemati- cally tested for various catalytic reactions."
[9] "Selecting the right catalyst for a specific application can be challenging, and it often requires a deep understanding of the catalyst's structure and reactivity. Advances in electron microscopy have provided researchers with powerful tools to study catalysts at the atomic level, offering insights into their behavior and performance."

The document highlights the advancements in electron microscopy techniques that have significantly contributed to the understanding of solid catalysts. These techniques include aberration-corrected electron microscopy, electron tomography, electron holography, precession electron diffraction, and 4D electron microscopy. These tools have allowed for the imaging of individual metal atoms and small metal clusters on various supports, revealing insights into the nature and mode of action of catalysts. The document also emphasizes the importance of these advancements in elucidating the role of smaller entities, such as individual metal atoms, in catalytic activity, challenging the notion that large nanostructures are the primary catalysts. Additionally, it discusses the benefits of aberration correction in improving image resolution and interpretability, as well as the potential of 4D electron microscopy for studying catalysts in real-time with high spatial and temporal resolution.
