[1] "Nowadays, however, it had become almost routine to image individual, as well as small clusters of, metal atoms on supports such as carbon, Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 (Figure 2)."
[2] "They ensured that, in testing the performance of their Au/FeOOH catalysts, all the organic species shrouding the colloidal nanoparticles were burnt away during preliminary oxidation."
[3] "They then investigated the resulting Au nanoparticles using AC-HREM, during the course of which they identified individual atoms of Au, which then enabled them to calibrate the intensity of a single Au atom."
[4] "The consequences of improved resolution are manifold."
[5] "So significant is this work that Liu et al., in the light of the continuing debate pertaining to the root cause of exception, that it now seems desirable that carefully designed experiments, using mass-selected minute clusters of Au are prepared (in the manner of Bernhardt et al., or Li et al., or Tsukuda, in more detail later) so that such monodisperse preparations of Aun (n=1,2, etc. up to 10 or so) could then be systematically tested for various catalytic reactions."
[6] "It has long been known that tungsten oxide supported on zirconia is a good catalyst for isomerizing light alkanes (C4 to C8) through the intermediacy of surface protons."
[7] "The caption to Figure 9 states the facts pertaining to the variety of sizes of WOx clusters that are present at a ZrO2 surface."
[8] "But images such as that circled in Figure 10 clearly reveal (from the intensities of the octahedrally arranged M (where M is either W or Zr) centers) that small Zr-WOx clusters exist at the surface of high-activity samples."
[9] "By deliberately altering the support of the introduced WO3 units (from ZrO2 to ZrOx(OH)42x), Kiely and co-workers could boost the quantity of Zr-WOx entities at the surface, thereby greatly improving the performance of the resulting solid as an acidic catalyst in, for example, the dehydration of methanol to yield dimethyl and ether."

The study of catalysts has been significantly advanced by the development of high-resolution electron microscopy techniques. The ability to image individual metal atoms and small metal clusters on various supports has provided insights into the location and mode of action of catalytic activity. This includes the identification of catalytic sites at the atomic level, such as single Pt atoms on Al2O3 (Kwak et al.), and the examination of gold nanoparticles (Liu et al.). These advancements have led to a better understanding of catalyst structure-function relationships, particularly in relation to the size and composition of active sites. The preparation of minute metal clusters with controlled size and composition has become crucial for elucidating the root causes of catalytic efficiency. The use of tungsten oxide supported on zirconia as a catalyst for alkane isomerization highlights the importance of support materials in catalysis. Altering the support to enhance the quantity of specific metal clusters, like Zr-WOx, has improved the performance of catalysts in processes like methanol dehydration. The detailed examination of catalysts at the atomic scale using advanced electron microscopy techniques has been instrumental in advancing the field of catalysis.
