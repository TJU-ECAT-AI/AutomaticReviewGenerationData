The Raman spectroscopy, in combination with infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. Specifically, these techniques allow for the identification of various species present on the catalyst surface, such as oxidized gold species (Au+ and Au3+) on Au/CeO2 catalysts. The FTIR analysis reveals the presence of these species, which are quite stable even under reduction conditions like the CO oxidation reaction. The EXAFS results further elucidate the structural details, such as the presence of two different types of oxidized gold species interacting with oxygen atoms on the support. The concentration of these gold species during catalytic CO oxidation indicates their stabilization on the catalyst, suggesting their involvement in the catalytic activity. The study shows that both oxidized and metallic gold species contribute to the catalytic performance of Au/CeO2 catalysts for CO oxidation.

In summary, Raman spectroscopy, along with FTIR and EXAFS, offers detailed information on the nature of dopants, their distribution, and their interaction with the support, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst's behavior and reactivity.

拉曼光谱与红外光谱（FTIR）和扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）技术相结合，为掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解提供了贡献。这些技术提供了关于催化剂组成、结构、原位行为和活性的信息。具体而言，这些技术允许识别催化剂表面存在的各种物种，例如Au/CeO2催化剂上的氧化金物种（Au+和Au3+）。FTIR分析揭示了这些物种的存在，它们在还原条件下如CO氧化反应时仍然相当稳定。EXAFS结果进一步阐明了结构细节，如支持物上存在两种不同类型的氧化金物种与氧原子相互作用。浓度表征显示了这些金物种在CO氧化催化过程中的稳定化，这表明它们参与了Au/CeO2催化剂的催化活性。研究表明，氧化态和金属态的金物种都对Au/CeO2催化剂的CO氧化具有贡献。

综上所述，拉曼光谱，结合FTIR和EXAFS，提供了关于掺杂剂的详细信息，包括其分布和与支撑物的相互作用，从而提供了一个全面的理解催化剂的行为和活性。
