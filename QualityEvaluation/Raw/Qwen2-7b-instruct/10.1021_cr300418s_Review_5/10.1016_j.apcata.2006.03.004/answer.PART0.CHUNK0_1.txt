[1] "FTIR spectra of CO adsorption at 90 K on the Au/CeO2 samples after in situ CO oxidation reaction at 273 K are shown in Fig. 2."
[2] "In the Au/CeO2 samples the IR spectra of CO adsorption in the high frequency region is characterised by the presence of two strong bands at 2154 and 2138 cm1."
[3] "The 2154 cm1 IR band has been assigned to Au+ cations."
[4] "The band at 2138 cm1 has been assigned to CO adsorbed on gold metal atoms directly bonded to adsorbed oxygen."
[5] "XPS results of the Au/CeO2 catalyst show the presence of Au3+ in the as-prepared sample, while no Au3+ is observed in the 573 K hydrogen reduced sample."
[6] "Moreover oxidized gold species (Au+ and Au3+) have also been observed by other authors by means of XPS in Au/CeO2 catalyst under water gas shift conditions."
[7] "In conclusion, we have shown that oxidized gold species are stabilized during the catalytic activity of Au/CeO2 catalysts for CO oxidation."

Raman spectroscopy, combined with other analytical techniques, provides a comprehensive characterization of doped catalysts by offering insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It elucidates the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility. For instance, in the study of Ce-doped CoCr2O4, Raman spectroscopy helps understand the dopant's impact on the material's electronic structure and its ability to undergo reversible reduction. Similarly, for alkali-doped vanadia on titania, Raman spectroscopy reveals the distribution and interaction of dopants with the matrix, providing information on the dopants' chemical state and their influence on the catalyst's activity. These analyses offer a detailed picture of how dopants modify the catalyst's surface properties and reactivity, enabling a deeper understanding of their role in catalytic processes.
