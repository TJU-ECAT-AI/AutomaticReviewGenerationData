[1] "FTIR spectroscopy has been employed, as a surface sensitive technique, in order to determine the nature of gold species present on Au/CeO2 catalysts under reaction conditions."
[2] "Due to the rapid reduction at room temperature of ionic gold in contact with CO, even in the presence of oxygen, the characterisation of the catalyst was carried out by freezing down the reaction in liquid N2 and analyzing the nature of gold species using CO as a probe molecule."
[3] "FTIR spectra of CO adsorption at 90 K on the Au/CeO2 samples after in situ CO oxidation reaction at 273 K are shown in Fig. 2."
[4] "The presence of Au+ and Au3+ species has also been evidenced by XPS analysis [10]."
[5] "The band at 2138 cm1 has been assigned to CO adsorbed on gold metal atoms directly bonded to adsorbed oxygen [18,19,21,24] in analogy with a similar band observed by SERS and assigned to CO adsorbed on oxidized gold sites [25]."
[6] "On the other hand, EXAFS results shows the presence of two AuO interactions with oxygen atoms of the support at different distances [12], indicating the presence of two different types of oxidized gold species."
[7] "Moreover oxidized gold species (Au+ and Au3+) have also been observed by other authors by means of XPS in Au/CeO2 catalyst under water gas shift conditions [11]."
[8] "The concentration of the different gold species observed in the Au/CeO2 catalysts during catalytic CO oxidation, Table 1, evidence how oxidized gold species are stabilized on these samples during reaction."
[9] "In accordance oxidized gold species are involved in the catalytic activity of Au/CeO2 catalyst for CO oxidation although the participation of metallic sites cannot be excluded."

The Raman spectroscopy, in combination with infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. Specifically, FTIR helps determine the nature of gold species present on the catalyst under reaction conditions. XPS reveals the presence of oxidized gold species (Au+ and Au3+) on the catalyst surface. EXAFS indicates the presence of two different types of oxidized gold species interacting with oxygen atoms of the support. Raman spectroscopy, combined with these techniques, allows researchers to understand the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties, such as reducibility, by elucidating the specific composition and structure of the doped catalysts. For instance, the study of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania would benefit from this integrated approach to gain a deeper understanding of how dopants affect the catalyst's activity and stability.

拉曼光谱与红外光谱（FTIR）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）的结合，为掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解提供了贡献，包括其组成、结构、原位行为和反应性。具体来说，FTIR有助于确定催化剂在反应条件下的金物种性质。XPS揭示了催化剂表面存在的氧化金物种（Au+和Au3+）。EXAFS表明支持上氧原子与两种不同类型的氧化金物种的相互作用。结合这些技术的拉曼光谱允许研究者通过阐明催化剂的组成和结构之间的关系来理解可还原性，例如，Ce-doped CoCr2O4和碱基掺杂的二氧化钛的研究将从这种集成方法中受益，以深入了解掺杂剂如何影响催化剂的活性和稳定性。
