<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The FTIR spectroscopy and XPS analysis were utilized to determine the nature of gold species present on Au/CeO2 catalysts under reaction conditions. The presence of Au+ and Au3+ species was confirmed. These oxidized gold species play a role in the catalytic activity of Au/CeO2 catalysts for CO oxidation, though the involvement of metallic sites cannot be ruled out.
