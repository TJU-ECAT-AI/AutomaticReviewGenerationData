The Raman spectroscopy, in combination with infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. Specifically, FTIR helps determine the nature of gold species present on the catalyst under reaction conditions. XPS reveals the presence of oxidized gold species (Au+ and Au3+) on the catalyst surface. EXAFS indicates the presence of two different types of oxidized gold species interacting with oxygen atoms of the support. Raman spectroscopy, combined with these techniques, allows researchers to understand the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties, such as reducibility, by elucidating the specific composition and structure of the doped catalysts. For instance, the study of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania would benefit from this integrated approach to gain a deeper understanding of how dopants affect the catalyst's activity and stability.

Raman spectroscopy, combined with other analytical techniques, provides a comprehensive characterization of doped catalysts by offering insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It elucidates the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility. For instance, in the study of Ce-doped CoCr2O4, Raman spectroscopy helps understand the dopant's impact on the material's electronic structure and its ability to undergo reversible reduction. Similarly, for alkali-doped vanadia on titania, Raman spectroscopy reveals the distribution and interaction of dopants with the matrix, providing information on the dopants' chemical state and their influence on the catalyst's activity. These analyses offer a detailed picture of how dopants modify the catalyst's surface properties and reactivity, enabling a deeper understanding of their role in catalytic processes.

The Raman spectroscopy, in combination with infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. Specifically, these techniques allow for the identification of various species present on the catalyst surface, such as oxidized gold species (Au+ and Au3+) on Au/CeO2 catalysts. The FTIR analysis reveals the presence of these species, which are quite stable even under reduction conditions like the CO oxidation reaction. The EXAFS results further elucidate the structural details, such as the presence of two different types of oxidized gold species interacting with oxygen atoms on the support. The concentration of these gold species during catalytic CO oxidation indicates their stabilization on the catalyst, suggesting their involvement in the catalytic activity. The study shows that both oxidized and metallic gold species contribute to the catalytic performance of Au/CeO2 catalysts for CO oxidation.

In summary, Raman spectroscopy, along with FTIR and EXAFS, offers detailed information on the nature of dopants, their distribution, and their interaction with the support, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst's behavior and reactivity.
