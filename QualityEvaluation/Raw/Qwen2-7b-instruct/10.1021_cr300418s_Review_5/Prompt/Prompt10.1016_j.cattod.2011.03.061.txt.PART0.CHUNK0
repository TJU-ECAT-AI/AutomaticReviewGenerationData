Characterization studies by  X-ray  diffraction
(XRD),
Raman spectroscopy, BET,  scanning electron microscopy (SEM),  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS),
temperature-programmed reduction mass spectroscopy
(CH4 TPR-MS)
and  temperature-programmed desorption of  oxygen
(O2-TPD)
were  carried out.
An improvement of  the  catalytic activity was  observed over cerium-substituted cobalt chromite cat- alysts with  appropriate cerium substitution degrees.
The  best  result  has  been attained with  5% cerium modified catalyst,for  which 5%  chromium in  CoCr2O4 was  substituted by  cerium,and  the  catalytic activ- ity reached 90%  of  methane conversion at  465 C. The  characterization results indicated that  cerium doping could deform the  spinel structure and  cause redistribution of  metal ions  with  different oxidation states;consequently,they  would increase crystal  defects and  oxygen vacancy concentration,which facil- itate oxygen mobility and thus increase the  catalytic  performance of  cerium modified cobalt chromite catalysts. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction With the soaring gasoline prices and the increasingly strict emission limits,natural gas engines are widely applied to vehi- cles nowadays [1].  In addition to economic and political reasons,the use of compressed natural gas
(CNG)
for automotive applica- tions offers significant environmental advantages over gasoline and diesel.
However,the natural gas vehicles (NGVs) advantages are partially balanced by the emission of unburned methane.
As one of greenhouse gases,methane is recognized to contribute more to global atmosphere warming than CO2 at equivalent emission rates,all the more since its lifetime is quite long [1,2].
Therefore,the abatement of unconverted methane exhausted from
CNG
vehicles becomes rather important [3].
Catalytic combustion of methane is a promising technology that can convert methane into carbon dioxide at relatively low temperature,and is extensively studied over the last decade.
Noble metal-based catalysts,especially Pd-based ones can exhibit outstanding catalytic behavior at low temperatures [36].

Amongst these catalysts,spinel-type oxides have attracted much attention for many years [1,10,11].
Among the spinel-type-oxides catalysts, Cr2CoO4 was found to be very active for the oxidation of hydrocarbons [10,11], as well as for catalytic removal of NOx [12] and diesel soot [13].
As we know,doping of metal-oxide can result in a material which has significantly different properties than the original.
The above has been exploited in several investigations so as to synthesize better combustion catalysts [7,1417].
On the other hand,cerium is a well- known additive of exhaust catalysts,in view of its oxygen storage capacity,enabling the application of such catalysts over a broad range of air-to-fuel ratios,and enhancing the activity [14].
In addi- tion,it has been reported that combination of CeO2 with other metal oxides affects the oxygen mobility,which would play an impor- tant role in the catalytic combustion of methane [1,18].
Therefore,cerium was chosen as the dopant in the present investigation.
In this study,cerium modified cobalt chromite catalysts with dif- ferent cerium content were prepared by co-precipitation method and the catalytic activities were evaluated towards methane com- bustion.
The bulk structure was determined by Raman and
XRD
and the phase segregation was studied by
SEM.
The reducibility was studied by
CH4 TPR-MS.
The oxygen desorption behavior was studied by
O2-TPD.

<questions>


How does Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contribute to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts, particularly in terms of their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity, and what insights can it provide about the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility, as exemplified by studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
