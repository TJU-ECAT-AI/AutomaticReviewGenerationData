Abstract
Infrared spectroscopy of CO adsorption at low temperature has shown the presence of oxidized gold species (Au+ and Au3+) on nanocrystalline
Au/CeO2 catalyst. This species are quite stable even under reduction conditions like the CO oxidation reaction. The concentration of this species
decrease by increasing the pre-treatment temperature of the Au/CeO2 catalyst which is in accordance with a decrease in the catalytic activity of the
sample. In accordance oxidized gold species are involved in the catalytic activity of Au/CeO2 catalyst for CO oxidation although the participation
of metallic sites cannot be excluded.

1. Introduction
In the last years gold catalysts supported on metal oxides
have been reported to be highly active for several reactions
including low temperature CO oxidation [1–3]. It has been
shown how the catalytic activity of these catalysts is strongly
inﬂuenced by gold particle size, synthesis method, pre-
treatment conditions and the nature of the support [3]. The
supports have been differentiated between those able to provide
oxygen (reducible) and those not able to do so because of their
inability to adsorb oxygen [4]. In the case of reducible oxides
supports, oxygen is thought to adsorb on the support and
successively interact with the CO adsorbed on the gold particles
[5], for this reason the activity is extremely dependent on the
type of structure of the metal-support interface [4]. Thus, it has
been presented that gold clusters supported on nanocrystalline
and mesostructured nanocrystalline CeO2 or Y2O3 is much
more active for oxidations [6–8] as well as for carbon–carbon
bond formation [9] than gold clusters on conventional CeO2 or
Y2O3 supports. More speciﬁcally, supported on nanocrystalline
CeO2 presents high activity for CO oxidation [6] and the
support supplies reactive oxygen (in the form of superoxide and
peroxide species) to the active gold sites [10]. The interface
between metallic gold particles and the support appears to be
critical for high CO oxidation activity [10,11], and time-
resolved XANES spectra have shown the presence of cationic
gold clusters in the Au/CeO2 catalyst, which were stable during
CO oxidation [12]. The presence of Au+ and Au3+ species has
also been evidenced by XPS analysis [10]. Several authors
suggested the crucial role of oxidized gold species [13,14], or
even the cooperative role of metallic and oxidized gold species
[15,16] for the low temperature CO oxidation, while others
propose only metallic gold as the active species [17].
In the work reported here FTIR spectroscopy has been
employed, as a surface sensitive technique, in order to
determine the nature of gold species present on Au/CeO2
catalysts under reaction conditions. Due to the rapid reduction
at room temperature of ionic gold in contact with CO, even in
the presence of oxygen, the characterisation of the catalyst was
carried out by freezing down the reaction in liquid N2 and
analyzing the nature of gold species using CO as a probe
molecule.
2. Experimental
The catalysts were prepared starting from nanocrystalline
CeO2 and HAuCl4 according to a procedure previously
described [6]. As-prepared samples and H2-reduced samples
at 373 and 573 K have been studied.

The FTIR spectra have been collected with a FTS-40A
BioRad spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector. An IR cell
allowing in situ treatments in controlled atmospheres and
temperatures from 90 to 573 K has been connected to a vacuum
system with gas dosing facility. Prior to CO adsorption
experiments the samples have been exposed at 272 K, ‘‘in
situ’’, to a mixture of 2% CO–1% O2–97% He at 25 ml/min for
2 h. Afterward the samples were evacuated at 1.01  101 mbar
at 273 K during 30 min, and then cooled down to 90 K at
1.01  101 mbar. CO adsorption experiments have been
performed at 90 K by increasing CO dosing pressure. Lorentzian
curves have been used for curve ﬁtting of the IR spectra.
3. Results and discussion
The catalytic activity of gold supported on nanocrystalline
CeO2 strongly depends on the catalyst pre-treatment (Fig. 1).
The highest catalytic activity was obtained with the as-prepared
catalyst while reduction in H2 strongly reduces the activity.
Sintering of gold metal particles due to high temperature pre-
treatment has been reported to decrease drastically the activity
of gold supported catalysts [3]. However in this case, although
the presence of metallic gold particles has been seen in all
samples, TEM and EXAFS results [12] have shown no sintering
of gold nanoparticles on the Au/CeO2 catalyst under pre-
treatment conditions at 573 K, and/or during catalytic oxidation
of CO. FTIR spectra of CO adsorption at 90 K on the Au/CeO2
samples after ‘‘in situ’’ CO oxidation reaction at 273 K are
shown in Fig. 2. IR bands at 2154, 2138 and 2100 cm1 are

observed. The low frequency band at 2100 cm1 is assigned to
CO adsorbed on metallic gold species. However an asymmetry
at lower frequencies is observed in the as-prepared sample
indicating the presence of unsaturated sites [18,19]. The
assignation of the high frequency IR bands is still controversial
in the literature. FTIR spectra of CO adsorbed on pure CeO2
shows a broad asymmetric band with two main components at
2162 and 2148 cm1 related to CO adsorbed on Ce4+ cations
with different coordinative unsaturation [20]. In the Au/CeO2
samples the IR spectra of CO adsorption in the high frequency
region is characterised by the presence of two strong bands at
2154 and 2138 cm1. In addition to both bands, difference
spectra obtained at different CO adsorptions shows the presence
of a third band at 2148 cm1, related to Ce4+ ions of the CeO2
support (spectra not shown). As seen in Fig. 2 the intensity of
the 2154 cm1 IR band is quite similar in all samples while the
intensity of the 2138 cm1 IR band decreases when increasing
the reduction temperature of the sample. The 2154 cm1 IR
band has been assigned to Au+ cations [18,21,22], while other
assignations related with Ce4+ ions slightly modiﬁed by gold
species in gold/ceria catalysts [20] and/or OH groups [23] could
also be found in the literature. The last two possibilities could
be disregarded in our case since a band at 2154 cm1 has been
also observed with gold on a different support (Au/TiO2) and
due to the high stability of the IR band is not expected in the
case of CO adsorbed on OH groups. Thus, in agreement with
some authors [18,21,22], we can assign this band to CO
adsorbed on Au+ species.
The band at 2138 cm1 has been assigned to CO adsorbed
on gold metal atoms directly bonded to adsorbed oxygen
[18,19,21,24] in analogy with a similar band observed by SERS
and assigned to CO adsorbed on ‘‘oxidized’’ gold sites [25].
Other assignations like Au metallic particles strongly inter-
acting with the support surface [26] or liquid-like CO [20] have
also been reported in the literature. However, this last
interpretation could be disregarded in our case since the
intensity of the IR band change with the catalyst pre-treatment
independent of the CO pressure.
XPS results of the Au/CeO2 catalyst show the presence of
Au3+ in the as-prepared sample, while no Au3+ is observed in
the 573 K hydrogen reduced sample. This observation agrees
with the FTIR spectra of the same samples where the
2138 cm1 IR band is present in the as-prepared sample and
absent in the reduced one. On the other hand, we have observed
a decrease of the intensity of the 2138 cm1 IR band in the as-
prepared samples after exposing the sample to air for some time
(spectra not shown). This could be related to a reduction of
oxidized gold species by exposure of the sample to air. On the
other hand, EXAFS results shows the presence of two Au–O
interactions with oxygen atoms of the support at different
distances [12], indicating the presence of two different types of
oxidized gold species. Thus we can tentatively assign the
2138 cm1 band to an oxidized Aun+ (n > 1, probably n = 3)
specie in the perimeter interface with the support, while the
2154 cm1 band can be assign to Au+. The unexpected low
frequency of the 2138 cm1 IR band assigned to an oxidized
Aun+ (n > 1) specie compared with the 2154 cm1 IR band
assigned to Au+ specie could be related to the contribution of d
electrons in the Aun+. An increase of the carbonyl stretching
frequency with increasing the electric ﬁeld strength at the cation
centre is only observed for a d0 electron conﬁguration [27].
However this is not always the case for transition metal ions with
‘‘d’’ electrons whose electronic orbitals are easily modiﬁed by
interaction with an adsorbed molecule. In this way unexpected
frequencies have already been observed for vanadia and could be
also observed for cobalt ionic species [28], and can also occur in
the case of gold. Theoretical calculations are in progress to
conﬁrm this behaviour in the case of gold ionic species.
The concentration of the different gold species observed in
the Au/CeO2 catalysts during catalytic CO oxidation, Table 1,
evidence how oxidized gold species are stabilized on these
samples during reaction. Moreover oxidized gold species (Au+
and Au3+) have also been observed by other authors by means
of XPS in Au/CeO2 catalyst under water gas shift conditions
[11]. In order to determine the inﬂuence of these species on the
catalytic behaviour of the Au/CeO2 samples during CO
oxidation at low temperature, a correlation between oxidized
and metallic gold species with the catalytic activity has been
done (Fig. 3). The catalytic activity increases with the
concentration of oxidized gold species (Au+ + Au3+)/Au0
however a linear correlation is not observed. The highest
catalytic activity observed in the as-prepared sample seems to
indicate that besides the above cationic gold species other
species also contribute to the catalytic activity. In fact FTIR
spectra show the presence of highly unsaturated sites in the
metallic gold particles of the as-prepared sample, which
according to previous observations contribute in some way to
the catalytic activity [6]. EXAFS results [12] have shown that
oxidized species (Au+ and Au3+) are related with the perimeter
interface of the gold particle and the support. Thus the positive
catalytic effect of small particle size gold is related to the
stabilization of oxidized as well as unsaturated gold species.
In conclusion, we have shown that oxidized gold species are
stabilized during the catalytic activity of Au/CeO2 catalysts for
