[1] "The solgel method has attracted considerable attention for the preparation of metallic catalysts, since the constituents are mixed in an atomic scale and this generates a uniform distribution of active metals upon the support."
[2] "Catalyticcombustionisacosteffectivecontroltechnologyfor theabatementofVOCsandairtoxics[9,10].Alsoforchlorinated wastes the advantages of catalytic combustion versus thermal incineration include lower fuel consumption (lower operating costs), lower NOx emissions, lower CO and products of incom- plete combustion (PIC) emissions, less CO2 emitted."
[3] "Regarding DTA analyses (Fig. 2b), two exothermic peaks were observed for the pure zirconia DTA curve, namely at 350 and 468 C. The first signal can be attributed to the combus- tion of organic residual groups while the second one indicates a crystallization process between the amorphous product and the tetragonal crystalline phase [14,15]."
[4] "In the case of the solids doped with La-Fe, it can be observed that the tetragonal phase is the dominant one; a similar effect was reported by Navio et al. [3] stating that the development of the tetragonal phase by the presence of doping agents could be due to a decrease in the surface free energy of ZrO2 or to the creation of anionic vacancies."
[5] "The presence of tetrag- onal and monoclinic crystalline phases for the different doped samples depends on the combination of metals; it is clear that the monoclinic structure is favored by the La-Mn combination while the tetragonal arrangement by the La-Fe doping agents."
[6] "The specific surface areas of the Zr substrates prepared in this work range from 1.5 to 5 m2 g1 and the pore size from 5 to 60 nm approximately (Table 1), this means that a small surface area has a minor influence on the catalytic combustion of trieline; on the other hand, the relatively large cavity sizes can facilitate the transport of reactants and products through the porous structure of ZrO2 catalysts."
[7] "Only the catalyst doped with La and Fe continues with an excellent catalytic performance at high temperatures. In this way the ZLF catalyst reaches almost 100% of conversion at 500 C meanwhile the thermal combustion only achieves 50% at the same temperature."

1. The solgel method is highly regarded for creating metallic catalysts due to the uniform distribution of active metals it facilitates on the support surface at the atomic scale level.

2. Catalytic combustion is an efficient technique for controlling and mitigating VOCs and air toxins. It offers benefits over thermal incineration, including reduced fuel consumption, lower NOx emissions, less CO and PIC emissions, and fewer CO2 emissions.

3. In DTA analyses, two exothermic peaks were identified for pure zirconia, with one attributed to the combustion of organic residues and the other indicating a crystallization process transitioning from amorphous to tetragonal crystalline phase.

4. The tetragonal phase predominates in samples doped with La-Fe, similar to findings reported by Navio et al., suggesting the development of this phase might result from a decrease in ZrO2 surface energy or the creation of anionic vacancies.

5. The crystalline phase composition of doped zirconia samples depends on the metal combination used. Monoclinic structure is favored by La-Mn, while tetragonal arrangement is achieved with La-Fe doping.

6. The specific surface area of the synthesized zirconia catalysts varies from 1.5 to 5 m2/g1, and the pore size spans from 5 to 60 nm. A small surface area has little impact on the catalytic combustion of trichloroethylene, whereas the larger cavity sizes aid in the transport of reactants and products through the porous structure of ZrO2 catalysts.

7. The catalyst doped with La and Fe maintains exceptional catalytic performance even at high temperatures. The ZLF catalyst achieves nearly 100% conversion at 500°C, significantly outperforming thermal combustion which only reaches 50% at the same temperature.

1. 溶胶法因其能够在支持物表面实现原子尺度上的金属活性均匀分布，受到了制备金属催化剂的广泛关注。

2. 催化燃烧是一种有效的控制和减少VOCs和空气毒性的技术。相比于热焚烧，它能带来燃料消耗降低、NOx排放减少、CO和不完全燃烧产物排放减少以及二氧化碳排放减少等优势。

3. 在差示扫描量热分析中，纯氧化锆曲线出现了两个吸热峰，其中一个归因于有机残留物的燃烧，另一个指示了从无定形产品向四方晶系结晶相的结晶过程。

4. 具有La-Fe掺杂的样品中，四方相占据主导地位，这与Navio等人报告的类似结果相符，他们指出，通过掺杂剂的存在导致ZrO2表面能量下降或形成阴离子空位可能是这种相发展的原因。

5. 不同掺杂样品中的晶体相组成取决于所使用的金属组合。La-Mn组合有利于形成单斜结构，而La-Fe组合则导致四方排列。

6. 合成的氧化锆催化剂的特定表面积范围为1.5至5 m2/g1，孔径从5至60 nm。较小的表面积对三氯乙烯的催化燃烧影响较小，而较大的腔体大小有助于反应物和产物通过氧化锆催化剂的多孔结构的运输。

7. 具有La和Fe掺杂的催化剂在高温下保持卓越的催化性能。ZLF催化剂在500°C时达到近100%转化率，显著优于仅达到50%转化率的热燃烧。
