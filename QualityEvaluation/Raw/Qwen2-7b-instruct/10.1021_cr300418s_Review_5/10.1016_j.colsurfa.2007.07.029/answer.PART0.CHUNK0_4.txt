[1] "The solgel method has attracted considerable attention for the preparation of metallic catalysts, since the constituents are mixed in an atomic scale and this generates a uniform distribution of active metals upon the support."
[2] "The crystalline phase obtained by the solgel method depends on the starting metallic precursor."
[3] "The presence of tetragonal and monoclinic crystalline phases for the different doped samples depends on the combination of metals; it is clear that the monoclinic structure is favored by the La-Mn combination while the tetragonal arrangement by the La-Fe doping agents."
[4] "The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests."
[5] "The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase."

The solgel method, due to its ability to uniformly distribute active metals, is widely used for the preparation of metallic catalysts. The type of crystalline phase obtained by this method is dependent on the starting metallic precursor. The doping of catalysts influences the crystalline phase; the La-Mn combination favors the monoclinic structure, while La-Fe doping promotes the tetragonal arrangement. The textural analysis of the catalysts reveals low surface areas but large cavities, which facilitate the transport of reactants and products in the catalytic combustion of trichloroethylene. Among the catalysts tested, La-Fe doped zirconia demonstrated the best performance, especially at high temperatures, due to its dominant tetragonal zirconia phase.

溶胶法因其能够在基体上均匀分布活性金属而受到广泛重视，用于金属催化剂的制备。通过这种方法获得的晶相取决于起始金属前驱体。催化剂的掺杂影响晶相；La-Mn组合有利于单斜晶结构，而La-Fe掺杂促进四方晶排列。催化剂的纹理分析显示低表面积但大孔隙，这有助于三氯乙烯及其燃烧产物在催化测试中的运输。在测试的催化剂中，La-Fe掺杂的锆酸盐表现出最佳性能，尤其是在高温下，这是由于其主导的四方锆酸盐相。
