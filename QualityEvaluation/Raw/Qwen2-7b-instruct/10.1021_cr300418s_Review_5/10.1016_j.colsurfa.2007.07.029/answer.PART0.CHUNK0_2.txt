The solgel method, known for its ability to mix constituents atomically, is widely used for preparing metallic catalysts, resulting in a uniform distribution of active metals on the support. This technique is particularly effective for catalysts that require high surface area and uniform metal dispersion, as demonstrated in the preparation of doped zirconia catalysts for the combustion of trichloroethylene. The solgel method allows for the control of the crystalline phase of zirconia, which affects its catalytic properties. For instance, the combination of lanthanum and manganese favors the formation of the monoclinic phase, while lanthanum and iron favor the tetragonal phase. This study highlights the importance of phase control in achieving optimal catalytic activity. Furthermore, the textural analysis of the catalysts reveals their porous nature, which facilitates the transport of reactants and products, enhancing the catalytic performance in combustion reactions. Despite having lower surface areas, the catalysts demonstrate efficient catalysis due to their large cavity sizes, which aid in the diffusion of reactants and products through the porous structure. Notably, the catalyst doped with lanthanum and iron showed superior performance at high temperatures, indicating the potential of this combination for catalytic applications involving chlorinated compounds.
