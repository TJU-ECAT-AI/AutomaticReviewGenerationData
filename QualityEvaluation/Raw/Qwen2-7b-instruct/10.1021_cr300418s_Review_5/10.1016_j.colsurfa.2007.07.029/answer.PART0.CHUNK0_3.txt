The solgel method is a preferred technique for synthesizing metallic catalysts due to its ability to uniformly distribute active metals on the support at an atomic scale. In the current research, La, Mn, and Fe doped zirconia catalysts were created using this method. The choice of doping metals affects the crystalline phase of the zirconia. Specifically, the La-Mn combination favors the formation of the monoclinic phase, while La-Fe doping promotes the tetragonal structure. The textural analysis revealed that despite having low specific areas, the catalysts possess large cavities that aid in the transport of reactants and products during catalytic combustion. Among the doped catalysts, the La-Fe doped zirconia showed superior performance in the catalytic combustion of trichloroethylene, likely due to the dominance of the tetragonal phase in this material.

溶胶法是合成金属催化剂的一种优选方法，因为它能够在支持物上均匀地分布活性金属。在当前的研究中，通过这种方法制备了镧、锰和铁掺杂的氧化锆催化剂。掺杂金属的选择会影响氧化锆的晶相。具体而言，镧-锰组合倾向于形成单斜晶系，而镧-铁掺杂促进四方晶系的形成。纹理分析显示，尽管样品的比表面积较低，但它们具有较大的空腔，这有助于在催化燃烧过程中运输反应物和产物。在掺杂催化剂中，镧-铁掺杂的氧化锆表现出最佳的三氯乙烯催化燃烧性能，这可能归因于该材料中主导四方晶相的存在。
