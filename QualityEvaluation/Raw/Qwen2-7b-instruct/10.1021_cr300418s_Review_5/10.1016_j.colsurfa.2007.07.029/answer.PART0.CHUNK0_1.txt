The solgel method is used for preparing metallic catalysts due to its ability to mix components at an atomic level, resulting in a uniform distribution of active metals on the support surface. Catalytic combustion is an effective technology for controlling volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and air toxins, offering benefits such as reduced fuel consumption, decreased nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, lower carbon monoxide (CO) and incomplete combustion products (PIC) emissions, and fewer carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions compared to thermal incineration for chlorinated waste management.

溶胶法特别适用于制备金属催化剂，因为它能够在原子尺度上混合成分，从而在支撑表面形成均匀的活性金属分布。催化燃烧是一种有效控制挥发性有机化合物（VOC）和空气污染物的技术，与热焚烧相比，它具有降低燃料消耗（运行成本）、减少氮氧化物（NOx）排放、降低碳氧化合物（CO）和不完全燃烧产物（PIC）排放以及减少二氧化碳（CO2）排放的优点，特别适用于氯化废物管理。

The FT-IR spectra of the samples, in the form of KBr mixed disks, were determined using a Perkin-Elmer Paragon 1000 PC spectrometer. Thermal analyses of the xerogels were car- ried out at in a TA Instruments SDT-2960 thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 C/min in air. Crystalline phase analyses were performed by X-ray powder diffraction using a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu K radiation in the 2θ range 1090. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) photomicrographswereobtainedinaCarlZeissDSM950micro- scope, at 30 kV/50 mA and 9-mm working distance. N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K were measured via an Autosorb-1 volumetric instrument (Quantachrome Co.); prior to the adsorption runs all samples were outgassed overnight at 200 C, the N2 and He gases required by the adsorption instrument were purchased UHP grade.

Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using a Perkin-Elmer Paragon 1000 PC spectrometer for the samples. Thermal analyses were conducted on the xerogels using a TA Instruments SDT-2960 thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10°C/min in air. X-ray powder diffraction analyses were performed with a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer equipped with filtered Cu K radiation in the 2θ range from 10° to 90°. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) photomicrographs were captured using a Carl Zeiss DSM950 microscope at 30 kV, 50 mA, and a 9-mm working distance. Nitrogen (N2) sorption isotherms at 77 K were measured using an Autosorb-1 volumetric instrument from Quantachrome Co., with all samples pre-evacuated at 200°C overnight, and the required N2 and He gases were of Ultra High Purity (UHP) grade.
