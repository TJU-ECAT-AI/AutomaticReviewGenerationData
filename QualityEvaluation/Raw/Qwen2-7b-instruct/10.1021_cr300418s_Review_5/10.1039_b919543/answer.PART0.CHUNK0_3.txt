[1] "Analysing and understanding the active site by IR spectroscopy is a technique particularly adapted for understanding the mechanism of catalytic reactions, being able to probe the surface mechanisms at the molecular level."
[2] "The best examples are probably those given by the zeolites, for which the strong Brnsted-acid sites are often identified through the n(OH) band of hydroxyl groups."
[3] "The best conditions for a study appear to be those during the reaction, i.e. the operando conditions (real in situ);6 we will develop this point towards the end of the review."
[4] "It is much more difficult to detect the presence of alien anionic entities such as sulfur, Cl and F, or cationic species such as alkaline cations in the zeolites, due to the absence of specific bands."
[5] "The direct detection of adsorption sites by IR spectroscopy is often not possible, therefore specific methods must be employed to obtain a spectroscopic response of the sites."
[6] "The choice of the probe molecule is crucial to obtain an overall view of the acidity."
[7] "The case of Brnsted-acid sites is well illustrated by the zeolites or silica, for which the hydroxyl groups can be directly observed through their n(OH) bands."
[8] "In the case of the metal oxides, surface relaxation and reconstruction phenomena might not allow to accurately identify the nature of the Lewis-acid sites (coordination, oxidation degree, unsaturation degree) via the study of spectra after the adsorption of probe molecules."
[9] "Acetonitrile has been increasingly used as an infrared probe molecule for solid catalysts, and might well provide an integrated approach of acidity."
[10] "During molecular dynamics simulations of acetonitrile on mordenites,63 the electric dipole on the molecule was significantly modified in the move from the main channel to the inside of the small lateral cavity."
[11] "Moreover, the probe molecule is locked in the cavity, and does not escape easily. It is thus kept in close distance to the OH group, thus enhancing the probability for the proton transfer."
[12] "The absence of interaction noted during the adsorption of CO on SiO2B2O3 has been explained by its basicity, not strong enough to compensate for the energy required for the conformational change of the B3+ Lewis-acid centre."
[13] "Some simple concepts addressing this problem have also been mentioned by Zecchina et al.66"
[14] "Moreover, both NH3 and pyridine (generally used as probes for the measure of the acidity of catalysts) are also described to adsorb on basic oxides via dissociative chemisorption."
[15] "Basicity is becoming a more and more important parameter, and basic materials are involved in numerous industrial processes, such as fine chemical production via green chemistry routes."
[16] "Moreover, a thorough spectral characterization of KBr-diluted samples indicated that the higher the intensity of unidentate carbonate bands (1499 and 1382 cm1), the higher the sterol ester yield."
[17] "CO and NO can provide highly valuable information on the supported metal dispersion and coordination, as well as on the oxidation degree of such moieties."
[18] "Moreover, carbon monoxide and nitrogen monoxide adsorption can provide very useful information on the coordination mode of such molecules (of primary importance for environmental issues) and on the complexes formed with the metal particles, potential sites for pollutant abatement."
[19] "The formation of Cu+ mono- and dinitrosyls is observable for high temperature (770 K) Cu-ZSM-5 activated under vacuum and Datka et al.93 even reported the possible existence of two distinct Cu+NO species at 1812 and 1825 cm1, associated to two distinct Cu+ sites differing in the density of oxygen packing."

1. Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It can help elucidate the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility. For instance, studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania can reveal details about dopant distribution, interaction with the matrix, and changes in the catalyst's electronic structure upon doping.

2. Insights from Raman spectroscopy can include:
   - Determining the presence and concentration of dopants within the catalyst.
   - Understanding the spatial distribution of dopants and their interaction with the matrix.
   - Identifying changes in the electronic structure of the catalyst upon doping, which can affect its reactivity.
   - Monitoring the in situ behavior of the catalyst under various conditions, such as temperature and gas exposure.
   - Correlating spectral features with specific catalyst properties, such as reducibility, which is crucial for evaluating its performance in catalytic reactions.

These insights can help optimize catalyst design and improve their performance in industrial applications.
