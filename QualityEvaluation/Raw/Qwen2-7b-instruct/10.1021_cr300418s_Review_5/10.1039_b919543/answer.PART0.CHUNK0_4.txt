Introduction Heterogeneous catalysis is finding an increasing importance in everyday life. The industrial heterogeneous catalysts are shaped multifunctional devices intended to offer to the reacting agents a multitude of active sites, distributed on the external surface or inside the porosity of the materials, in order to optimise the contact between the reacting molecule and the transformation centre in the sense of the Sabatiers principle.

On these sites the reacting molecules are adsorbed, the inter- mediates are generated and the products formed. Physically,the active centres are the sites where the reaction crosses the energy barrier, as classically represented in Fig. 1.
Therefore, the active sites are intrinsically linked with the intermediate species and they can be affected by the poisons which can be formed during the reaction. An accurate design of the active sites (in terms of quality, strength, position, . . .) is obviously the key to obtain the optimum catalyst. On the way to catalyst optimisation and rational design, we have to thoroughly characterize the active sites, particularly when in action, considering that they are not static entities, but they undergo modifications depending on the reaction conditions and surface restructuration phenomena.

For this purpose, IR spectroscopy is one of the most adapted tools, being extremely sensitive to the molecular vibrations and able to discriminate the different geometrical distortions of the molecules according to the adsorption state on a site.

The article discusses the importance of heterogeneous catalysis in everyday life and the role of active sites on catalysts. It emphasizes that the active sites are crucial for the efficiency of catalysts, as they are the sites where reactions occur and can be affected by poisons. The article also mentions that active sites are dynamic entities that undergo modifications under different reaction conditions. IR spectroscopy is highlighted as a tool that can effectively characterize these active sites by analyzing molecular vibrations and geometrical distortions caused by adsorption states. The article aims to provide insights into the in-situ characterization of heterogeneous catalysts through the use of IR spectroscopy.
