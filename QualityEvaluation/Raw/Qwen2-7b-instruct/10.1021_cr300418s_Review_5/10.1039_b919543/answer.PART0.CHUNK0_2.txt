[1] "Analyzing and understanding the active site by IR spectroscopy is a technique particularly adapted for understanding the mechanism of catalytic reactions, being able to probe the surface mechanisms at the molecular level."
[2] "The best examples are probably those given by the zeolites, for which the strong Brnsted-acid sites are often identified through the n(OH) band of hydroxyl groups."
[3] "Whatever the probe molecule used, it generates a perturbation of the surface of the catalysts: indirect perturbations such as electron withdrawing effect, or direct perturbations like chemical reactions (protonation, electron transfer, decomposition, . . .)."
[4] "Therefore, it can be concluded that whatever the probe molecule used, the best one is the reactant itself, providing the same perturbation as during the chemical catalytic reaction."
[5] "The best conditions for a study appear to be those during the reaction, i.e. the operando conditions (real in situ);6 we will develop this point towards the end of the review."

IR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for comprehensively understanding catalysts. It allows for the identification of active sites by directly observing their IR fingerprints or by employing probe molecules to interact with the surface. Zeolites are a prime example where strong Brnsted-acid sites are often identified through the n(OH) band of hydroxyl groups. The choice of probe molecule can perturb the surface in various ways, including electron withdrawal or chemical reactions like protonation, electron transfer, or decomposition. The reactant itself is considered the best probe as it provides the same perturbation as during the chemical catalytic reaction. Studying the catalyst under reaction conditions, or operando conditions, is the best scenario for obtaining accurate information on the active sites and their properties.

红外光谱是一种特别适合理解催化反应机制的技术，能够对表面过程进行分子级别的探测。对于沸石来说，强Brnsted酸位点通常通过羟基团的n(OH)带被识别。所选探针分子可以以电子抽取效应或化学反应（如质子化、电子转移、分解等）的方式扰动催化剂表面。反应物本身被认为是最理想的探针，因为它提供与化学催化反应过程中相同的扰动。在反应条件下，即操作条件下研究催化剂是获取活性位点及其性质的最准确方法。

[1] "Deuteration of the surface OH groups is only possible if they are accessible to the deuterated molecule used for the exchange."
[2] "An accessibility index (ACI) was derived from infrared spectroscopy of substituted alkylpyridines with different sizes (pyridine: 0.57 nm, 2,6-lutidine: 0.67 nm, collidine: 0.74 nm) over hierarchical ZSM-5 crystals."
[3] "The enhanced accessibility of acid sites in the hierarchical zeolites was shown."
[4] "A relatively bulky molecule such as collidine, which probes practically no acid sites of the parent medium-pore MFI structure, can access up to 40% of the Brnsted sites in the mesoporous sample."
[5] "The ACI is a powerful tool to standardize acid site accessibility in zeolites and can be used to rank the effectiveness of synthetic strategies towards hierarchical zeolites (mesoporous crystals, nanocrystals, and composites)."

Deuterating surface OH groups is feasible only if they are accessible to the deuterated molecule utilized in the exchange process. An accessibility index (ACI) was calculated using infrared spectroscopy on substituted alkylpyridines with varying sizes (pyridine: 0.57 nm, 2,6-lutidine: 0.67 nm, collidine: 0.74 nm) over hierarchical ZSM-5 crystals. It was demonstrated that there is enhanced accessibility of acidic sites in hierarchical zeolites. A relatively large molecule like collidine, which detects almost no acid sites in the parent medium-pore MFI structure, can access up to 40% of the Brnsted sites in the mesoporous sample. The ACI serves as a potent tool to standardize acid site accessibility in zeolites, enabling the evaluation and ranking of synthetic approaches towards hierarchical zeolites (mesoporous crystals, nanocrystals, and composites).

如果表面OH基团可被用于交换的氘化分子访问，则可以对其进行氘化。计算了不同大小（吡啶：0.57 nm，2,6-二甲基吡啶：0.67 nm，二苯胺：0.74 nm）的取代烷基吡啶的红外光谱，以确定在分层ZSM-5晶体上的访问性指数（ACI）。研究表明，分层沸石中的酸性位点具有增强的可接近性。相对较大的分子如二苯胺，它检测到几乎没有任何酸性位点在亲本中孔MFI结构中，可以在微孔样品中访问高达40%的Brnsted位点。ACI是一个强大的工具，用于标准化沸石中的酸位点可接近性，并可用于评估合成策略对分层沸石（微晶、纳米晶和复合材料）的有效性进行排名。
