[1] "The role of the pores was demonstrated for the protection of small particles during ageing of the catalyst, and sintering was limited by the pore diameter where the particle was located."
[2] "Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) allows monitoring weight changes in the sample. It has been combined with IR to give new information on surface sites."
[3] "Combined thermogravimetry and IR was also applied to operando conditions, and denoted as AGIR (Analysis by Gravimetry and IR): a modified microbalance was used to follow mass changes (mg accuracy) inside a catalytic reactor equipped with infrared windows."
[4] "Other coupled techniques. As we have mentioned in the introduction, the purpose of this review is to critically discuss the characterization of the active site in catalytical processes by using IR analysis compared with catalytic tests."
[5] "The presence of co-adsorbed species (water in particular) strongly modifies the spectrum of surface species. Under reaction condition, this new technique is especially important for a correct assignment of infrared features and catalytic behaviour, and above all it makes IR measurements really quantitative."
[6] "Operando often leads to large amounts of data, and the eye might not spot meaningful small band variations, especially when the species detected is not expected from the known reaction mechanism."

1. The pores protect small particles during the catalyst aging process and limit sintering to the pore diameter where the particle is located.
2. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) monitors weight changes in the sample and provides new information on surface sites when combined with IR analysis.
3. Combined thermogravimetry and IR analysis under operational conditions, named AGIR, uses a modified microbalance to track mass changes in a catalytic reactor with infrared windows.
4. Coupled techniques are essential for enhancing insight into material local properties, reaction events, and nano-scale phenomena in catalytic processes.
5. The presence of co-adsorbed species, particularly water, significantly alters the spectrum of surface species. This technique is crucial for accurately assigning infrared features and understanding catalytic behavior under reaction conditions, making IR measurements quantitatively accurate.
6. Operando spectroscopy often generates vast amounts of data, necessitating advanced data treatment methods like 2D correlation spectroscopy or chemometric techniques to identify meaningful variations in the infrared spectra.
