How does Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contribute to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts, particularly in terms of their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity, and what insights can it provide about the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility, as exemplified by studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania?

The most natural technique to associate with IR is certainly Raman, to cover the totality of the vibrational spectrum. The first in situ Raman and FTIR spectroscopic characterization of a catalytic system under reaction conditions using a single bench-top instrument with a dedicated cell was published in 2003 by Payen et al.116 Following both the evolution of the molecular structure of the active phase by Raman spectroscopy and the nature of the different surface adsorbed species by IR and Raman spectroscopy during deNOx reaction they were able to provide an exhaustive identification of the adsorbed species and the corresponding coordination sites.

Raman spectroscopy, when combined with other analytical techniques such as FTIR, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It enables in situ analysis under reaction conditions, providing insights into the molecular structure of the active phase and the nature of surface adsorbed species. For instance, Payen et al. (2003) used a single bench-top instrument equipped with a dedicated cell to perform in situ Raman and FTIR spectroscopic characterization of a catalytic system undergoing deNOx reaction. By tracking the evolution of the molecular structure of the active phase through Raman spectroscopy and identifying the different surface adsorbed species via IR and Raman spectroscopy, they were able to provide a detailed identification of the adsorbed species and their corresponding coordination sites. This demonstrates how Raman spectroscopy complements other techniques, offering a holistic view of the catalyst's properties and reactivity.

与FTIR等其他分析技术结合，拉曼光谱在复杂催化剂体系的全面表征和理解中发挥着重要作用。它允许在反应条件下进行原位分析，提供活性相分子结构的变化信息以及表面吸附物种的性质。例如，Payen等人（2003）使用配备专用细胞的单台桌面仪器，对进行脱NOx反应的催化系统进行了在位的拉曼和FTIR光谱表征。通过监测活性相分子结构随时间的变化并利用拉曼和红外光谱确定不同表面吸附物种，他们能够详细地识别吸附物种及其相应的配位位置。这表明拉曼光谱与其他技术相结合，可以提供催化剂性质和反应性的全面视角。
