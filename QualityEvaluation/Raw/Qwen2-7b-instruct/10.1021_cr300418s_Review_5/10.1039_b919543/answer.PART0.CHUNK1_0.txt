How does Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contribute to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts, particularly in terms of their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity, and what insights can it provide about the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility, as exemplified by studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania?

The first in situ Raman and FTIR spectroscopic characterization of a catalytic system under reaction conditions using a single bench-top instrument with a dedicated cell was published in 2003 by Payen et al.116 Following both the evolution of the molecular structure of the active phase by Raman spectroscopy and the nature of the different surface adsorbed species by IR and Raman spectroscopy during deNOx reaction they were able to provide an exhaustive identification of the adsorbed species and the corresponding coordination sites.

Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with other analytical techniques, provides insights into the comprehensive characterization of doped catalysts. It contributes to understanding the composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity of catalysts. Payen et al. demonstrated the use of Raman spectroscopy in combination with FTIR in 2003 to characterize a catalytic system under reaction conditions. By following the evolution of the molecular structure of the active phase with Raman spectroscopy and identifying the nature of different surface adsorbed species using both Raman and IR spectroscopy during a deNOx reaction, they were able to provide a detailed identification of the adsorbed species and their corresponding coordination sites. This technique enables a better understanding of the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties, such as reducibility.

与其它分析技术结合，拉曼光谱为掺杂催化剂的全面表征提供了见解。它有助于理解催化剂的组成、结构、原位行为和反应性。Payen等人在2003年证明了使用拉曼光谱与FTIR结合，在反应条件下对催化系统进行表征。通过跟踪活性相分子结构随时间的变化，并利用Raman和IR光谱在脱硝反应过程中识别不同表面吸附物种的性质，他们能够提供详细的吸附物种及其相应配位位置的识别。这种方法使我们更好地理解了光谱特征与催化剂属性（如还原性）之间的关系。
