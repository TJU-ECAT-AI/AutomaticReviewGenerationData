[1] "The role of the pores was demonstrated for the protection of small particles during ageing of the catalyst, and sintering was limited by the pore diameter where the particle was located."
[2] "Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) allows monitoring weight changes in the sample. It has been combined with IR to give new information on surface sites."
[3] "Combined thermogravimetry and IR was also applied to operando conditions, and denoted as AGIR (Analysis by Gravimetry and IR): a modified microbalance was used to follow mass changes (mg accuracy) inside a catalytic reactor equipped with infrared windows."
[4] "Adsorption sites change with coverage, and bands are shifted and their shape and intensity are modified."
[5] "Under reaction condition, this new technique is especially important for a correct assignment of infrared features and catalytic behaviour, and above all it makes IR measurements really quantitative."
