Introduction Heterogeneous catalysis is finding an increasing importance in everyday life. The industrial heterogeneous catalysts are shaped multifunctional devices intended to offer to the reacting agents a multitude of active sites, distributed on the external surface or inside the porosity of the materials, in order to optimise the contact between the reacting molecule and the transformation centre in the sense of the Sabatiers principle.

On these sites the reacting molecules are adsorbed, the inter- mediates are generated and the products formed. Physically,the active centres are the sites where the reaction crosses the energy barrier, as classically represented in Fig. 1.

Therefore, the active sites are intrinsically linked with the intermediate species and they can be affected by the poisons which can be formed during the reaction. An accurate design of the active sites (in terms of quality, strength, position, . . .) is obviously the key to obtain the optimum catalyst. On the way to catalyst optimisation and rational design, we have to thoroughly characterize the active sites, particularly when in action, considering that they are not static entities, but they undergo modifications depending on the reaction conditions and surface restructuration phenomena.

For this purpose, IR spectroscopy is one of the most adapted tools, being extremely sensitive to the molecular vibrations and able to discriminate the different geometrical distortions of the molecules according to the adsorption state on a site.

In this contribution, we will present how it is possible to evidence the adsorption sites on a catalyst, particularly using Laboratoire Catalyse et Spectrochimie, ENSICAEN, Universite de Caen, CNRS, 6 Bd Mare chal Juin, F-14050 Caen, France.

Alexandre Vimont Alexandre Vimont (born 1972, France) received his PhD in 2000 from the University of Caen in the field of in situ and operando infrared spectro- scopy applied to catalysis,under the supervision of Jean- Claude Lavalley and Fre deric Thibaut-Starzyk.

He then joined the laboratoire Catalyse et Spectrochimie as a permanent CNRS research engineer. His current research interests focus on the comprehension at the molecular scale of the adsorp- tion sites in acid materials and in particular in metal organic frameworks, using in situ and operando Infrared spectroscopy.

Fre de ric Thibault-Starzyk Fre de ric Thibault-Starzyk was born in Saint-Lo (France) in 1965. He received his PhD
in synthetic organic chemistry in 1992 from the University of Caen.

After post-doctoral work with Pierre Jacobs at the University of Leuven, he became Charge de Recherche (1995) and Director of Research in the CNRS (2009) at the Catalysis and Spectrochemistry Laboratory. In 20034, he was an overseas fellow, Churchill College, working with David King at the Chemistry Depart- ment, University of Cambridge. His research interests are in heterogeneous catalysis and infrared spectroscopy, including operando spectroscopy, time resolved measurements, and new spectroscopic approaches for the characterisation of solids and zeolites.

This article discusses the use of infrared spectroscopy in analyzing and understanding the active sites of heterogeneous catalysts. It explains that the active sites on the catalyst surfaces are linked to the intermediates and can be affected by poisons that may form during reactions. The article also mentions that the active sites are not static and can change based on reaction conditions and surface restructuration phenomena. The authors emphasize the importance of thoroughly characterizing these active sites during the reaction, as they play a key role in catalyst optimization and rational design. The Laboratoire Catalyse et Spectrochimie, ENSICAEN, Université de Caen, CNRS, in France, is highlighted as a center that uses in situ and operando infrared spectroscopy to understand the adsorption sites on catalysts, focusing on acid materials and metal organic frameworks.

[1] "Analyzing and understanding the active site by IR spectroscopy is a technique particularly adapted for understanding the mechanism of catalytic reactions, being able to probe the surface mechanisms at the molecular level."
[2] "The best examples are probably those given by the zeolites, for which the strong Brnsted-acid sites are often identified through the n(OH) band of hydroxyl groups."
[3] "Whatever the probe molecule used, it generates a perturbation of the surface of the catalysts: indirect perturbations such as electron withdrawing effect, or direct perturbations like chemical reactions (protonation, electron transfer, decomposition, . . .)."
[4] "Therefore, it can be concluded that whatever the probe molecule used, the best one is the reactant itself, providing the same perturbation as during the chemical catalytic reaction."

IR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for comprehensively understanding catalysts. It allows for the identification of active sites by directly observing their IR fingerprints or by employing probe molecules to interact with the surface. Zeolites are a prime example where strong Brnsted-acid sites are often identified through the n(OH) band of hydroxyl groups. The choice of probe molecule can perturb the surface in various ways, including electron withdrawal or chemical reactions like protonation, electron transfer, or decomposition. The reactant itself is considered the best probe as it provides the same perturbation as during the chemical catalytic reaction. Studying the catalyst under reaction conditions, or operando conditions, is the best scenario for obtaining accurate information on the active sites and their properties.

Introduction Heterogeneous catalysis is finding an increasing importance in everyday life. The industrial heterogeneous catalysts are shaped multifunctional devices intended to offer to the reacting agents a multitude of active sites, distributed on the external surface or inside the porosity of the materials, in order to optimise the contact between the reacting molecule and the transformation centre in the sense of the Sabatiers principle.

On these sites the reacting molecules are adsorbed, the inter- mediates are generated and the products formed. Physically,the active centres are the sites where the reaction crosses the energy barrier, as classically represented in Fig. 1.
Therefore, the active sites are intrinsically linked with the intermediate species and they can be affected by the poisons which can be formed during the reaction. An accurate design of the active sites (in terms of quality, strength, position, . . .) is obviously the key to obtain the optimum catalyst. On the way to catalyst optimisation and rational design, we have to thoroughly characterize the active sites, particularly when in action, considering that they are not static entities, but they undergo modifications depending on the reaction conditions and surface restructuration phenomena.

For this purpose, IR spectroscopy is one of the most adapted tools, being extremely sensitive to the molecular vibrations and able to discriminate the different geometrical distortions of the molecules according to the adsorption state on a site.

The article discusses the importance of heterogeneous catalysis in everyday life and the role of active sites on catalysts. It emphasizes that the active sites are crucial for the efficiency of catalysts, as they are the sites where reactions occur and can be affected by poisons. The article also mentions that active sites are dynamic entities that undergo modifications under different reaction conditions. IR spectroscopy is highlighted as a tool that can effectively characterize these active sites by analyzing molecular vibrations and geometrical distortions caused by adsorption states. The article aims to provide insights into the in-situ characterization of heterogeneous catalysts through the use of IR spectroscopy.
