How does Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contribute to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts, particularly in terms of their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity, and what insights can it provide about the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility, as exemplified by studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania?

The first in situ Raman and FTIR spectroscopic characterization of a catalytic system under reaction conditions using a single bench-top instrument with a dedicated cell was published in 2003 by Payen et al.116 Following both the evolution of the molecular structure of the active phase by Raman spectroscopy and the nature of the different surface adsorbed species by IR and Raman spectroscopy during deNOx reaction they were able to provide an exhaustive identification of the adsorbed species and the corresponding coordination sites.
Similar information can also be obtained by coupling DRIFT with hard X-ray diffraction, which can highlight phenomena taking place in nanoparticulate catalysts, such as the formation of simultaneous surface and bulk species and their evolution.117 Also combining, at high time resolution, a transmission based structural probes, dispersive EXAFS, with diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy, can highlight fundamental steps occurring during gassolid interactions, like that of oxidation and reduction of alumina-supported Rh at 573 K using NO and H2, and the structuralreactive role of linear Rh-nitrosyl species within these processes.118

Raman spectroscopy, when coupled with other analytical techniques like FTIR and DRIFT, provides comprehensive insights into the characterization of doped catalysts. It enables detailed examination of the molecular structure of the active phase and the nature of surface adsorbed species during catalytic reactions, as demonstrated in studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania. This allows for an exhaustive identification of adsorbed species and their coordination sites. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy can be combined with hard X-ray diffraction to elucidate phenomena occurring in nanoparticulate catalysts, such as the simultaneous formation of surface and bulk species and their evolution. Additionally, integrating Raman spectroscopy with structural probes like dispersive EXAFS and diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy can reveal fundamental steps in gas-solid interactions, such as the oxidation and reduction of alumina-supported Rh at 573 K using NO and H2, and the reactive role of linear Rh-nitrosyl species in these processes.

当与FTIR和DRIFT等其他分析技术结合使用时，拉曼光谱为掺杂催化剂的全面表征提供了深入的见解。它能够详细检查活性相的分子结构和表面吸附物种的性质，在催化反应期间，如在Ce掺杂CoCr2O4和碱金属掺杂二氧化钛的研究中已经得到证明。这使得对吸附物种及其配位位置进行详尽的识别成为可能。此外，将拉曼光谱与硬X射线衍射相结合，可以揭示纳米粒子催化剂中发生的现象，如表面和本体物种的同时形成及其演变。进一步地，将拉曼光谱与结构探针如分散EXAFS和漫反射红外光谱结合，可以揭示气体-固体相互作用的基本步骤，如在573 K下使用NO和H2氧化和还原Al2O3支持的Rh，并且在此过程中线性Rh硝基物种的反应角色。
