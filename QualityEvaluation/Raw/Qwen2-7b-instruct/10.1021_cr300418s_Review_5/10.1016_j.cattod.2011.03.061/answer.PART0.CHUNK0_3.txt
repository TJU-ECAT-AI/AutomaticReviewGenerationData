"Keywords: Methane combustion Cobalt chromite Cerium Structure deformation"
"The characterization results indicated that cerium doping could deform the spinel structure and cause redistribution of metal ions with different oxidation states; consequently, they would increase crystal defects and oxygen vacancy concentration, which facilitate oxygen mobility and thus increase the catalytic performance of cerium modified cobalt chromite catalysts."
"In this study, cerium modified cobalt chromite catalysts with different cerium content were prepared by co-precipitation method and the catalytic activities were evaluated towards methane combustion."

Raman spectroscopy, combined with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It can offer detailed information about the spectral features of cerium-doped cobalt chromite catalysts, revealing how the doping affects the material's properties. Specifically, it aids in understanding the relationship between the spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility. By studying the spectral changes upon doping, researchers can gain insights into how cerium modifies the spinel structure, redistributes metal ions, increases crystal defects, and enhances oxygen vacancy concentration, thereby improving the catalyst's performance in methane combustion.
