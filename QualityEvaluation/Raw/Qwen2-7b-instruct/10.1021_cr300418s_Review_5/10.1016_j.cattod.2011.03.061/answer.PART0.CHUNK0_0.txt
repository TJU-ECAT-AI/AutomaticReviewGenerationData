Catalytic combustion of methane over cerium-doped cobalt chromite catalysts was investigated. Characterization studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, BET, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction mass spectroscopy (CH4 TPR-MS), and temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD) were carried out. An improvement of the catalytic activity was observed over cerium-substituted cobalt chromite catalysts with appropriate cerium substitution degrees. The best result has been attained with 5% cerium modified catalyst, for which 5% chromium in CoCr2O4 was substituted by cerium, and the catalytic activity reached 90% of methane conversion at 465°C. The characterization results indicated that cerium doping could deform the spinel structure and cause redistribution of metal ions with different oxidation states; consequently, they would increase crystal defects and oxygen vacancy concentration, which facilitate oxygen mobility and thus increase the catalytic performance of cerium modified cobalt chromite catalysts.

The study demonstrates that cerium doping in cobalt chromite catalysts leads to improved catalytic activity for methane combustion. Specifically, the best performance is achieved with a 5% cerium substitution, resulting in 90% methane conversion at 465°C. This enhancement is attributed to the structural changes caused by cerium doping, which alters the spinel structure, redistributes metal ions, increases crystal defects, and oxygen vacancy concentration. These modifications enhance oxygen mobility, thereby boosting the catalytic performance of the cerium-modified cobalt chromite catalysts.

研究显示，铈掺杂在钴铬酸盐催化剂中导致甲烷燃烧催化活性的改善。具体而言，在5%铈替换下达到最佳性能，使得465°C时的甲烷转化率达到90%。这种增强归因于铈掺杂引起的结构变化，这些变化改变了立方体结构，重新分布了金属离子，增加了晶格缺陷和氧空位浓度。这些修改增强了氧的流动性，从而提高了铈改性钴铬酸盐催化剂的催化性能。
