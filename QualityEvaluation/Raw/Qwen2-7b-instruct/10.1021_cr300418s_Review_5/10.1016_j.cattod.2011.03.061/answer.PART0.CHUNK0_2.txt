[1] "The characterization results indicated that cerium doping could deform the spinel structure and cause redistribution of metal ions with different oxidation states; consequently, they would increase crystal defects and oxygen vacancy concentration, which facilitate oxygen mobility and thus increase the catalytic performance of cerium modified cobalt chromite catalysts."
[2] "The above has been exploited in several investigations so as to synthesize better combustion catalysts."
[3] "In this study, cerium modified cobalt chromite catalysts with different cerium content were prepared by co-precipitation method and the catalytic activities were evaluated towards methane combustion."
[4] "The reducibility was studied by CH4 TPR-MS."
[5] "The oxygen desorption behavior was studied by O2-TPD."
[6] "The chemical states and surface composition has been analyzed using XPS."
