[1] "Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited to study supported oxides since most oxides employed as support materials are not Raman active (Al2O3), give rise to only very weak Raman bands (SiO2) or do not exhibit intense Raman bands above 700 cm1 (e.g., ZrO2, TiO2, Nb2O5, Ta2O5, SnO2, Fe2O3, etc.) that can interfere with the most informative Raman modes for the supported oxide catalysts [717,34,74]."
[2] "This observation suggests that highly dispersed supported metal oxide catalytic systems are probably excellent models for the corresponding bulk mixed metal oxide systems."
[3] "Several recent investigations are beginning to reveal that the surface composition of many mixed metal oxide catalytic systems may also be very different than the bulk lattice composition [77,8487]."

Raman spectroscopy, when combined with other analytical techniques, contributes significantly to the characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It provides insights into the composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity of these catalysts. Specifically, it helps elucidate the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility. By studying Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania, Raman spectroscopy reveals that highly dispersed supported metal oxide catalytic systems are likely to serve as excellent models for corresponding bulk mixed metal oxide systems. Moreover, recent investigations indicate that the surface composition of many mixed metal oxide catalytic systems might differ significantly from their bulk lattice composition, offering a more nuanced understanding of these complex materials.

拉曼光谱，结合其他分析技术，对掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了重要贡献。它为这些催化剂的组成、结构、原位行为和反应性提供了见解，并有助于理解光谱特征与催化剂性质（如还原性）之间的关系。通过研究Ce掺杂CoCr2O4和碱金属掺杂的氧化钒在二氧化钛上的情况，拉曼光谱揭示了高度分散的支撑金属氧化物催化系统可能是对应块状混合金属氧化物系统的优秀模型。此外，最近的研究表明，许多混合金属氧化物催化体系的表面组成可能与它们的晶格组成有很大不同，这为这些复杂材料提供了一种更精细的理解。
