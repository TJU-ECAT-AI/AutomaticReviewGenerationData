[1] "Among all the available spectroscopic techniques, Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited for in situ studies since there is negligible interference from the gas phase due to the weak light scattering from the low density of molecules in the gas or vapor phase."
[2] "Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited to study supported oxides since most oxides employed as support materials are not Raman active (Al2O3), give rise to only very weak Raman bands (SiO2) or do not exhibit intense Raman bands above 700 cm1 (e.g., ZrO2, TiO2, Nb2O5, Ta2O5, SnO2, Fe2O3, etc.) that can interfere with the most informative Raman modes for the supported oxide catalysts."
[3] "The Raman information about the supported metal oxide is directly relevant to the catalytic reaction."
[4] "An operando Raman-GC case study nicely demonstrates the potential of the operando methodology to follow the genesis of the active catalyst under reaction conditions and, thus, directly establish links between catalyst structure and activity/selectivity during reaction conditions."

Raman spectroscopy, when combined with other analytical techniques, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It provides insights into the catalyst's composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. By focusing on the weak light scattering from the low density of molecules in the gas or vapor phase, Raman spectroscopy minimizes interference from the gas phase, making it suitable for in situ studies. It is particularly suited for studying supported oxides, as these materials often give rise to only very weak Raman bands that do not interfere with the most informative Raman modes for supported oxide catalysts. The Raman information obtained from the supported metal oxide is directly relevant to the catalytic reaction. In operando Raman-GC studies, Raman spectroscopy has demonstrated the capability to follow the genesis of the active catalyst under reaction conditions, thereby establishing direct links between the catalyst's structure and activity/selectivity during reaction conditions. This combination of techniques provides detailed electronic and molecular structural insights into the nature of surface catalytic active sites, surface reaction intermediates, and their adsorption sites on the catalyst.

Raman光谱技术与其它分析技术相结合，在深入理解掺杂催化剂的组成、结构、原位行为和反应性方面起着关键作用。它为了解催化剂提供了深入的见解，包括其成分、结构、在反应条件下的行为以及反应活性。通过关注气体或蒸汽相中分子密度低导致的微弱散射光，Raman光谱技术可以最小化气体相干扰，使其特别适合于原位研究。对于作为支撑材料使用的大多数氧化物而言，它们往往只产生非常弱的Raman带，这些带不会干扰支持氧化物催化剂的最相关信息。从支持金属氧化物获得的Raman信息直接与催化反应相关。在原位Raman-GC研究中，Raman光谱技术已经证明了能够跟踪活性催化剂在反应条件下的生成过程，从而直接建立催化剂结构与反应条件下的活性/选择性之间的联系。这种技术组合提供了关于表面催化活性位点、表面反应中间体及其吸附位点在催化剂上的详细电子和分子结构的深入见解。
