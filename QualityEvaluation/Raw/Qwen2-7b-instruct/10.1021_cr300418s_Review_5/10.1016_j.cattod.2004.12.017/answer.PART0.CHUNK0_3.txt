[1] "Among all the available spectroscopic techniques, Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited for in situ studies since there is negligible interference from the gas phase due to the weak light scattering from the low density of molecules in the gas or vapor phase."
[2] "The Raman spectra may be acquired over a wide range of sample temperature (from at least liquid He and N2 to 1300 °C) and pressure (vacuum to several atmospheres)."
[3] "Visible excitation (typically, from 488 to 633 nm) is mostly employed and the convenient optical arrangements of current Raman systems allow for the design of environmental catalytic reactor cells that perform similarly to conventional catalytic reactors during the operando spectroscopic studies."
[4] "Therefore, Raman spectra can be collected during catalytic operation to provide molecular level insight into the structureactivity/selectivity relationships of catalytic active sites and the associated surface intermediates when present."
[5] "In addition, the selection of the specific catalytic reaction system and the spectroscopic technique will also have a major impact on the relevance of the electronic and molecular structure information that can be obtained with operando spectroscopy investigations."
[6] "For instance, the presence of reduced oxidation states of supported oxides during reaction cannot always be clearly established with Raman spectroscopy measurements."
[7] "Combination of UV-vis-DRS and Raman spectroscopy, however, provide better understanding of oxidation states of supported vanadium oxide catalysts at different surface coverage, on different oxide supports and with different hydrocarbons."
[8] "Combined Raman and UV-vis-DRS also allows for correction of Raman signal intensity as well as information on the oxidation states of supported oxide catalysts during non-oxidative dehydrogenation conditions."
[9] "The combined use of IR and Raman also provides information about the nature of chemisorbed species and the catalytic active sites during reaction conditions."
[10] "Thus, the combined use of several complementary techniques affords more detailed electronic and molecular structural insights into the nature of surface catalytic active sites as well as surface reaction intermediates and their adsorption sites on the catalyst."

Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. Specifically:

1. Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited for in situ studies due to its minimal interference from the gas phase, allowing for acquisition over a wide range of temperatures and pressures.
2. It enables the collection of Raman spectra during catalytic operations, offering molecular-level insights into the structureactivity/selectivity relationships of catalytic active sites and surface intermediates.
3. The selection of the specific catalytic reaction system and spectroscopic technique influences the relevance of the electronic and molecular structure information obtained through operando spectroscopy.
4. Techniques like UV-vis-DRS complement Raman spectroscopy, providing better understanding of oxidation states of supported oxides under various conditions.
5. Combined use of Raman and UV-vis-DRS corrects Raman signal intensity and offers information on supported oxide catalysts' oxidation states during non-oxidative dehydrogenation conditions.
6. Integration of Raman spectroscopy with IR spectroscopy provides information on chemisorbed species and catalytic active sites during reaction conditions.
7. The combination of multiple complementary techniques yields more detailed electronic and molecular structural insights into the nature of surface catalytic active sites, surface reaction intermediates, and their adsorption sites on the catalyst.

In summary, Raman spectroscopy, when paired with other analytical methods, facilitates a deep understanding of doped catalysts' properties and behaviors by offering insights into their structure, reactivity, and composition under real-time reaction conditions.
