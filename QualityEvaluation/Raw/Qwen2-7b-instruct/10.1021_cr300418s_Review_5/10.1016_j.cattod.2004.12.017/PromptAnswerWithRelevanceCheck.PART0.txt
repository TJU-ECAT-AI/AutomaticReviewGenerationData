[1] "Among all the available spectroscopic techniques, Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited for in situ studies since there is negligible interference from the gas phase due to the weak light scattering from the low density of molecules in the gas or vapor phase."
[2] "Visible excitation (typically, from 488 to 633 nm) is mostly employed and the convenient optical arrangements of current Raman systems allow for the design of environmental catalytic reactor cells that perform similarly to conventional catalytic reactors during the operando spectroscopic studies."
[3] "Therefore, Raman spectra can be collected during catalytic operation to provide molecular level insight into the structureactivity/selectivity relationships of catalytic active sites and the associated surface intermediates when present."
[4] "Operando Raman-GC case study is presented along with consideration of the methodology, spectroscopy and samples."

Raman spectroscopy, when combined with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. Specifically, it enables the examination of spectral features that relate to the reducibility of the catalysts. For instance, in studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania, Raman spectroscopy helps elucidate the nature of surface catalytic active sites, surface reaction intermediates, and their adsorption sites on the catalysts. This is achieved through the analysis of spectral features that indicate the presence of specific oxidation states or structural changes in the doped catalysts during reaction conditions. By correlating these spectral features with the catalyst properties, Raman spectroscopy aids in establishing a clear link between the structure and reactivity of doped catalysts, contributing significantly to a deeper understanding of their behavior under operational conditions.

Raman spectroscopy, when combined with other analytical techniques, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It provides insights into the catalyst's composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. By focusing on the weak light scattering from the low density of molecules in the gas or vapor phase, Raman spectroscopy minimizes interference from the gas phase, making it suitable for in situ studies. It is particularly suited for studying supported oxides, as these materials often give rise to only very weak Raman bands that do not interfere with the most informative Raman modes for supported oxide catalysts. The Raman information obtained from the supported metal oxide is directly relevant to the catalytic reaction. In operando Raman-GC studies, Raman spectroscopy has demonstrated the capability to follow the genesis of the active catalyst under reaction conditions, thereby establishing direct links between the catalyst's structure and activity/selectivity during reaction conditions. This combination of techniques provides detailed electronic and molecular structural insights into the nature of surface catalytic active sites, surface reaction intermediates, and their adsorption sites on the catalyst.
