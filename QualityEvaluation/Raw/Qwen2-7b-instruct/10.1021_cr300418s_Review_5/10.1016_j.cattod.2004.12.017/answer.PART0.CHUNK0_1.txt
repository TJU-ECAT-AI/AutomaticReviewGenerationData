[1] "Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited for in situ studies since there is negligible interference from the gas phase due to the weak light scattering from the low density of molecules in the gas or vapor phase."
[2] "Raman spectra may be acquired over a wide range of sample temperature (from at least liquid He and N2 to 1300 °C) [36,37] and pressure (vacuum to several atmospheres)."
[3] "Visible excitation (typically, from 488 to 633 nm) is mostly employed and the convenient optical arrangements of current Raman systems allow for the design of environmental catalytic reactor cells that perform similarly to conventional catalytic reactors during the operando spectroscopic studies."
[4] "Therefore, Raman spectra can be collected during catalytic operation to provide molecular level insight into the structureactivity/selectivity relationships of catalytic active sites and the associated surface intermediates when present."
[5] "Operando Raman-GC case study nicely demonstrates the capabilities of operando Raman-GC, but each spectroscopic technique provides a piece of electronic and molecular structural information of the catalytic materials and the influence of the catalytic reaction environments."
[6] "Combined Raman and UVvis-DRS also allows for correction of Raman signal intensity as well as information on the oxidation states of supported oxide catalysts during non-oxidative dehydrogenation conditions [8,103]."

Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It allows for the examination of spectral features that relate to catalyst properties such as reducibility. For instance, in the operando Raman-GC study on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania, Raman spectroscopy provided molecular-level insights into the structureactivity/selectivity relationships of the catalytic active sites and surface intermediates. Additionally, the combination of Raman spectroscopy with UVvis-DRS and other techniques can offer corrections to Raman signal intensity and information on the oxidation states of supported oxide catalysts, enhancing the understanding of their behavior under different conditions.

拉曼光谱与其它分析技术相结合，为掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了贡献，提供了关于其组成、结构、原位行为和活性的信息。它允许对与催化剂性质如还原性相关的光谱特征进行检查。例如，在Ce掺杂CoCr2O4和碱金属掺杂二氧化钒在二氧化钛上的操作研究中，拉曼光谱提供了关于催化活性中心和表面中间体的分子级见解。此外，拉曼光谱与其他技术（如UVvis-DRS）的结合可以提供对支持氧化物催化剂信号强度的校正和非氧化脱氢条件下的氧化状态信息，从而增强在不同条件下对其行为的理解。
