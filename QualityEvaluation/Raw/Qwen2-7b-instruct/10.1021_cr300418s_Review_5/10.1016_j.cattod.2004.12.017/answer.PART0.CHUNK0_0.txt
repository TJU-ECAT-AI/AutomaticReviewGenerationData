[1] "Among all the available spectroscopic techniques, Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited for in situ studies since there is negligible interference from the gas phase due to the weak light scattering from the low density of molecules in the gas or vapor phase."
[2] "Visible excitation (typically, from 488 to 633 nm) is mostly employed and the convenient optical arrangements of current Raman systems allow for the design of environmental catalytic reactor cells that perform similarly to conventional catalytic reactors during the operando spectroscopic studies."
[3] "Therefore, Raman spectra can be collected during catalytic operation to provide molecular level insight into the structureactivity/selectivity relationships of catalytic active sites and the associated surface intermediates when present."
[4] "Operando Raman-GC case study is presented along with consideration of the methodology, spectroscopy and samples."

Raman spectroscopy, when combined with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. Specifically, it enables the examination of spectral features that relate to the reducibility of the catalysts. For instance, in studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania, Raman spectroscopy helps elucidate the nature of surface catalytic active sites, surface reaction intermediates, and their adsorption sites on the catalysts. This is achieved through the analysis of spectral features that indicate the presence of specific oxidation states or structural changes in the doped catalysts during reaction conditions. By correlating these spectral features with the catalyst properties, Raman spectroscopy aids in establishing a clear link between the structure and reactivity of doped catalysts, contributing significantly to a deeper understanding of their behavior under operational conditions.

拉曼光谱与其他分析技术相结合，对于了解掺杂催化剂的组成、结构、原位行为和反应性具有重要作用。具体而言，它允许通过研究与催化剂可还原性相关的光谱特征来深入了解催化剂。例如，在Ce掺杂CoCr2O4和碱金属掺杂氧化钒在二氧化钛上的研究中，拉曼光谱有助于揭示表面催化活性位点、表面反应中间体及其在催化剂上的吸附位置的性质。通过分析表征特定氧化态或结构变化的光谱特征，拉曼光谱帮助建立掺杂催化剂在反应条件下的结构与活性之间的明确联系，显著促进了对这些催化剂行为的深入理解。
