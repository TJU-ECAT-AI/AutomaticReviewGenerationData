1. Figure 3 presents the H2-TPR profiles for NiO and NiZrO nanoparticles with varying Zr contents.
2. The O1s spectra of NiO nanoparticles displayed a primary peak at 528.8 eV, which shifted to 529.6 eV for 75% NiZrO, nearing the ZrO2 value (529.7 eV).
3. The Ni2p3/2 spectra revealed two distinct peaks at around 853.4 and 855.3 eV, with a shakeup satellite at 860.5 eV, indicative of Ni2+ and Ni3+ species.
4. As Zr content increased, the Ni2p3/2 binding energy moved towards higher values, transitioning from 853.9 eV (5%) to 855.4 eV (75%).
5. The latter value was close to that of Ni3+. 
6. The Zr3d5/2 binding energy decreased with decreasing Zr content.
7. The addition of Zr notably decreased the quantity of O2 species due to the surface coverage of Ni species by ZrO2.
8. The O2-TPD-MS profiles of NiZrO nanoparticles with different Zr contents indicated a reduction in the total amount of non-stoichiometric oxygen species.
9. Despite efforts, the ethylene selectivity remained unsatisfactory.
10. When NiO was supported on Al2O3 with a high surface area, ethylene selectivity could be enhanced, albeit at the cost of increased reaction temperature.
11. The optimal yield of ethylene was 40%, achieved at 430°C over a 10% NiZrO catalyst.

1. 图3展示了NiO和不同Zr含量的NiZrO纳米粒子的H2-TPR图谱。
2. NiO纳米粒子的O1s谱图显示了一个主峰位于528.8 eV，对于75% NiZrO，该值移至529.6 eV，接近ZrO2的值（529.7 eV）。
3. Ni2p3/2谱图中出现两个可分辨的峰，分别位于约853.4和855.3 eV，以及一个振幅卫星在860.5 eV，这些特征对应于Ni2+和Ni3+物种。
4. 随着Zr含量增加，Ni2p3/2结合能向较高值移动，从5%的853.9 eV变为75%的855.4 eV。
5. 后者接近Ni3+的值。
6. Zr3d5/2结合能随Zr含量降低而降低。
7. 添加Zr显著减少了O2物种的数量，由于Ni物种被ZrO2覆盖在表面。
8. NiZrO纳米粒子不同Zr含量的O2-TPD-MS图谱显示非化学计量氧物种的总量减少。
9. 尽管尝试了多种方法，但乙二醇的选择性仍然不够理想。
10. 当NiO负载在具有高表面积的Al2O3上时，可以通过提高乙二醇选择性，尽管这会导致反应温度显著升高。
11. 最高的乙二醇产率为40%，在430°C下由10% NiZrO催化剂获得。
