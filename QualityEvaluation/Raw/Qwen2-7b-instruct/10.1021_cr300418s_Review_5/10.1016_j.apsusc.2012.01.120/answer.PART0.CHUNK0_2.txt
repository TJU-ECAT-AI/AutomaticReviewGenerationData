[1] "NiZrO nanoparticles with various Zr contents were prepared by a modified solgel method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning/high-resolution transmission electron microscope (SEM/HRTEM), BET surface area analysis, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and O2 temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD)."
[2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and the chemical environment of the catalysts, indicating the existence of strong interaction between Ni and Zr."
[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) to ethylene was applied to evaluate catalytic performance of the samples."
[4] "The best yield to ethylene was obtained over the 10% NiZrO catalyst with 60% ethane conversion and 66% ethylene selectivity."

The document discusses the preparation and characterization of NiZrO nanoparticles with varying Zr contents. These nanoparticles were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), BET surface area analysis, hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD). The doping of Zr altered the cell parameter and chemical environment of the catalysts, indicating a strong interaction between Ni and Zr. The nanoparticles were tested for their catalytic performance in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHE) to produce ethylene. The best yield of ethylene was achieved over the 10% NiZrO catalyst with a 60% ethane conversion and 66% ethylene selectivity.

本文讨论了不同Zr含量的NiZrO纳米颗粒的制备和表征。这些纳米颗粒通过X射线衍射（XRD）、扫描透射电子显微镜（STEM）、BET比表面分析、氢气温度程序化还原（H2-TPR）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和氧气温度程序化脱附（O2-TPD）进行了表征。掺杂的Zr改变了催化剂的晶胞参数和化学环境，表明Ni和Zr之间存在强烈的相互作用。纳米颗粒在乙烷氧化脱氢（ODHE）过程中用于生产乙烯的催化性能进行了测试。最佳的乙烯产率在10% NiZrO催化剂上获得，其乙烷转化率为60%，乙烯选择性为66%。
