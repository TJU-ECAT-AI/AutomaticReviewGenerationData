The specific surface areas of all prepared catalysts were determined by a surface area analyzer (Quantachrome, Autosorb-1) using nitrogen adsorption analysis at the liquid nitrogen temperature of 196°C with the BET method. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Philips PW3040/60 powder diffractometer operating at 40 kV and 40 mA using Cu k radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) and step scanning (0.2/min) in the 2θ range of 20°-90°.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was done using a JEM-2010F electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was done using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV.
H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) studies were carried out using a home-made TPR apparatus.
The samples were loaded in a quartz reactor and heated to 600°C in a 5% H2-Ar flow (25 mL/min) at a rate of 10°C/min.
Water produced during the reduction was removed with 5 Å molecular sieves.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were performed using a VG ESCALAB/Auger spectrometer to identify the oxidation states of the surfaces by means of chemical shift investigation.
The effect of charging was corrected by means of adventitious carbon (284.6 eV) referencing.
The areas of the peaks were computed by fitting the experimental spectra to Gaussian/Lorentzian curves after removal of the background (Shirley function).
O2 temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD) experiments were conducted on a mass spectrometer (MS).
The catalysts (0.1 g) were first pretreated in air for 0.5 h at 450°C and then cooled to room temperature.
After the system was purged with a He gas flow to smooth the baseline, the sample was heated to 600°C under He at a constant rate of 15°C/min under a gas flow rate of 35 mL/min.
The reactor exit was monitored online by a quadrupole mass analyzer (Balzer OmniStar 200), and the desorbed oxygen was detected by following the 32 (m/z) fragment.
The acidity of samples was measured by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD).
The sample (0.2 g) was placed into a quartz reactor and a flow of NH3 was introduced for 30 min.
The gaseous or physisorbed NH3 was removed by N2 (20 mL/min) at 100°C for 1 h, then the sample was heated to 600°C with a rate of 10°C/min.
The desorbed NH3 was monitored continuously by following the 15 (m/z) fragments via a mass spectrometer (HIDEN Analytical, QIC-20).

The characterization techniques utilized in the study include nitrogen adsorption analysis, X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, oxygen temperature-programmed desorption, and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption. These techniques collectively provide insights into the catalyst's composition, structure, reducibility, and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species. Specifically, XRD and HRTEM reveal the crystal structure and particle size, while SEM offers a visual representation of the catalyst's morphology. H2-TPR helps understand the catalyst's reducibility and surface chemistry. XPS provides information about the oxidation states and chemical environments of elements on the surface. O2-TPD and NH3-TPD offer details on the surface acidity and basicity, respectively, which are crucial for understanding the catalyst's reactivity and selectivity.
