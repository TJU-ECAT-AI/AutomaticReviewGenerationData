[1] "In this work, Zr was used to be a dopant to improve the performance of NiO catalyst for ODHE reaction."
[2] "The function of Zr was its enhancing action on the ethylene selectivity by reducing the oxidizing species on the surface for the total oxidation of ethane."
[3] "The strong interaction between Ni and Zr was detected in the synthesized catalyst."
[4] "The dopant Zr could enter the NiO lattice and lead to an increase in cell parameter."
[5] "The valence of Ni was increased due to electron transfer through the ZrONi bridge linkage."
[6] "The above two changes are believed to play important roles in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species."
[7] "The active site Ni tends to adsorb O species than non-selective oxygen species O2, which is beneficial for the increase of ethylene selectivity."
[8] "At the same time, ethane conversion was decreased due to the reduced Ni concentration."
[9] "A best yield to ethylene of 40% with 66% selectivity could be obtained over 10% NiZrO catalyst at 430 C."

1. Zirconium was utilized as a dopant to enhance the performance of nickel oxide catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHE).
2. Zirconium's role was to boost ethylene selectivity by reducing the oxidizing species on the catalyst surface, facilitating the total oxidation of ethane.
3. The synthesis of the catalyst revealed a strong interaction between nickel and zirconium.
4. Zirconium entered the nickel oxide lattice, leading to an increase in the cell parameter.
5. The nickel valence increased due to electron transfer through the ZrONi bridge linkage.
6. These modifications were thought to decrease reducibility and affect the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species.
7. The active site of nickel was inclined to adsorb oxygen species rather than non-selective oxygen species, which was advantageous for increasing ethylene selectivity.
8. Ethane conversion decreased due to the reduced nickel concentration.
9. The optimal yield of ethylene was 40% with a selectivity of 66% achieved at 430°C using a 10% NiZrO catalyst.
