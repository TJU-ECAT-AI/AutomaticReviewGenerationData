[1] "A series of NiZrO catalysts with varying Zr contents were prepared by a modified solgel method using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O."
[2] "XRD patterns were collected on a Philips PW3040/60 powder diffractometer operating at 40 kV and 40 mA using Cu k radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) and step scanning (0.2/min) in the 2θ range of 20°–90°."
[3] "The specific surface areas of all prepared catalysts were determined by a surface area analyzer (Quantachrome, Autosorb-1) using nitrogen adsorption analysis at the liquid nitrogen temperature of 196°C with the BET method."
[4] "The addition of Zr led to difficulty in catalysts reduction due to the interaction of Ni and Zr."
[5] "The ratio of O/O2 increased gradually with increasing Zr content, and thus the ethylene selectivity is increased distinctly except for 75% NiZrO."
[6] "It indicates that the added Zr should play an important role."

1. 使用了改良的溶胶凝胶法，通过Ni(NO3)2·6H2O和Zr(NO3)4·5H2O制备了一系列具有不同Zr含量的NiZrO催化剂。
2. 利用功率为40 kV、电流为40 mA的Philips PW3040/60粉末衍射仪获得了X射线衍射图谱，使用了Cu k辐射（λ = 0.15406 nm）和步进扫描。
3. 使用Quantachrome Autosorb-1表面分析仪和液氮温度为196°C的氮吸附分析确定了催化剂的比表面积。
4. Ni和Zr之间的相互作用导致了催化剂的还原困难。
5. 随着Zr含量的增加，O/O2的比率逐渐提高，进而显著增加了乙烯的选择性。
6. 显然，添加的Zr在提高催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。
