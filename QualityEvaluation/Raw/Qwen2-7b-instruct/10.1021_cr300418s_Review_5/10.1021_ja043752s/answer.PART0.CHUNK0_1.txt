Raman spectroscopy, when coupled with other analytical methods, plays a crucial role in comprehensively characterizing doped catalysts. This includes providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It also allows for the examination of the connection between spectral characteristics and catalyst properties, like reducibility. For instance, in the case of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania, Raman spectroscopy has been instrumental in understanding how these modifications affect the catalyst's performance.
