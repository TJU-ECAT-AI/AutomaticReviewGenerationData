Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with XRD and XPS, plays a crucial role in comprehensively characterizing doped catalysts. By identifying vibrations associated with both pure-phase materials and doped chromites, Raman spectra provide insights into the structural changes brought about by doping. In situ Raman measurements under reaction conditions, when combined with catalyst reactivity evaluations, allow researchers to assess the impact of alkali doping on the reducibility of vanadia supported on titania. The correlation between the Raman spectrum of the vanadyl group and the reducibility of vanadia highlights the importance of Raman spectroscopy in understanding catalyst properties.

Electron microscopy, despite its potential for morphological information and detection of single atoms under favorable conditions, requires careful handling when probing insulating oxides to prevent surface charging and damage. This technique has revealed that in the case of barium promoters on Ru metal catalysts, Ba forms a BaO phase on the Ru metal nanoparticle, rather than acting as a dopant. Similarly, high-resolution electron microscopy has shown that alkali-metal promoters can create isolated islands on metal nanoparticle catalysts, indicating they do not serve as dopants.

In summary, Raman spectroscopy, along with electron microscopy, contributes significantly to the characterization of doped catalysts by providing insights into structural changes, the nature of dopants, and the influence on catalyst properties.

拉曼光谱，结合XRD和XPS，对于全面表征掺杂催化剂至关重要。通过识别与纯相材料和掺杂铬铁矿相关的振动，拉曼光谱提供了关于掺杂带来的结构变化的信息。在反应条件下进行的原位拉曼测量，当与催化剂活性评估相结合时，允许研究人员评估碱掺杂对二氧化钛上支持的氧化钒可还原性的影响。氧化钒中vanadyl基团的拉曼光谱与可还原性的相关性强调了拉曼光谱在理解催化剂属性方面的关键作用。

电子显微镜，在有利条件下提供形态信息并能检测单个原子，但需要小心处理以避免表面充电和损伤氧化物。这项技术揭示了在Ru金属催化剂上Ba形成BaO相，而不是作为掺杂剂。同样，高分辨率电子显微镜显示了碱金属促进剂在金属纳米颗粒催化剂上可以形成孤立的岛屿，表明它们不是掺杂剂。

总之，拉曼光谱以及电子显微镜对于掺杂催化剂的表征贡献巨大，通过提供结构变化、掺杂性质以及对催化剂属性影响的信息。
