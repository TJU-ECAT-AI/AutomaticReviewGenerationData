4.8 Raman Spectroscopy
"In studies of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalyst for methane oxidation, Cr was substituted by Ce from 2% to 100%, and the material was characterized by Raman, XRD, and XPS. XRD suggested that a single phase solid solution was produced up to 10% substitution. Raman spectra were used to identify vibrations associated with pure phase materials and with the doped chromite."
4.9 Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
"The vibrational frequencies of metaloxygen bonds is sensitive to the presence of dopant species at modest concentrations, and infrared spectroscopy has been used to support the fact that a doped oxide was prepared."
4.10 Probing Metal Oxides with Electrons
"Electron microscopy provides morphological information and under favorable conditions good instruments can detect single atoms."
4.11 Low-Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS)
"LEIS is capable of determining the mass of the atoms in the surface layer by analyzing the energy loss of ions that have collided with the surface."
4.12 Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS)
"Elemental composition as a function of distance from the surface can be obtained by bombarding the sample with energetic ions."
4.13 Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
"Besides being used to examine coke production and desorption of impurities, the examination of phase transition temperatures and crystallization phenomena using DSC/TGA can help identify the formation of mixed phase materials and provide support that a doped oxide has been synthesized."
4.14 Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) and Temperature Programmed Reaction (TPR)
"TPD can be used by adsorbing molecules on the doped oxide, heating the sample, and measuring the composition of the gas desorbed from the surface."

Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with other analytical techniques such as XRD and XPS, plays a crucial role in comprehensively characterizing doped catalysts. It enables the identification of vibrations associated with both pure phase materials and those containing dopants, providing insights into the catalyst's composition and structure. For instance, studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalysts for methane oxidation utilized Raman spectroscopy alongside XRD and XPS to analyze the material's properties.

Infrared spectroscopy, specifically Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), is another valuable tool. It is sensitive to changes in vibrational frequencies caused by the presence of dopant species at moderate concentrations, thus confirming the preparation of doped oxides.

Electron microscopy offers detailed morphological information and, under ideal conditions, allows for the detection of individual atoms within metal oxides, enhancing our understanding of the catalyst's microstructure.

Low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) is capable of determining the mass of atoms in the surface layer by analyzing the energy loss of ions colliding with the surface, providing insights into surface composition and contamination.

Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) enables the examination of elemental composition across different depths within a sample, facilitating the analysis of surface and subsurface regions in doped oxides.

Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are employed to assess the phase transition temperatures and crystallization phenomena, aiding in identifying the formation of mixed-phase materials and supporting the synthesis of doped oxides.

Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) offer a rapid method to test how dopants influence catalyst properties such as reducibility, acidity, and reaction selectivity. These techniques involve adsorbing molecules onto the doped oxide, heating the sample, and monitoring the composition of gases released from the surface.

By integrating these complementary analytical techniques, researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of doped catalysts' composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity, thereby elucidating the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility.
