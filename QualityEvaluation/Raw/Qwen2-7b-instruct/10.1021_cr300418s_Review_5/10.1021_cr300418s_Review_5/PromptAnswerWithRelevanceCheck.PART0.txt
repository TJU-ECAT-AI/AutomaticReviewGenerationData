Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with other analytical techniques such as XRD and XPS, plays a crucial role in comprehensively characterizing doped catalysts. It enables the identification of vibrations associated with both pure phase materials and those containing dopants, providing insights into the catalyst's composition and structure. For instance, studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalysts for methane oxidation utilized Raman spectroscopy alongside XRD and XPS to analyze the material's properties.

Infrared spectroscopy, specifically Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), is another valuable tool. It is sensitive to changes in vibrational frequencies caused by the presence of dopant species at moderate concentrations, thus confirming the preparation of doped oxides.

Electron microscopy offers detailed morphological information and, under ideal conditions, allows for the detection of individual atoms within metal oxides, enhancing our understanding of the catalyst's microstructure.

Low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) is capable of determining the mass of atoms in the surface layer by analyzing the energy loss of ions colliding with the surface, providing insights into surface composition and contamination.

Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) enables the examination of elemental composition across different depths within a sample, facilitating the analysis of surface and subsurface regions in doped oxides.

Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are employed to assess the phase transition temperatures and crystallization phenomena, aiding in identifying the formation of mixed-phase materials and supporting the synthesis of doped oxides.

Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) offer a rapid method to test how dopants influence catalyst properties such as reducibility, acidity, and reaction selectivity. These techniques involve adsorbing molecules onto the doped oxide, heating the sample, and monitoring the composition of gases released from the surface.

By integrating these complementary analytical techniques, researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of doped catalysts' composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity, thereby elucidating the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility.

Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with XRD and XPS, plays a crucial role in comprehensively characterizing doped catalysts. By identifying vibrations associated with both pure-phase materials and doped chromites, Raman spectra provide insights into the structural changes brought about by doping. In situ Raman measurements under reaction conditions, when combined with catalyst reactivity evaluations, allow researchers to assess the impact of alkali doping on the reducibility of vanadia supported on titania. The correlation between the Raman spectrum of the vanadyl group and the reducibility of vanadia highlights the importance of Raman spectroscopy in understanding catalyst properties.

Electron microscopy, despite its potential for morphological information and detection of single atoms under favorable conditions, requires careful handling when probing insulating oxides to prevent surface charging and damage. This technique has revealed that in the case of barium promoters on Ru metal catalysts, Ba forms a BaO phase on the Ru metal nanoparticle, rather than acting as a dopant. Similarly, high-resolution electron microscopy has shown that alkali-metal promoters can create isolated islands on metal nanoparticle catalysts, indicating they do not serve as dopants.

In summary, Raman spectroscopy, along with electron microscopy, contributes significantly to the characterization of doped catalysts by providing insights into structural changes, the nature of dopants, and the influence on catalyst properties.
