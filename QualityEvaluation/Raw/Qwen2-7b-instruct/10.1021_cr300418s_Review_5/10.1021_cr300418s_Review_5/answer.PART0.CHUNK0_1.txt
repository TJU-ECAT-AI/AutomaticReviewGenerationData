Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with other analytical techniques, significantly contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. Specifically, it aids in identifying the vibrations associated with both pure phase materials and doped chromites, which helps in understanding the doping process. Additionally, Raman spectra correlate with the reducibility of vanadia, indicating the presence of the vanadyl group. Moreover, Raman spectroscopy is sensitive to the presence of dopant species, allowing for the detection of their influence on the material's properties.

Infrared spectroscopy supports the confirmation of doped oxides by observing changes in the vibrational frequencies of metal-oxygen bonds, which are sensitive to the presence of dopant species. This technique further validates the successful preparation of doped oxides.

Low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) offers a method to determine the mass of atoms in the surface layer, which is crucial for understanding the surface composition and potential unintended doping effects. This technique is particularly valuable for probing doped oxides and can help distinguish between intentional and accidental doping.

Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) provides elemental composition as a function of distance from the surface, enabling the identification of localized dopant distributions within the oxide. This technique is instrumental in distinguishing between homogeneous and phase-separated samples, especially in the context of mixed oxide catalysts.

Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are employed to examine phase transition temperatures and crystallization phenomena, aiding in the identification of mixed phase materials and confirming the synthesis of doped oxides. These techniques offer insights into the formation and stability of doped oxide structures.

Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature programmed reaction (TPR) serve as rapid methods to assess the impact of doping on the reducibility of oxides, acidity, and the ability to perform specific reactions. By monitoring the desorption of molecules such as oxygen or the production of gases like carbon dioxide and water, these techniques provide preliminary information on the functional properties of doped catalysts.

Overall, the combination of these techniques allows for a detailed exploration of the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties, offering insights into the effectiveness of doping strategies and their influence on the catalytic performance of doped catalysts.
