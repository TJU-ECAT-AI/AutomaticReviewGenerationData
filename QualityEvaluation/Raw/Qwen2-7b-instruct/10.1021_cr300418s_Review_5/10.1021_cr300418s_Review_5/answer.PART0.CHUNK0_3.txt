Answer: Raman spectroscopy, in combination with XRD and XPS, contributes to the comprehensive characterization of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition and structure. Specifically, it helps identify the phase state of the catalyst, as seen in Ce-doped CoCr2O4 studies. Moreover, Raman spectroscopy correlates with the reducibility of catalysts, as demonstrated by its use in evaluating alkali-doped vanadia on titania. In situ Raman measurements under reaction conditions allow for the assessment of how alkali doping affects the catalyst's reactivity, offering a deeper understanding of its behavior during actual use.

答案：拉曼光谱与X射线衍射（XRD）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）结合，为掺杂催化剂的全面表征提供了信息。具体来说，它有助于识别催化剂的组成和结构状态，在Ce掺杂CoCr2O4的研究中可以看到这一点。此外，拉曼光谱与催化剂的可还原性相关联，通过评估碱金属掺杂的二氧化钛上氧化钒的可还原性，展示了这一点。在反应条件下进行的原位拉曼测量允许评估碱金属掺杂对催化剂活性的影响，从而提供其实际使用过程中的行为的更深层次理解。
