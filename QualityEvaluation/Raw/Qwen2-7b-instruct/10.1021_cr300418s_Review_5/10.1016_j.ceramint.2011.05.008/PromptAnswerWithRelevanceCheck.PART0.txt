The document outlines the synthesis of silver doped lanthanum chromites using a microwave combustion method. This process allows for partial doping at both A and B sites, achieving perovskite structures of La1xAgxCrO3 and LaCr1xAgxO3. The materials' properties are comprehensively characterized through various analytical techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGDTA), and magnetic measurements. These methods provide insights into the composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity of the doped catalysts, enabling the exploration of relationships between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility.

The document does not directly discuss the application of Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with other analytical techniques to study Ce-doped CoCr2O4 or alkali-doped vanadia on titania. However, it demonstrates the use of a range of analytical tools for the characterization of materials, which could potentially be adapted for similar purposes involving Raman spectroscopy. For instance, Raman spectroscopy might offer complementary information on the vibrational modes of dopants or structural modifications within the perovskite lattice, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the catalyst's properties and behavior.

To address the question about how Raman spectroscopy contributes to the characterization of doped catalysts, one would need to refer to studies that specifically utilize Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with other analytical techniques. These studies typically aim to elucidate the structure, composition, and behavior of the catalysts, often focusing on aspects such as reducibility, surface chemistry, and phase transformations. By analyzing the spectral features of the dopants and the host material, researchers can gain insights into the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability, which are crucial for optimizing its performance in various applications.

In summary, while the document does not provide a direct example of Raman spectroscopy's application in the context of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 or alkali-doped vanadia on titania, it showcases the utility of various analytical techniques for studying materials. Raman spectroscopy, if employed, could similarly contribute valuable information about the structural and chemical properties of doped catalysts, aiding in their characterization and optimization.

The particle sizes were calculated using the Scherrer formula, considering the half-widths of the XRD peaks, as presented in Table 1. The EDAX results, summarized in Table 2, showed that in lanthanum chromite, the expected atomic ratio of La/Cr is 1. However, in the current case, a lower ratio suggests the formation of a Cr-rich phase. Partial substitution of the dopant at the A site with a higher molar concentration of silver resulted in a shift towards oxygen excess in the perovskite with a slight ion deficiency at the B site. The reduction in particle size in the doped samples can be attributed to the distortion in structure caused by the dopant ions. The thermograms for LaCrO3, La0.06Ag0.02CrO3, and LaCr0.06Ag0.02O3, shown in Fig. 6, indicate a negligible weight loss of 12%, which can be attributed to trace levels of.

粒子大小使用Scherrer公式计算得出，考虑了XRD峰的半宽度，结果见表1。EDAX结果显示，在镧铬酸盐中，预期的La/Cr原子比应为1。然而，在当前情况下，较低的比率表明形成了Cr富集相。在A位点部分用更高摩尔浓度的银替换掺杂剂导致向过氧钙钛矿成分的偏移，并且B位点离子略有不足。掺杂样品颗粒尺寸的减小可以归因于由掺杂离子引起的结构畸变。图6显示了LaCrO3、La0.06Ag0.02CrO3和LaCr0.06Ag0.02O3的热图，其中注意到的微量重量损失（12%）可以归因于痕量成分。

The results showed that the doping concentration, fuel/oxidizer ratio, and synthesis conditions influenced the structural and physical properties of the doped lanthanum chromites. The FTIR spectra provided insights into the chemical bonding and structure of the samples, while XRD analysis confirmed the formation of the desired perovskite-like oxide with silver doping. TEM images revealed the particle size distribution and morphology of the synthesized materials. Thermal analysis indicated the stability of the products, and magnetic measurements demonstrated the hysteresis loop formation, suggesting soft magnetic behavior of the doped samples.
