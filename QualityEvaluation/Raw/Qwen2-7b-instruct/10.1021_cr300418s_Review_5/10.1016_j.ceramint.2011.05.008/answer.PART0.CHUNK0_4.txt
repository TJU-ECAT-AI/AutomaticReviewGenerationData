1. The synthesis of LaCrO3 and silver doped lanthanum chromite nanoparticles was achieved using a microwave combustion route. The pure phase products were obtained at a microwave power of 0.56 kW, an irradiation time of 10 minutes, and a fuel to oxidizer ratio of 1. 

2. The average size of LaCrO3 particles was measured to be 57 nm. For the silver doped samples, the particle sizes were 78 nm for A site doping and 2026 nm for B site doping.

3. The enhanced coercivity and saturation magnetization values observed in the doped samples are attributed to the non-magnetic nature of silver.

1. 使用微波燃烧方法，成功合成了LaCrO3和银掺杂镧铬酸盐纳米颗粒。在功率为0.56 kW、照射时间为10分钟、燃料与氧化剂比为1的情况下，获得了纯相产品。

2. LaCrO3粒子的平均尺寸测量结果为57 nm。对于掺杂样品，A位点掺杂时的粒子大小为78 nm，B位点掺杂时的粒子大小为2026 nm。

3. 在掺杂样品中观察到的矫顽力和饱和磁化率的增加归因于银的非磁性性质。
