<p>The method of synthesis adopted also influences the material properties significantly. Most popular methods of synthesis include hydrothermal, spray pyrolysis, solid state reaction,microwave aided synthesis, solgel [2339], etc.</p>
<p>In the present work, we report the synthesis of nanoparticles of silver doped lanthanum chromite for the first time.

<p>Lakeshores Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (Model 7307) was used to perform magnetic measurements.</p>
<p>From the results, it was observed that the microwave power, oxidizer to fuel ratio and irradiation time determined the purity of the samples. At microwave power below 0.42 kW the product formation is not observed, at 0.42 kW partial product formation takes place while, 0.56 kW power yields pure phase product. At higher power levels the reaction is observed to be explosive in nature.</p>

The document outlines the synthesis of silver doped lanthanum chromites using a microwave combustion method. This process allows for partial doping at both A and B sites, achieving perovskite structures of La1xAgxCrO3 and LaCr1xAgxO3. The materials' properties are comprehensively characterized through various analytical techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGDTA), and magnetic measurements. These methods provide insights into the composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity of the doped catalysts, enabling the exploration of relationships between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility.

The document does not directly discuss the application of Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with other analytical techniques to study Ce-doped CoCr2O4 or alkali-doped vanadia on titania. However, it demonstrates the use of a range of analytical tools for the characterization of materials, which could potentially be adapted for similar purposes involving Raman spectroscopy. For instance, Raman spectroscopy might offer complementary information on the vibrational modes of dopants or structural modifications within the perovskite lattice, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the catalyst's properties and behavior.

To address the question about how Raman spectroscopy contributes to the characterization of doped catalysts, one would need to refer to studies that specifically utilize Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with other analytical techniques. These studies typically aim to elucidate the structure, composition, and behavior of the catalysts, often focusing on aspects such as reducibility, surface chemistry, and phase transformations. By analyzing the spectral features of the dopants and the host material, researchers can gain insights into the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability, which are crucial for optimizing its performance in various applications.

In summary, while the document does not provide a direct example of Raman spectroscopy's application in the context of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 or alkali-doped vanadia on titania, it showcases the utility of various analytical techniques for studying materials. Raman spectroscopy, if employed, could similarly contribute valuable information about the structural and chemical properties of doped catalysts, aiding in their characterization and optimization.
