<p>Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of all the samples were recorded on a Shimadzu 8400 spectrophotometer over the range of 4004000 cm−1 using KBr as a mulling agent.</p>
<p>The absorption peaks at 600 and 400 cm−1 can be ascribed to CrO bond and OCrO deformation vibrations indicating formation of product, while, narrow bands at 1085 1385 cm−1 correspond to NO3 of unreacted precursor salts and NH stretching is observed at 1485 cm−1.</p>
<p>In Fig. 1(c) and (d) are given the FTIR spectra of silver doped (both A site and B site), lanthanum chromite samples which exhibit increment in band assignment of CrO stretching and OCrO deformation vibrations implying substitution of Ag+ ions at lanthanum and chromium sub lattice. The bands at 561 cm−1and 443 cm−1 represent AgO bond formation.</p>
<p>X-ray diffractograms of Ag doped (both A site and B site) LaCrO3 are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The dopant concentration was varied from 0.02 to 0.06 M. Peaks corresponding to metallic silver are observed at 2u values of 38.3, 44.1 and 64.4 in addition to the characteristic peaks of lanthanum chromite.</p>
<p>Transmission electron micrographs (TEMs) of the samples were observed under the Philips CM-200 instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Suspensions of the samples in isopropanol were well dispersed and loaded on carbon coated grids of 200 mesh size.</p>
<p>The TGDTA curves of samples were recorded in an inert atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 8C min−1 using a Shimadzu instrument (Model DTG-60H).</p>
<p>Lakeshores Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (Model 7307) was used to perform magnetic measurements.</p>

The Raman spectroscopy, combined with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts by providing insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It helps in identifying and quantifying the dopants, understanding the structural modifications caused by doping, monitoring the in situ changes during synthesis or operation, and correlating spectral features with the catalyst properties such as reducibility. In the context of the provided literature, FTIR spectroscopy was utilized to confirm the formation of products, identify functional groups, and detect the substitution of Ag+ ions at the lanthanum and chromium sublattices in silver-doped lanthanum chromite samples. X-ray diffraction analysis helped in determining the crystalline structure, phase formation, and the effect of doping on the crystal lattice parameters. Transmission electron microscopy provided information on the morphology, size distribution, and shape of the nanoparticles, while thermal analysis (TG-DTA) gave insights into the stability and phase transitions of the materials. Magnetic measurements revealed the magnetic properties of the doped catalysts, which can be attributed to the non-magnetic nature of silver in the samples.
