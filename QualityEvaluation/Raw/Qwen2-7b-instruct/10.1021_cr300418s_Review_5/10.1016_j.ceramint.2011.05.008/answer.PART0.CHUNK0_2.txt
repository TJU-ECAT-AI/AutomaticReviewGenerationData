<p>The powder samples of LaCrO3, La1xAgxCrO3 LaCr1xAgxO3 (x refers to the fraction of La and Cr substituted by Ag) thus obtained were analysed using various analytical techniques.</p>
<p>From the results, it was observed that the microwave power, oxidizer to fuel ratio and irradiation time determined the purity of the samples. At microwave power below 0.42 kW the product formation is not observed, at 0.42 kW partial product formation takes place while, 0.56 kW power yields pure phase product. At higher power levels the reaction is observed to be explosive in nature.</p>
<p>The optimum irradiation time to obtain pure phase product is observed to be 10 min with an oxidizer to fuel ratio of 1.</p>

The document describes the synthesis of silver doped lanthanum chromites using a microwave combustion method. The process involves varying factors like microwave power, oxidizer to fuel ratio, and irradiation time to achieve pure phase products. Analytical techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermal analysis, and magnetic measurements were used to characterize the samples. The results showed that the doping concentration, fuel/oxidizer ratio, and synthesis conditions influenced the structural and physical properties of the doped lanthanum chromites. The FTIR spectra provided insights into the chemical bonding and structure of the samples, while XRD analysis confirmed the formation of the desired perovskite-like oxide with silver doping. TEM images revealed the particle size distribution and morphology of the synthesized materials. Thermal analysis indicated the stability of the products, and magnetic measurements demonstrated the hysteresis loop formation, suggesting soft magnetic behavior of the doped samples.
