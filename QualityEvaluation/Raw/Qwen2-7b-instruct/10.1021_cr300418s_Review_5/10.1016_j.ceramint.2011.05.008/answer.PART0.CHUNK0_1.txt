<p>The method of synthesis adopted also influences the material properties significantly. Most popular methods of synthesis include hydrothermal, spray pyrolysis, solid state reaction,microwave aided synthesis, solgel [2339], etc.</p>
<p>In the present work, we report the synthesis of nanoparticles of silver doped lanthanum chromite for the first time. The samples were synthesized by microwave combustion method;partial doping at both A site and B site have been achieved with short reaction time of few minutes yielding perovskites of the types La1xAgxCrO3 and LaCr1xAgxO3. Further, the influence of dopant concentration, fuel/oxidizer ratio and precursor salts on material properties is investigated. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to explore the structural and ionic changes in the substituted perovskite with reference to pristine sample.</p>
<p>Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of all the samples were recorded on a Shimadzu 8400 spectrophotometer over the range of 4004000 cm1 using KBr as a mulling agent.

The particle sizes were calculated using the Scherrer formula, considering the half-widths of the XRD peaks, as presented in Table 1. The EDAX results, summarized in Table 2, showed that in lanthanum chromite, the expected atomic ratio of La/Cr is 1. However, in the current case, a lower ratio suggests the formation of a Cr-rich phase. Partial substitution of the dopant at the A site with a higher molar concentration of silver resulted in a shift towards oxygen excess in the perovskite with a slight ion deficiency at the B site. The reduction in particle size in the doped samples can be attributed to the distortion in structure caused by the dopant ions. The thermograms for LaCrO3, La0.06Ag0.02CrO3, and LaCr0.06Ag0.02O3, shown in Fig. 6, indicate a negligible weight loss of 12%, which can be attributed to trace levels of.

粒子大小使用Scherrer公式计算得出，考虑了XRD峰的半宽度，结果见表1。EDAX结果显示，在镧铬酸盐中，预期的La/Cr原子比应为1。然而，在当前情况下，较低的比率表明形成了Cr富集相。在A位点部分用更高摩尔浓度的银替换掺杂剂导致向过氧钙钛矿成分的偏移，并且B位点离子略有不足。掺杂样品颗粒尺寸的减小可以归因于由掺杂离子引起的结构畸变。图6显示了LaCrO3、La0.06Ag0.02CrO3和LaCr0.06Ag0.02O3的热图，其中注意到的微量重量损失（12%）可以归因于痕量成分。
