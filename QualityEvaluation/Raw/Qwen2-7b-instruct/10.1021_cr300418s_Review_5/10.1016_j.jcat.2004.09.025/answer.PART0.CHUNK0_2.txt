1. Catalytic partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas was studied over various materials including ZrO2, pure YSZ, and YSZ with oxide contaminations across a broad temperature range.
2. The catalysts' properties were assessed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) techniques.
3. Higher calcination temperatures lead to the creation of more active sites per square meter, but the catalyst loses surface area due to sintering.
4. The activity of YSZ containing traces of earth alkali oxides collapses due to sintering, possibly because the impurities segregate to the surface.
5. Concurrently, both heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions occur at temperatures above 950°C during catalytic partial oxidation of methane over YSZ.
6. Raising the reaction temperature to 950°C and above enhances the catalytic performance of YSZ, facilitated by dry reforming, steam reforming, and the reverse water-gas shift reactions.

1. 在广泛的温度窗口内，研究了甲烷部分氧化到合成气的催化作用，使用了ZrO2、纯YSZ以及含有氧化物污染物的YSZ。
2. 使用X射线荧光(XRF)和低能离子散射(LEIS)技术评估了催化剂的特性。
3. 更高的煅烧温度导致每平方米创建更多的活性位点，但催化剂由于烧结而失去表面积。
4. 含有地碱氧化物痕迹的YSZ的活性在烧结过程中崩溃，可能是因为杂质聚积到表面。
5. 在YSZ上进行的甲烷部分氧化反应中，温度高于950°C时同时发生异相反应和均相反应。
6. 将反应温度提高至950°C以上可以增强YSZ的催化性能，得益于干重整、蒸汽重整以及逆水煤气变换反应。
