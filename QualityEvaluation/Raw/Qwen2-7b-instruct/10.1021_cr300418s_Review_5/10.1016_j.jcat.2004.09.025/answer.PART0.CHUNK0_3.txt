[1] "Doping ZrO2 with Y2O3 generates active sites, resulting in improved catalytic performance."
[2] "The composition of the outermost surface rather than the bulk of YSZ clearly determines its catalytic performance."
[3] "The composition of the outermost surface of calcined YSZ is independent of both the concentration of Y2O3 in the bulk and the calcination temperature as long as the YSZ catalyst is not contaminated; the surface always contains 12  2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of Y2O3."
[4] "More active sites are created per square meter after calcination at higher temperatures."
[5] "Sintering causes the activity of YSZ containing traces of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse."
[6] "Heterogeneous reactions occur concurrently with ho- mogeneous reactions at temperatures above 950 C during CPOM over YSZ."
[7] "Nevertheless, thermody- namic equilibrium is not even approached, even at very high temperatures, because of insufficient reforming activity."

1. Doping ZrO2 with Y2O3 generates active sites, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.
2. The surface composition, not the bulk composition, dictates the catalytic performance of YSZ.
3. The outermost surface of calcined YSZ maintains a consistent Y2O3 content of 12 ± 2 mol% regardless of calcination temperature or Y2O3 concentration in the bulk, due to Y2O3 segregation.
4. Higher temperatures result in more active sites per square meter.
5. Sintering affects the activity of YSZ containing earth alkali oxides, causing a collapse.
6. At temperatures above 950 C, CPOM over YSZ involves concurrent heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions.
7. Even at high temperatures, reaching thermodynamic equilibrium is not possible due to inadequate reforming activity.

1. 添加Y2O3到ZrO2中可生成活性位点，从而提高催化性能。
2. YSZ的表面组成，而非整体组成，决定了其催化性能。
3. 烧结后的YSZ外层表面的Y2O3含量始终为12±2摩尔%，无论整体Y2O3浓度或烧结温度如何，这是由于Y2O3的分离。
4. 提高温度会增加每平方米的活性位点数量。
5. 地球碱氧化物存在的YSZ在烧结过程中会影响其活性。
6. 在950°C以上的温度下，YSZ上的部分氧化涉及同时存在的异相和均相反应。
7. 即使在高温下，也难以达到热力学平衡，因为重整活性不足。
