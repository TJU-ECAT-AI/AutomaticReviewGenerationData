[1] "The composition of the outermost surface of calcined YSZ is independent of both the concentration of Y2O3 in the bulk and the calcination temperature as long as the YSZ catalyst is not contaminated; the surface always contains 12  2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of Y2O3."
[2] "Calcination at higher temperatures creates more active sites per square meter, while the catalyst loses surface area via sintering."
[3] "The same sintering treatment causes the activity of YSZ containing traces of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse."
[4] "Heterogeneous reactions occur concurrently with homogeneous reactions at temperatures above 950 C during CPOM over YSZ."

1. The composition of the outermost surface of calcined yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) catalysts is independent of the bulk concentration of yttrium oxide (Y2O3) and calcination temperature, provided the catalyst is not contaminated. This surface always contains approximately 12 to 2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of the yttrium oxide.
   
2. Higher calcination temperatures result in the creation of more active sites per square meter on the catalyst, albeit accompanied by a loss of surface area via sintering.

3. Sintering treatments that involve the presence of (earth) alkali oxides cause the activity of YSZ catalysts to collapse.

4. At temperatures above 950 C, during catalytic partial oxidation of methane (CPOM) over YSZ, heterogeneous reactions occur alongside homogeneous reactions.

1. YSZ催化剂的最外层表面组成，只要催化剂不受污染，其组成与基体中Y2O3的浓度和煅烧温度无关，始终包含大约12到2摩尔%的Y2O3，这是由于Y2O3的分离导致的。
   
2. 更高的煅烧温度会生成更多的每平方米上的活性位点，但同时伴随着表面面积的流失，即烧结。

3. 包含(地球)碱性氧化物的烧结处理会导致YSZ催化剂的活性崩溃。

4. 在950°C以上的温度下，使用YSZ进行甲烷部分氧化制合成气时，会发生异相反应与同相反应并存。
