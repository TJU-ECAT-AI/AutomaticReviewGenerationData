1. The study of catalytic partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas has been conducted for approximately two decades. 

2. Research in our laboratory has focused on CPOM over certain irreducible metal oxides, including TiO2, La2O3, and ZrO2-based mixed oxides.

3. Yttrium-stabilized zirconia demonstrated superior catalytic performance compared to other oxide catalysts.

4. Analysis through XRF revealed the absence of major bulk impurities TiO2 and HfO2 on the outermost surface of the samples.

5. The surface composition of calcined YSZ remains constant regardless of Y2O3 concentration in the bulk and calcination temperature, except when the catalyst is contaminated.

6. Higher calcination temperatures lead to increased active sites per square meter, yet the catalyst experiences surface area loss due to sintering.

7. Contamination of YSZ with traces of earth alkali oxides results in catalyst activity collapse following sintering treatment.

8. At temperatures above 950°C, both heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions occur concurrently during CPOM over YSZ.

9. Raising the reaction temperature to 950°C and beyond enhances YSZ catalytic performance, facilitated by dry reforming, steam reforming, and reverse watergas shift reactions.

1. 对于甲烷部分氧化合成气的研究已经持续了大约二十年。  

2. 我们实验室的研究集中在对某些不可还原金属氧化物，如TiO2、La2O3和基于ZrO2的混合氧化物进行CPOM。

3. Yttrium-stabilized zirconia在各种氧化物催化剂中表现出最佳的催化性能。

4. XRF分析显示，在这些样品的最外层表面未检测到主要的杂质TiO2和HfO2。

5. 无论基体中的Y2O3浓度如何以及煅烧温度如何，只要YSZ催化剂不被污染，其表面的组成总是独立的；表面始终含有12±2 mol%的Y2O3，这是由于Y2O3的分离所致。

6. 更高的煅烧温度导致每平方米增加更多的活性位点，但催化剂通过烧结失去了表面面积。

7. YSZ中含有少量的（地球）碱金属氧化物时，煅烧处理会导致催化剂活性崩溃。

8. 在YSZ上进行CPOM时，温度高于950°C时，同时发生异相反应和均相反应。

9. 将反应温度提高到950°C以上，并结合干重整、蒸汽重整和逆水煤气变换反应，可以增强YSZ的催化性能。
