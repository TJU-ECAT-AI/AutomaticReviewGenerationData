How does Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contribute to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts, particularly in terms of their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity, and what insights can it provide about the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility, as exemplified by studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania?

[1] "Catalytic partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas was studied over ZrO2, pure YSZ, and YSZ containing oxide contaminations in a wide temperature window. Doping ZrO2 with Y2O3 generates active sites, resulting in improved catalytic performance. The composition of the outermost surface rather than the bulk of YSZ clearly determines its catalytic performance.
The composition of the outermost surface of calcined YSZ is independent of both the concentration of Y2O3 in the bulk and the calcination temperature as long as the YSZ catalyst is not contaminated; the surface always contains 12  2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of Y2O3. More ac- tive sites are created per square meter after calcination at higher temperatures.
Sintering causes the activity of YSZ containing traces of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse. The effect is probably due to segregation of the impurities to the surface. However, it cannot be ruled out that enhanced segregation of Y2O3 con- tributes to this effect.
Heterogeneous reactions occur concurrently with ho- mogeneous reactions at temperatures above 950 C during CPOM over YSZ. The catalytic performance of YSZ can be improved by a rise in the reaction temperature to 950 C and above, due to dry reforming, steam reforming, and the reverse watergas shift reactions. Nevertheless, thermody- namic equilibrium is not even approached, even at very high temperatures, because of insufficient reforming activity."

1. The study examined the catalytic partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas using ZrO2, pure YSZ, and YSZ with oxide contaminants across a broad temperature range. Adding Y2O3 to ZrO2 creates active sites, enhancing its catalytic performance. The surface composition rather than the bulk composition of YSZ dictates its catalytic performance. The outermost surface of calcined YSZ has a consistent Y2O3 concentration of approximately 12 mol%, regardless of the bulk Y2O3 content or calcination temperature, due to Y2O3 segregation. Higher calcination temperatures produce more active sites per unit area. Contaminants in YSZ cause a collapse in activity upon sintering, possibly due to enhanced segregation of Y2O3, and heterogeneous reactions occur alongside homogeneous reactions at temperatures above 950°C during partial oxidation over YSZ. The catalytic performance of YSZ can be improved by increasing the reaction temperature to 950°C or higher, facilitating dry reforming, steam reforming, and reverse water-gas shift reactions. However, reaching thermodynamic equilibrium is not possible at these temperatures due to insufficient reforming activity.

1. 对于ZrO2、纯YSZ和含氧化物污染物的YSZ，在宽温度范围内，研究了甲烷的部分氧化至合成气。向ZrO2中添加Y2O3生成活性位点，提高了其催化性能。YSZ的表面组成而不是其内部组成决定了其催化性能。YSZ煅烧后外层表面的Y2O3含量约为12摩尔%，无论其内部Y2O3含量或煅烧温度如何，始终保持不变，这是由于Y2O3的分选作用。提高煅烧温度可产生更多的活性位点每平方米面积。YSZ中的杂质导致在烧结时活性崩溃，可能是因为Y2O3的增强分选作用。在YSZ上进行部分氧化反应时，高于950°C时，异相反应与同相反应同时发生。通过提高反应温度到950°C或更高，促进干重整、蒸汽重整和逆水煤气变换反应，可以改善YSZ的催化性能。然而，由于重整活性不足，即使在这些高温下也无法达到热力学平衡。

1. The composition of the outermost surface of calcined yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) catalysts is independent of the bulk concentration of yttrium oxide (Y2O3) and calcination temperature, provided the catalyst is not contaminated. This surface always contains approximately 12 to 2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of the yttrium oxide.
   
2. Higher calcination temperatures result in the creation of more active sites per square meter on the catalyst, albeit accompanied by a loss of surface area via sintering.

3. Sintering treatments that involve the presence of (earth) alkali oxides cause the activity of YSZ catalysts to collapse.

4. At temperatures above 950 C, during catalytic partial oxidation of methane (CPOM) over YSZ, heterogeneous reactions occur alongside homogeneous reactions.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. YSZ催化剂的最外层表面组成，只要催化剂不受污染，其组成与基体中Y2O3的浓度和煅烧温度无关，始终包含大约12到2摩尔%的Y2O3，这是由于Y2O3的分离导致的。
   
2. 更高的煅烧温度会生成更多的每平方米上的活性位点，但同时伴随着表面面积的流失，即烧结。

3. 包含(地球)碱性氧化物的烧结处理会导致YSZ催化剂的活性崩溃。

4. 在950°C以上的温度下，使用YSZ进行甲烷部分氧化制合成气时，会发生异相反应与同相反应并存。
