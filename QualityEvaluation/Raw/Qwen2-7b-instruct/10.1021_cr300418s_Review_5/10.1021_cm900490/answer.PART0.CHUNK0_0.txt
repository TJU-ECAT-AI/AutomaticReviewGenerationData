Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with other analytical techniques, contributes significantly to the detailed characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It aids in comprehending aspects such as composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. Specifically, it offers insights into the connection between spectral characteristics and catalyst properties, notably reducibility. This is illustrated through studies involving Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania.
