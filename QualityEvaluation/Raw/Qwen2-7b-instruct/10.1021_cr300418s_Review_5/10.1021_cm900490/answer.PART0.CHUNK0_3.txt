Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts, particularly in terms of their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. It provides insights into the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility. For instance, studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania have exemplified how Raman spectroscopy can elucidate the detailed composition and structure of these materials, which are crucial for understanding their catalytic behavior.
