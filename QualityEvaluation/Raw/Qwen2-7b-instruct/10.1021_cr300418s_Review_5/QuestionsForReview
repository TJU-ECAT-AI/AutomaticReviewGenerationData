How does Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contribute to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts, particularly in terms of their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity, and what insights can it provide about the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties such as reducibility, as exemplified by studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania?
