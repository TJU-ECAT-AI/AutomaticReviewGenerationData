[1] "Commercial heterogeneous NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst was tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of n-butane with different oxidant species: O2, CO2 and N2O."
[2] "In literature 1, 13, 39, 45, it was reported that the reaction of C1- C4 alkanes with O- gives significant amounts of olefins, but no oxygenated products over transition metal oxides."
[3] "The most abundant product of selective oxidation was butadiene with productivity up to 0.89 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 when using N2O as an oxidant, 0.61 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 when using CO2 as an oxidant and 0.21 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1when using O2 as an oxidant."
[4] "Using soft oxidants like N2O and CO2 limits the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which promote the oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides, on the surface of the catalyst, thereby increasing the selectivity towards butadiene."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differs between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts can undergo reversible oxidation-reduction reactions, which can influence the mechanism of activation and regeneration. Traditional oxidants like O2 facilitate direct oxidative dehydrogenation pathways, while CO2 and N2O can indirectly activate the alkane through intermediate steps involving oxygen species on the catalyst surface. The effectiveness of catalysts such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane involves complex interactions that can be influenced by the specific mechanism of CO2 dissociation and subsequent reaction pathways.

2. The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using different catalysts involve distinct steps. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 may promote CO2 dissociation through the generation of strong acidic sites that can facilitate the adsorption and activation of CO2. CeO2 catalysts can exhibit a combination of acidic and basic sites, allowing for both CO2 adsorption and subsequent activation. Transition metal clusters, depending on their size and composition, can act as active centers for CO2 activation, potentially through the formation of reactive oxygen species. Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are influenced by the nature of the catalyst, the specific adsorption states of CO2, and the catalytic pathways that follow. Detailed mechanisms often involve the formation of intermediates such as CO, O2-, or O· radicals, which then react with propane molecules.

1. 烷烃的氧化脱氢作用在可逆氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂和不可逆氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。可逆氧化还原催化剂可以进行可逆的氧化还原反应，这会影响激活和再生机制。传统氧化剂如O2直接促进氧化脱氢路径，而CO2和N2O则通过催化表面上的氧物种间接激活烷烃。诸如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇等催化剂在激活CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢中的有效性涉及复杂的相互作用，这些相互作用可能受到CO2解离和后续反应途径的特定机制的影响。

2. CO2解离在使用不同催化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢的提议机制中涉及不同的步骤。V2O5和VOx/SiO2可能通过产生强酸性位点促进CO2解离，这些位点可以促进CO2的吸附和活化。CeO2催化剂可以表现出酸性和碱性位点的组合，允许CO2的吸附和随后的活化。根据大小和组成的不同，过渡金属簇可能作为CO2活化的活性中心，潜在地通过形成活性氧物种。CO2解离的能量壁垒受到催化剂的性质、CO2的特定吸附状态以及随后遵循的催化路径的影响。详细的机制通常涉及形成中间体，例如CO、O2-或O·自由基，然后与丙烷分子反应。
