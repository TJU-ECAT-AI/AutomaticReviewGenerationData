The comparative mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, considering traditional oxidants and CO2, involve distinct pathways. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, facilitate oxidative dehydrogenation by generating reactive oxygen species that can activate C-H bonds. However, their regenerative processes often rely on the reduction of these active sites to their initial state, followed by oxygen regeneration, typically through the consumption of the alkane substrate or another oxidant. 

Redox-inactive catalysts, on the other hand, may employ different mechanisms for C-H bond activation, often involving the use of soft oxidants like N2O and CO2. CO2, when used as an oxidant, can be activated through the formation of reactive intermediates capable of dehydrogenating alkanes. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies. For instance, the proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation and its subsequent recombination with metal centers to form reactive species are influenced by factors such as the catalyst's structure, composition, and the specific reaction conditions. 

In terms of energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, the literature suggests that CO2 can be more effectively activated under certain conditions, particularly when using catalysts that can stabilize the activated species or lower the activation energy required for C-O bond cleavage. The role of traditional oxidants in these reactions is often to supply the necessary oxygen for the dehydrogenation process, while CO2 provides an alternative, less reactive oxidant that can be utilized more efficiently under certain circumstances, leading to improved selectivity towards desired products like butadiene. 

The literature highlights that N2O and CO2 offer advantages over traditional oxidants in terms of reducing the formation of undesired products, enhancing selectivity, and limiting the oxidative capacity of the catalyst, which can otherwise lead to the formation of carbon oxides and other unwanted byproducts. The experimental and theoretical findings support the effectiveness of these soft oxidants in facilitating oxidative dehydrogenation with high selectivity towards butadiene, demonstrating their potential as alternatives to conventional oxidants in the process.

氧化脱氢反应中，活性和非活性氧化还原金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃中的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在明显差异，考虑传统氧化剂和二氧化碳。活性氧化还原催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇，通过生成活性氧物种来促进氧化脱氢，这些物种可以活化C-H键。然而，它们的再生过程通常依赖于将活性位点还原到初始状态，然后通过消耗烷基或另一种氧化剂来实现氧气再生。

相比之下，非活性氧化还原催化剂可能采用不同的C-H键活化机制，往往利用软氧化剂如N2O和CO2。当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，可以通过形成能够活化烷烃的活性中间体来激活CO2。不同催化剂在激活CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性各不相同。例如，CO2的分解和随后与金属中心结合形成活性物种的机制受到催化剂结构、组成和特定反应条件的影响。

就CO2分解的能量壁垒而言，文献表明在某些条件下，CO2可以更有效地被激活，尤其是当使用能够稳定激活物种或降低C-O键断裂所需的活化能的催化剂时。

传统氧化剂在这类反应中的作用通常是提供必要的氧气来执行脱氢过程，而CO2提供了一种替代的、相对不那么活跃的氧化剂，在某些情况下可以更高效地利用，从而提高对目标产物（如丁二烯）的选择性。

文献强调，N2O和CO2在减少不希望产生的产品、增强选择性和限制催化剂的过氧化能力方面具有优势，这可以防止形成碳氧化合物和其他不需要的副产品。实验和理论发现支持这些软氧化剂在高选择性地向丁二烯转化过程中的有效性，证明了它们作为传统氧化剂替代品的潜力。
