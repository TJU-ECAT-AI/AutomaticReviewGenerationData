[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts involves the activation of C-H bonds followed by their selective cleavage."
[2] "Redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, facilitate the activation of C-H bonds but do not undergo significant regeneration during the reaction."
[3] "Traditional oxidants, such as O2, play a crucial role in oxidative dehydrogenation by providing reactive oxygen species that enable the cleavage of C-H bonds."
[4] "Carbon dioxide (CO2) can also be utilized as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation, particularly when activated effectively."
[5] "The effectiveness of CO2 activation varies depending on the catalyst type and the proposed mechanism for CO2 dissociation."

1. Redox-active metal oxide catalysts enable both the activation of C-H bonds and their selective cleavage in oxidative dehydrogenation. 
2. Redox-inactive catalysts primarily activate C-H bonds but do not regenerate significantly during the reaction.
3. Traditional oxidants like O2 are vital for oxidative dehydrogenation, supplying reactive oxygen species that facilitate C-H bond cleavage.
4. CO2 can serve as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation, but its activation efficiency differs based on the catalyst and CO2 dissociation mechanism.
5. The performance of CO2 activation is influenced by the catalyst's characteristics and the theoretical model describing how CO2 is dissociated.
