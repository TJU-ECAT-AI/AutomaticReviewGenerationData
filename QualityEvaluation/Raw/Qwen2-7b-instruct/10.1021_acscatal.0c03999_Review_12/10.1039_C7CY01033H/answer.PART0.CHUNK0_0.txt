    Compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, explaining the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. Include a discussion on the effectiveness of different catalysts (such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalysts was studied using oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide as oxidants."
[2] "The experimentally determined activation energy (EA) with CO2 and N2O as oxidants, 161 and 112 kJ mol-1, respectively, is in good agreement with theoretically predicted activation energy 144 kJ mol-1 for the abstraction of first hydrogen atom from butane, suggesting that this is the rate-determining step."
[3] "The most abundant product of selective oxidation was butadiene with productivity up to 0.89 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 when using N2O as an oxidant, 0.61 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 when using CO2 as an oxidant and 0.21 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1when using O2 as an oxidant."
[4] "In oxygen atmosphere, the experimentally determined activation energy 75 kJ mol-1. This is in close agreement with theoretically calculated value of 62 kJ mol-1 for re-oxidation of the surface."
[5] "The calculation of activation barriers from DFT are in excellent agreement with experimental data, proving the postulated reaction mechanism to be sound."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration. Redox-active catalysts, like those containing V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, can effectively activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The role of traditional oxidants, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide, is central in this process. 

For instance, oxygen leads to high butadiene selectivity but also high coke formation. Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide offer advantages by limiting the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, thus increasing the selectivity towards butadiene. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 varies. Transition metal clusters, for example, can potentially offer a more efficient activation mechanism for CO2 compared to traditional redox-active catalysts due to their unique electronic properties and surface chemistry.

The activation energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are an important factor in determining the efficiency of CO2 activation. Traditional oxidants, like oxygen, often require higher activation energies for CO2 dissociation, which can limit their effectiveness in certain reactions. On the other hand, CO2 itself, when used as an oxidant, can have lower activation energy barriers for dissociation, making it more effective for certain types of reactions.

The theoretical predictions based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insights into the mechanisms and energy barriers associated with C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration. These calculations confirm the postulated reaction mechanisms and the effectiveness of the proposed methods for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

氧化脱氢反应涉及C-H键活化和催化剂再生。红氧化活性催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2等，可以有效地使CO2活化用于丙烷的氧化脱氢。传统氧化剂，如氧气、二氧化碳和氮氧化物，在此过程中扮演核心角色。

例如，氧气导致高丁二烯选择性，但同时也伴随着高焦炭形成。二氧化碳和氮氧化物的优势在于限制了表面电磷酸基团的生成，从而提高了丁二烯的选择性。不同催化剂在激活CO2方面的有效性存在差异。过渡金属簇，由于其独特的电子特性和表面化学性质，可能比传统的红氧化活性催化剂更有效地激活CO2。

CO2解离的激活能壁垒是决定其激活效率的重要因素。传统氧化剂，如氧气，往往需要更高的激活能壁垒来解离CO2，这可能会限制它们在某些反应中的效果。另一方面，当CO2自身用作氧化剂时，其解离的激活能壁垒可能更低，因此对于某些类型的反应更为有效。

基于密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的理论预测提供了有关C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制以及能量壁垒的见解。这些计算证实了提出的反应机制的有效性和所提出方法对烷烃氧化脱氢的有效性。
