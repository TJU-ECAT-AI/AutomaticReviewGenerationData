[1] "In this study, TPR profiles reflect the structural transformation of the starting high valence oxides into structurally distinct suboxides."
[2] "The lower TPRO peak temperature (< 350 C) and the larger TPRO peak area correspond to the higher oxygen mobility and the larger oxygen capacity, respectively."
[3] "In the presence of O2, the amount of re-oxidised sites is higher than those observed in the presence of N2O."
[4] "In O2 atmosphere, the barrier for vacancies replenishment drops to 0.64 eV (62 kJ mol-1) and leads to non-negligible formation of both, O-Mo and O-Ni surface species."
[5] "Fully oxygen-terminated surface favours total oxidation of butane to cracked products and COx, as butane immediately and irreversibly transforms into butan-1-ol."

1. In this research, the TPR profiles demonstrate the change from high-valence oxides to distinct suboxides. 
2. Lower TPRO peak temperatures and higher peak areas indicate greater oxygen mobility and capacity, respectively.
3. More re-oxidized sites are present in the presence of oxygen compared to nitrogen oxide.
4. In the presence of oxygen, the barrier for oxygen vacancies replenishment is 62 kJ/mol, leading to formation of both O-Mo and O-Ni surface species.
5. A fully oxygen-terminated surface promotes total oxidation of butane into cracked products and COx, as butane transforms into butan-1-ol instantaneously and irreversibly.

1. 在这项研究中，TPR轮廓显示了从高电荷氧化物到结构上不同的亚氧化物的转变。
2. 较低的TPRO峰温与较大的TPRO峰值面积对应于更高的氧动力学和更大的氧容量。
3. 在氧气存在的情况下，重新氧化的位点的数量高于在氮氧化物存在的情况下观察到的数量。
4. 在氧气的存在下，氧气空位补充的势垒为62 kJ/mol，导致形成O-Mo和O-Ni表面物种。
5. 完全氧终止的表面促进但烷的完全氧化成裂解产物和COx，因为但烷瞬间且不可逆地转化为但-1醇。
