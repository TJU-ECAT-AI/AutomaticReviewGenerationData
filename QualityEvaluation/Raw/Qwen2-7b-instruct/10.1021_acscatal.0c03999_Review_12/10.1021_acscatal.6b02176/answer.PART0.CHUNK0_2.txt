1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was investigated using various metal oxide catalysts, including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters. Among these, redox-active catalysts demonstrated superior performance in activating CO2 for the reaction, particularly V2O5 and VOx/SiO2. Transition metal clusters were found to exhibit enhanced capability in both C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration.
