The study focused on the comparison and contrast of the mechanisms involved in the activation of C-H bonds and catalyst regeneration during oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes using both redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. The research also evaluated the efficiency of various catalysts, including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, in catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by activating CO2. The mechanisms proposed for CO2 dissociation and the associated energy barriers were also analyzed.
