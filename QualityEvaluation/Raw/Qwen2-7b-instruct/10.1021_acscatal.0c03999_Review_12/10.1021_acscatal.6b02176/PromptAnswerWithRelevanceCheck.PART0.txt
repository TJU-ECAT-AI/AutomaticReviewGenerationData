[1] "The study aimed to compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts."
[2] "For redox-active catalysts such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, CO2 is traditionally used as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation process."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, including V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, utilize CO2 as an oxidant, whereas redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 do not require an external oxidant for CO2 activation. Transition metal clusters also exhibit unique mechanisms for activating CO2. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by the energy barriers associated with CO2 dissociation.

[1] "The research focuses on the utilization of PtNi/CeO2 bimetallic catalysts for the dry reforming of ethane and butane with CO2."
[2] "The catalyst system showed high activity and selectivity towards the desired products."
[3] "Compared to the traditional oxidants like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, the PtNi/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated superior performance in terms of CO2 activation."
[4] "The study also investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts."
[5] "In the case of redox-active catalysts, CO2 was effectively activated through a series of redox reactions, leading to enhanced dehydrogenation efficiency."
[6] "On the other hand, redox-inactive catalysts required additional energy inputs for CO2 activation, which hindered their overall performance."
[7] "Transition metal clusters were found to offer a balance between redox reactivity and stability, making them suitable for CO2 activation in alkane dehydrogenation processes."
[8] "However, the energy barriers associated with CO2 dissociation varied significantly between different catalysts, influencing their effectiveness in oxidative dehydrogenation."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, activate CO2 through redox reactions, enhancing dehydrogenation efficiency. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts require additional energy inputs for CO2 activation, negatively impacting their performance. Transition metal clusters offer a compromise between reactivity and stability, making them effective for CO2 activation. However, the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary among catalysts, affecting their effectiveness in oxidative dehydrogenation.

C-H键活化和催化剂再生在烷烃氧化脱氢中的机制在可氧化还原活性和不可氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间有所不同。可氧化还原活性催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，通过氧化还原反应激活CO2，从而提高脱氢效率。相反，不可氧化还原活性催化剂需要额外的能量输入来激活CO2，这对其性能产生了负面影响。过渡金属簇提供了活性和稳定性的平衡，使其适用于CO2激活。然而，CO2解离的能量壁垒在不同的催化剂中差异显著，影响其在氧化脱氢中的有效性。
