The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, including V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, utilize CO2 as an oxidant, whereas redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 do not require an external oxidant for CO2 activation. Transition metal clusters also exhibit unique mechanisms for activating CO2. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by the energy barriers associated with CO2 dissociation.

在烷烃氧化脱氢过程中，活性可逆和非活性可逆金属氧化物催化剂中的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在差异。活性可逆催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，使用CO2作为氧化剂。而非活性可逆催化剂如CeO2则无需外部氧化剂即可激活CO2。过渡金属簇也具有独特的CO2激活机制。这些催化剂对丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性受CO2解离相关的能量壁垒影响。
