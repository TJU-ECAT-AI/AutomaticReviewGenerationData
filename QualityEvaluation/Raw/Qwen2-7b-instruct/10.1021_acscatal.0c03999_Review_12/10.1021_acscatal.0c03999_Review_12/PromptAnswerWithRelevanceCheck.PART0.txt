6. In redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group. (269)

In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies. (273-275)

In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the CH bond must first be activated. In metal oxides, this commonly occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acid-base pair. (266-268)

For the case of CO2, its high stability can be problematic for activation to oxidize the surface. Therefore, finding a catalyst with a strong affinity for CO2 and its dissociation is an important criterion for oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2. (276)

Meanwhile, on a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy. (28)

In contrast, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily on the CeO2 (110) surface with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies. (277)

Transition metals, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have also been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation. One study found a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV could be obtained on Ni4/MgO which provides active oxygen species for alkane CH activation. (281)

On catalysts with strong basic sites, such as MgO, CO2 can interact strongly with surface sites and poison the catalyst, which is an issue when considering CO2 as an oxidant. (287)

In an early work, Rozanska et al. have investigated oxidative dehydrogenation on vanadia using DFT for a cluster model, and compared the differences between O2 and N2O as oxidants. (177)

Using N2O as an oxidant has also been explored in metalorganic framework (MOF) systems for alkane partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation. (292)

Another perspective for the participation of NOx in oxidative dehydrogenation has been introduced in a recent experimental and theoretical study by Annamalai et al. (296)

1. Redox-active oxides use the MvK mechanism for activation, involving hydrogen abstraction from a CH bond or a hydroxyl group. Redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, reduce the oxidant directly onto the catalyst surface without forming a vacancy. Catalysts for CO2 activation require a strong affinity for CO2 and its dissociation. CeO2 surfaces with oxygen vacancies allow easier CO2 dissociation than pure V2O5 surfaces. Transition metals, especially in subnanometer clusters, can provide low CO2 dissociation barriers for alkane CH activation. Basic sites on catalysts, like MgO, can strongly interact with CO2, poisoning the catalyst when using CO2 as an oxidant.

2. Vanadia, using DFT for a cluster model, showed differences in oxidative dehydrogenation between O2 and N2O as oxidants. Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) have been explored for alkane partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation using N2O as an oxidant. 

3. NOx can promote oxidative dehydrogenation through the formation of OH radicals. The high selectivity of OH radicals for oxidative dehydrogenation is attributed to their strong hydrogen abstraction strength, preventing overoxidation and maintaining selectivity. NOx can also generate OH radicals under oxidative dehydrogenation conditions, contributing to the process.

1. 在活性氧化物中，通常使用MvK机制进行激活，涉及从CH键或邻近羟基组抽象氢。不活性氧化物如MgO和La2O3直接将氧化剂减少到催化剂表面，而无需形成空位。对于CO2激活，需要催化剂对CO2有强烈的亲和力和其分解能力。CeO2表面含有氧空位时，CO2分解更容易，比纯V2O5表面的能量更低。过渡金属，尤其是亚纳米簇，可以提供低CO2分解壁垒，用于烷烃CH激活。基本位点如MgO可以强烈与CO2相互作用，当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，会毒害催化剂。

2. 使用DFT的范德华模型，vanadia显示了O2和N2O作为氧化剂在氧化脱氢之间的差异。金属有机框架（MOF）已被探索用于烷烃部分氧化和氧化脱氢，使用N2O作为氧化剂。

3. NOx可以通过形成OH自由基促进氧化脱氢。OH自由基对于氧化脱氢的高度选择性归因于它们强大的氢抽象强度，防止过氧化并保持选择性。在氧化脱氢条件下，NOx也可以生成OH自由基，参与这一过程。

1. In redox-active metal oxides, C-H bond activation typically happens through homolytic or heterolytic processes involving H abstraction by surface oxygen species or over an acid-base pair. In contrast, redox-inactive oxides use a MvK mechanism where hydrogen forms a hydroxide, abstracts a second hydrogen, and leads to water formation. The role of the oxidant in redox-inactive oxides is to regenerate the catalyst by reoxidizing the vacancy site or reacting with adsorbed hydrogen species.

2. CO2 activation in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves two main mechanisms: direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, or hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO. The latter mechanism is favored on the CeO2 (110) surface due to its lower barrier for CO2 dissociation, enabling more efficient activation compared to V2O5.

3. Catalysts such as Ni4/MgO, with a low CO2 dissociation barrier, can provide active oxygen species for alkane CH activation, facilitating oxidative dehydrogenation. Bifunctional catalysts containing CeO2 support show higher selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation over dry reforming, as evidenced by DFT calculations.

4. The formation of OH radicals from NOx can promote selective oxidative dehydrogenation in the absence of a solid catalyst. The high selectivity of OH radicals for oxidative dehydrogenation is attributed to their strong hydrogen abstraction strength, which prevents overoxidation and enhances the selectivity to specific products.

1. 在可氧化还原活性金属氧化物中，C-H键的活化通常通过表面氧物种的H抽象或酸碱对的异裂过程进行。相比之下，在可氧化还原惰性氧化物中，使用MvK机制，其中氢形成一个羟基，然后从C-H键或相邻的羟基组中提取第二个氢，导致水的形成。在可氧化还原惰性氧化物中，氧化剂的作用是通过重新氧化空位点提供其氧气，或者与表面吸附的氢物种反应来再生催化剂。

2. 当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，参与氧化脱氢作用的两种主要机制包括直接CO2分解以形成CO和O，或者通过氢化CO2形成HOCO或COOH然后形成CO。后一种机制在CeO2（110）表面上更受青睐，因为它的CO2分解壁垒较低，能够更有效地激活。

3. 如Ni4/MgO这样的催化剂，由于其低的CO2分解壁垒，可以提供烷基CH激活的活性氧物种，从而促进氧化脱氢作用。含有CeO2支持的双功能催化剂显示出更高的选择性，用于氧化脱氢作用而不是干重整，这在DFT计算中得到了证明。

4. 气态NOx的形成可以促进在没有固体催化剂的情况下选择性的氧化脱氢作用。OH自由基的选择性对于氧化脱氢作用的高选择性归因于它们强大的氢抽象能力，这防止了过氧化作用并增强了特定产物的选择性。

In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with CO2, finding a catalyst with a strong affinity for CO2 and its dissociation is an important criterion. Fan et al. explored ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 on a V2O5 catalyst, finding the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV. (276)

Meanwhile, on a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. found CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy. (28)

On the CeO2 (110) surface, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies. (277)

Transition metals, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have also been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation. One study found a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV could be obtained on Ni4/MgO which provides active oxygen species for alkane CH activation. (281)

Kattel et al. investigated the reaction network and kinetics of ethane ODH with CO2, finding the dissociative mechanism for CO2 is favored over HOCO formation, despite the higher energy barriers for the former. (283)

In an early work, Rozanska et al. found N2O to be a weaker oxidant for vanadia catalysts, which can only oxidize the V3+ sites, whereas O2 can oxidize both V3+ and V4+ sites. (177)

For propane activation, the peroxovanadate species is found to be more active for both propane activation and propylene oxidation than the V5+ site, having lower reaction barriers and a more exothermic reaction by comparison. (289)

The ability of the site to regenerate the oxygen from N2O activation and the ability of the oxygen to activate the CH bond are correlated to a single descriptor, the oxygen binding energy on the metal node. (292)

1. Redox-active oxides typically follow a MvK mechanism for C-H bond activation, involving hydrogen abstraction from an adsorbed oxygen species. In contrast, redox-inactive oxides use a mechanism where the catalyst surface combines hydrogen and oxidant directly, without requiring the formation of a vacancy. This alternative mechanism is more common in redox-inactive oxides like MgO and La2O3.

2. In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2, catalysts must have a strong affinity for CO2 and its dissociation. Fan et al. found a high barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site on V2O5, indicating a difficult process. Ascoop et al. reported a lower barrier for CO2 reoxidation on VOx/SiO2, though still significant. CeO2 (110) surface allows easier CO2 dissociation with a lower barrier, especially when containing oxygen vacancies. Transition metals, particularly in nanocluster form, exhibit low CO2 dissociation barriers, facilitating alkane CH activation.

3. Kattel et al. highlighted that the dissociative mechanism for CO2 is favored over HOCO formation, even though the latter has a lower barrier. This supports the selectivity towards ethylene production in the ODH process.

4. Rozanska et al. observed that N2O is a weaker oxidant for vanadia catalysts, capable of oxidizing only V3+ sites, unlike O2 which can oxidize both V3+ and V4+ sites. This affects the efficiency of propane activation and propylene production.

5. In propane activation, peroxovanadate is found to be more active than the V5+ site, offering lower barriers and a more exothermic reaction. This mechanism contributes to improved selectivity towards propylene.

6. The oxygen binding energy on metal nodes in MOFs correlates with the ability of the site to regenerate oxygen from N2O activation and activate CH bonds. A more negative binding energy facilitates easier N2O activation and CH bond activation, enhancing the selectivity of the ODH process.

1. 在活性氧物种的吸附氢化作用下，活性氧物种通常遵循红氧化合物机制。相反，在活性惰性氧化物如MgO和La2O3中，使用的是催化剂表面直接结合氢和氧化剂的机制，而不需要形成空位。这种替代机制在活性惰性氧化物更为常见。

2. 在与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢过程中，催化剂必须具有强烈的亲和力和二氧化碳的解离。Fan等人发现，二氧化碳氧化V2O5催化剂中的八号位点的壁垒为3.16 eV，带有2.21 eV的热力学反应能量，这是一个极其困难的过程。Ascoop等人发现，二氧化碳在VOx/SiO2催化剂上的重新氧化壁垒为1.76 eV，虽然比纯V2O5表面低，但仍然存在显著的能量壁垒。铈氧化物（110）表面允许更简单的二氧化碳解离，特别是在包含氧空位的站点上，其壁垒为1.36 eV。

3. 过渡金属，特别是纳米簇形式，表现出较低的二氧化碳解离壁垒，有助于烷烃C-H键激活。

4. Kattel等人指出，二氧化碳的分解机制对于二氧化碳形成HOCO的形成是优选的，尽管后者具有较低的壁垒。这支持乙烯生产选择性的增强。

5. Rozanska等人观察到，N2O是vanadia催化剂的较弱氧化剂，只能氧化V3+位点，而O2可以氧化V3+和V4+位点。这影响了丙烷激活和丙烯生产的效率。

6. MOF中金属节点的氧结合能与从N2O激活氧气再生和激活CH键的能力相关。负向的结合能有助于更容易的N2O激活和CH键激活，从而提高ODH过程的选择性。

Answer: The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. In redox-active oxides, the hydrogen is first activated by surface oxygen species, forming a hydroxide, which then abstracts a second hydrogen either from a C-H bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group. This process forms water, which desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst. In redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, reducing the oxidant directly without requiring the formation of a vacancy. The role of the oxidant in redox-active oxides is to regenerate the catalyst by providing its oxygen to fill an oxygen vacancy or reacting with surface-bound hydrogen species, whereas in redox-inactive oxides, the oxidant is reduced directly on the catalyst surface.

在活性氧氧化物中，氢首先通过表面氧物种激活，形成羟基，然后从一个C-H键或邻近的羟基组抽象第二个氢。这个过程产生水，水脱附后留下一个需要被氧化剂填充的氧空位。以MgO和La2O3等非活性氧氧化物为例，催化剂表面将氢和氧化剂结合在一起，直接还原氧化剂，无需形成空位。在活性氧氧化物中，氧化剂的作用是通过提供其氧来再生催化剂，以填充氧空位或与表面氢物种反应，而在非活性氧氧化物中，氧化剂直接在催化剂表面上还原，无需形成空位。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. In redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where hydrogen adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, abstracts a second hydrogen from a C-H bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group, leading to water formation and regeneration of the catalyst. In redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, the catalyst surface brings together hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly, without the need for catalyst vacancy formation. This mechanism is more common in redox-inactive oxides.

In the case of CO2 as an oxidant, the literature discusses the difficulties of its direct activation on V2O5, with a high barrier and endothermic reaction energy. However, CO2 can be more easily dissociated on CeO2 surfaces, especially on sites containing oxygen vacancies, with a lower barrier. Transition metal clusters, such as Ni4/MgO, show a low CO2 dissociation barrier, facilitating alkane CH activation. 

The literature also explores the use of N2O and NOx as oxidants for alkane oxidation. N2O shows a weaker oxidizing ability on catalysts like vanadia compared to O2, affecting the activation and regeneration processes. NOx, on the other hand, can promote selective oxidative dehydrogenation via the formation of OH radicals, which can activate CH bonds in the absence of a solid catalyst. This highlights the potential of NOx in ODHP, especially when considering the generation of NO from boron nitride catalysts under ODHP conditions.

在氧化脱氢反应中，不同类型的金属氧化物催化剂中烷基C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机制存在差异。在红氧化合物中，通常观察到MvK机制，其中吸附在氧上的氢形成一个羟基，然后从C-H键或相邻的羟基组抽取第二个氢原子，导致水的形成并再生催化剂。而在红氧化合物不活跃的氧化物，如MgO和La2O3中，催化剂表面将氢和氧化剂结合在一起，直接还原氧化剂，无需形成催化剂空位。这种机制在红氧化合物不活跃的氧化物中更为常见。

对于二氧化碳作为氧化剂的情况，文献讨论了其直接激活V2O5的困难性，伴随着高壁垒和吸热反应能量。然而，二氧化碳在铈氧化物表面上更容易分解，特别是在包含氧空位的点上，壁垒更低。过渡金属簇，例如Ni4/MgO，显示出较低的二氧化碳分解壁垒，有利于烷基C-H键的活化。

文献还探讨了使用N2O和NOx作为烷基氧化的氧化剂。N2O在范德华催化剂上的氧化能力较弱与氧气相比，影响了激活和再生过程。NOx可以通过形成OH自由基促进选择性的氧化脱氢，在没有固体催化剂的情况下激活C-H键。这强调了NOx在ODHP中的潜力，特别是考虑到硼氮催化剂下产生NO的可能性。
