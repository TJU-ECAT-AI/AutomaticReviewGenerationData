6. In redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group. (269)

In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies. (273-275)

In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with CO2, finding a catalyst with a strong affinity for CO2 and its dissociation is an important criterion. Fan et al. explored ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 on a V2O5 catalyst, finding the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV. (276)

Meanwhile, on a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. found CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy. (28)

On the CeO2 (110) surface, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies. (277)

Transition metals, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have also been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation. One study found a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV could be obtained on Ni4/MgO which provides active oxygen species for alkane CH activation. (281)

Kattel et al. investigated the reaction network and kinetics of ethane ODH with CO2, finding the dissociative mechanism for CO2 is favored over HOCO formation, despite the higher energy barriers for the former. (283)

In an early work, Rozanska et al. found N2O to be a weaker oxidant for vanadia catalysts, which can only oxidize the V3+ sites, whereas O2 can oxidize both V3+ and V4+ sites. (177)

For propane activation, the peroxovanadate species is found to be more active for both propane activation and propylene oxidation than the V5+ site, having lower reaction barriers and a more exothermic reaction by comparison. (289)

The ability of the site to regenerate the oxygen from N2O activation and the ability of the oxygen to activate the CH bond are correlated to a single descriptor, the oxygen binding energy on the metal node. (292)

1. Redox-active oxides typically follow a MvK mechanism for C-H bond activation, involving hydrogen abstraction from an adsorbed oxygen species. In contrast, redox-inactive oxides use a mechanism where the catalyst surface combines hydrogen and oxidant directly, without requiring the formation of a vacancy. This alternative mechanism is more common in redox-inactive oxides like MgO and La2O3.

2. In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2, catalysts must have a strong affinity for CO2 and its dissociation. Fan et al. found a high barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site on V2O5, indicating a difficult process. Ascoop et al. reported a lower barrier for CO2 reoxidation on VOx/SiO2, though still significant. CeO2 (110) surface allows easier CO2 dissociation with a lower barrier, especially when containing oxygen vacancies. Transition metals, particularly in nanocluster form, exhibit low CO2 dissociation barriers, facilitating alkane CH activation.

3. Kattel et al. highlighted that the dissociative mechanism for CO2 is favored over HOCO formation, even though the latter has a lower barrier. This supports the selectivity towards ethylene production in the ODH process.

4. Rozanska et al. observed that N2O is a weaker oxidant for vanadia catalysts, capable of oxidizing only V3+ sites, unlike O2 which can oxidize both V3+ and V4+ sites. This affects the efficiency of propane activation and propylene production.

5. In propane activation, peroxovanadate is found to be more active than the V5+ site, offering lower barriers and a more exothermic reaction. This mechanism contributes to improved selectivity towards propylene.

6. The oxygen binding energy on metal nodes in MOFs correlates with the ability of the site to regenerate oxygen from N2O activation and activate CH bonds. A more negative binding energy facilitates easier N2O activation and CH bond activation, enhancing the selectivity of the ODH process.

1. 在活性氧物种的吸附氢化作用下，活性氧物种通常遵循红氧化合物机制。相反，在活性惰性氧化物如MgO和La2O3中，使用的是催化剂表面直接结合氢和氧化剂的机制，而不需要形成空位。这种替代机制在活性惰性氧化物更为常见。

2. 在与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢过程中，催化剂必须具有强烈的亲和力和二氧化碳的解离。Fan等人发现，二氧化碳氧化V2O5催化剂中的八号位点的壁垒为3.16 eV，带有2.21 eV的热力学反应能量，这是一个极其困难的过程。Ascoop等人发现，二氧化碳在VOx/SiO2催化剂上的重新氧化壁垒为1.76 eV，虽然比纯V2O5表面低，但仍然存在显著的能量壁垒。铈氧化物（110）表面允许更简单的二氧化碳解离，特别是在包含氧空位的站点上，其壁垒为1.36 eV。

3. 过渡金属，特别是纳米簇形式，表现出较低的二氧化碳解离壁垒，有助于烷烃C-H键激活。

4. Kattel等人指出，二氧化碳的分解机制对于二氧化碳形成HOCO的形成是优选的，尽管后者具有较低的壁垒。这支持乙烯生产选择性的增强。

5. Rozanska等人观察到，N2O是vanadia催化剂的较弱氧化剂，只能氧化V3+位点，而O2可以氧化V3+和V4+位点。这影响了丙烷激活和丙烯生产的效率。

6. MOF中金属节点的氧结合能与从N2O激活氧气再生和激活CH键的能力相关。负向的结合能有助于更容易的N2O激活和CH键激活，从而提高ODH过程的选择性。
