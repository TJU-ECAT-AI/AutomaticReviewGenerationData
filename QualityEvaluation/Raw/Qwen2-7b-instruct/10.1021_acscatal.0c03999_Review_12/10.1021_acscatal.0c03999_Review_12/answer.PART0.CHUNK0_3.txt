6. In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies. (273-275)

In an alternative mechanism, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, reducing the oxidant directly, which is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides like MgO and La2O3. 

The role of the oxidant in redox-active oxides is to regenerate the catalyst by providing its oxygen to fill an oxygen vacancy or reacting with adsorbed hydrogen species on the surface. (270-272)

For redox-active oxides, the oxidant helps regenerate the catalyst by supplying oxygen to fill an oxygen vacancy or reacting with surface-bound hydrogen. 

In contrast, for redox-inactive oxides, the oxidant is reduced directly on the catalyst surface without the need for vacancy formation.

Answer: The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. In redox-active oxides, the hydrogen is first activated by surface oxygen species, forming a hydroxide, which then abstracts a second hydrogen either from a C-H bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group. This process forms water, which desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst. In redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, reducing the oxidant directly without requiring the formation of a vacancy. The role of the oxidant in redox-active oxides is to regenerate the catalyst by providing its oxygen to fill an oxygen vacancy or reacting with surface-bound hydrogen species, whereas in redox-inactive oxides, the oxidant is reduced directly on the catalyst surface.

在活性氧氧化物中，氢首先通过表面氧物种激活，形成羟基，然后从一个C-H键或邻近的羟基组抽象第二个氢。这个过程产生水，水脱附后留下一个需要被氧化剂填充的氧空位。以MgO和La2O3等非活性氧氧化物为例，催化剂表面将氢和氧化剂结合在一起，直接还原氧化剂，无需形成空位。在活性氧氧化物中，氧化剂的作用是通过提供其氧来再生催化剂，以填充氧空位或与表面氢物种反应，而在非活性氧氧化物中，氧化剂直接在催化剂表面上还原，无需形成空位。
