6. Progress in Theoretical Studies of Reaction Mechanisms
"Regardless of the oxidant or catalyst used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the CH bond must first be activated. In metal oxides, this commonly occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acid-base pair."
"In redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group."
"In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies."
"While ODHP has featured extensively in theoretical studies, examples where soft oxidants are explicitly considered are considerably fewer. In this section, we include examples of ODHP with soft oxidants but also supplement similar examples with other alkanes, such as ethane and methane partial oxidation, which share many similarities in their reaction mechanism. Oxidants discussed in this section include CO2, N2O, NOx, and other soft oxidants, such as sulfides and halides."
"Fan et al. have explored the feasibility of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 on a V2O5 catalyst. (276) They found the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV, suggesting an extremely difficult process."
"Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy. (28) It is concluded that vanadia in the WOxVOx/SiO2 cannot be fully oxidized to V2O5 with CO2 but instead oxidized to V2O4."
"In contrast, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily on the CeO2 (110) surface with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies."
"Transition metals, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have also been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation. One study found a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV could be obtained on Ni4/MgO which provides active oxygen species for alkane CH activation."
"In one such study, Myint et al. have examined a number of bifunctional catalysts, containing CoPt, CoMo, and FeNi supported on CeO2 for ethane ODH with CO2 from experiments and theory."
"Kattel et al. have followed up on this study with a thorough theoretical investigation of the reaction network and kinetics."
"In the studied reaction network for ethane ODH, CO2 goes through either a dissociative mechanism or an associative one forming HOCO (Figure 26)."
"In the dissociative mechanism, CO is formed and desorbs into the gas phase, while the remaining oxygen can assist in the CH activation or become hydrogenated after unassisted CH activation."
"In the associative mechanism, CH activation first occurs independently of CO2, which provides hydrogen to form the HOCO intermediate. Once formed, it can dissociate with a barrier of 0.83 eV, significantly lower than the direct dissociation of CO2 having a barrier of 2.13 eV."
"In the dry reforming path, ethylene is also formed via the same intermediates (Figure 27B). However, the paths diverge upon further oxidation of ethylene to CH2CH2O, CH2CH, CH3CH, or CH2CHO, which eventually leads to CC scission."
"Interestingly, it is revealed that the CO2 dissociation is favored over HOCO formation, despite the higher energy barriers for the former."
"CO2 can often participate in parallel competing reactions from ODHP, such as dry reforming and the RWGS at high temperatures."
"Selective ODHP catalysts, therefore, need to prevent dry reforming from occurring."
"On catalysts with strong basic sites, such as MgO, CO2 can interact strongly with surface sites and poisons the catalyst, which is an issue when considering CO2 as an oxidant."
"In an early work, Rozanska et al. have investigated ODHP on vanadia using DFT for a cluster model, and compared the differences between O2 and N2O as oxidants."
"On this catalyst, propane first undergoes homolytic CH activation on the terminal oxygen of the V5+ sites, reducing the site to V4+ and forming a hydroxyl."
"From their calculations, they find N2O to be a weaker oxidant for the catalyst, which can only oxidize the V3+ sites, whereas O2 can oxidize both V3+ and V4+ sites."
"A similar hypothesis regarding differences in active oxygen sites due to the choice of oxidant has been put forward by Dasireddy et al. for butane ODH on the NiMoO4 catalyst."
"Using N2O as an oxidant has also been explored in metalorganic framework (MOF) systems for alkane partial oxidation and ODH."
"In methane partial oxidation, the terminal oxygen of the metal nodes is commonly proposed to be the active site, which activates the methane CH bond and forms methanol via a radical-rebound mechanism."
"In a more recent combined experimental and theoretical study, Barona et al. propose a similar mechanism for alkane ODH on the Fe3M nodes of MOF PCN-250 (Figure 30A)."
"Here, the alkane undergoes homolytic CH activation on the terminal oxygen of the metal node, resulting in a hydroxyl group which is further reduced to form water or an alcohol."
"In another perspective for the participation of NOx in ODHP has been introduced in a recent experimental and theoretical study by Annamalai et al."
"They find that gas phase NOx can promote selective ODHP via the formation of OH radicals, which can then activate CH bonds in ODHP in the absence of a solid catalyst."
"Another perspective for the participation of NOx in ODHP has been introduced in a recent experimental and theoretical study by Annamalai et al."
"Relating this back to heterogeneous catalysis, NO is also found to be generated from boron nitride catalysts under ODHP conditions, which could also participate in this process."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. In redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where hydrogen adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, abstracts a second hydrogen from a C-H bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group, leading to water formation and regeneration of the catalyst. In redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, the catalyst surface brings together hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly, without the need for catalyst vacancy formation. This mechanism is more common in redox-inactive oxides.

In the case of CO2 as an oxidant, the literature discusses the difficulties of its direct activation on V2O5, with a high barrier and endothermic reaction energy. However, CO2 can be more easily dissociated on CeO2 surfaces, especially on sites containing oxygen vacancies, with a lower barrier. Transition metal clusters, such as Ni4/MgO, show a low CO2 dissociation barrier, facilitating alkane CH activation. 

The literature also explores the use of N2O and NOx as oxidants for alkane oxidation. N2O shows a weaker oxidizing ability on catalysts like vanadia compared to O2, affecting the activation and regeneration processes. NOx, on the other hand, can promote selective oxidative dehydrogenation via the formation of OH radicals, which can activate CH bonds in the absence of a solid catalyst. This highlights the potential of NOx in ODHP, especially when considering the generation of NO from boron nitride catalysts under ODHP conditions.

在氧化脱氢反应中，不同类型的金属氧化物催化剂中烷基C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机制存在差异。在红氧化合物中，通常观察到MvK机制，其中吸附在氧上的氢形成一个羟基，然后从C-H键或相邻的羟基组抽取第二个氢原子，导致水的形成并再生催化剂。而在红氧化合物不活跃的氧化物，如MgO和La2O3中，催化剂表面将氢和氧化剂结合在一起，直接还原氧化剂，无需形成催化剂空位。这种机制在红氧化合物不活跃的氧化物中更为常见。

对于二氧化碳作为氧化剂的情况，文献讨论了其直接激活V2O5的困难性，伴随着高壁垒和吸热反应能量。然而，二氧化碳在铈氧化物表面上更容易分解，特别是在包含氧空位的点上，壁垒更低。过渡金属簇，例如Ni4/MgO，显示出较低的二氧化碳分解壁垒，有利于烷基C-H键的活化。

文献还探讨了使用N2O和NOx作为烷基氧化的氧化剂。N2O在范德华催化剂上的氧化能力较弱与氧气相比，影响了激活和再生过程。NOx可以通过形成OH自由基促进选择性的氧化脱氢，在没有固体催化剂的情况下激活C-H键。这强调了NOx在ODHP中的潜力，特别是考虑到硼氮催化剂下产生NO的可能性。
