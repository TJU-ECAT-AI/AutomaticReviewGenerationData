[1] "Regardless of the oxidant or catalyst used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the CH bond must first be activated."
[2] "In metal oxides, this commonly occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acid-base pair."
[3] "In the redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group."
[4] "This forms water, which desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst."
[5] "In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly."
[6] "This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies."
[7] "In this context, the role of the oxidant is to regenerate the catalyst by either reoxidizing the vacancy site through providing its oxygen, or reacting with adsorbed hydrogen species on the surface."
[8] "When CO2 is used as an oxidant, there are generally two proposed mechanisms for its participation in ODHP."
[9] "One involves direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, and the other involves the hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO."
[10] "For the CO2 dissociation route, its high stability can be problematic because it prevents it from being easily activated to oxidize the surface."
[11] "Meanwhile, on a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy."
[12] "It is concluded that vanadia in the WOxVOx/SiO2 cannot be fully oxidized to V2O5 with CO2 but instead oxidized to V2O4."
[13] "In contrast, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily on the CeO2 (110) surface with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies."
[14] "The ability of the reduced CeO2 surface to dissociate CO2 is utilized in a series of studies with bifunctional catalysts containing a CeO2 support."
[15] "Transition metals, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have also been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation."
[16] "One study found a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV could be obtained on Ni4/MgO which provides active oxygen species for alkane CH activation."
[17] "CO2 can often participate in parallel competing reactions from ODHP, such as dry reforming and the RWGS at high temperatures."
[18] "Selective ODHP catalysts, therefore, need to prevent dry reforming from occurring."
[19] "In one such study, Myint et al. have examined a number of bifunctional catalysts, containing CoPt, CoMo, and FeNi supported on CeO2 for ethane ODH with CO2 from experiments and theory."
[20] "The authors observe the highest selectivity to the ODH product with FeNi/CeO2."
[21] "DFT is used to rationalize this behavior by comparing the energy profiles for successive CH dissociation and CC dissociation reactions."
[22] "In the dissociative mechanism, CO is formed and desorbs into the gas phase, while the remaining oxygen can assist in the CH activation or become hydrogenated after unassisted CH activation."
[23] "In the associative mechanism, CH activation first occurs independently of CO2, which provides hydrogen to form the HOCO intermediate."
[24] "Once formed, it can dissociate with a barrier of 0.83 eV, significantly lower than the direct dissociation of CO2 having a barrier of 2.13 eV."
[25] "In the dry reforming path, ethylene is also formed via the same intermediates (Figure 27B)."
[26] "However, the paths diverge upon further oxidation of ethylene to CH2CH2O, CH2CH, CH3CH, or CH2CHO, which eventually leads to CC scission."
[27] "In the associative pathway for CO2 is computed with DFT, where CO2 is hydrogenated by a nearby H2 that is formed as part of the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H5 (Figure 28)."
[28] "The reaction of CO2 follows roughly that of reverse water-gas shift, which forms CO and H2O."
[29] "On these surfaces CO2 interacts with the lattice oxygen to form surface bound carbonate species."
[30] "Similarly, on the perovskite BaZrO3, CO2 is found to bind strongly to form a stable carbonate layer under ambient concentrations, which suggests such a catalyst would also be inactive for ODHP with CO2."

1. In redox-active metal oxides, C-H bond activation typically happens through homolytic or heterolytic processes involving H abstraction by surface oxygen species or over an acid-base pair. In contrast, redox-inactive oxides use a MvK mechanism where hydrogen forms a hydroxide, abstracts a second hydrogen, and leads to water formation. The role of the oxidant in redox-inactive oxides is to regenerate the catalyst by reoxidizing the vacancy site or reacting with adsorbed hydrogen species.

2. CO2 activation in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves two main mechanisms: direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, or hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO. The latter mechanism is favored on the CeO2 (110) surface due to its lower barrier for CO2 dissociation, enabling more efficient activation compared to V2O5.

3. Catalysts such as Ni4/MgO, with a low CO2 dissociation barrier, can provide active oxygen species for alkane CH activation, facilitating oxidative dehydrogenation. Bifunctional catalysts containing CeO2 support show higher selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation over dry reforming, as evidenced by DFT calculations.

4. The formation of OH radicals from NOx can promote selective oxidative dehydrogenation in the absence of a solid catalyst. The high selectivity of OH radicals for oxidative dehydrogenation is attributed to their strong hydrogen abstraction strength, which prevents overoxidation and enhances the selectivity to specific products.

1. 在可氧化还原活性金属氧化物中，C-H键的活化通常通过表面氧物种的H抽象或酸碱对的异裂过程进行。相比之下，在可氧化还原惰性氧化物中，使用MvK机制，其中氢形成一个羟基，然后从C-H键或相邻的羟基组中提取第二个氢，导致水的形成。在可氧化还原惰性氧化物中，氧化剂的作用是通过重新氧化空位点提供其氧气，或者与表面吸附的氢物种反应来再生催化剂。

2. 当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，参与氧化脱氢作用的两种主要机制包括直接CO2分解以形成CO和O，或者通过氢化CO2形成HOCO或COOH然后形成CO。后一种机制在CeO2（110）表面上更受青睐，因为它的CO2分解壁垒较低，能够更有效地激活。

3. 如Ni4/MgO这样的催化剂，由于其低的CO2分解壁垒，可以提供烷基CH激活的活性氧物种，从而促进氧化脱氢作用。含有CeO2支持的双功能催化剂显示出更高的选择性，用于氧化脱氢作用而不是干重整，这在DFT计算中得到了证明。

4. 气态NOx的形成可以促进在没有固体催化剂的情况下选择性的氧化脱氢作用。OH自由基的选择性对于氧化脱氢作用的高选择性归因于它们强大的氢抽象能力，这防止了过氧化作用并增强了特定产物的选择性。
