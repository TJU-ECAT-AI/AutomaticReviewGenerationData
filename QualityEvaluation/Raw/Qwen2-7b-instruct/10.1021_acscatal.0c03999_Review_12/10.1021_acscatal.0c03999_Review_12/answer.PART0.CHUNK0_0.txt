6. In redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group. (269)

In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies. (273-275)

In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the CH bond must first be activated. In metal oxides, this commonly occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acid-base pair. (266-268)

For the case of CO2, its high stability can be problematic for activation to oxidize the surface. Therefore, finding a catalyst with a strong affinity for CO2 and its dissociation is an important criterion for oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2. (276)

Meanwhile, on a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy. (28)

In contrast, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily on the CeO2 (110) surface with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies. (277)

Transition metals, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have also been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation. One study found a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV could be obtained on Ni4/MgO which provides active oxygen species for alkane CH activation. (281)

On catalysts with strong basic sites, such as MgO, CO2 can interact strongly with surface sites and poison the catalyst, which is an issue when considering CO2 as an oxidant. (287)

In an early work, Rozanska et al. have investigated oxidative dehydrogenation on vanadia using DFT for a cluster model, and compared the differences between O2 and N2O as oxidants. (177)

Using N2O as an oxidant has also been explored in metalorganic framework (MOF) systems for alkane partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation. (292)

Another perspective for the participation of NOx in oxidative dehydrogenation has been introduced in a recent experimental and theoretical study by Annamalai et al. (296)

1. Redox-active oxides use the MvK mechanism for activation, involving hydrogen abstraction from a CH bond or a hydroxyl group. Redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, reduce the oxidant directly onto the catalyst surface without forming a vacancy. Catalysts for CO2 activation require a strong affinity for CO2 and its dissociation. CeO2 surfaces with oxygen vacancies allow easier CO2 dissociation than pure V2O5 surfaces. Transition metals, especially in subnanometer clusters, can provide low CO2 dissociation barriers for alkane CH activation. Basic sites on catalysts, like MgO, can strongly interact with CO2, poisoning the catalyst when using CO2 as an oxidant.

2. Vanadia, using DFT for a cluster model, showed differences in oxidative dehydrogenation between O2 and N2O as oxidants. Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) have been explored for alkane partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation using N2O as an oxidant. 

3. NOx can promote oxidative dehydrogenation through the formation of OH radicals. The high selectivity of OH radicals for oxidative dehydrogenation is attributed to their strong hydrogen abstraction strength, preventing overoxidation and maintaining selectivity. NOx can also generate OH radicals under oxidative dehydrogenation conditions, contributing to the process.

1. 在活性氧化物中，通常使用MvK机制进行激活，涉及从CH键或邻近羟基组抽象氢。不活性氧化物如MgO和La2O3直接将氧化剂减少到催化剂表面，而无需形成空位。对于CO2激活，需要催化剂对CO2有强烈的亲和力和其分解能力。CeO2表面含有氧空位时，CO2分解更容易，比纯V2O5表面的能量更低。过渡金属，尤其是亚纳米簇，可以提供低CO2分解壁垒，用于烷烃CH激活。基本位点如MgO可以强烈与CO2相互作用，当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，会毒害催化剂。

2. 使用DFT的范德华模型，vanadia显示了O2和N2O作为氧化剂在氧化脱氢之间的差异。金属有机框架（MOF）已被探索用于烷烃部分氧化和氧化脱氢，使用N2O作为氧化剂。

3. NOx可以通过形成OH自由基促进氧化脱氢。OH自由基对于氧化脱氢的高度选择性归因于它们强大的氢抽象强度，防止过氧化并保持选择性。在氧化脱氢条件下，NOx也可以生成OH自由基，参与这一过程。
