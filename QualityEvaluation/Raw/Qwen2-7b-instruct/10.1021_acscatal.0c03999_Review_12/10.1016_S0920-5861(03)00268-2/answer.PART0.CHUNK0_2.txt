[1] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane increased with increasing reaction temperatures."
[2] "Furthermore, in the dehydrogenation of n-butane and iso-butane, a promoting effect of CO2 on butane conversion and butenes yields was observed over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, though the promotion effect was small."
[3] "UV-Vis analyses of the fresh and the reacted catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2 revealed that CO2 kept the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a state of oxidation slightly higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[4] "We propose that maintenance of the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species might be one of the important factors for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, are capable of undergoing changes in oxidation state during the reaction process, which aids in the activation of C-H bonds. For instance, the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst maintains a higher oxidation state when CO2 is present, potentially facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. This is in contrast to redox-inactive catalysts, where the mechanism might involve more direct activation of CO2 without the benefit of catalyst redox properties.

In the context of CO2 as an oxidant, its role is crucial in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, especially propane. The CO2 molecule can dissociate and contribute to the oxidative environment, enhancing the activation of C-H bonds. The V2O5 catalyst, when supported on oxidized diamond, shows increased activity in the presence of CO2 for dehydrogenation reactions. This is attributed to the maintenance of higher oxidation states of vanadium species, which might improve the efficiency of CO2 activation and the subsequent dehydrogenation process.

Different catalysts, including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, exhibit varying effectiveness in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The proposed mechanisms involve the dissociation of CO2, followed by its participation in the oxidative process. Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation play a critical role in determining the efficiency of different catalysts. Catalysts that can effectively lower these barriers tend to perform better in CO2 activation and subsequent dehydrogenation reactions.

氧化脱氢反应中，烷烃的C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机制在可氧化还原活性和不可氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。可氧化还原活性催化剂，如V2O5，能够在反应过程中经历氧化状态的变化，这有助于C-H键的活化。例如，以氧化金刚石为支持的V2O5催化剂在CO2存在的条件下保持较高的氧化状态，可能有利于烷烃的氧化脱氢。相比之下，对于不可氧化还原活性催化剂而言，机制可能涉及更直接的CO2激活，而没有催化剂氧化还原性质的好处。

在CO2作为氧化剂的背景下，其作用至关重要，尤其是在丙烷的氧化脱氢反应中。CO2分子可以分解并提供氧化环境，增强C-H键的活化。以氧化金刚石为支持的V2O5催化剂，在CO2存在的条件下表现出更高的活性，这对于脱氢反应特别重要。这一现象归因于V物种维持较高氧化状态的能力，这可能提高了CO2激活和随后的脱氢过程的效率。

不同催化剂，包括V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇，对于丙烷的氧化脱氢表现出不同的有效性。提出的机制涉及CO2的分解，随后是其参与氧化过程。CO2分解的能量壁垒在确定不同催化剂效率方面起着关键作用。能够有效降低这些壁垒的催化剂通常在CO2激活及其后续脱氢反应中表现得更好。
