The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as Cr2O3 and V2O5, can undergo oxidation and reduction cycles, facilitating the activation of CO2 and the dehydrogenation of alkanes. Redox-inactive catalysts, like VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, typically do not undergo such cycles and rely on other mechanisms for CO2 activation. In the case of V2O5, CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane by maintaining a higher oxidation state of vanadium species, which enhances the catalytic activity. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on their ability to maintain the desired oxidation state of the active metal and facilitate the necessary chemical transformations. Higher reaction temperatures can increase propylene yields over V2O5 catalysts, likely due to improved stability of the higher oxidation state of vanadium species.

在氧化脱氢反应中，不同类型的催化剂（活性和非活性）在烷烃的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制上存在差异。活性催化剂如Cr2O3和V2O5可以经历氧化还原周期，从而促进CO2的激活和烷烃的脱氢。非活性催化剂如VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇通常不进行此类循环，而是依赖其他机制来激活CO2。对于V2O5而言，CO2通过保持钒物种的更高氧化态促进了丙烷的脱氢，这增强了催化剂的活性。不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中的CO2激活效果取决于它们维持活性金属所需氧化状态的能力以及促进必要的化学转变的能力。提高反应温度可以增加V2O5催化剂的丙烯产率，这可能与保持钒物种的更高氧化态稳定性有关。
