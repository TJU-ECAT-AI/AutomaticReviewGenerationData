[1] "Among oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibited the highest alkene yield for the dehydrogenation of C3C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2."
[2] "A support effect of oxidized diamond for Cr2O3- and V2O5-loaded catalysts was observed in the presence of CO2."
[3] "Propylene yields over oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst were increased with increasing reaction temperature."
[4] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts might be to maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves the activation of C-H bonds through redox reactions facilitated by metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, along with CeO2 and transition metal clusters, are capable of activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. These catalysts promote the dissociation of CO2 into CO and O2, which can then participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts may not effectively activate CO2. The effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 depends on their ability to maintain the oxidation state of metal species, especially chromium and vanadium, which facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction. Higher reaction temperatures enhance the conversion of propane to propylene, likely due to increased CO2's role in maintaining the oxidation state of these metal species.

氧化脱氢反应涉及通过金属氧化物催化剂促进的C-H键活化。如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇等具有还原性的催化剂，能够激活CO2进行丙烷的氧化脱氢。这些催化剂促进CO2分解为CO和O2，这些产物可以参与氧化脱氢过程。相比之下，不具有还原性的催化剂可能无法有效地激活CO2。不同催化剂在激活CO2方面的有效性取决于其维持金属物种氧化态的能力，尤其是铬和钒，这有利于催化反应。提高反应温度可以增强丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率，这可能是因为CO2在维持这些金属物种的氧化态方面的作用。
