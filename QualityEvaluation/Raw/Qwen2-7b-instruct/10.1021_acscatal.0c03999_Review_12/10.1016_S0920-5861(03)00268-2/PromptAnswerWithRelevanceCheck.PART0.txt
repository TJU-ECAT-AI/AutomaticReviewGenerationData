The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involve different processes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, utilize the redox properties of vanadium to activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation. The CO2 is split into CO and O2, which then participate in the dehydrogenation process. The redox-inactive catalysts, like CeO2 and transition metal clusters, typically rely on other mechanisms to activate CO2, often involving adsorption and subsequent activation through the catalyst surface.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the V2O5 catalysts were found to be particularly effective. The proposed mechanism involves maintaining the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species through the presence of CO2, which facilitates the activation of CO2 and the subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The role of CO2 is crucial in stabilizing these high oxidation states, thereby enhancing the catalytic activities of the V2O5 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as Cr2O3 and V2O5, can undergo oxidation and reduction cycles, facilitating the activation of CO2 and the dehydrogenation of alkanes. Redox-inactive catalysts, like VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, typically do not undergo such cycles and rely on other mechanisms for CO2 activation. In the case of V2O5, CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane by maintaining a higher oxidation state of vanadium species, which enhances the catalytic activity. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on their ability to maintain the desired oxidation state of the active metal and facilitate the necessary chemical transformations. Higher reaction temperatures can increase propylene yields over V2O5 catalysts, likely due to improved stability of the higher oxidation state of vanadium species.

在氧化脱氢反应中，不同类型的催化剂（活性和非活性）在烷烃的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制上存在差异。活性催化剂如Cr2O3和V2O5可以经历氧化还原周期，从而促进CO2的激活和烷烃的脱氢。非活性催化剂如VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇通常不进行此类循环，而是依赖其他机制来激活CO2。对于V2O5而言，CO2通过保持钒物种的更高氧化态促进了丙烷的脱氢，这增强了催化剂的活性。不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中的CO2激活效果取决于它们维持活性金属所需氧化状态的能力以及促进必要的化学转变的能力。提高反应温度可以增加V2O5催化剂的丙烯产率，这可能与保持钒物种的更高氧化态稳定性有关。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, are capable of undergoing changes in oxidation state during the reaction process, which aids in the activation of C-H bonds. For instance, the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst maintains a higher oxidation state when CO2 is present, potentially facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. This is in contrast to redox-inactive catalysts, where the mechanism might involve more direct activation of CO2 without the benefit of catalyst redox properties.

In the context of CO2 as an oxidant, its role is crucial in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, especially propane. The CO2 molecule can dissociate and contribute to the oxidative environment, enhancing the activation of C-H bonds. The V2O5 catalyst, when supported on oxidized diamond, shows increased activity in the presence of CO2 for dehydrogenation reactions. This is attributed to the maintenance of higher oxidation states of vanadium species, which might improve the efficiency of CO2 activation and the subsequent dehydrogenation process.

Different catalysts, including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, exhibit varying effectiveness in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The proposed mechanisms involve the dissociation of CO2, followed by its participation in the oxidative process. Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation play a critical role in determining the efficiency of different catalysts. Catalysts that can effectively lower these barriers tend to perform better in CO2 activation and subsequent dehydrogenation reactions.

氧化脱氢反应中，烷烃的C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机制在可氧化还原活性和不可氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。可氧化还原活性催化剂，如V2O5，能够在反应过程中经历氧化状态的变化，这有助于C-H键的活化。例如，以氧化金刚石为支持的V2O5催化剂在CO2存在的条件下保持较高的氧化状态，可能有利于烷烃的氧化脱氢。相比之下，对于不可氧化还原活性催化剂而言，机制可能涉及更直接的CO2激活，而没有催化剂氧化还原性质的好处。

在CO2作为氧化剂的背景下，其作用至关重要，尤其是在丙烷的氧化脱氢反应中。CO2分子可以分解并提供氧化环境，增强C-H键的活化。以氧化金刚石为支持的V2O5催化剂，在CO2存在的条件下表现出更高的活性，这对于脱氢反应特别重要。这一现象归因于V物种维持较高氧化状态的能力，这可能提高了CO2激活和随后的脱氢过程的效率。

不同催化剂，包括V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇，对于丙烷的氧化脱氢表现出不同的有效性。提出的机制涉及CO2的分解，随后是其参与氧化过程。CO2分解的能量壁垒在确定不同催化剂效率方面起着关键作用。能够有效降低这些壁垒的催化剂通常在CO2激活及其后续脱氢反应中表现得更好。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves the activation of C-H bonds through redox reactions facilitated by metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, along with CeO2 and transition metal clusters, are capable of activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. These catalysts promote the dissociation of CO2 into CO and O2, which can then participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts may not effectively activate CO2. The effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 depends on their ability to maintain the oxidation state of metal species, especially chromium and vanadium, which facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction. Higher reaction temperatures enhance the conversion of propane to propylene, likely due to increased CO2's role in maintaining the oxidation state of these metal species.

Comparing redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves distinct mechanisms for C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, facilitate the oxidative dehydrogenation process by maintaining higher oxidation states of their metal species, particularly chromium and vanadium. The role of CO2 in this context is crucial, as it helps to stabilize these higher oxidation states, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity.

Redox-inactive catalysts, on the other hand, may not exhibit the same efficiency in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation, as they lack the ability to undergo redox reactions. Traditional oxidants, like oxygen, play a significant role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, facilitating the breaking of C-H bonds through direct oxidation reactions.

In the case of V2O5 and related catalysts, the presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture allows for the maintenance of higher oxidation states of vanadium species, which is essential for the efficient activation of CO2 and the subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. This leads to improved catalytic activities compared to redox-inactive catalysts.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 catalysts stand out due to their ability to maintain high oxidation states of their metal components in the presence of CO2. This enhanced redox capability facilitates more efficient CO2 activation and oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

As for CeO2 and transition metal clusters, their roles in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation are less clear from the provided information. However, based on the general principles of catalysis, it can be inferred that these catalysts might require specific conditions or additional components to effectively activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

In conclusion, the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves complex interplays between catalyst properties, redox chemistry, and the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. Redox-active catalysts, particularly those containing chromium and vanadium, demonstrate superior performance in this context, likely due to their ability to maintain high oxidation states of their metal components, thus enhancing CO2 activation and oxidative dehydrogenation efficiency.

比较红氧化合物和非红氧化合物金属氧化物催化剂，烷烃的氧化脱氢涉及C-H键活化和催化剂再生的不同机制。具有还原活性的催化剂，例如V2O5，通过保持其金属成分的更高氧化态来促进氧化脱氢过程，特别是铬和钒。在这一过程中，二氧化碳的作用至关重要，因为它有助于稳定这些更高氧化态，从而增强催化活性。

非还原活性催化剂可能无法像红氧化合物那样高效激活二氧化碳进行氧化脱氢，因为它们缺乏进行氧化反应的能力。传统的氧化剂，如氧气，在烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中发挥着重要作用，通过直接氧化反应来破坏C-H键。

对于V2O5及其相关催化剂来说，在二氧化碳的存在下，能够维持钒物种的高氧化状态，这是关键。这促进了二氧化碳的有效激活和烷烃的氧化脱氢，从而提高了与非还原活性催化剂相比的催化活性。

关于不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中激活二氧化碳的有效性，V2O5和VOx/SiO2催化剂脱颖而出，因为它们能够在其存在下有效保持金属成分的高氧化态。这种增强的还原能力促进了二氧化碳激活和氧化脱氢过程的效率。

至于CeO2和过渡金属簇，它们在激活二氧化碳进行氧化脱氢中的作用尚不明确。然而，根据催化的一般原则，可以推断，这些催化剂可能需要特定条件或额外的成分才能有效地激活二氧化碳进行烷烃的氧化脱氢。

总之，烷烃的氧化脱氢涉及复杂的相互作用，包括催化剂特性、还原化学和传统氧化剂以及二氧化碳的作用。具有还原活性的催化剂，尤其是含有铬和钒的催化剂，表现出更优的性能，可能由于能够保持其金属成分的高氧化态，因此增强了二氧化碳激活和氧化脱氢的效率。
