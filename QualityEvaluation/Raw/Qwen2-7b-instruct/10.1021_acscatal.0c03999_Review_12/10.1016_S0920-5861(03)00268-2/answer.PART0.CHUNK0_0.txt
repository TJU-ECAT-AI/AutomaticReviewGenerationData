[1] "Among oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibited the highest alkene yield for the dehydrogenation of C3C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2."
[2] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts might be to maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involve different processes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, utilize the redox properties of vanadium to activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation. The CO2 is split into CO and O2, which then participate in the dehydrogenation process. The redox-inactive catalysts, like CeO2 and transition metal clusters, typically rely on other mechanisms to activate CO2, often involving adsorption and subsequent activation through the catalyst surface.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the V2O5 catalysts were found to be particularly effective. The proposed mechanism involves maintaining the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species through the presence of CO2, which facilitates the activation of CO2 and the subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The role of CO2 is crucial in stabilizing these high oxidation states, thereby enhancing the catalytic activities of the V2O5 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane.

氧化脱氢反应中，烷烃的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制在红氧化活性和非红氧化活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。红氧化活性催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，利用钒的氧化还原性质来激活CO2进行氧化脱氢。CO2被分裂成CO和O2，然后参与脱氢过程。而红氧化不活跃催化剂，如CeO2和过渡金属簇，通常依赖其他机制激活CO2，通常涉及吸附并通过催化剂表面激活。

关于不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中激活CO2的有效性，V2O5催化剂特别有效。提议的机制包括通过CO2维持铬和钒物种的较高氧化状态，这促进了CO2的激活以及随后的丙烷氧化脱氢。CO2的作用至关重要，因为它稳定这些高氧化状态，从而增强V2O5催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的催化活性。
