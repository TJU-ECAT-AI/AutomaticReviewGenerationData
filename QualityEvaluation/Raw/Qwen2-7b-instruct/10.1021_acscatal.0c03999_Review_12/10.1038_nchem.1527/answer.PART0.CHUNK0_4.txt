[1] "Significant methane reserves are currently found in stranded locations, and utilizing these reserves will require strategies for their efficient conversion to higher-value and/or more transportable products1."
[2] "However, the reactions with O2 are highly exothermic, and can increase local temperatures within reactors by 150300 8C, thereby presenting significant heat management and reactor design issues."
[3] "New catalytic strategies to enhance the selective conversion of methane to olefins or to other value-added intermediates with lower heat emission are therefore pivotal to developing viable methane conversion processes1623."
[4] "Note, however, that the change in entropy for CH2S* coupling is significantly more favourable than that for CH bond activation."
[5] "These results demonstrate that metal sulfides and, more generally, transition-metal chalcogenides, offer the ability to substantially control the conversion and selective oxidation of methane to ethylene by sulfur."

The literature highlights the challenges and opportunities in converting stranded methane reserves into higher-value products through selective catalytic processes. It emphasizes the importance of developing catalysts that can efficiently and selectively convert methane to olefins or other value-added intermediates with minimized heat emissions. The document notes that sulfur, due to its lower thermodynamic drive for methane over-oxidation compared to oxygen, can serve as an effective soft oxidant for methane conversion. The literature also discusses the role of entropy changes in determining the selectivity of the conversion process, particularly in the context of coupling methane intermediates to form ethylene. Metal sulfides and transition-metal chalcogenides are highlighted as materials that can effectively control methane conversion and selective oxidation by sulfur, offering potential solutions for the conversion of methane to ethylene with lower heat emission. Additionally, sulfur is described as a redox mediator for oxygen oxidation in the described approach.
