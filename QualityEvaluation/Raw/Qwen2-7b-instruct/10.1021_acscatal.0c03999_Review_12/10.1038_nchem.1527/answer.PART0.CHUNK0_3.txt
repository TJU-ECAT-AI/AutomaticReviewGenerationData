Sulfur as a selective soft oxidant for catalytic methane conversion probed by experiment and theory Qingjun Zhu1, Staci L. Wegener1, Chao Xie1, Obioma Uche2, Matthew Neurock2* and Tobin J. Marks1*

Developing efficient catalytic processes to convert methane into useful feedstocks relies critically upon devising new coupling processes that use abundant, thermodynamically mild oxidants together with selective catalysts. We report here on elemental sulfur as a promising soft oxidant for selective methane conversion to ethylene over MoS2, RuS2, TiS2, PdS and Pd/ZrO2 catalysts. Experiments and density functional theory reveal that methane conversion is directly correlated with surface metalsulfur bond strengths.

The anticipated long-term decline in petroleum reserves coupled with increasing worldwide energy demands will require alternative hydrocarbon feedstocks and conversion processes to produce fuels and basic chemical intermediates such as ethylene and propene1. Methane, the principal component of natural gas, is proposed as a suitable alternative because of its abundant reserves and high hydrogen:carbon ratio24.

Significant methane reserves are currently found in stranded locations, and utilizing these reserves will require strategies for their efficient conversion to higher-value and/or more transportable products10. Indeed, for methane to be a viable carbon feedstock, more selective, less capital-intensive conversion processes are neededa true grand challenge11.

In comparison to O2, the thermodynamic driving force for methane over-oxidation by S2 is significantly less (it is a softer oxidant; see Table 1 for a thermodynamic comparison of O2 and S2 as oxidants)24,25.

Both methane conversion and the selectivity of the subsequent conversion to ethylene can be linearly correlated with the catalyst metalsulfur (MS) bond strength (defined here as the energy to remove atomic sulfur as H2S from the sulfide surface, using H2), and that the two relationships are inversely related to one another. The sites that are most active for methane activation involve weakly bound surface sulfur atoms, which promote hydrogen abstraction, whereas those that are most selective involve strongly bound surface sulfur atoms, which facilitate hydrocarbon fragment coupling to C2 products and suppress the over-oxidation of methane.

Higher methane:sulfur (CH4/S) feed ratios and higher temperatures enhance methane conversion and ethylene selectivity, and at the same time appear to reduce the active sulfide catalysts and increase the metal:sulfur compositions at the surface. This in turn decreases overall conversion while increasing the selectivity to ethylene.

The highest methane-to-ethylene selectivity is found here for supported PdSx catalysts operating at relatively high temperatures, high CH4/S ratios and short contact times.

Catalytic reactions were carried out in a flow reactor specially designed to generate gaseous sulfur38 as S2 for reactions with hydrocarbons, using argon as the balance gas.

Both methane conversion and ethylene selectivity (reported as two times the moles of ethylene produced/moles of methane reacted) increase markedly with increasing reaction temperature for all catalysts examined.

CHx coupling can conceivably occur either on the surface of the catalyst or in the gas phase. The increased selectivity and conversion with increasing temperature reported in Fig. 2 in principle supports both surface as well as gas-phase CHx coupling pathways, because increasing the temperature or conversion will increase CHx species formation on the surface as well as in the gas phase.

First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to help understand the reaction pathways and mechanisms, the nature of the active catalytic sites and the effects of the catalyst, as well as the reaction conditions on methane conversion and the selective formation of ethylene.

The rate of methane conversion is controlled by the activation of the initial CH3H bond, whereas catalytic selectivity for ethylene is controlled by the rate of coupling of two bound methylene (CH2S*) fragments to form ethylene versus the rate of further CH bond activation to ultimately form CS2.

The computed barriers for methane activation over the different metal sulfides reported in Fig. 4 increase with increasing MS bond strength as MoS2 . RuS2 PdS . TiS2 and directly track the

The document discusses the use of elemental sulfur as a selective soft oxidant for catalytic methane conversion to ethylene. It highlights the direct correlation between methane conversion and surface metalsulfur bond strengths. Catalysts such as MoS2, RuS2, TiS2, PdS, and Pd/ZrO2 are found to be effective. Higher methane:sulfur (CH4/S) feed ratios and higher temperatures enhance methane conversion and ethylene selectivity. Supported PdSx catalysts are noted to exhibit the highest methane-to-ethylene selectivity. The document also mentions the use of first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand the reaction mechanisms and the nature of the active catalytic sites.

Sulfur is considered a softer oxidant compared to oxygen, leading to a less thermodynamically favorable over-oxidation of methane. This makes sulfur a promising soft oxidant for selective methane conversion.

The selectivity and conversion rates increase with temperature, supporting both surface and gas-phase coupling pathways for methane conversion. This is attributed to the increased formation of CHx species on the surface and in the gas phase with increasing temperature and conversion.

The rate of methane conversion is controlled by the activation of the initial CH3H bond, while the selectivity for ethylene is controlled by the rate of coupling of two bound methylene (CH2S*) fragments to form ethylene. The calculations suggest that the metal-sulfur (MS) bond strength influences both the activation of methane and the coupling of CH2S* fragments to form ethylene.

The document does not extensively compare and contrast mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, nor does it specifically discuss the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It focuses on the use of sulfur as an oxidant for methane conversion and provides insights into the relationship between sulfur bond strengths and the conversion and selectivity of methane to ethylene.
