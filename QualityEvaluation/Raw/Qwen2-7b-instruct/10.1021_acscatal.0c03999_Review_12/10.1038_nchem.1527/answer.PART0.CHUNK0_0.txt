Sulfur as a selective soft oxidant for catalytic methane conversion probed by experiment and theory Qingjun Zhu1, Staci L. Wegener1, Chao Xie1, Obioma Uche2, Matthew Neurock2* and Tobin J. Marks1*

Significant methane reserves are currently found in stranded locations, and utilizing these reserves will require strategies for their efficient conversion to higher-value and/or more transportable products1. Methane, the principal component of natural gas, is proposed as a suitable alternative because of its abun- dant reserves and high hydrogen:carbon ratio24.

In comparison to O2, the thermodynamic driving force for methane over-oxidation by S2 is significantly less (it is a softer oxidant; see Table 1 for a thermodynamic comparison of O2 and S2 as oxidants)24,25. This result arises primarily from the weaker CS and HS bonds and the lower bond enthalpies of the expected inter- mediates and products in comparison with those involving O2.

The anticipated long-term decline in petroleum reserves coupled with increasing worldwide energy demands will require alternative hydrocarbon feedstocks and conversion processes to produce fuels and basic chemical intermediates such as ethylene and propene1.

The use of sulfur as the oxidant in methane conversion may alleviate engineering issues associated with the significant local temperature excursions that occur when O2 is used.

Both methane conversion and ethylene selectivity (reported as two times the moles of ethylene produced/moles of methane reacted) increase markedly with increasing reaction temperature for all cata- lysts examined. The selectivity for ethylene is also strongly catalyst- dependent (Fig. 2b), following the trend PdS . TiS2 . RuS2 . MoS2.

In contrast to these results, computed trends in the methane-to- ethylene selectivity are inversely related to MS bond strength, as also shown in Fig. 4, where the barriers for ethylene formation decrease as MoS2 . RuS2 . PdS . TiS2.

CHx coupling can conceivably occur either on the surface of the catalyst or in the gas phase. The increased selectivity and conversion with increasing temperature reported in Fig. 2 in principle supports both surface as well as gas-phase CHx coupling pathways, because increasing the temperature or conversion will increase CHx species formation on the surface as well as in the gas phase.

First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to help understand the reaction pathways and mechanisms, the nature of the active catalytic sites and the effects of the catalyst, as well as the reaction conditions on methane conver- sion and the selective formation of ethylene.

Although entropy has a significant effect on the reaction rate at high reaction temperatures, the changes in entropy that result from changes in the sulfide are very small and can be neglected without loss of generality.

The computed barriers for methane activation over the different metal sulfides reported in Fig. 4 increase with increasing MS bond strength as MoS2 . RuS2 PdS . TiS2 and directly track the MS bond energy.

The resulting CH activation and CH2CH2 coupling barriers over the Pd16S7 surface SS pairs track very closely the aforementioned linear correlation with MS bond strength, and are plotted together with the barriers for all the highly sulfided surfaces in Fig. 4.

The results clearly show that the more reduced Pd16S7 state is less active but significantly more selective for ethylene.

To better understand the methane over-oxidation pathways in the present catalytic systems, methane conversion and ethylene selectivity over the PdS catalysts were also studied as a function of weight hour space velocity (WHSV; Fig. 5b).

Conclusions The results reported here demonstrate that sulfur is a promising soft oxidant for the heterogeneous catalytic conversion of methane to ethylene because the MS bonds are significantly stron- ger than the MO bonds in the corresponding O2 oxidations.

The document discusses the utilization of sulfur as a soft oxidant for the catalytic conversion of methane into ethylene. It highlights that sulfur offers a less energetic driving force for methane over-oxidation compared to oxygen, owing to weaker CS and HS bonds. This makes sulfur a potentially viable and less aggressive oxidant in the conversion process. The thermodynamic data presented in Table 1 corroborates this notion by showing that sulfur leads to a less favorable pathway for over-oxidation of methane to CS2 or other species. 

The study demonstrates that the conversion of methane to ethylene can be enhanced by increasing the reaction temperature, which in turn promotes the formation of CHx species on the surface as well as in the gas phase. Moreover, the selectivity for ethylene production is found to be strongly dependent on the catalyst type, with palladium sulfide (PdS) showing the highest selectivity. The computational models predict that the reaction barriers for methane activation and ethylene formation are directly correlated with the strength of the metal-sulfur (MS) bond. Specifically, weaker MS bonds facilitate easier hydrogen abstraction and stronger CH bond activation, whereas stronger MS bonds promote the coupling of CHx fragments to form ethylene. 

The document also emphasizes that using sulfur as an oxidant can alleviate engineering challenges associated with the significant temperature fluctuations that occur during the conversion process when using oxygen. The selectivity and conversion rates for ethylene production are found to be inversely proportional to the strength of the MS bond. The most selective catalysts for the conversion are those with the strongest MS bonds, such as palladium sulfide in the form of Pd16S7, which is partially reduced. 

In terms of methane over-oxidation pathways, the study finds that at high weight hour space velocities (WHSV), the selectivity towards ethylene increases due to shorter residence times in the catalyst bed. However, this comes with an increased risk of over-oxidation to CS2, which can be attributed to subsequent reactions of ethylene with sulfur. This scenario is supported by control experiments conducted under similar conditions.

In conclusion, the use of sulfur as a soft oxidant for the catalytic conversion of methane to ethylene offers a promising avenue for the efficient and selective production of ethylene, particularly with catalysts featuring strong metal-sulfur bonds. The document underscores the potential benefits of sulfur-based catalytic systems in mitigating engineering constraints associated with high-temperature reactions and enhancing the selectivity of methane conversion processes.

本文讨论了硫作为甲烷催化转化成乙烯的软氧化剂的应用。它强调了与氧气相比，硫在甲烷过氧化反应中提供了一个更不活跃的驱动力，主要是由于其较弱的CS和HS键。这使得硫成为甲烷转化过程中的潜在可行且相对温和的氧化剂。表1中呈现的热力学数据证实了这一观点，表明硫导致了甲烷过氧化到CS2或其他物种的更不利途径。

研究显示，通过提高反应温度可以增强甲烷转化为乙烯的转化率，这促进了表面及气相中CHx物种的形成。此外，乙烯选择性生产对于催化剂类型具有强烈的依赖性，钯硫化物（PdS）显示出最高的选择性。计算模型预测，甲烷活化和乙烯形成的反应壁垒直接与金属-硫（MS）键强度相关。具体而言，较弱的MS键有利于更容易的氢提取和更强的CH键激活，而较强的MS键则促进CHx片段的耦合以形成乙烯。  

文档还强调，使用硫作为氧化剂可以在使用氧气时遇到的显著温度波动工程问题方面提供缓解。选择性和转化率对于乙烯生产的比例与MS键强度成反比。最选择性的催化剂是那些具有最强MS键的，例如以Pd16S7形式的钯硫化物，这是一种部分还原状态。

关于甲烷过氧化途径的研究发现，在高重量小时空间速度（WHSV）下，由于床层中停留时间较短，选择性向乙烯增加。然而，这也伴随着过氧化为CS2的风险增加，这可以归因于乙烷与硫的后续反应。这种情景在相似条件下进行的控制实验中得到了支持。

总之，硫作为软氧化剂用于催化甲烷转化为乙烯提供了有前景的途径，特别是对于那些具有强金属-硫键的催化剂。该文档突出了基于硫的催化系统在缓解高温反应的工程约束和增强甲烷转化过程选择性的潜力。
