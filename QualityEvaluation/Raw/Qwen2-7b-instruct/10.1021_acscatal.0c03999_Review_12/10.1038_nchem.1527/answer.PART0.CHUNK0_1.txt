[1] "Sulfur as a selective soft oxidant for catalytic methane conversion probed by experiment and theory"
[2] "The use of sulfur as the oxidant in methane conversion may alleviate engineering issues associated with the significant local temperature excursions"
[3] "Comparison to O2, the thermodynamic driving force for methane over-oxidation by S2 is significantly less (it is a softer oxidant)"
[4] "Both methane conversion and ethylene selectivity (reported as two times the moles of ethylene produced/moles of methane reacted) increase markedly with increasing reaction temperature for all cata- lysts examined."
[5] "The selectivity for ethylene is also strongly catalyst-dependent (Fig. 2b), following the trend PdS . TiS2 . RuS2 . MoS2."
[6] "The rate of methane conversion is controlled by the activation of the initial CH3H bond, whereas catalytic selectivity for ethylene is controlled by the rate of coupling of two bound methylene (CH2S*) fragments to form ethylene versus the rate of further CH bond activation to ultimately form CS2."
[7] "The calculations for CH activation at CH3*S, CH2*S and CH*S sites on MoS2 yield barriers of 119, 63 and 178 kJ mol−1, respectively, which are significantly lower than the initial 184 kJ mol−1 barrier for methane activation."
[8] "On PdS, the barrier to CH2S* coupling to form ethylene is 183 kJ mol−1, which is only 50 kJ mol−1 greater than the barrier to activate the CH bond of CH2S* (134 kJ mol−1)."
[9] "At higher temperatures, both steps become favourable. On TiS2, the CH2S* coupling process is computed to be far more favourable than the CH activation of CH2S* species."
[10] "The results clearly show that the more reduced Pd16S7 state is less active but significantly more selective for ethylene."
[11] "Furthermore, examination using XRD indicates that the palladium in Pd/ZrO2 is converted to Pd16S7 after 2 h on stream (Supplementary Fig. S4B)."
[12] "These strong MS bonds also significantly weaken the CH2S* bonding and lower the barriers for subsequent coupling of the CH2S* intermediates to form ethylene (Supplementary Fig. S18)."
[13] "The resulting CH activation and CH2CH2 coupling barriers over the Pd16S7 surface SS pairs track very closely the aforementioned linear correlation with MS bond strength."

This study investigates the use of sulfur as a selective soft oxidant for catalytic methane conversion, focusing on its thermodynamic properties compared to oxygen, and its application on various metal sulfide catalysts like MoS2, RuS2, TiS2, PdS, and Pd/ZrO2. The activation of methane and the selectivity for ethylene formation are correlated with the strength of the surface metal-sulfur (MS) bond. Stronger MS bonds correlate with higher selectivity to ethylene, while higher methane-sulfur (CH4/S) ratios and higher temperatures enhance both methane conversion and ethylene selectivity by reducing the active sulfide catalysts and increasing the metal:sulfur compositions at the surface. The results demonstrate that sulfur can effectively convert methane to ethylene with less over-oxidation risk compared to using oxygen as the oxidant, due to sulfur's weaker thermodynamic driving force for over-oxidation reactions. The highest selectivity to ethylene is found for supported PdSx catalysts operating at high temperatures, high CH4/S ratios, and short contact times. This study highlights the potential of metal sulfides, particularly reduced Pd16S7 forms, for selective methane-to-ethylene conversion with sulfur, offering a more controlled conversion and higher selectivity compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen.

Alternative oxidants such as CO2 are not extensively discussed in this context. However, the study suggests that sulfur's thermodynamic properties might influence its effectiveness in converting methane to ethylene compared to other oxidants like oxygen. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane would depend on the specific mechanisms involved, energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, and the catalytic properties of the metal oxides considered. For instance, V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters might exhibit different behaviors in activating CO2 based on their electronic structure, surface chemistry, and the strength of interactions with CO2 molecules.

Answering specific questions regarding the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, considering the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, requires information beyond the scope of this study. This research focuses on sulfur as a soft oxidant for methane conversion and does not provide details on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes using other oxidants or catalysts. Therefore, additional studies or data would be necessary to address these questions comprehensively.

The study does not mention the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. However, it is implied that the selectivity to ethylene could be improved by reducing the active metal-sulfur composition and increasing the strength of the metal-sulfur bond, potentially leading to more controlled conversion and higher selectivity compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen. The use of sulfur as a soft oxidant might offer a way to mitigate the temperature excursions associated with using oxygen, making it a promising alternative for catalytic methane conversion processes.

本研究探讨了硫作为催化甲烷转换的可选择软氧化剂的使用，重点研究了其与氧气相比的热力学性质及其在各种金属硫化物催化剂（如MoS2、RuS2、TiS2、PdS和Pd/ZrO2）上的应用。甲烷激活和乙烯选择性形成与表面金属-硫（MS）键强度直接相关。较强的MS键强度与较高的乙烯选择性成正比，而较高的甲烷-硫（CH4/S）比例和较高温度则通过减少活性硫化物催化剂和增加表面的金属：硫组成来增强甲烷转化和乙烯选择性，从而增强甲烷转化和乙烯选择性。结果表明，与使用氧气作为氧化剂相比，硫可以有效将甲烷转化为乙烯，风险较小，因为硫对过氧化反应的热力学驱动力较弱。对于最高乙烯选择性，发现支持的PdSx催化剂在高温度、高CH4/S比例和短接触时间下表现出最佳性能。这项研究表明，金属硫化物，特别是还原后的Pd16S7形式，具有选择性地将甲烷转化为乙烯的能力，与硫结合时提供更可控的转换和更高的选择性。

对于使用其他氧化剂或催化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢作用中不同氧化剂的有效性，需要考虑特定的机制、CO2解离的能量壁垒以及所考虑的金属氧化物的特性。例如，V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇可能基于它们的电子结构、表面化学和与CO2分子的相互作用强度，在激活CO2方面表现出不同的行为。

关于在红氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂中丙烷氧化脱氢作用的机制、催化剂再生以及传统氧化剂和CO2的作用，本研究范围之外的信息是必要的。因此，需要进行额外的研究或数据以全面回答这些问题。

本研究未提及不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢作用中激活CO2的有效性。然而，可以暗示通过降低活性金属-硫组成和增加金属-硫键强度，选择性到乙烯可以得到提高，这可能导致更可控的转换和更高的选择性，相对于传统的氧化剂如氧气。因此，硫作为软氧化剂的应用可能提供了一种缓解使用氧气时出现的温度波动的方法，使其成为催化甲烷转换过程的一个有前景的替代方案。
