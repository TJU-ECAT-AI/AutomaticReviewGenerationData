Sulfur as a selective soft oxidant for catalytic methane conversion probed by experiment and theory Qingjun Zhu1, Staci L. Wegener1, Chao Xie1, Obioma Uche2, Matthew Neurock2* and Tobin J. Marks1*

Significant methane reserves are currently found in stranded locations, and utilizing these reserves will require strategies for their efficient conversion to higher-value and/or more transportable products1. Methane, the principal component of natural gas, is proposed as a suitable alternative because of its abun- dant reserves and high hydrogen:carbon ratio24.

In comparison to O2, the thermodynamic driving force for methane over-oxidation by S2 is significantly less (it is a softer oxidant; see Table 1 for a thermodynamic comparison of O2 and S2 as oxidants)24,25. This result arises primarily from the weaker CS and HS bonds and the lower bond enthalpies of the expected inter- mediates and products in comparison with those involving O2.

The anticipated long-term decline in petroleum reserves coupled with increasing worldwide energy demands will require alternative hydrocarbon feedstocks and conversion processes to produce fuels and basic chemical intermediates such as ethylene and propene1.

The use of sulfur as the oxidant in methane conversion may alleviate engineering issues associated with the significant local temperature excursions that occur when O2 is used.

Both methane conversion and ethylene selectivity (reported as two times the moles of ethylene produced/moles of methane reacted) increase markedly with increasing reaction temperature for all cata- lysts examined. The selectivity for ethylene is also strongly catalyst- dependent (Fig. 2b), following the trend PdS . TiS2 . RuS2 . MoS2.

In contrast to these results, computed trends in the methane-to- ethylene selectivity are inversely related to MS bond strength, as also shown in Fig. 4, where the barriers for ethylene formation decrease as MoS2 . RuS2 . PdS . TiS2.

CHx coupling can conceivably occur either on the surface of the catalyst or in the gas phase. The increased selectivity and conversion with increasing temperature reported in Fig. 2 in principle supports both surface as well as gas-phase CHx coupling pathways, because increasing the temperature or conversion will increase CHx species formation on the surface as well as in the gas phase.

First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to help understand the reaction pathways and mechanisms, the nature of the active catalytic sites and the effects of the catalyst, as well as the reaction conditions on methane conver- sion and the selective formation of ethylene.

Although entropy has a significant effect on the reaction rate at high reaction temperatures, the changes in entropy that result from changes in the sulfide are very small and can be neglected without loss of generality.

The computed barriers for methane activation over the different metal sulfides reported in Fig. 4 increase with increasing MS bond strength as MoS2 . RuS2 PdS . TiS2 and directly track the MS bond energy.

The resulting CH activation and CH2CH2 coupling barriers over the Pd16S7 surface SS pairs track very closely the aforementioned linear correlation with MS bond strength, and are plotted together with the barriers for all the highly sulfided surfaces in Fig. 4.

The results clearly show that the more reduced Pd16S7 state is less active but significantly more selective for ethylene.

To better understand the methane over-oxidation pathways in the present catalytic systems, methane conversion and ethylene selectivity over the PdS catalysts were also studied as a function of weight hour space velocity (WHSV; Fig. 5b).

Conclusions The results reported here demonstrate that sulfur is a promising soft oxidant for the heterogeneous catalytic conversion of methane to ethylene because the MS bonds are significantly stron- ger than the MO bonds in the corresponding O2 oxidations.

The document discusses the utilization of sulfur as a soft oxidant for the catalytic conversion of methane into ethylene. It highlights that sulfur offers a less energetic driving force for methane over-oxidation compared to oxygen, owing to weaker CS and HS bonds. This makes sulfur a potentially viable and less aggressive oxidant in the conversion process. The thermodynamic data presented in Table 1 corroborates this notion by showing that sulfur leads to a less favorable pathway for over-oxidation of methane to CS2 or other species. 

The study demonstrates that the conversion of methane to ethylene can be enhanced by increasing the reaction temperature, which in turn promotes the formation of CHx species on the surface as well as in the gas phase. Moreover, the selectivity for ethylene production is found to be strongly dependent on the catalyst type, with palladium sulfide (PdS) showing the highest selectivity. The computational models predict that the reaction barriers for methane activation and ethylene formation are directly correlated with the strength of the metal-sulfur (MS) bond. Specifically, weaker MS bonds facilitate easier hydrogen abstraction and stronger CH bond activation, whereas stronger MS bonds promote the coupling of CHx fragments to form ethylene. 

The document also emphasizes that using sulfur as an oxidant can alleviate engineering challenges associated with the significant temperature fluctuations that occur during the conversion process when using oxygen. The selectivity and conversion rates for ethylene production are found to be inversely proportional to the strength of the MS bond. The most selective catalysts for the conversion are those with the strongest MS bonds, such as palladium sulfide in the form of Pd16S7, which is partially reduced. 

In terms of methane over-oxidation pathways, the study finds that at high weight hour space velocities (WHSV), the selectivity towards ethylene increases due to shorter residence times in the catalyst bed. However, this comes with an increased risk of over-oxidation to CS2, which can be attributed to subsequent reactions of ethylene with sulfur. This scenario is supported by control experiments conducted under similar conditions.

In conclusion, the use of sulfur as a soft oxidant for the catalytic conversion of methane to ethylene offers a promising avenue for the efficient and selective production of ethylene, particularly with catalysts featuring strong metal-sulfur bonds. The document underscores the potential benefits of sulfur-based catalytic systems in mitigating engineering constraints associated with high-temperature reactions and enhancing the selectivity of methane conversion processes.

本文讨论了硫作为甲烷催化转化成乙烯的软氧化剂的应用。它强调了与氧气相比，硫在甲烷过氧化反应中提供了一个更不活跃的驱动力，主要是由于其较弱的CS和HS键。这使得硫成为甲烷转化过程中的潜在可行且相对温和的氧化剂。表1中呈现的热力学数据证实了这一观点，表明硫导致了甲烷过氧化到CS2或其他物种的更不利途径。

研究显示，通过提高反应温度可以增强甲烷转化为乙烯的转化率，这促进了表面及气相中CHx物种的形成。此外，乙烯选择性生产对于催化剂类型具有强烈的依赖性，钯硫化物（PdS）显示出最高的选择性。计算模型预测，甲烷活化和乙烯形成的反应壁垒直接与金属-硫（MS）键强度相关。具体而言，较弱的MS键有利于更容易的氢提取和更强的CH键激活，而较强的MS键则促进CHx片段的耦合以形成乙烯。  

文档还强调，使用硫作为氧化剂可以在使用氧气时遇到的显著温度波动工程问题方面提供缓解。选择性和转化率对于乙烯生产的比例与MS键强度成反比。最选择性的催化剂是那些具有最强MS键的，例如以Pd16S7形式的钯硫化物，这是一种部分还原状态。

关于甲烷过氧化途径的研究发现，在高重量小时空间速度（WHSV）下，由于床层中停留时间较短，选择性向乙烯增加。然而，这也伴随着过氧化为CS2的风险增加，这可以归因于乙烷与硫的后续反应。这种情景在相似条件下进行的控制实验中得到了支持。

总之，硫作为软氧化剂用于催化甲烷转化为乙烯提供了有前景的途径，特别是对于那些具有强金属-硫键的催化剂。该文档突出了基于硫的催化系统在缓解高温反应的工程约束和增强甲烷转化过程选择性的潜力。

This study investigates the use of sulfur as a selective soft oxidant for catalytic methane conversion, focusing on its thermodynamic properties compared to oxygen, and its application on various metal sulfide catalysts like MoS2, RuS2, TiS2, PdS, and Pd/ZrO2. The activation of methane and the selectivity for ethylene formation are correlated with the strength of the surface metal-sulfur (MS) bond. Stronger MS bonds correlate with higher selectivity to ethylene, while higher methane-sulfur (CH4/S) ratios and higher temperatures enhance both methane conversion and ethylene selectivity by reducing the active sulfide catalysts and increasing the metal:sulfur compositions at the surface. The results demonstrate that sulfur can effectively convert methane to ethylene with less over-oxidation risk compared to using oxygen as the oxidant, due to sulfur's weaker thermodynamic driving force for over-oxidation reactions. The highest selectivity to ethylene is found for supported PdSx catalysts operating at high temperatures, high CH4/S ratios, and short contact times. This study highlights the potential of metal sulfides, particularly reduced Pd16S7 forms, for selective methane-to-ethylene conversion with sulfur, offering a more controlled conversion and higher selectivity compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen.

Alternative oxidants such as CO2 are not extensively discussed in this context. However, the study suggests that sulfur's thermodynamic properties might influence its effectiveness in converting methane to ethylene compared to other oxidants like oxygen. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane would depend on the specific mechanisms involved, energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, and the catalytic properties of the metal oxides considered. For instance, V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters might exhibit different behaviors in activating CO2 based on their electronic structure, surface chemistry, and the strength of interactions with CO2 molecules.

Answering specific questions regarding the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, considering the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, requires information beyond the scope of this study. This research focuses on sulfur as a soft oxidant for methane conversion and does not provide details on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes using other oxidants or catalysts. Therefore, additional studies or data would be necessary to address these questions comprehensively.

The study does not mention the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. However, it is implied that the selectivity to ethylene could be improved by reducing the active metal-sulfur composition and increasing the strength of the metal-sulfur bond, potentially leading to more controlled conversion and higher selectivity compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen. The use of sulfur as a soft oxidant might offer a way to mitigate the temperature excursions associated with using oxygen, making it a promising alternative for catalytic methane conversion processes.

本研究探讨了硫作为催化甲烷转换的可选择软氧化剂的使用，重点研究了其与氧气相比的热力学性质及其在各种金属硫化物催化剂（如MoS2、RuS2、TiS2、PdS和Pd/ZrO2）上的应用。甲烷激活和乙烯选择性形成与表面金属-硫（MS）键强度直接相关。较强的MS键强度与较高的乙烯选择性成正比，而较高的甲烷-硫（CH4/S）比例和较高温度则通过减少活性硫化物催化剂和增加表面的金属：硫组成来增强甲烷转化和乙烯选择性，从而增强甲烷转化和乙烯选择性。结果表明，与使用氧气作为氧化剂相比，硫可以有效将甲烷转化为乙烯，风险较小，因为硫对过氧化反应的热力学驱动力较弱。对于最高乙烯选择性，发现支持的PdSx催化剂在高温度、高CH4/S比例和短接触时间下表现出最佳性能。这项研究表明，金属硫化物，特别是还原后的Pd16S7形式，具有选择性地将甲烷转化为乙烯的能力，与硫结合时提供更可控的转换和更高的选择性。

对于使用其他氧化剂或催化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢作用中不同氧化剂的有效性，需要考虑特定的机制、CO2解离的能量壁垒以及所考虑的金属氧化物的特性。例如，V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇可能基于它们的电子结构、表面化学和与CO2分子的相互作用强度，在激活CO2方面表现出不同的行为。

关于在红氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂中丙烷氧化脱氢作用的机制、催化剂再生以及传统氧化剂和CO2的作用，本研究范围之外的信息是必要的。因此，需要进行额外的研究或数据以全面回答这些问题。

本研究未提及不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢作用中激活CO2的有效性。然而，可以暗示通过降低活性金属-硫组成和增加金属-硫键强度，选择性到乙烯可以得到提高，这可能导致更可控的转换和更高的选择性，相对于传统的氧化剂如氧气。因此，硫作为软氧化剂的应用可能提供了一种缓解使用氧气时出现的温度波动的方法，使其成为催化甲烷转换过程的一个有前景的替代方案。

Sulfur as a selective soft oxidant for catalytic methane conversion probed by experiment and theory Qingjun Zhu1, Staci L. Wegener1, Chao Xie1, Obioma Uche2, Matthew Neurock2* and Tobin J. Marks1*

Developing efficient catalytic processes to convert methane into useful feedstocks relies critically upon devising new coupling processes that use abundant, thermodynamically mild oxidants together with selective catalysts. We report here on elemental sulfur as a promising soft oxidant for selective methane conversion to ethylene over MoS2, RuS2, TiS2, PdS and Pd/ZrO2 catalysts. Experiments and density functional theory reveal that methane conversion is directly correlated with surface metalsulfur bond strengths.

The anticipated long-term decline in petroleum reserves coupled with increasing worldwide energy demands will require alternative hydrocarbon feedstocks and conversion processes to produce fuels and basic chemical intermediates such as ethylene and propene1. Methane, the principal component of natural gas, is proposed as a suitable alternative because of its abundant reserves and high hydrogen:carbon ratio24.

Significant methane reserves are currently found in stranded locations, and utilizing these reserves will require strategies for their efficient conversion to higher-value and/or more transportable products10. Indeed, for methane to be a viable carbon feedstock, more selective, less capital-intensive conversion processes are neededa true grand challenge11.

In comparison to O2, the thermodynamic driving force for methane over-oxidation by S2 is significantly less (it is a softer oxidant; see Table 1 for a thermodynamic comparison of O2 and S2 as oxidants)24,25.

Both methane conversion and the selectivity of the subsequent conversion to ethylene can be linearly correlated with the catalyst metalsulfur (MS) bond strength (defined here as the energy to remove atomic sulfur as H2S from the sulfide surface, using H2), and that the two relationships are inversely related to one another. The sites that are most active for methane activation involve weakly bound surface sulfur atoms, which promote hydrogen abstraction, whereas those that are most selective involve strongly bound surface sulfur atoms, which facilitate hydrocarbon fragment coupling to C2 products and suppress the over-oxidation of methane.

Higher methane:sulfur (CH4/S) feed ratios and higher temperatures enhance methane conversion and ethylene selectivity, and at the same time appear to reduce the active sulfide catalysts and increase the metal:sulfur compositions at the surface. This in turn decreases overall conversion while increasing the selectivity to ethylene.

The highest methane-to-ethylene selectivity is found here for supported PdSx catalysts operating at relatively high temperatures, high CH4/S ratios and short contact times.

Catalytic reactions were carried out in a flow reactor specially designed to generate gaseous sulfur38 as S2 for reactions with hydrocarbons, using argon as the balance gas.

Both methane conversion and ethylene selectivity (reported as two times the moles of ethylene produced/moles of methane reacted) increase markedly with increasing reaction temperature for all catalysts examined.

CHx coupling can conceivably occur either on the surface of the catalyst or in the gas phase. The increased selectivity and conversion with increasing temperature reported in Fig. 2 in principle supports both surface as well as gas-phase CHx coupling pathways, because increasing the temperature or conversion will increase CHx species formation on the surface as well as in the gas phase.

First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to help understand the reaction pathways and mechanisms, the nature of the active catalytic sites and the effects of the catalyst, as well as the reaction conditions on methane conversion and the selective formation of ethylene.

The rate of methane conversion is controlled by the activation of the initial CH3H bond, whereas catalytic selectivity for ethylene is controlled by the rate of coupling of two bound methylene (CH2S*) fragments to form ethylene versus the rate of further CH bond activation to ultimately form CS2.

Sulfur is considered a softer oxidant compared to oxygen, leading to a less thermodynamically favorable over-oxidation of methane. This makes sulfur a promising soft oxidant for selective methane conversion.

The selectivity and conversion rates increase with temperature, supporting both surface and gas-phase coupling pathways for methane conversion. This is attributed to the increased formation of CHx species on the surface and in the gas phase with increasing temperature and conversion.

The rate of methane conversion is controlled by the activation of the initial CH3H bond, while the selectivity for ethylene is controlled by the rate of coupling of two bound methylene (CH2S*) fragments to form ethylene.
