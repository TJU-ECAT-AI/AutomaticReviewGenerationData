The literature discusses the use of sulfur as a selective soft oxidant for catalytic methane conversion to ethylene. It compares the thermodynamics of methane oxidative coupling to ethylene and over-oxidation by sulfur (S2) versus oxygen (O2), highlighting how sulfur can hinder over-oxidation. The study reports that sulfur-based catalysts, particularly palladium sulfides (PdSx), exhibit high selectivity in converting methane to ethylene under certain conditions, including high temperatures, high methane-to-sulfur ratios, and short contact times. Palladium catalysts in particular show the highest selectivity, approaching near 18% for ethylene at 1,323 K. The use of sulfur as an oxidant offers the potential to suppress the dramatic temperature excursions associated with using oxygen in oxidative methane coupling, which could relax engineering constraints related to heat removal.

文献讨论了硫作为催化甲烷转化为乙烯的选择性软氧化剂的应用。它比较了甲烷与硫（S2）和氧气（O2）之间的氧化耦合热力学，强调了硫在抑制过氧化方面的优势。研究报道，在特定条件下，特别是高温、高甲烷至硫比和短停留时间下，基于硫的催化剂，尤其是钯硫化物（PdSx），显示出将甲烷转化为乙醇的高选择性。在钯催化剂中，特别是显示出接近18%的乙醇选择性，在1,323 K时。使用硫作为氧化剂有可能抑制使用氧气在氧化甲烷耦合过程中出现的剧烈温度波动，从而缓解与热量移除相关的工程约束。
