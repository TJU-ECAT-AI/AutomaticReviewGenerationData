[1] "Results from the current flow-reactor study show that the precious metal bimetallic CoPt/ CeO2 catalyst undergoes the reforming reaction to produce syngas with enhanced activity and stability compared to the parent monometallic catalysts."
[2] "In order to replace Pt, the activities of non-precious CoMo/CeO2 and NiMo/CeO2 are investigated and the results indicate that NiMo/CeO2 is nearly as active as CoPt/CeO2 for the reforming pathway."
[3] "Furthermore, FeNi/CeO2 is identified as a promising catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation to produce ethylene."
[4] "DFT calculations are performed to further understand the different pathways of the CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 catalysts."

The study compares the catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts, including precious metal CoPt/CeO2 and non-precious metal bimetallic catalysts CoMo/CeO2, NiMo/CeO2, and FeNi/CeO2, for the reactions of CO2 and ethane. The CoPt/CeO2 catalyst shows enhanced activity and stability for the reforming reaction to produce syngas compared to its monometallic counterparts. The NiMo/CeO2 catalyst is nearly as active as CoPt/CeO2 for the reforming pathway. The FeNi/CeO2 catalyst is identified as a promising candidate for oxidative dehydrogenation to produce ethylene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are conducted to elucidate the different reaction pathways of CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 catalysts.

该研究比较了包括贵金属CoPt/CeO2和非贵金属双金属催化剂CoMo/CeO2、NiMo/CeO2和FeNi/CeO2在乙烷与二氧化碳反应中的催化性能。CoPt/CeO2催化剂在产生合成气的重整反应中表现出增强的活性和稳定性，与单金属催化剂相比。NiMo/CeO2催化剂在重整途径中与CoPt/CeO2的活性相近。FeNi/CeO2催化剂被确认为通过氧化脱氢生成乙烯的有前景候选催化剂。对CoPt/CeO2和FeNi/CeO2催化剂的不同反应路径进行了密度泛函理论（DFT）计算以阐明其机理。

[1] "In terms of selectivity, CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, and NiMo/ CeO2 favor the reforming pathway to produce syngas via the CC bond cleavage, while FeNi/CeO2 shows promising selectivity to the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway to produce ethylene via the CH bond cleavage."
[2] "DFT calculated energy profiles on CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 confirm different reaction pathways, consistent with the experimental results."

In terms of selectivity, CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, and NiMo/CeO2 favor the reforming pathway to produce syngas via the cleavage of the carbon-carbon (CC) bond, whereas FeNi/CeO2 shows promising selectivity towards the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway to produce ethylene via the cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond. Density functional theory (DFT) calculated energy profiles on CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 confirm distinct reaction pathways that align with the experimental findings.

从选择性角度来看，CoPt/CeO2、CoMo/CeO2和NiMo/CeO2倾向于通过裂解碳-碳（CC）键来形成合成气的重整途径，而FeNi/CeO2显示出通过裂解碳-氢（CH）键来生产乙烯的氧化脱氢途径的有前景选择性。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的能量轮廓图在CoPt/CeO2和FeNi/CeO2上证实了不同的反应路径，这与实验结果相一致。
