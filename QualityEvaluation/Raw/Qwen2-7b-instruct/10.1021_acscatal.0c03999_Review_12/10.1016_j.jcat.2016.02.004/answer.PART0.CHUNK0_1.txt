[1] "Results from the current flow-reactor study show that the precious metal bimetallic CoPt/ CeO2 catalyst undergoes the reforming reaction to produce syngas with enhanced activity and stability compared to the parent monometallic catalysts."
[2] "In order to replace Pt, the activities of non-precious CoMo/CeO2 and NiMo/CeO2 are investigated and the results indicate that NiMo/CeO2 is nearly as active as CoPt/CeO2 for the reforming pathway."
[3] "Furthermore, FeNi/CeO2 is identified as a promising catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation to produce ethylene."
[4] "DFT calculations are performed to further understand the different pathways of the CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 catalysts."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, involves activation of CO2 as a soft oxidant for oxidative dehydrogenation. Traditional oxidants play a crucial role in facilitating the redox cycle and promoting the activation of CO2. Transition metal clusters, including FeNi/CeO2, are effective in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The proposed mechanisms involve the dissociation of CO2 to form CO and O2, followed by the formation of reactive oxygen species that can activate the C-H bonds of propane. Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are significantly reduced when using CO2 as an oxidant, leading to more efficient oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

对于具有还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2，烷烃的氧化脱氢涉及将CO2作为软氧化剂激活。传统氧化剂在促进CO2活化过程中起着关键作用。包括FeNi/CeO2在内的过渡金属簇有效激活CO2进行丙烷的氧化脱氢。提出的机制涉及CO2的分解形成CO和O2，随后形成活性氧物种可以激活丙烷的C-H键。当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，CO2的分解能垒显著降低，导致更高效的氧化脱氢过程。
