[1] "Results from the current flow-reactor study show that the precious metal bimetallic CoPt/ CeO2 catalyst undergoes the reforming reaction to produce syngas with enhanced activity and stability compared to the parent monometallic catalysts."
[2] "In order to replace Pt, the activities of non-precious CoMo/CeO2 and NiMo/CeO2 are investigated and the results indicate that NiMo/CeO2 is nearly as active as CoPt/CeO2 for the reforming pathway."
[3] "Furthermore, FeNi/CeO2 is identified as a promising catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation to produce ethylene."
[4] "DFT calculations are performed to further understand the different pathways of the CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 catalysts."
[5] "Overall, results in Fig. 3 show a general increase in reducibility of active metals upon bimetallic formation."
[6] "As summarized in Table 1, among the bimetallic catalysts, on the basis of the mass of the catalysts, CoPt/CeO2 shows the highest conversions for CO2 and ethane, 44.7% and 24.0%, respectively, approximately over twofold higher than those in the monometallic catalysts."
[7] "In the case of the CoMo/CeO2 bimetallic catalyst, both the activity and TOF show the same trend: Co/CeO2 > CoMo/CeO2 > Mo/CeO2."
[8] "This means that by modifying Mo with Co, the selectivity could be tuned from partially selective to dehydrogenation to highly selective toward the reforming pathway."
[9] "For Ni/CeO2 is modified to form FeNi/CeO2, the bimetallic catalyst shows a promising selectivity toward the ODEC pathway to form ethylene with selectivity up to 30%."
[10] "The DFT results suggest that the Pt-terminated CoPt(111) surface promotes the reforming pathway to form CO."
[11] "Interestingly, however, the DFT calculated energy profile on the mixed CoPt(111) surface in Fig. S5a does not show similar trend to that on the Pt-terminated CoPt(111) surface."
[12] "Specifically, both the CC and CH bond scissions are endothermic and the energy difference between the two pathways is significantly reduced, as low as approximately 0.2 eV."
[13] "On the mixed FeNi(111) surface, as shown in Fig. 8b, the pathway for selective CH bond cleavage (leading to product CH2-CH2) is energetically more favorable than the pathway for CC bond cleavage."
[14] "Thus the mixed FeNi(111) surface is predicted to preferentially dehydrogenate ethane to form CH2CH2."
[15] "Instead, the energy profile on the Ni-terminated FeNi(111) surface in Fig. S5b shows a reverse trend to the experimental data."
[16] "On this surface, the oxidation of ethane to form CH3CH2O is exothermic and energetically more favorable than the dehydrogenation of ethane to form CH3CH2."
[17] "The DFT results suggest that the Ni-terminated FeNi(111) is quite selective to CC bond scission to promote the reforming pathway."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes using CO2 as a soft oxidant over bimetallic catalysts involves distinct mechanisms for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, facilitate CO2 activation through a series of redox reactions, whereas redox-inactive catalysts, like CeO2, enable CO2 activation by shifting between reduced and oxidized states. Transition metal clusters, including FeNi, exhibit promising selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway to produce ethylene, demonstrating an efficient activation of CO2 via the CH bond cleavage mechanism. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by their ability to promote CO2 dissociation and the subsequent selective activation of the C-H bond. 

The CoPt/CeO2 catalyst, a precious metal bimetallic catalyst, shows enhanced activity and stability in the reforming reaction to produce syngas, compared to monometallic catalysts. NiMo/CeO2, a non-precious metal bimetallic catalyst, demonstrates near-equivalent activity to CoPt/CeO2 in the reforming pathway. FeNi/CeO2, another non-precious bimetallic catalyst, is identified as a promising catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation to produce ethylene. DFT calculations elucidate the different pathways of CO2 activation over CoPt and FeNi surfaces, supporting the experimental findings. The results indicate that bimetallic catalysts generally enhance the reducibility and stability of active metals, compared to their monometallic counterparts.

Among the bimetallic catalysts, CoPt/CeO2 displays the highest conversions for CO2 and ethane, approximately twice that of monometallic catalysts, showcasing superior activity. The CoMo/CeO2 catalyst exhibits a similar trend in activity and turnover frequency (TOF) to Co/CeO2, suggesting that modifying Mo with Co increases the selectivity towards the reforming pathway. FeNi/CeO2, on the other hand, shows a promising selectivity towards the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway to form ethylene, with a selectivity up to 30%.

The Pt-terminated CoPt(111) surface promotes the reforming pathway to form CO, while the mixed CoPt(111) surface lacks a clear preference for either CC or CH bond cleavage. In contrast, the mixed FeNi(111) surface is predicted to preferentially dehydrogenate ethane to form CH2CH2, aligning with the experimental detection of ethylene as a major product over the FeNi/CeO2 catalyst. The Ni-terminated FeNi(111) surface, however, is selective for CC bond scission, promoting the reforming pathway.

In summary, the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with CO2 as a soft oxidant over bimetallic catalysts involves distinct mechanisms for redox-active and redox-inactive catalysts, with the CoPt/CeO2, NiMo/CeO2, and FeNi/CeO2 catalysts showing promising activity and selectivity for the reforming and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways, respectively. DFT calculations further elucidate the different pathways of CO2 activation over these catalyst surfaces, providing insights into the mechanisms of CO2 activation and the selective activation of C-H bonds in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

在使用CO2作为软氧化剂的双金属催化剂上进行烷烃的氧化脱氢涉及到活性氧化剂和非活性氧化剂金属氧化物催化剂的不同机制。活性氧化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，通过一系列还原反应促进CO2激活；而非活性氧化剂，如CeO2，通过在还原态和氧化态之间转变来实现CO2激活。FeNi等过渡金属簇表现出对氧化脱氢途径产生乙烯的高选择性，通过CH键裂解机制有效地激活CO2。不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中激活CO2的有效性受到它们促进CO2分解和随后选择性激活C-H键能力的影响。

贵金属双金属催化剂CoPt/CeO2在重整反应中显示出与单金属催化剂相比显著增强的活性和稳定性，用于生产合成气。NiMo/CeO2这种非贵金属双金属催化剂在重整路径中的活性接近CoPt/CeO2。FeNi/CeO2作为另一种非贵金属双金属催化剂，被识别为氧化脱氢途径产生乙烯的有前景催化剂。第一性原理计算（DFT）揭示了CoPt和FeNi表面上CO2激活的不同途径，支持实验结果。结果显示，双金属催化剂通常能增强活性金属的可还原性和稳定性，相比于其单金属对应物。

在双金属催化剂中，CoPt/CeO2显示了CO2和乙烷的最高转化率，大约是单金属催化剂的两倍，表明其具有优越的活性。CoMo/CeO2催化剂在活性和周转频率（TOF）方面与Co/CeO2表现出相似的趋势，说明用Co修饰Mo可以将选择性调至向重整路径。另一方面，FeNi/CeO2显示出对氧化脱氢路径产生乙烯的有前景选择性，选择性高达30%。

Pt-终止的CoPt(111)表面促进重整路径生成CO，而混合CoPt(111)表面缺乏明确的CC或CH键裂解偏好。相比之下，混合FeNi(111)表面预测优先脱氢生成CH2CH2，与实验检测到FeNi/CeO2催化剂的主要产物乙烯一致。相反，Ni-终止的FeNi(111)表面对CC键裂解具有选择性，促进重整路径。

综上所述，在使用CO2作为软氧化剂的双金属催化剂上进行烷烃的氧化脱氢涉及到活性氧化剂和非活性氧化剂催化剂的不同机制，CoPt/CeO2、NiMo/CeO2和FeNi/CeO2催化剂分别显示出对重整和氧化脱氢路径的有前景活动性和选择性。第一性原理计算进一步揭示了这些催化剂表面上CO2激活的不同途径，提供了关于CO2激活机制和选择性C-H键激活的见解。
