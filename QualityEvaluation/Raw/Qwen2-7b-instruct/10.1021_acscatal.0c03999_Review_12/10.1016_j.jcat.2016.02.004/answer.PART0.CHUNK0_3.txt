[1] "Results from the current flow-reactor study show that the precious metal bimetallic CoPt/ CeO2 catalyst undergoes the reforming reaction to produce syngas with enhanced activity and stability compared to the parent monometallic catalysts."
[2] "In order to replace Pt, the activities of non-precious CoMo/CeO2 and NiMo/CeO2 are investigated and the results indicate that NiMo/CeO2 is nearly as active as CoPt/CeO2 for the reforming pathway."
[3] "Furthermore, FeNi/CeO2 is identified as a promising catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation to produce ethylene."
[4] "DFT calculations are performed to further understand the different pathways of the CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 catalysts."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves the activation of CO2 for the reaction. Traditional oxidants like oxygen play a crucial role in this process. For redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, they can effectively activate CO2. The mechanism involves the dissociation of CO2 into CO and O, where CO can participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation. Transition metal clusters also show promise as catalysts for this process. The effectiveness of different catalysts lies in their ability to facilitate the dissociation of CO2 and the subsequent activation of C-H bonds. DFT calculations can provide insights into the energy barriers and pathways involved in these reactions.
