[1] "Results from the current flow-reactor study show that the precious metal bimetallic CoPt/ CeO2 catalyst undergoes the reforming reaction to produce syngas with enhanced activity and stability compared to the parent monometallic catalysts."
[2] "In order to replace Pt, the activities of non-precious CoMo/CeO2 and NiMo/CeO2 are investigated and the results indicate that NiMo/CeO2 is nearly as active as CoPt/CeO2 for the reforming pathway."
[3] "Furthermore, FeNi/CeO2 is identified as a promising catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation to produce ethylene."
[4] "The DFT calculations predict a different reaction scheme on the mixed FeNi(111) surface. On the mixed FeNi(111) surface, as shown in Fig. 8b, the pathway for selective CH bond cleavage (leading to product CH2-CH2) is energetically more favorable than the pathway for CC bond cleavage."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, facilitate CO2 activation through reversible oxidation-reduction reactions, whereas redox-inactive catalysts, like transition metal clusters, primarily rely on direct C-H bond activation. Traditional oxidants, such as O2, play a crucial role in redox-active catalysts by promoting CO2 dissociation. In contrast, CO2 acts as a soft oxidant in redox-inactive catalysts, enabling oxidative dehydrogenation without forming CO2 as a byproduct. 

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the literature discusses CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, NiMo/CeO2, and FeNi/CeO2. CoPt/CeO2 and its variants (CoMo/CeO2 and NiMo/CeO2) show high activity in reforming reactions, producing syngas via the CC bond cleavage pathway. This is attributed to the synergistic interaction between metals and the ability of CeO2 to promote active metal dispersion. On the other hand, FeNi/CeO2 demonstrates promising selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation, leading to ethylene production through the CH bond cleavage pathway. The DFT calculations confirm that the mixed FeNi(111) surface favors the CH bond cleavage, which aligns with the experimental findings.

In summary, redox-active catalysts like CeO2 enable CO2 activation through redox reactions, while redox-inactive catalysts like transition metal clusters activate C-H bonds directly. CO2 acts as a soft oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation, particularly in the context of FeNi/CeO2, facilitating ethylene production without CO2 formation.

氧化脱氢反应中，烷烃的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制在红氧化性金属氧化物催化剂与非红氧化性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。红氧化性催化剂如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2通过可逆氧化还原反应促进CO2活化，而红氧化性不活性催化剂如过渡金属簇主要依赖直接C-H键活化。传统的氧化剂，如O2，在红氧化性催化剂中起关键作用，通过促进CO2分解。相比之下，CO2作为红氧化性不活性催化剂的软氧化剂，在氧化脱氢中起到作用，允许氧化脱氢而不形成CO2副产品。

关于不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中激活CO2的有效性，文献讨论了CoPt/CeO2、CoMo/CeO2、NiMo/CeO2和FeNi/CeO2。CoPt/CeO2及其变体（CoMo/CeO2和NiMo/CeO2）在重整反应中表现出高活性，通过CC键断裂途径产生合成气。这归因于金属之间的协同作用和CeO2促进活性金属分散的能力。另一方面，FeNi/CeO2显示出在氧化脱氢中具有前景的选择性，导致乙烷通过CH键断裂途径产生。DFT计算证实混合FeNi(111)表面倾向于CH键断裂，这与实验结果一致。

综上所述，红氧化性催化剂如CeO2通过氧化还原反应促进CO2活化，而红氧化性不活性催化剂如过渡金属簇直接活化C-H键。CO2在FeNi/CeO2的背景下作为软氧化剂起到作用，促进乙烷生产，而不形成CO2副产品。
