The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, involves activation of CO2 as a soft oxidant for oxidative dehydrogenation. Traditional oxidants play a crucial role in facilitating the redox cycle and promoting the activation of CO2. Transition metal clusters, including FeNi/CeO2, are effective in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The proposed mechanisms involve the dissociation of CO2 to form CO and O2, followed by the formation of reactive oxygen species that can activate the C-H bonds of propane. Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are significantly reduced when using CO2 as an oxidant, leading to more efficient oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

[7] "In the case of the CoMo/CeO2 bimetallic catalyst, both the activity and TOF show the same trend: Co/CeO2 > CoMo/CeO2 > Mo/CeO2."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes using CO2 as a soft oxidant over bimetallic catalysts involves distinct mechanisms for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, facilitate CO2 activation through a series of redox reactions, whereas redox-inactive catalysts, like CeO2, enable CO2 activation by shifting between reduced and oxidized states. Transition metal clusters, including FeNi, exhibit promising selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway to produce ethylene, demonstrating an efficient activation of CO2 via the CH bond cleavage mechanism. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by their ability to promote CO2 dissociation and the subsequent selective activation of the C-H bond. 

The CoPt/CeO2 catalyst, a precious metal bimetallic catalyst, shows enhanced activity and stability in the reforming reaction to produce syngas, compared to monometallic catalysts. NiMo/CeO2, a non-precious metal bimetallic catalyst, demonstrates near-equivalent activity to CoPt/CeO2 in the reforming pathway. FeNi/CeO2, another non-precious bimetallic catalyst, is identified as a promising catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation to produce ethylene. DFT calculations elucidate the different pathways of CO2 activation over CoPt and FeNi surfaces, supporting the experimental findings. The results indicate that bimetallic catalysts generally enhance the reducibility and stability of active metals, compared to their monometallic counterparts.

Among the bimetallic catalysts, CoPt/CeO2 displays the highest conversions for CO2 and ethane, approximately twice that of monometallic catalysts, showcasing superior activity. The CoMo/CeO2 catalyst exhibits a similar trend in activity and turnover frequency (TOF) to Co/CeO2, suggesting that modifying Mo with Co increases the selectivity towards the reforming pathway. FeNi/CeO2, on the other hand, shows a promising selectivity towards the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway to form ethylene, with a selectivity up to 30%.

The Pt-terminated CoPt(111) surface promotes the reforming pathway to form CO, while the mixed CoPt(111) surface lacks a clear preference for either CC or CH bond cleavage. In contrast, the mixed FeNi(111) surface is predicted to preferentially dehydrogenate ethane to form CH2CH2, aligning with the experimental detection of ethylene as a major product over the FeNi/CeO2 catalyst. The Ni-terminated FeNi(111) surface, however, is selective for CC bond scission, promoting the reforming pathway.

In summary, the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with CO2 as a soft oxidant over bimetallic catalysts involves distinct mechanisms for redox-active and redox-inactive catalysts, with the CoPt/CeO2, NiMo/CeO2, and FeNi/CeO2 catalysts showing promising activity and selectivity for the reforming and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways, respectively. DFT calculations further elucidate the different pathways of CO2 activation over these catalyst surfaces, providing insights into the mechanisms of CO2 activation and the selective activation of C-H bonds in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

在使用CO2作为软氧化剂的双金属催化剂上进行烷烃的氧化脱氢涉及到活性氧化剂和非活性氧化剂金属氧化物催化剂的不同机制。活性氧化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，通过一系列还原反应促进CO2激活；而非活性氧化剂，如CeO2，通过在还原态和氧化态之间转变来实现CO2激活。FeNi等过渡金属簇表现出对氧化脱氢途径产生乙烯的高选择性，通过CH键裂解机制有效地激活CO2。不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中激活CO2的有效性受到它们促进CO2分解和随后选择性激活C-H键能力的影响。

贵金属双金属催化剂CoPt/CeO2在重整反应中显示出与单金属催化剂相比显著增强的活性和稳定性，用于生产合成气。NiMo/CeO2这种非贵金属双金属催化剂在重整路径中的活性接近CoPt/CeO2。FeNi/CeO2作为另一种非贵金属双金属催化剂，被识别为氧化脱氢途径产生乙烯的有前景催化剂。第一性原理计算（DFT）揭示了CoPt和FeNi表面上CO2激活的不同途径，支持实验结果。结果显示，双金属催化剂通常能增强活性金属的可还原性和稳定性，相比于其单金属对应物。

在双金属催化剂中，CoPt/CeO2显示了CO2和乙烷的最高转化率，大约是单金属催化剂的两倍，表明其具有优越的活性。CoMo/CeO2催化剂在活性和周转频率（TOF）方面与Co/CeO2表现出相似的趋势，说明用Co修饰Mo可以将选择性调至向重整路径。另一方面，FeNi/CeO2显示出对氧化脱氢路径产生乙烯的有前景选择性，选择性高达30%。

Pt-终止的CoPt(111)表面促进重整路径生成CO，而混合CoPt(111)表面缺乏明确的CC或CH键裂解偏好。相比之下，混合FeNi(111)表面预测优先脱氢生成CH2CH2，与实验检测到FeNi/CeO2催化剂的主要产物乙烯一致。相反，Ni-终止的FeNi(111)表面对CC键裂解具有选择性，促进重整路径。

综上所述，在使用CO2作为软氧化剂的双金属催化剂上进行烷烃的氧化脱氢涉及到活性氧化剂和非活性氧化剂催化剂的不同机制，CoPt/CeO2、NiMo/CeO2和FeNi/CeO2催化剂分别显示出对重整和氧化脱氢路径的有前景活动性和选择性。第一性原理计算进一步揭示了这些催化剂表面上CO2激活的不同途径，提供了关于CO2激活机制和选择性C-H键激活的见解。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves the activation of CO2 for the reaction. Traditional oxidants like oxygen play a crucial role in this process. For redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, they can effectively activate CO2. The mechanism involves the dissociation of CO2 into CO and O, where CO can participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation. Transition metal clusters also show promise as catalysts for this process. The effectiveness of different catalysts lies in their ability to facilitate the dissociation of CO2 and the subsequent activation of C-H bonds.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, facilitate CO2 activation through reversible oxidation-reduction reactions, whereas redox-inactive catalysts, like transition metal clusters, primarily rely on direct C-H bond activation. Traditional oxidants, such as O2, play a crucial role in redox-active catalysts by promoting CO2 dissociation. In contrast, CO2 acts as a soft oxidant in redox-inactive catalysts, enabling oxidative dehydrogenation without forming CO2 as a byproduct. 

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the literature discusses CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, NiMo/CeO2, and FeNi/CeO2. CoPt/CeO2 and its variants (CoMo/CeO2 and NiMo/CeO2) show high activity in reforming reactions, producing syngas via the CC bond cleavage pathway. This is attributed to the synergistic interaction between metals and the ability of CeO2 to promote active metal dispersion. On the other hand, FeNi/CeO2 demonstrates promising selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation, leading to ethylene production through the CH bond cleavage pathway. The DFT calculations confirm that the mixed FeNi(111) surface favors the CH bond cleavage, which aligns with the experimental findings.

In summary, redox-active catalysts like CeO2 enable CO2 activation through redox reactions, while redox-inactive catalysts like transition metal clusters activate C-H bonds directly. CO2 acts as a soft oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation, particularly in the context of FeNi/CeO2, facilitating ethylene production without CO2 formation.

氧化脱氢反应中，烷烃的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制在红氧化性金属氧化物催化剂与非红氧化性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。红氧化性催化剂如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2通过可逆氧化还原反应促进CO2活化，而红氧化性不活性催化剂如过渡金属簇主要依赖直接C-H键活化。传统的氧化剂，如O2，在红氧化性催化剂中起关键作用，通过促进CO2分解。相比之下，CO2作为红氧化性不活性催化剂的软氧化剂，在氧化脱氢中起到作用，允许氧化脱氢而不形成CO2副产品。

关于不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中激活CO2的有效性，文献讨论了CoPt/CeO2、CoMo/CeO2、NiMo/CeO2和FeNi/CeO2。CoPt/CeO2及其变体（CoMo/CeO2和NiMo/CeO2）在重整反应中表现出高活性，通过CC键断裂途径产生合成气。这归因于金属之间的协同作用和CeO2促进活性金属分散的能力。另一方面，FeNi/CeO2显示出在氧化脱氢中具有前景的选择性，导致乙烷通过CH键断裂途径产生。DFT计算证实混合FeNi(111)表面倾向于CH键断裂，这与实验结果一致。

综上所述，红氧化性催化剂如CeO2通过氧化还原反应促进CO2活化，而红氧化性不活性催化剂如过渡金属簇直接活化C-H键。CO2在FeNi/CeO2的背景下作为软氧化剂起到作用，促进乙烷生产，而不形成CO2副产品。
