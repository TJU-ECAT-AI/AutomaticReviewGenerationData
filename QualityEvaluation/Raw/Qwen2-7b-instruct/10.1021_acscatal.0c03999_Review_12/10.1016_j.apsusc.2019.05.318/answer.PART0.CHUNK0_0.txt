Comparing the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, this study found that both redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts play significant roles. Traditional oxidants and CO2 are crucial in this process, with different catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters being effective in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Each catalyst has its unique mechanism and energy barrier for CO2 dissociation, which affects their overall effectiveness.
