The question asked for a comparison of the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, including a discussion on the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

Unfortunately, the provided literature does not contain specific details about the mechanisms of C-H bond activation, catalyst regeneration, or the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer based on the given text.
