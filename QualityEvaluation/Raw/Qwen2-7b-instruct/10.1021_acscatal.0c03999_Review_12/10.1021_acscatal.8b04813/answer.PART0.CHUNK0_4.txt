The mechanisms of C-H bond activation in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involve the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which leads to the breaking of C-H bonds. Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, are more efficient in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane than redox-inactive catalysts. Transition metal clusters, however, exhibit lower efficiency due to their less reactive nature. Traditional oxidants are essential for providing the necessary oxygen for the oxidation process, while CO2 acts as a source of carbon for the formation of alcohols.

C-H键在烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中通过形成一个碳正离子中间体而被激活，导致C-H键的断裂。可氧化还原的金属氧化物催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2，在丙烷的氧化脱氢中比非可氧化还原催化剂更有效地活化CO2。相比之下，过渡金属簇的效率较低，因为它们的反应性较弱。传统的氧化剂对于提供氧化过程所需的氧至关重要，而CO2作为形成醇的碳源。
