Comparing the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, redox-active metal oxide catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2 involve direct activation of C-H bonds and regeneration through redox reactions. Transition metal clusters, including iron clusters, also show promise in this process. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts might necessitate external oxidants and CO2 for dissociative adsorption before activation can take place. Traditional oxidants, such as oxygen, play a vital role in facilitating the cleavage of C-H bonds. CO2 acts as a reactant in oxidative dehydrogenation, and its dissociation is an energy-intensive step that impacts the overall efficiency of the process.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中，活性氧金属氧化物催化剂（如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2）涉及直接激活C-H键和通过红ox反应再生。过渡金属簇，包括铁簇，也显示出在这一过程中的潜力。相比之下，非活性氧催化剂可能需要外部氧化剂和CO2进行解离吸附，然后才能发生激活。传统的氧化剂，如氧气，在氧化脱氢过程中起着至关重要的作用，有助于C-H键的断裂。CO2作为氧化脱氢的反应物，其解离是一个能量密集型步骤，影响了整个过程的效率。</ChineseVersionAnswer>
