The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active metal oxides, including V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, are highly effective in facilitating the activation of C-H bonds and the reduction of CO2 due to their redox properties. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxides, such as CeO2, are less capable of activating C-H bonds and reducing CO2. Transition metal clusters exhibit potential in both C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is contingent upon their capacity to lower the energy barrier for CO2 dissociation.

在烷烃氧化脱氢中，活性氧化金属氧化物（如V2O5和VOx/SiO2）通过其氧化还原性质，在C-H键活化和CO2还原方面表现出高效性。相比之下，非活性氧化金属氧化物（如CeO2）在活化C-H键和减少CO2方面的能力较弱。过渡金属簇在烷烃氧化脱氢中同时展现出C-H键活化和催化剂再生的潜力。这些催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中激活CO2的有效性取决于它们降低CO2解离能垒的能力。
