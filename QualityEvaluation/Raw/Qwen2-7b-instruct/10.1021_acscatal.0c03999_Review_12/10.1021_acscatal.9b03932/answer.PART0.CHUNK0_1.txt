Comparing the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, redox-active metal oxides like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 activate C-H bonds through a two-step process involving adsorption and oxidative cleavage. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxides, such as CeO2, require higher energy inputs for C-H bond activation due to their inability to undergo significant electron transfer reactions. Transition metal clusters, including iron (Fe), show potential for self-regeneration during oxidative dehydrogenation processes, offering a more sustainable solution compared to traditional oxidants. CO2 is utilized as a co-reactant in these processes, facilitating the activation of C-H bonds through the formation of carbonates or other intermediates. The effectiveness of various catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, in activating CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, influenced by the specific mechanisms and energy barriers associated with CO2 dissociation.

在氧化脱氢化烷烃的过程中，活性氧化金属氧化物如V2O5和VOx/SiO2通过两步过程激活C-H键：首先吸附烷烃，然后进行氧化断裂。相比之下，非活性氧化金属氧化物，如CeO2，由于无法进行显著的电子转移反应，通常需要更高的能量输入来激活C-H键。过渡金属簇，包括铁（Fe），显示出在氧化脱氢过程中自我再生的潜力，这可能提供一个比传统氧化剂更可持续的解决方案。二氧化碳作为这些过程中的共反应物被使用，通过形成碳酸盐或其他中间体来促进C-H键的激活。各种催化剂的有效性，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇，在丙烷的氧化脱氢化中有所不同，这取决于特定机制和二氧化碳分解的能量壁垒。
