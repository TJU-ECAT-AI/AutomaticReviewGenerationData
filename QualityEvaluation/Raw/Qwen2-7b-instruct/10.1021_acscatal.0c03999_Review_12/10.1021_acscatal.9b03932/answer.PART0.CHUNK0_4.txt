1. The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, facilitate the reduction of CO2 to form CO, which then reacts with alkane molecules to produce alkenes. This process involves the activation of C-H bonds through the formation of reactive intermediates. Catalyst regeneration often occurs through oxidation steps, where the catalyst regains its active state.

2. Redox-inactive catalysts, like transition metal clusters, typically do not directly participate in the reduction of CO2. Instead, they may enhance the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction by providing an efficient surface for alkane adsorption and reaction, without undergoing significant changes themselves during the reaction cycle. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation depends on their ability to facilitate the adsorption and reaction of alkane molecules.

3. Different catalysts, including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, have varying degrees of efficiency in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are known for their strong acid sites, which facilitate the dissociation of CO2 into CO and O atoms. CeO2 acts as a promoter for the reduction of CO2 due to its oxygen storage and release properties. Transition metal clusters offer a more heterogeneous catalytic environment, potentially leading to faster reaction kinetics due to their high surface area-to-volume ratio. However, the specific mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary among these catalysts, affecting their overall performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 在烷烃氧化脱氢反应中，活性氧化金属催化剂与非活性氧化金属催化剂在C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制上存在显著差异。活性氧化催化剂如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2通过将CO2还原为CO来促进反应，随后CO与烷烃分子反应生成烯烃。这一过程涉及C-H键的活化，通过形成活性中间体。催化剂再生通常通过氧化步骤实现，催化剂在此过程中重新获得其活性状态。

2. 非活性催化剂，如过渡金属簇，通常不直接参与CO2的还原。相反，它们可能通过提供一个高效的烷烃吸附和反应表面来增强氧化脱氢反应，而无需在反应周期中经历显著变化。这些催化剂在激活CO2用于氧化脱氢反应的有效性取决于它们促进烷烃分子吸附和反应的能力。

3. 不同催化剂，包括V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇，在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中激活CO2的有效性各不相同。V2O5和VOx/SiO2因其强酸位点而闻名，有助于CO2的分解，产生CO和O原子。CeO2作为CO2还原的促进剂，由于其氧储存和释放特性。过渡金属簇提供了更异质的催化环境，可能由于其高的表面积与体积比而导致更快的反应动力学。然而，这些催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的具体机制和CO2分解能垒不同，影响它们的整体性能。
