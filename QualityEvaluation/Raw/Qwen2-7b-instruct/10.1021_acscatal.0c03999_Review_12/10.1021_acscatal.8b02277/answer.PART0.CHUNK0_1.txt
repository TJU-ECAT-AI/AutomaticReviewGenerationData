1. The study highlights the significance of site confinement in the functionality of single-site Ni/MgO catalysts for the dry reforming of methane. Catalyst regeneration is vital for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Redox-active metal oxide catalysts efficiently employ traditional oxidants. CO2 serves as a critical reactant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Various catalysts, including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, have been evaluated for their capability to activate CO2. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by their respective mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.
