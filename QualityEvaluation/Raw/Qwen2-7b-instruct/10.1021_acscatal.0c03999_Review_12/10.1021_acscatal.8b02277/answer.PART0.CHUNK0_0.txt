<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, are more effective than redox-inactive catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane due to their ability to efficiently activate CO2. Transition metal clusters show variable effectiveness based on the specific metal used and its interaction with the support. The process involves the adsorption of CO2, followed by activation through interaction with the catalyst surface, with energy barriers being influenced by the type of catalyst and the metal-support interaction.

活性氧化物催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2，在丙烷的氧化脱氢过程中比非活性氧化物催化剂更有效，因为它们能够高效地活化CO2。过渡金属簇的有效性根据所用金属的具体类型及其与支撑材料的相互作用而变化。该过程涉及CO2的吸附，随后通过与催化剂表面的相互作用实现激活，能量壁垒受到催化剂类型和金属-支撑相互作用的影响。
