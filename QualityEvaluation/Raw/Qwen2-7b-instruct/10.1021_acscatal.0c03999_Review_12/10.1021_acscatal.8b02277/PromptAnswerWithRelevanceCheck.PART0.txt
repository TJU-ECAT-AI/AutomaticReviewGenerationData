[1] "The study investigated the importance of site confinement in single-site Ni/MgO catalysts for dry reforming of methane."
[2] "Catalyst regeneration was found to be more efficient in redox-active metal oxide catalysts compared to redox-inactive ones."
[3] "V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2 were found to be effective in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[4] "Transition metal clusters showed varying effectiveness depending on the specific metal used and its interaction with the support."
[5] "The proposed mechanism for CO2 dissociation involved the adsorption of CO2 followed by activation through the interaction with the catalyst surface."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, are more effective than redox-inactive catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane due to their ability to efficiently activate CO2. Transition metal clusters show variable effectiveness based on the specific metal used and its interaction with the support. The process involves the adsorption of CO2, followed by activation through interaction with the catalyst surface, with energy barriers being influenced by the type of catalyst and the metal-support interaction.

1. The study highlights the significance of site confinement in the functionality of single-site Ni/MgO catalysts for the dry reforming of methane. Catalyst regeneration is vital for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Redox-active metal oxide catalysts efficiently employ traditional oxidants. CO2 serves as a critical reactant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Various catalysts, including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, have been evaluated for their capability to activate CO2. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by their respective mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.
