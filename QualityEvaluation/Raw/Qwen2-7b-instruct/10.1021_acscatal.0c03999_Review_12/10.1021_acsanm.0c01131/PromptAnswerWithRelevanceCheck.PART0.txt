Answer: There are no specific quotes from the provided literature regarding the comparison of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration mechanisms for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, or the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. The document seems to focus on the development of a nanoporous zeolite-A sheltered Pd-hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor for propane dehydrogenation, but does not delve into the detailed mechanisms or comparisons requested in the question.

1. The mechanism of C-H bond activation in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes varies notably between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 enable CO2 reduction through electron transfer, whereas redox-inactive catalysts such as CeO2 do not engage in this process.
2. Transition metal clusters demonstrate high efficiency in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane because of their strong interaction with CO2 molecules. This effectiveness is also shaped by the mechanisms and energy barriers involved in CO2 dissociation.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

1. 烷烃氧化脱氢中C-H键活化机制在可氧化性金属氧化物和不可氧化性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异。可氧化性催化剂如V2O5和VOx/SiO2通过电子传递促进CO2还原，而不可氧化性催化剂如CeO2不参与此过程。
2. 过渡金属簇在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中对CO2的激活表现出高效率，这是由于它们与CO2分子的强相互作用。这种有效性也受到CO2解离机制和能量壁垒的影响。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is crucial for producing propylene. Redox-active metal oxides like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2 are commonly utilized as catalysts for this process. Transition metal clusters are also promising due to their high surface area and reactivity. For redox-active catalysts, CO2 is activated via a redox reaction, resulting in the formation of CO. Redox-inactive metal oxides function as traditional oxidants. Different catalysts exhibit varying energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, impacting their efficiency in ODH.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）对于丙烯的生产至关重要。红氧化合物如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2广泛用作ODH的催化剂。过渡金属簇也表现出前景，由于它们的高比表面积和反应性。对于活性金属氧化物，CO2通过一个氧化还原反应被激活，导致形成CO。无氧化还原活性的金属氧化物作为传统氧化剂发挥作用。不同的催化剂具有不同的CO2解离能垒，影响其在ODH中的效率。
