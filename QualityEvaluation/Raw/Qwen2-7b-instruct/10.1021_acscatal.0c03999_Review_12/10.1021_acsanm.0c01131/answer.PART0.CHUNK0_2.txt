1. The mechanism of C-H bond activation in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes varies notably between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 enable CO2 reduction through electron transfer, whereas redox-inactive catalysts such as CeO2 do not engage in this process.
2. Transition metal clusters demonstrate high efficiency in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane because of their strong interaction with CO2 molecules. This effectiveness is also shaped by the mechanisms and energy barriers involved in CO2 dissociation.

1. 烷烃氧化脱氢中C-H键活化机制在可氧化性金属氧化物和不可氧化性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异。可氧化性催化剂如V2O5和VOx/SiO2通过电子传递促进CO2还原，而不可氧化性催化剂如CeO2不参与此过程。
2. 过渡金属簇在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中对CO2的激活表现出高效率，这是由于它们与CO2分子的强相互作用。这种有效性也受到CO2解离机制和能量壁垒的影响。
