The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is crucial for producing propylene. Redox-active metal oxides like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2 are commonly utilized as catalysts for this process. Transition metal clusters are also promising due to their high surface area and reactivity. For redox-active catalysts, CO2 is activated via a redox reaction, resulting in the formation of CO. Redox-inactive metal oxides function as traditional oxidants. Different catalysts exhibit varying energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, impacting their efficiency in ODH.
