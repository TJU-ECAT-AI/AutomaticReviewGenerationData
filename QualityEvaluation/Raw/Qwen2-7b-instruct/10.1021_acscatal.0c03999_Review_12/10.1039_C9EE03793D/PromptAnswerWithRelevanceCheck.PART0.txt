The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, play a crucial role in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. These catalysts undergo reversible oxidation-reduction reactions during the process, allowing them to regenerate and maintain their activity. Traditional oxidants, like oxygen, are used to activate the C-H bonds in propane, leading to the formation of alkenes. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts might rely more on external oxidants or different activation pathways. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 depends on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. For instance, V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters are known for their ability to lower the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, facilitating its conversion into useful products through oxidative dehydrogenation. The choice of catalysts can significantly impact the efficiency and selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation process, offering a pathway to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions in chemical production.

C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制在烷烃氧化脱氢中因活性氧还原催化体和非活性氧还原催化体而有所不同。活性氧还原催化体，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇，对激活CO2并实现丙烷氧化脱氢起着关键作用。这些催化剂在过程中经历可逆的氧化-还原反应，允许它们再生并保持其活性。传统氧化剂，如氧气，用于活化丙烷中的C-H键，导致形成烯烃。相比之下，非活性氧还原催化体可能更多依赖外部氧化剂或不同的激活路径。这些催化体在激活CO2的有效性取决于CO2分解的能量壁垒及其提出的机制。例如，V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇因其降低CO2分解能量壁垒的能力而闻名，从而通过氧化脱氢途径将其转化为有用的产品。选择催化剂可以显著影响氧化脱氢过程的效率和选择性，提供减少能源消耗和二氧化碳排放的途径，在化学生产中。

尽管基于化学循环的化学生产方法显示出有前景的结果，但这个概念可以进一步扩展到使用各种原料和能源来源的更广泛的系列产品。这为利用化学循环超越燃烧（CLBC）设计原则和氧化还原催化剂选择/优化策略提供了有用的信息，对于化学循环、催化、颗粒技术以及过程强化领域的研究人员来说，这些信息具有重要意义。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, can activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane due to their ability to undergo reversible oxidation-reduction reactions. These catalysts can facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds in propane and the formation of alkene products. On the other hand, redox-inactive catalysts, like transition metal clusters, might require the presence of traditional oxidants to effectively break the C-H bonds. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation depends on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, which are influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and the specific properties of the catalyst. Different catalysts exhibit varying efficiency in activating CO2, as demonstrated in the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. For instance, V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 show high activity due to their strong acidic sites, whereas CeO2 benefits from its ability to promote oxygen transfer during the reaction.
