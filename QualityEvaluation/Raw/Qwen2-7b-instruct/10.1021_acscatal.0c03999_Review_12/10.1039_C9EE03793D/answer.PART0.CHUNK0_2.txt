The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, can activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane due to their ability to undergo reversible oxidation-reduction reactions. These catalysts can facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds in propane and the formation of alkene products. On the other hand, redox-inactive catalysts, like transition metal clusters, might require the presence of traditional oxidants to effectively break the C-H bonds. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation depends on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, which are influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and the specific properties of the catalyst. Different catalysts exhibit varying efficiency in activating CO2, as demonstrated in the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. For instance, V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 show high activity due to their strong acidic sites, whereas CeO2 benefits from its ability to promote oxygen transfer during the reaction.

C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制在烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中在可逆氧化还原反应活性催化剂（如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2）与非活性氧化还原催化剂（如过渡金属簇）之间存在差异。活性催化剂能够激活CO2并促进丙烷的氧化脱氢，从而形成烯烃产物。相比之下，非活性催化剂可能需要传统氧化剂的存在来有效地打破C-H键。这些催化剂在激活CO2以进行氧化脱氢时的效率取决于CO2分解机制和能量壁垒，这受到温度、压力和催化剂特性的因素影响。不同的催化剂在激活CO2方面的效率不同，在丙烷氧化脱氢的背景下，V2O5和VOx/SiO2由于其强烈的酸性位点而表现出高活性，而CeO2则受益于其在反应期间促进氧转移的能力。
