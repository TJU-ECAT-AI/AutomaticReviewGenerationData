Chemical looping offers significant opportunities for process intensification and exergy loss minimization in chemical production compared to state-of-the-art technologies. It allows for an order of magnitude reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions without the requirement for carbon dioxide capture. By utilizing a redox catalyst, chemical looping can reduce the number of unit operations and decrease exergy loss, making certain chemical conversions feasible that would otherwise be unattainable with conventional methods.

化学循环在化学生产中提供显著的机会进行过程强化和熵损失最小化，与最先进的技术相比。它允许能源消耗和二氧化碳排放量减少一个数量级，无需进行碳捕获。通过使用氧化还原催化剂，化学循环可以减少单元操作的数量并降低熵损失，使某些化学转化成为可能，这些转化在常规反应方案中无法实现。
