[1] "It has been shown that GazOs has an intrinsic catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation [8,9]."
[2] "Thus, one could conclude that the higher dehydrogenation activity of Ga,Os supported on HZSM-5 over the GazOs- NaZSM-5 catalyst was due to a better dispersion of the gallium oxide phase."
[3] "However, it is difficult to explain how the support acidity could increase the surface area of the supported oxide phase by two orders of magnitude."
[4] "Furthermore, it appears rather improbable that back-exchange of Ga,O,- HZSM-5 with NaCl (sample B) will drastically reduce the surface area of the supported GazOs."
[5] "Consequently, the enhanced dehydrogenating activity of the Ga,Os-HZSM-5 in comparison of the GazOs-NaZSM-5 catalyst was not expected on the basis of GazO, dispersion, but rather on the basis of a bifunctional reaction where both GazO, and H+ intervene."
[6] "On HZSM-5 the formation of propene from propane has been interpreted as follows:"
[7] "C,Hs + H+ - CsH,+ + H,(1)"
[8] "C3H,+ -
CsH, + H+ (2)"
[9] "C,Hs is heterolytically dissociatively adsorbed, thus forming gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species."
[10] "These alkoxides would decompose further to form dehydrogenation products and H+ bound to surface oxygen."
[11] "Prop- ylene thus resulted from the rapidly established equilibrium:"
[12] "C3H,+Z -
CsH, + H+Z (7)"
[13] "The above mechanism would account for the enhanced dehydro- genating activity of Ga@-HZSM-5 in comparison to HZSM-5 and Ga- NaZSM-5 catalysts, and indeed is compatible with all the experimental findings;"

The literature describes a bifunctional mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over Ga203-HZSM-5 catalysts, involving both gallium oxide (Ga203) and proton acidity. The key points are:

1. Gallium oxide has intrinsic catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation.
2. Ga203 supported on HZSM-5 shows higher dehydrogenation activity compared to Ga203-NaZSM-5, likely due to better dispersion of the gallium oxide phase.
3. The enhancement in dehydrogenation activity is attributed to a bifunctional reaction where both Ga203 and protons intervene.
4. The formation of propene from propane involves a series of steps: heterolytic adsorption of propane, decomposition of gallium alkoxides, and rapid exchange with a zeolite proton to form the propyl carbenium ion.

Regarding the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, the document does not directly compare these mechanisms or discuss the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2. However, it provides insights into the role of protons and gallium oxide in the dehydrogenation process.

Answer: The mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over Ga203-HZSM-5 catalysts involves gallium oxide and proton acidity. A bifunctional mechanism explains the enhanced activity compared to other catalysts. The process includes heterolytic adsorption, decomposition of gallium alkoxides, and rapid exchange with a zeolite proton to form propene.

文献描述了Ga203-HZSM-5催化剂上丙烷脱氢的双功能机制，涉及镓氧化物（Ga203）和质子酸性。关键点如下：

1. 镓氧化物具有内在的丙烷脱氢活性。
2. 相对于Ga203-NaZSM-5，Ga203支持在HZSM-5上的脱氢活性更高，可能由于镓氧化物相的更好分散。
3. 脱氢活性的增强归因于镓氧化物和质子同时介入的双功能反应。
4. 从丙烷到丙烯的形成涉及一系列步骤：丙烷的异裂吸附、镓醇的分解以及与沸石质子的快速交换以形成丙基碳正离子。

关于红氧化合物和非红氧化合物金属氧化物催化剂在CO2活化方面的比较机制或不同催化剂激活CO2在烷烃氧化脱氢过程中的有效性，文献并未直接进行比较。然而，它提供了关于脱氢过程中的作用的见解。

答案：镓203-HZSM-5催化剂上的丙烷脱氢机制涉及镓氧化物和质子酸性。双功能机制解释了与其他催化剂相比的增强活性。该过程包括异裂吸附、镓醇的分解以及与沸石质子的快速交换以形成丙烯。
