[1] "It has been shown that GazOs has an intrinsic catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation [8,9]."
[2] "Thus, one could conclude that the higher dehydrogenation activity of Ga,Os supported on HZSM-5 over the GazOs- NaZSM-5 catalyst was due to a better dispersion of the gallium oxide phase."
[3] "On HZSM-5 the formation of propene from propane has been interpreted as follows:"
[4] "C,Hs + H+ - CsH,+ + H,(1)"
[5] "C3H,+ -
CsH, + H+ (2)"
[6] "When both Ga,O, and H+ are present within the catalyst, one can assume that the propyl carbenium species formed by reaction (3) over gallium oxide will readily exchange with a zeolite proton through an alkyl surface migration reaction:"
[7] "H-

GaX+ -_d----Gax+ + HZ s G+r----Ga+X + CaH, + Z (6)"
[8] "Consequently, the conjugated effect of gallium oxide and proton is to bypass the slow step (4): GaOCsH, --+ GaOH + C&H,which is replaced by the fast equilibrium (6)."

The dehydrogenation of propane over GaOx-HZSM-5 zeolite occurs through a gallium alkoxide intermediate that rapidly exchanges with a zeolite proton to form the classical propyl carbenium ion. Propene is formed through the breakdown of this carbenium ion, releasing H+. The mechanism involves the activation of the C-H bond in propane through the formation of a gallium alkoxide intermediate on the surface of GaOx. This intermediate decomposes into propene and a gallium hydroxide species, bypassing the slow steps of the dehydrogenation process. The enhanced dehydrogenating activity of GaOx-HZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 and GaOx-NaZSM-5 catalysts is attributed to a better dispersion of the gallium oxide phase and a bifunctional reaction involving both GaOx and H+.

在GaOx-HZSM-5沸石上，丙烷脱氢通过形成镓醇中间体并迅速与沸石质子交换以形成经典的丙基碳正离子来发生。丙烯通过分解这种碳正离子产生，并释放出H+。机制涉及通过在GaOx表面形成镓醇中间体激活丙烷中的C-H键。该中间体分解成丙烯和镓氢氧化物物种，绕过了脱氢过程的缓慢步骤。GaOx-HZSM-5催化剂相对于HZSM-5和GaOx-NaZSM-5催化剂的增强脱氢活性归因于GaOx相的更好分散以及GaOx和H+参与的双功能反应。
