[1] "Over Ga,O,-HZSM-5 a dual site mechanism involving both Gaz03 and H+ is operative for propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "When both Ga,O, and H+ are present within the catalyst, one can assume that the propyl carbenium species formed by reaction (3) over gallium oxide will readily exchange with a zeolite proton through an alkyl surface migration reaction."
[3] "Propene is formed through the breakdown of this carbenium ion, releasing H+."
[4] "Three different mechanisms for the dehydrogenation of propane would operate:"
[5] "(i) Over HZSM-5, the formation of C3H,+ carbenium ions through hydride abstraction is the slow and limiting step."
[6] "(ii) Over Ga20s, C&l, is rapidly dissociatively adsorbed on the surface to produce a surface gallium alkoxide intermediate, GaOCsH,. The decom- position of this intermediate into C,H, and GaOH is the slow, limiting step."
[7] "(iii) Over Ga,O,-HZSM-5,surface alkyl migration and exchange between GaOC3H7 and HZ are rapidly established, thus bypassing the slow processes (i) and (ii)."

The dehydrogenation of propane over Ga203-HZSM-5 catalysts involves a dual-site mechanism, where both Ga203 and H+ play crucial roles. Ga203 facilitates the formation of a gallium alkoxide intermediate, which, upon surface migration, exchanges with a zeolite proton. This exchange generates a propyl carbenium ion, leading to the formation of propene by its decomposition, releasing H+. Three distinct mechanisms govern propane dehydrogenation: 
(i) Over HZSM-5, the slow step involves the formation of a carbenium ion through hydride abstraction. 
(ii) Over Ga203, propane is rapidly adsorbed as a surface alkoxide, with the decomposition of this intermediate being the slow step. 
(iii) Over Ga203-HZSM-5, surface alkyl migration and rapid proton exchange bypass the slow steps in (i) and (ii), enhancing the dehydrogenation efficiency.

在Ga203-HZSM-5催化剂上，丙烷脱氢涉及双站点机制，其中Ga203和H+起着关键作用。Ga203促进形成镓醇基中间体，该中间体通过表面迁移与沸石质子交换生成丙基碳正离子。这种交换产生丙烯，其分解释放出H+。有三种不同的机制控制丙烷脱氢：
(i) 在HZSM-5上，缓慢步骤涉及通过氢化物提取形成碳正离子。
(ii) 在Ga203上，丙烷迅速吸附为表面醇基，此中间体的分解是缓慢步骤。
(iii) 在Ga203-HZSM-5上，表面烷基迁移和快速质子交换跳过了(i)和(ii)中的缓慢步骤，从而提高了脱氢效率。

[1] "It has been shown that GazOs has an intrinsic catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation [8,9]."
[2] "Thus, one could conclude that the higher dehydrogenation activity of Ga,Os supported on HZSM-5 over the GazOs- NaZSM-5 catalyst was due to a better dispersion of the gallium oxide phase."
[3] "However, it is difficult to explain how the support acidity could increase the surface area of the supported oxide phase by two orders of magnitude."
[4] "Furthermore, it appears rather improbable that back-exchange of Ga,O,- HZSM-5 with NaCl (sample B) will drastically reduce the surface area of the supported GazOs."
[5] "Consequently, the enhanced dehydrogenating activity of the Ga,Os-HZSM-5 in comparison of the GazOs-NaZSM-5 catalyst was not expected on the basis of GazO, dispersion, but rather on the basis of a bifunctional reaction where both GazO, and H+ intervene."
[6] "On HZSM-5 the formation of propene from propane has been interpreted as follows:"
[7] "C,Hs + H+ - CsH,+ + H,(1)"
[8] "C3H,+ -
CsH, + H+ (2)"
[9] "C,Hs is heterolytically dissociatively adsorbed, thus forming gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species."

[13] "The above mechanism would account for the enhanced dehydro- genating activity of Ga@-HZSM-5 in comparison to HZSM-5 and Ga- NaZSM-5 catalysts, and indeed is compatible with all the experimental findings;"

The literature describes a bifunctional mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over Ga203-HZSM-5 catalysts, involving both gallium oxide (Ga203) and proton acidity. The key points are:

1. Gallium oxide has intrinsic catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation.
2. Ga203 supported on HZSM-5 shows higher dehydrogenation activity compared to Ga203-NaZSM-5, likely due to better dispersion of the gallium oxide phase.
3. The enhancement in dehydrogenation activity is attributed to a bifunctional reaction where both Ga203 and protons intervene.
4. The formation of propene from propane involves a series of steps: heterolytic adsorption of propane, decomposition of gallium alkoxides, and rapid exchange with a zeolite proton to form the propyl carbenium ion.

Regarding the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, the document does not directly compare these mechanisms or discuss the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2. However, it provides insights into the role of protons and gallium oxide in the dehydrogenation process.

Answer: The mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over Ga203-HZSM-5 catalysts involves gallium oxide and proton acidity. A bifunctional mechanism explains the enhanced activity compared to other catalysts. The process includes heterolytic adsorption, decomposition of gallium alkoxides, and rapid exchange with a zeolite proton to form propene.

文献描述了Ga203-HZSM-5催化剂上丙烷脱氢的双功能机制，涉及镓氧化物（Ga203）和质子酸性。关键点如下：

1. 镓氧化物具有内在的丙烷脱氢活性。
2. 相对于Ga203-NaZSM-5，Ga203支持在HZSM-5上的脱氢活性更高，可能由于镓氧化物相的更好分散。
3. 脱氢活性的增强归因于镓氧化物和质子同时介入的双功能反应。
4. 从丙烷到丙烯的形成涉及一系列步骤：丙烷的异裂吸附、镓醇的分解以及与沸石质子的快速交换以形成丙基碳正离子。

关于红氧化合物和非红氧化合物金属氧化物催化剂在CO2活化方面的比较机制或不同催化剂激活CO2在烷烃氧化脱氢过程中的有效性，文献并未直接进行比较。然而，它提供了关于脱氢过程中的作用的见解。

答案：镓203-HZSM-5催化剂上的丙烷脱氢机制涉及镓氧化物和质子酸性。双功能机制解释了与其他催化剂相比的增强活性。该过程包括异裂吸附、镓醇的分解以及与沸石质子的快速交换以形成丙烯。

The literature outlines a bifunctional mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over Ga203-HZSM-5 catalysts. The process involves the formation of a gallium alkoxide intermediate on the surface of the catalyst, which rapidly exchanges with a zeolite proton to form the propyl carbenium ion. This ion then decomposes to release H+ and form propylene. This mechanism accounts for the enhanced dehydrogenating activity of Ga203 supported on HZSM-5 compared to other catalysts, as the acidity of the zeolite increases the surface area of the supported oxide phase and facilitates the rapid exchange between the alkoxide and proton, bypassing slower steps in the reaction pathway.

The document describes a bifunctional mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over gallium oxide (Ga203)-HZSM-5 catalysts. This mechanism involves both gallium oxide (Ga203) and proton acidity. At high acidity, the dehydrogenation of propane is more efficient due to the enhanced activity of gallium oxide. However, when the acidity is decreased, the dehydrogenation rate significantly decreases. The process involves the formation of gallium alkoxide intermediates, which exchange with zeolite protons to form propyl carbenium ions, leading to propene production. This mechanism accounts for the enhanced dehydrogenating activity of Ga203-HZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 and Ga-NaZSM-5 catalysts.

The dehydrogenation of propane over GaOx-HZSM-5 zeolite occurs through a gallium alkoxide intermediate that rapidly exchanges with a zeolite proton to form the classical propyl carbenium ion. Propene is formed through the breakdown of this carbenium ion, releasing H+. The mechanism involves the activation of the C-H bond in propane through the formation of a gallium alkoxide intermediate on the surface of GaOx. This intermediate decomposes into propene and a gallium hydroxide species, bypassing the slow steps of the dehydrogenation process. The enhanced dehydrogenating activity of GaOx-HZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 and GaOx-NaZSM-5 catalysts is attributed to a better dispersion of the gallium oxide phase and a bifunctional reaction involving both GaOx and H+.

在GaOx-HZSM-5沸石上，丙烷脱氢通过形成镓醇中间体并迅速与沸石质子交换以形成经典的丙基碳正离子来发生。丙烯通过分解这种碳正离子产生，并释放出H+。机制涉及通过在GaOx表面形成镓醇中间体激活丙烷中的C-H键。该中间体分解成丙烯和镓氢氧化物物种，绕过了脱氢过程的缓慢步骤。GaOx-HZSM-5催化剂相对于HZSM-5和GaOx-NaZSM-5催化剂的增强脱氢活性归因于GaOx相的更好分散以及GaOx和H+参与的双功能反应。
