[1] "It has been shown that GazOs has an intrinsic catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation [8,9]."
[2] "Thus, one could conclude that the higher dehydrogenation activity of Ga,Os supported on HZSM-5 over the GazOs- NaZSM-5 catalyst was due to a better dispersion of the gallium oxide phase."
[3] "Conversely by changing the Ga,Os-H form (sample B) into the non-acidic Ga,O,- Na form (sample B), a loo-fold decrease in the dehydrogenation rate of propane is observed."
[4] "When both Ga,O, and H+ are present within the catalyst, one can assume that the propyl carbenium species formed by reaction (3) over gallium oxide will readily exchange with a zeolite proton through an alkyl surface migration reaction:"
[5] "Prop- ylene thus resulted from the rapidly established equilibrium:"

The document describes a bifunctional mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over gallium oxide (Ga203)-HZSM-5 catalysts. This mechanism involves both gallium oxide (Ga203) and proton acidity. At high acidity, the dehydrogenation of propane is more efficient due to the enhanced activity of gallium oxide. However, when the acidity is decreased, the dehydrogenation rate significantly decreases. The process involves the formation of gallium alkoxide intermediates, which exchange with zeolite protons to form propyl carbenium ions, leading to propene production. This mechanism accounts for the enhanced dehydrogenating activity of Ga203-HZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 and Ga-NaZSM-5 catalysts.

文档描述了镓氧化物（Ga203）-HZSM-5催化剂上的丙烷脱氢的双功能机制。该机制涉及镓氧化物（Ga203）和酸性。在高酸度下，由于镓氧化物的活性增强，丙烷脱氢更有效。然而，当酸度降低时，脱氢速率显著降低。此过程涉及形成镓醇基中间体，这些中间体通过表面迁移反应与沸石质子交换，形成丙基碳正离子，进而产生丙烯。这一机制解释了Ga203-HZSM-5催化剂相比HZSM-5和Ga-NaZSM-5催化剂的增强脱氢活性。
