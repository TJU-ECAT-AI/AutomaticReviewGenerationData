[7] "When both Ga,O, and H+ are present within the catalyst, one can assume that the propyl carbenium species formed by reaction (3) over gallium oxide will readily exchange with a zeolite proton through an alkyl surface migration reaction:"
[8] "This is a reasonable assumption in view of the high mobility of protons in zeolites, and the high instability of gallium alkyl compounds [ 121."

The literature outlines a bifunctional mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over Ga203-HZSM-5 catalysts. The process involves the formation of a gallium alkoxide intermediate on the surface of the catalyst, which rapidly exchanges with a zeolite proton to form the propyl carbenium ion. This ion then decomposes to release H+ and form propylene. This mechanism accounts for the enhanced dehydrogenating activity of Ga203 supported on HZSM-5 compared to other catalysts, as the acidity of the zeolite increases the surface area of the supported oxide phase and facilitates the rapid exchange between the alkoxide and proton, bypassing slower steps in the reaction pathway.

文献描述了Ga203-HZSM-5催化剂上丙烷脱氢的双功能机制。该过程涉及在催化剂表面形成镓醇中间体，随后迅速与沸石质子交换以形成丙基碳鎓离子。该离子随后分解释放H+并形成丙烯。这一机制解释了与纯Ga203相比，在酸性沸石上的支持氧化物相的表面积增加，并促进了快速交换之间醇氧和质子之间的交换，从而跳过了反应路径中的较慢步骤，这解释了Ga203支持在HZSM-5中相对于其他催化剂增强的脱氢活性。
