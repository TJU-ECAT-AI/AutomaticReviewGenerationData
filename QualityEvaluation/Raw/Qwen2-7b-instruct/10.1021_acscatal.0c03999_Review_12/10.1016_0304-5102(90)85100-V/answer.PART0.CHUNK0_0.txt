[1] "Over Ga,O,-HZSM-5 a dual site mechanism involving both Gaz03 and H+ is operative for propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "When both Ga,O, and H+ are present within the catalyst, one can assume that the propyl carbenium species formed by reaction (3) over gallium oxide will readily exchange with a zeolite proton through an alkyl surface migration reaction."
[3] "Propene is formed through the breakdown of this carbenium ion, releasing H+."
[4] "Three different mechanisms for the dehydrogenation of propane would operate:"
[5] "(i) Over HZSM-5, the formation of C3H,+ carbenium ions through hydride abstraction is the slow and limiting step."
[6] "(ii) Over Ga20s, C&l, is rapidly dissociatively adsorbed on the surface to produce a surface gallium alkoxide intermediate, GaOCsH,. The decom- position of this intermediate into C,H, and GaOH is the slow, limiting step."
[7] "(iii) Over Ga,O,-HZSM-5,surface alkyl migration and exchange between GaOC3H7 and HZ are rapidly established, thus bypassing the slow processes (i) and (ii)."

The dehydrogenation of propane over Ga203-HZSM-5 catalysts involves a dual-site mechanism, where both Ga203 and H+ play crucial roles. Ga203 facilitates the formation of a gallium alkoxide intermediate, which, upon surface migration, exchanges with a zeolite proton. This exchange generates a propyl carbenium ion, leading to the formation of propene by its decomposition, releasing H+. Three distinct mechanisms govern propane dehydrogenation: 
(i) Over HZSM-5, the slow step involves the formation of a carbenium ion through hydride abstraction. 
(ii) Over Ga203, propane is rapidly adsorbed as a surface alkoxide, with the decomposition of this intermediate being the slow step. 
(iii) Over Ga203-HZSM-5, surface alkyl migration and rapid proton exchange bypass the slow steps in (i) and (ii), enhancing the dehydrogenation efficiency.

在Ga203-HZSM-5催化剂上，丙烷脱氢涉及双站点机制，其中Ga203和H+起着关键作用。Ga203促进形成镓醇基中间体，该中间体通过表面迁移与沸石质子交换生成丙基碳正离子。这种交换产生丙烯，其分解释放出H+。有三种不同的机制控制丙烷脱氢：
(i) 在HZSM-5上，缓慢步骤涉及通过氢化物提取形成碳正离子。
(ii) 在Ga203上，丙烷迅速吸附为表面醇基，此中间体的分解是缓慢步骤。
(iii) 在Ga203-HZSM-5上，表面烷基迁移和快速质子交换跳过了(i)和(ii)中的缓慢步骤，从而提高了脱氢效率。
