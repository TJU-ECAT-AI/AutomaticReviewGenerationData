The adsorption of CO2 on BaZrO3 (0 0 1) with a focus on the BaO termination leads to strong chemisorption of carbonate species, with an adsorption enthalpy reaching up to 2.25 eV at low coverage. This high energy leads to significant coverage of over 0.8 at 1000 K, relevant for steam reforming conditions. The presence of a carbonate overlayer hinders surface reactions, such as proton incorporation, because protons are less stable associated with carbonate oxide ions compared to the surface. The bulk dissolution of carbonate species is found to be negligible in acceptor-doped BaZrO3. Surface carbonate species play a crucial role in the adsorption of CO2, influencing the formation of BaCO3.

BaZrO3（0 0 1）表面上BaO终止的CO2吸附通过形成表面碳酸盐物种显示出显著的放热吸附焓，低覆盖度下可达2.25 eV。这种高能导致1000 K时超过0.8的显著覆盖，适用于蒸汽重整条件。碳酸盐过层的存在对表面反应有负面影响，因为与碳酸盐氧离子相比，表面的质子稳定性较低。在掺杂BaZrO3中，碳酸盐基体溶解的可能性微乎其微。表面碳酸盐物种在CO2吸附中起关键作用，影响BaCO3的形成。
