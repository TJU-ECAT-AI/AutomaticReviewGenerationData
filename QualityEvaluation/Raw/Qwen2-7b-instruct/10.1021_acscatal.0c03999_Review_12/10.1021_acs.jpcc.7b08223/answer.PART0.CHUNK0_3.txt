[1] "The adsorption of CO2 and CO on BaZrO3 (0 0 1) was investigated by first-principles calculations with a focus on the BaO termination."
[2] "CO2 was found to strongly chemisorb on the surface by formation of carbonate species with an adsorption enthalpy of up to 2.25 eV at low coverage and 1.05 eV for a full monolayer."
[3] "Surface coverages were evaluated as a function of temperature and CO2 partial pressure, and the obtained coverage under 1 bar CO2 was more than 0.8 at 1000 K (conditions relevant for steam methane reforming)."
[4] "The initial stage of BaCO3 formation was evaluated according to migration of barium to the carbonate overlayer, which was found to result in a significant stabilization of the system."
[5] "The barium migration was found to be essentially unobstructed with a barrier of only 5 meV."
[6] "The prospect of bulk dissolution of carbonate species was evaluated but ultimately found to be negligible in acceptor-doped BaZrO3."

The study focused on the adsorption of CO2 and CO on BaZrO3 (0 0 1) surfaces, specifically examining the BaO termination. The research revealed that CO2 chemisorbs onto the surface by forming carbonate species, exhibiting adsorption enthalpies of up to 2.25 eV at low coverage and 1.05 eV for a full monolayer. The adsorption energy increases linearly with coverage, reaching 1.05 eV for complete saturation. The surface is found to be highly reactive towards CO2, with a coverage exceeding 0.8 at 1000 K under 1 bar CO2 pressure, conditions relevant for steam methane reforming. The initial stage of BaCO3 formation was studied, indicating that barium migration to the carbonate overlayer leads to significant stabilization of the system. This migration occurs with minimal energy barrier, suggesting a straightforward process. Furthermore, the study found that the bulk dissolution of carbonate species is unlikely in acceptor-doped BaZrO3.

研究主要关注了BaZrO3（0 0 1）表面CO2和CO的吸附，特别是BaO端基。研究发现，CO2通过形成碳酸盐物种在表面化学吸附，吸附焓在低覆盖度时高达2.25 eV，在完全单层时为1.05 eV。吸附能随着覆盖度的增加而线性增加，达到完全饱和时为1.05 eV。表面对CO2表现出高度反应性，在1000 K时在1 bar CO2压力下超过0.8的覆盖率，这是蒸汽甲烷重整的相关条件。BaCO3形成初期阶段被研究，表明钡向碳酸盐层迁移导致系统显著稳定化。这种迁移具有极低的能量壁垒，暗示了一个简单的过程。此外，研究发现，在掺杂BaZrO3中，碳酸盐物种的大规模溶解是不太可能的。
