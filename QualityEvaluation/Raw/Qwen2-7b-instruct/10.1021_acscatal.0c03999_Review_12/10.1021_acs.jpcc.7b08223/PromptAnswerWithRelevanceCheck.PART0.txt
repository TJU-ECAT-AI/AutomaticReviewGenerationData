Adsorption of CO2 on BaZrO3 (0 0 1) surface occurs via formation of carbonate species, with an adsorption enthalpy reaching up to 2.25 eV at low coverage and decreasing to 1.05 eV at full coverage. The adsorption entropy is 8.8 × 10^4 eV K^-1. At 1 bar CO2 pressure and 1000 K, a coverage of more than 0.8 is achieved. The fully saturated surface remains stable up to about 400 K under ambient conditions. BaCO3 formation begins with barium migrating to the outer surface of the carbonate layer, which significantly stabilizes the system. The barrier for this migration is only 5 meV. The bulk dissolution of carbonate species is negligible in acceptor-doped BaZrO3.

BaZrO3（0 0 1）表面上的CO2吸附通过形成碳酸盐物种发生，低覆盖度时吸附焓高达2.25 eV，全层覆盖时降低至1.05 eV。吸附熵为8.8 × 10^4 eV K^-1。在1巴CO2压力和1000 K下，可以达到超过0.8的覆盖率。在常温条件下，完全饱和的表面可稳定至约400 K。BaCO3的形成始于钡离子迁移到碳酸盐层的外表面，显著稳定了系统。该迁移的势垒仅为5 meV。在掺杂的BaZrO3中，碳酸盐物种的批量溶解是微不足道的。

The adsorption of CO2 on BaZrO3 (0 0 1) with a focus on the BaO termination leads to strong chemisorption of carbonate species, with an adsorption enthalpy reaching up to 2.25 eV at low coverage. This high energy leads to significant coverage of over 0.8 at 1000 K, relevant for steam reforming conditions. The presence of a carbonate overlayer hinders surface reactions, such as proton incorporation, because protons are less stable associated with carbonate oxide ions compared to the surface. The bulk dissolution of carbonate species is found to be negligible in acceptor-doped BaZrO3. Surface carbonate species play a crucial role in the adsorption of CO2, influencing the formation of BaCO3.

BaZrO3（0 0 1）表面上BaO终止的CO2吸附通过形成表面碳酸盐物种显示出显著的放热吸附焓，低覆盖度下可达2.25 eV。这种高能导致1000 K时超过0.8的显著覆盖，适用于蒸汽重整条件。碳酸盐过层的存在对表面反应有负面影响，因为与碳酸盐氧离子相比，表面的质子稳定性较低。在掺杂BaZrO3中，碳酸盐基体溶解的可能性微乎其微。表面碳酸盐物种在CO2吸附中起关键作用，影响BaCO3的形成。

[1] "The obtained thermodynamics of carbonate adsorption implies that the surface will be fully covered by a carbonate overlayer under ambient conditions containing 400 ppm of CO2 and that significant coverage may be retained up to 2000 K under 1 bar CO2."
[2] "Considering the favorable adsorption energetics and geometry of surface carbonate species, BaCO3 formation was evaluated."
[3] "The initial stage of BaCO3 formation was investigated for the BaO-terminated surface with the full carbonate overlayer, i.e., ΘCO2 = 1 (Figure 3b), which is predicted to be stable up to about 600 K in 1 bar CO2 and 400 K in 400 ppm of CO2 (Figure 4)."
[4] "BaCO3 formation was considered to be initiated by outward relaxation/migration of barium to the outer surface of the carbonate overlayer, thereby leaving a barium vacancy in the terminating BaO-layer."
[5] "Furthermore, the calculated minimum energy path for barium migration reveals an essentially unobstructed migration process (within 5 meV for the first 0.4 Å, Figure 6b)."
[6] "The possibility of carbon dissolution into the bulk perovskite structure was evaluated and a relatively stable configuration was identified in which interstitial carbon bonds to three lattice oxide ions to form carbonate species with CO bond lengths of 1.30 Å."

The adsorption of CO2 on BaZrO3 surfaces leads to the formation of surface carbonate species, which can fully cover the surface under ambient conditions containing 400 ppm of CO2. This is due to the strong affinity of CO2 for the BaO-terminated surface. The surface coverage of carbonate adsorbates is highly dependent on temperature and CO2 partial pressure. At 1000 K, the surface coverage exceeds 0.8 under 1 bar CO2. The formation of BaCO3 is initiated by the outward migration of barium from the terminating BaO-layer to the outer surface of the carbonate overlayer, resulting in a stabilization of the system. This process is energetically favorable with a low activation barrier. Carbon can dissolve into the bulk perovskite structure and form carbonate species, but this is considered negligible in acceptor-doped BaZrO3.

在400ppm二氧化碳的常压条件下，BaZrO3表面的二氧化碳吸附会导致表面碳酸盐物种的形成，可以完全覆盖表面。这是由于BaO端基表面对二氧化碳的强大亲和力。二氧化碳吸附剂的表面覆盖率依赖于温度和二氧化碳分压。在1000K下，在1巴的二氧化碳下，表面覆盖度超过0.8。BaCO3的形成始于钡从终止的BaO层向外迁移到碳酸盐外层表面，导致系统的稳定化。这一过程是能量上有利的，具有较低的活化能。碳可以溶解到基体中形成碳酸盐物种，但在掺杂的BaZrO3中认为这是微不足道的。

The study focused on the adsorption of CO2 and CO on BaZrO3 (0 0 1) surfaces, specifically examining the BaO termination. The research revealed that CO2 chemisorbs onto the surface by forming carbonate species, exhibiting adsorption enthalpies of up to 2.25 eV at low coverage and 1.05 eV for a full monolayer. The adsorption energy increases linearly with coverage, reaching 1.05 eV for complete saturation. The surface is found to be highly reactive towards CO2, with a coverage exceeding 0.8 at 1000 K under 1 bar CO2 pressure, conditions relevant for steam methane reforming. The initial stage of BaCO3 formation was studied, indicating that barium migration to the carbonate overlayer leads to significant stabilization of the system. This migration occurs with minimal energy barrier, suggesting a straightforward process. Furthermore, the study found that the bulk dissolution of carbonate species is unlikely in acceptor-doped BaZrO3.

研究主要关注了BaZrO3（0 0 1）表面CO2和CO的吸附，特别是BaO端基。研究发现，CO2通过形成碳酸盐物种在表面化学吸附，吸附焓在低覆盖度时高达2.25 eV，在完全单层时为1.05 eV。吸附能随着覆盖度的增加而线性增加，达到完全饱和时为1.05 eV。表面对CO2表现出高度反应性，在1000 K时在1 bar CO2压力下超过0.8的覆盖率，这是蒸汽甲烷重整的相关条件。BaCO3形成初期阶段被研究，表明钡向碳酸盐层迁移导致系统显著稳定化。这种迁移具有极低的能量壁垒，暗示了一个简单的过程。此外，研究发现，在掺杂BaZrO3中，碳酸盐物种的大规模溶解是不太可能的。

The literature discusses the adsorption of CO2 on BaZrO3 surfaces, with a focus on the BaO termination. The adsorption process forms carbonate species, indicating a strong affinity for CO2. The adsorption energetics and geometry favor surface carbonate species, which can lead to the formation of a fully saturated surface with a carbonate overlayer under ambient conditions. The vibrational entropy and the zero-point energy contribute to the adsorption enthalpy. The literature also evaluates the initial stage of BaCO3 formation, which is initiated by outward relaxation/migration of barium to the outer surface of the carbonate overlayer. This process results in a significant stabilization of the system. The potential for bulk solubility of interstitial carbon in the form of carbonate species is considered but found to be negligible in acceptor-doped BaZrO3.

文献讨论了BaZrO3表面的CO2吸附，重点是BaO终止。吸附过程形成碳酸盐物种，表明CO2有很强的亲和力。吸附热力学和几何形状有利于表面碳酸盐物种，这可能导致在大气条件下含有400 ppm CO2的表面上完全饱和并覆盖一层碳酸盐层。振动熵和零点能量对吸附焓有所贡献。文献还评估了BaCO3形成的初期阶段，这始于钡从终止BaO表面向外迁移到外层碳酸盐层。这一过程导致系统显著稳定化。间位碳在BaZrO3中的潜在溶解性形成碳酸盐物种被考虑，但在掺杂BaZrO3中发现是微不足道的。
