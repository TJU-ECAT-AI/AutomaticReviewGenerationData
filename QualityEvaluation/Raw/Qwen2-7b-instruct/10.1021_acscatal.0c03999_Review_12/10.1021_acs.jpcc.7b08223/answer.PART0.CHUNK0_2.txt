[1] "The obtained thermodynamics of carbonate adsorption implies that the surface will be fully covered by a carbonate overlayer under ambient conditions containing 400 ppm of CO2 and that significant coverage may be retained up to 2000 K under 1 bar CO2."
[2] "Considering the favorable adsorption energetics and geometry of surface carbonate species, BaCO3 formation was evaluated."
[3] "The initial stage of BaCO3 formation was investigated for the BaO-terminated surface with the full carbonate overlayer, i.e., ΘCO2 = 1 (Figure 3b), which is predicted to be stable up to about 600 K in 1 bar CO2 and 400 K in 400 ppm of CO2 (Figure 4)."
[4] "BaCO3 formation was considered to be initiated by outward relaxation/migration of barium to the outer surface of the carbonate overlayer, thereby leaving a barium vacancy in the terminating BaO-layer."
[5] "Furthermore, the calculated minimum energy path for barium migration reveals an essentially unobstructed migration process (within 5 meV for the first 0.4 Å, Figure 6b)."
[6] "The possibility of carbon dissolution into the bulk perovskite structure was evaluated and a relatively stable configuration was identified in which interstitial carbon bonds to three lattice oxide ions to form carbonate species with CO bond lengths of 1.30 Å."

The adsorption of CO2 on BaZrO3 surfaces leads to the formation of surface carbonate species, which can fully cover the surface under ambient conditions containing 400 ppm of CO2. This is due to the strong affinity of CO2 for the BaO-terminated surface. The surface coverage of carbonate adsorbates is highly dependent on temperature and CO2 partial pressure. At 1000 K, the surface coverage exceeds 0.8 under 1 bar CO2. The formation of BaCO3 is initiated by the outward migration of barium from the terminating BaO-layer to the outer surface of the carbonate overlayer, resulting in a stabilization of the system. This process is energetically favorable with a low activation barrier. Carbon can dissolve into the bulk perovskite structure and form carbonate species, but this is considered negligible in acceptor-doped BaZrO3.

在400ppm二氧化碳的常压条件下，BaZrO3表面的二氧化碳吸附会导致表面碳酸盐物种的形成，可以完全覆盖表面。这是由于BaO端基表面对二氧化碳的强大亲和力。二氧化碳吸附剂的表面覆盖率依赖于温度和二氧化碳分压。在1000K下，在1巴的二氧化碳下，表面覆盖度超过0.8。BaCO3的形成始于钡从终止的BaO层向外迁移到碳酸盐外层表面，导致系统的稳定化。这一过程是能量上有利的，具有较低的活化能。碳可以溶解到基体中形成碳酸盐物种，但在掺杂的BaZrO3中认为这是微不足道的。
