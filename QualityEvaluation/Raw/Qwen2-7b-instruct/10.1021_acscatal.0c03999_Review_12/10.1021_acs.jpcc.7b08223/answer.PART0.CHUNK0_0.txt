[1] "Adsorption of CO2 and CO on BaZrO3 (0 0 1) was investigated by first-principles calculations with a focus on the BaO termination."
[2] "CO2 was found to strongly chemisorb on the surface by formation of carbonate species with an adsorption enthalpy of up to 2.25 eV at low coverage and 1.05 eV for a full monolayer."
[3] "An adsorption entropy of 8.8 × 104 eV K−1 was obtained from the vibrational properties of the adsorbates."
[4] "Surface coverages were evaluated as a function of temperature and CO2 partial pressure, and the obtained coverage under 1 bar CO2 was more than 0.8 at 1000 K (conditions relevant for steam methane reforming)."
[5] "The fully saturated surface was stable up to about 400 K under ambient atmosphere, i.e., 400 ppm of CO2."
[6] "The initial stage of BaCO3 formation was evaluated according to migration of barium to the carbonate overlayer, which was found to result in a significant stabilization of the system."
[7] "The barium migration was found to be essentially unobstructed with a barrier of only 5 meV."
[8] "In light of the stability of carbonate adsorbates at the surface, the prospect of bulk dissolution of carbonate species was evaluated but ultimately found to be negligible in acceptor-doped BaZrO3."

Adsorption of CO2 on BaZrO3 (0 0 1) surface occurs via formation of carbonate species, with an adsorption enthalpy reaching up to 2.25 eV at low coverage and decreasing to 1.05 eV at full coverage. The adsorption entropy is 8.8 × 10^4 eV K^-1. At 1 bar CO2 pressure and 1000 K, a coverage of more than 0.8 is achieved. The fully saturated surface remains stable up to about 400 K under ambient conditions. BaCO3 formation begins with barium migrating to the outer surface of the carbonate layer, which significantly stabilizes the system. The barrier for this migration is only 5 meV. The bulk dissolution of carbonate species is negligible in acceptor-doped BaZrO3.

BaZrO3（0 0 1）表面上的CO2吸附通过形成碳酸盐物种发生，低覆盖度时吸附焓高达2.25 eV，全层覆盖时降低至1.05 eV。吸附熵为8.8 × 10^4 eV K^-1。在1巴CO2压力和1000 K下，可以达到超过0.8的覆盖率。在常温条件下，完全饱和的表面可稳定至约400 K。BaCO3的形成始于钡离子迁移到碳酸盐层的外表面，显著稳定了系统。该迁移的势垒仅为5 meV。在掺杂的BaZrO3中，碳酸盐物种的批量溶解是微不足道的。
