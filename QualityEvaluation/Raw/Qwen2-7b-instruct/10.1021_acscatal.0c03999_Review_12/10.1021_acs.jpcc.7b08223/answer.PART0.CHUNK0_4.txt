[1] "CO2 exhibits significantly exothermic adsorption enthalpies of up to 2.25 eV at low coverage by formation of surface carbonate species on BaO-terminated BaZrO3 (0 0 1)."
[2] "Due to the strong CO2 adsorption energy, the calculated absorption equilibrium resulted in a significant coverage of more than 0.8 at 1000 K."
[3] "Considering the favorable adsorption energetics and geometry of surface carbonate species, BaCO3 formation was evaluated."
[4] "The vibrational entropy of adsorption and the ZPE contribution to the enthalpy of adsorption was obtained from the vibrational frequencies of chemisorbed CO2 (Table 2), molecular CO2, and the BaZrO3 surface oxide ion based on eq 1."
[5] "The initial stage of BaCO3 formation was investigated for the BaO-terminated surface with the full carbonate overlayer, i.e., ΘCO2 = 1 (Figure 3b), which is predicted to be stable up to about 600 K in 1 bar CO2 and 400 K in 400 ppm of CO2 (Figure 4)."
[6] "The possibility of carbon dissolution into the bulk perovskite structure was evaluated and a relatively stable configuration was identified in which interstitial carbon bonds to three lattice oxide ions to form carbonate species with CO bond lengths of 1.30 Å."

The literature discusses the adsorption of CO2 on BaZrO3 surfaces, with a focus on the BaO termination. The adsorption process forms carbonate species, indicating a strong affinity for CO2. The adsorption energetics and geometry favor surface carbonate species, which can lead to the formation of a fully saturated surface with a carbonate overlayer under ambient conditions. The vibrational entropy and the zero-point energy contribute to the adsorption enthalpy. The literature also evaluates the initial stage of BaCO3 formation, which is initiated by outward relaxation/migration of barium to the outer surface of the carbonate overlayer. This process results in a significant stabilization of the system. The potential for bulk solubility of interstitial carbon in the form of carbonate species is considered but found to be negligible in acceptor-doped BaZrO3.

文献讨论了BaZrO3表面的CO2吸附，重点是BaO终止。吸附过程形成碳酸盐物种，表明CO2有很强的亲和力。吸附热力学和几何形状有利于表面碳酸盐物种，这可能导致在大气条件下含有400 ppm CO2的表面上完全饱和并覆盖一层碳酸盐层。振动熵和零点能量对吸附焓有所贡献。文献还评估了BaCO3形成的初期阶段，这始于钡从终止BaO表面向外迁移到外层碳酸盐层。这一过程导致系统显著稳定化。间位碳在BaZrO3中的潜在溶解性形成碳酸盐物种被考虑，但在掺杂BaZrO3中发现是微不足道的。
