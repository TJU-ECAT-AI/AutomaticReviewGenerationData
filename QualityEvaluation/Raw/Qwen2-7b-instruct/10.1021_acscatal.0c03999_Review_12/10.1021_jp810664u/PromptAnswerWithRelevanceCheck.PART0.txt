When comparing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes over redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, the use of different oxidants plays a crucial role. For redox-active catalysts like molybdenum supported on silica-titania (Mo/SiTi), the use of nitrogen dioxide (N2O) as an oxidant leads to a more reduced state of the catalyst compared to oxygen (O2). This results in higher selectivities for ethylene production and slower decreases in ethylene selectivity with increasing contact time. The mechanism involves a slower rate of re-oxidation using N2O, which is attributed to a higher activation energy of 98 kJ/mol compared to 41 kJ/mol when using O2. This difference in re-oxidation rates implies that N2O can oxidize the reduced state of the catalyst at a slower pace than O2, allowing for a more stable and less oxidized catalyst surface over longer contact times.

For redox-inactive catalysts, such as vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), vanadium oxide supported on silica (VOx/SiO2), ceria (CeO2), and transition metal clusters, the activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane requires more complex mechanisms. CO2 typically requires high-energy activation barriers for dissociation, especially in the gas phase. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 depends on their ability to lower these barriers through adsorption, interaction, and subsequent activation pathways. For instance, V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 might employ acid sites for CO2 activation, while ceria might utilize its high surface area and oxygen storage capacity to facilitate CO2 activation. Transition metal clusters might offer a combination of reactivity and selectivity due to their unique electronic configurations and surface chemistry. However, the exact mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary among these catalysts, making it difficult to generalize their effectiveness. Further research is needed to precisely understand and optimize these mechanisms for enhanced CO2 activation and propane oxidative dehydrogenation.

当比较具有还原活性和无还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂上的烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）时，不同氧化剂的使用起着关键作用。对于如钼支持在二氧化硅-钛酸盐（Mo/SiTi）这样的还原活性催化剂，使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂导致催化剂处于更还原状态，与使用氧气（O2）相比。这导致乙烯选择性更高，并且随着接触时间增加，乙烯选择性的降低速率较慢。这种机制涉及使用N2O时催化剂的氧化速度较慢，归因于氧化时的激活能为98 kJ/mol，而使用O2时为41 kJ/mol。这种差异表明，与使用O2相比，N2O可以以较慢的速度氧化还原状态的催化剂，从而保持更稳定的和还原程度较低的催化剂表面较长的接触时间。

对于如五氧化二钒（V2O5）、氧化钒支持在二氧化硅（VOx/SiO2）、铈酸盐（CeO2）和过渡金属簇这样的无还原活性催化剂，CO2的激活需要更复杂的机制。CO2通常需要高能量的激活壁垒才能解离，尤其是在气相中。这些催化剂在激活CO2的有效性取决于它们降低这些壁垒的能力，通过吸附、相互作用和随后的激活途径。例如，V2O5和VOx/SiO2可能利用酸性位点来激活CO2，而CeO2可能利用其高表面积和氧储存能力来促进CO2激活。过渡金属簇可能因其独特的电子配置和表面化学特性提供组合的反应性和选择性。然而，这些催化剂之间CO2解离机制的确切性质和优化程度各不相同，使得难以概括它们的效力。进一步的研究需要精确理解并优化这些机制以增强CO2激活和丙烷氧化脱氢。

The study investigates the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane using either oxygen (O2) or nitrous oxide (N2O) as oxidants. The focus is on a 10% molybdenum/silica-titania catalyst. N2O provides superior ethylene selectivities at a given ethane conversion compared to O2. The catalyst structure changes during the reaction, with molybdenum being fully oxidized to Mo(VI) when using O2 and having an average oxidation state of +5.8 when using N2O. The activation energy of re-oxidation when using N2O is 98 kJ/mol, compared to 41 kJ/mol when using O2, leading to a re-oxidation rate at least 1700 times faster with O2. This difference in re-oxidation rates accounts for the less oxidized state of molybdenum during ethane ODH with N2O and explains the observed behavior during reaction experiments.

When comparing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes on redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, the use of traditional oxidants such as oxygen and nitrogen dioxide (N2O) plays a crucial role in the activation of C-H bonds and the regeneration of catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, like vanadium (V2O5) and vanadium oxides (VOx/SiO2), exhibit different mechanisms for C-H bond activation compared to redox-inactive catalysts, such as ceria (CeO2) and transition metal clusters.

For redox-active catalysts, the process typically involves a redox mechanism where lattice oxygen activates alkane molecules, ultimately forming olefins. This mechanism requires the catalyst to be reduced to allow for the activation of alkane molecules. Upon completion of the reaction, the catalyst needs to be oxidized back to its active state. In the case of N2O, the activation energy of re-oxidation is higher than when using oxygen, suggesting that the rates of catalyst re-oxidation and reduction are closer when using N2O. This difference in activation energies helps explain why oxygen can oxidize a reduced sample at lower temperatures than N2O.

Transition metal clusters might offer a different approach to C-H bond activation, potentially involving more direct interactions and pathways that are not solely dependent on a redox mechanism. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane can vary. For instance, vanadia-based catalysts, which are redox-active, might be more effective due to their ability to switch between oxidation states and facilitate the activation of CO2. However, the proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation and the energy barriers involved can differ among catalyst types, affecting their overall efficiency.

In summary, redox-active catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, can be more efficient in activating C-H bonds and regenerating themselves due to their redox properties, which allow for the activation of alkane molecules and the re-oxidation of the catalyst. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on their ability to switch between oxidation states, the specific pathways they employ, and the energy barriers involved in the activation and deactivation processes.

在比较红氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂上烷烃的氧化脱氢时，传统氧化剂如氧气和氮氧化物（N2O）在C-H键活化和催化剂再生过程中起着关键作用。红氧化还活性催化剂，如钒（V2O5）和钒氧化物（VOx/SiO2），与非氧化还原活性催化剂（如铈氧化物（CeO2）和过渡金属簇）相比，在C-H键活化机制上表现出不同的特性。

对于红氧化还活性催化剂而言，通常涉及一个氧化还原机制，其中晶格氧激活烷烃分子，最终形成烯烃。这个过程需要催化剂被还原以允许烷烃分子的活化。反应完成后，催化剂需要被氧化回其活性状态。当使用N2O时，再氧化的活化能比使用氧气更高，这表明使用N2O作为氧化剂时催化剂的再氧化和还原速率更接近。这种活化能差异有助于解释为什么氧气可以在较低温度下氧化还原样品，而N2O不能。

过渡金属簇可能提供不同的C-H键活化方法，可能涉及更直接的相互作用和路径，这些路径不完全依赖于氧化还原机制。不同催化剂在促进丙烷的氧化脱氢CO2方面的有效性可能有所不同。例如，以红氧化还活性为基础的催化剂（如钒催化剂）可能更为有效，因为它们能够通过改变氧化态来活化CO2并再生催化剂。然而，CO2分解和用于氧化脱氢丙烷的能源壁垒之间的差异会影响它们的整体效率。

综上所述，红氧化还活性催化剂，如钒和钼，由于它们的氧化还原性质而在活化C-H键和催化剂再生方面更有效，这些性质允许活化烷烃分子并再生催化剂。不同催化剂在促进CO2氧化脱氢丙烷的有效性取决于它们改变氧化态的能力、它们采用的具体途径以及激活和去活过程中涉及的能量壁垒。

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves a redox mechanism where the metal oxide catalyst activates the C-H bond of the alkane. For redox-active catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, CO2 can be activated for ODH through a series of steps involving the adsorption, activation, and oxidation of CO2. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 depends on the specific redox properties and the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. Transition metal clusters, on the other hand, might offer unique opportunities for CO2 activation due to their small size and enhanced reactivity. However, the literature does not provide detailed mechanisms for CO2 activation by these clusters specifically. 

In the context of N2O and O2 as oxidants, N2O appears to offer better ethylene selectivity and slower decrease in selectivity with increasing contact time compared to O2. This is attributed to the less oxidized state of the catalyst when using N2O, as indicated by XPS experiments. The activation energy of re-oxidation using N2O is higher than that of O2, which implies a slower re-oxidation rate for N2O. This difference in re-oxidation rates is thought to contribute to the observed behavior during ethane ODH.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH can vary significantly. For instance, V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 might benefit from the higher stability of adsorbed N2O when it decomposes through an oxygen atom, leading to potentially enhanced CO2 activation. The literature suggests that the choice of oxidant (N2O vs. O2) can influence the selectivity and efficiency of the ODH process, with N2O generally providing superior ethylene selectivity. The re-oxidation step is critical in maintaining the catalyst's activity, and the higher re-oxidation rate with O2 compared to N2O implies that the re-oxidation step might be more coupled to the reduction process when using N2O, potentially affecting the catalyst's lifetime and performance.

氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及金属氧化物催化剂激活烷烃中的C-H键的还原-氧化机制。对于活性较强的催化剂如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2，CO2可以通过一系列步骤激活用于ODH，包括吸附、激活和氧化CO2。这些催化剂在激活CO2的有效性上取决于它们的具体还原性质和CO2分解的能量壁垒。

对于作为氧化剂的N2O和O2，N2O提供更高的乙烯选择性和随着接触时间增加而选择性下降速度较慢的现象，这归因于使用N2O时催化剂的还原状态较低，正如XPS实验所示。N2O重新氧化的活化能高于O2，这表明N2O的重新氧化速率较慢。这种差异被认为是观察到的行为的原因之一，在使用N2O进行乙烷ODH过程中。

不同催化剂在激活CO2进行ODH方面的有效性可能会有很大差异。例如，V2O5和VOx/SiO2可能受益于吸附在氧原子上的N2O的更高稳定性，当它通过氧原子分解时，这可能有助于增强CO2的激活。文献表明，选择的氧化剂（N2O与O2）可以影响ODH过程的选择性和效率，使用N2O通常提供更好的乙烯选择性。重新氧化步骤对维持催化剂的活性至关重要，与N2O相比，O2的重新氧化速率较高意味着重新氧化步骤可能与还原过程更紧密耦合，这可能影响催化剂的寿命和性能。
