The study investigates the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane using either oxygen (O2) or nitrous oxide (N2O) as oxidants. The focus is on a 10% molybdenum/silica-titania catalyst. N2O provides superior ethylene selectivities at a given ethane conversion compared to O2. The catalyst structure changes during the reaction, with molybdenum being fully oxidized to Mo(VI) when using O2 and having an average oxidation state of +5.8 when using N2O. The activation energy of re-oxidation when using N2O is 98 kJ/mol, compared to 41 kJ/mol when using O2, leading to a re-oxidation rate at least 1700 times faster with O2. This difference in re-oxidation rates accounts for the less oxidized state of molybdenum during ethane ODH with N2O and explains the observed behavior during reaction experiments.

该研究考察了使用氧气（O2）或亚硝酸氮（N2O）作为氧化剂对乙烷的氧化脱氢反应。重点研究了一种10%钼/硅钛催化剂。与使用O2相比，使用N2O时的乙烯选择性更高。催化剂结构在反应中发生变化，钼在使用O2时完全氧化为Mo(VI)，而在使用N2O时的平均氧化状态为+5.8。再氧化的激活能使用N2O时为98 kJ/mol，而使用O2时为41 kJ/mol，导致O2的再氧化速率至少比N2O快1700倍。这种再氧化率的差异解释了使用N2O时钼的较还原状态以及观察到的反应实验行为。
