[1] "The use of N2O as oxidant makes the activation energy of re-oxidation much closer to the apparent ODH activation energy, which suggests that the rates of catalyst re-oxidation and reduction will be much closer when using N2O as oxidant."
[2] "This difference likely accounts for the ability of O2 to oxidize the reduced sample at lower temperatures than N2O."
[3] "On the basis of our TPO activation energies and assuming equal pre-exponential factors, the O2 re-oxidation rate would be approximately 1700 times faster than the N2O re-oxidation rate at 550 C."

When comparing the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes on redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, the use of traditional oxidants such as oxygen and nitrogen dioxide (N2O) plays a crucial role in the activation of C-H bonds and the regeneration of catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, like vanadium (V2O5) and vanadium oxides (VOx/SiO2), exhibit different mechanisms for C-H bond activation compared to redox-inactive catalysts, such as ceria (CeO2) and transition metal clusters.

For redox-active catalysts, the process typically involves a redox mechanism where lattice oxygen activates alkane molecules, ultimately forming olefins. This mechanism requires the catalyst to be reduced to allow for the activation of alkane molecules. Upon completion of the reaction, the catalyst needs to be oxidized back to its active state. In the case of N2O, the activation energy of re-oxidation is higher than when using oxygen, suggesting that the rates of catalyst re-oxidation and reduction are closer when using N2O. This difference in activation energies helps explain why oxygen can oxidize a reduced sample at lower temperatures than N2O.

Transition metal clusters might offer a different approach to C-H bond activation, potentially involving more direct interactions and pathways that are not solely dependent on a redox mechanism. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane can vary. For instance, vanadia-based catalysts, which are redox-active, might be more effective due to their ability to switch between oxidation states and facilitate the activation of CO2. However, the proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation and the energy barriers involved can differ among catalyst types, affecting their overall efficiency.

In summary, redox-active catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, can be more efficient in activating C-H bonds and regenerating themselves due to their redox properties, which allow for the activation of alkane molecules and the re-oxidation of the catalyst. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on their ability to switch between oxidation states, the specific pathways they employ, and the energy barriers involved in the activation and deactivation processes.

在比较红氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂上烷烃的氧化脱氢时，传统氧化剂如氧气和氮氧化物（N2O）在C-H键活化和催化剂再生过程中起着关键作用。红氧化还活性催化剂，如钒（V2O5）和钒氧化物（VOx/SiO2），与非氧化还原活性催化剂（如铈氧化物（CeO2）和过渡金属簇）相比，在C-H键活化机制上表现出不同的特性。

对于红氧化还活性催化剂而言，通常涉及一个氧化还原机制，其中晶格氧激活烷烃分子，最终形成烯烃。这个过程需要催化剂被还原以允许烷烃分子的活化。反应完成后，催化剂需要被氧化回其活性状态。当使用N2O时，再氧化的活化能比使用氧气更高，这表明使用N2O作为氧化剂时催化剂的再氧化和还原速率更接近。这种活化能差异有助于解释为什么氧气可以在较低温度下氧化还原样品，而N2O不能。

过渡金属簇可能提供不同的C-H键活化方法，可能涉及更直接的相互作用和路径，这些路径不完全依赖于氧化还原机制。不同催化剂在促进丙烷的氧化脱氢CO2方面的有效性可能有所不同。例如，以红氧化还活性为基础的催化剂（如钒催化剂）可能更为有效，因为它们能够通过改变氧化态来活化CO2并再生催化剂。然而，CO2分解和用于氧化脱氢丙烷的能源壁垒之间的差异会影响它们的整体效率。

综上所述，红氧化还活性催化剂，如钒和钼，由于它们的氧化还原性质而在活化C-H键和催化剂再生方面更有效，这些性质允许活化烷烃分子并再生催化剂。不同催化剂在促进CO2氧化脱氢丙烷的有效性取决于它们改变氧化态的能力、它们采用的具体途径以及激活和去活过程中涉及的能量壁垒。
