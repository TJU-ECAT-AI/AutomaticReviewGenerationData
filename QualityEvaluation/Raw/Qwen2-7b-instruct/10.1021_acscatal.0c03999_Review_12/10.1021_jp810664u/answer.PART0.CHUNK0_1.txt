When comparing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes over redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, the use of different oxidants plays a crucial role. For redox-active catalysts like molybdenum supported on silica-titania (Mo/SiTi), the use of nitrogen dioxide (N2O) as an oxidant leads to a more reduced state of the catalyst compared to oxygen (O2). This results in higher selectivities for ethylene production and slower decreases in ethylene selectivity with increasing contact time. The mechanism involves a slower rate of re-oxidation using N2O, which is attributed to a higher activation energy of 98 kJ/mol compared to 41 kJ/mol when using O2. This difference in re-oxidation rates implies that N2O can oxidize the reduced state of the catalyst at a slower pace than O2, allowing for a more stable and less oxidized catalyst surface over longer contact times.

For redox-inactive catalysts, such as vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), vanadium oxide supported on silica (VOx/SiO2), ceria (CeO2), and transition metal clusters, the activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane requires more complex mechanisms. CO2 typically requires high-energy activation barriers for dissociation, especially in the gas phase. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 depends on their ability to lower these barriers through adsorption, interaction, and subsequent activation pathways. For instance, V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 might employ acid sites for CO2 activation, while ceria might utilize its high surface area and oxygen storage capacity to facilitate CO2 activation. Transition metal clusters might offer a combination of reactivity and selectivity due to their unique electronic configurations and surface chemistry. However, the exact mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary among these catalysts, making it difficult to generalize their effectiveness. Further research is needed to precisely understand and optimize these mechanisms for enhanced CO2 activation and propane oxidative dehydrogenation.

当比较具有还原活性和无还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂上的烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）时，不同氧化剂的使用起着关键作用。对于如钼支持在二氧化硅-钛酸盐（Mo/SiTi）这样的还原活性催化剂，使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂导致催化剂处于更还原状态，与使用氧气（O2）相比。这导致乙烯选择性更高，并且随着接触时间增加，乙烯选择性的降低速率较慢。这种机制涉及使用N2O时催化剂的氧化速度较慢，归因于氧化时的激活能为98 kJ/mol，而使用O2时为41 kJ/mol。这种差异表明，与使用O2相比，N2O可以以较慢的速度氧化还原状态的催化剂，从而保持更稳定的和还原程度较低的催化剂表面较长的接触时间。

对于如五氧化二钒（V2O5）、氧化钒支持在二氧化硅（VOx/SiO2）、铈酸盐（CeO2）和过渡金属簇这样的无还原活性催化剂，CO2的激活需要更复杂的机制。CO2通常需要高能量的激活壁垒才能解离，尤其是在气相中。这些催化剂在激活CO2的有效性取决于它们降低这些壁垒的能力，通过吸附、相互作用和随后的激活途径。例如，V2O5和VOx/SiO2可能利用酸性位点来激活CO2，而CeO2可能利用其高表面积和氧储存能力来促进CO2激活。过渡金属簇可能因其独特的电子配置和表面化学特性提供组合的反应性和选择性。然而，这些催化剂之间CO2解离机制的确切性质和优化程度各不相同，使得难以概括它们的效力。进一步的研究需要精确理解并优化这些机制以增强CO2激活和丙烷氧化脱氢。
