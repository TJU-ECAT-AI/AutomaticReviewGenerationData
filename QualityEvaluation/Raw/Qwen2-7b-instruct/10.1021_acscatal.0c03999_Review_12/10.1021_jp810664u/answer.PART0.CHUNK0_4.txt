[1] "N2O can adsorb to the catalyst surface either through a nitrogen atom or the oxygen atom. DFT calculations on a vanadia-based catalyst have suggested that adsorbed N2O is more stable when adsorbed via a nitrogen atom but only decomposes when adsorbed through an oxygen atom."
[2] "The activation energy of re-oxidation when using N2O is 98 kJ/mol, whereas that of O2 is 41 kJ/mol leading to a re-oxidation rate at least 1700 times faster when O2 is the oxidant."
[3] "Use of O2 or N2O as the oxidant was investigated over a Mo/SiTi catalyst for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. N2O gives higher selectivities to ethylene than O2, and the selectivities decrease at a lower rate with increasing contact time."
[4] "Ethylene selectivities decrease with contact time at a far slower rate when using N2O as the oxidant."
[5] "The rate of ethylene formation increases with increasing N2O concentration but is constant with increasing O2 concentration."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves a redox mechanism where the metal oxide catalyst activates the C-H bond of the alkane. For redox-active catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, CO2 can be activated for ODH through a series of steps involving the adsorption, activation, and oxidation of CO2. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 depends on the specific redox properties and the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. Transition metal clusters, on the other hand, might offer unique opportunities for CO2 activation due to their small size and enhanced reactivity. However, the literature does not provide detailed mechanisms for CO2 activation by these clusters specifically. 

In the context of N2O and O2 as oxidants, N2O appears to offer better ethylene selectivity and slower decrease in selectivity with increasing contact time compared to O2. This is attributed to the less oxidized state of the catalyst when using N2O, as indicated by XPS experiments. The activation energy of re-oxidation using N2O is higher than that of O2, which implies a slower re-oxidation rate for N2O. This difference in re-oxidation rates is thought to contribute to the observed behavior during ethane ODH.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH can vary significantly. For instance, V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 might benefit from the higher stability of adsorbed N2O when it decomposes through an oxygen atom, leading to potentially enhanced CO2 activation. The literature suggests that the choice of oxidant (N2O vs. O2) can influence the selectivity and efficiency of the ODH process, with N2O generally providing superior ethylene selectivity. The re-oxidation step is critical in maintaining the catalyst's activity, and the higher re-oxidation rate with O2 compared to N2O implies that the re-oxidation step might be more coupled to the reduction process when using N2O, potentially affecting the catalyst's lifetime and performance.

氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及金属氧化物催化剂激活烷烃中的C-H键的还原-氧化机制。对于活性较强的催化剂如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2，CO2可以通过一系列步骤激活用于ODH，包括吸附、激活和氧化CO2。这些催化剂在激活CO2的有效性上取决于它们的具体还原性质和CO2分解的能量壁垒。

对于作为氧化剂的N2O和O2，N2O提供更高的乙烯选择性和随着接触时间增加而选择性下降速度较慢的现象，这归因于使用N2O时催化剂的还原状态较低，正如XPS实验所示。N2O重新氧化的活化能高于O2，这表明N2O的重新氧化速率较慢。这种差异被认为是观察到的行为的原因之一，在使用N2O进行乙烷ODH过程中。

不同催化剂在激活CO2进行ODH方面的有效性可能会有很大差异。例如，V2O5和VOx/SiO2可能受益于吸附在氧原子上的N2O的更高稳定性，当它通过氧原子分解时，这可能有助于增强CO2的激活。文献表明，选择的氧化剂（N2O与O2）可以影响ODH过程的选择性和效率，使用N2O通常提供更好的乙烯选择性。重新氧化步骤对维持催化剂的活性至关重要，与N2O相比，O2的重新氧化速率较高意味着重新氧化步骤可能与还原过程更紧密耦合，这可能影响催化剂的寿命和性能。
