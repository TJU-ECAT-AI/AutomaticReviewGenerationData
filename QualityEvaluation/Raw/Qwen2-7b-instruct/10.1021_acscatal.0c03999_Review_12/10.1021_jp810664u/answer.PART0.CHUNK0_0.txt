1. The study focuses on the implications of using oxygen and nitrous oxide as oxidants in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation over silica-titania-supported molybdenum catalysts.
2. The investigation places special importance on the influence of the oxidant on the catalyst structure and the kinetics of the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction.
3. The research explores the effects of using nitrogen dioxide (N2O) and oxygen (O2) as oxidants during ethane ODH on a molybdenum-based catalyst.
4. This article is subject to institutional subscription licensing and requires permission for reuse.
5. The study covers catalysts, hydrocarbons, oxides, oxygen, and selectivity as its subjects.
6. To understand the catalyst's behavior, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were conducted after steady-state ethane ODH using either O2 or N2O as oxidants.
7. The XPS spectrum for the post-reaction ethane ODH sample using N2O as the oxidant is depicted in Figure 4b.
8. The working oxidation state of the catalyst differs when performing ODH with O2 or N2O.
9. It is unsurprising that changing the oxygen concentration during ethane ODH does not affect the olefin formation rate, as many studies have demonstrated.
10. The re-oxidation step is kinetically significant when using N2O as the oxidant, as the measured re-oxidation rate closely matches the ethane consumption rate under similar conditions in steady-state ethane ODH experiments.
