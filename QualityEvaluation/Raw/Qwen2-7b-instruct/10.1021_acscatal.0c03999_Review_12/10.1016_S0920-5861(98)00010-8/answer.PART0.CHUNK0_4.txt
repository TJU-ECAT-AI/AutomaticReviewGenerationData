The preparation of the catalyst involves the calcination of magnesium oxalate at 923 K for 3 hours to produce MgO. The MgO is then dried at 343 K under 27 kPa pressure before being held at 383 K overnight. The samples are finally calcined in air at 873 K for 4 hours. The resulting MgO-supported vanadium catalysts are identified by a number indicating the weight percentage of vanadium expressed as V2O5.
