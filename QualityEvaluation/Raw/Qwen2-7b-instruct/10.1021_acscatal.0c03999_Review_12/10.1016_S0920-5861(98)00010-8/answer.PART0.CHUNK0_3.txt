[1] "MgO was prepared by the calcination of magnesium oxalate at 923 K for 3 h."
[2] "The solids were dried at 343 K and 27 KPa and then kept at 383 K overnight."
[3] "Identication of the resulting MgO- supported vanadium catalysts (referred as AC- or OR- series) is afforded by a number that indicates the wt% of vanadium expressed as V2O5 (Tables 1 and 2,respectively)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
MgO was synthesized through the calcination of magnesium oxalate at 923 K for 3 hours. The solids were then dried at 343 K and 27 kPa before being kept at 383 K overnight. The identification of the resulting MgO-supported vanadium catalysts, labeled as AC- or OR-series, was determined by the weight percentage of vanadium expressed as V2O5 (Tables 1 and 2).

<questions>
Compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, explaining the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. Include a discussion on the effectiveness of different catalysts (such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.
