[1] "VanadiumMagnesium oxide (VMgO) catalysts have been proposed as selective catalysts in the oxi- dative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane [14] and propane [510]."
[2] "Two series of catalysts featuring vanadium supported on such MgO were prepared by two variations of the wet- impregnation method: impregnation with an aqueous ammonium metavanadate solution, according to the previously reported procedure [1] (AC-series), or with an organically-based methanolic vanadyl acetylacetonate solution, using different methanol/vanadyl acet- ylacetonate molar ratio (OR-series) [31]."
[3] "The aim of the work, reported in the present paper,include further characterization of VMgO catalysts,clarication of the inuence of preparative methods on their catalytic properties, and a study of the extent to which activity and selectivity in ODH of n-butane could be enhanced by utilizing N2O rather than using molecular oxygen as oxidant."

The document focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane using vanadium-magnesium oxide (VMgO) catalysts prepared through wet-impregnation methods. It aims to characterize these catalysts and understand how preparation methods influence their catalytic properties. The study also investigates the potential benefits of using nitrogen dioxide (N2O) over molecular oxygen as an oxidant for enhancing activity and selectivity in the ODH process.
