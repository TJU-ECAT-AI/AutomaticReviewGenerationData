1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes was studied using VOx species supported over MCM-41. This process was performed with both traditional oxidants (O2) and nitrogen oxides (N2O).

2. Replacing O2 with N2O resulted in a significant decrease in the rates of alkane conversion and alkene formation. Moreover, the formation of CO and CO2 was greatly reduced.

3. Propane influenced the transformation of oxidized VOx species into reduced forms, which showed enhanced activity for oxygen activation and N2O decomposition.

4. Utilizing N2O instead of O2 led to a decrease in overall activity but an increase in olefin selectivity.

5. The presence of alkanes significantly accelerated the decomposition of N2O and oxygen isotopic exchange, with reduced VOx species demonstrating greater reactivity for these processes compared to oxidized ones.

6. Sequential pulsing of O2 and C3H8 in the TAP reactor, along with the 16O2C3H8/18O2C3H8 SSITKA experiment, revealed that COx formation in the presence of O2 involved other oxygen species, distinct from those formed from N2O.

1. 在MCM-41支持下的VOx物种上，进行了烷烃的氧化脱氢反应研究。该过程使用了传统的氧化剂（O2）和氮氧化物（N2O）。

2. 将O2替换为N2O导致烷基转化率和烯烃形成速率降低，同时CO和CO2的生成量显著减少。

3. 丙烷影响了氧化VOx物种向还原形式的转变，显示出增强的氧激活和N2O分解活性。

4. 使用N2O代替O2导致总体活性下降但烯烃选择性增加。

5. 存在烷烃显著加速了N2O的分解和氧同位素交换，其中还原VOx物种对这些过程的活性高于氧化物种。

6. 在TAP反应器中连续脉冲O2和C3H8，以及16O2C3H8/18O2C3H8 SSITKA实验揭示了在O2存在下COx形成涉及其他氧气物种，这些物种与从N2O形成的物种不同。
