[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, n-butane and iso-butane to respective olefins with O2 and N2O was investigated over highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41."
[2] "Upon replacing O2 with N2O, the overall activity decreases but the olefin selectivity increases."
[3] "Transient experiments in the TAP reactor and in a SSITKA set up evidenced, that N2O does not decompose over oxidized VOx species in the absence of alkane, while heterogenous oxygen isotopic exchange between gas-phase 18O2 and lattice 16O of VOx species takes place yielding 18O16O."
[4] "These oxygen species are assumed to be of molecular nature and are not formed from N2O."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes was studied using redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as VOx species supported over MCM-41. Redox-active catalysts, like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, showed distinct behaviors in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The effectiveness varied based on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. Traditional oxidants, such as O2 and N2O, played key roles in activating CO2. Redox-inactive catalysts, on the other hand, were less effective in this process. The use of N2O led to improved olefin selectivity compared to O2, suggesting that N2O may inhibit the formation of non-selective oxygen species involved in alkane combustion and consecutive alkene oxidation. The oxygen isotopic exchange between gas-phase 18O2 and lattice 16O of VOx species was significantly accelerated in the presence of alkanes, indicating the reactivity of reduced VOx species in the decomposition of N2O and oxygen isotopic exchange.

在对MCM-41上支持的红氧化合物催化剂（如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇）进行的研究中，对烷烃的氧化脱氢进行了研究。活性催化剂的有效性基于CO2裂解机制和能量壁垒的不同而有所差异。传统的氧化剂，如O2和N2O，在促进CO2的氧化脱氢过程中发挥了关键作用。相比之下，非活性氧化合物在这一过程中效果较差。使用N2O能够提高烯烃的选择性，与使用O2相比，这表明N2O可能抑制了烷烃燃烧和连续烯烃氧化中形成的非选择性氧物种。在烷烃的存在下，气体相18O2与VOx物种的晶格16O之间的氧同位素交换显著加速，这表明还原的VOx物种在N2O分解和氧同位素交换中的活性。
