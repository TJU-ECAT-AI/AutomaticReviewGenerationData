The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes is typically conducted using redox-active metal oxide catalysts such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters. These catalysts play a crucial role in activating the C-H bonds in alkanes, facilitating their conversion into olefins. However, the process often involves the formation of CO2 as a byproduct, which can hinder the overall efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. The role of traditional oxidants, such as O2, in this context is to provide the necessary oxygen for the oxidative dehydrogenation, thereby enabling the cleavage of C-H bonds. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxides might not efficiently activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation due to their inability to effectively interact with CO2 and promote its dissociation into reactive intermediates. This is critical for the conversion of CO2 into valuable products through oxidative dehydrogenation.

In the case of V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, these materials are known for their high activity in activating C-H bonds in alkanes, leading to the formation of olefins. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation, however, varies depending on the specific properties of the catalyst and the conditions of the reaction. For instance, the presence of transition metals in the catalyst structure might enhance the capability to activate CO2 due to their electronic configurations and potential to form strong bonds with CO2, thus promoting its dissociation and subsequent conversion into desired products.

The Mar-van-Krevelen mechanism, which is consistent with the behavior observed in the TAP and SSITKA reactor systems, suggests that selective and non-selective reactions occur on the lattice oxygen of the metal oxide catalysts. This implies that while some oxygen species facilitate the formation of olefins, others might contribute to non-selective reactions, such as the direct combustion of alkanes to CO2 or the consecutive oxidation of olefins to CO2. The identification of molecular oxygen species that are not formed from N2O highlights the importance of understanding the specific pathways involved in these reactions. This knowledge can guide the development of more efficient catalysts that can selectively convert alkanes into olefins while minimizing the formation of CO2, thereby enhancing the overall process efficiency and sustainability.

氧化脱氢反应通常使用如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇等具有还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂。这些催化剂在烷烃中起着关键作用，促进了C-H键的活化，从而将它们转化为烯烃。然而，在这个过程中通常会产生二氧化碳作为副产品，这可能会阻碍反应的整体效率和选择性。传统氧化剂（如氧气）在这个上下文中扮演的角色是提供必要的氧，以促进氧化脱氢，从而使得C-H键的断裂成为可能。

相比之下，非还原活性的金属氧化物可能无法有效地激活二氧化碳进行氧化脱氢，因为它们缺乏有效与二氧化碳互动并促进其解离的能力，从而形成可转化为有价值产品的活性中间体的能力。对于V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇而言，这些材料因其高活性而在烷烃中活化C-H键方面表现出色，导致烯烃的形成。然而，这些催化剂在激活二氧化碳方面的有效性会因催化剂的具体性质和反应条件而异。

与TAP和SSITKA反应器系统观察到的行为一致的Mar-van-Krevelen机制表明，选择性和非选择性反应发生在金属氧化物催化剂的晶格氧上。这暗示了一些氧物种促进了烯烃的形成，而其他物种则可能参与了非选择性反应，例如烷烃直接燃烧生成二氧化碳或烯烃连续氧化生成二氧化碳。识别不是从N2O形成的分子氧物种的重要性强调了理解这些反应特定途径的重要性。这种知识可以指导开发更高效的催化剂，这些催化剂能够选择性地将烷烃转化为烯烃，同时尽量减少二氧化碳的产生，从而提高整体过程效率和可持续性。
