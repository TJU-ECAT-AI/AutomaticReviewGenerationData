1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes was studied over VOx species supported on MCM-41 using O2 and N2O as oxidants. The experiments involved ethane, propane, n-butane, and iso-butane as reactants.

2. Replacing O2 with N2O leads to a decrease in overall activity, yet it enhances olefin selectivity. This suggests that N2O has a distinct influence on the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

3. The Mar-van-Krevelen mechanism, which includes both selective and non-selective reactions, was observed in the data obtained through TAP and SSITKA experiments. This mechanism operates on lattice oxygen of VOx species for both O2 and N2O-containing feeds.

4. Sequential pulsing of O2 and C3H8 in the TAP reactor and the 16O2C3H8/18O2C3H8 SSITKA experiment revealed that COx formation in the presence of O2 involves additional oxygen species that are not formed from N2O. This finding could explain why N2O performs better in oxidative dehydrogenation.

1. 对于MCM-41上支持的VOx物种，使用O2和N2O作为氧化剂研究了烷烃的氧化脱氢作用。实验涉及乙烷、丙烷、正丁烷和异丁烷作为反应物。

2. 将O2替换为N2O导致整体活性降低，但烯烃选择性增加。这表明N2O在氧化脱氢过程中具有独特的效果。

3. 在TAP和SSITKA实验中获得的数据与Mar-van-Krevelen机制一致，该机制包括在VOx物种的晶格氧上的选择性和非选择性反应。这一机制适用于O2和N2O含有的喂料。

4. TAP反应器中O2和C3H8的序列脉冲以及16O2C3H8/18O2C3H8 SSITKA实验揭示，在O2存在的条件下，COx形成涉及到额外的氧物种，这些物种不是从N2O形成的。这一发现可以解释为什么N2O在氧化脱氢中表现出更好的性能。
