[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, n-butane and iso-butane to respective olefins with O2 and N2O was investigated over highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41."
[2] "Upon replacing O2 with N2O, the overall activity decreases but the olefin selectivity increases."
[3] "TAP results, and SSITKA data consistent with Mar-van-Krevelen mechanism, where selective, and non-selective reactions occur on lattice oxygen of VOx species."
[4] "These oxygen species are assumed to be of molecular nature and are not formed from N2O."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons was studied using metal oxide catalysts, specifically VOx species supported on MCM-41. Replacing O2 with N2O resulted in decreased overall activity but increased olefin selectivity. Transient experiments confirmed the Mar-van-Krevelen mechanism, showing selective and non-selective reactions on the lattice oxygen of the catalyst. The non-selective oxygen species, which contribute to COx formation, are assumed to be molecular in nature and not produced by N2O.

对烃类的氧化脱氢化进行了研究，使用了MCM-41支持的VOx物种作为催化剂。用N2O代替O2后，总体活性降低但烯烃选择性提高。瞬态实验证实了Mar-van-Krevelen机制的存在，该机制在催化剂的晶格氧上发生选择性和非选择性反应。导致COx生成的非选择性氧物种被假设为分子性质，并且不是由N2O产生的。
