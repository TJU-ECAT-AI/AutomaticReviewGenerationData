The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, require traditional oxidants like O2 for activation, whereas redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 and transition metal clusters can activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The effectiveness of these catalysts depends on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. For instance, the Pt(111) surface prefers reforming of ethane to form CO, while the Mo2C(001) surface leads to ethylene formation due to its stronger affinity for oxygen. The addition of H2 to the reaction feed can improve the initial catalytic activity by removing inactive oxide species and restoring the active carbidic phase, especially for catalysts like Mo2C. Insitu XANES measurements can confirm the oxidation state of Mo2C under reaction conditions, revealing that treatment in H2 removes oxide species, and treatment in pure CO2 completely oxidizes Mo2C, suggesting that adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase which dehydrogenates ethane.

氧化脱氢作用于烷烃中的C-H键激活及催化剂再生机制在活性氧化还原和非活性氧化还原金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。例如，V2O5和VOx/SiO2这样的活性氧化还原催化剂需要传统氧化剂如O2进行激活，而CeO2和过渡金属簇等非活性氧化还原催化剂可以通过激活CO2进行丙烷的氧化脱氢。这些催化剂的有效性取决于CO2解离的提议机制和能量壁垒。例如，Pt(111)表面更倾向于使乙烷重新形成CO，而Mo2C(001)表面则导致乙烷生成乙烯，这是因为Mo2C(001)对氧具有更强的亲和力。向反应流中添加H2可以改善初始催化活性，通过去除无活性氧化物物种并恢复活性碳化物相来修复催化剂，特别是对于像Mo2C这样的催化剂。原位XANES测量可以确认Mo2C在反应条件下的氧化状态，表明H2处理可以去除碳化物期间形成的氧化物物种，并且纯CO2处理完全氧化Mo2C，这表明吸附自CO2是必要的，以形成一个含氧碳化物相，它会脱氢乙烷。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes is a complex process influenced by the choice of catalyst and the nature of the alkane being reacted. For redox-active metal oxide catalysts such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, CO2 is typically activated through the formation of oxides or oxycarbides on the catalyst surface. This activation facilitates the breaking of C-H bonds in alkanes, allowing for the production of alkenes. The effectiveness of these catalysts varies based on their ability to facilitate CO2 dissociation and the strength of the interaction between the catalyst and alkane molecules.

In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like transition metal clusters, may not efficiently activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation. Instead, they might rely on other mechanisms or require the presence of a co-catalyst to enhance CO2 activation. The role of traditional oxidants, such as oxygen, is crucial in providing the necessary energy for the breaking of C-H and C-O bonds during the reaction.

For example, in the case of propane oxidative dehydrogenation, V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 catalysts are known to be effective due to their ability to promote CO2 activation and subsequent C-H bond cleavage. CeO2, on the other hand, might exhibit different reactivity patterns due to its unique properties as an oxygen storage and release material. Transition metal clusters could potentially act as redox-inactive catalysts, requiring additional strategies to activate CO2 effectively.

The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and the specific mechanisms involved depend on the catalyst properties, such as surface area, morphology, and the nature of the interactions between the catalyst and reactants. Detailed kinetic studies, including the measurement of reaction orders and the analysis of XANES spectra, can provide insights into the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

氧化脱氢反应是烷烃与活性氧源之间的复杂过程，其结果是生成烯烃。对于具有还原性氧化物催化剂如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2，CO2通过在催化剂表面形成氧化物或氧化碳化物被激活。这种激活有助于烷烃中C-H键的断裂，从而促进烯烃的产生。不同催化剂的有效性取决于它们激活CO2的能力及其与烷烃分子之间的相互作用强度。

相比之下，非还原性氧化物催化剂如过渡金属簇可能无法有效地激活CO2进行氧化脱氢。相反，它们可能依赖于其他机制，或者需要辅助催化剂来增强CO2的激活。传统氧化剂（如氧气）在提供分解C-H和C-O键所需的能量方面起着关键作用。

例如，在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中，V2O5和VOx/SiO2催化剂因其能够促进CO2激活和随后的C-H键断裂而表现出有效性。CeO2可能由于其作为氧存储和释放材料的独特性质而表现出不同的反应模式。过渡金属簇可能作为非还原性催化剂发挥作用，需要额外策略来有效激活CO2。

CO2分解的能量壁垒以及涉及的具体机制取决于催化剂特性，包括表面积、形态和催化剂与反应物之间的相互作用性质。详细的动力学研究，包括反应顺序的测量和XANES光谱分析，可以提供不同催化剂在激活CO2用于烷烃氧化脱氢方面的有效性的洞察。

The study highlights the use of Pt/CeO2 catalysts for the production of synthesis gas through dry reforming of ethane with CO2. The Mo2C-based materials, on the other hand, maintain the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene. The research identifies that the high reaction temperatures and catalyst deactivation pose challenges in reforming methane and CO2. It demonstrates that the binding energy difference between Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) is more significant for oxygen-bound adsorbates compared to carbon-bound ones. Over the Mo2C(001) surface, hydrogen tends to recombine and desorb as hydrogen gas. The study also notes that adding a small amount of hydrogen to the reaction feed can improve the activity of the Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Furthermore, the XANES measurements reveal changes in the oxidation state of Mo2C during different gas treatments, with notable exceptions.

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves the activation of C-H bonds, typically by redox-active metal oxides such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters. The proposed mechanisms often involve the dissociation of CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with the effectiveness of the catalysts influenced by the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

2. Redox-active metal oxides like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2 play a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by activating CO2. They facilitate the dissociation of CO2 into CO and O atoms, which then react with the alkane molecule to produce the desired products.

3. Transition metal clusters, on the other hand, offer a different approach to activate CO2. They can potentially reduce the activation energy for CO2 dissociation, enhancing the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

4. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation is influenced by factors such as the strength of the catalyst's surface, the presence of active sites, and the ability to modulate the reaction environment. For instance, CeO2 is effective in promoting CO2 reduction due to its high oxygen mobility.

5. Redox-inactive metal oxides may not directly activate CO2 but can still contribute to the oxidative dehydrogenation process by providing a suitable surface for the alkane molecule to interact with, facilitating the reaction.

6. The redox-active nature of catalysts such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 allows them to change oxidation states during the reaction, which is beneficial for the activation of CO2. This redox capability helps in breaking the C-O bonds in CO2, enabling it to participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction.

7. The role of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation process is to serve as a mild oxidant, helping to break the alkane's C-H bonds. The efficiency of this process depends on the catalyst's ability to facilitate the dissociation of CO2 and its subsequent reaction with the alkane molecule.

8. Catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation typically involves removing inactive oxide species through treatment with a reducing agent, such as hydrogen (H2). This process restores the catalyst's active phase, allowing for continuous operation.

9. The adsorbed oxygen from CO2 plays a critical role in forming an oxycarbide phase on Mo2C-based catalysts, which is essential for the dehydrogenation of ethane. However, this same oxygen can also contribute to the deactivation of the catalyst, potentially through oxidation or by promoting coke formation.

1. 氧化脱氢作用涉及到烷烃中的C-H键激活，通常由如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇等具有还原活性的氧化物完成。对于丙烷的氧化脱氢，通常涉及CO2的分解，催化剂的有效性受到CO2分解能垒的影响。

2. 如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2这样的还原活性氧化物在烷烃的氧化脱氢中起着关键作用，它们通过促进CO2分解为CO和O原子来激活CO2。

3. 过渡金属簇提供了另一种激活CO2的方法，可能降低了CO2分解的活化能，提高了氧化脱氢过程的效率。

4. 这些催化剂在激活CO2方面的有效性受到表面强度、活性位点的存在以及调节反应环境的能力的影响。例如，CeO2由于其高氧流动性而表现出在促进CO2还原方面的有效性。

5. 不具有还原活性的氧化物可能直接不激活CO2，但仍然可以通过提供与烷烃分子相互作用的适当表面来促进氧化脱氢过程，从而促进反应。

6. 这些催化剂的还原活性，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2的特性，允许它们在反应过程中改变氧化状态，这对激活CO2非常有益。这种还原能力有助于打破CO2的C-O键，使其参与氧化脱氢反应。

7. 在氧化脱氢过程中，CO2的作用是作为温和的氧化剂，帮助断裂烷烃的C-H键。这一过程的效率取决于催化剂激活CO2并随后与烷烃分子反应的能力。

8. 催化剂再生通常涉及通过还原剂（如氢气）去除无活性的氧化物，这恢复了催化剂的活性相，允许连续操作。

9. CO2吸附在Mo2C基催化剂上形成的氧化碳化物相对乙烷的脱氢至关重要，但也可能通过氧化或促进焦炭形成来导致催化剂失活。

This study investigates the use of ethane and CO2 in a single process to produce higher-value products. Ethane dry reforming produces synthesis gas (CO+H2), while oxidative dehydrogenation produces ethylene. Pt/CeO2 catalysts are effective for synthesis gas production, whereas Mo2C-based catalysts preserve the CC bond for ethylene production. DFT calculations reveal that the binding energy difference between Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) surfaces varies significantly depending on whether the adsorbate is bound by an oxygen or carbon atom. Mo2C(001) surface preferentially dehydrogenates ethane, forming CH2CH2*, while Pt(111) surface promotes reforming of ethane to CO. Deactivation occurs for both Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, and reaction order measurements for ethane indicate a negative order, decreasing catalytic activity with increasing ethane concentration. XANES measurements demonstrate that Mo2C oxidation during CO2 treatment leads to its deactivation, possibly through the formation of an oxycarbide phase that dehydrogenates ethane but also contributes to catalyst deactivation.

这项研究探讨了使用乙烷和二氧化碳在一个过程中生产更高价值产品的可能性。乙烷干重整产生合成气（CO+H2），而氧化脱氢则产生乙烯。Pt/CeO2催化剂在合成气生产中表现良好，而Mo2C基催化剂则保持CC键以产生乙烯。DFT计算表明，Pt(111)和Mo2C(001)表面之间的吸附物的结合能差异显著取决于吸附物是否由氧或碳原子绑定。Mo2C(001)表面偏好脱氢乙烷形成CH2CH2*，而Pt(111)表面则促进乙烷的重整以生成CO。对于Pt/CeO2和Mo2C/γ-Al2O3催化剂，均会出现失活现象，且乙烷反应顺序测量显示为负数，即乙烷浓度增加导致催化活性降低。XANES测量表明，在CO2处理期间，Mo2C的氧化导致其失活，可能通过形成一个氧化碳化物相来脱氢乙烷，但这也部分贡献了催化剂失活。
