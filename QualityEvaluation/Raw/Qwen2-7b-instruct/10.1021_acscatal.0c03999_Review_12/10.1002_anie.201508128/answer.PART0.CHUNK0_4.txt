<p>The recent shale gas boom combined with the requirement to reduce atmospheric CO2 have created an opportunity for using both raw materials (shale gas and CO2) in a single process. Shale gas is primarily made up of methane, but ethane comprises about 10% and reserves are underutilized.</p>
<p>Two routes have been investigated by combining ethane decomposition with CO2 reduction to produce products of higher value. The first reaction is ethane dry reforming which produces synthesis gas (CO+H2).</p>
<p>The results of this study indicate that the Pt/CeO2 catalyst shows promise for the production of synthesis gas, while Mo2C-based materials preserve the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene.</p>
<p>It is noted that, for adsorbates with similar binding configurations, the binding energy difference between Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) is more pronounced for species adsorbed by the oxygen atom than those using the carbon atom.</p>
<p>The DFT-calculated BEdiff is 3.53eV for atomic oxygen, while it is only 1.60eV for atomic carbon.</p>
<p>Over Mo2C(001), the atomic hydrogen prefers to recombine and desorb from the surface in the form of hydrogen gas.</p>
<p>On Pt(111), the CC bond cleavage of ethane to form CH3*, CO*, and H2O(g) is not only exothermic, but also more favorable compared to the selective CH bond cleavage to form CH2CH2*.</p>
<p>The Mo2C(001) surface preferentially dehydrogenates ethane to form CH2CH2*.</p>
<p>Deactivation is not only limited to Mo2C/CeO2, but is clearly seen for both Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 in Figure2.</p>
<p>To better understand the mechanism of rapid deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, reaction order measurements were performed for ethane.</p>
<p>Clearly, as shown in the Supporting Information, the reaction order is negative with respect to ethane, meaning increasing concentrations of ethane decreases the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>The XANES measurements of Mo2C show clear changes in the oxidation state of Mo during all gas treatments, except for pure ethane.</p>
<p>Upon reaction of ethane and CO2, Mo2C is oxidized to a greater degree.</p>
<p>Treatment in pure CO2, however, completely oxidizes Mo2C.</p>

This study investigates the use of ethane and CO2 in a single process to produce higher-value products. Ethane dry reforming produces synthesis gas (CO+H2), while oxidative dehydrogenation produces ethylene. Pt/CeO2 catalysts are effective for synthesis gas production, whereas Mo2C-based catalysts preserve the CC bond for ethylene production. DFT calculations reveal that the binding energy difference between Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) surfaces varies significantly depending on whether the adsorbate is bound by an oxygen or carbon atom. Mo2C(001) surface preferentially dehydrogenates ethane, forming CH2CH2*, while Pt(111) surface promotes reforming of ethane to CO. Deactivation occurs for both Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, and reaction order measurements for ethane indicate a negative order, decreasing catalytic activity with increasing ethane concentration. XANES measurements demonstrate that Mo2C oxidation during CO2 treatment leads to its deactivation, possibly through the formation of an oxycarbide phase that dehydrogenates ethane but also contributes to catalyst deactivation.

这项研究探讨了使用乙烷和二氧化碳在一个过程中生产更高价值产品的可能性。乙烷干重整产生合成气（CO+H2），而氧化脱氢则产生乙烯。Pt/CeO2催化剂在合成气生产中表现良好，而Mo2C基催化剂则保持CC键以产生乙烯。DFT计算表明，Pt(111)和Mo2C(001)表面之间的吸附物的结合能差异显著取决于吸附物是否由氧或碳原子绑定。Mo2C(001)表面偏好脱氢乙烷形成CH2CH2*，而Pt(111)表面则促进乙烷的重整以生成CO。对于Pt/CeO2和Mo2C/γ-Al2O3催化剂，均会出现失活现象，且乙烷反应顺序测量显示为负数，即乙烷浓度增加导致催化活性降低。XANES测量表明，在CO2处理期间，Mo2C的氧化导致其失活，可能通过形成一个氧化碳化物相来脱氢乙烷，但这也部分贡献了催化剂失活。
