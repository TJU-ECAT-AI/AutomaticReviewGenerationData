<p>It is noted that, for adsorbates with similar binding configurations, the binding energy difference between Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) is more pronounced for species adsorbed by the oxygen atom than those using the carbon atom.</p>
<p>The DFT-calculated BEdiff is 3.53eV for atomic oxygen, while it is only 1.60eV for atomic carbon.</p>
<p>Over Mo2C(001), the atomic hydrogen prefers to recombine and desorb from the surface in the form of hydrogen gas.</p>
<p>On Pt(111), the CC bond cleavage of ethane to form CH3*, CO*, and H2O(g) is not only exothermic, but also more favorable compared to the selective CH bond cleavage to form CH2CH2*.</p>
<p>On Mo2C(001), the stronger affinity of Mo2C(001) for oxygen makes CO bond formation less favorable on Mo2C(001) than on Pt(111).</p>
<p>The lower activation barrier of CO2 over Pt/CeO2 confirms the relatively high activity of CeO2-based materials toward CO2.</p>

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, require traditional oxidants like O2 for activation, whereas redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 and transition metal clusters can activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The effectiveness of these catalysts depends on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. For instance, the Pt(111) surface prefers reforming of ethane to form CO, while the Mo2C(001) surface leads to ethylene formation due to its stronger affinity for oxygen. The addition of H2 to the reaction feed can improve the initial catalytic activity by removing inactive oxide species and restoring the active carbidic phase, especially for catalysts like Mo2C. Insitu XANES measurements can confirm the oxidation state of Mo2C under reaction conditions, revealing that treatment in H2 removes oxide species, and treatment in pure CO2 completely oxidizes Mo2C, suggesting that adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase which dehydrogenates ethane.

氧化脱氢作用于烷烃中的C-H键激活及催化剂再生机制在活性氧化还原和非活性氧化还原金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。例如，V2O5和VOx/SiO2这样的活性氧化还原催化剂需要传统氧化剂如O2进行激活，而CeO2和过渡金属簇等非活性氧化还原催化剂可以通过激活CO2进行丙烷的氧化脱氢。这些催化剂的有效性取决于CO2解离的提议机制和能量壁垒。例如，Pt(111)表面更倾向于使乙烷重新形成CO，而Mo2C(001)表面则导致乙烷生成乙烯，这是因为Mo2C(001)对氧具有更强的亲和力。向反应流中添加H2可以改善初始催化活性，通过去除无活性氧化物物种并恢复活性碳化物相来修复催化剂，特别是对于像Mo2C这样的催化剂。原位XANES测量可以确认Mo2C在反应条件下的氧化状态，表明H2处理可以去除碳化物期间形成的氧化物物种，并且纯CO2处理完全氧化Mo2C，这表明吸附自CO2是必要的，以形成一个含氧碳化物相，它会脱氢乙烷。
