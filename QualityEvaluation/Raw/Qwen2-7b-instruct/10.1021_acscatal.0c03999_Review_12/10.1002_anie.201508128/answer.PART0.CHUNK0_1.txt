[1] "The two pathways of the reaction (see picture) were controlled by the choice of catalyst."
[2] "For decades, researchers have attempted dry reforming of methane and CO2, but breakthroughs have been difficult because of the high reaction temperatures (ca. 700C) and deactivation of catalysts."
[3] "Dry reforming of ethane, however, becomes thermodynamically favorable at a lower temperature than for methane (ca. 600C), making the process more feasible under milder conditions."
[4] "It is noted that, for adsorbates with similar binding configurations, the binding energy difference between Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) is more pronounced for species adsorbed by the oxygen atom than those using the carbon atom."
[5] "Over Mo2C(001), the atomic hydrogen prefers to recombine and desorb from the surface in the form of hydrogen gas."
[6] "On Pt(111), the CC bond cleavage of ethane to form CH3*, CO*, and H2O(g) is not only exothermic, but also more favorable compared to the selective CH bond cleavage to form CH2CH2*."
[7] "The Mo2C(001) surface preferentially dehydrogenates ethane to form CH2CH2*."
[8] "To better understand the mechanism of rapid deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, reaction order measurements were performed for ethane."
[9] "Treatment in pure CO2, however, completely oxidizes Mo2C."
[10] "Therefore, the adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, but also likely contributes, at least partially, to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes is a complex process influenced by the choice of catalyst and the nature of the alkane being reacted. For redox-active metal oxide catalysts such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, CO2 is typically activated through the formation of oxides or oxycarbides on the catalyst surface. This activation facilitates the breaking of C-H bonds in alkanes, allowing for the production of alkenes. The effectiveness of these catalysts varies based on their ability to facilitate CO2 dissociation and the strength of the interaction between the catalyst and alkane molecules.

In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like transition metal clusters, may not efficiently activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation. Instead, they might rely on other mechanisms or require the presence of a co-catalyst to enhance CO2 activation. The role of traditional oxidants, such as oxygen, is crucial in providing the necessary energy for the breaking of C-H and C-O bonds during the reaction.

For example, in the case of propane oxidative dehydrogenation, V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 catalysts are known to be effective due to their ability to promote CO2 activation and subsequent C-H bond cleavage. CeO2, on the other hand, might exhibit different reactivity patterns due to its unique properties as an oxygen storage and release material. Transition metal clusters could potentially act as redox-inactive catalysts, requiring additional strategies to activate CO2 effectively.

The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and the specific mechanisms involved depend on the catalyst properties, such as surface area, morphology, and the nature of the interactions between the catalyst and reactants. Detailed kinetic studies, including the measurement of reaction orders and the analysis of XANES spectra, can provide insights into the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

氧化脱氢反应是烷烃与活性氧源之间的复杂过程，其结果是生成烯烃。对于具有还原性氧化物催化剂如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2，CO2通过在催化剂表面形成氧化物或氧化碳化物被激活。这种激活有助于烷烃中C-H键的断裂，从而促进烯烃的产生。不同催化剂的有效性取决于它们激活CO2的能力及其与烷烃分子之间的相互作用强度。

相比之下，非还原性氧化物催化剂如过渡金属簇可能无法有效地激活CO2进行氧化脱氢。相反，它们可能依赖于其他机制，或者需要辅助催化剂来增强CO2的激活。传统氧化剂（如氧气）在提供分解C-H和C-O键所需的能量方面起着关键作用。

例如，在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中，V2O5和VOx/SiO2催化剂因其能够促进CO2激活和随后的C-H键断裂而表现出有效性。CeO2可能由于其作为氧存储和释放材料的独特性质而表现出不同的反应模式。过渡金属簇可能作为非还原性催化剂发挥作用，需要额外策略来有效激活CO2。

CO2分解的能量壁垒以及涉及的具体机制取决于催化剂特性，包括表面积、形态和催化剂与反应物之间的相互作用性质。详细的动力学研究，包括反应顺序的测量和XANES光谱分析，可以提供不同催化剂在激活CO2用于烷烃氧化脱氢方面的有效性的洞察。
