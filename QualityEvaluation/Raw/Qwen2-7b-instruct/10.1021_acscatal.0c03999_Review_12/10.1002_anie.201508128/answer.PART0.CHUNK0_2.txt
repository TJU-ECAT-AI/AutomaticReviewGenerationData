<p>The results of this study indicate that the Pt/CeO2 catalyst shows promise for the production of synthesis gas, while Mo2C-based materials preserve the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene.</p>
<p>For decades, researchers have attempted dry reforming of methane and CO2, but breakthroughs have been difficult because of the high reaction temperatures (ca. 700C) and deactivation of catalysts.</p>
<p>It is noted that, for adsorbates with similar binding configurations, the binding energy difference between Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) is more pronounced for species adsorbed by the oxygen atom than those using the carbon atom.</p>
<p>Over Mo2C(001), the atomic hydrogen prefers to recombine and desorb from the surface in the form of hydrogen gas.</p>
<p>Because CeO2 has been shown to be an excellent support for reactions involving CO2, an additional test was performed by supporting Mo2C on CeO2.</p>
<p>Deactivation is not only limited to Mo2C/CeO2, but is clearly seen for both Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 in Figure2.</p>
<p>The XANES measurements of Mo2C show clear changes in the oxidation state of Mo during all gas treatments, except for pure ethane.</p>

The study highlights the use of Pt/CeO2 catalysts for the production of synthesis gas through dry reforming of ethane with CO2. The Mo2C-based materials, on the other hand, maintain the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene. The research identifies that the high reaction temperatures and catalyst deactivation pose challenges in reforming methane and CO2. It demonstrates that the binding energy difference between Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) is more significant for oxygen-bound adsorbates compared to carbon-bound ones. Over the Mo2C(001) surface, hydrogen tends to recombine and desorb as hydrogen gas. The study also notes that adding a small amount of hydrogen to the reaction feed can improve the activity of the Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Furthermore, the XANES measurements reveal changes in the oxidation state of Mo2C during different gas treatments, with notable exceptions.

该研究强调了使用Pt/CeO2催化剂通过乙烷与CO2的干重整来生产合成气。另一方面，Mo2C基材料保持乙烷的CC键以产生乙烯。研究指出，高温和催化剂失活在甲烷和CO2重整中带来了挑战。它表明，Pt(111)和Mo2C(001)表面之间的吸附物的结合能差异对于氧绑定吸附物比碳绑定吸附物更为显著。在Mo2C(001)表面上，氢倾向于重新组合并作为氢气从表面脱附。研究还指出，向反应流体中添加少量氢可以提高Mo2C/γ-Al2O3催化剂的活性。此外，XANES测量揭示了Mo2C在不同气体处理过程中的氧化状态变化，其中纯乙烷是一个明显的例外。
