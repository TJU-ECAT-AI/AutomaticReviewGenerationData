[1] "The two pathways of the reaction (see picture) were controlled by the choice of catalyst."
[2] "For decades, researchers have attempted dry reforming of methane and CO2, but breakthroughs have been difficult because of the high reaction temperatures (ca. 700C) and deactivation of catalysts."
[3] "The difference in reaction temperatures between ethane and methane dry reforming also provides a potential opportunity for reactively separating shale gas, thereby directly producing synthesis gas from ethane and CO2, while leaving the methane unreacted."
[4] "The Pt(111) surface promotes reforming of ethane to form CO."
[5] "On Mo2C(001), the stronger affinity of Mo2C(001) for oxygen makes CO bond formation less favorable on Mo2C(001) than on Pt(111), which agrees well with previous studies showing that Mo2C(001) binds carbon and oxygen very strongly, leading to spontaneous cleavage of the CO bond."
[6] "Because CeO2 has been shown to be an excellent support for reactions involving CO2, an additional test was performed by supporting Mo2C on CeO2."
[7] "The addition of H2 improves the initial catalytic activity, but the CO selectivity increases while that of ethylene decreases."
[8] "Treatment in pure CO2, however, completely oxidizes Mo2C."
[9] "Therefore, the adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, but also likely contributes, at least partially, to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves the activation of C-H bonds, typically by redox-active metal oxides such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters. The proposed mechanisms often involve the dissociation of CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with the effectiveness of the catalysts influenced by the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

2. Redox-active metal oxides like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2 play a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by activating CO2. They facilitate the dissociation of CO2 into CO and O atoms, which then react with the alkane molecule to produce the desired products.

3. Transition metal clusters, on the other hand, offer a different approach to activate CO2. They can potentially reduce the activation energy for CO2 dissociation, enhancing the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

4. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation is influenced by factors such as the strength of the catalyst's surface, the presence of active sites, and the ability to modulate the reaction environment. For instance, CeO2 is effective in promoting CO2 reduction due to its high oxygen mobility.

5. Redox-inactive metal oxides may not directly activate CO2 but can still contribute to the oxidative dehydrogenation process by providing a suitable surface for the alkane molecule to interact with, facilitating the reaction.

6. The redox-active nature of catalysts such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 allows them to change oxidation states during the reaction, which is beneficial for the activation of CO2. This redox capability helps in breaking the C-O bonds in CO2, enabling it to participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction.

7. The role of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation process is to serve as a mild oxidant, helping to break the alkane's C-H bonds. The efficiency of this process depends on the catalyst's ability to facilitate the dissociation of CO2 and its subsequent reaction with the alkane molecule.

8. Catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation typically involves removing inactive oxide species through treatment with a reducing agent, such as hydrogen (H2). This process restores the catalyst's active phase, allowing for continuous operation.

9. The adsorbed oxygen from CO2 plays a critical role in forming an oxycarbide phase on Mo2C-based catalysts, which is essential for the dehydrogenation of ethane. However, this same oxygen can also contribute to the deactivation of the catalyst, potentially through oxidation or by promoting coke formation.
