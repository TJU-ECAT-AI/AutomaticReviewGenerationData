[1] "In order to understand the catalytic properties of the basic catalysts linked to the pretreatment conditions, it is important to be able to characterize the adsorbates remaining on the surface before the catalytic reaction and, as a consequence, to know which basic sites are available after the thermal treatment."
[2] "Combined experimental infrared (IR) and theoretical approaches have been carried out in an attempt to specify the actual structure of the CO2 species adsorbed on the magnesium oxide surface."
[3] "Analyzing the nature of basic sites, the results show that the most active site versus CO2, which is a Lewis acid, is not the same as the strongest site for the deprotonating adsorption of Brnsted acids."
[4] "Thus, even of the same nature, Lewis and Brnsted basic sites differ by their basicity strength scale."

This study uses a combination of experimental infrared (IR) spectroscopy and theoretical density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the adsorption of CO2 on magnesium oxide (MgO) surfaces. The research aims to understand the nature of basic sites available on MgO surfaces after pretreatment processes. It reveals that the most active site for CO2, a Lewis acid, is different from the strongest site for Brnsted acid deprotonation. This indicates that Lewis and Brnsted basic sites on MgO surfaces have distinct strengths despite being of the same nature. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the catalytic properties of basic catalysts related to pretreatment conditions.

本研究利用实验红外光谱与理论密度泛函理论（DFT）相结合的方法，探究镁氧化物（MgO）表面CO2吸附的结构。研究旨在理解MgO表面在预处理过程后的基本位点特性。结果显示，对于Lewis酸CO2而言，最活跃的基本位点与最强的Brnsted酸脱质子吸附位点不同。这表明，尽管性质相同，MgO表面的Lewis和Brnsted基本位点具有不同的强度。这些发现有助于更好地理解与预处理条件相关的基本催化剂的催化性能。
