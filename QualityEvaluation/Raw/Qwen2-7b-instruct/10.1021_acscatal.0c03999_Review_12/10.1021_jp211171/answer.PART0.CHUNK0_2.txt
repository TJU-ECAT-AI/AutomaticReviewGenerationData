In the study, infrared (IR) spectroscopy and theoretical approaches were employed to identify the structure of carbon dioxide (CO2) species adsorbed on magnesium oxide (MgO) surfaces. DRIFT (Diffuse Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy was utilized to monitor the interaction of CO2 with the MgO powder sample prepared through precipitation. The stability of carbonate species was also calculated as a function of temperature using a thermodynamic model. The research revealed that the most effective site for CO2 adsorption, a Lewis acid, differs from the site with the highest Brnsted basicity, which is crucial for deprotonation reactions.

在这项研究中，红外（IR）光谱学和理论方法被用来确定吸附在镁氧化物（MgO）表面的二氧化碳（CO2）物种的实际结构。利用DRIFT（扩散反射傅里叶变换红外）光谱法监测了通过沉淀法制备的MgO粉状样品与CO2的相互作用。通过热力学模型计算了碳酸盐物种随温度变化的稳定性。研究表明，对于Lewis酸CO2而言，最强的吸附位点不同于具有最高Brnsted碱性的位点，后者对于脱质子化反应至关重要。
