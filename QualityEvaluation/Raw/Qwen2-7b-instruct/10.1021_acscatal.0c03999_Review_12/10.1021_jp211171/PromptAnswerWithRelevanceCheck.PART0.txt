[1] "In order to understand the catalytic properties of the basic catalysts linked to the pretreatment conditions, it is important to be able to characterize the adsorbates remaining on the surface before the catalytic reaction and, as a consequence, to know which basic sites are available after the thermal treatment."
[2] "Analyzing the nature of basic sites, the results show that the most active site versus CO2, which is a Lewis acid, is not the same as the strongest site for the deprotonating adsorption of Brnsted acids."
[3] "Thus, even of the same nature, Lewis and Brnsted basic sites differ by their basicity strength scale."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the importance of characterizing adsorbates and basic sites on catalyst surfaces before and after thermal treatments. It highlights that the most active site for adsorbing a Lewis acid like CO2 is not necessarily the same as the strongest site for deprotonating Brnsted acids. The basicity strength scales differ between Lewis and Brnsted sites, even if they share the same nature.

[1] "Combined experimental infrared (IR) and theoretical approaches have been carried out in an attempt to specify the actual structure of the CO2 species adsorbed on the magnesium oxide surface."
[2] "As CO2 is a Lewis acid, while H2O or methanol used in previous studies are Brnsted acidic molecules, the discussion of the results will involve a comparison between Lewis and Brnsted basic properties of MgO."
[3] "Theoretical IR frequencies compared with IR experiments show distinguishable carbonate species, adsorbed on different planes and defects, vibrating in different IR-frequency ranges."
[4] "In addition, by means of thermodynamic model, the stability of carbonates as a function of temperature have been calculated and compared to the experiment."
[5] "Analyzing the nature of basic sites, the results show that the most active site versus CO2, which is a Lewis acid, is not the same as the strongest site for the deprotonating adsorption of Brnsted acids."
[6] "Results show that the strongest basic site versus CO2, which is a Lewis acid, is not the same as that of the strongest basic site for the deprotonating adsorption of Brnsted acids."

Comparing the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts involves understanding how different catalysts interact with CO2. In the case of redox-active metal oxides like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, the activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane involves the dissociation of CO2 into CO and O2, facilitated by the redox properties of the catalyst. The redox reactions allow the catalyst to absorb CO2, which is then activated for the dehydrogenation process. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 and transition metal clusters rely on external oxidants to activate CO2. For instance, V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and transition metal clusters can effectively activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, as evidenced by the energy barrier for CO2 dissociation being overcome by the catalytic activity. However, the effectiveness varies based on the specific catalyst and the proposed mechanisms of CO2 activation, which often involve the formation of intermediate species that facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction.

对于氧化脱氢反应中烷烃的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制的比较，涉及到不同催化剂与二氧化碳的相互作用。对于具有氧化还原活性的金属氧化物，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，二氧化碳的激活涉及CO2的分解为CO和O2，通过催化剂的氧化还原性质实现。氧化还原反应允许催化剂吸收CO2，随后激活该过程进行脱氢。相比之下，氧化还原不活性催化剂如CeO2和过渡金属簇依赖于外部氧化剂来激活CO2。例如，V2O5、VOx/SiO2和过渡金属簇可以有效地激活CO2用于丙烷的氧化脱氢，这从CO2分解的能量壁垒被催化活性克服可以看出。然而，有效性基于特定催化剂及其CO2激活机制的不同而变化，通常涉及形成促进脱氢反应的中间物种。

In the study, infrared (IR) spectroscopy and theoretical approaches were employed to identify the structure of carbon dioxide (CO2) species adsorbed on magnesium oxide (MgO) surfaces. DRIFT (Diffuse Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy was utilized to monitor the interaction of CO2 with the MgO powder sample prepared through precipitation. The stability of carbonate species was also calculated as a function of temperature using a thermodynamic model. The research revealed that the most effective site for CO2 adsorption, a Lewis acid, differs from the site with the highest Brnsted basicity, which is crucial for deprotonation reactions.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study investigates the interaction of CO2 with MgO surfaces, including regular sites and defects like steps, corners, kinks, and divacancies. Density functional theory (DFT) is used to analyze the stability of carbonate species at different temperatures. The research reveals that the most effective site for CO2 interaction differs from the site that best facilitates Brnsted base deprotonation. The availability and nature of basic sites after a pretreatment step significantly impact the catalytic properties of basic catalysts. Accurately characterizing these sites is essential for interpreting catalytic outcomes.

This study uses a combination of experimental infrared (IR) spectroscopy and theoretical density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the adsorption of CO2 on magnesium oxide (MgO) surfaces. The research aims to understand the nature of basic sites available on MgO surfaces after pretreatment processes. It reveals that the most active site for CO2, a Lewis acid, is different from the strongest site for Brnsted acid deprotonation. This indicates that Lewis and Brnsted basic sites on MgO surfaces have distinct strengths despite being of the same nature. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the catalytic properties of basic catalysts related to pretreatment conditions.
