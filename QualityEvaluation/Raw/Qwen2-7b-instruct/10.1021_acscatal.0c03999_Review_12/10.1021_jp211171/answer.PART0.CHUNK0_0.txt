[1] "In order to understand the catalytic properties of the basic catalysts linked to the pretreatment conditions, it is important to be able to characterize the adsorbates remaining on the surface before the catalytic reaction and, as a consequence, to know which basic sites are available after the thermal treatment."
[2] "Analyzing the nature of basic sites, the results show that the most active site versus CO2, which is a Lewis acid, is not the same as the strongest site for the deprotonating adsorption of Brnsted acids."
[3] "Thus, even of the same nature, Lewis and Brnsted basic sites differ by their basicity strength scale."

The document discusses the importance of characterizing adsorbates and basic sites on catalyst surfaces before and after thermal treatments. It highlights that the most active site for adsorbing a Lewis acid like CO2 is not necessarily the same as the strongest site for deprotonating Brnsted acids. The basicity strength scales differ between Lewis and Brnsted sites, even if they share the same nature.

文档讨论了在热处理前后表征催化剂表面吸附物和活性位点的重要性。它强调，对于Lewis酸如CO2来说，最活跃的吸附位点并不一定与最强的Brnsted酸脱质子吸附位点相同。Lewis基团和Brnsted基团的碱性强度尺度存在差异，即使它们具有相同的性质也是如此。
