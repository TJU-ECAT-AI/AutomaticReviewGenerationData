The study investigates the interaction of CO2 with MgO surfaces, including regular sites and defects like steps, corners, kinks, and divacancies. Density functional theory (DFT) is used to analyze the stability of carbonate species at different temperatures. The research reveals that the most effective site for CO2 interaction differs from the site that best facilitates Brnsted base deprotonation. The availability and nature of basic sites after a pretreatment step significantly impact the catalytic properties of basic catalysts. Accurately characterizing these sites is essential for interpreting catalytic outcomes.

研究考察了MgO表面与CO2的相互作用，包括常规位点和边缘、角、突起和空位等缺陷。通过密度泛函理论（DFT）分析了不同温度下碳酸盐物种的稳定性。研究发现，CO2相互作用最有效的位点与促进Brnsted基团脱质子化的最强位点不同。处理步骤后基本位点的可用性和性质对基本催化剂的催化性能有重大影响。准确表征这些位点对于解释催化结果至关重要。
