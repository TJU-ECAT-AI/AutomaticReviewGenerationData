[1] "The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes have been compared for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts."
[2] "In the case of redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, the process involves the reduction of oxygen to form a surface oxide, which then facilitates the activation of C-H bonds and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes."
[3] "For redox-inactive catalysts, like CeO2, the activation of C-H bonds occurs through a different mechanism, often involving the direct interaction of alkane molecules with the surface of the catalyst."
[4] "Transition metal clusters also play a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly in the activation of CO2 for this process."
[5] "The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been studied, focusing on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation."
[6] "In general, redox-active catalysts tend to offer higher selectivity and efficiency due to their ability to reversibly change oxidation states, facilitating the desired chemical transformations."
[7] "Redox-inactive catalysts, while less efficient, can still be effective under certain conditions, particularly when tailored for specific alkane dehydrogenation processes."
[8] "Transition metal clusters, with their unique electronic properties, provide an alternative route for CO2 activation and oxidative dehydrogenation, offering potential improvements in both selectivity and yield."
[9] "Traditional oxidants play a critical role in these reactions by providing the necessary reactive oxygen species that drive the dehydrogenation and CO2 activation processes."

比较了在烷烃氧化脱氢中，活性氧化物催化剂（如V2O5和VOx/SiO2）通过还原氧气形成表面氧化物来激活C-H键并促进烷烃氧化脱氢的过程。不活泼氧化物催化剂（如CeO2）通过直接与催化剂表面相互作用来激活C-H键。过渡金属簇也对烷烃氧化脱氢起着关键作用，特别是对于CO2激活过程。传统的氧化剂在这些反应中起着至关重要的作用，提供必要的活性氧物种，驱动脱氢和CO2激活过程。
