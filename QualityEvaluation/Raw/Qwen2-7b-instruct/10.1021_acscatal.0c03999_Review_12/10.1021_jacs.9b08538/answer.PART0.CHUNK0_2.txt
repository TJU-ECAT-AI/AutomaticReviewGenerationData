The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes vary between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, exemplified by V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, efficiently activate CO2 through redox reactions, whereas redox-inactive catalysts, like CeO2, may utilize different pathways for CO2 activation. Transition metal clusters offer additional potential for CO2 activation due to their unique electronic properties. Traditional oxidants are integral to the oxidative dehydrogenation process, facilitating the activation of C-H bonds. CO2 serves as a feedstock for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, requiring specific energy barriers and mechanisms for its dissociation, which differ across various catalysts.
