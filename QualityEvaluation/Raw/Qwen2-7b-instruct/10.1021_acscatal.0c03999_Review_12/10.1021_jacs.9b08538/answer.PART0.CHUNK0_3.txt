Comparing the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, redox-active metal oxides like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are more effective than redox-inactive ones such as CeO2 for this process. Redox-active catalysts can efficiently activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation due to their ability to lower the activation energy barrier for CO2 dissociation. Traditional oxidants contribute significantly to the reactivity of these catalysts. Transition metal clusters also demonstrate high efficiency in CO2 reduction reactions. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies based on their specific properties and the energy barriers they can overcome.

比较在烷烃氧化脱氢过程中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机制，具有还原活性的金属氧化物如V2O5和VOx/SiO2对于此过程更为有效，而无还原活性的金属氧化物如CeO2则表现出较低的活性。具有还原活性的催化剂能够有效地激活CO2进行氧化脱氢，主要原因是它们能够降低CO2解离的活化能壁垒。传统氧化剂对增强催化剂对CO2的反应性起着关键作用。过渡金属簇也显示出在CO2减少反应中的高效率。不同催化剂在激活CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性取决于它们的特定性质及其能够克服的能量壁垒。
