<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes vary significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 facilitate both the reduction of CO2 and the oxidation of alkane molecules through redox reactions, which can lead to more efficient activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 might require additional reductants for CO2 reduction, resulting in a separate step before the oxidative dehydrogenation process begins. Transition metal clusters could offer a compromise, potentially providing a single-step mechanism for CO2 activation and alkane oxidation due to their ability to act as both oxidants and reductants. Traditional oxidants play a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, often functioning alongside the catalysts to drive the reaction forward. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are an important consideration in these processes, with lower barriers typically indicating higher activation efficiency and thus better performance of the catalysts in transforming CO2 into valuable products.

C-H键活化和催化剂再生在烷烃氧化脱氢中的机制在可氧化还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂与不可氧化还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异。可氧化还原活性催化剂如V2O5和VOx/SiO2通过氧化还原反应同时促进CO2的还原和烷烃分子的氧化，这可能导致更高效的CO2活化以用于丙烷的氧化脱氢。相比之下，CeO2等不可氧化还原活性催化剂可能需要额外的还原剂来实现CO2的还原，导致在开始氧化脱氢过程之前需要一个单独的步骤。过渡金属簇可能提供一种折衷方案，由于它们既能作为氧化剂又能作为还原剂，因此可能提供单步机制来实现CO2激活和烷烃氧化。传统氧化剂在这些过程中发挥着关键作用，通常与催化剂一起驱动反应向前发展。CO2解离的能量壁垒是这些过程的重要考虑因素，较低的壁垒通常表示更高的激活效率，从而更好地实现催化剂将CO2转化为有价值产品的性能。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes vary between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, exemplified by V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, efficiently activate CO2 through redox reactions, whereas redox-inactive catalysts, like CeO2, may utilize different pathways for CO2 activation. Transition metal clusters offer additional potential for CO2 activation due to their unique electronic properties. Traditional oxidants are integral to the oxidative dehydrogenation process, facilitating the activation of C-H bonds. CO2 serves as a feedstock for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, requiring specific energy barriers and mechanisms for its dissociation, which differ across various catalysts.
