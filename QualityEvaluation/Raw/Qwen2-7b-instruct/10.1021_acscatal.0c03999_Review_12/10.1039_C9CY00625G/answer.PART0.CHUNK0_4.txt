[1] "Moderate methane excess simulates the practically relevant operating regime, which strives at full halogen consumption that facilitates the downstream product separation while minimizing the size of the hydrocarbon recycle."
[2] "The conversion of methane, XCH4, the conversion of halogen, XX2, the reaction rate expressed with respect to methane, rCH4, the selectivity to product j, Sj, the space-time yield of carbon oxides, STYCOx, and the error of the carbon mass balance, C, were calculated using eqns (7-12),respectively,"

The catalytic mechanism of CF bond cleavage involves the insights from quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) analysis of fluoroacetate dehalogenase. This enzyme demonstrates the ability to efficiently cleave CF bonds, which is crucial for understanding the biochemical processes involved in dehalogenation reactions. The QM/MM analysis provides a detailed view of the energetics and dynamics of the catalytic process, offering insights into the specific interactions and movements that enable the cleavage of these challenging bonds.

In oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, redox-active metal oxide catalysts such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters play a significant role in activating CO2 for the reaction. Traditional oxidants, like oxygen or air, facilitate the oxidation of alkanes, while CO2 is converted into CO through the action of these catalysts. The effectiveness of different catalysts varies due to their unique properties and the mechanisms they employ to activate CO2. For instance, V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are efficient at converting CO2 into CO, whereas CeO2 can act as a bifunctional catalyst, promoting both the dehydrogenation of alkanes and the conversion of CO2. Transition metal clusters offer tunable properties that can be optimized for specific applications in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on several factors, including the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, the surface chemistry of the catalyst, and the reaction conditions. The proposed mechanisms involve the adsorption of CO2 onto the catalyst surface, followed by the activation of the carbon-oxygen bonds through the assistance of a redox-active site on the catalyst. This activation process allows for the subsequent conversion of CO2 into CO, facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and other alkanes.

The role of traditional oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is to provide the necessary oxygen atoms for the oxidation reactions. In the context of CO2 activation, these oxidants help to create the appropriate chemical environment for the conversion of CO2 into CO. The synergy between the oxidant and the catalyst is crucial for achieving efficient oxidative dehydrogenation, as it ensures the proper activation of both the alkane and CO2 molecules, leading to the desired products.

In summary, the catalytic mechanism of CF bond cleavage in fluoroacetate dehalogenase showcases the importance of QM/MM analysis in elucidating complex biochemical processes. The effectiveness of redox-active metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and CO2 activation is influenced by their unique properties, the energy barriers for reactions, and the synergistic interaction with traditional oxidants.
