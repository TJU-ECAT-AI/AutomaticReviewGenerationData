[1] "The assessment of both methane and halogen conversion in methane chlorination at 523 K indicated that the bed of quartz particles displays an almost identical performance as an empty reactor of the same volume."
[2] "Considering the fact that the effective void volume of the bed is ca. 2 times smaller than that of the empty reactor (bed porosity,   0.4),"
[3] "The activity of quartz particles was comparable to that of an empty reactor, but in contrast to chlorination, methane conversion in bromination was almost unaffected by the catalytic materials."
[4] "In general, the operation under comparable CH4:X2 molar ratios and GHSVs led to a higher fraction of CH3X in bromination compared to chlorination (SCH3Br = 80-95% verusus SCH3Cl = 52-90% at XCH4 = 5-18%)."
[5] "Besides, the selectivity to CH3X declined less steeply upon increasing the methane conversion in the former reaction."
[6] "The conversion of methane and Cl2 over Pt/SiO2, TaOF3/Al2O3, S-ZrO2 and H-SAPO-34 catalysts was ca. 2-2.5 higher compared to quartz, suggesting the further activity promotion over these solids."

The study evaluated the catalytic performance of a wide range of materials in both methane chlorination and bromination under identical conditions. The conversion of both methane and halogen was assessed in methane chlorination at 523 K. The bed of quartz particles showed an almost identical performance to an empty reactor of the same volume, suggesting that the chlorination reaction is promoted even in the presence of inert and low-surface area solids. The conversion of methane and Cl2 over Pt/SiO2, TaOF3/Al2O3, S-ZrO2, and H-SAPO-34 catalysts was approximately 2-2.5 times higher compared to quartz, indicating further activity promotion over these solids. In contrast, the activity of quartz particles was comparable to that of an empty reactor in methane bromination, but the methane conversion was almost unaffected by the catalytic materials. In both reactions, the selectivity to CH3X declined less steeply in the bromination reaction, suggesting a higher inherent propensity for selective monohalogenation. The performance trends were generalized across a broad spectrum of materials, categorized into four distinct groups: supports, metal-based materials, sulfurated oxides, and zeolites.

该研究评估了大量材料在氯化甲烷和溴化甲烷下的催化性能，所有条件相同。在523 K下进行甲烷氯化时，石英颗粒床的转化率与相同体积的空反应器几乎相同，表明即使在存在惰性和低比表面积固体的情况下，氯化反应也能得到促进。铂/二氧化硅、TaOF3/氧化铝、S-ZrO2和H-SAPO-34催化剂上甲烷和Cl2的转化率与石英相比约高2-2.5倍，这表明这些固体的进一步活性提升。然而，在甲烷溴化中，石英颗粒的活性与空反应器相当，但催化剂材料对甲烷转化几乎没有影响。在两种反应中，随着甲烷转化率的增加，前者选择性制备CH3X的下降幅度较小，这表明更高的选择性单卤代物合成的内在倾向。通过将性能趋势推广到一系列广泛的材料，这些材料被分为四个不同的类别：支撑材料、金属基材料、硫化氧化物和沸石。
