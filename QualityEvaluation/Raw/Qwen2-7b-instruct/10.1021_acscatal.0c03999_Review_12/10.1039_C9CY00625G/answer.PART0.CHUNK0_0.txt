[1] "Still, the conversion of bromine was higher over the catalysts, especially H-SAPO-34, which can be associated with a more pronounced polybromination, oxidation and reactions with a catalyst (vide infra)."
[2] "In addition to the conversion profiles, the differences in the selectivity to CH3X were evaluated as another indicator of the potential catalytic effects (Fig 3b)."
[3] "In order to generalize the performance trends, the analysis was extended to a significantly broader range of the materials which can be classified into four distinct groups, supports, metal-based materials, sulphated oxides and zeolites."
[4] "These are composed of the top semicircle, which provides the information of the catalyst activity and the bottom semicircle, which outlines the product distribution patterns."

The literature discusses the catalytic mechanism of CF bond cleavage, focusing on the QM/MM analysis of fluoroacetate dehalogenase. It introduces performance maps for a large library of materials used in the chlorination and bromination of methane under practical conditions. The study aims to understand the nature of catalytic effects related to the catalyst and halogen choice. The analysis covers various materials including carriers, noble metals, metal oxides, chlorides, oxyflourides, sulfated systems, and zeolites. The performance trends are visualized in circular plots, where the top semicircle represents catalyst activity and the bottom semicircle shows product distribution patterns. The semicircles are further divided into sectors to compare different families of materials. The literature does not specifically address oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts or the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
