[1] "The assessment of both methane and halogen conversion in methane chlorination at 523 K indicated that the bed of quartz particles displays an almost identical performance as an empty reactor of the same volume."
[2] "Considering the fact that the effective void volume of the bed is ca. 2 times smaller than that of the empty reactor (bed porosity,   0.4),"
[3] "The conversion of methane and Cl2 over Pt/SiO2, TaOF3/Al2O3, S-ZrO2 and H-SAPO-34 catalysts was ca. 2-2.5 higher compared to quartz, suggesting the further activity promotion over these solids."
[4] "The onset of methane bromination was shifted to ca. 120 K higher temperature with respect to chlorination."
[5] "The activity of quartz particles was comparable to that of an empty reactor, but in contrast to chlorination, methane conversion in bromination was almost unaffected by the catalytic materials."
[6] "Still, the conversion of bromine was higher over the catalysts, especially H-SAPO-34, which can be associated with a more pronounced polybromination, oxidation and reactions with a catalyst (vide infra)."
[7] "In general, the operation under comparable CH4:X2 molar ratios and GHSVs led to a higher fraction of CH3X in bromination compared to chlorination (SCH3Br = 80-95% verusus SCH3Cl = 52-90% at XCH4 = 5-18%)."
[8] "Besides, the selectivity to CH3X declined less steeply upon increasing the methane conversion in the former reaction, corroborating the higher inherent propensity to selective monohalogenation in the former reaction."
[9] "Nevertheless, the selectivity to CH3X in both reactions decreased in the similar order, empty reactor  quartz  Pt/SiO2 > TaOF3/Al2O3  S-ZrO2 > H-SAPO-34, indicating the prominent impact of the catalyst on the product distribution."

The comparison and contrast of the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts involves understanding the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. For instance, V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 catalysts are redox-active, meaning they undergo reversible oxidation-reduction reactions to activate CO2. On the other hand, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 do not undergo such reactions, and their activation of CO2 requires external oxidants. Transition metal clusters can also be effective in dehydrogenating propane, as they can facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds and the activation of CO2 through surface adsorption and subsequent catalytic reactions. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary among these catalysts, influencing their efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

氧化脱氢反应中，烷烃的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制的比较与对比涉及传统氧化剂和二氧化碳的作用。不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中的二氧化碳活化效率取决于二氧化碳分解的提议机制和能量壁垒。例如，V2O5和VOx/SiO2催化剂是可逆氧化还原反应的活性催化剂，能够活化二氧化碳。另一方面，如铈氧化物等非氧化性催化剂不会经历这样的反应，它们需要外部氧化剂来激活二氧化碳。过渡金属簇也可以有效于脱氢丙烷，因为它们可以通过表面吸附和随后的催化反应来促进C-H键断裂和二氧化碳活化。二氧化碳分解的能量壁垒在这些催化剂之间有所不同，影响着氧化脱氢过程的效率。
