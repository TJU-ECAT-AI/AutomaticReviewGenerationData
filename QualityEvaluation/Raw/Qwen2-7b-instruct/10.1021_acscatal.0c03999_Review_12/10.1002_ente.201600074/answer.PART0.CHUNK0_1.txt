The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane using a chemical-looping approach involves a cyclic redox process where an oxide-based catalyst selectively combusts hydrogen derived from ethane dehydrogenation. This catalyst facilitates the conversion of ethane into ethylene. The efficiency of ethane conversion and ethylene yield is enhanced through the in-situ oxidation of hydrogen, which also compensates for the heat required in the ODH process by re-oxidizing the oxygen-deprived redox catalyst. This enables an auto-thermal operation for the overall process. The study investigates the use of silica and magnesia-supported manganese oxides as redox catalysts. It was found that unpromoted Mn/SiO2 and Mn/MgO catalysts show low selectivity for ethylene production. However, the introduction of promoters like sodium and tungsten improves the activity, selectivity, oxygen-carrying capacity, and redox stability of these catalysts.

氧化脱氢化（ODH）使用化学循环方法涉及一个循环还原过程，其中基于氧化物的催化剂选择性地燃烧从乙烷脱氢产生的氢。该催化剂促进乙烷转化为乙烯。通过原位氧化氢来增强乙烷转化率和乙烯产率。同时，这也补偿了ODH过程中所需的热量，通过重新氧化氧气剥夺的还原催化剂来实现这一目标。这使得整个过程能够自我热运行。研究调查了二氧化硅和镁支持的锰氧化物作为还原催化剂的应用。研究发现，未促进的Mn/SiO2和Mn/MgO催化剂对乙烯生产的选择性较低。然而，引入钠和钨等促进剂可以提高这些催化剂的活性、选择性、氧携带能力和氧化稳定性。
