The current study investigates a chemical-looping-based oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) concept for ethane-to-ethylene conversion.
Silica and magnesia-supported manganese oxides are investigated.
It is determined that unpromoted Mn/SiO2 and Mn/MgO redox catalysts exhibit low selectivity towards ethylene.
The addition of promoters such as sodium and tungsten renders effective redox catalysts with satisfactory activity, selectivity, oxygen carrying capacity, and redox stability.

This research explores a chemical-looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) method for converting ethane into ethylene. The scientists examine silica and magnesia-supported manganese oxides as catalysts. They find that unenhanced Mn/SiO2 and Mn/MgO catalysts have poor selectivity for ethylene production. However, adding promoters like sodium and tungsten improves the catalysts' activity, selectivity, oxygen transport capability, and redox stability.
