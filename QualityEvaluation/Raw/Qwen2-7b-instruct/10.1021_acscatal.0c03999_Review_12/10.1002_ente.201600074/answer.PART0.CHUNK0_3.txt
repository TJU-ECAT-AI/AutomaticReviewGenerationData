Silica and magnesia-supported manganese oxides are investigated. It is determined that unpromoted Mn/SiO2 and Mn/MgO redox catalysts exhibit low selectivity towards ethylene. The addition of promoters such as sodium and tungsten renders effective redox catalysts with satisfactory activity, selectivity, oxygen carrying capacity, and redox stability.

The chemical-looping-based oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) concept uses an oxide-based redox catalyst to selectively combust hydrogen from ethane dehydrogenation. The hydrogen product limits ethane conversion, and in situ oxidation of hydrogen enhances the ethane conversion and ethylene yield. Heat required in ODH is compensated by re-oxidation of the oxygen-deprived redox catalyst, enabling auto-thermal operation for the overall process.

Silica and magnesia-supported manganese oxides were studied, revealing that unpromoted Mn/SiO2 and Mn/MgO redox catalysts have low selectivity for ethylene. The introduction of promoters like sodium and tungsten results in efficient redox catalysts with adequate activity, selectivity, oxygen transport capability, and redox stability.
