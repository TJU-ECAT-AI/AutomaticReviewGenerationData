Silica and magnesia-supported manganese oxides are investigated. It is determined that unpromoted Mn/SiO2 and Mn/MgO redox catalysts exhibit low selectivity towards ethylene.
The addition of promoters such as sodium and tungsten renders effective redox catalysts with satisfactory activity, selectivity, oxygen carrying capacity, and redox stability.
Compared to steam cracking, CL-ODH can potentially achieve higher efficiency with lower CO2 and NOx emissions.

In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using a chemical-looping approach, silica and magnesia-supported manganese oxides were studied. Unpromoted Mn/SiO2 and Mn/MgO redox catalysts showed low selectivity for ethylene production. However, by adding promoters like sodium and tungsten, effective redox catalysts were developed that demonstrated satisfactory activity, selectivity, oxygen carrying capacity, and redox stability. This CL-ODH method has the potential to offer higher efficiency than steam cracking with reduced CO2 and NOx emissions.

在基于化学循环的乙烷氧化脱氢的研究中，研究了二氧化硅和镁支持的锰氧化物。未促进的Mn/SiO2和Mn/MgO还原催化剂显示出对乙烯生成的低选择性。然而，通过添加钠和钨等促进剂，开发出了有效且具有满意活性、选择性和氧携带能力以及循环稳定性还原催化剂。这种CL-ODH方法有可能提供比蒸汽裂解更高的效率，并减少二氧化碳和氮氧化物排放。
