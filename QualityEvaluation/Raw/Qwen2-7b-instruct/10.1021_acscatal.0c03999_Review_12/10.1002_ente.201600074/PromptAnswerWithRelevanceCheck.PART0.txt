The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane employs a cyclic redox mechanism where an oxide-based catalyst selectively combusts hydrogen derived from ethane dehydrogenation. This process enhances ethane conversion and ethylene yield by oxidizing hydrogen in situ. Compared to steam cracking, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) may offer higher efficiency with reduced CO2 and NOx emissions. In this study, silica and magnesia-supported manganese oxides were examined. Without promoters, Mn/SiO2 and Mn/MgO catalysts showed low selectivity for ethylene production. Incorporating promoters like sodium and tungsten improved the catalysts' activity, selectivity, oxygen carrying capacity, and redox stability.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane using a chemical-looping approach involves a cyclic redox process where an oxide-based catalyst selectively combusts hydrogen derived from ethane dehydrogenation. This catalyst facilitates the conversion of ethane into ethylene. The efficiency of ethane conversion and ethylene yield is enhanced through the in-situ oxidation of hydrogen, which also compensates for the heat required in the ODH process by re-oxidizing the oxygen-deprived redox catalyst. This enables an auto-thermal operation for the overall process. The study investigates the use of silica and magnesia-supported manganese oxides as redox catalysts. It was found that unpromoted Mn/SiO2 and Mn/MgO catalysts show low selectivity for ethylene production. However, the introduction of promoters like sodium and tungsten improves the activity, selectivity, oxygen-carrying capacity, and redox stability of these catalysts.
