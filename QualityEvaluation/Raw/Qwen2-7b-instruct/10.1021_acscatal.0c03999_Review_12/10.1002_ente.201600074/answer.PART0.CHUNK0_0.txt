The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane employs a cyclic redox mechanism where an oxide-based catalyst selectively combusts hydrogen derived from ethane dehydrogenation. This process enhances ethane conversion and ethylene yield by oxidizing hydrogen in situ. Compared to steam cracking, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) may offer higher efficiency with reduced CO2 and NOx emissions. In this study, silica and magnesia-supported manganese oxides were examined. Without promoters, Mn/SiO2 and Mn/MgO catalysts showed low selectivity for ethylene production. Incorporating promoters like sodium and tungsten improved the catalysts' activity, selectivity, oxygen carrying capacity, and redox stability.

氧化脱氢化（ODH）中的乙烷利用循环还原机制，其中基于氧化物的催化剂选择性地燃烧来自乙烷脱氢的氢。通过原位氧化氢，此过程增强了乙烷转化率和乙烯产率。与蒸汽裂解相比，化学循环氧化脱氢（CL-ODH）可能具有更高的效率并减少CO2和NOx排放。本研究考察了二氧化硅和镁支持的锰氧化物。没有促进剂，Mn/SiO2和Mn/MgO催化剂对乙烯生产的选择性较低。引入钠和钨等促进剂提高了催化剂的活性、选择性、氧携带能力和可逆稳定性。
