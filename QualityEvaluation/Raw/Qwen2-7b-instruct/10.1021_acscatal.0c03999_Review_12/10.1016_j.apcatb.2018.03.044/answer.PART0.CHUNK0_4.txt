<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Comparing redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the former, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, are more effective in activating CO2. This is due to their ability to undergo redox reactions, which facilitates the activation of CO2. Redox-inactive metal oxides, like CeO2, and transition metal clusters show lesser effectiveness in CO2 activation. The energy barrier for CO2 dissociation significantly influences the effectiveness of these catalysts. Traditional oxidants and CO2 play crucial roles in this process.

对于烷烃的氧化脱氢，可氧化性金属氧化物（如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2）在激活CO2方面更为有效。这得益于它们能够进行氧化还原反应，从而促进CO2的活化。不可氧化性金属氧化物（如CeO2）和过渡金属簇对CO2激活的效果较弱。CO2分解的能量壁垒显著影响这些催化剂的有效性。传统氧化剂和CO2在这个过程中扮演着关键角色。
