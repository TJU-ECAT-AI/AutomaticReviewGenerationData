The study focuses on the molecular structure and surface chemistry of supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts in the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. It compares the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration for both redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, with an emphasis on their effectiveness in activating CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Different catalysts such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters are discussed in terms of their proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.
