[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves the breaking of C-H bonds to form higher hydrocarbons and hydrogen."
[2] "Redox-active metal oxides, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, are effective in this process due to their ability to act as electron shuttles, facilitating the activation of alkane molecules and the reduction of oxygen."
[3] "Redox-inactive metal oxides, like CeO2, can also participate in oxidative dehydrogenation through a different mechanism, involving the direct activation of alkane molecules by the metal oxide surface."
[4] "Transition metal clusters have been found to be particularly effective in CO2 activation for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, as they lower the energy barrier for CO2 dissociation."
[5] "Catalyst regeneration is crucial for maintaining the efficiency of these catalysts over multiple reaction cycles. This process often involves reoxidation of the metal oxide to its original state, allowing it to regain its activity."
[6] "Traditional oxidants, such as air or oxygen, are commonly used in the regeneration of these catalysts. However, CO2 has also been explored as an alternative oxidant due to its environmental benefits and potential for more efficient regeneration."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Comparing the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, redox-active metal oxides like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are effective due to their electron shuttle ability, which facilitates alkane activation and oxygen reduction. Redox-inactive metal oxides, such as CeO2, can activate alkane molecules directly via a distinct mechanism. Transition metal clusters show promise in CO2 activation for propane oxidative dehydrogenation by reducing the energy barrier for CO2 dissociation. Catalyst regeneration is essential for maintaining catalyst efficiency across multiple cycles, typically involving reoxidation to restore activity. Traditional oxidants, including air or oxygen, are commonly used in regeneration processes, with CO2 being explored as an alternative for its environmental benefits and potential for more efficient regeneration.

比较烷烃氧化脱氢过程中的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制，可氧化性金属氧化物如V2O5和VOx/SiO2因其作为电子穿梭体的能力而有效，这有助于烷烃分子的活化和氧气的还原。非可氧化性金属氧化物，如CeO2，可以通过直接激活烷烃分子的表面机制参与氧化脱氢。过渡金属簇在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中显示出在CO2活化方面的潜力，通过降低CO2分解的能量壁垒。催化剂再生对于保持催化剂在多个反应周期中的效率至关重要，通常涉及重新氧化以恢复其活性。传统的氧化剂，包括空气或氧气，常用于再生过程，而正在探索使用CO2作为替代氧化剂，因为它具有环境效益，并有可能实现更高效的再生。

Comparing redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the former, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, are more effective in activating CO2. This is due to their ability to undergo redox reactions, which facilitates the activation of CO2. Redox-inactive metal oxides, like CeO2, and transition metal clusters show lesser effectiveness in CO2 activation. The energy barrier for CO2 dissociation significantly influences the effectiveness of these catalysts. Traditional oxidants and CO2 play crucial roles in this process.
