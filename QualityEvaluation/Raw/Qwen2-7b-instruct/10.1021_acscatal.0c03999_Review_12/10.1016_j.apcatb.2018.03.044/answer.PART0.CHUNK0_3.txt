The study compares and contrasts the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, focusing on the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. Different catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, are discussed for their ability to activate CO2. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on the specific mechanism of CO2 dissociation and the energy barriers involved.
