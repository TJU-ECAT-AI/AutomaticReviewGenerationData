[1] "The primary aim of this work was to elaborate the na- ture of the active surface site involved in the conversion of methane to benzene over MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts."
[2] "The basic requirements for that center are to activate the methane molecule to produce CH3 and CH2 fragments, to exhibit less activity toward the subsequent decomposition of these CHx species to carbon, and to promote their couplings to ethane and particularly to ethylene."
[3] "Taking into account the high efficiency of the acidic sites of HZSM-5 in the oligomer- ization and cyclization reactions (27, 28), it was envisaged that the transformation of ethylene into benzene is accom- plished on the ZSM-5 surface (1215)."

The study aimed to understand the active surface sites responsible for converting methane to benzene over MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts. The key requirements for these sites include activating methane to form CH3 and CH2 fragments, showing reduced activity towards the subsequent decomposition of these fragments to carbon, and facilitating their coupling to ethane and especially ethylene. It was anticipated that the transformation of ethylene into benzene occurs on the ZSM-5 surface, leveraging the high efficiency of its acidic sites in oligomerization and cyclization reactions.
