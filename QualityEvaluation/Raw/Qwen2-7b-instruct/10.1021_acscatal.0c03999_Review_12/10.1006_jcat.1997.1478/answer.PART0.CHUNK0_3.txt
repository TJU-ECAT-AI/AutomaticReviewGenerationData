[1] "The primary aim of this work was to elaborate the na- ture of the active surface site involved in the conversion of methane to benzene over MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts."
[2] "Taking into account the high efficiency of the acidic sites of HZSM-5 in the oligomer- ization and cyclization reactions (27, 28), it was envisaged that the transformation of ethylene into benzene is accom- plished on the ZSM-5 surface (1215)."
[3] "In all three cases a significant decay in the rate of CH4 reaction and changes in the product distribution were experienced after the initial interaction of methane with the catalysts at high temperature."
[4] "Accordingly, we may assume that the dramatic change in the product distribution following the strong interaction of methane with supported Mo oxides is due to the formation of Mo2C."
[5] "This Mo2C,however, was a commercial product of very low surface area (1.1 m2/g)."
[6] "In this case, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that the high temperature treatment with H2 removes not only the excess carbon, but also a frac- tion of surface carbon of Mo2C, creating very active centers for the subsequent decomposition of CH4."

1. The primary objective of the research was to elucidate the active surface component responsible for converting methane into benzene over MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts. 
2. Considering the high efficiency of the acidic sites of HZSM-5 in oligomerization and cyclization reactions, the transformation of ethylene into benzene was anticipated to occur on the ZSM-5 surface.
3. After the initial interaction of methane with catalysts at high temperature, there was a notable decline in the reaction rate and changes in product distribution.
4. The researchers might assume that the significant change in product distribution following the strong interaction of methane with supported Mo oxides is due to the formation of Mo2C.
5. The commercially available Mo2C had a very low surface area (1.1 m2/g).
6. In the case of the high-temperature treatment with H2, it might not only remove excess carbon but also a portion of the surface carbon of Mo2C, creating highly active centers for the subsequent decomposition of CH4.

1. 研究的主要目标是阐明在MoO3/ZSM-5催化剂上将甲烷转化为苯的活性表面位点。
2. 考虑到HZSM-5酸性位点在缩合和环化反应中的高效率，乙烯转化为苯预计在ZSM-5表面上发生。
3. 在甲烷与催化剂在高温下的初始反应后，反应速率显著下降，并且产物分布发生变化。
4. 研究人员可能认为，支持的Mo氧化物强烈与甲烷反应后产品分布的重大变化，是由Mo2C的形成导致的。
5. 商业Mo2C的表面积非常低（1.1 m2/g）。
6. 高温H2处理不仅可能去除多余的碳，也可能去除Mo2C表面的一部分碳，从而产生高度活跃的中心进行后续的CH4分解。
