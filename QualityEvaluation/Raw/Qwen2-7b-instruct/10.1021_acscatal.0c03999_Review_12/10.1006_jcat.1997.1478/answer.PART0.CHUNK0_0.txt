[1] "MoO3 and MoO2 interact strongly with methane at 973 K to give H2O and CO2 with trace amounts of ethylene and ethane."
[2] "The reaction of methane on metallic Mo produces H2 with a very small amount of ethane."
[3] "Mixing of these compounds with ZSM-5 changes the product distribution, and the formation of ethylene, ethane, and benzene comes into prominence."
[4] "Unsupported Mo2C and MoC(1x) catalyzed the decomposition of methane to hydrogen, carbon, and to a minor amount of ethane."
[5] "Preparation of Mo2C on ZSM-5 in high dispersion produced catalyst which is active and selective in the aromatization of methane (selectivity to benzene is 80-85% at a conversion of 6.0-7.0%)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. MoO3 and MoO2 react strongly with methane at 973 K, producing H2O and CO2 along with trace amounts of ethylene and ethane. 
2. When methane interacts with metallic Mo, it yields H2 with a minimal amount of ethane. 
3. Combining these compounds with ZSM-5 shifts the product profile, leading to the formation of ethylene, ethane, and benzene.
4. Unsupported Mo2C and MoC(1x) facilitate methane decomposition into hydrogen, carbon, and a small amount of ethane.  
5. Depositing Mo2C on ZSM-5 in a dispersed state creates an efficient catalyst for methane aromatization, achieving a benzene selectivity of 80-85% at a 6.0-7.0% conversion rate.

1. MoO3和MoO2在973 K下与甲烷强烈反应，产生H2O和CO2以及微量的乙烯和乙烷。
2. 当甲烷与金属Mo相互作用时，会产生H2，伴随少量的乙烷。
3. 将这些化合物与ZSM-5混合会改变产物分布，形成乙烷、乙烯和苯。
4. 不支持的Mo2C和MoC(1x)促进甲烷分解为氢气、碳以及少量的乙烷。  
5. 在ZSM-5上分散沉积Mo2C形成高效催化剂，用于甲烷的芳香化，苯的选择性达到80-85%，转化率为6.0-7.0%。
