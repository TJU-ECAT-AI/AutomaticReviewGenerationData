[1] "MoO3 and MoO2 interact strongly with methane at 973 K to give H2O and CO2 with trace amounts of ethylene and ethane. The reaction of methane on metallic Mo produces H2 with a very small amount of ethane."
[2] "Mixing of these compounds with ZSM-5 changes the product distribution, and the formation of ethylene, ethane, and benzene comes into prominence. High selectivity to benzene was attained when these Mo compounds were dispersed on ZSM-5."
[3] "XPS results suggest that the major part of molybdenum metal and oxides are transformed into Mo carbides during the high temperature reaction with methane."
[4] "Unsupported Mo2C and MoC(1x) catalyzed the decomposition of methane to hydrogen, carbon, and to a minor amount of ethane."
[5] "Preparation of Mo2C on ZSM-5 in high dispersion produced catalyst which is active and selective in the aromatization of methane (selectivity to benzene is 80-85% at a conversion of 6.0-7.0%). It appears that Mo2C is responsible for the production of ethylene from methane which is converted to benzene on the acidic sites of the ZSM-5 support."

1. Molybdenum oxides (MoO3 and MoO2) react with methane at 973 K, producing water, carbon dioxide, trace amounts of ethylene, and ethane. Methane reacting with metallic molybdenum yields hydrogen with a small amount of ethane. 
2. Mixing these oxides with ZSM-5 catalyst shifts the product distribution towards the formation of ethylene, ethane, and benzene. High selectivity for benzene is achieved when dispersed on ZSM-5.
3. XPS analysis indicates that molybdenum metal and oxides transform into molybdenum carbides during the methane reaction at high temperatures.
4. Unsupported molybdenum carbides (Mo2C) and related compounds decompose methane into hydrogen, carbon, and a small amount of ethane.
5. Preparing molybdenum carbides on ZSM-5 in a high dispersion state creates an active and selective catalyst for methane aromatization, yielding benzene with a selectivity of 80-85% at a 6.0-7.0% methane conversion. Mo2C is responsible for converting methane into ethylene, which is then converted to benzene on the ZSM-5 support's acidic sites.

1. 在973 K时，钼氧化物（MoO3和MoO2）与甲烷反应，产生水、二氧化碳、微量乙烯和乙烷。钼金属与甲烷反应生成氢气和少量乙烷。
2. 将这些氧化物与ZSM-5催化剂混合改变产物分布，形成乙烯、乙烷和苯。在ZSM-5上分散时，可以获得高苯选择性。
3. XPS分析表明，在高温下，钼金属和氧化物转化为钼碳化物。
4. 未支持的钼碳化物（Mo2C）及其相关化合物分解甲烷为氢气、碳和少量乙烷。
5. 在ZSM-5上以高分散状态制备钼碳化物产生一种活性和选择性催化剂，用于甲烷芳香化，苯的选择性达到80-85%，转化率为6.0-7.0%。Mo2C负责将甲烷转化为乙烯，然后在ZSM-5支持的酸性位点上将其转化为苯。
