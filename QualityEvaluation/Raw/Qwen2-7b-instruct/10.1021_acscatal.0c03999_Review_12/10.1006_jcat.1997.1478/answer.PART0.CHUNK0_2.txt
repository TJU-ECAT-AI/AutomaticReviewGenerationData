[1] "The primary aim of this work was to elaborate the na- ture of the active surface site involved in the conversion of methane to benzene over MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts."
[2] "The basic requirements for that center are to activate the methane molecule to produce CH3 and CH2 fragments, to exhibit less activity toward the subsequent decomposition of these CHx species to carbon, and to promote their couplings to ethane and particularly to ethylene."
[3] "Taking into account the high efficiency of the acidic sites of HZSM-5 in the oligomer- ization and cyclization reactions (27, 28), it was envisaged that the transformation of ethylene into benzene is accom- plished on the ZSM-5 surface (1215)."

The study aimed to understand the active surface sites responsible for converting methane to benzene over MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts. The key requirements for these sites include activating methane to form CH3 and CH2 fragments, showing reduced activity towards the subsequent decomposition of these fragments to carbon, and facilitating their coupling to ethane and especially ethylene. It was anticipated that the transformation of ethylene into benzene occurs on the ZSM-5 surface, leveraging the high efficiency of its acidic sites in oligomerization and cyclization reactions.

这项研究旨在理解在MoO3/ZSM-5催化剂上将甲烷转化为苯的活性表面位点。这些位点的关键要求包括激活甲烷生成CH3和CH2碎片，显示对随后分解为碳的这些碎片的较低活性，并促进它们与乙烷尤其是乙烯的耦合。预计乙烯转化为苯在ZSM-5表面上发生，利用其在缩聚和环化反应中高效酸性位点的特性。

[1] "MoO3 and MoO2 interact strongly with methane at
973 K to give H2O and CO2 with trace amounts of ethylene and ethane."
[2] "The reaction of methane on metallic Mo produces H2 with a very small amount of ethane."
[3] "Mixing of these compounds with ZSM-5 changes the product distribution, and the formation of ethylene, ethane,and benzene comes into prominence."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
At 973 K, MoO3 and MoO2 strongly react with methane to produce H2O and CO2 along with minor amounts of ethylene and ethane. Reacting methane with metallic Mo results in H2 with a tiny amount of ethane. Mixing these compounds with ZSM-5 alters the product distribution, with the formation of ethylene, ethane, and benzene becoming prominent.
