1. The main goal of this research was to understand the active surface component responsible for converting methane to benzene on MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts.
2. Unsupported MoO3 and MoO2 strongly interact with methane at 973 K, resulting in the production of H2O and CO2 with trace amounts of ethylene and ethane.
3. When these compounds are mixed with ZSM-5, the product distribution changes, and the formation of ethylene, ethane, and benzene becomes prominent.
4. XPS data suggests that most of the molybdenum metal and oxides are transformed into Mo carbides during the high-temperature reaction with methane.
5. Unsupported Mo2C and MoC(1x) catalyze the decomposition of methane into hydrogen, carbon, and a small amount of ethane.
6. Preparing Mo2C on ZSM-5 in a highly dispersed state produces an active and selective catalyst for the aromatization of methane, with a benzene selectivity of 80-85% at a 6.0-7.0% conversion.

1. 这项工作的主要目标是阐明在MoO3/ZSM-5催化剂上将甲烷转化为苯的活性表面位点。
2. 不支持的MoO3和MoO2在973 K时强烈与甲烷相互作用，产生H2O、CO2以及少量的乙烯和乙烷。
3. 当这些化合物与ZSM-5混合时，产物分布发生变化，形成了乙烷、乙烯和苯的形成。
4. XPS数据表明，在高温度下与甲烷反应期间，大部分钼金属和氧化物被转化为Mo碳化物。
5. 不支持的Mo2C和MoC(1x)催化甲烷分解为氢、碳以及少量的乙烷。
6. 在ZSM-5上以高度分散状态制备的Mo2C成为活性和选择性催化剂，用于甲烷的芳香化，苯的选择性为80-85%，转化率为6.0-7.0%。
