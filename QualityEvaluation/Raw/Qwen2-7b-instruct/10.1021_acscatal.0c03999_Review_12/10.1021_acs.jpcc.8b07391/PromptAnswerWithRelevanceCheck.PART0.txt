[1] "The present study aims at linking model studies under UHV conditions with high-performance catalysis in fixed bed reactors by investigating pure polycrystalline CaO as model system in powder form."
[2] "In constant feed mode a gas composition of 6:1:3, He:O2:CH4 was mixed using Bronkhorst mass flow controllers."
[3] "Presence of water and carbon dioxide shift the onset of the reaction to higher temperatures and increase the activation energy significantly to 110 kJ/mol and 150 kJ/mol, respectively."
[4] "It has to be noted, that under the investigated temperatures for OCM (>700C) the conversion of oxygen was always 100% due to metal parts inside the balance (e.g. thermocouples: stainless steel shell,suspension: Pt/Ir alloy)."

The study investigates the use of pure polycrystalline CaO as a model system for catalysis, aiming to connect high-performance catalysis in fixed bed reactors with model studies under ultra-high vacuum conditions. In constant feed mode, the mixture of gases consisted of 6 parts He, 1 part O2, and 3 parts CH4. Water and carbon dioxide lead to a higher activation energy of 110 kJ/mol and 150 kJ/mol, respectively, shifting the onset of the reaction to higher temperatures. For oxygen conversion during OCM at temperatures above 700°C, the conversion was always 100% due to metal parts within the balance, such as thermocouples and the suspension system.

The study focused on understanding the oxygen activation process on the surface of polycrystalline calcium oxide (CaO) under conditions relevant for oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). The research aimed to establish correlations between model studies conducted under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions and practical applications in fixed-bed reactors, using pure polycrystalline CaO as a model catalyst. The activation of oxygen molecules on the CaO surface was found to occur at an activation energy of 80 kJ/mol in its absence, increasing to 110 kJ/mol and 150 kJ/mol when water and carbon dioxide were present, respectively. The oxidative coupling of methane, despite its potential, remains challenging due to an unresolved yield barrier for C2 products, estimated around 30%, that has yet to be overcome.

The study on calcium oxide (CaO) focuses on understanding the oxygen activation process and its relation to the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reactions. The research indicates that the activation of both C-H bonds in methane and the O2 molecule's oxygen-oxygen bond is essential for OCM. The presence of water and carbon dioxide increases the activation energy needed for the oxygen scrambling reaction, shifting its onset to higher temperatures. The study proposes that the same sites responsible for oxygen scrambling and OCM reactions determine the reaction rate, with desorption of CO2 and H2O dictating the pace. Furthermore, in-situ Raman and thermogravimetric experiments confirm the formation of a calcite phase below 750°C, which becomes inactive for both OCM and oxygen scrambling reactions.

The study investigates the oxygen activation process on polycrystalline calcium oxide (CaO) under normal pressure and a wide temperature range, aiming to establish a connection between model studies under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions and high-performance catalysis in fixed bed reactors. The focus is on understanding the reactivity of CaO surfaces, particularly regarding the role of surface hydroxyl groups and carbonate species. The activation energy for oxygen scrambling on the surface of CaO in the absence of other gases is determined to be 80 kJ/mol. The presence of water and carbon dioxide increases the activation energy significantly, shifting the reaction onset to higher temperatures. The study also discusses the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) process, noting its challenges in achieving high yields of C2 products. It is mentioned that the release of methyl radicals can react with oxygen to form undesired oxidation products like CO and CO2, impacting the selectivity of the process. The synthesis of calcium carbonate, a precursor for CaO, is briefly described as a co-precipitation procedure.
