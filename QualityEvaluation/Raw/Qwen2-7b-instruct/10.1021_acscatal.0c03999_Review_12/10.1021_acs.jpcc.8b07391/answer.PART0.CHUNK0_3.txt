1. "An activation energy of 80 kJ/mol was determined for the oxygen scrambling of O2 on the surface of polycrystalline CaO powder in absence of other gases."
2. "Presence of water and carbon dioxide shift the onset of the reaction to higher temperatures and increase the activation energy significantly to 110 kJ/mol and 150 kJ/mol, respectively."
3. "The oxidative coupling of methane is far away from industrial implementation due to an apparent yield barrier for C2 products of about 30% that has yet to be surpassed."
4. "The release of methyl radicals can not only combine, but also react with gaseous oxygen to form methyl peroxy radicals, which are considered as precursors for undesired oxidation products such as CO and CO2."
5. "The present study aims at linking model studies under UHV conditions with high-performance catalysis in fixed bed reactors by investigating pure polycrystalline CaO as model system in powder form."

The study investigates the oxygen activation process on polycrystalline calcium oxide (CaO) under normal pressure and a wide temperature range, aiming to establish a connection between model studies under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions and high-performance catalysis in fixed bed reactors. The focus is on understanding the reactivity of CaO surfaces, particularly regarding the role of surface hydroxyl groups and carbonate species. The activation energy for oxygen scrambling on the surface of CaO in the absence of other gases is determined to be 80 kJ/mol. The presence of water and carbon dioxide increases the activation energy significantly, shifting the reaction onset to higher temperatures. The study also discusses the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) process, noting its challenges in achieving high yields of C2 products. It is mentioned that the release of methyl radicals can react with oxygen to form undesired oxidation products like CO and CO2, impacting the selectivity of the process. The synthesis of calcium carbonate, a precursor for CaO, is briefly described as a co-precipitation procedure.

研究在常压和宽温度范围内对多晶氧化钙（CaO）表面的氧活化过程进行了调查，旨在将UHV条件下的模型研究与固定床反应器中的高性能催化作用联系起来。研究的重点是理解CaO表面的活性，特别是表面羟基团和碳酸盐物种的作用。在没有其他气体的情况下，CaO表面的氧跳跃激活能被确定为80 kJ/mol。水和二氧化碳的存在显著增加了激活能，使反应开始的时间提高到更高的温度。研究还讨论了甲烷氧化耦合（OCM）过程，指出其在达到C2产品高产率方面的挑战。提到释放的甲基自由基可以与氧气反应形成不希望的氧化产物如CO和CO2，影响过程的选择性。简要描述了合成碳酸钙作为CaO前体的沉淀法程序。
