[1] "The present study aims at linking model studies under UHV conditions with high-performance catalysis in fixed bed reactors by investigating pure polycrystalline CaO as model system in powder form."
[2] "In constant feed mode a gas composition of 6:1:3, He:O2:CH4 was mixed using Bronkhorst mass flow controllers."
[3] "Presence of water and carbon dioxide shift the onset of the reaction to higher temperatures and increase the activation energy significantly to 110 kJ/mol and 150 kJ/mol, respectively."
[4] "It has to be noted, that under the investigated temperatures for OCM (>700C) the conversion of oxygen was always 100% due to metal parts inside the balance (e.g. thermocouples: stainless steel shell,suspension: Pt/Ir alloy)."

The study investigates the use of pure polycrystalline CaO as a model system for catalysis, aiming to connect high-performance catalysis in fixed bed reactors with model studies under ultra-high vacuum conditions. In constant feed mode, the mixture of gases consisted of 6 parts He, 1 part O2, and 3 parts CH4. Water and carbon dioxide lead to a higher activation energy of 110 kJ/mol and 150 kJ/mol, respectively, shifting the onset of the reaction to higher temperatures. For oxygen conversion during OCM at temperatures above 700°C, the conversion was always 100% due to metal parts within the balance, such as thermocouples and the suspension system.

研究旨在通过使用纯晶粒CaO作为模型系统，将超高真空条件下的模型研究与固定床反应器中的高性能催化作用联系起来。在恒定供给模式下，混合气体由6份He、1份O2和3份CH4组成。水和二氧化碳导致激活能分别增加至110 kJ/mol和150 kJ/mol，使得反应起始温度升高。对于700°C以上的OCM条件下氧气转化，由于平衡中存在金属部件（如热电偶外壳、Pt/Ir合金悬架），氧气转化率始终为100%。
