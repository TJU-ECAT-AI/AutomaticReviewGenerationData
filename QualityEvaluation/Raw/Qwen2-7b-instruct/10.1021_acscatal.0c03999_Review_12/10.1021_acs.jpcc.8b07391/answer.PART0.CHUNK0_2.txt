The study on calcium oxide (CaO) focuses on understanding the oxygen activation process and its relation to the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reactions. The research indicates that the activation of both C-H bonds in methane and the O2 molecule's oxygen-oxygen bond is essential for OCM. The presence of water and carbon dioxide increases the activation energy needed for the oxygen scrambling reaction, shifting its onset to higher temperatures. The study proposes that the same sites responsible for oxygen scrambling and OCM reactions determine the reaction rate, with desorption of CO2 and H2O dictating the pace. Furthermore, in-situ Raman and thermogravimetric experiments confirm the formation of a calcite phase below 750°C, which becomes inactive for both OCM and oxygen scrambling reactions.

该对钙氧化物（CaO）的研究集中在理解氧激活过程及其与甲烷氧化合物（OCM）反应之间的关系。研究指出，甲烷分子中的C-H键和O2分子的氧-氧键的活化对于OCM至关重要。水和二氧化碳的存在提高了氧气混合反应所需的活化能，使其起始温度升高，并显著增加了激活能量至110 kJ/mol和150 kJ/mol。研究表明，负责氧气混合反应和OCM反应的相同站点决定了反应速率，脱除CO2和H2O决定了速度。此外，原位拉曼和热重分析实验证实，在750°C以下形成的方解石相对于OCM和氧气混合反应都变得无活性。
