ABSTRACT
A pulsed isotope exchange technique was applied to study the oxygen scrambling activity of polycrystalline calcium oxide under temperatures and pressures relevant for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). Oxygen exchange was observed above
400C. The onset was attributed to the removal of impurities on the catalyst surface.
By trapping impurities in the gas feed, the scrambling could already be observed at room temperature. An activation energy of 80 kJ/mol was determined for the oxygen scrambling of O2 on the surface of polycrystalline CaO powder in absence of other gases. Presence of water and carbon dioxide shift the onset of the reaction to higher temperatures and increase the activation energy significantly to 110 kJ/mol and 150 kJ/mol, respectively. The OCM activity could be directly linked to the oxygen scrambling activity of the material in pulsed OCM operation. It is proposed that the same sites are responsible for oxygen scrambling and OCM reaction and that the rate is dictated by desorption of CO2 and H2O. The high reaction temperatures in OCM in case of CaO are only required to regenerate the active sites, which may apply to basic OCM catalysts in general. In-situ Raman and thermogravimetric experiments verified the formation of a bulk calcite phase below 750C, which is inactive in OCM and oxygen scrambling. Above 750C no surface oxygen species or adsorbates were found by Raman spectroscopy suggesting that only surface defects are responsible for catalytic activity of CaO.

1. INTRODUCTION
With methane being one of the most abundant carbon sources, the transformation into more valuable compounds is of high economic interest.1,2 Several options to directly convert methane towards higher hydrocarbons have been investigated,3 one of those being the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), first described in the 80's.4 In the presence of oxygen, methane is converted to ethane and ethylene.Non-reducible oxides such as alkaline earth oxides, often in combination with rare earth oxides, have been studied as promising OCM catalysts. The catalytic performance of such materials appeared to correlate with their basic strength,5,6 however, involving limitations due to stable carbonate formation. In case of alkaline earth oxides, CaO is the most promising candidate, with MgO being less basic, and SrO and BaO forming stable carbonates under reaction conditions.The oxidative coupling of methane requires the activation of C-H bonds in the methane molecule as well as the oxygen-oxygen bond in the O2 molecule. A widely accepted reaction mechanism involves methyl radicals formed by hydrogen abstraction from methane on the catalyst surface, which combine afterwards in the gas phase giving ethane. The reaction has been suggested to take place at O- centers, which can be generated by introducing alkali metal ions into alkaline earth oxides, such as Li, forming [Li+O-] centers.7 However, DFT calculations indicated thermodynamic instability of such centers in a large pressure and temperature window, albeit [Li+O-] centers were not excluded to be formed under non-equilibrium conditions.8 The formation of activated oxygen species on the surface of "pure" alkaline earth oxides has been often correlated to the presence of dopants such as alkali metal ions or transition metal ions present in the material due to intended addition or as Page 3 of 42 ACS Paragon Plus Environment The Journal of Physical Chemistry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 4
impurities.9 In EPR studies on "pure" CaO, Na was found to be involved in the formation of peroxide species at step sites.10 Similarly, surface defects might be important on pure alkaline earth oxides. A structure reactivity correlation indicated atomic step sites to be the active centers on MgO catalysts.11 The oxidative coupling of methane is far away from industrial implementation due to an apparent yield barrier for C2 products of about 30% that has yet to be surpassed.12 However, the presence of oxygen in the gas phase under reaction conditions renders it difficult to achieve high selectivity. The released methyl radicals can not only combine, but also react with gaseous oxygen to form methyl peroxy radicals, which are considered as precursors for undesired oxidation products such as CO and CO2.13 In general, oxygen activation on the surface and the intermediate appearance of activated oxygen species may have a major impact on selectivity.14 In case of CaO, the introduction of anionic vacancies by the addition of Li+ ions into the lattice can improve the oxygen dissociation.15 Even though extensive studies have been made, the oxygen activation on the catalyst surface is still under debate.3,16 Another aspect is the interaction of the byproduct water and side products such as carbon dioxide with the catalyst and the influence of the formation of surface carbonates and hydroxides on oxygen activation. Conflicting results were found concerning the impact of carbon dioxide on the catalytic performance, varying from no impact at all,17,18 to a negative impact on activity18 or a beneficial effect on selectivity19 and even activity.20 The negative effect on activity is mostly explained by stable carbonate formation, which can be neglected at temperatures far above the decomposition temperature that applies to the temperature range in which OCM is usually performed on MgO- and CaO-based systems. The increased selectivity in some cases is attributed to CO2 blocking unselective oxidation sites,19 but lacking definitive proof so far.

In fundamental studies on thin CaO films grown on molybdenum single crystal supports oxygen adsorption was studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) verified by theoretical calculations.21 The adsorption energy for oxygen on a pristine CaO surface was found to be low with 13 kJ/mol and the dissociation barrier was determined to be 110 kJ/mol. The barrier was reduced significantly in presence of high valence dopants in the sub-surface of the CaO film.
The present study aims at linking model studies under UHV conditions with high- performance catalysis in fixed bed reactors by investigating pure polycrystalline CaO as model system in powder form. Oxygen activation and OCM are comparatively studied at normal pressure and over a wide temperature range revealing analogies of the two processes. The impact of surface hydroxyl groups and carbonate species on reactivity will be discussed as well.

2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Synthesis. Calcium carbonate was prepared as a calcium oxide precursor for the measurements by the following co-precipitation procedure. A 10.7 wt% calcium nitrate solution (Ca(NO3)2x4H2O, Fisher Scientific analytical reagent grade, dissolved in appropriate amount of millipore water) and a 8.03 wt% ammonium carbonate solution ((NH4)2CO3, Roth, p.a., dissolved in appropriate amount of millipore water) were simultaneously added over a period of one hour to a 0.74 wt% ammonium carbonate solution at 30C under constant stirring using an automated LabMax reactor (Mettler Toledo). The product was aged in the solution, filtered, washed multiple times with millipore water and dried at 80C for 24 h. For catalytic measurements the resulting powder was pressed at 200 bar, crushed and sieved to yield a sieve fraction of 200-300 m (internal catalyst ID 24254 for catalysis, thermal analysis and elemental analysis, 25763 for ICP, isotopic scrambling and Raman).
Elemental Analysis. ICP-OES measurements were carried out using a Varian ICP-OES 715 ES. For sample preparation 500 mg calcium carbonate were dissolved with 3 ml 69% HNO3 (ROTIPURAN Supra ROTH) and diluted to a total volume of 15 ml with water (VWR, ultrapure, HPLC grade). For calibration, a dilution series of an ICP standard from Sigma-Aldrich was prepared containing 33 elements of the main and first transition metal group elements (Periodic table mix 1 for ICP, TraceCERT). The main impurity was found to be Sr with 150 ppm. Na was found to be below the detection limit of 50 ppm.
Nitrogen adsorption. Surface area determination was carried out using an Autosorb iQ by Quantachrome Instruments, performing an 11 point BET surface area analysis. The sample was activated in a 4 mm inner diameter quartz tube reactor with flowing air (40 ml/min) at 900C for 6 h applying a heating rate of Page 6 of 42 ACS Paragon Plus Environment The Journal of Physical Chemistry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 7
5 C/min. After activation, the feed gas was switched to helium at 900C and cooled down to room temperature. The sample was sealed inside the reactor using a methane-oxygen torch, transferred into a glove box and afterwards filled into the measuring cell.
Catalytic Tests. The catalytic tests in constant as well as pulsed feed were carried out in a 8 mm inner diameter quartz tube reactor equipped with an internal thermocouple positioned inside an inner quartz tube of 2 mm outer diameter. For the tests, 100 mg calcium carbonate (200-300 m) were diluted in 1400 mg of silicon carbide (300-400 m). Prior to the catalytic tests, the carbonate was decomposed at 850C for 6 h in synthetic air (30 ml/min). In constant feed mode a gas composition of
6:1:3, He:O2:CH4 was mixed using Bronkhorst mass flow controllers. In the pulsed
mode the feed was set to 9:1, He:O2 and conducted through a pneumatic 6-port diaphragm valve by Valco VICI equipped with a 1 ml sample loop. Methane was pulsed every 10 min (every 20C) applying this loop. The total gas flow was fixed at 30 ml/min for each experiment. The products were quantitatively analyzed using a GAM 200 mass spectrometer. The conversion in case of constant feed mode was calculated by:) ( ) ( 1 ) ( 4 4 4 Baseline c

XRD Analysis.

MYTHEN 1K position sensitive microstrip solid-state detector. For sample preparation the samples were crushed using a mortar.
Thermogravimetric Analysis. The in situ thermogravimetric experiments were carried out using a DynTHERM magnetic suspension balance (Rubotherm). The effluent gases were qualitatively analyzed using a GAM 200 mass spectrometer. A more detailed description of the setup can be found elsewhere.22 For these experiments 500 mg of calcium carbonate (200-300 m) were placed in the ceramic crucible and decomposed by heating in argon (500 ml/min) with 5 C/min up to
900C. After complete conversion to calcium oxide (mass loss expected from
MCaCO3 = 100.1 g/mol to MCaO = 56.1 g/mol), temperature and feed were varied. For OCM conditions a feed composition of (3:1:3, Ar:O2:CH4) was applied. For buoyancy correction a blank experiment was performed. It has to be noted, that under the investigated temperatures for OCM (>700C) the conversion of oxygen was always 100% due to metal parts inside the balance (e.g. thermocouples: stainless steel shell,suspension: Pt/Ir alloy).
Raman. Raman spectroscopy was carried out using a TriVista TR557 spectrometer (S&I Spectroscopy & Imaging GmbH) equipped with a confocal Raman microscope.
For in situ studies a Linkam CCR-1000 reactor stage was used coupled with a micro GC (Agilent). For the laser source a 532 nm laser was used applying a laser power of
1.30 mW to exclude laser-induced damage. Resolution is dictated by the laser
wavelength and grating used, in this case 600 grooves/mm, which yield a resolution of approximately 1 cm-1. Prior exposure to the feed, 10 mg of calcium carbonate (200-300 m) were placed inside the in situ cell and activated in synthetic air (10 ml/min) at 900C. A feed of 3:1:3, He:O2:CH4 (10 ml/min) was used and the temperatures were varied between 700C and 800C. It has to be noted that due to Page 8 of 42 ACS Paragon Plus Environment The Journal of Physical Chemistry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 9
heated metal parts inside the cell (e.g. thermocouples, heating system), the oxygen conversion above 700C was almost 100%.
