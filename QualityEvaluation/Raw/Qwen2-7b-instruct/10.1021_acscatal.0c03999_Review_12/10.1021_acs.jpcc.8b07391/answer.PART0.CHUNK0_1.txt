[1] "An activation energy of 80 kJ/mol was determined for the oxygen scrambling of O2 on the surface of polycrystalline CaO powder in absence of other gases."
[2] "Presence of water and carbon dioxide shift the onset of the reaction to higher temperatures and increase the activation energy significantly to 110 kJ/mol and 150 kJ/mol, respectively."
[3] "The oxidative coupling of methane is far away from industrial implementation due to an apparent yield barrier for C2 products of about 30% that has yet to be surpassed."
[4] "The present study aims at linking model studies under UHV conditions with high-performance catalysis in fixed bed reactors by investigating pure polycrystalline CaO as model system in powder form."

The study focused on understanding the oxygen activation process on the surface of polycrystalline calcium oxide (CaO) under conditions relevant for oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). The research aimed to establish correlations between model studies conducted under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions and practical applications in fixed-bed reactors, using pure polycrystalline CaO as a model catalyst. The activation of oxygen molecules on the CaO surface was found to occur at an activation energy of 80 kJ/mol in its absence, increasing to 110 kJ/mol and 150 kJ/mol when water and carbon dioxide were present, respectively. The oxidative coupling of methane, despite its potential, remains challenging due to an unresolved yield barrier for C2 products, estimated around 30%, that has yet to be overcome.

该研究专注于在与甲烷氧化耦合（OCM）相关的条件下，钙氧化物（CaO）表面的氧激活过程。研究旨在将UHV条件下的模型研究与固定床反应器中的高性能催化作用联系起来，使用纯多晶CaO作为模型催化剂进行研究。发现在CaO表面缺少其他气体时，氧气分子的激活能量为80 kJ/mol，当水和二氧化碳存在时，激活能量分别增加到110 kJ/mol和150 kJ/mol。尽管甲烷氧化耦合具有潜力，但其工业实施仍面临挑战，主要是由于C2产物的产量壁垒约为30%，这一难题尚未解决。
