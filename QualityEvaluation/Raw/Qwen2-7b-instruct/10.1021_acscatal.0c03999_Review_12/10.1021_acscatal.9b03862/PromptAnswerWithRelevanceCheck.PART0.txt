Answer: In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, redox-active metal oxides such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 facilitate the activation of C-H bonds and catalyst regeneration, whereas redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 and transition metal clusters might not efficiently activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane due to their distinct mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. Traditional oxidants and CO2 play crucial roles in these processes, influencing the effectiveness of different catalysts in CO2 activation and alkane dehydrogenation.

Answer: 红氧化合物如V2O5和VOx/SiO2能够促进烷烃中的C-H键激活和催化剂再生，而像CeO2和过渡金属簇等非红氧化合物可能由于CO2解离的能量壁垒和不同机制，在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中对CO2激活效率较低，影响不同催化剂在CO2激活和烷烃脱氢过程中的效果。传统氧化剂和CO2在这些过程中起着关键作用。
