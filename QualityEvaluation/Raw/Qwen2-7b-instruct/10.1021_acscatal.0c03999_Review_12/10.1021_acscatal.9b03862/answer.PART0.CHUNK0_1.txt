Redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts play distinct roles in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, with their effectiveness influenced by traditional oxidants and CO2. Different catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters vary in their ability to activate CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, based on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.
