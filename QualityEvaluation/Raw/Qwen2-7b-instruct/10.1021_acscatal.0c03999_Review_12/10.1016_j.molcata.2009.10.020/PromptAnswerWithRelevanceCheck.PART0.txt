<p>Based on previous work, the behavior of NO2 in the SCR reaction on the V2O5 surface could follow two reaction routes: (1) NO2 directly reoxidizing V4+OH to V5+ O and (2) NO2 reacting with H2O to produce HNO3, which subsequently reoxidizes V4+OH to V5+O.</p>
<p>The objective of the present study is to elucidate the full sequence of reaction steps including intermediates and transition state geometries, and the energetics of these two reaction routes.</p>
<p>Reactions of the by-product, HNO2, were also investigated. The results showed that both cis-HNO2 (route 1) and trans-HNO2 (route 2) can either react with NH3, producing H2O and N2, or react with themselves, producing H2O, NO and NO2.</p>
<p>The first step of the SCR reaction is the reaction of NH3 and NO on V5+ O, causing a reduction of V5+ O to V4+OH.</p>
<p>NO2 can reoxidize V4+OH via two reaction routes, as discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.</p>
<p>The behavior of NO2 in the reoxidation of V4+OH to V5+O is shown in Fig. 12.</p>

The study focuses on understanding the two primary pathways through which NO2 reoxidizes V4+OH on the V2O5 catalyst surface during the selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxides with ammonia. The two routes involve direct reoxidation of V4+OH by NO2 and the production of HNO3 from NO2 reacting with H2O or NH3, which then reoxidizes V4+OH to V5+O. The study explores the energetics and sequences of reactions for both routes, including the by-products HNO2 and their interactions. It also examines the first step of the SCR reaction, the reduction of V5+O to V4+OH by NH3 and NO, setting the stage for subsequent reoxidation by NO2. The overall behavior of NO2 in facilitating the fast selective catalytic reduction (fast SCR) reaction on the V2O5 surface is summarized in Fig. 12.

研究主要关注NO2在V2O5催化剂表面通过氨选择性催化还原氮氧化物时，对V4+OH进行再氧化的两种主要途径。这两种途径包括直接由NO2再氧化V4+OH和NO2与H2O或NH3反应生成HNO3，随后再氧化V4+OH到V5+O。研究探讨了两条路径的能量和反应序列，包括副产物HNO2及其相互作用。它还考察了SCR反应的第一步，即NH3和NO将V5+O还原为V4+OH，为后续由NO2促进的再氧化铺平道路。图12总结了NO2在V2O5表面快速选择性催化还原反应中的整体行为。

The behavior of NO2 in the selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxides with ammonia on the V2O5 catalyst surface involves two primary routes. Route 1 involves direct reoxidation of V4+OH to V5+O through NO2. Route 2 entails NO2 reacting with H2O or NH3 to produce HNO3, which then reoxidizes V4+OH to V5+O. Route 2 is energetically favored at low temperatures due to a lower activation energy barrier. By-products of the reaction include HNO2, which can either react with NH3 or itself, producing H2O, NO, and NO2. Both cis-HNO2 and trans-HNO2 exhibit similar energy profiles for reactions with NH3 and themselves, suggesting equal likelihood of these pathways on the catalyst surface.

在V2O5催化剂表面，NO2选择性催化还原氮氧化物与氨的反应过程中涉及两条主要途径。途径1通过NO2直接将V4+OH氧化为V5+O。途径2是NO2与H2O或NH3反应生成HNO3，随后HNO3将V4+OH氧化为V5+O。在低温条件下，途径2更具优势，因为其活化能壁垒较低。反应的副产品包括HNO2，它可以与NH3或自身反应，生成H2O、NO和NO2。无论是cis-HNO2还是trans-HNO2，在与NH3或自身的反应中展现出相似的能量图谱，表明在催化剂表面上这些途径发生的可能性相等。

The behavior of NO2 in the selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxides with ammonia on the surface of the V2O5 catalyst can be divided into two main pathways. Firstly, NO2 can directly reoxidize V4+OH to V5+ O. Secondly, NO2 can react with H2O or NH3 to produce HNO3, which then reoxidizes V4+OH to V5+ O. Both routes involve the formation of HNO2 as a byproduct. HNO2 can either react with NH3, producing H2O and N2, or react with itself, producing H2O, NO, and NO2. The overall stoichiometry of the second pathway aligns with the main reaction of the fast selective catalytic reduction (SCR) process. The reaction between two cis-HNO2 molecules has a lower activation energy than the reaction between cis-HNO2 and NH3, suggesting that cis-HNO2 prefers to react with itself under certain conditions.

在V2O5催化剂表面选择性催化还原硝酸盐与氨反应中NO2的行为可以分为两大主要途径。首先，NO2可以直接氧化V4+OH至V5+ O。其次，NO2可以与H2O或NH3反应生成HNO3，随后该HNO3再次氧化V4+OH至V5+ O。两条路径均涉及到HNO2的形成。HNO2可以与NH3反应生成H2O和N2，或者自身反应生成H2O、NO和NO2。第二条路径的整体化学计量与快速选择性催化还原（SCR）过程的主要反应一致。两个cis-HNO2分子之间的反应具有比cis-HNO2与NH3反应更低的活化能，表明在一定条件下，cis-HNO2更倾向于自我反应。

本研究探讨了NO2在V2O5催化剂表面选择性催化还原氮氧化物与氨的行为。NO2可以通过两条途径快速重新氧化V4+OH：（1）NO2直接将V4+OH氧化为V5+ O；（2）NO2与H2O或NH3反应生成HNO3，随后HNO3重新氧化V4+OH为V5+ O。路线1的能量壁垒为9.91 kcal/mol，而路线2的能量壁垒为7.44 kcal/mol，表明在低温下，路线2更为普遍。路线1的副产品cis-HNO2可以与NH3或另一个cis-HNO2反应，两个cis-HNO2反应的能量壁垒为18.40 kcal/mol。cis-HNO2与NH3的反应具有显著更高的能量壁垒。对于副产物trans-HNO2，它将同样与自己反应产生H2O、NO和NO2，或者与NH3反应产生H2O和N2。

The document discusses the behavior of NO2 in the selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxides with ammonia on the surface of a V2O5 catalyst. It identifies two main reaction routes for NO2: direct reoxidation of V4+OH to V5+O and reoxidation through the production of HNO3. In the direct reoxidation, NO2 adsorbs on the cluster, captures a hydrogen from V4+OH, and desorbs as V5+O and cis-HNO2. The reoxidation through HNO3 production involves NO2 reacting with H2O or NH3 to form HNO3, which then reoxidizes V4+OH to V5+O. The reoxidation pathway through HNO3 is favored at lower temperatures due to a lower activation energy. Both cis-HNO2 and trans-HNO2 can react with NH3 to produce H2O and N2 or react with themselves to produce H2O, NO, and NO2. The document provides detailed energy profiles and identifies the rate-determining steps for each reaction route.

文档讨论了NO2在V2O5催化剂表面选择性催化还原硝酸盐与氨的性质。它识别了NO2的两种主要反应途径：直接氧化还原V4+OH为V5+O和通过生成HNO3的氧化还原。在直接氧化还原中，NO2吸附到簇上，捕获V4+OH的氢，并以V5+O和cis-HNO2的形式脱附。通过HNO3产生的氧化还原涉及NO2与H2O或NH3反应形成HNO3，然后进一步氧化还原V4+OH为V5+O。HNO3途径在低温下更占优势，因为其活化能较低。cis-HNO2和trans-HNO2都可以与NH3反应产生H2O和N2，或者自我反应产生H2O、NO和NO2。文档提供了详细的能量轮廓，并确定了每个反应途径的决定步骤。
