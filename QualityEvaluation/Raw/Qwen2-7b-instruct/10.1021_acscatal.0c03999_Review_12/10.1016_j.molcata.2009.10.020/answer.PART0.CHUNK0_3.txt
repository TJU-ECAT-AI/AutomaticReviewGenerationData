<p>The results showed that NO2 could readily reoxidize V4+OH through two reaction routes: (1) NO2 directly reoxidizing V4+OH to V5+ O and (2) NO2 reacting with H2O or NH3 to produce HNO3, which subsequently reoxidizes V4+OH to V5+ O.</p>
<p>Route 1 possesses an energy barrier of 9.91 kcal/mol, being endothermic by 9.91 kcal/mol. Route 2 possesses an activation energy of 7.44 kcal/mol (less than route 1).</p>
<p>The by-product of route 1, cis-HNO2, can either react with NH3 or another cis-HNO2. The reaction of two cis-HNO2 producing H2O, NO and NO2 has an activation energy of 18.40 kcal/mol, while the reaction between cis-HNO2 and NH3 possesses a considerably higher energy barrier of 25.99 kcal/mol (reaction of adsorbed cis-HNO2 with gaseous NH3).</p>
<p>The rate-determining step of the reaction between two trans-HNO2 and the reaction between trans-HNO2 and NH3 will cost activation energies of 24.05 kcal/mol and 24.06 kcal/mol (reaction of adsorbed cis-HNO2 with gaseous NH3), respectively.</p>

The study presented here explores the behavior of NO2 in the selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxides with ammonia on the V2O5 catalyst surface. NO2 can readily reoxidize V4+OH through two reaction routes: (1) NO2 directly reoxidizes V4+OH to V5+ O and (2) NO2 reacts with H2O or NH3 to produce HNO3, which subsequently reoxidizes V4+OH to V5+ O. The energy barrier for route 1 is 9.91 kcal/mol, while route 2 possesses an activation energy of 7.44 kcal/mol, indicating that route 2 is more prevalent at low temperatures. The by-product of route 1, cis-HNO2, can either react with NH3 or another cis-HNO2, with the reaction of two cis-HNO2 having an activation energy of 18.40 kcal/mol. The reaction between cis-HNO2 and NH3 possesses a significantly higher energy barrier. Trans-HNO2 will equally react with itself, producing H2O, NO, and NO2 or with NH3, producing H2O and N2 on the catalyst surface.

本研究探讨了NO2在V2O5催化剂表面选择性催化还原氮氧化物与氨的行为。NO2可以通过两条途径快速重新氧化V4+OH：（1）NO2直接将V4+OH氧化为V5+ O；（2）NO2与H2O或NH3反应生成HNO3，随后HNO3重新氧化V4+OH为V5+ O。路线1的能量壁垒为9.91 kcal/mol，而路线2的能量壁垒为7.44 kcal/mol，表明在低温下，路线2更为普遍。路线1的副产品cis-HNO2可以与NH3或另一个cis-HNO2反应，两个cis-HNO2反应的能量壁垒为18.40 kcal/mol。cis-HNO2与NH3的反应具有显著更高的能量壁垒。对于副产物trans-HNO2，它将同样与自己反应产生H2O、NO和NO2，或者与NH3反应产生H2O和N2。
