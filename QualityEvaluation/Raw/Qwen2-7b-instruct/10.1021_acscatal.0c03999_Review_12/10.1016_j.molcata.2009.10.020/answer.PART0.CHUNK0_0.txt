<p>Based on previous work, the behavior of NO2 in the SCR reaction on the V2O5 surface could follow two reaction routes: (1) NO2 directly reoxidizing V4+OH to V5+ O and (2) NO2 reacting with H2O to produce HNO3, which subsequently reoxidizes V4+OH to V5+O.</p>
<p>The objective of the present study is to elucidate the full sequence of reaction steps including intermediates and transition state geometries, and the energetics of these two reaction routes.</p>
<p>Reactions of the by-product, HNO2, were also investigated. The results showed that both cis-HNO2 (route 1) and trans-HNO2 (route 2) can either react with NH3, producing H2O and N2, or react with themselves, producing H2O, NO and NO2.</p>
<p>The first step of the SCR reaction is the reaction of NH3 and NO on V5+ O, causing a reduction of V5+ O to V4+OH.</p>
<p>NO2 can reoxidize V4+OH via two reaction routes, as discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.</p>
<p>The behavior of NO2 in the reoxidation of V4+OH to V5+O is shown in Fig. 12.</p>

The study focuses on understanding the two primary pathways through which NO2 reoxidizes V4+OH on the V2O5 catalyst surface during the selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxides with ammonia. The two routes involve direct reoxidation of V4+OH by NO2 and the production of HNO3 from NO2 reacting with H2O or NH3, which then reoxidizes V4+OH to V5+O. The study explores the energetics and sequences of reactions for both routes, including the by-products HNO2 and their interactions. It also examines the first step of the SCR reaction, the reduction of V5+O to V4+OH by NH3 and NO, setting the stage for subsequent reoxidation by NO2. The overall behavior of NO2 in facilitating the fast selective catalytic reduction (fast SCR) reaction on the V2O5 surface is summarized in Fig. 12.

研究主要关注NO2在V2O5催化剂表面通过氨选择性催化还原氮氧化物时，对V4+OH进行再氧化的两种主要途径。这两种途径包括直接由NO2再氧化V4+OH和NO2与H2O或NH3反应生成HNO3，随后再氧化V4+OH到V5+O。研究探讨了两条路径的能量和反应序列，包括副产物HNO2及其相互作用。它还考察了SCR反应的第一步，即NH3和NO将V5+O还原为V4+OH，为后续由NO2促进的再氧化铺平道路。图12总结了NO2在V2O5表面快速选择性催化还原反应中的整体行为。
