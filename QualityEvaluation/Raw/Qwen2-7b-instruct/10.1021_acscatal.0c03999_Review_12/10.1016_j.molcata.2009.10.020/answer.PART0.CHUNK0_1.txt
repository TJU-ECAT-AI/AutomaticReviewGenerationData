[1] "The results showed that NO2 could readily reoxidize V4+OH through two reaction routes: (1) NO2 directly reoxidizing V4+OH to V5+ O and (2) NO2 reacting with H2O or NH3 to produce HNO3, which subsequently reoxidizes V4+OH to V5+O."
[2] "Route 2 possesses an energy barrier of 7.44 kcal/mol, less than route 1. This energetic comparison shows that route 2 is the predominant reaction mechanism at low temperature."
[3] "Reactions of the by-product, HNO2, were also investigated. The results showed that both cis-HNO2 (route 1) and trans- HNO2 (route 2) can either react with NH3, producing H2O and N2, or react with themselves, producing H2O, NO and NO2."
[4] "The behavior of NO2 in the selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxides with ammonia on the V2O5 catalyst surface could follow two reaction routes: (1) NO2 directly reoxidizing V4+OH to V5+ O and (2) NO2 reacting with H2O to produce HNO3, which subsequently reoxidizes V4+OH to V5+O."

The behavior of NO2 in the selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxides with ammonia on the V2O5 catalyst surface involves two primary routes. Route 1 involves direct reoxidation of V4+OH to V5+O through NO2. Route 2 entails NO2 reacting with H2O or NH3 to produce HNO3, which then reoxidizes V4+OH to V5+O. Route 2 is energetically favored at low temperatures due to a lower activation energy barrier. By-products of the reaction include HNO2, which can either react with NH3 or itself, producing H2O, NO, and NO2. Both cis-HNO2 and trans-HNO2 exhibit similar energy profiles for reactions with NH3 and themselves, suggesting equal likelihood of these pathways on the catalyst surface.

在V2O5催化剂表面，NO2选择性催化还原氮氧化物与氨的反应过程中涉及两条主要途径。途径1通过NO2直接将V4+OH氧化为V5+O。途径2是NO2与H2O或NH3反应生成HNO3，随后HNO3将V4+OH氧化为V5+O。在低温条件下，途径2更具优势，因为其活化能壁垒较低。反应的副产品包括HNO2，它可以与NH3或自身反应，生成H2O、NO和NO2。无论是cis-HNO2还是trans-HNO2，在与NH3或自身的反应中展现出相似的能量图谱，表明在催化剂表面上这些途径发生的可能性相等。
