[1] "DFT calculations were carried out to study the behavior of NO2 in the selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxides with ammonia on the surface of the V2O5 catalyst."
[2] "The results showed that NO2 could readily reoxidize V4+OH through two reaction routes: (1) NO2 directly reoxidizing V4+OH to V5+ O and (2) NO2 reacting with H2O or NH3 to produce HNO3, which subsequently reoxidizes V4+OH to V5+ O."
[3] "Reactions of the by-product, HNO2, were also investigated. The results showed that both cis-HNO2 (route 1) and trans- HNO2 (route 2) can either react with NH3, producing H2O and N2, or react with themselves, producing H2O, NO and NO2."
[4] "The overall stoichiometry of route 2, combining the reactions of Eq. (7), 11(12), 9, 10, 13 or 8, 9, 10, 13, is also in accordance with the main reaction of the fast SCR (Eq. (2))."
[5] "The by-product of route 1, cis-HNO2, can either react with NH3 or another cis-HNO2. The reaction of two cis-HNO2 producing H2O, NO and NO2 has an activation energy of 18.40 kcal/mol, while the reaction between cis-HNO2 and NH3 possesses a considerably higher energy barrier of 25.99 kcal/mol (reaction of adsorbed cis-HNO2 with gaseous NH3)."

The behavior of NO2 in the selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxides with ammonia on the surface of the V2O5 catalyst can be divided into two main pathways. Firstly, NO2 can directly reoxidize V4+OH to V5+ O. Secondly, NO2 can react with H2O or NH3 to produce HNO3, which then reoxidizes V4+OH to V5+ O. Both routes involve the formation of HNO2 as a byproduct. HNO2 can either react with NH3, producing H2O and N2, or react with itself, producing H2O, NO, and NO2. The overall stoichiometry of the second pathway aligns with the main reaction of the fast selective catalytic reduction (SCR) process. The reaction between two cis-HNO2 molecules has a lower activation energy than the reaction between cis-HNO2 and NH3, suggesting that cis-HNO2 prefers to react with itself under certain conditions.

在V2O5催化剂表面选择性催化还原硝酸盐与氨反应中NO2的行为可以分为两大主要途径。首先，NO2可以直接氧化V4+OH至V5+ O。其次，NO2可以与H2O或NH3反应生成HNO3，随后该HNO3再次氧化V4+OH至V5+ O。两条路径均涉及到HNO2的形成。HNO2可以与NH3反应生成H2O和N2，或者自身反应生成H2O、NO和NO2。第二条路径的整体化学计量与快速选择性催化还原（SCR）过程的主要反应一致。两个cis-HNO2分子之间的反应具有比cis-HNO2与NH3反应更低的活化能，表明在一定条件下，cis-HNO2更倾向于自我反应。
