Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1039/C7CY01033H], focusing on the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalysts with oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide as oxidants. The activation energy (EA) determined experimentally with CO2 and N2O was 161 and 112 kJ mol-1, respectively, in good agreement with the theoretical prediction of 144 kJ mol-1 for the abstraction of the first hydrogen atom from butane, highlighting this as the rate-determining step. Butadiene emerged as the most abundant product, with productivity reaching up to 0.89 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 when using N2O as an oxidant, 0.61 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 when using CO2, and 0.21 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 when using O2. In an oxygen atmosphere, the experimental activation energy was 75 kJ mol-1, closely matching the theoretically calculated value of 62 kJ mol-1 for surface re-oxidation. DFT calculations aligned well with experimental data, confirming the validity of the postulated reaction mechanism.

        The use of CO2 as an alternative oxidant to oxygen has the potential to avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, reduce coke formation, and favor propane conversion due to the participation of produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS). However, Cr-based catalysts faced severe and rapid deactivation within a short time, irrespective of sample preparation, reaction conditions, and reactor design. A series of Fe doped CeO2 catalysts demonstrated enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as a soft oxidant. 

        Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, were effective in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, whereas redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 required additional conditions or additives for effective CO2 activation. Transition metal clusters also played a role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with their specific mechanisms and effectiveness varying. Traditional oxidants and CO2 influenced the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, playing central roles in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

        The main product, propene, was more likely formed on the catalyst surface, as no gas-phase propyl radicals were observed. A surface model constructed from B2O3 containing surface BO3 units was used in a DFT study, revealing that the formation of ethylene and methyl radicals could occur competitively over the surface or gas-phase with similar barriers. The proposed mechanism shared similarities with other redox-poor oxides like MgO, exhibiting capacity for selective alkane conversions.

        In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation, redox-active catalysts such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 facilitated C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration through a redox cycle involving the alkane and traditional oxidant. Redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 activated C-H bonds through heterolytic cleavage, utilizing the gas phase oxidant instead of the surface. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 varied, with ceria showing promise due to its unique properties allowing for efficient CO2 activation and alkane dehydrogenation.

        The synthesis of Fe-doped ceria catalysts involved a co-precipitation method followed by calcination at various temperatures. Calcination at 600Â°C proved advantageous, yielding higher specific surface area and forming a Fe-Ce solid solution, rather than two separated cerianite-hematite phases, crucial for the catalyst's performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. This ensured a stable and active surface for the reaction.

        Nanoporous zeolite-A sheltered Pd-hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactors were utilized for propane dehydrogenation, comparing the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. The effectiveness of various catalysts such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was evaluated, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

        The role of CO2 as a soft oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation was significant, mitigating deep oxidation of alkanes and alkynes, reducing coke formation, and facilitating propane conversion by participating in the reverse water-gas shift reaction. This made CO2 a valuable alternative oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

        The document highlighted the use of iron-doped ceria (Fe-CeO2) as a catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, demonstrating enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance compared to traditional redox-active catalysts. The catalyst's performance was attributed to the specific synthesis parameters, including calcination temperature, which affected the formation of a solid solution between iron and ceria, enhancing the catalyst's activity and stability.

        The synthesis of Fe-doped ceria catalysts involved a co-precipitation method followed by calcination at various temperatures. Optimal synthesis conditions, such as calcination at 600Â°C, were crucial for the catalyst's performance in oxidative dehydrogenation, ensuring a stable and active surface for the reaction.
        
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing catalyst formulations, enhancing CO2 activation, and developing novel reactor designs for more efficient oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The integration of machine learning algorithms could also aid in predicting catalyst performance and identifying optimal operating conditions, further advancing the field of catalytic alkanes dehydrogenation.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1039/C7CY01033H\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/jp810664u\], \[10.1021/acscatal.9b03862\], and \[10.1002/anie.202002440\]. Considering the insights provided, it becomes evident that the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane, involves distinct mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration when employing redox-active versus redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. 

        Redox-active catalysts, exemplified by V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, exhibit a redox cycle where the catalyst is oxidized by the alkane and subsequently reduced by a traditional oxidant, enabling the regeneration of the active surface. On the other hand, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 may necessitate additional conditions or additives for effective activation of CO2. Transition metal clusters also play a pivotal role, albeit with varying mechanisms and efficacy.

        Traditional oxidants and CO2 serve as central elements in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, profoundly influencing the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. The choice of catalyst and oxidant significantly impacts the efficiency and selectivity of the dehydrogenation process. 

        A notable finding is the utilization of CO2 as an alternative oxidant, offering advantages such as mitigating deep oxidation, reducing coke formation, and facilitating propane conversion through its participation in the reverse water-gas shift reaction. This makes CO2 a valuable alternative in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

        The document further highlights the use of iron-doped ceria (Fe-CeO2) as a catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2, showcasing enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance compared to traditional redox-active catalysts. This system benefits from specific synthesis parameters, notably calcination at 600Â°C, which yields a higher specific surface area and a Fe-Ce solid solution, enhancing the catalyst's activity and stability.

        The synthesis of Fe-CeO2 catalysts involves a co-precipitation method followed by calcination at varying temperatures. The optimal condition of 600Â°C ensures a stable and active surface, crucial for the reaction's success. 

        The literature also discusses the effectiveness of various catalysts, including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. These catalysts display differing levels of effectiveness, with ceria showing particular promise due to its unique properties in CO2 activation and alkane dehydrogenation promotion.

        In summary, the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, especially propane, involves intricate interactions between catalyst type, oxidant selection, and reaction mechanisms. The role of CO2 as an alternative oxidant holds significant potential for enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of these processes. The synthesis and optimization of catalysts, like Fe-CeO2, are pivotal in achieving high performance and stability in oxidative dehydrogenation applications.

        
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Based on the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there is an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies in oxidative dehydrogenation. Future research might focus on optimizing catalysts for CO2 activation, enhancing the stability of redox-active catalysts, and exploring the synergistic effects of different catalyst types in conjunction with CO2 as an oxidant. There is also potential in expanding the scope to include a wider range of alkanes and exploring the integration of oxidative dehydrogenation processes with renewable energy sources to enhance environmental sustainability.
