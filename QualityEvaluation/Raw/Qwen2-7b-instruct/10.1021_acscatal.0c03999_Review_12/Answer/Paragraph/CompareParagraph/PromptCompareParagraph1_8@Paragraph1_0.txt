Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1039/C7CY01033H\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/jp810664u\], \[10.1021/acscatal.9b03862\], \[10.1002/anie.202002440\], \[10.1021/acsanm.0c01131\], and \[10.1039/D0CY00586J\]. Mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes vary significantly depending on whether the catalyst is redox-active or redox-inactive. Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadia (V2O5) and vanadyl oxide (VOx/SiO2), effectively utilize oxygen as a strong oxidant to facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, like ceria (CeO2), might require additional conditions or additives for effective CO2 activation. Transition metal clusters also contribute to the process, though their specific mechanisms and effectiveness may differ.

        Traditional oxidants and CO2 play key roles in influencing the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation during oxidative dehydrogenation. CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, helping to mitigate deep oxidation of alkanes and alkynes, reducing coke formation, and facilitating propane conversion through participation in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS).

        The role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation is significant. It aids in avoiding deep oxidation of alkanes and alkynes, reducing coke formation, and promoting propane conversion through its participation in RWGS. Ceria (CeO2) and iron-doped ceria (Fe-CeO2) demonstrate enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as a soft oxidant.

        For instance, the use of Fe-CeO2 catalysts shows enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for the propane oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2. This system demonstrates better performance compared to traditional redox-active catalysts. The synthesis of Fe-CeO2 catalysts involves a co-precipitation method followed by calcination at various temperatures. Optimal synthesis conditions, such as calcination at 600Â°C, yield higher specific surface area and form a Fe-Ce solid solution, rather than two separated cerianite-hematite phases, which enhances the catalyst's activity and stability.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing more efficient catalysts, improving the selectivity of products, and optimizing reaction conditions for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes using CO2 as an alternative oxidant.
