                    Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of more efficient catalysts that can effectively activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly with the aim of utilizing CO2 as an alternative oxidant. There is a growing interest in the use of redox-inactive catalysts, such as ceria (CeO2), for this purpose due to their unique properties that allow for the efficient activation of CO2 and the promotion of alkane dehydrogenation. Additionally, the integration of transition metal clusters could offer a more localized and efficient redox site for alkane activation, enhancing the overall efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Future studies should aim to optimize the synthesis and conditions of these catalysts, as well as to explore their synergistic effects in combination with traditional oxidants like oxygen or CO2. Moreover, the development of novel catalyst regeneration strategies could significantly improve the operational lifetime and economic viability of these processes. Another promising direction is the investigation of the mechanisms involved in the activation of C-H bonds and the dissociation of CO2, with a focus on understanding the role of different catalyst types in facilitating these reactions. This knowledge can guide the design of catalysts with tailored properties optimized for specific alkane dehydrogenation tasks.

6. Progress in Theoretical Studies of Reaction Mechanisms
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Regardless of the oxidant or catalyst used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the C&ndash;H bond must first be activated. In metal oxides, this commonly occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acid&ndash;base pair. (266−268) In the redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a C&ndash;H bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group. (269) This forms water, which desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst. (270−272) In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies. (273−275) In this context, the role of the oxidant is to regenerate the catalyst by either reoxidizing the vacancy site through providing its oxygen, or reacting with adsorbed hydrogen species on the surface.
While ODHP has featured extensively in theoretical studies, examples where soft oxidants are explicitly considered are considerably fewer. In this section, we include examples of ODHP with soft oxidants but also supplement similar examples with other alkanes, such as ethane and methane partial oxidation, which share many similarities in their reaction mechanism. Oxidants discussed in this section include CO2, N2O, NOx, and other soft oxidants, such as sulfides and halides. We discuss both scenarios where the soft oxidant participates in the reaction by regenerating oxygen vacancy sites and where they react with surface hydrogen directly, as well as additional routes such as via forming gas-phase radicals.
6.1. Reactions with CO2
6.1.1. CO2 Dissociation in ODHP
When CO2 is used as an oxidant, there are generally two proposed mechanisms for its participation in ODHP. One involves direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, and the other involves the hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO. For the CO2 dissociation route, its high stability can be problematic because it prevents it from being easily activated to oxidize the surface. Therefore, finding a catalyst with a strong affinity for CO2 and its dissociation is an important criterion for ODHP with CO2. Fan et al. have explored the feasibility of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 on a V2O5 catalyst. (276) They found the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV, suggesting an extremely difficult process. The authors therefore have concluded that CO2 is unable to reoxidize the surfaces following dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, which leads to a deactivation of the catalyst. Meanwhile, on a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy. (28) It is concluded that vanadia in the WOx&ndash;VOx/SiO2 cannot be fully oxidized to V2O5 with CO2 but instead oxidized to V2O4. In contrast, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily on the CeO2 (110) surface with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies. (277) The ability of the reduced CeO2 surface to dissociate CO2 is utilized in a series of studies with bifunctional catalysts containing a CeO2 support. (12,155,278−280) Transition metals, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have also been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation. One study found a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV could be obtained on Ni4/MgO which provides active oxygen species for alkane C&ndash;H activation. (281)
6.1.2. Factors Controlling Selectivity between ODH and Dry Reforming
CO2 can often participate in parallel competing reactions from ODHP, such as dry reforming and the RWGS at high temperatures. Selective ODHP catalysts, therefore, need to prevent dry reforming from occurring. In one such study, Myint et al. have examined a number of bifunctional catalysts, containing CoPt, CoMo, and FeNi supported on CeO2 for ethane ODH with CO2 from experiments and theory. (280) The authors observe the highest selectivity to the ODH product with FeNi/CeO2. DFT is used to rationalize this behavior by comparing the energy profiles for successive C&ndash;H dissociation and C&ndash;C dissociation reactions. As shown in Figure 26, these two paths represent the formation of the ODH product ethylene and the dry reforming product, respectively. On the CoPt surface, the intermediates for C&ndash;C dissociation are found to be considerably more favorable in energy than the C&ndash;H products, whereas the trend is reversed on the FeNi surface. The clear differences in energetics between the two paths in this comparison supports the experimentally observed selectivity trends. Thermodynamic comparisons from DFT have also been used to explain selectivity of ODHP versus dry reforming on a variety of other catalytic systems, such as Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C, (282) FeNi3 and FeOx/Ni(111), (278) and Ni3Pt and FeO/Ni(111). (12)


Kattel et al. have followed up on this study with a thorough theoretical investigation of the reaction network and kinetics. (283) In the studied reaction network for ethane ODH, CO2 goes through either a dissociative mechanism or an associative one forming HOCO (Figure 27A). In the dissociative mechanism, CO is formed and desorbs into the gas phase, while the remaining oxygen can assist in the C&ndash;H activation or become hydrogenated after unassisted C&ndash;H activation. In the associative mechanism, C&ndash;H activation first occurs independently of CO2, which provides hydrogen to form the HOCO intermediate. Once formed, it can dissociate with a barrier of 0.83 eV, significantly lower than the direct dissociation of CO2 having a barrier of 2.13 eV. In the dry reforming path, ethylene is also formed via the same intermediates (Figure 27B). However, the paths diverge upon further oxidation of ethylene to CH2CH2O, CH2CH, CH3CH, or CH2CHO, which eventually leads to C&ndash;C scission. Kinetic Monte Carlo calculations find dry reforming to be favored over ODH. Interestingly, it is revealed that the CO2 dissociation is favored over HOCO formation, despite the higher energy barriers for the former. The calculations also find the dehydrogenation of CH3CH2 to CH2CH2 to be a key descriptor of ODH selectivity, which should be promoted to improve the selectivity on the catalyst.


6.1.3. CO2 Hydrogenation in ODHP
In a work by Gomez et al., ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and subsequent aromatization by CO2 is investigated for P- and Ga-modified ZSM-5 catalysts. (284) The associative pathway for CO2 is computed with DFT, where CO2 is hydrogenated by a nearby H2 that is formed as part of the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H5 (Figure 28). The reaction of CO2 follows roughly that of reverse water&ndash;gas shift, which forms CO and H2O. The concerted hydrogenation of CO2 occurs with the dissociation of H2 to form COOH with a barrier of 1.00 eV, followed by a second concerted dissociation of the C&ndash;OH bond to form CO and H2O in a single step with a barrier of 1.78 eV. The authors find the primary role of CO2 for this reaction on Ga/ZSM5 is to consume hydrogen, which promotes portions of the reaction where H2 formation is kinetically and thermodynamically less favorable. The mechanism is also found to be consistent with 13CO2 isotope studies in the same paper, which does not report any carbon from CO2 in the final hydrocarbon products.


6.1.4. CO2 Poisoning in ODHP
On catalysts with strong basic sites, such as MgO, CO2 can interact strongly with surface sites and poisons the catalyst, which is an issue when considering CO2 as an oxidant. In oxidative coupling and dehydrogenation, it has long been noted in experiments that CO2 strongly inhibits the reaction from proceeding. (128,285,286) This is consistent with theoretical calculations which find very negative CO2 adsorption energies of −2 to −3 eV on the MgO and CaO surfaces, particularly at the step sites. (287) On these surfaces CO2 interacts with the lattice oxygen to form surface bound carbonate species. The same sites which strongly bind CO2 are also responsible for C&ndash;H activation, which remain blocked because of the much weaker interaction between the alkane and the surface. Similarly, on the perovskite BaZrO3, CO2 is found to bind strongly to form a stable carbonate layer under ambient concentrations, which suggests such a catalyst would also be inactive for ODHP with CO2. (288) Consequently, poisoning by CO2 is an important potential factor preventing its use in ODHP and may also apply to the other oxidants as well.
6.2. Reactions with N2O and NOx
6.2.1. Reactions with N2O
In an early work, Rozanska et al. have investigated ODHP on vanadia using DFT for a cluster model, and compared the differences between O2 and N2O as oxidants. (177) On this catalyst, propane first undergoes homolytic C&ndash;H activation on the terminal oxygen of the V5+ sites, reducing the site to V4+ and forming a hydroxyl. The propyl then undergoes a second C&ndash;H activation on the hydroxyl site forming propylene and a water and leaving a further reduced V3+ site, which must be regenerated by an oxidant to close the catalytic cycle. From their calculations, they find N2O to be a weaker oxidant for the catalyst, which can only oxidize the V3+ sites, whereas O2 can oxidize both V3+ and V4+ sites, as evidenced by the lower energy barriers required for O2 (Figure 29A). The oxidization of the V4+ site by O2 also leads to the formation of HO2 radicals, which can either oxidize another V4+ site or activate the C&ndash;H bonds in a side reaction, with a barrier of 0.67 eV for propane. Finally, when oxidizing the sites, N2O restores the V3+ sites back to V5+ by providing its single oxygen, whereas O2 instead forms a peroxovanadate species. This is found to be possible on both the monomeric and dimeric vanadate. Subsequent investigation found the peroxovanadate to be more active for both propane activation and propylene oxidation than the V5+ site, having lower reaction barriers and a more exothermic reaction by comparison (Figure 29B). In particular, propylene activation on peroxovanadate has a low barrier of 0.84 eV and is exothermic by 2.59 eV, whereas activation on V5+ has a barrier of 1.43 eV and is endothermic by 1.17 eV. The authors estimate the oxidation rate of propylene is one to 2 orders of magnitude greater than propane under the reaction conditions, which could contribute to the overoxidation of propane to undesired COx, when O2 is used as the oxidant. Thus, the authors point toward peroxovanadate formation as a key factor in the lower selectivity to propylene with O2 as the oxidant over N2O.


A similar hypothesis regarding differences in active oxygen sites due to the choice of oxidant has been put forward by Dasireddy et al. for butane ODH on the NiMoO4 catalyst. (289) On the basis of the DFT reaction energies for surface oxidation by O2, N2O, and CO2, it is found that the full oxidation of Ni and Mo sites is thermodynamically favorable with O2, whereas N2O and CO2 can only partially oxidize the surface, recovering only the Mo sites. On the fully oxidized surface, C&ndash;H activation is facile with a barrier of 0.05 eV, irreversibly forming butan-1-ol in a single, highly exothermic step, which eventually leads to the formation of COx. By comparison, on the partially oxidized surface, C&ndash;H activation is rate-limiting with a barrier of 1.49 eV, in reasonable agreement with the experimental activation energies in the same paper. Therefore, the higher oxidizing ability of O2 provides more reactive oxygen species on the surface, leading to the overoxidation of butane.
Using N2O as an oxidant has also been explored in metal&ndash;organic framework (MOF) systems for alkane partial oxidation and ODH. In methane partial oxidation, the terminal oxygen of the metal nodes is commonly proposed to be the active site, which activates the methane C&ndash;H bond and forms methanol via a radical-rebound mechanism. (290,291) Upon desorption of the product, N2O reoxidizes the site. In a more recent combined experimental and theoretical study, Barona et al. propose a similar mechanism for alkane ODH on the Fe3M nodes of MOF PCN-250 (Figure 30A). (292) Here, the alkane undergoes homolytic C&ndash;H activation on the terminal oxygen of the metal node, resulting in a hydroxyl group which is further reduced to form water or an alcohol. The products, then, desorb and leave an open metal site, which is subsequently filled by the oxygen from N2O activation, regenerating the site and closing the catalytic loop. In this work, they find the ability of the site to regenerate the oxygen from N2O activation and the ability of the oxygen to activate the C&ndash;H bond are correlated to a single descriptor, the oxygen binding energy on the metal node. The more negative the oxygen binding energy, the lower the N2O activation energy and the higher the C&ndash;H activation energy, and vice versa. In the regime where N2O activation is rate-limiting, a direct correlation between the DFT N2O activation energies and the experimental rates is observed, supporting this mechanism (Figure 30B). The rational design of better MOF catalysts following this mechanism may be realized by tuning the oxygen binding energy of the metal node from changing its elemental composition.


6.2.2. Reactions with NOx
NOx is another potential oxidant for alkane oxidation, though few theoretical studies have been conducted in the context of ODHP. However, some hints toward its role and reactivity in ODHP can be found in existing studies of NOx dissociation and reduction. One DFT study finds that the dissociation of NO2 can be a moderately facile process on certain metal surfaces, such as Cu(111) with a barrier of 0.61 eV. (293) Another study has looked at NO2 reduction on V2O5, and found that the reduction of NO2 to HNO2 over a hydroxyl on the V4+ site can occur with little to no barrier. (294) These V4+ sites are identical with those formed from C&ndash;H activation in ODHP, suggesting that NO2 can similarly oxidize the V4+ site like O2 as previously described (Figure 29A). (177) For the case of NO, a DFT study on Pt(100) has investigated both dissociation and hydrogenation pathways, finding the dissociation to N and O to be more favorable with a barrier of 0.96 eV. (295) These results provide guidance for catalysts which could effectively use NOx as an oxidant in the ODHP reaction.
Another perspective for the participation of NOx in ODHP has been introduced in a recent experimental and theoretical study by Annamalai et al. (296) They find that gas phase NOx can promote selective ODHP via the formation of OH radicals, which can then activate C&ndash;H bonds in ODHP in the absence of a solid catalyst. A reaction mechanism is proposed where OH radicals are formed continuously from the reaction of NO and NO2 with O2 and sacrificial H donors, such as the alkyl radicals. The reason behind the high selectivity of OH radicals for ODHP is then explained by the differences in the activation energy of various C&ndash;H bonds as a function of the hydrogen abstraction strength of the catalytic site. It is found that sites with low hydrogen abstraction strength have a greater preference for activating weaker C&ndash;H bonds (such as propylene) over stronger ones (such as propane), leading to overoxidation and a reduced selectivity to propylene. Meanwhile, the OH radical, having a strong hydrogen abstraction strength (measured by a hydrogen adsorption energy of −5.39 eV from DFT), has no such preference to the weaker C&ndash;H bonds, which prevents overoxidation from occurring. Relating this back to heterogeneous catalysis, NO is also found to be generated from boron nitride catalysts under ODHP conditions, which could also participate in this process. (297) Further theoretical studies are needed to elucidate the impact of radical formation by NOx on the ODHP reaction in the presence of a solid catalyst.
