          [1] "Selective CH Bond Activation via NOx-Mediated Generation of Strong H-Abstractors"
          [1] "The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly depending on whether the catalyst is redox-active or redox-inactive."
          [1] "Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, are effective in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
          [1] "On the other hand, redox-inactive catalysts, such as CeO2, may require additional conditions or additives for effective CO2 activation."
          [1] "Transition metal clusters also play a role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, although their specific mechanisms and effectiveness may vary."
          [1] "Traditional oxidants and CO2 are central to the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, influencing the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation."

          In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, redox-active metal oxide catalysts such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 facilitate the activation of C-H bonds and catalyst regeneration, whereas redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 might require additional conditions or additives for effective CO2 activation. Transition metal clusters also contribute to the process, though their specific mechanisms and effectiveness may differ. Traditional oxidants and CO2 play key roles in influencing the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation during the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

          在烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中，具有氧化还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，有助于C-H键的活化和催化剂的再生；而非氧化还原活性的催化剂，如CeO2，可能需要额外的条件或添加剂以实现有效的CO2激活。过渡金属簇也参与到这一过程中，但它们的特定机制和效果可能会有所不同。传统氧化剂和CO2在影响CO2解离的能量壁垒方面起着关键作用。

      <English>
          The document focuses on selective CH bond activation through the use of NOx to generate strong H-abstractors, rather than directly discussing the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

          该文档主要关注通过使用NOx生成强H-抽象剂来实现选择性CH键活化，而不是直接讨论烷烃氧化脱氢作用中活性位点的激活和催化剂再生的机制。
