The commercial heterogeneous catalyst NiMo/Al2O3 was evaluated for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane using various oxidant species: oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide. It was found that reactions of C1- C4 alkanes with oxygen yield substantial amounts of olefins, but no oxygenated products over transition metal oxides. Butadiene was the most abundant product when using N2O as an oxidant, with productivity up to 0.89 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1, compared to 0.61 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 with CO2 and 0.21 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 with oxygen as the oxidant. Utilizing soft oxidants like N2O and CO2 helps to reduce the formation of electrophilic oxygen species that could promote the oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides on the catalyst surface, thus enhancing the selectivity towards butadiene.

Vanadium and molybdenum are frequently utilized as active metals for the low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of lower alkanes. Notably, silicatitania mixed oxide has been extensively studied due to its characteristics of high surface area, thermal stability, and mechanical stability. The publication adheres to the licensing terms of your institutional subscription. There is a particular emphasis on how the choice of oxidant influences the catalyst's structure and the kinetics of the ethane ODH reaction. This concept is commonly employed in the synthesis of catalysts with a targeted selective structure.

The document focuses on selective CH bond activation through the use of NOx to generate strong H-abstractors, rather than directly discussing the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts involves traditional oxidants like oxygen or carbon dioxide (CO2) to activate the C-H bonds of the alkane substrate. Redox-active catalysts enable the activation of C-H bonds through the adsorption of oxygen or CO2, followed by the abstraction of hydrogen or the formation of radicals. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like transition metal clusters, do not directly participate in redox reactions. Instead, they activate C-H bonds through heterolytic cleavage of the alkane molecule, typically with the assistance of gas-phase oxidants such as CO2. This process does not involve the direct reduction of the catalyst surface but relies on the gas-phase oxidant to facilitate the activation of the C-H bonds. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on their ability to facilitate the dissociation of CO2 into its constituent atoms.

Answer: There are no specific quotes from the provided literature regarding the comparison of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration mechanisms for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, or the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. The document seems to focus on the development of a nanoporous zeolite-A sheltered Pd-hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor for propane dehydrogenation, but does not delve into the detailed mechanisms or comparisons requested in the question.
