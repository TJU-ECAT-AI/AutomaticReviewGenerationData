Redox-active catalysts enable the activation of C-H bonds through the adsorption of oxygen or CO2, followed by the abstraction of hydrogen or the formation of radicals. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like transition metal clusters, do not directly participate in redox reactions. Instead, they activate C-H bonds through heterolytic cleavage of the alkane molecule, typically with the assistance of gas-phase oxidants such as CO2. This process does not involve the direct reduction of the catalyst surface but relies on the gas-phase oxidant to facilitate the activation of the C-H bonds. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on their ability to facilitate the dissociation of CO2 into its constituent atoms.", "Doi": "10.1002/anie.202002440"},
