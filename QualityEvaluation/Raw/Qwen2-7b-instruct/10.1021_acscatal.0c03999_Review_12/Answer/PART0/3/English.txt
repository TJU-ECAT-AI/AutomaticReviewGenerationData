The Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) profiles illustrate the conversion of initial high-valence oxides into structurally unique suboxides. Lower TPRO peak temperatures and greater peak areas indicate enhanced oxygen mobility and higher oxygen storage capacity, respectively. In the presence of oxygen, there are more re-oxidized sites compared to when nitrogen oxide is present. In an oxygen atmosphere, the barrier for oxygen vacancy replenishment decreases to 0.64 eV (62 kJ mol-1), resulting in the non-negligible formation of both O-Mo and O-Ni surface species. A fully oxygen-terminated surface promotes the complete oxidation of butane into cracked products and COx, as butane transforms into butan-1-ol instantly and irreversibly.

Utilizing N2O as an oxidant brings the activation energy of re-oxidation closer to the observed ODH activation energy, implying that the rates of catalyst re-oxidation and reduction will be more comparable when N2O is used. This difference explains why O2 can oxidize a reduced sample at lower temperatures compared to N2O. Based on our thermogravimetric oxidation (TPO) activation energies and assuming equal pre-exponential factors, the re-oxidation rate of O2 at 550°C would be approximately 1700 times faster than that of N2O.
