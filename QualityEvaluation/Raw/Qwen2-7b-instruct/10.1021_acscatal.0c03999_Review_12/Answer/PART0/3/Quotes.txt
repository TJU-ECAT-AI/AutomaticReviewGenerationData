          [2] "The lower TPRO peak temperature (< 350 C) and the larger TPRO peak area correspond to the higher oxygen mobility and the larger oxygen capacity, respectively."
          [3] "In the presence of O2, the amount of re-oxidised sites is higher than those observed in the presence of N2O."
          [4] "In O2 atmosphere, the barrier for vacancies replenishment drops to 0.64 eV (62 kJ mol-1) and leads to non-negligible formation of both, O-Mo and O-Ni surface species."
          [5] "A fully oxygen-terminated surface favours total oxidation of butane to cracked products and COx, as butane immediately and irreversibly transforms into butan-1-ol."

[1] "The use of N2O as oxidant makes the activation energy of re-oxidation much closer to the apparent ODH activation energy, which suggests that the rates of catalyst re-oxidation and reduction will be much closer when using N2O as oxidant."
          [2] "This difference likely accounts for the ability of O2 to oxidize the reduced sample at lower temperatures than N2O."
          [3] "On the basis of our TPO activation energies and assuming equal pre-exponential factors, the O2 re-oxidation rate would be approximately 1700 times faster than the N2O re-oxidation rate at 550 C."
