          [1] "The main product, propene, is more likely formed on the catalyst surface, since no gas-phase propyl radicals were observed."
          [2] "In our DFT study, a surface model was constructed from B2O3 containing surface BO3 units."
          [3] "We find the formation of such as ethylene and methyl radicals can occur competitively over either the surface or the gas-phase (Supporting Information, FiguresS30, S31) with similar barriers."
          [4] "The proposed mechanism bears similarities to other redox-poor oxides such as MgO,16 and shares their capacity for selective alkane conversions."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differs significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as vanadia (V2O5) and vanadyl oxide (VOx/SiO2), involve a redox cycle where the catalyst is oxidized by the alkane and then reduced by a traditional oxidant, leading to the regeneration of the active surface. Redox-inactive catalysts, like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), activate C-H bonds through heterolytic cleavage, utilizing the gas phase oxidant rather than the surface. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation depends on their ability to selectively activate the C-H bonds in propane without requiring an external oxidant like O2.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢反应在活性氧化还原和无活性氧化还原金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异。活性氧化还原催化剂，如五氧化二钒（V2O5）和五氧化二钒氧化物（VOx/SiO2），涉及一个氧化还原循环，其中催化剂被烷烃氧化，然后通过传统氧化剂（通常是分子氧O2）还原，从而实现催化剂表面的再生。无活性氧化还原催化剂，如六方氮化硼（h-BN），通过异裂活化C-H键，利用气体相氧化剂而不是表面。不同催化剂在激活CO2用于氧化脱氢的有效性取决于它们选择性活化丙烷中C-H键的能力，而不需外部氧化剂如O2。

          [1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
          [2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
          [3] "However, the detection of methyl radical over BOx/SiO2 (Supporting Information, FigureS21) in the absence of NO suggests that radical chemistry over boron-based catalysts for ODHP reaction is indeed present regardless of NO presence."
          [4] "DFT calculations were performed to construct the reaction mechanism including pathways and radical chemistry of ODHP on the boron nitride catalyst."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts involves traditional oxidants like oxygen or carbon dioxide (CO2) to activate the C-H bonds of the alkane substrate. Redox-active catalysts enable the activation of C-H bonds through the adsorption of oxygen or CO2, followed by the abstraction of hydrogen or the formation of radicals. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like transition metal clusters, do not directly participate in redox reactions. Instead, they activate C-H bonds through heterolytic cleavage of the alkane molecule, typically with the assistance of gas-phase oxidants such as CO2. This process does not involve the direct reduction of the catalyst surface but relies on the gas-phase oxidant to facilitate the activation of the C-H bonds. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on their ability to facilitate the dissociation of CO2 into its constituent atoms.

          在红氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂上进行烷烃氧化脱氢涉及传统的氧化剂，如氧气或二氧化碳（CO2），以激活烷烃基团中的C-H键。红氧化还原活性催化剂通过吸附氧气或CO2来激活C-H键，随后通过氢原子的抽取或形成自由基。相比之下，红氧化还原活性不强的金属氧化物催化剂，如过渡金属簇，不会直接参与氧化还原反应。相反，它们通过异裂解烷烃分子来激活C-H键，通常需要气体相氧化剂，如CO2的协助。这个过程不需要催化剂表面的直接还原，而是依赖于气体相氧化剂来促进C-H键的激活。不同催化剂在二氧化碳的氧化脱氢作用中的有效性取决于其促进二氧化碳解离的能力，使其能够将其分解为其原子成分。
