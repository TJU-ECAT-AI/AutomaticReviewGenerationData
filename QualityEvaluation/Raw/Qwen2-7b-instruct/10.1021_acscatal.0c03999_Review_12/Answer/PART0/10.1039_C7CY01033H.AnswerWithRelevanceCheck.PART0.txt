          The oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalysts has been investigated with oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide as oxidants. The activation energy (EA) determined experimentally with CO2 and N2O as oxidants was 161 and 112 kJ mol-1, respectively, which aligns well with the theoretical prediction of 144 kJ mol-1 for the abstraction of the first hydrogen atom from butane, indicating this is the rate-determining step. Butadiene emerged as the most abundant product with productivity reaching up to 0.89 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 when using N2O as an oxidant, 0.61 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 when using CO2 as an oxidant, and 0.21 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 when using O2 as an oxidant. In an oxygen atmosphere, the experimental activation energy was 75 kJ mol-1, closely matching the theoretically calculated value of 62 kJ mol-1 for surface re-oxidation. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations matched the experimental data, validating the proposed reaction mechanism.

          使用Ni-Mo/Al2O3催化剂，n-丁烷的氧化脱氢研究了氧气、二氧化碳和硝酸盐氧化剂。使用二氧化碳和N2O作为氧化剂时，实验确定的激活能分别为161和112 kJ mol-1，与理论预测的从丁烷中提取第一个氢原子的144 kJ mol-1基本一致，这表明这是决定速率的步骤。丁二烯是最丰富的产物，其产量分别达到使用N2O作为氧化剂时的0.89 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1，使用CO2作为氧化剂时的0.61 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1，以及使用O2作为氧化剂时的0.21 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1。在氧气气氛中，实验确定的激活能为75 kJ mol-1，与表面重新氧化的理论上计算值62 kJ mol-1非常接近。基于密度泛函理论（DFT）的计算与实验数据相匹配，证明了假设的反应机制是可靠的。

          [1] "Commercial heterogeneous NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst was tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of n-butane with different oxidant species: O2, CO2 and N2O."
          [2] "In literature 1, 13, 39, 45, it was reported that the reaction of C1- C4 alkanes with O- gives significant amounts of olefins, but no oxygenated products over transition metal oxides."

          [4] "Using soft oxidants like N2O and CO2 limits the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which promote the oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides, on the surface of the catalyst, thereby increasing the selectivity towards butadiene."

          The commercial heterogeneous catalyst NiMo/Al2O3 was evaluated for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane using various oxidant species: oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide. It was found that reactions of C1- C4 alkanes with oxygen yield substantial amounts of olefins, but no oxygenated products over transition metal oxides. Butadiene was the most abundant product when using N2O as an oxidant, with productivity up to 0.89 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1, compared to 0.61 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 with CO2 and 0.21 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 with oxygen as the oxidant. Utilizing soft oxidants like N2O and CO2 helps to reduce the formation of electrophilic oxygen species that could promote the oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides on the catalyst surface, thus enhancing the selectivity towards butadiene.

          商业异质催化剂NiMo/Al2O3被用于n-丁烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应，并使用了不同类型的氧化剂：氧气、二氧化碳和硝酸盐。研究表明，C1- C4烷烃与氧气反应生成大量烯烃，但过渡金属氧化物上无氧产物。当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，丁二烯是产量最高的产物，达到最高可达0.89 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1，相比使用氧气为0.61 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1和二氧化碳为0.21 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1。使用软氧化剂如N2O和CO2有助于减少催化剂表面形成亲电性氧物种的可能性，这些物种会促进烯烃氧化生成碳氧化物，从而增加对丁二烯的选择性。

          [1] "The TPR profiles reflect the structural transformation of the starting high valence oxides into structurally distinct suboxides."
          [2] "The lower TPRO peak temperature (< 350 C) and the larger TPRO peak area correspond to the higher oxygen mobility and the larger oxygen capacity, respectively."

          [4] "In O2 atmosphere, the barrier for vacancies replenishment drops to 0.64 eV (62 kJ mol-1) and leads to non-negligible formation of both, O-Mo and O-Ni surface species."

          The Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) profiles illustrate the conversion of initial high-valence oxides into structurally unique suboxides. Lower TPRO peak temperatures and greater peak areas indicate enhanced oxygen mobility and higher oxygen storage capacity, respectively. In the presence of oxygen, there are more re-oxidized sites compared to when nitrogen oxide is present. In an oxygen atmosphere, the barrier for oxygen vacancy replenishment decreases to 0.64 eV (62 kJ mol-1), resulting in the non-negligible formation of both O-Mo and O-Ni surface species. A fully oxygen-terminated surface promotes the complete oxidation of butane into cracked products and COx, as butane transforms into butan-1-ol instantly and irreversibly.
