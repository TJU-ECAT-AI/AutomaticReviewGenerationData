          The study investigates the implications of using oxygen and nitrous oxide as oxidants in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation over silica-titania-supported molybdenum catalysts. Special emphasis is placed on the effect of oxidant on the catalyst structure and the kinetics of the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction. The research examines the effect of using N2O and O2 as oxidants during ethane ODH on a molybdenum-based catalyst. The publication is subject to institutional subscription licensing and requires permission for reuse. Subjects covered include catalysts, hydrocarbons, oxides, oxygen, and selectivity. To understand the catalyst's behavior, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were conducted after steady-state ethane ODH using either O2 or N2O as oxidants. The deconvoluted Mo 3d spectrum for post-reaction ethane ODH using nitrous oxide as oxidant is shown in Figure 4b. The working oxidation state of the catalyst is different when performing ODH with O2 or N2O. The results shown in Figure 3 for O2 are not surprising considering that numerous studies have shown that varying oxygen concentration during ethane ODH has no effect on the olefin formation rate. The experimentally measured re-oxidation rate in an N2O TPO is within an order of magnitude of the ethane consumption rate under similar conditions in steady-state ethane ODH experiments, making the re-oxidation step kinetically relevant when using N2O as oxidant.

          该研究关注于使用氧气和亚硝酸氮作为氧化剂在二氧化硅-钛酸盐支持钼催化剂上的乙烷氧化脱氢化过程的影响。特别强调了氧化剂对催化剂结构及其乙烷氧化脱氢化(ODH)反应动力学的作用。研究考察了使用N2O和O2作为氧化剂在基于钼的催化剂上进行乙烷ODH的效果。文章受机构订阅许可，并要求重新使用时申请权限。讨论的主体包括催化剂、烃类、氧化物、氧气和选择性。为了了解催化剂的行为，进行了稳态乙烷ODH后使用O2或N2O作为氧化剂的X射线光电子能谱(XPS)分析。使用N2O作为氧化剂进行后反应的乙烷ODH的去卷积Mo 3d谱图显示在图4b中。当使用O2或N2O进行ODH时，催化剂的工作氧化状态不同。在考虑了大量研究已表明在乙烷ODH过程中变化氧浓度对烯烃生成率没有影响的情况下，图3中关于O2的结果并不令人惊讶。在N2O TPO中测量的重新氧化速率在类似条件下的稳定态乙烷ODH实验中乙烷消耗速率的量级范围内，这意味着使用N2O作为氧化剂时重新氧化步骤的动力学相关性。

          [1] "The use of N2O as oxidant makes the activation energy of re-oxidation much closer to the apparent ODH activation energy, which suggests that the rates of catalyst re-oxidation and reduction will be much closer when using N2O as oxidant."
          [2] "This difference likely accounts for the ability of O2 to oxidize the reduced sample at lower temperatures than N2O."
          [3] "On the basis of our TPO activation energies and assuming equal pre-exponential factors, the O2 re-oxidation rate would be approximately 1700 times faster than the N2O re-oxidation rate at 550 C."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
          Utilizing N2O as an oxidant brings the activation energy of re-oxidation closer to the observed ODH activation energy, implying that the rates of catalyst re-oxidation and reduction will be more comparable when N2O is used. This difference explains why O2 can oxidize a reduced sample at lower temperatures compared to N2O. Based on our thermogravimetric oxidation (TPO) activation energies and assuming equal pre-exponential factors, the re-oxidation rate of O2 at 550°C would be approximately 1700 times faster than that of N2O.

          使用N2O作为氧化剂使再氧化的活化能更接近观察到的ODH活化能，这意味着使用N2O时催化剂的再氧化和还原速率将更加接近。这一差异解释了为什么O2可以在比N2O更低的温度下氧化还原样品。基于我们的热重氧化(TPO)活化能和假设预指数因子相等，550°C时的O2再氧化速率大约是N2O的1700倍。
