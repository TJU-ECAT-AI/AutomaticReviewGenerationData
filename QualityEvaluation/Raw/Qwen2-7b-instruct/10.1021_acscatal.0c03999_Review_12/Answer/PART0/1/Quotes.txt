          [9] "The results shown in Figure 3 for O2 are not surprising considering that numerous studies have shown that varying oxygen concentration during ODH of ethane has no effect on the olefin formation rate."
          [10] "The experimentally measured re-oxidation rate in an N2O TPO is within an order of magnitude of the ethane consumption rate under similar conditions in steady-state ethane ODH experiments making the re-oxidation step kinetically relevant when using N2O as oxidant."
