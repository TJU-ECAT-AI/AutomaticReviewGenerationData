The oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalysts has been investigated with oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide as oxidants. The activation energy (EA) determined experimentally with CO2 and N2O as oxidants was 161 and 112 kJ mol-1, respectively, which aligns well with the theoretical prediction of 144 kJ mol-1 for the abstraction of the first hydrogen atom from butane, indicating this is the rate-determining step. Butadiene emerged as the most abundant product with productivity reaching up to 0.89 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 when using N2O as an oxidant, 0.61 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 when using CO2 as an oxidant, and 0.21 gbutadiene. gcat -1 h-1 when using O2 as an oxidant. In an oxygen atmosphere, the experimental activation energy was 75 kJ mol-1, closely matching the theoretically calculated value of 62 kJ mol-1 for surface re-oxidation.

The study investigates the implications of using oxygen and nitrous oxide as oxidants in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation over silica-titania-supported molybdenum catalysts. Special emphasis is placed on the effect of oxidant on the catalyst structure and the kinetics of the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction. The research examines the effect of using N2O and O2 as oxidants during ethane ODH on a molybdenum-based catalyst. The publication is subject to institutional subscription licensing and requires permission for reuse. Subjects covered include catalysts, hydrocarbons, oxides, oxygen, and selectivity. To understand the catalyst's behavior, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were conducted after steady-state ethane ODH using either O2 or N2O as oxidants. The deconvoluted Mo 3d spectrum for post-reaction ethane ODH using nitrous oxide as oxidant is shown in Figure 4b. The working oxidation state of the catalyst is different when performing ODH with O2 or N2O. The results shown in Figure 3 for O2 are not surprising considering that numerous studies have shown that varying oxygen concentration during ethane ODH has no effect on the olefin formation rate. The experimentally measured re-oxidation rate in an N2O TPO is within an order of magnitude of the ethane consumption rate under similar conditions in steady-state ethane ODH experiments, making the re-oxidation step kinetically relevant when using N2O as oxidant.

In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, redox-active metal oxide catalysts such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 facilitate the activation of C-H bonds and catalyst regeneration, whereas redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 might require additional conditions or additives for effective CO2 activation. Transition metal clusters also contribute to the process, though their specific mechanisms and effectiveness may differ. Traditional oxidants and CO2 play key roles in influencing the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation during the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differs significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as vanadia (V2O5) and vanadyl oxide (VOx/SiO2), involve a redox cycle where the catalyst is oxidized by the alkane and then reduced by a traditional oxidant, leading to the regeneration of the active surface. Redox-inactive catalysts, like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), activate C-H bonds through heterolytic cleavage, utilizing the gas phase oxidant rather than the surface. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation depends on their ability to selectively activate the C-H bonds in propane without requiring an external oxidant like O2.

The literature discusses the use of a nanoporous zeolite-A sheltered Pd-hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor for propane dehydrogenation. It compares the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. It also evaluates the effectiveness of various catalysts such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes typically involves the activation of C-H bonds, where traditional oxidants like oxygen play a critical role in the redox reactions. Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, effectively utilize oxygen as a strong oxidant to facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts might rely on weaker oxidants or employ a combination of thermal energy and chemical activation to promote the reaction. For instance, ceria (CeO2) and transition metal clusters can also be employed in oxidative dehydrogenation, albeit with differing mechanisms. Ceria is known for its ability to store and release oxygen, which can aid in the activation of CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Transition metal clusters, on the other hand, might offer a more localized and efficient redox site for alkane activation. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 varies, with ceria showing promise due to its unique properties that allow for the efficient activation of CO2 and the promotion of alkane dehydrogenation.

          The role of CO2 as a soft oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation is significant. It helps to mitigate deep oxidation of alkanes and alkynes, reduces the formation of coke, and facilitates propane conversion by participating in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS). This property makes CO2 a valuable alternative oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

          The document showcases the use of iron-doped ceria (Fe-CeO2) as a catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. This system demonstrates enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance compared to traditional redox-active catalysts. The catalyst's performance is attributed to the specific synthesis parameters, including calcination temperature, which affects the formation of a solid solution between iron and ceria, thereby enhancing the catalyst's activity and stability.

          The synthesis of the Fe-doped ceria catalysts involves a co-precipitation method followed by calcination at various temperatures. Calcination at 600Â°C is particularly advantageous because it yields higher specific surface area and forms a Fe-Ce solid solution, rather than two separated cerianite-hematite phases. This optimal synthesis condition is crucial for the catalyst's performance in oxidative dehydrogenation, as it ensures a stable and active surface for the reaction.

The results shown in Figure 3 for O2 are not surprising considering that numerous studies have shown that varying oxygen concentration during ethane ODH has no effect on the olefin formation rate. The experimentally measured re-oxidation rate in an N2O TPO is within an order of magnitude of the ethane consumption rate under similar conditions in steady-state ethane ODH experiments, making the re-oxidation step kinetically relevant when using N2O as oxidant.

In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, redox-active metal oxide catalysts such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 facilitate the activation of C-H bonds and catalyst regeneration, whereas redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 might require additional conditions or additives for effective CO2 activation. Transition metal clusters also contribute to the process, though their specific mechanisms and effectiveness may differ. Traditional oxidants and CO2 play key roles in influencing the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation during the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differs significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as vanadia (V2O5) and vanadyl oxide (VOx/SiO2), involve a redox cycle where the catalyst is oxidized by the alkane and then reduced by a traditional oxidant, leading to the regeneration of the active surface. Redox-inactive catalysts, like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), activate C-H bonds through heterolytic cleavage, utilizing the gas phase oxidant rather than the surface. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation depends on their ability to selectively activate the C-H bonds in propane without requiring an external oxidant like O2.

The literature discusses the use of a nanoporous zeolite-A sheltered Pd-hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor for propane dehydrogenation. It compares the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. It also evaluates the effectiveness of various catalysts such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes typically involves the activation of C-H bonds, where traditional oxidants like oxygen play a critical role in the redox reactions. Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, effectively utilize oxygen as a strong oxidant to facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts might rely on weaker oxidants or employ a combination of thermal energy and chemical activation to promote the reaction. For instance, ceria (CeO2) and transition metal clusters can also be employed in oxidative dehydrogenation, albeit with differing mechanisms. Ceria is known for its ability to store and release oxygen, which can aid in the activation of CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Transition metal clusters, on the other hand, might offer a more localized and efficient redox site for alkane activation. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 varies, with ceria showing promise due to its unique properties that allow for the efficient activation of CO2 and the promotion of alkane dehydrogenation.

          The role of CO2 as a soft oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation is significant. It helps to mitigate deep oxidation of alkanes and alkynes, reduces the formation of coke, and facilitates propane conversion by participating in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS). This property makes CO2 a valuable alternative oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

          The document showcases the use of iron-doped ceria (Fe-CeO2) as a catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. This system demonstrates enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance compared to traditional redox-active catalysts. The catalyst's performance is attributed to the specific synthesis parameters, including calcination temperature, which affects the formation of a solid solution between iron and ceria, thereby enhancing the catalyst's activity and stability.

          The synthesis of the Fe-doped ceria catalysts involves a co-precipitation method followed by calcination at various temperatures. Calcination at 600Â°C is particularly advantageous because it yields higher specific surface area and forms a Fe-Ce solid solution, rather than two separated cerianite-hematite phases. This optimal synthesis condition is crucial for the catalyst's performance in oxidative dehydrogenation, as it ensures a stable and active surface for the reaction.
