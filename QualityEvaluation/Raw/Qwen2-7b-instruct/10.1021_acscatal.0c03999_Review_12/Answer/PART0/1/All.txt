Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, effectively utilize oxygen as a strong oxidant to facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts might rely on weaker oxidants or employ a combination of thermal energy and chemical activation to promote the reaction. For instance, ceria (CeO2) and transition metal clusters can also be employed in oxidative dehydrogenation, albeit with differing mechanisms. Ceria is known for its ability to store and release oxygen, which can aid in the activation of CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Transition metal clusters, on the other hand, might offer a more localized and efficient redox site for alkane activation.

Calcination at 600°C is particularly advantageous because it yields higher specific surface area and forms a Fe-Ce solid solution, rather than two separated cerianite-hematite phases.

Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, effectively utilize oxygen as a strong oxidant to facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts might rely on weaker oxidants or employ a combination of thermal energy and chemical activation to promote the reaction. For instance, ceria (CeO2) and transition metal clusters can also be employed in oxidative dehydrogenation, albeit with differing mechanisms. Ceria is known for its ability to store and release oxygen, which can aid in the activation of CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Transition metal clusters, on the other hand, might offer a more localized and efficient redox site for alkane activation. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 varies, with ceria showing promise due to its unique properties that allow for the efficient activation of CO2 and the promotion of alkane dehydrogenation.\n\n          The role of CO2 as a soft oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation is significant. It helps to mitigate deep oxidation of alkanes and alkynes, reduces the formation of coke, and facilitates propane conversion by participating in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS).

Calcination at 600°C is particularly advantageous because it yields higher specific surface area and forms a Fe-Ce solid solution, rather than two separated cerianite-hematite phases.

The research examines the effect of using N2O and O2 as oxidants during ethane ODH on a molybdenum-based catalyst. The publication is subject to institutional subscription licensing and requires permission for reuse. Subjects covered include catalysts, hydrocarbons, oxides, oxygen, and selectivity. To understand the catalyst's behavior, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were conducted after steady-state ethane ODH using either O2 or N2O as oxidants. The deconvoluted Mo 3d spectrum for post-reaction ethane ODH using nitrous oxide as oxidant is shown in Figure 4b. The working oxidation state of the catalyst is different when performing ODH with O2 or N2O. The results shown in Figure 3 for O2 are not surprising considering that numerous studies have shown that varying oxygen concentration during ethane ODH has no effect on the olefin formation rate. The experimentally measured re-oxidation rate in an N2O TPO is within an order of magnitude of the ethane consumption rate under similar conditions in steady-state ethane ODH experiments, making the re-oxidation step kinetically relevant when using N2O as oxidant.", "Chinese": "该研究关注于使用氧气和亚硝酸氮作为氧化剂在二氧化硅-钛酸盐支持钼催化剂上的乙烷氧化脱氢化过程的影响。特别强调了氧化剂对催化剂结构及其乙烷氧化脱氢化(ODH)反应动力学的作用。研究考察了使用N2O和O2作为氧化剂在基于钼的催化剂上进行乙烷ODH的效果。文章受机构订阅许可，并要求重新使用时申请权限。讨论的主体包括催化剂、烃类、氧化物、氧气和选择性。为了了解催化剂的行为，进行了稳态乙烷ODH后使用O2或N2O作为氧化剂的X射线光电子能谱(XPS)分析。使用N2O作为氧化剂进行后反应的乙烷ODH的去卷积Mo 3d谱图显示在图4b中。当使用O2或N2O进行ODH时，催化剂的工作氧化状态不同。在考虑了大量研究已表明在乙烷ODH过程中变化氧浓度对烯烃生成率没有影响的情况下，图3中关于O2的结果并不令人惊讶。在N2O TPO中测量的重新氧化速率在类似条件下的稳定态乙烷ODH实验中乙烷消耗速率的量级范围内，这意味着使用N2O作为氧化剂时重新氧化步骤的动力学相关性。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp810664u"},
