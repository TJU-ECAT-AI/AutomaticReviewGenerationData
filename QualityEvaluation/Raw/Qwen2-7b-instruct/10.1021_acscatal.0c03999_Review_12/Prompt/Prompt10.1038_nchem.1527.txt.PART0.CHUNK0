Sulfur as a selective soft oxidant for catalytic methane conversion probed by experiment and theory Qingjun Zhu1, Staci L. Wegener1, Chao Xie1, Obioma Uche2, Matthew Neurock2* and Tobin J. Marks1* Developing efficient catalytic processes to convert methane into useful feedstocks relies critically upon devising new coupling processes that use abundant, thermodynamically mild oxidants together with selective catalysts. We report here on elemental sulfur as a promising soft oxidant for selective methane conversion to ethylene over MoS2, RuS2, TiS2, PdS and Pd/ZrO2 catalysts. Experiments and density functional theory reveal that methane conversion is directly correlated with surface metalsulfur bond strengths. Surfaces with weakly bound sulfur are more basic and activate methane CH bonds more readily. In contrast, experimental and theoretical selectivities scale inversely with surface metalsulfur bond strengths, and surfaces with the strongest metalsulfur bonds afford the highest ethylene selectivities. High CH4/S ratios,short contact times and the provision of a support maximizes the coupling of CHx intermediates and selectivity to ethylene, because these conditions yield surfaces with stronger metalsulfur bonding (for example, Pd16S7), which suppresses the over-oxidation of methane.
T
he anticipated long-term decline in petroleum reserves coupled with increasing worldwide energy demands will require alternative hydrocarbon feedstocks and conversion processes to produce fuels and basic chemical intermediates such as ethylene and propene1. Methane, the principal component of natural gas, is proposed as a suitable alternative because of its abun- dant reserves and high hydrogen:carbon ratio24. Although methane steam reforming to give synthesis gas (CO  H2)5,6followed by catalytic conversion to methanol and other oxygenates7,8 or FischerTropsch synthesis9is widely practised, these routes are highly capital-intensive. A direct, high-selectivity, one-step route for the methane-to-olefins process would therefore be highly desirable.
Significant methane reserves are currently found in stranded locations, and utilizing these reserves will require strategies for their efficient conversion to higher-value and/or more transportable products10. Indeed, for methane to be a viable carbon feedstock,more selective, less capital-intensive conversion processes are neededa true grand challenge11. To date, approaches explored for the direct, large-scale chemical transformation of methane to useful chemicals include aromatization12, oxyclorination13,14 and oxidative coupling15. However, these processes all have recognized limitations, including modest selectivities and yields, the require- ment for corrosive reagents, heat management and temperature control, and/or dependence on toxic halogenated intermediates.
The seemingly straightforward oxidative transformation of methane with O2 is in principle an attractive approach15;however, the yields to desired products are typically limited by severe over-oxidation pathways. Desired targets such as methanol,formaldehyde and ethylene are far more reactive with O2 than methane, and are therefore rapidly converted into more thermo- dynamically stable products, principally CO2. Furthermore, the reactions with O2 are highly exothermic, and can increase local temperatures within reactors by 150300 8C, thereby presenting significant heat management and reactor design issues. New catalytic strategies to enhance the selective conversion of methane to olefins or to other value-added intermediates with lower heat emission are therefore pivotal to developing viable methane conversion processes1623.
In comparison to O2, the thermodynamic driving force for methane over-oxidation by S2 is significantly less (it is a softer oxidant; see Table 1 for a thermodynamic comparison of O2 and S2 as oxidants)24,25. This result arises primarily from the weaker CS and HS bonds and the lower bond enthalpies of the expected inter- mediates and products in comparison with those involving O2. Note that the vapour-phase oxidative coupling of methane by sulfur (as gaseous S2) to produce ethylene is entropically driven, and is exergo- nic only at temperatures above 950 K (Table 1, reaction 6). The use of sulfur as the oxidant in methane conversion may alleviate engineering issues associated with the significant local temperature excursions Table 1  Thermodynamic comparison of O2 versus S2 as oxidants for oxidative methane reactions at 1,073 K and

All rights reserved. that occur when O2 is used. The thermodynamic data show that selec- tive catalytic oxidative coupling of methane by S2 should be possible if methane can be activated selectively. Note that the over-oxidation of methane to CS2 or other species (Table 1, reactions 710) is far less favourable than the analogous over-oxidation by O2 (Table 1, reac- tions 25), as summarized graphically in Fig. 1.
There is an extensive body of information concerning catalyst structure and reactivity2629 for the industrial desulfurization of hydrocarbons over transition-metal sulfides such as Co/MoS2 and RuSx catalysts3035. However, very few studies have reported catalytic reactions involving elemental sulfur and saturated hydrocar- bons36,37. Here, we report on the catalytic conversion of methane to ethylene (as expressed in reaction 6 of Table 1), using elemental sulfur as an oxidant over transition-metal sulfide catalysts.
Experimental results indicating promising selectivity are used together with first-principles quantum chemical calculations to show that both the activation of methane and the selectivity of the subsequent conversion to ethylene can be linearly correlated with the catalyst metalsulfur (MS) bond strength (defined here as the energy to remove atomic sulfur as H2S from the sulfide surface, using H2), and that the two relationships are inversely related to one another. The sites that are most active for methane activation involve weakly bound surface sulfur atoms,which promote hydrogen abstraction, whereas those that are most selective involve strongly bound surface sulfur atoms, which facilitate hydrocarbon fragment coupling to C2 products and suppress the over-oxidation of methane. Higher methane:sulfur (CH4/S) feed ratios and higher temperatures enhance methane conversion and ethylene selectivity, and at the same time appear to reduce the active sulfide catalysts and increase the metal:sulfur compositions at the surface. This in turn decreases overall conver- sion while increasing the selectivity to ethylene. These insights demonstrate that sulfur is a promising reagent for the selective oxidative transformation of methane and should help guide the discovery of even more selective catalytic materials. The highest methane-to-ethylene selectivity is found here for supported PdSx catalysts operating at relatively high temperatures, high CH4/S ratios and short contact times.
Results and discussion Catalytic reactions were carried out in a flow reactor specially designed to generate gaseous sulfur38 as S2 for reactions with hydrocarbons,using argon as the balance gas (see Supplementary Section A1 for details). Figure 2 presents a summary of methane conversion and ethylene selectivity data as a function of temperature over a series of catalysts. Note that these reactions are very clean and the only detectable carbon-con- taining products observed in the effluent stream are ethylene and carbon disulfide. Control experiments included blank reactions in quartz chip-packed reactor tubes. Passing methane through the reactor at 1,173 K in the absence of sulfur produces negligible amounts of ethylene. Although the reactions are carried out at relatively high temperatures, there is no evidence of significant coke formation on the catalyst surfaces after reaction, as assayed by UVRaman spectroscopy39 and combustion analysis (for a spent PdS catalyst operated for 4 h at 1,273 K, C 0.03 wt%),and the mass balance in these processes is invariably .98%. Both methane conversion and ethylene selectivity (reported as two times the moles of ethylene produced/moles of methane reacted) increase markedly with increasing reaction temperature for all cata- lysts examined. The selectivity for ethylene is also strongly catalyst- dependent (Fig. 2b), following the trend PdS . TiS2 . RuS2 .

In contrast, both the RuS2 and MoS2 catalysts exhibit very low ethylene selectivities lower than the selectivity measured in the blank experiments over the entire temperature rangebecause they efficiently catalyse over-oxidation to CS2. A minimal ethylene yield is observed for all catalysts at temperatures below 1,073 K. The absence of detectable ethane and methanethiol formation over any of the catalysts is in agreement with thermodynamic expectations that the formation of these products is unfavourable under these con- ditions (Table 1).
CHx coupling can conceivably occur either on the surface of the catalyst or in the gas phase. The increased selectivity and conversion with increasing temperature reported in Fig. 2 in principle supports both surface as well as gas-phase CHx coupling pathways, because increasing the temperature or conversion will increase CHx species formation on the surface as well as in the gas phase. The increase in selectivity that occurs when using less active catalysts,however, would indicate that, regardless of where the actual CHx coupling takes place, the key step involves CHxS* bond weakening to generate the active intermediates. Although we will explicitly discuss the coupling of CHxS* species on the surface, the results are essentially the same if the coupling occurs in the gas phase, as the desorption rate of CH3 · radicals from the surface is inversely related to the CH3S* bond strength and linearly related to the MS bond strengths.
First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to help understand the reaction pathways and mechanisms, the nature of the active catalytic sites and the effects of the catalyst, as well as the reaction conditions on methane conver- sion and the selective formation of ethylene. Details concerning the computational methods used, as well as the results for the initial activation of methane, the subsequent CH activation of other CHxS* intermediates, the coupling of surface hydrocarbon inter- mediates (CHxS*) to form ethylene, and the desorption of CHx species from the surfaces are discussed in Supplementary Sections B1, B2. The coupling of CHx intermediates was explored on the surface as well as in the gas phase.
Detailed structural optimizations were carried out on the close- packed 111, 100 and 110 surfaces of MoS2, RuS2, TiS2 and PdS over a range of sulfur coverages to establish the lowest energy struc- tures of the surfaces at different temperatures and CH4/S ratios. The results for these model MoS2, RuS2, TiS2 and PdS surfaces (shown in Supplementary Fig. S5) were used to determine the most favourable surface termination at specific sulfur chemical potentials and temperatures. As has been shown previously for methane oxi- dation, the chemical potential sets the composition of the surface as well as the nature of the active surface sites40,41. The lowest energy states and compositions for all of these structures were sub- sequently used to calculate the reaction energies and barriers for methane activation and the subsequent coupling of hydrocarbon fragments to form ethylene. These results suggest that under nearly all experimental conditions, MoS2, RuS2, TiS2 and PdS are highly sulfided and the active sites comprise SS pairs. The sole exception, as will be discussed below, occurs at high temperatures and high CH4/S ratios where theory and experiment indicate that PdS is reduced to Pd16S7.
The rate of methane conversion is controlled by the activation of the initial CH3H bond, whereas catalytic selectivity for ethylene is controlled by the rate of coupling of two bound methylene (CH2S*) fragments to form ethylene versus the rate of further CH bond activation to ultimately form CS2. The calculated transition states for CH3H activation over SS sites and the coupling of CH2S* fragments to form ethylene are shown in Fig. 3 and involve charac- teristic hydrogen abstraction and reductive CC formation steps,respectively. Both reactions are strongly influenced by the MS bond strength, which sets the basicity and reactivity of the surface sulfur sites. Weaker MS bonds can readily abstract hydrogen and bind the resulting methyl groups more strongly, thus enhancing the activation of methane, whereas strong MS bonds result in weaker CS bonds, which enhance CC coupling and increase the selectivity to form ethylene. The barriers for both the CH bond activation of methane and the subsequent coupling of CH2 surface intermediates to form ethylene appear to be linearly related to the MS bond strength, as shown in Fig. 4.

Although entropy has a significant effect on the reaction rate at high reaction temperatures, the changes in entropy that result from changes in the sulfide are very small and can be neglected without loss of generality. Methane activation is governed by a hydrogen abstraction, for which the reactant and transition-state structures for all of the sulfides examined were nearly identical.
Methane conversion is clearly governed by the MS bond strength. Sulfides with weaker MS bonds result in more basic and reactive sulfur sites that can readily abstract hydrogen in the transition state and bind the resulting CH3 and hydrogen inter- mediates. Subsequent CH activations of the resulting CHx* species have lower activation barriers and more favourable acti- vation entropies than those for methane, and are therefore more reactive. As such, metal sulfides with weaker MS bonds will not only readily activate the CH bond of methane, but will continue on to activate the CH bonds of the subsequent CHx fragments and ultimately mediate over-oxidation to CS2. The calculations for CH activation at CH3*S, CH2*S and CH*S sites on MoS2 yield barriers of 119, 63 and 178 kJ mol21, respectively,which are significantly lower than the initial 184 kJ mol21 barrier for methane activation.
In contrast to these results, computed trends in the methane-to- ethylene selectivity are inversely related to MS bond strength, as also shown in Fig. 4, where the barriers for ethylene formation decrease as MoS2 . RuS2 . PdS . TiS2. These results are consistent with the experimental results shown in Fig. 2b at temperatures below 1,175 K, with the exception that PdS is only slightly more selective than TiS2. Similar results for selectivity are found if the
CH3
· radicals desorb from the surface and recombine in the gas phase to form ethane, because the CH3 · desorption barriers are lin- early correlated with the CH2S* coupling barriers, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S12. The barriers to activate the CH bonds of CH3S* intermediates and subsequently couple the CH2S* species to form ethylene are both lower than the barriers for CH3 · radical desorption, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S12. This suggests that CH2S* coupling on the surface is more favourable than the desorption and gas-phase coupling of CH3 · radicals.
A more detailed analysis of the CH bond activation steps versus the CH2S*...CH2S* coupling reactions indicates that the MS bond becomes sufficiently strong in PdS and TiS2 to begin to reverse the driving force to over-oxidize to CS2 and instead increases the likelihood of CH2S* coupling to form ethylene. On PdS, the barrier to CH2S* coupling to form ethylene is 183 kJ mol21,which is only 50 kJ mol21 greater than the barrier to activate the CH bond of CH2S* (134 kJ mol21). Note, however, that the change in entropy for CH2S* coupling is significantly more favour- able than that for CH bond activation. At higher temperatures,both steps become favourable. On TiS2, the CH2S* coupling process is computed to be far more favourable than the CH acti- vation of CH2S* species.
Further examination of the experimental results in Fig. 2b indi- cates that although the selectivity to ethylene increases with increas- ing temperature for all of the sulfides, the results for PdS are characteristically different because the selectivity increases far more dramatically with temperature than for the other sulfides.
As can be seen in Fig. 2a, there also appears to be a distinct change in the relative experimental ordering of methane activation over the different metal sulfides at temperatures above 1,150 K.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data for the PdS catalyst before and after operation at high temperatures are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A and compared with PDF (Powder Diffraction File) database spectra for PdS (Supplementary Fig. S2B) and Pd16S7 (Supplementary Fig. S2C). These data suggest that the bulk of the PdS is reduced to Pd16S7 under catalytic reaction conditions.
Similar XRD characterization of the initial and spent MoS2 catalysts (Supplementary Fig. S3) reveals that these remain unchanged under all reaction conditions.
The CH4/S ratio is found to be a critical parameter governing selectivity in the present catalytic conversions over PdS. The experimental results in Fig. 5a show that over-oxidation of methane to CS2 is suppressed at high CH4/S ratios, thereby enhancing ethylene selectivity. In reactant streams with CH4/S ratios less than 1:1, ethylene formation is suppressed, and CS2 is the only observed carbon-containing product. The dependence of selectivity on the CH4/S ratio logically follows because over- oxidation is stoichiometrically more favourable at high oxidant concentrations. The increasing ethylene selectivity with increasing CH4/S over PdS is consistent with the experimental results presented in Fig. 2b, which show a significant increase in selectivity with increasing temperature. Both higher temperatures and higher CH4/S ratios lead to the reduction of PdS to Pd16S7. The results clearly show that the more reduced Pd16S7 state is less active but significantly more selective for ethylene.

To increase catalyst dispersion and possibly enhance catalytic performance,a ZrO2-supported 10 wt% palladium catalyst (Pd/ZrO2) was synthesized and evaluated. As can be seen in Fig. 6, both methane conversion and ethylene selectivity are sig- nificantly enhanced over those for bulk PdS, with ethylene selec- tivity now approaching 20%. Considering that the palladium loading in Pd/ZrO2 catalysts is 10% that of bulk PdS catalysts,we infer that Pd/ZrO2 exhibits significantly higher efficiency in methane conversion to ethylene. Furthermore, examination using XRD indicates that the palladium in Pd/ZrO2 is converted to Pd16S7 after 2 h on stream (Supplementary Fig. S4B), in agree- ment with the observation that, after a short initial period, Pd/ZrO2 catalytic performance is stable for at least 24 h (Supplementary Fig. S4A).DFT-computed phase diagrams for Pd16S7 (Supplementary Fig. S15) indicate that higher temperatures and higher CH4/S ratios result in stable sulfur-terminated 110 and 111 surfaces that expose PdS site pairs with MS bond strengths of 167 kJ mol21,which is 55 kJ mol21 greater than the MS bond strengths on PdS. Despite the stronger MS bonding, methane can be readily activated at the PdS sites in a four-centre transition state via a s- bond metathesis-type mechanism (Supplementary Fig. S17) with a barrier of 166 kJ mol21. Although the initial methane molecule is activated at this site and continues to form CH2*, the coupling of two CH2* surface intermediates requires the activation of a second methane molecule at a vicinal SS site pair. The large Pd S bond strength at these vicinal SS sites increases the methane acti- vation barriers at these sites to 241 kJ mol21 (Supplementary Fig. S16), which is 34 kJ mol21 greater than for the PdS bonds present on the PdS surface. These strong MS bonds also signifi- cantly weaken the CH2S* bonding and lower the barriers for sub- sequent coupling of the CH2S* intermediates to form ethylene (Supplementary Fig.
S18)
to only 103 kJ mol21,which is 80 kJ mol21 lower than that on PdS. This situation significantly enhances the selectivity to ethylene on the reduced Pd16S7 surface compared with that on the other metal sulfides examined, and raises important implications for future catalyst design.
The resulting CH activation and CH2CH2 coupling barriers over the Pd16S7 surface
SS
pairs track very closely the aforementioned linear correlation with MS bond strength, and are plotted together with the barriers for all the highly sulfided sur- faces in Fig. 4. The resulting barriers are fully consistent with the experimental results, showing that the Pd16S7 catalytic material has lower activity than the other sulfides but proceeds with mark- edly higher selectivity to ethylene at higher temperatures (Fig. 1) and at higher CH4/S ratios (Fig. 5).
To better understand the methane over-oxidation pathways in the present catalytic systems, methane conversion and ethylene selectivity over the PdS catalysts were also studied as a function of weight hour space velocity (WHSV; Fig. 5b). At high WHSV,where the residence time in the catalyst bed is short, selectivity to ethylene is significantly enhanced, but over-oxidation to CS2 becomes more pronounced at longer residence times and is reason- ably attributable to follow-up reactions of ethylene with S2 to form
CS2. This scenario was verified in control experiments.
Conclusions The results reported here demonstrate that sulfur is a promising soft oxidant for the heterogeneous catalytic conversion of methane to ethylene because the MS bonds are significantly stron- ger than the MO bonds in the corresponding O2 oxidations. Lower (more controlled) conversions of methane as well as higher selectiv- ities of methane to ethylene conversion are observed here on sulfides with the strongest surface MS bonds. High CH4/S ratios and high WHSVs promote favourable conversion selectivity to ethylene and suppress undesired over-oxidation pathways. MoS2, RuS2, TiS2 and PdS are effective catalysts for methane conversion to ethylene and/or CS2 using sulfur as the oxidant. However, activity and selec- tivity are strongly catalyst-dependent, with the partially reduced PdS in the form of bulk or ZrO2-supported Pd16S7 exhibiting the highest selectivity. Although the selectivities to ethylene in these prelimi- nary experiments are currently modest, it is likely that they will be increased substantially following optimization of conditions and catalysts. These results demonstrate that metal sulfides and, more generally, transition-metal chalcogenides, offer the ability to sub- stantially control the conversion and selective oxidation of methane to ethylene by sulfur. Furthermore, using S2 as the oxidant rather than O2 should suppress the dramatic temperature excursions that occur in oxidative methane coupling with O2,because the S2 reactions are nearly thermoneutral. This should therefore relax engineering constraints associated with heat removal. Note also that the H2S produced in the present catalytic coupling can be used to regenerate the sulfur feedstock by means of the efficient, industrially practised Claus process43:
2H2S + O2  S2 + 2H2O
In essence, sulfur serves in the present approach as a redox mediator for O2 oxidation.
Methods A custom heterogeneous catalytic reactor (fabricated by Altamira Instruments) was designed for using elemental sulfur as a gaseous reactant for the oxidative coupling of methane. Typical reactions were carried out between 1,073 and 1,323 K with a 5% methane stream, using argon as the balance gas. Blank tests were carried out under identical reaction conditions using an empty reactor filled with quartz chips. The metal sulfide catalysts MoS2, TiS2, RuS2 and PdS were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich and Alfa Aesar, and were used without further purification. The WHSV was varied between 6,000 and 30,000 ml h21 g21 by adjusting the amount of catalyst in the reactor from 500 to 100 mg. All the reactions were carried out under ambient pressure. Reaction products were monitored online and quantified using a gas chromatograph with flame photometric detection (FPD), thermal conductivity detection (TCD) and flame ionization detection (FID) detectors. A more detailed description of the reaction setup and catalyst characterization is provided in Supplementary Sections A1, A2.
