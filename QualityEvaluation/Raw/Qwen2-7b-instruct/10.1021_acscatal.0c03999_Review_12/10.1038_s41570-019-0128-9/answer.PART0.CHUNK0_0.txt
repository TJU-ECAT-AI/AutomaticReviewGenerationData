[1] "Unlike CH4 (ref.2), these light alkanes contain CC bonds that can be dehydrogenated to produce C2H4, C3H6 and C4H8 isomers (denoted
C2
=, C3
= and C4 =, respectively), as well as 1,3-butadiene."
[2] "The demand for these alkenes is high because they are important petrochemical building blocks."
[3] "However, the conventional routes to produce the alkenes  thermal
steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation (DD) require high operating temperatures and often suffer from severe catalyst coking problems due to over- oxidation and cracking3,4."
[4] "Alternatively, light alkenes can be catalytically produced from non- petroleum resources, such as coal and natural gas."
[5] "More specifically, if we were to source our C2H4 from the CO2-ODH of C2H6, the reaction would offset 9.8% of total global chemical industry CO2 emissions per year and would consume only 0.026% of total global natural gas reserves11, assuming that their C2H6 content is at least1% v/v1."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes with CO2 as the oxidant offers a unique pathway for producing alkenes, which are crucial in petrochemical industries. Unlike methane, which contains only C-H bonds, alkanes with C-C bonds can be dehydrogenated to generate alkenes (C=C), alkynes (C≡C), and even 1,3-butadiene. The demand for alkenes is high due to their pivotal role as building blocks in petrochemical applications. Traditional methods of alkene production, such as steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation, are limited by high operating temperatures and often suffer from catalyst deactivation issues, particularly due to over-oxidation and cracking. An alternative route involves using non-petroleum resources, such as coal and natural gas. Specifically, the ODH of propane (C2H6) with CO2 can significantly reduce global chemical industry CO2 emissions, accounting for 9.8% annually, and consume merely 0.026% of the total global natural gas reserves, assuming at least 1% v/v of propane in the natural gas mixture. This highlights the potential environmental benefits of utilizing CO2-ODH processes for alkene production.

烷烃中的C-C键可以通过与二氧化碳反应脱氢生成烯烃（C=C），炔烃（C≡C）以及甚至1,3-丁二烯。烯烃因其在石油化工领域的关键作用而需求量大。传统的烷基生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和直接脱氢，受限于高操作温度，并且经常面临催化剂失活的问题，特别是由于过氧化和裂解导致的。另一种途径是利用非石油资源，如煤炭和天然气。具体来说，丙烷（C2H6）与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢可以显著减少全球化学工业的二氧化碳排放，每年达到9.8%，并且仅消耗总全球天然气储备的0.026%，前提是天然气中至少有1%体积的丙烷。这凸显了利用二氧化碳氧化脱氢过程进行烯烃生产的环境优势。
