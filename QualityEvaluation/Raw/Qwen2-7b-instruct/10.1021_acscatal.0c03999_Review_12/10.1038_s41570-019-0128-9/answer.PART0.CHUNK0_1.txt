[2] "In the CO2-ODH reaction, CO2 is a mild oxidant that is not prone to over- oxidizing substrates and does not form an explosive reactive mixture (unlike O2 in the O2-ODH)."
[3] "Relative to direct dehydrogenation, the introduction of CO2 alters the pathway by providing an O atom that combines with the H atoms from the alkane to give H2O, consequently lowering ΔG for the reaction and making the reaction feasible at a lower operating temperature."
[4] "One must also consider that CO2 can mod- ify the surface and/or bulk composition of a catalyst,and these changes in redox, adsorption and electronic properties can influence activity and selectivity12,13."
