[1] "The most prevalent catalysts for CO2-ODH of light alkanes are oxides3,24 of Cr (refs2931), V (refs3234), Ga (refs35,36) and, to a lesser extent, In (refs37,38) and Co (refs3941)."
[2] "Cr oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH can give high C2H6 conversions even after short reaction times, but the selectivity for CO2 conversion is low and the catalysts have short life cycles because they are unstable towards coking52."
[3] "Ga oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH differ from those described above because the former are typically not redox-active over the relevant potential range and the catalysts operate through heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2 (refs49,79,80)."
[4] "Among In2O3/MOx bimetallic, mixed-oxide catalysts (M=Al, Zn, Zr, Ti, Fe, Mg, Si and Ce)77, In2O3/CeO2 has the lowest CO2-ODH activity77,despite its reported utility in catalysing the RWGS reaction when synthesized as a In2O3CeO2 mixture78."
[5] "Ga oxides outperform Cr and V oxides, but the unsup-ported materials still exhibit low stability and tolerance to coking and the supported materials bind CO2 too strongly relative to alkanes."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as chromium (Cr), vanadium (V), gallium (Ga), indium (In), and cobalt (Co), are capable of transferring electrons between the alkane and CO2 molecules, facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation process. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, like gallium oxide (Ga2O3), do not undergo redox reactions but rather rely on heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, depending on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. For instance, chromium oxide catalysts are efficient in converting propane to propylene with CO2 as an oxidant, but they have low selectivity for CO2 conversion and short lifespans due to instability towards coking. Gallium oxide catalysts, while not redox-active, demonstrate high initial C2H6 selectivity but face issues with stability and tolerance to coking. In the case of indium oxide catalysts, despite their reported utility in catalyzing the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, they exhibit low CO2-ODH activity compared to other catalysts. Gallium oxides, on the other hand, outperform chromium and vanadium oxides in certain aspects, but they still exhibit low stability and tolerance to coking. Transition metal clusters, when supported on inert supports like CeO2, can offer enhanced CO2-ODH selectivity and stability by providing a platform for the activation of CO2 and selective C-H bond cleavage.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢反应中，活性氧还原和非活性氧还原金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化机制存在显著差异。活性氧还原催化剂，如铬（Cr）、钒（V）、镓（Ga）、铟（In）和钴（Co），能够通过电子转移在烷烃和CO2分子之间进行氧化脱氢过程。相比之下，非活性氧还原催化剂，如镓氧化物（Ga2O3），不进行氧化还原反应，而是依赖于烷烃的异裂解和CO2的激活。不同催化剂在丙烷的氧化脱氢过程中激活CO2的有效性因提出的机制和CO2分解能壁垒而异。例如，铬氧化物催化剂在将丙烷转化为丙烯时效率高，但CO2转化选择性低且寿命短，由于它们对焦化的不稳定性。镓氧化物催化剂虽然初始C2H6选择性高，但在稳定性和焦化耐受性方面存在问题。对于含铟氧化物催化剂而言，尽管它们在催化逆水煤气变换反应中表现出优势，但其CO2-ODH活性却比其他催化剂低。镓氧化物在某些方面优于铬和钒氧化物，但仍然存在低稳定性和焦化耐受性的问题。当过渡金属簇被支持在惰性支持体如CeO2上时，可以提供一个平台来激活CO2并实现选择性的C-H键断裂，从而增强CO2-ODH选择性和稳定性。
