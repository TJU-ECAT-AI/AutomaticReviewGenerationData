[1] "Unlike CH4 (ref.2), these light alkanes contain CC bonds that can be dehydrogen- ated to produce C2H4, C3H6 and C4H8 isomers (denoted C2=, C3= and C4 =, respectively), as well as 1,3-butadiene."
[2] "The demand for these alkenes is high because they are important petrochemical building blocks."
[3] "However, the conventional routes to produce the alkenes  thermal steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation (DD) require high operating temperatures and often suffer from severe catalyst coking problems due to over- oxidation and cracking3,4."
[4] "Alternatively, light alkenes can be catalytically produced from non- petroleum resources, such as coal and natural gas."
[5] "This motivates the search for alternative routes to alkenes, which brings us to reac- tions in which CO2 effects oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) of light alkanes  approaches that involve CO2 reduction to CO in tandem with alkane dehydro- genation to the corresponding alkene (or diene)."
[6] "In the CO2-ODH reaction, CO2 is a mild oxidant that is not prone to over- oxidizing substrates and does not form an explosive reactive mixture (unlike O2 in the O2-ODH)."
[7] "The CO2-ODH reaction requires a bifunctional catalyst that dissociates CO2 into CO and a reactive oxygen species *O (the asterisk notation denotes a surface- bound moiety)12,14."
[8] "In the case of CO2-ODH of C3H8 over zeolites and Cr, V, Ga and In oxides, the high temperatures at which alkane conversion is thermo dynamically favoured also favour CC scission over CH scission, thereby substantially lowering selectivity for the desired alkene24,25."
[9] "The Ga2O3/MxOy catalysts are effective for CO2 acti- vation but bind alkanes at acidic sites that can induce cracking16  CC cleavage reactions that lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation17."
[10] "These results high- light how we presently lack active and stable bifunctional CO2-ODH catalysts."
[11] "Our thermodynamics analyses afforded plots of ΔG versus T, where T is temperature, for CO2-effected oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH), dry reforming (DR) and direct dehydrogenation (DD) of C2H6, as well as the RWGS reaction, the reverse Boudouard reaction and the CO2-ODH of C3H8 and C4H10 (Fig.1b)."
[12] "The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on whether the catalyst is supported onAl2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 or CexZr1xO2 (ref.46)."
[13] "CrOx/γ- Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibit the highest ODHE activities but operate through different pathways."
[14] "Thus, CrOx/γ- Al2O3 primarily works by the two- step DDE and RWGS mechanism, and can undergo deactiva- tion if cracking affords substantial coke."
[15] "The activation of CO2 over CrOx dispersed in MCM-41 has been attributed to isolated Crvi centres generated from Criii in a redox cycle5559 (Fig.2b)."
[16] "The role of CO2 over Ga- based catalysts is largely dependent on the support."
[17] "So, we can say that Ga oxides outperform Cr and V oxides, but the unsup- ported materials still exhibit low stability and tolerance to coking and the supported materials bind CO2 too strongly relative to alkanes."
[18] "The conversion of C2H6 has been inves- tigated over CeO2-supported bimetallic catalysts Co3Pt1, Co3Mo1, Ni3Mo1 and Fe3Ni1 (note that, throughout this Review, the formulae denote element ratios and do not"

[21] "The calculations illustrate that both systems should energetically favour CH scission (as part of CO2- ODH) over CC scission (for DRP), although opposite behaviour was predicted for Pt- terminated Ni3Pt(111)."
[22] "These results also show that the binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt- terminated Ni3Pt(111) are similar, and all intermediates bind more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface."
[23] "Supporting Fe3Ni1 on different oxides illustrates that Ni(111) highly reducible supports with mobile lattice O atoms,such as CeO2 and CeO2ZrO2, favour the production of 1,3-butadiene, whereas ZrO2 suppresses oxidative dehydrogenation activity."

Answer: 

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes involves the breakdown of C-H bonds to produce alkenes, utilizing a mild oxidant like CO2. This contrasts with conventional methods that use high temperatures and often result in severe catalyst coking problems. CO2-ODH offers a cleaner alternative for producing alkenes from alkanes.

2. CO2-ODH reactions require a bifunctional catalyst capable of activating CO2 and dehydrogenating alkanes. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, not prone to over-oxidizing substrates or forming explosive mixtures.

3. Catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2 can activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation. However, V2O5 catalysts typically operate through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, improving alkene selectivity with V2O5/CeO2 ZrO2 in the CO2-ODH of C4H10.

4. Ga2O3 catalysts for CO2-ODH differ, as they are not redox-active over the relevant potential range. They activate CO2 and alkanes through heterolytic dissociation, which differs from the approach of redox-active catalysts.

5. Transition metal clusters like Fe3Ni1/CeO2 offer high C2H4 selectivity for CO2-ODH, suggesting distinct active sites where Fe interacts with Ni. This cluster has been shown to outperform others in terms of stability and selectivity.

6. Bimetallic catalysts, such as Co3Pt1 and Fe3Ni1, can enhance CO2-ODH selectivity by promoting selective CH cleavage rather than CC cleavage, which is advantageous for alkene production.

7. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts have metallic Ni and oxidized Fe sites, with the oxidized Fe facilitating selective CH scission and forming C2H4. The presence of FeCe bonding and fewer coordinated O atoms indicates the nature of the oxidized Fe species.

8. DFT calculations predict that the NiFeOx interface on Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts is active for dehydrogenation of C2H6, contributing to the high CO2-ODH selectivity.

9. Metal carbides, like Mo2C, are attractive for CO2-ODH reactions due to their ability to activate CO2 and alkanes. However, they face challenges like high initial activity and susceptibility to deactivation.

10. Catalysts like Fe3Ni1/CeO2 can favor the production of 1,3-butadiene over other alkenes, depending on the oxide support used. CeO2 supports, for instance, can lead to more selective production of 1,3-butadiene.

11. The CO2-ODH process produces a mixture of alkenes, H2O, CO, and CO2, which complicates separation. Reactive separation methods or novel reactor designs might be necessary for scale-up.

12. Scale-up of CO2-ODH processes will require targeted synthesis of specific active sites and optimization of catalysts for better alkene yields and selectivity.

13. Oxidative dehydrogenation coupled with CO2 reduction holds promise for producing alkenes while reducing CO2 emissions. Challenges include catalyst development and finding optimal synthesis techniques.

14. CO2-ODH reactions can produce alkenes alongside H2O, CO, and CO2, which complicates separation. Reactive separation methods or novel reactor designs are needed for efficient scale-up.

15. CO2-ODH can be used to produce acrylic acids and acrylates in a one-step process, replacing energy-intensive methodologies. This would reduce the environmental impact of chemical production.

16. The tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and CO2-ODH of light alkanes have potential for satisfying global alkene production needs while consuming underutilized fractions of shale gas and lowering CO2 emissions.

17. The design of catalysts that give rise to improved alkene yields remains a challenge. Combining experimental and theoretical methods can help identify active sites and mechanisms for selective CO2-ODH.

18. The correlation between O storage capacity/mobility and alkene yields is not well understood. Further examination of oxide supports in CO2-ODH catalysts could aid in optimizing both activity and selectivity.

19. The tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and CO2-ODH of light alkanes offer a promising avenue for producing alkenes while eliminating CO2 emissions. Addressing challenges such as catalyst development and product separation is crucial for large-scale implementation.
