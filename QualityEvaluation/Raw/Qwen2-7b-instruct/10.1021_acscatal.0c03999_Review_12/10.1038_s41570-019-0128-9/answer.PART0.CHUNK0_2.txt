1. Cr oxide catalysts show highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials rich in SiO2, like SiO2, siliceous MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5. As CO2 partial pressure rises, CrOx/SiO2 becomes more active and selective for C3H6 production, compared to CrOx/γ-Al2O3 which decreases in activity with minor CO2 pressure increase.

2. Flow reactor experiments on CO2-ODH of propane (CO2-ODHP) at 873K showed that CrOx/SiO2 catalysts increase in activity and C3H6 selectivity with higher CO2 partial pressure, whereas CrOx/γ-Al2O3 decreases in activity even with a slight increase in CO2 pressure.

3. For CO2-ODH of C2H6, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst offers the highest C2H4 selectivity over 75%, while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 yields the highest CO with over 98% selectivity via dry reforming.

4. Insitu XANES measurements reveal that Ni centers in FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts are metallic, while Fe exists predominantly as FeOx.

5. Through flow reactor analysis, we can distinguish catalyst systems that selectively break C2H6 CH bonds to form C2H4, from those that break CC bonds to produce only CO.

1.CR氧化催化剂在SiO2含量丰富的材料（如SiO2、硅质MCM-41和H-ZSM-5）上表现出最高活性和选择性。随着CO2分压的增加，CrOx/SiO2催化剂在C3H6生产上的活性和选择性增加，而CrOx/γ-Al2O3的活性则随CO2分压的轻微增加而降低。

2. 在873K下进行CO2-ODHP实验显示，随着CO2分压的提高，CrOx/SiO2催化剂的活性和C3H6选择性增加，而CrOx/γ-Al2O3的活性则在CO2分压略有增加时下降。

3. 对于CO2-ODH的C2H6，Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂提供了超过75%的C2H4选择性，而Fe1Ni3/CeO2则以超过98%的选择性通过干重整产生CO。

4. 原位XANES测量表明，FexNiy/CeO2催化剂中的Ni中心为金属态，而Fe主要以FeOx形式存在。

5. 通过流反应分析，我们可以区分出那些能选择性断裂C2H6 CH键形成C2H4的催化剂系统，与那些断裂CC键仅产生CO的系统。
