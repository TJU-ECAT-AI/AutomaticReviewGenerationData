The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes with CO2 as the oxidant offers a unique pathway for producing alkenes, which are crucial in petrochemical industries. Unlike methane, which contains only C-H bonds, alkanes with C-C bonds can be dehydrogenated to generate alkenes (C=C), alkynes (C≡C), and even 1,3-butadiene. The demand for alkenes is high due to their pivotal role as building blocks in petrochemical applications. Traditional methods of alkene production, such as steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation, are limited by high operating temperatures and often suffer from catalyst deactivation issues, particularly due to over-oxidation and cracking. An alternative route involves using non-petroleum resources, such as coal and natural gas. Specifically, the ODH of propane (C2H6) with CO2 can significantly reduce global chemical industry CO2 emissions, accounting for 9.8% annually, and consume merely 0.026% of the total global natural gas reserves, assuming at least 1% v/v of propane in the natural gas mixture. This highlights the potential environmental benefits of utilizing CO2-ODH processes for alkene production.

烷烃中的C-C键可以通过与二氧化碳反应脱氢生成烯烃（C=C），炔烃（C≡C）以及甚至1,3-丁二烯。烯烃因其在石油化工领域的关键作用而需求量大。传统的烷基生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和直接脱氢，受限于高操作温度，并且经常面临催化剂失活的问题，特别是由于过氧化和裂解导致的。另一种途径是利用非石油资源，如煤炭和天然气。具体来说，丙烷（C2H6）与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢可以显著减少全球化学工业的二氧化碳排放，每年达到9.8%，并且仅消耗总全球天然气储备的0.026%，前提是天然气中至少有1%体积的丙烷。这凸显了利用二氧化碳氧化脱氢过程进行烯烃生产的环境优势。

1. Cr oxide catalysts show highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials rich in SiO2, like SiO2, siliceous MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5.

2. Flow reactor experiments on CO2-ODH of propane (CO2-ODHP) at 873K showed that CrOx/SiO2 catalysts increase in activity and C3H6 selectivity with higher CO2 partial pressure, whereas CrOx/γ-Al2O3 decreases in activity even with a slight increase in CO2 pressure.

[1] "The most prevalent catalysts for CO2-ODH of light alkanes are oxides3,24 of Cr (refs2931), V (refs3234), Ga (refs35,36) and, to a lesser extent, In (refs37,38) and Co (refs3941)."
[2] "Cr oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH can give high C2H6 conversions even after short reaction times, but the selectivity for CO2 conversion is low and the catalysts have short life cycles because they are unstable towards coking52."
[3] "Ga oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH differ from those described above because the former are typically not redox-active over the relevant potential range and the catalysts operate through heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2 (refs49,79,80)."
[4] "Among In2O3/MOx bimetallic, mixed-oxide catalysts (M=Al, Zn, Zr, Ti, Fe, Mg, Si and Ce)77, In2O3/CeO2 has the lowest CO2-ODH activity77,despite its reported utility in catalysing the RWGS reaction when synthesized as a In2O3CeO2 mixture78."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as chromium (Cr), vanadium (V), gallium (Ga), indium (In), and cobalt (Co), are capable of transferring electrons between the alkane and CO2 molecules, facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation process. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, like gallium oxide (Ga2O3), do not undergo redox reactions but rather rely on heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, depending on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. For instance, chromium oxide catalysts are efficient in converting propane to propylene with CO2 as an oxidant, but they have low selectivity for CO2 conversion and short lifespans due to instability towards coking. Gallium oxide catalysts, while not redox-active, demonstrate high initial C2H6 selectivity but face issues with stability and tolerance to coking. In the case of indium oxide catalysts, despite their reported utility in catalyzing the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, they exhibit low CO2-ODH activity compared to other catalysts. Gallium oxides, on the other hand, outperform chromium and vanadium oxides in certain aspects, but they still exhibit low stability and tolerance to coking. Transition metal clusters, when supported on inert supports like CeO2, can offer enhanced CO2-ODH selectivity and stability by providing a platform for the activation of CO2 and selective C-H bond cleavage.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢反应中，活性氧还原和非活性氧还原金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化机制存在显著差异。活性氧还原催化剂，如铬（Cr）、钒（V）、镓（Ga）、铟（In）和钴（Co），能够通过电子转移在烷烃和CO2分子之间进行氧化脱氢过程。相比之下，非活性氧还原催化剂，如镓氧化物（Ga2O3），不进行氧化还原反应，而是依赖于烷烃的异裂解和CO2的激活。不同催化剂在丙烷的氧化脱氢过程中激活CO2的有效性因提出的机制和CO2分解能壁垒而异。例如，铬氧化物催化剂在将丙烷转化为丙烯时效率高，但CO2转化选择性低且寿命短，由于它们对焦化的不稳定性。镓氧化物催化剂虽然初始C2H6选择性高，但在稳定性和焦化耐受性方面存在问题。对于含铟氧化物催化剂而言，尽管它们在催化逆水煤气变换反应中表现出优势，但其CO2-ODH活性却比其他催化剂低。镓氧化物在某些方面优于铬和钒氧化物，但仍然存在低稳定性和焦化耐受性的问题。当过渡金属簇被支持在惰性支持体如CeO2上时，可以提供一个平台来激活CO2并实现选择性的C-H键断裂，从而增强CO2-ODH选择性和稳定性。

Answer: 

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes involves the breakdown of C-H bonds to produce alkenes, utilizing a mild oxidant like CO2. This contrasts with conventional methods that use high temperatures and often result in severe catalyst coking problems. CO2-ODH offers a cleaner alternative for producing alkenes from alkanes.

2. CO2-ODH reactions require a bifunctional catalyst capable of activating CO2 and dehydrogenating alkanes. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, not prone to over-oxidizing substrates or forming explosive mixtures.

3. Catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2 can activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation. However, V2O5 catalysts typically operate through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, improving alkene selectivity with V2O5/CeO2 ZrO2 in the CO2-ODH of C4H10.

4. Ga2O3 catalysts for CO2-ODH differ, as they are not redox-active over the relevant potential range. They activate CO2 and alkanes through heterolytic dissociation, which differs from the approach of redox-active catalysts.

5. Transition metal clusters like Fe3Ni1/CeO2 offer high C2H4 selectivity for CO2-ODH, suggesting distinct active sites where Fe interacts with Ni. This cluster has been shown to outperform others in terms of stability and selectivity.

6. Bimetallic catalysts, such as Co3Pt1 and Fe3Ni1, can enhance CO2-ODH selectivity by promoting selective CH cleavage rather than CC cleavage, which is advantageous for alkene production.

7. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts have metallic Ni and oxidized Fe sites, with the oxidized Fe facilitating selective CH scission and forming C2H4. The presence of FeCe bonding and fewer coordinated O atoms indicates the nature of the oxidized Fe species.

8. DFT calculations predict that the NiFeOx interface on Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts is active for dehydrogenation of C2H6, contributing to the high CO2-ODH selectivity.

9. Metal carbides, like Mo2C, are attractive for CO2-ODH reactions due to their ability to activate CO2 and alkanes. However, they face challenges like high initial activity and susceptibility to deactivation.

10. Catalysts like Fe3Ni1/CeO2 can favor the production of 1,3-butadiene over other alkenes, depending on the oxide support used. CeO2 supports, for instance, can lead to more selective production of 1,3-butadiene.

11. The CO2-ODH process produces a mixture of alkenes, H2O, CO, and CO2, which complicates separation. Reactive separation methods or novel reactor designs might be necessary for scale-up.

12. Scale-up of CO2-ODH processes will require targeted synthesis of specific active sites and optimization of catalysts for better alkene yields and selectivity.

13. Oxidative dehydrogenation coupled with CO2 reduction holds promise for producing alkenes while reducing CO2 emissions. Challenges include catalyst development and finding optimal synthesis techniques.

14. CO2-ODH reactions can produce alkenes alongside H2O, CO, and CO2, which complicates separation. Reactive separation methods or novel reactor designs are needed for efficient scale-up.

15. CO2-ODH can be used to produce acrylic acids and acrylates in a one-step process, replacing energy-intensive methodologies. This would reduce the environmental impact of chemical production.

16. The tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and CO2-ODH of light alkanes have potential for satisfying global alkene production needs while consuming underutilized fractions of shale gas and lowering CO2 emissions.

17. The design of catalysts that give rise to improved alkene yields remains a challenge. Combining experimental and theoretical methods can help identify active sites and mechanisms for selective CO2-ODH.

18. The correlation between O storage capacity/mobility and alkene yields is not well understood. Further examination of oxide supports in CO2-ODH catalysts could aid in optimizing both activity and selectivity.

19. The tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and CO2-ODH of light alkanes offer a promising avenue for producing alkenes while eliminating CO2 emissions. Addressing challenges such as catalyst development and product separation is crucial for large-scale implementation.

2. 二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应需要双功能催化剂，能够激活二氧化碳并使烷烃脱氢。二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂，不易过度氧化基质或形成爆炸性混合物。

3. 比如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2等催化剂可以激活二氧化碳进行氧化脱氢。然而，V2O5催化剂通常通过Marsvan Krevelen机制运行，在CO2-ODH的C4H10中，V2O5/CeO2 ZrO2表现出改善的烯烃选择性。

4. 铟（In）2O3催化剂在非活性条件下，二氧化碳的活化和烷烃的活化通过异裂解进行，与活性氧化剂催化剂的方法不同。

5. 类似于Fe3Ni1/CeO2这样的过渡金属簇可以在CO2-ODH中提供高C2H4选择性，表明Fe与Ni之间存在特定活性位点，促进选择性的C-H断裂而非C-C断裂，这对于烯烃生产是有利的。

6. 双金属催化剂，如Co3Pt1和Fe3Ni1，可以通过促进C-H断裂而不是C-C断裂来增强CO2-ODH选择性，从而有利于烯烃生产。

7. Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂具有金属态Ni和氧化态Fe，氧化态Fe有助于选择性的C-H断裂并形成C2H4。Fe-Ce结合以及较少协调的O原子表明氧化态Fe物种的性质。

8. 第一原理计算预测Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂上的NiFeOx界面是C2H6脱氢的活性位点，这解释了其高CO2-ODH选择性。

9. 类似于Mo2C的金属碳化物对于CO2-ODH反应具有吸引力，因为它们能够激活CO2和烷烃。然而，它们面临挑战，如初始活性高和容易失效的问题。

10. Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂可能会倾向于生成1,3-丁二烯而非其他烯烃，这取决于所使用的氧化物支持。例如，CeO2支持可以导致更选择性地生成1,3-丁二烯。
