The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as vanadia (V2O5) and vanadyl oxide (VOx/SiO2), typically involve a redox cycle where the catalyst is oxidized by the alkane and then reduced by a traditional oxidant, usually molecular oxygen (O2), leading to the regeneration of the active surface. This process facilitates the activation of the C-H bonds in alkanes, leading to the formation of olefins.

Redox-inactive catalysts, on the other hand, such as ceria (CeO2) and transition metal clusters, activate the C-H bonds through a different mechanism. They do not undergo a redox cycle and instead rely on the intrinsic properties of the surface, often involving heterolytic cleavage of the C-H bond. For instance, the proposed mechanism for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over a boron nitride (BN) catalyst involves the activation of the C-H bond through heterolytic cleavage over a BO pair in a BO3 active site, followed by the abstraction of hydrogen from the surface O-H group to reduce the O2 to HO2. This process leads to the formation of gas-phase radicals, including methyl radicals (CH3.), which can further react to form olefins and other products.

In terms of activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, redox-active catalysts like vanadia are less effective. The reason is that the redox-inactive catalysts, such as those based on boron nitride, can selectively activate CO2 through a mechanism that does not require the presence of an external oxidant like O2. This allows for a more efficient conversion of CO2 to value-added products, such as methane or methanol, alongside the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation depends on their ability to selectively activate the C-H bonds in propane and CO2 without undergoing a redox cycle, thus enabling the formation of desired products with lower energy barriers and higher selectivity.

氧化脱氢反应中，烷烃的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制在红氧化性金属氧化物催化剂和红氧化性不强的金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异。红氧化性催化剂，如五氧化二钒（V2O5）和五氧化二钒氧化物（VOx/SiO2），通常涉及一个氧化还原循环，其中催化剂被烷烃氧化，并由传统的氧化剂（通常是分子氧O2）还原，从而实现催化剂表面的再生。这个过程促进了烷烃的C-H键活化，导致烯烃的形成。

相比之下，红氧化性不强的催化剂，如氧化铈（CeO2）和过渡金属簇，通过不同的机制激活C-H键。它们不需要进行氧化还原循环，而是依赖于表面的内在特性，通常涉及C-H键的异裂。例如，在硼氮（BN）催化剂上进行氧化脱氢反应的机制包括通过BO对在BO3活性位点上的异裂激活C-H键，随后从表面O-H组抽象氢原子将O2还原为HO2。这个过程导致气体相自由基的形成，包括甲基自由基（CH3.），这些自由基可以进一步反应形成烯烃和其他产品。

关于二氧化碳活化用于丙烷氧化脱氢的问题，红氧化性催化剂如五氧化二钒的效果较差。原因是基于硼氮的催化剂能够通过不涉及外部氧化剂（如O2）的方式选择性地激活CO2，这使得更有效地将CO2转化为有价值的产物（如甲烷或甲醇）成为可能，同时伴随着丙烷氧化脱氢过程。

不同催化剂在激活二氧化碳并用于氧化脱氢方面的有效性取决于其激活丙烷和二氧化碳的C-H键的能力，无需经历氧化还原循环，从而实现期望产品的更高选择性和更低能量壁垒。

This document compares the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, activate CO2 through traditional oxidant mechanisms, facilitating CO2 dissociation. Transition metal clusters also participate in this process. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, exemplified by hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and supported boron oxide catalysts, employ a different mechanism. These catalysts activate the C-H bond of propane through heterolytic cleavage, followed by reduction of the gas phase oxidant rather than the surface itself. This process allows for selective alkane conversions, demonstrating the versatility of different catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, involves traditional oxidants like oxygen or carbon dioxide (CO2) to activate the C-H bonds of the alkane substrate. The redox-active nature of these catalysts enables them to undergo redox reactions, facilitating the activation of C-H bonds through the adsorption of oxygen or CO2, followed by the abstraction of hydrogen or the formation of radicals. For instance, V2O5 catalysts can promote the oxidative cleavage of alkane molecules, converting them into olefins and water, with the involvement of surface oxygen species derived from the redox process.

In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like transition metal clusters, do not directly participate in redox reactions. Instead, they activate C-H bonds through heterolytic cleavage of the alkane molecule, typically with the assistance of gas-phase oxidants such as CO2. This process does not involve the direct reduction of the catalyst surface but relies on the gas-phase oxidant to facilitate the activation of the C-H bonds. The transition metal clusters, being less prone to redox reactions, are more effective in selectively converting alkane molecules to olefins without the formation of unwanted byproducts like CO2, which is a common byproduct in the case of redox-active catalysts.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on their ability to facilitate the dissociation of CO2 into its constituent atoms. Redox-active catalysts, such as vanadium oxides, can effectively promote the oxidative cleavage of propane by adsorbing oxygen or CO2, which subsequently reacts with the alkane substrate. The redox process allows for the activation of the C-H bonds and the formation of olefins. On the other hand, redox-inactive catalysts, like transition metal clusters, require the presence of gas-phase oxidants like CO2 to achieve alkane activation. These catalysts are more selective in their conversion of propane to olefins, as they minimize the formation of CO2 as a byproduct.

The proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation in the context of oxidative dehydrogenation highlight the distinct roles played by redox-active versus redox-inactive catalysts. Redox-active catalysts rely on redox reactions to facilitate alkane activation, whereas redox-inactive catalysts utilize gas-phase oxidants for the activation process. This distinction impacts the selectivity and efficiency of alkane conversion, with redox-inactive catalysts often offering superior selectivity and reduced formation of unwanted byproducts like CO2.

红氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2，在烷烃的氧化脱氢反应中涉及到传统的氧化剂，如氧气或二氧化碳（CO2），以激活烷烃基团中的C-H键。这些具有还原性的催化剂能够通过氧化反应促进烷烃分子的激活，通过吸附氧气或CO2，随后通过氢原子的抽取或形成自由基来激活C-H键。例如，V2O5催化剂可以通过氧化裂解烷烃分子，将其转化为烯烃和水，其中涉及催化剂表面的氧物种的氧化还原过程。

相比之下，还原性不强的金属氧化物催化剂，如过渡金属簇，不会直接参与氧化还原反应。它们通过异裂解烷烃分子来激活C-H键，通常需要气体相氧化剂，如CO2的协助。这个过程不需要催化剂表面的直接还原，而是依赖于气体相氧化剂来促进C-H键的激活。过渡金属簇由于较少涉及氧化还原反应，因此在选择性地将烷烃分子转化为烯烃时更为有效，因为它们减少了作为副产品形成的CO2，这是使用具有氧化还原活性的催化剂时常见的副产品。

不同催化剂在二氧化碳的氧化脱氢作用中的有效性取决于其促进二氧化碳解离的能力。具有氧化还原活性的催化剂，如钒氧化物，可以有效地通过吸附氧气或CO2促进丙烷的氧化裂解，随后与烷烃基团反应生成烯烃。氧化还原过程允许激活C-H键并形成烯烃。另一方面，具有还原性不强的催化剂，如过渡金属簇，需要气体相氧化剂，如CO2，来实现烷烃的激活。这些催化剂在选择性地将丙烷转化为烯烃方面更为有效，因为它们减少了作为副产品形成的CO2的形成。

氧化还原机制和二氧化碳解离的能量壁垒在氧化脱氢的背景下突出了红氧化还原活性与还原性不强的催化剂之间的不同作用。红氧化还原活性催化剂依赖于氧化还原反应来促进烷烃的激活，而还原性不强的催化剂则利用气体相氧化剂进行激活过程。这种区别影响了烷烃转换的选择性和效率，还原性不强的催化剂往往提供更好的选择性和减少形成副产品的CO2。

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) involves both surface-mediated and gas-phase radical pathways. Propene is exclusively formed through the surface reaction, while C1 and C2 products are formed via both surface and gas-phase pathways. Methyl radicals are generated on the h-BN surface from the cleavage of the C-C bond in propane, leading to various secondary reaction pathways. The ODH reaction over h-BN and supported boron oxide catalysts involves the gas-phase radical mechanisms with unambiguously identified gas-phase methyl radicals. Detailed reaction pathways for the formation of various products are proposed through DFT calculations. Propene is mainly formed from the surface reaction via the cleavage of the C-H bond of propane. Both surface-mediated and gas-phase reactions contribute to the formation of C1 and C2 products. These findings provide new insights into understanding the ODH reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts, which are significant for developing highly selective catalysts for alkane ODH.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, typically involve the direct oxidation of the alkane by lattice oxygen from the metal oxide, followed by the reduction of the metal oxide to regenerate its active sites. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, exemplified by hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), activate C-H bonds through heterolytic cleavage, utilizing the gas phase oxidant rather than the surface for oxidation. The h-BN catalysts, as studied in this document, involve both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways for the formation of propene and C1, C2 products. The role of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is minimal in this context, as the focus is on the activation of C-H bonds rather than the direct activation of CO2. DFT calculations suggest that the redox-poor surface of h-BN catalyzes the reaction through heterolytic CH cleavage followed by a reduction of the gas phase oxidant, offering a mechanism similar to other redox-poor oxides such as MgO, which selectively convert alkanes without the need for an external oxidant like CO2.

在烷烃氧化脱氢过程中，活性氧金属氧化物催化剂与无活性氧金属氧化物催化剂之间的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在显著差异。活性氧催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，通常通过金属氧化物的晶格氧直接氧化烷烃，随后还原金属氧化物以再生其活性位点。相比之下，无活性氧催化剂，如六方氮化硼（h-BN），通过异裂活化C-H键，利用气相氧化剂而不是表面进行氧化。研究中提到的h-BN催化剂涉及表面介导和气体路径的形成丙烯和C1、C2产物。CO2在丙烷氧化脱氢中的作用很小，因为重点是活化C-H键而非直接活化CO2。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，h-BN的红氧化性表面通过异裂CH裂解催化反应，随后还原气相氧化剂，提供类似于MgO等其他红氧化性氧化物的机制，这些氧化物能够选择性地转化烷烃，而无需外部氧化剂如CO2。
