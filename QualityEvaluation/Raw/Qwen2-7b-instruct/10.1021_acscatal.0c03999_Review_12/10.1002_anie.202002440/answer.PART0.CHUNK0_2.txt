[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[3] "However, the detection of methyl radical over BOx/SiO2 (Supporting Information, FigureS21) in the absence of NO suggests that radical chemistry over boron-based catalysts for ODHP reaction is indeed present regardless of NO presence."
[4] "DFT calculations were performed to construct the reaction mechanism including pathways and radical chemistry of ODHP on the boron nitride catalyst."
[5] "We have found the redox-poor surface catalyzes the reaction by heterolytic CH cleavage followed by a reduction of the gas phase oxidant rather than the surface."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, involves traditional oxidants like oxygen or carbon dioxide (CO2) to activate the C-H bonds of the alkane substrate. The redox-active nature of these catalysts enables them to undergo redox reactions, facilitating the activation of C-H bonds through the adsorption of oxygen or CO2, followed by the abstraction of hydrogen or the formation of radicals. For instance, V2O5 catalysts can promote the oxidative cleavage of alkane molecules, converting them into olefins and water, with the involvement of surface oxygen species derived from the redox process.

In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like transition metal clusters, do not directly participate in redox reactions. Instead, they activate C-H bonds through heterolytic cleavage of the alkane molecule, typically with the assistance of gas-phase oxidants such as CO2. This process does not involve the direct reduction of the catalyst surface but relies on the gas-phase oxidant to facilitate the activation of the C-H bonds. The transition metal clusters, being less prone to redox reactions, are more effective in selectively converting alkane molecules to olefins without the formation of unwanted byproducts like CO2, which is a common byproduct in the case of redox-active catalysts.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on their ability to facilitate the dissociation of CO2 into its constituent atoms. Redox-active catalysts, such as vanadium oxides, can effectively promote the oxidative cleavage of propane by adsorbing oxygen or CO2, which subsequently reacts with the alkane substrate. The redox process allows for the activation of the C-H bonds and the formation of olefins. On the other hand, redox-inactive catalysts, like transition metal clusters, require the presence of gas-phase oxidants like CO2 to achieve alkane activation. These catalysts are more selective in their conversion of propane to olefins, as they minimize the formation of CO2 as a byproduct.

The proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation in the context of oxidative dehydrogenation highlight the distinct roles played by redox-active versus redox-inactive catalysts. Redox-active catalysts rely on redox reactions to facilitate alkane activation, whereas redox-inactive catalysts utilize gas-phase oxidants for the activation process. This distinction impacts the selectivity and efficiency of alkane conversion, with redox-inactive catalysts often offering superior selectivity and reduced formation of unwanted byproducts like CO2.

红氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2，在烷烃的氧化脱氢反应中涉及到传统的氧化剂，如氧气或二氧化碳（CO2），以激活烷烃基团中的C-H键。这些具有还原性的催化剂能够通过氧化反应促进烷烃分子的激活，通过吸附氧气或CO2，随后通过氢原子的抽取或形成自由基来激活C-H键。例如，V2O5催化剂可以通过氧化裂解烷烃分子，将其转化为烯烃和水，其中涉及催化剂表面的氧物种的氧化还原过程。

相比之下，还原性不强的金属氧化物催化剂，如过渡金属簇，不会直接参与氧化还原反应。它们通过异裂解烷烃分子来激活C-H键，通常需要气体相氧化剂，如CO2的协助。这个过程不需要催化剂表面的直接还原，而是依赖于气体相氧化剂来促进C-H键的激活。过渡金属簇由于较少涉及氧化还原反应，因此在选择性地将烷烃分子转化为烯烃时更为有效，因为它们减少了作为副产品形成的CO2，这是使用具有氧化还原活性的催化剂时常见的副产品。

不同催化剂在二氧化碳的氧化脱氢作用中的有效性取决于其促进二氧化碳解离的能力。具有氧化还原活性的催化剂，如钒氧化物，可以有效地通过吸附氧气或CO2促进丙烷的氧化裂解，随后与烷烃基团反应生成烯烃。氧化还原过程允许激活C-H键并形成烯烃。另一方面，具有还原性不强的催化剂，如过渡金属簇，需要气体相氧化剂，如CO2，来实现烷烃的激活。这些催化剂在选择性地将丙烷转化为烯烃方面更为有效，因为它们减少了作为副产品形成的CO2的形成。

氧化还原机制和二氧化碳解离的能量壁垒在氧化脱氢的背景下突出了红氧化还原活性与还原性不强的催化剂之间的不同作用。红氧化还原活性催化剂依赖于氧化还原反应来促进烷烃的激活，而还原性不强的催化剂则利用气体相氧化剂进行激活过程。这种区别影响了烷烃转换的选择性和效率，还原性不强的催化剂往往提供更好的选择性和减少形成副产品的CO2。
