The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as vanadia (V2O5) and vanadyl oxide (VOx/SiO2), typically involve a redox cycle where the catalyst is oxidized by the alkane and then reduced by a traditional oxidant, usually molecular oxygen (O2), leading to the regeneration of the active surface. This process facilitates the activation of the C-H bonds in alkanes, leading to the formation of olefins.

Redox-inactive catalysts, on the other hand, such as ceria (CeO2) and transition metal clusters, activate the C-H bonds through a different mechanism. They do not undergo a redox cycle and instead rely on the intrinsic properties of the surface, often involving heterolytic cleavage of the C-H bond. For instance, the proposed mechanism for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over a boron nitride (BN) catalyst involves the activation of the C-H bond through heterolytic cleavage over a BO pair in a BO3 active site, followed by the abstraction of hydrogen from the surface O-H group to reduce the O2 to HO2. This process leads to the formation of gas-phase radicals, including methyl radicals (CH3.), which can further react to form olefins and other products.

In terms of activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, redox-active catalysts like vanadia are less effective. The reason is that the redox-inactive catalysts, such as those based on boron nitride, can selectively activate CO2 through a mechanism that does not require the presence of an external oxidant like O2. This allows for a more efficient conversion of CO2 to value-added products, such as methane or methanol, alongside the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation depends on their ability to selectively activate the C-H bonds in propane and CO2 without undergoing a redox cycle, thus enabling the formation of desired products with lower energy barriers and higher selectivity.

氧化脱氢反应中，烷烃的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制在红氧化性金属氧化物催化剂和红氧化性不强的金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异。红氧化性催化剂，如五氧化二钒（V2O5）和五氧化二钒氧化物（VOx/SiO2），通常涉及一个氧化还原循环，其中催化剂被烷烃氧化，并由传统的氧化剂（通常是分子氧O2）还原，从而实现催化剂表面的再生。这个过程促进了烷烃的C-H键活化，导致烯烃的形成。

相比之下，红氧化性不强的催化剂，如氧化铈（CeO2）和过渡金属簇，通过不同的机制激活C-H键。它们不需要进行氧化还原循环，而是依赖于表面的内在特性，通常涉及C-H键的异裂。例如，在硼氮（BN）催化剂上进行氧化脱氢反应的机制包括通过BO对在BO3活性位点上的异裂激活C-H键，随后从表面O-H组抽象氢原子将O2还原为HO2。这个过程导致气体相自由基的形成，包括甲基自由基（CH3.），这些自由基可以进一步反应形成烯烃和其他产品。

关于二氧化碳活化用于丙烷氧化脱氢的问题，红氧化性催化剂如五氧化二钒的效果较差。原因是基于硼氮的催化剂能够通过不涉及外部氧化剂（如O2）的方式选择性地激活CO2，这使得更有效地将CO2转化为有价值的产物（如甲烷或甲醇）成为可能，同时伴随着丙烷氧化脱氢过程。

不同催化剂在激活二氧化碳并用于氧化脱氢方面的有效性取决于其激活丙烷和二氧化碳的C-H键的能力，无需经历氧化还原循环，从而实现期望产品的更高选择性和更低能量壁垒。
