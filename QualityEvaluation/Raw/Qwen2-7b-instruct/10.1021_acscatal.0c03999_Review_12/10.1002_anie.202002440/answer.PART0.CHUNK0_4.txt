[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
[3] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[4] "Interestingly, a recent work implied a possible influence of gas-phase radical chemistry of h-BN catalyst in ODHP reaction,6 in which no expected relationship was found between the catalytic activity and contact time."
[5] "We detected traces of nitric oxide (NO) on BN-T-high catalyst during ODHP reaction at 600C by using the SVUV-PIMS (Supporting Information, FigureS22), which was consistent with the GC-TCD results (Supporting Information, FigureS8)."
[6] "DFT calculations were performed to construct the reaction mechanism including pathways and radical chemistry of ODHP on the boron nitride catalyst."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, typically involve the direct oxidation of the alkane by lattice oxygen from the metal oxide, followed by the reduction of the metal oxide to regenerate its active sites. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, exemplified by hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), activate C-H bonds through heterolytic cleavage, utilizing the gas phase oxidant rather than the surface for oxidation. The h-BN catalysts, as studied in this document, involve both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways for the formation of propene and C1, C2 products. The role of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is minimal in this context, as the focus is on the activation of C-H bonds rather than the direct activation of CO2. DFT calculations suggest that the redox-poor surface of h-BN catalyzes the reaction through heterolytic CH cleavage followed by a reduction of the gas phase oxidant, offering a mechanism similar to other redox-poor oxides such as MgO, which selectively convert alkanes without the need for an external oxidant like CO2.

在烷烃氧化脱氢过程中，活性氧金属氧化物催化剂与无活性氧金属氧化物催化剂之间的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在显著差异。活性氧催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，通常通过金属氧化物的晶格氧直接氧化烷烃，随后还原金属氧化物以再生其活性位点。相比之下，无活性氧催化剂，如六方氮化硼（h-BN），通过异裂活化C-H键，利用气相氧化剂而不是表面进行氧化。研究中提到的h-BN催化剂涉及表面介导和气体路径的形成丙烯和C1、C2产物。CO2在丙烷氧化脱氢中的作用很小，因为重点是活化C-H键而非直接活化CO2。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，h-BN的红氧化性表面通过异裂CH裂解催化反应，随后还原气相氧化剂，提供类似于MgO等其他红氧化性氧化物的机制，这些氧化物能够选择性地转化烷烃，而无需外部氧化剂如CO2。
