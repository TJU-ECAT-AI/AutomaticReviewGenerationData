[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[3] "Our SVUV-PIMS results provided direct and unambiguous detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts. To our knowledge, this is the first report of direct experimental evidence of methyl radical generation in ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts."
[4] "Noteworthily, we detected NO on BN-T-high catalyst during ODHP reaction at 600C by using the SVUV-PIMS (Supporting Information, FigureS22), which was consistent with the GC-TCD results (Supporting Information, FigureS8)."

This document compares the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, activate CO2 through traditional oxidant mechanisms, facilitating CO2 dissociation. Transition metal clusters also participate in this process. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, exemplified by hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and supported boron oxide catalysts, employ a different mechanism. These catalysts activate the C-H bond of propane through heterolytic cleavage, followed by reduction of the gas phase oxidant rather than the surface itself. This process allows for selective alkane conversions, demonstrating the versatility of different catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

本文比较了在红氧化合物活性和红氧化合物非活性金属氧化物催化剂上进行烷烃氧化脱氢的不同机制。红氧化合物活性催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2，通过传统的氧化剂机制激活CO2，促进CO2解离。过渡金属簇也参与这一过程。相比之下，红氧化合物非活性催化剂，例如六方硼氮（h-BN）和支持型硼氧化物催化剂，采用不同的机制。这些催化剂通过异裂的方式激活丙烷中的C-H键，随后是气体相氧化剂的还原，而不是表面本身。这一过程允许选择性地转化烷烃，展示了不同催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的多样性。
