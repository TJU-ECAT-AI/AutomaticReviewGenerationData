[1] "The production in steelmaking plants involves four stages in process: hot metal pretreatment, steelmaking, secondary metallurgy and continuous casting."
[2] "Fine production in steelmaking plants is comprehensive development and performance of the ideas of function analysis of metallurgical processes,optimization and reorganization (from the angles of process, facility and technology) in steelmaking section."
[3] "FCPT during hot metal pretreatment process needs to reasonably select the process mode (single desulfurization treatment or desiliconization, dephosphorization, desulphurization treatment) according to corresponding steel grade and the effect, costs, efficiency of the treatment."
[4] "FCPT during BOF steelmaking process intends to accurately control the content and temperature of molten steel through high efficient oxygen supply technology, long campaign combined blow technology, automation technology and advanced detection technology, which would lay the foundation for fine control of secondary metallurgy process."
[5] "FCPT during BOF steelmaking process aims to accurately control the content and temperature of molten steel."
[6] "FCPT during secondary metallurgy process is supposed to select the appropriate secondary metallurgy process, according to the characteristics (sulfur content, oxygen content, inclusions, etc.) of different steel grades and the functions of different secondary metallurgy process facilities, and develop the corresponding process control technology."
[7] "FCPT during continuous casting process is aimed at achieving fine control of the quality of strands, by means of reasonably stable flow control in the tundish and mold, heat transfer as well as secondary cooling control optimization, applications of high-precision and high-level control technology in the continuous casting process and so on."

Steelmaking plants involve four stages: hot metal pretreatment, steelmaking, secondary metallurgy, and continuous casting. Fine production in steelmaking plants integrates the optimization and reorganization of metallurgical processes, facilities, and technologies. During hot metal pretreatment, the process mode is selected based on the steel grade and treatment efficiency. BOF steelmaking focuses on accurately controlling molten steel content and temperature through advanced technologies. Secondary metallurgy requires selecting appropriate processes based on steel grade characteristics and facility functions. Continuous casting aims to achieve fine control of strand quality through various control technologies and techniques.
