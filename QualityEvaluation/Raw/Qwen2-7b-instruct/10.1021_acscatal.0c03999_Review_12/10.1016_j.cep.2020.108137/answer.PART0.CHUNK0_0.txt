2.2. Fine control of productive technology during hot metal pretreatment process
Generally speaking, desulphurization pretreatment of hot metal is applied by European and American steel plants, while desiliconization, dephosphorization and desulphurization treatment facilities of liquid steel are applied by most Japanese steel plants [2]. The new generation of steel plants in China mostly employs the technology of desiliconization, dephosphorization and desulphurization treatment of liquid steel in order to shorten production cycle of BOF steelmaking and fulfill the compact, high-efficiency and energy-saving production mode. Shougang Jingtang steel plants applied hot metal treatment (desulphurization in hot metal ladle, dedicated converter for desiliconization and dephosphorization) to clean steel production, which provided the conditions to large-scale, low- cost and quick-rhythm manufacture. With the process of desulphurization in hot metal ladle, desiliconization,dephosphorization, and desulphurization in dedicated converter, the removal processes of sulphur, phosphorus,carbon, oxygen and so on are obviously optimized. The production practices of Shougang Jingtang steel plants shows that the application of hot metal treatment process not only improved the production efficiency (the converter reduces 8  10 min per heat for decarburization), but also reduces the production costs (blast furnace could use the iron ore with high phosphorus content, manganese ore could be used in decarburization converter which reduced the amount of ferromanganese). Furthermore, hot metal treatment process is well adapted to high speed continuous casting of thin slab production.

In the context of hot metal pretreatment, European and American steel plants typically apply desulphurization pretreatment, whereas Japanese plants often utilize facilities for desiliconization, dephosphorization, and desulphurization of liquid steel. Newer Chinese steel plants have adopted a process of desiliconization, dephosphorization, and desulphurization of liquid steel to streamline the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) steelmaking process, enhancing compactness, efficiency, and energy savings. Shougang Jingtang steel plants implemented hot metal treatment involving ladle desulphurization and dedicated converters for desiliconization and dephosphorization, providing conditions for large-scale, low-cost, and rapid production. This process optimizes the removal of sulfur, phosphorus, carbon, oxygen, and other elements, boosting production efficiency and cost reduction. Additionally, the hot metal treatment process facilitates high-speed continuous casting of thin slabs.
