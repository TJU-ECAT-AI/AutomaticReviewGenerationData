2.2. Fine control of productive technology during hot metal pretreatment process
Generally speaking, desulphurization pretreatment of hot metal is applied by European and American steel plants, while desiliconization, dephosphorization and desulphurization treatment facilities of liquid steel are applied by most Japanese steel plants [2]. The new generation of steel plants in China mostly employs the technology of desiliconization, dephosphorization and desulphurization treatment of liquid steel in order to shorten production cycle of BOF steelmaking and fulfill the compact, high-efficiency and energy-saving production mode. Shougang Jingtang steel plants applied hot metal treatment (desulphurization in hot metal ladle, dedicated converter for desiliconization and dephosphorization) to clean steel production, which provided the conditions to large-scale, low- cost and quick-rhythm manufacture. With the process of desulphurization in hot metal ladle, desiliconization,dephosphorization, and desulphurization in dedicated converter, the removal processes of sulphur, phosphorus,carbon, oxygen and so on are obviously optimized. The production practices of Shougang Jingtang steel plants shows that the application of hot metal treatment process not only improved the production efficiency (the converter reduces 8  10 min per heat for decarburization), but also reduces the production costs (blast furnace could use the iron ore with high phosphorus content, manganese ore could be used in decarburization converter which reduced the amount of ferromanganese). Furthermore, hot metal treatment process is well adapted to high speed continuous casting of thin slab production.

In the context of hot metal pretreatment, European and American steel plants typically apply desulphurization pretreatment, whereas Japanese plants often utilize facilities for desiliconization, dephosphorization, and desulphurization of liquid steel. Newer Chinese steel plants have adopted a process of desiliconization, dephosphorization, and desulphurization of liquid steel to streamline the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) steelmaking process, enhancing compactness, efficiency, and energy savings. Shougang Jingtang steel plants implemented hot metal treatment involving ladle desulphurization and dedicated converters for desiliconization and dephosphorization, providing conditions for large-scale, low-cost, and rapid production. This process optimizes the removal of sulfur, phosphorus, carbon, oxygen, and other elements, boosting production efficiency and cost reduction. Additionally, the hot metal treatment process facilitates high-speed continuous casting of thin slabs.

Steel production in steelmaking plants involves several key stages including hot metal pretreatment, steelmaking, secondary metallurgy, and continuous casting. The concept of fine production in steelmaking plants integrates the fine control of productive technology (FCPT), fine configuration and reliable operation of process facilities (FCROPF), and fine control of production process (FCCPP). This holistic approach embodies the dynamic order, continuous compactness, and efficient coordination of production systems, crucial for enhancing energy efficiency, reducing consumption, and improving process control and automation. 

During the BOF steelmaking process, FCPT focuses on accurately controlling molten steel content and temperature through advanced technologies such as high-efficient oxygen supply, long campaign combined blow, automation, and detection. This lays the groundwork for subsequent fine control in secondary metallurgy. For instance, a study established models to predict the end-point manganese content with a high hit rate, demonstrating the effectiveness of these methodologies.

In LF refining, a system was developed to predict the end-point composition with high precision, significantly increasing the hit rate for critical elements like carbon (C), silicon (Si), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), and vanadium (V). This system also addressed issues of unstable alloy consumption by providing accurate predictions.

For the continuous casting process, the goal is to finely control the quality of the final product through strategic flow control, heat transfer optimization, and secondary cooling adjustments. Advanced control technologies are employed to achieve this.

Overall, the integration of these fine production concepts across different stages of steelmaking contributes to the efficient, energy-saving, and high-quality production of steel.

钢铁生产在钢铁制造厂中涉及几个关键阶段，包括热金属预处理、炼钢、二次冶金和连续铸钢。细生产在钢铁制造厂的概念整合了单个过程的精细控制（FCPT）、过程设施的精细配置和可靠操作（FCROPF）以及生产过程的精细控制（FCCPP）。这种全面的方法体现了生产系统的动态秩序、连续紧凑性和高效协调，对于提高能源效率、减少消耗并改善过程控制和自动化具有重要意义。

在转炉炼钢过程中，FCPT专注于通过高效的氧气供应、长周期联合吹炼、自动化和检测等先进技术准确控制熔融钢的成分和温度，为后续的二次冶金提供了基础。例如，一项研究建立了预测转炉终点锰含量的模型，该模型的命中率高达90%，证明了这些方法的有效性。

在LF精炼中，建立了一个系统来预测终点成分，显著提高了碳（C）、硅（Si）、铬（Cr）、锰（Mn）和钒（V）等关键元素预测系统的命中率。该系统还解决了合金消耗不稳定的问题。

对于连续铸造过程，目标是通过战略流体控制、热传递优化和二次冷却调整来精确控制最终产品的质量。采用高级控制技术以实现这一目标。

总的来说，将这些细生产概念集成到钢铁制造的不同阶段，有助于实现高效、节能和高质量的钢铁生产。
