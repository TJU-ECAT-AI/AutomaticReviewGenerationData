The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane occurs over alumina-supported vanadia catalysts, with the addition of carbon dioxide enhancing the dehydrogenation rate. Redox-active metal oxides, specifically vanadium oxide (V2O5), effectively activate CO2 for this process, whereas redox-inactive metal oxides like ceria (CeO2) exhibit less activity. Transition metal clusters, such as copper and iron, were studied as additives to boost the catalyst's performance. CO2 activation involves its dissociation over the catalyst surface, generating CO and O atoms. These O atoms react with alkane molecules to form alkene products. The energy barrier for CO2 dissociation is influenced by the catalyst's surface properties. Catalyst regeneration often includes thermal treatment or reoxidation to restore the catalyst's activity.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, exemplified by vanadium (V2O5), undergo reversible oxidation and reduction at their metal centers, facilitating the activation of CO2. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, such as ceria (CeO2), primarily function as promoters by providing oxygen for the reaction. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by the specific mechanism of CO2 dissociation and the catalyst's capability to create an adequate energy barrier for the reaction. Transition metal clusters were noted to enhance the efficiency of CO2 activation, contributing to more effective propane oxidative dehydrogenation.

Comparing the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, redox-active metal oxide catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 facilitate the reduction of CO2 to CO through a series of redox reactions. This process involves the activation of C-H bonds in propane, leading to its dehydrogenation. On the other hand, redox-inactive catalysts, such as CeO2, may not directly reduce CO2 but can still enhance the reaction efficiency by promoting the adsorption and desorption of reactants. Transition metal clusters might also play a role in CO2 activation by providing an active site for the formation of reactive intermediates. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 is influenced by their ability to lower the energy barrier for CO2 dissociation, which is crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation process.
