The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, exemplified by vanadium (V2O5), undergo reversible oxidation and reduction at their metal centers, facilitating the activation of CO2. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, such as ceria (CeO2), primarily function as promoters by providing oxygen for the reaction. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by the specific mechanism of CO2 dissociation and the catalyst's capability to create an adequate energy barrier for the reaction. Transition metal clusters were noted to enhance the efficiency of CO2 activation, contributing to more effective propane oxidative dehydrogenation.

氧化脱氢（ODH）烷烃中的C-H键激活和催化剂再生机制在红氧化活性金属氧化物和非氧化活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异。红氧化活性催化剂，如钒(V2O5)，其金属中心可进行可逆氧化和还原，促进CO2的活化。相比之下，非氧化活性催化剂，例如铈(CeO2)，主要作为促进剂通过提供反应所需氧发挥作用。这些催化剂在激活CO2以进行丙烷氧化脱氢作用的有效性，受到特定的CO2分解机制和催化剂创建适当能量壁垒能力的影响。发现过渡金属簇可以增强CO2的活化效率，从而提高丙烷氧化脱氢的效率。
