The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane occurs over alumina-supported vanadia catalysts, with the addition of carbon dioxide enhancing the dehydrogenation rate. Redox-active metal oxides, specifically vanadium oxide (V2O5), effectively activate CO2 for this process, whereas redox-inactive metal oxides like ceria (CeO2) exhibit less activity. Transition metal clusters, such as copper and iron, were studied as additives to boost the catalyst's performance. CO2 activation involves its dissociation over the catalyst surface, generating CO and O atoms. These O atoms react with alkane molecules to form alkene products. The energy barrier for CO2 dissociation is influenced by the catalyst's surface properties. Catalyst regeneration often includes thermal treatment or reoxidation to restore the catalyst's activity.

氧化脱氢反应在氧化铝负载的钒催化剂上进行，二氧化碳的添加能够提高脱氢速率。具有还原活性的金属氧化物，如五氧化二钒（V2O5），有效激活二氧化碳进行此过程，而还原惰性金属氧化物如铈氧化物（CeO2）则表现出较低的活性。铜和铁等过渡金属簇被研究作为催化剂性能增强的添加剂。二氧化碳的激活涉及其在催化剂表面的分解，产生CO和O原子。这些O原子与烷烃分子反应形成烯烃产品。二氧化碳分解的能量壁垒受到催化剂表面性质的影响。催化剂再生通常包括热处理或重新氧化以恢复催化剂的活性。
