The study examines the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using alumina-supported vanadia catalysts, with a focus on the impact of carbon dioxide and secondary surface metal oxide additives. The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration are compared for both redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, taking into account the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. Different catalysts, including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, are employed to assess their efficiency in activating CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with considerations given to the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.
