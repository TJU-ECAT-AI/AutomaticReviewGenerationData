The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was examined using alumina-supported vanadia catalysts. The introduction of CO2 into the reaction mixture influenced the selectivity towards higher hydrocarbons. Transition metal clusters were identified as improving the catalytic activity for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. Secondary surface metal oxides were found to augment the catalyst's capacity to activate CO2. V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters were evaluated as catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. Redox-active metal oxides demonstrated superior performance in CO2 activation compared to redox-inactive counterparts.

在研究中，我们使用了铝酸盐支持的钒催化剂来考察丙烷的氧化脱氢反应。将二氧化碳引入反应混合物中，对生成更高碳数产物的选择性产生了影响。过渡金属簇被发现能提高丙烷氧化脱氢的催化活性。二次表面金属氧化物被发现能增强催化剂对二氧化碳的激活能力。V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇被作为丙烷氧化脱氢的催化剂进行了比较。具有氧化还原活性的金属氧化物在二氧化碳激活方面表现出优于不具有氧化还原活性的同类物质的性能。
