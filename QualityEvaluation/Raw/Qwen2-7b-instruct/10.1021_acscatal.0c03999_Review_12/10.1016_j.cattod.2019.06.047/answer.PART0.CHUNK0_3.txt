Comparing the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, redox-active metal oxide catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 facilitate the reduction of CO2 to CO through a series of redox reactions. This process involves the activation of C-H bonds in propane, leading to its dehydrogenation. On the other hand, redox-inactive catalysts, such as CeO2, may not directly reduce CO2 but can still enhance the reaction efficiency by promoting the adsorption and desorption of reactants. Transition metal clusters might also play a role in CO2 activation by providing an active site for the formation of reactive intermediates. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 is influenced by their ability to lower the energy barrier for CO2 dissociation, which is crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

比较烷烃氧化脱氢过程中活性金属氧化物催化剂（如V2O5和VOx/SiO2）与非氧化性催化剂（如CeO2）在激活C-H键和催化剂再生机制上的不同。活性金属氧化物催化剂通过一系列还原反应促进CO2转化为CO，进而激活丙烷中的C-H键，实现脱氢。而非氧化性催化剂虽然可能直接减少CO2的还原过程，但通过促进反应物的吸附和脱附，仍然能提高反应效率。过渡金属簇可能通过提供形成活性中间体的活性位点，在激活CO2方面发挥作用。这些催化剂在激活CO2的有效性受到降低CO2分解能量壁垒能力的影响，这是氧化脱氢过程的关键步骤。
