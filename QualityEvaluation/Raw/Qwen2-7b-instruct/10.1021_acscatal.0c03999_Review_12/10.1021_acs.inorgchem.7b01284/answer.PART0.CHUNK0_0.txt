The study investigated methane hydroxylation over specific zeolites activated by N2O, focusing on comparing the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for both redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. The effectiveness of various catalysts, including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, in activating CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was examined. The research also delved into the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers associated with CO2 dissociation, highlighting the roles of traditional oxidants and CO2 in the process.
