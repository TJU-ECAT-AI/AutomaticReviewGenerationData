[1] "The mechanism of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes."
[2] "Effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The mechanism of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves the interaction between the catalyst and the reactant molecules, leading to the breaking of C-H bonds and the formation of products. Different catalysts such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters show varying effectiveness in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, depending on their ability to facilitate CO2 dissociation and the subsequent reaction steps.
