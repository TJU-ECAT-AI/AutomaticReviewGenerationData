<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, facilitate the activation of CO2 through a series of redox reactions, whereas redox-inactive catalysts, like CeO2, may require additional oxidants like O2 or CO2 to effectively activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation. Transition metal clusters also play a crucial role in the activation of CO2 by providing a suitable surface for the reaction and lowering the energy barrier for CO2 dissociation. In terms of effectiveness, the choice of catalyst depends on the specific alkane being dehydrogenated and the reaction conditions. For instance, V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 have shown high efficiency in activating CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, as they can efficiently lower the activation energy barrier for CO2 dissociation and promote the desired reaction pathways.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
烷烃氧化脱氢过程中，活性氧化物催化剂与非活性氧化物催化剂在C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制上存在显著差异。具有氧化还原活性的催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，通过一系列氧化还原反应促进CO2的活化；而非活性氧化物催化剂，如CeO2，则可能需要额外的氧化剂如O2或CO2来有效地活化CO2以进行氧化脱氢。过渡金属簇也对CO2活化起着关键作用，提供了合适的反应表面并降低了CO2解离的能量壁垒。至于有效性，催化剂的选择取决于被脱氢的具体烷烃以及反应条件。例如，V2O5和VOx/SiO2在丙烷的氧化脱氢中表现出高效率，因为它们能够有效地降低CO2解离的活化能壁垒并促进所需反应途径。
