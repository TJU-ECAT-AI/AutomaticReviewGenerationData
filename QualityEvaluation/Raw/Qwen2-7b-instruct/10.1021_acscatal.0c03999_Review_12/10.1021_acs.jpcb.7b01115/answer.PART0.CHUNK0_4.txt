1. Kinetic limitations make it difficult to break the NO bond, necessitating the use of a catalyst and a reducing agent.
2. In NO reduction by H2, the major reactions yield three products: N2, N2O, and NH3.
3. Direct NO dissociation is favored over hydrogen-assisted routes involving HNO*, NOH*, or HNOH* intermediates.
4. The formation of N-containing products from N* was studied, with N2 being the major product due to its lower activation energy.
5. Phase diagrams show that under typical reaction conditions, the Pt(100) surface is covered by half a monolayer of NO molecules.

1. 动力学限制使得NO键难以断裂，因此需要催化剂和还原剂。
2. 在NO通过H2的还原时，主要反应生成三种产物：N2、N2O和NH3。
3. 直接NO解离路径优于形成HNO*、NOH*或HNOH*中间体的氢辅助路径。
4. 研究了从N*生成N含产物的情况，其中N2是主要产物，因其活化能较低。
5. 相图显示，在典型反应条件下，Pt(100)表面被一层半的NO分子覆盖。
