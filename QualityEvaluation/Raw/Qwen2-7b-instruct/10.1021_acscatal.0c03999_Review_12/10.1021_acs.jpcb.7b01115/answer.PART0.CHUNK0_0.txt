<p>However, because of kinetic limitations, the NO bond is difficult to break. In general, a catalyst and a reducing agent are needed. In automobiles that consume gasoline, three-way catalysis (TWC) is a generally used method, with carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons acting as the reductants. In stationary plants, the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO is a common process where ammonia (NH3) is used as the typical reductant.</p>
<p>A recent theoretical study from our group investigated the NO reduction by H2 reaction mechanism on Pt(111). (73) We found that the H-assisted NO dissociation path is indeed more favorable on Pt(111), and that the addition of at least two hydrogen atoms is required to lower the barrier for NO bond breaking on that surface.</p>
<p>Our calculations show that the most stable site for H* is the bridge site (Figure 1a) with a BE of 2.89 eV. Previous periodic DFT studies showed the same site preference for H* and gave similar BE values at the same coverage (0.25 monolayer, ML).</p>
<p>On Pt(100), NO* prefers to bind on the bridge site through the N atom with its molecular axis normal to the surface (Figure 1d), which is consistent with results in the literature. (17,103,105107)</p>
<p>H2 dissociation (H2 + 2*  H* + H*) H2 dissociation is spontaneous with a reaction energy of 1.20 eV on Pt(100). The lack of a barrier and exothermic character of this reaction on clean Pt(100) ensure the availability of atomic H* on the surface, which is the prerequisite for the subsequent hydrogenation steps.</p>
<p>The direct NO dissociation path is preferred based on the NO activation mechanism discussed above, leading to adsorbed N* and O* surface species. We next investigate the formation of three major N-containing products, namely, N2, N2O, and NH3, from N*, and study H2O formation from O* as well.</p>

The document discusses the mechanism of nitric oxide (NO) reduction by hydrogen (H2) on platinum (Pt) surfaces. The key points are:

1. The direct NO dissociation path is favored over hydrogen-assisted paths involving HNO*, NOH*, or HNOH* intermediates.
2. The formation of nitrogen-containing products from atomic N* involves N* combining with N* to form N2, which has a lower barrier than NH* and N2O* formation steps.
3. The direct NO dissociation path leads to adsorbed N* and O* surface species, which then form N2, N2O, NH3, and H2O products.
4. The Pt(100) surface is more active in NO reduction compared to Pt(111), facilitating the direct NO dissociation path.
5. The phase diagrams for NO adsorption on Pt(100) suggest that under typical reaction conditions, the surface is likely covered by half a monolayer of NO molecules.
6. The document proposes that surface coverage effects should be explicitly considered in first-principles studies of NO reduction by H2 on Pt surfaces.

These insights contribute to understanding the catalytic mechanisms involved in the reduction of NO by H2 on Pt surfaces, which is relevant to developing more efficient methods for abating NO emissions in combustion processes.

文献讨论了氢（H2）在铂（Pt）表面上对一氧化二氮（NO）的还原机制。关键点如下：

1. 直接的NO解离路径比涉及HNO*、NOH*或HNOH*中间体的氢辅助路径更受青睐。
2. 从原子N*形成氮含产品涉及将N*与另一个N*结合以形成N2，这比形成NH*和N2O*步骤的壁垒更低。
3. 直接的NO解离路径导致吸附的N*和O*表面物种，随后形成了N2、N2O、NH3和H2O产物。
4. 与Pt(111)相比，Pt(100)表面在NO还原方面更为活跃，有利于直接的NO解离路径。
5. Pt(100)表面上NO吸附的相图表明，在典型反应条件下，表面可能被半层NO分子覆盖。
6. 文档提出，在Pt表面上由H2进行NO还原时应明确考虑表面覆盖效果的第一原理研究。

这些见解有助于理解在Pt表面通过H2还原NO的催化机制，这对于开发更高效的减少燃烧过程中NO排放的方法具有重要意义。
