The direct NO dissociation path is favored over hydrogen-assisted routes for NO activation on clean Pt(100). This is because NO* dissociation has a lower barrier than hydrogenation to form HNO* or NOH*. The reaction mechanism for N2 and N2O formation involves the reaction of atomic N* with other N* or NO* species, respectively. NH3 formation is kinetically more challenging compared to N2 and N2O formation from N*. At a total NO coverage of 1.00 ML, all four NO adsorbates occupy bridge sites with perpendicular configurations. At 400 K, 0.50 ML NO is the most thermodynamically stable state on Pt(100) within the specified pressure range. The direct NO dissociation path is preferred over H-assisted paths, and N-containing products are formed from atomic N*.

在干净的Pt(100)表面上，直接的NO分解路径优于氢辅助路径用于NO活化。这是因为NO*分解的壁垒低于形成HNO*或NOH*的氢化。N2和N2O的形成反应机制涉及原子N*与其他N*或NO*物种的反应。NH3的形成在动力学上比从N*形成N2和N2O更困难。当总NO覆盖率为1.00 ML时，所有四个NO吸附剂占据桥位并以垂直配置。在400 K下，0.50 ML NO是Pt(100)表面在指定压力范围内的最热力学稳定状态。直接的NO分解路径优于氢辅助路径，并且从N*形成N-含产物。
