<p>However, because of kinetic limitations, the NO bond is difficult to break. In general, a catalyst and a reducing agent are needed. In automobiles that consume gasoline, three-way catalysis (TWC) is a generally used method, with carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons acting as the reductants. In stationary plants, the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO is a common process where ammonia (NH3) is used as the typical reductant.</p>
<p>A recent theoretical study from our group investigated the NO reduction by H2 reaction mechanism on Pt(111). (73) We found that the H-assisted NO dissociation path is indeed more favorable on Pt(111), and that the addition of at least two hydrogen atoms is required to lower the barrier for NO bond breaking on that surface.</p>
<p>Our calculations show that the most stable site for H* is the bridge site (Figure 1a) with a BE of 2.89 eV. Previous periodic DFT studies showed the same site preference for H* and gave similar BE values at the same coverage (0.25 monolayer, ML).</p>
<p>On Pt(100), NO* prefers to bind on the bridge site through the N atom with its molecular axis normal to the surface (Figure 1d), which is consistent with results in the literature. (17,103,105107)</p>
<p>H2 dissociation (H2 + 2*  H* + H*) H2 dissociation is spontaneous with a reaction energy of 1.20 eV on Pt(100). The lack of a barrier and exothermic character of this reaction on clean Pt(100) ensure the availability of atomic H* on the surface, which is the prerequisite for the subsequent hydrogenation steps.</p>
<p>The direct NO dissociation path is preferred based on the NO activation mechanism discussed above, leading to adsorbed N* and O* surface species. We next investigate the formation of three major N-containing products, namely, N2, N2O, and NH3, from N*, and study H2O formation from O* as well.</p>

The document discusses the mechanism of nitric oxide (NO) reduction by hydrogen (H2) on platinum (Pt) surfaces. The key points are:

1. The direct NO dissociation path is favored over hydrogen-assisted paths involving HNO*, NOH*, or HNOH* intermediates.
2. The formation of nitrogen-containing products from atomic N* involves N* combining with N* to form N2, which has a lower barrier than NH* and N2O* formation steps.
3. The direct NO dissociation path leads to adsorbed N* and O* surface species, which then form N2, N2O, NH3, and H2O products.
4. The Pt(100) surface is more active in NO reduction compared to Pt(111), facilitating the direct NO dissociation path.
5. The phase diagrams for NO adsorption on Pt(100) suggest that under typical reaction conditions, the surface is likely covered by half a monolayer of NO molecules.
6. The document proposes that surface coverage effects should be explicitly considered in first-principles studies of NO reduction by H2 on Pt surfaces.

These insights contribute to understanding the catalytic mechanisms involved in the reduction of NO by H2 on Pt surfaces, which is relevant to developing more efficient methods for abating NO emissions in combustion processes.

文献讨论了氢（H2）在铂（Pt）表面上对一氧化二氮（NO）的还原机制。关键点如下：

1. 直接的NO解离路径比涉及HNO*、NOH*或HNOH*中间体的氢辅助路径更受青睐。
2. 从原子N*形成氮含产品涉及将N*与另一个N*结合以形成N2，这比形成NH*和N2O*步骤的壁垒更低。
3. 直接的NO解离路径导致吸附的N*和O*表面物种，随后形成了N2、N2O、NH3和H2O产物。
4. 与Pt(111)相比，Pt(100)表面在NO还原方面更为活跃，有利于直接的NO解离路径。
5. Pt(100)表面上NO吸附的相图表明，在典型反应条件下，表面可能被半层NO分子覆盖。
6. 文档提出，在Pt表面上由H2进行NO还原时应明确考虑表面覆盖效果的第一原理研究。

这些见解有助于理解在Pt表面通过H2还原NO的催化机制，这对于开发更高效的减少燃烧过程中NO排放的方法具有重要意义。

The document focuses on studying the reaction mechanism for nitric oxide (NO) reduction by hydrogen (H2) on a platinum (Pt) catalyst, specifically on the Pt(100) surface. The main findings are:

1. Direct NO dissociation is favored over hydrogen-assisted paths involving intermediates like HNO*, NOH*, and HNOH* for NO bond activation. This is due to the lower barrier for direct NO dissociation compared to hydrogenation steps.

2. The formation of nitrogen-containing products from atomic N* is investigated. The combination of two N* atoms to form N2 has a lower barrier than forming N2O or NH3, suggesting N2 might be the major product for NO reduction by H2 on clean Pt(100).

3. The NO adsorption behavior on Pt(100) is studied under typical reaction conditions. The most stable state is found to be a coverage of 0.50 ML of NO molecules, based on the grand potential (Ω) at 400 K and a NO partial pressure of 0.005 atm.

4. The surface coverage of NO* is crucial in determining the NO reduction mechanism on Pt(100). Changes in the reaction mechanism are observed when explicitly accounting for 0.50 ML of NO adsorbates on the surface.

5. The study uses density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PW91) to analyze the energetics of various steps in the reaction mechanism, including NO activation, product formation, and adsorption properties of surface species.

该文档主要研究了在铂催化剂（特别是Pt(100)表面）上氢气还原一氧化氮（NO）的反应机制。主要发现如下：

1. 直接NO分解路径优于通过HNO*、NOH*和HNOH*等中间体进行的氢辅助路径，用于激活NO键。这是因为直接NO分解路径的活化能比氢化步骤更低。

2. 从原子N*形成氮化合物的过程被研究。两个N*原子结合形成N2的路径具有较低的活化能，比形成N2O或NH3更容易，这意味着在清洁的Pt(100)表面上，N2可能是NO氢化的主要产物。

3. 在典型的反应条件下，Pt(100)表面最稳定的状态是覆盖有0.50 ML的NO分子，根据400K的温度和0.005 atm的NO分压下，基于最大潜力（Ω）计算得出。

4. NO*的表面覆盖率对Pt(100)上的NO还原机制至关重要。当明确考虑表面覆盖有0.50 ML的NO吸附剂时，观察到反应机制的变化。

5. 使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，采用广义梯度近似（GGA-PW91），分析了反应机制中各个步骤的能量，包括NO活化、产物形成和表面物种吸附性质。

The direct NO dissociation path is favored over hydrogen-assisted routes for NO activation on clean Pt(100). This is because NO* dissociation has a lower barrier than hydrogenation to form HNO* or NOH*. The reaction mechanism for N2 and N2O formation involves the reaction of atomic N* with other N* or NO* species, respectively. NH3 formation is kinetically more challenging compared to N2 and N2O formation from N*. At a total NO coverage of 1.00 ML, all four NO adsorbates occupy bridge sites with perpendicular configurations. At 400 K, 0.50 ML NO is the most thermodynamically stable state on Pt(100) within the specified pressure range. The direct NO dissociation path is preferred over H-assisted paths, and N-containing products are formed from atomic N*.

在干净的Pt(100)表面上，直接的NO分解路径优于氢辅助路径用于NO活化。这是因为NO*分解的壁垒低于形成HNO*或NOH*的氢化。N2和N2O的形成反应机制涉及原子N*与其他N*或NO*物种的反应。NH3的形成在动力学上比从N*形成N2和N2O更困难。当总NO覆盖率为1.00 ML时，所有四个NO吸附剂占据桥位并以垂直配置。在400 K下，0.50 ML NO是Pt(100)表面在指定压力范围内的最热力学稳定状态。直接的NO分解路径优于氢辅助路径，并且从N*形成N-含产物。

The study focused on the detailed mechanism of nitric oxide (NO) reduction by hydrogen (H2) on a clean platinum (Pt) surface with a (100) crystal orientation. Four main paths for NO bond activation were identified: direct NO dissociation, hydrogen-assisted NO dissociation (via HNO*, NOH*, or HNOH* intermediates), and formation of N2, N2O, and NH3 products. The most stable site for hydrogen (H*) was found to be the bridge site, while nitrogen (N*) bound with a stronger affinity. NO* on Pt(100) preferred to bind on the bridge site through its nitrogen atom. The direct NO dissociation path was found to be energetically favored over hydrogen-assisted paths. The combination of two atomic N* species to form N2 had the lowest barrier, suggesting N2 might be the major product. NO adsorption phase diagrams indicated that at typical reaction conditions, the Pt(100) surface is likely covered by half a monolayer of NO molecules. The study highlighted the importance of surface coverage in determining the reaction mechanism for NO reduction by H2 on Pt(100).

该研究重点探讨了在纯净铂（Pt）（100）晶面下氢（H2）还原氮氧化物（NO）的详细机理。识别了四个主要的NO键活化路径：直接NO解离、通过HNO*、NOH*或HNOH*中间体的氢辅助NO解离，以及形成N2、N2O和NH3产物的路径。氢（H*）最稳定的结合位点是桥位，而氮（N*）具有更强的结合能力。在Pt(100)上，NO*倾向于通过其氮原子在桥位上结合。直接NO解离路径被发现在所有氢辅助路径中能量最低。两个原子N*物种组合形成N2的路径具有最低的壁垒，这表明N2可能是主要产物。NO吸附相图显示，在典型反应条件下，Pt(100)表面可能覆盖半层NO分子。研究强调了表面覆盖率在确定Pt(100)表面下NO还原由H2引发的反应机制中的重要性。
