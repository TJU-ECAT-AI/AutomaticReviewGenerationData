[1] "We presented a detailed periodic, self-consistent DFT (GGA-PW91) study of the NO reduction by H2 reaction mechanism on clean Pt(100)."
[2] "The NO bond can be activated through different paths: the direct NO dissociation path, the HNO-mediated path, the NOH-mediated path, and the HNOH-mediated path."
[3] "The most stable site for H* is the bridge site (Figure 1a) with a BE of 2.89 eV."
[4] "Among these three atomic species, N* binds the strongest."
[5] "On Pt(100), NO* prefers to bind on the bridge site through the N atom with its molecular axis normal to the surface (Figure 1d), which is consistent with results in the literature."
[6] "The direct NO dissociation path is preferred based on the NO activation mechanism discussed above, leading to adsorbed N* and O* surface species."
[7] "Formation of N2 from the combination of two atomic N* species (R12, N* + N*  N2* + *) is the most straightforward and widely assumed path."
[8] "At the NO* coverage of 1.00 ML, all four NO adsorbates occupy bridge sites with perpendicular configurations."
[9] "At a total coverage of 0.25 ML, NO* prefers to bind to a bridge site through its N atom, with a binding energy of 2.24 eV."
[10] "The direct NO dissociation path is preferred to H-assisted paths via HNO*, NOH*, or HNOH* intermediates."

The study focused on the detailed mechanism of nitric oxide (NO) reduction by hydrogen (H2) on a clean platinum (Pt) surface with a (100) crystal orientation. Four main paths for NO bond activation were identified: direct NO dissociation, hydrogen-assisted NO dissociation (via HNO*, NOH*, or HNOH* intermediates), and formation of N2, N2O, and NH3 products. The most stable site for hydrogen (H*) was found to be the bridge site, while nitrogen (N*) bound with a stronger affinity. NO* on Pt(100) preferred to bind on the bridge site through its nitrogen atom. The direct NO dissociation path was found to be energetically favored over hydrogen-assisted paths. The combination of two atomic N* species to form N2 had the lowest barrier, suggesting N2 might be the major product. NO adsorption phase diagrams indicated that at typical reaction conditions, the Pt(100) surface is likely covered by half a monolayer of NO molecules. The study highlighted the importance of surface coverage in determining the reaction mechanism for NO reduction by H2 on Pt(100).

该研究重点探讨了在纯净铂（Pt）（100）晶面下氢（H2）还原氮氧化物（NO）的详细机理。识别了四个主要的NO键活化路径：直接NO解离、通过HNO*、NOH*或HNOH*中间体的氢辅助NO解离，以及形成N2、N2O和NH3产物的路径。氢（H*）最稳定的结合位点是桥位，而氮（N*）具有更强的结合能力。在Pt(100)上，NO*倾向于通过其氮原子在桥位上结合。直接NO解离路径被发现在所有氢辅助路径中能量最低。两个原子N*物种组合形成N2的路径具有最低的壁垒，这表明N2可能是主要产物。NO吸附相图显示，在典型反应条件下，Pt(100)表面可能覆盖半层NO分子。研究强调了表面覆盖率在确定Pt(100)表面下NO还原由H2引发的反应机制中的重要性。
