[1] "Although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
[2] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS)."
[3] "In this work, we report a series of Fe doped CeO2 as catalysts that show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for the propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as soft oxidant."
[4] "It was confirmed by XRD and Raman characterization that all samples featured single cerianite crystalline phase with periodic lattice Ce ions substituted by Fe ions, with no hematite phase identified."
[5] "Initial screening of catalytic behavior showed that propane ODH pathway was enhanced at high Fe/Ce ratio while propane cracking was suppressed."
[6] "Stable propane conversion and propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours was achieved for the synthesized catalysts with moderate Fe loading."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using traditional oxidants like oxygen leads to uncontrollable reactions, including the combustion of propane and propylene, which significantly reduces the selectivity of propylene production. However, using carbon dioxide (CO2) as an alternative soft oxidant offers several advantages: it avoids deep oxidation of alkanes and alkenes, reduces coke formation, and promotes propane conversion through the participation of produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS). The study presents a series of iron (Fe)-doped ceria (CeO2) catalysts that demonstrate improved stability and catalytic performance in ODH of propane using CO2 as the oxidant. XRD and Raman characterization confirmed the formation of a single cerianite crystalline phase with Fe ions substituting Ce ions, without identifying hematite phase. The initial screening revealed that enhancing the Fe/Ce ratio promoted the ODH pathway while suppressing propane cracking. Catalysts with moderate Fe loading enabled stable propane conversion and high propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours.

在使用传统氧化剂如氧气进行丙烷氧化脱氢时，由于不可避免地会燃烧丙烷以及丙烯生成二氧化碳和一氧化碳，导致丙烯选择性显著降低。然而，将二氧化碳（CO2）作为软氧化剂替代氧气具有几个优势：它可以避免深度氧化烷烃和烯烃、减少焦炭形成，并通过参与产生的氢气参与逆水煤气变换反应（RWGS），从而促进丙烷转化。研究报道了一系列铁（Fe）掺杂的铈氧化物（CeO2）催化剂，在使用CO2作为氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢时展现出增强的稳定性和催化性能。XRD和拉曼光谱表征证实形成了单一的钙钛矿相晶体结构，其中Fe离子取代了Ce离子，没有发现磁铁矿相。初步筛选显示，提高Fe/Ce比例可以促进ODH途径，同时抑制丙烷裂解。负载适度的Fe催化剂实现了长达20小时的稳定丙烷转化和高丙烯选择性。
