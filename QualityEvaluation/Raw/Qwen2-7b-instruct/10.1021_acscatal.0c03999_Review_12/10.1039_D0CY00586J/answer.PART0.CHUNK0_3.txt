<rsc.li/catalysis> C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Traditional oxidants, such as oxygen, enable a straightforward C-H bond activation mechanism, often involving the formation of a radical intermediate followed by a subsequent chemical transformation. In contrast, CO2 activation in redox-inactive catalysts requires a more complex process, typically involving the formation of a surface adsorbate that can be converted into an active site capable of activating C-H bonds.

<rsc.li/catalysis> Different catalysts, including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, demonstrate varying efficiencies in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 catalysts are effective due to their ability to induce surface acid sites, which can facilitate CO2 activation. CeO2, on the other hand, is noted for its oxygen mobility and storage capacity, enabling efficient CO2 activation through direct C=O bond scission. Transition metal clusters show promise due to their localized electronic properties, which can aid in the activation of both CO2 and C-H bonds.

<rsc.li/catalysis> Catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation involves the restoration of the catalyst's activity and structure after a reaction cycle. For redox-active catalysts, regeneration often involves the reduction of oxidized species back to their original state, allowing them to resume their catalytic function. Redox-inactive catalysts, such as CeO2, rely on mechanisms like oxygen redox reactions or structural rearrangements to regenerate their surface active sites. The efficiency of regeneration can impact the overall performance and longevity of the catalyst in continuous operation.

<rsc.li/catalysis> The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by several factors, including the catalyst's ability to create active sites, its interaction with CO2, and its stability under reaction conditions. Factors such as the catalyst's composition, surface area, and pore structure play crucial roles in determining its performance. </rsc.li/catalysis>
