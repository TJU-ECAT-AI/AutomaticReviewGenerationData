The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as those containing vanadium (V2O5, VOx/SiO2), typically rely on strong oxidants like oxygen to facilitate C-H bond breaking. This process often involves the formation of active species capable of undergoing multiple redox cycles, allowing for efficient activation of the alkane and subsequent dehydrogenation. However, these catalysts often suffer from severe deactivation, particularly in the presence of coke formation, which can lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, exemplified by ceria (CeO2) and transition metal clusters, utilize a softer oxidant such as carbon dioxide (CO2) for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. CO2 activation is facilitated by the catalyst's ability to promote direct C=O bond scission, enabling alkane dehydrogenation without the risk of deep oxidation or excessive coke formation. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by their structural characteristics, such as the ability to maintain a high surface area and facilitate the formation of stable surface active sites. The proposed mechanisms involve the participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS), which not only enhances propane conversion but also minimizes coke formation.

Among the mentioned catalysts, ceria (CeO2) stands out as the most promising support due to its unique ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission. The oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria-based catalysts contribute to their enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2. Transition metal clusters, on the other hand, offer the advantage of being able to tune the catalytic performance through the rational selection of the bimetallic composition of active sites, further enhancing their efficiency in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

烷烃的氧化脱氢机制在活性氧化还原和非活性氧化还原金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异。活性氧化还原催化剂，例如含有钒（V2O5，VOx/SiO2）的催化剂，通常依赖于强氧化剂如氧气来促进C-H键断裂。这个过程往往涉及形成能够进行多次氧化还原循环的活性物种，这使得烷烃的有效激活和随后的脱氢成为可能。然而，这些催化剂经常遭受严重的快速失活，尤其是在焦炭形成的情况下，这会导致活性和选择性的降低。

相比之下，非活性氧化还原催化剂，例如铈氧化物（CeO2）和过渡金属簇，利用较软的氧化剂如二氧化碳（CO2）来实现烷烃的氧化脱氢。二氧化碳的激活通过催化剂维持高表面面积并促进直接C=O键裂解而得以实现，从而允许烷烃脱氢而不增加过氧化或焦炭形成的风险。这些催化剂在使用二氧化碳对丙烷进行氧化脱氢的有效性受到其结构特征的影响，尤其是保持稳定表面活性位点的能力。提议的机制涉及生成氢参与逆水煤气变换反应（RWGS），不仅增强了丙烷转化率，而且减少了焦炭形成。

在提及的催化剂中，铈氧化物（CeO2）脱颖而出，因其独特地通过直接C=O键裂解激活二氧化碳的能力而成为最具前景的支持物。铈基催化剂的氧移动性和氧存储能力（OSC）有助于其增强的稳定性以及丙烷氧化脱氢过程中出色的催化性能。另一方面，过渡金属簇通过合理选择活性位点的双金属组成，进一步提高了它们在氧化脱氢过程中的效率，进一步提升了其效率。
