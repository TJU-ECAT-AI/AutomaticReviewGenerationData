In oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as those containing transition metals, play a crucial role in both C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration. These catalysts typically require traditional oxidants, such as oxygen, for activation. The proposed mechanism involves the reduction of transition metal centers to form active sites for the breaking of C-H bonds. However, this process often leads to rapid deactivation due to the formation of coke or other side reactions.

In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like ceria (CeO2), are less prone to deactivation. They utilize CO2 as a soft oxidant, which avoids deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes and reduces coke formation. Ceria-based catalysts have high oxygen mobility and storage capacity, which allows them to store oxygen and release it as needed, facilitating the activation of CO2 and promoting the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

Transition metal clusters, when incorporated into ceria matrices, can enhance the catalytic activity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. These clusters, such as Fe3+, are active for both propane dehydrogenation and CO2 activation. By doping ceria with these metals in various Fe/Ce molar ratios, the catalysts exhibit improved stability and promising performance for propane oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2. The ceria lattice facilitates the formation of stable surface active sites, which are crucial for the efficient conversion of propane into propylene.

The effectiveness of different catalysts, including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and transition metal clusters, in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on their ability to facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds and promote the formation of propylene. The proposed mechanisms involve the activation of CO2 through direct C=O bond scission, facilitated by the oxygen storage capacity of ceria. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are lower in ceria-based systems due to the soft oxidant nature of CO2, which makes the activation process more favorable compared to traditional oxidants.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中，具有还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂，尤其是包含过渡金属的催化剂，在C-H键活化和催化剂再生方面起着关键作用。这些催化剂通常需要传统氧化剂，如氧气，进行激活。提议的机制涉及通过还原过渡金属中心形成活性位点来断裂C-H键。然而，这个过程往往导致快速失活，由于形成了焦炭或其他副反应。

相比之下，无还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂，如铈（CeO2），更不易发生失活。它们利用CO2作为软氧化剂，这可以避免深度氧化烷烃/烯烃并减少焦炭形成。铈基催化剂具有高氧流动性与存储容量，这使得它们能够储存氧气并在需要时释放氧气，从而促进CO2的活化和氧化脱氢过程。

当将这些过渡金属（如Fe3+）簇合物引入铈基矩阵中时，可以增强氧化脱氢丙烷的催化活性。这些簇合物在各种Fe/Ce摩尔比中对丙烷脱氢和CO2活化都具有活性。通过在铈中掺杂这些金属，催化剂显示出改善的稳定性和有前景的性能，用于使用CO2的丙烷氧化脱氢。铈的晶格有助于形成稳定的表面活性位点，这对高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯至关重要。

不同催化剂的有效性，包括V2O5、VOx/SiO2和过渡金属簇合物，对于丙烷氧化脱氢的CO2取决于它们激活C-H键并促进丙烯形成的能力。提出的机制涉及通过直接C=O键断裂来活化CO2，这是由铈的氧存储容量促进的。CO2的分解能量壁垒在铈基系统中较低，由于CO2的软氧化剂性质，这使激活过程更加有利，与传统氧化剂相比。
