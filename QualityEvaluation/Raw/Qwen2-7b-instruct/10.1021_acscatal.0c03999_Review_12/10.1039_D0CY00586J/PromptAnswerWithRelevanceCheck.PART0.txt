[1] "Although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
[2] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS)."
[3] "In this work, we report a series of Fe doped CeO2 as catalysts that show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for the propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as soft oxidant."
[4] "It was confirmed by XRD and Raman characterization that all samples featured single cerianite crystalline phase with periodic lattice Ce ions substituted by Fe ions, with no hematite phase identified."
[5] "Initial screening of catalytic behavior showed that propane ODH pathway was enhanced at high Fe/Ce ratio while propane cracking was suppressed."
[6] "Stable propane conversion and propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours was achieved for the synthesized catalysts with moderate Fe loading."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using traditional oxidants like oxygen leads to uncontrollable reactions, including the combustion of propane and propylene, which significantly reduces the selectivity of propylene production. However, using carbon dioxide (CO2) as an alternative soft oxidant offers several advantages: it avoids deep oxidation of alkanes and alkenes, reduces coke formation, and promotes propane conversion through the participation of produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS). The study presents a series of iron (Fe)-doped ceria (CeO2) catalysts that demonstrate improved stability and catalytic performance in ODH of propane using CO2 as the oxidant. XRD and Raman characterization confirmed the formation of a single cerianite crystalline phase with Fe ions substituting Ce ions, without identifying hematite phase. The initial screening revealed that enhancing the Fe/Ce ratio promoted the ODH pathway while suppressing propane cracking. Catalysts with moderate Fe loading enabled stable propane conversion and high propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as those containing vanadium (V2O5, VOx/SiO2), typically rely on strong oxidants like oxygen to facilitate C-H bond breaking. This process often involves the formation of active species capable of undergoing multiple redox cycles, allowing for efficient activation of the alkane and subsequent dehydrogenation. However, these catalysts often suffer from severe deactivation, particularly in the presence of coke formation, which can lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, exemplified by ceria (CeO2) and transition metal clusters, utilize a softer oxidant such as carbon dioxide (CO2) for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. CO2 activation is facilitated by the catalyst's ability to promote direct C=O bond scission, enabling alkane dehydrogenation without the risk of deep oxidation or excessive coke formation. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by their structural characteristics, such as the ability to maintain a high surface area and facilitate the formation of stable surface active sites. The proposed mechanisms involve the participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS), which not only enhances propane conversion but also minimizes coke formation.

Among the mentioned catalysts, ceria (CeO2) stands out as the most promising support due to its unique ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission. The oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria-based catalysts contribute to their enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2. Transition metal clusters, on the other hand, offer the advantage of being able to tune the catalytic performance through the rational selection of the bimetallic composition of active sites, further enhancing their efficiency in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

烷烃的氧化脱氢机制在活性氧化还原和非活性氧化还原金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异。活性氧化还原催化剂，例如含有钒（V2O5，VOx/SiO2）的催化剂，通常依赖于强氧化剂如氧气来促进C-H键断裂。这个过程往往涉及形成能够进行多次氧化还原循环的活性物种，这使得烷烃的有效激活和随后的脱氢成为可能。然而，这些催化剂经常遭受严重的快速失活，尤其是在焦炭形成的情况下，这会导致活性和选择性的降低。

相比之下，非活性氧化还原催化剂，例如铈氧化物（CeO2）和过渡金属簇，利用较软的氧化剂如二氧化碳（CO2）来实现烷烃的氧化脱氢。二氧化碳的激活通过催化剂维持高表面面积并促进直接C=O键裂解而得以实现，从而允许烷烃脱氢而不增加过氧化或焦炭形成的风险。这些催化剂在使用二氧化碳对丙烷进行氧化脱氢的有效性受到其结构特征的影响，尤其是保持稳定表面活性位点的能力。提议的机制涉及生成氢参与逆水煤气变换反应（RWGS），不仅增强了丙烷转化率，而且减少了焦炭形成。

在提及的催化剂中，铈氧化物（CeO2）脱颖而出，因其独特地通过直接C=O键裂解激活二氧化碳的能力而成为最具前景的支持物。铈基催化剂的氧移动性和氧存储能力（OSC）有助于其增强的稳定性以及丙烷氧化脱氢过程中出色的催化性能。另一方面，过渡金属簇通过合理选择活性位点的双金属组成，进一步提高了它们在氧化脱氢过程中的效率，进一步提升了其效率。

In oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as those containing transition metals, play a crucial role in both C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration. These catalysts typically require traditional oxidants, such as oxygen, for activation. The proposed mechanism involves the reduction of transition metal centers to form active sites for the breaking of C-H bonds. However, this process often leads to rapid deactivation due to the formation of coke or other side reactions.

In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like ceria (CeO2), are less prone to deactivation. They utilize CO2 as a soft oxidant, which avoids deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes and reduces coke formation. Ceria-based catalysts have high oxygen mobility and storage capacity, which allows them to store oxygen and release it as needed, facilitating the activation of CO2 and promoting the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

Transition metal clusters, when incorporated into ceria matrices, can enhance the catalytic activity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. These clusters, such as Fe3+, are active for both propane dehydrogenation and CO2 activation. By doping ceria with these metals in various Fe/Ce molar ratios, the catalysts exhibit improved stability and promising performance for propane oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2. The ceria lattice facilitates the formation of stable surface active sites, which are crucial for the efficient conversion of propane into propylene.

The effectiveness of different catalysts, including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and transition metal clusters, in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on their ability to facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds and promote the formation of propylene. The proposed mechanisms involve the activation of CO2 through direct C=O bond scission, facilitated by the oxygen storage capacity of ceria. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are lower in ceria-based systems due to the soft oxidant nature of CO2, which makes the activation process more favorable compared to traditional oxidants.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中，具有还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂，尤其是包含过渡金属的催化剂，在C-H键活化和催化剂再生方面起着关键作用。这些催化剂通常需要传统氧化剂，如氧气，进行激活。提议的机制涉及通过还原过渡金属中心形成活性位点来断裂C-H键。然而，这个过程往往导致快速失活，由于形成了焦炭或其他副反应。

相比之下，无还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂，如铈（CeO2），更不易发生失活。它们利用CO2作为软氧化剂，这可以避免深度氧化烷烃/烯烃并减少焦炭形成。铈基催化剂具有高氧流动性与存储容量，这使得它们能够储存氧气并在需要时释放氧气，从而促进CO2的活化和氧化脱氢过程。

当将这些过渡金属（如Fe3+）簇合物引入铈基矩阵中时，可以增强氧化脱氢丙烷的催化活性。这些簇合物在各种Fe/Ce摩尔比中对丙烷脱氢和CO2活化都具有活性。通过在铈中掺杂这些金属，催化剂显示出改善的稳定性和有前景的性能，用于使用CO2的丙烷氧化脱氢。铈的晶格有助于形成稳定的表面活性位点，这对高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯至关重要。

不同催化剂的有效性，包括V2O5、VOx/SiO2和过渡金属簇合物，对于丙烷氧化脱氢的CO2取决于它们激活C-H键并促进丙烯形成的能力。提出的机制涉及通过直接C=O键断裂来活化CO2，这是由铈的氧存储容量促进的。CO2的分解能量壁垒在铈基系统中较低，由于CO2的软氧化剂性质，这使激活过程更加有利，与传统氧化剂相比。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes typically involves the activation of C-H bonds, where traditional oxidants like oxygen play a critical role in the redox reactions. Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, effectively utilize oxygen as a strong oxidant to facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts might rely on weaker oxidants or employ a combination of thermal energy and chemical activation to promote the reaction. For instance, ceria (CeO2) and transition metal clusters can also be employed in oxidative dehydrogenation, albeit with differing mechanisms. Ceria is known for its ability to store and release oxygen, which can aid in the activation of CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Transition metal clusters, on the other hand, might offer a more localized and efficient redox site for alkane activation. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 varies, with ceria showing promise due to its unique properties that allow for the efficient activation of CO2 and the promotion of alkane dehydrogenation.

The role of CO2 as a soft oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation is significant. It helps to mitigate deep oxidation of alkanes and alkynes, reduces the formation of coke, and facilitates propane conversion by participating in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS). This property makes CO2 a valuable alternative oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The document showcases the use of iron-doped ceria (Fe-CeO2) as a catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. This system demonstrates enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance compared to traditional redox-active catalysts. The catalyst's performance is attributed to the specific synthesis parameters, including calcination temperature, which affects the formation of a solid solution between iron and ceria, thereby enhancing the catalyst's activity and stability.

The synthesis of the Fe-doped ceria catalysts involves a co-precipitation method followed by calcination at various temperatures. Calcination at 600°C is particularly advantageous because it yields higher specific surface area and forms a Fe-Ce solid solution, rather than two separated cerianite-hematite phases. This optimal synthesis condition is crucial for the catalyst's performance in oxidative dehydrogenation, as it ensures a stable and active surface for the reaction.

烷烃的氧化脱氢通常涉及到C-H键的活化，其中传统的氧化剂如氧气在红ox反应中起着关键作用。活性的金属氧化物催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，通过利用氧气作为强氧化剂来有效地促进C-H键的断裂。相比之下，非活性的金属氧化物催化剂可能依赖于较弱的氧化剂或结合热能和化学激活来促进反应。例如，铈氧化物（CeO2）和过渡金属簇也可以在氧化脱氢中使用，但它们的机制可能有所不同。铈氧化物因其能够存储和释放氧的能力而著称，这有助于活化CO2并促进丙烷的氧化脱氢。过渡金属簇可能提供一个更局部且高效的还原位点来活化烷烃。这些催化剂在活化CO2的有效性各不相同，铈氧化物显示出前景，因为它具有独特的性质，可以高效地活化CO2并促进烷烃脱氢。

作为软氧化剂的CO2在氧化脱氢中的作用至关重要。它有助于避免深度氧化烷烃和炔烃，减少焦炭的形成，并通过参与逆向水煤气变换反应（RWGS）促进丙烷转换。这种特性使得CO2成为丙烷氧化脱氢的有价值的替代氧化剂。

文献展示了铁掺杂铈氧化物（Fe-CeO2）作为使用CO2作为软氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢催化剂的应用。这个系统表现出增强的稳定性和有前景的催化性能与传统的氧化活性催化剂相比。催化剂的性能归因于特定的合成参数，包括煅烧温度，这影响铁和铈之间形成固溶体，从而增强催化剂的活性和稳定性。

Fe掺杂铈氧化物催化剂的合成涉及共沉淀法，随后是不同温度的煅烧。在600°C的煅烧特别有利，因为这提供了更高的比表面积并形成了Fe-Ce固溶体，而不是两个分离的铈酸盐-磁铁矿相。这种最佳合成条件对于氧化脱氢催化剂的性能至关重要，因为它确保了反应表面的稳定性和活性。
