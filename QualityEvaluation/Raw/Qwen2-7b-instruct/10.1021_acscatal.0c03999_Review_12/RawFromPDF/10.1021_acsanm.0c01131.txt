Abstract
Pd-based membranes are used for separation of H2 from different feed stocks; however, their application is limited in the presence of hydrocarbons due to coke deposition on the membrane surface under operation conditions. Herein, we have developed a triple-layered membrane with a nanoporous Linde type A zeolite on the outer side and an ultrathin (1 μm) Pd membrane on the inner side of the Al2O3 hollow fiber substrate. The membrane was successfully synthesized and tested for hydrogen separation in the presence of lighter hydrocarbons. The presence of uniform nanosize pores in the zeolite layer acts as a barrier for the hydrocarbons to come in contact with the Pd membrane and selectively allows H2 to permeate through the membrane. The membrane showed enhanced performance in the presence of lighter hydrocarbons (C3H8 and C3H6) compared to the only internal coated Pd membrane. The membrane showed excellent stability in the presence of propane and propene at 600 °C for 72 h of operation. The triple-layered membrane was used for propane dehydrogenation reaction using 7.5 wt % Cr/Al2O3 catalyst at 600 °C, and the catalytic activity and stability of the catalytic membrane reactor were evaluated. The results revealed a propane conversion in the membrane reactor ∼15% higher than that in the conventional fixed bed catalytic reactor, which is attributed to the continuous removal of hydrogen from the product mixture during the course of the reaction.

1. Introduction
Lighter alkenes are the key building blocks of an enormous range of chemicals and polymers used in different chemical industries. The demand of these olefins is increasing steadily in recent years due to their vast use in polymer, electronic, and automobile industries. (1) Propene is one of the major lighter alkenes which is used for production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, etc. (2) Conventional steam cracking of higher hydrocarbons, such as naphtha and other byproducts of the oil industry, is the widespread means of producing propylene. (3,4) Relatively higher temperature, low selectivity due to different side chain reactions, and increasing oil price have shifted the interest from steam cracking to produce olefins. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation is one of the major techniques for production of propene on a larger scale. The reaction, as given in eq 1, is highly endothermic and requires high temperatures. (2)
(1)
However, at a high temperature, the selectivity for propene production decreases due to cracking of the C–C bond along with the C–H bond. (5) Platinum-based catalysts have been mostly studied for this reaction, which showed good conversion with lower coke formation. (6,7) However, the cost of Pt limits the applicability of these catalysts. Henceforth, non-noble metal-based catalysts are the forefront research topic for the dehydrogenation reaction. (5,8−11) In this context, Cr-based catalysts supported on Al2O3 have been found to be more stable with a lower coke formation. (9,10) Mostly the catalytic conversion of this reaction is equilibrium controlled, and according to Le Chatelier’s principle, the removal of one of the products during the reaction could increase the conversion of the reaction. (12)
H2-permeable membranes are potential candidates to be used for selective removal of hydrogen from the reaction stream. (13−16) Palladium-based membranes are often suggested for a lighter alkane dehydrogenation process to simultaneously and selectively remove the in situ produced hydrogen from the reaction. (17−20) The combination of membrane separation and reaction in a single step helps in instantaneous removal of H2 from the reaction product, thereby increasing the overall conversion. However, the Pd membrane suffers from lower stability in the presence of contaminating gases such as hydrocarbons. (21−24) Especially, in the presence of unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as propene, hydrogen permeation flux decreases drastically in the Pd membranes. The reason being adsorption of hydrocarbons on the surface of the Pd membrane leads to further cracking and deposits coke on the membrane surface. (25) The formation of carbon blocks the active sites for dissociative chemisorption of H2 and decreases the hydrogen permeation flux. Similarly, for the unsaturated hydrocarbons, Pd acts as an active center for hydrogenation, and the generation of highly active unstable intermediate radicals poisons the Pd surface. In the recent past, some of the literature focused on developing a novel zeolite-covered Pd membrane for better stability in the presence of hydrocarbons. (25−28) The presence of a zeolite membrane, with definite pore size on the top of Pd membrane, decreases the poisoning of the membrane from hydrocarbons and increases the stability. In this study, a Linde type A (LTA) zeolite having a pore size of ∼0.4 nm was used as a protective layer for the Pd membrane. (29) The nanoporous zeolite membrane offers stability to the Pd membrane by protecting it from larger molecules. Molecules such as propane and propene having a kinetic diameter of 0.43 and 0.45 nm, respectively, are restricted by the zeolite layer, and only H2 (0.29 nm) is permeated through the membrane.
A few zeolite-covered Pd membranes have been reported in the literature, and all focused on deposition of zeolite directly over the Pd membrane surface. Yu et al. reported the fabrication of a TS-1 zeolite on a Pd membrane for enhanced chemical and cyclic stability. (28) The authors used a seeding and secondary growth technique for growing zeolite over a Pd layer, and the results showed enhanced stability after zeolite coating. However, due to increased mass transfer resistance and surface coverage of zeolite over the Pd membrane, a drastic reduction in hydrogen permeation was observed compared to that on the bare Pd membrane. Similarly, another study by Abate et al. (25) reported the synthesis of a TS-1 zeolite layer over a Pd membrane by a secondary growth hydrothermal method; however, they used a covalent linker to increase the adhesion property of zeolite with the Pd membrane. Yu et al. reported enhanced adhesion properties of zeolite with a Pd membrane using a dilute acid treatment on a Pd membrane. (28) In spite of many studies based on growing a perfect zeolite membrane layer on the Pd surface, it is a still a challenging task to enhance adhesion and homogeneous thin layer formation. This can be attributed to the difference in chemical properties of Pd and zeolite. Moreover, the direct deposition of the zeolite layer on the top of Pd decreases the hydrogen permeation due to a mass transfer resistance. Additionally, the direct growth of a zeolite layer on the Pd membrane is not very uniform compared to that over a porous alumina support. Considering the current state-of-art, herein, we report a sandwiched triple-layered composite membrane with zeolite on the outer layer and a Pd membrane on inner surface of an alumina hollow fiber substrate. The advantages of this type of layered membrane will result in deposition of a homogeneous membrane on both sides of the alumina support and increase the stability. The presence of a finger-like structure inside the hollow fiber offers a porous but smooth surface with a mass transfer resistance much lower than that of normal porous ceramic tubes. (30−34) It has been previously reported that the inner-coated Pd alloy membrane has superior properties compared to those of the outer-coated membrane. (35−37) Therefore, it is believed that the current strategy of coating a Pd layer inside and a zeolite layer outside the alumina hollow fiber substrate will have better thermal and chemical stability.
In the present study, a novel inner-coated Pd membrane protected by zeolite LTA on the outside of an Al2O3 hollow fiber substrate was successfully synthesized. The zeolite layer was deposited on an α-Al2O3 hollow fiber substrate by a secondary growth method. The membrane was tested for hydrogen permeation at a temperature range of 400–600 °C, and the effect of propane and propene was investigated. The membrane was subjected to a stability test for 72 h of duration in the presence of lighter hydrocarbons and showed stable performance. The LTA-sheltered Pd membrane was tested for propane dehydrogenation reaction using 7.5% Cr–Al2O3 catalyst prepared by an evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method. The performance of the membrane reactor was compared to that of the packed bed reactor for net yield of reaction.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Preparation of Pd and LTA-Protected Pd Membrane
Herein, two different membrane layers were deposited on either side of an alumina hollow fiber using different techniques. The inner surface was coated with a Pd membrane using an electroless plating method, whereas the outer layer was coated with a zeolite layer using a secondary growth hydrothermal technique. The α-Al2O3 hollow fiber used in this study was synthesized by a phase inversion method. (38,39) The calcined hollow fibers were thoroughly cleaned in 1 M nitric acid (HNO3) for 4 h followed by washing in DI water. Prior to electroless deposition, the substrate inner surface was seeded by a two-step sensitization/activation process. The process was carried out using acidic solution of SnCl2 (3.7 g/L) and PdCl2 (0.88 g/L) solution. The outer surface of the substrate was protected using Teflon, and the two solutions were flown inside the tube using a peristaltic pump (Masterflex L/S Digital drive). The activated substrate was further subjected to electroless deposition using a hydrazine-based plating bath with the composition reported in our earlier publications. (40) The solution was preheated to 60 °C in a water bath and recirculated inside the activated hollow fiber substrate using the peristatic pump. Hydrazine was added batchwise to the plating solution, and the pH was also adjusted with time by adding drops of NH4OH. After Pd deposition, the membrane was cleaned in DI water until the pH reached the value of ∼7 followed by drying at 100 °C overnight.
The zeolite layer was coated on the outer surface of a Pd-coated alumina hollow fiber using a secondary growth method. LTA zeolite was coated on the outer surface of a Pd-coated membrane after capping both ends with Teflon. The zeolite membrane/seed was prepared using synthesis gel in a molar ratio of 50 Na2O/1 Al2O3/5 H2O/1000 H2O. (41−43) For the seed preparation, the gel was poured inside a Teflon liner of a stainless-steel autoclave, and hydrothermal treatment was carried out for 24 h at 60 °C. The formed LTA zeolite was collected by a centrifugation method, and particle size above 200 μm size was sieved out. The zeolite particles of ≤200 μm size were used as seeds. The cleaned substrate was seeded by a dip coating method using 10 wt % zeolite water suspension. The process was repeated 4–5 times with intermediate drying at 100 °C for 1 h. Finally, the seeded substrate was put inside an autoclave containing freshly prepared gel of similar composition as mentioned previously and treated hydrothermally at 60 °C for 24 h. The membrane was taken out and cleaned thoroughly in deionized water several times to remove the unreacted base or silica residue. The membrane was finally dried overnight at 100 °C and used for hydrogen purification experiments. The overall scheme of the triple-layer fabrication is shown in Scheme 1.
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Fabrication of a Triple-Layer Membrane
The morphology of Pd and zeolite-protected Pd membranes was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL2872). The formation of a zeolite and a zeolite membrane was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis using a Rigaku XRD equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source operated at 40 kV and 30 mA current.
2.2. Hydrogen Permeation through Pd and LTA-Protected Pd Membrane
In this study, we studied two types of Pd membranes: a single-layer internally coated Pd membrane and a triple-layer LTA-protected Pd membrane. The hydrogen purification was tested using the membrane reactor as reported previously; (40) however, a schematic diagram is shown in the Supporting Information Figure S1. The membrane was heated to 300 °C in an inert atmosphere followed by flowing hydrogen. Further, it was activated at 400 °C for 2 h under a hydrogen atmosphere, and the hydrogen flux was measured using a H2/He mixture. Before measuring the hydrogen flux, the membrane was leak tested at 400 °C by filling N2 at 3 bar pressure from the outer side. The gas in the permeated side was analyzed online using a gas chromatograph (GC, HP 6890) using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and the flow rate of the gases was measured using an Agilent ADM digital flow meter. However, we did not detect any nitrogen in the permeate side, which confirms the membrane to be defect-free and highly selective toward hydrogen. The hydrogen permeation experiments for the Pd and LTA-protected Pd membrane was tested by flowing 100 mL of H2 in the feed side and 50 mL of He sweep gas. In order to study the effect of hydrocarbons on hydrogen permeation through the membrane, 10% propane and propene was added at different temperatures by maintaining the hydrogen partial pressure constant. The LTA-protected Pd membrane was also tested for long-term stability in the presence of hydrocarbons.
2.3. Catalyst Synthesis and Activity of Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) Reaction in the Membrane Reactor
Cr supported on mesoporous Al2O3 was prepared using an EISA method. (44) Two grams of PEG–PPG–PEG (Pluronic P123) symmetric triblock copolymer (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 40 mL of absolute ethanol followed by addition of stoichiometric chromium nitrate (Cr(NO3)3). Aluminum isopropoxide (C9H21O3Al) was added to the solution followed by the dropwise addition of 3.2 mL of HNO3 and stirred overnight to dry. The solution was dried at 60 °C for 48 h. The catalyst was calcined at 700 °C for 4 h at a slow ramping rate to remove the organic template. The catalyst was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to study the morphology and distribution of Cr on the substrate. Propane dehydrogenation study of the catalyst was studied at 600 °C using 10% propane and a He mixture. PDH reaction was also investigated using LTA-protected Pd membrane at 600 °C using a catalytic membrane reactor. For the catalytic membrane reactor, the shell side of the membrane was filled with the catalyst and both ends were packed with quartz wool to hold the catalyst, and a quartz spacer was used to hold the catalyst bed. The propane conversion (% XC3H8) and selectivity (% SC3H6) toward propene formation were measured according to eqs 2 and 3:

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Hydrogen Permeation in Pd Membrane and Effect of Hydrocarbons
The SEM images of an internally coated Pd membrane are shown in Figure 1a, which clearly indicates formation of a dense ∼1 μm Pd layer inside the Al2O3 hollow fiber substrate. No pinholes or defects were observed after the surface morphology was analyzed at random places, as evident from Figure 1b.
Figure 1
Figure 1. SEM image of a (a) cross section of the Pd membrane and (b) surface of a Pd membrane.
The figure also shows uniform and strong interaction between the metallic membrane and the porous substrate. Further, it can be observed that the Pd membrane is penetrating through the finger-like asymmetric pores of the alumina hollow fiber substrate. For better visualization of the membrane adherence with the substrate, a zoomed-in image of the membrane is shown in Figure S2, which highlights the portion of membrane deposited well inside the hollow fiber pores. These results indicate the good adhesive properties of the inner-coated Pd membrane, as observed previously in the literature. (23,35,40) Hydrogen permeation experiments were carried out at a 1 bar feed pressure using N2 as the carrier gas. The experiments were conducted using 20% impurity (He, C3H8, and C3H6) gases in a hydrogen stream. The effect of hydrocarbons on hydrogen permeation as a function of temperature is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2
Figure 2. (a) Hydrogen permeation in the Pd membrane at different temperature and feed conditions, and (b) H2 permeation with time under different feed conditions at 600 °C.
The H2 flux through the Pd membrane is recorded after 45 min of stability at each reaction temperature. It is evident from Figure 2 that the hydrogen permeation increases with an increase in temperature for the H2/He mixture, which can be attributed to the activated diffusion of hydrogen atoms with an increase in temperature. The activation energy of hydrogen permeation was calculated by plotting the logarithm of hydrogen flux (ln(F) vs inverse of temperature (T(K)), and the value of Ea was found to be 11.7 ± 0.1 kJ/mol. This indicates that the hydrogen permeation through the membrane follows a solution diffusion mechanism. (13) However, in the presence of contaminant gases, such as C3H8 and C3H6, the hydrogen permeation is decreased due to the competitive adsorption of these gases on the Pd surface. In the presence of 10% propane, the H2 flux increases with temperature; nevertheless, the flux is lower than that in the presence of 20% He. It is vital to note that after ∼500 °C, the hydrogen permeation flux decreased. This is due to adsorption of propane and also mild dehydrogenation of propane on the Pd surface at ∼500 °C. Interestingly, the hydrogen flux decreased drastically in the presence of C3H6 with rise in temperature. This decrease in hydrogen permeation flux can be attributed to the stronger interaction of the carbonaceous species on the Pd surface, which leads to coke deposition on the membrane. Thus, it is inferred that C3H6 has a detrimental effect on hydrogen permeation compared to C3H8. This can be accredited to the coverage of active Pd sites by the π-electron cloud of C3H6. The vacant d-orbital of the Pd may overlap with the π-bonded orbital of C3H6 and results in stronger adsorption of C3H6 on the metal surface. (23) Further, the cracking of the adsorbed species on the Pd surface deposits a tremendous amount of carbon and decreases the hydrogen flux. Abir et al. (45) proposed that each propene molecule covers three active sites and also predicted that the deactivation of the membrane in the presence of propene is mainly due coke deposition on the membrane surface formed via dissociation or polymerization of propene. Peters et al. (19) also observed similar deactivation in the performance Pd–Ag and Pd–Cu alloy membranes in the presence of C3H8 and C3H6 at 450 °C. The effect of lighter hydrocarbons on the performance of a Pd–Ag alloy membrane was studied by Montesinos et al., (21) and they reported the stronger effect of unsaturated hydrocarbon on hydrogen permeation compared to saturated hydrocarbons. Further, the H2 flux as a function of time in the stream at 600 °C is shown in Figure 2b. The results indicated a sharp decline in the flux after the membrane was exposed to the different hydrocarbon impurities, especially C3H6.
It is observed that exposure to C3H6 drastically decreases the hydrogen permeation, and after 2 h of exposure to propene, the membrane was spoiled due to cracks in the membrane surface. After at otal of 8 h of operation, the membrane was found to have a significant amount of carbon deposition on the surface, and the growth of the carbon layer on the Pd surface generated strain on the membrane, thereby causing cracks on the membrane. The morphology of the membrane after exposure to 10% propene was evaluated by SEM, and it is evident that amorphous and thin filamentous carbon fibers are deposited on the membrane surface, as shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3
Figure 3. SEM image of membrane after propene exposure with (a) deformed and cracked membrane and (b) deposited carbon on the surface.
The SEM image of the complete membrane is shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information, which further depicts that the deposited carbon blocked the passage of gas in the permeate side and no H2 flux was recorded in the permeate side. The amount of carbon deposited was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) by heating the membrane in powder form in the presence of air. The differential thermal analysis, as shown in Figure S4, shows two exothermic peaks at 510 and 615 °C, indicating the formation of both amorphous and graphitic carbon, respectively. The TGA graph indicates a sharp decrease in weight of around 10% due to complete oxidation of deposited carbon, proving the adverse effect of unsaturated hydrocarbons on the Pd membrane. The slight increase in the mass of the membrane in TGA after 700 °C may be due to the shift in baseline in the TGA signal. Any chemical change or structural change in the signal may be accompanied by a relatively sharper peak. However, here, only a slight increase is due to the baseline shift in the TGA instrument. To this end, this work proposes a novel triple-layer composite membrane to prevent the Pd membrane from the hydrocarbons; a detailed experimental result and performance will be discussed in additional sections.
3.2. Synthesis and Characterization of a Triple-Layer Membrane
In order to avoid the decreased effect of hydrocarbons on Pd membrane performance, a triple-layer membrane geometry is explored (as shown in Figure 4), in which a dense Pd membrane in the inner side and LTA zeolite layer on the outer side of an Al2O3 hollow fiber substrate was coated.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Schematic of the triple-layered membrane, inside Pd and outside LTA zeolite on an Al2O3 hollow fiber.
The LTA zeolite layer protection on the outer side of the substrate will prevent the Pd membrane from contaminating the species. Prior to the zeolite deposition on the alumina substrate, the synthesis condition of zeolite was optimized and also the thermal stability of the zeolite under different treatment conditions was evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis after different treatments. The XRD pattern of the zeolite after different thermal treatment is shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5
Figure 5. XRD image of LTA zeolite, (a) as-synthesized, (b) after calcination at 600 °C, and (c) after treatment with C3H8 at 600 °C.
The XRD pattern of the freshly prepared zeolite shows peaks corresponding to LTA and all the diffraction pattern matches with the reference lines, which indicates the phase purity of the zeolite. (46) Due to the similar gel composition, it is possible to have diffractions lines corresponding to several other zeolites such as hydroxy sodalite (H-SOD), Z-21 phases along with the XRD patterns of LTA. The presence of different zeolite phases depends on the hydrothermal conditions and synthesis solution composition. (28) The molar ratio of the synthesis solution for LTA and H-SOD are similar; however, the temperature and hydrothermal time are two critical parameters for the formation of a single and phase pure zeolite crystal. (47) In this study, the XRD pattern shows that the hydrothermal temperature of 60 °C at 24 h of hydrothermal time is the ideal condition for formation of perfectly crystalline LTA zeolite. Decreasing the hydrothermal time results in formation of an imperfect and amorphous phase. Furthermore, the XRD pattern of LTA after thermal treatment at 600 °C and heating in the presence of propane shows no change in the diffraction pattern. This result confirms that the zeolite phase remains intact even at higher temperatures and under hydrocarbon treatment, which indicates that the zeolite membrane is a potential material to be used for propane dehydrogenation at 600 °C. The SEM image of the LTA-protected Pd membrane is shown in Figure 6, which depicts the formation a ∼1 μm Pd membrane inside the hollow fiber (Figure 6a) and a homogeneous and defect-free zeolite membrane (Figure 6b) on the outer side.
Figure 6
Figure 6. SEM images (a,b) of the surface view of Pd and LTA membrane and (c,d) cross-sectional view of Pd and LTA membranes, respectively
The superior adherence properties of the inner-coated Pd membrane with the substrate can be observed from the cross-sectional image of the Pd membrane (Figure 6c). The synthesis of the zeolite membrane takes place via nucleation and crystal growth over the preseeded substrate. Many literature reports have focused on the synthesis of a homogeneous zeolite layer over an alumina substrate by a secondary growth method with different pretreatment methods. (28,41,48,49) In order to increase the adhesion properties and uniform growth of a zeolite layer, different seeding and pretreatment methods have been used in those studies. However, the use of organic chemicals such as toluene, 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES), etc., may poison the Pd membrane layer during the hydrothermal treatment. (50) Huang et al. used a vacuum seeding method to deposit a smooth and highly uniform zeolite layer over the hollow fiber substrate without using any organic reagents. (41) In this study, simple seeding and a secondary growth method were adopted for growing a LTA zeolite layer over an α-Al2O3 hollow fiber. Hence, during the hydrothermal treatment, the Pd membrane layer was not contaminated. Further, the formation of the triple-layer membrane was also confirmed by XRD analysis by grinding the membrane to a powder. The XRD pattern of the triple-layer membrane is shown in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information. The diffractions due to a metallic Pd phase are observed at 2θ ∼ 39.96 and ∼46.5° along with diffractions due to an α-Al2O3 phase. Besides the diffractions of α-Al2O3 and metallic Pd phases, weak diffractions due to LTA zeolites are also observed. The difference in intensities of these peaks can be ascribed to the percentage of each phase present in the sample and their crystallinity.
3.3. Hydrogen Permeation in the Triple-Layer Membrane
Hydrogen flux through the LTA-protected Pd membrane as a function of temperature using different gas mixtures is shown in Figure 7.
Figure 7
Figure 7. H2 permeation in the LTA-protected Pd membrane under different gas compositions as a function of temperature.
It is evident from the figure that the hydrogen permeation in this membrane in the presence of hydrocarbons is slightly lower than that in inert gas (N2). This may be ascribed to the adsorption of the contaminant gases on the membrane surface. Further, it can be also observed that, after the zeolite layer is coated, the H2 flux decreased than an unprotected Pd membrane in the absence of any impurities. A comparison of H2 permeance in zeolite-protected membranes reported in the literature and the current result is shown in Table S1. It is evident from the table that there is an obvious decrease in H2 permeance after zeolite protection. In the present investigation, a zeolite protection layer caused ∼27% H2 permeance reduction at 600 °C and 1 bar pressure. This may be attributed to the mass transfer resistance due to the outer zeolite layer. However, H2 flux remains unaffected in the presence of C3H8 and C3H6 with an increase in temperatures. The results clearly indicate that the LTA-protected membrane is efficient at purifying hydrogen from a stream containing hydrocarbon impurities. Further, from the figure, it is observed that the H2 flux in a zeolite-coated membrane does not behave linearly with temperature. Such behaviors can be ascribed to the interference of a zeolite layer in H2 permeation, where the molecular transport follows a Knudsen diffusion mechanism. As a result, at higher temperatures, a nonlinearity in the H2 flux is observed in the triple-layer membrane. The stability of the membrane in the presence of propane and propene was evaluated for a period of 72 h at 600 °C, and the H2 flux was found to remain unchanged over the entire period of investigation, as shown in Figure 8.
Figure 8
Figure 8. Stability test of the Pd-LTA membrane for hydrogen purification using 10% C3H8 and C3H6 in hydrogen for 72 h.
However, a slightly decrease in perm-selectivity was observed after ∼72 h of operation. This may be due to the growth of the grain boundary and sintering after a prolonged heating at 600 °C, which may have caused small pinholes or leakage in the sealant position. However, the purity of permeated hydrogen was maintained at ≥99.9%, which indicates the membrane can still meet the criteria for hydrogen purification. The spent membrane was characterized by SEM and TGA to investigate the morphology and coke formation after the stability test. From the TGA image shown in Figure S9a, it is evident that there is a negligible amount of coke deposited on the membrane. Also, the SEM image shown in Figure S9b depicts a defect-free Pd membrane after the 72 h stability test. The two images clearly illustrate the viability of the LTA layer as a protective barrier for a Pd membrane from contaminating gases.
3.4. Catalytic Activity of Propane Dehydrogenation Reaction
The membrane was found to be efficient for purifying hydrogen from feedstock containing lighter hydrocarbons, such as propane and propene. Therefore, its applicability for propane dehydrogenation was evaluated using a catalytic membrane reactor. A 7.5%Cr/Al2O3 catalyst was used for the propane dehydrogenation reaction at 600 °C using a fixed bed reactor (FBR) and catalytic membrane reactor (CMR).
The characteristics of the catalyst were analyzed by XRD and transmission electron microscopy. The XRD patterns of the 7.5 wt % Cr/Al2O3 catalyst are shown in Figure S6, and the absence of diffractions corresponding to any kind of CrOx phases indicates good distribution of the species within the mesoporous structure. The XRD pattern further indicates the poor crystallinity of the sample. The TEM images of the fresh catalyst (Figure S7) depict the incorporation of CrOx species inside the hexagonal mesoporous structure. The EDS mapping of the catalyst shown in Figure S8 also confirms the good dispersion of CrOx species within the catalyst surface. This result suggests the excellent metal to support interaction for the 7.5 wt % Cr/Al2O3 catalyst, which is a required parameter to show stable and high catalytic performance. The propane dehydrogenation activity of the 7.5 wt % Cr/Al2O3 catalyst was evaluated, and the comparative results are presented in Figure 9.
Figure 9
Figure 9. Propane dehydrogenation over the 7 wt % Cr/Al2O3 catalyst in (a) FBR and (b) triple-layer CMR at 600 °C at a total flow of 30 mL/min using 30% C3H8.
The PDH activity in the CMR was found to be higher than that in the fixed bed reactor, and a ∼15% increment in the activity was achieved after being integrated in the membrane reactor. The performance of the catalyst is relatively stable in the membrane reactor. However, there is a slow decrease in the catalyst activity in both the cases, and this may be ascribed to the coke deposition on the catalyst. The slow decrease in the activity is also mostly due to the formation of bulk phase Cr2O3 in the catalyst, as evident from the spent catalyst XRD analysis shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S6). The coke deposition is mainly due to thermal C–C bond cleavage rather than the selective C–H bond breaking (eqs 4 and 5). The reactions given in the equations describe the possible pathways for formation of other impurities such as CH4 and C2H6 along with C3H6. The formation of these products decreases the selectivity of propane and causes coke deposition on the catalyst surface, thereby decreasing the catalytic activity with time. The cracking reaction may be slightly higher in the membrane reactor, due to the lower partial pressure of H2 in the reaction side. The decreased H2 concentration also caused the formation of Cr2O3 in the catalyst, which is responsible for the decrease in propylene selectivity in the membrane reactor. The coke deposited in the spent catalyst was evaluated by TGA, as shown in Figure S10. The figure depicts a lower amount of coke formation on the catalyst.

From this study, it can be concluded that the zeolite layer plays a vital role in protecting the Pd membrane from coke formation (due to reaction with the hydrocarbons). The membrane is stable enough at high temperature (600 °C) and in the presence of contaminating gases (C3H8, C3H6). Further, the membrane reactor is successfully applied for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. All of these results confirm the potential role of this triple-layer membrane for different dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions of several hydrocarbons.
4. Conclusion
A triple-layer membrane with LTA zeolite on the outer side and ultrathin (∼1 μm) Pd membrane in the inner side of an Al2O3 hollow fiber substrate was successfully synthesized and tested for hydrogen separation in the presence of lighter hydrocarbons and propane dehydrogenation applications. The triple-layered membrane showed superior performance in the presence of lighter hydrocarbons (C3H8, and C3H6) compared to that with only an internal coated Pd membrane. The triple-layered membrane showed excellent thermal stability in the presence of propane and propene at 600 °C for 72 h of operation. The uniform nanosize pores (0.4 nm) in the LTA zeolite effectively blocked the hydrocarbon molecules. The membrane was demonstrated for a propane dehydrogenation application using 7.5 wt % Cr/Al2O3 as the PDH catalyst at 600 °C. Comparatively, the catalytic membrane reactor gave a propane conversion ∼15% higher than that of a conventional fixed bed reactor and maintained similar propene selectivity. The increase in the catalytic activity is mainly attributed to simultaneous removal of hydrogen from the product mixture during the course of a propane dehydrogenation reaction. Finally, the results of this study open the path for the application of H2-permeable membranes for various high-temperature hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions, where the cause of diminished H2 permeability is the instability of Pd or Pd alloy membranes with lighter hydrocarbon reactions.
