Abstract
Oxidized diamond demonstrated excellent support for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes in the presence
of CO2. Oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibited comparatively higher catalytic activities in the
dehydrogenation of lower alkanes in the presence of CO2. In the dehydrogenation of propane, the oxidized diamond-supported
Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts in the presence of CO2 afforded nearly twofold higher activities than that in the absence of CO2.
The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane increased with increasing
reaction temperatures. Furthermore, in the dehydrogenation of n-butane and iso-butane, a promoting effect of CO2 on butane
conversion and butenes yields was observed over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, though the
promotion effect was small.
UV-Vis analyses of the fresh and the reacted catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2 revealed that CO2 kept the
surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a state of oxidation slightly higher than that in the absence of CO2.

1. Introduction
Surface chemistry of diamond has received much
recent attention [1–3]. However, diamond or oxi-

has not yet been exploited. Further applications of

diamond-supported catalyst need to be developed.
Diamond has long been chemically considered an
inert material. One of the present authors introduced
the thesis that the surface of the diamond behaved as
organic substances in certain chemical reactions [1].
The diamond surface is expected to have possibility
of chemical reactivities as an organic substance [3].
This led us to develop novel utilization of diamond as
the material of a catalyst or as a catalyst support for
chemical reactions [4–6].

The diamond surface is easily oxidized by oxida-
tive acids such as HNO3, HClO, H2O2, etc., and is
also oxidized with O2 at an elevated temperature to
form C–O–C ether type structures and C=O carbonyl
type structures [1,2]. The oxidized diamond surface is
expected to behave as a “carbon oxide” for speciﬁed
surface reactions such as catalytic, electrochemical
reactions. Given that such reactions are controlled
via the interaction between molecules and surfaces,
the bulk structure of solids is comparatively less im-
portant. The SiO2 is widely used for many catalytic
reactions as a neutral support. SiO2 support has weak
interactions with some metals and metal oxides and
plays an important role in the yield of active reaction
sites. The interaction of the oxidized diamond with
metals/metal oxides should be weaker than that of
SiO2 and may have unique characteristics.
The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes has con-
siderable industrial impact, because it represents a
route by which to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of
low-cost saturated hydrocarbons [7]. At present, light
alkenes are obtained by steam cracking natural gas
and naphtha, and ﬂuid catalytic cracking that occurs
in petroleum reﬁning. Effective and selective conver-
sion of lower alkanes to unsaturated hydrocarbons is
a current research target of chemical industries.
Dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes can be
carried out thermally to produce molecular hydrogen
as a by-product:
CnH2n+2 ⇄CnH2n + H2
(1)
However, the thermodynamics of this reaction in-
volved endothermic reactions, so the equilibrium
greatly favors alkanes at lower temperatures when the
reaction is carried out under atmospheric pressure.
The equilibrium shifts to the left side by increasing a
reaction temperature with excess steam as a diluent.
The following oxidative dehydrogenation of alka-
nes using oxygen as an oxidant of alkanes has been
proposed as effective in decreasing reaction tempera-
ture.
CnH2n+2 + 1
2O2 →CnH2n + H2O
(2)
However, several problems, such as the removal of
the heat of reaction, control of the selectivity due
to the production of undesired carbon oxides, and
the ﬂammability of the reaction mixtures, which may
cause a runaway reaction, must be overcome.
Among the many catalytic dehydrogenation reac-
tions, the weak oxidation capability of CO2 in the deh-
ydrogenation of ethane to ethylene has been our recent
focus [8–10]. Recently, several attempts were made to
use carbon dioxide as an oxidant for the coupling of
methane [11–13], and the dehydrogenation of ethyl-
benzene [14–18], iso-propylbenzene [19], propane
[20,21], or iso-butane [22]. However, little discussion
on the role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation
of alkane, as follows, has yet been published.
CnH2n+2 + CO2 →CnH2n + CO + H2O
(3)
In this report, we focus on the application of oxidized
diamond as an extension of the previous dehydrogena-
tion of ethane to the dehydrogenation of C3–C4 alka-
nes to C3–C4 alkenes using CO2. We have found that
the oxidized diamond-supported-Cr2O3 or V2O5 cat-
alysts markedly promoted dehydrogenation of C3–C4
alkanes to C3–C4 alkenes under CO2. The oxidized
diamond exhibited excellent potential as a support
material for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions.
2. Experimental
Commercially available ﬁne-powdered diamond
was used for this study. The diamond powder was
washed with HNO3 to remove metallic impurities,
then rinsed thoroughly with distilled water. Before
oxidation, to prepare homogeneous surface condi-
tions, the diamond powder was ﬁrst hydrogenated
at 1173 K for 1 h under pure H2 stream. The hydro-
genated diamond powder was then oxidized at 723 K
for 1 h under O2 stream (O2:Ar = 1:4). The oxidized
diamond is known to contain oxygenated species with
C–O–C and C=O structures [1,2].
Catalysts were prepared by impregnating aqueous
solutions of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, NH4
VO3 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), Ga(NO3)3·
8H2O (Kishida Chemicals), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, and
(CH3COO)2Mn·4H2O (Wako Pure Chemical Indus-
tries), to Al2O3 (JRC-ALO-4, the reference cata-
lyst provided by the Catalysis Society of Japan),
SiO2 (Merck), activated carbon (Wako Pure Chemi-
cal Industries), and oxidized diamond (BET surface
area = 12.6 m2 g−1), then the impregnated materials
were evaporated to dryness. Supported catalysts were
calcined at 723 K for 3 h in air prior to the reaction.

The reaction was carried out with a ﬁxed-bed ﬂow
type quartz reactor (i.d. 10 mm × 350 mm) at 1 atm
pressure. Using 200 mg of a catalyst, 25–27 ml/min
CO2 (or Ar) and 5–3 ml/min of alkane (propane,
iso-butane, or n-butane) were introduced at temper-
ature ranges of 823–973 K. Prior to the reaction, the
catalysts were heated in Ar. Products were analyzed
by gas chromatography.
The surface area of the catalyst was measured by
the BET method using N2 at 77 K with an automatic
Micromeritics Gemini model 2375.
The catalysts, treated under different conditions,
were analyzed by UV-Vis diffuse reﬂectance spec-
troscopy
with
a

(V-550)

meter.

We have already reported that CO2 markedly pro-
moted dehydrogenation of ethane over the oxidized

tivity to give ethylene [4].
Fig. 1 and Table 1 show propylene yields on various
oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts
in the presence or absence of CO2 at a temperature
range of 873–898 K. Thermal dehydrogenation oc-
curred to give a propylene yield of only ca. 2.5% in
both CO2 and Ar atmosphere at 898 K. Promoting
effects of CO2 on the propylene yield were observed
over oxidized diamond-supported Cr, V, and Ga cata-
lysts (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The activity of the oxidized
diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts in the
presence of CO2 was two times higher than that in the
absence of CO2 at 898 K (Fig. 1). Dehydrogenation
of propane in the presence of CO2 over the oxi-
dized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts
produced mainly propylene (C3H6). The promoting
effect of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 on
the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst has
been reported, and the ethylene yield was 22.5%
with ethylene selectivity of 86.7% at 923 K [4]. In
the case of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3
and V2O5 catalysts, dehydrogenation of propane was
also promoted in the presence of CO2, However, sec-
ondary reactions such as decomposition to methane,

In the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5
catalysts, propylene yields were 13.2 and 10.8% at
898 K, respectively. One of the characteristic features
of diamond support is a higher propane conversion
compared with those of other metal oxides.

823 K on vanadium oxide catalysts loaded on several
supports, in the presence or absence of carbon diox-
ide. The support activity order at the reaction tem-
perature of 823 K was oxidized diamond > Al2O3 >

est rate of propylene production (170 × 10−4 mmol

alysts. Propylene yield under CO2 ﬂow was twice as
high as that under Ar ﬂow.
The effect of loading level of vanadium oxide on
the dehydrogenation of propane over the oxidized
diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst in the presence and
absence of CO2 were examined (Table 2). The propy-
lene yield as a function of the reaction temperature is
shown in Fig. 3. Propylene yields in the non-catalytic
runs did not depend upon atmosphere. In the presence

of carbon dioxide over oxidized diamond-supported
vanadium oxide catalyst, propylene yields remark-
ably increased with increasing reaction tempera-
ture, and 13.8% of propylene yield was obtained
at 923 K. In addition, CO was formed during the
temperature-programmed reaction with CO2 after the
dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2
over the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst.
In the dehydrogenation of alkane, carbon deposition
is one of the serious problems. In the dehydrogena-
tion of alkane over the oxidized diamond-supported
catalysts, carbon deposition was observed. Notably,

the carbon deposition in the presence of CO2 was less
than that in the absence of CO2.
In dehydrogenation under a CO2 atmosphere, the
roles of CO2 would be considered as follows:
CO2 + H2 ⇄CO + H2O
(4)
CO2 + C ⇄2CO
(5)
Therefore, two possible explanations for the increased
conversion of dehydrogenation reaction in the pres-
ence of CO2 are plausible. One is that the removal of
hydrogen from products shifts equilibrium (reaction
(4)), and the other is that elimination of deposited
carbon (reaction (5)) occurs. Similar tendencies were
observed with Cr2O3 and V2O5-loaded catalysts. De-
hydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2
using the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and
V2O5 catalysts was noticeably promoted by increas-
ing the reaction temperature. Under Ar atmosphere
at 923 K, C3H8 conversion showed the same value as
that of thermal reaction.
At 823 K no signiﬁcant effect of loading level of
V2O5 was observed on the propane conversion and
propylene yield.
In the dehydrogenation of propane under CO2, ox-
idized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts
afforded higher C3H6 conversions. It is considered that
the CO2 played a role in the shift of equilibrium and
in the elimination of deposited carbon.

oxide catalysts in the presence or absence of CO2
at 873 K. Small promoting effects of CO2 on the
n-butane conversion were observed upon the oxidized
diamond-supported V2O5 and Cr2O3 catalysts. Dehy-
drogenation of n-butane in the presence CO2 over the
oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst produced
mainly trans-2-butene, CO, and H2.
Fig. 5 shows the results of the iso-butene yield at
873 K in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane on various
oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts in
the presence or absence of CO2. The order of activity
of various oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide
catalysts in the presence of CO2 at 873 K was as fol-
lows: V2O5 = Cr2O3 > Ga2O3 > ZnO > ZrO2 >
Fe2O3. A very small promoting effect of CO2 on the
iso-butane conversion was observed upon the oxidized
diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst.
In the dehydrogenation of ethane under CO2 atmo-
sphere, a large promoting effect on the ethylene yield
was observed over the oxidized diamond-supported
Cr2O3 catalyst [4]. However, the promoting effect of
carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3 and C4
alkanes under a CO2 atmosphere was small compared
with that in the dehydrogenation of ethane. The weak
promoting effect of CO2 atmosphere in the cases of
C3 and C4 alkanes might be ascribed to the fact that
lower reaction temperatures were applied in order to
obtain considerable conversions, since the bond disso-
ciation energy of CH2 or CH groups in propane, bu-
tane, and iso-butane are lower than that of CH3 in
ethane. In the dehydrogenation of a higher alkane,
the produced alkenes contains allylic hydrogen, which
has much lower bond dissociation energy than that of
starting alkanes. Thus, abstraction of hydrogen from
the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to give
coke precursors. Deactivation of the catalyst could not
be avoided, consequently giving decreases in alkene
yields.
3.3. UV-Vis characterization of oxidized
diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts
In order to understand the role that CO2 plays in
relation to the catalyst surface or oxidation states of
catalysts in the dehydrogenation reactions, UV-Vis
measurements were carried out. Fig. 6 shows the
UV-Vis diffuse reﬂectance spectra of the oxidized
diamond-supported Cr (5 wt.%) catalyst. For the fresh
catalyst, four peaks appeared, one each at about 275,
370, 460, and 600 nm. The peaks of 275 and 370 nm

corresponded to Cr6+, and the peaks of 460 and
600 nm to Cr3+ [23,24]. From these results, the fresh
catalyst had both valency states of Cr6+ and Cr3+.
The peak of Cr6+ after dehydrogenation of propane
in the presence of CO2 slightly strengthened as com-
pared to that reacted in the presence of Ar. This result
indicates that the chromium oxide could sustain a
higher oxidation state. Wang reported on the dehy-
drogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 over
Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst and found that Cr3+ and Cr6+
coexist on the surface of the catalyst. They proposed
that the redox property played an important role in the
dehydrogenation of alkane under a CO2 atmosphere
[25].
Fig. 7 shows the UV-Vis diffuse reﬂectance spec-
tra of the oxidized diamond-supported V (5 wt.%) cat-
alyst. Fresh catalyst exhibited absorptions at around
270 and 400 nm. The peaks of 270 and 400 nm indi-
cated the presence of tetrahedral V5+ species [18,26].
Both of the catalysts used in the presence and ab-
sence of CO2 exhibited absorptions at 270 and 400 nm,
and in addition to these, a very broad new peak at
around 600 nm appeared. This peak corresponded to
V4+ [18,26]. It is obvious that the reduction of the
vanadium species during dehydrogenation of propane

occurred in both the presence and absence of CO2.
However, the V5+ peak of 400 nm in the presence of
Ar was slightly weaker than that in the presence of
CO2. This result indicated that CO2 slightly oxidized
vanadium species during the reaction in the presence
of CO2.
The oxidized diamond-supported V (5 wt.%) cat-
alyst did not afford a high ethylene yield in the
dehydrogenation of ethane [4]. However, it exhibited
high catalytic activities for the dehydrogenation of C3
and C4 alkanes. In general, it seems to be difﬁcult to
maintain a high valency state of vanadium oxides at
higher temperatures under a low oxygen partial pres-
sure. Dehydrogenation of ethane over the oxidized
diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst was carried out
above 923 K [4]. In contrast, dehydrogenation of C3
and C4 alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported
catalysts was mainly carried out under 893 K. There-
fore, the vanadium oxide in the high oxidation states
was maintained due to lower reaction temperatures,
and the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst
could produce high catalytic activities.
We propose that maintenance of the higher oxida-
tion state of chromium and vanadium species might
be one of the important factors for high catalytic

activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the
presence of CO2.
4. Conclusion
Among oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide
catalysts, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and
V2O5 catalysts exhibited the highest alkene yield for
the dehydrogenation of C3–C4 alkanes in the pres-
ence of CO2. A support effect of oxidized diamond
for Cr2O3- and V2O5-loaded catalysts was observed in
the presence of CO2. Propylene yields over oxidized
diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst were increased with
increasing reaction temperature.
The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of lower
alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3
and V2O5 catalysts might be to maintain a higher ox-
idation state of chromium and vanadium species.
