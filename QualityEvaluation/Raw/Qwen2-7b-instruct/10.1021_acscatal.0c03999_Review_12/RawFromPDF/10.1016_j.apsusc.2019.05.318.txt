Abstract 
The study of the effect of particle size and low coordination sites in metal nanoparticles (Cun, 
Agn and Aun with n = 19, 38, 55, 79 and 116) on the reduction of NO2 to NO + O, was carried out 
using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. All metal nanoparticles have shown to be more 
favorable for the NO2 adsorption than the (111) extended surfaces. The adsorption energy order of 
NO2 found for both configurations, O-down (most stable) and N-down, was Cu > Ag > Au. The 
dissociation energy values of NO2 on Cu and Ag nanoparticles decrease with the increment of the 
particle size, however, considering the activation barrier values, the most reactive substrates evaluated 
were Cu(111) surface, and the Cu19, Cu116. The activation barriers (Eact) for the larger nanoparticles, 
were obtained using a non-traditional relationship of Brönsted Evans Polanyi (BEP), from the Eact 
calculated on the smaller ones. The BEP relations highly depend on the reaction product 
configurations and also on the structure of the active site. Notwithstanding that the nanoparticles 
improve the NO2 adsorption and the dissociation energies are lower than those corresponding to the 
extended surfaces, the activation barriers are higher.

Introduction 
Reduction reactions involving NOx are of great interest in many fields of basic and applied 
research, including surface science,1 environmental catalysis2,3 and many areas of biology and 
physiology.4 The formation of NOx products is a consequence of incomplete combustion of fossil 
fuels, being these oxides the most dangerous and harmful pollutants in our atmosphere. When NOx 
are combined with moisture they produce nitric acid, which is one of the principal constituents of the 
acid rain and photochemical smog in the planet.5 One way of avoiding the presence of NOx is to 
achieve its removal through the reduction to N2 and O2.  
Nitrogen oxides have been identified as toxic and irritant gases with significant risks for 
people with respiratory diseases. Exposure of NO2 at concentrations higher than 1.0 ppm induces 
anomalous changes in lung function. In repeated exposures at high concentrations of NO2 (1-5 ppm), 
an increase in respiratory rate and a reduced gas exchange capability in the lungs were evidenced.6  
Some recent works7-891011 proved that the use of metal nanoparticles greatly improves the 
catalytic activity compared to the extended surfaces. Moreover, several research groups have 
concluded that size plays a key role in the catalytic activity of nanoparticles.12-131415 In particular, while 
gold surfaces show very low reactivity, small Au nanoparticles (1-6 nm) are highly reactive 
materials.16171819-20  
Catalysts based on nanoparticles improve the chemical reactions through the reduction of the 
activation energy, increasing their efficiency. Gold nanoparticles can, for example, catalyze the 
oxidation of CO at room or lower temperatures, which are significantly lower than those needed when 
supported metal catalysts are used. Selective oxidation reactions of hydrocarbons also occur at low 
temperature on supported gold catalysts. 21,22 
 
The reactivity of metal nanoparticles is a fundamental issue of heterogeneous catalysis,23-2425 
however much remains to be studied. These systems have different physical and chemical properties 
with respect to the bulk and extended surfaces.26 The main cause of these differences is that 
nanoparticles have low coordination sites at the edges and corners. The number of this type of sites 
varies according to the size and shape of the nanoparticle. Theoretical studies of O2 dissociation on 
Au nanoparticles27,28 showed that, besides the influence of the low coordination sites, there is a critical 
size for which the reaction is favored. Thus for a given reaction in study, systematic studies with 
increasing size of nanoparticles are needed and then compared to the corresponding studies on 
metallic surfaces. 
NOx adsorption and its dissociation have been experimentally29-303132 and theoretically33-343536 
studied over extended surfaces. Brown et al.29 examined the structure of NO adsorbed on some metal 
surfaces and also they discussed the NO dissociation process. From theoretical results, the bonding 
of NO on the three-fold (fcc) site of the Cu(111) surface was reported.34 This interaction is essentially

ionic, with a small but noticeable π covalent contribution. On the other hand, Gajdoš et al.37 found 
that NO preferentially adsorbs on hcp-hollow sites of Cu and Ag surfaces, while weak adsorptions 
were observed on Au bridge sites. Similar observations were made by Dumas et al.38 using the 
Infrared Reflection-Absorption Spectroscopy (IRAS) technique. At low temperatures, the monomeric 
NO adsorbs on threefold hollow site of Cu(111) surface.  
The interaction of NO with Au(111) surface was theoretically studied using slab models with 
a different number of layers, to evaluate the effects of substrate thickness.39 The authors suggested 
that the formation of NO2 from NO on regular sites of Au(111) would be limited by the lifetime of 
NO species weakly bound to the surface. Electronic properties observed for the NO adsorption and 
its oxidation on a regular surface of Au(111) and on a thin film of Au are qualitatively the same.   
NO2 species was less investigated. It was observed that, at elevated temperatures (300-500 
K), NO2 is a very good oxygen source for the oxidation of thick films of Ag, Zn and Cu supported on 
Ru(001), with a dissociation probability close to one.31 An XPS/UPS study showed that the NO2 
adsorption on Ag(111) at 300 K is also dissociative, resulting in NO and O adsorbed products.40,41 
They observed a large excess of O(ads), due to the partial desorption of NO(ads). At low temperatures 
(90 K), the adsorption is dissociative again, obtaining the same products as at 300 K with a covering 
of 0.5 ML. However, NO desorption was not found. 
Although the adsorption and reduction of NOx on some metal surfaces have been studied in 
the past, recently the spectrum has been opened to the study of promising small particles. In order to 
gain a better understanding of the effect of low coordination sites present in metal nanoparticles, the 
catalytic reduction of NO2 to NO + O on octahedral nanoparticles of Cu, Ag, and Au and on their 
respective extended (111) surfaces, was studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.  
 
Computational Details 
Calculations were performed from the density functional theory (DFT) that solves the Kohn-
Sham equations for the valence electrons density.42-434445 The interaction between core states and 
valence electrons was treated through the Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method proposed by 
Bloch,46 and the valence electronic states were expanded in a basis of plane waves with a cutoff of 
415 eV for the kinetic energy. Moreover, the total energy threshold defining self-consistency of the 
electron density was set to 10-4 eV and a total force difference less than 10-2 eV for consecutive 
geometries was set for the structural optimization. The exchange-correlation effects were treated with 
the generalized gradient-corrected PW91.47,48 
The Methfessel-Paxton smearing of width σ = 0.05 eV was applied and the reported total 
energies were then extrapolated to σ0 eV. Numerical integration in reciprocal space was performed 
using a Monkhorst-Pack grid of 5×5×1 for the extended surface, while Γ point was used for the

nanoparticles. All of the calculations in the present work were developed at the spin-polarized level 
with the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.49-5051 Taking into account that dispersion 
effects on these systems were negligible, the calculations were done without the van der Waals 
correction.  
Extended Me(111) surfaces, where Me corresponds to Cu, Ag and Au metals, were 
represented with a periodic slab model of 5 layers and a 3 × 3 unit cell (molecular coverage =0.11 
ML). All the possible adsorption sites examined are displayed in Figure 1. Two uppermost layers 
were allowed to relax completely together with the adsorbates and the other three layers of metal 
atoms were maintained fixed. 
Five metal nanoparticles with different shapes and sizes, formed by 19, 38, 55, 79, and 116 
atoms, which exhibit low coordination sites, were selected in order to analyze the size effects on the 
surface reactivity. The nanoparticles were named as Men, where Me was Cu, Ag, and Au, with n= 19, 
38, 55, 79, and 116 atoms. All the sites studied for the adsorption are displayed in Figure 1. The 
geometry optimization was done considering the total relaxation of NO2 (or NO + O) and all the 
nanoparticle atoms, excepting the central ones. In almost all the cases, this procedure did not lead to 
noticeable changes; only the Au79 and Au116 nanoparticles exhibited an appreciable rearrangement of 
the atoms, converging to a rounded shape. 
Climbing-image Nudged Elastic Band method (CI-NEB)52,53 combined with dimer54 method 
were used to obtain the transition states (TS) for the NO2 reduction reaction. The minimum energy 
configurations and TS were confirmed by performing the frequency calculations. The initial and final 
states (IS and FS) were verified with all real values of vibrational frequencies. On the other hand, the 
TS was confirmed by obtaining a single imaginary frequency corresponding to the reaction path.  
Adsorption energies of NO2 were calculated for every possible site present on the Cu, Ag, and 
Au nanoparticles and (111) surfaces, applying the following equation: Eads= E(NO2/substrate) – 
E(NO2) – E(substrate), where E(NO2/substrate) is the total energy of NO2 adsorbed on a metal 
substrate, E(NO2) is the total energy of the free molecule, E(substrate) is the total energy of the (111) 
surface slabs or Men nanoparticles. Then, starting from the more favorable adsorption sites, the 
dissociation energies (Ediss) and the respective activation barriers (Eact) were calculated. The first 
reduction energies were calculated as Ediss= E(NO+O/substrate) – E(NO2/substrate), where 
E(NO+O/substrate) is the optimized total energy of NO and O co-adsorbed on the substrate and 
E(NO2/substrate) is the total energy of the NO2 adsorbed on the same substrate. Finally, the activation 
energies were expressed as Eact= ETS – EIS, where EIS and ETS are the total energies of the initial (NO2 
adsorbed on a metal substrate) and transition states, respectively.

Results 
NO2 adsorption 
Being in mind our work related to the NO2 adsorption on the extended Me(111) surfaces and 
on Me19 nanoparticles (with Me= Cu, Ag and Au),55 in this work we carried out the study of all 
potential adsorption sites on metal nanoparticles formed by 38 atoms. On Me38, the Eads obtained for 
the most favorable sites are displayed in Table 1. The O-down configuration is also the most stable 
one on the three metals studied (see Fig. 2a), being about of 0.3 eV greater than the N-down 
configuration. The most stable adsorption site is the same on all Me38 (O-down T1-T1edge). When 
NO2 is adsorbed on nanoparticles with N-down configuration, the interaction is through two metallic 
atoms of the edge (bridge sites, not shown). The stabilities of the adsorbed NO2 always follow the 
order Cu> Ag> Au. Although the obtained sequence is the same as on the Me(111) surfaces and Me19, 
the Eads are higher on Me38 than on the corresponding extended surfaces and even higher than on 
Au19.55 
Considering the NO2 selectivity for specific interaction on Me19 and Me38, the O-down 
configuration, only this geometry was analyzed for the bigger nanoparticles with 55, 79, and 116 
atoms. The optimized geometries of the NO2 adsorbed on these nanoparticles are displayed in Figures 
2 b, c, and d, respectively, and their adsorption energies are shown in Table 2.  
NO2 adsorption on nanoparticles is much stronger than on the (111) surfaces (more than 0.6 
eV).55 In addition, it was found that the adsorption strength increases from Me19 to Me38, then 
decreases for Me55 and remains almost constant for larger nanoparticles, being Me38 the most reactive 
nanoparticle. For all nanoparticles, similar stretches of the ON bonds were obtained with respect to 
the Me(111) surfaces. The average values of both OMe distances between the O atoms of NO2 
molecule and the nearest metal atom of nanoparticles show no significant differences with the 
increasing size of nanoparticles, but they are shorter than those observed on Me(111) surfaces for the 
same adsorption geometry. This behavior evidences a stronger interaction of NO2 with nanoparticles 
mentioned above. For Cu nanoparticles, the average distance of OCu is 1.97 Å, which is 0.1 Å 
longer than the corresponding distance in the copper oxide.56 In cases of Ag and Au nanoparticles, 
the average distances are even longer than the metal oxides. These results indicate that the NO2 
interaction is stronger with Cu nanoparticles than with Ag or Au ones. 
We analyze the charge transfers in Me38 because they are the most reactive nanoparticles for 
the NO2 adsorption. Bader charge analysis57 (Table 3) indicates the oxidation of the two Cu atoms 
which interact with the oxygen atoms. These changes in the atomic charge go from almost zero 
(metallic character) for the clean nanoparticle to +0.18e when the NO2 is adsorbed. Similar behavior 
is observed for nanoparticle atoms of Ag and Au, with an average final charge of +0.14e and +0.11e,

respectively. NO2 takes  -0.6e, -0.5e and -0.4e from the two interacting metal atoms in Cu, Ag and 
Au nanoparticles, respectively. Both the nitrogen and the oxygen atoms are taking electronic charge 
from the metal in the following order: Cu> Ag> Au. This behavior agrees with the stability order of 
NO2 adsorption on the three metals and with the NO bonds stretching; the greater the electronic 
transfer of the metal to the adsorbate, the greater the stability when it is adsorbed. 
Comparing the Bader charges of NO2 adsorbed on Me38 nanoparticles and with those on 
Me(111) surfaces (not shown), it is possible to note that the NO2 receives similar electronic charges 
from Cu and Ag substrates, while it takes more from Au38 with respect to Au(111). Besides, the 
interacting metal atoms on nanoparticles release more charge to NO2 than on the respective surfaces, 
pointing out the more localized interaction. This behavior could be the reason for the better stability 
of NO2 adsorbed on nanoparticles instead of on surfaces. The low coordination sites present in metal 
nanoparticles clearly improve the NO2 adsorption.      
 
NO2 dissociation 
In order to obtain the NO2 dissociation energies, all structure configurations considering every 
possible co-adsorption sites of NO+O species were studied. These calculations were carried out on 
nanoparticles formed by 38 and 55 atoms, and the results are depicted in Figures 3a and 3b. On 
Me(111) and Me19 substrates, the NO2 dissociation was previously studied,55 while on Me38 and Me55 
the results are depicted in Figures 3a and 3b. Then, the co-adsorption study on Me79 and Me116 was 
restricted to the lowest energy configurations on the most favorable sites, previously found on smaller 
nanoparticles (Figures 3c and 3d). It is important to mention that the dissociation energies were 
calculated considering only the O-down configuration (most stable one) of NO2 adsorbed on each 
substrate.  
On nanoparticles, NO species are adsorbed preferentially on bridge sites, whereas O atom on 
three-fold (H1 or H2) or four-fold coordinated hollow (H3) sites (see Figure 3). After the NO + O 
co-adsorption, all nanoparticles evidenced some degree of deformation, mainly the smallest Au 
nanoparticles. The same behavior was reported by Roldán et al.58 in his DFT study of O2 dissociation 
on Au nanoparticles. The dissociation order of NO2 is somewhat different with respect to the obtained 
for its adsorption, being in these cases Cu > Au > Ag, excepting for Me116 where the order is inverted 
on the heavier metals (Ag > Au). For sizes greater than Me38 the effectiveness of the nanoparticles 
for the NO2 dissociation begins to be greater than on (111) surfaces. 
For this reaction, the relationship between the dissociation energy and the size of nanoparticles 
has the same trend for Cu and Ag; a decrease of Ediss was found when increasing the particle size, 
except for Me79. In the case of Au nanoparticles, the most reactive one turned out to have 38 atoms, 
while the remaining nanoparticles presented similar behaviors. From an energetic point of view, Cu55

and Cu116 nanoparticles show the highest reactivities with the biggest exothermic reaction energies 
(see Table 4).  
The charge analysis was performed for the co-adsorption of the NO and O species on the 
nanoparticles Me38 and Me116, being the most favorable ones for Au in the first size and for Cu and 
Ag in the second size (see Tables 5 and 6). On both series of nanoparticles, NO takes more electron 
charge from Cu> Ag> Au as it was also observed for NO2. Comparing a metal in the two nanoparticle 
sizes, we observed that NO gains slightly higher electronic charge when is adsorbed on Me116 than 
on Me38 and the magnitude of the increments are similar in the three metals.  
In all cases, NO receives electronic charge from the substrates, but it is not equally distributed 
between the N and O atoms with respect to the free NO. The NO interaction is the strongest on Cu116 
(N gains ~ 0.6e and O loses ~ 0.1e), is intermediate on Ag116 (N gains ~ 0.5e and the O atom maintains 
its charge), and N takes ~ 0.4e and O practically does not change (0.07e) when the dissociation occurs 
on Au116. The polarization of the NO bond follows the order: Cu < Ag < Au (see Table 6). Thus, there 
is a concordance between the electronic transfer from the metal to the adsorbate and the better 
reactivity for the NO2 dissociation on Cu116 and Ag116 nanoparticles. On Au38, the charge released to 
NO is the smallest, N gains ~0.3e and O releases 0.06e, for this reason is the most stable situation for 
this noble metal (with low oxidation capacity). For both sizes, the charge gained by NO and O species 
is largely provided by the closest metal atoms, indicating localized interactions. The dissociated O 
atom on Cu and Ag nanoparticles is taking a charge close to one electron, accounting for a strong 
ionic character. 
Prior to co-adsorption, not all atoms are neutral in nanoparticles, but they are neutral on 
average. Afterward, the Me atoms that interact with adsorbates release electronic charge and the 
nanoparticle is oxidized. Larger nanoparticles have a greater capacity to oxidize, for this reason the 
bigger size is more favorable to the NO2 dissociation on Cu116 and to a lesser extent on Ag116, while 
the smaller size of both analyzed is better for NO2 dissociation on the noblest metal (Au38). 
 
Activation barriers 
Considering the lowest energy configurations of adsorbed NO2 and co-adsorbed NO + O on 
each substrate, calculations of activation barriers on Me(111) surfaces and on Me19 and Me38 
nanoparticles were performed. In only two cases, Cu(111) and Ag(111) surfaces, the final geometries 
of the co-adsorbed NO and O were not the most stable configurations. In these cases, the NO + O are 
on top and hollow fcc sites, respectively, due to the shorter NO distances. We assume that the lowest 
energy pathways for NO2 dissociation will occur first to the nearest adsorption sites and then NO 
migrates to the final and more stable site. Dissociation (Ediss) and activation energies (Eact) are 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
summarized in Table 7. The NO2 dissociation energy profiles for Me(111) and Me38 nanoparticles 
and their corresponding geometries are shown in Figures 4-6. 
The dissociation of NO2 on the Cu(111) surface is more favorable than its desorption (see Fig. 
4a), since the desorption energy (1.51 eV) is more than twice greater than the activation energy (0.61 
eV). However, the inverse reaction is also possible energetically, that is the formation of NO2 from 
the NO and O fragments, due the barrier is very low (0.30 eV). Here it is important to emphasize that 
the NO desorption implies an energy of 0.68 eV, which is more than twice the energy required for 
the reverse reaction. In this way, it would be expected that during the reaction, a small part of NO 
will desorb and most of it will oxidize and form NO2. 
Although the activation barriers are larger on the Cu19 and Cu38 nanoparticles than on the 
extended surface (see Table 7 and Fig. 4b), NO2 dissociation is more favorable than its desorption. 
The energies required for NO2 desorption on Cu19 and Cu38 are very high, of 2.4 eV, while the 
activation barriers are of 1.5 eV. Besides, on the Cu19, the reverse activation energy (NO2 formation), 
and the NO desorption energy are similar (1.29 eV and -1.23 eV, respectively). Although both values 
are high, these situations may compete during the reaction. In contrast, desorption of NO from Cu38 
is more favorable than the formation of NO2 (1.25 eV and 1.44 eV, respectively), but in both cases 
high energies are required. 
From the previous analysis, it can be seen that while the adsorption and dissociation energies 
of NO2 on the Cu nanoparticles are energetically more favorable than on the Cu(111) surface, this 
improvement does not translate into activation energies. On the Cu(111) surface, the activation barrier 
is much lower than on nanoparticles, probably due to the smaller geometric change that undergoes in 
the TS, towards the FS. In nanoparticles the geometries of TS resemble the FS, a fragment of the NO2 
molecule (NO) must migrate towards the final site, which is usually on another side of the 
nanoparticle. In almost all the cases studied, the NO always migrates long distances to its final 
adsorption position, while the dissociated O atom quickly searches for the nearest hollow site. 
In case of silver substrate, NO2 desorption on the Ag(111) surface and on the Ag19 
nanoparticle is clearly more favorable than its dissociation (see Table 7 and Fig. 5a). In contrast, a 
competition between the dissociation and desorption of NO2 on Ag38 nanoparticle is observed, finding 
a small difference between these two energies. In case that NO2 dissociates on Ag38, the reverse 
reaction it is also very likely to occur, i.e., the formation of NO2 will occur from the NO and O 
fragments, because the inverse barrier is only 0.50 eV (see Fig 5b)   
For the three analyzed substrates of Au (the (111) surface, Au19, and Au38) the activation 
energies are also very high (see Table 7 and Fig. 6). There is a clear preference for NO2 desorption 
versus its dissociation, however, it is observed that the difference between the activation energy and 
desorption energy decreases as the size of the nanoparticle increases (1.08 and 0.38 eV, for Au19 and 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Au38, respectively). Besides, the reverse of activation energies also increases with the increasing of 
the nanoparticles size. Despite that the dissociation energies improve with the nanoparticles, the 
activation barriers are too big. In all the cases, the geometries of the TS resemble the final geometries.  
 
BEP relationships 
 
In order to find all the activation energy values for the most favorable reactions studied in this 
work, the Brönsted Evans Polanyi (BEP) method was used. The BEP relation59,60 is an empirical rule 
stating that there is a linear relationship between the activation energy and the reaction energy for an 
elementary reaction. It is applied in many areas of chemistry and biochemistry, including 
heterogeneous catalysis, where it is often used to rationalize the observed variations in catalytic 
activity from one catalyst to the next or to estimate activation barriers.61 
 
The aim of this part is to find a linear relationship between the activation and reaction energies, 
from the activation values previously found with the NEB and dimer methods. In the traditional 
linear-BEP, this relation is defined as Eact Ereac  . In this way, a relationship has been sought 
between the reaction and activation energies obtained on Me(111) surfaces and on Me19 and Me38 
nanoparticles to be extended to the biggest nanoparticles Me55, Me79, and Me116. In this work, we 
define the reaction energy (Ereac) as dissociation energy (Ediss).  
For all the reaction paths of the NO2 dissociation on all substrates studied, Figure 7a shows 
the values of activation energies as a function of the reaction energies. The great dispersion of the 
data around the adjustment line is evident, from which it can be inferred that there is a poor linear 
relationship when all the reactions studied are considered together. Therefore, we proceeded to 
separate the reactions in such a way that they have a geometrically similar FS. Figures 7b and 7c 
show the linear relationships with the traditional BEP for those reactions with the same FS 
configuration: NO bridge + O hollow and NO top + O hollow configurations, respectively. The 
relationship with the first geometry as FS did not give good results since the dispersion was very 
large. In contrast, a better linear relation with low dispersion was observed for the dissociation 
reactions of NO2 with FS geometry NO top + O hollow. However, this traditional BEP relationship 
is not useful for the sizes of nanoparticles analyzed, because most of the stable sites have a final 
geometry where the NO is adsorbed on a bridge site, instead of on top site. 
Searching for some linear relationship that allows predicting the activation energies, certain 
authors have found linear relationships based on different descriptors of the reaction energy. For 
example, Lee et al.62 in a DFT study on Rh-Ni binary metallic surfaces, considered descriptors based 
on the relative energy of the initial or final states for dissociation reactions of C-H, O-H, C-C, C-O 
and, C-OH bonds. Fajín et al.63 found linear relationships for the dissociation reaction of methanol on 
different metal surfaces based on descriptors such as the co-adsorption energy of the CH3O and H

species. Other authors, such as Wang et al.64 studying transition metal surfaces, found the linear 
relationships with descriptors based on the dissociation energies of the CH4, H2O, NH3, and H2 
molecules.  Performing a wide revision of the BEP correlations, Panov et.al. found that the energy of 
the individual bonds which are cleaved or formed during the reaction can be used as descriptors for 
plotting BEP correlations.65 More recently, Reimers et al.66 studied the sequential hydrogenation 
reactions of the CO molecule for methanol synthesis on surfaces of Zn, Ce and Ga oxides by DFT 
calculations. They found that traditional BEP relationships (Eact vs. Ereac) do not allow a good 
correlation to predict activation energy barriers, in contrast, BEP relationships referred to the initial 
and/or final states allowed to find them satisfactorily. 
If these descriptors are used, the linear relationship with respect to the initial state (IS) is, that 
is with respect to the energies of NO2 in gas phase (ENO2) and the bare substrate surface (EMe):

With respect to the final state (FS), that is, with respect to the energies of NO in gas phase

EIS, ETS, and EFS are the energies of the initial, transition and final states, respectively. The 
∆EIS is the adsorption energies of NO2 (Eads). Figure S1 shows the corresponding graphs for these 
descriptors: the first one referring to the initial configuration (eq. 1), and the second one referring to 
the final configuration (eq. 4). There is also great data dispersion with respect to the adjustment line, 
although an improvement with respect to the traditional BEP is achieved especially for the final 
descriptor (Fig. S1b). In these figures, all cases are considered independently of the final geometry 
of the dissociated NO and O species. 
In search of better linear relationships, we selected the cases with the same geometric 
configuration of the final state, as explained above. The graphs of non-traditional BEP relationships 
for the final states NO bridge + O hollow and for NO top + O hollow are shown in Figure 8 and 
Figure S2, respectively. The Initial descriptor achieves a significant improvement in the finding of a 
linear relationship between ΔEIS and ΔETS when the NO2 dissociation reactions have the NO bridge 
+ O hollow geometries as FS (see Figure 8a), fulfilling the desired requirements that could not be 
previously achieved through the traditional BEP. When the reactions have the NO top + O hollow

geometries as FS, the Final descriptor achieves the best linear correspondence between ΔEFS and 
ΔETS (see Figure S2b). As seen above, these reactions also keep a linear correlation with the 
traditional BEP, but this relationship is not useful for the most stable configurations of the final 
geometry with the NO on bridge site, which is the preferred site on nanoparticles (see Table 4). For 
this reason, we use the linear correction obtained considering the Initial descriptor with the FS 
geometry NO bridge + O hollow.  
Next, we proceeded to obtain the Eact for the nanoparticles of the larger sizes (55, 79 and 116 
atoms) using the relationship corresponding to the equation obtained from Fig. 8a: 
∆𝐸TS = 1.67 ∆𝐸𝐼+ 3.09 𝑒𝑉  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(7) 
 
By entering the known value of the abscissas, ΔEIS, and by using equation (7), the ∆ETS values 
were calculated. Finally, the corresponding Eact were obtained by the difference with the ΔEIS. These 
values are reported in Table 7, in which all the values of the calculated Eact and Ediss were also 
collected. The activation energy for the reaction on Au55 could not be obtained since the final state 
presents a geometry with both adsorbates (NO and O) on bridge sites, and this configuration is not 
described by any of the relationships found. 
In agreement with the postulation of Norskov et.al,67 we have found that in case of the TS 
configuration is similar to the FS one, there is a linear relationship from the final descriptor and also 
from the traditional BEP. This has been observed when the reaction occurs on the three extended 
surfaces (see Figs. 4a, 5a, and 6a) and on Ag19 (not shown) with NO top and O hollow as FS. 
Conversely, if the TS is very different from the FS configuration, as in the cases with NO bridge and 
O hollow, the final descriptor and the traditional BEP are not valid descriptors for obtaining the 
activation barriers. The TS geometries on Me38 nanoparticles are very different from the FS 
configurations, with NO on bridge and O on hollow sites; in these cases, the alternative BEP which 
relates the energy of the IS with the energy of the TS, has demonstrated a significant improvement in 
the finding of a linear relationship with respect to the traditional BEP. 
It is possible to infer from equations (1) and (4) that an important energy difference between 
ETS and EIS or between ETS and EFS, respectively, would result to a high Beta value and also a high 
Alpha value. On the other hand, the most outstanding feature of nanoparticles is to possess multiple 
edges and kinks that separate different surfaces; this causes the configuration of the FS of the 
dissociation reaction usually involves the co-adsorption of the fragments in different faces, thus 
moving away from the TS geometry. Something similar can happen between the IS and TS 
configurations. These could be the reasons which lead to an Alpha value greater than 1 in eq. (7). We 
have observed this same phenomenon in a previous study of the NH3 dissociation on nanoparticles of 
Fe.68 In particular, other published works have also obtained alpha values greater than one.69,70

Despite the activation energies on copper nanoparticles do not decrease substantially with the 
increasing size, the condition for the favorable NO2 dissociation would be improved due to the reverse 
activation energy increase (Eact= Eact – Ediss, see Table 7). This means that the products would hardly 
form NO2 again (as it was also predicted for Cu(111) surface). The Cu116 nanoparticle seems to have 
the best energy requirements to NO2 desorption. In the case of Ag nanoparticles, NO2 always prefers 
to desorb than dissociate, except in Ag38 where desorption and dissociation may compete during the 
reaction. Gold nanoparticles are not good for NO2 dissociation, being Au38 also the most reactive one. 
Examining all the activation barriers obtained by interpolation, it can be noticed that the 
activation energies are lower for the Me38 size (except for Cu38); then an increase and afterward a 
decrement again is observed with the increasing size of the nanoparticle (since the NO2 adsorption 
energy decreases again). From all sizes of nanoparticles studied, Ag38 and Au38 seem to be a critical 
size for which the reaction is slightly favored. It is also appreciated that the dissociation energies in 
almost all the nanoparticles studied is lower than those corresponding to the extended surfaces, but 
the activation barriers are higher.  
 
Conclusions 
The reduction of NO2 to NO + O on different sizes of Cu, Ag, and Au nanoparticles and on 
their respective extended (111) surfaces was studied by means of the density functional theory (DFT) 
calculations. The metal nanoparticles constructed by 19, 38, 55, 79, and 116 atoms, were selected in 
order to analyze the size effects on the surface reactivity. 
O-down configuration for the NO2 adsorption was the most stable one on the three metals 
studied. All the metal nanoparticles showed to be more reactive for the NO2 adsorption than the 
extended surfaces, being Me38 the nanoparticle most reactive. The adsorption energy order found for 
both configurations (O-down and N-down) was Cu > Ag > Au. 
NO species are adsorbed on nanoparticles preferentially on bridge sites, whereas O atom on 
three or four-fold coordinated hollow sites. 
 
From the Brönsted Evans Polanyi (BEP) relationship, we obtained the activation energy 
values for the NO2 reduction on the biggest nanoparticles, using the energy barriers of the directly 
calculated smaller ones, and then, interpolated for the larger nanoparticles. This relationship is highly 
dependent on the configuration of the reaction products and also on the structure of the active site. 
When the TS configuration is similar to the FS one, we found a linear relationship from the final 
descriptor and also from the traditional BEP. This was the case for the reactions with NO top + O 
hollow as final states. However, when the configuration of the TS is significantly different from the 
FS, the TS becomes independent of the FS; in these cases, the final descriptor and the traditional BEP 
are not valid relationships for obtaining the activation barrier. Notwithstanding the TS structure is far

away from both the FS and IS structures, the Initial descriptor achieves a significant improvement 
finding a linear relationship between IS energies and TS energies for the NO2 dissociation reactions 
with NO bridge + O hollow as FS. Although there has not found a general predictive approach to the 
BEP relationships, we found in this work a very helpful prediction of the activation energies using 
alternative BEP descriptors and taking into account the FS configuration. While we cannot extend 
these results to other reactions, we take it into account for this same reaction in other substrates. In 
addition, we propose the extension of this behavior to other families of reactions with the same FS, 
that is, they could present non-traditional BEP linear relations with a specific descriptor. 
By examining all the activation barriers obtained by interpolation, it can be noticed that the activation 
energy slowly decreases as the size of the nanoparticle increases. In almost all the nanoparticles 
studied, the dissociation energies are lower than those corresponding to the extended surfaces, but the 
activation barriers are higher.

Highlights:  
 
- NO2 is preferably adsorbed with O-down configuration on Cu, Ag and Au substrates 
- Increase in Cu and Ag particle sizes leads to a decrease in NO2 dissociation energy 
- Activation barriers of largest nanoparticles were obtained using a non-traditional BEP relationship 
- Low coordination sites in nanoparticles improve NO2 adsorption but not its dissociation
