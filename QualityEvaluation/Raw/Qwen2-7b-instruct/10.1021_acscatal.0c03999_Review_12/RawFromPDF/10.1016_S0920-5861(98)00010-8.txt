Abstract
Vanadium±magnesium oxide (VMgO) catalysts have been prepared, characterized and tested in the ODH of n-butane. The
catalysts were prepared by two variations of the wet-impregnation method using aqueous ammonium metavanadate or
organically-based methanolic vanadyl acetylacetonate solutions. The catalyst surface area depends on the vanadium content
and the preparation method. Catalyst characterization (i.e. XRD, 51V NMR, FTIR, LRS) results indicate the presence of poor
crystalline Mg-orthovanadate (Mg3V2O8), while the presence of other Mg-vanadates is not clear. Oxygen isotopic-exchange
experiments on VMgO catalysts indicate an R2 process: 18O2  216O2ÿ

temperatures higher than 1023 K, while an R0-type [18O2(g)16O2(g)!216O18O(g)] is observed at 823 K, as a consequence of a
small activity for homophase isotopic. Both the catalytic activity and the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products depend
on the vanadium content but is independent on the catalyst preparation method. This behavior is observed in the ODH of n-
butane with both O2 and N2O. However, while conversion of n-butane was higher when using O2 as oxidant, the selectivity to
C4-ole®ns was higher with N2O as oxidant. Pulse experiments show that prereduced surfaces are not effective in producing
ole®ns while selective catalysts are achieved with preoxidized surface. A mechanism for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-
butane is proposed. # 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction
Vanadium±Magnesium oxide (VMgO) catalysts
have been proposed as selective catalysts in the oxi-
dative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane [1±4] and
propane [5±10]. V±Mg±O mixed oxide catalysts have
generally been obtained by impregnation of MgO with
an ammonium metavanadate solution [1,2,5,11].
However, other preparation methods have been
employed, including impregnation of Mg(OH)2 with
an ammonium metavanadate solution [6], adsorption
of vanadyl compounds from non-aqueous solutions
[12,13]; co-precipitation of Mg-nitrate and NH4VO3
[14] or of Mg-oxalate and vanadyl oxalate [7,15];
citrate methods [9].
Characterizations of resulting materials have been
carried
out
by
several
techniques,
i.e.
XRD
[2,3,6,7,9,16], infrared [2,3,6,7,9,11,16], laser Raman
[7,9±11,16], diffuse re¯ectance UV-vis [11,15], 51V

[27]. The nature of Mg±vanadates revealed by those
techniques is found to depend on the V-concentration
and the preparative procedure adopted. Dependence
on preparative procedure and vanadium content has
likewise been reported for the catalytic properties of
V±Mg±O catalysts in the ODH of propane, and for the
dispersion of vanadium on MgO [7].
Not surprisingly, then, the nature of active and
selective sites for the ODH of alkanes is still under
discussion. Thus, isolated VO4 tetrahedra in both
amorphous and crystalline Mg3V2O8 [1±3,7], dimeric
V±O±V-like species on Mg2V2O7 [6], or synergetic
effects between crystalline phases [9], each have
been held mainly responsible for high selectivity in
ODH of propane and n-butane. Other factors, includ-
ing the presence of impurities [30,31], the acid±base
character of the catalysts [4], or the use of supported
vanadium magnesium mixed oxides [32] are also
reported to in¯uence the catalytic behavior of these
materials.
The aim of the work, reported in the present paper,
include further characterization of V±Mg±O catalysts,
clari®cation of the in¯uence of preparative methods
on their catalytic properties, and a study of the
extent to which activity and selectivity in ODH of
n-butane could be enhanced by utilizing N2O rather
than using molecular oxygen as oxidant. The extent of
agreement of the results obtained in both continuous-
¯ow and pulsed-reactant experiments, with possible
mechanisms for the ODH of n-butane [2,4,6], is
discussed.

Experimental
2.1.
Catalyst preparation
MgO was prepared by the calcination of magne-
sium oxalate at 923 K for 3 h. Magnesium oxalate was
obtained by precipitation, at pH 5±6, of a magnesium
acetate solution with an oxalic acid solution and it was
®ltered, washed and dried at 353 K for 16 h [7]. Two
series of catalysts featuring vanadium supported on
such MgO were prepared by two variations of the wet-
impregnation method: impregnation with an aqueous
ammonium metavanadate solution, according to the
previously reported procedure [1] (AC-series), or with
an organically-based methanolic vanadyl acetylaceto-
nate solution, using different methanol/vanadyl acet-
ylacetonate molar ratio (OR-series) [31]. The solids
were dried at 343 K and 27 KPa and then kept at 383 K
overnight. Finally, the samples were calcined in air at
873 K for 4 h. Identi®cation of the resulting MgO-
supported vanadium catalysts (referred as AC- or OR-
series) is afforded by a number that indicates the wt%
of vanadium expressed as V2O5 (Tables 1 and 2,
respectively).

Catalyst characterization
Chemical analysis of Vand Mg was done by atomic
absorption.
The BET surface area of the samples, SBET, was
obtained in an ASAP 2000 apparatus, from N2 adsorp-

tion isotherms at 77 K and taking a value of 0.164 nm2
for the cross-section of N2.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected in
a Philips 1060 diffractometer, equipped with graphite
monochromator, operating at 40 KV and 40 mA and
using nickel-®ltered CuK radiation (0.1542 nm).
Solid-state
51V NMR spectra were recorded at
ambient temperature on a Varian VXR-400S WB
spectrometer at 105.1 MHz, using a high speed
MAS Doty probe with zirconia rotors (5 mm in dia-
meter). The spectra were recorded with pulses of 1 ms
corresponding to a ¯ip angle of /13, in order to avoid
signal distortions of the I7/2 nuclei. To obtain the
MAS±NMR spectra, samples were spun at 7 KHz. The
51V chemical shifts are referenced against liquid
VOCl3, using a 0.16 M NaVO3 aqueous solution,
whose chemical shift is ÿ574.3 ppm, as a secondary
reference.
The infrared spectra were recorded at room tem-
perature on a NICOLET 710 FTIR spectrometer
equipped with Data Station. Dried samples
of
20 mg each were mixed with 100 mg of dry KBr
and pressed into a disk (600 kg cmÿ2).
Laser Raman spectra (LRS) were recorded with an
FT-Raman spectrometer (Bio-Rad, Model RAMAN-
II) incorporating an Nd : YAG laser (Spectra Physics,
Model FC-106C-10). About 400 scans were co-added
to produce each spectrum. The optimum power was
selected as a compromise between signal and sample
heating effect.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) results
were obtained in a Micromeritics apparatus. Samples
of 10 mg were ®rst treated in argon at room tempera-
ture during 1 h. The samples were subsequently con-
tacted with an H2/Ar mixture (H2/Ar molar ratio of
0.15 and a total ¯ow of 50 ml minÿ1) and heated, at a
rate of 10 K minÿ1, to a ®nal temperature of 1173 K.
Experiments to assess the in¯uence of vanadium
oxidation state on N2O decomposition were made
using a temperature-programmed reaction technique,
TPRx-N2O. This involved, ®rstly, establishing of a
steady ¯ow of N2O (diluted in He such that
PN2O  140 torr) over a preoxidized or prereduced
catalyst aliquot at room temperature allied to suitable
sampling arrangements for mass spectrometric mon-
itoring of exit gas composition. The temperature was
then ramped at 10 K minÿ1 and pro®les vs. tempera-
ture were obtained for exit gas composition, i.e. N2O,
O2 and N2.

These were carried out in a ®xed bed, stainless-steel
tubular reactor (i.d. 20 mm; length 520 mm). A coaxi-
ally centered thermocouple was used, which could be
moved up and down along the catalyst bed for tem-
perature pro®ling. The catalyst charge was 0.2±0.5 g
(particle size 0.30±0.50 mm) mixed with 8 g of Norton

silicon carbide (particle size 0.50±0.75 mm) to obtain
a constant volume in the catalyst bed. Different con-
tact times (W/F2±40 gcat h molÿ1
C4 ), were used in
order to obtain different n-butane conversion levels.
The feed consisted of n-butane, oxygen or N2O, and
helium in a molar ratio of 5 : 20 : 75 (C4 : O2 : He) or
5 : 40 : 55 (C4 : N2O : He), with a total ¯ow of 100 to
600 cm3 minÿ1. The catalytic tests were conducted at
atmospheric pressure in the 773 to 823 K temperature
interval. Analysis of reactants and products were
carried out by gas chromatography using two col-
umns: (i) Carvosieve-So (8 m1/8") and (ii) 23%SP-
1700 Chromosorb PAW (30 m1/8").
Speci®c activities (in molC4 hÿ1 mÿ2) and turnover
(in molC4 hÿ1/mol-V) were calculated, from data
achieved at 773 K and conversions of n-butane
(Xt) lower than 10%, considering the following
equations:

Xt  50:9
Wv=F  100
(2)
where Wv is the amount of vanadium of catalyst (in g)
tested.
Blank runs showed that under the experimental
conditions used in this work the homogeneous reac-
tion can be neglected. In all cases, the lowest total ¯ow
used was 100 ml minÿ1.
2.3.2.
Pulsed reactant experiments in microreactors
Comparisons between initial activities of the cata-
lysts for n-butane conversion in unsteady-state con-
dition were made by passing individual micropulses of
n-butane, (typically 0.45 mmol), alone or admixed
with O2 (70 torr) or N2O (140 torr), in an argon carrier
gas over small catalyst samples (10±40 mg) at W/
F14 to 56 gcat h molÿ1
C4 and Trx from 773 to 823 K.
On-line GC analysis of each exit pulse was achieved
on a 30 m1/8" 23% SP-l700 chromosorb PAW col-
umn. Tests with the empty reactor indicated insignif-
icant homogeneous gas phase conversions of n-butane
in these conditions.
2.3.3.
Oxygen isotope exchange at catalyst surfaces
An entropically non-equilibrated (l.n.eq.) mixture,
having ca. 50% of each 18O2 and 16O2, was used as a
gas phase probe, whose isotopic composition can
serve as a versatile and sensitive indicator for the
occurrence of R0-, R1-, or R2-type oxygen isotope
exchange processes on oxide surfaces [34]. Tests
for such processes over aliquots of V/MgO samples
were made in an all-glass recirculatory reactor system
equipped with MS to monitor isotopic composition of
the recirculating oxygen gas at 30 s intervals. The
normal in-situ pretreatment sequence given to cata-
lysts prior to introduction of the (16O218O2) mixture
comprised: (i) heating to 823 K while 16O2 was recir-
culated over the sample and through a trap at 77 K to
eliminate H2O; (ii) cooling to room temperature (RT)
in the 16O2; and (iii) evacuation at RT to remove it.
Following introduction of the (18O216O2) mixture at
ca. 5 mbar, onset temperatures for oxygen isotope
exchange processes over such preoxidized samples
were ®rst identi®ed from pro®les of temperature-
programmed oxygen isotope exchange (TPOIX) car-
ried out at 30 s intervals, while temperature was
ramped at 10 K minÿ1. Such TPOIX pro®les indicated
that the onset of heterophase oxygen isotope exchange
processes did not become apparent in such experi-
ments until temperatures much higher than 773±823 K
range (of direct relevance to ODH activity of the
materials) were attained. In an effort to evaluate even
very slow oxygen isotope exchange over the preox-
idized samples at 773 or 823 K as catalytically inter-
esting temperatures, other experiments were carried
out with the same recirculatory reactor system and
fresh aliquots of (18O216O2), but isothermally and
with long-term monitoring of the isotopic composition
of the recirculating gas.

Results and discussion
3.1.
Catalyst characterizations
Data in Tables 1 and 2 show that the overall BET
surface decreased with increasing vanadium content in
both the AC-series and OR-series.
Powder XRD patterns of the V-containing samples
con®rmed the coexistence of crystalline MgO, with
peaks at 242.97 and 62.48 (JCPDS 4-829), together
with poorly crystalline Mg-orthovanadate, Mg3V2O8
phase, with peaks about 235.0 (JCPDS 19-779).
For samples in the OR series, crystallinities of

the latter appeared to increase to a greater extent
with vanadium content, than for samples in the
AC-series.
Fig. 1(a) and (b) clearly show the 51V wideline
spectra of catalysts with only one band centered at
ÿ555 ppm. This band appears broader in catalysts
with low vanadium loading and prepared by aqueous
method (13-AC and 19-AC samples). The fact that
other bands in the 250±450 ppm interval are not
observed in the wideline spectra indicates that only
tetrahedral V5 species are present at signi®cant
concentrations on the as-stored catalysts [4,6,17±19].
In addition, the MAS±NMR spectra of samples 19-
AC and 18-OR are shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d), respec-
tively. In the ®rst case (Fig. 1(c)), two bands at ÿ554
and ÿ570 ppm are observed while in the spectrum of
sample 18-OR (Fig. 1(d)) only a band at ÿ570 ppm
can be seen. According to previous results [4], the
band at ÿ554 ppm originates from vanadium in a
crystalline
Mg3V2O8
phase
while
the
band
at
ÿ570 ppm could be related to distorted VO4 tetrahe-
dron units which are highly dispersed on the MgO
surface.
In the infrared spectra of all the catalysts studied
here, the most intense band appeared at 426 and
860 cmÿ1. The ®rst band is related to the presence
of MgO. However, the appearance of the bands of low
intensity at 965, 917, 849, 687, 550 cm-1, in addition to
band at 860 cmÿ1, on catalysts with high vanadium
loading indicates the presence of Mg3V2O8, in agree-
ment with previous results [2,3,6,7,9,11,16]. Despite
the detection of a weak feature at 965 cmÿ1, sugges-
tive of the presence of other Mg-vanadates, the recent
literature raises another possibility. Thus, the presence
of a band at 965 cmÿ1 in the IR spectra, formerly
attributed to Mg2V2O7 [3,6,11], has recently been
proposed to originate from highly dispersed and prob-
ably of low crystallinity Mg3V2O8 on the MgO surface
[9].
Laser Raman (LR) spectra of MgO-supported vana-
dium oxide catalysts (AC-series) are shown in Fig. 2.
Only a broad band centered at 880 cmÿ1 is observed
on the 13-AC sample, which decreases with increasing
vanadium loading. Conversely, two bands at 860 and
830 cmÿ1 increase with the vanadium loading of
catalysts, and can be attributed to the increased pre-
sence of crystalline Mg3V2O8 [7,9±11,16]. A general-
ization proposed in relation to LR spectra is that the
higher the symmetry of tetrahedral vanadium species
the lower the wave number at which its LR bands
appear [33]. On that basis, the broad band centered at
880 cmÿ1, here observed on samples prepared in an
aqueous medium and having low vanadium content,
could be due to the presence of non-crystalline dis-
torted V5 species with a tetrahedral coordination and/
or to the presence of polymeric (VO3) or dimeric V±
O±V species. However, 51V-NMR spectra con®rm that
associated V-species were not formed at any of the
vanadium loadings studied here. Thus it can be pro-
posed that species responsible for the LR feature at
Fig. 1. 51V wideline (a, b) and MAS±NMR (c, d) spectra of MgO-supported vanadium oxide catalysts: 19-AC (a, c); 18-OR (b, d).

880 cmÿ1 correspond to distorted VO4 tetrahedra
which is highly dispersed on the surface of MgO at
low loadings.
TPR pro®le showed two peaks at ca. 633 and 833 K
on catalysts with low vanadium loading prepared by
either method. On the other hand, V5 species of low
reducibility as indicated by a single TPR peak (at
833 K) were mainly observed in OR-series catalysts
with vanadium loading higher than 10 wt%. However,
a single peak at 923 K was observed on sample 39-AC.
Similar results were observed previously on mixed
VMgO catalysts [3] and two types of vanadium spe-
cies, in which the most readily reducible ones are
mainly formed on catalysts with low vanadium con-
tent, were proposed. Such differences in detail,
between the TPR pro®les of AC-series and OR-series
samples, reinforce the indications provided by LR and
IR that changes in wet-impregnation preparative pro-
cedures can signi®cantly alter the relative amounts of
dispersed vanadia subsets, differing in degree of dis-
tortion and in redox properties.

Results of oxygen isotope exchange and N2O
dissociation by mass spectrometry
Fig. 3 presents the results of experiments carried
out with ca. 5 mbar of (18O216O2) in contact with
Vanadia/MgO catalyst samples in a recirculatory reac-
tor system. This features a liquid-N2 cooled trap as
part of the recirculatory loop in order to ensure
negligible residual pressures of H2O or CO2 which
otherwise could promote isotopic exchange with 18O2
[35]. The objective of the experiments was to discover
whether the vanadia/MgO materials would evidence
activity for heterophase oxygen isotope exchange
processes as per Eq. (3) and Eq. (4).

MS monitoring of the isotopic composition of the
recirculating gas phase, while temperature of the
V/MgO sample was ramped upward at 10 K minÿ1,
yielded the TPOIX results shown in Fig. 3(a) when a
preoxidized vanadia/MgO sample was used, and those
in Fig. 3(b) over a prereduced sample. Fig. 3(a) makes
clear that onset of heterophase oxygen isotope
exchange did not occur until temperatures higher than
1023 K, i.e. ca. 473 K above those at which such
catalysts could be of interest to promote ODH of
butanes.
Fig. 3(a) illustrates that the predominant net effects
of oxygen isotope exchange, observed in the preox-
idized sample, would remove 18O2(g) from the gas
phase and its replacement by 16O2(g) will be supplied
in some way by 16Onÿ species of the metal oxide. Then
term `place exchange' has sometimes been employed
to categorise processes with these net effects [36]
especially in the absence of signi®cant production
of 16O18O(g). The latter is seen to be the case in
Fig. 3(a), which demonstrates that R1-type isotopic
exchange via Eq. (3) remained insigni®cant up to high
temperatures in the TPOIX run. Conversely, the
observed predominance of place exchange could be

accounted for Eqs. (4a) and (4b), involving diatomic

and

(16Oÿ±16Oÿ)(s) on the surface of V/MgO at high
temperatures.
The results obtained from a similar TPOIX experi-
ment over a prereduced aliquot of the same material
(cf. Fig. 3(b)) show an expected additional feature,
namely the uptake of 18O2 and 16O2 from the 5 mbar
dioxygen gas phase, due to reoxidation of the pre-
reduced vanadia/MgO catalyst by the dioxygen spe-
cies, with onset temperature of ca. 625 K. It is clear
not only from the parallel slow declines of m/e36
and 32 at ramp temperatures 625 to 750 K, but also
from the invariant value for the atom fraction of 18O in
the gas phase (line a.f in the plot), that reoxidation was
not accompanied by signi®cant R1- or R2-type hetero-
phase oxygen isotope exchange processes at those
temperatures. Again it is only at temperatures higher
than 1023 K that there is evidence for onset of place-

ever, the slow parallel decline, seen for m/e36 and
32, with a converse rise in m/e34, show that the
sample did exhibit, at 823 K, some small activity for
homophase isotopic equilibration of the gas phase in
accordance with Eq. (5), which occurs without the
lattice oxygen-16 species, leaving the surface and
entering the gas phase:
R0-type :18 O2g 16 O2g ! 216O18O
(5)
A promoting effect of dispersed VO4 tetrahedra by
loss of one oxygen, on such events would be in line
with previous proposals that activity for such R0-type
isotopic equilibration requires composite metal oxide
sites featuring both a coordinatively unsaturated
cation of variable valency and an anion vacancy
capable of localising an electron at a shallow trapping
level [37].
The successful use of nitrous oxide as an alternative
gaseous oxidant to dioxygen in promoting ODH of
butane over vanadia/MgO (vide infra) is of interest in
determining the temperature pro®le for N2O decom-
position (TPRx) over the catalyst when preoxidized or
prereduced. Determination of such pro®les by an
experimental procedure, allowing only brief contact
between N2O and the catalyst, was appropriate, since
such brief contacts would later feature in pulsed-
reactant catalytic experiments involving passage of
(n-butaneN2O) pulses over the same materials. Rele-
vant (TPRx) pro®les for dissociation of N2O (140 torr
in helium) over 18.4% V2O5/MgO were obtained by
on-line MS analysis of the exit gases from continuous
¯ow at W/F14.8 g h molÿ1
N2O under temperature ramp
of 10 K minÿ1. The pro®les obtained over the preox-
idized 18-OR sample made it clear that only relatively
small extents of N2O dissociation ranging from 15 to
30% at Trx 773±823 K resulted and that reasonable
mass balance existed between decrease in N2O and
growth of N21/2O2 product. Even slower rates for
decrease of PN2O, and for converse increases in PO2
and PN2 were found in an equivalent TPRx-N2O
experiment over a sample of this 18-OR material
prereduced at 873 K.

Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of n-
butane with O2 or N2O under continuous flow
Tables 1 and 2 show the catalytic behavior of V2O5/
MgO catalysts prepared in aqueous or methanolic
media, respectively. In all cases, C4-ole®ns (1-butene,
2-tras-butene, 2-cis-butene and butadiene), CO and
CO2 were the only reaction products with 20% O2 as
co-reactant. It should be noted that in all the catalysts
studied here, selectivities to oxydehydrogenation pro-
ducts higher than 50% were obtained at butane con-
versions lower than 40%.
Fig. 5 shows the speci®c activities (calculated at
773 K and n-butane conversions lower than 10%) and
the corresponding turnover of the catalysts. A ten-
dency of speci®c activity to increase with V-loading is
evident with 36-OR rather than 40-AC. In respect of
turnover, the 36-OR sample is also exceptional in
being somewhat higher than for the 40-AC sample
of comparable V-loading. At lower V-loading of ca.
18%, the reverse is true with less turnover for 18-OR
than for 19-AC. However, within either the OR-series
or AC-series, the highest turnover was observed for
the lowest V-loading studied. This trend for turnover
to decrease with increasing V-loading points to a
decreasing number of ODH sites with increasing V-
loading. Since, present characterizations of the mate-
rials indicated higher crystallinities at higher loadings
and for OR-series, the trend of turnover values in
Fig. 5 is consistent with an inverse relationship
between crystallinity and turnover.
Variation of the selectivity to the main reaction
products as a function of the butane conversion on
the 19-AC sample at 773 and 823 K is shown in Fig. 6.

Similar results were obtained on the other samples.
The selectivity to monoole®ns decreases with the
butane conversion, while the selectivity to butadiene
initially increases with the butane conversion, show-
ing a maximum at butane conversion of 40%. On the
other hand, CO and CO2 are formed at low butane
conversion (with initial selectivities of ca. 20±30%)
and their selectivities increase as the butane conver-
sion is increased. In addition, it can be seen that the
selectivity to C4-ole®ns increases with the reaction
temperature while the selectivity to CO2 shows an
opposite trend.
Fig. 7 shows variation of the selectivity to each C4-
ole®n with the vanadium content (as V2O5). It can be
seen that samples with vanadium loading higher than
15 wt% are the most selective catalysts. However,
small differences in the selectivity to C4-ole®ns are
observed on these samples.
Scheme 1 represents a possible reaction network for
the oxydehydrogenation of n-butane, which is broadly
consistent with the foregoing results using dioxygen as
oxidant. Formation of a butyl radical via hydrogen
abstraction from butane by surface lattice oxygen is
envisaged, followed by loss of a second hydrogen to
yield monoole®ns, butadiene formation by consecu-
tive reactions, and competition due to carbon oxide
formation from both butyl radicals and butenes [2,4].
Prompted by literature reports on the use of N2O as
oxidant in catalysis of alkane ODH by other metal-
oxide-supported catalysts [38±42], such studies were

made using a continuous ¯ow of (C4H10N2O) as
feed gas in order to establish the extent to which N2O
as oxidant affected steady-state catalytic performance
of the MgO-supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Data
comparing the catalytic behavior of OR-18 sample
during the ODH of n-butane using O2 or N2O as
oxidant are summarised in Table 3. Data shown
therein for the same temperature and identical contact
time, show that the conversion of n-butane with O2 as
oxidant was higher than with N2O, whereas the selec-
tivity to oxydehydrogenation products was higher
when N2O was used as oxidant. The observation of
lower overall n-butane conversion with N2O as oxi-
dant rather than O2 ± despite equal oxygen-atom
content in the feed gas in both cases ± implied that
N2O induces decreases in a rate-limiting step of
Scheme 1. On the other hand, although comparisons
between selectivities to butadiene achieved at 773 and
823 K under similar W/F values show higher selectiv-
ities at 823 K with either O2 or N2O as oxidant,
proportionately greater enhancement is achieved with
N2O. An important contributory factor to such
enhancement by N2O at 823 K appeared to be sig-
ni®cantly greater diminution of selectivity to COx for
the C4H10/N2O system at that temperature (cf. data at
W/F20.1 in Table 3). Present data do not permit
unequivocal conclusions to be drawn concerning pos-
sible contribution to those differences by processes
similar to those identi®ed by other workers for (alka-
neN2O) reactant over other vanadium containing
solids: (i) proposals by Bellussi et al. [38] that for-
mation of Oÿ species from N2O were responsible for
higher selectivity to propene and onset of propane
conversion at lower temperatures over vanadium sili-
calite than with O2 as oxidant; and (ii) proposals by
Ilchenko et al. [41] that a higher activation energy for
methane oxidation by O2 than by N2O was responsible
for greater alkane oxidation with N2O than O2 at
723 K, but the converse at 823 K.

gaseous

and
Vanadia/MgO
catalysts of the types described here, included the
following:
(i) Tests of the validity, for present catalysts, of the
central importance of lattice oxygens in allowing such
catalysts to initially achieve initial activities and
alkene selectivities in ODH of alkane, even in the
absence of any gaseous oxygen. Con®rmation of this
point is provided by the data summarized in bar-chart
form within Fig. 8(A). Part A of the ®gure shows
overall conversions of the n-butane content of alkane-
only pulses at 773, 798 and 823 K, and corresponding
overall selectivities to C4-ole®ns on contact of pulses
with preoxidized 25 mg aliquots of catalyst (sample
18-OR). Those observations may be contrasted with
results from pulsed-¯ow catalytic experiments over
aliquots of the catalyst which had been severely pre-
reduced in ¯owing H2 at 973 K prior to introduction of
butane-only pulses. Those are summarized in bar-
chart form in Fig. 8(B) and evidence an order-of-
magnitude decrease in butane conversions relative
to those at corresponding temperatures over non-pre-
reduced aliquots (cf. Fig. 8(A)), thus making it clear
that ready availability of surface lattice oxygens on
18.4% V2O5/MgO strongly promoted n-butane activa-
tion in initial pulses at 773, 798 and 823 K. Another,
and somewhat more surprising, negative effect on the
initial, non-steady-state activity of this catalyst was
found on switching from delivery of four butane-only
pulses at 803 K over the preoxidized catalyst to deliv-
ery of four pulses having 67 torr of O2, premixed with
the butane and then switching back to butane-only
pulses. No measurable selectivity toward butadiene
was found from any of the `butane plus premixed
O2' pulses, in striking contrast to the observation
of butadiene selectivities in the range of 2010%
from
the
preceding
or
subsequent
butane-only
pulses. Rationalization of that limited data is possible
in terms of autocatalytic generation of some ODH-
active
sites
by
butane-only
pulses,
but
with
development of such sites being averted due to rapid
reoxidation by the oxygen content of (butaneO2)
pulses.

(ii) Over aliquots of catalyst (sample 18-OR) having
ready availability of surface lattice oxygens (i.e. in
preoxidized form), a comparison was made as to how
the ratio (Percentage C4-alkene product selectivity):
(Percentage n-butane conversion) varied when N2O
replaced O2 as gaseous oxidant admixed with n-butane
in reactant pulses. A higher ratio of N2O : C4H10 than
that of O2 : C4H10 (9.5 and 4.8, respectively) was used
to ensure comparable at% oxygen content in the
reactant. The two plots in Fig. 9(A) summarize as
initial-selectivity vs. initial-activity plots the results
obtained from such comparisons in pulsed ¯ow con-
ditions at Trx 773 to 823 K over 18-OR sample using
either O2 (Plot B) or N2O (Plot A) as gas-phase
oxidant. Various Trx were used to achieve data extend-
ing from the high C4 selectivity/low-conversion
regime
to
the
lower-selectivity/higher-conversion
regime. In both regimes, higher selectivity resulted
from admixed N2O than from O2 at comparable
activities.
In view of results in (i) above, comparisons such as
those in (ii) seemed more likely to re¯ect differences
between the in¯uence of N2O and of O2 on post-
primary oxidation events as per Scheme 1, than on the
primary n-butane activation step. Pulsed ¯ow experi-
ments, to determine which of the post primary oxida-
tion processes in Scheme 1 was affected differently by
N2O than by O2, were made by comparing conversions
of butane with N2O or O2, and butene with N2O or O2.
The results in Fig. 10 show how, irrespective of the
oxidant, butene reactivity and the diene yield thereof
remained unaffected. However, with butane as reac-
tant, the observation of a much diminished diene yield
with O2 relative to that with N2O pointed to dioxygen
being much more ef®cient in the non-selective oxida-
tion of C4H9 to COx at 803 K. Analogous pulse-
switching experiments between butane-only and
butane±N2O showed no loss of butadiene selectivity
at 803 K.

experiments, which makes apparent the inadequacy of

mechanism to account for present results, is the dif-
ferent effects demonstrated for O2 and N2O on buta-
diene selectivity (cf. Fig. 10). Such difference was not
to be expected if O2 and N2O had simply acted to
reoxidize, with equal ef®ciency, the surface sites
which suffered partial reduction in the ®rst step of
Scheme 1. On the other hand, and in view of the well-
established difference in oxidizing powers of O2 and
N2O toward organics, similar inadequacy does not
attach to the somewhat different post-primary actions
envisaged in Scheme 1 for O2 and N2O. In this context,
differences could be expected in the extent to which
O2 and N2O promoted non-selective oxidation of
organic intermediates to carbon oxides; thus the
recognition of this as a mechanistic factor in addition
to MVK-type reoxidation of surface sites, reduced in
the primary step of Scheme 1, is essential. Within
Scheme 1, such recognition takes form of much
stronger promotion of deep oxidation of C4H9 inter-
mediate to carbon oxides by O2 than by N2O. Present
results from continuous ¯ow catalytic runs, showing
higher selectivity to C4-ole®ns with N2O as oxidant
than O2, lend support to operation of this mechanistic
factor, in steady-state conditions, since molecular
oxygen showed stronger and less selective ODH char-
acter than N2O, possibly via differing reactivities
toward C4H9 surface intermediates, such as C4H9-
V4-OH [38±41].
In conclusion, two variations of the wet-impregna-
tion method have been employed in order to obtain
MgO-supported vanadia catalysts with different vana-
dium-loading and different surface area. MgO and
Mg-orthovanadate (Mg3V2O8) are the main crystal-
line phases, although their crystallinities depend on
both the preparation method and V-loading of cata-
lysts. On the other hand, tetrahedral V5-species with
different distortion degree are mainly observed, which
can be related to Mg-orthovanadate in both amorphous
and crystalline phases. These vanadium species also
show a different reducibility, the more crystalline
phase, the lower reducibility of its vanadium species.
Oxygen isotopic-exchange experiments indicate a
small activity for homophase isotopic exchange
(R0-type) at 823 K, while an R2-type is observed
at temperatures higher than 1023 K. In addition, it
can be concluded, in the reaction conditions used
during the ODH of alkanes, that heterophase oxygen
isotopic exchange did not occur. However, a high
incorporation of oxygen is observed if the catalyst
is previously reduced, indicating that reoxidation step
is fast.
On the other hand, the catalytic results for the ODH
of n-butane using O2 as oxidant indicate that the
preparation procedure of catalysts determine the cat-
alytic performance of V±Mg±O catalysts. However,
the incorporation of N2O as oxidant increases the
selectivity to butadiene at high butane conversions.
This catalytic behavior can be explained on consider-
ing that, in these conditions, oxygen species adsorbed
on reduced sites can react with ole®ns favoring deep
oxidation reactions, while, in the case of N2O, a low
concentration of adsorbed oxygen on the catalyst
surface will favor a low consecutive oxidation of
butadiene.
