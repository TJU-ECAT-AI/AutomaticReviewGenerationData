[1] "Overall, the O(1) vanadyl site is the most active site on the unsupported and supported vanadia surface."
[2] "Supporting a vanadia monolayer on titania strongly enhances the CAH bond activation as compared to unsupported V2O5, yielding a lower activation energy and a more exothermic propane chemisorption."
[3] "In the case of the supported catalyst, propane oxidation to propanal or acetone is hindered mostly by the second H abstraction step (7a ? 10a,7b ? 10b)."
[4] "Therefore, propene formation via an adsorbed propoxide intermediate (path II or III) is less favourable than propene formation directly from the propyl radical (path I), that is,without chemisorption of the propyl radical (3a ? 6a, 3a ? 7a,3b ? 6b, 3b ? 7b)."
[5] "Overall, the O(1) vanadyl site is the most active site on the unsupported and supported vanadia surface."
[6] "The goal of this theoretical study is to assess the activity and selectivity of the different oxygen sites in propane selective oxidation and to obtain a quantitative insight in the reaction mecha- nism."

1. The vanadyl oxygen (O(1)) is the most active site for both the unsupported and supported vanadia surfaces in terms of propane selective oxidation.

2. The titania support significantly improves the CAH bond activation, resulting in a lower activation energy and more exothermic propane chemisorption compared to unsupported V2O5.

3. In the case of the supported catalyst, the second hydrogen abstraction step is the main hindrance for propane oxidation to propanal or acetone.

4. Propene formation is more favorable via direct abstraction from the propyl radical rather than through an adsorbed propoxide intermediate, especially when considering the second hydrogen abstraction step.

5. The vanadyl oxygen (O(1)) is identified as the most active site for propane selective oxidation across both catalyst types.

6. The aim of the study is to evaluate the activity and selectivity of various oxygen sites in propane selective oxidation and gain a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanism.

1. 在未支持和支撑的钒酸盐表面上，范德华氧（O(1)）是选择性氧化丙烷的最活跃位点。

2. 与未支持的V2O5相比，通过在二氧化钛上支撑钒酸盐单层可以显著增强CAH键激活，导致丙烷吸附的更低活化能和更放热。

3. 对于支持催化剂，第二个氢抽象步骤是丙烷氧化为丙酮或乙醛的主要障碍。

4. 丙烯的形成更倾向于直接从丙基自由基而不是通过吸附的丙醇中间体进行，尤其是在考虑第二个氢抽象步骤时。

5. 在两种催化剂类型中，范德华氧（O(1)）被确定为丙烷选择性氧化的最活跃位点。

6. 研究的目标是评估各种氧位点在丙烷选择性氧化中的活性和选择性，并获得反应机制的深入理解。
