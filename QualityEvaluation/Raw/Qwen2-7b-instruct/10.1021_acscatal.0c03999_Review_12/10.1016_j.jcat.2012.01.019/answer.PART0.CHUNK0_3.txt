[1] "Overall, the O(1) vanadyl site is the most active site on the unsupported and supported vanadia surface."
[2] "As seen from Fig. 3, all three types of bond activation have been examined for propane chemisorption, namely CAH bond activation at the primary or secondary position and CAC bond activation."
[3] "The calculations show that the titania support not only modifies the activity of the vanadia monolayer but it also affects the selectivity of the catalyst, favouring the formation of propene compared to the formation of i-propanol and acetone."
[4] "The goal of this theoretical study is to assess the activity and selectivity of the different oxygen sites in propane selective oxidation and to obtain a quantitative insight in the reaction mechanism."
[5] "Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the desorption energies on different oxygen sites do not need to follow the same order as the oxygen vacancy formation energies."
[6] "Therefore, based on a comparison between the highest energy barriers found for the reaction paths considered (see Tables S6 and 3), the most reactive site of the unsupported catalyst is the O(1) vanadyl site, with i-propanol formation being more favourable than n-propanol formation on this site."
[7] "On the other hand, for the supported catalyst, propane oxidation to propanal or acetone is hindered mostly by the second H abstraction step (7a ? 10a,7b ? 10b)."
[8] "Therefore, assuming that the total oxidation of propane occurs via the parallel-consecutive scheme of Fig. 13 [11,12], supporting a vanadia monolayer on titania will strongly favour the consecutive pathway via propene formation over the direct combustion of propane."

The vanadyl oxygen site (O(1)) is the most active site on both the unsupported and supported vanadia surfaces for the selective oxidation of propane. This site facilitates the activation of the C-H bond through a direct hydrogen abstraction, leading to the formation of propene. The presence of a titania support on the vanadia monolayer enhances the activation of the C-H bond, making the process more exothermic and thus favoring the formation of propene over i-propanol and acetone. The theoretical study aims to quantitatively understand the reaction mechanism, focusing on the different oxygen sites involved in propane oxidation. The desorption energies on different oxygen sites do not always match the order of oxygen vacancy formation energies. On the unsupported catalyst, the O(1) vanadyl site is the most reactive for propane oxidation, with i-propanol formation being favored. However, on the supported catalyst, the process is hindered by the high desorption energy and initial activation energy, leading to propene formation being favored. Supporting a vanadia monolayer on titania shifts the reaction pathway towards propene formation, making it the predominant product in the total oxidation of propane, rather than direct combustion.

在未支持和支撑的钒酸盐表面中，钒氧原子（O(1)）是最活跃的位点，用于选择性氧化丙烷。该位点通过直接氢提取激活C-H键，导致丙烯的形成。钛酸盐支持增强了C-H键的活化，使过程更放热，从而有利于丙烯的形成而非异丙醇和乙酮。理论研究旨在定量理解反应机制，重点是不同氧位参与丙烷氧化的作用。不同氧位的脱附能与氧空位形成能的顺序并不总是一致的。在未支持的催化剂上，O(1)钒氧位是最活跃的丙烷氧化位点，异丙醇的形成被偏好。然而，在支撑催化剂上，过程受到高脱附能和初始激活能量的阻碍，导致丙烯的形成被优先。支撑钒酸盐单层在钛酸盐上的放置将反应途径转向丙烯形成，使其成为丙烷完全氧化的主要产物，而不是直接燃烧。
