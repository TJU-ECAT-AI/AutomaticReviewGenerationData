The study aims to evaluate the activity and selectivity of various oxygen sites in propane selective oxidation, providing insights into the reaction mechanism. Propane chemisorption may occur via a concerted or a two-step process, known as the rebound mechanism. The calculated physisorption energies align well with those obtained from molecular mechanics simulations. Supporting a vanadia monolayer on titania enhances CAH bond activation, reducing the activation energy and increasing the exothermic nature of propane chemisorption. The O(1) vanadyl site is the most active on both unsupported and supported vanadia surfaces, indicating its key role in propane selective oxidation. Comparisons between competing reaction pathways on the vanadyl oxygen site reveal that spin-crossing processes with biradical transition states characterize the rate-determining step for propane oxidation on both catalysts.

本研究旨在评估不同氧位在丙烷选择性氧化中的活性和选择性，并获得反应机制的定量理解。丙烷化学吸附可能通过协同或两步过程发生，即所谓的反弹机制。计算的物理吸附能与分子力学模拟结果相吻合，且最稳定物理吸附状态的吸附能接近实验测定值。将范德亚蒂单层支持在钛酸盐上显著增强了CAH键活化，降低了活化能并提高了丙烷化学吸附的放热性质。O(1)范德亚蒂位点是未支撑和支撑范德亚蒂表面中活性最高的位点，表明其在丙烷选择性氧化中的关键作用。对范德亚蒂氧位上的竞争反应途径的比较揭示了两种催化剂上丙烷氧化的决定步骤为经过自旋交叉过程的半径态过渡态。
