[1] "The goal of this theoretical study is to assess the activity and selectivity of the different oxygen sites in propane selective oxidation and to obtain a quantitative insight in the reaction mecha- nism."
[2] "The calculations show that the titania support not only modifies the activity of the vanadia monolayer but it also affects the selectivity of the catalyst, favouring the formation of propene compared to the formation of i-propanol and acetone."
[3] "In addition, starting from physisorbed propane, two different pathways have been envisaged for propanal/acetone formation."
[4] "As depicted in Table S8 of the Supporting information, paths II and III are kinetically equivalent, since they share the same potentially rate-limiting step (i.e. beta H abstraction from the propoxide intermediate: 7a ? 8, 7b ? 8) in all cases, and a separate discussion on each one of them is not needed."
[5] "Overall, for both catalysts, the lowest energy pathways are obtained on the vanadyl oxygen sites (see Fig. 8c)."

1. The objective of this theoretical investigation is to evaluate the activity and selectivity of various oxygen sites in the selective oxidation of propane, aiming to quantitatively understand the reaction mechanism.

2. It is demonstrated that the presence of titania as a support not only alters the activity of the vanadia monolayer but also influences the selectivity of the catalyst, promoting the formation of propene over i-propanol and acetone.

3. Two distinct routes have been conceptualized for the formation of propanal/acetone from physisorbed propane.

4. It is noted that paths II and III, despite being separate, share a common rate-limiting step—the beta H abstraction from the propoxide intermediate—which renders a detailed examination of each pathway unnecessary.

5. Across both catalysts, the most energetically favorable pathways are found to occur on the vanadyl oxygen sites.

1. 本理论研究的目标是评估丙烷选择性氧化中不同氧位的活性和选择性，并对反应机制进行定量理解。

2. 结果表明，二氧化钛的存在不仅改变了范德华单层的活性，还影响了催化剂的选择性，倾向于形成丙烯而不是异丙醇和乙酮。

3. 已设想了从物理吸附的丙烷出发形成丙酮/乙酮的两种不同路径。

4. 发现路径II和III，尽管是分开的，但共享一个共同的速率决定步骤——丙酸酯中间体上的β氢抽象，因此无需对每个路径进行详细讨论。

5. 在两种催化剂中，最有利的能量路径均发生在钒氧位。
