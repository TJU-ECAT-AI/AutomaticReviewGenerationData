As seen from Fig. 1, this model is a (1  2) super cell of (001) V2O5, which corresponds to a surface area of 0.83 nm2 (i.e. 1165.8 pm  715.1 pm) and a propane coverage of 1/8 ML (i.e. one propane molecule per eight surface vanadium atoms).

Supporting a vanadia mono-layer on titania strongly enhances the CAH bond activation as compared to unsupported V2O5, yielding a lower activation energy and a more exothermic propane chemisorption.

The vanadyl oxygen is overall the most active site on V2O5 and V2O5/TiO2, while the bridging oxygen is more selective towards propane dehydrogenation.

The calculations show that the titania support not only modifies the activity of the vanadia monolayer but it also affects the selectivity of the catalyst, favouring the formation of propene compared to the formation of i-propanol and acetone.

The vanadyl oxygen is the most active site on both catalysts, while the bridging oxygen is more selective for propane dehydrogenation.

The presence of TiO2 support leads to a more favorable activation energy and a more exothermic propane chemisorption compared to unsupported V2O5.

The calculations reveal that the titania support modifies the activity and selectivity of the vanadia monolayer, favoring propene formation over i-propanol and acetone.

1. The (1  2) super cell model for the unsupported V2O5 surface has a surface area of 0.83 nm2 and a propane coverage of 1/8 ML, while the (3  2) super cell model for the V2O5/TiO2 system has a surface area of 0.88 nm2 and a propane coverage of 1/6 ML. 

2. The TiO2 support enhances the CAH bond activation, resulting in a lower activation energy and a more exothermic propane chemisorption compared to unsupported V2O5.

3. The vanadyl oxygen is the most active site for propane selective oxidation on both the unsupported V2O5 and V2O5/TiO2 surfaces.

4. The bridging oxygen is more selective for propane dehydrogenation compared to the vanadyl oxygen.

5. The support of vanadia on TiO2 modifies the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, favoring propene formation over the formation of i-propanol and acetone.

6. The calculations demonstrate that the TiO2 support improves the activity of the vanadia monolayer, making it more effective in propane selective oxidation.

7. The presence of TiO2 support leads to an overall enhancement in the efficiency of the vanadia catalyst for propane selective oxidation, especially in terms of propene formation.
