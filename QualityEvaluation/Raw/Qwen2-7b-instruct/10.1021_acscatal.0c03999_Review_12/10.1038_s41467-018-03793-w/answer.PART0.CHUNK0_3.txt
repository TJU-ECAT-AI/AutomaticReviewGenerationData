The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, facilitate CO2 activation through multiple oxidation states, enabling the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. These catalysts effectively consume CO2 while producing propylene, aligning with the dual utilization of underused reactants. On the other hand, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 are instrumental in storing and releasing oxygen, which aids in direct CO bond scission of CO2. This process contributes to the activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation. Transition metal clusters offer a unique advantage by forming specific interfaces, such as FeO/Ni(111), which promote selective C-H bond scission versus C-C bond cleavage. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation varies, with the proposed mechanisms focusing on CO2 dissociation energy barriers and the role of traditional oxidants versus CO2 as a mild oxidant. The document highlights the identification of FeNi and NiPt catalysts as promising candidates for CO2-ODHP and dry reforming, respectively, with the former showing promise for propylene production and the latter for CO selectivity.

氧化脱氢反应中，烷烃的C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机制在红氧化活性和非氧化活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异。红氧化活性催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，通过多种氧化状态促进CO2活化，从而实现丙烷的氧化脱氢。这些催化剂有效消耗CO2同时产生丙烯，与两种未充分利用的反应物的结合一致。相比之下，非氧化活性催化剂如CeO2通过存储和释放氧气来辅助CO2活化，这有助于直接CO键断裂的CO2。这一过程促进了氧化脱氢的作用。过渡金属簇提供了一种独特优势，通过形成特定界面，如FeO/Ni(111)，促进选择性C-H键断裂而非C-C键裂解。不同催化剂在激活CO2进行氧化脱氢的有效性各不相同，重点关注CO2解离能量壁垒以及传统氧化剂与CO2作为温和氧化剂的作用。文献强调了FeNi和NiPt催化剂作为CO2-ODHP和干重整的有前景候选者的识别，前者显示出丙烯生产的前景，后者显示了CO选择性。
