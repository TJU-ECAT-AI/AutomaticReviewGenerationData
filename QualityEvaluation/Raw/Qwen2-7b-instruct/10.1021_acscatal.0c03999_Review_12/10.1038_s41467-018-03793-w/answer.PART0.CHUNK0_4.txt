[1] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equili- brium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), as seen in the thermo- dynamic calculations in Fig. 1a."
[2] "Unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the pro- duction of carbon oxides."
[3] "Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression."
[4] "In-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements revealed the oxi- dation states of metals under reaction conditions and density functional theory calculations were utilized to identify the most favorable reaction pathways over the two types of catalysts."
[5] "The DFT calculation results indicate that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni (111) interface should favor CH bond scission for the CO2- ODHP pathway, whereas the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface should favor the CC bond cleavage for the DRP pathway."

Comparing redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, traditional oxidants like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 facilitate the activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by promoting CO bond scission. Ceria (CeO2) supports redox-inactive metal catalysts by storing and releasing oxygen, enabling direct CO bond scission of CO2 and suppressing coke formation. Traditional oxidants and CO2 together enhance propane conversion through the reverse water gas shift reaction. Density functional theory calculations confirm the most favorable reaction pathways over the two types of catalysts. The mechanism involves CO2 dissociation, leading to the formation of CO and O2, which then participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The effectiveness of different catalysts depends on their ability to activate CO2 and the redox properties that facilitate the cleavage of C-H and C-C bonds. Precious metal bimetallic catalysts like Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt exhibit selective activity for oxidative dehydrogenation and dry reforming, respectively, highlighting the importance of surface chemistry and metal interactions in determining catalytic performance.

在烷烃氧化脱氢中，活性氧化物催化剂如V2O5和VOx/SiO2通过促进CO键断裂来激活CO2，从而增强丙烷转化。氧化性较差的氧化物如CeO2支持非氧化性金属催化剂，通过存储和释放氧气，实现直接CO2中的CO键断裂，并抑制焦炭生成。传统氧化剂与CO2一起通过逆向水煤气变换反应增强丙烷转化。密度泛函理论计算确认了两种催化剂类型下的最优反应路径。机制涉及CO2的分解，形成CO和O2，然后参与氧化脱氢过程。不同催化剂的有效性取决于它们激活CO2的能力以及促进C-H和C-C键断裂的还原性质。非贵金属双金属催化剂如Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt分别显示出对氧化脱氢和干重整的选择性活性，强调了表面化学和金属相互作用在确定催化性能中的重要性。
