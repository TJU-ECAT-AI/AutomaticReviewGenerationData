[2] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway."
[3] "Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."
[4] "Fe3Ni(111) surface promotes the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2 while the Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surface promotes the C-C bond cleavage of propane to form *CO."
[5] "The DFT results reveal that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes involves distinct pathways, where CO2 can activate C-H bonds for propane conversion. Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as CeO2, play a crucial role in CO2 activation for oxidative dehydrogenation. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts might not efficiently activate CO2. For example, Fe3Ni catalysts demonstrate high selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway, producing propylene. Meanwhile, Ni3Pt catalysts are effective for the dry reforming pathway, generating CO. The specific mechanisms involve different surface interactions and binding energies, which determine the preferential pathway for C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration. DFT calculations predict that the Fe3Ni(111) surface favors CH bond cleavage, whereas the Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surface promotes C-C bond cleavage.

烷烃的氧化脱氢涉及不同的路径，其中CO2可以激活丙烷中的C-H键进行转化。具有还原性的金属氧化物催化剂，如CeO2，在CO2激活氧化脱氢中起关键作用。相比之下，不具有还原性的金属氧化物催化剂可能无法有效地激活CO2。例如，Fe3Ni催化剂显示出高选择性用于氧化脱氢途径，产生丙烯。同时，Ni3Pt催化剂对干重整路径有效，产生CO。具体机制涉及不同的表面相互作用和结合能，这决定了C-H键激活和催化剂再生的首选途径。DFT计算预测，Fe3Ni(111)表面倾向于促进CH键断裂，而Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)表面则促进C-C键断裂。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 as a reactant offers a dual benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and producing propylene. Two types of bimetallic catalysts, Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt, have been identified for this process. Fe3Ni selectively produces propylene via oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, while Ni3Pt efficiently generates synthesis gas with a high selectivity towards CO through dry reforming. DFT calculations predict that the Fe3Ni surface favors the oxidative cleavage of C-H bonds, leading to propylene production, whereas the Ni3Pt surface promotes the cleavage of C-C bonds, resulting in CO generation. These findings highlight the distinct roles of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation and dry reforming, emphasizing the importance of surface chemistry in determining the reaction pathways and product selectivities.

The document discusses the development of technologies for the on-purpose production of propylene, aiming to address the global production gap. It highlights the potential of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) as a method that can consume greenhouse gases while filling the propylene production gap. CO2 increases the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction. Using CO2 as a mild oxidant reduces over-oxidation and carbon oxides production. Ceria (CeO2) is noted for its ability to store and release oxygen, which can induce CO bond scission in CO2 and prevent coking. The document also mentions that flow reactor studies indicate that Fe3Ni catalyst shows promise for CO2-ODHP, while Ni3Pt catalyst is active for dry reforming with high selectivity towards CO. Activation energies were measured within a specific temperature range, and the declining reaction rates suggest competition for catalytic sites between reactants.

文档讨论了针对全球丙烯生产缺口开发更多专向丙烯技术的可能性。它强调了通过二氧化碳氧化脱氢化丙烷（CO2-ODHP）的方法，可以消耗温室气体并填补丙烯生产缺口的潜力。CO2通过逆向水煤气变换反应增加丙烷的平衡转化率，同时消耗氢气。使用CO2作为温和氧化剂可减少过氧化和碳氧化物的产生。CeO2因其能够存储和释放氧气而被提及，这种特性可以诱导CO2中的CO键断裂，并防止结焦。文档还提到，在流反应器研究中，Fe3Ni催化剂显示出对CO2-ODHP途径的高选择性，而Ni3Pt催化剂在干重整中表现出高CO选择性。测量了特定温度范围内的活化能，下降的反应速率表明在反应物过剩时催化位点的数量较少，暗示着吸附剂和/或表面中间体的竞争吸附。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, facilitate CO2 activation through multiple oxidation states, enabling the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. These catalysts effectively consume CO2 while producing propylene, aligning with the dual utilization of underused reactants. On the other hand, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 are instrumental in storing and releasing oxygen, which aids in direct CO bond scission of CO2. This process contributes to the activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation. Transition metal clusters offer a unique advantage by forming specific interfaces, such as FeO/Ni(111), which promote selective C-H bond scission versus C-C bond cleavage. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation varies, with the proposed mechanisms focusing on CO2 dissociation energy barriers and the role of traditional oxidants versus CO2 as a mild oxidant. The document highlights the identification of FeNi and NiPt catalysts as promising candidates for CO2-ODHP and dry reforming, respectively, with the former showing promise for propylene production and the latter for CO selectivity.

氧化脱氢反应中，烷烃的C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机制在红氧化活性和非氧化活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异。红氧化活性催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，通过多种氧化状态促进CO2活化，从而实现丙烷的氧化脱氢。这些催化剂有效消耗CO2同时产生丙烯，与两种未充分利用的反应物的结合一致。相比之下，非氧化活性催化剂如CeO2通过存储和释放氧气来辅助CO2活化，这有助于直接CO键断裂的CO2。这一过程促进了氧化脱氢的作用。过渡金属簇提供了一种独特优势，通过形成特定界面，如FeO/Ni(111)，促进选择性C-H键断裂而非C-C键裂解。不同催化剂在激活CO2进行氧化脱氢的有效性各不相同，重点关注CO2解离能量壁垒以及传统氧化剂与CO2作为温和氧化剂的作用。文献强调了FeNi和NiPt催化剂作为CO2-ODHP和干重整的有前景候选者的识别，前者显示出丙烯生产的前景，后者显示了CO选择性。

Comparing redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, traditional oxidants like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 facilitate the activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by promoting CO bond scission. Ceria (CeO2) supports redox-inactive metal catalysts by storing and releasing oxygen, enabling direct CO bond scission of CO2 and suppressing coke formation. Traditional oxidants and CO2 together enhance propane conversion through the reverse water gas shift reaction. Density functional theory calculations confirm the most favorable reaction pathways over the two types of catalysts. The mechanism involves CO2 dissociation, leading to the formation of CO and O2, which then participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The effectiveness of different catalysts depends on their ability to activate CO2 and the redox properties that facilitate the cleavage of C-H and C-C bonds. Precious metal bimetallic catalysts like Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt exhibit selective activity for oxidative dehydrogenation and dry reforming, respectively, highlighting the importance of surface chemistry and metal interactions in determining catalytic performance.
