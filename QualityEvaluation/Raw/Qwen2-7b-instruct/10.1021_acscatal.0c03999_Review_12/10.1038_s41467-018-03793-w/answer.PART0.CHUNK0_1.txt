[1] "The inherent variability and insufficiencies in the co-production of propylene from steam crackers has raised concerns regarding the global propylene production gap and has directed industry to develop more on-purpose propylene technologies."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) can potentially fill this gap while consuming a greenhouse gas."
[3] "The reactions of CO2 with propane may occur through two distinct pathways, oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2 + C3H8 C3H6 + CO + H2O) and dry reforming (3CO2 + C3H8 6CO + 4H2)."
[4] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."
[5] "The DFT calculation results indicate that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni (111) interface should favor CH bond scission for the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface should favor the CC bond cleavage for the DRP pathway."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 as a reactant offers a dual benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and producing propylene. Two types of bimetallic catalysts, Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt, have been identified for this process. Fe3Ni selectively produces propylene via oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, while Ni3Pt efficiently generates synthesis gas with a high selectivity towards CO through dry reforming. DFT calculations predict that the Fe3Ni surface favors the oxidative cleavage of C-H bonds, leading to propylene production, whereas the Ni3Pt surface promotes the cleavage of C-C bonds, resulting in CO generation. These findings highlight the distinct roles of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation and dry reforming, emphasizing the importance of surface chemistry in determining the reaction pathways and product selectivities.

氧化丙烷使用二氧化碳作为反应物，既减少了温室气体排放，又能生产丙烯。两种双金属催化剂，Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt，已被识别用于这一过程。Fe3Ni选择性地通过氧化脱氢化丙烷产生丙烯，而Ni3Pt高效地通过干燥重整生成合成气，其CO选择性特别高。DFT计算预测，Fe3Ni表面有利于C-H键的氧化断裂，导致丙烯的产生，而Ni3Pt表面促进C-C键的断裂，最终产生CO。这些发现强调了这些催化剂在激活二氧化碳进行氧化脱氢化和干燥重整中各自的作用，以及表面化学在确定反应途径和产品选择性的关键作用。
