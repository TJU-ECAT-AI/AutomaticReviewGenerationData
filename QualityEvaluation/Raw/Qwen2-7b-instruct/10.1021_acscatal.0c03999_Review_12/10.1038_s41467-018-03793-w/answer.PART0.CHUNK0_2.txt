[1] "The inherent variability and insufficiencies in the co-production of propylene from steam crackers has raised concerns regarding the global propylene production gap and has directed industry to develop more on-purpose propylene technologies."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) can potentially fill this gap while consuming a greenhouse gas."
[3] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equili- brium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS)."
[4] "Unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the production of carbon oxides."
[5] "This in turn would reduce catalyst deactivation due to coking and phase transformations triggered by the relatively high temperatures commonly used in DRM."
[6] "While there are studies that examine the CO2-ODHP or DRP separately, a thorough examination utilizing supported bimetallic catalysts at a temperature range that allows both pathways to occur is still lacking."
[7] "Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression."
[8] "In summary, steady- state flow reactor studies indicate that Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."
[9] "The activation energies were derived by measuring production rates in the temperature range of 803843 K."
[10] "The declining rates signify that there are less catalytic sites available for one reactant when the other is in excess, indicative of competitive adsorption of adsorbates and/or surface intermediates."

The document discusses the development of technologies for the on-purpose production of propylene, aiming to address the global production gap. It highlights the potential of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) as a method that can consume greenhouse gases while filling the propylene production gap. CO2 increases the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction. Using CO2 as a mild oxidant reduces over-oxidation and carbon oxides production. Ceria (CeO2) is noted for its ability to store and release oxygen, which can induce CO bond scission in CO2 and prevent coking. The document also mentions that flow reactor studies indicate that Fe3Ni catalyst shows promise for CO2-ODHP, while Ni3Pt catalyst is active for dry reforming with high selectivity towards CO. Activation energies were measured within a specific temperature range, and the declining reaction rates suggest competition for catalytic sites between reactants.

文档讨论了针对全球丙烯生产缺口开发更多专向丙烯技术的可能性。它强调了通过二氧化碳氧化脱氢化丙烷（CO2-ODHP）的方法，可以消耗温室气体并填补丙烯生产缺口的潜力。CO2通过逆向水煤气变换反应增加丙烷的平衡转化率，同时消耗氢气。使用CO2作为温和氧化剂可减少过氧化和碳氧化物的产生。CeO2因其能够存储和释放氧气而被提及，这种特性可以诱导CO2中的CO键断裂，并防止结焦。文档还提到，在流反应器研究中，Fe3Ni催化剂显示出对CO2-ODHP途径的高选择性，而Ni3Pt催化剂在干重整中表现出高CO选择性。测量了特定温度范围内的活化能，下降的反应速率表明在反应物过剩时催化位点的数量较少，暗示着吸附剂和/或表面中间体的竞争吸附。
