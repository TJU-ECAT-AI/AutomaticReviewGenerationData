[1] "Nitrous oxide introduced into the reaction medium was partly utilized for ethane oxidation and it was also directly decomposed to N2 and O2 over iron modified catalysts."
[2] "The decomposition of N2O led to the formation of different oxygen species. Some of them may recombine (Eq. (3)) or react with a subsequent N2O molecule (Eq. (2)) forming O2 molecules almost inactive for ODH reaction performed in the presence of iron modified zeolites."
[3] "Only iron species accommodated in zeolite channels (ZSM-5, mordenite) or cages (faujasite) (Fig. 2) showed activity for the oxydehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of N2O as an oxidant."
[4] "Taking into consideration that the first reaction step both for N2O decomposition and for hydrocarbon ODH requires N2O activation with the subsequent formation of active oxygen species O* one could expect that iron complexes of similar structure should be responsible both for N2O decomposition and ODH reaction, as consistent with the suggestion of Kondratenko and Pe rez-Ramirez [3]."
[5] "The use of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation results in simultaneous, effective N2O utilization."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, involve the activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane through the reduction of CO2 to CO or even C. The activation barrier for CO2 dissociation is lower in redox-active catalysts, allowing for more efficient CO2 utilization. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts do not undergo a significant reduction phase, thus not facilitating CO2 activation effectively. In the context of CO2 utilization, the redox-active catalysts offer a more promising pathway for oxidative dehydrogenation, particularly in scenarios where CO2 is the primary oxidant.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is highly dependent on their ability to reduce CO2 to CO or even C. V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters demonstrate varying degrees of CO2 reduction capability, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 being more proficient due to their intrinsic redox properties. These catalysts can facilitate the dissociation of CO2 into CO or even C, enabling the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to occur. The role of traditional oxidants, such as O2 or N2O, in this process is to provide oxygen for the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, rather than directly activating CO2. The effectiveness of these oxidants is enhanced when used in conjunction with catalysts that possess the ability to activate CO2, leading to simultaneous and effective utilization of both the alkane feedstock and the CO2 source.

氧化脱氢反应中，烷烃的C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机制在氧化活性和氧化惰性金属氧化物催化剂之间有所不同。氧化活性催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇，通过将CO2还原为CO或甚至C来促进丙烷的氧化脱氢。CO2的激活壁垒在氧化活性催化剂中较低，允许更有效的CO2利用。相比之下，氧化惰性催化剂不经历显著的还原阶段，因此不能有效地激活CO2。在考虑CO2利用时，氧化活性催化剂提供了更有前景的途径，特别是在CO2作为主要氧化剂的情况下。

不同催化剂在激活CO2以氧化脱氢丙烷的有效性依赖于它们使CO2活化的程度。V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇在激活CO2的能力上表现出不同的效果，V2O5和VOx/SiO2更为有效，因为它们具有内在的氧化还原性质。这些催化剂能够使CO2分解成CO或甚至C，从而允许进行丙烷的氧化脱氢。传统氧化剂，如O2或N2O，在此过程中充当提供氧气的氧化剂，而不是直接激活CO2。当与具有激活CO2能力的催化剂结合使用时，这些氧化剂的有效性得到增强，导致同时和有效的利用烷基原料和CO2来源。
