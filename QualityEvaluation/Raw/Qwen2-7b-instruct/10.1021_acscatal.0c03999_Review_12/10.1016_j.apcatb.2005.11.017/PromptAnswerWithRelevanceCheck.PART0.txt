Nitrous oxide, a waste by-product generated in many industrial processes such as adipic acid and nitric acid production, has been shown to be an excellent oxidant for performing some difficult oxidation processes. Direct benzene to phenol oxidation (BTOP) with N2O as an oxidant has been recently commercialised by SOLUTIA and it seems to be one of the cleanest and most elegant methods for phenol production [1].

The decomposition of N2O led to the formation of different oxygen species. Some of them may recombine (Eq. (3)) or react with a subsequent N2O molecule (Eq. (2)) forming O2 molecules almost inactive for ODH reaction performed in the presence of iron modified zeolites. Only a portion of active oxygen species is enable to react with ethane according to Eq. (4).

The number of iron ions introduced into the zeolites ZSM-5 matrix was affected by the Si/Al ratio and it was found to be equal to 1.4, 0.4 and 0.09 wt.% of Fe for Si/Al ratio 25, 50 and 100, respectively (Table 1). The activities for N2O decom- position and ethane ODH reaction recorded in our measure- ments changed parallel to the iron species concentration

Regarding the above, both the number of iron species and their structure (isolated or oligomeric complexes) should influence the catalyst activity.

The important role of cationic centres in the mechanism of the formation of a-iron complexes active for the BTOP process has been stressed by Panov et al. [14] and by other authors [15].

The presence of exchangeable cationic centres in the matrix accommodating iron complexes has a crucial role in the formation of iron species active for ODH reaction. Only iron species accom- modated in zeolite channels (ZSM-5, mordenite) or cages (faujasite) (Fig. 2) showed activity for the oxydehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of N2O as an oxidant. 

The Si/Al ratio also affects zeolite acidity. It is commonly accepted that the number and strength of acidic centres affects both the activity and selectivity of oxidation reactions.

Despite the significantly various iron capacity in ZSM-5 zeolites of an Si/Al ratio 25 and 50 (1.4 and 0.4 wt.% of iron,respectively) the ethane conversion over the samples was very similar.

High TOF for the samples with very low iron contents suggests that isolated iron species play an important role for the reaction under study.

UVvis spectra were recorded for unmodified, as well as for iron modified samples calcined at 600 and 900 8C (Fig. 9A and B). The bands recorded at about 215 and 260 nm are due to the presence of iron species and they are almost invisible in the spectrum of an unmodified sample.

The activity of the samples under study for N2O decomposition increased with iron concentration (Fig. 1). Simultaneously, with the growth of iron concentration, the intensity of UVvis bands recorded at 350 and 440 nm also increased (Fig. 9B).

Ethane oxidation over iron modified zeolites of MFI structure resulted in ethene formation with selectivity in the range from 55% to 87% (Fig. 7). 

The use of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation results in simultaneous, effective N2O utilization.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, are capable of undergoing reversible redox reactions. This allows them to activate C-H bonds through the formation of reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl (OH) and alkoxyl (RO) intermediates. The activation process often involves the adsorption of alkanes onto the catalyst surface followed by the formation of these reactive intermediates via interactions with oxygen-containing species on the catalyst surface.

Redox-inactive catalysts, on the other hand, do not undergo reversible redox reactions. Instead, they rely on the presence of oxygen or other oxidants to activate C-H bonds. For instance, in the case of N2O, it acts as an oxidant to generate oxygen species that can then participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. Catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2 can potentially facilitate CO2 activation by promoting the formation of reactive oxygen species, whereas transition metal clusters might offer unique geometries that aid in CO2 activation.

In the context of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation, the use of N2O leads to its effective utilization, with some portion being decomposed to nitrogen and oxygen. This decomposition generates active oxygen species that can react with ethane to produce olefins. The presence of iron modified zeolites facilitates this process, particularly those with the MFI structure, showing high activity for ethane oxydehydrogenation. The structure of the catalyst matrix, including the zeolite's Si/Al ratio, plays a crucial role in the formation of active iron complexes and influences the activity and selectivity of the reaction.

In summary, redox-active catalysts utilize reversible redox reactions to activate C-H bonds, while redox-inactive catalysts rely on the presence of oxidants like N2O to generate reactive oxygen species. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies based on their ability to promote the formation of reactive intermediates and the energy barriers associated with CO2 dissociation.

在烷烃氧化脱氢过程中，活性氧化剂和非活性氧化剂金属氧化物催化剂之间的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在显著差异。活性氧化催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇，能够进行可逆的氧化还原反应。这允许它们通过形成如羟基（OH）和烷氧基（RO）中间体来活化C-H键。活化过程通常涉及将烷烃吸附到催化剂表面，并通过与催化剂表面上的氧含物种的相互作用形成这些活性中间体。

相比之下，非活性氧化催化剂不会进行可逆氧化还原反应。相反，它们依赖于氧气或其他氧化剂的存在来活化C-H键。例如，在使用N2O作为氧化剂的情况下，它可以生成活性氧物种，然后参与氧化脱氢过程。不同催化剂在CO2活化以进行丙烷氧化脱氢中的有效性取决于CO2分解提出的机制和能量壁垒。V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2等催化剂可能通过促进活性氧物种的形成来促进CO2活化，而过渡金属簇可能提供有助于CO2活化的独特几何形状。

在使用N2O作为乙烷氧化脱氢氧化剂的背景下，N2O的使用导致其有效利用，部分分解为氮气和氧气。这种分解产生了活性氧物种，可以与乙烷反应生成烯烃。铁改性的沸石表现出高活性，特别是具有MFI结构的沸石，对于乙烷氧化脱氢反应。催化剂矩阵的结构，包括沸石的Si/Al比率，在形成活性铁复合物中起着关键作用，并影响反应的活性和选择性。

综上所述，活性氧化催化剂通过可逆氧化还原反应来活化C-H键，而非活性氧化催化剂依赖于氧化剂如N2O来产生活性氧物种。这些催化剂在活化CO2以进行丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性根据它们促进形成活性中间体的能力以及CO2分解的能量壁垒而变化。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, utilize the redox properties of the metal oxide to activate the C-H bond. For instance, V2O5 can act as a Lewis acid and a strong oxidant, facilitating the breaking of the C-H bond. VOx/SiO2 combines the acidic properties of the SiO2 support with the redox activity of the VOx layer, enhancing the dehydrogenation efficiency. CeO2, as a redox-active material, undergoes reversible oxidation-reduction reactions that assist in the activation of C-H bonds. 

Redox-inactive catalysts, on the other hand, typically involve transition metal clusters or complexes. These catalysts often require external oxidants, such as air or oxygen, to promote the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane involves the dissociation of CO2 into CO and O atoms, which can then participate in the dehydrogenation reaction. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 varies based on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. For example, transition metal clusters might facilitate CO2 activation through the formation of reactive intermediates that can effectively break the CO2 bond. 

The literature indicates that the use of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation results in the simultaneous utilization of N2O for both ethane oxidation and N2O decomposition. The decomposition of N2O leads to the formation of oxygen species that can react with ethane, leading to the formation of olefins. The literature also highlights that the structure of iron complexes plays a crucial role in the formation of active catalysts for oxydehydrogenation reactions. Zeolites with MFI structure, specifically Fe-ZSM-5, showed high activity for ethane oxydehydrogenation, whereas other zeolites and non-zeolite supports did not exhibit similar activity. The presence of cationic centers within the zeolite matrix is indispensable for the formation of active iron complexes. Furthermore, the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite matrix and the presence of strong acidic centers affect the activity and selectivity of the oxidation reactions.

在烷烃氧化脱氢反应中，活性氧化物催化剂（如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2）利用金属氧化物的氧化还原性质激活C-H键。例如，V2O5可以作为路易斯酸和强氧化剂，有助于破坏C-H键。VOx/SiO2结合了SiO2支持的酸性特性和VOx层的氧化还原活性，提高了脱氢效率。CeO2作为具有氧化还原活性的材料，通过可逆的氧化还原反应协助激活C-H键。

非氧化还原惰性催化剂通常涉及过渡金属簇或复合物。这些催化剂往往需要外部氧化剂，如空气或氧气，来促进氧化脱氢过程。CO2的激活涉及到将CO2分解为CO和O原子，然后参与脱氢反应。不同催化剂在激活CO2方面的有效性各不相同，这取决于激活CO2的机制和能量壁垒。例如，过渡金属簇可能通过形成可以有效打破CO2键的活性中间体来促进CO2激活。

文献表明，使用N2O作为氧化剂进行乙烷氧化脱氢反应时，N2O同时用于乙烷氧化和N2O分解。N2O的分解导致形成可以与乙烷反应生成烯烃的氧物种。文献还强调了铁复合物的结构在形成活性催化剂对于氧化脱氢反应中的关键作用。MFI结构的沸石，特别是Fe-ZSM-5，显示出高活性对于乙烷氧化脱氢，而其他沸石和非沸石支持则没有类似活性。沸石矩阵内的阳离子中心对于形成活性铁复合物是必不可少的。此外，硅/铝比和沸石矩阵中的强酸中心影响氧化反应的活性和选择性。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, involve the activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane through the reduction of CO2 to CO or even C. The activation barrier for CO2 dissociation is lower in redox-active catalysts, allowing for more efficient CO2 utilization. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts do not undergo a significant reduction phase, thus not facilitating CO2 activation effectively. In the context of CO2 utilization, the redox-active catalysts offer a more promising pathway for oxidative dehydrogenation, particularly in scenarios where CO2 is the primary oxidant.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is highly dependent on their ability to reduce CO2 to CO or even C. V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters demonstrate varying degrees of CO2 reduction capability, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 being more proficient due to their intrinsic redox properties. These catalysts can facilitate the dissociation of CO2 into CO or even C, enabling the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to occur. The role of traditional oxidants, such as O2 or N2O, in this process is to provide oxygen for the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, rather than directly activating CO2. The effectiveness of these oxidants is enhanced when used in conjunction with catalysts that possess the ability to activate CO2, leading to simultaneous and effective utilization of both the alkane feedstock and the CO2 source.

不同催化剂在激活CO2以氧化脱氢丙烷的有效性依赖于它们使CO2活化的程度。V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇在激活CO2的能力上表现出不同的效果，V2O5和VOx/SiO2更为有效，因为它们具有内在的氧化还原性质。这些催化剂能够使CO2分解成CO或甚至C，从而允许进行丙烷的氧化脱氢。传统氧化剂，如O2或N2O，在此过程中充当提供氧气的氧化剂，而不是直接激活CO2。当与具有激活CO2能力的催化剂结合使用时，这些氧化剂的有效性得到增强，导致同时和有效的利用烷基原料和CO2来源。

Nitrous oxide, a waste by-product generated in many industrial processes such as adipic acid and nitric acid production, has been shown to be an excellent oxidant for performing some difficult oxidation processes. Direct benzene to phenol oxidation (BTOP) with N2O as an oxidant has been recently commercialised by SOLUTIA and it seems to be one of the cleanest and most elegant methods for phenol production [1].

In the presented study, nitrous oxide was used as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of iron modified zeolites. Our earlier experience with propane oxydehydrogenation [4] allowed us to expect an essential activity of iron modified zeolites ZSM-5 for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Considering that the O species,which was found to be involved in the oxydehydrogenation reaction [5,6] could be formed as a result of N2O decomposition on different transition oxide species, the iron oxides supported on different zeolite structures and on non-zeolite supports were also applied as catalysts for the reaction under study.

Ethane oxidation over iron modified zeolites of MFI structure resulted in ethene formation with selectivity in the range from 55% to 87% (Fig. 7). Besides ethene, the outlet gas combined COx, products of total oxidation. However, contrary to propane oxidationcarriedoutundersimilar conditions(N2O asan oxidant and Fe-ZSM-5 as catalyst), which resulted in oxygen bearing products formed with selectivity up to 30% [4], ethane oxidation did not provide any oxygenates in the range of applied temperatures (350450 8C).

The interaction of reagents (ethane and N2O) with active centres in the range of temperature from RT to 400 8C was performed in a vacuum cell and recorded by FT-IR spectra (Fig. 11). The adsorption of reagents resulted in a simultaneous decrease in the intensity of IR bands characteristic of OH groups. This indicates a participation of OH groups in reagents adsorption. Additionally, bands of the CH bond in the region of 28802973 cm1 and a very weak band at about 3040 cm1 indicating the presence of CH bond were noted. The band at 3040 cm1, which confirmed ethene formation appeared starting from300 8C.IR spectra have also showntheformationof oxygen containing species. The band at approximately 1715 cm1,which can be ascribed to a carbonyl group present in aldehyde [23], appeared already at 300 8C and its intensity rose up with heating to 400 8C. 

Nitrous oxide introduced into the reaction medium was partly utilized for ethane oxidation and it was also directly decomposed to N2 and O2 over iron modified catalysts. The activity for N2O decomposition of iron modified zeolites was reported earlier [12] and it has been found that concentration of iron cations affects the rate constant significantly. In the presented study the conversion of N2O depended on the amount of iron in the zeolite matrix and also on the kind of matrix (Fig. 12) applied to iron complexes accommodation. The highest activity for N2O decomposition showed iron modified ZSM-5 zeolites, while the activity of faujasite and mordenite modified with iron cations was lower when compared to Fe-ZSM-5 with a similar amount of iron.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, facilitate the activation of CO2 through a series of chemical reactions that involve the reduction of CO2 to form CO, which then reacts with the alkane. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are lower on these catalysts, allowing for more efficient activation. For instance, V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are known for their ability to reduce CO2 effectively, whereas CeO2 and transition metal clusters can also act as catalysts for CO2 reduction, albeit with different mechanisms.

Redox-inactive catalysts, on the other hand, typically rely on traditional oxidants like O2 or N2O for C-H bond activation. N2O, in particular, has been shown to be an excellent oxidant for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, facilitating the formation of ethene with high selectivity. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on their ability to promote the reduction of CO2, which is a critical step in the process. For example, iron modified zeolites, specifically those of the MFI structure, show high activity in ethane oxydehydrogenation in the presence of N2O, indicating that the structure of the catalyst plays a significant role in the formation of active iron complexes.

In the context of CO2 activation, the role of traditional oxidants like O2 and N2O is to provide the necessary oxidation state changes that allow for the breaking of C-O bonds and the formation of reactive intermediates. For instance, N2O can directly decompose to N2 and O2, which can then participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation process, facilitating the conversion of alkanes to olefins and oxygen-containing compounds.

The effectiveness of catalyst regeneration in these processes is often tied to the ability of the catalyst to maintain its activity over multiple reaction cycles. For redox-active catalysts, regeneration might involve oxidation steps to return the catalyst to its original state, whereas for redox-inactive catalysts, regeneration might require external treatments or conditions to restore the catalyst's functionality, such as heat treatment or re-exposure to the reactants.

在氧化脱氢化烷烃的过程中，活性氧还原和非活性氧还原催化剂之间的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制有所不同。活性氧还原催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇，通过一系列化学反应促进CO2的活化，涉及将CO2还原形成CO，然后与烷烃反应。这些催化剂中CO2分解的能量壁垒较低，因此能更有效地活化。例如，V2O5和VOx/SiO2因其有效降低CO2的能力而知名，而CeO2和过渡金属簇也可以作为CO2减少的催化剂，尽管机制不同。

非活性氧还原催化剂通常依赖传统的氧化剂，如O2或N2O，进行C-H键活化。N2O特别适用于乙烷的氧化脱氢化，促进乙烯的高选择性形成。不同的催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢化过程中激活CO2的有效性取决于它们促进CO2还原的能力，这是过程中的关键步骤。例如，MFI结构的铁改性沸石显示出在N2O存在下乙烷氧化脱氢化的高活性，表明催化剂的结构对形成活性铁复合物具有重要作用。

在CO2激活的背景下，传统氧化剂（如O2和N2O）的作用是提供必要的氧化状态变化，以允许C-O键断裂和形成活性中间体。例如，N2O可以直接分解为N2和O2，这些可以参与氧化脱氢化过程，促进烷烃转化为烯烃和含氧化合物。

这些过程中的催化剂再生效果通常与催化剂保持活动性的能力有关。对于活性氧还原催化剂，再生可能涉及氧化步骤将催化剂恢复到原始状态，而对于非活性氧还原催化剂，再生可能需要外部处理或条件来恢复催化剂的功能性，如热处理或重新暴露于反应物。
