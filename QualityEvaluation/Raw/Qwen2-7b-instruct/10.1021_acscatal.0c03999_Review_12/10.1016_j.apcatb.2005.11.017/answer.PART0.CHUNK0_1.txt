[1] "Nitrous oxide, a waste by-product generated in many industrial processes such as adipic acid and nitric acid production, has been shown to be an excellent oxidant for performing some difficult oxidation processes."
[2] "Direct benzene to phenol oxidation (BTOP) with N2O as an oxidant has been recently commercialised by SOLUTIA and it seems to be one of the cleanest and most elegant methods for phenol production."
[3] "The generation of a- oxygen, which was believed to insert itself into a CH bond and to form hydroxy group connected to hydrocarbons [2] seemed very promising for light paraffins hydroxylation."
[4] "Considering that the O species,which was found to be involved in the oxydehydrogenation reaction [5,6] could be formed as a result of N2O decomposition on different transition oxide species, the iron oxides supported on different zeolite structures and on non-zeolite supports were also applied as catalysts for the reaction under study."
[5] "The decomposition of N2O led to the formation of different oxygen species. Some of them may recombine (Eq. (3)) or react with a subsequent N2O molecule (Eq. (2)) forming O2 molecules almost inactive for ODH reaction performed in the presence of iron modified zeolites."
[6] "The activity for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation was measured in a continuous flow reactor at a temperature of 400 °C usually for 4 h, using N2O as an oxidant."
[7] "The interaction of reagents (ethane and N2O) with active centres in the range of temperature from RT to 400 °C was performed in a vacuum cell and recorded by FT-IR spectra."
[8] "Nitrous oxide introduced into the reaction medium was partly utilized for ethane oxidation and it was also directly decomposed to N2 and O2 over iron modified catalysts."
[9] "On the other hand, as we have shown in this paper, iron species active for ethane ODH reaction may be formed not only in the channels of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites but also in other zeolite structures (faujasite, mordenite), while benzene to phenol hydroxylation in the presence of N2O occurs only over iron species accommodated in the MFI structure."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2, utilize the redox properties of the metal oxide to activate the C-H bond. For instance, V2O5 can act as a Lewis acid and a strong oxidant, facilitating the breaking of the C-H bond. VOx/SiO2 combines the acidic properties of the SiO2 support with the redox activity of the VOx layer, enhancing the dehydrogenation efficiency. CeO2, as a redox-active material, undergoes reversible oxidation-reduction reactions that assist in the activation of C-H bonds. 

Redox-inactive catalysts, on the other hand, typically involve transition metal clusters or complexes. These catalysts often require external oxidants, such as air or oxygen, to promote the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane involves the dissociation of CO2 into CO and O atoms, which can then participate in the dehydrogenation reaction. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 varies based on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. For example, transition metal clusters might facilitate CO2 activation through the formation of reactive intermediates that can effectively break the CO2 bond. 

The literature indicates that the use of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation results in the simultaneous utilization of N2O for both ethane oxidation and N2O decomposition. The decomposition of N2O leads to the formation of oxygen species that can react with ethane, leading to the formation of olefins. The literature also highlights that the structure of iron complexes plays a crucial role in the formation of active catalysts for oxydehydrogenation reactions. Zeolites with MFI structure, specifically Fe-ZSM-5, showed high activity for ethane oxydehydrogenation, whereas other zeolites and non-zeolite supports did not exhibit similar activity. The presence of cationic centers within the zeolite matrix is indispensable for the formation of active iron complexes. Furthermore, the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite matrix and the presence of strong acidic centers affect the activity and selectivity of the oxidation reactions.

在烷烃氧化脱氢反应中，活性氧化物催化剂（如V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2）利用金属氧化物的氧化还原性质激活C-H键。例如，V2O5可以作为路易斯酸和强氧化剂，有助于破坏C-H键。VOx/SiO2结合了SiO2支持的酸性特性和VOx层的氧化还原活性，提高了脱氢效率。CeO2作为具有氧化还原活性的材料，通过可逆的氧化还原反应协助激活C-H键。

非氧化还原惰性催化剂通常涉及过渡金属簇或复合物。这些催化剂往往需要外部氧化剂，如空气或氧气，来促进氧化脱氢过程。CO2的激活涉及到将CO2分解为CO和O原子，然后参与脱氢反应。不同催化剂在激活CO2方面的有效性各不相同，这取决于激活CO2的机制和能量壁垒。例如，过渡金属簇可能通过形成可以有效打破CO2键的活性中间体来促进CO2激活。

文献表明，使用N2O作为氧化剂进行乙烷氧化脱氢反应时，N2O同时用于乙烷氧化和N2O分解。N2O的分解导致形成可以与乙烷反应生成烯烃的氧物种。文献还强调了铁复合物的结构在形成活性催化剂对于氧化脱氢反应中的关键作用。MFI结构的沸石，特别是Fe-ZSM-5，显示出高活性对于乙烷氧化脱氢，而其他沸石和非沸石支持则没有类似活性。沸石矩阵内的阳离子中心对于形成活性铁复合物是必不可少的。此外，硅/铝比和沸石矩阵中的强酸中心影响氧化反应的活性和选择性。
