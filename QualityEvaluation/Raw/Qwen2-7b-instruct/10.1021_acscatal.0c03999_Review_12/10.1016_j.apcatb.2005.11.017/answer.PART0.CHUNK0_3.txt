Nitrous oxide, a waste by-product generated in many industrial processes such as adipic acid and nitric acid production, has been shown to be an excellent oxidant for performing some difficult oxidation processes. Direct benzene to phenol oxidation (BTOP) with N2O as an oxidant has been recently commercialised by SOLUTIA and it seems to be one of the cleanest and most elegant methods for phenol production [1].

In the presented study, nitrous oxide was used as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of iron modified zeolites. Our earlier experience with propane oxydehydrogenation [4] allowed us to expect an essential activity of iron modified zeolites ZSM-5 for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Considering that the O species,which was found to be involved in the oxydehydrogenation reaction [5,6] could be formed as a result of N2O decomposition on different transition oxide species, the iron oxides supported on different zeolite structures and on non-zeolite supports were also applied as catalysts for the reaction under study.

Ethane oxidation over iron modified zeolites of MFI structure resulted in ethene formation with selectivity in the range from 55% to 87% (Fig. 7). Besides ethene, the outlet gas combined COx, products of total oxidation. However, contrary to propane oxidationcarriedoutundersimilar conditions(N2O asan oxidant and Fe-ZSM-5 as catalyst), which resulted in oxygen bearing products formed with selectivity up to 30% [4], ethane oxidation did not provide any oxygenates in the range of applied temperatures (350450 8C).

The interaction of reagents (ethane and N2O) with active centres in the range of temperature from RT to 400 8C was performed in a vacuum cell and recorded by FT-IR spectra (Fig. 11). The adsorption of reagents resulted in a simultaneous decrease in the intensity of IR bands characteristic of OH groups. This indicates a participation of OH groups in reagents adsorption. Additionally, bands of the CH bond in the region of 28802973 cm1 and a very weak band at about 3040 cm1 indicating the presence of CH bond were noted. The band at 3040 cm1, which confirmed ethene formation appeared starting from300 8C.IR spectra have also showntheformationof oxygen containing species. The band at approximately 1715 cm1,which can be ascribed to a carbonyl group present in aldehyde [23], appeared already at 300 8C and its intensity rose up with heating to 400 8C. 

Nitrous oxide introduced into the reaction medium was partly utilized for ethane oxidation and it was also directly decomposed to N2 and O2 over iron modified catalysts. The activity for N2O decomposition of iron modified zeolites was reported earlier [12] and it has been found that concentration of iron cations affects the rate constant significantly. In the presented study the conversion of N2O depended on the amount of iron in the zeolite matrix and also on the kind of matrix (Fig. 12) applied to iron complexes accommodation. The highest activity for N2O decomposition showed iron modified ZSM-5 zeolites, while the activity of faujasite and mordenite modified with iron cations was lower when compared to Fe-ZSM-5 with a similar amount of iron.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, facilitate the activation of CO2 through a series of chemical reactions that involve the reduction of CO2 to form CO, which then reacts with the alkane. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are lower on these catalysts, allowing for more efficient activation. For instance, V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are known for their ability to reduce CO2 effectively, whereas CeO2 and transition metal clusters can also act as catalysts for CO2 reduction, albeit with different mechanisms.

Redox-inactive catalysts, on the other hand, typically rely on traditional oxidants like O2 or N2O for C-H bond activation. N2O, in particular, has been shown to be an excellent oxidant for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, facilitating the formation of ethene with high selectivity. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on their ability to promote the reduction of CO2, which is a critical step in the process. For example, iron modified zeolites, specifically those of the MFI structure, show high activity in ethane oxydehydrogenation in the presence of N2O, indicating that the structure of the catalyst plays a significant role in the formation of active iron complexes.

In the context of CO2 activation, the role of traditional oxidants like O2 and N2O is to provide the necessary oxidation state changes that allow for the breaking of C-O bonds and the formation of reactive intermediates. For instance, N2O can directly decompose to N2 and O2, which can then participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation process, facilitating the conversion of alkanes to olefins and oxygen-containing compounds.

The effectiveness of catalyst regeneration in these processes is often tied to the ability of the catalyst to maintain its activity over multiple reaction cycles. For redox-active catalysts, regeneration might involve oxidation steps to return the catalyst to its original state, whereas for redox-inactive catalysts, regeneration might require external treatments or conditions to restore the catalyst's functionality, such as heat treatment or re-exposure to the reactants.

在氧化脱氢化烷烃的过程中，活性氧还原和非活性氧还原催化剂之间的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制有所不同。活性氧还原催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇，通过一系列化学反应促进CO2的活化，涉及将CO2还原形成CO，然后与烷烃反应。这些催化剂中CO2分解的能量壁垒较低，因此能更有效地活化。例如，V2O5和VOx/SiO2因其有效降低CO2的能力而知名，而CeO2和过渡金属簇也可以作为CO2减少的催化剂，尽管机制不同。

非活性氧还原催化剂通常依赖传统的氧化剂，如O2或N2O，进行C-H键活化。N2O特别适用于乙烷的氧化脱氢化，促进乙烯的高选择性形成。不同的催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢化过程中激活CO2的有效性取决于它们促进CO2还原的能力，这是过程中的关键步骤。例如，MFI结构的铁改性沸石显示出在N2O存在下乙烷氧化脱氢化的高活性，表明催化剂的结构对形成活性铁复合物具有重要作用。

在CO2激活的背景下，传统氧化剂（如O2和N2O）的作用是提供必要的氧化状态变化，以允许C-O键断裂和形成活性中间体。例如，N2O可以直接分解为N2和O2，这些可以参与氧化脱氢化过程，促进烷烃转化为烯烃和含氧化合物。

这些过程中的催化剂再生效果通常与催化剂保持活动性的能力有关。对于活性氧还原催化剂，再生可能涉及氧化步骤将催化剂恢复到原始状态，而对于非活性氧还原催化剂，再生可能需要外部处理或条件来恢复催化剂的功能性，如热处理或重新暴露于反应物。
