Nitrous oxide, a waste by-product generated in many industrial processes such as adipic acid and nitric acid production, has been shown to be an excellent oxidant for performing some difficult oxidation processes. Direct benzene to phenol oxidation (BTOP) with N2O as an oxidant has been recently commercialised by SOLUTIA and it seems to be one of the cleanest and most elegant methods for phenol production [1].

The decomposition of N2O led to the formation of different oxygen species. Some of them may recombine (Eq. (3)) or react with a subsequent N2O molecule (Eq. (2)) forming O2 molecules almost inactive for ODH reaction performed in the presence of iron modified zeolites. Only a portion of active oxygen species is enable to react with ethane according to Eq. (4).

The number of iron ions introduced into the zeolites ZSM-5 matrix was affected by the Si/Al ratio and it was found to be equal to 1.4, 0.4 and 0.09 wt.% of Fe for Si/Al ratio 25, 50 and 100, respectively (Table 1). The activities for N2O decom- position and ethane ODH reaction recorded in our measure- ments changed parallel to the iron species concentration

Regarding the above, both the number of iron species and their structure (isolated or oligomeric complexes) should influence the catalyst activity.

The important role of cationic centres in the mechanism of the formation of a-iron complexes active for the BTOP process has been stressed by Panov et al. [14] and by other authors [15].

The presence of exchangeable cationic centres in the matrix accommodating iron complexes has a crucial role in the formation of iron species active for ODH reaction. Only iron species accom- modated in zeolite channels (ZSM-5, mordenite) or cages (faujasite) (Fig. 2) showed activity for the oxydehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of N2O as an oxidant. 

The Si/Al ratio also affects zeolite acidity. It is commonly accepted that the number and strength of acidic centres affects both the activity and selectivity of oxidation reactions.

Despite the significantly various iron capacity in ZSM-5 zeolites of an Si/Al ratio 25 and 50 (1.4 and 0.4 wt.% of iron,respectively) the ethane conversion over the samples was very similar.

High TOF for the samples with very low iron contents suggests that isolated iron species play an important role for the reaction under study.

UVvis spectra were recorded for unmodified, as well as for iron modified samples calcined at 600 and 900 8C (Fig. 9A and B). The bands recorded at about 215 and 260 nm are due to the presence of iron species and they are almost invisible in the spectrum of an unmodified sample.

The activity of the samples under study for N2O decomposition increased with iron concentration (Fig. 1). Simultaneously, with the growth of iron concentration, the intensity of UVvis bands recorded at 350 and 440 nm also increased (Fig. 9B).

Ethane oxidation over iron modified zeolites of MFI structure resulted in ethene formation with selectivity in the range from 55% to 87% (Fig. 7). 

The use of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation results in simultaneous, effective N2O utilization.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, are capable of undergoing reversible redox reactions. This allows them to activate C-H bonds through the formation of reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl (OH) and alkoxyl (RO) intermediates. The activation process often involves the adsorption of alkanes onto the catalyst surface followed by the formation of these reactive intermediates via interactions with oxygen-containing species on the catalyst surface.

Redox-inactive catalysts, on the other hand, do not undergo reversible redox reactions. Instead, they rely on the presence of oxygen or other oxidants to activate C-H bonds. For instance, in the case of N2O, it acts as an oxidant to generate oxygen species that can then participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. Catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2 can potentially facilitate CO2 activation by promoting the formation of reactive oxygen species, whereas transition metal clusters might offer unique geometries that aid in CO2 activation.

In the context of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation, the use of N2O leads to its effective utilization, with some portion being decomposed to nitrogen and oxygen. This decomposition generates active oxygen species that can react with ethane to produce olefins. The presence of iron modified zeolites facilitates this process, particularly those with the MFI structure, showing high activity for ethane oxydehydrogenation. The structure of the catalyst matrix, including the zeolite's Si/Al ratio, plays a crucial role in the formation of active iron complexes and influences the activity and selectivity of the reaction.

In summary, redox-active catalysts utilize reversible redox reactions to activate C-H bonds, while redox-inactive catalysts rely on the presence of oxidants like N2O to generate reactive oxygen species. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies based on their ability to promote the formation of reactive intermediates and the energy barriers associated with CO2 dissociation.

在烷烃氧化脱氢过程中，活性氧化剂和非活性氧化剂金属氧化物催化剂之间的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在显著差异。活性氧化催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇，能够进行可逆的氧化还原反应。这允许它们通过形成如羟基（OH）和烷氧基（RO）中间体来活化C-H键。活化过程通常涉及将烷烃吸附到催化剂表面，并通过与催化剂表面上的氧含物种的相互作用形成这些活性中间体。

相比之下，非活性氧化催化剂不会进行可逆氧化还原反应。相反，它们依赖于氧气或其他氧化剂的存在来活化C-H键。例如，在使用N2O作为氧化剂的情况下，它可以生成活性氧物种，然后参与氧化脱氢过程。不同催化剂在CO2活化以进行丙烷氧化脱氢中的有效性取决于CO2分解提出的机制和能量壁垒。V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2等催化剂可能通过促进活性氧物种的形成来促进CO2活化，而过渡金属簇可能提供有助于CO2活化的独特几何形状。

在使用N2O作为乙烷氧化脱氢氧化剂的背景下，N2O的使用导致其有效利用，部分分解为氮气和氧气。这种分解产生了活性氧物种，可以与乙烷反应生成烯烃。铁改性的沸石表现出高活性，特别是具有MFI结构的沸石，对于乙烷氧化脱氢反应。催化剂矩阵的结构，包括沸石的Si/Al比率，在形成活性铁复合物中起着关键作用，并影响反应的活性和选择性。

综上所述，活性氧化催化剂通过可逆氧化还原反应来活化C-H键，而非活性氧化催化剂依赖于氧化剂如N2O来产生活性氧物种。这些催化剂在活化CO2以进行丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性根据它们促进形成活性中间体的能力以及CO2分解的能量壁垒而变化。
