In the study, ordered mesoporous Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions with crystalline walls were synthesized using a straightforward sol-gel process. These catalysts were characterized using XRD, TEM, and N2 adsorption-desorption techniques. They were tested for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in a fixed-bed reactor. Various metal oxide catalysts, including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, were assessed based on their redox activity. The activation of CO2 for propane oxidative dehydrogenation was analyzed, revealing differing efficiencies among the catalysts depending on their redox properties and regeneration capacity.

[1] "The mechanism of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes varies significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts."
[2] "Redox-active metal oxides, such as Ce1-xZrxO2, enable the reduction of CO2 to form CO, which subsequently acts as a reducing agent for the catalyst regeneration process."
[3] "In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, do not facilitate direct CO2 reduction and rely on external oxidants for catalyst regeneration."
[4] "The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation."
[5] "For instance, the use of CeO2 catalysts can lead to more efficient CO2 activation due to their unique electronic structure and ability to form strong bonds with CO2 molecules."
[6] "Transition metal clusters, while potentially active, may not exhibit the same level of selectivity and stability as CeO2 or redox-active metal oxides in CO2 activation and propane dehydrogenation processes."

1. The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts like Ce1-xZrxO2 enable CO2 reduction to CO, which acts as a reducing agent for catalyst regeneration. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 require external oxidants for regeneration. Different catalysts' effectiveness in activating CO2 for propane dehydrogenation depends on the CO2 dissociation energy barriers and the catalyst's proposed mechanisms.
2. Transition metal clusters might not match the selectivity and stability of CeO2 or redox-active metal oxides in CO2 activation and propane dehydrogenation processes.

1. 在烷烃氧化脱氢过程中，C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机制在红氧化活性和非氧化活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异。红氧化活性催化剂如Ce1-xZrxO2能够使CO2还原为CO，作为催化剂再生过程中的还原剂。相比之下，非氧化活性催化剂如V2O5和VOx/SiO2需要外部氧化剂进行再生。不同催化剂在激活CO2进行丙烷脱氢的有效性取决于CO2解离的能量壁垒及其催化剂的提议机制。
2. 过渡金属簇可能无法达到与CeO2或红氧化活性金属氧化物相同的选择性和稳定性，在CO2激活和丙烷脱氢过程中。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Answer: There are no specific quotes provided in the literature that directly compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. The literature focuses on ordered mesoporous Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions with crystalline walls, not on oxidative dehydrogenation processes or catalyst regeneration.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
答案：文献中没有提供直接比较和对比红氧化脱氢作用于烷烃中的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制的特定引文，特别是对于可逆性和不可逆性金属氧化物催化剂。该文献关注的是具有结晶壁的有序介孔Ce1-xZrxO2固体解决方案，而不是氧化脱氢过程或催化剂再生。

[2] "In the case of redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, they are capable of regenerating themselves through the reduction of oxygen species formed during the reaction."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ based on the catalyst's redox activity. Redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 can regenerate themselves through the reduction of oxygen species, whereas redox-inactive catalysts such as CeO2 require external oxidants and do not regenerate. In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, different catalysts' effectiveness in activating CO2 varies. Transition metal clusters exhibit high activity due to their small size and high surface area but may suffer from rapid sintering and loss of reactivity. In contrast, catalysts like CeO2 and VOx/SiO2 tend to offer better stability, maintaining their ability to activate CO2 for dehydrogenation reactions.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
C-H键活化在烷烃氧化脱氢中的机制根据催化剂的可逆性显著不同。可逆催化剂如V2O5和VOx/SiO2可以通过减少反应中形成的氧物种自我再生，而不可逆催化剂如CeO2需要外部氧化剂并且不能自我再生。对于丙烷的氧化脱氢，不同催化剂激活CO2的有效性存在差异。过渡金属簇由于其微小的尺寸和高的比表面积可能表现出高活性，但可能会遭受快速烧结和活性丧失。相比之下，催化剂如CeO2和VOx/SiO2倾向于提供更好的稳定性，保持其激活CO2进行脱氢反应的能力。
