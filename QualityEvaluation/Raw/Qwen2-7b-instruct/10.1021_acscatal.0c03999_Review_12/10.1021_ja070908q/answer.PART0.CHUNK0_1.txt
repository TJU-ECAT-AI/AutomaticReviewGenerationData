[1] "The mechanism of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes varies significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts."
[2] "Redox-active metal oxides, such as Ce1-xZrxO2, enable the reduction of CO2 to form CO, which subsequently acts as a reducing agent for the catalyst regeneration process."

1. The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts like Ce1-xZrxO2 enable CO2 reduction to CO, which acts as a reducing agent for catalyst regeneration. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 require external oxidants for regeneration. Different catalysts' effectiveness in activating CO2 for propane dehydrogenation depends on the CO2 dissociation energy barriers and the catalyst's proposed mechanisms.
2. Transition metal clusters might not match the selectivity and stability of CeO2 or redox-active metal oxides in CO2 activation and propane dehydrogenation processes.

1. 在烷烃氧化脱氢过程中，C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机制在红氧化活性和非氧化活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异。红氧化活性催化剂如Ce1-xZrxO2能够使CO2还原为CO，作为催化剂再生过程中的还原剂。相比之下，非氧化活性催化剂如V2O5和VOx/SiO2需要外部氧化剂进行再生。不同催化剂在激活CO2进行丙烷脱氢的有效性取决于CO2解离的能量壁垒及其催化剂的提议机制。
2. 过渡金属簇可能无法达到与CeO2或红氧化活性金属氧化物相同的选择性和稳定性，在CO2激活和丙烷脱氢过程中。
