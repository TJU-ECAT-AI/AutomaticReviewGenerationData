In the study, ordered mesoporous Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions with crystalline walls were synthesized using a straightforward sol-gel process. These catalysts were characterized using XRD, TEM, and N2 adsorption-desorption techniques. They were tested for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in a fixed-bed reactor. Various metal oxide catalysts, including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, were assessed based on their redox activity. The activation of CO2 for propane oxidative dehydrogenation was analyzed, revealing differing efficiencies among the catalysts depending on their redox properties and regeneration capacity.
