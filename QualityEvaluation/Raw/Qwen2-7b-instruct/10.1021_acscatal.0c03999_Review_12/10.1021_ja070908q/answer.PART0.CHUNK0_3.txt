The mechanisms of C-H bond activation in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ based on the catalyst's redox activity. Redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 can regenerate themselves through the reduction of oxygen species, whereas redox-inactive catalysts such as CeO2 require external oxidants and do not regenerate. In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, different catalysts' effectiveness in activating CO2 varies. Transition metal clusters exhibit high activity due to their small size and high surface area but may suffer from rapid sintering and loss of reactivity. In contrast, catalysts like CeO2 and VOx/SiO2 tend to offer better stability, maintaining their ability to activate CO2 for dehydrogenation reactions.

C-H键活化在烷烃氧化脱氢中的机制根据催化剂的可逆性显著不同。可逆催化剂如V2O5和VOx/SiO2可以通过减少反应中形成的氧物种自我再生，而不可逆催化剂如CeO2需要外部氧化剂并且不能自我再生。对于丙烷的氧化脱氢，不同催化剂激活CO2的有效性存在差异。过渡金属簇由于其微小的尺寸和高的比表面积可能表现出高活性，但可能会遭受快速烧结和活性丧失。相比之下，催化剂如CeO2和VOx/SiO2倾向于提供更好的稳定性，保持其激活CO2进行脱氢反应的能力。
