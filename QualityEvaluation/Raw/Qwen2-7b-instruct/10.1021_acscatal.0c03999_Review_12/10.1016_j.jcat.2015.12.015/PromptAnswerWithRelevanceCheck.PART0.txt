<quotes>
[1] "Vanadium oxide is considered to be one of the most important compounds in metal oxide catalysis [69]."
[2] "Improvement in this yield is possible with the addition of WOx."
[3] "CO2 can act as a mild oxidant. Unlike oxygen, CO2 will not be able to fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity."
[4] "It is generally accepted that it follows a proposed pathway which is in agreement with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism [39]."
[5] "The presence of bulk V2O5 on the other hand decreases the selectivity and favors total oxidation."
[6] "Moreover, because of its high heat capacity,using CO2 as a co-feed can alleviate the effects of the exothermal ODP reaction, avoiding hot spots that can lead to cracking of the alkane [21]."
[7] "Carbon dioxide can eliminate the hydrogen produced by non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by the RWGS. Coupling of the reverse water gas shift reaction with DH therefore improves the equilibrium conversion in these DH reactions toward propylene production [19,21]."
[8] "In the presence of CO2 with a molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 = 1, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be 50 C lower than that of simple dehy- drogenation to achieve 60% conversion of propane at 650 C."
[9] "When using chromium or vanadium oxide based catalysts, CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides."
[10] "Extrinsic relaxation 3
C3H8  10V5 ! 3CO2  4H2O  10V3"
[11] "This can be attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 into V2O4 instead of V2O5."
[12] "Water formation passed through a maximum and then completely disappeared after 80 s (Fig. 8d)."
[13] "The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst after reaction with a mixture of CO2 and C3H8 at the different reaction times depicted in Fig. 9(b) is three times less than that which is deposited after reaction with only C3H8 for the same time on stream."
[14] "Interestingly enough, the oxygen abstraction from CO2, which regenerates the vanadyl oxygen of the active site, is a spontaneous process (DGr 600C = 74 kJ/mol)."
[15] "The first step of the non-oxidative dehy- drogenation (DH) of propane was considered to be the same as in the ODH cycle."
[16] "The RWGS cycle seems to be limited by its fourth elementary step, namely hydrogen migration from the vanadium site to the vicinal bridge oxygen ( = 189 kJ/mol, Eact = 185 kJ/mol)."

### Comparison of Mechanisms

1. Redox-active metal oxides, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, are capable of undergoing oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, where the C-H bonds are activated via redox processes. This involves the reduction of the metal oxide to a lower oxidation state, followed by hydrogen abstraction and the subsequent desorption of the desired alkene product. The reoxidation step regenerates the active site for further reactions.

2. Redox-inactive metal oxides, like CeO2, do not undergo redox reactions during the dehydrogenation process. Instead, they might promote dehydrogenation through surface effects, such as providing a suitable surface for alkane adsorption and alkene desorption, without directly participating in redox chemistry.

3. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant in the context of oxidative dehydrogenation. It is unable to fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity. CO2 can facilitate the dehydrogenation process by eliminating hydrogen produced through non-oxidative dehydrogenation routes, particularly through the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.

4. Transition metal clusters, if used as catalysts, might exhibit different mechanisms depending on their composition and structure. For instance, they could activate CO2 by forming reactive oxygen species that aid in the dehydrogenation process, potentially leading to a combination of oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation routes.

5. Different catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, can effectively activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The effectiveness is influenced by the specific catalytic properties, such as the ability to form reactive intermediates, surface area, and the presence of active sites that can participate in redox chemistry or surface effects.

6. CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation involves a parallel-consecutive reaction scheme where propane can undergo direct oxidative dehydrogenation or non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by a reverse water gas shift. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and the regeneration of the active site play crucial roles in determining the efficiency of the process.

### Effectiveness of Different Catalysts

1. V2O5 catalysts can undergo oxidative dehydrogenation, but the presence of bulk V2O5 decreases the selectivity towards the desired alkene product and favors total oxidation. WOx addition to V2O5 can hinder the clustering of VOx species, improving selectivity.

2. VOx/SiO2 catalysts benefit from the dispersion of VOx species facilitated by WOx, which retains VOx in a dispersed state, reducing the likelihood of non-selective oxygen formation and total oxidation of propane.

3. CeO2 catalysts, being redox-inactive, may not directly participate in redox reactions but can still contribute to the dehydrogenation process through surface effects.

4. Transition metal clusters can activate CO2 through the formation of reactive intermediates, enabling a combination of oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation routes, potentially leading to enhanced selectivity and efficiency.

### Role of CO2

1. CO2 can act as a mild oxidant, facilitating oxidative dehydrogenation by eliminating hydrogen produced through non-oxidative routes and potentially participating in the RWGS reaction to improve the equilibrium conversion towards propylene.

2. In the presence of CO2, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be lowered, allowing for higher conversion of propane at lower temperatures compared to simple dehydrogenation.

3. CO2 re-oxidizes partially reduced metal oxides to V2O4 instead of V2O5, reducing the likelihood of total oxidation and favoring the selective production of alkene products.

### Energy Barriers and Catalytic Cycles

1. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is a rate-limiting step in both direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift. This step involves the abstraction of hydrogen from the secondary bond.

2. The regeneration of the active site involves different pathways, including the reoxidation of metal oxides with CO2 and the elimination of hydrogen through the RWGS reaction. The energy barriers associated with these steps influence the overall efficiency of the catalytic cycle.

### Conclusions

1. WOx addition to metal oxides, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, enhances the dehydrogenation process by preventing the clustering of VOx species and reducing the likelihood of non-selective oxygen formation.

2. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, facilitating oxidative dehydrogenation by eliminating hydrogen produced through non-oxidative routes and potentially participating in the RWGS reaction to improve the equilibrium conversion towards propylene.

3. Different catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, can effectively activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with the effectiveness influenced by factors such as the ability to form reactive intermediates, surface area, and the presence of active sites that can participate in redox chemistry or surface effects.

4. The presence of WOx has a significant impact on the catalyst itself and the conversion reaction of propane to propylene by acting as a physical barrier between VOx species, hindering the formation of non-selective oxygen and thus reducing the probability of CO2 formation and total oxidation of propane.

### Mechanisms and Energy Barriers

1. In the presence of CO2, propane dehydrogenation can proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation or non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift, with the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane being a rate-limiting step in both pathways.

2. CO2 re-oxidizes partially reduced metal oxides to V2O4, indicating that CO2 can only partially oxidize the catalyst, which aids in maintaining the selectivity towards alkene products.

### Effectiveness of Different Catalysts in Activating CO2

1. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by their ability to form reactive intermediates, surface area, and the presence of active sites that can participate in redox chemistry or surface effects.

### Role of CO2 in the Reaction

1. CO2 facilitates oxidative dehydrogenation by eliminating hydrogen produced through non-oxidative routes and potentially participating in the RWGS reaction to improve the equilibrium conversion towards propylene production.

### Energy Barriers and Catalytic Cycles

1. The energy barriers associated with CO2 dissociation and the regeneration of the active site influence the overall efficiency of the catalytic cycle, with the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane being a critical step in both direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift.

### Conclusions

1. WOx addition to metal oxides enhances the dehydrogenation process by preventing the clustering of VOx species and reducing the likelihood of non-selective oxygen formation, thus improving the selectivity towards alkene products.

2. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, facilitating oxidative dehydrogenation by eliminating hydrogen produced through non-oxidative routes and potentially participating in the RWGS reaction to improve the equilibrium conversion towards propylene.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Comparing oxidative dehydrogenation mechanisms for redox-active metal oxide catalysts (like V2O5) and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts (such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters), traditional oxidants like oxygen play a crucial role in the redox reactions. They enable the conversion of metal oxides to their reduced forms, facilitating C-H bond cleavage. For redox-active catalysts, oxygen can fully oxidize the catalyst to V2O5 state, enabling complete oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, CO2, as a traditional oxidant, cannot fully re-oxidize the catalyst back to its original state, as it only oxidizes to V2O4. 

For redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2, CO2 can still aid in dehydrogenation processes. It acts as a mild oxidant, which is insufficient to fully oxidize the catalyst but can facilitate partial oxidation and thus contribute to the dehydrogenation of alkanes. Transition metal clusters also show potential in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation, although the specifics depend on the cluster composition and structure.

The role of CO2 in dehydrogenation over WOxVOx/SiO2 catalysts is significant. It oxidizes V2O3 to V2O4, participating in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. CO2 also suppresses surface carbon formation, enhancing selectivity towards propylene. DFT calculations confirm that propane dehydrogenation in CO2 presence can occur through both direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is identified as the rate-limiting step in this process.

对比红氧化还活性金属氧化物催化剂（如V2O5）和非红氧化还活性金属氧化物催化剂（如CeO2和过渡金属簇），传统氧化剂如氧气在还原反应中起着关键作用。它们能促使金属氧化物转化为还原状态，从而实现烷烃的氧化脱氢。对于红氧化还活性催化剂，氧气可以完全将催化剂氧化为V2O5状态，从而实现烷烃的完整氧化脱氢。然而，作为传统氧化剂的CO2无法完全将催化剂恢复到原始状态，因为它只能将其氧化为V2O4。

对于非红氧化还活性催化剂如CeO2，CO2仍可帮助脱氢过程。它作为温和的氧化剂，虽然不足以完全氧化催化剂，但仍能促进部分氧化，从而有助于烷烃的脱氢。过渡金属簇也显示出激活CO2进行氧化脱氢的潜力，但具体取决于簇的组成和结构。

在WOxVOx/SiO2催化剂上，CO2的作用非常重要。它能够氧化V2O3至V2O4，参与丙烷的氧化脱氢至丙烯。CO2还能抑制表面碳的形成，提高丙烯的选择性。根据DFT计算，烷烃在CO2存在下的脱氢过程可以通过直接氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢后接着逆水煤气变换反应同时发生。丙烷的二级CAH键的活化被确认为该过程的限速步骤。
