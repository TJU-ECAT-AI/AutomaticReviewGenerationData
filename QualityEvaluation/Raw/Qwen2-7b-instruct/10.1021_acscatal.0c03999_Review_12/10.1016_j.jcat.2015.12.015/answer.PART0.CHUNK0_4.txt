[2] "A series of WOxVOx catalysts supported on porous silica, with W/V molar ratios between 0 and 0.6, are examined for propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2 from 500 C to 600 C and at atmospheric pressure."
[3] "When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O."
[4] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."
[5] "According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."
[6] "The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency but higher selectivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6."
[7] "The apparent activation energies for the catalysts were calculated using Arrhenius plots. These data were obtained from experiments performed at a temperature interval of 500 C to 600 C."
[8] "Based on the experimental results of CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation indicating the presence of isolated and partially reduced vanadia species under reaction conditions, a cubic silsesquioxane cluster [62] with an iso- lated V5+OV3+ unit is used to model the active site, as shown in Fig. 11."

1. The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane is to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
2. The catalysts used are supported on porous silica with W/V molar ratios between 0 and 0.6.
3. When D2 is present in the feed with C3H8 and CO2, only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O, confirming the oxidative dehydrogenation route.
4. CO2 helps suppress surface carbon formation on the catalyst.
5. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step in the presence of CO2.
6. The catalyst with a W/V ratio of 0.1 M has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency.
7. The apparent activation energies for the catalysts were calculated using Arrhenius plots over a temperature range of 500 C to 600 C.
8. A cubic silsesquioxane cluster with an isolated V5+OV3+ unit is used to model the active site for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

1. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，二氧化碳的作用是将V2O3氧化为V2O4，并参与丙烷的氧化脱氢过程以生成丙烯。
2. 所使用的催化剂支持在多孔硅胶上，W/V摩尔比介于0和0.6之间。
3. 当在C3H8和CO2中加入D2时，生成水中的D2O仅占45%，这证实了脱氢的氧化途径。
4. 二氧化碳有助于抑制催化剂表面碳的形成。
5. 丙烷的二级CAH键的活化是CO2存在的条件下脱氢的决定性步骤。
6. W/V比例为0.1 M的催化剂具有最高的C3H6平均周转频率。
7. 通过在500°C到600°C的温度范围内进行实验，计算催化剂的表观活化能使用Arrhenius图。
8. 使用一个立方四醇硅烷簇模型，其中包含一个孤立的V5+OV3+单元，用于模拟丙烷在二氧化碳存在的条件下脱氢的活性位点。
