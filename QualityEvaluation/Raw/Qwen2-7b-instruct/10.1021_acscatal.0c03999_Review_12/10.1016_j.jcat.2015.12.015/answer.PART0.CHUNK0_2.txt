Comparing oxidative dehydrogenation mechanisms for redox-active metal oxide catalysts (like V2O5) and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts (such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters), traditional oxidants like oxygen play a crucial role in the redox reactions. They enable the conversion of metal oxides to their reduced forms, facilitating C-H bond cleavage. For redox-active catalysts, oxygen can fully oxidize the catalyst to V2O5 state, enabling complete oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, CO2, as a traditional oxidant, cannot fully re-oxidize the catalyst back to its original state, as it only oxidizes to V2O4. 

For redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2, CO2 can still aid in dehydrogenation processes. It acts as a mild oxidant, which is insufficient to fully oxidize the catalyst but can facilitate partial oxidation and thus contribute to the dehydrogenation of alkanes. Transition metal clusters also show potential in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation, although the specifics depend on the cluster composition and structure.

The role of CO2 in dehydrogenation over WOxVOx/SiO2 catalysts is significant. It oxidizes V2O3 to V2O4, participating in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. CO2 also suppresses surface carbon formation, enhancing selectivity towards propylene. DFT calculations confirm that propane dehydrogenation in CO2 presence can occur through both direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is identified as the rate-limiting step in this process.

对比红氧化还活性金属氧化物催化剂（如V2O5）和非红氧化还活性金属氧化物催化剂（如CeO2和过渡金属簇），传统氧化剂如氧气在还原反应中起着关键作用。它们能促使金属氧化物转化为还原状态，从而实现烷烃的氧化脱氢。对于红氧化还活性催化剂，氧气可以完全将催化剂氧化为V2O5状态，从而实现烷烃的完整氧化脱氢。然而，作为传统氧化剂的CO2无法完全将催化剂恢复到原始状态，因为它只能将其氧化为V2O4。

对于非红氧化还活性催化剂如CeO2，CO2仍可帮助脱氢过程。它作为温和的氧化剂，虽然不足以完全氧化催化剂，但仍能促进部分氧化，从而有助于烷烃的脱氢。过渡金属簇也显示出激活CO2进行氧化脱氢的潜力，但具体取决于簇的组成和结构。

在WOxVOx/SiO2催化剂上，CO2的作用非常重要。它能够氧化V2O3至V2O4，参与丙烷的氧化脱氢至丙烯。CO2还能抑制表面碳的形成，提高丙烯的选择性。根据DFT计算，烷烃在CO2存在下的脱氢过程可以通过直接氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢后接着逆水煤气变换反应同时发生。丙烷的二级CAH键的活化被确认为该过程的限速步骤。
