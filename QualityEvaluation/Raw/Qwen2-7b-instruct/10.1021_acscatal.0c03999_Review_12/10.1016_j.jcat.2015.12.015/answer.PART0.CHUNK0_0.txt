### Comparison of Mechanisms

1. Redox-active metal oxides, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, are capable of undergoing oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, where the C-H bonds are activated via redox processes. This involves the reduction of the metal oxide to a lower oxidation state, followed by hydrogen abstraction and the subsequent desorption of the desired alkene product. The reoxidation step regenerates the active site for further reactions.

2. Redox-inactive metal oxides, like CeO2, do not undergo redox reactions during the dehydrogenation process. Instead, they might promote dehydrogenation through surface effects, such as providing a suitable surface for alkane adsorption and alkene desorption, without directly participating in redox chemistry.

3. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant in the context of oxidative dehydrogenation. It is unable to fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity. CO2 can facilitate the dehydrogenation process by eliminating hydrogen produced through non-oxidative dehydrogenation routes, particularly through the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.

4. Transition metal clusters, if used as catalysts, might exhibit different mechanisms depending on their composition and structure. For instance, they could activate CO2 by forming reactive oxygen species that aid in the dehydrogenation process, potentially leading to a combination of oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation routes.

5. Different catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, can effectively activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The effectiveness is influenced by the specific catalytic properties, such as the ability to form reactive intermediates, surface area, and the presence of active sites that can participate in redox chemistry or surface effects.

6. CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation involves a parallel-consecutive reaction scheme where propane can undergo direct oxidative dehydrogenation or non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by a reverse water gas shift. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and the regeneration of the active site play crucial roles in determining the efficiency of the process.

### Effectiveness of Different Catalysts

1. V2O5 catalysts can undergo oxidative dehydrogenation, but the presence of bulk V2O5 decreases the selectivity towards the desired alkene product and favors total oxidation. WOx addition to V2O5 can hinder the clustering of VOx species, improving selectivity.

2. VOx/SiO2 catalysts benefit from the dispersion of VOx species facilitated by WOx, which retains VOx in a dispersed state, reducing the likelihood of non-selective oxygen formation and total oxidation of propane.

3. CeO2 catalysts, being redox-inactive, may not directly participate in redox reactions but can still contribute to the dehydrogenation process through surface effects.

4. Transition metal clusters can activate CO2 through the formation of reactive intermediates, enabling a combination of oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation routes, potentially leading to enhanced selectivity and efficiency.

### Role of CO2

1. CO2 can act as a mild oxidant, facilitating oxidative dehydrogenation by eliminating hydrogen produced through non-oxidative routes and potentially participating in the RWGS reaction to improve the equilibrium conversion towards propylene.

2. In the presence of CO2, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be lowered, allowing for higher conversion of propane at lower temperatures compared to simple dehydrogenation.

3. CO2 re-oxidizes partially reduced metal oxides to V2O4 instead of V2O5, reducing the likelihood of total oxidation and favoring the selective production of alkene products.

### Energy Barriers and Catalytic Cycles

1. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is a rate-limiting step in both direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift. This step involves the abstraction of hydrogen from the secondary bond.

2. The regeneration of the active site involves different pathways, including the reoxidation of metal oxides with CO2 and the elimination of hydrogen through the RWGS reaction. The energy barriers associated with these steps influence the overall efficiency of the catalytic cycle.

### Conclusions

1. WOx addition to metal oxides, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, enhances the dehydrogenation process by preventing the clustering of VOx species and reducing the likelihood of non-selective oxygen formation.

2. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, facilitating oxidative dehydrogenation by eliminating hydrogen produced through non-oxidative routes and potentially participating in the RWGS reaction to improve the equilibrium conversion towards propylene.

3. Different catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, can effectively activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with the effectiveness influenced by factors such as the ability to form reactive intermediates, surface area, and the presence of active sites that can participate in redox chemistry or surface effects.

4. The presence of WOx has a significant impact on the catalyst itself and the conversion reaction of propane to propylene by acting as a physical barrier between VOx species, hindering the formation of non-selective oxygen and thus reducing the probability of CO2 formation and total oxidation of propane.

### Mechanisms and Energy Barriers

1. In the presence of CO2, propane dehydrogenation can proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation or non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift, with the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane being a rate-limiting step in both pathways.

2. CO2 re-oxidizes partially reduced metal oxides to V2O4, indicating that CO2 can only partially oxidize the catalyst, which aids in maintaining the selectivity towards alkene products.
