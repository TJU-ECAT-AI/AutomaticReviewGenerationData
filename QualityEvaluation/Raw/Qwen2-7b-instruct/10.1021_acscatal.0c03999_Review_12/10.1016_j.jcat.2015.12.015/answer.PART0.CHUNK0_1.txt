[1] "The catalysts contain a similar V-loading and only differ in the amount of impregnated tungsten oxide."
[2] "Compared to the unpromoted catalyst at the same time-on-stream (i.e. 40 s), the amount of hydrogen produced by the promoted catalysts decreased from 13 mmol/s/molVOx to 9.9 mmol/s/molVOx for 1.5WV, to 8.1 mmol/s/molVOx for 4.8WV, and to 5.3 mmol/s/molVOx for 6.8WV."
[3] "In order to avoid the effects of surface carbon on catalyst activity, kinetic measurements of propane dehydrogenation over CO2 re-oxidized catalysts were performed after reduction of the as prepared catalysts by 5% H2/Ar for 10 min at 600 C and catalyst re-oxidation in 20% CO2/He."
[4] "The presence of WOx clearly has an impact on the catalyst itself and the conversion reaction of propane to propylene. It hinders the clustering of the VOx species during reaction by acting as a physical barrier between the VOx species. As a result it prevents the formation of non-selective oxygen which reduces the probability of CO2 formation and thus total oxidation of propane."
[5] "CO2 as the oxidant, on the other hand, cannot re-oxidize the catalyst completely to its V2O5 state. Using CO2, it is only possible to oxidize to V2O4, as confirmed by the isothermal reduction experiments of the CO2 re-oxidized sample."
[6] "Furthermore, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation."
[7] "Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane,while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is occurring on a smaller timescale."

1. The catalysts have a comparable amount of vanadium (V) loading but vary in the quantity of impregnated tungsten oxide.
2. The hydrogen production by the promoted catalysts is lower than the unpromoted catalysts, with a decrease from 13 mmol/s/molVOx to 5.3 mmol/s/molVOx across different tungsten loading levels.
3. Kinetic measurements were conducted on CO2-reoxidized catalysts after reducing the catalysts with 5% H2/Ar for 10 minutes at 600°C, followed by re-oxidation with 20% CO2/He.
4. The addition of tungsten oxide impedes the aggregation of vanadium oxide species during the reaction, preventing the creation of non-selective oxygen and reducing the likelihood of carbon dioxide formation.
5. Carbon dioxide, as an oxidant, cannot fully re-oxidize the catalyst to its original V2O5 state; instead, it only oxidizes it to V2O4, as confirmed by isothermal reduction experiments on CO2-reoxidized samples.
6. CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation yields a higher selectivity for propylene production and a decrease in carbon formation.
7. According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600°C, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, whereas catalyst re-oxidation with CO2 occurs on a shorter timescale.

1. 催化剂的钒（V）负载量相似，但钨氧化物浸渍量不同。
2. 掺杂钨氧化物的催化剂在相同时间上的氢产量低于未掺杂的催化剂，从每摩尔VOx 13毫摩尔下降到每摩尔VOx 5.3毫摩尔，跨越不同的钨加载水平。
3. 在使用5% H2/Ar对催化剂进行10分钟的600°C还原后，随后用20% CO2/He重新氧化，进行了基于CO2重新氧化催化剂的动力学测量。
4. 钨氧化物的添加阻碍了反应期间钒氧化物物种的聚集，防止了非选择性氧的形成并降低了二氧化碳生成的可能性。
5. 作为氧化剂的二氧化碳无法完全将催化剂氧化回其原始的V2O5状态；相反，它仅将其氧化至V2O4，这通过CO2重新氧化样本的等温还原实验得到了证实。
6. CO2辅助丙烷脱氢作用于丙烯的选择性更高，并减少了碳的形成。
7. 根据600°C时的DFT计算的吉布斯自由能图谱，CO2辅助丙烷脱氢作用受限于丙烷的二级CAH键的活化，而催化剂用CO2重新氧化的时间较短。
