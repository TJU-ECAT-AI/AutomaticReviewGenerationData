The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane is to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, participate in oxidative dehydrogenation, and suppress the formation of surface carbon. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is faster. The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency, but higher selectivities are obtained with W/V = 0.6. CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides when using chromium or vanadium oxide based catalysts. The reaction orders for propane and CO2 can be determined by plotting the logarithm of the average TOF versus the logarithm of the inlet molar flow rate of the corresponding compound.

在丙烷脱氢中，二氧化碳的作用是氧化V2O3为V2O4，参与氧化脱氢，并抑制表面碳的形成。丙烷的次级CAH键活化是限制性的步骤，而使用二氧化碳重新氧化催化剂的速度更快。W/V = 0.1 M比例的催化剂具有最高的C3H6平均转率频率，但更高的选择性在W/V = 0.6时获得。当使用铬或二氧化钒基催化剂时，二氧化碳可以重新氧化部分还原的金属氧化物。通过绘制对应化合物的进料摩尔流率的对数与平均TOF的对数值的图，可以确定丙烷和二氧化碳的反应顺序。
