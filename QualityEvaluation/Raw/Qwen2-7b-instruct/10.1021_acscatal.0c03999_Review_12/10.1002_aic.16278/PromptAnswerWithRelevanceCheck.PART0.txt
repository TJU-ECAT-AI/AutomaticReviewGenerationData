The SAPO-34 hollow fiber membranes demonstrated exceptional performance in separating hydrogen (H2) from binary and ternary mixtures (H2, C3H8) or (H2, C3H8, and C3H6) at high temperatures up to 600°C. The highest H2 permeance reached 3.1 ×10^7 mol/m²/s/Pa, and the H2/C3H8 selectivity was 41 at 600°C. The permeation of H2 through the zeolite membrane followed an activated diffusion mechanism, whereas the permeation of C3H8 and C3H6 through the membrane with nonzeolitic pores was governed by adsorption at low temperatures (300°C) and Knudsen diffusion at high temperatures (300°C). The membranes showed stable performance for 140 hours at 600°C in H2/C3H8 separation.

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an equilibrium reaction as shown in Reaction 1. The yield of propylene (C3H6) is heavily limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium of this reaction. Simultaneous removal of generated H2 from the reaction stream via a membrane reactor can significantly enhance propane conversion if H2 permeation is high enough to significantly lower the partial pressure of H2 in the reaction stream and thus shift the equilibrium to produce more propylene."
[2] "In that literature, the highest H2/C3H8 selectivity through the zeolite membrane was 23 at 600C, and this membrane has delivered a good performance for PDH reaction."
[3] "These remarkable improved performances of the SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membrane hold good potential to improve the performance of PDH reaction via the SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite catalytic membrane reactor."

The document does not directly compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, nor does it discuss the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It focuses on the development of high-performance SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membranes for H2 separation and their application in enhancing propane conversion through a membrane reactor in PDH reactions. The document mentions the role of H2 permeation in shifting the equilibrium towards propylene production but does not provide a detailed comparison of different catalyst types or their mechanisms.
