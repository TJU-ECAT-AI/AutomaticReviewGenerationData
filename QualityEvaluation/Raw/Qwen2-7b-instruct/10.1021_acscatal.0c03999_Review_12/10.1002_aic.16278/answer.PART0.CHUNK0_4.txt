<p>The synthesized SAPO-34 hollow fiber membranes show an exceptional performance for H2 separation from a binary mixture (H2, C3H8) or ternary mixture (H2, C3H8 and C3H6) at high temperatures (up to 600C) with the highest H2 permeance of 3.1 ×107 mol/m2/s/Pa and H2/C3H8 selectivity of 41 at 600C.</p>
<p>H2 permeation through SAPO-34 zeolite membrane with narrowed zeolite pores follows an activated diffusion mechanism, while C3H8 and C3H6 permeation through the membrane with nonzeolitic pores is controlled by adsorption at low temperatures (300C) and Knudsen diffusion at high temperatures (300C).</p>
<p>The H2/C3H8 separation stability test shows a stable performance for 140hr for at 600C.</p>

This study demonstrates high performance SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membranes for H2/C3H8 separation at high temperature (600°C). The membranes exhibit 50% higher permeance and 100% higher selectivity compared to previously reported results. They also display stable performance during a 140-hour test at 600°C. The exceptional performance is attributed to the thin (2 μm) zeolite layer and the asymmetric-wall design of the hollow fiber support.

本研究展示了高效率的SAPO-34空心纤维沸石膜在600°C下对H2/C3H8进行分离。与之前报道的结果相比，膜的渗透性和选择性分别提高了50%和100%。在600°C下进行140小时测试时，它们表现出稳定的性能。这种出色的表现归因于薄（2微米）的沸石层以及空心纤维支撑的非对称壁设计。
