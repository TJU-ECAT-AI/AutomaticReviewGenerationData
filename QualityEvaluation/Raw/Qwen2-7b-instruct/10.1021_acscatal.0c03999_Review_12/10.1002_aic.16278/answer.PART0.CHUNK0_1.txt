[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an equilibrium reaction as shown in Reaction 1. The yield of propylene (C3H6) is heavily limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium of this reaction. Simultaneous removal of generated H2 from the reaction stream via a membrane reactor can significantly enhance propane conversion if H2 permeation is high enough to significantly lower the partial pressure of H2 in the reaction stream and thus shift the equilibrium to produce more propylene."
[2] "In that literature, the highest H2/C3H8 selectivity through the zeolite membrane was 23 at 600C, and this membrane has delivered a good performance for PDH reaction."
[3] "These remarkable improved performances of the SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membrane hold good potential to improve the performance of PDH reaction via the SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite catalytic membrane reactor."

The document does not directly compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, nor does it discuss the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It focuses on the development of high-performance SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membranes for H2 separation and their application in enhancing propane conversion through a membrane reactor in PDH reactions. The document mentions the role of H2 permeation in shifting the equilibrium towards propylene production but does not provide a detailed comparison of different catalyst types or their mechanisms.

文档没有直接比较和对比活性氧和非活性氧金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢中C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制之间的差异，也没有讨论不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中激活CO2的有效性。该文档专注于高性能SAPO-34空心纤维沸石膜在H2分离中的开发及其在PDH反应中通过膜反应器增强丙烷转化的应用。文档提到了H2渗透率在推动平衡向丙烯生产方面的作用，但没有提供不同催化剂类型及其机制的详细比较。
