[1] "In that literature, the highest H2/C3H8 selectivity through the zeolite membrane was 23 at 600C, and this membrane has delivered a good performance for PDH reaction."
[2] "In this work, the selectivity of all membranes are above of 23 and thus sufficient for membrane reactor in PDH reaction."
[3] "Hence, M1 and M2 membranes with higher permeance could be more efficient for catalytic membrane reactor in PDH reaction."
[4] "These remarkable improved performances of the SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membrane hold good potential to improve the performance of PDH reaction via the SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite catalytic membrane reactor."

The synthesis of SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membranes demonstrated exceptional performance for H2 separation from binary or ternary mixtures at high temperatures, reaching the highest H2 permeance of 3.1 ×10^7 mol/m2/s/Pa and H2/C3H8 selectivity of 41 at 600°C. This performance surpasses previous reports, showing a 50% increase in permeance and 100% increase in selectivity. The membranes also exhibited stable performance for 140 hours at 600°C, indicating their suitability for high-temperature applications. The improved performance of the SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membranes holds significant potential for enhancing the performance of PDH reactions through catalytic membrane reactors, as they offer better selectivity and permeance compared to previously reported tubular SAPO-34 membranes at 600°C.
