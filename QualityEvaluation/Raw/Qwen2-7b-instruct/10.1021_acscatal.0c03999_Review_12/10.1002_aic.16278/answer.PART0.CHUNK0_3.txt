<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an equilibrium reaction as shown in Reaction 1. The yield of propylene (C3H6) is heavily limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium of this reaction. Simultaneous removal of generated H2 from the reaction stream via a membrane reactor can significantly enhance propane conversion if H2 permeation is high enough to significantly lower the partial pressure of H2 in the reaction stream and thus shift the equilibrium to produce more propylene.</p>
<p>This paper demonstrates high performance SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membranes for H2/C3H8 separation at high temperature (600C). The results show 50% higher permeance and 100% higher selectivity when compared with previously reported results.14 Furthermore, it is the first reported stability test for the as-synthesized SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membrane, which shows a good stability during a 140hr test at 600C.</p>
<p>The synthesized SAPO-34 hollow fiber membranes show an exceptional performance for H2 separation from a binary mixture (H2, C3H8) or ternary mixture (H2, C3H8 and C3H6) at high temperatures (up to 600C) with the highest H2 permeance of 3.1 ×107 mol/m2/s/Pa and H2/C3H8 selectivity of 41 at 600C.</p>
<p>H2 permeation through SAPO-34 zeolite membrane with narrowed zeolite pores follows an activated diffusion mechanism, while C3H8 and C3H6 permeation through the membrane with nonzeolitic pores is controlled by adsorption at low temperatures (300C) and Knudsen diffusion at high temperatures (300C).</p>
<p>The H2/C3H8 separation stability test shows a stable performance for 140hr for at 600C.</p>

The document discusses the high performance of SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membranes for the separation of hydrogen (H2) from a binary or ternary mixture at high temperatures, specifically focusing on their application in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The membranes exhibit superior permeance and selectivity, with the highest H2 permeance recorded at 3.1 ×10^7 mol/m^2/s/Pa and H2/C3H8 selectivity at 41 at 600°C. The separation process involves activated diffusion for H2 and adsorption for C3H8 and C3H6 at lower temperatures, transitioning to Knudsen diffusion at higher temperatures. The membranes also demonstrate good stability over a 140-hour test period at 600°C, making them promising for enhancing the efficiency of PDH reactions.

文档讨论了SAPO-34空心纤维沸石膜在高温下对氢（H2）从二元或三元混合物的高性能分离，特别关注其在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用。膜表现出卓越的渗透性和选择性，记录了最高H2渗透率为3.1×10^7 mol/m^2/s/Pa和600°C时H2/C3H8选择性为41。分离过程涉及H2的激活扩散和低温下C3H8和C3H6的吸附，温度较高时转换为Knudsen扩散。膜在600°C的长期测试中显示出良好的稳定性长达140小时，这使得它们有潜力提高PDH反应的效率。
