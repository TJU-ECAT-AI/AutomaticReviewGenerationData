The SAPO-34 hollow fiber membranes demonstrated exceptional performance in separating hydrogen (H2) from binary and ternary mixtures (H2, C3H8) or (H2, C3H8, and C3H6) at high temperatures up to 600°C. The highest H2 permeance reached 3.1 ×10^7 mol/m²/s/Pa, and the H2/C3H8 selectivity was 41 at 600°C. The permeation of H2 through the zeolite membrane followed an activated diffusion mechanism, whereas the permeation of C3H8 and C3H6 through the membrane with nonzeolitic pores was governed by adsorption at low temperatures (300°C) and Knudsen diffusion at high temperatures (300°C). The membranes showed stable performance for 140 hours at 600°C in H2/C3H8 separation.

合成的SAPO-34空心纤维膜在600°C的高温下对二元混合物（H2，C3H8）或三元混合物（H2，C3H8和C3H6）表现出卓越的性能进行H2分离。最高H2渗透率为3.1×10^7 mol/m²/s/Pa，H2/C3H8选择性为41在600°C。H2通过择形膜的渗透遵循激活扩散机制，而C3H8和C3H6通过带有非择形孔的膜的渗透则由低温（300°C）下的吸附控制以及高温（300°C）下的Knudsen扩散。膜在600°C下进行了140小时的稳定性能测试，在H2/C3H8分离中表现出稳定的性能。
