[1] "Nitrous oxide is an effective oxidant for the conversion of CH4 to C2H4 and C2H6 over a Li+/MgO catalyst, although the rate of oxygen incorporation into the lattice and the regeneration of the active centers is much slower with N2O than with O2."
[2] "The presence of CH4 significantly inhibits the decomposition of N2O over the catalyst."
[3] "By extrapolation of the rate data, the rate of CH4 reaction over the unpoisoned catalyst was determined, and the rate was shown to be first order with respect to N2O."
[4] "A kinetic model, based on competitive surface reactions, in addition to gas-phase reactions, adequately accounts for the conversion as a function of reagent concentrations and temperature, as well as the selectivity for ethane and ethylene."
[5] "At comparable levels of conversion O2 is a less selective oxidant than N2O, not because of more gas-phase oxidation, but because of surface reactions involving reactive oxvgen species."

Nitrous oxide effectively converts methane to ethylene and ethane over a lithium/magnesium oxide catalyst, though its rate of oxygen incorporation and catalyst regeneration is slower compared to oxygen. Methane significantly hinders nitrous oxide's decomposition over the catalyst. The reaction rate with respect to nitrous oxide is first-order. A kinetic model, incorporating both surface and gas-phase reactions, accurately explains the conversion process, along with ethane and ethylene selectivity. At similar conversion levels, oxygen is less selective as an oxidant than nitrous oxide due to surface reactions involving reactive oxygen species.

在锂/氧化镁催化剂上，一氧化二氮有效地将甲烷转化为乙烯和乙烷，尽管其氧的嵌入速率和催化剂再生速率较氧气慢。甲烷显著阻碍了一氧化二氮在催化剂上的分解。对一氧化二氮的反应速率呈一级。基于表面反应和气相反应的竞争性模型准确地解释了转化过程以及乙烷和乙烯的选择性。在相似的转化水平下，氧气作为氧化剂的选型不如一氧化二氮，因为涉及到活性氧物种的表面反应。
