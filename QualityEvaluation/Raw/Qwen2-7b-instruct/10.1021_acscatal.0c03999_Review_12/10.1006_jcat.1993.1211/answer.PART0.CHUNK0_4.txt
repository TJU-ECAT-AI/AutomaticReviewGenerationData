Nitrous oxide (N2O) is found to be an effective oxidant for the conversion of methane (CH4) into ethene (C2H4) and ethane (C2H6) over a lithium (Li+)/magnesium oxide (MgO) catalyst. However, the rate of oxygen incorporation into the lattice structure and the regeneration of active sites occurs much more slowly with N2O compared to oxygen (O2). The presence of CH4 notably hinders the decomposition of N2O over the catalyst. It is hypothesized that both CH4 and N2O are activated through a shared intermediate (like OS ions), and CH4 reacts more quickly with this species. A kinetic model, incorporating both surface and gas-phase reactions, effectively explains the conversion process and its selectivity for ethane and ethylene, depending on reactant concentrations, temperature, and reagent types. Oxygen (O2) is considered a less selective oxidant than N2O, primarily due to surface reactions involving reactive oxygen species, rather than increased gas-phase oxidation.

氮氧化物（N2O）被发现是有效氧化剂，用于通过锂（Li）/镁氧化物（MgO）催化剂将甲烷（CH4）转化为乙烯（C2H4）和乙烷（C2H6）。然而，在催化剂上，氧气（O2）向晶格结构的氧整合和活性中心的再生速度远快于N2O。甲烷的存在显著抑制了N2O在催化剂上的分解。推测CH4和N2O通过共享中间体（如OS离子）激活，并且CH4与这种物种反应更快。基于表面反应和气相反应的竞争性模型有效地解释了转化过程及其对乙烷和乙烯的选择性，这取决于反应物浓度、温度和试剂类型。氧气（O2）被认为是比N2O更不选择性的氧化剂，主要原因是表面反应涉及活性氧物种，而不是增加的气相氧化。
