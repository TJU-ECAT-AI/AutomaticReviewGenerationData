[1] "Nitrous oxide is an effective oxidant for the conversion of CH4 to C2H4 and C2H6 over a Li+/MgO catalyst, although the rate of oxygen incorporation into the lattice and the regeneration of the active centers is much slower with N2O than with O2."
[2] "By extrapolation of the rate data, the rate of CH4 reaction over the unpoisoned catalyst was determined, and the rate was shown to be first order with respect to N2O."
[3] "A kinetic model, based on competitive surface reactions, in addition to gas-phase reactions, adequately accounts for the conversion as a function of reagent concentrations and temperature, as well as the selectivity for ethane and ethylene."
[4] "The presence of CH4 significantly inhibits the decomposition of N2O over the catalyst."
[5] "It is suggested that CH4 and N2O are activated by a common intermediate (e.g., OS ions) and that CH4 reacts more rapidly with this species."

The mechanism for the oxidative coupling of methane over a Li+/MgO catalyst using nitrous oxide as an oxidant involves the activation of both methane and nitrous oxide through a common intermediate, likely OS ions. The rate of oxygen incorporation into the lattice and the regeneration of active centers is slower with nitrous oxide compared to oxygen. The reaction rate with respect to nitrous oxide is first order. A kinetic model that includes both surface and gas-phase reactions accurately describes the conversion process as a function of reagent concentrations and temperature. The presence of methane significantly hinders the decomposition of nitrous oxide over the catalyst. Ethane and ethylene selectivity is influenced by these factors.

在Li+/MgO催化剂上使用一氧化二氮作为氧化剂进行甲烷氧化耦合的机制涉及到甲烷和一氧化二氮通过共同中间体（如OS离子）的活化。氧气在晶格中的掺入速率和活性中心再生速率在使用一氧化二氮时较慢，与氧气相比。相对于一氧化二氮的反应速率是一级的。包含表面反应和气相反应的动态模型准确地描述了反应过程随反应物浓度和温度的变化。甲烷的存在显著阻碍了催化剂上一氧化二氮的分解。乙烷和乙烯的选择性受这些因素的影响。
