[1] "Nitrous oxide is an effective oxidant for the conversion of CH4 to C2H4 and C2H6 over a Li+/MgO catalyst, although the rate of oxygen incorporation into the lattice and the regeneration of the active centers is much slower with N2O than with O2."
[2] "The presence of CH4 significantly inhibits the decomposition of N2O over the catalyst."
[3] "At comparable levels of conversion O2 is a less selective oxidant than N2O, not because of more gas-phase oxidation, but because of surface reactions involving reactive oxvgen species."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) serves as an effective oxidant for converting methane (CH4) to ethylene (C2H4) and ethane (C2H6) over a lithium (Li+)/magnesium oxide (MgO) catalyst. However, the process is characterized by a slower rate of oxygen incorporation into the catalyst's lattice and the regeneration of its active sites compared to using molecular oxygen (O2). The presence of methane significantly hinders the decomposition of N2O on the catalyst surface. Despite this, under similar conversion levels, oxygen (O2) is a less selective oxidant than N2O, not due to increased gas-phase oxidation, but because of surface reactions involving reactive oxygen species.

在锂（Li）/镁氧化物（MgO）催化剂上，一氧化二氮（N2O）是将甲烷（CH4）转化为乙烯（C2H4）和乙烷（C2H6）的有效氧化剂。然而，氧原子嵌入到催化剂晶格中及活性中心再生的速度，使用N2O比使用氧气（O2）要慢得多。甲烷的存在显著抑制了N2O在催化剂表面的分解。尽管如此，在相似的转化率下，氧气（O2）作为选择性氧化剂不如N2O，这并非由于更多的气相氧化，而是由于涉及活性氧物种的表面反应。
