[1] "Nitrous oxide is an effective oxidant for the conversion of CH4 to C2H4 and C2H6 over a Li+/MgO catalyst, although the rate of oxygen incorporation into the lattice and the regeneration of the active centers is much slower with N2O than with O2."
[2] "The presence of CH4 significantly inhibits the decomposition of N2O over the catalyst."
[3] "By extrapolation of the rate data, the rate of CH4 reaction over the unpoisoned catalyst was determined, and the rate was shown to be first order with respect to N2O."
[4] "A kinetic model, based on competitive surface reactions, in addition to gas-phase reactions, adequately accounts for the conversion as a function of reagent concentrations and temperature, as well as the selectivity for ethane and ethylene."
[5] "At comparable levels of conversion O2 is a less selective oxidant than N2O, not because of more gas-phase oxidation, but because of surface reactions involving reactive oxvgen species."

Nitrous oxide effectively converts methane to ethylene and ethane over a lithium/magnesium oxide catalyst, though its rate of oxygen incorporation and catalyst regeneration is slower compared to oxygen. Methane significantly hinders nitrous oxide's decomposition over the catalyst. The reaction rate with respect to nitrous oxide is first-order. A kinetic model, incorporating both surface and gas-phase reactions, accurately explains the conversion process, along with ethane and ethylene selectivity. At similar conversion levels, oxygen is less selective as an oxidant than nitrous oxide due to surface reactions involving reactive oxygen species.

The oxidative coupling of methane over a Li+/MgO catalyst using nitrous oxide as an oxidant involves the activation of both methane and nitrous oxide by a common intermediate, likely OS ions. The process is characterized by a slow rate of oxygen incorporation into the lattice and the regeneration of active centers, which makes oxygen incorporation the rate-limiting step, especially at lower methane partial pressures. The kinetic model, accounting for both surface and gas-phase reactions, explains the conversion rate and product selectivity for ethane and ethylene. Nitrous oxide is found to be a more selective oxidant compared to oxygen at equivalent conversion levels, due to its ability to undergo surface reactions involving reactive oxygen species, rather than more extensive gas-phase oxidation. Moreover, the presence of methane significantly hinders the decomposition of nitrous oxide over the catalyst.

在Li+/MgO催化剂上使用氮氧化物作为氧化剂对甲烷进行氧化耦合，甲烷和氮氧化物通过共同中间体（例如OS离子）被激活。该过程以氧嵌入晶格和活性中心再生的速度较慢为特征，使得氧嵌入成为速率限制步骤，尤其是在较低甲烷分压时。考虑表面反应和气相反应的动态模型能够解释转化率和产物选择性（乙烷和乙烯）随反应物浓度和温度的变化情况。在等同转化率下，与氧气相比，氮氧化物是一种更优选的氧化剂，其原因在于它能够通过涉及活性氧物种的表面反应进行，而不是更广泛的气相氧化。此外，甲烷的存在显著抑制了催化剂上的氮氧化物分解。

Nitrous oxide (N2O) serves as an effective oxidant for converting methane (CH4) to ethylene (C2H4) and ethane (C2H6) over a lithium (Li+)/magnesium oxide (MgO) catalyst. However, the process is characterized by a slower rate of oxygen incorporation into the catalyst's lattice and the regeneration of its active sites compared to using molecular oxygen (O2). The presence of methane significantly hinders the decomposition of N2O on the catalyst surface. Despite this, under similar conversion levels, oxygen (O2) is a less selective oxidant than N2O, not due to increased gas-phase oxidation, but because of surface reactions involving reactive oxygen species.

在锂（Li）/镁氧化物（MgO）催化剂上，一氧化二氮（N2O）是将甲烷（CH4）转化为乙烯（C2H4）和乙烷（C2H6）的有效氧化剂。然而，氧原子嵌入到催化剂晶格中及活性中心再生的速度，使用N2O比使用氧气（O2）要慢得多。甲烷的存在显著抑制了N2O在催化剂表面的分解。尽管如此，在相似的转化率下，氧气（O2）作为选择性氧化剂不如N2O，这并非由于更多的气相氧化，而是由于涉及活性氧物种的表面反应。

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is found to be an effective oxidant for the conversion of methane (CH4) into ethene (C2H4) and ethane (C2H6) over a lithium (Li+)/magnesium oxide (MgO) catalyst. However, the rate of oxygen incorporation into the lattice structure and the regeneration of active sites occurs much more slowly with N2O compared to oxygen (O2). The presence of CH4 notably hinders the decomposition of N2O over the catalyst. It is hypothesized that both CH4 and N2O are activated through a shared intermediate (like OS ions), and CH4 reacts more quickly with this species. A kinetic model, incorporating both surface and gas-phase reactions, effectively explains the conversion process and its selectivity for ethane and ethylene, depending on reactant concentrations, temperature, and reagent types. Oxygen (O2) is considered a less selective oxidant than N2O, primarily due to surface reactions involving reactive oxygen species, rather than increased gas-phase oxidation.

氮氧化物（N2O）被发现是有效氧化剂，用于通过锂（Li）/镁氧化物（MgO）催化剂将甲烷（CH4）转化为乙烯（C2H4）和乙烷（C2H6）。然而，在催化剂上，氧气（O2）向晶格结构的氧整合和活性中心的再生速度远快于N2O。甲烷的存在显著抑制了N2O在催化剂上的分解。推测CH4和N2O通过共享中间体（如OS离子）激活，并且CH4与这种物种反应更快。基于表面反应和气相反应的竞争性模型有效地解释了转化过程及其对乙烷和乙烯的选择性，这取决于反应物浓度、温度和试剂类型。氧气（O2）被认为是比N2O更不选择性的氧化剂，主要原因是表面反应涉及活性氧物种，而不是增加的气相氧化。
