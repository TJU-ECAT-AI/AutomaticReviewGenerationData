[1] "Nitrous oxide is an effective oxidant for the conversion of CH4 to C2H4 and C2H6 over a Li+/MgO catalyst, although the rate of oxygen incorporation into the lattice and the regeneration of the active centers is much slower with N2O than with O2."
[2] "Thus, except at very low CH4 partial pressures, the rate-limiting step is oxygen incorporation, rather than the activation of CH4 at the surface."
[3] "A kinetic model, based on competitive surface reactions, in addition to gas-phase reactions, adequately accounts for the conversion as a function of reagent concentrations and temperature, as well as the selectivity for ethane and ethylene."
[4] "At comparable levels of conversion O2 is a less selective oxidant than N2O, not because of more gas-phase oxidation, but because of surface reactions involving reactive oxygen species."
[5] "The presence of CH4 significantly inhibits the decomposition of N2O over the catalyst."
[6] "It is suggested that CH4 and N2O are activated by a common intermediate (e.g., OS ions) and that CH4 reacts more rapidly with this species."

The oxidative coupling of methane over a Li+/MgO catalyst using nitrous oxide as an oxidant involves the activation of both methane and nitrous oxide by a common intermediate, likely OS ions. The process is characterized by a slow rate of oxygen incorporation into the lattice and the regeneration of active centers, which makes oxygen incorporation the rate-limiting step, especially at lower methane partial pressures. The kinetic model, accounting for both surface and gas-phase reactions, explains the conversion rate and product selectivity for ethane and ethylene. Nitrous oxide is found to be a more selective oxidant compared to oxygen at equivalent conversion levels, due to its ability to undergo surface reactions involving reactive oxygen species, rather than more extensive gas-phase oxidation. Moreover, the presence of methane significantly hinders the decomposition of nitrous oxide over the catalyst.

在Li+/MgO催化剂上使用氮氧化物作为氧化剂对甲烷进行氧化耦合，甲烷和氮氧化物通过共同中间体（例如OS离子）被激活。该过程以氧嵌入晶格和活性中心再生的速度较慢为特征，使得氧嵌入成为速率限制步骤，尤其是在较低甲烷分压时。考虑表面反应和气相反应的动态模型能够解释转化率和产物选择性（乙烷和乙烯）随反应物浓度和温度的变化情况。在等同转化率下，与氧气相比，氮氧化物是一种更优选的氧化剂，其原因在于它能够通过涉及活性氧物种的表面反应进行，而不是更广泛的气相氧化。此外，甲烷的存在显著抑制了催化剂上的氮氧化物分解。
