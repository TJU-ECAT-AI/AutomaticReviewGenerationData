[1] "Regardless of vanadium loading (up to 5.3 wt%), the highly dispersed surface VOx species show similar intrinsic catalytic activity."
[2] "However, the measured activity of these species is lower when N2O is used as the oxi- dant, in comparison with O2. The difference is due to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced VOx species rather than re-oxidation by O2."
[3] "For all of the V/MCM-41 materials, the use of N2O instead of O2 favors selective propane oxidation to propene over the total combustion of propane or propene."
[4] "The improving effect of N2O is related to site isolation of the active surface lattice oxygen species; thereby the direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is inhibited."

1. The highly dispersed surface VOx species on V/MCM-41 catalysts display similar intrinsic catalytic activity regardless of vanadium loading up to 5.3 wt%. 

2. When N2O is used as an oxidant, the activity of these species is lower compared to when O2 is used. This is attributed to N2O's lesser ability to re-oxidize reduced VOx species.

3. Using N2O instead of O2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over V/MCM-41 catalysts favors selective conversion to propene over total combustion.

4. The advantage of N2O lies in the spatial separation of active surface lattice oxygen species, inhibiting direct propane and subsequent propene oxidation to COx.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes typically involves the activation of C-H bonds by redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (V2O5) and molybdenum, with oxygen (O2) as the traditional oxidant. The interaction between the oxide support and the deposited metal oxide determines the structure of the resulting surface metal oxide species (VOx), which affects the catalytic activity and selectivity. Mesoporous materials provide high surface areas that enable high dispersion of the active VOx species, influencing the rate of product formation. Adding small amounts of water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) to the reaction feed can enhance propene selectivity at the expense of catalytic activity. Using CO2 as an oxidant has been shown to improve propene selectivity compared to O2. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is suggested to be promising for enhancing propene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. For catalyst design, achieving high dispersion of redox-active metal oxides on inert supports while ensuring easy reduction by hydrocarbons and avoiding rapid re-oxidation by the oxidant is crucial. This spatial isolation of active lattice oxygen species favors selective oxidation over combustion reactions. In process design, N2O is recognized as a suitable oxidant for selective benzene oxidation to phenol. The effectiveness of different catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, ceria (CeO2), and transition metal clusters, in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on their specific mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

在烷烃氧化脱氢反应中，通常涉及由具有还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂激活C-H键，例如钒(V2O5)和钼，传统上使用氧气(O2)作为氧化剂。氧化物支持与沉积的金属氧化物之间的相互作用决定了最终表面金属氧化物种（VOx）的结构，这影响催化活性和选择性。介孔材料提供了高表面积，能够促进活性VOx物种的高分散，影响产物形成速率。向反应流体中添加少量水（H2O）、二氧化碳（CO2）和亚硝酸盐（N2O）可以提高丙烯选择性，同时降低催化活性。使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂已被证明可以提高与氧气相比的丙烯选择性。亚硝酸盐（N2O）被建议为增强氧化脱氢反应中丙烯选择性的有希望的氧化剂。对于催化剂设计，在惰性支持上实现红氧化合物高分散，并确保易于由碳氢化合物还原并避免快速由氧化剂氧化，这对于选择性氧化而非燃烧反应至关重要。在工艺设计中，认识到N2O是用于选择性苯氧化到酚的合适氧化剂。不同催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、铈氧化物（CeO2）和过渡金属簇的有效性取决于它们特定机制和CO2分解的能量壁垒，在丙烷氧化中激活二氧化碳。

1. When using N2O as the oxidant, the highly dispersed surface VOx species maintain similar intrinsic catalytic activity despite the vanadium loading.

2. The use of N2O leads to a lower activity in comparison to O2, primarily because N2O has a weaker capability to re-oxidize reduced VOx species, not because of O2's re-oxidation.

3. Crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles do not exhibit selective behavior when O2 is employed, unlike the highly dispersed surface VOx species. However, in the presence of N2O, the selectivity for propene formation remains comparable.

4. For all the V/MCM-41 catalysts, employing N2O as the oxidant enhances selective propane oxidation to propene over complete combustion of propane or propene.

5. The advantageous effect of N2O is attributed to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species on the catalyst surface, inhibiting direct deep propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx.

1. 当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，高度分散的表面VOx物种保持相似的基本催化活性，尽管存在钒加载量。

2. 使用N2O导致与O2相比活动性降低，主要原因是N2O对还原的VOx物种的再氧化能力较弱，而不是O2的再氧化。

3. 当使用O2时，结晶型V2O5纳米颗粒不表现出选择性，与高度分散的表面VOx物种不同。然而，在N2O存在的条件下，丙烯选择性形成的变化并不明显。

4. 对所有V/MCM-41催化剂而言，采用N2O作为氧化剂可以增强选择性的丙烷氧化为丙烯，而避免完全燃烧丙烷或丙烯。

5. N2O的优势效果归因于催化剂表面活性氧原子位点的空间隔离，这抑制了直接深丙烷氧化和连续丙烯氧化至COx。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using V/MCM-41 catalysts shows enhanced activity and selectivity based on the arrangement of VOx species on the catalyst surface and the type of oxidant employed. High dispersion of VOx species leads to similar intrinsic catalytic activity across different vanadium loadings. However, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles fail to maintain selectivity when oxygen is the oxidant. Instead, N2O promotes selective propane oxidation to propene, inhibiting direct propane or propene combustion, thus favoring propene formation over total combustion reactions.

氧化脱氢反应使用V/MCM-41催化剂时，其活性和选择性依赖于催化剂表面VOx物种的分布以及氧化剂的性质。高度分散的VOx物种在不同钒加载量下表现出相似的内在催化活性。然而，当氧气作为氧化剂时，晶态V2O5纳米粒子不能保持选择性。相反，N2O促进丙烷选择性氧化为丙烯，抑制直接丙烷或丙烯燃烧，从而优先选择丙烯形成而不是完全燃烧反应。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane, involves distinct mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration depending on whether the metal oxide catalyst is redox-active or redox-inactive. For redox-active catalysts, such as vanadium oxide (V2O5), the activation of C-H bonds and regeneration of the catalyst occur through the reduction and subsequent re-oxidation of the metal oxide. This cycle facilitates the breaking and re-forming of bonds essential for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. On the other hand, redox-inactive catalysts, like ceria (CeO2) or transition metal clusters, rely on external sources of electrons for C-H bond activation, which can lead to more controlled reactions but might require additional energy inputs.

In the context of propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the literature highlights the effectiveness of different catalysts. For instance, vanadium oxide (V2O5) and vanadium oxides supported on silica (VOx/SiO2) are noted for their selectivity and efficiency in the process, especially when nitrogen dioxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant. The use of N2O is advantageous because it helps inhibit direct propane oxidation and consecutive oxidation of propene to COx, thus promoting selective propene formation. The key to achieving selective oxidation lies in the spatial isolation of active lattice oxygen species, which is facilitated by the lower re-oxidation rate of N2O compared to oxygen (O2).

Regarding the activation of carbon dioxide (CO2) for oxidative dehydrogenation, the literature suggests that the effectiveness varies among different catalysts. For example, the presence of redox-active metal oxides like vanadium can enable CO2 activation and utilization in the process. However, the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and the efficiency of CO2 activation need further study to optimize the process. The use of transition metal clusters could potentially offer a more controlled environment for CO2 activation, but their effectiveness in oxidative dehydrogenation requires further investigation.

Overall, the choice of catalyst and oxidant plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The use of N2O as an oxidant can improve selectivity, while the spatial isolation of active lattice oxygen species on redox-active catalysts like vanadium oxide is essential for promoting selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

氧化脱氢反应中，烷烃，特别是丙烷，的C-H键激活和催化剂再生机制在活性金属氧化物催化剂是可氧化还原或不可氧化还原时存在明显差异。对于可氧化还原催化剂，如钒氧化物（V2O5），C-H键激活和催化剂再生通过金属氧化物的还原和随后的重新氧化进行。这个循环对于氧化脱氢过程中的键断裂和重组至关重要。另一方面，如铈氧化物（CeO2）或过渡金属簇等不可氧化还原催化剂，则依赖于外部电子来源进行C-H键激活，这可能需要额外的能量输入，但可能导致更可控的反应。

文献强调了不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中的有效性。例如，钒氧化物（V2O5）和硅基钒氧化物（VOx/SiO2）因其选择性和效率而被证明对这一过程有效，尤其是当使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂时。与氧气（O2）相比，N2O有助于抑制直接丙烷氧化和丙烯进一步氧化为COx，从而促进选择性丙烯形成。实现选择性氧化的关键在于活性晶格氧物种的空间隔离，这是由N2O较低的重新氧化速率所促成的。

关于二氧化碳（CO2）的激活用于氧化脱氢，文献表明其有效性在不同的催化剂中存在差异。例如，具有可氧化还原性质的金属氧化物如钒可以启用CO2激活并利用于该过程。然而，CO2解离的能量壁垒及其激活效率需要进一步研究以优化过程。过渡金属簇的使用可能提供一个更有控制的环境来激活CO2，但它们在氧化脱氢中的有效性仍需进一步探索。

综上所述，催化剂的选择和氧化剂的使用对烷烃的氧化脱氢过程至关重要。使用N2O作为氧化剂可以提高选择性，而可氧化还原催化剂（如钒氧化物）上活性晶格氧物种的空间隔离对于促进选择性氧化而不是燃烧反应是必要的。
