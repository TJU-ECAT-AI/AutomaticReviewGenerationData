[1] "The findings from the present investigation can be summarized as follows:"
[2] "Regardless of vanadium loading (up to 5.3 wt%), the highly dispersed surface VOx species show similar intrinsic catalytic activity."
[3] "However, the measured activity of these species is lower when N2O is used as the oxidant, in comparison with O2."
[4] "For all of the V/MCM-41 materials, the use of N2O instead of O2 favors selective propane oxidation to propene over the total combustion of propane or propene."
[5] "The improving effect of N2O is related to site isolation of the active surface lattice oxygen species; thereby the direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is inhibited."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane, involves distinct mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration depending on whether the metal oxide catalyst is redox-active or redox-inactive. For redox-active catalysts, such as vanadium oxide (V2O5), the activation of C-H bonds and regeneration of the catalyst occur through the reduction and subsequent re-oxidation of the metal oxide. This cycle facilitates the breaking and re-forming of bonds essential for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. On the other hand, redox-inactive catalysts, like ceria (CeO2) or transition metal clusters, rely on external sources of electrons for C-H bond activation, which can lead to more controlled reactions but might require additional energy inputs.

In the context of propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the literature highlights the effectiveness of different catalysts. For instance, vanadium oxide (V2O5) and vanadium oxides supported on silica (VOx/SiO2) are noted for their selectivity and efficiency in the process, especially when nitrogen dioxide (N2O) is used as an oxidant. The use of N2O is advantageous because it helps inhibit direct propane oxidation and consecutive oxidation of propene to COx, thus promoting selective propene formation. The key to achieving selective oxidation lies in the spatial isolation of active lattice oxygen species, which is facilitated by the lower re-oxidation rate of N2O compared to oxygen (O2).

Regarding the activation of carbon dioxide (CO2) for oxidative dehydrogenation, the literature suggests that the effectiveness varies among different catalysts. For example, the presence of redox-active metal oxides like vanadium can enable CO2 activation and utilization in the process. However, the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and the efficiency of CO2 activation need further study to optimize the process. The use of transition metal clusters could potentially offer a more controlled environment for CO2 activation, but their effectiveness in oxidative dehydrogenation requires further investigation.

Overall, the choice of catalyst and oxidant plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The use of N2O as an oxidant can improve selectivity, while the spatial isolation of active lattice oxygen species on redox-active catalysts like vanadium oxide is essential for promoting selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

氧化脱氢反应中，烷烃，特别是丙烷，的C-H键激活和催化剂再生机制在活性金属氧化物催化剂是可氧化还原或不可氧化还原时存在明显差异。对于可氧化还原催化剂，如钒氧化物（V2O5），C-H键激活和催化剂再生通过金属氧化物的还原和随后的重新氧化进行。这个循环对于氧化脱氢过程中的键断裂和重组至关重要。另一方面，如铈氧化物（CeO2）或过渡金属簇等不可氧化还原催化剂，则依赖于外部电子来源进行C-H键激活，这可能需要额外的能量输入，但可能导致更可控的反应。

文献强调了不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中的有效性。例如，钒氧化物（V2O5）和硅基钒氧化物（VOx/SiO2）因其选择性和效率而被证明对这一过程有效，尤其是当使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂时。与氧气（O2）相比，N2O有助于抑制直接丙烷氧化和丙烯进一步氧化为COx，从而促进选择性丙烯形成。实现选择性氧化的关键在于活性晶格氧物种的空间隔离，这是由N2O较低的重新氧化速率所促成的。

关于二氧化碳（CO2）的激活用于氧化脱氢，文献表明其有效性在不同的催化剂中存在差异。例如，具有可氧化还原性质的金属氧化物如钒可以启用CO2激活并利用于该过程。然而，CO2解离的能量壁垒及其激活效率需要进一步研究以优化过程。过渡金属簇的使用可能提供一个更有控制的环境来激活CO2，但它们在氧化脱氢中的有效性仍需进一步探索。

综上所述，催化剂的选择和氧化剂的使用对烷烃的氧化脱氢过程至关重要。使用N2O作为氧化剂可以提高选择性，而可氧化还原催化剂（如钒氧化物）上活性晶格氧物种的空间隔离对于促进选择性氧化而不是燃烧反应是必要的。
