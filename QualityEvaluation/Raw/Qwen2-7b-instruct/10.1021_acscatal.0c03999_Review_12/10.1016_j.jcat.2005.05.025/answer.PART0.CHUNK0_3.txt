[1] "The improvement in activity and selectivity of V/MCM-41 catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on the distribution of VOx species on the catalyst surface and the nature of the oxidant."
[2] "Regardless of vanadium loading (up to 5.3 wt%), the highly dispersed surface VOx species show similar intrinsic catalytic activity."
[3] "In contrast to highly dispersed surface VOx species, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective when O2 is used as the oxidant."
[4] "For all of the V/MCM-41 materials, the use of N2O instead of O2 favors selective propane oxidation to propene over the total combustion of propane or propene."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using V/MCM-41 catalysts shows enhanced activity and selectivity based on the arrangement of VOx species on the catalyst surface and the type of oxidant employed. High dispersion of VOx species leads to similar intrinsic catalytic activity across different vanadium loadings. However, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles fail to maintain selectivity when oxygen is the oxidant. Instead, N2O promotes selective propane oxidation to propene, inhibiting direct propane or propene combustion, thus favoring propene formation over total combustion reactions.

氧化脱氢反应使用V/MCM-41催化剂时，其活性和选择性依赖于催化剂表面VOx物种的分布以及氧化剂的性质。高度分散的VOx物种在不同钒加载量下表现出相似的内在催化活性。然而，当氧气作为氧化剂时，晶态V2O5纳米粒子不能保持选择性。相反，N2O促进丙烷选择性氧化为丙烯，抑制直接丙烷或丙烯燃烧，从而优先选择丙烯形成而不是完全燃烧反应。
