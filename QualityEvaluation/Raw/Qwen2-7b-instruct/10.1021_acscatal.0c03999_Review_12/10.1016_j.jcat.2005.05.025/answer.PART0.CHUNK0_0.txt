[1] "Regardless of vanadium loading (up to 5.3 wt%), the highly dispersed surface VOx species show similar intrinsic catalytic activity."
[2] "However, the measured activity of these species is lower when N2O is used as the oxi- dant, in comparison with O2. The difference is due to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced VOx species rather than re-oxidation by O2."
[3] "For all of the V/MCM-41 materials, the use of N2O instead of O2 favors selective propane oxidation to propene over the total combustion of propane or propene."
[4] "The improving effect of N2O is related to site isolation of the active surface lattice oxygen species; thereby the direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is inhibited."

1. The highly dispersed surface VOx species on V/MCM-41 catalysts display similar intrinsic catalytic activity regardless of vanadium loading up to 5.3 wt%. 

2. When N2O is used as an oxidant, the activity of these species is lower compared to when O2 is used. This is attributed to N2O's lesser ability to re-oxidize reduced VOx species.

3. Using N2O instead of O2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over V/MCM-41 catalysts favors selective conversion to propene over total combustion.

4. The advantage of N2O lies in the spatial separation of active surface lattice oxygen species, inhibiting direct propane and subsequent propene oxidation to COx.

1. 高分散表面VOx物种在V/MCM-41催化剂上的内在催化活性，无论钒加载量高达5.3 wt%，都显示相似性。

2. 当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，这些物种的活性较之使用O2时要低。这种差异归因于N2O对还原VOx物种的再氧化能力较弱。

3. 对于V/MCM-41催化剂，使用N2O代替O2进行丙烷的氧化脱氢反应，有利于选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，而非完全燃烧。

4. N2O的优点在于表面活性氧原子位点的空间分离，阻止了直接丙烷和随后的丙烯氧化为COx。
