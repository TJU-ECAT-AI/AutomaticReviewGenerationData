[1] "Regardless of vanadium loading (up to 5.3 wt%), the highly dispersed surface VOx species show similar intrinsic catalytic activity."
[2] "However, the measured activity of these species is lower when N2O is used as the oxidant, in comparison with O2. The difference is due to the lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced VOx species rather than re-oxidation by O2."
[3] "In contrast to highly dispersed surface VOx species, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective when O2 is used as the oxidant. However, in the presence of N2O, there is no strong difference in propene selectivity."
[4] "For all of the V/MCM-41 materials, the use of N2O instead of O2 favors selective propane oxidation to propene over the total combustion of propane or propene."
[5] "The improving effect of N2O is related to site isolation of the active surface lattice oxygen species; thereby the direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is inhibited."

1. When using N2O as the oxidant, the highly dispersed surface VOx species maintain similar intrinsic catalytic activity despite the vanadium loading.

2. The use of N2O leads to a lower activity in comparison to O2, primarily because N2O has a weaker capability to re-oxidize reduced VOx species, not because of O2's re-oxidation.

3. Crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles do not exhibit selective behavior when O2 is employed, unlike the highly dispersed surface VOx species. However, in the presence of N2O, the selectivity for propene formation remains comparable.

4. For all the V/MCM-41 catalysts, employing N2O as the oxidant enhances selective propane oxidation to propene over complete combustion of propane or propene.

5. The advantageous effect of N2O is attributed to the spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species on the catalyst surface, inhibiting direct deep propane oxidation and consecutive propene oxidation to COx.

1. 当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，高度分散的表面VOx物种保持相似的基本催化活性，尽管存在钒加载量。

2. 使用N2O导致与O2相比活动性降低，主要原因是N2O对还原的VOx物种的再氧化能力较弱，而不是O2的再氧化。

3. 当使用O2时，结晶型V2O5纳米颗粒不表现出选择性，与高度分散的表面VOx物种不同。然而，在N2O存在的条件下，丙烯选择性形成的变化并不明显。

4. 对所有V/MCM-41催化剂而言，采用N2O作为氧化剂可以增强选择性的丙烷氧化为丙烯，而避免完全燃烧丙烷或丙烯。

5. N2O的优势效果归因于催化剂表面活性氧原子位点的空间隔离，这抑制了直接深丙烷氧化和连续丙烯氧化至COx。
