The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes typically involves the activation of C-H bonds by redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (V2O5) and molybdenum, with oxygen (O2) as the traditional oxidant. The interaction between the oxide support and the deposited metal oxide determines the structure of the resulting surface metal oxide species (VOx), which affects the catalytic activity and selectivity. Mesoporous materials provide high surface areas that enable high dispersion of the active VOx species, influencing the rate of product formation. Adding small amounts of water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) to the reaction feed can enhance propene selectivity at the expense of catalytic activity. Using CO2 as an oxidant has been shown to improve propene selectivity compared to O2. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is suggested to be promising for enhancing propene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. For catalyst design, achieving high dispersion of redox-active metal oxides on inert supports while ensuring easy reduction by hydrocarbons and avoiding rapid re-oxidation by the oxidant is crucial. This spatial isolation of active lattice oxygen species favors selective oxidation over combustion reactions. In process design, N2O is recognized as a suitable oxidant for selective benzene oxidation to phenol. The effectiveness of different catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, ceria (CeO2), and transition metal clusters, in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on their specific mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

在烷烃氧化脱氢反应中，通常涉及由具有还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂激活C-H键，例如钒(V2O5)和钼，传统上使用氧气(O2)作为氧化剂。氧化物支持与沉积的金属氧化物之间的相互作用决定了最终表面金属氧化物种（VOx）的结构，这影响催化活性和选择性。介孔材料提供了高表面积，能够促进活性VOx物种的高分散，影响产物形成速率。向反应流体中添加少量水（H2O）、二氧化碳（CO2）和亚硝酸盐（N2O）可以提高丙烯选择性，同时降低催化活性。使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂已被证明可以提高与氧气相比的丙烯选择性。亚硝酸盐（N2O）被建议为增强氧化脱氢反应中丙烯选择性的有希望的氧化剂。对于催化剂设计，在惰性支持上实现红氧化合物高分散，并确保易于由碳氢化合物还原并避免快速由氧化剂氧化，这对于选择性氧化而非燃烧反应至关重要。在工艺设计中，认识到N2O是用于选择性苯氧化到酚的合适氧化剂。不同催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、铈氧化物（CeO2）和过渡金属簇的有效性取决于它们特定机制和CO2分解的能量壁垒，在丙烷氧化中激活二氧化碳。
