    Compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, explaining the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. Include a discussion on the effectiveness of different catalysts (such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) on a variety of catalysts, including redox-active metal oxides (like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2) and redox-inactive metal oxides (like CeO2), can be understood through the activation of both C-H bonds and CO2."

[2] "Redox-active metal oxides like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are effective in oxidative dehydrogenation because they can readily oxidize CO2 to CO, which then acts as an oxidant in the dehydrogenation process."

[3] "On the other hand, redox-inactive metal oxides like CeO2 facilitate the oxidative dehydrogenation by providing a surface for the activation of CO2, which can then participate in the dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "For CO2 activation, the dissociation of CO2 plays a crucial role. Traditional oxidants like V2O5 can promote CO2 dissociation to CO, whereas CO2 itself can also be dissociated over the surface of redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2."

[5] "Transition metal clusters, whether supported on other materials or free-standing, offer a unique mechanism for CO2 activation. They can facilitate the direct dissociation of CO2 into CO and O, which then contribute to the dehydrogenation process."

[6] "The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 varies. For instance, V2O5 is known for its ability to activate CO2 to CO, making it highly effective in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. CeO2, while less efficient in activating CO2 to CO, still plays a significant role in activating CO2 to facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction."

[7] "The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation involve the formation of reactive intermediates like CO and O, which then participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are a key factor in determining the efficiency of different catalysts."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) utilizes both redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active metal oxides like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are effective because they readily oxidize CO2 to CO, which acts as an oxidant in the dehydrogenation process. Redox-inactive metal oxides like CeO2 facilitate CO2 activation by providing a surface for CO2 to dissociate, forming CO and O that contribute to the dehydrogenation reaction. Transition metal clusters, whether supported or free-standing, offer a unique mechanism for CO2 activation by directly dissociating CO2 into CO and O. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 varies, with V2O5 being particularly efficient due to its ability to activate CO2 to CO. CeO2, while less efficient in activating CO2 to CO, still plays a significant role in activating CO2 to facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction. The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation involve the formation of reactive intermediates like CO and O, which participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are a critical factor in determining the efficiency of different catalysts.

氧化脱氢反应通过活化C-H键和CO2，使用活性金属氧化物（如V2O5和VOx/SiO2）和非活性金属氧化物（如CeO2）在丙烷（C3H8）上可以被理解。活性金属氧化物如V2O5和VOx/SiO2有效，因为它们可以轻易地将CO2氧化为CO，这随后作为脱氢过程中的氧化剂。非活性金属氧化物如CeO2通过提供CO2激活的表面来促进氧化脱氢，从而激活CO2形成CO和O，这些参与了脱氢反应。过渡金属簇，无论是支持在其他材料上还是自由立的，提供了CO2激活的独特机制，直接将CO2分解为CO和O，然后参与到脱氢过程中。不同催化剂激活CO2的有效性存在差异，例如，V2O5因其能够将CO2活化为CO而特别有效。CeO2虽然在将CO2活化为CO方面效率较低，但仍能通过激活CO2在促进脱氢反应中发挥作用。CO2分解的提议机制涉及形成活性中间体如CO和O，这些参与了氧化脱氢过程。CO2分解的能量壁垒是确定不同催化剂效率的关键因素。
