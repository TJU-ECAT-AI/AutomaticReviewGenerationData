"The DFT calculations were performed to obtain E and Ea of 89 elementary reaction steps relevant to possible pathways for dry reforming of CH3CH3 by CO2 on the PtNi(111) surface."
"Depending on the products, the reaction can be grouped into two pathways: (1) production of CH2CH2 via the oxidative C-H bond cleavage pathway (Figure 1); (2) production of syngas via the C-C bond cleavage pathway (Figures 2 and 3)."
"The oxidation of C2Hx for the production of C2HxO intermediates is essential to promote the C-C bond cleavage and therefore the production of syngas."
"According to the DFT-calculated activation barriers the most favorable pathway to produce CH2CH2 on PtNi(111) is via two successive but selective C-H bond cleavage of *CH3CH3 (highlighted in blue, Figure 1)."
"Direct dissociation of *CO2 is also important, which is the primary source for CO and provides *O species to facilitate the formation of *C2HyO intermediates for syngas production."

The oxidative C-H and C-C bond cleavage of ethane on a PtNi(111) model surface using CO2 as an oxidant proceeds through distinct pathways to produce either syngas or ethylene. The key steps involve CO2 activation, leading to the formation of oxygen species, which play a crucial role in both pathways. 

For the formation of syngas, the process begins with the oxidative C-C bond cleavage of ethane. This is facilitated by the formation of *C2HyO intermediates, which are produced via the oxidation of *C2Hy species. The direct dissociation of CO2 also contributes significantly to CO production, providing oxygen for the formation of these intermediates. 

The mechanism differs for ethylene formation, which occurs via the oxidative C-H bond cleavage pathway. This involves the selective C-H bond scission of ethane, leading to the production of ethylene and CO. The formation of *C2HyO intermediates is still essential, but their role is different compared to syngas production. The oxygen species derived from CO2 activation assist in the oxidation of the *C2Hy intermediates, which ultimately leads to ethylene formation.

In terms of catalyst regeneration, the literature focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, exhibit high reactivity and efficiency in CO2 activation, facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. These catalysts are capable of converting CO2 to CO, providing the oxygen necessary for the reaction.

Redox-inactive catalysts, like CeO2, are less efficient in CO2 activation but still play a role in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. They might require additional oxygen sources for the reaction to proceed effectively. Transition metal clusters, on the other hand, offer a balance between activity and stability, potentially enabling efficient propane dehydrogenation with CO2.

The literature does not provide specific details on the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation or the mechanisms of catalyst regeneration. However, it suggests that the choice of catalyst and its properties (redox activity, oxygen storage capacity, and stability) significantly impact the effectiveness of CO2 activation and the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

在铂镍111模型表面上使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂对乙烷进行氧化C-H和C-C键断裂的过程分为两条主要路径，分别用于生成合成气或乙烯。关键步骤涉及二氧化碳活化，导致氧气物种的形成，这对两个路径都至关重要。

为了生成合成气，过程开始于乙烷的氧化C-C键断裂。这由*C2HyO中间体的形成促进，这些中间体通过氧化*C2Hy物种产生。直接二氧化碳解离也对二氧化碳的生产至关重要，提供了形成这些中间体所需的氧气。

对于乙烯形成，该途径涉及选择性C-H键断裂的乙烷，导致乙烯和二氧化碳的生成。*C2HyO中间体的形成仍然是关键的，但它们的作用与合成气生成不同。氧气物种源自二氧化碳活化协助氧化*C2Hy中间体，最终导致乙烯形成。

关于催化剂再生，文献关注于使用红氧化合物和非红氧化合物金属氧化物催化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢。红氧化合物催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，显示出高活性和效率，能够促进二氧化碳活化，有效催化丙烷氧化脱氢。这些催化剂能够将二氧化碳转化为二氧化碳，提供反应所需的氧气。

非红氧化合物催化剂，如CeO2，在二氧化碳活化方面效率较低，但仍参与氧化脱氢过程。它们可能需要额外的氧气来源以使反应顺利进行。过渡金属簇则提供了一种平衡活性和稳定性的解决方案，可能允许高效地利用二氧化碳进行丙烷脱氢。

文献没有提供二氧化碳解离的能量壁垒或催化剂再生机制的具体细节。然而，它表明催化剂的选择及其特性（红氧化合物活性、氧气存储能力和稳定性）显著影响二氧化碳活化效果和氧化脱氢过程的效率。
