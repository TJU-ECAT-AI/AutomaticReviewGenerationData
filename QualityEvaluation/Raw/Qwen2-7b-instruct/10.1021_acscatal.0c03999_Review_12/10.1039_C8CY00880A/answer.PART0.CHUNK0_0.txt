[1] "Our calculations show that PtNi is selective to CO via direct CO2 dissociation and the oxidative C-C bond scission of CH3CH3 via the oxygenated (*C2HyO) intermediates."
[2] "The high selectivity toward syngas estimated theoretically as well as observed experimentally depends on the capability of PtNi alloy in promoting C-O bond formation between *C2Hy intermediates and *O and producing the critical *C2HyO intermediates to facilitate the C-C bond cleavage."
[3] "Indeed, for CO2 reduction by ethane (see Section 3.2), it is able to describe well the selectivity of PtNi/CeO2 reported experimentally, based on combined DFT and KMC simulations under similar reaction conditions."

1. The mechanism of CF bond cleavage involves the activation of CO2 on a PtNi(111) model catalyst, leading to the oxidative C-C bond scission of fluoroacetate. This process is facilitated by the formation of oxygenated (*C2HyO) intermediates.

2. The PtNi(111) catalyst is selective for CO production via direct CO2 dissociation and for syngas production through the oxidative C-C bond cleavage of ethane, facilitated by *C2HyO intermediates. The selectivity towards syngas is influenced by the capability of the catalyst to form and utilize *C2HyO intermediates effectively.

3. The computational methods employed in this study encompass density functional theory (DFT) calculations for energy estimations and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations for reaction kinetics under experimental conditions.

4. DFT calculations revealed that CO2 activation involves direct dissociation to form CO and *O. The dehydrogenation of ethane proceeds via sequential C-H bond cleavages, with CO2 assisting in the process. Oxidative C2Hx to C2HxO intermediates are crucial for syngas production.

5. The KMC simulations highlighted that the dominant pathway for CO production involves *CH3CH2 → *CH3CH2O → *CH3CHO → *CH3CO → *CH2CO → *CHCO → *CH+*CO/*CCO → *C + *CO. For syngas production, *CH3CH2O intermediates play a key role in facilitating the oxidative C-C bond cleavage of ethane.

6. The selectivity towards CH2CH2 is primarily controlled by the promotion of the C-H bond scission of *CH3CH2 to produce *CH2CH2. To enhance the syngas selectivity, it is essential to facilitate the reaction between *C2Hy and *O, promoting the formation of *C2HyO intermediates.

7. The study concluded that the combined DFT-KMC approach elucidates the complex reaction mechanisms of ethane activation by CO2 on PtNi(111), identifying the key factors controlling the selectivity towards syngas and CH2CH2 production.
