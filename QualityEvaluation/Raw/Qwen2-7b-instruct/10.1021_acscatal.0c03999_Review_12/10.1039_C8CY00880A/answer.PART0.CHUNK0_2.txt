[1] "Ethane (CH3CH3), one of the primary components of shale gas, is an attractive candidate for the production of syngas (CO + H2) and ethylene (CH2CH2) via the selective C-C and C-H bond cleavage, respectively."
[2] "The reaction can occur via two distinct pathways: (1) the C-C bond cleavage of CH3CH3 (i.e. the reforming reaction) to produce synthesis gas (syngas: CO + H2), precursors for the production of long-chain hydrocarbons by the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis15, 16, and (2) oxidative C-H bond cleavage of CH3CH3 (i.e. the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction) to produce ethylene (CH2CH2 + CO + H2O),12, 17, 18, an important building block in chemical industry for the production of chemicals such as polyethylene,ethylene oxide, styrene, acetaldehyde, vinyl acetate, ethanol, and ethylbenzene, etc.19"
[3] "Under the conditions of CH3CH3 dry reforming using CO2, bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts supported on CeO2 (PtNi/CeO2 and PtCo/CeO2 in our notation) were shown previously to promote the oxidative C-C bond cleavage of CH3CH3 to produce  syngas while FeNi/CeO2 catalysts favored the oxidative C-H bond cleavage to produce CH2CH2.22"
[4] "The high selectivity toward syngas estimated theoretically as well as observed experimentally depends on the capability of PtNi alloy in promoting C-O bond formation between *C2Hy intermediates and *O and producing the critical *C2HyO intermediates to facilitate the C-C bond cleavage."
[5] "The KMC results show that the production of CH2CH2 occurs via two successive but selective C-H bond scission reactions of *CH3CH3. To produce syngas from CH3CH3 activation, *CH3CH3 primarily undergoes the C-C bond scission of *C2HyO intermediates produced via the C-H bond scission and *O insertion reactions of *C2Hy species."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, typically involve the reduction of the metal oxide to form active sites that can interact with the alkane and CO2. This process often includes the formation of oxides and subsequent redox cycling to regenerate the active sites. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 rely on the interaction of the alkane with the surface without undergoing significant redox changes. Instead, the catalyst facilitates the activation of CO2 through adsorption and subsequent reaction, without the need for redox cycling.

For CO2 activation, redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 often require the formation of oxides that can facilitate the dissociation of CO2. This is followed by the interaction of the alkane with the active sites, leading to selective C-H bond cleavage. Redox-inactive catalysts, on the other hand, might involve the adsorption of CO2 and subsequent reaction without the need for redox changes, often leading to the formation of active intermediates that can participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

In terms of effectiveness, different catalysts such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters exhibit varying degrees of efficiency in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. For instance, transition metal clusters like PtNi can be highly effective in promoting CO2 dissociation to form CO and O species, which then facilitate the oxidative C-C bond cleavage of propane to produce syngas. Meanwhile, catalysts like CeO2 might be more effective in facilitating the oxidative C-H bond cleavage of propane to produce ethylene, depending on the specific conditions and the nature of the catalyst.

The proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation play a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of these catalysts. For instance, the ability of the catalyst to efficiently reduce CO2 to CO and O species can greatly influence the selectivity towards syngas production. Similarly, the capability of the catalyst to form and maintain active sites that can interact with the alkane and promote the desired C-H or C-C bond cleavage is also critical.

In summary, the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by the nature of the catalyst, its ability to facilitate CO2 dissociation, and the specific mechanisms involved in the activation of the alkane and subsequent bond cleavage. The use of a combination of DFT calculations and KMC simulations can provide valuable insights into the complex reaction kinetics and help in identifying key descriptors to tune the catalytic selectivity for these processes.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢中，活性和非活性氧化物催化剂中的C-H键激活和催化剂再生机制存在显著差异。活性氧化物催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，通常涉及金属氧化物的还原形成活性位点，这些位点可以与烷烃和CO2相互作用。这个过程通常包括氧化物的形成和随后的氧化还原循环以再生活性位点。相比之下，非活性氧化物催化剂如CeO2主要依赖于烷烃与表面的相互作用而无需经历显著的氧化还原变化。相反，催化剂通过吸附和后续反应激活CO2，而无需进行氧化还原循环，这通常导致形成参与氧化脱氢过程的活性中间体。

对于CO2的激活，活性氧化物催化剂如V2O5和VOx/SiO2往往需要形成可以促进CO2分解的氧化物。随后是烷烃与活性位点的相互作用，导致选择性的C-H键断裂。非活性催化剂可能涉及CO2的吸附和随后的反应，而无需进行氧化还原变化，这可能导致形成可以参与氧化脱氢过程的活性中间体。

在有效性方面，不同的催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇，在丙烷氧化脱氢中激活CO2的有效性表现出不同的程度。例如，PtNi等过渡金属簇在促进CO2分解形成CO和O物种方面可能是高度有效的，这些物种随后可以促进丙烷的氧化C-C键裂解生成合成气。另一方面，像CeO2这样的催化剂可能在促进丙烷的氧化C-H键裂解生成乙烯方面更为有效，具体取决于特定条件和催化剂的性质。

激活CO2的提议机制和能量壁垒在确定不同催化剂有效性时起着关键作用。例如，催化剂有效降低CO2到CO和O物种的能力可以极大地影响选择性向合成气生产的倾向。同样，催化剂形成和维持可以与烷烃相互作用并促进所需C-H或C-C键断裂的活性位点的能力也至关重要。

综上所述，不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中激活CO2的有效性受到催化剂的性质、其激活CO2的能力以及在激活烷烃和后续键断裂过程中所涉及的具体机制的影响。使用密度泛函理论计算和蒙特卡洛模拟的组合可以提供有关复杂反应动力学的有价值见解，并帮助识别调节催化选择性的关键描述符。
