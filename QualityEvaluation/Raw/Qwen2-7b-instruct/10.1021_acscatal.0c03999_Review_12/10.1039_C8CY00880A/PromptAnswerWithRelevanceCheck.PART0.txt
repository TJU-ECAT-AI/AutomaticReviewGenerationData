The document discusses the mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes using both redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, typically utilize traditional oxidants for activation. These catalysts are effective in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane through direct CO2 dissociation. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation play a crucial role in determining the efficiency of these catalysts. For instance, V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 can facilitate CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, which then aid in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

On the other hand, redox-inactive catalysts, such as CeO2, rely on CO2 as the primary oxidant. The document explains that the effectiveness of CeO2 in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation depends on the formation of *C2HyO intermediates through the C-H bond scission and O insertion reactions of *C2Hy species. These intermediates are crucial for the C-C bond cleavage and subsequent syngas production. The document further elucidates that the selectivity towards syngas can be enhanced by promoting the formation of *C2HyO intermediates, possibly through increasing the amount of both *C2Hy and *O species or lowering the barriers for *O insertion.

Transition metal clusters, like PtNi, also play a significant role in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation. The document indicates that PtNi is selective for CO via direct CO2 dissociation and for the oxidative C-C bond scission of CH3CH3 via the formation of oxygenated (*C2HyO) intermediates. The direct dissociation of CO2 is highlighted as a primary source for CO and provides *O species to facilitate the formation of *C2HyO intermediates for syngas production. The selectivity towards syngas can be improved by enhancing the reaction between *C2Hy and *O, either by increasing their amounts or reducing the barriers for *O insertion.

In summary, the document provides insights into the mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation using different types of catalysts, emphasizing the importance of CO2 activation and the role of *C2HyO intermediates in the selective production of syngas. Catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2 utilize traditional oxidants for CO2 activation, while PtNi and other transition metal clusters activate CO2 through direct dissociation and the formation of oxygenated intermediates.

文档讨论了使用活性和非活性氧化还原催化剂的烷烃氧化脱氢的机制。活性氧化还原催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，通常利用传统氧化剂激活。这些催化剂通过直接CO2分解有效激活CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢。CO2分解的能量壁垒在确定这些催化剂效率方面起着关键作用。例如，V2O5和VOx/SiO2可以促进CO2分解形成CO和O，这随后有助于氧化脱氢过程。

另一方面，非活性氧化还原催化剂，如CeO2，依赖于CO2作为主要氧化剂。文档解释了CeO2激活CO2进行氧化脱氢的有效性取决于*C2HyO中间体的形成，这些中间体是通过*C2Hy物种的C-H键断裂和O插入反应形成的。这些中间体对于C-C键断裂和随后的合成气生产至关重要。文档进一步阐述，可以通过促进*C2HyO中间体的形成来增强选择性向合成气，可能通过增加*C2Hy和*O物种的数量或降低*O插入壁垒。

过渡金属簇，如PtNi，在激活CO2进行氧化脱氢中也发挥重要作用。文档表明，PtNi对于CO通过直接CO2分解选择性，以及通过氧气化*C2HyO中间体进行C-C键断裂的氧化脱氢选择性。直接CO2分解被强调为CO的主要来源，并提供了*O物种以促进*C2HyO中间体的形成以产生合成气。选择性向合成气可以通过增强*C2Hy和*O之间的反应来提高，无论是通过增加它们的数量还是通过降低*O插入壁垒。

简而言之，文档提供了使用不同类型催化剂的氧化脱氢机制的见解，强调了CO2激活的重要性以及*C2HyO中间体在选择性合成气生成中的作用。像V2O5、VOx/SiO2和CeO2这样的催化剂利用传统氧化剂激活CO2，而像PtNi和其他过渡金属簇这样的催化剂通过直接分解和形成氧气化中间体激活CO2。

[1] "Ethane (CH3CH3), one of the primary components of shale gas, is an attractive candidate for the production of syngas (CO + H2) and ethylene (CH2CH2) via the selective C-C and C-H bond cleavage, respectively."
[2] "The reaction can occur via two distinct pathways: (1) the C-C bond cleavage of CH3CH3 (i.e. the reforming reaction) to produce synthesis gas (syngas: CO + H2), precursors for the production of long-chain hydrocarbons by the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis15, 16, and (2) oxidative C-H bond cleavage of CH3CH3 (i.e. the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction) to produce ethylene (CH2CH2 + CO + H2O),12, 17, 18, an important building block in chemical industry for the production of chemicals such as polyethylene,ethylene oxide, styrene, acetaldehyde, vinyl acetate, ethanol, and ethylbenzene, etc.19"
[3] "Under the conditions of CH3CH3 dry reforming using CO2, bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts supported on CeO2 (PtNi/CeO2 and PtCo/CeO2 in our notation) were shown previously to promote the oxidative C-C bond cleavage of CH3CH3 to produce  syngas while FeNi/CeO2 catalysts favored the oxidative C-H bond cleavage to produce CH2CH2.22"
[4] "The high selectivity toward syngas estimated theoretically as well as observed experimentally depends on the capability of PtNi alloy in promoting C-O bond formation between *C2Hy intermediates and *O and producing the critical *C2HyO intermediates to facilitate the C-C bond cleavage."
[5] "The KMC results show that the production of CH2CH2 occurs via two successive but selective C-H bond scission reactions of *CH3CH3. To produce syngas from CH3CH3 activation, *CH3CH3 primarily undergoes the C-C bond scission of *C2HyO intermediates produced via the C-H bond scission and *O insertion reactions of *C2Hy species."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, typically involve the reduction of the metal oxide to form active sites that can interact with the alkane and CO2. This process often includes the formation of oxides and subsequent redox cycling to regenerate the active sites. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 rely on the interaction of the alkane with the surface without undergoing significant redox changes. Instead, the catalyst facilitates the activation of CO2 through adsorption and subsequent reaction, without the need for redox cycling.

For CO2 activation, redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 often require the formation of oxides that can facilitate the dissociation of CO2. This is followed by the interaction of the alkane with the active sites, leading to selective C-H bond cleavage. Redox-inactive catalysts, on the other hand, might involve the adsorption of CO2 and subsequent reaction without the need for redox changes, often leading to the formation of active intermediates that can participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

In terms of effectiveness, different catalysts such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters exhibit varying degrees of efficiency in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. For instance, transition metal clusters like PtNi can be highly effective in promoting CO2 dissociation to form CO and O species, which then facilitate the oxidative C-C bond cleavage of propane to produce syngas. Meanwhile, catalysts like CeO2 might be more effective in facilitating the oxidative C-H bond cleavage of propane to produce ethylene, depending on the specific conditions and the nature of the catalyst.

The proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation play a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of these catalysts. For instance, the ability of the catalyst to efficiently reduce CO2 to CO and O species can greatly influence the selectivity towards syngas production. Similarly, the capability of the catalyst to form and maintain active sites that can interact with the alkane and promote the desired C-H or C-C bond cleavage is also critical.

In summary, the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by the nature of the catalyst, its ability to facilitate CO2 dissociation, and the specific mechanisms involved in the activation of the alkane and subsequent bond cleavage. The use of a combination of DFT calculations and KMC simulations can provide valuable insights into the complex reaction kinetics and help in identifying key descriptors to tune the catalytic selectivity for these processes.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢中，活性和非活性氧化物催化剂中的C-H键激活和催化剂再生机制存在显著差异。活性氧化物催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，通常涉及金属氧化物的还原形成活性位点，这些位点可以与烷烃和CO2相互作用。这个过程通常包括氧化物的形成和随后的氧化还原循环以再生活性位点。相比之下，非活性氧化物催化剂如CeO2主要依赖于烷烃与表面的相互作用而无需经历显著的氧化还原变化。相反，催化剂通过吸附和后续反应激活CO2，而无需进行氧化还原循环，这通常导致形成参与氧化脱氢过程的活性中间体。

对于CO2的激活，活性氧化物催化剂如V2O5和VOx/SiO2往往需要形成可以促进CO2分解的氧化物。随后是烷烃与活性位点的相互作用，导致选择性的C-H键断裂。非活性催化剂可能涉及CO2的吸附和随后的反应，而无需进行氧化还原变化，这可能导致形成可以参与氧化脱氢过程的活性中间体。

在有效性方面，不同的催化剂，如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇，在丙烷氧化脱氢中激活CO2的有效性表现出不同的程度。例如，PtNi等过渡金属簇在促进CO2分解形成CO和O物种方面可能是高度有效的，这些物种随后可以促进丙烷的氧化C-C键裂解生成合成气。另一方面，像CeO2这样的催化剂可能在促进丙烷的氧化C-H键裂解生成乙烯方面更为有效，具体取决于特定条件和催化剂的性质。

激活CO2的提议机制和能量壁垒在确定不同催化剂有效性时起着关键作用。例如，催化剂有效降低CO2到CO和O物种的能力可以极大地影响选择性向合成气生产的倾向。同样，催化剂形成和维持可以与烷烃相互作用并促进所需C-H或C-C键断裂的活性位点的能力也至关重要。

综上所述，不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中激活CO2的有效性受到催化剂的性质、其激活CO2的能力以及在激活烷烃和后续键断裂过程中所涉及的具体机制的影响。使用密度泛函理论计算和蒙特卡洛模拟的组合可以提供有关复杂反应动力学的有价值见解，并帮助识别调节催化选择性的关键描述符。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The oxidative C-H and C-C bond cleavage of ethane on a PtNi(111) model surface using CO2 as an oxidant proceeds through distinct pathways to produce either syngas or ethylene. The key steps involve CO2 activation, leading to the formation of oxygen species, which play a crucial role in both pathways. 

For the formation of syngas, the process begins with the oxidative C-C bond cleavage of ethane. This is facilitated by the formation of *C2HyO intermediates, which are produced via the oxidation of *C2Hy species. The direct dissociation of CO2 also contributes significantly to CO production, providing oxygen for the formation of these intermediates. 

The mechanism differs for ethylene formation, which occurs via the oxidative C-H bond cleavage pathway. This involves the selective C-H bond scission of ethane, leading to the production of ethylene and CO. The formation of *C2HyO intermediates is still essential, but their role is different compared to syngas production. The oxygen species derived from CO2 activation assist in the oxidation of the *C2Hy intermediates, which ultimately leads to ethylene formation.

In terms of catalyst regeneration, the literature focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, exhibit high reactivity and efficiency in CO2 activation, facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. These catalysts are capable of converting CO2 to CO, providing the oxygen necessary for the reaction.

Redox-inactive catalysts, like CeO2, are less efficient in CO2 activation but still play a role in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. They might require additional oxygen sources for the reaction to proceed effectively. Transition metal clusters, on the other hand, offer a balance between activity and stability, potentially enabling efficient propane dehydrogenation with CO2.

The literature does not provide specific details on the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation or the mechanisms of catalyst regeneration. However, it suggests that the choice of catalyst and its properties (redox activity, oxygen storage capacity, and stability) significantly impact the effectiveness of CO2 activation and the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

在铂镍111模型表面上使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂对乙烷进行氧化C-H和C-C键断裂的过程分为两条主要路径，分别用于生成合成气或乙烯。关键步骤涉及二氧化碳活化，导致氧气物种的形成，这对两个路径都至关重要。

为了生成合成气，过程开始于乙烷的氧化C-C键断裂。这由*C2HyO中间体的形成促进，这些中间体通过氧化*C2Hy物种产生。直接二氧化碳解离也对二氧化碳的生产至关重要，提供了形成这些中间体所需的氧气。

对于乙烯形成，该途径涉及选择性C-H键断裂的乙烷，导致乙烯和二氧化碳的生成。*C2HyO中间体的形成仍然是关键的，但它们的作用与合成气生成不同。氧气物种源自二氧化碳活化协助氧化*C2Hy中间体，最终导致乙烯形成。

关于催化剂再生，文献关注于使用红氧化合物和非红氧化合物金属氧化物催化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢。红氧化合物催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，显示出高活性和效率，能够促进二氧化碳活化，有效催化丙烷氧化脱氢。这些催化剂能够将二氧化碳转化为二氧化碳，提供反应所需的氧气。

非红氧化合物催化剂，如CeO2，在二氧化碳活化方面效率较低，但仍参与氧化脱氢过程。它们可能需要额外的氧气来源以使反应顺利进行。过渡金属簇则提供了一种平衡活性和稳定性的解决方案，可能允许高效地利用二氧化碳进行丙烷脱氢。

文献没有提供二氧化碳解离的能量壁垒或催化剂再生机制的具体细节。然而，它表明催化剂的选择及其特性（红氧化合物活性、氧气存储能力和稳定性）显著影响二氧化碳活化效果和氧化脱氢过程的效率。
