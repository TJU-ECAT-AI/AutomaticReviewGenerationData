Henry H. Hwu, Joseph Eng, and Jingguang G. Chen discuss the unique chemistry of the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface. They utilize the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of cyclohexene as probe reactions to compare the chemical reactivity of Ni overlayers grown epitaxially on a Pt(111) surface.

This study provides conclusive spectroscopic evidence that the adsorption and subsequent reactions of cyclohexene are unique on the monolayer Ni surface compared to those on the clean Pt(111) surface or the thick Ni(111) film. The authors observe that cyclohexene is weakly π-bonded on monolayer Ni/Pt(111) but di-σ-bonded to Pt(111) and Ni(111). They also detect a new hydrogenation pathway on the monolayer Ni surface at temperatures as low as 245 K.

Our results clearly showed that the reactivity of the bimetallic Ni/Pt surfaces, at near monolayer Ni coverages, is substantially different from that of either Ni(111) or Pt(111). Using D2 as a probe molecule, we compared the relative binding energies of atomic deuterium by following its recombinative desorption from Pt(111), thick Ni/Pt(111), and a Ni/Pt(111) surface with a monolayer Ni coverage.

The reaction pathway of cyclohexene on the monolayer Ni surface is drastically different from Pt(111) or thick Ni(111) film in several aspects: (1) Both HREELS and NEXAFS results reveal that cyclohexene is weakly π-bonded to the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface at temperatures up to 200 K. (2) TPD measurements detect several gas-phase products at low temperatures, cyclohexane at 245 K, H2 at 259 K, and the desorption of benzene at an onset temperature of 261 K.

The authors propose that the unique chemistry of the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface is most likely related to the fact that the bonding between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni surface is weaker than that on either Pt(111) or the thick Ni(111) film. This weaker bonding contributes to the distinct chemical behavior of the surface.
