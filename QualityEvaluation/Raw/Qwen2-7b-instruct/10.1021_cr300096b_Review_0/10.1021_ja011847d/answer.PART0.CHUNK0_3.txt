Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those with a monolayer Ni overlay on a Pt substrate, exhibit distinct electronic and chemical properties that differ significantly from both single-metal catalysts and thick Ni films. These unique properties, characterized by weaker interactions between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni surface, enable the catalysts to perform chemical reactions that are distinct from those on either pure Pt or thick Ni surfaces. For instance, cyclohexene adsorption and subsequent reactions on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface result in weak π-bonding, leading to a new hydrogenation pathway at lower temperatures, enhanced cyclohexane production upon pre-exposure to deuterium, and a specific product selectivity profile. These findings suggest that the unique chemistry of monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surfaces can bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrial catalysts, offering potential for improved performance in both fundamental research and practical applications.

双金属催化剂，特别是具有单层Ni覆盖在Pt基底上的催化剂，表现出与单金属催化剂和厚Ni薄膜截然不同的电子和化学特性。这些独特的性质，体现在与单层Ni表面之间较弱的吸附剂相互作用上，使催化剂能够执行与纯Pt或厚Ni表面不同的化学反应。例如，环己烯在单层Ni/Pt(111)表面上的吸附及其后续反应导致弱π键形成，从而在较低温度下产生新的氢化途径、预暴露于重水后增强的环己烷产量以及特定的产品选择性分布。这些发现表明，单层Ni/Pt(111)表面的独特化学性质可以跨越“材料差距”和“压力差距”，将模型表面与工业催化剂联系起来，为基础研究和实际应用提供潜在改进性能的机会。
