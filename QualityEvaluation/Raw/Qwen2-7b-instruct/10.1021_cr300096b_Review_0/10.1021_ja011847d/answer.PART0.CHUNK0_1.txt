<p>The reaction pathway of cyclohexene on the monolayer Ni surface is drastically different from Pt(111) or thick Ni(111) film in several aspects: (1) Both HREELS (Figure 6) and NEXAFS (Figure 8) results reveal that cyclohexene is weakly π-bonded to the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface at temperatures up to 200 K. (2) TPD measurements (Figures 1 and 2) detect several gas-phase products at low temperatures, cyclohexane at 245 K, H2 at 259 K, and the desorption of benzene at an onset temperature of 261 K. (3) The product selectivity (Tables 3 and 4) is approximately 9% for cyclohexane and 89% for gas-phase benzene, with only a negligible amount (2%) of adsorbed cyclohexane undergoing complete decomposition to produce atomic carbon and hydrogen. (4) The overall surface activity (Tables 3 and 4), as compared in the common unit of number of cyclohexene molecules undergoing reactions on a per metal atom basis, is lower on monolayer Ni (0.097 per Pt atom) than on the thick Ni(111) film (0.112 per Ni atom).</p>

The unique chemistry of the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface, compared to either the Pt(111) or the thick Ni(111) film, is characterized by several distinct features. Firstly, cyclohexene molecules exhibit a weak π-bonding to the monolayer Ni surface, as evidenced by HREELS and NEXAFS spectroscopy results. Secondly, TPD measurements indicate the presence of multiple gas-phase products at low temperatures, including cyclohexane, hydrogen, and benzene. Thirdly, the product selectivity is skewed towards the formation of gas-phase benzene, with a significant yield of cyclohexane at a low temperature, and a negligible amount of cyclohexene undergoing complete decomposition. Lastly, the overall surface activity, measured in terms of the number of cyclohexene molecules reacting per metal atom, is lower on the monolayer Ni surface compared to the thick Ni(111) film.

与Pt(111)或厚Ni(111)薄膜相比，单层Ni/Pt(111)表面的独特化学性质体现在几个不同的方面。首先，HREELS和NEXAFS光谱结果显示，环己烯分子在单层Ni表面上以较弱的π键形式吸附。其次，通过TPD测量发现，在较低温度下存在多个气相产物，包括环己烷、氢和苯。第三，产物选择性倾向于生成气相苯，且在较低温度下有显著的环己烷产率，而环己烯完全分解的比例极低。最后，根据每金属原子反应的环己烯分子数量衡量的总表面活性，单层Ni表面的活性低于厚Ni(111)薄膜。
