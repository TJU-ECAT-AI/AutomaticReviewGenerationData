[1] "Our results clearly showed that the reactivity of the bimetallic Ni/Pt surfaces, at near monolayer Ni coverages, is substantially different from that of either Ni(111) or Pt(111)."
[2] "By exposing the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface to D2 prior to the adsorption of cyclohexene, the total yield of the normal and deuterated cyclohexanes increases by approximately 5-fold."
[3] "The unique chemistry of the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface can be explained by the weaker interaction between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni film."
[4] "These results also point out the possibility of manipulating the chemical properties of metals by controlling the overlayer thickness."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The unique chemistry of the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface is attributed to the weaker interaction between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni film, which leads to differences in reactivity compared to either Ni(111) or Pt(111). By exposing the surface to D2 before adsorbing cyclohexene, the yield of cyclohexane products increases by approximately 5-fold. This demonstrates the possibility of controlling chemical properties through the thickness of the overlayer.

单层Ni/Pt(111)表面的独特化学性质归因于吸附剂与单层Ni薄膜之间较弱的相互作用，这导致了与Ni(111)或Pt(111)相比的反应性差异。通过在吸附环己烯之前将表面暴露于D2，环己烷产品的产率增加了约5倍。这表明可以通过控制覆层厚度来控制化学性质的可能性。

<p>The reaction pathway of cyclohexene on the monolayer Ni surface is drastically different from Pt(111) or thick Ni(111) film in several aspects: (1) Both HREELS (Figure 6) and NEXAFS (Figure 8) results reveal that cyclohexene is weakly π-bonded to the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface at temperatures up to 200 K. (2) TPD measurements (Figures 1 and 2) detect several gas-phase products at low temperatures, cyclohexane at 245 K, H2 at 259 K, and the desorption of benzene at an onset temperature of 261 K. (3) The product selectivity (Tables 3 and 4) is approximately 9% for cyclohexane and 89% for gas-phase benzene, with only a negligible amount (2%) of adsorbed cyclohexane undergoing complete decomposition to produce atomic carbon and hydrogen. (4) The overall surface activity (Tables 3 and 4), as compared in the common unit of number of cyclohexene molecules undergoing reactions on a per metal atom basis, is lower on monolayer Ni (0.097 per Pt atom) than on the thick Ni(111) film (0.112 per Ni atom).</p>

The unique chemistry of the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface, compared to either the Pt(111) or the thick Ni(111) film, is characterized by several distinct features. Firstly, cyclohexene molecules exhibit a weak π-bonding to the monolayer Ni surface, as evidenced by HREELS and NEXAFS spectroscopy results. Secondly, TPD measurements indicate the presence of multiple gas-phase products at low temperatures, including cyclohexane, hydrogen, and benzene. Thirdly, the product selectivity is skewed towards the formation of gas-phase benzene, with a significant yield of cyclohexane at a low temperature, and a negligible amount of cyclohexene undergoing complete decomposition. Lastly, the overall surface activity, measured in terms of the number of cyclohexene molecules reacting per metal atom, is lower on the monolayer Ni surface compared to the thick Ni(111) film.

与Pt(111)或厚Ni(111)薄膜相比，单层Ni/Pt(111)表面的独特化学性质体现在几个不同的方面。首先，HREELS和NEXAFS光谱结果显示，环己烯分子在单层Ni表面上以较弱的π键形式吸附。其次，通过TPD测量发现，在较低温度下存在多个气相产物，包括环己烷、氢和苯。第三，产物选择性倾向于生成气相苯，且在较低温度下有显著的环己烷产率，而环己烯完全分解的比例极低。最后，根据每金属原子反应的环己烯分子数量衡量的总表面活性，单层Ni表面的活性低于厚Ni(111)薄膜。

Henry H. Hwu, Joseph Eng, and Jingguang G. Chen have demonstrated that the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface is characterized by unique chemical properties distinct from those of either Pt(111) or the thick Ni(111) film. The authors provide conclusive spectroscopic evidence showing that cyclohexene molecules are weakly π-bonded to the monolayer Ni surface at temperatures up to 200 K. This unique chemistry is reflected in the desorption of benzene and hydrogen, as well as the detection of a new gas-phase cyclohexane product at temperatures between approximately 245-261 K. The product selectivity for gas-phase cyclohexane is about 9% on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface. The authors attribute the unique chemistry to the weaker bonding between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni surface, which they are currently investigating further through systematic NEXAFS and photoemission studies.

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those with a monolayer Ni overlay on a Pt substrate, exhibit distinct electronic and chemical properties that differ significantly from both single-metal catalysts and thick Ni films. These unique properties, characterized by weaker interactions between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni surface, enable the catalysts to perform chemical reactions that are distinct from those on either pure Pt or thick Ni surfaces. For instance, cyclohexene adsorption and subsequent reactions on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface result in weak π-bonding, leading to a new hydrogenation pathway at lower temperatures, enhanced cyclohexane production upon pre-exposure to deuterium, and a specific product selectivity profile. These findings suggest that the unique chemistry of monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surfaces can bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrial catalysts, offering potential for improved performance in both fundamental research and practical applications.

双金属催化剂，特别是具有单层Ni覆盖在Pt基底上的催化剂，表现出与单金属催化剂和厚Ni薄膜截然不同的电子和化学特性。这些独特的性质，体现在与单层Ni表面之间较弱的吸附剂相互作用上，使催化剂能够执行与纯Pt或厚Ni表面不同的化学反应。例如，环己烯在单层Ni/Pt(111)表面上的吸附及其后续反应导致弱π键形成，从而在较低温度下产生新的氢化途径、预暴露于重水后增强的环己烷产量以及特定的产品选择性分布。这些发现表明，单层Ni/Pt(111)表面的独特化学性质可以跨越“材料差距”和“压力差距”，将模型表面与工业催化剂联系起来，为基础研究和实际应用提供潜在改进性能的机会。
