[1] "Our results clearly showed that the reactivity of the bimetallic Ni/Pt surfaces, at near monolayer Ni coverages, is substantially different from that of either Ni(111) or Pt(111)."
[2] "By exposing the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface to D2 prior to the adsorption of cyclohexene, the total yield of the normal and deuterated cyclohexanes increases by approximately 5-fold."
[3] "The unique chemistry of the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface can be explained by the weaker interaction between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni film."
[4] "These results also point out the possibility of manipulating the chemical properties of metals by controlling the overlayer thickness."

The unique chemistry of the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface is attributed to the weaker interaction between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni film, which leads to differences in reactivity compared to either Ni(111) or Pt(111). By exposing the surface to D2 before adsorbing cyclohexene, the yield of cyclohexane products increases by approximately 5-fold. This demonstrates the possibility of controlling chemical properties through the thickness of the overlayer.

单层Ni/Pt(111)表面的独特化学性质归因于吸附剂与单层Ni薄膜之间较弱的相互作用，这导致了与Ni(111)或Pt(111)相比的反应性差异。通过在吸附环己烯之前将表面暴露于D2，环己烷产品的产率增加了约5倍。这表明可以通过控制覆层厚度来控制化学性质的可能性。
