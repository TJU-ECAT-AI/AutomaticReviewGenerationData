Henry H. Hwu, Joseph Eng, and Jingguang G. Chen have demonstrated that the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface is characterized by unique chemical properties distinct from those of either Pt(111) or the thick Ni(111) film. The authors provide conclusive spectroscopic evidence showing that cyclohexene molecules are weakly π-bonded to the monolayer Ni surface at temperatures up to 200 K. This unique chemistry is reflected in the desorption of benzene and hydrogen, as well as the detection of a new gas-phase cyclohexane product at temperatures between approximately 245-261 K. The product selectivity for gas-phase cyclohexane is about 9% on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface. The authors attribute the unique chemistry to the weaker bonding between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni surface, which they are currently investigating further through systematic NEXAFS and photoemission studies.

Henry H. Hwu，Joseph Eng和Jingguang G. Chen等人证明了单层Ni/Pt(111)表面具有与Pt(111)或厚Ni(111)薄膜截然不同的独特化学性质。作者提供了确凿的光谱学证据，表明环己烯分子在200 K以下的温度与单层Ni表面以较弱的π键结合。这种独特的化学特性体现在苯和氢的脱附以及在约245-261 K温度范围内检测到的新气态环己烷产物上。单层Ni/Pt(111)表面上的环己烷产物的选择性约为9%。作者将这种独特的化学性质归因于吸附剂与单层Ni表面之间较弱的结合力，他们目前正在通过系统性的NEXAFS和光电发射研究进一步探索这一现象。
