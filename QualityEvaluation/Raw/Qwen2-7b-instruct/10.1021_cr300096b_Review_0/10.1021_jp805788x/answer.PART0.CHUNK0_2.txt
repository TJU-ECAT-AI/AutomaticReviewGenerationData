The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by advancements in achieving near-monodisperse compositions and controlling synthesis processes. These catalysts, featuring unique electronic and chemical properties, have significantly contributed to closing the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their impact is evident in both fundamental research and practical applications, particularly in the efficient hydrogen generation process.
