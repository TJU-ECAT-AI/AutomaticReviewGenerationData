[1] "The need to develop alternative catalysts has been addressed here, using microkinetic modelling combined with density functional studies to identify suitable monolayer bimetallic (surface or subsurface) catalysts based on nitrogen binding energies."
[2] "The results reported here provide a framework for complex catalyst discovery. They also demonstrate the critical importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches for identifying desirable monolayer bimetallic systems when the surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals."
[3] "Monolayer bimetallic catalysts consist of a monolayer of an admetal in the top layers of a host metal."
[4] "In this study, we present full microkinetic models for NH3 decomposition on various single-metal catalysts, including Co, Pt, Pd, Ni, Ru, Rh, Ir, Re and Mo."
[5] "The TPD experiments indicate that a NiPtPt catalyst may be more active than Ru based on a lower nitrogen desorption temperature and a remarkably low dehydrogenation barrier."

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis has significantly advanced since their commercial introduction. These catalysts bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. They offer unique electronic and chemical properties that enhance their performance in both fundamental research and practical applications. By integrating microkinetic modeling with density functional studies, researchers can identify monolayer bimetallic catalysts that optimize nitrogen binding energies, leading to efficient ammonia decomposition processes. This approach combines theoretical predictions with experimental validation, providing a robust framework for catalyst discovery. Monolayer bimetallic systems, particularly those consisting of a monolayer of an admetal atop a host metal, have demonstrated exceptional activity, surpassing single-metal catalysts like ruthenium in ammonia decomposition reactions. The NiPtPt surface, for instance, exhibits lower nitrogen desorption temperatures and a remarkably low dehydrogenation barrier, making it a promising candidate for enhanced ammonia decomposition activity.

自商业应用以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化领域的演变取得了显著进步。这些催化剂成功地跨越了“材料差距”和“压力差距”，将模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂紧密连接起来。它们独特的电子和化学性质极大地提高了其在基础研究和实际应用中的性能。通过结合微观动力学建模和密度泛函研究，研究人员能够基于氮吸附能识别出适合氨分解的单层双金属催化剂。这种方法结合了理论预测和实验验证，为复杂催化剂的发现提供了坚实框架。特别是由一层吸附金属位于主金属顶层组成的单层双金属系统，在氨分解反应中表现出卓越的活性，超过了如钌这样的单一金属催化剂。NiPtPt表面就是一个典型的例子，它具有较低的氮脱附温度和异常低的脱氢化壁垒，显示出增强的氨分解活性潜力。
