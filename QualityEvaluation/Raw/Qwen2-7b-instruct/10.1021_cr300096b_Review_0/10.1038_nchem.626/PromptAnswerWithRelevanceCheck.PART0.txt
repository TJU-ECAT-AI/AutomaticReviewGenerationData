<p>Although Ru has the optimal heat of chemisorption among single metals, it is possible that bimetallic catalysts with higher activities might exist.</p>
<p>The CoMo bimetallic catalyst for the synthesis reaction was predicted through the concept of Periodic Table interpolation, in which the binding energy of a mixed metal (alloyed) surface is taken as a linear combination of the binding energies of the parent metals.</p>
<p>Monolayer bimetallic catalysts consist of a monolayer of an admetal in the top layers of a host metal.</p>
<p>These surfaces can be used to represent the segregated surface of an alloy or can be used to model coreshell bimetallic nanoparticles.</p>
<p>Owing to this nonlinear behaviour, there is currently no method to rationally design these novel catalysts.</p>
<p>Because the hydrogen interaction parameters are small, they have very little effect on the reaction mechanism and predicted ammonia conversions.</p>
<p>At the peak of the volcano curve (134 kcal mol1), the removal of the second hydrogen is the most significant elementary reaction step.</p>
<p>The sensitivity analysis shows that there are multiple kinetically significant reaction steps and their sensitivity changes across the volcano curve.</p>
<p>The nitrogen binding energies vary from 71 to 207 kcal mol1 by adding a second metal to the surface or subsurface layer of the Pt host.</p>
<p>The NiPtPt(111) bimetallic surface has a nitrogen binding energy of 130.7 kcal mol1, slightly lower than that of Ru, and is a potentially active catalyst.</p>

1. Bimetallic catalysts have evolved in heterogeneous catalysis by leveraging their unique electronic and chemical properties to address the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. This involves using theoretical approaches like microkinetic modeling and density functional studies to identify catalysts with optimized nitrogen binding energies. The combination of theoretical predictions with experimental validation ensures that the discovered catalysts perform well under industrial conditions, bridging the gap between lab-scale models and real-world applications.

2. The NiPtPt catalyst stands out as a promising alternative to Ru, showing enhanced activity in the ammonia decomposition reaction. This is due to its ability to facilitate easier dehydrogenation and nitrogen desorption, which are key steps in the reaction mechanism. The low nitrogen desorption temperature and the remarkably low dehydrogenation barrier indicate that NiPtPt could offer a more efficient pathway for ammonia decomposition compared to Ru, potentially making it a superior catalyst for practical applications in the hydrogen economy.

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis has significantly advanced since their commercial introduction. These catalysts bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. They offer unique electronic and chemical properties that enhance their performance in both fundamental research and practical applications. By integrating microkinetic modeling with density functional studies, researchers can identify monolayer bimetallic catalysts that optimize nitrogen binding energies, leading to efficient ammonia decomposition processes. This approach combines theoretical predictions with experimental validation, providing a robust framework for catalyst discovery. Monolayer bimetallic systems, particularly those consisting of a monolayer of an admetal atop a host metal, have demonstrated exceptional activity, surpassing single-metal catalysts like ruthenium in ammonia decomposition reactions. The NiPtPt surface, for instance, exhibits lower nitrogen desorption temperatures and a remarkably low dehydrogenation barrier, making it a promising candidate for enhanced ammonia decomposition activity.

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis has significantly advanced since their commercial introduction. These catalysts bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Bimetallic catalysts offer unique electronic and chemical properties that enhance their performance. For instance, the CoMo catalyst for the ammonia synthesis reaction was predicted through Periodic Table interpolation, suggesting that the binding energy of a mixed metal surface is a linear combination of the binding energies of its parent metals. Monolayer bimetallic catalysts, consisting of an admetal layer atop a host metal, can represent alloy surfaces or model core-shell nanoparticles. Due to their nonlinear behavior, rational design of these novel catalysts remains challenging. The integration of full microkinetic models, DFT predictions, and experimental validation represents a pioneering approach in identifying catalyst formulations and surface structures. This methodology enables a comprehensive understanding of reaction mechanisms and facilitates the development of highly active catalysts. For the ammonia decomposition reaction, the microkinetic models predict that the nitrogen binding energy is a key descriptor for identifying active catalyst surfaces. Notably, the NiPtPt(111) surface, with a nitrogen binding energy of 130.7 kcal mol1, demonstrates exceptional activity. The TPD experiments confirm that this catalyst outperforms Ru, featuring a lower nitrogen desorption temperature and an unusually low dehydrogenation barrier, highlighting the effectiveness of bimetallic catalysts in practical applications.
