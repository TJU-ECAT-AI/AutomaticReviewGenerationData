[1] "The need to develop alternative catalysts has been addressed here, using microkinetic modelling combined with density functional studies to identify suitable monolayer bimetallic (surface or subsurface) catalysts based on nitrogen binding energies."
[2] "The results reported here provide a framework for complex catalyst discovery. They also demonstrate the critical importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches for identifying desirable monolayer bimetallic systems when the surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals."
[3] "A sensitivity analysis was performed. The pre-exponentials of each forward and reverse elementary reaction step pair (Ai) (that is, R1 and R2, R3 and R4, and so on) were perturbed simultaneously, thus ensuring thermodynamic consistency."
[4] "Because the nitrogen binding energy is a good activity descriptor, a DFT search was performed to identify catalyst surfaces that have a similar binding energy to the optimal value of 134 kcal mol1."
[5] "The TPD experiments indicate that a NiPtPt catalyst may be more active than Ru based on a lower nitrogen desorption temperature and a remarkably low dehydrogenation barrier."

The document discusses the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. Since their commercial introduction, bimetallic catalysts have evolved to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to this evolution. The document emphasizes the importance of combining theoretical approaches, such as density functional studies and microkinetic modeling, with experimental techniques to identify effective bimetallic catalysts. These methods consider the non-linear relationship between surface properties and the parent metals. Additionally, the document highlights the use of sensitivity analysis to determine key reaction steps in the catalytic process. It also showcases the application of computational frameworks to predict active monolayer bimetallic surfaces, as demonstrated through the NiPtPt surface, which exhibits activity towards ammonia decomposition, potentially surpassing the activity of pure ruthenium catalysts.

文档讨论了异相催化中双金属催化剂的发展。自其商业化以来，双金属催化剂的发展旨在弥合模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。它们独特的电子和化学性质促进了这一发展。文档强调了将理论方法（如密度泛函研究和微观动力学建模）与实验技术相结合的重要性，以识别有效的双金属催化剂。这些方法考虑了表面性质与母金属之间非线性关系。此外，文档还提到了敏感性分析在确定催化过程关键反应步骤中的应用。它还展示了使用计算框架预测活性单层双金属表面的方法，正如通过NiPtPt表面所展示的，该表面表现出向氨分解的活性，可能超过纯钌催化剂的活性。
