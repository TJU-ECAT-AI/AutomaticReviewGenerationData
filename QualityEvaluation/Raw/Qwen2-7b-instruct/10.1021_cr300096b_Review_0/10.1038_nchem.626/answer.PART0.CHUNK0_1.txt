[1] "The need to develop alternative catalysts has been addressed here, using microkinetic modelling combined with density functional studies to identify suitable monolayer bimetallic (surface or subsurface) catalysts based on nitrogen binding energies."
[2] "The results reported here provide a framework for complex catalyst discovery. They also demonstrate the critical importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches for identifying desirable monolayer bimetallic systems when the surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals."
[3] "The TPD experiments indicate that a NiPtPt catalyst may be more active than Ru based on a lower nitrogen desorption temperature and a remarkably low dehydrogenation barrier."

1. Bimetallic catalysts have evolved in heterogeneous catalysis by leveraging their unique electronic and chemical properties to address the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. This involves using theoretical approaches like microkinetic modeling and density functional studies to identify catalysts with optimized nitrogen binding energies. The combination of theoretical predictions with experimental validation ensures that the discovered catalysts perform well under industrial conditions, bridging the gap between lab-scale models and real-world applications.

2. The NiPtPt catalyst stands out as a promising alternative to Ru, showing enhanced activity in the ammonia decomposition reaction. This is due to its ability to facilitate easier dehydrogenation and nitrogen desorption, which are key steps in the reaction mechanism. The low nitrogen desorption temperature and the remarkably low dehydrogenation barrier indicate that NiPtPt could offer a more efficient pathway for ammonia decomposition compared to Ru, potentially making it a superior catalyst for practical applications in the hydrogen economy.

1. 在异质催化中，双金属催化剂通过利用其独特的电子和化学性质来解决“材料差距”和“压力差距”，从而实现了进化。这涉及到使用理论方法（如微动力学建模和密度泛函研究）来识别基于氮吸附能的合适单层双金属（表面或亚表面）催化剂。理论预测与实验验证相结合的方法确保了发现的催化剂在工业条件下表现良好，成功地缩小了实验室模型与实际应用之间的差距。

2. NiPtPt 催化剂在氨分解反应中脱颖而出，显示出比Ru更高的活性。这是由于它能够更轻松地促进脱氢和氮解离，这两个是反应机制中的关键步骤。较低的氮解离温度和非常低的脱氢壁垒表明，NiPtPt 可以提供氨分解更为高效的途径，相比Ru可能具有更好的催化性能，潜在地成为氢经济领域中更具优势的催化剂。
