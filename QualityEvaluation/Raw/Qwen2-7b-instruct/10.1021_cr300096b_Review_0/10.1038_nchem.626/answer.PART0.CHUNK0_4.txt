The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis has significantly advanced since their commercial introduction. These catalysts bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Bimetallic catalysts offer unique electronic and chemical properties that enhance their performance. For instance, the CoMo catalyst for the ammonia synthesis reaction was predicted through Periodic Table interpolation, suggesting that the binding energy of a mixed metal surface is a linear combination of the binding energies of its parent metals. Monolayer bimetallic catalysts, consisting of an admetal layer atop a host metal, can represent alloy surfaces or model core-shell nanoparticles. Due to their nonlinear behavior, rational design of these novel catalysts remains challenging. The integration of full microkinetic models, DFT predictions, and experimental validation represents a pioneering approach in identifying catalyst formulations and surface structures. This methodology enables a comprehensive understanding of reaction mechanisms and facilitates the development of highly active catalysts. For the ammonia decomposition reaction, the microkinetic models predict that the nitrogen binding energy is a key descriptor for identifying active catalyst surfaces. Notably, the NiPtPt(111) surface, with a nitrogen binding energy of 130.7 kcal mol1, demonstrates exceptional activity. The TPD experiments confirm that this catalyst outperforms Ru, featuring a lower nitrogen desorption temperature and an unusually low dehydrogenation barrier, highlighting the effectiveness of bimetallic catalysts in practical applications.

自商用化以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化中的发展取得了显著进步。这些催化剂成功地跨越了模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。双金属催化剂独特的电子和化学性质极大地提升了其性能。例如，合成氨反应中的CoMo催化剂通过元素周期表插值预测，表明混合金属表面的结合能是其亲本金属结合能的线性组合。单层双金属催化剂由一层附加金属层位于主金属层顶部构成，可以代表合金表面或模拟核心壳双金属纳米颗粒。由于其非线性行为，对这些新型催化剂进行合理设计仍然具有挑战性。将全微动力学模型、DFT预测和实验验证相结合的方法是识别催化剂配方和表面结构的开创性方法。这种方法能够全面理解反应机制并促进活性催化剂的发展。对于氨分解反应，微动力学模型预测氮结合能是识别活性催化剂表面的关键描述符。值得注意的是，NiPtPt(111)表面，其氮结合能为130.7 kcal mol1，表现出卓越的活性。通过透射电镜实验验证，该催化剂比Ru更高效，具有更低的氮脱附温度和异常低的脱氢障碍，这凸显了双金属催化剂在实际应用中的有效性。
