<p>Although Ru has the optimal heat of chemisorption among single metals, it is possible that bimetallic catalysts with higher activities might exist.</p>
<p>The CoMo bimetallic catalyst for the synthesis reaction was predicted through the concept of Periodic Table interpolation, in which the binding energy of a mixed metal (alloyed) surface is taken as a linear combination of the binding energies of the parent metals.</p>
<p>Monolayer bimetallic catalysts consist of a monolayer of an admetal in the top layers of a host metal.</p>
<p>These surfaces can be used to represent the segregated surface of an alloy or can be used to model coreshell bimetallic nanoparticles.</p>
<p>Owing to this nonlinear behaviour, there is currently no method to rationally design these novel catalysts.</p>
<p>Because the hydrogen interaction parameters are small, they have very little effect on the reaction mechanism and predicted ammonia conversions.</p>
<p>At the peak of the volcano curve (134 kcal mol1), the removal of the second hydrogen is the most significant elementary reaction step.</p>
<p>The sensitivity analysis shows that there are multiple kinetically significant reaction steps and their sensitivity changes across the volcano curve.</p>
<p>The nitrogen binding energies vary from 71 to 207 kcal mol1 by adding a second metal to the surface or subsurface layer of the Pt host.</p>
<p>The NiPtPt(111) bimetallic surface has a nitrogen binding energy of 130.7 kcal mol1, slightly lower than that of Ru, and is a potentially active catalyst.</p>
<p>The TPD experiments indicate that a NiPtPt catalyst may be more active than Ru based on a lower nitrogen desorption temperature and a remarkably low dehydrogenation barrier.</p>

1. Bimetallic catalysts offer unique electronic and chemical properties that help bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrial catalysts. Their ability to combine the characteristics of two different metals can lead to improved performance and efficiency in heterogeneous catalysis.
2. The development of bimetallic catalysts has significantly advanced the field of heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, offering a wider range of chemical functionalities and reaction rates compared to single-metal catalysts. Their properties enable better control over the reaction pathways, leading to enhanced selectivity and yield in various industrial processes.
