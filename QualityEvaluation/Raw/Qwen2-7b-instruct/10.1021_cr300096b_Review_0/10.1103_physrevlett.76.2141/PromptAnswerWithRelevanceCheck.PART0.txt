</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced in heterogeneous catalysis following their commercial introduction. These catalysts feature distinct electronic and chemical properties that facilitate a transition between theoretical models and industrial applications. They bridge the "materials gap" by offering superior selectivity and activity compared to single-metal catalysts, while also addressing the "pressure gap" through enhanced stability under practical operating conditions. In fundamental research, these catalysts enable deeper understanding of surface chemistry and reaction mechanisms. Practically, they optimize performance in industries such as petrochemicals, automotive emissions, and energy conversion, demonstrating their pivotal role in both academic exploration and industrial efficiency.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. They bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties enable them to perform better under industrial conditions compared to single-metal catalysts. The electronic structure of bimetallic systems allows for a more efficient distribution of electrons, which can lead to improved reactivity and selectivity. Additionally, the chemical properties of these catalysts can facilitate specific reactions that might be challenging or impossible for single-metal catalysts, thus enhancing both fundamental research and practical applications.
