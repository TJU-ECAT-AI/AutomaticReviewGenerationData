Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. They bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties enable them to perform better under industrial conditions compared to single-metal catalysts. The electronic structure of bimetallic systems allows for a more efficient distribution of electrons, which can lead to improved reactivity and selectivity. Additionally, the chemical properties of these catalysts can facilitate specific reactions that might be challenging or impossible for single-metal catalysts, thus enhancing both fundamental research and practical applications.

自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化中取得了显著进步。它们通过独特的电子和化学性质，在模型表面与工业相关支撑催化剂之间架起“材料差距”和“压力差距”。这些性质使得它们在工业条件下比单一金属催化剂表现更好。双金属系统的电子结构允许更有效的电子分布，这可以导致更高的反应性和选择性。此外，这些催化剂的化学性质可以促进特定反应，对于单一金属催化剂来说可能是困难或不可能的，从而增强了基础研究和实际应用。
