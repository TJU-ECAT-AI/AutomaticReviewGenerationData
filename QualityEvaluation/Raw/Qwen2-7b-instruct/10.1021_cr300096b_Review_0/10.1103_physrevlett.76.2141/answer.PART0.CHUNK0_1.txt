[1] "How have bimetallic catalysts evolved in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, and how do their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications?"

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced in heterogeneous catalysis following their commercial introduction. These catalysts feature distinct electronic and chemical properties that facilitate a transition between theoretical models and industrial applications. They bridge the "materials gap" by offering superior selectivity and activity compared to single-metal catalysts, while also addressing the "pressure gap" through enhanced stability under practical operating conditions. In fundamental research, these catalysts enable deeper understanding of surface chemistry and reaction mechanisms. Practically, they optimize performance in industries such as petrochemicals, automotive emissions, and energy conversion, demonstrating their pivotal role in both academic exploration and industrial efficiency.
