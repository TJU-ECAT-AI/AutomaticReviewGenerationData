[1] "Although most of the work discussed in the book has already appeared in the open scientific literature, the book brings twenty years of research at Exxons catalysis laboratories into context and makes it easier for the reader to appreciate the development of concepts and ideas concerning bimetallic catalysts."
[2] "Bimetallic catalysts find wide application, especially in the petroleum industry. They offer the potential of improved selectivity and better activity maintenance as compared to catalysts containing only one metal."
[3] "The Doraiswamy and Sharma volumes are well produced and fairly priced. They are a commendable advanced treatise, recommended to practicing engineers and as a supplementary reference for graduate courses in reaction engineering."
[4] "This book makes interesting reading not only for the scientist or engineer directly involved in bimetallic catalysis, but serves as an example of the scientific research endeavor in general, demonstrating how new concepts and insights are developed on the basis of carefully posed questions followed by key experiments, ultimately culminating in important industrial applications."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, thanks to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties allow them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their wide application in the petroleum industry showcases their potential for enhanced selectivity and activity maintenance compared to monometallic catalysts. The book by John H. Sinfelt, "Bimetallic Catalysts: Discoveries, Concepts, and Applications," provides a detailed and exciting account of research on bimetallic catalysts, highlighting the development of concepts and ideas concerning their structure and function. The book also demonstrates how new concepts and insights are developed through careful experimentation, leading to important industrial applications. Practicing engineers and graduate students in reaction engineering will find the book to be a valuable resource and reference.
