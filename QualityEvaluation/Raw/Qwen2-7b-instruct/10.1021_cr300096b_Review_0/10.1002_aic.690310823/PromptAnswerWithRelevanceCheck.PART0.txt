Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties have been pivotal in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These advancements have been driven by extensive research, which has led to improved selectivity and activity maintenance compared to monometallic catalysts. The book "Bimetallic Catalysts: Discoveries, Concepts, and Applications" by John H. Sinfelt offers a detailed account of research conducted over two decades at Exxon's catalysis laboratories. It elucidates the development of concepts and ideas surrounding bimetallic catalysts through careful posing of questions, followed by key experiments. This process has ultimately resulted in significant industrial applications, particularly in the petroleum industry where bimetallic catalysts offer enhanced performance. This book serves as an exemplary guide to the scientific research process, highlighting the importance of integrating new concepts and insights into practical applications.
