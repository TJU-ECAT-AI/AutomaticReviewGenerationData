[1] "Bimetallic catalysts find wide application, especially in the petroleum industry."
[2] "They offer the potential of improved selectivity and better activity maintenance as compared to catalysts containing only one metal."
[3] "Although most of the work discussed in the book has already appeared in the open scientific literature, the book brings twenty years of research at Exxons catalysis laboratories into context and makes it easier for the reader to appreciate the development of concepts and ideas concerning bimetallic catalysts."
[4] "This book makes interesting reading not only for the scientist or engineer directly involved in bimetallic catalysis, but serves as an example of the scientific research endeavor in general, demonstrating how new concepts and insights are developed on the basis of carefully posed questions followed by key experiments, ultimately culminating in important industrial applications."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties have been pivotal in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These advancements have been driven by extensive research, which has led to improved selectivity and activity maintenance compared to monometallic catalysts. The book "Bimetallic Catalysts: Discoveries, Concepts, and Applications" by John H. Sinfelt offers a detailed account of research conducted over two decades at Exxon's catalysis laboratories. It elucidates the development of concepts and ideas surrounding bimetallic catalysts through careful posing of questions, followed by key experiments. This process has ultimately resulted in significant industrial applications, particularly in the petroleum industry where bimetallic catalysts offer enhanced performance. This book serves as an exemplary guide to the scientific research process, highlighting the importance of integrating new concepts and insights into practical applications.
