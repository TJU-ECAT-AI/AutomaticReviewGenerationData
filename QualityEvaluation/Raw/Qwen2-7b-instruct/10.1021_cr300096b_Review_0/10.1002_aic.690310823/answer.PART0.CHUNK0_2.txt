[1] "Bimetallic catalysts find wide application, especially in the petroleum industry. They offer the potential of improved selectivity and better activity maintenance as compared to catalysts containing only one metal."
[2] "Although most of the work discussed in the book has already appeared in the open scientific literature, the book brings twenty years of research at Exxons catalysis laboratories into context and makes it easier for the reader to appreciate the development of concepts and ideas concerning bimetallic catalysts."
[3] "They offer the potential of improved selectivity and better activity maintenance as compared to catalysts containing only one metal."
[4] "This book makes interesting reading not only for the scientist or engineer directly involved in bimetallic catalysis, but serves as an example of the scientific research endeavor in general, demonstrating how new concepts and insights are developed on the basis of carefully posed questions followed by key experiments, ultimately culminating in important industrial applications."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, offering unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These properties enable improved selectivity and better activity maintenance compared to single-metal catalysts. The book "Bimetallic Catalysts: Discoveries, Concepts, and Applications" provides a detailed and exciting account of research on bimetallic catalysts from the perspective of one of the leading pioneers in this field. It demonstrates how new concepts and insights are developed through carefully posed questions followed by key experiments, leading to important industrial applications.
