[H. Sinfelt, 1983] "Bimetallic catalysts find wide application, especially in the petroleum industry. They offer the potential of improved selectivity and better activity maintenance as compared to catalysts containing only one metal."
[B. C. Gates, 1985] "Some of the newer topics engaging reaction engineers are introduced in the book (e.g., supported enzymes and metal complex catalysts), but the authors have not addressed molecular concepts; typical of books in reaction engineering, this one lacks a chemical orientation."

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has significantly advanced the field, particularly in the petroleum industry. These catalysts offer enhanced selectivity and improved activity maintenance over monometallic counterparts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. The incorporation of multiple metals allows for synergistic effects that optimize reaction pathways, leading to more efficient and selective transformations. In fundamental research, the study of these catalysts has led to the development of new concepts and insights. Practically, bimetallic catalysts have found extensive use in refining processes, showcasing the successful translation of theoretical advancements into industrial applications.
