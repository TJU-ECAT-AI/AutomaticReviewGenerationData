[1] "Bimetallic catalysts find wide application, especially in the petroleum industry."
[2] "They offer the potential of improved selectivity and better activity maintenance as compared to catalysts containing only one metal."
[3] "John H. Sinfelt's book, the first in a series of Exxon Monographs, gives a detailed and exciting account of research on bimetallic catalysts from the vantage point of one of the leading pioneers in this area."
[4] "Although most of the work discussed in the book has already appeared in the open scientific literature, the book brings twenty years of research at Exxons catalysis laboratories into context and makes it easier for the reader to appreciate the development of concepts and ideas concerning bimetallic catalysts."
[5] "The final chapter of the book concentrates on the major industrial application of bimetallic catalysts for reforming of petroleum."

Bimetallic catalysts have significantly evolved in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These properties contribute to improved selectivity and better activity maintenance compared to monometallic catalysts. Sinfelt's book offers a detailed and exciting account of bimetallic catalysts' research, showcasing the development of concepts and ideas over two decades. The final chapter focuses on their major industrial application in petroleum reforming, demonstrating their importance in both fundamental research and practical applications.

自商业应用以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化领域经历了显著的发展。它们独特的电子和化学性质使它们能够跨越模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。这些特性使得它们具有比单一金属催化剂更好的选择性和活性维持能力。辛费特的书籍提供了对双金属催化剂研究的详细而令人兴奋的描述，展示了过去二十年中概念和想法的发展。最后一章集中于它们在石油重整中的主要工业应用，证明了它们在基础研究和实际应用中的重要性。
