[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed reactivities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."
[2] "These studies also revealed that metals that were immiscible in the bulk, such as Ru and Cu, showed evidence of bimetallic interaction on the surface of the catalyst."
[3] "Bimetallic surfaces, produced by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on a single crystal substrate, have allowed the utilization of a wide range of chemical, electronic and physical probes."
[4] "Many studies have attempted to correlate chemical reactivities with the electronic properties of MBS."
[5] "Specifically, a shift in the d-band center away from the Fermi level results in a weaker binding energy."
[6] "The formation of a bimetallic bond in MBS can lead to a shift in the surface d-band, resulting in a decrease or increase in the adsorbate binding energy."
[7] "This phenomenon is quite common for other 3d metals on Pt(111), although the diffusion temperature of the admetal layer varies for different 3d metals."
[8] "The adsorption properties of many atoms and small molecules on transition metals have been shown by Hammer and Nrskov to depend primarily on the electronic structure of the surface."
[9] "It has been shown that the interactions between adsorbates and transition metal surfaces can be considered via a two state orbital mixing picture."
[10] "The adsorption energy is related to the surface d-band center of the MBS structures."
[11] "Such correlation provides the opportunity for the rational design of surfaces with desirable chemical properties by synthesizing MBS of specific structures and compositions."
