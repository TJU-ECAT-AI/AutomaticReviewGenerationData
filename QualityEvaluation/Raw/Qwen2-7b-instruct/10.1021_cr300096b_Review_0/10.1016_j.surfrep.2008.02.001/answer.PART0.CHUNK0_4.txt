[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed reactivities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."
[2] "These studies also revealed that metals that were immiscible in the bulk, such as Ru and Cu, showed evidence of bimetallic interaction on the surface of the catalyst."
[3] "The findings of these unexpected properties of bimetallic catalysts have inspired many extensive investigations on the possible applications of different bimetallic catalysts."
[4] "Bimetallic surfaces have also gained a considerable amount of interest for fundamental surface science research, as summarized in several earlier reviews."
[5] "It is now well known that bimetallic surfaces often show novel properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces."
[6] "However, it is difficult to know a priori how the electronic and chemical properties of a particular bimetallic surface will be modified relative to the parent metals."

[14] "The modification of the structural and electronic properties of MBS can also lead to new reaction pathways of catalytically important reactions, such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and cyclotrimerization."
[15] "In the past few years there have been significant efforts in experimental and DFT modeling of MBS."
[16] "One of the new findings is that, depending on experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of the three structures: occupying the top-most surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with surface to produce inter-mixed bimetallic surfaces."
[17] "DFT modeling results clearly indicated that the modification on the surface d-band center is significantly different for the three types of bimetallic structures."
[18] "Surface science results, using several probe molecules, also confirmed the different chemical properties of MBS with surface monolayer and subsurface monolayer structures."

This knowledge has been instrumental in advancing the design and optimization of catalysts for industrial use, with a focus on enhancing their performance in chemical transformations.

12. The two critical factors influencing the modification of electronic and chemical properties in bimetallic surfaces are the strain effect and the ligand effect. The strain effect is related to the changes in the average metal-metal bond length, while the ligand effect pertains to the modifications in the electronic environment due to the presence of other metals around a metal atom.

13. A shift in the d-band center away from the Fermi level results in a weakening of the metal-adsorbate bond, as evidenced by a decrease in the binding energy. This phenomenon is crucial in understanding the adsorption behavior of molecules on bimetallic surfaces.

14. The modification of structural and electronic properties in bimetallic surfaces can lead to the discovery of new reaction pathways for catalytic processes, such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and cyclotrimerization. These pathways often emerge due to altered bonding configurations and electronic interactions that facilitate the activation and transformation of reactants.

15. Recent efforts in experimental and theoretical studies of bimetallic surfaces have focused on elucidating the complex interplay between the surface structure, electronic properties, and catalytic activity. This research has contributed to the development of predictive models for bimetallic surfaces, enabling the rational design of surfaces with desired chemical properties.

16. Depending on the experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal in bimetallic surfaces can adopt different structures, such as occupying the surface to form a surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to create a subsurface monolayer, or alloying with the surface to produce an intermixed structure. Each structure exhibits distinct electronic properties, influencing the chemical behavior of the surface.

17. Density functional theory (DFT) modeling has provided valuable insights into the electronic structure of bimetallic surfaces, particularly regarding the surface d-band center. The modeling has shown that the d-band center significantly influences the adsorption energy of molecules on the surface, with shifts in the d-band center correlating to changes in the chemical reactivity.
