[1] "Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinctly different from those of the parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity and stability."
[2] "These studies also revealed that metals that were immiscible in the bulk, such as Ru and Cu, showed evidence of bimetallic interaction on the surface of the catalyst."
[3] "The findings of these unexpected properties of bimetallic catalysts have inspired many extensive investigations on the possible applications of different bimetallic catalysts."
[4] "For this reason, bimetallic surfaces have also gained a considerable amount of interest for fundamental surface science research, as summarized in several earlier reviews."
[5] "It is now well known that bimetallic surfaces often show novel properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces."
[6] "The modification effect is especially important when the admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime."
[7] "The formation of a bimetallic bond in MBS can lead to a shift in the surface d-band, resulting in a decrease or increase in the adsorbate binding energy."
[8] "In the past few years there have been significant efforts in experimental and DFT modeling of MBS."
[9] "One of the new findings is that, depending on experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of the three structures: occupying the top-most surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with surface to produce inter-mixed bimetallic surfaces."
[10] "DFT modeling results clearly indicated that the modification on the surface d-band center is significantly different for the three types of bimetallic structures."
[11] "Surface science results, using several probe molecules, also confirmed the different chemical properties of MBS with surface monolayer and subsurface monolayer structures."
[12] "In addition, the combination of DFT modeling and experimental results revealed a general correlation between the position of the surface d-band center and the adsorption energy for various MBS structures, making it possible to predict bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties."
[13] "In the current review we will discuss the general trends in the electronic and chemical properties of MBS from both experimental and DFT studies."
