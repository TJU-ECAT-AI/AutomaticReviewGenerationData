[1] "In order to bridge the materials gap, systematic studies of the formation and chemical properties of equivalent MBS structures on polycrystalline substrates and in bimetallic nanoparticles are needed."
[2] "A compromise will be to develop a more quantitative correlation between the binding energies of the adsorbates and products, which are much easier to calculate, with the activation barriers for different types of surface reactions."
[3] "At present most of the surface and subsurface monolayer structures are produced on the single crystal substrates."
[4] "However, detailed studies are needed to determine whether and how the segregation and diffusion occur under non-UHV conditions, such as in the environment and hydrogenation or reforming reactions."

1. To bridge the materials gap between model surfaces and industrial catalysts, systematic studies are needed to understand the formation and properties of bimetallic structures on polycrystalline substrates and in nanoparticles.
2. A practical approach is to create a more precise link between the binding energies of adsorbates and products, which are simpler to compute, and the activation barriers for various surface reactions.
3. Most studies on bimetallic surfaces are carried out on single-crystal substrates, and more research is required to explore their behavior on polycrystalline surfaces and in nanoparticles.
4. Further investigation is needed to understand the segregation and diffusion of bimetallic structures under non-UHV conditions, particularly in environments and during reactions like hydrogenation and reforming.

1. 要弥合模型表面与工业催化剂之间的材料差距，需要系统研究在多晶基体和双金属纳米粒子上的双金属结构的形成和性质。
2. 实用的方法是建立吸附剂和产物的结合能与不同类型表面反应的活化能之间更精确的关系，后者的计算相对容易。
3. 大多数关于双金属表面的研究都是在单晶体基底上进行的，需要更多的研究来探索它们在多晶基体和纳米粒子上的行为。
4. 需要进一步研究在非UHV条件下（如环境和氢化或重整反应中）双金属结构的分离和扩散行为。
