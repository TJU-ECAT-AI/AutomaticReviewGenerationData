<p>In recent years 3d-Pt bimetallic alloys have attracted much research attention for their potential application as cathode electrocatalysts in proton exchange membrane (PEM) type fuel cells. Specifically, electrodes composed of alloys of Pt with iron [68] ,[97] ,[98] , cobalt [97] ,[99] ,[100] ,[101] ,[102] , and nickel [97] ,[98] ,[99] ,[100] ,[101] ,[102] ,[103] ,[104] ,[105] have been shown to exhibit activity significantly greater than that of pure Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). For example, Stamenkovi and coworkers reported that, while Pt3Co and Pt3Ni electrodes showed improvements over pure Pt for the ORR, alternative Pt-skin of these alloys, with Pt occupying the top-most surface layer, possessed the maximum catalytic enhancement [100] ,[101] ,[104] . These experimental results were further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations from the Mavrikakis group, where the enhanced ORR activity on the Pt-skin system was partially attributed to the alleviation of oxygen poisoning by the shift of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi Level [95] ,[106] . The Goddard group modeled and compared the chemisorption of atomic oxygen on Pt(111) and bimetallic Pt/Ni(111), concluding that oxygen was more tightly bound and more localized on Pt/Ni(111) than on pure Pt(111) [107] . All the experimental and theoretical results suggest that one of the main differences between Pt and 3d-Pt alloys is the different oxygen binding energy (OBE) on these surfaces.</p>

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those composed of platinum with iron, cobalt, and nickel, have gained significant research interest due to their potential application as cathode electrocatalysts in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. These alloys exhibit higher activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to pure platinum. The Mavrikakis group's density functional theory (DFT) calculations, along with experimental findings, have suggested that the enhanced ORR activity on the top surface layer (referred to as the Pt-skin) of these alloys can partly be attributed to the shift of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi level, which helps alleviate oxygen poisoning. The Goddard group's modeling further demonstrated that atomic oxygen binds more tightly and is more localized on bimetallic Pt/Ni surfaces compared to pure Pt(111) surfaces, contributing to the superior catalytic performance of these alloys in ORR.

近年来，特别是铂与铁、钴和镍组成的双金属合金因其在质子交换膜（PEM）型燃料电池中的潜在应用而引起了广泛的研究兴趣。这些合金在氧还原反应（ORR）中的活性显著高于纯铂。马维卡基斯小组的密度泛函理论（DFT）计算以及实验结果表明，这些合金顶部表面层（称为铂皮肤）的增强ORR活性部分归因于表面d带中心远离费米能级的移动，这有助于缓解氧中毒。戈德纳德小组的建模进一步显示，原子氧在铂/镍双金属表面上的结合更加紧密且定位更佳，相比于纯铂（111）表面，这对这些合金在ORR中的催化性能有显著贡献。

<p>The trends in Fig. 24 also reveal two distinct slopes for the subsurface and surface structures. In all the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures the surface atom is Pt (5d metal), while 3d is the surface metal in all the 3d-Pt(111) surface MBS structures. The different slopes for the two types of structures are due to the Pauli repulsion in the electronic states between the metal surface and adsorbates, resulting in an increase in the kinetic energy that is proportional to the square of the adsorbate-metal d coupling matrix element
V
a d 2 . This coupling element varies with the increasing extension of 3d, 4d and 5d orbitals, which generally leads to different slopes in the correlation between binding energy and the surface d-band center for bimetallic surfaces with 3d, 4d and 5d metals. The differences become even more obvious for larger adsorbes, such as hydrocarbons as will be illustrated in Section
5.1

Figure 24 illustrates two distinct slopes for the subsurface and surface structures. In all the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures, the surface atom is platinum (5d metal), whereas in all the 3d-Pt(111) surface MBS structures, 3d is the surface metal. The differing slopes between the two types of structures are due to Pauli repulsion in the electronic states between the metal surface and adsorbates, which results in an increase in kinetic energy proportional to the square of the adsorbate-metal d coupling matrix element \(V_{ad}^2\). This coupling element varies with the increasing extension of 3d, 4d, and 5d orbitals, leading to different slopes in the correlation between binding energy and the surface d-band center for bimetallic surfaces with 3d, 4d, and 5d metals. These differences become more pronounced for larger adsorbates, as exemplified in Section 5.1.

图24展示了两种截然不同的斜率，分别对应于表面和亚表面结构。在所有亚表面Pt-3d-Pt(111)结构中，表面原子为铂（5d金属），而在所有3d-Pt(111)表面MBS结构中，3d是表面金属。两种结构之间的不同斜率归因于金属表面与吸附剂之间电子状态的Pauli排斥作用，导致与吸附剂-金属d耦合矩阵元素\(V_{ad}^2\)成正比的动能增加。这个耦合元素随3d、4d和5d轨道延伸的增加而变化，从而导致3d、4d和5d金属的双金属表面之间结合能与表面d带中心相关性的斜率出现差异。对于较大的吸附物，如烃类化合物，这些差异会变得更加明显，具体将在第5.1节中说明。

<p>The examples used in Section 4 provide a clear correlation of the binding energies of atomic and molecular adsorbates with the d-band center of MBS structures. In this section we will extend the correlation of surface d-band center to the chemical activities of the bimetallic surfaces using two types of surface reactions. The first one is the hydrogenation of molecules containing the C=C bond, which should require the surface to interact weakly with both atomic hydrogen and the C=C bond. Based on the examples given in Section 4 , the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface monolayer structures should be preferred over either Pt or the corresponding 3d metals. The second type of reaction is the reforming of oxygenates to produce H2 and CO, which should in principle require the surface to bond relatively strongly to both oxygenates and to the atomic hydrogen and CO products. In this case the 3d-Pt(111) surface monolayer structures should be favored as compared to the corresponding parent metals and to the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface structures.</p>

Section 4 presents a clear correlation between the binding energies of atomic and molecular adsorbates and the d-band center of metal surface bimetallic systems (MBS). In this section, we will expand the correlation of the surface d-band center to the chemical activities of bimetallic surfaces through two types of surface reactions. The first type involves the hydrogenation of molecules containing a C=C bond, requiring a weak interaction with both atomic hydrogen and the C=C bond. Based on the examples from Section 4, the preferred choice for such reactions is the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface monolayer structure over either pure Pt or the corresponding 3d metals. The second type of reaction is the reforming of oxygenates to produce H2 and CO, which ideally necessitates a strong bonding to both the oxygenates and the atomic hydrogen and CO products. In this scenario, the 3d-Pt(111) surface monolayer structures are favored over the corresponding parent metals and the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface structures.

第4节提出了原子和分子吸附剂的结合能与金属表面双金属体系（MBS）的d带中心之间的清晰关联。本节将扩展表面d带中心与双金属表面化学活性之间的关联，通过两种类型的表面反应。第一种涉及含C=C键分子的氢化，需要与原子氢和C=C键之间较弱的相互作用。根据第4节的示例，对于这类反应，优选的结构是Pt-3d-Pt(111)亚表面单层结构，而不是纯铂或相应的3d金属。第二种反应是氧化合物的重整以产生H2和CO，理想情况下需要与氧化合物以及原子氢和CO产物之间较强的结合。在这种情况下，3d-Pt(111)表面单层结构比对应的母金属和Pt-3d-Pt(111)亚表面结构更受青睐。
