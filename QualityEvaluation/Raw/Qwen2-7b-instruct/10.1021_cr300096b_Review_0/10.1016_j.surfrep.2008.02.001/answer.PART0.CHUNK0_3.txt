[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed reactivities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."
[2] "These studies also revealed that metals that were immiscible in the bulk, such as Ru and Cu, showed evidence of bimetallic interaction on the surface of the catalyst."
[3] "Currently bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized in many catalysis applications."
[4] "Bimetallic surfaces, produced by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on a single crystal substrate, have allowed the utilization of a wide range of chemical, electronic and physical probes."
