[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed reactivities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."
[2] "These studies also revealed that metals that were immiscible in the bulk, such as Ru and Cu, showed evidence of bimetallic interaction on the surface of the catalyst."
[3] "Bimetallic surfaces, produced by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on a single crystal substrate, have allowed the utilization of a wide range of chemical, electronic and physical probes."
[4] "Many studies have attempted to correlate chemical reactivities with the electronic properties of MBS."
[5] "Specifically, a shift in the d-band center away from the Fermi level results in a weaker binding energy."
[6] "The modification of the structural and electronic properties of MBS can also lead to new reaction pathways of catalytically important reactions, such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and cyclotrimerization."
[7] "In the past few years there have been significant efforts in experimental and DFT modeling of MBS."
[8] "One of the new findings is that, depending on experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of the three structures: occupying the top-most surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with surface to produce inter-mixed bimetallic surfaces."
[9] "DFT modeling results clearly indicated that the modification on the surface d-band center is significantly different for the three types of bimetallic structures."
[10] "The dissociative adsorption of hydrogen will be used to reveal the correlation between the hydrogen binding energy and the surface d-band center for various bimetallic surfaces."
[11] "This will be followed by the demonstration of the general trend in the binding energy of oxygen, as well as the thermodynamic stability and segregation kinetics of the surface and subsurface bimetallic structures in the presence of adsorbed oxygen."
[12] "The review will conclude by pointing out some of the challenges and opportunities in the understanding and potential applications of MBS."
