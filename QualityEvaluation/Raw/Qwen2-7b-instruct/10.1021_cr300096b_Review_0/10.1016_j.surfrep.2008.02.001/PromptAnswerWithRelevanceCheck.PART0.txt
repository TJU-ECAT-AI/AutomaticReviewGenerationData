[1] "In order to bridge the materials gap, systematic studies of the formation and chemical properties of equivalent MBS structures on polycrystalline substrates and in bimetallic nanoparticles are needed."
[2] "A compromise will be to develop a more quantitative correlation between the binding energies of the adsorbates and products, which are much easier to calculate, with the activation barriers for different types of surface reactions."
[3] "At present most of the surface and subsurface monolayer structures are produced on the single crystal substrates."
[4] "However, detailed studies are needed to determine whether and how the segregation and diffusion occur under non-UHV conditions, such as in the environment and hydrogenation or reforming reactions."

1. Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly since their commercial introduction, primarily through the development of materials with unique electronic and chemical properties that allow for more efficient and selective catalytic reactions. These properties enable them to bridge the "materials gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. 

2. The electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces, particularly the shift in the surface d-band center, play a crucial role in determining their chemical reactivity. This shift affects the binding energies of both atomic and molecular adsorbates, thereby influencing the catalytic activities of these surfaces. 

3. Challenges remain in accurately predicting the activity and selectivity of reactions on bimetallic surfaces due to the computational expense of DFT calculations. There is a need for developing more quantitative correlations between binding energies and activation barriers.

4. Research opportunities exist to bridge the "pressure gap" by systematically studying the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions. This involves understanding the dynamics of segregation and diffusion processes in real-world applications.

<p>In recent years 3d-Pt bimetallic alloys have attracted much research attention for their potential application as cathode electrocatalysts in proton exchange membrane (PEM) type fuel cells. Specifically, electrodes composed of alloys of Pt with iron [68] ,[97] ,[98] , cobalt [97] ,[99] ,[100] ,[101] ,[102] , and nickel [97] ,[98] ,[99] ,[100] ,[101] ,[102] ,[103] ,[104] ,[105] have been shown to exhibit activity significantly greater than that of pure Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). For example, Stamenkovi and coworkers reported that, while Pt3Co and Pt3Ni electrodes showed improvements over pure Pt for the ORR, alternative Pt-skin of these alloys, with Pt occupying the top-most surface layer, possessed the maximum catalytic enhancement [100] ,[101] ,[104] . These experimental results were further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations from the Mavrikakis group, where the enhanced ORR activity on the Pt-skin system was partially attributed to the alleviation of oxygen poisoning by the shift of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi Level [95] ,[106] . The Goddard group modeled and compared the chemisorption of atomic oxygen on Pt(111) and bimetallic Pt/Ni(111), concluding that oxygen was more tightly bound and more localized on Pt/Ni(111) than on pure Pt(111) [107] . All the experimental and theoretical results suggest that one of the main differences between Pt and 3d-Pt alloys is the different oxygen binding energy (OBE) on these surfaces.</p>

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those composed of platinum with iron, cobalt, and nickel, have gained significant research interest due to their potential application as cathode electrocatalysts in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. These alloys exhibit higher activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to pure platinum. The Mavrikakis group's density functional theory (DFT) calculations, along with experimental findings, have suggested that the enhanced ORR activity on the top surface layer (referred to as the Pt-skin) of these alloys can partly be attributed to the shift of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi level, which helps alleviate oxygen poisoning. The Goddard group's modeling further demonstrated that atomic oxygen binds more tightly and is more localized on bimetallic Pt/Ni surfaces compared to pure Pt(111) surfaces, contributing to the superior catalytic performance of these alloys in ORR.

<p>The trends in Fig. 24 also reveal two distinct slopes for the subsurface and surface structures. In all the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures the surface atom is Pt (5d metal), while 3d is the surface metal in all the 3d-Pt(111) surface MBS structures. The different slopes for the two types of structures are due to the Pauli repulsion in the electronic states between the metal surface and adsorbates, resulting in an increase in the kinetic energy that is proportional to the square of the adsorbate-metal d coupling matrix element
V
a d 2 . This coupling element varies with the increasing extension of 3d, 4d and 5d orbitals, which generally leads to different slopes in the correlation between binding energy and the surface d-band center for bimetallic surfaces with 3d, 4d and 5d metals. The differences become even more obvious for larger adsorbes, such as hydrocarbons as will be illustrated in Section

Figure 24 illustrates two distinct slopes for the subsurface and surface structures. In all the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures, the surface atom is platinum (5d metal), whereas in all the 3d-Pt(111) surface MBS structures, 3d is the surface metal. The differing slopes between the two types of structures are due to Pauli repulsion in the electronic states between the metal surface and adsorbates, which results in an increase in kinetic energy proportional to the square of the adsorbate-metal d coupling matrix element \(V_{ad}^2\). This coupling element varies with the increasing extension of 3d, 4d, and 5d orbitals, leading to different slopes in the correlation between binding energy and the surface d-band center for bimetallic surfaces with 3d, 4d, and 5d metals. These differences become more pronounced for larger adsorbates, as exemplified in Section 5.1.

<p>The examples used in Section 4 provide a clear correlation of the binding energies of atomic and molecular adsorbates with the d-band center of MBS structures. In this section we will extend the correlation of surface d-band center to the chemical activities of the bimetallic surfaces using two types of surface reactions. The first one is the hydrogenation of molecules containing the C=C bond, which should require the surface to interact weakly with both atomic hydrogen and the C=C bond. Based on the examples given in Section 4 , the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface monolayer structures should be preferred over either Pt or the corresponding 3d metals. The second type of reaction is the reforming of oxygenates to produce H2 and CO, which should in principle require the surface to bond relatively strongly to both oxygenates and to the atomic hydrogen and CO products. In this case the 3d-Pt(111) surface monolayer structures should be favored as compared to the corresponding parent metals and to the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface structures.</p>

Section 4 presents a clear correlation between the binding energies of atomic and molecular adsorbates and the d-band center of metal surface bimetallic systems (MBS). In this section, we will expand the correlation of the surface d-band center to the chemical activities of bimetallic surfaces through two types of surface reactions. The first type involves the hydrogenation of molecules containing a C=C bond, requiring a weak interaction with both atomic hydrogen and the C=C bond. Based on the examples from Section 4, the preferred choice for such reactions is the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface monolayer structure over either pure Pt or the corresponding 3d metals. The second type of reaction is the reforming of oxygenates to produce H2 and CO, which ideally necessitates a strong bonding to both the oxygenates and the atomic hydrogen and CO products. In this scenario, the 3d-Pt(111) surface monolayer structures are favored over the corresponding parent metals and the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface structures.

<p>In recent years 3d-Pt bimetallic alloys have attracted much research attention for their potential application as cathode electrocatalysts in proton exchange membrane (PEM) type fuel cells. Specifically, electrodes composed of alloys of Pt with iron [68] ,[97] ,[98] , cobalt [97] ,[99] ,[100] ,[101] ,[102] , and nickel [97] ,[98] ,[99] ,[100] ,[101] ,[102] ,[103] ,[104] ,[105] have been shown to exhibit activity significantly greater than that of pure Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). For example, Stamenkovi and coworkers reported that, while Pt3Co and Pt3Ni electrodes showed improvements over pure Pt for the ORR, alternative Pt-skin of these alloys, with Pt occupying the top-most surface layer, possessed the maximum catalytic enhancement [100] ,[101] ,[104] . These experimental results were further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations from the Mavrikakis group, where the enhanced ORR activity on the Pt-skin system was partially attributed to the alleviation of oxygen poisoning by the shift of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi Level [95] ,[106] . The Goddard group modeled and compared the chemisorption of atomic oxygen on Pt(111) and bimetallic Pt/Ni(111), concluding that oxygen was more tightly bound and more localized on Pt/Ni(111) than on pure Pt(111) [107] . All the experimental and theoretical results suggest that one of the main differences between Pt and 3d-Pt alloys is the different oxygen binding energy (OBE) on these surfaces.</p>

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing 3d metals like iron, cobalt, and nickel with platinum, have gained significant attention for their use as cathode electrocatalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. These alloys demonstrate superior activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to pure platinum. For instance, alloys with compositions like Pt3Co and Pt3Ni showed enhanced ORR performance over pure platinum, and the maximum catalytic enhancement was achieved when platinum occupied the top surface layer of these alloys. This improvement was partly attributed to the shift of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi level, which mitigates oxygen poisoning. DFT calculations by the Mavrikakis group supported these findings. Similarly, the Goddard group found that atomic oxygen was more tightly bound and localized on bimetallic Pt/Ni(111) surfaces compared to pure Pt(111) surfaces.
