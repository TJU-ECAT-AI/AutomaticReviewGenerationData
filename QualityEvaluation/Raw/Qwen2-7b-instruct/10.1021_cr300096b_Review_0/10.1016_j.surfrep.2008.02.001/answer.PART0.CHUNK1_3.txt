[1] "Bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced in heterogeneous catalysis since their initial commercial introduction. These catalysts often exhibit superior performance compared to their monometallic counterparts due to their unique electronic and chemical properties."

[2] "The unique electronic properties of bimetallic catalysts, such as the modification of the surface d-band center, facilitate the tuning of the binding energies of adsorbates. This enables the control of the activity of the catalysts."

[3] "In fundamental research, these properties allow for a deeper understanding of surface chemistry and catalysis mechanisms. In practical applications, they enable the design of catalysts with tailored activities and selectivities."

[4] "Bridging the 'materials gap' involves creating catalysts that mimic the properties of model surfaces in a more industrially viable format. Bimetallic catalysts offer a solution by providing a compromise between the ideal model surfaces and the practical constraints of supported catalysts."

[5] "Addressing the 'pressure gap' requires catalysts that perform well under real-world conditions, including high pressures and temperatures. Bimetallic catalysts can achieve this by enhancing stability and efficiency under such conditions."

1. Bimetallic catalysts have seen significant advancements in heterogeneous catalysis since their initial commercial introduction. They often surpass monometallic catalysts due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties enable the control of activity and selectivity, which is crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications.

2. The electronic properties of bimetallic catalysts, such as the modification of the surface d-band center, facilitate the tuning of adsorbate binding energies. This allows for precise control over catalyst performance.

3. In fundamental research, these properties deepen our understanding of surface chemistry and catalytic mechanisms. In practical applications, they aid in the design of catalysts with specific activities and selectivities.

4. Bridging the 'materials gap' involves developing catalysts that closely match the properties of ideal model surfaces but are suitable for industrial use. Bimetallic catalysts fill this role by offering a compromise between model surfaces and industrially viable catalysts.

5. Addressing the 'pressure gap' requires catalysts capable of functioning effectively under real-world conditions, including high pressures and temperatures. Bimetallic catalysts enhance stability and efficiency under such conditions, thus helping to bridge this gap.
