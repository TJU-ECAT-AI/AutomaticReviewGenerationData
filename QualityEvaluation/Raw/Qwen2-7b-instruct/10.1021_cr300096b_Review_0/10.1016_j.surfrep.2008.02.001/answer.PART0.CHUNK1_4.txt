<p>In recent years 3d-Pt bimetallic alloys have attracted much research attention for their potential application as cathode electrocatalysts in proton exchange membrane (PEM) type fuel cells. Specifically, electrodes composed of alloys of Pt with iron [68] ,[97] ,[98] , cobalt [97] ,[99] ,[100] ,[101] ,[102] , and nickel [97] ,[98] ,[99] ,[100] ,[101] ,[102] ,[103] ,[104] ,[105] have been shown to exhibit activity significantly greater than that of pure Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). For example, Stamenkovi and coworkers reported that, while Pt3Co and Pt3Ni electrodes showed improvements over pure Pt for the ORR, alternative Pt-skin of these alloys, with Pt occupying the top-most surface layer, possessed the maximum catalytic enhancement [100] ,[101] ,[104] . These experimental results were further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations from the Mavrikakis group, where the enhanced ORR activity on the Pt-skin system was partially attributed to the alleviation of oxygen poisoning by the shift of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi Level [95] ,[106] . The Goddard group modeled and compared the chemisorption of atomic oxygen on Pt(111) and bimetallic Pt/Ni(111), concluding that oxygen was more tightly bound and more localized on Pt/Ni(111) than on pure Pt(111) [107] . All the experimental and theoretical results suggest that one of the main differences between Pt and 3d-Pt alloys is the different oxygen binding energy (OBE) on these surfaces.</p>

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing 3d metals like iron, cobalt, and nickel with platinum, have gained significant attention for their use as cathode electrocatalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. These alloys demonstrate superior activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to pure platinum. For instance, alloys with compositions like Pt3Co and Pt3Ni showed enhanced ORR performance over pure platinum, and the maximum catalytic enhancement was achieved when platinum occupied the top surface layer of these alloys. This improvement was partly attributed to the shift of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi level, which mitigates oxygen poisoning. DFT calculations by the Mavrikakis group supported these findings. Similarly, the Goddard group found that atomic oxygen was more tightly bound and localized on bimetallic Pt/Ni(111) surfaces compared to pure Pt(111) surfaces.

近年来，包含3d金属如铁、钴和镍与铂合金的双金属催化剂在质子交换膜燃料电池的阴极电催化剂领域引起了广泛研究关注。这些合金在氧气还原反应（ORR）中的活性显著高于纯铂。例如，含Co3Pt和Ni3Pt的合金在ORR性能上优于纯铂，并且当铂位于这些合金的顶层表面层时，表现出最大的催化增强效果。这一提升部分归因于表面d能带中心向费米能级的偏移，这可以减轻氧中毒。Mavrikakis团队的DFT计算支持了这一发现。同样地，Goddard团队发现原子氧在Pt/Ni(111)双金属表面比纯Pt(111)表面更紧密地结合并更集中。

<p>Overall, the results discussed in Section 4 show that the formation of bimetallic surfaces modifies the electronic properties of the parent metals. One useful parameter to represent the electronic properties is the position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level. In most cases the surface d-band center of MBS is significantly different from that of either parent metal.</p>

The results discussed in Section 4 demonstrate that the creation of bimetallic surfaces alters the electronic properties of the base metals. A key parameter reflecting these electronic properties is the location of the surface d-band center relative to the Fermi level.
