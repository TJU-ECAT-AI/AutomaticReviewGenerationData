<p>Menning et al. have performed DFT calculations and experimental measurements to understand the thermodynamics and kinetics of the segregation of 3d metals in the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structures.</p>
<p>The stability of the Pt-3d bimetallic systems can be determined by comparing the difference in total energy, ΔE, between the subsurface and surface configurations when exposed to a half monolayer of adsorbed O atoms.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 10, in each case the 3d-Pt(111) surface configuration is lower in energy than that of the corresponding subsurface configuration, indicating a thermodynamic driving force for the segregation of the subsurface 3d atoms in the Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures to produce the 3d-Pt(111) surfaces.</p>
<p>Using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), Menning et al. used the onset of the υ (NiO) or υ (CoO) mode to verify the segregation of subsurface Ni or Co from PtNiPt(111) or PtCoPt(111).</p>
<p>For each adsorbate, there is a nearly linear correlation between the binding energies and the values of the surface d-band center, although for molecular adsorbates different slopes are observed for MBS structures terminated by 3d, 4d and 5d metals.</p>
<p>The general correlation of the modification of the d-band center and the reactivity of bimetallic surfaces are qualitatively illustrated in Fig. 51.</p>
<p>Similar approaches can be used for the rational design of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts for other types of reactions.</p>
<p>(1) Most of the current DFT correlations are based on the changes in the surface d-band center, which is clearly an oversimplification of the electronic properties.</p>
<p>(2) DFT calculations of activation barriers are required to predict the activity and selectivity of reactions on various MBS structures.</p>
<p>(3) At present most of the surface and subsurface monolayer structures are produced on the single crystal substrates.</p>
<p>(4) The stability of the surface and subsurface MBS structures needs to be investigated under reaction conditions to bridge the pressure gap.</p>

1. Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly since their commercial introduction, primarily through the development of materials with unique electronic and chemical properties that allow for more efficient and selective catalytic reactions. These properties enable them to bridge the "materials gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. 

2. The electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces, particularly the shift in the surface d-band center, play a crucial role in determining their chemical reactivity. This shift affects the binding energies of both atomic and molecular adsorbates, thereby influencing the catalytic activities of these surfaces. 

3. Challenges remain in accurately predicting the activity and selectivity of reactions on bimetallic surfaces due to the computational expense of DFT calculations. There is a need for developing more quantitative correlations between binding energies and activation barriers.

4. Research opportunities exist to bridge the "pressure gap" by systematically studying the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions. This involves understanding the dynamics of segregation and diffusion processes in real-world applications.

1. 自商业应用以来，双金属催化剂经历了显著发展，主要通过开发具有独特电子和化学性质的材料来实现更高效的催化反应。这些性质使它们能够弥合模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间的“材料差距”。

2. 双金属表面的电子性质，特别是表面d能带中心的偏移，对确定其化学活性至关重要。这种偏移影响吸附剂的结合能，从而影响这些表面的催化活性。

3. 预测反应在各种双金属结构上的活动性和选择性存在挑战，主要是由于计算密集型的第一原理密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的高成本。需要开发更多定量的结合能与活化能壁垒之间的关联。

4. 研究机会在于系统地研究在反应条件下双金属表面结构的稳定性，以弥合“压力差距”。这涉及理解实际应用中的聚集和扩散过程动态学。
