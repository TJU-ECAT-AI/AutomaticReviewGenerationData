        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By modifying the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, bimetallic systems have shown to have distinct structural and electronic characteristics that contribute to their enhanced performance in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        Many bimetallic catalysts have evolved in heterogeneous catalysis, incorporating unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. The research focuses on near-surface alloys (NSAs), which can confer novel catalytic properties to surfaces. NSAs consist of a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk. Density functional theory calculations are employed to introduce new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily. These alloys have the potential to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. They are of particular interest due to hydrogen's critical role in chemical and pharmaceutical processes, as well as its increasing use in energy technologies like fuel cells. Periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations are utilized to assess the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and evaluate hydrogen reactivity on stable surfaces.

        Bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced in heterogeneous catalysis, primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have helped bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications.
