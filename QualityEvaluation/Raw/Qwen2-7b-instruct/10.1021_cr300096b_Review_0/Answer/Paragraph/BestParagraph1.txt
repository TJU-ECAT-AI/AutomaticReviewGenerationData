        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1103/physrevlett.76.2141\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1002/cjce.5450850114\] and \[10.1021/ja208786f\]. The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has significantly advanced, incorporating unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. This has been crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications. Representative studies highlight the role of near-surface alloys (NSAs), which can confer novel catalytic properties to surfaces. NSAs consist of a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk, and they exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Density functional theory calculations are employed to introduce new classes of these alloys, showing their potential as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. The unique set of properties, including the weak binding of atomic hydrogen (H) and facile dissociation of H2, contributes to their effectiveness. The advancements in understanding the structural and electronic properties of bimetallic systems have enabled researchers to modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, leading to distinct structural and electronic characteristics that enhance performance in both research and industry. The book \[10.1002/cjce.5450850114\] serves as a comprehensive resource, offering an academic and industrial perspective on industrial catalysis, addressing the needs of both practicing chemists and engineers. The review section provides an integrative understanding and prospective outlook, emphasizing the opportunities for exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies, such as the development of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals and the synthesis of novel AuAg alloy catalysts, which exhibit exceptional activity in processes like low-temperature CO oxidation and hydrogen generation. The future of bimetallic catalysts in catalysis is expected to be marked by further advancements in understanding their electronic and chemical properties, leading to the creation of catalysts that are more efficient, selective, and robust, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical model surfaces and industrial applications.
