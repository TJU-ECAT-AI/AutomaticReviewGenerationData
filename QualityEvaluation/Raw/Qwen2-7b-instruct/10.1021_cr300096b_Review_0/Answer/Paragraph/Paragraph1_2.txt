            The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has significantly advanced, incorporating unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. This progression has been pivotal for both fundamental research and practical applications, as evidenced by the work on near-surface alloys (NSAs) which can confer novel catalytic properties to surfaces. NSAs consist of a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk, and density functional theory calculations have introduced new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily, making them potential low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. The role of hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is particularly noteworthy given its critical importance in chemical and pharmaceutical processes, as well as its increasing use in energy technologies like fuel cells. 

            Representative studies highlight the importance of modifying the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, which correlates with changes in the structural and electronic properties of bimetallic systems. This has led to significant advancements in understanding the unique characteristics of bimetallic catalysts, enabling researchers to bridge the gap between theoretical model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. 

            Bimetallic systems have shown distinct structural and electronic characteristics that contribute to their enhanced performance in both fundamental research and practical applications. For instance, near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals, with variable compositions and controlled synthesis, have been developed to enhance their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. Their unique electronic and chemical properties facilitate progress in both fundamental research and practical applications, bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical models and real-world industrial catalysts. 

            The synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst, supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM, is another example of bimetallic catalysts' advancements. This catalyst exhibits exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation, with its activity highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. During the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment restores the AuAg alloy structure, demonstrating the catalyst's adaptability and effectiveness. 

            The strong synergism in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on the AuAg nanoparticle explains the observed synergetic effect in catalysis, showcasing the unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts. 

            The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in acrolein through the architecture of bimetallic surface structures further exemplifies the significant evolution of bimetallic catalysts, highlighting their role in heterogeneous catalysis. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap", crucial for advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications.

            These advancements underscore the importance of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis, offering substantial value in both basic research and practical applications.
