        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. The advancements are crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications. 

        Many bimetallic catalysts, incorporating unique electronic and chemical properties, have significantly advanced since their commercial introduction. These properties effectively address the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and real-world industrial catalysts. By modifying the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, bimetallic systems have shown distinct structural and electronic characteristics that contribute to their enhanced performance in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        Near-surface alloys (NSAs), defined as alloys wherein a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk, have played a pivotal role in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties. NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily. These alloys have the potential to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. They are of particular interest due to hydrogen's critical role in chemical and pharmaceutical processes, as well as its increasing use in energy technologies like fuel cells. Periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations are utilized to assess the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and evaluate hydrogen reactivity on stable surfaces.

These properties have helped bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications. For instance, the synthesis of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals with variable compositions and controlled synthesis enhances their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. Their unique electronic and chemical properties enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.
