        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts, particularly their ability to modify surface reactivity and enhance catalytic efficiency, make them invaluable in both fundamental research and practical applications. This evolution has been driven by the incorporation of unique properties such as those found in near-surface alloys (NSAs), which can confer novel catalytic properties to surfaces. NSAs, consisting of a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk, have been studied using density functional theory calculations to introduce new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily, making them potential low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. These advancements have been crucial in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has significantly advanced since their commercial introduction, particularly through the development of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals, which exhibit variable compositions and controlled synthesis, enhancing their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. The unique electronic and chemical properties of these materials enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        The synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst, supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM via a one-pot synthesis procedure, showcases exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation. The activity of this catalyst is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. During the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment removes Br- and restores the AuAg alloy structure. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites on the AuAg alloy compared to either Au or Ag individually. This synergy explains the observed catalytic synergetic effect.

        The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in acrolein through the architecture of bimetallic surface structures demonstrates the significant evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. These catalysts have significantly advanced in areas such as bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap", primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have helped in advancing fundamental research and practical applications in this field.

        The document does not provide information on how bimetallic catalysts have evolved in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. However, it does discuss CO chemisorption at metal surfaces and overlays, highlighting the importance of understanding these interactions in the design and optimization of catalysts.
