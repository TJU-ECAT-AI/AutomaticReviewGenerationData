        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has significantly advanced, primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These features effectively address the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between theoretical model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications. Representative studies highlight the role of near-surface alloys (NSAs), which can confer novel catalytic properties to surfaces, and the use of density functional theory calculations to introduce new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily, making them suitable for low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. Periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations are utilized to assess the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and evaluate hydrogen reactivity on stable surfaces. This comprehensive evolution has facilitated the development of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals, which enhance catalytic activity for hydrogen generation, further bridging the gap between theoretical model surfaces and industrial applications. The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts enable them to modify surface reactivity and boost catalytic efficiency, offering substantial value in both basic research and practical applications.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook suggests an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research might focus on leveraging the synergistic effects observed in bimetallic catalysts, such as those demonstrated in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on AuAg nanoparticles, to design catalysts with even greater selectivity and efficiency. Additionally, considering the critical role of hydrogen in chemical and pharmaceutical processes, as well as its increasing importance in energy technologies, the development of bimetallic catalysts could pave the way for more sustainable and efficient industrial processes. The advancements in understanding the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts underscore the potential for these materials to revolutionize catalysis across various industries, from pharmaceutical synthesis to renewable energy solutions.

        自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在异质催化中的发展已显著进步，主要得益于它们独特的电子和化学性质。这些特性有效地解决了理论模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”，为基础研究和实际应用带来了进展。代表性研究表明，近表面合金（NSAs）可以向表面提供新型催化性能，密度泛函理论计算被用来引入具有氢相关反应优越催化行为的新类合金。一些NSAs以与贵金属（Cu、Au）相同的方式弱地绑定原子氢（H），同时更容易分解H2，使它们成为适合低温、高选择性催化剂的制药生产以及坚固燃料电池阳极的理想选择。周期性的自一致密度泛函理论计算用于评估NSAs在氢富集环境中的稳定性，并评估稳定表面上的氢活性。这种全面的发展促进了近单分散NiCu双金属纳米晶的开发，这些材料增强了氢生成的催化活性，进一步缩小了理论模型表面与工业应用之间的差距。双金属催化剂的独特电子和化学性质允许它们修改表面活性并提高催化效率，为基本研究和实际应用提供了巨大的价值。

        整合理解和前瞻性展望表明了一个探索新兴领域和创新方法的机会。未来研究可能集中在利用双金属催化剂观察到的协同效应，如AuAg纳米粒子上CO和O2共吸附所显示的，以设计具有更高选择性和效率的催化剂。此外，考虑到氢在化学和制药过程中的关键作用及其在能源技术中的日益重要性，双金属催化剂的发展可能为各种行业开辟更可持续和高效的工业流程铺平道路。对双金属催化剂的电子和化学性质的深入理解强调了这些材料在催化领域的潜力，有可能彻底改变化学和制药行业的流程，乃至可再生能源解决方案。
