        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By modifying the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, bimetallic systems have shown to have distinct structural and electronic characteristics that contribute to their enhanced performance in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        Representative studies highlight the role of near-surface alloys (NSAs), which can confer novel catalytic properties to surfaces. NSAs consist of a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk. Density functional theory calculations have been employed to introduce new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily, making them potential low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes.

        Many bimetallic catalysts have evolved to incorporate unique electronic and chemical properties that effectively address the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between theoretical model surfaces and real-world industrial catalysts. By altering surface reactivity and boosting catalytic performance, bimetallic catalysts offer substantial value in both basic research and practical applications.

        Near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals have advanced the field, demonstrating variable compositions and controlled synthesis that enhance their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. Their unique electronic and chemical properties enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        The synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst, supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM, exhibits exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation. The catalyst's activity is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. During the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment restores the AuAg alloy structure. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually, explaining the observed catalytic synergetic effect.

        Bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced in heterogeneous catalysis, primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have helped bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications.

By altering surface reactivity and boosting catalytic performance, bimetallic catalysts offer substantial value in both basic research and practical applications.

        The book "Fundamentals of Industrial Catalytic Processes (Second Edition)" serves as a comprehensive instructional and reference text for chemical science and engineering students and professionals. It offers an academic and industrial perspective on industrial catalysis, addressing the needs of both practicing chemists and engineers through detailed information on industrially relevant processes. This results in a highly accessible text for both engineers and chemists, grounded in the principles of reaction engineering and heterogeneous catalysis for industrial catalytic process design and optimization.

        Glycolaldehyde has been used as a probe molecule for biomass derivatives, focusing on the reactions of COH and CO functional groups on monolayer Ni surfaces. This research contributes to the understanding of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis.

        Alloy catalysts designed from first principles have the potential to yield catalysts of greatly improved activity and selectivity. Near-surface alloys (NSAs), defined as alloys wherein a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk, can endow surfaces with novel catalytic properties. These NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily, making them potential low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes.
