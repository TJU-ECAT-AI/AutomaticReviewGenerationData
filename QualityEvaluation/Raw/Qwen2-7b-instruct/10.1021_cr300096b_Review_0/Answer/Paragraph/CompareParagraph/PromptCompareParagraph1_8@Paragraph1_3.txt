Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1103/physrevlett.76.2141\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1002/cjce.5450850114\], \[10.1021/ja208786f\], and \[10.1038/nmat1223\]. The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By modifying the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, bimetallic systems have shown to have distinct structural and electronic characteristics that contribute to their enhanced performance in both fundamental research and practical applications.

            Representative studies, as reviewed in reference \[10.1016/0304-3991(90)90050-v\], have correlated chemical alterations in the chemisorption and catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts with changes in their structural and electronic properties. These alterations have been pivotal in advancing the field of catalysis, particularly concerning near-surface alloys (NSAs). NSAs, characterized by a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal with concentrations differing from the bulk, have been studied extensively. Density functional theory calculations have been instrumental in introducing new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily. This unique property set allows NSAs to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes.

            The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has been significantly influenced by their distinctive electronic and chemical properties, which effectively address the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between theoretical model surfaces and real-world industrial catalysts. By altering surface reactivity and boosting catalytic performance, bimetallic catalysts offer substantial value in both basic research and practical applications. This advancement is crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications, as highlighted in reference \[10.1021/ar50109a003\].

            The development of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals, as discussed in reference \[10.1021/jp805788x\], has significantly advanced the field of heterogeneous catalysis. These materials, with their variable compositions and controlled synthesis, enhance catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. Their unique electronic and chemical properties enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.

            The synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst, AuAg@MCM, which exhibits exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation, has been pivotal in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap", as described in reference \[10.1021/jp051530q\]. The activity of this catalyst is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. During the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment restores the AuAg alloy structure. The density functional theory calculation reveals that the AuAg alloy exhibits a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually. This synergy explains the observed catalytic synergetic effect.

            The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in acrolein through the architecture of bimetallic surface structures, as detailed in reference \[10.1021/ja070264\], showcases the significant evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. These catalysts have advanced to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications.

            The book Fundamentals of Industrial Catalytic Processes (Second Edition), referenced in \[10.1002/cjce.5450850114\], provides a comprehensive instructional and reference text for chemical science and engineering students and professionals. It offers an academic and industrial perspective on industrial catalysis, addressing the needs of both practicing chemists and engineers through detailed information on industrially relevant processes, making it a highly accessible resource for both engineers and chemists grounded in the principles of reaction engineering and heterogeneous catalysis for industrial catalytic process design and optimization.

            The literature discussing the use of glycolaldehyde as a probe molecule for biomass derivatives, focusing on the reactions of COH and CO functional groups on monolayer Ni surfaces, as outlined in \[10.1021/ja208786f\], further illustrates the application of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. This study highlights the potential of bimetallic catalysts in addressing the challenges of biomass conversion, showcasing their versatility in industrial applications.

            References to the role of near-surface alloys (NSAs) in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties, as explored in \[10.1038/nmat1223\], emphasize the importance of these materials in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". NSA research focuses on alloys with a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk. Density functional theory calculations are utilized to introduce new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. This research underscores the potential of NSAs in serving as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications.
