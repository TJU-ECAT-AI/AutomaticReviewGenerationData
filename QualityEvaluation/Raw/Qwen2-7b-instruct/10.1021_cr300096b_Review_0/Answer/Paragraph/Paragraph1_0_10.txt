        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has significantly advanced, incorporating unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. This advancement is crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications. Representative studies, such as those focusing on near-surface alloys (NSAs), which can confer novel catalytic properties to surfaces, highlight the importance of these properties. NSAs, characterized by a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk, are pivotal in enhancing catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily, making them potential low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. The use of periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations further aids in assessing the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and evaluating hydrogen reactivity on stable surfaces.

        Many bimetallic catalysts, particularly those featuring near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals of variable composition, have exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. Their unique electronic and chemical properties facilitate bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, driving progress in both fundamental research and practical applications. For instance, a novel AuAg alloy catalyst supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM, synthesized via a one-pot procedure, demonstrates exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation, with activity highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. The calcination process leads to complete phase segregation of the AuAg alloy, enriching the catalyst surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment restores the AuAg alloy structure, revealing a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually. This synergy explains the observed catalytic synergetic effect.

        The literature emphasizes the significant role of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly in the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in acrolein through the architecture of bimetallic surface structures. These catalysts have significantly evolved, primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties that help bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap", contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications. The evolving landscape of bimetallic catalysts continues to open avenues for exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies, focusing on areas such as pharmaceutical production, energy conversion, and environmental remediation.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook underscore the potential for bimetallic catalysts to play a pivotal role in addressing current challenges and future demands in catalysis. Future research endeavors might concentrate on developing new NSAs for energy production and storage technologies, optimizing catalyst design for enhanced selectivity and activity, and exploring the synergistic effects in catalysis for more efficient and sustainable chemical processes. The field of bimetallic catalysts stands poised for significant contributions to the advancement of catalysis science and technology, paving the way for innovations that could revolutionize industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to renewable energy.
