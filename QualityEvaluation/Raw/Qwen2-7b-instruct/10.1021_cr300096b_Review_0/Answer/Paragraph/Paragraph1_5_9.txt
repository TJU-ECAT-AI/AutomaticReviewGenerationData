        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1038/nmat1223]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/jp805788x] and [10.1021/jp051530q]. The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By modifying the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, bimetallic systems have shown to have distinct structural and electronic characteristics that contribute to their enhanced performance in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts, including near-surface alloys (NSAs), have played a pivotal role in this evolution. NSAs, characterized by a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal with concentrations differing from the bulk, can confer novel catalytic properties to surfaces. Density functional theory calculations have been employed to introduce new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily. This unique set of properties permits these alloys to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes.

        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has been driven by their ability to modify surface reactivity and enhance catalytic efficiency, making them invaluable in both fundamental research and practical applications. The synthesis of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals, for instance, has significantly advanced the field, offering enhanced catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. These materials, with their variable compositions and controlled synthesis, effectively bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress in both research and application.

        Representative studies, such as the synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM, highlight the advancements in bimetallic catalysts. This catalyst, prepared via a one-pot synthesis procedure, demonstrates exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation, whose activity is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. During the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment removes Br- and restores the AuAg alloy structure. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the AuAg alloy exhibits a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually, explaining the observed catalytic synergetic effect.

        Selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in acrolein through the architecture of bimetallic surface structures further exemplifies the advancements in bimetallic catalysts.

The density functional theory calculation reveals that the AuAg alloy exhibits a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually, explaining the observed catalytic synergetic effect.

        Bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced in heterogeneous catalysis, primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have helped bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications.
