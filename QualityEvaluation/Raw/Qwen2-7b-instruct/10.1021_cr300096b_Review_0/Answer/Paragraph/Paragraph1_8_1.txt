        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By modifying the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, bimetallic systems have shown to have distinct structural and electronic characteristics that contribute to their enhanced performance in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        Representative studies, such as those involving near-surface alloys (NSAs), have introduced novel catalytic properties to surfaces. NSAs consist of a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk. Density functional theory calculations are employed to introduce new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily, offering potential for low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes.

        The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts facilitate their ability to modify surface reactivity and enhance catalytic efficiency, making them invaluable in both fundamental research and practical applications. For instance, near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals demonstrate variable compositions and controlled synthesis, enhancing their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. These materials effectively bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts.

        A novel AuAg alloy catalyst supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM, synthesized through a one-pot procedure, exhibits exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation. Its activity is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. During the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment restores the AuAg alloy structure, revealing a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually.

        The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in acrolein through the architecture of bimetallic surface structures highlights the significant evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. These catalysts have advanced beyond their commercial introduction, primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. They bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        The book "Fundamentals of Industrial Catalytic Processes (Second Edition)" provides an academic and industrial perspective on industrial catalysis, addressing the needs of both practicing chemists and engineers through detailed information on industrially relevant processes. This text is a comprehensive instructional and reference resource for chemical science and engineering students and professionals, grounded in the principles of reaction engineering and heterogeneous catalysis for industrial catalytic process design and optimization.

        Glycolaldehyde, used as a probe molecule for biomass derivatives, demonstrates the reactions of COH and CO functional groups on monolayer Ni surfaces. This study further elucidates the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts and their applications in various catalytic processes.

        The role of near-surface alloys (NSAs) in conferring novel catalytic properties to surfaces has been explored, highlighting the potential of these alloys as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is of particular interest due to hydrogen's critical role in chemical and pharmaceutical processes and its increasing use in energy technologies like fuel cells.

        In summary, the evolution of bimetallic catalysts has been significantly influenced by their distinctive electronic and chemical properties, enabling them to effectively address the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and real-world industrial catalysts. By altering surface reactivity and boosting catalytic performance, bimetallic catalysts offer substantial value in both basic research and practical applications.
