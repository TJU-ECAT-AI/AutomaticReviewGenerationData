        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By modifying the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, bimetallic systems have shown to have distinct structural and electronic characteristics that contribute to their enhanced performance in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        Representative studies have highlighted the role of near-surface alloys (NSAs), which consist of a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk. Density functional theory calculations have been employed to introduce new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily. These alloys have the potential to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. They are of particular interest due to hydrogen's critical role in chemical and pharmaceutical processes, as well as its increasing use in energy technologies like fuel cells.

        The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced the field of heterogeneous catalysis, particularly in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts. These advancements are crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications.

        Near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals have emerged as a significant development in this field. These materials exhibit variable compositions and controlled synthesis, enhancing their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. Their unique electronic and chemical properties enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        The synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst, supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM, has demonstrated exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation. This catalyst's activity is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. During the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment restores the AuAg alloy structure. The density functional theory calculation reveals a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites on the AuAg alloy compared to either Au or Ag individually. This synergy explains the observed catalytic synergetic effect.
