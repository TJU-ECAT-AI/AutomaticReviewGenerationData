            <p>Many bimetallic catalysts have evolved in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, incorporating unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. The research focuses on near-surface alloys (NSAs), which can confer novel catalytic properties to surfaces. NSAs consist of a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk. Density functional theory calculations are employed to introduce new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily. These alloys have the potential to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. They are of particular interest due to hydrogen's critical role in chemical and pharmaceutical processes, as well as its increasing use in energy technologies like fuel cells. Periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations are utilized to assess the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and evaluate hydrogen reactivity on stable surfaces.</p>

            <p>The document discusses the synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst, AuAg@MCM, which exhibits exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation. The catalyst's activity is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. During the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment removes Br- and restores the AuAg alloy structure. The density functional theory calculation reveals that the AuAg alloy exhibits a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually. This synergy explains the observed catalytic synergetic effect.</p>
