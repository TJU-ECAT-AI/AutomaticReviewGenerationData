        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has significantly advanced, integrating unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. This evolution is pivotal for both fundamental research and practical applications. The literature highlights the role of near-surface alloys (NSAs), which are defined as alloys wherein a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk. Through density functional theory calculations, new classes of NSAs have been introduced that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. These NSAs, binding atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) yet dissociating H2 more easily, have potential to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. Their importance is underscored by hydrogen's critical role in chemical and pharmaceutical processes, as well as its increasing use in energy technologies like fuel cells. Periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations help assess the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and evaluate hydrogen reactivity on stable surfaces.

        The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts effectively address the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between theoretical model surfaces and real-world industrial catalysts. By altering surface reactivity and boosting catalytic performance, bimetallic catalysts offer substantial value in both basic research and practical applications. For instance, the development of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals showcases the enhancement of catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. Moreover, the synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst, supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM, demonstrates exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation, highlighting the importance of hydrogen pretreatment conditions. The document further explores the synthesis of such catalysts, their catalytic activities, and the role of electronic and chemical properties in bridging the aforementioned gaps.

        The advancements in bimetallic catalysts have been significantly influenced by their distinctive electronic and chemical properties. These features facilitate a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanisms, enabling the rational design of catalysts that can efficiently convert reactants into desired products under milder conditions. This is particularly evident in the selective hydrogenation of acrolein through the architecture of bimetallic surface structures, where bimetallic catalysts have significantly evolved to achieve high selectivity and efficiency.

        The integration of these advancements in bimetallic catalysts into heterogeneous catalysis represents a significant step towards optimizing industrial catalytic processes. The book "Fundamentals of Industrial Catalytic Processes (Second Edition)" serves as a comprehensive resource that addresses the academic and industrial perspectives of industrial catalysis, providing a wealth of information and details relevant to various industrially important processes. This text is invaluable for both students and professionals in the field, offering insights into the principles of reaction engineering and heterogeneous catalysis that are foundational to the design and optimization of industrial catalytic processes.

        The literature also discusses the use of glycolaldehyde as a probe molecule for biomass derivatives, focusing on the reactions of COH and CO functional groups on monolayer Ni surfaces. This research contributes to the broader understanding of surface chemistry and catalysis, highlighting the importance of studying model systems to inform the development of more effective catalysts for industrially relevant processes.

        The document emphasizes the significance of alloy catalysts designed from first principles, where the rational design of pure and alloy metal catalysts from fundamental principles can yield catalysts of greatly improved activity and selectivity. The role of near-surface alloys (NSAs) in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties is highlighted, with density functional theory calculations playing a crucial role in introducing new classes of these alloys that can yield superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. The unique properties of NSAs, such as their ability to bind atomic hydrogen (H) weakly while dissociating H2 more easily, contribute to their potential as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceuticals production and robust fuel-cell anodes.

        Representative studies reviewed in the document correlate chemical alterations in bimetallic systems with changes in their structural and electronic properties. These studies are pivotal in understanding the relevance of special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts, shedding light on the intricate relationship between surface chemistry and catalytic performance.
