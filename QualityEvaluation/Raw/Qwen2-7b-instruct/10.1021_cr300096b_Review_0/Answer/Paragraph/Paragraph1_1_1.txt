        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been significantly shaped by their unique electronic and chemical properties, which effectively bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. This advancement is crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications. The research focuses on near-surface alloys (NSAs), which can confer novel catalytic properties to surfaces. NSAs consist of a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk. Density functional theory calculations are employed to introduce new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily, making them potential low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. Periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations are utilized to assess the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and evaluate hydrogen reactivity on stable surfaces.

        The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts, including their ability to modify surface reactivity and enhance catalytic efficiency, make them invaluable in both fundamental research and practical applications. The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has been significantly influenced by their distinctive features, which effectively address the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between theoretical model surfaces and real-world industrial catalysts. By altering surface reactivity and boosting catalytic performance, bimetallic catalysts offer substantial value in both basic research and practical applications.

        Near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals, exhibiting variable compositions and controlled synthesis, have significantly enhanced their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. These materials enable the catalysts to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        The synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst, AuAg@MCM, supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate, has exhibited exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation. The catalyst's activity is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. The AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation during the calcination process, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment restores the AuAg alloy structure, revealing a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually. This synergy explains the observed catalytic synergetic effect.

        Bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced in heterogeneous catalysis, primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have helped bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications.
