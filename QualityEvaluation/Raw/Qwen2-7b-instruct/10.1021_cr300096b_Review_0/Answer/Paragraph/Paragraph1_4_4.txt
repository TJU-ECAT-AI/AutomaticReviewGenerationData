            Bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have helped bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications. The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has been significantly influenced by their distinctive electronic and chemical properties, which effectively address the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between theoretical model surfaces and real-world industrial catalysts. By altering surface reactivity and boosting catalytic performance, bimetallic catalysts offer substantial value in both basic research and practical applications. 

            The development of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals, with variable compositions and controlled synthesis, has enhanced their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. These materials bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress in both fundamental research and practical applications. The synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst, AuAg@MCM, which exhibits exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation, demonstrates the importance of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. The activity of this catalyst is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions, and the subsequent processing steps lead to the formation and restoration of the AuAg alloy structure. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites on the AuAg alloy compared to either Au or Ag individually, explaining the observed catalytic synergetic effect.
