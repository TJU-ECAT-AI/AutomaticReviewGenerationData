            Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By modifying the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, bimetallic systems have shown to have distinct structural and electronic characteristics that contribute to their enhanced performance in both fundamental research and practical applications. This advancement is crucial as it allows for the creation of catalysts with tailored functionalities that surpass those of single-metal catalysts. The role of near-surface alloys (NSAs) in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties is particularly noteworthy, as they can exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. For instance, some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily, making them promising candidates for low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. Periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations have proven to be invaluable tools in assessing the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and evaluating hydrogen reactivity on stable surfaces. Future research could explore the development of NSAs for energy production and storage technologies, including fuel cells, leveraging their unique properties to optimize catalytic performance under various operating conditions.
