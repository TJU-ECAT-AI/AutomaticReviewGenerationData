        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has significantly advanced, incorporating unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. This advancement is pivotal for both fundamental research and practical applications.

        Representative studies have highlighted the role of near-surface alloys (NSAs), which consist of a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk. These NSAs can confer novel catalytic properties to surfaces. Density functional theory calculations are employed to introduce new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily. These alloys have the potential to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. Their unique properties are particularly intriguing given hydrogen's critical role in chemical and pharmaceutical processes, as well as its increasing use in energy technologies like fuel cells.

        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has been significantly influenced by their distinctive electronic and chemical properties, effectively addressing the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between theoretical model surfaces and real-world industrial catalysts. By altering surface reactivity and boosting catalytic performance, bimetallic catalysts offer substantial value in both basic research and practical applications.

        The synthesis of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals, which exhibit variable compositions and controlled synthesis, has enhanced their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. These materials bridge the gap between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        The synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst, AuAg@MCM, which exhibits exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation, is another example of bimetallic catalysts' advancement. The catalyst's activity is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. During the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment restores the AuAg alloy structure, revealing a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually.

        The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in acrolein through the architecture of bimetallic surface structures further illustrates the significant evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. Their unique electronic and chemical properties have enabled advancements that are crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications.

        The book "Fundamentals of Industrial Catalytic Processes (Second Edition)" offers an academic and industrial perspective on industrial catalysis, addressing the needs of both practicing chemists and engineers through detailed information on industrially relevant processes. This serves as a comprehensive instructional and reference text for chemical science and engineering students and professionals, grounded in the principles of reaction engineering and heterogeneous catalysis for industrial catalytic process design and optimization.

        Glycolaldehyde as a probe molecule for biomass derivatives, focusing on the reactions of COH and CO functional groups on monolayer Ni surfaces, showcases the use of bimetallic catalysts in bridging the gap between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

        The research on designing alloy catalysts from first principles, particularly the role of near-surface alloys (NSAs) in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties, has shown considerable predictive power for catalysis. This includes the evaluation of the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and the reactivity of hydrogen on the resulting stable surfaces, which is of particular interest given hydrogen's role in various chemical and pharmaceutical processes.

        The document acknowledges that while there is significant advancement in understanding bimetallic catalysts, particularly in their electronic and chemical properties, there remains a need for further exploration and innovation to fully leverage their potential in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications.
