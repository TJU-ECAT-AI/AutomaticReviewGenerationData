        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has significantly advanced, incorporating unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These properties enable researchers to address challenges in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        Many bimetallic catalysts, particularly those featuring near-surface alloys (NSAs), have demonstrated novel catalytic properties by conferring distinct structural and electronic characteristics to surfaces. NSAs, characterized by a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal with varying concentrations from the bulk, have been introduced through density functional theory calculations to yield superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs exhibit a weak binding of atomic hydrogen (H) akin to noble metals (Cu, Au) while simultaneously dissociating H2 more efficiently. This unique set of properties positions these alloys as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. Their importance is underscored by hydrogen's pivotal role in chemical and pharmaceutical processes, as well as its growing use in energy technologies such as fuel cells.

        Recent advancements include the development of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals, which exhibit variable compositions and controlled synthesis, enhancing their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. These materials effectively bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress across both fundamental research and practical applications.

        An illustrative example is the synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM, which demonstrates exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation. The catalyst's performance is notably dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. During calcination, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment removes Br- and restores the AuAg alloy structure. Density functional theory calculations reveal a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites on the AuAg alloy compared to either Au or Ag individually. This synergy elucidates the observed catalytic synergetic effect.

        Bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced in heterogeneous catalysis, primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have facilitated the bridging of the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications. The use of bimetallic catalysts has significantly evolved, enabling more efficient and selective catalytic processes in various industries.

        Looking ahead, the future of bimetallic catalysts is promising. Emerging fields and innovative methodologies suggest potential pathways for further exploration and development. Future research might focus on refining catalyst synthesis methods, optimizing operating conditions, and designing catalysts with tailored properties for specific applications. The goal would be to leverage the unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts to achieve higher selectivity, activity, and durability, ultimately leading to more sustainable and efficient catalytic processes.

        自商用引入以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化领域的演变显著，它们集成的独特电子和化学性质成功地架起了“材料缺口”和“压力缺口”之间的桥梁，连接了模型表面和工业相关支撑催化剂。这些性质使研究人员能够解决基础研究和实际应用中的挑战。

        许多双金属催化剂，特别是那些包含近表面合金（NSA）的催化剂，通过展示独特的结构和电子特性，赋予表面新的催化性能。NSA是一种溶质金属，位于宿主金属的表面附近，在宏观浓度上与其不同，通过密度泛函理论计算引入，以实现氢相关反应的优越催化行为。一些NSA表现出与贵金属（Cu、Au）类似的弱原子氢（H）结合能力，同时更容易分解H2。这种独特的性质使这些合金成为低温度、高选择性制药生产和耐用燃料电池阳极的理想催化剂。氢在化学和制药过程中的关键作用以及其在能源技术如燃料电池中的日益重要性凸显了这些合金的重要性。

        近期进展包括开发近单分散NiCu双金属纳米晶，这些材料具有可变组成和受控合成，从而增强其氢生成的催化活性。这些材料有效地解决了“材料缺口”和“压力缺口”之间的问题，既适用于理论模型表面，也适用于工业适用的催化剂，推动了基础研究和实际应用的进步。

        一个具体的例子是合成一种新型AuAg合金催化剂，它被支持在介孔铝硅酸盐AuAg@MCM上，展现出在低温CO氧化中的出色活性。该催化剂的性能高度依赖于氢预处理条件。在煅烧过程中，AuAg合金经历相分离，表面富集了AgBr。后续还原处理完全去除Br-并恢复了AuAg合金结构。密度泛函理论计算揭示了AuAg合金在相邻位点上CO和O2共吸附比单独的Au或Ag更强的协同效应。这一协同作用解释了观察到的催化协同效应。

        双金属催化剂在异相催化领域取得了显著进步，主要得益于它们独特的电子和化学性质。这些性质促进了“材料缺口”和“压力缺口”之间的桥梁建设，为基础研究和实际应用带来了进步。双金属催化剂的使用已经显著发展，使得更高效和选择性的催化过程能够在各个行业中得以实现。

        展望未来，双金属催化剂的前景令人鼓舞。新兴领域和创新方法暗示了进一步探索和发展的潜在途径。未来的研究可能集中于改进催化剂合成方法、优化操作条件，并设计具有特定属性以适应特定应用的催化剂。目标是利用双金属催化剂的独特电子和化学性质来实现更高的选择性、活性和耐久性，最终导致更加可持续和高效的催化过程。
