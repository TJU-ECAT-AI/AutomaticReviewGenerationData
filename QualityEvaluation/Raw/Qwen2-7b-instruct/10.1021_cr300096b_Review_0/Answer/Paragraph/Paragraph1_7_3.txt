        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By modifying the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, bimetallic systems have shown to have distinct structural and electronic characteristics that contribute to their enhanced performance in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        Representative studies, such as those involving near-surface alloys (NSAs), have highlighted the potential of these systems to confer novel catalytic properties. NSAs, characterized by a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk, can be introduced using density functional theory calculations. This approach has led to the development of new classes of alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily. These alloys have the potential to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes, demonstrating the critical role of hydrogen in chemical and pharmaceutical processes as well as its increasing use in energy technologies.

        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has been significantly influenced by their distinctive electronic and chemical properties. These features effectively address the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between theoretical model surfaces and real-world industrial catalysts. By altering surface reactivity and boosting catalytic performance, bimetallic catalysts offer substantial value in both basic research and practical applications.

        Near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals, with variable compositions and controlled synthesis, have emerged as a key development in this field. These materials enhance the catalytic activity for hydrogen generation, bridging the gap between model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts. The unique electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic catalysts facilitate progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        The synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst, supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM, showcases exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation. This catalyst's performance is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. The calcination process leads to complete phase segregation of the AuAg alloy, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment restores the AuAg alloy structure, revealing a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually. This synergy explains the observed catalytic synergetic effect, further highlighting the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts.
