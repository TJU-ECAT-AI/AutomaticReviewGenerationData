        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. This evolution has been crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications, particularly in the field of propane dehydrogenation. 

        Bimetallic catalysts, with their ability to modify surface reactivity and enhance catalytic efficiency, have shown remarkable performance. The introduction of near-surface alloys (NSAs), where a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk, has played a pivotal role in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties. NSAs bound atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily, making them potential low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. Periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations have been utilized to assess the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and evaluate hydrogen reactivity on stable surfaces.

        The synthesis of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals, with variable compositions and controlled synthesis, has enhanced their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. These materials have been pivotal in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, thereby facilitating progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        Representative studies have demonstrated that the unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to their exceptional performance in various catalytic processes. These studies have been pivotal in understanding the role of NSAs in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties, leading to the development of novel catalysts with improved activity and selectivity.

        The use of bimetallic catalysts in propane dehydrogenation has significantly evolved, primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        In conclusion, the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis has been driven by their distinctive electronic and chemical properties. These features have effectively addressed the "materials gap" and "pressure gap", leading to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications. Future research efforts might focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies to further enhance the performance of bimetallic catalysts in various catalytic processes.
