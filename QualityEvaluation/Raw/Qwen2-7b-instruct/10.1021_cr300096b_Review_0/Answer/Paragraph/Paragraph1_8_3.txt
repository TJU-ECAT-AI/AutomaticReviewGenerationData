        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been significantly influenced by their distinctive electronic and chemical properties, which effectively address the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between theoretical model surfaces and real-world industrial catalysts. These advancements are crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications. The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts have enabled researchers to bridge the gap between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

        Representative studies have shown that by modifying the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, bimetallic systems display distinct structural and electronic characteristics that contribute to their enhanced performance. For instance, near-surface alloys (NSAs) can confer novel catalytic properties to surfaces. NSAs consist of a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk. Density functional theory calculations have introduced new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily, making them potential candidates for low-temperature, highly selective catalysts in pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes.

        The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts have also been crucial in the synthesis of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals, which exhibit variable compositions and controlled synthesis, enhancing their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. These materials effectively bridge the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        Specific examples include the synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM, which exhibits exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation. The activity of this catalyst is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. During the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment removes Br- and restores the AuAg alloy structure. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the AuAg alloy exhibits a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually, explaining the observed catalytic synergetic effect.

        In the field of propane dehydrogenation, the use of bimetallic catalysts has significantly evolved, particularly through the development of catalysts with unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties help bridge the gap between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in acrolein through the architecture of bimetallic surface structures exemplifies the significant role played by bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. These catalysts have advanced to a point where they can selectively hydrogenate CO bonds, demonstrating the importance of their unique electronic and chemical properties in achieving high selectivity and efficiency in chemical reactions.

        The book "Fundamentals of Industrial Catalytic Processes (Second Edition)" serves as a comprehensive instructional and reference text for chemical science and engineering students and professionals. It offers an academic and industrial perspective on industrial catalysis, addressing the needs of both practicing chemists and engineers through detailed information on industrially relevant processes. This results in a highly accessible text for both engineers and chemists, grounded in the principles of reaction engineering and heterogeneous catalysis for industrial catalytic process design and optimization.

        The literature discussing the use of glycolaldehyde as a probe molecule for biomass derivatives further highlights the versatility of bimetallic catalysts in various applications, including the conversion of biomass into valuable chemical products. The reactions of COH and CO functional groups on monolayer Ni surfaces demonstrate the potential of bimetallic catalysts in the processing of complex organic molecules, further illustrating their importance in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        Overall, the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications.
