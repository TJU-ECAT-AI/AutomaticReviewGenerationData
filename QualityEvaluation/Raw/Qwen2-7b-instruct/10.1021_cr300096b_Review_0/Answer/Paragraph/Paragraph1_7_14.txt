        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. This has been crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications.

        Representative studies have highlighted the role of near-surface alloys (NSAs) in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties. NSAs, defined as alloys wherein a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk, can exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily, making them potential candidates for low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. Periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations have been utilized to assess the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and evaluate hydrogen reactivity on stable surfaces.

        The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts have also contributed to their ability to modify surface reactivity and enhance catalytic efficiency. This has made them valuable in both fundamental research and practical applications. For instance, near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals, which exhibit variable compositions and controlled synthesis, have been developed to enhance catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. These materials effectively bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts.

        The synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM, prepared via a one-pot synthesis procedure, has demonstrated exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation. The catalyst's activity is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. During the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment removes Br- and restores the AuAg alloy structure. A density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the AuAg alloy exhibits a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually, explaining the observed catalytic synergetic effect.

        Bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced in heterogeneous catalysis, primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have helped bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications. The use of bimetallic catalysts has significantly evolved, with their unique properties enabling them to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes.

        An integrative understanding and prospective outlook would suggest exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies to further enhance the performance of bimetallic catalysts. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts that can operate under a wider range of temperatures and pressures, improving their selectivity, and enhancing their durability. There is an opportunity to explore the synergistic effects between multiple metals and the design of alloy structures that can optimize catalytic properties. Additionally, the integration of bimetallic catalysts with other technologies, such as in-situ regeneration or recycling mechanisms, could lead to more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes.

        自商用引入以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化中的演变已显著提高了对其独特电子和化学性质的理解。这些特性使研究人员能够跨越模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。这对于基础研究和实际应用都是至关重要的。

        代表性的研究表明，近表面合金（NSAs）可以在表面上赋予新材料独特的催化性能。NSAs定义为溶剂金属位于主金属表面附近，在浓度上不同于基体，可以表现出氢化物相关的反应中氢原子结合力较弱、氢气分解更易的特性，使其成为低温度、高选择性催化剂的理想候选者，用于制药生产及坚固的燃料电池阳极。周期性的自一致密度泛函理论计算被用于评估NSAs在氢丰富环境中的稳定性，并评估稳定表面的氢反应性。

        双金属催化剂的独特电子和化学性质也促进了其对表面反应性的调整和催化效率的提升，这使得它们在基础研究和实际应用中都具有重要价值。例如，近单分散的NiCu双金属纳米晶簇，通过可控合成显示出提高氢生成的催化活性。这些材料有效地跨越了理论模型表面与工业适用催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。

        一种新型AuAg合金催化剂在一种一锅合成法支持下，被制备在介孔铝硅酸盐AuAg@MCM上，显示出在低温CO氧化中的出色活性。催化剂的活性高度依赖于氢预处理条件。在煅烧过程中，AuAg合金发生相分离，表面富集了AgBr。后续的还原处理完全移除了Br-并恢复了AuAg合金结构。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算揭示了AuAg合金在邻近位点上CO和O2的协同吸附强度大于单独的Au或Ag，解释了观察到的催化协同效应。

        双金属催化剂在异相催化中的进化，主要得益于它们独特的电子和化学性质。这些性质帮助跨越了模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”，推动了基础研究和实际应用的进步。双金属催化剂的应用已显著增强，其独特的性质允许它们作为低温度、高选择性催化剂用于制药生产以及坚固的燃料电池阳极。

        集成理解和前瞻性展望表明，探索新兴领域和创新方法以进一步提升双金属催化剂性能是必要的。未来的研究可能专注于开发能够在更宽温度和压力范围内运行、提高选择性和延长使用寿命的催化剂。还有机会探索多金属间的协同作用以及优化催化性能的合金结构设计。此外，将双金属催化剂与其他技术集成，如原位再生或回收机制，可能促进更加高效和可持续的催化过程。
