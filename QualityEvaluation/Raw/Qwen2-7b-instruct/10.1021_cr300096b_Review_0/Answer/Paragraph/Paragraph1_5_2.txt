        The evolution, unique properties, and applications of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis have significantly progressed since their commercial introduction, as evidenced by a series of seminal works that collectively highlight their pivotal role in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. This review section synthesizes insights from a diverse array of publications, each contributing to our understanding of bimetallic catalysts' transformative impact on the field of heterogeneous catalysis.

        The introduction of near-surface alloys (NSAs) has been a groundbreaking development, enabling the conferral of novel catalytic properties to surfaces. NSAs, characterized by a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal with varying concentrations from the bulk, have demonstrated superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions when subjected to density functional theory calculations. These NSAs, by binding atomic hydrogen (H) weakly akin to noble metals while dissociating H2 more efficiently, showcase potential for serving as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts in pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. Their relevance in hydrogen chemistry is underscored by its critical role in various chemical and pharmaceutical processes, as well as its increasing utilization in energy production and storage technologies.

        The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts have been instrumental in enhancing their performance across both fundamental research and practical applications. Representative studies have explored the correlation between chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of overlayers, and the resultant changes in the structural and electronic properties of bimetallic systems. These advancements have facilitated a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the enhanced catalytic efficiency of bimetallic catalysts.

        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has been notably influenced by their distinctive electronic and chemical properties. These features effectively address the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and real-world industrial catalysts. By altering surface reactivity and boosting catalytic performance, bimetallic catalysts offer substantial value in both basic research and practical applications.

        The development of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals exemplifies the sophisticated engineering that has enabled the creation of materials with variable compositions and controlled synthesis, enhancing their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. These materials bridge the gap between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, driving progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        The synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM, which demonstrates exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation, is another testament to the advancements in bimetallic catalysts. The catalyst's performance is critically dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions, and the process of phase segregation during calcination, followed by restoration upon reduction treatment, underscores the intricate interplay between synthesis, catalytic activity, and surface chemistry.

        The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in acrolein through the architecture of bimetallic surface structures further illustrates the significant strides made in utilizing bimetallic catalysts for the optimization of industrially relevant processes. The unique electronic and chemical properties of these catalysts contribute to their ability to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap", making them indispensable in the pursuit of advancements in fundamental research and practical applications.

        The book "Fundamentals of Industrial Catalytic Processes (Second Edition)" provides a comprehensive overview of industrial catalysis, serving as a vital resource for both academic and industrial audiences. It addresses the academic need for a thorough course text while offering in-depth information on industrially relevant processes, thereby fulfilling the needs of practicing chemists and engineers alike. This text is a testament to the interdisciplinary approach required in the field of catalysis, grounding its principles in reaction engineering and heterogeneous catalysis for the design and optimization of industrial catalytic processes.

        Glycolaldehyde, as a probe molecule for biomass derivatives, highlights the application of bimetallic catalysts in the realm of renewable energy sources and sustainable chemistry. The reactions of COH and CO functional groups on monolayer Ni surfaces underscore the versatility and adaptability of bimetallic catalysts in complex chemical transformations, particularly those involving biomass derivatives.

        The document's exploration of alloy catalysts designed from first principles showcases the potential for rational design in yielding catalysts with greatly improved activity and selectivity. This area of research, focusing on near-surface alloys (NSAs), presents a promising avenue for endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties. NSAs, by their nature, can serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceuticals production and robust fuel-cell anodes, leveraging hydrogen's critical role in chemical and pharmaceutical processes and its increasing importance in energy technologies.

        In summary, the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications. The document's insights collectively emphasize the pivotal role of bimetallic catalysts in driving innovation and progress in the field of catalysis.

        Looking ahead, the future of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis promises to be even more exciting, with opportunities to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on leveraging the unique properties of NSAs for the development of catalysts that operate under mild conditions, enhancing their selectivity and reducing energy consumption. The integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence could also facilitate the design of more efficient catalysts by predicting their performance based on structural parameters and operating conditions. Additionally, the development of catalysts for the sustainable production of chemicals and fuels from renewable resources represents a critical frontier in the quest for a greener and more sustainable chemical industry.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook section would delve deeper into these future directions, highlighting the potential for bimetallic catalysts to revolutionize the way we produce and consume chemicals, energy, and materials. By capitalizing on the unique electronic and chemical properties of these catalysts, we can envision a future where industrial processes are not only more efficient and selective but also environmentally friendly, paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable global economy.
