        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By modifying the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, bimetallic systems have shown to have distinct structural and electronic characteristics that contribute to their enhanced performance in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        Representative studies, such as those by Hammer, Morikawa, and Nrskov, have highlighted the importance of these modifications in correlating chemical alterations with changes in the structural and electronic properties of bimetallic systems. This has been crucial in the development of novel catalytic properties for surfaces. For instance, the work by Yu, Barteau, and Chen on glycolaldehyde as a probe molecule for biomass derivatives has shed light on the reactions of COH and CO functional groups on monolayer Ni surfaces, demonstrating the unique capabilities of bimetallic catalysts in these contexts.

        The introduction of near-surface alloys (NSAs), as explored in the work by researchers utilizing density functional theory calculations, represents a promising area of research. NSAs, characterized by a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk, have been shown to yield superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some of these NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while simultaneously dissociating H2 more easily, making them suitable for applications such as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceuticals production and robust fuel-cell anodes.

        The advancements in the field have been driven by the rational design of pure and alloy metal catalysts from fundamental principles, aiming to yield catalysts of greatly improved activity and selectivity. A key area of focus has been the role of NSAs in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties. Through periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations, researchers have assessed the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and evaluated hydrogen reactivity on stable surfaces, contributing to the development of new NSAs for various processes.

        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has significantly advanced since their commercial introduction, particularly through the development of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals. These materials exhibit variable compositions and controlled synthesis, enhancing their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. Their unique electronic and chemical properties enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        Studies such as the one on a novel AuAg alloy catalyst supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM, which is very active for low-temperature CO oxidation, exemplify the practical applications of bimetallic catalysts. The activity of such catalysts is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions, and the calcination process leads to phase segregation of the AuAg alloy, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment restores the AuAg alloy structure, highlighting the unique electronic and chemical properties that contribute to the observed catalytic synergetic effect.

        The use of bimetallic catalysts has significantly evolved in heterogeneous catalysis, primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have helped bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications. The advancements in the field are crucial for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts that can address the challenges in energy production, storage, and chemical processing industries.

        In conclusion, the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis has been a journey of discovery, innovation, and practical application. From the initial understanding of CO chemisorption at metal surfaces and overlays to the development of novel NSAs and near-monodisperse bimetallic nanocrystals, the field has seen significant strides. The unique electronic and chemical properties of these catalysts continue to drive research towards more efficient and environmentally friendly processes, making them indispensable tools in both scientific exploration and industrial manufacturing.
