Representative studies, such as those reported in [10.1038/nmat1223] and [10.1021/ar50109a003], highlight the role of near-surface alloys (NSAs) in enhancing catalytic properties. NSAs, characterized by a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in varying concentrations, can bind atomic hydrogen (H) weakly like noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily, making them promising for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. The use of density functional theory calculations has proven predictive for catalysis, allowing for the assessment of NSAs' stability and hydrogen reactivity on stable surfaces. In another study, [10.1021/jp805788x], near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals were developed, showcasing variable compositions and controlled synthesis to enhance catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. Their unique electronic and chemical properties further facilitate progress in both fundamental research and practical applications. For instance, the synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst, AuAg@MCM, reported in [10.1021/jp051530q], exhibits exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation, highlighting the synergy between hydrogen pretreatment conditions and catalytic performance. This work, alongside other studies, demonstrates the significant role of bimetallic catalysts in advancing heterogeneous catalysis and their potential in various industrial applications.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1103/physrevlett.76.2141\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1002/cjce.5450850114\], \[10.1021/ja208786f\], and \[10.1038/nmat1223\]. The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By modifying the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, bimetallic systems have shown to have distinct structural and electronic characteristics that contribute to their enhanced performance in both fundamental research and practical applications.

            Representative studies, as reviewed in reference \[10.1016/0304-3991(90)90050-v\], have correlated chemical alterations in the chemisorption and catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts with changes in their structural and electronic properties. These alterations have been pivotal in advancing the field of catalysis, particularly concerning near-surface alloys (NSAs). NSAs, characterized by a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal with concentrations differing from the bulk, have been studied extensively. Density functional theory calculations have been instrumental in introducing new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily. This unique property set allows NSAs to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes.

            The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has been significantly influenced by their distinctive electronic and chemical properties, which effectively address the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between theoretical model surfaces and real-world industrial catalysts. By altering surface reactivity and boosting catalytic performance, bimetallic catalysts offer substantial value in both basic research and practical applications. This advancement is crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications, as highlighted in reference \[10.1021/ar50109a003\].

            The development of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals, as discussed in reference \[10.1021/jp805788x\], has significantly advanced the field of heterogeneous catalysis. These materials, with their variable compositions and controlled synthesis, enhance catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. Their unique electronic and chemical properties enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.

            The synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst, AuAg@MCM, which exhibits exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation, has been pivotal in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap", as described in reference \[10.1021/jp051530q\]. The activity of this catalyst is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. During the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment restores the AuAg alloy structure. The density functional theory calculation reveals that the AuAg alloy exhibits a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually. This synergy explains the observed catalytic synergetic effect.
