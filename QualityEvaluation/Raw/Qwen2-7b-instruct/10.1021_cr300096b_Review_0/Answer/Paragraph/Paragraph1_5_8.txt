        The evolution, unique properties, and applications of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis have significantly advanced since their commercial introduction, playing a pivotal role in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. This review section aims to analyze and summarize the advancements, focusing on the synthesis, electronic, and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts, and their practical implications across fundamental research and industry.

        Key milestones in the evolution of bimetallic catalysts include the discovery and utilization of near-surface alloys (NSAs), which confer novel catalytic properties to surfaces. These alloys, characterized by a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk, are synthesized using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The unique combination of properties allows these NSAs to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes, offering significant advantages over traditional catalysts.

        The synthesis of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals exemplifies the advancement in bimetallic catalyst technology. These materials, with their variable compositions and controlled synthesis, enhance catalytic activity for hydrogen generation, further narrowing the gap between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts.

        Representative studies highlight the correlation between chemical alterations in bimetallic catalysts and changes in their structural and electronic properties. These alterations enable researchers to fine-tune catalyst performance, making them valuable tools in both fundamental research and practical applications. The ability of bimetallic catalysts to modify surface reactivity and enhance catalytic efficiency underscores their importance in addressing the materials and pressure gaps.

        The review also emphasizes the synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM, demonstrating exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation. The catalyst's performance is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions, showcasing the intricate relationship between catalyst preparation and its catalytic activity.

        A DFT calculation reveals the strong synergism in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on the AuAg nanoparticle, which can explain the observed synergetic effect in catalysis. This finding not only advances our understanding of catalytic mechanisms but also opens avenues for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts.

        In conclusion, the advancements in bimetallic catalysts represent a significant leap forward in heterogeneous catalysis, with profound implications for both scientific inquiry and industrial applications. The unique electronic and chemical properties of these catalysts continue to drive innovation and optimization, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient chemical processes.
