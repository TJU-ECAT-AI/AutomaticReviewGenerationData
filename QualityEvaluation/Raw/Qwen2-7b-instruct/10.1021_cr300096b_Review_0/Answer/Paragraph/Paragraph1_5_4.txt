        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. This review focuses on the role of near-surface alloys (NSAs), which confer novel catalytic properties to surfaces by being present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk. Density functional theory calculations are employed to introduce new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily, making them suitable for applications such as pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. The unique properties of NSAs make them of particular interest given hydrogen's critical role in chemical and pharmaceutical processes, as well as its increasing use in energy technologies like fuel cells.

        Representative studies highlight the importance of modifying the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, which has been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of bimetallic systems. This has led to advancements in the design of pure and alloy metal catalysts from fundamental principles, aiming to yield catalysts of greatly improved activity and selectivity. The rational design of NSAs, in particular, has the potential to yield low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceuticals production and as robust fuel-cell anodes.

        The review also discusses the synthesis of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals, which exhibit variable compositions and controlled synthesis, enhancing their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. These materials effectively bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        Furthermore, the synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM prepared by a one-pot synthesis procedure is highlighted. This catalyst is very active for low-temperature CO oxidation, and its activity is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. During the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment removes Br- and restores the AuAg alloy structure. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the AuAg alloy exhibits a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually. This synergy explains the observed catalytic synergetic effect.

        Selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in acrolein through the architecture of bimetallic surface structures further demonstrates the significant evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis, primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have helped bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        自商业应用以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化中的演变显著提升了对其独特电子和化学性质的理解。这些特性使研究人员能够弥合模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。本综述重点探讨了近表面合金（NSAs）的作用，这种合金通过在其宿主金属表面附近以不同于基体的浓度存在，赋予表面新的催化性能。密度泛函理论计算被用于引入新类别的这些合金，这些合金表现出对氢相关反应的优越催化行为。一些NSAs以与铜、金等贵金属一样弱的方式绑定原子氢（H），同时更容易分解H2，使其适用于制药生产、高效燃料电池阳极等领域。NSAs的独特性质使它们特别值得关注，因为氢在化学和制药过程中起着关键作用，而且其在能源技术如燃料电池中的使用正在增加。

        代表性的研究强调了修改覆盖层的化学吸附和催化性质的重要性，这已被证明与双金属系统结构和电子性质的变化有关。这导致了从基本原理设计纯金属和合金催化剂的可能性，目标是产生活性和选择性大大提升的催化剂。NSAs的理性设计，尤其是，有可能提供低温、高选择性的催化剂用于制药生产和作为高效燃料电池阳极。

        近来，还讨论了合成近单分散NiCu双金属纳米晶的进展，这些纳米晶具有可变组成和控制合成，从而增强其氢生成的催化活性。这些材料有效地弥合了理论模型表面与工业适用催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”，促进了基础研究和实际应用的进展。

        此外，合成了一种新型AuAg合金催化剂，它被支持在由一锅合成过程制备的介孔铝硅酸盐AuAg@MCM上。该催化剂在低温CO氧化中非常活跃，其活性高度依赖于氢预处理条件。在煅烧过程中，AuAg合金经历相分离，使表面富含AgBr。随后的还原处理去除Br-并恢复了AuAg合金结构。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算显示，AuAg合金在相邻位点上的CO和O2共吸附比单独的Au或Ag更强。这种协同效应解释了观察到的催化协同效应。
