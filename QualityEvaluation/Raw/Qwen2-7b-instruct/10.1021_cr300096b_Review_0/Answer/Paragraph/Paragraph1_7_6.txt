        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. This has been crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications. For instance, near-surface alloys (NSAs), which are defined as alloys wherein a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk, have been pivotal in conferring novel catalytic properties to surfaces. These NSAs, when studied through density functional theory calculations, have exhibited superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions, binding atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily. This unique set of properties has allowed these alloys to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. The role of hydrogen chemistry on NSAs has been particularly interesting, given hydrogen's critical role in various chemical and pharmaceutical processes, as well as its increasing use in energy production and storage technologies, including fuel cells. Periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations have been utilized to assess the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and evaluate hydrogen reactivity on stable surfaces.

        The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts have also been instrumental in advancing the field. These properties effectively address the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between theoretical model surfaces and real-world industrial catalysts. By modifying surface reactivity and boosting catalytic performance, bimetallic catalysts offer substantial value in both basic research and practical applications. For example, the development of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals, which exhibit variable compositions and controlled synthesis, has enhanced their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. These materials have enabled the bridging of the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        In addition, the synthesis of novel catalysts, such as a AuAg alloy catalyst supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM, which is very active for low-temperature CO oxidation, further exemplifies the advancements made in the field. The activity of this catalyst is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions, and during the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment restores the AuAg alloy structure. The density functional theory calculation reveals a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually, explaining the observed catalytic synergetic effect.

        The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in acrolein through the architecture of bimetallic surface structures represents another significant advancement. Bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced in heterogeneous catalysis, primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have helped bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, contributing to advancements in both fundamental research and practical applications.

        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been significant, particularly in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties have contributed to this advancement. The document discusses the synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst, AuAg@MCM, which exhibits exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation. The catalyst's activity is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions, and during the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment restores the AuAg alloy structure. The density functional theory calculation reveals a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually, explaining the observed catalytic synergetic effect.

        The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has been significantly influenced by their distinctive electronic and chemical properties. These features effectively address the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between theoretical model surfaces and real-world industrial catalysts. By altering surface reactivity and boosting catalytic performance, bimetallic catalysts offer substantial value in both basic research and practical applications.

        The near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals of variable composition, which exhibit controlled synthesis and enhanced catalytic activity for hydrogen generation, exemplify the advancements made in the field. Their unique electronic and chemical properties enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.
