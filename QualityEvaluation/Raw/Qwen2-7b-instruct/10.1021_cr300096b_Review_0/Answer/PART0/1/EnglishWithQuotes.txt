Their unique electronic and chemical properties have contributed to this advancement. The document discusses the synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst, AuAg@MCM, which exhibits exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation. The catalyst's activity is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. During the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment removes Br- and restores the AuAg alloy structure. The DFT calculation reveals that the AuAg alloy exhibits a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually. This synergy explains the observed catalytic synergetic effect.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp051530q"},
