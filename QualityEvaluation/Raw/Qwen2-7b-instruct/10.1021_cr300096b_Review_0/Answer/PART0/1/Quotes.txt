"Alloy catalysts designed from first principles The rational design of pure and alloy metal catalysts from fundamental principles has the potential to yield catalysts of greatly improved activity and selectivity. A promising area of research concerns the role that near-surface alloys (NSAs) can play in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties. NSAs are defined as alloys wherein a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk; here we use density functional theory calculations to introduce a new class of these alloys that can yield superior catalytic behaviour for hydrogen-related reactions. Some of these NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as the noble metals (Cu, Au) while, at the same time, dissociating H2 much more easily. This unique set of properties may permit these alloys to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceuticals production and as robust fuel-cell anodes. Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is of particular interest, as this element has so important a role in many chemical1,13 and pharmaceutical14 processes. Hydrogen is also increasingly used in energy production and storage technologies15,16,17,18,19, including fuel cells. To develop new NSAs for such processes, we use periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations that have shown considerable predictive power for catalysis20. Using simple models, we evaluate the stability of a large class of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments, and we discuss the reactivity of hydrogen on the resulting stable surfaces."

[1] "We have summarized recent results from a comprehensive program to study the structural, chemical and electronic properties of morphologically unstable bimetallic surfaces. The data presented are among the first detailed microscopic studies of faceting of metals induced by ultrathin metallic films."

[1] "The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has been driven by their unique electronic and chemical properties."
          [2] "These properties bridge the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts."

          [2] "The activity was highly dependent on the hydrogen pretreatment conditions."
          [3] "Calcination led to complete phase segregation of the AuAg alloy and the catalyst surface is greatly enriched with AgBr after the calcination process."
          [4] "However, subsequent reduction treatment removed Br- completely and the AuAg alloy was formed again."

          [2] "The activity was highly dependent on the hydrogen pretreatment conditions."
          [3] "Calcination led to complete phase segregation of the AuAg alloy and the catalyst surface is greatly enriched with AgBr after the calcination process."
          [4] "However, subsequent reduction treatment removed Br- completely and the AuAg alloy was formed again."
          [5] "A DFT calculation shows that CO and O2 coadsorption on neighboring sites on the AuAg alloy was stronger than that on either Au or Ag."
          [6] "The strong synergism in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on the AuAg nanoparticle can thus explain the observed synergetic effect in catalysis."

          [2] "The use of bimetallic catalysts has significantly evolved in heterogeneous catalysis."
          [3] "Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap'."
          [4] "These advancements are crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications."
