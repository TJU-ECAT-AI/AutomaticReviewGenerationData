          [1] "These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system."
          [2] "Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts."

          The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By modifying the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, bimetallic systems have shown to have distinct structural and electronic characteristics that contribute to their enhanced performance in both fundamental research and practical applications.

          [1] "The chemical behavior of monolayer coverages of one metal on the surface of another, e.g., Ni/W, Fe/W, Pd/W, Cu/Re, Ni/Mo, etc., has recently been shown to be dramatically different from that seen for either of the metallic components separately."
          [2] "These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system."
          [3] "Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts."

          Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties play a crucial role in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These properties enable bimetallic catalysts to exhibit distinct behaviors compared to their single-metal counterparts. The chemical alterations in the overlayers, which affect chemisorption and catalytic properties, correlate with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system. This has led to enhanced performance and efficiency in various industrial processes.
