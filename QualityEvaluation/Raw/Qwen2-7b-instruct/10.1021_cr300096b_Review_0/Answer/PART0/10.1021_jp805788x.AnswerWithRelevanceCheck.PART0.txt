          [1] "Near-Monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals of variable composition: controlled synthesis and catalytic activity for H2 generation."
          [2] "Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications."

          The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis has significantly advanced since their commercial introduction, particularly through the development of near-monodisperse NiCu bimetallic nanocrystals. These materials exhibit variable compositions and controlled synthesis, which enhance their catalytic activity for hydrogen generation. Their unique electronic and chemical properties enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable catalysts, facilitating progress in both fundamental research and practical applications.
