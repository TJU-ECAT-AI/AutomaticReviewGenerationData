These properties facilitate bridging the \"materials gap\" and \"pressure gap\" between theoretical model surfaces and industrial-relevant supported catalysts. In both fundamental research and practical applications, bimetallic catalysts have demonstrated superior performance compared to their monometallic counterparts. This is attributed to the synergistic effects of the two metals in the bimetallic system, which can result in enhanced stability, selectivity, and activity. The electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts enable a better alignment between the catalyst and the reaction conditions, leading to improved catalytic performance. The capability of bimetallic catalysts to regulate the adsorption and activation of reactants through the interaction between the two metals is a critical factor in their effectiveness.", "Doi": "10.1021/ar50109a003"},
