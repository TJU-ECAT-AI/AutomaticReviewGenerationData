1. Bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced in heterogeneous catalysis following their commercial introduction. These catalysts feature distinct electronic and chemical properties that facilitate a transition between theoretical models and industrial applications. They bridge the 'materials gap' by offering superior selectivity and activity compared to single-metal catalysts, while also addressing the 'pressure gap' through enhanced stability under practical operating conditions. In fundamental research, these catalysts enable deeper understanding of surface chemistry and reaction mechanisms. Practically, they optimize performance in industries such as petrochemicals, automotive emissions, and energy conversion, demonstrating their pivotal role in both academic exploration and industrial efficiency.

The study focuses on glycolaldehyde as a probe molecule for biomass derivatives, specifically examining reactions of COH and CO functional groups on monolayer Ni surfaces.

How have bimetallic catalysts evolved in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, and how do their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications?

          The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has been propelled by advancements in materials science and an increased understanding of their distinctive electronic and chemical properties. These properties facilitate bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrial-relevant supported catalysts. In both fundamental research and practical applications, bimetallic catalysts have demonstrated superior performance compared to their monometallic counterparts. This is attributed to the synergistic effects of the two metals in the bimetallic system, which can result in enhanced stability, selectivity, and activity. The electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts enable a better alignment between the catalyst and the reaction conditions, leading to improved catalytic performance. The capability of bimetallic catalysts to regulate the adsorption and activation of reactants through the interaction between the two metals is a critical factor in their effectiveness.
