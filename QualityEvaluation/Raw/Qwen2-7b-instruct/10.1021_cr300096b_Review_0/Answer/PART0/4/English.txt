Answer: The literature provided does not contain specific details about the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, nor does it discuss their contribution to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications.

Bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis have undergone significant advancements since their commercial introduction. These catalysts bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrial catalysts due to their distinctive electronic and chemical characteristics. This has led to notable improvements in both fundamental research and practical applications.

The SXPS studies have offered crucial insights into the interfacial properties of bimetallic systems. Surface alloy formation has significant implications for surface reactivity. All the presented data have focused on substrate core levels, while recently, shifts in 4f core levels for overlayer films of Pt, Ir, and Au on W(111) and W(211) have also been observed.

Bimetallic catalysts have undergone significant evolution to bridge the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between theoretical model surfaces and industrial supported catalysts. Their distinct electronic and chemical properties enhance catalytic performance, making them essential for both research and practical applications in heterogeneous catalysis.
