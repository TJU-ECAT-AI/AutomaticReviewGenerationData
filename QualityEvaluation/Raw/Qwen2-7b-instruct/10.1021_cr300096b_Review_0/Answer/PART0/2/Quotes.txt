"Alloy catalysts designed from first principles The rational design of pure and alloy metal catalysts from fundamental principles has the potential to yield catalysts of greatly improved activity and selectivity. A promising area of research concerns the role that near-surface alloys (NSAs) can play in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties. Main NSAs are defined as alloys wherein a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk; here we use density functional theory calculations to introduce a new class of these alloys that can yield superior catalytic behaviour for hydrogen-related reactions. Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is of particular interest, as this element has so important a role in many chemical and pharmaceutical processes. Hydrogen is also increasingly used in energy production and storage technologies, including fuel cells. To develop new NSAs for such processes, we use periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations that have shown considerable predictive power for catalysis. Using simple models, we evaluate the stability of a large class of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments, and we discuss the reactivity of hydrogen on the resulting stable surfaces."

[1] "Bimetallic catalysts have significantly evolved since their commercial introduction, showcasing remarkable advancements in bridging the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts."
          [2] "Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute immensely to this evolution, enabling more efficient and selective catalytic processes."
          [3] "The study of bimetallic catalysts has been pivotal in understanding the complex interactions between metals, leading to the development of highly active and stable catalysts for various industrial applications."
          [4] "These catalysts offer the potential to overcome limitations associated with traditional homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, thus enhancing the performance of chemical reactions across multiple industries."
          [5] "From model surfaces to industrially relevant supported catalysts, bimetallic systems have proven their versatility and adaptability, making significant contributions to both fundamental research and practical applications."

[1] "Since Haruta's initial report 1 on the exceptionally high activity of supported gold catalysts, extensive research work both in fundamental and in application has been carried out in order to understand the origin of the surprisingly active catalytic behavior of the gold nanoparticle."
          [2] "It has been established that the catalytic performance of the gold nanoparticle is sensitive to the particle size, the support, and the preparation procedure."
          [3] "One way to obtain an active gold catalyst on an inert support is to make nanoparticles of gold alloy with a second metal that plays the role of activating oxygen."
          [4] "For the alloy catalyst, the average particle size is rather large, 2030 nm. In this alloy system, the size effect is no longer a critical factor, whereas Ag is believed to play a key role in the activation of oxygen."
          [5] "In our bimetallic catalyst system, the pretreatment effect becomes more complex because the gas environment during pretreatment may affect the preferential surface segregation of one of the two metals."
          [6] "The special calcination-reduction process is crucial for the formation of AuAg alloy nanoparticles with surface enrichment of Ag. The resulting nearly 1:1 Au/Ag surface ratio gives optimum catalytic activity."
          [7] "Reduction at lower temperatures may be not enough to remove Br- completely or not enough to form the AuAg alloy. Alternatively, a temperature of reduction that is too high may lead to further enlargement of the particles or may partially destroy the mesoporous structure."
          [8] "Our EPR measurement indicates that by alloying Ag with Au (Figure 9c), the adsorption and activation of oxygen on the catalyst surface became stronger. Further coadsorption of a CO molecule makes the oxygen adsorption even stronger (Figure 9d)."
          [9] "The Au and Ag monometallic particles were modeled with a 55-atom cluster in an icosahedral structure as shown in Figure 10. We have calculated the adsorption energies for CO and O2 at various sites on the Au55 and Ag55 monometallic particles."
          [10] "For the AuAg alloy cluster, we constructed the ordered Au25Ag30 alloy cluster, which keeps the icosahedral structure for comparison with the monometallic clusters, and the atomic positions of Au and Ag atoms are arranged to have optimal adsorptions for both CO and O2 as discussed."
