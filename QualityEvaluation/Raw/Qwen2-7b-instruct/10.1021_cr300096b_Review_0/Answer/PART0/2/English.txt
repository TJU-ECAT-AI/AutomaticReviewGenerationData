1. Bimetallic catalysts have seen substantial evolution since their commercial introduction, primarily due to their distinctive electronic and chemical characteristics. These properties facilitate the bridging of the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap', benefiting both fundamental research and practical applications.

Answer: There are no specific details provided in the literature regarding the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis or their contribution to bridging gaps between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

The rational design of pure and alloy metal catalysts from fundamental principles has the potential to yield catalysts of greatly improved activity and selectivity. Near-surface alloys (NSAs) play a key role in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties. NSAs are characterized by a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk. Density functional theory calculations are employed to introduce new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. These alloys are of particular interest due to hydrogen's critical role in chemical and pharmaceutical processes, as well as its increasing use in energy technologies such as fuel cells. Periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations are utilized to assess the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and evaluate hydrogen reactivity on stable surfaces.

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties play a crucial role in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These properties enable bimetallic catalysts to exhibit distinct behaviors compared to their single-metal counterparts. The chemical alterations in the overlayers, which affect chemisorption and catalytic properties, correlate with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system. This has led to enhanced performance and efficiency in various industrial processes.

Faceting of metallic bcc (111) surfaces, particularly when induced by ultrathin metal films, has been recognized for many years. This phenomenon, characterized by the conversion of initially planar surfaces into a hill-and-valley structure, exposes low-Miller-index crystal faces of microscopic dimensions. The study of faceted surfaces and their properties, as well as the implications for bimetallic catalysts, is crucial for understanding dynamic structural changes at high-temperature operations. This research also holds significance in various fields such as microelectronics, where it impacts the thermal stability of metallic components, and in display technologies, potentially influencing the self-assembly of field-emitter arrays.

Bimetallic catalysts have undergone considerable evolution since their commercial introduction, demonstrating remarkable progress in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrial-relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties play a crucial role in this evolution, facilitating more efficient and selective catalytic processes. The study of bimetallic catalysts has been instrumental in elucidating the complex interactions between metals, leading to the development of highly active and stable catalysts for various industrial applications. These catalysts have the potential to overcome limitations associated with traditional homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, thereby enhancing the performance of chemical reactions across multiple industries.

          Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly since their commercial introduction, becoming increasingly important in both fundamental research and practical applications. These catalysts combine two metals to create a synergistic effect, enhancing their catalytic properties. Specifically, the unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

          The evolution of bimetallic catalysts involves understanding the origins of the high activity of supported gold catalysts, optimizing the composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts, including controlling particle size, support selection, and preparation methods. The discovery of the synergistic effect between metals, particularly in the context of gold-alloy catalysts, has been pivotal. The electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts, especially when compared to their monometallic counterparts, play a crucial role in their enhanced catalytic performance.

          In fundamental research, bimetallic catalysts serve as models for understanding complex chemical transformations at the molecular level. Their use in practical applications spans numerous industries, including petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and environmental technologies, where they are employed in processes requiring efficient conversion or transformation of reactants into desired products.

          In terms of optimization and control, advances in synthesis techniques have enabled the precise control of bimetallic catalyst properties, including the optimization of particle size, composition, and structure, which are critical for achieving high catalytic activity under industrially relevant conditions.

          The complex nature of the pretreatment process for bimetallic catalysts has become more nuanced due to the influence of the gas environment on the surface segregation of metals. Careful control of pretreatment conditions, including temperature, atmosphere, and duration, is essential for achieving optimal catalyst performance.

          Surface enrichment and particle size control contribute to the high catalytic activity of these catalysts, particularly in the formation of alloy nanoparticles through a calcination-reduction process. The resulting nearly 1:1 Au/Ag surface ratio gives optimum catalytic activity.

          Quantum chemical calculations, such as those using density functional theory (DFT), provide insights into the adsorption energies and synergistic effects between CO and O2 on the surface of AuAg alloy nanoparticles. These calculations confirm the enhanced catalytic activity of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in oxygen-activation reactions.

          The choice of support, such as mesoporous aluminosilicate, plays a critical role in accommodating the bimetallic nanoparticles and influencing their activity. The support can stabilize the nanoparticles, facilitate adsorption and diffusion of reactants, and enhance the overall catalytic performance.
