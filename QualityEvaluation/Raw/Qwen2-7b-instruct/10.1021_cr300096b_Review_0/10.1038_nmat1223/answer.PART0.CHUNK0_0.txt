Alloy catalysts designed from first principles The rational design of pure and alloy metal catalysts from fundamental principles has the potential to yield catalysts of greatly improved activity and selectivity. A promising area of research concerns the role that near-surface alloys (NSAs) can play in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties. NSAs are defined as alloys wherein a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk; here we use density functional theory calculations to introduce a new class of these alloys that can yield superior catalytic behaviour for hydrogen-related reactions.
Some of these NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as the noble metals (Cu, Au) while, at the same time, dissociating H2 much more easily. This unique set of properties may permit these alloys to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceuticals production and as robust fuel-cell anodes.
Hydrogen chemistry on NSAs is of particular interest, as this element has so important a role in many chemical1,13 and pharmaceutical14 processes. Hydrogen is also increasingly used in energy production and storage technologies15,16,17,18,19, including fuel cells.
To develop new NSAs for such processes, we use periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations that have shown considerable predictive power for catalysis20. Using simple models, we evaluate the stability of a large class of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments, and we discuss the reactivity of hydrogen on the resulting stable surfaces.
We find, among other results, that some NSAs produce a combination of weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 dissociation. These unusual characteristics could be beneficial both for H2 dissociation to produce adsorbed H and for subsequent reactions of H with other surface species.
For H2 dissociation, weak binding of H would generally be thought to imply a high H2 activation energy barrier21,22,23. We find, however, that selected NSAs offer an exciting exception to this rule by simultaneously allowing weak H binding and low H2 dissociation barriers.
Weak binding of H, in turn, can make subsequent reaction steps easier, thereby allowing lower temperatures to be used for reactions on these NSAs.

Many bimetallic catalysts have evolved in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, incorporating unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. The research focuses on near-surface alloys (NSAs), which can confer novel catalytic properties to surfaces. NSAs consist of a solute metal present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations differing from the bulk. Density functional theory calculations are employed to introduce new classes of these alloys that exhibit superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions. Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as noble metals (Cu, Au) while dissociating H2 more easily. These alloys have the potential to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. They are of particular interest due to hydrogen's critical role in chemical and pharmaceutical processes, as well as its increasing use in energy technologies like fuel cells. Periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations are utilized to assess the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and evaluate hydrogen reactivity on stable surfaces. The results reveal that certain NSAs possess a unique combination of weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, enabling reactions at lower temperatures with higher selectivity. Weak binding of H typically implies a high H2 activation energy barrier, but selected NSAs defy this rule by simultaneously allowing weak H binding and low H2 dissociation barriers. This characteristic facilitates subsequent reaction steps, making lower temperatures suitable for reactions on these NSAs.

自商业引入以来，许多双金属催化剂在异相催化中得到了发展，整合了独特的电子和化学性质，以跨越“材料差距”和“压力差距”，连接模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂。研究重点放在近表面合金（NSA）上，这些合金可以为表面提供新颖的催化性能。NSA由位于主金属表面附近的溶剂金属组成，在体积浓度不同。利用密度泛函理论计算引入了这些合金的新类，这些合金在氢相关反应中表现出优越的催化行为。一些NSA以与铜、金等贵金属相似的强度吸附原子氢（H），同时更容易分解H2。这些合金有可能作为低温、高选择性催化剂用于制药生产和耐用燃料电池阳极。它们特别值得关注，因为氢在化学和制药过程中的重要角色，以及其在能源技术如燃料电池中的日益使用。周期性的、自我一致的密度泛函理论计算被用来评估NSA在富含氢气环境中的稳定性，并评估稳定表面上的氢活性。结果发现，某些NSA具有独特的组合特征，包括弱氢结合和低H2分解壁垒。这使得在这些NSA上进行反应时，温度更低且选择性更高。通常，H的弱结合意味着H2活化能壁垒较高，但选定的NSA违反了这一规则，同时允许弱H结合和低H2分解壁垒。这种特性使后续反应步骤更加容易，使较低温度适用于这些NSA上的反应。
