[1] "Some of these NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as the noble metals (Cu, Au) while, at the same time, dissociating H2 much more easily."
[2] "This unique set of properties may permit these alloys to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceuticals production and as robust fuel-cell anodes."
[3] "The rational design of pure and alloy metal catalysts from fundamental principles has the potential to yield catalysts of greatly improved activity and selectivity."
[4] "Recent innovations in atomic layer deposition and in nanoparticle fabrication technologies for metals suggest that practical nanofabrication strategies for metals may not be far off."

Near-surface alloys (NSAs) offer a unique combination of weak hydrogen binding and facile hydrogen activation, which could lead to the development of highly selective and efficient catalysts for pharmaceutical production and fuel cells. These alloys have the potential to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts by providing improved activity and selectivity at lower temperatures.
