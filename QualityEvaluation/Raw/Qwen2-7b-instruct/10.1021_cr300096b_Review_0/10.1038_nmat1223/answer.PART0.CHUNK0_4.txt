<p>Recent investigations have begun to elucidate some of the principles necessary for such efforts to be successful3,4,5,6.</p>
<p>Some of these NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as the noble metals (Cu, Au) while, at the same time, dissociating H2 much more easily. This unique set of properties may permit these alloys to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceuticals production and as robust fuel-cell anodes.</p>
<p>We find, among other results, that some NSAs produce a combination of weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 dissociation. These unusual characteristics could be beneficial both for H2 dissociation to produce adsorbed H and for subsequent reactions of H with other surface species.</p>
<p>To develop new NSAs for such processes, we use periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations that have shown considerable predictive power for catalysis20.</p>
<p>Real NSAs may, nonetheless, differ in certain ways from our idealized NSA models.</p>
<p>Our quantitative predictions will change for non-ideal NSAs, but test calculations, together with experimental studies on non-ideal NSAs11, suggest that the qualitative trends established here will persist in those cases.</p>

1. The rational design of pure and alloy metal catalysts from fundamental principles has the potential to yield catalysts of greatly improved activity and selectivity. A promising area of research concerns the role that near-surface alloys (NSAs) can play in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties. NSAs are defined as alloys wherein a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk; here we use density functional theory calculations to introduce a new class of these alloys that can yield superior catalytic behavior for hydrogen-related reactions.

2. The design of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis has evolved significantly since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications. The rational design of these catalysts from first principles, particularly focusing on near-surface alloys, has the potential to enhance their performance for various chemical processes, including pharmaceutical production and fuel-cell applications.

3. The selection of NSAs for hydrogen-related reactions can be chosen based on their stability in hydrogen-rich environments at appropriate temperatures and pressures. The stability can be assessed using a two-step procedure: first, estimating the surface composition in vacuum from the solute/host segregation energy database; second, assessing the effect of hydrogen adsorption on the surface composition. This approach helps in identifying NSAs that can bind atomic hydrogen (H) weakly while dissociating H2 easily, making them suitable for low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceuticals production and robust fuel-cell anodes.

4. The properties of hydrogen on stable, ideal NSAs include weak binding energy and ease of H2 dissociation. These unique characteristics allow for efficient hydrogen activation at low temperatures, reducing the need for high thermal energy, which increases overall reaction selectivity. This makes NSAs promising for hydrogenation reactions, particularly for the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds, and for improving anode catalysts in low-temperature fuel cells.

5. Techniques for nanoscale materials synthesis continue to advance, enabling the preparation of desired, quasi-ideal NSAs reproducibly. This development allows for the design and manufacture of a wider variety of materials for use in catalysis and other important technological applications, further enhancing the performance and efficiency of industrial processes involving hydrogen-related reactions.

1. 从基本原理设计纯金属和合金催化剂具有提高活性和选择性的潜力。研究近表面合金（NSA）在赋予表面新型催化性质方面的作用是一个有前景的领域。NSA定义为溶剂金属在主金属表面附近以与本体不同的浓度存在的合金；在这里，我们使用密度泛函理论计算来介绍一类新的这些合金，它们可以为氢相关反应提供优越的催化性能。

2. 均相催化中的双金属催化剂设计自商业引入以来经历了显著发展。它们独特的电子和化学性质有助于弥合模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”，并在基础研究和实际应用中发挥作用。从第一原理的角度理性设计这些催化剂，特别是专注于近表面合金，有可能增强其在各种化学过程中的性能，包括制药生产和燃料电池应用。

3. 根据稳定性在氢丰富的环境中，在适当温度和压力下，选择NSA进行氢相关反应。稳定性可以通过两步程序评估：首先，根据溶质/宿主分离能数据库估算真空中的表面组成；第二，评估氢吸附对表面组成的效应。这种方法有助于识别可与原子氢（H）结合较弱而使H2容易解离的NSA，使其成为用于制药生产、高效燃料电池阴极等低温度、高选择性催化剂的潜在选择。

4. 稳定的理想NSA上氢的特性包括弱结合能和H2容易分解。这些独特特性允许在低温下有效激活氢，减少所需热能，从而增加整体反应选择性。这使得NSA适用于氢化反应，尤其是用于制备手性药物化合物，并改善低温燃料电池的阳极催化剂。

5. 持续改进纳米尺度材料合成技术，使能够准备所需的、准理想的NSA以可重复的方式。这一发展允许设计和制造更多种类的材料用于催化和其他重要技术应用，进一步提高涉及氢相关反应的工业过程的性能和效率。
