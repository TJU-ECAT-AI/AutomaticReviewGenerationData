Alloy catalysts designed from first principles The rational design of pure and alloy metal catalysts from fundamental principles has the potential to yield catalysts of greatly improved activity and selectivity.
Some of these NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as the noble metals (Cu, Au) while, at the same time, dissociating H2 much more easily.
These unusual characteristics could be beneficial both for H2 dissociation to produce adsorbed H and for subsequent reactions of H with other surface species.
We find, among other results, that some NSAs produce a combination of weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 dissociation.
This unique set of properties may permit these alloys to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceuticals production and as robust fuel-cell anodes.

Many near-surface alloys (NSAs) exhibit unique properties, such as weak hydrogen binding and facile hydrogen activation, which enable them to function as efficient catalysts for hydrogen-related reactions at low temperatures. These alloys can produce adsorbed hydrogen from dissociated hydrogen molecules and facilitate subsequent reactions with other surface species. As a result, they show promise for applications in pharmaceutical production and as robust fuel-cell anodes.
