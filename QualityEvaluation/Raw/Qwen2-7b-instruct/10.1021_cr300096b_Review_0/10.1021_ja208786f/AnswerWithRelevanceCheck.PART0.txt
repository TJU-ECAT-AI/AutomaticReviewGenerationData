          Bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis have undergone significant advancements since their commercial introduction. These catalysts bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrial catalysts due to their distinctive electronic and chemical characteristics. This has led to notable improvements in both fundamental research and practical applications.
