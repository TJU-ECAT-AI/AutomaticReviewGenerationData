[1] "Bimetallic surface chemistry plays a crucial role in a number of technologically important areas, including catalysis, magneto-optical films, microelectronics fabrication, electrochemistry, corrosion passivation, and structural materials."
[2] "With the advent of ultrahigh vacuum surface analytical techniques and the development of efficient methods for surface preparation, it has become possible since approximately 1970 to prepare clean single-crystal bimetallic surfaces that are well characterized with respect to the geometric locations of the two different metal elements and that are very homogeneous in this surface structure (i.e., having an ideal surface unit cell with few defects in repeating this unit across the surface)."
[3] "These well-defined bimetallic surfaces have offered for the first time an ability to correlate surface chemical reactivity with atomic-level surface structure. Such structure/function relationships must ultimately form the basis for any predictive ability in tailor-making bimetallic surfaces to have desirable reactive properties."

Bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These characteristics enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. They offer enhanced stability, selectivity, and activity, which are crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications. The ability to correlate surface chemical reactivity with atomic-level surface structure has provided insights into designing catalysts with tailored properties for specific reactions.
