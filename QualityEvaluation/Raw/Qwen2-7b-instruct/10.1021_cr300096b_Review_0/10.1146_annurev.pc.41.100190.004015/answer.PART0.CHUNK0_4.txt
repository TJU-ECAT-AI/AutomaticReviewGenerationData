[1] "Bimetallic surface chemistry plays a crucial role in a number of technologically important areas, including catalysis, magneto-optical films, microelectronics fabrication, electrochemistry, corrosion passivation, and structural materials."
[2] "These well-defined bimetallic surfaces have offered for the first time an ability to correlate surface chemical reactivity with atomic-level surface structure."
[3] "Such structure/function relationships must ultimately form the basis for any predictive ability in tailor-making bimetallic surfaces to have desirable reactive properties."

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has significantly advanced our understanding and application of materials science. Their unique electronic and chemical properties enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By allowing precise control over surface structure and composition, bimetallic catalysts can be tailored to enhance reactivity and efficiency in various industrial processes. This capability is crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications in fields such as catalysis, microelectronics, and electrochemistry.
