[1] "Bimetallic surface chemistry plays a crucial role in a number of technologically important areas, including catalysis, magneto-optical films, microelectronics fabrication, electrochemistry, corrosion passivation, and structural materials."
[2] "With the advent of ultrahigh vacuum surface analytical techniques and the development of efficient methods for surface preparation, it has become possible since approximately 1970 to prepare clean single-crystal bimetallic surfaces that are well characterized with respect to the geometric locations of the two different metal elements and that are very homogeneous in this surface structure."
[3] "Such structure/function relationships must ultimately form the basis for any predictive ability in tailor-making bimetallic surfaces to have desirable reactive properties."
[4] "The vapor deposition of one metal onto a single-crystal surface of the second metal is another method for preparing bimetallic surfaces. This method has the advantage that the whole surface composition range is easily accessible."

Since their commercial introduction, bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced in heterogeneous catalysis due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties allow them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By enabling precise control over surface structure, researchers can tailor the catalysts to have desirable reactive properties. The vapor deposition method provides an accessible means to achieve various surface compositions, enhancing the versatility and effectiveness of bimetallic catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications.
