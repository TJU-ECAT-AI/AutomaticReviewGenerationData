[1] "Bimetallic surface chemistry plays a crucial role in a number of technologically important areas, including catalysis, magneto-optical films, microelectronics fabrication, electrochemistry, corrosion passivation, and structural materials."
[2] "With the advent of ultrahigh vacuum surface analytical techniques and the development of efficient methods for surface preparation, it has become possible since approximately 1970 to prepare clean single-crystal bimetallic surfaces that are well characterized with respect to the geometric locations of the two different metal elements and that are very homogeneous in this surface structure."
[3] "These well-defined bimetallic surfaces have offered for the first time an ability to correlate surface chemical reactivity with atomic-level surface structure."
[4] "Such structure/function relationships must ultimately form the basis for any predictive ability in tailor-making bimetallic surfaces to have desirable reactive properties."
[5] "This recognition has motivated a great deal of study over the past two decades concerning the structure of single-crystal bimetallic surfaces and their surface reactivity with respect to adsorption, desorption, decomposition reactions, and catalytic processes."

Answer: Bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, thanks to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By correlating surface chemical reactivity with atomic-level surface structure, scientists have gained the ability to predictably tailor bimetallic surfaces for desired reactive properties. This understanding has led to extensive research on the structure and reactivity of single-crystal bimetallic surfaces, particularly with respect to adsorption, desorption, decomposition reactions, and catalytic processes. The development of ultrahigh vacuum surface analytical techniques and efficient surface preparation methods has been instrumental in achieving precise control over bimetallic surface structures, thereby enhancing their catalytic performance in various technological applications.
