[1] "Bimetallic surface chemistry plays a crucial role in a number of technologically important areas, including catalysis, magneto-optical films, microelectronics fabrication, electrochemistry, corrosion passivation, and structural materials."
[2] "With the advent of ultrahigh vacuum surface analytical techniques and the development of efficient methods for surface preparation, it has become possible since approximately 1970 to prepare clean single-crystal bimetallic surfaces that are well characterized with respect to the geometric locations of the two different metal elements and that are very homogeneous in this surface structure (i.e., having an ideal surface unit cell with few defects in repeating this unit across the surface)."
[3] "Such structure/function relationships must ultimately form the basis for any predictive ability in tailor-making bimetallic surfaces to have desirable reactive properties."
[4] "The vapor deposition of one metal onto a single-crystal surface of the second metal is another method for preparing bimetallic surfaces. This method has the advantage that the whole surface composition range is easily accessible."

Since their commercial introduction, bimetallic catalysts have significantly advanced in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties play a pivotal role in this advancement. The advent of ultrahigh vacuum surface analytical techniques and the development of efficient surface preparation methods have enabled the creation of clean, well-characterized bimetallic surfaces. These surfaces exhibit ideal surface unit cells with minimal defects, which are crucial for establishing structure-function relationships. These relationships underpin the ability to tailor bimetallic surfaces for desired reactive properties. The vapor deposition method, offering a wide surface composition range, further enhances the versatility and effectiveness of bimetallic catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications.

自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化中取得了显著进展，特别是在弥合模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。它们独特的电子和化学性质在此过程中发挥着关键作用。超真空表面分析技术的出现以及高效表面制备方法的发展使得自1970年代起能够制备出干净、结构清晰的双金属表面，这些表面具有理想的表面单元格结构，并且在重复该单元结构时很少有缺陷。这些结构功能关系最终构成了定制双金属表面以获得理想反应性能的基础。这些关系支撑着在基础研究和实际应用中设计双金属催化剂的能力。蒸镀方法的使用进一步增强了双金属催化剂的灵活性和有效性，因为它提供了广泛的表面组成范围。
