[1] "Bimetallic surface chemistry plays a crucial role in a number of technologically important areas, including catalysis, magneto-optical films, microelectronics fabrication, electrochemistry, corrosion passivation, and structural materials."
[2] "With the advent of ultrahigh vacuum surface analytical techniques and the development of efficient methods for surface preparation, it has become possible since approximately 1970 to prepare clean single-crystal bimetallic surfaces that are well characterized with respect to the geometric locations of the two different metal elements and that are very homogeneous in this surface structure."
[3] "Such structure/function relationships must ultimately form the basis for any predictive ability in tailor-making bimetallic surfaces to have desirable reactive properties."
[4] "The vapor deposition of one metal onto a single-crystal surface of the second metal is another method for preparing bimetallic surfaces. This method has the advantage that the whole surface composition range is easily accessible."
