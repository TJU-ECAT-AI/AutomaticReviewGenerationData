The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has seen a significant focus on leveraging the unique electronic and chemical properties of these materials to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These advancements have been pivotal in both fundamental research and practical applications. The introduction of gold (Au) clusters onto platinum (Pt) nanoparticles has demonstrated a remarkable ability to stabilize Pt against dissolution under potential cycling regimes, which is a persistent challenge in vehicle applications. This stabilization is attributed to the raised Pt oxidation potential conferred by the Au clusters. The high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity observed on modified Pt/C electrocatalysts containing Au clusters is counterintuitive, as Au typically does not act as an effective catalyst for the ORR to H2O. This activity is attributed to interactions between the Au clusters and oxides, leading to charged Au particles. These interactions, along with the possibility of efficient spillover of H2O2 from Au clusters to the surrounding Pt atoms, may facilitate the reduction of H2O2 to H2O, contributing to the negligible loss of activity of the Pt surface toward ORR. These findings offer promising possibilities for synthesizing improved ORR Pt-based catalysts and stabilizing Pt and other Pt-group metals under oxidizing conditions.

自二元催化剂商业引入以来，它们在异质催化中的演变已经集中在利用这些材料的独特电子和化学性质来弥合模型表面与工业相关支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。这些进展在基础研究和实际应用中都至关重要。向铂（Pt）纳米颗粒添加金（Au）簇的引入，证明了Pt可以抵抗溶解，在潜在循环制度下，这在车辆应用中是一个持续的问题。这种稳定性的获得归因于Au簇提升的Pt氧化电位。观察到在修改后的Pt/C电解催化剂上含有Au簇的高氧还原反应（ORR）活性是出乎意料的，因为Au通常不作为有效催化剂用于将O2还原为H2O。这种活性归因于Au簇与氧化物之间的相互作用，导致形成带电的Au粒子。这些相互作用，以及从Au簇到周围Pt原子高效扩散的H2O2的可能性，可能有助于将H2O2还原为H2O，从而解释了Pt表面对ORR损失活动的微小程度。这些发现为合成改进的ORR Pt基催化剂和在氧化条件下稳定Pt和其他Pt族金属提供了有前景的可能性。
