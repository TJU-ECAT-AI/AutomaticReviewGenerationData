[1] "The Au clusters have a stabilizing effect on an underlying Pt metal surface under highly oxidizing conditions and suppress Pt dissolution during the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) during potential cycling, without decreasing the oxygen reduction kinetics."
[2] "Recent work recorded a substantial loss of the Pt surface area over time in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) (11) during the stop-and-go driving of an electric car; this depletion exceeded the Pt dissolution rates observed upon holding at constant potentials (12) for extended time spans."
[3] "Voltammetry was used to determine the Pt surface area of the Au/Pt/C and Pt/C electrodes by measuring H adsorption before and after potential cycling. Integrating the charge between 0 and 0.36 V associated with H adsorption for Au/Pt/C shows no change, indicating no recordable loss of Pt surface area."
[4] "For the Pt/C catalyst (11.9 μgPt/cm2), the measured degradation of the half-wave potential (E1/2) after 30,000 cycles (at room temperature) was 39 mV. If the Pt specific activity does not vary significantly with the potential cycling, and assuming a constant Tafel slope b of 120 mV, the remaining Pt surface area after potential cycling can be estimated by using the expression (see the supporting online material) ΔE1/2 = b × log(SPt/SPt0), where SPt is the Pt surface area after cycling and SPt0 is the initial Pt surface area."
[5] "This stabilizing effect of Au clusters and lack of ORR inhibition, despite blockage of approximately one-third of the Pt sites on Au/Pt/C by Au, are intriguing phenomena that may have additional applications beyond fuel cells."

The stabilization of platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts through modification with gold (Au) clusters has been demonstrated. This approach enhances the stability of Pt nanoparticles under potential cycling regimes, a critical issue in vehicle applications. The Au clusters confer stability by raising the Pt oxidation potential, preventing Pt dissolution during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) without compromising the oxygen reduction kinetics. This method offers promise in resolving the instability of Pt electrocatalysts in fuel cells, particularly in transportation contexts, by mitigating Pt surface area loss over time, which exceeds Pt dissolution rates under constant potential conditions. Moreover, the stabilization effect of Au clusters on Pt, alongside their lack of inhibiting the oxygen reduction reaction, suggests potential applications beyond fuel cells.

通过将金（Au）簇修改到铂（Pt）纳米粒子上，已经证明可以稳定化铂（Pt）氧气还原燃料电池催化剂。这种方法在电化学循环条件下增强了铂（Pt）纳米颗粒的稳定性，这是汽车应用中的一个关键问题。Au簇通过提高Pt氧化势能提供稳定性，防止Pt溶解于氧还原反应（ORR）期间，同时不损害氧还原动力学。这种方法有望解决燃料电池中Pt电催化剂的不稳定性问题，特别是对于运输应用而言，通过减少Pt表面面积随时间的损失，该损失超过了在长时间内保持恒定电位条件下的Pt溶解速率。此外，Au簇对Pt的稳定作用，以及它们对氧气还原反应的抑制作用，表明Au簇可能在燃料电池之外的应用领域具有潜力。
