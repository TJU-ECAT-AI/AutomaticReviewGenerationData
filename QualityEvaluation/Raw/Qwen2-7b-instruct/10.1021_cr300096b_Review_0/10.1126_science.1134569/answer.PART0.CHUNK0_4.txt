[1] "Despite considerable recent advances, existing fuel-cell technology still has drawbacks, including the instability of the Pt electrocatalyst for the ORR at the cathode (10)."
[2] "Recent work recorded a substantial loss of the Pt surface area over time in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) (11) during the stop-and-go driving of an electric car; this depletion exceeded the Pt dissolution rates observed upon holding at constant potentials (12) for extended time spans."
[3] "The Au clusters have a stabilizing effect on an underlying Pt metal surface under highly oxidizing conditions and suppress Pt dissolution during the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) during potential cycling, without decreasing the oxygen reduction kinetics."
[4] "Voltammetry was used to determine the Pt surface area of the Au/Pt/C and Pt/C electrodes by measuring H adsorption before and after potential cycling. Integrating the charge between 0 and 0.36 V associated with H adsorption for Au/Pt/C shows no change, indicating no recordable loss of Pt surface area."
[5] "In the XANES spectra for Au/Pt/C at the Pt L3 edge (Fig. 4A), the intensity of the absorption bands reflects the depletion of the d band caused by the oxidation of Pt; a very small potential dependence indicates such oxidation."

1. Bimetallic catalysts have evolved in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction by incorporating unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These properties allow for enhanced stability, activity, and selectivity, contributing to both fundamental research and practical applications in various industries.
