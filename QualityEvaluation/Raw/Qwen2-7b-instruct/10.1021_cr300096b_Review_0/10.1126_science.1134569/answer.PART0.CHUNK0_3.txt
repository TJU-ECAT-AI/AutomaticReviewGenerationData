[1] "Our results show promise toward resolving this impediment."
[2] "The high ORR activity of the Au clusters on a modified Pt/C electrocatalyst is a counterintuitive observation."
[3] "The surface reaction involves the formation of PtOH and PtO derived from the oxidation of water that causes the dissolution of Pt via the Pt2+ oxidation state (12)."
[4] "The small difference in the ring currents of the two surfaces corroborates this conclusion."
[5] "The catalytic activity of Au/Pt/C, measured as the currents of O2 reduction obtained before and after potential cycling, showed only a 5-mV degradation in half-wave potential over the cycling period (Fig. 3A); in contrast, the corresponding change for Pt/C amounts to a loss of 39 mV (Fig. 3C)."

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by advancements in understanding and leveraging their unique electronic and chemical properties to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These properties allow for enhanced selectivity, stability, and activity compared to their monometallic counterparts. By combining the strengths of two different metals, bimetallic catalysts can achieve superior performance in various applications, such as more efficient conversion of reactants, increased stability under harsh conditions, and broader operational windows. This has been facilitated by advances in synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and theoretical modeling that enable the precise control of catalyst structure and composition. As a result, bimetallic catalysts have become increasingly integrated into industrial processes, offering solutions to challenges related to sustainability, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
