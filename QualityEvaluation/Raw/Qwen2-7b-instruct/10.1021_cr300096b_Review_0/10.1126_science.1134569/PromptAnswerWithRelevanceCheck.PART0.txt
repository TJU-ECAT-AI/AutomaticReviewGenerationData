The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has seen a significant focus on leveraging the unique electronic and chemical properties of these materials to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These advancements have been pivotal in both fundamental research and practical applications. The introduction of gold (Au) clusters onto platinum (Pt) nanoparticles has demonstrated a remarkable ability to stabilize Pt against dissolution under potential cycling regimes, which is a persistent challenge in vehicle applications. This stabilization is attributed to the raised Pt oxidation potential conferred by the Au clusters. The high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity observed on modified Pt/C electrocatalysts containing Au clusters is counterintuitive, as Au typically does not act as an effective catalyst for the ORR to H2O. This activity is attributed to interactions between the Au clusters and oxides, leading to charged Au particles. These interactions, along with the possibility of efficient spillover of H2O2 from Au clusters to the surrounding Pt atoms, may facilitate the reduction of H2O2 to H2O, contributing to the negligible loss of activity of the Pt surface toward ORR. These findings offer promising possibilities for synthesizing improved ORR Pt-based catalysts and stabilizing Pt and other Pt-group metals under oxidizing conditions.

自二元催化剂商业引入以来，它们在异质催化中的演变已经集中在利用这些材料的独特电子和化学性质来弥合模型表面与工业相关支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。这些进展在基础研究和实际应用中都至关重要。向铂（Pt）纳米颗粒添加金（Au）簇的引入，证明了Pt可以抵抗溶解，在潜在循环制度下，这在车辆应用中是一个持续的问题。这种稳定性的获得归因于Au簇提升的Pt氧化电位。观察到在修改后的Pt/C电解催化剂上含有Au簇的高氧还原反应（ORR）活性是出乎意料的，因为Au通常不作为有效催化剂用于将O2还原为H2O。这种活性归因于Au簇与氧化物之间的相互作用，导致形成带电的Au粒子。这些相互作用，以及从Au簇到周围Pt原子高效扩散的H2O2的可能性，可能有助于将H2O2还原为H2O，从而解释了Pt表面对ORR损失活动的微小程度。这些发现为合成改进的ORR Pt基催化剂和在氧化条件下稳定Pt和其他Pt族金属提供了有前景的可能性。

[1] "The Au clusters have a stabilizing effect on an underlying Pt metal surface under highly oxidizing conditions and suppress Pt dissolution during the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) during potential cycling, without decreasing the oxygen reduction kinetics."
[2] "Recent work recorded a substantial loss of the Pt surface area over time in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) (11) during the stop-and-go driving of an electric car; this depletion exceeded the Pt dissolution rates observed upon holding at constant potentials (12) for extended time spans."
[3] "Voltammetry was used to determine the Pt surface area of the Au/Pt/C and Pt/C electrodes by measuring H adsorption before and after potential cycling. Integrating the charge between 0 and 0.36 V associated with H adsorption for Au/Pt/C shows no change, indicating no recordable loss of Pt surface area."
[4] "For the Pt/C catalyst (11.9 μgPt/cm2), the measured degradation of the half-wave potential (E1/2) after 30,000 cycles (at room temperature) was 39 mV. If the Pt specific activity does not vary significantly with the potential cycling, and assuming a constant Tafel slope b of 120 mV, the remaining Pt surface area after potential cycling can be estimated by using the expression (see the supporting online material) ΔE1/2 = b × log(SPt/SPt0), where SPt is the Pt surface area after cycling and SPt0 is the initial Pt surface area."
[5] "This stabilizing effect of Au clusters and lack of ORR inhibition, despite blockage of approximately one-third of the Pt sites on Au/Pt/C by Au, are intriguing phenomena that may have additional applications beyond fuel cells."

The stabilization of platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts through modification with gold (Au) clusters has been demonstrated. This approach enhances the stability of Pt nanoparticles under potential cycling regimes, a critical issue in vehicle applications. The Au clusters confer stability by raising the Pt oxidation potential, preventing Pt dissolution during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) without compromising the oxygen reduction kinetics. This method offers promise in resolving the instability of Pt electrocatalysts in fuel cells, particularly in transportation contexts, by mitigating Pt surface area loss over time, which exceeds Pt dissolution rates under constant potential conditions. Moreover, the stabilization effect of Au clusters on Pt, alongside their lack of inhibiting the oxygen reduction reaction, suggests potential applications beyond fuel cells.

通过将金（Au）簇修改到铂（Pt）纳米粒子上，已经证明可以稳定化铂（Pt）氧气还原燃料电池催化剂。这种方法在电化学循环条件下增强了铂（Pt）纳米颗粒的稳定性，这是汽车应用中的一个关键问题。Au簇通过提高Pt氧化势能提供稳定性，防止Pt溶解于氧还原反应（ORR）期间，同时不损害氧还原动力学。这种方法有望解决燃料电池中Pt电催化剂的不稳定性问题，特别是对于运输应用而言，通过减少Pt表面面积随时间的损失，该损失超过了在长时间内保持恒定电位条件下的Pt溶解速率。此外，Au簇对Pt的稳定作用，以及它们对氧气还原反应的抑制作用，表明Au簇可能在燃料电池之外的应用领域具有潜力。

The stabilization of platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts against dissolution was achieved by modifying Pt nanoparticles with gold (Au) clusters. This was observed under oxidizing conditions during potential cycling between 0.6 and 1.1 volts in over 30,000 cycles. The Au clusters conferred stability by raising the Pt oxidation potential, preventing significant changes in the activity and surface area of Au-modified Pt compared to the pure Pt catalyst. Voltammetry and in situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy data supported the stabilization mechanism.
