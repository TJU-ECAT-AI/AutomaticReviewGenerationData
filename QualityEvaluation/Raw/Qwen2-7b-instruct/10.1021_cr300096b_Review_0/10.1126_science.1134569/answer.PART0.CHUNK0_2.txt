[1] "Recent work recorded a substantial loss of the Pt surface area over time in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) (11) during the stop-and-go driving of an electric car; this depletion exceeded the Pt dissolution rates observed upon holding at constant potentials (12) for extended time spans."
[2] "We found that the Pt nanoparticles retain their ORR activity crucial for fuel-cell catalysts after the deposition of Au clusters."
[3] "Voltammetry was used to determine the Pt surface area of the Au/Pt/C and Pt/C electrodes by measuring H adsorption before and after potential cycling."
[4] "The high Pt oxidation potential of the Au/Pt/C electrocatalyst (that is, the lower extent of Pt oxidation) is clearly the major mechanism for the stabilization effect of Au clusters."
[5] "Table 1 gives a summary of the observed changes in surface area and catalytic activity data caused by potential cycling."

The stabilization of platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts against dissolution was achieved by modifying Pt nanoparticles with gold (Au) clusters. This was observed under oxidizing conditions during potential cycling between 0.6 and 1.1 volts in over 30,000 cycles. The Au clusters conferred stability by raising the Pt oxidation potential, preventing significant changes in the activity and surface area of Au-modified Pt compared to the pure Pt catalyst. Voltammetry and in situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy data supported the stabilization mechanism.

在氧化条件下，通过将铂（Pt）氧还原燃料电池电催化剂的纳米颗粒改性为金（Au）簇，实现了Pt的稳定化，防止了溶解。在0.6至1.1伏特之间的潜在循环中进行了超过30,000次循环。Au簇通过提高Pt氧化势能，防止Pt活性和表面面积发生显著变化，与纯Pt催化剂相比，这提供了稳定性。原位x射线吸收近边光谱数据和伏安法支持了稳定化机制。
