Bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis have evolved significantly over the past decade, moving from simple alloy structures to more complex architectures. These advancements enhance the catalysts' activity and selectivity. The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic systems enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable supported catalysts. This enhancement is crucial for both scientific research and real-world applications, promoting more efficient and selective catalytic processes.
