Bimetallic catalysts have significantly evolved since their commercial introduction, demonstrating enhanced activity and selectivity in various chemical reactions. They bridge the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between model surfaces and industrially relevant catalysts, offering superior performance compared to single metal catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties enable better control over reaction pathways and intermediate stabilization, providing insights into complex catalytic mechanisms in fundamental research. Practically, they improve industrial processes, resulting in higher yields and lower costs.
