Answer: The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts have evolved in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. It also lacks details on how their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications.
