The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism for ethylene hydrogenation over Pd(111) is examined using first-principle density functional quantum chemical calculations. Cluster and periodic slab DFT-GGA calculations were carried out to determine the modes and energies of chemisorption for a sequence of proposed intermediates, along with overall reaction energies and activation barriers for each of the speculated elementary steps. The DFT-calculated binding energies for ethylene (π), ethylene (di-σ), ethyl, vinyl, ethylidyne, atomic oxygen, and atomic carbon on the Pd19 cluster (and the Pd(111) slab) were found to be 30 (27), 60 (62), 130 (140), 237 (254), 620 (636), 375 (400), and 610 (635) kJ/mol. The slab results were found to be within 20 kJ/mol of the cluster results.

At low surface coverages, the predicted intrinsic activation barriers are +72 kJ/mol for the hydrogenation of ethlyene to surface ethyl and +71 kJ/mol for ethyl to ethane. The corresponding overall reaction energies for these two steps are +3 and 5 (without lateral interactions) kJ/mol, respectively.

At lower coverages, the π-bound state was found to simply be a precursor intermediate to the di-σ-state. At higher coverages, the nature of other surface intermediates such as oxygen, carbon, and ethylidyne all become more important as they can block adsorption sites and/or change the local electronic structure and hence surface reactivity.

The calculated barrier was found to be +87 kJ/mol for the idealized state of infinite separation between ethylene and hydrogen in the reactant state. When the two surface species share a metal atom neighbor the barrier was reduced to +72 kJ/mol due to the repulsive interactions (+15 kJ/mol) between these species.

At lower coverages, the π-bound state was found to simply be a precursor intermediate to the di-σ-state. At higher coverages, the activation barriers for the hydrogenation of ethylene to ethyl were calculated to be +82 and +36 kJ/mol for the di-σ- and π-bound intermediates, respectively.

At lower coverages, the π-bound state was a precursor to the di-σ-state. At higher coverages, the π-bound state became the key reactive intermediate. The activation barriers for hydrogenation were +82 and +36 kJ/mol for the di-σ- and π-bound intermediates, respectively.

对于乙烯氢化在Pd(111)上的HoriutiPolanyi机制，使用量子化学计算进行了研究。乙烯、乙基、乙烯基、乙炔、原子氧和原子碳的结合能分别为30（27），60（62），130（140），237（254），620（636），375（400）和610（635）kJ/mol。乙烯到表面乙基和乙基到乙烷的内在激活势垒分别为+72 kJ/mol和+71 kJ/mol。在较低覆盖率下，π键状态是di-σ状态的前体。在较高覆盖率下，π键状态成为了关键的反应中间体。氢化反应的势垒分别为+82和+36 kJ/mol，对应于di-σ和π键中间体。
