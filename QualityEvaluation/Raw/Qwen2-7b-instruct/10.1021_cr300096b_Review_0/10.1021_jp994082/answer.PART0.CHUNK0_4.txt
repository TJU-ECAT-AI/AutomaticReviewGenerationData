The DFT-calculated binding energies for ethylene (π), ethylene (di-σ), ethyl, vinyl, ethylidyne, atomic oxygen, and atomic carbon on the Pd19 cluster (and the Pd(111) slab) were found to be 30 (27), 60 (62), 130 (140), 237 (254), 620 (636), 375 (400), and 610 (635) kJ/mol. The slab results were found to be within 20 kJ/mol of the cluster results.

The vibrational frequencies for the di-σ-adsorption mode are shown in Table 3. The metalcarbon, CH2 bending/CC stretching modes, and the CH stretch modes appear at 256, 341, 587, 9681131, and 30203063 cm-1, respectively. The results are very similar to those found for the π-bound mode as well as those reported from experiment.

The calculated barrier for this transition state was found to be over 120 kJ/mol. The metal surface, however, can help to stabilize the transition state if the ethylenehydrogen reaction ensemble is allowed to spread out over neighboring metal atoms. This avoids steric crowding and enables both ethylene and hydrogen fragments in the transition state to interact with the surface. The isolated transition state for this reaction is depicted in Figure 17.
