The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism for ethylene hydrogenation over Pd(111) is analyzed through first-principle density functional quantum chemical calculations. At low surface coverages, the intrinsic activation barriers for the hydrogenation of ethylene to surface ethyl are +72 kJ/mol, and for ethyl to ethane, they are +71 kJ/mol. At higher surface coverages, the calculated barrier for the hydrogenation of ethylene from the π-bound state is +36 kJ/mol, which aligns with experimentally reported ethylene hydrogenation barriers.

对Pd(111)上的乙烯氢化使用第一原理密度泛函量子化学计算进行了HoriutiPolanyi机制分析。在低表面覆盖率下，乙烷氢化到表面乙基的内在活化壁垒为72千焦每摩尔，而乙基氢化到乙烷的壁垒为71千焦每摩尔。在较高表面覆盖率下，从π结合状态氢化乙烯的计算壁垒为36千焦每摩尔，这与实验报告的乙烯氢化壁垒一致。
