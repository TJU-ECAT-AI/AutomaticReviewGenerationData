The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism for ethylene hydrogenation over Pd(111) is examined using first-principle density functional quantum chemical calculations. Cluster and periodic slab DFT-GGA calculations were carried out to determine the modes and energies of chemisorption for a sequence of proposed intermediates, along with overall reaction energies and activation barriers for each of the speculated elementary steps. The DFT-calculated binding energies for ethylene (π), ethylene (di-σ), ethyl, vinyl, ethylidyne, atomic oxygen, and atomic carbon on the Pd19 cluster (and the Pd(111) slab) were found to be 30 (27), 60 (62), 130 (140), 237 (254), 620 (636), 375 (400), and 610 (635) kJ/mol. The slab results were found to be within 20 kJ/mol of the cluster results.

At low surface coverages, the predicted intrinsic activation barriers are +72 kJ/mol for the hydrogenation of ethlyene to surface ethyl and +71 kJ/mol for ethyl to ethane. The corresponding overall reaction energies for these two steps are +3 and 5 (without lateral interactions) kJ/mol, respectively.

At lower coverages, the π-bound state was found to simply be a precursor intermediate to the di-σ-state. At higher coverages, the nature of other surface intermediates such as oxygen, carbon, and ethylidyne all become more important as they can block adsorption sites and/or change the local electronic structure and hence surface reactivity.

The calculated barrier was found to be +87 kJ/mol for the idealized state of infinite separation between ethylene and hydrogen in the reactant state. When the two surface species share a metal atom neighbor the barrier was reduced to +72 kJ/mol due to the repulsive interactions (+15 kJ/mol) between these species.

At lower coverages, the π-bound state was found to simply be a precursor intermediate to the di-σ-state. At higher coverages, the activation barriers for the hydrogenation of ethylene to ethyl were calculated to be +82 and +36 kJ/mol for the di-σ- and π-bound intermediates, respectively.

[1] "The results presented so far provide the picture for what happens on the pristine low coverage Pd(111) surface. It is well established that the relative abundance of different surface species and their role in the mechanism can change as the pressure and hence the surface coverage are increased to mimic actual reaction condition. Below we examine the effects of higher surface coverages of ethylidyne, atomic carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen on chemisorption and hydrogenation reactivity."

[2] "Both low pressure surface science as well as higher pressure fixed-bed reactor studies indicate that ethylidyne is present to a significant extent on Pd and Pt under reaction conditions. Ethylidyne is the primary decomposition product of ethylene and is taught only to be a spectator species."

[3] "The binding energy of ethylidyne at the 3-fold fcc site on Pd(111) is 620 and 636 kJ/mol, respectively. The optimized structures for ethylidyne on the Pd19 cluster and the 3-layer Pd slab are shown in Figure 13."

[4] "Ethylene is thought to readily convert to ethylidyne on supported Pd particles.6,86 The conversion of ethylene on Pd(111) however is thought to be significantly lower. 87-89 This is most likely due to the presence of unsaturated defect sites on the supported particles as compared to the well-defined Pd(111) surface."

[5] "As was indicated, the working surface of an ethylene hydrogenation catalyst may contain considerable amounts of ethylidyne and other hydrocarbon intermediates which can significantly affect chemisorption and surface reactivity."

[6] "Ethylene is thought to readily convert to ethylidyne on supported Pd particles.6,86 The conversion of ethylene on Pd(111) however is thought to be significantly lower."

[7] "The influence of oxygen on the chemisorption of ethylene depends on the ethylene adsorption mode, the surface coverage, as well as the specific local bonding configuration of ethylene and oxygen."

[8] "We find very similar results when ethylene is adsorbed on surfaces covered with carbon. This analysis more closely mimics the surface under working reaction conditions where a fair amount of surface carbon intermediates exist."

[9] "Adsorbateadsorbate interactions not only change the energy of adsorption but can also significantly alter the activation barriers as well as the reaction selectivity."

[10] "First-principle density functional theoretical calculations were used to help provide a more detailed atomic view of the ethylene chemisorption and hydrogenation on well-defined model Pd(111) systems."

The calculated barrier for this transition state was found to be over 120 kJ/mol. The metal surface, however, can help to stabilize the transition state if the ethylenehydrogen reaction ensemble is allowed to spread out over neighboring metal atoms. This avoids steric crowding and enables both ethylene and hydrogen fragments in the transition state to interact with the surface. The isolated transition state for this reaction is depicted in Figure 17.
