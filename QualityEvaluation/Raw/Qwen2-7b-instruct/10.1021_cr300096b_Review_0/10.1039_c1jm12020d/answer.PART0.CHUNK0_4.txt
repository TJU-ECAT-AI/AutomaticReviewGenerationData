[1] "Heterometallic NPs composed of two or more metal elements with various nanostructures (alloy/intermetallics, coreshell, heterostructure, etc.) via different synthesis approaches have presented improved physical and chemical properties compared to their monometallic NPs in many fields, especially in catalysis."
[2] "Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts. The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit."
[3] "In the successive two-step reduction approach, it is fairly difficult to obtain the coreshell NPs on the sub-10 nm scale, especially in the absence of a stabilizer/surfactant."

How have bimetallic catalysts evolved in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, and how do their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications?

Bimetallic catalysts have significantly evolved in heterogeneous catalysis, offering improved physical and chemical properties compared to monometallic nanoparticles (NPs) in various fields, notably catalysis. The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts, such as the strong metal-metal interactions that stabilize the transition state on alloy catalyst surfaces more effectively than monometallic surfaces, contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap." These properties enable bimetallic catalysts to perform better under industrial conditions, enhancing their applicability in both fundamental research and practical applications.

In the preparation of bimetallic coreshell nanoparticles, the challenge lies in achieving the sub-10 nm scale without the aid of stabilizers or surfactants, particularly in the two-step reduction approach. This highlights the complexity and intricacy involved in the synthesis of bimetallic coreshell NPs, emphasizing the need for advanced techniques to control the structure and properties of these materials.

自商业应用以来，双金属催化剂在异质催化领域经历了显著发展，它们与单一金属纳米颗粒相比，在多种领域（尤其是催化）展现出改进的物理和化学性质。双金属催化剂的独特电子和化学特性，如强金属-金属相互作用，能更有效地稳定合金催化剂表面的过渡态，相比于单一金属表面，这一特性有助于弥合“材料差距”和“压力差距”。这些特性使双金属催化剂能够在工业条件下表现出更好的性能，从而增强其在基础研究和实际应用中的适用性。

在双金属核壳纳米粒子的制备中，挑战在于在缺乏稳定剂或表面活性剂的情况下实现亚10纳米尺度，尤其是在两步还原方法中。这突出了合成双金属核壳纳米粒子时结构和性质控制的复杂性和精细性，强调了需要先进的技术来控制这些材料的特性和结构。
