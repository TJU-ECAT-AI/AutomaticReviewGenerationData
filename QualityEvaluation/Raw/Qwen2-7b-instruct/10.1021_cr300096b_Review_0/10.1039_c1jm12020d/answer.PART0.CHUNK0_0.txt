[1] "Bimetallic NPs have been emerging as a type of important catalyst."
[2] "The strong metal-metal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit."
[3] "Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts."
[4] "For coreshell structured heterometallic NPs with the same shell composition, their catalytic activity can also be changed with the core metal due to the so-called ligand effect."
[5] "The properties of the catalyst surfaces are closely correlated with the catalytic activities."
[6] "The chemical and physical properties of alloy NPs can be well tuned by varying the size, composition and atomic ordering."
[7] "The stepwise synthesis was also employed for successful preparation of triple-layered Pd@Au@FePt NPs, in which Pd@Au NPs served as NP seeds for further FePt shell coating."

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Bimetallic catalysts offer distinct binding properties with reactants, surpassing those of monometallic catalysts due to the strong metal-metal interactions that stabilize the transition state on alloy catalysts. This provides an additional benefit compared to monometallic catalysts. The ability to tailor these properties through varying the size, composition, and atomic ordering of the alloy nanoparticles allows for fine-tuning of the catalyst's performance. The ligand effect, which changes the catalytic activity with the core metal in coreshell structured heterometallic NPs, further enhances their versatility. The surface electronic states, closely correlated with the catalytic activities, are significantly altered by the geometric parameters of the catalyst surfaces, including local strain and effective atomic coordination numbers. This adaptability makes bimetallic catalysts highly effective in both fundamental research and practical applications.
