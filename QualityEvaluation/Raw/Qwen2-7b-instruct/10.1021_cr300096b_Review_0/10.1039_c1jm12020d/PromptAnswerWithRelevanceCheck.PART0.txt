The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Bimetallic catalysts offer distinct binding properties with reactants, surpassing those of monometallic catalysts due to the strong metal-metal interactions that stabilize the transition state on alloy catalysts. This provides an additional benefit compared to monometallic catalysts. The ability to tailor these properties through varying the size, composition, and atomic ordering of the alloy nanoparticles allows for fine-tuning of the catalyst's performance. The ligand effect, which changes the catalytic activity with the core metal in coreshell structured heterometallic NPs, further enhances their versatility. The surface electronic states, closely correlated with the catalytic activities, are significantly altered by the geometric parameters of the catalyst surfaces, including local strain and effective atomic coordination numbers. This adaptability makes bimetallic catalysts highly effective in both fundamental research and practical applications.

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction has been marked by advancements that bridge the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between model surfaces and practical industrial catalysts. These catalysts exhibit unique electronic and chemical properties that significantly enhance catalytic activity. The electronic interactions among metals often lead to modifications of the electronic structure, thereby boosting the catalytic efficiency. The addition of a less active or inactive metal species can sometimes improve the overall activity of bimetallic nanoparticles by indirect mechanisms. For instance, the presence of rhodium (Rh) can increase the thermal stability of a catalyst, tin (Sn) can prevent sintering in certain bimetallic structures, and gold (Au) can reduce poisoning effects. In some cases, the predominant reaction pathway shifts from one to a more desirable one upon alloying, leading to improved catalytic performance. Theoretical calculations play a crucial role in guiding the selection of catalyst compositions for intelligent design purposes, offering insights into the fundamental factors that govern their activity.
