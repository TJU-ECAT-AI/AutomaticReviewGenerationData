<p>Despite the commercial introduction of bimetallic catalysts, their unique electronic and chemical properties have significantly bridged the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These properties enable the creation of catalysts with superior activity and selectivity, overcoming limitations encountered with single-metal catalysts.</p>
<p>In heterogeneous catalysis, bimetallic catalysts often exhibit enhanced activity due to the synergistic effects between the metals. This is attributed to the modification of electronic structures and geometric effects that lead to optimized catalytic sites and pathways.</p>
<p>The ability to tailor the composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts allows for the customization of catalytic properties to match specific reaction requirements. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the "pressure gap," as it enables the optimization of catalysts for industrially relevant conditions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the use of less expensive metals in bimetallic catalysts can help address the "materials gap" by reducing costs and making catalysts more economically viable for large-scale industrial applications. The synergy between metals in these catalysts often leads to performance that surpasses that of single-metal catalysts, making them a promising avenue for catalytic research and development.</p>
