The evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction has been marked by advancements that bridge the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between model surfaces and practical industrial catalysts. These catalysts exhibit unique electronic and chemical properties that significantly enhance catalytic activity. The electronic interactions among metals often lead to modifications of the electronic structure, thereby boosting the catalytic efficiency. The addition of a less active or inactive metal species can sometimes improve the overall activity of bimetallic nanoparticles by indirect mechanisms. For instance, the presence of rhodium (Rh) can increase the thermal stability of a catalyst, tin (Sn) can prevent sintering in certain bimetallic structures, and gold (Au) can reduce poisoning effects. In some cases, the predominant reaction pathway shifts from one to a more desirable one upon alloying, leading to improved catalytic performance. Theoretical calculations play a crucial role in guiding the selection of catalyst compositions for intelligent design purposes, offering insights into the fundamental factors that govern their activity.

自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂的发展已经显著。它们提供了独特的电子和化学性质，能够弥合模型表面与工业相关支撑催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。这些催化剂表现出独特的电子和化学特性，显著提高了催化活性。金属之间的电子相互作用往往导致电子结构的修改，从而提高催化效率。在许多情况下，添加较不活跃或无活性的金属可以通过间接机制提高双金属纳米粒子的整体活性。例如，铑（Rh）的存在可以增加催化剂的热稳定性，锡（Sn）可以防止某些双金属结构的烧结，而金（Au）可以减少中毒效应。在某些情况下，通过合金化，主导反应路径从一个转变为更理想的路径，从而提高催化性能。理论计算在指导催化剂成分的选择以实现智能设计方面起着关键作用，提供关于决定其活性的基本因素的见解。
