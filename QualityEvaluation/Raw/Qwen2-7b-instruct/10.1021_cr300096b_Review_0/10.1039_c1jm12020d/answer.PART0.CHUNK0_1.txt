[1] "Recent progress in synergistic catalysis over heterometallic nanoparticles Heterometallic nanoparticles (NPs) have been emerging as a type of important catalyst. Bimetallic NPs with alloyed and coreshell structures have higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis due to the synergistic effects between the two metals."
[2] "In addition, synergistic catalysis over trimetallic and multimetallic NPs has also received considerable interest in recent years."
[3] "For coreshell structured heterometallic NPs with the same shell composition, their catalytic activity can also be changed with the core metal due to the so-called ligand effect."
[4] "The strong synergistic effect was present in a large range of Au/Pd ratio, being maximized for the Au90Pd10 composition."
[5] "The AuPd alloys supported on AC with AuPd compositions ranging from 90:10 to 60:40 are also very active in the liquid-phase oxidation of alcohols such as benzylic alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, octenol and octanol, confirming the high synergistic effect of the alloy."
[6] "In contrast to the monometallic catalysts, the bimetallic PtRhBHA sample not only showed enhanced activity with ignition of the CH4/air stream at 450 C and full CH4 conversion around 550 C (50100 C lower than those of the other samples, Fig. 4b); most importantly, it was stable over successive ignitionextinction cycles."
[7] "The correlation between the atomic structures and the catalytic activities indicated that the random alloy structure enhanced the activity."
[8] "The AuPd/CeO2 catalyst exhibited a prolonged catalyst life although a small, inhomogeneous Pd leaching could be observed."
[9] "The AuPd@Au/C catalyst possesses superior and stable activity as well as high selectivity at low temperature in hydrogen generation from formic acid decomposition."

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has seen a significant shift towards heterometallic nanoparticles (NPs) featuring alloyed and coreshell structures. These nanoparticles offer enhanced catalytic activities compared to monometallic counterparts due to the synergistic effects between the two metals. Recent interest has also expanded to trimetallic and multimetallic NPs, where the catalytic activity can be fine-tuned by the core metal, influenced by the ligand effect. The Au/Pd ratio plays a crucial role in achieving the highest synergistic effect, particularly for Au90Pd10 compositions. These bimetallic alloys show high activity in liquid-phase oxidation of alcohols, confirming their high synergistic effect. Furthermore, bimetallic systems like PtRhBHA demonstrate enhanced activity and stability, requiring less energy for CH4 ignition and full conversion at lower temperatures compared to other catalysts. The random alloy structure in these catalysts contributes to their enhanced activity. Bimetallic NPs also exhibit prolonged catalyst life, stability, and high selectivity in hydrogen generation from formic acid decomposition, showcasing the potential of these materials in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

自商业引入以来，异金属纳米粒子（NPs）在异质催化中的演变已转向包含合金和壳层结构的双金属纳米粒子。这些纳米粒子由于两种金属之间的协同效应而表现出比单一金属对应的高催化活性。近年来，对三元金属和多金属纳米粒子的兴趣也有所增加，其中催化剂活性可以通过核心金属进行微调，受所谓的配体效应影响。Au/Pd比例在实现最高协同效应中扮演着关键角色，特别是对于Au90Pd10组成。这些双金属合金在醇的液相氧化中显示出高活性，确认了它们的高协同效应。此外，像PtRhBHA这样的双金属系统展示了增强的活性和稳定性，需要较少的能量进行CH4点火和在较低温度下进行全转化，与其它催化剂相比。这些催化剂的随机合金结构对其活性贡献显著。双金属纳米粒子还表现出催化剂寿命长、稳定性和在从甲醛分解产生氢气时的高选择性，这表明这些材料有可能在模型表面和工业相关支持催化剂之间架起“材料差距”和“压力差距”。
