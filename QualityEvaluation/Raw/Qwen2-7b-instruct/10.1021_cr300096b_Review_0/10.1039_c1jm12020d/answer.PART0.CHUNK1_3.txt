The evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction has been marked by their integration of unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties effectively bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their superior performance in heterogeneous catalysis is attributed to their ability to exhibit higher catalytic activity and selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts. Tailoring the composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts allows for optimization of their performance for various industrial applications. The synergy between different metals within a bimetallic catalyst leads to enhanced catalytic behavior, making them valuable tools in both fundamental research and practical applications.
