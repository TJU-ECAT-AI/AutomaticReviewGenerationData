The SXPS studies have offered crucial insights into the interfacial properties of bimetallic systems. Surface alloy formation has significant implications for surface reactivity. All the presented data have focused on substrate core levels, while recently, shifts in 4f core levels for overlayer films of Pt, Ir, and Au on W(111) and W(211) have also been observed.
