[1] "We have summarized recent results from a comprehensive program to study the structural, chemical and electronic properties of morphologically unstable bimetallic surfaces. The data presented are among the first detailed microscopic studies of faceting of metals induced by ultrathin metallic films."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These advancements are crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications.
