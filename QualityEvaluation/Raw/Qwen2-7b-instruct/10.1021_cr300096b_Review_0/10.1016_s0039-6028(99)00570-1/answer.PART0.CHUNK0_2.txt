[1] "The faceting of metallic bcc (111) surfaces covered with certain adsorbed gases has been recognized for many years [1] ,[2] ,[3] , and more recent evidence has been found for faceting induced by ultrathin metal films [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ."
[2] "In the present paper, we summarize recent results that provide new insights into the morphological stability of film-covered W surfaces."
[3] "We believe that these results have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of dynamic morphological changes at the surfaces of bimetallic catalysts during operation."
