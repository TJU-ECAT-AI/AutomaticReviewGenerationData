[1] "The faceting of metallic bcc (111) surfaces covered with certain adsorbed gases has been recognized for many years."
[2] "In contrast to atomically smooth, close-packed substrates that comprise the majority of published studies on model thin film metal-on-metal systems."
[3] "We believe these results are important in understanding the mechanisms of possible dynamic structural rearrangements at the surfaces of high area bimetallic catalysts under high temperature operation."
[4] "Moreover, there are other implications for metal-induced faceting of W, in areas as diverse as the thermal stability of metallic vias and interconnects in microelectronics fabrication (where W is widely used) to the possible self-assembly of field-emitter arrays for flat-panel displays."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Faceting of metallic bcc (111) surfaces, particularly when induced by ultrathin metal films, has been recognized for many years. This phenomenon, characterized by the conversion of initially planar surfaces into a hill-and-valley structure, exposes low-Miller-index crystal faces of microscopic dimensions. The study of faceted surfaces and their properties, as well as the implications for bimetallic catalysts, is crucial for understanding dynamic structural changes at high-temperature operations. This research also holds significance in various fields such as microelectronics, where it impacts the thermal stability of metallic components, and in display technologies, potentially influencing the self-assembly of field-emitter arrays.
