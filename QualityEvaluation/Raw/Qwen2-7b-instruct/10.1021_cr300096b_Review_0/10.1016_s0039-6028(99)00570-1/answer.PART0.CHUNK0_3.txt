[1] "In the present paper, we summarize recent results that provide new insights into the morphological stability of film-covered W surfaces. We focus on three main aspects of the studies: surface structure and morphology, surface chemistry, and surface electronic properties."
[2] "The SXPS studies of bimetallic systems have provided important insights into interfacial properties."
[3] "In the cases of Pt and Ir, evidence for alloy film formation is seen from 4f7/2 core level shifts for both overlayer and substrate."
