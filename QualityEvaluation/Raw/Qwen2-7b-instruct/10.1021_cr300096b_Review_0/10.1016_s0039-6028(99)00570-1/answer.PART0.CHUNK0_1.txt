Faceting of metallic bcc (111) surfaces, particularly when induced by ultrathin metal films, has been recognized for many years. This phenomenon, characterized by the conversion of initially planar surfaces into a hill-and-valley structure, exposes low-Miller-index crystal faces of microscopic dimensions. The study of faceted surfaces and their properties, as well as the implications for bimetallic catalysts, is crucial for understanding dynamic structural changes at high-temperature operations. This research also holds significance in various fields such as microelectronics, where it impacts the thermal stability of metallic components, and in display technologies, potentially influencing the self-assembly of field-emitter arrays.
