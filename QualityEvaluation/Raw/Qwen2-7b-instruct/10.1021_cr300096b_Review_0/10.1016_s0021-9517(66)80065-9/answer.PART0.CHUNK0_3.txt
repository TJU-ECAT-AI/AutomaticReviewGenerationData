[1] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x, where F represents the moles of cyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams."
[2] "The effect of the difference in platinum dispersion on catalytic activity is shown by data on the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation to benzene over the two platinum catalysts. The data are given in Table 1."

The study found that the chemisorption of hydrogen on platinum supported on alumina and silica-alumina affects the degree of dispersion of the platinum. The platinum was dispersed to a much higher degree on alumina than on silica-alumina. The higher activity of the platinum on alumina for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater dispersion of the platinum on the support. The adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole. The results showed that the platinum-on-alumina catalyst had a higher activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation compared to the platinum-on-silica-alumina catalyst. The specific catalytic activity of the platinum for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is essentially unaffected by the support.

研究发现，铂在氧化铝和硅酸铝支持下的化学吸附氢气影响铂的分散程度。铂在氧化铝上的分散程度远高于在硅酸铝上的分散程度。铂在氧化铝上进行环己烷脱氢化反应时的高活性归因于铂在支撑物上的更高分散度。估算显示，在铂表面覆盖率为70%的适度高表面上吸附氢气是放热的，程度为7-8 kcal/mole。结果显示，铂-氧化铝催化剂在环己烷脱氢化反应中的活性比铂-硅酸铝催化剂高。铂的特定催化活性在环己烷脱氢化反应中不受支撑物的影响。
