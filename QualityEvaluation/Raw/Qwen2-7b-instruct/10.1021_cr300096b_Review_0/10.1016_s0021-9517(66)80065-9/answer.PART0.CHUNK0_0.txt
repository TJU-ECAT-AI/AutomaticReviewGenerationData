[1] "The chemisorption results indicated that the platinum was dispersed to a much higher degree on alumina than on silica-alumina."
[2] "The higher activity of the platinum on alumina for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater platinum dispersion."
[3] "For the platinum-on-alumina catalyst, the adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole."
[4] "In the case of the platinum-on-silica-alumina catalyst, the adsorption of hydrogen on the platinum is about an order of magnitude less than for the platinum-on-alumina catalyst."
[5] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x, where F represents the moles of cyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams."
[6] "However, it is possible that the more active platinum-on-alumina catalyst may have been limited to some degree by pore diffusion, so that the factor of 6 may be smaller than the true ratio of catalytic activities."

1. The study found that platinum dispersion affects catalytic activity, with greater dispersion leading to higher activity. The chemisorption of hydrogen on platinum supported on alumina catalysts was found to be more extensive than on silica-alumina, contributing to higher catalytic efficiency for cyclohexane dehydrogenation.

2. The specific catalytic activity of platinum for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is largely unaffected by the support, implying that the intrinsic catalytic properties of platinum remain consistent across different supports. However, the surface area of the active component, in this case, platinum, does play a significant role in determining catalytic efficiency.

3. The support influenced the degree of dispersion of platinum, which in turn affected the catalytic activity. The platinum-on-alumina catalyst demonstrated higher activity than the platinum-on-silica-alumina catalyst, suggesting that the support can affect catalytic performance.

4. The study suggests that the support's effect on catalytic activity can vary significantly depending on the specific catalyst and reaction being studied. This implies that while the role of the support might be limited to affecting the surface area of the active component, it can still significantly impact catalytic efficiency.

5. The results of the study indicate that the support did not exert any specific effect on the intrinsic catalytic properties of platinum but instead affected the degree of dispersion of the metal. This finding highlights the importance of considering dispersion effects when evaluating the performance of supported catalysts.

6. The catalytic activity of the more active platinum-on-alumina catalyst could potentially be limited by pore diffusion. This limitation might explain why the observed factor of 6 difference in catalytic activity between the two catalysts is smaller than the difference in their surface areas. This insight suggests that factors beyond simple surface area may influence catalytic performance.

1. 研究表明，铂的分散度影响催化活性，分散度越高，活性越大。在铝酸盐载体上支持的铂催化剂的氢化学吸附比在硅酸铝载体上更广泛，这有助于提高环己烷脱氢反应的催化效率。

2. 铂的特定催化活性对环己烷脱氢反应基本不受载体的影响，暗示铂的内在催化性质在不同的载体上保持一致。然而，活性成分，即铂的表面面积确实对催化效率有显著影响。

3. 支持物影响铂的分散度，进而影响催化活性。铂在氧化铝上的催化剂显示出比在硅酸铝上的催化剂更高的活性，这表明载体可以显著影响催化性能。

4. 研究表明，载体对催化活性的作用可能因具体催化剂和反应而异。这表明虽然载体的作用可能仅限于影响活性成分的表面面积，但它仍然能显著影响催化效率。

5. 研究结果表明，载体并未对铂的内在催化特性产生特定影响，而是影响了铂的分散程度。这一发现强调了考虑分散效应时评估支持催化剂性能的重要性。

6. 更活跃的铂在氧化铝上的催化剂的催化活性可能受限于孔扩散。这种限制可能解释了观察到的两催化剂间6倍差异的催化活性小于它们表面面积差异的原因。这一见解表明，除了简单的表面面积外，其他因素也可能影响催化性能。
