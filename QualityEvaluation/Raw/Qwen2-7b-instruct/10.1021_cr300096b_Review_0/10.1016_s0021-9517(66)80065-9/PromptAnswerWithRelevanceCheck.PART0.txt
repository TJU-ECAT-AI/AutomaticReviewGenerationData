[1] "The chemisorption results indicated that the platinum was dispersed to a much higher degree on alumina than on silica-alumina."
[2] "The higher activity of the platinum on alumina for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater platinum dispersion."
[3] "For the platinum-on-alumina catalyst, the adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole."
[4] "In the case of the platinum-on-silica-alumina catalyst, the adsorption of hydrogen on the platinum is about an order of magnitude less than for the platinum-on-alumina catalyst."
[5] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x, where F represents the moles of cyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams."
[6] "However, it is possible that the more active platinum-on-alumina catalyst may have been limited to some degree by pore diffusion, so that the factor of 6 may be smaller than the true ratio of catalytic activities."

1. The study found that platinum dispersion affects catalytic activity, with greater dispersion leading to higher activity. The chemisorption of hydrogen on platinum supported on alumina catalysts was found to be more extensive than on silica-alumina, contributing to higher catalytic efficiency for cyclohexane dehydrogenation.

2. The specific catalytic activity of platinum for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is largely unaffected by the support, implying that the intrinsic catalytic properties of platinum remain consistent across different supports. However, the surface area of the active component, in this case, platinum, does play a significant role in determining catalytic efficiency.

3. The support influenced the degree of dispersion of platinum, which in turn affected the catalytic activity. The platinum-on-alumina catalyst demonstrated higher activity than the platinum-on-silica-alumina catalyst, suggesting that the support can affect catalytic performance.

4. The study suggests that the support's effect on catalytic activity can vary significantly depending on the specific catalyst and reaction being studied. This implies that while the role of the support might be limited to affecting the surface area of the active component, it can still significantly impact catalytic efficiency.

5. The results of the study indicate that the support did not exert any specific effect on the intrinsic catalytic properties of platinum but instead affected the degree of dispersion of the metal. This finding highlights the importance of considering dispersion effects when evaluating the performance of supported catalysts.

6. The catalytic activity of the more active platinum-on-alumina catalyst could potentially be limited by pore diffusion. This limitation might explain why the observed factor of 6 difference in catalytic activity between the two catalysts is smaller than the difference in their surface areas. This insight suggests that factors beyond simple surface area may influence catalytic performance.

1. 研究表明，铂的分散度影响催化活性，分散度越高，活性越大。在铝酸盐载体上支持的铂催化剂的氢化学吸附比在硅酸铝载体上更广泛，这有助于提高环己烷脱氢反应的催化效率。

2. 铂的特定催化活性对环己烷脱氢反应基本不受载体的影响，暗示铂的内在催化性质在不同的载体上保持一致。然而，活性成分，即铂的表面面积确实对催化效率有显著影响。

3. 支持物影响铂的分散度，进而影响催化活性。铂在氧化铝上的催化剂显示出比在硅酸铝上的催化剂更高的活性，这表明载体可以显著影响催化性能。

4. 研究表明，载体对催化活性的作用可能因具体催化剂和反应而异。这表明虽然载体的作用可能仅限于影响活性成分的表面面积，但它仍然能显著影响催化效率。

5. 研究结果表明，载体并未对铂的内在催化特性产生特定影响，而是影响了铂的分散程度。这一发现强调了考虑分散效应时评估支持催化剂性能的重要性。

6. 更活跃的铂在氧化铝上的催化剂的催化活性可能受限于孔扩散。这种限制可能解释了观察到的两催化剂间6倍差异的催化活性小于它们表面面积差异的原因。这一见解表明，除了简单的表面面积外，其他因素也可能影响催化性能。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The catalytic activity of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst was significantly higher than that of the platinum-on-silica-alumina catalyst. This was demonstrated by the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation to benzene, which was about six times faster for the catalyst with platinum on alumina. This indicates that the dispersion of platinum on the support plays a crucial role in its catalytic efficiency.

铂在氧化铝上的催化剂活性显著高于在硅酸盐氧化铝上的催化剂。这通过环己烷脱氢到苯的速度得到了证明，对于铂在氧化铝上的催化剂，该速度大约是铂在硅酸盐氧化铝上的催化剂的六倍。这表明催化剂上铂的分散对其催化效率起着关键作用。

[1] "In the case of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst, the number of hydrogen atoms adsorbed per platinum atom is essentially unity, corresponding to a high degree of dispersion of platinum."
[2] "The adsorption at 200 is higher than at 300, indicating that the adsorption is exothermic."
[3] "At the high coverage of platinum by hydrogen in these experiments (6 > 0.6),the isosteric heat of adsorption is low, about 7-8 kcal/mole at 0 = 0.7."
[4] "Perhaps this is due to the much lower concentration of metal employed in the ease of platinum (2% vs. 10%)."
[5] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x."
[6] "The activity of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst was about six times as high as that of the platinum on silica-alumina."

The study focused on comparing the chemisorption and catalytic properties of platinum supported on two different supports: alumina and silica-alumina. It found that the platinum was dispersed to a much higher degree on alumina, leading to higher catalytic activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. The researchers attributed the higher activity to the greater dispersion of platinum on alumina. They also provided an estimate of the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on platinum-supported catalysts, finding it to be exothermic at moderate surface coverage. This study suggests that the support material significantly affects the dispersion of the metal and, consequently, its catalytic activity.

研究专注于比较铂在两种不同支撑材料上的化学吸附和催化性能：氧化铝和硅酸铝。他们发现铂在氧化铝上的分散度要高得多，导致环己烷脱氢化反应的活性更高。研究人员将这一更高的活性归因于氧化铝上铂的更佳分散。他们还对铂支持催化剂上的氢吸附热进行了估算，在中等表面覆盖率下，发现其为放热反应，大约为7-8 kcal/mol。这项研究表明，支撑材料显著影响金属的分散性和，从而影响其催化活性。

研究发现，铂在氧化铝和硅酸铝支持下的化学吸附氢气影响铂的分散程度。铂在氧化铝上的分散程度远高于在硅酸铝上的分散程度。铂在氧化铝上进行环己烷脱氢化反应时的高活性归因于铂在支撑物上的更高分散度。估算显示，在铂表面覆盖率为70%的适度高表面上吸附氢气是放热的，程度为7-8 kcal/mole。结果显示，铂-氧化铝催化剂在环己烷脱氢化反应中的活性比铂-硅酸铝催化剂高。铂的特定催化活性在环己烷脱氢化反应中不受支撑物的影响。

在氧化铝上支持的铂的氢化物化学吸附被发现比在硅酸盐氧化铝上更有效。铂的分散度在氧化铝中更高，导致表面活性增加，并且提高了环己烷脱氢的催化效率。在铂表面覆盖度适中的情况下，氢吸附估计为放热反应，有助于催化效率的提升。氧化铝上的铂催化剂的活动性大约是硅酸盐氧化铝上的铂的六倍，这表明支撑体对催化性能的影响显著。
