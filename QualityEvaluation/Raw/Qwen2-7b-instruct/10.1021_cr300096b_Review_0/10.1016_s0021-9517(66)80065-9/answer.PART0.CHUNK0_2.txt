[1] "In the case of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst, the number of hydrogen atoms adsorbed per platinum atom is essentially unity, corresponding to a high degree of dispersion of platinum."
[2] "The adsorption at 200 is higher than at 300, indicating that the adsorption is exothermic."
[3] "At the high coverage of platinum by hydrogen in these experiments (6 > 0.6),the isosteric heat of adsorption is low, about 7-8 kcal/mole at 0 = 0.7."
[4] "Perhaps this is due to the much lower concentration of metal employed in the ease of platinum (2% vs. 10%)."
[5] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x."
[6] "The activity of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst was about six times as high as that of the platinum on silica-alumina."

The study focused on comparing the chemisorption and catalytic properties of platinum supported on two different supports: alumina and silica-alumina. It found that the platinum was dispersed to a much higher degree on alumina, leading to higher catalytic activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. The researchers attributed the higher activity to the greater dispersion of platinum on alumina. They also provided an estimate of the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on platinum-supported catalysts, finding it to be exothermic at moderate surface coverage. This study suggests that the support material significantly affects the dispersion of the metal and, consequently, its catalytic activity.

研究专注于比较铂在两种不同支撑材料上的化学吸附和催化性能：氧化铝和硅酸铝。他们发现铂在氧化铝上的分散度要高得多，导致环己烷脱氢化反应的活性更高。研究人员将这一更高的活性归因于氧化铝上铂的更佳分散。他们还对铂支持催化剂上的氢吸附热进行了估算，在中等表面覆盖率下，发现其为放热反应，大约为7-8 kcal/mol。这项研究表明，支撑材料显著影响金属的分散性和，从而影响其催化活性。
