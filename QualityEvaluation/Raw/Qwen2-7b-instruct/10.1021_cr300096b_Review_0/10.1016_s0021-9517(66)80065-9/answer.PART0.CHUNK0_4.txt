[1] "The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the supports with chloroplatinic acid and were reduced in hydrogen prior to both the chemisorption and catalytic activity measurements."
[2] "The adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole."
[3] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x, where F represents the moles of cyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams. The activity of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst was about six times as high as that of the platinum on silica-alumina."

The chemisorption of hydrogen on platinum supported on alumina was found to be more effective than on silica-alumina. The platinum dispersion was higher on alumina, leading to a greater surface area and increased activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. The adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at a moderate surface coverage was estimated to be exothermic, contributing to the catalytic efficiency. The activity of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst was about six times higher than that of the platinum on silica-alumina, demonstrating the significant impact of support on the catalytic performance.

在氧化铝上支持的铂的氢化物化学吸附被发现比在硅酸盐氧化铝上更有效。铂的分散度在氧化铝中更高，导致表面活性增加，并且提高了环己烷脱氢的催化效率。在铂表面覆盖度适中的情况下，氢吸附估计为放热反应，有助于催化效率的提升。氧化铝上的铂催化剂的活动性大约是硅酸盐氧化铝上的铂的六倍，这表明支撑体对催化性能的影响显著。
