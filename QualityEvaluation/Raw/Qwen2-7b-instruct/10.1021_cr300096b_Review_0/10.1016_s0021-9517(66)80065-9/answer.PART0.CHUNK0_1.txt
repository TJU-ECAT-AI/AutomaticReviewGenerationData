[1] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x, where F represents the moles of cyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams."
[2] "The effect of the difference in platinum dispersion on catalytic activity is shown by data on the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation to benzene over the two platinum catalysts. The data are given in Table 1."

The catalytic activity of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst was significantly higher than that of the platinum-on-silica-alumina catalyst. This was demonstrated by the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation to benzene, which was about six times faster for the catalyst with platinum on alumina. This indicates that the dispersion of platinum on the support plays a crucial role in its catalytic efficiency.

铂在氧化铝上的催化剂活性显著高于在硅酸盐氧化铝上的催化剂。这通过环己烷脱氢到苯的速度得到了证明，对于铂在氧化铝上的催化剂，该速度大约是铂在硅酸盐氧化铝上的催化剂的六倍。这表明催化剂上铂的分散对其催化效率起着关键作用。
