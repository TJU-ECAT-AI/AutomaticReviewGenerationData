[1] "We report a novel AuAg alloy catalyst supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate AuAg@MCM prepared by a one-pot synthesis procedure, which is very active for low-temperature CO oxidation."
[2] "The activity was highly dependent on the hydrogen pretreatment conditions."
[3] "Calcination led to complete phase segregation of the AuAg alloy and the catalyst surface is greatly enriched with AgBr after the calcination process."
[4] "However, subsequent reduction treatment removed Br- completely and the AuAg alloy was formed again."
[5] "A DFT calculation shows that CO and O2 coadsorption on neighboring sites on the AuAg alloy was stronger than that on either Au or Ag."
[6] "The strong synergism in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on the AuAg nanoparticle can thus explain the observed synergetic effect in catalysis."

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been significant, particularly in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties have contributed to this advancement. The document discusses the synthesis of a novel AuAg alloy catalyst, AuAg@MCM, which exhibits exceptional activity in low-temperature CO oxidation. The catalyst's activity is highly dependent on hydrogen pretreatment conditions. During the calcination process, the AuAg alloy undergoes phase segregation, enriching the surface with AgBr. Subsequent reduction treatment removes Br- and restores the AuAg alloy structure. The DFT calculation reveals that the AuAg alloy exhibits a stronger synergistic effect in the coadsorption of CO and O2 on neighboring sites compared to either Au or Ag individually. This synergy explains the observed catalytic synergetic effect. The MCM-41 support is crucial in accommodating the AuAg alloy nanoparticles, enhancing CO oxidation activity, and stabilizing the alloy particles through interactions with defects associated with Al in MCM-41.

自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化中的发展已经取得了显著的进步，特别是成功地跨越了“材料差距”和“压力差距”，将模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂联系起来。它们独特的电子和化学性质对这一进步做出了贡献。本文讨论了一种新型AuAg合金催化剂AuAg@MCM的合成，该催化剂在低温CO氧化中表现出极高的活性。催化剂的活性高度依赖于氢前处理条件。在煅烧过程中，AuAg合金经历相分离，表面富集AgBr。随后的还原处理完全去除Br-并恢复了AuAg合金结构。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，AuAg合金在邻近位点上CO和O2的共吸附比单独的Au或Ag更强。这种协同作用解释了观察到的催化协同效应。MCM-41支持对于容纳AuAg合金纳米颗粒至关重要，可以提高CO氧化活性，并通过与MCM-41中的Al相关缺陷相互作用来稳定合金颗粒。
