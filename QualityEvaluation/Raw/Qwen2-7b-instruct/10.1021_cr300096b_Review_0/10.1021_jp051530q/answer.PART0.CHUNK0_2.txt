[1] "Since Haruta's initial report 1 on the exceptionally high activity of supported gold catalysts, extensive research work both in fundamental and in application has been carried out in order to understand the origin of the surprisingly active catalytic behavior of the gold nanoparticle."
[2] "One way to obtain an active gold catalyst on an inert support is to make nanoparticles of gold alloy with a second metal that plays the role of activating oxygen."
[3] "In our bimetallic catalyst system, the pretreatment effect becomes more complex because the gas environment during pretreatment may affect the preferential surface segregation of one of the two metals."
[4] "For the reaction mechanism, we proposed previously that Ag plays a key role in the activation of oxygen."
[5] "Our EPR measurement indicates that by alloying Ag with Au (Figure 9c), the adsorption and activation of oxygen on the catalyst surface became stronger."
