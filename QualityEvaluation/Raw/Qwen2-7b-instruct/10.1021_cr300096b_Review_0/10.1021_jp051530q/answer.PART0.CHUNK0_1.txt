[1] "Since Haruta's initial report 1 on the exceptionally high activity of supported gold catalysts, extensive research work both in fundamental and in application has been carried out in order to understand the origin of the surprisingly active catalytic behavior of the gold nanoparticle."
[2] "It has been established that the catalytic performance of the gold nanoparticle is sensitive to the particle size, the support, and the preparation procedure."
[3] "One way to obtain an active gold catalyst on an inert support is to make nanoparticles of gold alloy with a second metal that plays the role of activating oxygen."
[4] "For the alloy catalyst, the average particle size is rather large, 2030 nm. In this alloy system, the size effect is no longer a critical factor, whereas Ag is believed to play a key role in the activation of oxygen."
[5] "In our bimetallic catalyst system, the pretreatment effect becomes more complex because the gas environment during pretreatment may affect the preferential surface segregation of one of the two metals."
[6] "The special calcination-reduction process is crucial for the formation of AuAg alloy nanoparticles with surface enrichment of Ag. The resulting nearly 1:1 Au/Ag surface ratio gives optimum catalytic activity."
[7] "Reduction at lower temperatures may be not enough to remove Br- completely or not enough to form the AuAg alloy. Alternatively, a temperature of reduction that is too high may lead to further enlargement of the particles or may partially destroy the mesoporous structure."
[8] "Our EPR measurement indicates that by alloying Ag with Au (Figure 9c), the adsorption and activation of oxygen on the catalyst surface became stronger. Further coadsorption of a CO molecule makes the oxygen adsorption even stronger (Figure 9d)."
[9] "The Au and Ag monometallic particles were modeled with a 55-atom cluster in an icosahedral structure as shown in Figure 10. We have calculated the adsorption energies for CO and O2 at various sites on the Au55 and Ag55 monometallic particles."
[10] "For the AuAg alloy cluster, we constructed the ordered Au25Ag30 alloy cluster, which keeps the icosahedral structure for comparison with the monometallic clusters, and the atomic positions of Au and Ag atoms are arranged to have optimal adsorptions for both CO and O2 as discussed."

How have bimetallic catalysts evolved in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, and how do their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications?

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly since their commercial introduction, becoming increasingly important in both fundamental research and practical applications. These catalysts combine two metals to create a synergistic effect, enhancing their catalytic properties. Specifically, the unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

1. **Evolution of Bimetallic Catalysts**: The introduction of bimetallic catalysts has expanded the scope of catalytic chemistry. Initially, the focus was on understanding the origins of the high activity of supported gold catalysts. Research efforts have since concentrated on optimizing the composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts, including controlling particle size, support selection, and preparation methods. The discovery of the synergistic effect between metals, particularly in the context of gold-alloy catalysts, has been pivotal.

2. **Unique Electronic and Chemical Properties**: The electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts, especially when compared to their monometallic counterparts, play a crucial role in their enhanced catalytic performance. The presence of two metals allows for the creation of a "synergistic effect," where the properties of each metal complement or enhance the other, leading to improved catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability.

3. **Bridging the "Materials Gap" and "Pressure Gap"**: Bimetallic catalysts help bridge the "materials gap" by offering a compromise between the ideal conditions required for reactions on model surfaces (high activity, selectivity) and the practical challenges faced in industrial processes (cost, stability, scalability). The ability to tailor the electronic structure and surface chemistry of these catalysts allows for better control over the reaction mechanisms, making them more adaptable to various industrial settings.

4. **Fundamental Research and Practical Applications**: In fundamental research, bimetallic catalysts serve as models for understanding complex chemical transformations at the molecular level. Their use in practical applications spans numerous industries, including petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and environmental technologies, where they are employed in processes requiring efficient conversion or transformation of reactants into desired products.

5. **Optimization and Control**: Advances in synthesis techniques, such as the one-pot synthesis method described in the literature, have enabled the precise control of bimetallic catalyst properties. This includes the optimization of particle size, composition, and structure, which are critical for achieving high catalytic activity under industrially relevant conditions.

6. **Enhanced Adsorption and Activation**: The electronic structure of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in the context of oxygen adsorption and activation, is a key factor in their enhanced catalytic performance. The synergistic effect between metals facilitates easier adsorption and activation of oxygen, which is crucial for reactions involving oxygen, such as CO oxidation.

7. **Complexity in Pretreatment**: The pretreatment process for bimetallic catalysts has become more complex due to the influence of the gas environment on the surface segregation of metals. Careful control of pretreatment conditions, including temperature, atmosphere, and duration, is essential for achieving optimal catalyst performance.

8. **Surface Enrichment and Particle Size**: The formation of alloy nanoparticles through a calcination-reduction process leads to surface enrichment of one of the metals, typically silver in the case of AuAg alloys. This surface enrichment, along with the particle size control, contributes to the high catalytic activity of these catalysts.

9. **Quantum Chemical Calculations**: The use of computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, provides insights into the adsorption energies and synergistic effects between CO and O2 on the surface of AuAg alloy nanoparticles. These calculations confirm the enhanced catalytic activity of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in oxygen-activation reactions.

10. **Support Role**: The choice of support, such as mesoporous aluminosilicate, plays a critical role in accommodating the bimetallic nanoparticles and influencing their activity. The support can stabilize the nanoparticles, facilitate adsorption and diffusion of reactants, and enhance the overall catalytic performance.
