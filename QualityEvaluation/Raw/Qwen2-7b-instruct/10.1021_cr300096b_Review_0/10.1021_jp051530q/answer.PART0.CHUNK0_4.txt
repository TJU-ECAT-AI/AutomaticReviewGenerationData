The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis has significantly advanced since their commercial introduction, primarily by integrating the unique electronic and chemical properties of two metals to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These advancements are crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications. In the case of the AuAg bimetallic catalyst on mesoporous aluminosilicate (AuAg@MCM), the catalyst exhibits exceptional activity for CO oxidation, particularly when subjected to a reduction treatment at 600°C. This treatment enhances the adsorption and activation of oxygen, which is crucial for the CO oxidation reaction. The synergistic effect between Au and Ag in the alloy catalyst leads to a stronger activation of oxygen and improved reactivity in oxygen-atom transfer, resulting in high catalytic activity. The EPR measurements confirm that the adsorption and activation of oxygen on the catalyst surface become stronger when alloying Ag with Au, contributing to the catalyst's enhanced performance.

自Haruta首次报告以来，支持性金催化剂表现出异常高的活性以来，对金纳米粒子惊人催化行为起源的研究工作在基础研究和应用领域都进行了广泛开展。这些双金属催化剂的发展通过结合两种金属的独特电子和化学性质，成功地跨越了“材料差距”和“压力差距”，连接了模型表面与工业上相关负载催化剂之间的鸿沟。这对于基础研究和实际应用都是至关重要的。对于AuAg合金催化剂（AuAg@MCM）而言，在600°C下进行还原处理后，该催化剂显示出出色的CO氧化活性。这种处理增强了氧气的吸附和激活，这对CO氧化反应至关重要。Au和Ag在合金催化剂中的协同效应导致了氧气激活的增强以及氧原子转移的高反应性，从而提高了催化剂的活性。EPR测量证实，通过将Ag与Au合金化，催化剂表面的吸附和氧气激活变得更强，进一步增强了催化剂的性能。
