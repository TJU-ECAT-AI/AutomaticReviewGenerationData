1. Since Haruta's initial report on the exceptional activity of supported gold catalysts, extensive research has been conducted to understand the origins of their active catalytic behavior, particularly focusing on the role of gold nanoparticles.

2. For inert supports, the particle size of gold must be precisely controlled around 23 nm to ensure both oxygen and carbon monoxide are adsorbed and activated on the gold surface.

3. In the AuAg alloy system, the size effect is less critical due to the large average particle size (20-30 nm). The activation of oxygen is believed to be primarily attributed to the presence of Ag.

4. The surface enrichment of silver is sensitive to the pretreatment process, which can influence the properties and activity of gold catalysts.

5. Silver, being more reactive than gold, readily forms stable compounds with other electronegative elements like bromine, facilitating reactions in catalysts.

6. Alloying silver with gold enhances the adsorption and activation of oxygen on the catalyst surface, potentially increasing its catalytic efficiency.

7. Mesoporous materials like MCM-41 can stabilize AuAg alloy particles through interactions with defects associated with aluminum in MCM-41, possibly enhancing the catalytic performance.

1. 自Haruta最初报告了支持金催化剂的异常高活性以来，进行了大量基础研究和应用研究，以理解金纳米颗粒令人惊讶的催化行为的起源。

2. 对于惰性支撑体，需要精确控制金颗粒大小在约23 nm范围内，以便同时吸附氧气和碳一氧化物并激活它们在金表面。

3. 在AuAg合金系统中，尺寸效应不再是关键因素，因为平均颗粒大小（约为20-30 nm）。银被认为在激活氧气中起关键作用。

4. 银的表面富集对预处理过程敏感，这可能影响许多关于金催化剂的研究结果。

5. 银比金更活泼，容易与其它电负性元素如溴反应形成稳定的化合物，在催化剂中促进反应。

6. 将银与金合金化可以增强氧在催化剂表面的吸附和激活，可能提高其催化效率。

7. 比如MCM-41这样的介孔材料可以通过与MCM-41中的铝相关缺陷与AuAg合金颗粒的相互作用来稳定AuAg合金颗粒，可能增强催化性能。
