[1] "The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has been significant since their commercial introduction. These catalysts bridge the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts."
[2] "Bimetallic catalysts possess unique electronic and chemical properties that contribute to their effectiveness in heterogeneous catalysis."
[3] "These properties allow for the creation of highly active and selective catalysts that can operate under harsh conditions."

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has significantly bridged the 'materials gap' and 'pressure gap' between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. They possess unique electronic and chemical properties that enhance their effectiveness in heterogeneous catalysis. These properties enable the development of highly active and selective catalysts capable of operating under challenging conditions.
