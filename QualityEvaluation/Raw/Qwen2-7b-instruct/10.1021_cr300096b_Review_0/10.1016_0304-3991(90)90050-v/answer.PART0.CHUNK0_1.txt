[1] "The chemical behavior of monolayer coverages of one metal on the surface of another, e.g., Ni/W, Fe/W, Pd/W, Cu/Re, Ni/Mo, etc., has recently been shown to be dramatically different from that seen for either of the metallic components separately."
[2] "These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system."
[3] "Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, particularly due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. The chemical behavior of monolayer coverages on different metals often exhibits dramatic differences compared to their individual components, affecting chemisorption and catalytic properties. Such alterations have been linked to changes in the structural and electronic properties of bimetallic systems, influencing their special properties, especially in catalytic applications.
