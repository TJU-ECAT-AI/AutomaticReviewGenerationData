[1] "The chemical behavior of monolayer coverages of one metal on the surface of another, e.g., Ni/W, Fe/W, Pd/W, Cu/Re, Ni/Mo, etc., has recently been shown to be dramatically different from that seen for either of the metallic components separately."
[2] "These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system."
[3] "Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts."

Bimetallic catalysts have significantly evolved in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, showcasing unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These properties are attributed to the dramatic differences in chemical behavior when one metal covers the surface of another, compared to the individual metallic components. This phenomenon is often associated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system. Studies on these systems highlight their relevance to the special properties observed in specific bimetallic catalysts.

自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化中显著发展，展示了能够弥合模型表面和工业相关支撑催化剂之间“材料差距”和“压力差距”的独特电子和化学性质。这些属性归因于一种金属覆盖另一种表面时表现出的化学行为与单独金属组件的显著差异。这一现象往往与双金属系统结构和电子性质的变化相关联。对这些系统的研究强调了特定双金属催化剂所观察到的特殊性质的相关性。
