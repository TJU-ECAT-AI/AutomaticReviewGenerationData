Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, particularly due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. The chemical behavior of monolayer coverages on different metals often exhibits dramatic differences compared to their individual components, affecting chemisorption and catalytic properties. Such alterations have been linked to changes in the structural and electronic properties of bimetallic systems, influencing their special properties, especially in catalytic applications.

Bimetallic catalysts have significantly evolved in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, showcasing unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These properties are attributed to the dramatic differences in chemical behavior when one metal covers the surface of another, compared to the individual metallic components. This phenomenon is often associated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system. Studies on these systems highlight their relevance to the special properties observed in specific bimetallic catalysts.
