[1] "These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system."
[2] "Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts."

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By modifying the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, bimetallic systems have shown to have distinct structural and electronic characteristics that contribute to their enhanced performance in both fundamental research and practical applications.
