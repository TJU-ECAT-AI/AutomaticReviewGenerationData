[1] "These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system."
[2] "Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, incorporating unique electronic and chemical properties that bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These properties allow for enhanced activity and selectivity compared to their single-metal counterparts. Representative studies highlight the correlation between structural, electronic changes in bimetallic systems and the modified chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, contributing to the development of more efficient and targeted catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications.
