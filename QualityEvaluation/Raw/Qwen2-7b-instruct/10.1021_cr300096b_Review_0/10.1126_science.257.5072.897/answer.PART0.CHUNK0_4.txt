Answer: The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis has significantly advanced since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. The formation of surface metal-metal bonds leads to large perturbations in electronic, chemical, and catalytic properties of metals, often resulting in enhanced catalytic activities. Charge transfer is a critical component in these bonds, especially when involving dissimilar elements. The direction and magnitude of this charge transfer significantly influence the strength of the bimetallic bond and the properties of the catalyst. The cohesive energy of bimetallic bonds increases with the size of the charge transfer, affecting their stability and reactivity. The surface metal-metal bond is characterized by a flow of electron density towards the element with the larger fraction of empty states in its valence band, which is fundamentally different from bulk alloys. This unique behavior underscores the importance of structural geometry in determining the nature of metal-metal bonds in bimetallic surfaces. The results obtained from using well-defined bimetallic surfaces have transformed our understanding of these bonds, leading to significant advancements in the field. Bimetallic systems involving noble metals and transition metals exhibit weaker bonds compared to those with both transition metals, influencing their catalytic performance. The strength of bonds between metal overlayers and substrates can be quantified using thermal desorption mass spectroscopy (TDS), providing insights into the stability and reactivity of these catalysts.
