[1] "The larger the charge transfer, the stronger the cohesive energy of the bimetallic bond."
[2] "Formation of a surface metal-metal bond produces a flow of electron density toward the element with the larger fraction of empty states in its valence band."
[3] "In part, this interest has been motivated by the extensive technological applications that mixed-metal systems have in areas of metallurgy, catalysis, electrochemistry, and microelectronics fabrication."
[4] "This behavior, which is completely contrary to that seen in bulk alloys, is likely a result of the anisotropic character of a surface that changes the relative electronegativities of the metal atoms."
[5] "The strength of the bonds between the metal overlaver and metal substrate can be probed directly by using thermal desorption mass spectroscopy (TDS)."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. They have unique electronic and chemical properties that contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. The electronic perturbations caused by bimetallic bonds lead to a flow of electron density towards the metal with the larger fraction of empty states in its valence band. This behavior is fundamentally different from that observed in bulk alloys and highlights the strong dependence of the nature of a heteronuclear metal-metal bond on the structural geometry of the system. The cohesive energy of bimetallic bonds increases with the size of the charge transfer, influencing both their stability and reactivity. The ability to probe the strength of these bonds through thermal desorption mass spectroscopy (TDS) provides insights into their stability and reactivity under various conditions, making them valuable in fields such as metallurgy, catalysis, electrochemistry, and microelectronics fabrication.

自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化领域取得了显著进展。它们独特的电子和化学性质有助于弥合模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。由双金属键引起的电子扰动导致电子密度流向具有更大空能态比例的价带元素。这种行为与合金中观察到的行为完全相反，强调了系统结构几何对异种金属间金属键性质的强烈依赖性。电荷转移量越大，双金属键的结合能越强，影响着它们的稳定性和活性。通过热解吸质谱（TDS）测量这些键的强度的能力为了解它们在各种条件下的稳定性提供了见解，使它们在冶金、催化、电化学和微电子制造等领域具有重要价值。
