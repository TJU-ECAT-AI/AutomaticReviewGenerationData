[1] "Formation of a surface metal-metal bond can produce large perturbations in the electronic, chemical, and catalytic properties of a metal."
[2] "Recent studies indicate that charge transfer is an important component in surface metal-metal bonds that involve dissimilar elements."
[3] "On a surface, the formation of a heteronuclear metal-metal bond induces a flow of electron density toward the element with the larger fraction of empty states in its valence band."
[4] "Isolated metal atoms are unstable, very reactive, and show a tendency to fully use all of their valence orbitals by making chemical bonds with other species."
[5] "Thus, when two isolated metal centers are put in contact, they usually form a dinu- clear compound in which the atoms can be united by a multiple metal-metal bond."
[6] "The two basic questions in these studies are: (i) What is the nature of the heteronuclear metal-metal bond? and (ii) How does the formation of this bond affect the physical and chemical properties of metals?"
[7] "In general, metals are elements characterized by the presence of a large number of valence orbitals that can donate or accept electrons."
[8] "The larger the charge transfer, the stronger the cohesive energy of the bimetallic bond."
[9] "Formation of surface metal-metal bonds leads to a gain in electrons by the element initially having the larger fraction of empty states in its valence band."
[10] "The properties of a bond in a bimetallic surface can be very different from those of the corresponding bond in a 3-D alloy, stressing the need to investigate the nature of the surface metal-metal bond."

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has been significant, particularly in addressing the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties enable them to significantly alter the chemical properties of metals and improve catalytic efficiency. Specifically, the formation of a surface metal-metal bond facilitates the transfer of electron density from one metal to another, with the electron density flowing towards the metal with a larger fraction of empty states in its valence band. This behavior contrasts with bulk alloys, where the nature of the metal-metal bond is more influenced by the structural geometry of the system. By studying the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic systems, researchers can better understand and optimize their performance in various applications, effectively bridging the aforementioned gaps.

自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化中的演变取得了显著进展，特别是在解决“材料差距”和“压力差距”，即模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间的差距。它们独特的电子和化学性质能够显著改变金属的化学性质并提高催化效率。具体而言，表面金属-金属键的形成促进了电子密度从一种金属流向另一种金属，电子密度向具有更多空价带状态的金属流动。这种行为与合金中的金属-金属键不同，在合金中，系统结构几何对金属键的性质影响更大。通过研究这些双金属系统的电子和化学性质，研究人员可以更好地理解和优化其在各种应用中的性能，有效地弥合上述差距。
