[1] "Recent studies indicate that charge transfer is an important component in surface metal-metal bonds that involve dissimilar elements."
[2] "The larger the charge transfer, the stronger the cohesive energy of the bimetallic bond."
[3] "Formation of a surface metal-metal bond can produce large perturbations in the electronic, chemical, and catalytic properties of a metal."
[4] "In recent years, a large effort has been focused on understanding the chemical and physical properties of molecules and solids that have heteronuclear metal-metal bonds."
[5] "The two basic questions in these studies are: (i) What is the nature of the heteronuclear metal-metal bond? and (ii) How does the formation of this bond affect the physical and chemical properties of metals?"
[6] "A large amount of experimental evidence (3-5) accumulated during the last 50 years for monometallic compounds indicates that in general the properties of a metal center depend on three factors: (i) the metal itself, (ii) the type of species bonded to the metal, and (iii) the geometrical structure of the system."

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis has significantly advanced since their commercial introduction, primarily due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties allow for the bridging of the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. The formation of surface metal-metal bonds introduces significant electronic perturbations, which can dramatically alter the chemical properties of both metal components. The nature of these bonds is highly dependent on the structural geometry of the system, leading to enhanced catalytic activities and selectivities. Understanding the charge transfer dynamics and the resulting changes in electronic structure is crucial for the design of bimetallic systems with optimized industrial applications.
