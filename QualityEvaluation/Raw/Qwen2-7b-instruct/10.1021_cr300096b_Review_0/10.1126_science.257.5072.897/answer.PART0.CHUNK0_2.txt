The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts have significantly evolved in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. These properties allow for the bridging of the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. The formation of a surface metal-metal bond results in a flow of electron density towards the element with the larger fraction of empty states in its valence band. This behavior contrasts with that observed in bulk alloys and is heavily influenced by the structural geometry of the system. The nature of a heteronuclear metal-metal bond is determined by this geometry. Furthermore, photoelectron spectroscopy studies reveal that the electronic properties of surface atoms differ from those of bulk atoms, necessitating the exchange of electrons between surface and bulk components to maintain a common Fermi level. The importance of charge transfer in surface metal-metal bonds contributes to the unique catalytic activities of bimetallic catalysts.

自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在异质催化中的独特电子和化学性质已经显著发展。这些性质允许在模型表面和工业相关支持催化剂之间桥接“材料差距”和“压力差距”。表面金属-金属键的形成导致电子密度向具有更大空态分数的价带元素流动。这种行为与合金中观察到的行为相反，并且受到系统几何结构的强烈影响。异核金属-金属键的性质由这种几何结构决定。此外，光电子谱研究揭示了表面原子的电子性质与块体原子不同，需要在表面和块体组件之间交换电子以维持共同费米能级。电荷转移在表面金属-金属键中的重要性促进了双金属催化剂的独特催化活性。
