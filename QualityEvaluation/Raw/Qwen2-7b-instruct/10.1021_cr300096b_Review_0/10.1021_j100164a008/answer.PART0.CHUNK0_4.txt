Answer: The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties allow them to bridge the "materials gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, enhancing their performance in both fundamental research and practical applications. For instance, the ability of bimetallic catalysts to exhibit different reactivities and stabilities compared to their pure metal counterparts enables them to overcome limitations associated with single-metal catalysts. This is particularly evident in their ability to modulate reaction pathways and selectivities through the tuning of electronic structures and surface compositions. Furthermore, the incorporation of bimetallic sites within supported catalysts can lead to enhanced stability and activity, which is crucial for industrial processes where catalyst longevity and efficiency are paramount. The citation of numerous publications in "The Journal of Physical Chemistry" highlights the ongoing research and development in this field, demonstrating the continuous efforts to understand and optimize the use of bimetallic catalysts across various applications, from energy conversion to chemical synthesis.

Answer: 自商用化以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化领域经历了显著的发展，主要体现在对它们独特电子和化学性质的理解上。这些性质使它们能够跨越模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间的“材料差距”，并在基础研究和实际应用中提高其性能。例如，双金属催化剂表现出与纯金属催化剂不同的反应性和稳定性，这允许它们克服单金属催化剂的局限性。特别是在通过调节电子结构和表面组成来调整个体路径和选择性的能力方面尤为明显。此外，将双金属位点整合到支持催化剂中可以导致增强的稳定性和活性，这对于需要催化剂寿命和效率的工业过程至关重要。《物理化学杂志》所引用的众多出版物表明了这一领域的持续研究和发展，展示了在各种应用（从能源转换到化学合成）中优化使用双金属催化剂的努力。
