1. Bimetallic catalysts gained significant commercial interest in the 1960s due to their exceptional activities in hydrocarbon reforming compared to monometallic catalysts. They are renowned for exhibiting novel properties not found in their individual components, offering enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability. These catalysts have been widely applied in various catalytic and electrocatalytic processes.

2. The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts are attributed to two main factors: the formation of heteroatom bonds altering the electronic environment of the metal surface through the ligand effect, and the geometric differences in the bimetallic structure, such as changes in average metal-metal bond lengths leading to the strain effect, which modifies the electronic structure of the metal.

3. To bridge the "materials gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, the document focuses on demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing model surfaces' insights in practical applications. It does this by bridging the materials and pressure gaps between ultra-high vacuum environments and real-world catalytic conditions.

4. The document introduces the preparation methods and characterization techniques for Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and supported catalysts, utilizing the Ni/Pt system as a prime example. This system is extensively studied through both theoretical calculations and experimental validations to ensure the stability of bimetallic structures under diverse reaction conditions.

5. The document provides a comprehensive overview of the unique properties and general trends of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts across different reaction types, including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, reforming, and oxidation, thereby facilitating the advancement of bimetallic catalysis.
