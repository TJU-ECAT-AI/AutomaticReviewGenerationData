[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."
[2] "The findings of these unexpected properties of bimetallic catalysts have inspired many extensive investigations on their possible applications."
[3] "Bimetallic surfaces often show novel properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces."
[4] "The modification effect is especially important when the admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime."
[5] "One of the new findings is that, depending on experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of the three structures: occupying the topmost surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with the surface to produce intermixed bimetallic surfaces."
[6] "In the current review we will focus on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."
[7] "The reasons for choosing Pt-based bimetallic systems are primarily 2-fold: (i) they are the most well-studied bimetallic surfaces using both DFT calculations and surface science experiments, and (ii) they are among the most commonly used bimetallic catalysts in both catalytic and electrocatalytic applications."

How have bimetallic catalysts evolved in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, and how do their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications?

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly since their commercial introduction in the 1960s, particularly in hydrocarbon reforming, where they demonstrated unprecedented activities compared to monometallic catalysts. Their unique electronic and chemical properties have enabled researchers to bridge the "materials gap" between theoretical model surfaces and industrially applicable supported catalysts. By understanding how admetals interact with host metals in submonolayer to monolayer regimes, scientists have been able to predict and manipulate the electronic structure of bimetallic surfaces, leading to the discovery of novel properties not found in the individual metals. These properties are crucial for improving catalyst efficiency, selectivity, and stability across various reactions. The ability to predict stable bimetallic structures under different reaction conditions, using both computational models and experimental data, has significantly advanced the field, facilitating the transition from model surfaces to practical, industrially relevant catalysts. Pt-based systems, due to their extensive study and widespread use, serve as a cornerstone in this research, offering insights into the preparation methods, characterization techniques, and unique properties of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts for diverse reactions.
