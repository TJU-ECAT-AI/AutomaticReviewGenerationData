Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s, particularly for hydrocarbon reforming. These catalysts, characterized by unique electronic and chemical properties, have enabled the development of catalysts with improved selectivity, activity, and stability compared to monometallic catalysts. In industrial settings, bimetallic catalysts often consist of active metal nanoparticles supported on high-surface-area substrates. The aim of this review is to establish connections between model bimetallic surfaces and industrially applicable supported catalysts, focusing on bridging the "materials gap" between model surfaces and real-world catalysts and the "pressure gap" between ultra-high vacuum environments and actual reaction conditions. Demonstrative examples, such as hydrogenation reactions, are used to illustrate the practical application of this bridging, showcasing the feasibility of translating fundamental surface science insights into effective industrial catalysts.

1. Bimetallic catalysts gained significant commercial interest in the 1960s due to their exceptional activities in hydrocarbon reforming compared to monometallic catalysts. They are renowned for exhibiting novel properties not found in their individual components, offering enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability. These catalysts have been widely applied in various catalytic and electrocatalytic processes.

2. The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts are attributed to two main factors: the formation of heteroatom bonds altering the electronic environment of the metal surface through the ligand effect, and the geometric differences in the bimetallic structure, such as changes in average metal-metal bond lengths leading to the strain effect, which modifies the electronic structure of the metal.

[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."
[2] "The findings of these unexpected properties of bimetallic catalysts have inspired many extensive investigations on their possible applications."
[3] "Bimetallic surfaces often show novel properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces."
[4] "The modification effect is especially important when the admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime."
[5] "One of the new findings is that, depending on experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of the three structures: occupying the topmost surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with the surface to produce intermixed bimetallic surfaces."
[6] "In the current review we will focus on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."
[7] "The reasons for choosing Pt-based bimetallic systems are primarily 2-fold: (i) they are the most well-studied bimetallic surfaces using both DFT calculations and surface science experiments, and (ii) they are among the most commonly used bimetallic catalysts in both catalytic and electrocatalytic applications."
