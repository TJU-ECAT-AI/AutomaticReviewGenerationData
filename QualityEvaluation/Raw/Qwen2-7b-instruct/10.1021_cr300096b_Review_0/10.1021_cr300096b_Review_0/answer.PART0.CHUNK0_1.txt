Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s, particularly due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. These properties enable enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability, offering new catalysts that surpass the performance of monometallic catalysts. By studying model bimetallic surfaces and bridging the gap to industrially relevant supported catalysts, researchers aim to correlate theoretical predictions with practical applications. In the context of this review, the focus on Pt-based systems highlights their widespread use and the importance of understanding their behavior under different reaction conditions. The unique properties and general trends observed in bimetallic surfaces and catalysts for various reactions, such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, reforming, and oxidation, are summarized to provide insights into the advancement of bimetallic catalysis.
