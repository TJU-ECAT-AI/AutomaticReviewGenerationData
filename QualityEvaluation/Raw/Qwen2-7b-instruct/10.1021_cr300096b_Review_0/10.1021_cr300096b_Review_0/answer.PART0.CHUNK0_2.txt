Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s. Their unique electronic and chemical properties enable them to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By understanding the modification effects on bimetallic surfaces, researchers can correlate these properties to the more complex environments found in supported catalysts. The review aims to highlight the similarities and differences between model surfaces and supported catalysts, particularly focusing on Pt-based systems, to facilitate the application of fundamental surface science studies to industrial catalysis. This approach allows for the prediction of stable bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties, enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of catalytic reactions.

自20世纪60年代商业应用以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化领域的演变显著。它们独特的电子和化学性质使得它们能够在模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间架起“材料差距”和“压力差距”。通过理解双金属表面的修改效应，研究者能够将这些性质与更复杂的环境联系起来，即支持催化剂。当前的综述旨在通过几种类型的催化反应，建立模型表面和支持催化剂之间的相关性。特别关注以Pt为基础的系统，以促进基础表面科学研究在工业催化中的应用。这种方法允许预测具有理想化学性质的稳定双金属结构，从而提高催化反应的效率和选择性。
