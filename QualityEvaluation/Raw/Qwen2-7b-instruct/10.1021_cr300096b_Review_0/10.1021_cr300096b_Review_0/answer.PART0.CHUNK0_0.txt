Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s, particularly for hydrocarbon reforming. These catalysts, characterized by unique electronic and chemical properties, have enabled the development of catalysts with improved selectivity, activity, and stability compared to monometallic catalysts. In industrial settings, bimetallic catalysts often consist of active metal nanoparticles supported on high-surface-area substrates. The aim of this review is to establish connections between model bimetallic surfaces and industrially applicable supported catalysts, focusing on bridging the "materials gap" between model surfaces and real-world catalysts and the "pressure gap" between ultra-high vacuum environments and actual reaction conditions. Demonstrative examples, such as hydrogenation reactions, are used to illustrate the practical application of this bridging, showcasing the feasibility of translating fundamental surface science insights into effective industrial catalysts.

自1960年代商业应用以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化领域的演变取得了显著进展，尤其是在烃类重整中。这些催化剂以其独特的电子和化学性质，使得开发出具有更高选择性、活性和稳定性的催化剂成为可能，相较于单一金属催化剂。工业应用中，双金属催化剂通常由纳米颗粒的活性金属负载在高比表面积的支撑材料上。本次综述的目标是建立模型双金属表面与工业适用支持催化剂之间的联系，重点关注将“材料间隙”（模型表面与实际催化剂之间的差异）和“压力间隙”（超高真空环境与反应条件之间的差异）桥接起来的可能性。通过氢化反应等示例的应用，展示了如何实现从基础表面科学研究到有效工业催化剂的转化的可行性。
