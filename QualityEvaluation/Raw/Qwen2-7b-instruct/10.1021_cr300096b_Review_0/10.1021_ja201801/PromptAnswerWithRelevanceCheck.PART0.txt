Answer: The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has significantly advanced our understanding and capabilities in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These advancements are crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications.

The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts play a pivotal role in these improvements. Specifically, the synergistic interaction between the two metals creates an optimized environment that enhances catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. This synergy often leads to enhanced performance over single metal catalysts, particularly in terms of resistance to deactivation and improved efficiency under industrial conditions.

Bimetallic catalysts have been instrumental in addressing the materials gap by offering a more realistic representation of industrial catalysts, which often consist of multiple metals. They also help bridge the pressure gap by enabling reactions under milder conditions than those required by single metal catalysts, thus reducing energy consumption and improving economic viability.

In summary, the development of bimetallic catalysts has been characterized by significant strides in enhancing catalytic performance, expanding the scope of reactive processes, and increasing the efficiency of chemical synthesis, all while narrowing the gap between laboratory-scale models and industrial applications.

答案：自商用以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化中的演变显著推进了我们对模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间“材料差距”和“压力差距”的理解与能力。这些进步对于基础研究和实际应用都至关重要。

双金属催化剂的独特电子和化学性质在其改进中起着关键作用。特别是，两种金属之间的协同作用创造了一个优化的环境，提高了催化剂活性、选择性和稳定性。这种协同作用通常导致与单一金属催化剂相比，性能得到增强，特别是在抵抗失活和在工业条件下提高效率方面。

双金属催化剂在解决材料差距方面发挥了重要作用，提供了更现实的工业催化剂模型，后者往往由多种金属组成。它们也有助于缩小压力差距，通过在比单一金属催化剂所需条件更温和的条件下进行反应，从而降低能耗并提高经济性。

总之，双金属催化剂的发展特征是显著增强了催化性能，扩展了可反应过程的范围，并提高了化学合成的效率，同时缩小了实验室规模模型与工业应用之间的差距。
