[1] "These limitations could be eliminated if stable cathode catalysts, with an order of magnitude increase in the specific activity over that of state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts, can be developed (10)."
[2] "We demonstrated that the Pt3Ni(111) surface is 10-fold more active for the ORR than the corresponding Pt(111) surface and 90-fold more active than the current state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts for PEMFC."
[3] "Considering that the Pt3Ni(111)-skin surface exhibits the highest catalytic activity that has ever been detected, the challenge would be to create a nanocatalyst with electronic and morphological properties that mimic the Pt3Ni(111) surface."

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those incorporating Pt and Ni, have evolved significantly since their commercial introduction. They bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts by offering enhanced electronic and chemical properties. These advancements are crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications in heterogeneous catalysis. The Pt3Ni(111) surface, in particular, stands out for its remarkable catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), surpassing even the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts by orders of magnitude. The development of nanocatalysts that emulate the electronic and morphological characteristics of the Pt3Ni(111) surface represents a significant challenge aiming to optimize PEMFC performance without compromising cell voltage or maximum power density.

自商业引入以来，特别是含有Pt和Ni的双金属催化剂已经取得了显著的进步。它们在模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间架起了一座“材料差距”和“压力差距”的桥梁，通过提供增强的电子和化学性质。这些进展对于异相催化领域的基础研究和实际应用至关重要。Pt3Ni(111)表面在氧气还原反应（ORR）中的催化活性尤其突出，甚至超越了最先进的Pt/C催化剂的数量级。开发模仿Pt3Ni(111)表面的电子和形态特性的纳米催化剂代表了一个重大的挑战，旨在优化质子交换膜燃料电池（PEMFC）性能，同时不牺牲电池电压或最大功率密度。
