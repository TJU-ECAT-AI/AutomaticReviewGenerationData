[1] "In the hope that a combination of different metals would have improved catalytic activity and stability relative to those of a pure metal, the ORR has been studied on numerous bi- or multimetallic alloys (6, 8, 1117)."
[2] "We demonstrated that the Pt3Ni(111) surface is 10-fold more active for the ORR than the corresponding Pt(111) surface and 90-fold more active than the current state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts for PEMFC."
[3] "Considering that the Pt3Ni(111)-skin surface exhibits the highest catalytic activity that has ever been detected, the challenge would be to create a nanocatalyst with electronic and morphological properties that mimic the Pt3Ni(111) surface."

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis has significantly progressed since their commercial introduction, particularly in addressing the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. The unique electronic and chemical properties of these catalysts play a pivotal role in enhancing their performance. Specifically, the study highlights the remarkable catalytic activity of the Pt3Ni(111) surface, which is 10 times more active than the Pt(111) surface and 90 times more active than the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts used in PEMFCs. This suggests that the design of nanocatalysts with properties akin to the Pt3Ni(111) surface could bridge the aforementioned gaps, offering significant improvements in both fundamental research and practical applications.

自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化中的发展取得了显著进步，特别是在弥合模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”。这些催化剂的独特电子和化学性质对提高其性能至关重要。具体而言，研究强调了Pt3Ni(111)表面的催化活性，其活性比Pt(111)表面高10倍，比当前最先进的Pt/C催化剂在PEMFC中的活性高90倍。这表明设计具有类似Pt3Ni(111)表面特性的纳米催化剂可以弥合上述差距，为基础研究和实际应用提供重大改进。
