Rather than use a trial-and-error or combinatorial approach, we have examined selected cathode materials with well-characterized surfaces so that the mechanism of action can be attributed to a specific property (at the atomic and molecular level) of the surface under study. In this way, we can determine (i) whether the kinetics of the ORR are structure-sensitive, (ii) the composition of the topmost surface atomic layers (the segregation profile), and (iii) how alloying [usually described in terms of the ligand effect or/and ensemble effect (1820)] alters the chemical properties of the surfaces. 

Similar approaches are commonly used in gas-phase catalysis (21) under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and near-ambient conditions, but alloy surface chemistry on single-crystal surfaces at electrochemical interfaces is relatively unexplored. These aqueous interfaces are more complex in that they necessarily contain solvent and electronic/ionic charge, and (experimentally) it is very challenging but still tractable to use in situ surface-sensitive methods to characterize potential-induced changes in the surface properties and reactivity.

We have used a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the ORR on Pt3Ni(hkl) single-crystal surfaces, identify which surface properties govern the variations in reactivity of PtNi catalysts, and determine how surface structures, surface segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect the ORR kinetics.

Well-characterized PtNi single-crystal electrode surfaces were formed and characterized with UHV methods for surface preparation and surface analysis. These surfaces were transferred into the electrochemical environment without airborne contamination, and the stability of the UHV-prepared surface was determined with a combination of in situ surface-sensitive probes with electrochemical methods so that activity relationships could be obtained in real time.

The results of the preparation and characterization of Pt3Ni(hkl) alloy surfaces in UHV are summarized in Fig. 1. The surface-sensitive techniques that were used included low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), and synchrotron-based high-resolution ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) (see methods in the supporting online material).

The composition of the outermost atomic layer was obtained with LEIS, as previously shown for Pt3Ni polycrystalline alloys (15, 23); after a final anneal, the surface atomic layer of all three Pt3Ni(hkl) crystals is pure Pt (Fig. 1B) [i.e., all form the so-called Pt-skin structures (17, 20)].

The surface electronic structures were obtained from the background-corrected UPS spectra (26). As summarized in Fig. 1C, the d-band density of states (DOS) is structure-sensitive, and the position of the d-band center shifts from 2.70 eV on Pt3Ni(110) to 3.10 eV on Pt3Ni(111) to 3.14 eV on Pt3Ni(100).

We next determined the stability of a surface after transfer from UHV into the electrochemical environment. Surface x-ray scattering (SXS) was used to characterize both the potential range of stability as well as the near-surface composition of the alloy in situ.

The relations between the surface electronic properties and the potential-dependent surface coverage by adsorbing species (the adsorption isotherms in Fig. 2C) were established by comparing the experimentally determined position of the d-band centers to the fractional coverages of adsorbed hydrogen (H+ +e = Hupd, where Hupd refers to the underpotentially deposited hydrogen) between 0.05 < E <0.4 V, where E is the applied potential, and hydroxyl species (2H2O = OHad +H3O+ +e, where OHad is the adsorbed hydroxyl layer) above 0.6 V.

To describe these effects quantitatively, we performed DFT calculations, using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set, on the adsorption of OH and H2O at 0.25 monolayer coverage on modeled Pt(111) surfaces, with second atomic layers containing 0 or 50% Ni atoms.

Based on these assumptions, the kinetics of O2 reduction are determined by the number of free Pt sites available for the adsorption of O2 (the 1  Θad term in Eq. 2) and by the ΔGad of O2 and reaction intermediates (theΔGad term in Eq. 2) on metal surfaces precovered by OHad.

For the same p(1 × 1) arrangement of the topmost layer, the same surface atomic density, and the same surface composition (100% Pt) but for a different electronic structure (Δd[111] = 0.34 eV, where Δd[hkl] is the d-band center shift), the ORR is being enhanced by factor of 10 on Pt(111)-skin relative to that on Pt(111).

Considering that the Pt3Ni(111)-skin surface exhibits the highest catalytic activity that has ever been detected, the challenge would be to create a nanocatalyst with electronic and morphological properties that mimic the Pt3Ni(111) surface. Therefore in the future, a way to reduce the current value (1.0 g of Pt per kW) of Pt-specific power density in a PEMFC without a loss in cell voltage, while also maintaining the maximum power density (W/cm2), would be the engineering of Pt3Ni(111)-skinlike nanocatalysts.

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis has significantly progressed since their commercial introduction. These catalysts have bridged the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts through the exploitation of their unique electronic and chemical properties. The development of bimetallic catalysts has enabled researchers to achieve enhanced catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. These advancements are crucial for both fundamental research and practical applications, particularly in industries requiring efficient and sustainable chemical transformations.

The unique electronic properties of bimetallic catalysts arise from the interaction between the metals in the alloy, leading to the formation of distinct surface electronic structures. These structures influence the adsorption of reactants, intermediates, and products, thereby affecting the catalytic activity and selectivity. The electronic structure sensitivity allows for the optimization of the catalyst's performance, enhancing its ability to efficiently convert reactants into desired products.

Chemically, bimetallic catalysts often exhibit a ligand effect or ensemble effect, which alters the chemical properties of the surfaces. This effect is attributed to the coordination of ligands or the collective behavior of the metal atoms within the alloy, leading to changes in reactivity and stability. These chemical properties contribute to the catalyst's ability to withstand harsh operating conditions and maintain high performance over extended periods.

In heterogeneous catalysis, the morphological properties of bimetallic catalysts play a significant role in determining their catalytic activity. The surface morphology, including the atomic layer arrangement and the presence of specific surface sites, influences the accessibility of reactants and products, as well as the diffusion of molecules across the catalyst surface. The combination of optimized electronic and morphological properties allows for the creation of catalysts with superior performance compared to traditional single-metal catalysts.

The study of bimetallic catalysts has led to the development of advanced materials with tailored properties for various industrial applications, including the production of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and renewable energy technologies. These catalysts have been designed to operate under extreme conditions, such as high temperatures and pressures, while maintaining high efficiency and selectivity. The integration of bimetallic catalysts into industrial processes has resulted in increased productivity, reduced waste generation, and a decreased environmental impact.

The future of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis is promising, with ongoing research focusing on the development of more efficient, selective, and environmentally friendly catalysts. Innovations in synthesis techniques, surface science, and computational modeling are driving the creation of catalysts with enhanced properties, enabling their widespread adoption in various industrial sectors.

The Pt3Ni(111)-skin surface demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Its unique electronic structure and surface composition enable a 10-fold increase in activity compared to pure platinum (Pt) surfaces and a 90-fold increase compared to current state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts. The Pt3Ni(111)-skin surface's high activity is attributed to the increased number of active sites for oxygen adsorption, facilitated by the weak interaction between surface atoms and non-reactive oxygenated species. This surface property, along with its distinct electronic structure, contributes to its exceptional catalytic performance in PEMFC applications.

To further enhance the efficiency and sustainability of PEMFCs, the challenge lies in creating nanocatalysts with electronic and morphological properties that mimic the Pt3Ni(111)-skin surface. This would involve developing materials capable of achieving high power densities with reduced amounts of precious metals, such as platinum, while maintaining or even improving cell voltage and maximum power density. The engineering of Pt3Ni(111)-skin-like nanocatalysts aims to address the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" in PEMFC technology, paving the way for more cost-effective, durable, and environmentally friendly fuel cell systems.
