[1] "These limitations could be eliminated if stable cathode catalysts, with an order of magnitude increase in the specific activity over that of state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts, can be developed."
[2] "Rather than use a trial-and-error or combinatorial approach, we have examined selected cathode materials with well-characterized surfaces so that the mechanism of action can be attributed to a specific property (at the atomic and molecular level) of the surface under study."
[3] "The ORR is a multielectron reaction (O2 + 2H+ + 2e = H2O) that may include a number of elementary steps involving different reaction intermediates (7, 30)."
[4] "We demonstrated that the Pt3Ni(111) surface is 10-fold more active for the ORR than the corresponding Pt(111) surface and 90-fold more active than the current state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts for PEMFC."

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction has seen significant advancements aimed at bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. These developments have focused on creating catalysts with tailored electronic and chemical properties that enhance catalytic activity and efficiency. By examining selected materials with well-characterized surfaces, researchers aim to attribute the mechanism of action to specific properties at the atomic and molecular levels. This approach allows for the optimization of catalysts that can achieve an order of magnitude increase in specific activity compared to state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts, particularly in the context of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The Pt3Ni(111) surface, for instance, has been shown to be 10-fold more active for the ORR than the Pt(111) surface and 90-fold more active than current state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts, showcasing the potential for bimetallic catalysts to significantly improve fuel cell performance.

自商业引入以来，双金属催化剂在异相催化中的发展旨在通过模型表面和工业相关支持催化剂之间的“材料差距”和“压力差距”来实现突破。这些发展重点关注的是创造具有增强催化活性和效率的催化剂，其电子和化学性质被精心设计。通过研究具有精确表征表面的选定材料，研究人员旨在将作用机制归因于表面研究下的原子和分子水平的特定属性。这种方法允许优化能够与最先进的Pt/C催化剂相比实现至少十倍的特定活性的催化剂，特别是在聚合物电解质膜燃料电池（PEMFC）中的氧还原反应（ORR）背景下。例如，Pt3Ni(111)表面已被证明对于ORR比Pt(111)表面更活跃10倍，并且比当前最先进的Pt/C催化剂更活跃90倍，这表明双金属催化剂有可能显著提高燃料电池性能。
