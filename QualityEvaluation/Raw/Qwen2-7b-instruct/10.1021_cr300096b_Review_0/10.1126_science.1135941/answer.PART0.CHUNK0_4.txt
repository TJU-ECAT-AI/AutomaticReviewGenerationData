Rather than use a trial-and-error or combinatorial approach, we have examined selected cathode materials with well-characterized surfaces so that the mechanism of action can be attributed to a specific property (at the atomic and molecular level) of the surface under study. In this way, we can determine (i) whether the kinetics of the ORR are structure-sensitive, (ii) the composition of the topmost surface atomic layers (the segregation profile), and (iii) how alloying [usually described in terms of the ligand effect or/and ensemble effect (1820)] alters the chemical properties of the surfaces.

Answer: This study aimed to understand the factors affecting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics by examining the structure-sensitive properties of specific cathode materials. It sought to determine if the ORR kinetics are influenced by surface structure, the composition of the topmost surface atomic layers, and the effects of alloying on chemical properties.

These differences have been attributed to the structure-sensitive adsorption of OHad on Pt(hkl) and its inhibiting (site blocking) effect on O2 adsorption. In the potential region of OH adsorption, the structure sensitivity of the Pt3Ni(hkl)-skin surfaces has the same origin.

Answer: The differences in activity among the Pt3Ni(hkl) surfaces are attributed to the structure-sensitive adsorption of OHad, which inhibits O2 adsorption. This mechanism explains the structure sensitivity observed in the potential region where OH adsorption occurs.

Considering that the Pt3Ni(111)-skin surface exhibits the highest catalytic activity that has ever been detected, the challenge would be to create a nanocatalyst with electronic and morphological properties that mimic the Pt3Ni(111) surface. Therefore in the future, a way to reduce the current value (1.0 g of Pt per kW) of Pt-specific power density in a PEMFC without a loss in cell voltage, while also maintaining the maximum power density (W/cm2), would be the engineering of Pt3Ni(111)-skinlike nanocatalysts.

Answer: Achieving high catalytic activity akin to the Pt3Ni(111) surface is a significant challenge. Future efforts aim to engineer nanocatalysts that replicate the electronic and morphological characteristics of the Pt3Ni(111) surface, thereby reducing the specific power density of Pt in a PEMFC without compromising cell voltage or maximum power density.

1. 此研究旨在通过分析特定阴极材料的表面特性，确定ORR动力学是否受到表面结构、最上层表面原子层的组成（分层轮廓）以及合金化对化学性质影响的控制。它试图确定（i）ORR动力学是否是结构敏感的，（ii）最上层表面原子层的组成（分层轮廓），和（iii）合金化（通常用配体效应或/和集合效应来描述）如何改变表面的化学性质。
2. 这些差异归因于在Pt(hkl)上OHad的结构敏感吸附及其对O2吸附的抑制作用。在OH吸附的电位区域内，Pt3Ni(hkl)-skin表面的结构敏感性源于同样的机制。
3. 考虑到Pt3Ni(111)-skin表面表现出迄今为止最高的催化活性，挑战在于创造具有与Pt3Ni(111)表面相似的电子和形态特性的纳米催化剂。未来的目标是在不降低电池电压的情况下，通过减少每千瓦Pt的特定功率密度，并同时保持最大功率密度（W/cm2），工程设计出类似Pt3Ni(111)-skin的纳米催化剂。
