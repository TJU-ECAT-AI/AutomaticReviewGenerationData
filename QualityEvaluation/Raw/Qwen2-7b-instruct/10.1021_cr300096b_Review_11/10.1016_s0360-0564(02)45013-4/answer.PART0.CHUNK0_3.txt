[1] "The application of density functional theory to calculate adsorption properties, reac- tion pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions is reviewed."
[2] "Particular emphasis is placed on developing concepts that can be used to understand and predict variations in reactivity from one transition metal to the next or the effects of alloying, surface structure, and adsorbateadsorbate interactions on the reactivity."
[3] "Most examples discussed are concerned with the catalytic properties of transition metal surfaces, but it is shown that the calculational approach and the concepts developed to understand trends in reactivity for metals can also be used for sulfide and oxide catalysts."

The application of density functional theory (DFT) to analyze adsorption properties, reaction pathways, and activation energies of surface chemical reactions is reviewed. The focus is on understanding and predicting reactivity variations across different transition metals, including the impacts of alloying, surface structure, and interactions between adsorbates. These calculations are primarily applied to transition metal surfaces, but they are also applicable to sulfide and oxide catalysts.

密度泛函理论（DFT）被应用来研究吸附性质、反应途径和表面化学反应的活化能。重点是理解并预测从一个过渡金属到另一个过渡金属的反应性变化，以及合金化、表面结构和吸附剂相互作用对反应性的影响。这些计算主要应用于过渡金属表面，但它们也适用于硫化物和氧化物催化剂。
