[1] "The application of density functional theory to calculate adsorption properties, reac- tion pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions is reviewed."
[2] "Particular emphasis is placed on developing concepts that can be used to understand and predict variations in reactivity from one transition metal to the next or the effects of alloying, surface structure, and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions on the reactivity."
[3] "Most examples discussed are concerned with the catalytic properties of transition metal surfaces, but it is shown that the calculational approach and the concepts developed to understand trends in reactivity for metals can also be used for sulfide and oxide catalysts."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes significantly to sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing efficiency and reducing waste. Key advantages over traditional methods include higher product yields, minimized environmental impact due to optimized reaction conditions, and improved practical implementation through tailored catalyst design. By applying density functional theory (DFT), researchers can predict and understand the reactivity trends across various metals, alloys, and surface structures, which is crucial for developing more effective catalysts. This approach allows for the precise calculation of adsorption properties, reaction pathways, and activation energies, enabling the optimization of catalytic processes for oxygenate reforming and other reactions.
