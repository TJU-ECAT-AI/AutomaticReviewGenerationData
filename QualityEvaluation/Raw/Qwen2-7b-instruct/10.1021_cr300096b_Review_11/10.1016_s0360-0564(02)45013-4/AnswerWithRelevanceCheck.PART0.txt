          The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes significantly to sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing efficiency and reducing waste. Key advantages over traditional methods include higher product yields, minimized environmental impact due to optimized reaction conditions, and improved practical implementation through tailored catalyst design. By applying density functional theory (DFT), researchers can predict and understand the reactivity trends across various metals, alloys, and surface structures, which is crucial for developing more effective catalysts.
