<p>Conversion of biomass to fuels has been a subject of research for many years because of its environmental benefits and renewability.</p>
<p>Aqueous phase reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons, like alcohols and polyols, to produce hydrogen, has been especially of great interest.</p>
<p>In our previous studies, we have reported hydrogen production from ethylene glycol, sugars and sorbitol using noble metals supported on high surface area mesoporous supports.</p>
<p>It was suggested in the report that co-impregnation of Pt and Ni may prevent the formation of nickel aluminate, which is formed during calcination at temperature in excess of 450 C.</p>
<p>This enables reduction of the catalysts at lower temperature resulting in higher dispersion.</p>
<p>Aluminum nanofiber (Alnf) supported catalysts showed no effect of the impregnation sequence on the H2 activity and selectivity, which was expected from the TPR results.</p>
<p>The rate of H2 formation from aqueous phase reforming was found to be highest for co-impregnated NiPt/Alnf, followed by sequentially impregnated Pt/Ni and monometallic Ni catalyst.</p>

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting biomass-derived oxygenates into hydrogen, which can be utilized as a renewable energy source. Key advantages include:

1. **Product Yield**: Co-impregnated NiPt/Alnf catalysts showed the highest rate of H2 formation, indicating superior performance compared to sequentially impregnated Pt/Ni and monometallic Ni catalysts.
2. **Environmental Impact**: By utilizing renewable biomass resources, this method offers a cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based processes, reducing carbon emissions and dependence on non-renewable resources.
3. **Practical Implementation**: The ability to tailor catalyst properties through impregnation sequences and support materials enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the process, potentially leading to more efficient and scalable industrial applications.

These findings suggest that selective oxygenate reforming not only boosts hydrogen production rates but also promotes environmental sustainability and resource efficiency in chemical synthesis and energy production.
