<p>In our previous studies, we have reported hydrogen production from ethylene glycol, sugars and sorbitol using noble metals supported on high surface area mesoporous supports.</p>
<p>The increase in the activity was believed to be due to two factorsfirst, the increase in reducibility of the Ni catalysts resulted in higher number of active sites. Second, the alloying of Pt and Ni decreased the CO binding energy on the active metal site which reduced catalyst poisoning and also increased the fraction of active sites available for the reforming reaction.</p>
<p>Ceremix and zirconia based mixed oxide supports have been extensively researched in the recent past for variety of reactions such as low temperature water gas shift, preferential CO oxidation, and methanol reforming. The mixed oxides performed better than the individual oxides due to their higher hydrothermal stability and oxygen storage capacity which is desirable in preferential oxidation of CO.</p>
<p>The rate of H2 formation from aqueous phase reforming was found to be highest for co-impregnated NiPt catalysts followed by sequentially impregnated Pt/Ni and monometallic Ni catalyst. The H2 activity decreased in the following order of the supports: Alnf > ZrO2 > CZ3S > CZ7S.</p>
