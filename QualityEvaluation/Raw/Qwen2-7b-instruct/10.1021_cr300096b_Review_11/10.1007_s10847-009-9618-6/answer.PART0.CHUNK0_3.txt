[1] "Conversion of biomass to fuels has been a subject of research for many years because of its environmental benefits and renewability."
[2] "In particular, our recent report showed that addition of minute quantities of noble metals to Ni, forms alloy catalyst which increased the rate of hydrogen formation from aqueous phase reforming of sorbitol by 35 times."
[3] "It was suggested in the report that co-impregnation of Pt and Ni may prevent the formation of nickel aluminate, which is formed during calcination at temperature in excess of 450 C."
[4] "This is believed to be due to the difference in metal support interaction leading to variation in metal crystallite size and dispersion."
[5] "In this study, we analyse the effect of this interaction on the bimetallic NiPt catalyst using XRD, TEM/EDS and temperature programmed reduction."
[6] "The rate of H2 formation from aqueous phase reforming was found to be highest for co-impregnated NiPt/Alnf, followed by sequentially impregnated Pt/Ni/Alnf and monometallic Ni catalyst."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing renewable biomass feedstocks, thereby reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Its key advantages over traditional methods include:

1. Increased product yield: The use of bimetallic catalysts like NiPt can enhance the rate of hydrogen formation from aqueous phase reforming of sorbitol by 35 times compared to monometallic Ni catalysts. This leads to higher efficiency in converting biomass to hydrogen, a clean and versatile fuel.

2. Environmental impact: Since the process uses renewable resources and potentially reduces emissions, it aligns with sustainable energy goals. The reduction in carbon footprint associated with hydrogen production from biomass reforming supports cleaner energy solutions.

3. Practical implementation: The ability to tailor catalyst properties through impregnation techniques allows for optimization of the reforming process. For instance, co-impregnation of Pt and Ni can prevent the formation of nickel aluminate, enabling reduction of catalysts at lower temperatures, which simplifies industrial implementation.

These advantages highlight the potential of selective oxygenate reforming as a promising approach in the development of sustainable energy and chemical production processes.

选择性氧化合物重整过程通过利用可再生生物质原料，从而减少了对化石燃料的依赖，为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。与传统方法相比，其主要优势包括：

1. 提高产品产量：使用双金属催化剂（如NiPt）可以将水相重整糖醇产生氢气的速度提高35倍，与单一金属Ni催化剂相比。这导致了将生物质转化为氢气的更高效率，氢气是一种清洁且多功能的燃料。

2. 环境影响：由于该过程使用可再生资源并且可能减少排放，因此它符合可持续能源的目标。生物质重整产生的氢气生产中碳足迹的减少支持了清洁能源解决方案。

3. 实施实践：通过浸渍技术调整催化剂性能的能力允许优化重整过程。例如，Ni和Pt的共浸渍可以防止镍铝酸盐的形成，从而在较低温度下进行催化剂还原，简化了工业实施。

这些优势凸显了选择性氧化合物重整作为开发可持续能源和化学生产过程有前景的方法的潜力。
