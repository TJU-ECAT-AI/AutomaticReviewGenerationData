[1] "Oxygenates such as methanol and ethylene glycol can be reformed to produce CO and H2 on various transition metal surfaces. Facile reforming of biomass-derived oxygenates to H2 and CO provides for a renewable route to a hydrogen economy."
[2] "The catalytic decompositions of methanol and ethylene glycol on polycrystalline Ni/Pt surfaces were used as model probe reactions to explore oxygenate reforming for H2 production."
[3] "While Pt has been identified as a promising catalyst for this chemistry, Ni based catalysts have also been found to be active to ethylene glycol decomposition but suffer selectivity loss from alkane production."
[4] "The Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces display chemical properties that are different from both Ni(111) and Pt(111). For example, density functional theory (DFT) modeling indicates that the binding energies of CH3OH and methoxy (CH3O) decrease significantly on PtNiPt(111) as compared to Pt(111) or Ni(111), while the binding energies on NiPtPt(111) are greater than on either of the parent metal surfaces."
[5] "The reforming activities follow the trend of NiPtPt >> PtNiPt > Pt. Similar to that described on single crystal NiPtPt(111) surface [13] ,[18], the increased activity on polycrystalline NiPtPt is likely due to strong adsorbate binding energies resulting from a shift in the Fermi level toward the d-band center, as compared to Pt."

How does the process of selective oxygenate reforming contribute to sustainable energy and chemical production, and what are its key advantages in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation compared to traditional methods?

Selective oxygenate reforming plays a crucial role in sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting biomass-derived oxygenates like methanol and ethylene glycol into hydrogen and carbon monoxide. This method offers several key advantages over traditional approaches:

1. **Product Yield**: The reforming process on Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, particularly the NiPtPt configuration, demonstrates higher reforming activities, leading to a more efficient production of hydrogen and carbon monoxide from oxygenates. This results in higher yields of valuable chemical feedstocks compared to conventional methods.

2. **Environmental Impact**: By utilizing renewable resources like biomass, the process reduces dependence on fossil fuels, thereby decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating environmental degradation associated with traditional energy production methods. Moreover, the ability to selectively produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide minimizes waste generation and enhances the sustainability of the chemical production process.

3. **Practical Implementation**: The findings suggest that the observed chemistry on single crystal Ni/Pt surfaces can be effectively translated to more practical polycrystalline materials. This implies that the promising catalytic properties identified in lab-scale experiments can be scaled up for industrial applications, making the technology more accessible and economically viable. The use of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, especially the NiPtPt configuration, holds potential for broader adoption in hydrogen production facilities, potentially revolutionizing the energy sector.

In summary, selective oxygenate reforming offers a sustainable alternative for hydrogen production, with enhanced efficiency, reduced environmental impact, and improved scalability compared to traditional methods.
