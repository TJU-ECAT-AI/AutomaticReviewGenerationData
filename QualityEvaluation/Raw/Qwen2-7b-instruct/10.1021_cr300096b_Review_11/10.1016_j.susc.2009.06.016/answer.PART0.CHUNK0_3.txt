[1] "The catalytic decompositions of methanol and ethylene glycol on polycrystalline Ni/Pt surfaces were used as model probe reactions to explore oxygenate reforming for H2 production."
[2] "The reforming activities follow the trend of NiPtPt >> PtNiPt > Pt."
[3] "The principle difference between single crystal and polycrystalline Pt is the formation of methane."
[4] "Similar to the single crystal counterparts, stronger binding energies of adsorbates on polycrystalline NiPtPt also make this an effective bimetallic surface for oxygenate reforming."
[5] "HREELS results suggest that OH bond scission is probably the first step in the decomposition for both oxygenates on polycrystalline Pt, PtNiPt, and NiPtPt surfaces."
[6] "In contrast to single crystal surfaces, subsurface PtNiPt shows higher reforming activities than Pt for the reforming of CH3OH and C2H4(OH)2."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by providing a renewable route to hydrogen economy. It offers advantages in terms of higher product yield, reduced environmental impact, and easier practical implementation compared to traditional methods due to its ability to efficiently convert biomass-derived oxygenates into hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

2. The key advantage in terms of product yield is the ability to selectively reform oxygenates, ensuring that hydrogen is produced with minimal byproducts.

3. In terms of environmental impact, selective oxygenate reforming reduces emissions and waste, aligning better with sustainable practices.

4. Practically, the method offers easier implementation by potentially requiring less energy input and simpler processing steps, making it more accessible for widespread use.

5. Stronger binding energies of adsorbates on polycrystalline NiPtPt surfaces enhance the efficiency of oxygenate reforming, making it an effective alternative to traditional methods.

6. The higher reforming activities of subsurface PtNiPt compared to polycrystalline Pt surfaces suggest that this configuration could offer improved performance in oxygenate reforming processes.
