The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing the conversion of biomass-derived molecules into higher value products. Its key advantages over traditional methods include increased product yields, reduced environmental impacts, and improved operational efficiency. Compared to conventional processes, selective oxygenate reforming promises lower greenhouse gas emissions and waste generation. Practical implementation, however, necessitates further research to optimize conditions and scale-up operations.
