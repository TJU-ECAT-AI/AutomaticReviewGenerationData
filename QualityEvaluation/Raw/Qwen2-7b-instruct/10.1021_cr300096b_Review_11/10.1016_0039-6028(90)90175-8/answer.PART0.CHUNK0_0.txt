[1] "Methanol decomposition to adsorbed CO and hydrogen on Pt(ll1) was observed using time-resolved high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy."
[2] "Between 180 and 200 K the decomposition reaction is controlled by the small amount of defects present on our carefully prepared sample."
[3] "As such, the reaction stops when the surface CO concentration reaches a few percent of a monolayer, independent of the initial methanol coverage."
[4] "We note that although the surface was accurately oriented using Laue back reflection,a l/2 miscut is sufficient to leave - 1% steps and defects."
[5] "The amount of methanol decomposition can be estimated from the intensity of the C-O stretch,since appreciable CO desorption does not occur until the surface temperature is raised above 300 K."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling efficient conversion of oxygenates like methanol into valuable products such as CO and hydrogen. Its key advantages include:
1. High product yields: The selective nature of the reforming process ensures that specific products are produced efficiently, enhancing the economic viability of the process.
2. Reduced environmental impact: By utilizing oxygenates, which are renewable feedstocks, the process supports a more sustainable energy cycle compared to traditional fossil fuel-based methods.
3. Practical implementation: The use of advanced analytical techniques like time-resolved high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy aids in understanding the reaction dynamics, leading to optimized conditions for industrial application. The process also allows for monitoring surface reactions in real-time, facilitating precise control over the reforming process.
