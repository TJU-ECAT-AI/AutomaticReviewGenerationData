[1] "The effects of steps and defects in controlling surface reaction pathways is by now a well known phenomenon."
[2] "Methanol adsorption,desorption,and decom- position on Pt(ll1) has been observed by Sexton using high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) [5]."
[3] "In all cases,little or no dissociation is observed on the per- fect terrace."
[4] "The Pt(ll1) sample was dosed using a differentially pumped, pulsed molecular beam source so that gas-exposures could be accurately controlled and reproduced."
[5] "Sample cleanliness and order were checked using Auger electron spec- troscopy and low-energy electron diffraction,re- spectively."
[6] "The amount of methanol decomposition can be estimated from the intensity of the C-O stretch,since appreciable CO desorption does not occur until the surface temperature is raised above 300 K."

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by selectively converting oxygenates like methanol into desired products while minimizing waste. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and enhanced efficiency in resource utilization compared to traditional methods. These improvements stem from the precise control over reaction conditions and pathways, allowing for more efficient conversion and separation of products.

1. 选择性氧化物重整过程通过选择性地将如甲醇之类的氧化物转化为所需产品，同时减少浪费，为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。其关键优势包括更高的产品产率、较低的环境影响（由于排放量较低）以及资源利用效率的提高，与传统方法相比，这些改进源于对反应条件和途径的精确控制，从而实现了更高效的转换和产品分离。

2. Methanol decomposition on Pt(ll1) has been observed using high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) techniques, demonstrating the role of steps and defects in controlling the reaction pathway. In perfect terraces, little to no dissociation occurs, highlighting the importance of surface imperfections for the reaction to proceed. The Pt(ll1) sample was accurately prepared and dosed using a controlled molecular beam source, ensuring reproducible experiments. Sample cleanliness and structure were verified through Auger electron spectroscopy and low-energy electron diffraction. The extent of methanol decomposition can be estimated by analyzing the intensity of the C-O stretch vibration, indicating the formation of CO upon reaching a surface temperature of 300 K or higher.
