[1] "Methanol decomposition to adsorbed CO and hydrogen on Pt(ll1) was observed using time-resolved high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy."
[2] "Between 180 and 200 K the decomposition reaction is controlled by the small amount of defects present on our carefully prepared sample."
[3] "As such, the reaction stops when the surface CO concentration reaches a few percent of a monolayer, independent of the initial methanol coverage."
[4] "We note that although the surface was accurately oriented using Laue back reflection,a l/2 miscut is sufficient to leave - 1% steps and defects."
[5] "The amount of methanol decomposition can be estimated from the intensity of the C-O stretch,since appreciable CO desorption does not occur until the surface temperature is raised above 300 K."

1. 选择性氧化物重整过程通过选择性地将如甲醇之类的氧化物转化为所需产品，同时减少浪费，为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。其关键优势包括更高的产品产率、较低的环境影响（由于排放量较低）以及资源利用效率的提高，与传统方法相比，这些改进源于对反应条件和途径的精确控制，从而实现了更高效的转换和产品分离。

2. Methanol decomposition on Pt(ll1) has been observed using high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) techniques, demonstrating the role of steps and defects in controlling the reaction pathway. In perfect terraces, little to no dissociation occurs, highlighting the importance of surface imperfections for the reaction to proceed. The Pt(ll1) sample was accurately prepared and dosed using a controlled molecular beam source, ensuring reproducible experiments. Sample cleanliness and structure were verified through Auger electron spectroscopy and low-energy electron diffraction. The extent of methanol decomposition can be estimated by analyzing the intensity of the C-O stretch vibration, indicating the formation of CO upon reaching a surface temperature of 300 K or higher.
