[1] "The original purpose of our experiments was to measure the kinetics of this decomposition reaction using time-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (TREELS)."
[2] "The monochroma- tor pass energy was 4 eV and the resolution (full width at half maximum of the elastic scattering peak) was - 12 meV."
[3] "The amount of methanol decomposition can be estimated from the intensity of the C-O stretch, since appreciable CO desorption does not occur until the surface temperature is raised above 300 K."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting oxygenates, such as methanol, into valuable products with minimal environmental impact. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers several key advantages:

1. Product Yield: It yields a higher proportion of desired products, reducing waste and enhancing economic efficiency.
2. Environmental Impact: It minimizes emissions and byproducts, promoting cleaner energy production processes.
3. Practical Implementation: It enables the use of existing infrastructure, reduces the need for new facilities, and potentially lowers costs through optimized reaction conditions and catalyst design.

These improvements lead to more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy and chemical production, supporting the transition towards cleaner technologies.
