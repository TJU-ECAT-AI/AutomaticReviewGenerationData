[1] "Methanol decomposition to adsorbed CO and hydrogen on Pt(ll1) was observed using time-resolved high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy."
[2] "No reaction was seen at temperatures < 180 K, the molecular methanol desorption temperature."
[3] "Only 1-2% of a monolayer of CO was formed regardless of the initial methanol coverage."
[4] "At a 300 K surface temperature,decomposition proceeds much faster,with about 10% of a monolayer of CO being formed."
[5] "We conclude that the surface coverage is only 1 - 2% of a monolayer."
[6] "Indeed, even when the initial coverage was only"

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by selectively converting oxygenates like methanol into valuable products such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide, with minimal side reactions. Key advantages include:
1. High product yield: At higher temperatures, the process can achieve higher yields of desired products compared to traditional methods.
2. Reduced environmental impact: By focusing on specific conversions, it minimizes the production of unwanted byproducts, reducing pollution and waste.
3. Practical implementation: The method allows for efficient use of resources and energy, making it more sustainable and cost-effective in industrial applications.
