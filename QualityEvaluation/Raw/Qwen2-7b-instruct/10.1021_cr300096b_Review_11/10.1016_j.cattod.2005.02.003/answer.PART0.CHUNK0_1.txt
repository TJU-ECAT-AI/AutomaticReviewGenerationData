[1] "Today the market for these chemicals has not developed because of their high cost due to their expensive current syntheses."
[2] "However, using an oxidation process applied to aqueous solutions using air on recyclable catalysts will lower the cost and also will be beneficial from environmental point of view."
[3] "The big challenge associated with these catalytic oxidation reactions is to control and direct the reaction pathway to the desired products."
[4] "It has been shown that by tuning the reaction conditions, particularly the pH, the selectivity to the desired product could be tuned."
[5] "Moreover, bimetallic catalysts were by far more active than monometals."
[6] "Selectivity could be tuned by using different preparation method."
[7] "The study has shown that depending upon the nature of the metal and the reaction conditions, it is possible to direct the distribution of the products for the oxidation of glycerol."
[8] "In terms of activity either at 30 or 50 C, bimetallic catalysts are more active than monometals, indicating that a synergetic effect exists between Au and M (Pd or Pt)."
[9] "In terms of selectivity to glyceric acid, (AuPd) catalysts showed in general better selectivity than (AuPt) catalysts, with Pd mainly to promote the formation of tartronic acid and Pt to glycolic acid."
[10] "Thus, since a drop in the selectivity to glyceric acid happened during the duration of the reaction, we have to suppose another reaction pathway for the formation of glycolic and tartronic acids, except from the over-oxidation of glyceric acid (Scheme 1)."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional synthesis methods. Its key advantages include:

1. Cost Reduction: Utilizing an oxidation process with recyclable catalysts decreases production costs compared to conventional methods.
   
2. Environmental Benefits: This process can be implemented in a manner that is environmentally friendly, reducing pollution and waste.

3. Product Yield Control: By adjusting reaction conditions, such as pH, the yield of desired products can be precisely controlled, optimizing efficiency.

4. Synergistic Effect: Bimetallic catalysts exhibit superior activity, indicating a cooperative effect between metals like Au and Pd or Pt, enhancing the catalytic performance.

5. Selective Product Formation: The use of different metals and reaction conditions allows for the directed formation of specific products, improving the sustainability of the production process.

6. Enhanced Selectivity: Bimetallic catalysts offer better selectivity to glyceric acid compared to monometals, minimizing unwanted side reactions and maximizing the yield of the desired chemical.

7. Dynamic Reaction Pathways: The study reveals the existence of alternative reaction pathways beyond simple over-oxidation, providing flexibility in the production process.

These advantages collectively suggest that selective oxygenate reforming is a promising approach for sustainable energy and chemical production, offering a balance between economic viability, environmental responsibility, and product purity.
