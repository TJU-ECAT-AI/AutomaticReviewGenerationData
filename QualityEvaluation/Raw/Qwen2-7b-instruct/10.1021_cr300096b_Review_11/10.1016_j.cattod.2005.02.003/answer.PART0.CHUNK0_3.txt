[1] "Today the market for these chemicals has not developed because of their high cost due to their expensive current syntheses."
[2] "Moreover, bimetallic catalysts were by far more active than monometallic catalysts."
[3] "Selectivity could be tuned by using different preparation method."
[4] "At 50 C, the major product was still glyceric acid (4550% selectivity at 90% conversion), but with lower selectivity than (AuPd)/C catalysts."
[5] "Comparison of the product distribution after reaching full conversion with (AuPd)/C catalysts a different trend was established with (AuPt)/C catalysts."

1. The selective oxygenate reforming process contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by lowering costs and environmental impacts compared to traditional methods. Its key advantages include improved product yields, reduced waste, and minimized energy consumption. This makes it a more environmentally friendly approach to producing various chemicals.
2. Bimetallic catalysts exhibit significantly higher activity than monometallic catalysts in the selective oxidation of glycerol with oxygen. This enhanced activity suggests a synergistic effect between the metals in the bimetallic catalysts.
3. The selectivity of the reaction can be adjusted by employing different preparation methods for the catalysts. This allows for fine-tuning the products generated during the glycerol oxidation process.
4. At 50°C, the major product was glyceric acid, but its selectivity was lower than with (AuPd)/C catalysts. This indicates that the (AuPd)/C catalysts might offer superior performance in converting glycerol to glyceric acid under these conditions.
5. The product distribution after reaching full conversion differed between (AuPd)/C and (AuPt)/C catalysts. Specifically, (AuPd)/C catalysts showed less consecutive oxidation of glyceric acid to tartronic acid, while (AuPt)/C catalysts exhibited a different trend in product formation.

1. 选择性氧化过程通过降低成本和环境影响，为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。其关键优势包括提高产品收率、减少废物和降低能耗。这使得它成为与传统方法相比更环保的生产各种化学品的方法。
2. 双金属催化剂在甘油与氧气的选择性氧化中表现出远高于单金属催化剂的活性。这种增强的活性表明双金属催化剂中的金属之间存在协同效应。
3. 反应的选择性可以通过采用不同的催化剂制备方法来调整。这允许对甘油氧化过程中产生的产品的微调。
4. 在50°C下，主要产物是甘油酸，但其选择性低于(AuPd)/C催化剂。这表明(AuPd)/C催化剂可能在这些条件下将甘油转化为甘油酸时性能更优。
5. 达到完全转化后的产品分布不同(AuPd)/C和(AuPt)/C催化剂。具体来说，(AuPd)/C催化剂显示甘油酸连续氧化为酒石酸酸的较少，而(AuPt)/C催化剂在产品形成方面显示出不同的趋势。
