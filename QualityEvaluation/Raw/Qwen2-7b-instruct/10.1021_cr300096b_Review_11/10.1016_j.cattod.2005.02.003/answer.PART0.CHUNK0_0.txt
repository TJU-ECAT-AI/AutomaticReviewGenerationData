[1] "Today the market for these chemicals has not developed because of their high cost due to their expensive current syntheses."
[2] "Moreover, bimetallic catalysts were by far more active than monometallic catalysts."
[3] "It was found that by using bimetallic catalysts (AuPd, AuPt) the distribution of the products could be controlled."
[4] "Selectivity could be tuned by using different preparation method."
[5] "However, bimetallic catalysts are more active than monometallic catalysts, indicating that a synergetic effect exists between Au and M (Pd or Pt)."
[6] "In terms of selectivity to glyceric acid, (AuPd) catalysts showed in general better selectivity than (AuPt) catalysts, with Pd mainly to promote the formation of tartronic acid and Pt to glycolic acid."
