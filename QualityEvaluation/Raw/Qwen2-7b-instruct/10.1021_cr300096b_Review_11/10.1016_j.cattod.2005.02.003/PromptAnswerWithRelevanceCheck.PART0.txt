[1] "Today the market for these chemicals has not developed because of their high cost due to their expensive current syntheses."
[2] "However, using an oxidation process applied to aqueous solutions using air on recyclable catalysts will lower the cost and also will be beneficial from environmental point of view."
[3] "The big challenge associated with these catalytic oxidation reactions is to control and direct the reaction pathway to the desired products."
[4] "It has been shown that by tuning the reaction conditions, particularly the pH, the selectivity to the desired product could be tuned."
[5] "Moreover, bimetallic catalysts were by far more active than monometals."
[6] "Selectivity could be tuned by using different preparation method."
[7] "The study has shown that depending upon the nature of the metal and the reaction conditions, it is possible to direct the distribution of the products for the oxidation of glycerol."
[8] "In terms of activity either at 30 or 50 C, bimetallic catalysts are more active than monometals, indicating that a synergetic effect exists between Au and M (Pd or Pt)."
[9] "In terms of selectivity to glyceric acid, (AuPd) catalysts showed in general better selectivity than (AuPt) catalysts, with Pd mainly to promote the formation of tartronic acid and Pt to glycolic acid."
[10] "Thus, since a drop in the selectivity to glyceric acid happened during the duration of the reaction, we have to suppose another reaction pathway for the formation of glycolic and tartronic acids, except from the over-oxidation of glyceric acid (Scheme 1)."
