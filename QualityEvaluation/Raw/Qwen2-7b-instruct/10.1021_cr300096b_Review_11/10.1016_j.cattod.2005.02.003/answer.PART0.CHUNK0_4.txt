[1] "Today the market for these chemicals has not developed because of their high cost due to their expensive current syntheses."
[2] "Moreover, bimetallic catalysts were by far more active than monometallic catalysts."
[3] "Selectivity could be tuned by using different preparation method."
[4] "At 50 C, the major product was glyceric acid (7058% selectivity at 90% conversion) followed by tartronic and glycolic acids."
[5] "However, depending on the reaction temperature, the catalytic data showed that at lower temperature (30 C), the major product was glyceric acid (7058% selectivity at 90% conversion) followed by tartronic and glycolic acids, indicating that the main loss of selectivity to glyceric acid was due to the formation of tartronic acid."
[6] "These results indicate that the effect of reaction temperature is mainly on the enhancement of the activity of the catalysts, while the selectivity of glyceric acid slightly decreased with increase of the temperature."
[7] "Thus, using (AuPd)/C prepared by method C, at 30 C we obtained the best result in terms of selectivity to glyceric acid (69% at 90% conversion)."
[8] "Comparison of the product distribution after reaching full conversion with (AuPt)/C catalysts a different trend was established with (AuPd)/C catalysts."

1. The selective oxygenate reforming process contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by lowering costs and benefiting the environment. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact, and easier practical implementation compared to traditional methods.

2. Bimetallic catalysts were found to be significantly more active than monometallic catalysts in the selective oxygenate reforming of glycerol.

3. The preparation method used can influence the selectivity of the reaction.

4. At 50°C, glyceric acid was the major product, followed by tartronic and glycolic acids.

5. At lower temperatures, glyceric acid remained the major product, but the selectivity to glyceric acid decreased as the temperature rose.

6. Higher temperatures led to an increase in the activity of the catalysts, but a slight decrease in the selectivity of glyceric acid.

7. Method C for preparing (AuPd)/C catalysts provided the best result in terms of selectivity to glyceric acid at 30°C.

8. The product distribution differed between (AuPd)/C and (AuPt)/C catalysts after reaching full conversion.
