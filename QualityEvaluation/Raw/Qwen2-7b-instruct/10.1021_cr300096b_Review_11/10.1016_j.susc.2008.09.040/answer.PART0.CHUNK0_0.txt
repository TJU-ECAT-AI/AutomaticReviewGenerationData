(1) "Along with ethanol, ethylene glycol has been studied as a potential feedstock for hydrogen production and as a model compound for larger polyols that can be derived from biomass such as glycerol, sorbitol, glucose, etc."
(2) "It was predicted that other 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces might also be potential catalysts for reforming of oxygenates."
(3) "Recent studies using supported catalysts showed that NiPt, CoPt, and FePt displayed increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol compared to Pt."
(4) "Combining these two results suggests that the initial OH bond scission of ethylene glycol is kinetically important and leads to increased overall yields."
(5) "Furthermore, the increased OH scission activity on NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film can be correlated with the increased binding energies of adsorbates, such as ethanol, ethoxy, and ethylene glycol, on these surfaces."

1. Ethanol and ethylene glycol are considered for hydrogen production and as models for larger polyols derived from biomass sources like glycerol, sorbitol, and glucose. 
2. Other 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces may also serve as catalysts for oxygenate reforming.
3. Supported catalysts like NiPt, CoPt, and FePt demonstrated higher turnover frequencies for ethylene glycol reforming in aqueous phases compared to pure platinum.
4. The initial OH bond scission of ethylene glycol is crucial and boosts overall yields.
5. The enhanced ability of NiPtPt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) film to scission OH bonds correlates with their higher adsorbate binding energies.
