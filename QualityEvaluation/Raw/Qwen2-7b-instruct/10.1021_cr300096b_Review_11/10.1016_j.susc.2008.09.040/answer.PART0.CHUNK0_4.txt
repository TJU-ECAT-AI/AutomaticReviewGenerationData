(1) "The reactions of oxygenates on transition metal surfaces are important for a variety of industrial processes. The production of hydrogen from oxygenated compounds has been a topic of increasing interest as a way to alleviate the environmental impact of fossil fuel consumption."
(2) "Along with ethanol, ethylene glycol has been studied as a potential feedstock for hydrogen production and as a model compound for larger polyols that can be derived from biomass such as glycerol, sorbitol, glucose, etc."
(3) "It was predicted that other 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces might also be potential catalysts for reforming of oxygenates."
(4) "The initial OH bond scission is identified as kinetically important for reforming of oxygenates on Pt-based surfaces. This explains the increased activity of NiPtPt(1 1 1) over Pt(1 1 1)."
(5) "Furthermore, this suggests that surfaces with increased rates of initial OH bond cleavage should be good potential catalysts for oxygenate reforming."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by converting oxygenated compounds into hydrogen, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. It offers advantages in terms of higher product yields, lower environmental impact, and practical implementation compared to traditional methods by potentially requiring milder conditions and being more efficient.

2. Ethanol and ethylene glycol have been studied as potential feedstocks for hydrogen production, with the latter serving as a model compound for larger polyols derived from biomass sources.

3. The study suggests that 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces might also serve as effective catalysts for the reforming of oxygenates.

4. The initial OH bond scission is recognized as a crucial kinetic step in the reforming process on Pt-based surfaces, explaining why NiPtPt(1 1 1) exhibits superior activity compared to Pt(1 1 1).

5. Surfaces with enhanced rates of initial OH bond cleavage are anticipated to be promising catalysts for oxygenate reforming, highlighting the importance of this step in achieving high efficiency and selectivity.
