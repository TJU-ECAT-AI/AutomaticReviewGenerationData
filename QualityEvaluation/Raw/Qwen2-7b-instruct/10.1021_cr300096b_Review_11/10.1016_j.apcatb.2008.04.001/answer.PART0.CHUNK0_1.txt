1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2, through substituting fossil fuels with hydrogen (H2). Its key advantages include higher product yield, reduced environmental impact due to cleaner combustion, and practical implementation with efficient catalysts that minimize carbon deposition.

2. The reforming activity of the bimetallic RhPt catalysts lies between the monometallic Rh and Pt catalysts, with the activity proportional to the Rh-loading. This indicates that a slight addition of Rh significantly improves the performance of the Pt catalyst.

3. The stability and selectivity of the bimetallic RhPt catalysts against carbon deposition are enhanced by increasing the Rh/Pt molar ratio. This suggests that the synergistic effect between Rh and Pt optimizes the catalyst's performance.

4. The reforming activity of the bimetallic RhPt catalysts is intermediate between monometallic Rh and Pt catalysts, in direct relation to the Rh-loading. This finding implies that the catalysts are optimized for specific conditions, balancing activity and selectivity.

5. Changing the Rh/Pt ratio allows for optimization of the RhPt catalyst performance. Additionally, adjusting the calcination temperature has a stabilizing effect on the catalysts, influencing their activity, selectivity, and stability.

6. Strong synergism between Rh and Pt is observed in the bimetallic RhPt catalysts based on TPR-, SEM-, and EDX-analysis. This synergism improves the catalyst's performance, enhancing its stability and selectivity.
