[1] "For energy production, substitution of fossil fuels by H2 is a suitable option for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, in particular CO2."
[2] "The major advantages of using H2 or H2-rich mixtures, i.e. syngas, as fuel include the diversity of primary fuels (natural gas, biomass, crude oil) that can be used in H2 production, its clean combustion and the possibility of long-term storage of the primary fuel."
[3] "Moreover, the reforming selectivity and the stability of bimetallic RhPt catalysts against carbon deposition improved with increasing Rh/Pt molar ratio."
[4] "The conventional Ni-based catalysts are also very sensitive for sulfur present in commercial fuels. This limitation can be overcome by the addition of a second metal to the Ni catalyst such as Pt or Pd."
[5] "Indeed, bimetallic RhPt catalysts have been superior to monometallic catalysts, suggesting synergism between the two metals."
[6] "Thus, changing the Rh/Pt ratio can optimize the RhPt catalyst performance, not forgetting the effect of calcination temperature."
[7] "Based on the TPR-, SEM-, and EDX-results and the behavior of the bimetallic catalysts in ATR, strong synergism between Rh and Pt is observed."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by substituting fossil fuels with hydrogen (H2), which reduces greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). Its key advantages include the flexibility of using diverse primary fuels in H2 production, clean combustion, and the potential for long-term storage of the primary fuel.

2. Using H2 or H2-rich mixtures as fuel offers several benefits such as the versatility of fuel sources (natural gas, biomass, crude oil), clean combustion, and the possibility of storing the primary fuel over the long term.

3. The selectivity and stability of bimetallic rhodium-platinum (RhPt) catalysts in preventing carbon deposition improve with an increase in the ratio of Rh to Pt.

4. Nickel-based catalysts are sensitive to sulfur in commercial fuels. Adding a second metal like palladium (Pd) or platinum (Pt) can mitigate this issue.

5. Bimetallic RhPt catalysts have demonstrated superior performance compared to monometallic catalysts, indicating a synergy between rhodium and platinum.

6. Adjusting the ratio of rhodium to platinum and the calcination temperature can optimize the performance of RhPt catalysts, taking into account the impact of these parameters on the catalyst's stability and efficiency.

7. Strong synergistic effects between rhodium and platinum are observed based on the results of temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses, as well as the behavior of bimetallic catalysts in autothermal reforming (ATR) processes.

1. 选择性氧化物重整通过将化石燃料替换为氢（H2）来减少大气中的温室气体排放，尤其是二氧化碳（CO2），这有利于可持续能源和化工生产。其主要优势包括灵活使用不同类型的原始燃料进行氢生产、清洁燃烧以及长期储存原始燃料的可能性。

2. 使用H2或H2丰富的混合物作为燃料的优势在于能够灵活地利用多种原始燃料来源，具有清洁的燃烧特性，并且有可能长期储存原始燃料。

3. 铂族金属双金属（RhPt）催化剂在防止碳沉积方面的选择性和稳定性随着Rh与Pt比例的增加而提高。

4. 镍基催化剂对商业燃料中的硫非常敏感。通过向镍催化剂中添加第二种金属，如钯（Pd）或铂（Pt），可以克服这一限制。

5. 铂族金属双金属RhPt催化剂的性能优于单一金属催化剂，表明了铑和铂之间存在协同作用。

6. 调整铑与铂的比例以及煅烧温度可以优化RhPt催化剂的性能，考虑到这些参数对催化剂稳定性和效率的影响。

7. 根据温度程序还原（TPR）、扫描电子显微镜（SEM）和能量色散X射线（EDX）分析的结果，以及双金属催化剂在自热重整（ATR）过程中的行为，观察到了铑和铂之间的强烈协同效应。
