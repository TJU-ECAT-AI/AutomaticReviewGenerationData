1. The process of substituting fossil fuels with hydrogen (H2) contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). Hydrogen offers diverse sources for production, clean combustion, and the potential for long-term storage of primary fuels.

2. The key advantages of using hydrogen or hydrogen-rich mixtures, such as syngas, as fuel include the versatility of primary fuel sources (natural gas, biomass, crude oil), clean combustion, and the possibility of long-term storage of the primary fuel.

3. There is a growing interest in fuel cell technologies for heat and power production and as replacements for internal combustion engines, which significantly increases the demand for hydrogen production.

4. Nickel-based catalysts are sensitive to sulfur present in commercial fuels, which can be mitigated by adding a second metal like platinum (Pt) or palladium (Pd) to the catalyst or replacing nickel with these more sulfur-resistant noble metals.

5. The choice of material as a support affects catalyst performance. Zirconia (ZrO2) is the preferred support for rhodium (Rh) catalysts because it avoids the detrimental interaction between Rh and alumina (Al2O3), which reduces catalyst activity.

6. However, zirconia's disadvantage lies in its low surface area compared to other supports.

7. Bimetallic rhodium-platinum (RhPt) catalysts have shown superiority over monometallic catalysts, suggesting a synergy between the two metals and the formation of an alloy.

8. Higher calcination temperatures led to increased carbon deposition when platinum predominated and decreased carbon deposition when rhodium was dominant, likely due to the Boudouard reaction.

9. Based on thermal programmed reduction (TPR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) results, strong synergistic effects between rhodium and platinum were observed in the behavior of the bimetallic catalysts in autothermal reforming (ATR).

1. 替代化石燃料使用氢气（H2）有助于可持续能源和化学生产，通过减少温室气体排放，尤其是二氧化碳（CO2）。氢气提供了多种生产源，燃烧清洁，并且有可能长期储存原始燃料。

2. 使用氢或氢基混合物（如合成气）作为燃料的关键优势包括多种主要燃料来源（天然气、生物质、原油），清洁燃烧，以及原始燃料的长期存储可能性。

3. 对燃料电池技术在热能和电力生产以及内燃机的替代品中日益增长的兴趣显著增加了氢气生产的需要。

4. 镍基催化剂对商业燃料中的硫敏感，可以通过在催化剂中添加第二种金属如铂（Pt）或钯（Pd）来解决这一问题，或者用这些更耐硫的贵金属替换镍。

5. 催化剂支持的选择影响催化性能。氧化锆（ZrO2）是铑（Rh）催化剂的首选支持材料，因为它避免了铑与氧化铝（Al2O3）之间的不利相互作用，从而降低了催化剂活性。

6. 然而，氧化锆的缺点在于其比其他支持材料的低表面积。

7. 双金属铑-铂（RhPt）催化剂在单金属催化剂上表现出优越性，表明这两种金属之间存在协同作用，并形成了合金。

8. 较高的煅烧温度导致了当铂占主导地位时碳沉积增加，而当铑占主导地位时碳沉积减少，这可能归因于布杜瓦德反应。

9. 根据热程序化还原（TPR）、扫描电子显微镜（SEM）和能量色散X射线（EDX）结果，观察到了双金属催化剂在自热重整（ATR）行为中的强协同效应。
