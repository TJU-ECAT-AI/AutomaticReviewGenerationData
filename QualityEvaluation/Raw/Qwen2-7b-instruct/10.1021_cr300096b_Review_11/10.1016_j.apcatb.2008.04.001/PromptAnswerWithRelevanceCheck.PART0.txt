1. The process of substituting fossil fuels with hydrogen (H2) contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). Hydrogen offers diverse sources for production, clean combustion, and the potential for long-term storage of primary fuels.

2. The key advantages of using hydrogen or hydrogen-rich mixtures, such as syngas, as fuel include the versatility of primary fuel sources (natural gas, biomass, crude oil), clean combustion, and the possibility of long-term storage of the primary fuel.

3. There is a growing interest in fuel cell technologies for heat and power production and as replacements for internal combustion engines, which significantly increases the demand for hydrogen production.

4. Nickel-based catalysts are sensitive to sulfur present in commercial fuels, which can be mitigated by adding a second metal like platinum (Pt) or palladium (Pd) to the catalyst or replacing nickel with these more sulfur-resistant noble metals.

5. The choice of material as a support affects catalyst performance. Zirconia (ZrO2) is the preferred support for rhodium (Rh) catalysts because it avoids the detrimental interaction between Rh and alumina (Al2O3), which reduces catalyst activity.

6. However, zirconia's disadvantage lies in its low surface area compared to other supports.

7. Bimetallic rhodium-platinum (RhPt) catalysts have shown superiority over monometallic catalysts, suggesting a synergy between the two metals and the formation of an alloy.

8. Higher calcination temperatures led to increased carbon deposition when platinum predominated and decreased carbon deposition when rhodium was dominant, likely due to the Boudouard reaction.

9. Based on thermal programmed reduction (TPR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) results, strong synergistic effects between rhodium and platinum were observed in the behavior of the bimetallic catalysts in autothermal reforming (ATR).

1. 替代化石燃料使用氢气（H2）有助于可持续能源和化学生产，通过减少温室气体排放，尤其是二氧化碳（CO2）。氢气提供了多种生产源，燃烧清洁，并且有可能长期储存原始燃料。

2. 使用氢或氢基混合物（如合成气）作为燃料的关键优势包括多种主要燃料来源（天然气、生物质、原油），清洁燃烧，以及原始燃料的长期存储可能性。

5. 催化剂支持的选择影响催化性能。氧化锆（ZrO2）是铑（Rh）催化剂的首选支持材料，因为它避免了铑与氧化铝（Al2O3）之间的不利相互作用，从而降低了催化剂活性。

6. 然而，氧化锆的缺点在于其比其他支持材料的低表面积。

7. 双金属铑-铂（RhPt）催化剂在单金属催化剂上表现出优越性，表明这两种金属之间存在协同作用，并形成了合金。

8. 较高的煅烧温度导致了当铂占主导地位时碳沉积增加，而当铑占主导地位时碳沉积减少，这可能归因于布杜瓦德反应。

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2, through substituting fossil fuels with hydrogen (H2). Its key advantages include higher product yield, reduced environmental impact due to cleaner combustion, and practical implementation with efficient catalysts that minimize carbon deposition.

2. The reforming activity of the bimetallic RhPt catalysts lies between the monometallic Rh and Pt catalysts, with the activity proportional to the Rh-loading. This indicates that a slight addition of Rh significantly improves the performance of the Pt catalyst.

3. The stability and selectivity of the bimetallic RhPt catalysts against carbon deposition are enhanced by increasing the Rh/Pt molar ratio. This suggests that the synergistic effect between Rh and Pt optimizes the catalyst's performance.

4. The reforming activity of the bimetallic RhPt catalysts is intermediate between monometallic Rh and Pt catalysts, in direct relation to the Rh-loading. This finding implies that the catalysts are optimized for specific conditions, balancing activity and selectivity.

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by substituting fossil fuels with hydrogen (H2) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). Its key advantages include the versatility of fuel sources, cleaner combustion, and potential for long-term storage of primary fuels. It also reduces the risk of carbon deposition in higher hydrocarbons, such as gasoline and diesel, improving reforming selectivity and stability.

2. The conventional nickel-based catalysts are highly sensitive to sulfur present in commercial fuels, which can limit their use. However, adding a second metal like platinum (Pt) or palladium (Pd) or replacing nickel with more sulfur-resistant noble metals can overcome this limitation, enhancing the catalyst's performance.

3. Bimetallic rhodium-platinum (RhPt) catalysts exhibit superior performance compared to monometallic catalysts, suggesting a synergistic effect between the two metals. This leads to the formation of an alloy, which improves catalytic activity and stability against carbon deposition.

4. In the context of autothermal reforming of simulated gasoline, the reforming activity of noble metal catalysts is complete across the tested temperature range (400-900°C) for oxidation reactions, while on the support, oxygen consumption increases with temperature, reaching complete conversion at 850°C.

5. The study focuses on the autothermal reforming of simulated gasoline using zirconia-supported rhodium-platinum catalysts, producing fuel gas suitable for solid oxide fuel cell applications. The reforming process aims to generate hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and water (H2O).

6. The addition of a second metal to the nickel catalyst, such as platinum or palladium, or the substitution of nickel with more sulfur-resistant noble metals, can improve the catalyst's resistance to sulfur in commercial fuels, thereby enhancing its performance and efficiency.

7. The formation of an alloy between rhodium and platinum on the catalyst surface leads to synergistic effects that enhance the catalytic activity and stability of the bimetallic catalysts, making them superior to monometallic catalysts in terms of selectivity and stability against carbon deposition.

8. The conversion of oxygen in the reforming process is complete across the entire temperature range tested (400-900°C) for oxidation reactions, while on the support, the consumption of oxygen increases with temperature, reaching complete conversion at 850°C.

9. The stability of rhodium-platinum catalysts calcined at 700 or 900°C was studied at 700°C for 5 or 6 hours, respectively. The hydrogen production for catalysts calcined at 700°C is presented in Figure 7.

10. On monometallic rhodium catalysts, the carbon deposition rate (0.37-0.54 mg/gcat/h) is lower than on platinum, in line with findings from Cavallaro et al., suggesting that only minor amounts of whisker carbon form, which easily reacts with oxygen to regenerate the surface.

11. On platinum-containing catalysts, significant sintering was observed during aging in autothermal reforming, which contradicts the high activity and stability observed in bimetallic 2RhPt catalysts. Platinum is more prone to sintering due to its lower melting point and migration sensitivity compared to rhodium.

12. Platinum's sensitivity to sintering makes it more susceptible to degradation at high temperatures, which can lead to loss of activity and stability. Rhodium, on the other hand, shows greater resistance to sintering, contributing to its superior performance in catalytic processes.

1. 选择性氧剂重整为减少大气中尤其是二氧化碳（CO2）的温室气体排放提供了一种适宜的能源生产和化学生产替代方案。其主要优势包括燃料来源的灵活性、清洁燃烧以及潜在的长期存储原始燃料的可能性。它还能降低高碳氢化合物（如汽油和柴油）中的碳沉积风险，提高重整选择性和稳定性。

2. 常见的镍基催化剂对商业燃料中的硫非常敏感，这限制了它们的使用。然而，通过在镍催化剂中添加第二种金属，如铂或钯，或者用更抗硫的贵金属替换镍，可以克服这一限制，从而提高催化剂的性能。

3. 铑-铂（RhPt）双金属催化剂在性能上优于单金属催化剂，表明了这两种金属之间存在协同作用。这种协同作用导致合金的形成，进而提高了催化活性和对抗碳沉积的稳定性。

4. 在模拟汽油的自热重整过程中，所有贵金属催化剂在测试的温度范围（400-900°C）内均表现出完全的氧化反应活性，而支持材料上的氧消耗随温度增加，完全转化在850°C达到。

5. 研究重点是使用氧化锆支持的铑-铂催化剂进行模拟汽油的自热重整，以产生适用于固态氧化物燃料电池应用的燃料气体（H2、CO、CO2、CH4和H2O）。该重整过程旨在生成氢气（H2）、一氧化碳（CO）、二氧化碳（CO2）、甲烷（CH4）和水（H2O）。

6. 将第二金属添加到镍催化剂中，如铂或钯，或者用更抗硫的贵金属替换镍，可以提高催化剂对商业燃料中硫的抵抗力，从而增强其性能和效率。

7. 铑和铂在催化剂表面形成的合金导致了增强的催化活性和稳定性，使双金属催化剂在对抗碳沉积方面优于单金属催化剂，在选择性和稳定性方面表现出优越性能。

8. 在整个测试温度范围（400-900°C）内，氧气在氧化反应中的转化是完全的，而在支持材料上，随温度增加的氧消耗达到了850°C的完全转化。

9. 对于700°C下分别加热至700°C或900°C的催化剂，研究了700°C下5或6小时的催化剂稳定性。对于700°C加热的催化剂，图7显示了氢生产的数据。

10. 对于单金属铑催化剂，碳沉积速率（0.37-0.54 mg/gcat/h）低于铂，与Cavallaro等人报告的结果一致，表明仅形成少量的针状碳，易于与氧气反应再生表面。

11. 含有铂的催化剂在自热重整过程中出现了显著的烧结现象，这与在双金属2RhPt催化剂中观察到的高活性和稳定性完全不一致。由于铂熔点较低且迁移敏感，铂更容易发生烧结。

12. 铂对烧结的敏感性使其在高温下更容易退化，导致活性和稳定性丧失。相比之下，铑显示出更强的耐烧结性，有助于其在催化过程中的优异表现。
