          "[1] For energy production, substitution of fossil fuels by H2 is a suitable option for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, in particular CO2.
          [2] The major advantages of using H2 or H2-rich mixtures, i.e. syngas, as fuel include the diversity of primary fuels (natural gas, biomass, crude oil) that can be used in H2 production, its clean combustion and the possibility of long-term storage of the primary fuel.
          [3] The growing interest in fuel cell technologies in heat and power production and as replacements for internal combustion engines increases the demand for H2 production.
          [4] The development of an economy based on H2 requires major structural changes that could take several decades.
          [5] Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers several key advantages in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation. It enables higher efficiency in converting hydrocarbons to hydrogen-rich products, reduces the need for fossil fuel inputs, and minimizes emissions. This makes it a more sustainable and cleaner alternative for energy and chemical production."
