[1] "The catalytic behavior of a supported metal is influenced by the size of the metal particles and by their interactions with the support and other catalyst components such as a second catalytic metal, which could be a promoter."
[2] "Advantages of precise synthesis with organometallic precursors (smallness and uniformity of the supported clusters with bonds between the two metals) are offset by the expensive preparations and difficulty of catalyst regeneration."
[3] "Applications of supported bimetallic clusters are most likely in specialty chemicals production or with stable combinations of oxophilic and noble metals."

1. The size of metal particles and their interactions with the support and other catalyst components, such as a second metal, significantly influence the catalytic behavior of supported metals. This can impact the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic reactions.

2. The use of precise synthesis with organometallic precursors allows for the creation of small, uniform bimetallic clusters with bonds between the two metals. However, this method comes with high costs due to the complexity of the preparation process and the difficulty in regenerating the catalyst after it becomes deactivated.

3. Bimetallic clusters have the most potential for application in specialized chemical production processes, particularly when combined with stable combinations of oxophilic and noble metals. These types of clusters can offer unique catalytic properties that are advantageous in certain industrial processes.

1. 支持金属的催化行为受到金属颗粒尺寸及其与支持物和其他催化剂组件（如辅助催化剂金属）之间相互作用的影响。这可以影响催化反应的效率和选择性。

2. 使用有机金属前体进行精确合成允许创建尺寸较小、均匀的双金属簇，其中两种金属之间存在键合。然而，这种方法的成本很高，因为准备过程复杂，并且在催化剂活性丧失后再生催化剂的难度大。

3. 双金属簇在特定化学生产过程中的应用具有最大潜力，尤其是当结合亲氧金属和贵金属时。这些类型的簇可以提供独特的催化性质，在某些工业过程中具有优势。
