[1] "The catalytic behavior of a supported metal is influenced by the size of the metal particles and by their interactions with the support and other catalyst components such as a second catalytic metal, which could be a promoter. The second metal may influence the first metal through electronic interactions or be involved in the reaction by bonding directly to reactants or intermediates. Often, the interactions between the two metals are complex and largely unknown, and consequently there are excellent opportunities for preparing bimetallic catalysts with new properties."

[2] "Selective oxygenate reforming can lead to sustainable energy and chemical production by improving the efficiency of converting feedstocks into valuable products, reducing the environmental impact, and minimizing waste generation. Key advantages include higher product yields, lower energy consumption, and the potential for producing high-value chemicals with fewer side reactions. This process can also facilitate the circular economy by enabling the recycling and reusing of materials."
