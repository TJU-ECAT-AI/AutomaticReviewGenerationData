[1] "The catalytic behavior of a supported metal is influenced by the size of the metal particles and by their interactions with the support and other catalyst components such as a second catalytic metal, which could be a promoter. The second metal may influence the first metal through electronic interactions or be involved in the reaction by bonding directly to reactants or intermediates. Often, the interactions between the two metals are complex and largely unknown, and consequently there are excellent opportunities for preparing bimetallic catalysts with new properties."

[2] "The catalytic properties distinguishing supported bimetallic clusters from monometallics include high selectivities for oxygenates in CO hydrogenation and different selectivities for CO vs CC bond hydrogenation."

[3] "Advantages of precise synthesis with organometallic precursors (smallness and uniformity of the supported clusters with bonds between the two metals) are offset by the expensive preparations and difficulty of catalyst regeneration."

[4] "Applications of supported bimetallic clusters are most likely in specialty chemicals production or with stable combinations of oxophilic and noble metals."

1. The size of metal particles and their interactions with the support and other catalyst components, particularly through electronic interactions with a second metal, influence the catalytic behavior of supported metals. This complexity offers opportunities to develop bimetallic catalysts with novel properties.

2. Supported bimetallic clusters exhibit distinct catalytic properties compared to monometallic catalysts, notably high selectivity in oxygenate formation during CO hydrogenation and differential selectivity for CO versus CC bond hydrogenation.

3. The precision of synthesis using organometallic precursors, which results in small, uniform supported clusters with intermetallic bonds, is advantageous. However, this comes with the challenges of costly preparation and difficulties in catalyst regeneration.

4. The most probable applications of supported bimetallic clusters are in specialized chemical production processes, particularly those involving stable combinations of oxophilic and noble metals.
