[1] "Several processes are available to convert oxygenates to H2, including steam reforming, autothermal reforming and aqueous phase reforming."
[2] "Steam reforming requires an external heat source, operating at temperatures of 500900 C."
[3] "Methanol steam reforming is carried out differently compared to other oxygenates, as the lack of a CC bond allows operation with good reforming selectivity at much lower temperatures, approximately 300500 C, utilizing Cu or Pd-based catalysts with ZnO or CeO2 promoters."
[4] "Autothermal reforming combines the decomposition of oxygenates to produce H2 with the exothermic partial oxidation of some of the feed to drive the endothermic reforming."
[5] "Aqueous phase reforming operates in the liquid phase to produce mainly CO2 and H2, eliminating the need to vaporize water and the reactant, and allowing the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed."
[6] "Literature studies show that Pt and Ni catalysts exhibit high reforming activity, while reforming selectivity is highest on Pt and Pd, with decreased selectivity on Ni due to methane production."
[7] "The focus of the current paper is on the reforming of oxygenates at low temperatures, most applicable to the aqueous phase reforming process for which Pt-based catalysts have shown promise."
[8] "The reforming yield obtained from TPD for ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol display an increasing trend as the surface d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level."
[9] "The stability of the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface has been studied experimentally and computationally. Pt-Ni-Pt(111) is the thermodynamically stable configuration in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen."
[10] "In the presence of strongly bonded adsorbates, such as atomic O, subsurface Ni atoms segregate to the surface, forming the desired Ni-Pt-Pt(111) structure with an activation barrier of 15 kcal/mol."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by converting oxygenates, which can be generated from renewable biomass, into hydrogen. This method offers advantages over traditional methods in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation. Compared to steam reforming, which requires high temperatures and an external heat source, aqueous phase reforming operates at lower temperatures, reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Additionally, selective reforming processes often utilize Pt-based catalysts, which demonstrate high activity and selectivity, minimizing the production of methane and other undesirable byproducts.

2. The process of selective oxygenate reforming provides a sustainable alternative for hydrogen production by utilizing renewable biomass-derived feedstocks. This reduces net CO2 emissions compared to traditional methods that rely on fossil fuels. Furthermore, the use of aqueous phase reforming eliminates the need for water vaporization, making the process more efficient and environmentally friendly. The selectivity of the reforming reactions ensures the production of hydrogen with minimal side products, enhancing the overall efficiency of the hydrogen production process.

3. The key advantages of selective oxygenate reforming over traditional methods include lower operating temperatures, reduced energy consumption, minimized CO2 emissions, and high product selectivity. These factors contribute to the sustainability and economic viability of hydrogen production for use in fuel cells and other applications. By leveraging renewable resources and efficient catalysts, selective oxygenate reforming offers a promising avenue for sustainable energy and chemical production.
