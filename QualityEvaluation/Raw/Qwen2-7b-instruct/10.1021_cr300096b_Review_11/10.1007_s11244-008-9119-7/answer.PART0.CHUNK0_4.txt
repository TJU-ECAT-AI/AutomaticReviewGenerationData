[1] "A variety of oxygenates can be generated from renewable biomass, and the use of biomass-derived feedstocks can result in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization."
[2] "The high operating temperature favors CO production, and a second water-gas shift reactor operating at lower temperature is needed to reduce the CO concentration in the exit stream."
[3] "Several processes are available to convert oxygenates to H2, including steam reforming, autothermal reforming and aqueous phase reforming."
[4] "Aqueous phase reforming operates in the liquid phase to produce mainly CO2 and H2, eliminating the need to vaporize water and the reactant, and allowing the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed."
[5] "The focus of the current paper is on the reforming of oxygenates at low temperatures, most applicable to the aqueous phase reforming process for which Pt-based catalysts have shown promise."
[6] "In general, the oxygenate reforming yield displayed a somewhat linear correlation, and increased as the surface d-band center shifted closer to the Fermi level."
[7] "For ethanol and ethylene glycol the reforming selectivity remained high on all the surfaces (>80%), with a slight decreasing trend as the surface d-band center shifted closer to the Fermi level."
[8] "This was most likely because on Fe-Pt-Pt(111) and Ti-Pt-Pt(111) the oxygenates bonded very strongly, increasing the possibility of reacting through CO bond cleavage."
[9] "The thermodynamic potential for segregation with a coverage of 0.5 ML atomic O. For all the 3d/Pt(111) surfaces, the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surface is the preferred configuration under these conditions."
[10] "The activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Ni to the surface in oxygen was 15 kcal/mol, compared to 7 kcal/mol for Co [39]."

1. Oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing renewable biomass feedstocks, resulting in lower CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels. It allows for efficient hydrogen generation, which can be used for fuel cells. 
2. Key advantages include:
   a. Product yield optimization through selective reforming processes.
   b. Reduced environmental impact due to lower CO2 emissions from biomass feedstock use.
   c. Practical implementation is facilitated by the development of effective catalysts like Pt-based surfaces, especially for aqueous phase reforming at low temperatures.
3. The reforming process shows a positive correlation between surface d-band center proximity to the Fermi level and oxygenate reforming yield. 
4. Ethanol and ethylene glycol reforming maintain high selectivity across various surfaces, albeit with slight decreases as the surface d-band center approaches the Fermi level.
5. Stronger bonding of oxygenates on certain surfaces (Fe-Pt-Pt(111) and Ti-Pt-Pt(111)) increases the risk of CO bond cleavage, affecting reforming selectivity.
6. The thermodynamic potential indicates the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) configuration is preferred for oxygenates in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, supporting the stability of this surface structure.
7. Activation barriers for segregating subsurface 3d metals to the surface range from 7 to 15 kcal/mol, depending on the metal involved, influencing the stability of the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) structure.
