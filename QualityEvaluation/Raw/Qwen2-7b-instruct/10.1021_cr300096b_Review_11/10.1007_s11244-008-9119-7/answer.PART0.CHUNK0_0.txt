[1] "Several processes are available to convert oxygenates to H2, including steam reforming, autothermal reforming and aqueous phase reforming."
[2] "Steam reforming [110] is an endothermic process requiring an external heat source, operating at temperatures of 500900 C. Typical catalysts used in steam reforming include Ni, Rh, Ru, and Pt."
[3] "Methanol steam reforming is carried out differently compared to other oxygenates, as the lack of a CC bond allows operation with good reforming selectivity at much lower temperatures, approximately 300500 C, utilizing Cu or Pd-based catalysts with ZnO or CeO2 promoters [2, 11]."
[4] "Autothermal reforming [10, 1215] combines the decomposition of oxygenates to produce H2 with the exothermic partial oxidation of some of the feed to drive the endothermic reforming."
[5] "Aqueous phase reforming [1624] operates in the liquid phase to produce mainly CO2 and H2, eliminating the need to vaporize water and the reactant, and allowing the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed."
[6] "Literature studies [18] show that Pt and Ni catalysts exhibit high reforming activity, while reforming selectivity is highest on Pt and Pd, with decreased selectivity on Ni due to methane production."
[7] "The focus of the current paper is on the reforming of oxygenates at low temperatures, most applicable to the aqueous phase reforming process for which Pt-based catalysts have shown promise [16, 18]."
[8] "We are interested in monolayer bimetallic surfaces that ideally contain only either Pt or 3d atoms in the first layer."
[9] "The Pt-3d-Pt(111) and 3d-Pt-Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces display unique chemical properties that are very different from each other, and in general are not simply a mixture of the properties of the parent Pt(111) and 3d(111) surfaces."
[10] "Comparing the reforming yield on each of the surfaces, the trend was glycerol > ethylene glycol > ethanol."
[11] "Examining the selectivity on other 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces (data not shown), ethylene glycol displayed high reforming selectivity on all the surfaces."
[12] "For reforming reactions, the surface 3d-Pt-Pt(111) configuration showed increased activity while the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structure showed reduced activity in comparison to pure Pt(111)."

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling the conversion of oxygenates derived from renewable biomass into hydrogen, which can be utilized in fuel cells. This method offers several advantages over traditional methods in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation:

   - **Product Yield**: Oxygenate reforming at low temperatures, particularly in the aqueous phase, allows for efficient hydrogen production. This is advantageous as it requires less energy input compared to steam reforming, which typically operates at higher temperatures.

   - **Environmental Impact**: The use of biomass-derived feedstocks for oxygenate reforming results in lower net CO2 emissions compared to the utilization of fossil fuels. This aligns with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable energy solutions.

   - **Practical Implementation**: The aqueous phase reforming process eliminates the need for vaporizing water and reactants, simplifying the process and potentially reducing the energy costs associated with these steps. Additionally, the ability to use nonvolatile oxygenates as feedstock broadens the range of materials that can be used for hydrogen production.

2. The key advantages of selective oxygenate reforming over traditional methods are primarily related to product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation:

   - **Enhanced Efficiency**: Reforming at lower temperatures reduces the energy requirements for the process, making it more efficient compared to traditional steam reforming methods.
   
   - **Lower Emissions**: Utilizing biomass-derived feedstocks minimizes CO2 emissions, contributing to a reduction in the environmental footprint of hydrogen production.
   
   - **Simplified Process**: The aqueous phase reforming process avoids the need for vaporization, simplifying the operational aspects of the process and potentially lowering the capital and operational costs associated with hydrogen production infrastructure.
