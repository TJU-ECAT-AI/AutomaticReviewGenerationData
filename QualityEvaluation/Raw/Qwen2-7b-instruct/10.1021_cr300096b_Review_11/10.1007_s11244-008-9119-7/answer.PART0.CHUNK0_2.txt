[1] "A variety of oxygenates can be generated from renewable biomass, and the use of biomass-derived feedstocks can result in lower net CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels utilization."
[2] "Several processes are available to convert oxygenates to H2, including steam reforming, autothermal reforming and aqueous phase reforming."
[3] "Steam reforming is an endothermic process requiring an external heat source, operating at temperatures of 500900 C."
[4] "Autothermal reforming combines the decomposition of oxygenates to produce H2 with the exothermic partial oxidation of some of the feed to drive the endothermic reforming."
[5] "Aqueous phase reforming operates in the liquid phase to produce mainly CO2 and H2, eliminating the need to vaporize water and the reactant, and allowing the use of nonvolatile oxygenates as feed."
[6] "The process operates at 200250 C, much lower than either steam reforming or autothermal reforming, producing H2 with low CO concentrations."
[7] "Literature studies show that Pt and Ni catalysts exhibit high reforming activity, while reforming selectivity is highest on Pt and Pd, with decreased selectivity on Ni due to methane production."
[8] "Addition of Sn to Ni leads to a decrease in the production of methane."
[9] "The 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic systems have been studied extensively due to their novel catalytic properties."
[10] "In the current paper, we provide an overview of our recent work on the general trends in the reactivity of oxygenates on various 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."
[11] "The reforming yield obtained from TPD for ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol display an increasing trend as the surface d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing renewable biomass feedstocks, reducing CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels. It offers lower operational temperatures, making it more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.

2. Key advantages of selective oxygenate reforming over traditional methods include:
   - Higher product yield, particularly H2, with lower CO concentrations.
   - Lower net CO2 emissions due to the use of biomass-derived feedstocks.
   - Lower operational temperatures, reducing energy consumption and costs.
   - Enhanced selectivity towards desired products, minimizing byproduct formation.

3. The 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces demonstrate enhanced catalytic properties for oxygenate reforming, with improved reactivity and selectivity compared to monometallic surfaces. The surface d-band center plays a critical role in determining the reforming yield and selectivity, with a trend of increasing activity as the center shifts closer to the Fermi level.
