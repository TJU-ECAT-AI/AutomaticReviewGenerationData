1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing renewable biomass feedstocks, which can lead to lower net CO2 emissions compared to traditional fossil fuel utilization. This process allows for the conversion of oxygenates into hydrogen, a cleaner energy carrier, potentially reducing environmental impacts.

2. Autothermal reforming combines the decomposition of oxygenates to produce hydrogen with the exothermic partial oxidation of feedstock, driving the endothermic reforming process. This integration can enhance efficiency and reduce energy requirements.

3. The reforming yield, a measure of the number of oxygenate molecules reacting via the reforming pathway, helps quantify the effectiveness of the process.

4. The binding energies of oxygenates on various surfaces increase as the surface d-band center approaches the Fermi level, indicating a stronger interaction between the oxygenate and the surface.

5. The surface monolayer 3d-Pt-Pt(111) structure shows higher reforming activity than other surface configurations, such as Pt(111), Pt-3d-Pt(111), and 3d(111) film surfaces.

6. In the presence of strongly bonded adsorbates, such as atomic oxygen, subsurface Ni atoms can segregate to the surface, forming the desired Ni-Pt-Pt(111) structure. This process occurs with an activation barrier of 15 kcal/mol, highlighting the importance of surface configuration stability for maintaining enhanced chemical properties.
