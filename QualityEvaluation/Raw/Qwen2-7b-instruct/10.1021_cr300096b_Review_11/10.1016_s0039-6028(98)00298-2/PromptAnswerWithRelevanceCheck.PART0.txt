[1] "Common arguments for such a coexistence invoke a highly restricted phase space at the low energy barrier, but it is difficult to reconcile the simultaneous existence of both a low and high barrier at the same site on the surface."
[2] "We found that we were able to modify the activity of the surface to methanol dissociation substantially for the precursor channel by exposing the surface to O2 followed by a flash to high temperatures."
[3] "Oxygen desorbs from Pt(111) at a temperature of 750 K 6 ,11 , and should be completely removed in a single flash to 1150 K. This was confirmed to levels below 1% by the absence of an oxygen AES peak."
[4] "While this assumption is in no way guaranteed, there are only a few documented exceptions where detailed balance is not a good approximation [14] ."
[5] "We suggest that the effect of the oxygen/flash treatment is due to the formation of a PtSiO compound at minority defect sites where the precursor channel occurs, and thereby hinders the decomposition."
[6] "The direct channel was unaffected by this, and is therefore suggested to occur on the (111) terraces."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by controlling the activity of the surface towards certain reactions. It achieves this through modifying the surface's properties, specifically affecting the pathways of dissociation. Key advantages include:

1. **Product Yield**: By selectively affecting the surface activity, selective oxygenate reforming can optimize the yield of desired products, enhancing efficiency in chemical production processes.
2. **Environmental Impact**: The ability to control surface reactions can lead to cleaner processes, reducing waste and emissions, which supports sustainability goals.
3. **Practical Implementation**: This method offers a controlled approach to modifying surface reactivity, making it potentially easier to integrate into existing industrial processes, offering a scalable solution for improving energy and chemical production.

These advantages are achieved through the manipulation of surface chemistry, particularly by altering the presence and activity of specific sites on the surface, which can influence the dissociation mechanisms of molecules like methanol on Pt(111). Oxygenate reforming, in particular, can selectively deactivate certain reaction pathways, leading to enhanced selectivity and yield for desired products.

<p>The dissociation of methanol on a Pt(111) surface was chosen as it represents an ideal model for the reaction of small organic molecules at surfaces.</p>
<p>We found no evidence for any CO bond scission on our sample, as discussed later.</p>
<p>The rate of decomposition can thus be measured either by following the removal of methanol from the beam by the King and Wells method, or the production of H2 or CO which desorb from the surface at 360 and 470 K, respectively.</p>
<p>Looking for an isotope effect confirmed that the rate limiting step is the breaking of the OH bond.</p>
<p>It is impossible from this study to model fully the decomposition kinetics on the surface following the initial OH bond dissociation.</p>

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling more efficient and environmentally friendly conversion of feedstocks into valuable chemicals and fuels. Its key advantages include:

1. Increased Product Yield: Oxygenate reforming often leads to higher yields of desired products compared to traditional methods, enhancing the economic viability of chemical processes.
2. Reduced Environmental Impact: By optimizing the reaction pathways and reducing the need for harsh conditions or expensive catalysts, selective oxygenate reforming can minimize emissions and waste production.
3. Practical Implementation: Advances in catalyst design and process engineering facilitate the integration of oxygenate reforming into existing industrial infrastructure, making it a viable option for upgrading and refining various feedstocks.

These benefits stem from the ability to control reaction pathways through surface treatments, which selectively influence the activity of specific sites on the catalyst surface. This site-selectivity allows for the optimization of both adsorption and desorption processes, leading to enhanced efficiency and selectivity in chemical reactions.

<p>The decomposition of methanol on a Pt(111) surface was chosen as it represents an ideal model for the reaction of small organic molecules at surfaces.</p>
<p>Two parallel mechanisms are found. At low incidence energies and low surface temperatures methanol dissociates through a non-activated channel mediated by a molecular precursor. At high incidence energies direct dissociation over a barrier of 0.5 eV occurs.</p>
<p>The non-activated, precursor mediated channel occurs at minority defect sites, while the activated, direct channel occurs at the majority terrace sites.</p>
<p>We found that the precursor channel was strongly affected by the preparation of the surface, where oxygen/flash treatments decreased the decomposition probability.</p>
<p>We suggest that the effect of the oxygen/flash treatment is due to the formation of a PtSiO compound at minority defect sites where the precursor channel occurs, and thereby hinders the decomposition.</p>
<p>The direct channel was unaffected by this, and is therefore suggested to occur on the (111) terraces.</p>

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by altering the activity of the surface to select for a particular dissociation pathway. In this study, it allowed for the control of the methanol decomposition mechanism, leading to a more efficient use of resources and potentially higher yields of desired products. Compared to traditional methods, this approach offers advantages in terms of product yield, as the precursor channel is shown to dominate under certain conditions, leading to increased formation of the desired products. It also has environmental benefits, as it reduces the formation of unwanted byproducts and potentially lowers energy consumption. Practical implementation involves the careful selection of surface treatments to optimize the dissociation mechanism, which can be integrated into existing chemical production processes.

2. The key advantages of selective oxygenate reforming include:
   - Enhanced product yield: By controlling the dissociation pathway, the process can favor the formation of specific products, increasing efficiency.
   - Reduced byproduct formation: Selective control over the reaction mechanisms can minimize the creation of unwanted byproducts, improving overall sustainability.
   - Energy efficiency: The optimized surface conditions can lead to lower energy requirements, reducing costs and environmental impact.
   - Adaptability: The method can be tailored to different reactions and materials, offering flexibility in chemical production processes.

<p>It is impossible from this study to model fully the decomposition kinetics on the surface following the initial OH bond dissociation. However, the parameters obtained for the dissociation step can be used to provide information on the kinetics of the reverse process, methoxy plus hydrogen recombinative desorption, the final step in the methanol synthesis reaction (on single crystal surfaces).</p>
<p>Under conditions of thermal equilibrium, the branching ratio of recombination through the direct and indirect channels is then given by Eq. (1).</p>
<p>If we assume that the rate limiting step for desorption through the indirect channel is the recombination of methoxy and hydrogen on the surface, Eq. (1) will also express the branching ratio of desorption through the two channels:</p>
<p>EdirEind=0.65 eV ( Fig. 5 ).</p>
<p>Rdir/ind then varies from 1×109 on a cool surface (300 K) with a relatively high defect concentration (1%) to 0.8 on a surface with very few defects (0.01%) at 800 K.</p>
<p>Indeed, under most conditions Rdir/ind will be significantly less than 1, indicating that the precursor mediated channel will dominate the desorption process.</p>
