<p>The dissociation of methanol on a Pt(111) surface was chosen as it represents an ideal model for the reaction of small organic molecules at surfaces.</p>
<p>We found no evidence for any CO bond scission on our sample, as discussed later.</p>
<p>The rate of decomposition can thus be measured either by following the removal of methanol from the beam by the King and Wells method, or the production of H2 or CO which desorb from the surface at 360 and 470 K, respectively.</p>
<p>Looking for an isotope effect confirmed that the rate limiting step is the breaking of the OH bond.</p>
<p>It is impossible from this study to model fully the decomposition kinetics on the surface following the initial OH bond dissociation.</p>

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling more efficient and environmentally friendly conversion of feedstocks into valuable chemicals and fuels. Its key advantages include:

1. Increased Product Yield: Oxygenate reforming often leads to higher yields of desired products compared to traditional methods, enhancing the economic viability of chemical processes.
2. Reduced Environmental Impact: By optimizing the reaction pathways and reducing the need for harsh conditions or expensive catalysts, selective oxygenate reforming can minimize emissions and waste production.
3. Practical Implementation: Advances in catalyst design and process engineering facilitate the integration of oxygenate reforming into existing industrial infrastructure, making it a viable option for upgrading and refining various feedstocks.

These benefits stem from the ability to control reaction pathways through surface treatments, which selectively influence the activity of specific sites on the catalyst surface. This site-selectivity allows for the optimization of both adsorption and desorption processes, leading to enhanced efficiency and selectivity in chemical reactions.
