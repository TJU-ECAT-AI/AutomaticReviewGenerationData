[1] "Common arguments for such a coexistence invoke a highly restricted phase space at the low energy barrier, but it is difficult to reconcile the simultaneous existence of both a low and high barrier at the same site on the surface."
[2] "We found that we were able to modify the activity of the surface to methanol dissociation substantially for the precursor channel by exposing the surface to O2 followed by a flash to high temperatures."
[3] "Oxygen desorbs from Pt(111) at a temperature of 750 K 6 ,11 , and should be completely removed in a single flash to 1150 K. This was confirmed to levels below 1% by the absence of an oxygen AES peak."
[4] "While this assumption is in no way guaranteed, there are only a few documented exceptions where detailed balance is not a good approximation [14] ."
[5] "We suggest that the effect of the oxygen/flash treatment is due to the formation of a PtSiO compound at minority defect sites where the precursor channel occurs, and thereby hinders the decomposition."
[6] "The direct channel was unaffected by this, and is therefore suggested to occur on the (111) terraces."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by controlling the activity of the surface towards certain reactions. It achieves this through modifying the surface's properties, specifically affecting the pathways of dissociation. Key advantages include:

1. **Product Yield**: By selectively affecting the surface activity, selective oxygenate reforming can optimize the yield of desired products, enhancing efficiency in chemical production processes.
2. **Environmental Impact**: The ability to control surface reactions can lead to cleaner processes, reducing waste and emissions, which supports sustainability goals.
3. **Practical Implementation**: This method offers a controlled approach to modifying surface reactivity, making it potentially easier to integrate into existing industrial processes, offering a scalable solution for improving energy and chemical production.

These advantages are achieved through the manipulation of surface chemistry, particularly by altering the presence and activity of specific sites on the surface, which can influence the dissociation mechanisms of molecules like methanol on Pt(111). Oxygenate reforming, in particular, can selectively deactivate certain reaction pathways, leading to enhanced selectivity and yield for desired products.
