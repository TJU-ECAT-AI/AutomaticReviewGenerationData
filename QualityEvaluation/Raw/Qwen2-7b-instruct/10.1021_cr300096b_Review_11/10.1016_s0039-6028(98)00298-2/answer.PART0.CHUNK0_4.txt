<p>It is impossible from this study to model fully the decomposition kinetics on the surface following the initial OH bond dissociation. However, the parameters obtained for the dissociation step can be used to provide information on the kinetics of the reverse process, methoxy plus hydrogen recombinative desorption, the final step in the methanol synthesis reaction (on single crystal surfaces).</p>
<p>Under conditions of thermal equilibrium, the branching ratio of recombination through the direct and indirect channels is then given by Eq. (1).</p>
<p>If we assume that the rate limiting step for desorption through the indirect channel is the recombination of methoxy and hydrogen on the surface, Eq. (1) will also express the branching ratio of desorption through the two channels:</p>
<p>EdirEind=0.65 eV ( Fig. 5 ).</p>
<p>Rdir/ind then varies from 1×109 on a cool surface (300 K) with a relatively high defect concentration (1%) to 0.8 on a surface with very few defects (0.01%) at 800 K.</p>
<p>Indeed, under most conditions Rdir/ind will be significantly less than 1, indicating that the precursor mediated channel will dominate the desorption process.</p>

The selective oxygenate reforming process contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by influencing the dissociation pathways of molecules on the surface of catalysts. This technique allows for the control of the surface properties, which affects the reaction rates and product yields. Its key advantages include:

1. Enhanced Product Yield: By selectively modifying the surface, the process can favor the desired reaction pathways, leading to higher yields of target products.
2. Reduced Environmental Impact: Tailoring the surface properties can minimize the formation of byproducts, reducing the overall environmental footprint of the production process.
3. Improved Practical Implementation: Controlling the surface defects enables the optimization of catalyst performance, leading to more efficient and cost-effective processes.

These advantages demonstrate the potential of selective oxygenate reforming in enhancing sustainability and efficiency in energy and chemical production industries.
