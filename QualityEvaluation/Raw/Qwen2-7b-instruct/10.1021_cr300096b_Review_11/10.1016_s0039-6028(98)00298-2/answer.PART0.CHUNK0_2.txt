<p>The decomposition of methanol on a Pt(111) surface was chosen as it represents an ideal model for the reaction of small organic molecules at surfaces.</p>
<p>Two parallel mechanisms are found. At low incidence energies and low surface temperatures methanol dissociates through a non-activated channel mediated by a molecular precursor. At high incidence energies direct dissociation over a barrier of 0.5 eV occurs.</p>
<p>The non-activated, precursor mediated channel occurs at minority defect sites, while the activated, direct channel occurs at the majority terrace sites.</p>
<p>We found that the precursor channel was strongly affected by the preparation of the surface, where oxygen/flash treatments decreased the decomposition probability.</p>
<p>We suggest that the effect of the oxygen/flash treatment is due to the formation of a PtSiO compound at minority defect sites where the precursor channel occurs, and thereby hinders the decomposition.</p>
<p>The direct channel was unaffected by this, and is therefore suggested to occur on the (111) terraces.</p>

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by altering the activity of the surface to select for a particular dissociation pathway. In this study, it allowed for the control of the methanol decomposition mechanism, leading to a more efficient use of resources and potentially higher yields of desired products. Compared to traditional methods, this approach offers advantages in terms of product yield, as the precursor channel is shown to dominate under certain conditions, leading to increased formation of the desired products. It also has environmental benefits, as it reduces the formation of unwanted byproducts and potentially lowers energy consumption. Practical implementation involves the careful selection of surface treatments to optimize the dissociation mechanism, which can be integrated into existing chemical production processes.

2. The key advantages of selective oxygenate reforming include:
   - Enhanced product yield: By controlling the dissociation pathway, the process can favor the formation of specific products, increasing efficiency.
   - Reduced byproduct formation: Selective control over the reaction mechanisms can minimize the creation of unwanted byproducts, improving overall sustainability.
   - Energy efficiency: The optimized surface conditions can lead to lower energy requirements, reducing costs and environmental impact.
   - Adaptability: The method can be tailored to different reactions and materials, offering flexibility in chemical production processes.
