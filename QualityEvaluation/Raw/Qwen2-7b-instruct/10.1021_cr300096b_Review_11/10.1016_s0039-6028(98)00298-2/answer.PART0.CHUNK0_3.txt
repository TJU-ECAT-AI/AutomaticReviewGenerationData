[1] "Common arguments for such a coexistence invoke a highly restricted phase space at the low energy barrier, but it is difficult to reconcile the simultaneous existence of both a low and high barrier at the same site on the surface."
[2] "Oxygen desorbs from Pt(111) at a temperature of 750 K 6 ,11 , and should be completely removed in a single flash to 1150 K. This was confirmed to levels below 1% by the absence of an oxygen AES peak."
[3] "We suggest that the effect of the oxygen/flash treatment is due to the formation of a PtSiO compound at minority defect sites where the precursor channel occurs, and thereby hinders the decomposition."
