[1] "Increasing concerns about the environmental impact of vehicles with gasoline powered combustion engines have increased efforts to find technologies to reduce emissions and reduce fossil fuel consumption."
[2] "Ethanol has a lower vapor pressure relative to gasoline and therefore ethanol/gasoline blends such as E85 (85% ethanol) or E15 (15% ethanol) are more likely to be available then 100% ethanol within the current infrastructure."
[3] "In Section 3.2 aging tests at process conditions with sulfur and regeneration it was shown that air treatment could regenerate the catalyst after various levels of deactivation."
[4] "Therefore the catalyst exhibited initial activity levels with no sign of deactivation through 28 h steam reforming the E85 with 28 ppm sulfur, whereas the catalyst was able to sustain initial performance for less than 14 h without air treatments."
[5] "It is possible that the air treatment is unable to fully reverse the effects of coking and sulfur."

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by reducing emissions and fossil fuel consumption, especially when used in vehicles powered by gasoline. Ethanol/gasoline blends like E85 offer a viable alternative within existing infrastructure compared to pure ethanol.

2. Air treatment is effective in regenerating the catalyst after various levels of deactivation, enabling the catalyst to maintain initial activity levels. Without periodic air treatments, the catalyst might lose performance significantly faster.

3. The regeneration process via air treatment might not fully reverse the effects of coking and sulfur poisoning. This could lead to irreversible changes in the catalyst's performance, affecting its long-term stability and efficiency.

1. 选择性氧化物重整过程通过减少排放和化石燃料消耗，为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献，尤其是在汽油动力车辆中。乙醇/汽油混合物如E85在现有的基础设施中比纯乙醇更有可能被使用。

2. 空气处理可以在各种程度的失活后再生催化剂，使催化剂能够保持初始活动水平。没有定期的空气处理，催化剂可能会更快地失去性能。

3. 通过空气处理的再生过程可能无法完全逆转焦化和硫中毒的影响。这可能导致催化剂性能的不可逆变化，影响其长期稳定性和效率。
