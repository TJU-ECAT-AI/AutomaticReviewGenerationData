[1] "Increasing concerns about the environmental impact of vehicles with gasoline powered combustion engines have increased efforts to find technologies to reduce emissions and reduce fossil fuel consumption."
[2] "Ethanol has a lower vapor pressure relative to gasoline and therefore ethanol/gasoline blends such as E85 (85% ethanol) or E15 (15% ethanol) are more likely to be available then 100% ethanol within the current infrastructure."
[3] "The steam reforming of 85% pure ethanol, 15% gasoline (E85) with and without sulfur was studied over a bimetallic precious metal (Rh/Pt) catalyst deposited on a ceramic monolith."
[4] "Tests performed at low space velocities (22,000 h1) confirmed that the catalyst could achieve 100% ethanol and gasoline conversion to equilibrium concentrations of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 with no signs of deactivation for at least 110 h reforming a sulfur-free E85 fuel."
[5] "In the presence of 5 ppm sulfur the catalyst maintained 100% ethanol and 100% gasoline conversion for approximately 22 h before rapid deactivation resulted in ethanol conversion values below 21%."
[6] "Sulfur is a known catalyst poison and typically has a detrimental effect on catalyst stability."
[7] "It has been found that the presence of higher hydrocarbons in a fuel, specifically aromatics, increase deactivation due to carbon deposition."
[8] "In this paper deactivation, regeneration and stability of a Rh/Pt catalyst on a zirconia containing carrier is studied for the steam reforming of ethanol/gasoline blends at an energy efficient condition with steam/fuel ratio's slightly higher than stoichiometric (steam/carbon = 1.8) and with temperatures at or near 650 C."

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling the conversion of renewable resources, such as ethanol, into hydrogen for fuel cells or hydrogen-powered engines. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and practical implementation through existing fuel infrastructure, especially with ethanol/gasoline blends like E85 or E15.

2. The main focus of the study is on understanding the catalyst deactivation mechanisms and developing processes for reforming ethanol/gasoline blends at less energy-intensive conditions. This involves examining the impact of sulfur and other components in the fuel on catalyst performance, regeneration strategies, and the development of preemptive regeneration methods to maintain catalyst stability.

3. The study highlights the importance of understanding catalyst deactivation, particularly in the context of sulfur's role in promoting carbon formation and deactivation. It explores the regeneration of catalysts, including the use of air treatment, and investigates the irreversible aspects of deactivation, aiming to enhance catalyst longevity and efficiency.

4. The findings suggest that sulfur plays a significant role in catalyst deactivation, leading to carbon formation and subsequent deactivation. However, air treatment can regenerate the catalyst to initial activity levels, albeit with a reduced capacity for subsequent deactivations. The study also points to the potential for preemptive regeneration processes to extend the period of stable activity, particularly in the presence of sulfur.

5. The research underscores the need for further investigation into the chemical and structural changes in catalysts during the reforming process and regeneration. Understanding these changes will aid in the development of catalysts that are more resistant to deactivation and require less frequent regeneration, potentially improving the economic viability and environmental impact of the reforming process.
