1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling the conversion of renewable resources like ethanol into hydrogen, which can be used for fuel cells or hydrogen-powered combustion engines. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and practical implementation through existing infrastructure for ethanol/gasoline blends. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers more efficient use of renewable resources and potential for lower costs.

2. The primary advantage of using ethanol-gasoline blends (like E85 and E15) over 100% ethanol is their compatibility with existing fuel systems and infrastructure, facilitating a smoother transition to renewable fuels without requiring significant modifications to vehicles or fuel distribution networks.

3. Research on reforming pure ethanol is more abundant than on ethanol-gasoline blends because the latter presents unique challenges due to the presence of higher hydrocarbons in gasoline that can lead to catalyst deactivation. This highlights the need for further investigation into optimizing the reforming process for blends.

4. Sulfur is a significant concern in transportation fuels as it acts as a catalyst poison, leading to reduced stability and efficiency in the reforming process. It necessitates the development of sulfur-tolerant catalysts or processes to mitigate its effects.

5. At high space velocity conditions, C2 intermediates such as ethylene might contribute to catalyst deactivation through coking. This suggests that managing the reforming conditions carefully is crucial to maintaining catalyst performance.

6. Air treatment can effectively regenerate the catalyst to its initial activity level, but the rate of deactivation increases with subsequent treatments. This indicates that the catalyst undergoes some irreversible changes with repeated exposure to reforming conditions.

7. Implementing a preemptive regeneration process can significantly extend the period of stable activity when reforming sulfur-containing fuels, offering a practical solution to maintain catalyst efficiency and productivity over time.

3. 对纯乙醇的研究比对乙醇-汽油混合物的研究更为丰富，因为后者面临着独特的挑战，由于汽油中存在较高碳氢化合物导致催化剂失活。这强调了需要进一步研究以优化混合物的重整过程的重要性。

4. 硫是运输燃料中的一个重要问题，因为它作为催化剂毒物，导致催化剂稳定性降低和效率下降。这需要开发耐硫催化剂或过程来减轻其影响。

5. 在高空间速度条件下，C2中间体如乙烯可能通过结焦导致催化剂失活。这表明在保持催化剂性能时仔细管理重整条件至关重要。

6. 空气处理可以有效地使催化剂恢复到初始活动水平，但随后的处理会导致失活速率增加。这表明催化剂在反复暴露于重整条件下会经历一些不可逆的变化。
