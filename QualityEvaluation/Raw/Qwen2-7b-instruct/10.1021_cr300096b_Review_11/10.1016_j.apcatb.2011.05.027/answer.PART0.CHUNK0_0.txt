[1] "Increasing concerns about the environmental impact of vehicles with gasoline powered combustion engines have increased efforts to find technologies to reduce emissions and reduce fossil fuel consumption."
[2] "Ethanol has a lower vapor pressure relative to gasoline and therefore ethanol/gasoline blends such as E85 (85% ethanol) or E15 (15% ethanol) are more likely to be available then 100% ethanol within the current infrastructure."
[3] "There has been extensive research on the reforming of conventional transportation fuels of gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel and additionally there are many published studies on the reforming of pure ethanol, however, literature on ethanol-gasoline blends is limited."
[4] "Sulfur, which is also present in many transportation fuels is a known catalyst poison and typically has a detrimental effect on catalyst stability."
[5] "It is possible that C2 intermediates, specifically ethylene contribute to the deactivation at these conditions by coking."
[6] "Regardless of the extent of deactivation air treatment could regenerate the catalyst to initial activity but deactivation occurred more quickly following regeneration."
[7] "A process utilizing preemptive regeneration was able to extend the period of stable activity reforming the sulfur containing fuel."

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling the conversion of renewable resources like ethanol into hydrogen, which can be used for fuel cells or hydrogen-powered combustion engines. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and practical implementation through existing infrastructure for ethanol/gasoline blends. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers more efficient use of renewable resources and potential for lower costs.

2. The primary advantage of using ethanol-gasoline blends (like E85 and E15) over 100% ethanol is their compatibility with existing fuel systems and infrastructure, facilitating a smoother transition to renewable fuels without requiring significant modifications to vehicles or fuel distribution networks.

3. Research on reforming pure ethanol is more abundant than on ethanol-gasoline blends because the latter presents unique challenges due to the presence of higher hydrocarbons in gasoline that can lead to catalyst deactivation. This highlights the need for further investigation into optimizing the reforming process for blends.

4. Sulfur is a significant concern in transportation fuels as it acts as a catalyst poison, leading to reduced stability and efficiency in the reforming process. It necessitates the development of sulfur-tolerant catalysts or processes to mitigate its effects.

5. At high space velocity conditions, C2 intermediates such as ethylene might contribute to catalyst deactivation through coking. This suggests that managing the reforming conditions carefully is crucial to maintaining catalyst performance.

6. Air treatment can effectively regenerate the catalyst to its initial activity level, but the rate of deactivation increases with subsequent treatments. This indicates that the catalyst undergoes some irreversible changes with repeated exposure to reforming conditions.

7. Implementing a preemptive regeneration process can significantly extend the period of stable activity when reforming sulfur-containing fuels, offering a practical solution to maintain catalyst efficiency and productivity over time.

1. 选择性氧化物重整过程通过将可再生能源如乙醇转化为可用于燃料电池或氢动力内燃机的氢气，促进了可持续能源和化学生产。其主要优势包括更高的产品产量、较低的环境影响（由于排放量较低）以及通过现有乙醇/汽油混合物基础设施实现的可行实施。与传统方法相比，选择性氧化物重整提供了更高效的可再生能源利用和潜在的更低成本。

2. 使用如E85（85%乙醇）和E15（15%乙醇）等乙醇-汽油混合物的优势在于它们与现有燃料系统和基础设施兼容，这使得向可再生能源的过渡更加平滑，无需对车辆或燃料分配网络进行重大修改。

3. 对纯乙醇的研究比对乙醇-汽油混合物的研究更为丰富，因为后者面临着独特的挑战，由于汽油中存在较高碳氢化合物导致催化剂失活。这强调了需要进一步研究以优化混合物的重整过程的重要性。

4. 硫是运输燃料中的一个重要问题，因为它作为催化剂毒物，导致催化剂稳定性降低和效率下降。这需要开发耐硫催化剂或过程来减轻其影响。

5. 在高空间速度条件下，C2中间体如乙烯可能通过结焦导致催化剂失活。这表明在保持催化剂性能时仔细管理重整条件至关重要。

6. 空气处理可以有效地使催化剂恢复到初始活动水平，但随后的处理会导致失活速率增加。这表明催化剂在反复暴露于重整条件下会经历一些不可逆的变化。

7. 实施预设再生过程可以显著延长稳定期，当重整含硫燃料时，提供了一种维持催化剂效率和生产力的方法。
