Remarkable support effect for liquid phase methanol reforming with water over supported PtRu catalysts.

The development of efficient techniques for hydrogen production will be crucial to establishing hydrogen as a fuel of the future. A chemical conversion of methanol is one of the most promising methods because of its easy conversion, storage and handling with relatively low prices.

The advantages of liquid phase reforming are making more compact and simple reaction equipment and needless of the evaporation energy of methanol aqueous solution.

In our study on the methanol reforming reaction, PtRu/SiO2 catalyst exhibited much higher activity than Pt/SiO2 and Ru/SiO2 catalysts. The formation of solid solution of Pt and Ru by the addition of Ru to the Pt/SiO2 catalyst improved a CO tolerance capacity remarkably. The reforming reaction over PtRu/SiO2 catalyst proceeded through HCOOCH3 and HCOOH, and the dehydrogenation of methanol is the rate determining step of the reaction.

The interaction of Pt with TiO2 and alloying with Ru may have a similar effect for the improvement of the catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 in the liquid phase reforming of methanol.

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by providing an efficient method for hydrogen generation from methanol. This is crucial for establishing hydrogen as a viable fuel source due to its advantageous properties such as ease of conversion, storage, and handling. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers several key advantages:
    - **Product Yield**: The use of supported PtRu catalysts, particularly over TiO2 supports, shows high activity and selectivity, leading to a significant yield of hydrogen.
    - **Environmental Impact**: By employing liquid phase reforming with water, this process minimizes energy consumption associated with evaporation, potentially reducing environmental impact.
    - **Practical Implementation**: The compactness and simplicity of the reaction equipment required for this method make it more feasible for widespread adoption and integration into existing industrial processes.

2. The liquid phase reforming of methanol with water over supported PtRu catalysts offers a promising solution for hydrogen production with several benefits:
    - **Catalyst Efficiency**: PtRu/SiO2 catalysts demonstrate superior activity compared to Pt/SiO2 and Ru/SiO2 catalysts. The formation of a solid solution of Pt and Ru improves CO tolerance, enhancing the catalyst's performance.
    - **Reaction Mechanism**: The reforming reaction proceeds through partially dehydrogenated methylformate and formate intermediates, providing insight into the reaction pathway.
    - **Support Material Impact**: Different oxide supports (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, MgO, CeO2, ZrO2) influence the catalytic activity and selectivity of the reforming process. Basic oxide supports improve CO2 selectivity, whereas acidic supports suppress both activity and selectivity.
    - **Enhanced Selectivity**: The interaction between Pt and TiO2, along with the alloying of Pt and Ru, plays a critical role in improving the selectivity for CO2 formation, contributing to the efficiency and environmental friendliness of the process.
