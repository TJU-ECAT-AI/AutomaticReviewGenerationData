          The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by providing an efficient method for hydrogen generation from methanol. This is crucial for establishing hydrogen as a viable fuel source due to its advantageous properties such as ease of conversion, storage, and handling. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers several key advantages:
          - Product Yield: The use of supported PtRu catalysts, particularly over TiO2 supports, shows high activity and selectivity, leading to a significant yield of hydrogen.
          - Environmental Impact: By employing liquid phase reforming with water, this process minimizes energy consumption associated with evaporation, potentially reducing environmental impact.
          - Practical Implementation: The compactness and simplicity of the reaction equipment required for this method make it more feasible for widespread adoption and integration into existing industrial processes.

          "Over TiO2 supported catalyst, hydrogen was linearly produced for a longer reaction period whose amount reached to 800 μmol after 300 min."
          "On the basis of turnover frequency determined by the amount of H2 chemisorption, PtRu/Al2O3, PtRu/MgO and PtRu/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited lower TOF of hydrogen formation."
          "Over PtRu/TiO2 catalyst, large amount of hydrogen was formed at the initial stage of the reaction accompanied with the significant decrease of the H2 formation rate, which may be explained by the oxidation of partially reduced ceria."
          "It is suggested that the activation of water molecules proceeds on TiO2 support, which oxidize the methanol intermediates adsorbed on Pt sites."
          "The interaction of Pt with the partially reduced TiO2 is responsible for the improvement of selectivity over TiO2 supported catalysts."
          "Basic oxide support improved the selectivity to CO2 and acidic support suppressed both catalytic activity and selectivity."

          In our study on the methanol reforming reaction, PtRu/SiO2 catalyst exhibited much higher activity than Pt/SiO2 and Ru/SiO2 catalysts. The formation of solid solution of Pt and Ru by the addition of Ru to the Pt/SiO2 catalyst improved a CO tolerance capacity remarkably. The reforming reaction over PtRu/SiO2 catalyst proceeded through HCOOCH3 and HCOOH, and the dehydrogenation of methanol is the rate determining step of the reaction.
