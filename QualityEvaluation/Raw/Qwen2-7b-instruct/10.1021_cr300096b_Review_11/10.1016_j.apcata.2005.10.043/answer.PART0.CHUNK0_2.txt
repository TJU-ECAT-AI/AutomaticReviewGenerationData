Remarkable support effect for liquid phase methanol reforming with water over supported PtRu catalysts Abstract
Support effect for the catalytic activity of liquid phase reforming of methanol with water was investigated over various supported PtRu bimetallic catalysts. The SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, MgO, CeO2 and ZrO2 were used as support materials by conventional impregnation method. Basic oxide supports improved the selectivity to CO2, whereas acidic supports suppressed the catalytic activity and selectivity. The PtRu/TiO2 catalyst exhibited highest activity and selectivity for CO2, which were improved by higher temperature reduction. The improved activity and selectivity were attributable to the occurrence of SMSI state and PtRu alloy, respectively. The reforming reaction over PtRu/TiO2 catalyst proceeded through partially dehydrogenated HCOOCH3 and HCOOH intermediate with the similar mechanism as that over SiO2 supported PtRu catalyst.

Answer: 
The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by providing a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods. Key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and simpler, more compact reaction equipment. This is because the liquid phase reforming of methanol allows for easier conversion, storage, and handling of hydrogen with relatively low costs. Moreover, compared to traditional steam reforming, the liquid phase method requires less energy for methanol evaporation, making the overall process more efficient.
