Remarkable support effect for liquid phase methanol reforming with water over supported PtRu catalysts.

The development of efficient techniques for hydrogen production will be crucial to establishing hydrogen as a fuel of the future. A chemical conversion of methanol is one of the most promising methods because of its easy conversion, storage, and handling with relatively low prices.

In the investigation of DMFC, Pt is known as the most active element as the catalysts for dehydrogenation of methanol. But Pt itself is not sufficiently active to be useful commercially. The simplest method of promotion of the catalytic activity is the use of alloying of Pt with different metals, i.e. PtSn, PtRu, PtOs, PtIr, etc.

The reforming reaction over PtRu/TiO2 catalyst proceeded through partially dehydrogenated HCOOCH3 and HCOOH intermediate with the similar mechanism as that over SiO2 supported PtRu catalyst.

The interaction of Pt with TiO2 and alloying with Ru may have a similar effect for the improvement of the catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 in the liquid phase reforming of methanol.

Higher temperature reduction of PtRu/TiO2 improved their catalytic activity and selectivity by complete alloying of Pt and Ru.

Basic oxide support improved the selectivity to CO2 and acidic support suppressed both catalytic activity and selectivity.

The interaction of Pt with the partially reduced TiO2 is responsible for the improvement of selectivity over TiO2 supported catalysts.

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting methanol into hydrogen, which can be used as a clean fuel. Its key advantages include higher product yield, reduced environmental impact due to lower CO emissions, and practical implementation in more compact systems compared to traditional methods.

2. The liquid phase reforming of methanol offers advantages over traditional steam reforming in terms of making more compact and simple reaction equipment and eliminating the need for the evaporation energy of methanol aqueous solution.

3. The use of PtRu catalysts, especially over TiO2 support, improves the catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 formation. This is attributed to the formation of PtRu alloy and the interaction between Pt and TiO2.

4. The improvement in catalytic activity and selectivity over PtRu/TiO2 catalysts is achieved through higher temperature reduction, which leads to complete alloying of Pt and Ru. This process enhances the reaction mechanism involving partially dehydrogenated intermediates.

5. Selectivity to CO2 is improved by using basic oxide supports, while acidic supports suppress both activity and selectivity. The interaction between Pt and the partially reduced TiO2 is crucial for enhancing the selectivity of the TiO2-supported catalysts.

1. 甲醇选择性重整过程对可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献，通过高效地将甲醇转化为氢气，这可以作为清洁燃料使用。其关键优势包括更高的产品产量、较低的环境影响（由于CO排放量较低），以及与传统方法相比在更紧凑系统中实现的可行实施。

2. 液相甲醇重整提供了与传统蒸汽重整相比的优势，即制作更紧凑且简单的反应设备，并且无需蒸发甲醇水溶液的能量。

3.PtRu催化剂，尤其是TiO2支持下的催化剂，提高了催化活性和CO2形成的专一性。这归因于PtRu合金的形成和Pt与TiO2之间的相互作用。

4.PtRu/TiO2催化剂的催化活性和CO2选择性的改善是通过提高温度还原实现的，这导致了Pt和Ru的完全合金化。这一过程增强了涉及部分脱氢中间体的反应机制。

5. 基本氧化物支持提高了CO2的选择性，而酸性支持则抑制了活性和选择性。Pt与部分还原的TiO2之间的相互作用对于增强TiO2支持催化剂的选择性至关重要。
