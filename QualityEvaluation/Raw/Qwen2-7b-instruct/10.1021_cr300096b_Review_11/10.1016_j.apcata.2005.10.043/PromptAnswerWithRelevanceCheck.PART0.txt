Remarkable support effect for liquid phase methanol reforming with water over supported PtRu catalysts.

The development of efficient techniques for hydrogen production will be crucial to establishing hydrogen as a fuel of the future. A chemical conversion of methanol is one of the most promising methods because of its easy conversion, storage, and handling with relatively low prices.

In the investigation of DMFC, Pt is known as the most active element as the catalysts for dehydrogenation of methanol. But Pt itself is not sufficiently active to be useful commercially. The simplest method of promotion of the catalytic activity is the use of alloying of Pt with different metals, i.e. PtSn, PtRu, PtOs, PtIr, etc.

The reforming reaction over PtRu/TiO2 catalyst proceeded through partially dehydrogenated HCOOCH3 and HCOOH intermediate with the similar mechanism as that over SiO2 supported PtRu catalyst.

The interaction of Pt with TiO2 and alloying with Ru may have a similar effect for the improvement of the catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 in the liquid phase reforming of methanol.

Higher temperature reduction of PtRu/TiO2 improved their catalytic activity and selectivity by complete alloying of Pt and Ru.

Basic oxide support improved the selectivity to CO2 and acidic support suppressed both catalytic activity and selectivity.

The interaction of Pt with the partially reduced TiO2 is responsible for the improvement of selectivity over TiO2 supported catalysts.

Remarkable support effect for liquid phase methanol reforming with water over supported PtRu catalysts.

The development of efficient techniques for hydrogen production will be crucial to establishing hydrogen as a fuel of the future. A chemical conversion of methanol is one of the most promising methods because of its easy conversion, storage and handling with relatively low prices. The most popular process of hydrogen production from methanol is a steam reforming, which have been studied extensively and reported that Cu and group VIII metal catalysts showed excellent activity for the reaction.

For liquid phase reforming of methanol, the advantages are making more compact and simple reaction equipment and needless of the evaporation energy of methanol aqueous solution.

In the investigation of DMFC, Pt is known as the most active element as the catalysts for dehydrogenation of methanol. But Pt itself is not sufficiently active to be useful commercially. The simplest method of promotion of the catalytic activity is the use of alloying of Pt with different metals, i.e. PtSn, PtRu, PtOs, PtIr, etc.

We have studied the liquid phase reforming of methanol with water over silica supported Pt-group catalyst in the batch reactor with suspended powder catalyst at boiling point of the methanol solution. The main purpose of our study is the development of more simple and compact system for production of pure hydrogen.

Although DMFC studies described above have been investigated by the half cell experiments at acidic conditions, it is strongly suggested that the catalytic activity of liquid phase methanol reforming by neutral conditions over suspended catalysts can be also improved by using of effective metal oxide to platinum group metal catalysts.

In our study, we have investigated liquid phase reforming reaction of methanol over PtRu metals supported on various oxides and the effect of support materials for catalytic activity and selectivity was discussed in depth. The reaction mechanisms over TiO2 supported PtRu catalyst was also investigated by a kinetic approach.

Remarkable support effect for liquid phase methanol reforming with water over supported PtRu catalysts Abstract
Support effect for the catalytic activity of liquid phase reforming of methanol with water was investigated over various supported PtRu bimetallic catalysts. The SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, MgO, CeO2 and ZrO2 were used as support materials by conventional impregnation method. Basic oxide supports improved the selectivity to CO2, whereas acidic supports suppressed the catalytic activity and selectivity. The PtRu/TiO2 catalyst exhibited highest activity and selectivity for CO2, which were improved by higher temperature reduction. The improved activity and selectivity were attributable to the occurrence of SMSI state and PtRu alloy, respectively. The reforming reaction over PtRu/TiO2 catalyst proceeded through partially dehydrogenated HCOOCH3 and HCOOH intermediate with the similar mechanism as that over SiO2 supported PtRu catalyst.

The advantages of liquid phase reforming are making more compact and simple reaction equipment and needless of the evaporation energy of methanol aqueous solution.

In our study on the methanol reforming reaction, PtRu/SiO2 catalyst exhibited much higher activity than Pt/SiO2 and Ru/SiO2 catalysts. The formation of solid solution of Pt and Ru by the addition of Ru to the Pt/SiO2 catalyst improved a CO tolerance capacity remarkably. The reforming reaction over PtRu/SiO2 catalyst proceeded through HCOOCH3 and HCOOH, and the dehydrogenation of methanol is the rate determining step of the reaction.

The interaction of Pt with TiO2 and alloying with Ru may have a similar effect for the improvement of the catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 in the liquid phase reforming of methanol.
