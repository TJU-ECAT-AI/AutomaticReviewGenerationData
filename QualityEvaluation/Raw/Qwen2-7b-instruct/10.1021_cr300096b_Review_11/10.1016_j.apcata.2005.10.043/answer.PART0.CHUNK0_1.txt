Remarkable support effect for liquid phase methanol reforming with water over supported PtRu catalysts.

The development of efficient techniques for hydrogen production will be crucial to establishing hydrogen as a fuel of the future. A chemical conversion of methanol is one of the most promising methods because of its easy conversion, storage and handling with relatively low prices. The most popular process of hydrogen production from methanol is a steam reforming, which have been studied extensively and reported that Cu and group VIII metal catalysts showed excellent activity for the reaction.

For liquid phase reforming of methanol, the advantages are making more compact and simple reaction equipment and needless of the evaporation energy of methanol aqueous solution.

In the investigation of DMFC, Pt is known as the most active element as the catalysts for dehydrogenation of methanol. But Pt itself is not sufficiently active to be useful commercially. The simplest method of promotion of the catalytic activity is the use of alloying of Pt with different metals, i.e. PtSn, PtRu, PtOs, PtIr, etc.

We have studied the liquid phase reforming of methanol with water over silica supported Pt-group catalyst in the batch reactor with suspended powder catalyst at boiling point of the methanol solution. The main purpose of our study is the development of more simple and compact system for production of pure hydrogen.

Although DMFC studies described above have been investigated by the half cell experiments at acidic conditions, it is strongly suggested that the catalytic activity of liquid phase methanol reforming by neutral conditions over suspended catalysts can be also improved by using of effective metal oxide to platinum group metal catalysts.

In our study, we have investigated liquid phase reforming reaction of methanol over PtRu metals supported on various oxides and the effect of support materials for catalytic activity and selectivity was discussed in depth. The reaction mechanisms over TiO2 supported PtRu catalyst was also investigated by a kinetic approach.

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling the efficient conversion of methanol into hydrogen, which can serve as a clean fuel source. This process offers several key advantages over traditional methods:

1. **Product Yield**: The liquid phase reforming of methanol with water allows for the production of hydrogen with a high yield, making it a viable alternative to steam reforming for hydrogen production. The reforming reaction over PtRu/TiO2 catalysts is particularly efficient, producing hydrogen with a high rate and selectivity.

2. **Environmental Impact**: By utilizing methanol, a readily available feedstock, this method reduces the dependency on fossil fuels and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the ability to perform the reaction under moderate conditions makes it more environmentally friendly compared to high-pressure steam reforming.

3. **Practical Implementation**: The simplicity of the equipment required for liquid phase reforming, along with the compact nature of the reactors, makes this process more feasible for industrial applications. The use of suspended catalysts in boiling methanol solutions facilitates a straightforward setup, reducing costs and complexity compared to traditional fixed-bed reactors.

The key advantages of selective oxygenate reforming include its efficiency in hydrogen production, its potential for reducing environmental impact, and its practicality in terms of equipment design and operation. By leveraging advanced catalysts such as PtRu on various oxide supports, this technology can be further optimized for commercial use, contributing to a more sustainable energy future.
