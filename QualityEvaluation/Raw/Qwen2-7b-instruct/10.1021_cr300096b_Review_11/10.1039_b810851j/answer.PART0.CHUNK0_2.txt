[1] "Hydrogen is an important raw material for the chemical industry and it is a potential clean fuel which could have an important role in reducing environmental emissions for the future."
[2] "Production of hydrogen from fossil fuels will increase the emission amounts of carbon dioxide and local pollution."
[3] "By contrast, production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass, an environmentally friendly and rich feedstock, would open a new prospect for the utilization of the renewable biomass sources."
[4] "Currently, commercially used hydrogen is mainly produced on a large scale by steam reforming of natural gas."
[5] "However, two problems, exorbitant reforming temperature and catalyst deactivation, remain serious challenges in the production of hydrogen from bio-oil."
[6] "We show a novel and efficient low-temperature reforming approach for production of hydrogen from bio-oil by using the electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) of organic compounds over a conventional Ni-based reforming catalyst."
[7] "In the case of I = 0 (i.e., CSR), the carbon conversion was only 14.7% at 400 C, and increased to 65.4% at 600 C. However, on the current flowing through the 18%NiO/Al2O3 catalyst (i.e., ECR), the carbon conversion was remarkably enhanced, particularly at lower temperature."
[8] "The yield of hydrogen also remarkably increased from 35.6 to 95.8% with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A at 500 C."
[9] "The above results indicate that the alterations of the catalyst properties induced by the current over the initial 5 h would have a minor influence on the production of hydrogen from ECR of the bio-oil."
[10] "The thermal electrons in ECR significantly promoted the dissociation and the reforming reactions of the oxygenated organic compounds in the bio-oil."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing renewable biomass sources, specifically lignocellulosic biomass, to produce hydrogen. This method offers several advantages over traditional methods, including high hydrogen yield and content, lower environmental impact due to reduced carbon dioxide emissions and local pollution, and potentially lower costs associated with catalyst deactivation. 

2. Compared to traditional hydrogen production methods that rely on steam reforming of natural gas, the process of selective oxygenate reforming using electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) over a conventional Ni-based reforming catalyst enables efficient production of hydrogen at lower temperatures, which reduces energy consumption and environmental impact. Additionally, the use of renewable biomass as a feedstock aligns with sustainable energy goals and can replace fossil fuels.

3. The electrochemical catalytic reforming method demonstrates a significant enhancement in carbon conversion and hydrogen yield, particularly at lower temperatures, making it a promising technique for hydrogen production from bio-oil. The ability to increase hydrogen yield with current application suggests an energy-efficient way to promote decomposition and reforming reactions, which is crucial for improving the overall efficiency of the process.
