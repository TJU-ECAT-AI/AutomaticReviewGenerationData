[1] "Hydrogen is an important raw material for the chemical industry and it is a potential clean fuel which could have an important role in reducing environmental emissions for the future."
[2] "Currently, commercially used hydrogen is mainly produced on a large scale by steam reforming of natural gas."
[3] "However, the production of hydrogen from fossil fuels will increase the emission amounts of carbon dioxide and local pollution."
[4] "By contrast, production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass, an environmentally friendly and rich feedstock, would open a new prospect for the utilization of the renewable biomass sources."
[5] "Production of hydrogen from bio-oil reforming is probably one of the most promising options because it can achieve high hydrogen yield and high content of hydrogen."
[6] "The route of the steam reforming of bio-oil involves fast pyrolysis of biomass to generate bio-oil and reforming of it to produce a gaseous rich-hydrogen mixture."
[7] "So far, it has been explored for the steam reforming of bio-oil via various catalysts such as Ni-based catalyst and noble metal catalysts."
[8] "However, two problems, exorbitant reforming temperature and catalyst deactivation, remain serious challenges in the production of hydrogen from bio-oil."
[9] "Much of our attention has been paid to the production of bio-oil, hydrogen and liquid bio-fuels."
[10] "We show a novel and efficient low-temperature reforming approach for production of hydrogen from bio-oil by using the electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) of organic compounds over a conventional Ni-based reforming catalyst."
[11] "We also demonstrate that the thermal electrons on the catalyst surface play important roles in the reforming reactions of the organic compounds."
[12] "In case of CSR, ac current was shut off and the catalyst bed was heated by an outside furnace."
[13] "However, on the current flowing through the 18%NiO/Al2O3 catalyst (i.e., ECR), the carbon conversion was remarkably enhanced, particularly at lower temperature."
[14] "The yield of hydrogen also remarkably increased from 35.6 to 95.8% with increasing the current from 0 to 3.8 A at 500 C."
[15] "The above results indicate that the alterations of the catalyst properties induced by the current over the initial 5 h would have a minor influence on the production of hydrogen from ECR of the bio-oil."
[16] "The reduction level of the catalyst surface via the XPS measurements for ECR, described by the ratio of r = [Ni0]s/([Ni0]s + [Ni]2+s), was about 50.8%, which was obviously higher than the value of 28.7% from CSR."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently producing hydrogen from bio-oil, a renewable resource. Its key advantages include:

1. High hydrogen yield and content: The process achieves high hydrogen yield and content, making it a promising option for hydrogen production.
2. Environmental benefits: Producing hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass reduces carbon dioxide emissions and local pollution, contributing to a cleaner environment.
3. Lower operational costs: Electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) allows for low-temperature reforming, potentially reducing energy consumption and operational costs compared to traditional steam reforming methods.
4. Efficient use of biomass: The process utilizes bio-oil, a byproduct of biomass pyrolysis, thereby increasing the utilization of renewable resources and minimizing waste.

These advantages make the selective oxygenate reforming process a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional hydrogen production methods, supporting the transition towards cleaner energy sources.
