[1] "The chemical behavior of monolayer coverages of one metal on the surface of another, e.g., Ni/W, Fe/W, Pd/W, Cu/Re, Ni/Mo, etc., has recently been shown to be dramatically different from that seen for either of the metallic components separately."
[2] "These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system."
[3] "Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by altering the chemical behavior of monolayer coverages of metals on surfaces, leading to changes in their chemisorption and catalytic properties. This modification can result in improved efficiency and selectivity of reactions, thus enhancing product yield. It also impacts the environmental impact by potentially reducing the use of harsh chemicals and energy consumption in industrial processes. Practical implementation benefits from these properties, as they can lead to more effective and environmentally friendly catalysts for various chemical transformations.
