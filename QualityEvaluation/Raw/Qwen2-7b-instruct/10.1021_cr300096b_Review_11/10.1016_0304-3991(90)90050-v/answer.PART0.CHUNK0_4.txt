[1] "These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system."
[2] "Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by altering the chemical properties of monolayer coverages of metals on surfaces, leading to modifications in chemisorption and catalytic properties. This results in changes in the structural and electronic properties of bimetallic systems. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers advantages in terms of higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to optimized processes, and enhanced practical implementation through tailored catalyst design.
