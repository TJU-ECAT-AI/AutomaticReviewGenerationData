4.3 Reforming of Oxygenates
Selective reforming of oxygenates is a promising way to produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells, and syngas for production of chemicals and fuels, and in upgrading of feedstocks. (256, 258, 260, 347, 348)

Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage. (256, 258, 260, 347, 348)

Table 7 summarizes selected reactor studies of oxygenate reforming over supported catalysts; selected UHV studies of reforming over bimetallic surfaces are listed in Table 3. (256, 258, 260, 347, 348)

4.3.1 Reforming of Alcohols and Polyols
The desirable reaction pathway is selective CC bond scission, to produce H2 and CO. (264)

DFT calculations were carried out to study the trend in the binding energies of oxygenates on bimetallic surfaces. (264)

On Pt(111), methanol adsorbed reversibly on the surface without undergoing decomposition, consistent with previous studies. (255, 369-371)

In contrast, significant amounts of H2 and CO were produced from methanol reforming on the NiPtPt(111) surface. (258, 264)

The oxygenate reforming yield displays a somewhat linear correlation and increases as the surface d-band center is shifted closer to the Fermi level. (257-259)

4.3.1.2 Other Pt-Based Bimetallic Catalysts
Pt-based catalysts have shown activity for reforming reactions when alloyed with Ni, (349-352) Co, (349) Sn, (323) Fe, (349, 353) Pd, (353) Ru, (149, 348, 353, 354) Re, (355, 372) Au, (353, 356) and Rh. (373, 374)

Bimetallic catalysts outperform monometallic Pt for methanol reforming in the order of PtFe > PtRu > PtPd > PtAu > Pt. (353)

High activity on the PtFe catalysts is attributed to segregation of Fe to the surface of the nanoparticles during calcination due to the high affinity of Fe for oxygen. (353)

PtRu catalysts have been found to be more active for ethanol steam reforming than either parent metal; however, catalysts derived from organic clusters are more active than those derived from inorganic salts. (149)

PtRh bimetallic catalysts are also effective for ethanol reforming when supported on CeO2. (373, 374)

Glycerol, a waste product from biodiesel production, is also used as a feedstock. Reforming of glycerol into syngas in a flow reactor at 548 K shows an increase in H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 concentrations upon adding Re to Pt/C catalysts. (348)

Re promotes the overall rate of glycerol reforming by reducing the binding energy of CO to Pt, which makes surface sites more available to participate in reforming. (348)

Supported PtRe catalysts are also more tolerant to carbonaceous residues than supported Pt and, therefore, are less likely to deactivate rapidly. (322)

4.3.2 Reforming of Other Oxygenates
Glycolaldehyde, (23) the smallest molecule with both COH and CO bonds as well as the same C/O ratio as the larger sugar molecules, is a good probe molecule to determine how the presence of the CO functional group affects the reforming reaction mechanism. (23)

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by producing hydrogen for fuel cells and syngas for chemical and fuel production. It has advantages in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation compared to traditional methods. Its low toxicity and reactivity make it compatible with existing transportation and storage infrastructure. The reforming process, especially when using oxygenates derived from renewable biomass, can be CO2 neutral, potentially benefiting the environment.

2. The process involves selectively breaking carbon-carbon (CC) bonds to produce hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO). DFT calculations help understand the trend in the binding energies of oxygenates on bimetallic surfaces. For instance, on Pt(111), methanol adsorbs reversibly without decomposition, while on NiPtPt(111), significant amounts of H2 and CO are produced. The reforming activity shows a linear correlation with the surface d-band center, indicating that surfaces binding adsorbates more strongly promote reforming reactions.

3. Various Pt-based bimetallic catalysts demonstrate enhanced activity for reforming reactions. These catalysts include alloys with Ni, Co, Sn, Fe, Pd, Ru, Re, Au, and Rh. For methanol reforming, the order of activity is generally PtFe > PtRu > PtPd > PtAu > Pt. High activity on PtFe catalysts is attributed to the segregation of Fe to the surface during calcination. Catalysts derived from organic clusters are more active than those from inorganic salts for ethanol reforming. PtRh catalysts on CeO2 are effective for ethanol reforming, enhancing H2 production over alkane formation. Glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel production, is also reformable into syngas with the addition of Re to Pt/C catalysts.

4. Glycolaldehyde, a probe molecule with COH and CO bonds, helps understand the impact of the CO functional group on reforming mechanisms. The presence of CO enhances activity on the Pt(111) surface, while on surfaces with high OH bond cleavage activity, such as NiPtPt(111), CO's presence does not significantly affect activity or reaction pathways. The similarity in reforming activity between NiPtPt(111) and Ni/WC surfaces suggests the potential for using WC as a substitute for Pt in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.

1. 选择性氧化物重整为燃料电池提供氢气，生产化学品和燃料，并在原料升级中发挥作用。与传统方法相比，它在产品产量、环境影响和实施方面具有优势。其低毒性、低反应性使其与现有的运输和存储基础设施兼容。如果使用可再生生物质产生的氧化物进行重整过程，则可以实现CO2中性，可能对环境有益。

2. 该过程涉及选择性地断裂碳-碳（CC）键以产生氢气（H2）和一氧化碳（CO）。DFT计算有助于理解氧化物在双金属表面上的吸附能趋势。例如，在Pt(111)上，甲醇可以稳定吸附而不分解，而在NiPtPt(111)上，会产生大量H2和CO。重整活性显示出与表面d带中心成线性的相关性，表明吸附剂结合力更强的表面促进重整反应。

3. 各种基于Pt的双金属催化剂在重整反应中表现出增强的活性。这些催化剂包括与Ni、Co、Sn、Fe、Pd、Ru、Re、Au和Rh的合金。对于甲醇重整，活动顺序通常是PtFe > PtRu > PtPd > PtAu > Pt。高活性的PtFe催化剂归因于Fe在煅烧期间向表面的沉积。有机簇衍生的催化剂比无机盐衍生的催化剂更活跃，用于乙醇重整。PtRh催化剂在CeO2上对于乙醇重整是有效的，增强了H2的产生，而不是烷烃形成。生物柴油副产品甘油也通过添加Re到Pt/C催化剂中转化为合成气。

4. 水合二醛（探针分子，含有COH和CO键），帮助了解CO功能团对重整机制的影响。CO的存在增强了在Pt(111)表面的活性，而在OH键断裂活性高的表面上，如NiPtPt(111)，CO的存在不会显著影响活性或反应途径。NiPtPt(111)和Ni/WC表面的相似重整活性表明使用WC作为Pt基双金属催化剂的替代品的可能性。
