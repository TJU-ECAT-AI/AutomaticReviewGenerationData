[1] "Selective reforming of oxygenates is a promising way to produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells, and syngas for production of chemicals and fuels, and in upgrading of feedstocks."
[2] "If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass, the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct can be consumed by future biomass growth."
[3] "Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."
[4] "In general, the oxygenate reforming yield displays a somewhat linear correlation and increases as the surface d-band center is shifted closer to the Fermi level."
[5] "Supported PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were also found to be effective for ethanol reforming."
[6] "Production of on-board hydrogen is an attractive option because it allows hydrogen-containing fuels to be stored and transported in liquid form, for which there is an existing infrastructure."
[7] "The exact origin of the bimetallic enhancement can only be determined by in situ measurement of the surface termination of supported PtNi catalysts, such as by EXAFS under aqueous-phase reforming conditions."
