<p>Aqueous-phase reforming (APR) of ethylene glycol solutions using a high-throughput reactor was conducted to screen for hydrogen production. Promising catalysts were characterized by CO chemisorption and tested further in a fixed bed reactor.</p>
<p>Monometallic Pt and Pd catalysts showed lower activity and turnover frequencies for hydrogen production compared to bimetallic PtNi, PtCo, PtFe, and PdFe catalysts. The PtNi/Al2O3 and PtCo/Al2O3 catalysts had values equal to 2.85.2 min<sup>-1</sup> at 483 K for APR of ethylene glycol solutions, compared to 1.9 min<sup>-1</sup> for Pt/Al2O3 under similar conditions. A Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 catalyst showed values of 0.34.3 min<sup>-1</sup> at 453483 K, about three times higher than Pt/Al2O3 under identical conditions.</p>
<p>Pd1Fe9/Al2O3 catalysts had values of 1.4 and 4.3 min<sup>-1</sup> at temperatures of 453 and 483 K, respectively, 3946 times higher than Pd/Al2O3 at the same conditions. Catalysts consisting of Pd supported on high surface area Fe2O3 (Nanocat) showed the highest turnover frequencies for H2 production among those tested, with values of 14.6, 39.1, and 60.1 min<sup>-1</sup> at temperatures of 453, 483, and 498 K, respectively.</p>
<p>The activity of Pt-based catalysts for APR can be increased by alloying Pt with a metal (Ni or Co) that decreases the strengths with which CO and hydrogen interact with the surface, thereby increasing the fraction of catalytic sites available for reaction with ethylene glycol. The activity of Pd-based catalysts for APR can be increased by adding a water-gas shift promoter (e.g., Fe2O3).</p>

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling the production of hydrogen from renewable biomass sources, avoiding the release of CO2 during the reforming process. This method has several key advantages over traditional methods:

   - **Product Yield**: The APR process yields low levels of CO (<1000 ppm), making it more efficient in producing hydrogen compared to conventional steam reforming of hydrocarbons which requires multiple reactors for hydrogen production.
   
   - **Environmental Impact**: Since the APR process uses renewable biomass resources, it significantly reduces the carbon footprint associated with hydrogen production. This is because the CO2 formed during reforming is consumed by further biomass growth, ensuring a net-zero CO2 emission in the process.
   
   - **Practical Implementation**: The APR process occurs in the liquid phase, eliminating the need for vaporizing the aqueous feedstock. This feature improves the overall thermal efficiency of the process, making it more practical and cost-effective compared to traditional methods that require additional steps for vaporization.
   
   - **Versatility in Feedstocks**: APR can utilize various renewable oxygenated molecules derived from biomass, such as ethylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, etc., providing flexibility in feedstock selection and enhancing the sustainability of the hydrogen production process.
   
   - **Efficiency in Catalysis**: The use of bimetallic catalysts, particularly PtNi, PtCo, PtFe, and PdFe, has been shown to significantly enhance the activity and turnover frequency for hydrogen production compared to monometallic catalysts, leading to more efficient and faster hydrogen production rates.
   
   - **Synergistic Effects**: Alloying Pt with metals like Ni, Co, or Fe can lower the heats of CO and hydrogen adsorption, thereby increasing the fraction of the surface available for reaction with ethylene glycol, thus improving the overall activity of the catalyst per surface site.
   
   - **Promotion of Water-Gas Shift Reaction**: Adding water-gas shift promoters like Fe2O3 to Pd-based catalysts can significantly improve the catalytic activity for APR by accelerating the water-gas shift reaction, which is often the rate-determining step in APR processes involving Pd catalysts.

   - **灵活的原料选择**：APR可以利用来自生物质的各种可再生氧源分子，如乙二醇、甘油、山梨醇等，提供了原料选择的灵活性，并增强了氢气生产过程的可持续性。
   
   - **催化剂活性提升**：使用PtNi、PtCo、PtFe和PdFe等双金属催化剂显著提高了氢气生产的活性和周转频率，与单金属催化剂相比，这导致了更快的氢气生产速率。
   
   - **协同效应**：将Pt与Ni、Co或Fe合金化可以降低CO和氢吸附的热量，从而增加表面可用于与乙二醇反应的催化位点的比例，从而提高催化剂每表面积单位的总体活性。
   
   - **促进水煤气变换反应**：向Pd基催化剂添加水煤气变换促进剂如Fe2O3可以显著提高APR的催化活性，通过加速水煤气变换反应，该反应通常是涉及Pd催化剂的APR过程中的决定性步骤。

<p>Initial HTR studies for APR of a 0.4 wt.% glycerol solution using 3 wt.% Pt/Al2O3 catalysts showed that at conversions lower than 40%, the quantity of H2 produced and glycerol conversion increase linearly with the amount of catalyst.</p>
<p>Another initial test of the HTR is shown in Fig. 2 in which silica-supported monometallic catalysts were screened for APR of an aqueous 5 wt.% ethylene glycol solution. This figure shows that methane is produced even when no catalyst is in the HTR well, and this product must be caused by reaction of the silicone rubber gasket with water.</p>
<p>Studies of Pt-bimetallic catalysts in the HTR show that addition of Ni, Co and Fe to 3 wt.% Pt/Al2O3 increases the catalytic activity for H2 production by two to three times on a mass basis, as shown in Fig. 3.</p>
<p>The addition of Ni to Pt/Al2O3 more than doubles the turnover frequency for H2 production ( ) for Pt1Ni1/Al2O3 compared to Pt/Al2O3, while maintaining high H2 selectivity ( Fig. 4 A).</p>
<p>Iron oxide is used commercially as a water-gas shift catalyst [12] . Also, Nanocat (Fe2O3, 250 m2/g) has previously been shown to have high activity for CO oxidation [13] . Catalysts consisting of metals (including Ni, Pt, Cu, Au, Co, Pd, Rh, Ir and Ru) supported on Nanocat were prepared and tested for APR of methanol in the HTR.</p>
<p>Palladium supported on Nanocat had the highest activity for APR of methanol of the monometallic/Fe2O3 catalysts. The only other metal that increased the activity of Fe2O3 for APR was Pt; however, Pt/Fe2O3 was only slightly more active than Fe2O3.</p>
<p>Iron has a promotional effect on both Pd and Pt catalysts, as shown in Table 2. The for Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 is three times higher than for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at temperatures ranging from 423 to 453 K. At a temperature of 498 K the values of for Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 are similar, giving activation energies of 82 and 98 kJ mol1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6.</p>
<p>In an attempt to develop more active catalysts for APR, we developed a reactor to rapidly screen catalysts for our aqueous-phase reaction conditions. In our traditional APR fixed bed reactor, one catalyst is tested in a 34 h period. This amount of time includes 10 h for the reduction and 24 h time-on stream. High-throughput testing of catalysts, in which multiple catalysts are tested in a single reactor system, is a common method to rapidly screen a large number of catalysts [14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] .</p>
<p>A general reaction scheme for APR of ethylene glycol has previously been proposed for Pt/Al2O3 catalysts [6] ,[7] . In this scheme, adsorbed ethylene glycol undergoes dehydrogenation on the surface followed by CC bond cleavage and water-gas shift to give CO2 and H2 products. Adsorption of ethylene glycol, water, H2 and CO2 are assumed to be in quasi-equilibrium.</p>
<p>Bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts have turnover frequencies for H2 production 1.52.8 times higher than monometallic Pt catalysts at 483 K. The activity per surface site for PtNi catalysts is highest at an atomic ratio of 1:1.</p>
<p>When Pd is added to high surface area Fe2O3, the catalyst has the highest activity per surface site of any catalyst tested in this study, as shown in Table 2.</p>
