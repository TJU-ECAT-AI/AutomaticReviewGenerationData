<p>Aqueous-phase reforming (APR) of renewable biomass derived oxygenated molecules, such as ethylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, allows for the production of hydrogen without the net production of CO2, as CO2 formed during reforming is consumed by further biomass growth.</p>
<p>The APR process involves CC bond cleavage combined with water-gas shift in a single reactor producing low levels of CO (&lt;1000 ppm), whereas conventional steam reforming of hydrocarbons requires a series of reactors for hydrogen production.</p>
<p>Byproducts may be formed via series pathways that involve hydrogenation of adsorbed CO and CO2 to form alkanes. Alkane byproducts can also form by parallel pathways involving cleavage of CO bonds.</p>
<p>Good APR catalysts must have high rates of CC bond cleavage and water-gas shift reaction, whereas these catalysts must have low rates of CO bond cleavage and hydrogenation of CO or CO2.</p>
<p>Initial studies found that the activity (in terms of CO2 production rate) of silica-supported monometallic catalysts for the APR of ethylene glycol decreased in the following order:</p>
<p>The selectivity of these catalysts for H2 production decreased in the following order:</p>
<p>Further studies showed that catalysts consisting of Pt supported on alumina, carbon and titania were more active by over one order of magnitude compared to Pt supported on silica for H2 production by APR of ethylene glycol.</p>
<p>To study catalyst stability the data were collected at 453 K first, then at 423, 483 K and then again at 453 K for the PtFe and PdFe catalysts.</p>

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling the production of hydrogen from renewable biomass sources without generating additional CO2 emissions. This is achieved by utilizing the biomass-derived oxygenates' ability to undergo reforming reactions that consume CO2. The APR process offers several key advantages over traditional methods:

   - **Product Yield**: APR processes can yield hydrogen with low CO levels, which reduces the complexity of purification steps required for hydrogen production.
   
   - **Environmental Impact**: By consuming CO2 during reforming, APR processes can contribute to carbon neutrality, aligning with sustainable energy goals. This contrasts with traditional steam reforming, which requires substantial energy inputs to convert fossil fuels into hydrogen, often leading to higher CO2 emissions.
   
   - **Practical Implementation**: APR processes are liquid-phase reactions, eliminating the need for vaporization of aqueous feedstocks. This can improve overall thermal efficiency and simplify industrial implementation compared to vapor phase reforming processes that require higher temperatures and energy inputs.

2. The key advantages of APR processes compared to traditional methods in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation are:

   - **Product Yield**: APR processes enable the production of hydrogen with lower CO levels, simplifying purification steps.
   
   - **Environmental Impact**: By consuming CO2 during reforming, APR processes offer a pathway towards carbon neutrality, which is crucial for sustainable energy and chemical production.
   
   - **Practical Implementation**: APR processes are inherently more thermally efficient due to their liquid-phase nature, reducing energy requirements and potentially lowering operational costs. Additionally, avoiding the need for vaporization steps streamlines the process, making it more industrially viable.
