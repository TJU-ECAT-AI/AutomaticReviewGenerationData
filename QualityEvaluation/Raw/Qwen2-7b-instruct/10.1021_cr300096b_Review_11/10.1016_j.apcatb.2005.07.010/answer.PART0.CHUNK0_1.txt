<p>Initial HTR studies for APR of a 0.4 wt.% glycerol solution using 3 wt.% Pt/Al2O3 catalysts showed that at conversions lower than 40%, the quantity of H2 produced and glycerol conversion increase linearly with the amount of catalyst.</p>
<p>Another initial test of the HTR is shown in Fig. 2 in which silica-supported monometallic catalysts were screened for APR of an aqueous 5 wt.% ethylene glycol solution. This figure shows that methane is produced even when no catalyst is in the HTR well, and this product must be caused by reaction of the silicone rubber gasket with water.</p>
<p>Studies of Pt-bimetallic catalysts in the HTR show that addition of Ni, Co and Fe to 3 wt.% Pt/Al2O3 increases the catalytic activity for H2 production by two to three times on a mass basis, as shown in Fig. 3.</p>
<p>The addition of Ni to Pt/Al2O3 more than doubles the turnover frequency for H2 production ( ) for Pt1Ni1/Al2O3 compared to Pt/Al2O3, while maintaining high H2 selectivity ( Fig. 4 A).</p>
<p>Iron oxide is used commercially as a water-gas shift catalyst [12] . Also, Nanocat (Fe2O3, 250 m2/g) has previously been shown to have high activity for CO oxidation [13] . Catalysts consisting of metals (including Ni, Pt, Cu, Au, Co, Pd, Rh, Ir and Ru) supported on Nanocat were prepared and tested for APR of methanol in the HTR.</p>
<p>Palladium supported on Nanocat had the highest activity for APR of methanol of the monometallic/Fe2O3 catalysts. The only other metal that increased the activity of Fe2O3 for APR was Pt; however, Pt/Fe2O3 was only slightly more active than Fe2O3.</p>
<p>Iron has a promotional effect on both Pd and Pt catalysts, as shown in Table 2. The for Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 is three times higher than for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at temperatures ranging from 423 to 453 K. At a temperature of 498 K the values of for Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 are similar, giving activation energies of 82 and 98 kJ mol1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6.</p>
<p>In an attempt to develop more active catalysts for APR, we developed a reactor to rapidly screen catalysts for our aqueous-phase reaction conditions. In our traditional APR fixed bed reactor, one catalyst is tested in a 34 h period. This amount of time includes 10 h for the reduction and 24 h time-on stream. High-throughput testing of catalysts, in which multiple catalysts are tested in a single reactor system, is a common method to rapidly screen a large number of catalysts [14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] .</p>
<p>A general reaction scheme for APR of ethylene glycol has previously been proposed for Pt/Al2O3 catalysts [6] ,[7] . In this scheme, adsorbed ethylene glycol undergoes dehydrogenation on the surface followed by CC bond cleavage and water-gas shift to give CO2 and H2 products. Adsorption of ethylene glycol, water, H2 and CO2 are assumed to be in quasi-equilibrium.</p>
<p>Bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts have turnover frequencies for H2 production 1.52.8 times higher than monometallic Pt catalysts at 483 K. The activity per surface site for PtNi catalysts is highest at an atomic ratio of 1:1.</p>
<p>When Pd is added to high surface area Fe2O3, the catalyst has the highest activity per surface site of any catalyst tested in this study, as shown in Table 2.</p>

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing renewable biomass-derived molecules as feedstocks, producing hydrogen with minimal CO2 emissions, and enhancing overall thermal efficiency compared to traditional methods.

2. Key advantages include:
   - Increased product yield, especially H2, through efficient CC bond cleavage and water-gas shift reactions.
   - Reduced environmental impact due to no net CO2 production during hydrogen synthesis from renewable resources.
   - Practical implementation benefits from a single-phase reactor, eliminating the need for vaporization and improving thermal efficiency.

3. The activity of Pt-based catalysts for APR can be increased by alloying Pt with metals like Ni or Co, which reduces the interaction strengths of CO and hydrogen with the surface, leading to more available sites for ethylene glycol reaction.

4. The activity of Pd-based catalysts for APR can be enhanced by incorporating water-gas shift promoters such as Fe2O3, as these catalysts primarily limit their performance by the water-gas shift reaction.

5. Bimetallic catalysts demonstrate significantly higher activity than monometallic ones, particularly PtNi, PtCo, PtFe, and PdFe systems, showcasing the potential for enhanced catalytic performance in APR processes.

6. The synergy between metals like Fe and Pd can significantly boost catalytic activity, as seen in PdFe catalysts, which outperform PtFe systems and even monometallic catalysts, highlighting the importance of metal combination for optimal catalytic performance.

7. Alloying Pt with Ni, Co, or Fe can lower the heats of adsorption for CO and H2, leading to a decrease in surface coverage and an increase in the fraction of catalytic sites available for ethylene glycol reaction, thus improving overall activity per surface site.

8. The rate-determining step for APR on Pd-based catalysts is often attributed to the water-gas shift reaction, and adding a water-gas shift promoter like Fe2O3 can significantly improve the catalytic activity for APR, demonstrating the effectiveness of synergistic combinations in enhancing catalytic performance.

9. Bimetallic catalysts offer a significantly higher activity for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol compared to monometallic catalysts, suggesting a substantial potential for advancing sustainable hydrogen production technologies.
