<p>The APR process involves CC bond cleavage combined with water-gas shift in a single reactor producing low levels of CO (<1000 ppm), whereas conventional steam reforming of hydrocarbons requires a series of reactors for hydrogen production.</p>
<p>The desired reaction pathway for production of H2 by APR reactions involves cleavage of CC bonds as well as CH and/or OH bonds to form adsorbed species on the catalyst surface. Adsorbed CO must be removed from the catalyst surface by the water-gas shift reaction to form CO2 and H2, because high surface coverages by CO lead to low catalytic activity.</p>
<p>No net CO2 is produced in making H2 by APR of biomass resources (excluding CO2 made from fossil fuels during biomass production and transportation to a biorefinery).</p>
<p>The high-throughput reactor (HTR) consists of 48 wells machined into a rectangular stainless steel block. The wells are 6 mm i.d. with 2 and 11 mm spacing between each well hole.</p>
<p>The reaction was carried out by heating the reactor to the reaction temperature over 90 min and holding for 5 h, during which time the temperature gradient between wells was measured to be less than 1 K.</p>
<p>Another initial test of the HTR is shown in Fig. 2 in which silica-supported monometallic catalysts were screened for APR of an aqueous 5 wt.% ethylene glycol solution. This figure shows that methane is produced even when no catalyst is in the HTR well, and this product must be caused by reaction of the silicone rubber gasket with water.</p>
<p>Iron has a promotional effect on both Pd and Pt catalysts, as shown in Table 2. The TOF for Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 is three times higher than for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at temperatures ranging from 423 to 453 K.</p>
<p>In an attempt to develop more active catalysts for APR, we developed a reactor to rapidly screen catalysts for our aqueous-phase reaction conditions. In our traditional APR fixed bed reactor, one catalyst is tested in a 34 h period.</p>
<p>The results from the HTR for the PtNi and PtCo catalysts are in good agreement with data collected using a fixed bed reactor, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4, Fig. 5.</p>

1. The APR process combines CC bond cleavage and water-gas shift in a single reactor, producing low CO levels (under 1000 ppm), unlike conventional steam reforming of hydrocarbons which requires multiple reactors for hydrogen production.
2. The desired reaction pathway for APR involves breaking CC, CH, and/or OH bonds to create adsorbed species on the catalyst surface. Adsorbed CO is removed through the water-gas shift reaction to produce CO2 and H2, as high CO surface coverages hinder catalytic activity.
3. The APR process does not generate net CO2 emissions, considering CO2 produced during biomass production and transportation to a biorefinery is excluded.
4. The high-throughput reactor features 48 wells arranged in a rectangular stainless steel block, with 6 mm internal diameter wells spaced 2 and 11 mm apart.
5. The reaction in the high-throughput reactor was conducted by heating to the reaction temperature over 90 minutes, followed by a 5-hour hold, ensuring a temperature gradient of less than 1 K between wells.
6. Methane formation in the high-throughput reactor when no catalyst is present suggests it is caused by the reaction of the silicone rubber gasket with water.
7. Iron enhances the performance of both Pd and Pt catalysts, increasing the turnover frequency of Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 threefold compared to Pt/Al2O3 at temperatures from 423 to 453 K.
8. An effort was made to create a reactor for rapid screening of catalysts for aqueous-phase reaction conditions, where a traditional APR fixed bed reactor tests one catalyst over a 34-hour period.
9. The high-throughput reactor results for PtNi and PtCo catalysts align well with those obtained from a fixed bed reactor, as demonstrated in Table 1 and Figures 4, 5.

1. APR过程将CC键断裂与水煤气转换结合在一个反应器中，产生低水平的CO（低于1000 ppm），而传统的蒸汽重整烃类需要多个反应器生产氢气。
2. APR过程所需的反应途径涉及断开CC、CH和/或OH键，形成吸附在催化剂表面的物种。吸附的CO通过水煤气转换反应从催化剂表面去除，以生成CO2和H2，因为高CO表面覆盖度会降低催化活性。
3. APR过程不产生净CO2排放，考虑到在生物质生产过程中产生的CO2以及运输到生物炼油厂时产生的CO2已被排除在外。
4. 高通量反应器由矩形不锈钢块中的48个孔组成，每个孔内部直径为6毫米，孔间间距分别为2和11毫米。
5. 在高通量反应器中的反应通过在90分钟内加热至反应温度，然后保持5小时进行，确保各孔之间的温度梯度小于1 K。
6. 当没有催化剂存在时，在高通量反应器中形成的甲烷表明它是由硅橡胶垫与水反应引起的。
7. 铁对Pd和Pt催化剂具有促进作用，提高Pt1Fe9/Al2O3的转速频率三倍相比Pt/Al2O3催化剂，在423至453 K的温度范围内。
8. 为了快速筛选用于水相反应条件的催化剂，设计了一种反应器，传统的APR固定床反应器在一个周期内测试一个催化剂长达34小时。
9. 高通量反应器对于PtNi和PtCo催化剂的结果与使用固定床反应器收集的数据相符，如表1和图4、图5所示。
