<p>It is hard to measure the activity or selectivity of the Pd catalyst because it is so low.</p>
<p>The selectivity to H2 in the high throughput reactor decreases in the order:</p>
<p>The addition of Ni to Pt/Al2O3 more than doubles the turnover frequency for H2 production ( ) for Pt1Ni1/Al2O3 compared to Pt/Al2O3, while maintaining high H2 selectivity ( Fig. 4 A).</p>
<p>The value of for Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 was 1.2 and 2.63.3 times higher than Pt/Al2O3 at 483 and 453 K, respectively.</p>
<p>We suggest that alloying Pt with Ni, Co or Fe improves the activity for H2 production by lowering the d-band center, which causes a decrease in the heats of CO and hydrogen adsorption, thereby increasing the fraction of the surface available for reaction with ethylene glycol.</p>

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing renewable biomass resources. Its key advantages over traditional methods include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to no net CO2 production (excluding CO2 from biomass production and transportation), improved thermal efficiency, and the ability to produce hydrogen directly from liquid feedstocks without vaporization steps.

2. The high-throughput reactor (HTR) enables rapid screening of catalysts under aqueous-phase reforming conditions. It can test multiple catalysts simultaneously, reducing the time needed to identify more active catalysts. The HTR maintains high pressures and operates at high temperatures, simulating real-world conditions for efficient hydrogen production.

3. Bimetallic Pt catalysts with Ni, Co, or Fe additives show significantly enhanced activity for hydrogen production by selective oxygenate reforming. The addition of Ni or Co to Pt catalysts increases the number of catalytic sites, allowing more ethylene glycol molecules to react. Fe addition to Pt catalysts also enhances activity, possibly due to its role in lowering the heats of CO and hydrogen adsorption, increasing the fraction of surface sites available for ethylene glycol reaction.

4. PdFe catalysts exhibit high activity for hydrogen production through selective oxygenate reforming. Iron acts as a water-gas shift promoter, improving the activity of Pd catalysts. The synergy between Pd and Fe2O3 leads to high intrinsic activity, particularly at high temperatures, where the catalysts can produce hydrogen at rates near or above 600 μmol/min/gcat.

5. The activity of Pt-based catalysts for selective oxygenate reforming can be increased by alloying Pt with metals like Ni, Co, or Fe. These additions lower the heats of CO and hydrogen adsorption, reducing their surface coverage and making more catalytic sites accessible for ethylene glycol reaction. The rate-determining step for APR on Pd-based catalysts is identified as the water-gas shift reaction, and adding a water-gas shift promoter like Fe2O3 can significantly enhance the catalytic activity for APR.

1. 选择性氧化物重整过程通过利用生物质资源为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。其相对于传统方法的关键优势包括更高的产品产量，减少了环境影响（不产生净二氧化碳，除了生物质生产和运输产生的二氧化碳），提高了热效率，并能够直接从液态原料中生产氢气，无需蒸馏步骤。

2. 高通量反应器（HTR）使在液相重整条件下快速筛选催化剂成为可能。它可以同时测试多个催化剂，大大缩短了识别更高效催化剂所需的时间。HTR能够在高压和高温下运行，模拟实际条件以实现高效的氢气生成。

3. 添加镍、钴或铁到铂基催化剂中的双金属铂催化剂显示出显著增强的氢生成能力。向铂催化剂添加镍或钴可以增加催化位点的数量，允许更多的乙二醇分子进行反应。向铂催化剂添加铁也可以增强活性，可能是因为它降低了二氧化碳和氢的吸附热，增加了表面位点用于乙二醇反应的比例。

4. 铂铁催化剂（PdFe）在选择性氧化物重整过程中表现出高活性。铁作为水-气体转换促进剂，可以提高钯催化剂的活性。钯和铁2O3之间的协同作用导致了高内在活性，尤其是在高温下，催化剂可以在接近或超过每克催化剂每分钟600微摩尔的氢生成率。

5. 对于选择性氧化物重整过程中的钯基催化剂，通过合金化钯与镍、钴或铁可以增加其活性。这些添加降低了二氧化碳和氢的吸附热，减少了它们在表面的覆盖率，使得更多的催化位点可用于乙二醇反应。决定Pd基催化剂中 APR 过程速率的步骤被确定为水-气体转换反应，而添加水-气体转换促进剂如Fe2O3可以显着增强 APR 的催化活性。
