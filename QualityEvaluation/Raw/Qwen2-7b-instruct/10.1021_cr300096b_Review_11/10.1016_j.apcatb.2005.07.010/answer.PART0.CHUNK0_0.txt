<p>Aqueous-phase reforming (APR) of ethylene glycol solutions using a high-throughput reactor was conducted to screen for hydrogen production. Promising catalysts were characterized by CO chemisorption and tested further in a fixed bed reactor.</p>
<p>Monometallic Pt and Pd catalysts showed lower activity and turnover frequencies for hydrogen production compared to bimetallic PtNi, PtCo, PtFe, and PdFe catalysts. The PtNi/Al2O3 and PtCo/Al2O3 catalysts had values equal to 2.85.2 min<sup>-1</sup> at 483 K for APR of ethylene glycol solutions, compared to 1.9 min<sup>-1</sup> for Pt/Al2O3 under similar conditions. A Pt1Fe9/Al2O3 catalyst showed values of 0.34.3 min<sup>-1</sup> at 453483 K, about three times higher than Pt/Al2O3 under identical conditions.</p>
<p>Pd1Fe9/Al2O3 catalysts had values of 1.4 and 4.3 min<sup>-1</sup> at temperatures of 453 and 483 K, respectively, 3946 times higher than Pd/Al2O3 at the same conditions. Catalysts consisting of Pd supported on high surface area Fe2O3 (Nanocat) showed the highest turnover frequencies for H2 production among those tested, with values of 14.6, 39.1, and 60.1 min<sup>-1</sup> at temperatures of 453, 483, and 498 K, respectively.</p>
<p>The activity of Pt-based catalysts for APR can be increased by alloying Pt with a metal (Ni or Co) that decreases the strengths with which CO and hydrogen interact with the surface, thereby increasing the fraction of catalytic sites available for reaction with ethylene glycol. The activity of Pd-based catalysts for APR can be increased by adding a water-gas shift promoter (e.g., Fe2O3).</p>

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling the production of hydrogen from renewable biomass sources, avoiding the release of CO2 during the reforming process. This method has several key advantages over traditional methods:

   - **Product Yield**: The APR process yields low levels of CO (<1000 ppm), making it more efficient in producing hydrogen compared to conventional steam reforming of hydrocarbons which requires multiple reactors for hydrogen production.
   
   - **Environmental Impact**: Since the APR process uses renewable biomass resources, it significantly reduces the carbon footprint associated with hydrogen production. This is because the CO2 formed during reforming is consumed by further biomass growth, ensuring a net-zero CO2 emission in the process.
   
   - **Practical Implementation**: The APR process occurs in the liquid phase, eliminating the need for vaporizing the aqueous feedstock. This feature improves the overall thermal efficiency of the process, making it more practical and cost-effective compared to traditional methods that require additional steps for vaporization.
   
   - **Versatility in Feedstocks**: APR can utilize various renewable oxygenated molecules derived from biomass, such as ethylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, etc., providing flexibility in feedstock selection and enhancing the sustainability of the hydrogen production process.
   
   - **Efficiency in Catalysis**: The use of bimetallic catalysts, particularly PtNi, PtCo, PtFe, and PdFe, has been shown to significantly enhance the activity and turnover frequency for hydrogen production compared to monometallic catalysts, leading to more efficient and faster hydrogen production rates.
   
   - **Synergistic Effects**: Alloying Pt with metals like Ni, Co, or Fe can lower the heats of CO and hydrogen adsorption, thereby increasing the fraction of the surface available for reaction with ethylene glycol, thus improving the overall activity of the catalyst per surface site.
   
   - **Promotion of Water-Gas Shift Reaction**: Adding water-gas shift promoters like Fe2O3 to Pd-based catalysts can significantly improve the catalytic activity for APR by accelerating the water-gas shift reaction, which is often the rate-determining step in APR processes involving Pd catalysts.

1. 选择性氧源重整过程通过利用可再生生物质资源生产氢气，避免了重整过程中CO2的排放，从而为可持续能源和化学生产做出贡献。这种方法在以下方面具有传统方法无可比拟的优势：

   - **产品产量**：与常规蒸汽重整烃类相比，APR过程产生的氢气量更高，因为其仅产生低水平的CO（<1000ppm），这使得APR过程在氢气生产效率上更胜一筹。
   
   - **环境影响**：由于使用可再生生物质资源，APR过程显著减少了与氢气生产相关的碳足迹。在重整过程中产生的CO2被进一步生长的生物质吸收，确保了整个过程的净零CO2排放。
   
   - **实施可行性**：APR过程发生在液体相中，无需蒸发水溶液基质。这一特性提高了过程的整体热效率，使其在成本效益和实施性方面相较于传统方法更具优势。
   
   - **灵活的原料选择**：APR可以利用来自生物质的各种可再生氧源分子，如乙二醇、甘油、山梨醇等，提供了原料选择的灵活性，并增强了氢气生产过程的可持续性。
   
   - **催化剂活性提升**：使用PtNi、PtCo、PtFe和PdFe等双金属催化剂显著提高了氢气生产的活性和周转频率，与单金属催化剂相比，这导致了更快的氢气生产速率。
   
   - **协同效应**：将Pt与Ni、Co或Fe合金化可以降低CO和氢吸附的热量，从而增加表面可用于与乙二醇反应的催化位点的比例，从而提高催化剂每表面积单位的总体活性。
   
   - **促进水煤气变换反应**：向Pd基催化剂添加水煤气变换促进剂如Fe2O3可以显著提高APR的催化活性，通过加速水煤气变换反应，该反应通常是涉及Pd催化剂的APR过程中的决定性步骤。
