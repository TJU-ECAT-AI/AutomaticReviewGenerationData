[1] "Adding tin to platinum catalysts has proven to be beneficial for activity maintenance in applications such as catalytic reforming."
[2] "The differences in hydrogen and oxygen gas uptake behavior can be attributed to the different equilibration times provided by the two chemisorption methods."
[3] "The H/Pt ratio, on the other hand, reached the maximum value at 0.1 wt.% Sn."
[4] "Pulse chemisorption was then used to evaluate how the preparation method affects platinum dispersion and chemisorption behavior."
[5] "Coimpregnation of the Al2O3 support with platinum and small amounts of tin facilitates high Pt dispersion, while sequential impregnation of the support with Sn first, followed by Pt, leads to much lower Pt dispersion."
[6] "In the tin containing catalysts, the O/Pt ratios obtained are consistently higher than the H/Pt ratios, showing a trend towards enhanced oxygen uptake with increasing Sn content."

1. The addition of tin to platinum catalysts improves their performance in maintaining activity in applications like catalytic reforming.

2. The discrepancies in hydrogen and oxygen gas absorption can be attributed to the varying equilibration periods provided by the two chemisorption techniques.

3. The H/Pt ratio peaks at 0.1 wt.% Sn content.

4. Pulse chemisorption was employed to assess how the preparation process impacts platinum dispersion and chemisorption dynamics.

5. Coimpregnation of the alumina support with platinum and a small amount of tin enhances platinum dispersion, surpassing that of monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with similar platinum loading. 

6. In catalysts containing tin, the O/Pt ratio consistently surpasses the H/Pt ratio, indicating enhanced oxygen uptake as tin content increases.
