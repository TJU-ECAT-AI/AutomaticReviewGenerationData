<p>In the sequentially impregnated catalysts, the effect of tin loading on enhanced oxygen uptake was much less pronounced as compared to the coimpregnated catalyst series (Fig. 4). On the catalyst sample with very large Sn content (1.0 wt.% Pt5.0 wt.% Sn/Al2O3), the uptakes of both oxygen and hydrogen were very low indicating low dispersion of platinum.</p>
<p>High resolution electron microscopy and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy results showed a certain proportion of the metal particles were somewhat larger and there was evidence of the formation of PtSn alloy in the sequentially impregnated catalysts [25].</p>
<p>It appears that oxygen adsorbed on highly dispersed platinum particles can spillover onto tinaluminate complex situating the nearby platinum atoms, thus causing larger O/Pt ratios than H/Pt ratios in the bimetallic catalysts with high Pt dispersion. This explanation is also consistent with the XPS analysis of the coimpregnated catalyst series with high Pt dispersion, indicating that in the reduced alumina-supported PtSn catalysts, Sn is primarily present in a state of Sn(II) or Sn(IV) [8].</p>

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting oxygenates into desired products with minimal side reactions and waste generation. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to minimized emissions, and improved operational efficiency compared to traditional methods. Traditional processes often involve more energy-intensive steps, higher raw material consumption, and produce more byproducts that require further treatment or disposal. Selective oxygenate reforming optimizes the use of oxygenates, which are abundant in biomass and fossil sources, leading to cleaner and more efficient chemical synthesis pathways. This not only enhances the sustainability of the chemical industry but also opens up new avenues for renewable resource utilization in chemical production.
