<p>In the sequentially impregnated catalysts, the effect of tin loading on enhanced oxygen uptake was much less pronounced as compared to the coimpregnated catalyst series (Fig. 4).</p>
<p>On the catalyst sample with very large Sn content (1.0 wt.% Pt5.0 wt.% Sn/Al2O3), the uptakes of both oxygen and hydrogen were very low indicating low dispersion of platinum.</p>
<p>High resolution electron microscopy and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy results showed a certain proportion of the metal particles were somewhat larger and there was evidence of the formation of PtSn alloy in the sequentially impregnated catalysts [25].</p>
