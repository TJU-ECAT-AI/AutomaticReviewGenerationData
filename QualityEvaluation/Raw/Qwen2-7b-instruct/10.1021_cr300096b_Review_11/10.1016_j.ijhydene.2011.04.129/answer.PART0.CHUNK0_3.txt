[1] "FCs have the potential to double the efficiency of electric power generation in conventional engines, with a concomitant reduction in CO2 emissions."
[2] "Nickel (Ni) catalysts are used industrially in CH4 steam reforming (MSR) to produce H2, and good catalytic performance has also been demonstrated in ATR of EtOH."
[3] "In our previous studies on ATR of various hydrocarbons and commercial low-sulfur diesel, these noble metal catalysts proved to be active and selective for H2 production."
[4] "The results were compared with those obtained on a commercial steam reforming catalyst (15 wt-% NiO/Al2O3)."
[5] "The formation of carbonaceous deposits was lower on the noble metal catalysts than on the commercial NiO/Al2O3 catalyst."
[6] "Thus, the Rh-containing catalysts are more suitable than the commercial NiO/Al2O3 catalysts for the ATR of ethanol."
[7] "The performance of the noble metal catalysts was compared with that of a commercial catalyst (15 wt-% NiO/Al2O3) and to the ZrO2 support alone."
[8] "The interaction of Rh and Pt in the bimetallic RhPt/ZrO2 catalyst improved the stability over that of the monometallic Rh/ZrO2 catalyst as demonstrated in 24 h experiments where the production of H2 was stable."
[9] "Furthermore, Cs was lower on mono-and bimetallic catalysts than on the commercial NiO/Al2O3 catalyst."
[10] "Our results indicate that the noble metal catalysts, especially Rh-containing ones, are suitable catalysts for the ATR of ethanol."
