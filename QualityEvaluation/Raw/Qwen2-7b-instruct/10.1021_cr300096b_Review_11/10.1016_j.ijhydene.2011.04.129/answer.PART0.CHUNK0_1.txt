[1] "FCs have the potential to double the efficiency of electric power generation in conventional engines, with a concomitant reduction in CO2 emissions."
[2] "Synthesis gas can be used in the production of high-quality ultra-clean chemicals and fuels by e.g. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or as fuel for FCs."
[3] "Nickel (Ni) catalysts are used industrially in CH4 steam reforming (MSR) to produce H2, and good catalytic performance has also been demonstrated in ATR of EtOH."
[4] "However, there is still room for new catalysts less prone to form Cs."
[5] "The aim of this work was to investigate the suitability of mono- and bimetallic ZrO2-supported Rh- and Pt-based catalysts (total metal loading 0.5 wt-%) in the ATR of EtOH."
[6] "The results were compared with those obtained on a commercial steam reforming catalyst (15 wt-% NiO/Al2O3)."
[7] "The Rh-containing catalysts exhibited the highest selectivity for H2 production and were stable in 24 h experiments."
[8] "The formation of carbonaceous deposits was lower on the noble metal catalysts than on the commercial NiO/Al2O3 catalyst."
[9] "Thus, the Rh-containing catalysts are more suitable than the commercial NiO/Al2O3 catalysts for the ATR of ethanol."
[10] "Autothermal reforming is advantageous because carbonaceous deposits (Cs) are significantly inhibited by the presence of oxidation reactions."
[11] "As water is a reactant in SR and ATR, the total water separation might not be needed after the fermentation process of bio-EtOH."
[12] "The presence of CH4 in the feed is desirable, too, as CH4 can be reformedin internally in the SOFC which is simultaneously cooling down the SOFC."
[13] "The use of ethanol (EtOH) for H2 production is highly attractive. EtOH has advantages of low toxicity, low production costs, and high H2 content."
[14] "Bio-EtOH is regarded as particularly promising owing to the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and replace fossil fuels with renewable ones."
[15] "Synthesis gas can be used in the production of high-quality ultra-clean chemicals and fuels by e.g. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or as fuel for FCs."
[16] "Nickel (Ni) catalysts are used industrially in CH4 steam reforming (MSR) to produce H2, and good catalytic performance has also been demonstrated in ATR of EtOH."
[17] "The use of noble metal catalysts in particular is more active and stable than Ni catalysts in reforming reactions, with Rh being one of the most effective noble metals."
[18] "Because the price of noble metal catalysts is a serious drawback to their use in industrial applications, low metal loadings (<1 atomic-%) and new metals and combinations of metals are of great interest."
[19] "In addition, they possess high thermal stability."
[20] "The performance of the noble metal catalysts was compared with that of a commercial catalyst (15 wt-% NiO/Al2O3) and to the ZrO2 support alone."
[21] "The interaction of Rh and Pt in the bimetallic RhPt/ZrO2 catalyst improved the stability over that of the monometallic Rh/ZrO2 catalyst as demonstrated in 24 h experiments where the production of H2 was stable."
[22] "Furthermore, Cs was lower on mono- and bimetallic catalysts than on the commercial NiO/Al2O3 catalyst."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by doubling the efficiency of electric power generation, reducing CO2 emissions, and enabling the production of high-quality ultra-clean chemicals and fuels through processes like Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or as fuel for fuel cells (FCs).

2. Key advantages of selective oxygenate reforming include:
   - Higher product yields due to the efficient conversion of oxygenates into hydrogen and synthesis gas.
   - Lower environmental impact because of reduced CO2 emissions and the potential for renewable feedstocks like ethanol.
   - Improved practical implementation due to the ability to use existing infrastructure for hydrogen production and the potential for integrating hydrogen into fuel cell systems, thereby enhancing energy efficiency.

3. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers:
   - Enhanced selectivity for hydrogen production, leading to higher yields of desired products like hydrogen and synthesis gas.
   - Reduced formation of carbonaceous deposits, which can clog reactors and reduce efficiency in traditional reforming processes.
   - Improved stability of catalysts, particularly those based on noble metals like rhodium (Rh) and platinum (Pt), which are more active and stable than common industrial catalysts like nickel (Ni).
   - Potential for lower cost through the use of lower metal loadings and alternative metals like palladium (Pd), which can improve economic viability and sustainability of the reforming process.
   - Compatibility with renewable feedstocks like ethanol, which can be produced from biomass and thus contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
