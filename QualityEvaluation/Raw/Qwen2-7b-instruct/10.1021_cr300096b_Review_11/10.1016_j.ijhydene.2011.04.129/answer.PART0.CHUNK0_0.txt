<p>Autothermal reforming of ethanol on noble metal catalysts was studied as a source of H2-rich gas for fuel cells.</p>
<p>The results were compared with those obtained on a commercial steam reforming catalyst (15 wt-% NiO/Al2O3).</p>
<p>The Rh-containing catalysts exhibited the highest selectivity for H2 production and were stable in 24 h experiments.</p>
<p>The formation of carbonaceous deposits was lower on the noble metal catalysts than on the commercial NiO/Al2O3 catalyst.</p>
<p>Noble metal catalysts in particular are more active and stable than Ni catalysts in reforming reactions, with Rh being one of the most effective noble metals.</p>
<p>The aim of this work was to investigate the suitability of mono- and bimetallic ZrO2-supported Rh- and Pt-based catalysts (total metal loading 0.5 wt-%) in the ATR of EtOH.</p>
<p>The performance of the noble metal catalysts was compared with that of a commercial catalyst (15 wt-% NiO/Al2O3) and to the ZrO2 support alone.</p>
<p>In our previous studies on ATR of various hydrocarbons and commercial low-sulfur diesel, these noble metal catalysts proved to be active and selective for H2 production.</p>
<p>The thermodynamic calculations were used to determine the reaction conditions needed to achieve thermoneutrality and to predict the thermodynamic equilibrium composition in the studied temperature range.</p>
<p>The thermodynamic equilibrium for H2 concentration was not achieved in experiments where the conversion was incomplete (Pt/ZrO2, ZrO2 and non-catalytic).</p>
<p>The production of CO increased with temperature, and values close to thermodynamic equilibrium were approached in all the experiments.</p>
<p>The production of CH4 reached a maximum at 200 C and was negligible above 700 C where MSR takes place.</p>
<p>The production of CH4 was highest with the noble metal catalysts (close to 11 mol-%).</p>

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by providing an efficient and environmentally friendly method for hydrogen generation, which is crucial for fuel cells and the production of high-quality ultra-clean chemicals and fuels. Its key advantages include high product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower carbon emissions, and practical implementation through the use of renewable feedstocks like ethanol.

2. Noble metal catalysts, especially rhodium (Rh)-based ones, exhibit superior activity and stability in reforming reactions compared to nickel (Ni) catalysts. They are particularly suitable for the autothermal reforming (ATR) of ethanol, offering high selectivity for hydrogen production with minimal formation of side products. The use of rhodium in conjunction with palladium (Pd) in bimetallic catalysts further improves stability over monometallic rhodium catalysts.

3. In comparison to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming utilizes renewable resources, reduces energy consumption, and minimizes waste generation. The ability to operate at lower temperatures with less energy input makes it more cost-effective and sustainable. Additionally, the formation of carbonaceous deposits (Cs) is lower on noble metal catalysts, contributing to longer catalyst life and reduced maintenance requirements.

4. The autothermal reforming of ethanol on noble metal catalysts offers a promising alternative to conventional steam reforming processes. It provides a more efficient and sustainable route for hydrogen production, enabling cleaner energy solutions and facilitating the transition towards renewable energy sources. The use of ZrO2-supported Rh and Pt catalysts demonstrates high performance in terms of hydrogen yield and selectivity, making them suitable for various applications in the chemical industry and fuel cell technology.

1. 选择性氧化物重整为可持续能源和化学生产提供了高效且环境友好的氢气生成方法，对于燃料电池以及高质量超清洁化学品和燃料的生产至关重要。其关键优势包括高产品产率、由于较低碳排放而减少的环境影响，以及通过利用可再生能源（如乙醇）实现的实施可行性。

2. 特别是铑（Rh）基催化剂在重整反应中的活性和稳定性优于镍（Ni）催化剂。它们特别适合乙醇的自热重整（ATR），提供高氢产量，并且侧产品的形成最少。在铑与钯（Pd）的双金属催化剂中结合使用进一步提高了单金属铑催化剂的稳定性。

3. 相比传统方法，选择性氧化物重整利用可再生资源、减少了能量消耗，并且减少了废物生成。在较低温度下以更少的能量输入运行的能力使其更具成本效益和可持续性。此外，碳质沉积物（Cs）在贵金属催化剂上的形成较少，有助于延长催化剂寿命并降低维护需求。

4. 乙醇在贵金属催化剂上的自热重整提供了一种有前景的替代传统的蒸汽重整过程。它提供了一个更高效、更可持续的氢气生产途径，能够促进清洁能源解决方案，并加速向可再生能源的过渡。使用ZrO2支持的Rh和Pt催化剂显示了在氢产量和选择性方面表现出色，使其适用于化工行业和燃料电池技术的各种应用。
