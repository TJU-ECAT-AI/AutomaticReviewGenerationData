[1] "Environmental problems arising from the extensive use of fossil fuels and dwindling petroleum reserves have increased the search for diverse energy sources."
[2] "Ethanol is a renewable resource that is easier to store, safer to handle and transport owing to its lower toxicity and volatility compared to methanol."
[3] "Steam reforming (SR) has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production among other alternatives such as partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming; the only inconvenience is its highly endothermic nature."
[4] "The reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons (methanol and ethanol) requires considerably less energy per mole of H2 formed than the reforming of saturated hydrocarbons and produces mostly CO2."
[5] "Ethanol SR proceeds at higher temperatures (350900 C) compared to methanol SR (200400 C) on account of its CC bond, and at relatively high water-to-ethanol ratios."
[6] "Base metals such as Ni, Co, NiCu and noble metals such as Pt, Pd and Rh over appropriate supports show potential for ethanol SR, and the main problems to be tackled are byproduct formation and coke deposition."
[7] "Ethanol SR performance of 0.3 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni/δ-Al2O3 is better in terms of both ethanol conversion and selectivity towards hydrogen production up to 773 K."
[8] "The power-function rate expression proposed on the basis of an extensive kinetic study for determining intrinsic reaction rates at 723 K from integral reactor data under conditions extending up to about 70% ethanol conversion has reaction orders of 1.01 and 0.09 in ethanol and steam partial pressures, respectively, and can reliably be used for simulating ethanol SR or the SR component of ethanol ATR."
[9] "The apparent activation energy of ethanol steam reforming over 0.3 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni/δ-Al2O3 in the 673823 K interval is calculated as 59.3  2.3 kJ mol1."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several key ways:

1. **Renewable Resource Utilization**: Ethanol, as a renewable resource, offers an environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels. Its lower toxicity and volatility make it safer to handle and transport compared to methanol.

2. **Efficient Hydrogen Production**: Steam reforming of oxygenates like ethanol has a high efficiency for hydrogen production, which is crucial for reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This process requires less energy per mole of hydrogen produced compared to reforming saturated hydrocarbons.

3. **High Temperature Requirement**: Ethanol reforming operates at higher temperatures than methanol reforming, due to its chemical structure. This necessitates specific temperature control and equipment design.

4. **Byproduct Management**: Selective oxygenate reforming faces challenges like byproduct formation and coke deposition. However, catalysts containing metals like nickel, copper, palladium, and rhodium offer potential solutions by efficiently converting oxygenates to hydrogen while minimizing unwanted side products.

5. **Kinetic Analysis and Rate Expressions**: Through kinetic studies, researchers have developed power-function rate expressions to accurately predict reaction rates under various conditions. This aids in optimizing the reforming process and simulating complex scenarios like auto-thermal reforming.

6. **Activation Energy Calculation**: The calculation of the apparent activation energy provides insights into the energy barrier for the reforming reaction. A lower activation energy means a more favorable reaction rate, contributing to more efficient hydrogen production.

In summary, selective oxygenate reforming, particularly with ethanol, presents a promising avenue for sustainable energy production through hydrogen, offering environmental benefits and technical advancements in catalyst development and kinetic modeling.

选择性氧化物重整在可持续能源和化学生产中发挥了重要作用：

1. **可再生资源利用**：乙醇作为一种可再生能源，为替代化石燃料提供了环保的选择。与甲醇相比，其较低的毒性与挥发性使其更安全、易于储存和运输。

2. **高效氢生产**：氧气化物（如乙醇）的蒸汽重整在氢气生产效率方面具有高度优势，对于减少空气污染和温室气体排放至关重要。与饱和烃的重整相比，氧气化物重整每摩尔氢气产生的能量需求更低，并主要产生二氧化碳。

3. **高温度要求**：乙醇重整在高于甲醇重整的温度下进行，这归因于其化学结构。这需要特定的温度控制和设备设计。

4. **副产品管理**：选择性氧化物重整面临副产品形成和焦炭沉积等挑战。然而，含有镍、铜、钯和铑等金属的催化剂提供了有效将氧气化物转化为氢气的同时，最小化不希望的副产品的可能性。

5. **动力学分析和速率表达式**：通过动力学研究，研究人员开发了幂函数速率表达式来准确预测不同条件下的反应速率。这有助于优化重整过程并模拟复杂的场景，如自热重整。

6. **激活能计算**：激活能的计算提供了反应能垒的见解，这意味着较低的激活能意味着更快的反应速率，从而促进更高效的氢气生产。

综上所述，选择性氧化物重整，特别是以乙醇为例，为通过氢气生产提供了一条有前景的可持续能源途径，既带来了环境效益，又促进了催化剂发展和动力学建模的技术进步。
