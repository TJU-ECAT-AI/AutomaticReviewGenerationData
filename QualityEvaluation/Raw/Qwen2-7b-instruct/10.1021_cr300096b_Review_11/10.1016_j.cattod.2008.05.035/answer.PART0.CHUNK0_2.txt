<p>Although natural gas, LPG, gasoline and methanol are generally regarded as the sources for hydrogen, ethanol has also attracted some attention in recent years.</p>
<p>Chemical storage of hydrogen in liquid fuels is considered to be an advantageous option for delivering hydrogen.</p>
<p>Steam reforming (SR) has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production among other alternatives such as partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming; the only inconvenience is its highly endothermic nature.</p>
<p>Recent reviews of ethanol SR emphasize the significant effects of the type of catalyst, method of catalyst preparation and reaction conditions on ethanol conversion, hydrogen production and product distribution.</p>
<p>The reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons (methanol and ethanol) requires considerably less energy per mole of H2 formed than the reforming of saturated hydrocarbons and produces mostly CO2.</p>
<p>Investigation of hydrogen production from ethanol is fairly new. Ethanol SR proceeds at higher temperatures (350900 C) compared to methanol SR (200400 C) on account of its CC bond, and at relatively high water-to-ethanol ratios.</p>
<p>Side products observed on Ni-based catalysts are mainly CH4 and COx formed by ethanol SR with methane production, ethanol decomposition, methane SR or methanation depending on the reaction temperature.</p>
<p>PtNi catalysts are efficient for the auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of hydrocarbon feeds and are potential candidates for energy efficient commercial processes.</p>

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy by providing a renewable resource for hydrogen production, reducing air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Its key advantages include higher efficiency in hydrogen production compared to other alternatives, lower energy requirements for reforming oxygenated hydrocarbons, and the ability to produce hydrogen using renewable resources like ethanol. This reduces dependency on fossil fuels and decreases environmental impacts. Moreover, the use of ethanol as a hydrogen carrier offers benefits in storage, handling, and transportation due to its lower toxicity and volatility compared to methanol.

2. The steam reforming of ethanol over PtNi/δ-Al2O3 catalysts shows improved ethanol conversion and hydrogen production capabilities, especially at higher temperatures. The bimetallic catalysts with 0.3 wt% Pt and 15 wt% Ni loading demonstrate superior performance in terms of ethanol conversion and selectivity towards hydrogen production up to 773 K. The power-function rate expression obtained for ethanol steam reforming provides reliable data for simulating the reaction under various conditions. The apparent activation energy of 59.3 ± 2.3 kJ mol−1 indicates the energy barrier for the reaction, which is crucial for understanding the kinetics and optimizing the reaction conditions.

3. The investigation of hydrogen production from ethanol involves studying the effects of catalyst type, preparation method, and reaction conditions on ethanol conversion, hydrogen yield, and product distribution. The reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons, like ethanol, requires less energy per mole of hydrogen produced compared to saturated hydrocarbons, making it a more efficient hydrogen production method. This is particularly advantageous when considering the environmental benefits and the potential for using renewable resources.

4. The use of PtNi catalysts in auto-thermal reforming (ATR) processes is highlighted for their efficiency in reforming hydrocarbon feeds, making them promising candidates for energy-efficient commercial applications. The combination of total oxidation and steam reforming in ATR eliminates the need for an external heat source, enhancing the overall energy efficiency of the process. Additionally, the ability to regenerate the catalyst at low temperatures ensures operational flexibility and cost-effectiveness.

5. The study of deactivation and regeneration mechanisms, such as carbon formation and its subsequent regeneration, is crucial for understanding the long-term stability and performance of catalysts in hydrogen production processes. This knowledge helps in designing catalysts that can withstand harsh operating conditions and maintain high efficiency over extended periods.

6. The development of kinetic models for ethanol steam reforming, such as the power-function rate expression, enables the simulation of the reaction under various conditions, including different ethanol and steam partial pressures. Accurate kinetic parameters, like the activation energy and reaction orders, are essential for predicting the behavior of the reforming process and optimizing the reaction conditions for maximum efficiency and yield.

7. The selection of suitable PtNi catalysts with optimized compositions leads to enhanced performance in ethanol steam reforming, resulting in higher ethanol conversion rates and improved selectivity towards hydrogen production. The results of kinetic studies provide insights into the reaction mechanism and kinetics, which are critical for the design and optimization of fuel processors and ATR units.
