[1] "Environmental problems arising from the extensive use of fossil fuels and dwindling petroleum reserves have increased the search for diverse energy sources."
[2] "Among the alternatives at hand, the use of hydrogen as a fuel is projected to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions significantly, and the proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell fuelled by pure hydrogen is currently the leading candidate for various stationary and mobile applications."
[3] "Although natural gas, LPG, gasoline and methanol are generally regarded as the sources for hydrogen, ethanol has also attracted some attention in recent years."
[4] "Ethanol is a renewable resource that is easier to store, safer to handle and transport owing to its lower toxicity and volatility compared to methanol."
[5] "Chemical storage of hydrogen in liquid fuels is considered to be an advantageous option for delivering hydrogen."
[6] "Steam reforming (SR) has the highest efficiency for hydrogen production among other alternatives such as partial oxidation or auto-thermal reforming; the only inconvenience is its highly endothermic nature."
[7] "The reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons (methanol and ethanol) requires considerably less energy per mole of H2 formed than the reforming of saturated hydrocarbons and produces mostly CO2."
[8] "Investigation of hydrogen production from ethanol is fairly new."
[9] "Ethanol SR proceeds at higher temperatures (350900 C) compared to methanol SR (200400 C) on account of its CC bond, and at relatively high water-to-ethanol ratios."
[10] "Recent reviews of ethanol SR emphasize the significant effects of the type of catalyst, method of catalyst preparation and reaction conditions on ethanol conversion, hydrogen production and product distribution."
[11] "Base metals such as Ni, Co, NiCu and noble metals such as Pt, Pd and Rh over appropriate supports show potential for ethanol SR, and the main problems to be tackled are byproduct formation and coke deposition."
[12] "Reports on intrinsic kinetics of ethanol SR over Ni and Ru catalysts include power-law rate expressions where ethanol consumption rate is first order with respect to ethanol and independent of steam."
[13] "PtNi catalysts are efficient for the auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of hydrocarbon feeds and are potential candidates for energy efficient commercial processes."
[14] "Ethanol SR experiments over 0.2 wt%Pt15 wt%Ni/δ-Al2O3 at 673823 K demonstrated that the bimetallic catalyst was resistant to carbon formation even at water-to-ethanol ratios as low as 3.0."
[15] "The present work contains a series of experiments conducted over PtNi/δ-Al2O3 catalysts with different Pt and Ni contents in order to select the most suitable PtNi catalyst on which ethanol SR proceeds well and is coupled with a kinetic study to extract the rate expression for describing ethanol SR kinetics in the simulation of ATR units of fuel processors."
