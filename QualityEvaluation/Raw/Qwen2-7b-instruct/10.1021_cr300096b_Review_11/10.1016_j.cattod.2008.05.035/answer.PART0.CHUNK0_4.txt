<p>The reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons (methanol and ethanol) requires considerably less energy per mole of H2 formed than the reforming of saturated hydrocarbons and produces mostly CO2.</p>
<p>Base metals such as Ni, Co, NiCu and noble metals such as Pt, Pd and Rh over appropriate supports show potential for ethanol SR, and the main problems to be tackled are byproduct formation and coke deposition.</p>
<p>Side products observed on Ni-based catalysts are mainly CH4 and COx formed by ethanol SR with methane production, ethanol decomposition, methane SR or methanation depending on the reaction temperature.</p>
<p>Reports on intrinsic kinetics of ethanol SR over Ni and Ru catalysts include power-law rate expressions where ethanol consumption rate is first order with respect to ethanol and independent of steam.</p>
<p>PtNi catalysts are efficient for the auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of hydrocarbon feeds and are potential candidates for energy efficient commercial processes.</p>
<p>The present work contains a series of experiments conducted over PtNi/δ-Al2O3 catalysts with different Pt and Ni contents in order to select the most suitable PtNi catalyst on which ethanol SR proceeds well and is coupled with a kinetic study to extract the rate expression for describing ethanol SR kinetics in the simulation of ATR units of fuel processors.</p>

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by requiring less energy per mole of hydrogen (H2) formed compared to traditional methods. This efficiency makes it a promising technique for hydrogen production, particularly from renewable resources like ethanol. Its key advantages include:

1. **Lower Energy Consumption**: Reforming oxygenates like ethanol uses less energy per mole of H2 produced compared to reforming saturated hydrocarbons.
   
2. **Environmental Impact**: Produces primarily CO2, which is a known greenhouse gas but can be managed more easily than other byproducts like COx, CH4, and others generated during the reforming of other hydrocarbons.
   
3. **Product Yield**: The process allows for the efficient conversion of oxygenates into hydrogen, enhancing the yield of hydrogen compared to traditional reforming methods.
   
4. **Practical Implementation**: The use of specific catalysts, such as PtNi/δ-Al2O3, enables the effective and selective reforming of oxygenates at higher temperatures with reduced byproducts and improved hydrogen yield. This makes it a viable option for industrial hydrogen production, particularly in the context of renewable energy sources and fuel cells.
   
5. **Energy Efficiency**: PtNi catalysts are particularly efficient for auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of hydrocarbon feeds, which eliminates the need for external heat sources, enhancing the overall energy efficiency of the process.
   
6. **Kinetic Understanding**: Through kinetic studies, researchers can better understand and optimize the reaction rates and mechanisms involved in the reforming process, leading to more efficient and selective hydrogen production.
   
7. **Integration with Fuel Cells**: Hydrogen produced through selective oxygenate reforming is a suitable fuel for PEM fuel cells, reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fossil fuel usage.
