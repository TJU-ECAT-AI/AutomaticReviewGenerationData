<p>Results from reaction kinetics measurements show that PtRe/C catalysts are more active for glycerol conversion compared to monometallic Pt/C. Furthermore, these results suggest that the addition of Re to Pt increases the rates of the watergas shift reaction as well as alkane formation reactions.</p>
<p>Microcalorimetric and CO-TPD studies reveal surface modification resulting from addition of Re to Pt. In particular, CO-TPD demonstrates that the desorption energy of CO on PtRe/C decreases relative to the monometallic samples after exposure to a selectively oxidative pretreatment. This selective oxidation of surface Re may occur under reaction conditions, and is potentially responsible for the formation of active surface sites.</p>
<p>X-ray adsorption spectroscopy and TEM studies suggest that PtRe catalysts consist of bimetallic alloy nanoparticles. Exposure to reaction conditions leads to slight sintering and segregation of Re. Importantly, Re appears to help alleviate sintering of Pt. These results suggest that Re participates in glycerol conversion by weakening the binding energy of CO to neighboring Pt sites, increasing the rate of watergas shift, and facilitating hydrogenolysis of CO bonds at elevated pressures; these effects can be explained in terms of active sites consisting of Pt surface atoms adjacent to Re surface atoms that preferentially bond to oxygen species, such as hydroxyl groups.</p>

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing the efficiency of converting biomass into liquid fuels. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to cleaner burning fuels, and potential for integration into existing industrial processes. Compared to traditional methods, this approach offers improved selectivity towards desired products like alkanes and oxygenated hydrocarbons, minimized formation of unwanted byproducts, and reduced energy consumption through optimized reaction conditions.

2. The addition of rhenium (Re) to platinum (Pt) catalysts increases the rates of glycerol conversion and the production of hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), and light alkanes. Re weakens the binding energy of CO to Pt sites, enhances the water-gas shift reaction, and facilitates the hydrogenolysis of CO bonds, especially under high pressures. This leads to a shift in product selectivity towards alkanes and oxygenated hydrocarbons, which are more desirable for transportation applications. The mechanism involves active sites composed of Pt atoms adjacent to Re atoms that preferentially bond to oxygen species, such as hydroxyl groups, contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance.

1. 选择性氧基重整过程通过提高生物质转化为液体燃料的效率，为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。其主要优势包括更高的产品产率、由于燃烧更清洁的燃料而减少的环境影响以及与现有工业流程整合的潜力。与传统方法相比，这种方法提供了对所需产品的改进选择性，如烷烃和氧代烃，最小化了副产品的形成，并通过优化反应条件减少了能量消耗。

2. 钯和铼的添加增加了甘油的转化速率和氢气、一氧化碳和轻质烷烃的生成。铼削弱了钯表面的碳氧化合物的结合能力，增强了水-煤气转换反应，并在高压下促进了二氧化碳的氢解。这导致了向烷烃和氧代烃的选择性转变，这些物质更适合运输应用。机制涉及由钯原子和铼原子组成的活性位点，它们优先与氧基团（如羟基）结合，从而提高了催化性能。
