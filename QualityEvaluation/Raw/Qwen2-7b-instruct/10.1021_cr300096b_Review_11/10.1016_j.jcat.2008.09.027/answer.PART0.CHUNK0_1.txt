[1] "The transportation sector requires fuels that burn cleanly and have high energy densities for efficient storage at ambient conditions."
[2] "Biomass represents an attractive option for liquid fuels to supplement those derived from petroleum [1] , provided that efficient and economical conversion technologies can be developed."
[3] "We have recently reported a low temperature process for the conversion of glycerol to synthesis gas over a carbon-supported PtRe catalyst [2] ,[3] ."
[4] "Furthermore, we demonstrated that this glycerol conversion process can be combined with FischerTropsch synthesis in a single reactor process such that the heat generated by the exothermic FischerTropsch reaction can be supplied to the endothermic glycerol reforming reaction [4] ."
[5] "This combined process allows for the direct production of liquid alkanes suitable for transportation applications from glycerol [4] ."
[6] "Previous reaction kinetics studies showed that the addition of Re to Pt increased the catalytic activity by an order of magnitude compared to monometallic Pt catalysts at conditions leading to high coverages of CO [2] ."
[7] "The results of these studies show that the turnover frequencies for production of H2, CO, CO2, and light alkanes (primarily methane) all increase upon the addition of Re to Pt/C catalysts."
[8] "For glycerol conversion over a PtRe/C catalyst with an atomic Pt:Re ratio of 1:1, increasing pressure or decreasing temperature leads to an increase in the production of alkanes and light oxygenated hydrocarbons (ethanol, methanol, propanediols, and acetone) at the expense of CO and CO2."
[9] "The results of these reaction kinetic studies and characterization studies indicate that the performance of PtRe/C catalysts for glycerol conversion is related to the formation of PtRe nanoparticles, for which Re promotes the overall rate of glycerol reforming by reducing the binding energy of CO to Pt."
[10] "The presence of Re facilitates watergas shift and CO bond cleavage reactions."

1. Sustainable energy and chemical production rely on processes that offer clean burning fuels with high energy density for efficient storage at ambient conditions. Biomass is considered a promising alternative to petroleum-derived fuels, provided that effective and economical conversion technologies are developed. The use of biomass for liquid fuel production has environmental benefits compared to traditional fossil fuels, as it reduces greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on non-renewable resources.

2. Key advantages of the process of selective oxygenate reforming in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation compared to traditional methods include:
    - Increased efficiency and yield of desired products like alkanes and oxygenated hydrocarbons from biomass feedstocks such as glycerol.
    - Potential for lower environmental impact due to reduced emissions from cleaner-burning fuels.
    - Integration with other chemical processes, such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, to maximize energy utilization and product diversity.
    - Direct production of liquid alkanes suitable for transportation, reducing the need for refining and processing steps typically associated with traditional fuel production.

Selective oxygenate reforming offers a pathway to enhance the sustainability of energy and chemical production by optimizing fuel properties, minimizing environmental footprint, and improving operational efficiency.

1. 清洁燃烧、高能量密度的燃料对于在常温下高效存储至关重要，这是可持续能源和化学生产的基础。生物质被认为是一种补充石油衍生燃料的有吸引力的选择，前提是开发出有效的和经济的技术。与传统化石燃料相比，生物质用于液体燃料生产具有环境优势，因为它减少了温室气体排放并降低了对不可再生资源的依赖。

2. 选择性氧化物重整过程相对于传统方法在产品产率、环境影响和实施方面的关键优势包括：
    - 提高从生物基原料（如甘油）中获得所需产品的效率和产量，例如烷烃和含氧烃。
    - 可能降低环境影响，因为燃烧更清洁的燃料可以减少排放。
    - 与其他化学过程（如费希尔-特罗普合成）集成，以最大限度地提高能源利用和产品多样性。
    - 直接生产适用于运输的液态烷烃，减少了传统燃料生产过程中通常需要的精炼和处理步骤的需求。

选择性氧化物重整提供了一条途径，通过优化燃料特性、最小化环境足迹和提高操作效率，来增强能源和化学生产的可持续性。
