[1] "The transportation sector requires fuels that burn cleanly and have high energy densities for efficient storage at ambient conditions."
[2] "However, environmental and political concerns are driving society to develop alternative sources of transportation fuels."
[3] "Biomass represents an attractive option for liquid fuels to supplement those derived from petroleum [1], provided that efficient and economical conversion technologies can be developed."
[4] "Furthermore, we demonstrated that this glycerol conversion process can be combined with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in a single reactor process such that the heat generated by the exothermic Fischer-Tropsch reaction can be supplied to the endothermic glycerol reforming reaction [4]."
[5] "This combined process allows for the direct production of liquid alkanes suitable for transportation applications from glycerol [4]."
[6] "Previous reaction kinetics studies showed that the addition of Re to Pt increased the catalytic activity by an order of magnitude compared to monometallic Pt catalysts at conditions leading to high coverages of CO [2]."
[7] "The results of these studies show that the turnover frequencies for production of H2, CO, CO2, and light alkanes (primarily methane) all increase upon the addition of Re to Pt/C catalysts."
[8] "For glycerol conversion over a PtRe/C catalyst with an atomic Pt:Re ratio of 1:1, increasing pressure or decreasing temperature leads to an increase in the production of alkanes and light oxygenated hydrocarbons (ethanol, methanol, propanediols, and acetone) at the expense of CO and CO2."
[9] "These results suggest that the addition of Re to Pt increases the rates of the watergas shift reaction as well as alkane formation reactions."
[10] "Microcalorimetric and CO-TPD studies reveal surface modification resulting from addition of Re to Pt."
[11] "X-ray adsorption spectroscopy and TEM studies suggest that PtRe catalysts consist of bimetallic alloy nanoparticles."
[12] "Importantly, Re appears to help alleviate sintering of Pt."
[13] "These results suggest that Re participates in glycerol conversion by weakening the binding energy of CO to neighboring Pt sites, increasing the rate of watergas shift, and facilitating hydrogenolysis of CO bonds at elevated pressures."

1. Sustainable energy and chemical production rely on processes that emit fewer pollutants and have high energy efficiency. Glycerol conversion offers a sustainable route to produce liquid fuels, particularly alkanes, which are suitable for transportation. This method is advantageous because it can be integrated with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, utilizing the heat from the synthesis reaction to drive glycerol reforming, thus enhancing efficiency.

2. Key advantages of the glycerol conversion process include:
   - High yield of liquid alkanes for transportation.
   - Reduced environmental impact due to cleaner burning fuels.
   - Economic viability through efficient use of resources and energy recycling.
   - Scalability and adaptability to different conditions and feedstocks.
