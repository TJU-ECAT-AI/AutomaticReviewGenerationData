[1] "We present a study of methanol decomposition over ZrO2-supported bimetallic Pt0.8M0.2 nanocatalysts (3 nm), with M = Au, Pd, Ru, Fe. The oxidation state and the activity of Pt was found to be heavily influenced by the addition of the secondary metal."
[2] "In order to take advantage of Pt-M systems in the design of new catalysts for any of these applications, the structural, chemical, and electronic modifications, brought about by the addition of secondary metals, need to be fully understood."
[3] "We find that the oxidation state as well as the activity of Pt is heavily influenced by the addition of the secondary metal."
[4] "The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by providing a cleaner alternative to traditional methods. Key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact, and improved practical implementation."
