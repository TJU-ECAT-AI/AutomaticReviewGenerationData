[1] "We present a study of methanol decomposition over ZrO2-supported bimetallic Pt0.8M0.2 nanocatalysts (3 nm), with M = Au, Pd, Ru, Fe."
[2] "The oxidation state and the activity of Pt was found to be heavily influenced by the addition of the secondary metal."
[3] "Segregation trends upon annealing in air are discussed."
[4] "Previous studies by our group [49], [50] have shown that the size of Pt nanoparticle catalysts, as well as the particle support, can influence the type (PtO, PtO2) and stability of the metal oxide shell present in real-world catalysts under realistic reaction conditions."
[5] "Under these conditions the observed effects can be directly related to the addition of the secondary metal."
[6] "The presence of oxygen has been shown to heavily influence atomic segregation in nanoparticles (NPs), and the presence of metal M on the NP surface can affect the stability of oxide species on active nanocatalysts [13],[14]."
[7] "In order to take advantage of Pt-M systems in the design of new catalysts for any of these applications, the structural, chemical, and electronic modifications, brought about by the addition of secondary metals [4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10],[11], need to be fully understood."
[8] "However, as stated earlier, these systems hold importance in a broader sense than power generation alone [18],[19],[20],[21],[22],[23],[24],[25],[26],[27],[28],[29],[30],[31],[32] and a large number of works have been dedicated to understanding their synthesis, characterization, and catalytic properties [33],[34],[35],[36],[37],[38],[39],[40],[41],[42],[43],[44]."
[9] "In particular, the surface compositions of such catalysts are influenced by a number of factors."
[10] "In addition, the presence of oxygen has been shown to heavily influence atomic segregation in nanoparticles (NPs), and the presence of metal M on the NP surface can affect the stability of oxide species on active nanocatalysts [13],[14]."
[11] "This segregation effect has been observed, for example, in Pt-Rh catalysts [73]."
[12] "In our system we have evidence [TEM image shown in Fig. 2 (c)] of the formation of a Pt-Au alloy, most likely due to our chemical synthesis method versus deposition of Au on a Pt (1 1 1) single crystal surface by Zhang et al."
[13] "From the Pt-Au spectrum in Fig. 3 , and Table 1 , we see that the addition of Au seems to have had little effect on the oxidation state of Pt in this system as compared to the similarly prepared pure Pt NPs."
[14] "The main XPS peaks of Pd-3d overlap with those of Zr-3p and could not be resolved in the Pt-Pd sample."
[15] "However, upon deconvolution of the monometallic Ru spectrum (bottom) we uncover two states of oxidation, Ru6+ (RuO3) at 283 eV and Ru4+ (RuO2) at 281 eV."
[16] "Analysis of the Pt-Ru sample (top) reveals the disappearance of the RuO2 component (present in the monometallic Ru sample) at 281 eV, and only the RuO3 (283 eV) remains."
[17] "Fig. 6 shows the rate of MeOH conversion (in units of μmol of MeOH/min/g cat) for each bimetallic Pt-M sample in the range of 150220 C."
[18] "Unexpected results were obtained while monitoring the reactivity of Pt-Ru and Pt-Pd samples."
[19] "The other point we would like to make note of concerns the Pt-Pd sample."
[20] "Fig. 7 displays an Arrhenius plot [ln(Reaction Rate) versus 1/T] for the Pt-M samples in the range of 190220 C."
[21] "Fig. 8 correlates these data with the phase content (%) of Pt0 (bottom axis) and PtO (top axis) in each Pt-M sample."
[22] "For the y-axis we have calculated the percent difference of the rate for each sample, with respect to the monometallic Pt, at T = 190, 200, 210, and 220 C, and plotted the average as: For example, the higher the average percent difference, the lower is the rate of MeOH conversion for a particular sample compared to the monometallic Pt."
[23] "In the course of our experiments, only CO2 and CH4 were obtained as byproducts and only in small amounts at high temperatures."
[24] "It is interesting to note that the Pt reference sample produced CO2 at low temperatures (2.5% at 150 C)."
[25] "Bera et al. [88] have also reported Pt/CeO2 active for the low temperature water gas shift reaction, with Pt being found mostly in the 2+ state (PtO)."

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting oxygenates, such as methanol, into valuable chemicals and fuels with minimal waste. Key advantages include increased product yield, reduced environmental impact due to lower energy consumption and fewer emissions, and the ability to utilize renewable feedstocks. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming often requires lower temperatures and pressures, leading to improved energy efficiency and reduced operational costs.

2. The study focuses on the decomposition of methanol over bimetallic Pt-M nanocatalysts. The activity of Pt is heavily influenced by the addition of the secondary metal, and the presence of oxygen significantly affects atomic segregation in the nanoparticles. The synthesis of these catalysts involves the addition of secondary metals to Pt, which alters their activity and selectivity for methanol decomposition. The research aims to understand the effects of these modifications on the catalyst's structure, chemical properties, and electronic modifications, which are crucial for designing new catalysts for various applications.

3. The results suggest that the addition of secondary metals to the Pt catalyst can influence its activity and selectivity for methanol decomposition. For instance, the Pt-Au system shows little effect on the oxidation state of Pt, while the Pt-Pd system enhances the activity. The Pt-Fe system results in a decrease in activity. The Pt-Ru system exhibits unexpected behavior, with a lower activity compared to other systems. The study highlights the importance of considering the affinity of the secondary metal for oxygen in understanding the segregation phenomena in real-world nanocatalysts, which impacts their activity and selectivity.

4. The study demonstrates that the addition of secondary metals to Pt catalysts can alter the catalytic properties for methanol decomposition. Factors such as the size of the Pt nanoparticles, the support material, and the synthesis conditions influence the type and stability of the metal oxide shell. The presence of oxygen during the annealing process affects atomic segregation in the nanoparticles, which can lead to different surface compositions and thus impact the catalytic activity. The study contributes to the understanding of how to optimize catalysts for sustainable energy and chemical production processes.
