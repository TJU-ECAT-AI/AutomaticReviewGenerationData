          The study investigates the methanol decomposition over ZrO2-supported bimetallic Pt-M nanocatalysts with M = Au, Pd, Ru, Fe. The oxidation state and activity of Pt are significantly affected by the addition of the secondary metal. Selective oxygenate reforming offers a sustainable energy and chemical production solution by providing a cleaner alternative compared to traditional methods, with notable benefits such as higher product yields, minimized environmental impact, and enhanced practical implementation.
