Highly stable dealuminated zeolite support for the production of hydrogen by dry reforming of methane Abstract...Indeed, dry reforming of methane can be an important route for increasing the hydrogen production and reducing CO2 and CH4 emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect.

The properties of the prepared catalysts in terms of activity, catalyst stability, and coking resistance are reported and compared to Ni/alumina, Pt/other zeolite, and Pt/active carbon catalysts.

The selective oxygenate reforming process utilizes dry reforming of methane to produce hydrogen, contributing to sustainable energy and chemical production. This method reduces CO2 and CH4 emissions, which mitigate the greenhouse effect. Compared to traditional methods, this process offers higher activity, stability, and coking resistance. Catalysts prepared for this process are evaluated for their performance against those using alumina, other zeolites, and active carbon, highlighting its efficiency and sustainability benefits.
