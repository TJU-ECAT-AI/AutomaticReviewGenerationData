<p>Indeed, dry reforming of methane can be an important route for increasing the hydrogen production and reducing CO2 and CH4 emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of heterogeneous catalysts that work under severe conditions in CO2 reforming of CH4 has been demonstrated.</p>
<p>There are few reports that investigated the effect of these supports on the catalytic performance in the dry reforming of methane.</p>
<p>Most of them focused on the properties of the two zeolites in converting methane, in terms of activity and thermal and mechanical resistance.</p>
<p>There are no clear correlations between acidity and analysis of the influence of the metals present on the supports.</p>
<p>Dealumination by steaming of FAU type Y and BEA zeolites formed mesopores.</p>
<p>This process considerably increased the acidity and also improved the accessibility of the catalysts.</p>
<p>The catalytic performance in the CO2 reforming of methane showed that Ni-containing monometallic samples were inactive in the reaction due to the large amount of filamentous amorphous carbon deposited on these solids.</p>
<p>Activity results on the bimetallic NiPt systems were higher than those of PtY monometallic catalysts, attributable to the favourable adsorption of CO2 on the adjacent Ni site (together with Pt), which reacts with the surface filamentous carbon deposits.</p>
<p>In contrast, low catalytic activity was obtained by using FAU type Y support due to its high acidity, which is conducive to forming difficult to eliminate carbon whiskers.</p>
<p>Pt-containing BEA zeolite carriers have a superior activity and stability in the dry reforming of methane, compared to Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/active carbon and other catalysts studied, due to its high resistance to coking.</p>

The process of selective oxygenate reforming plays a crucial role in sustainable energy and chemical production. It significantly boosts hydrogen production while reducing CO2 and CH4 emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect. Compared to traditional methods, this process offers several key advantages:

1. **Enhanced Product Yield**: The utilization of heterogeneous catalysts in CO2 reforming of methane has proven effective, enabling higher yields of hydrogen.

2. **Reduced Environmental Impact**: By converting methane and CO2 into hydrogen, a cleaner fuel, the process significantly reduces emissions of greenhouse gases, contributing positively to environmental sustainability.

3. **Improved Practical Implementation**: The use of dealuminated zeolite supports with moderate acidity, such as BEA carriers, enhances the dispersion of metals like platinum, improving catalyst stability and resistance to coking. This leads to better performance and more efficient reactions compared to traditional supports like alumina or active carbon.

4. **Optimized Reaction Conditions**: The process allows for the optimization of reaction conditions, leading to higher efficiency and selectivity in producing hydrogen, which is crucial for sustainable chemical production processes.

5. **Resistance to Carbon Formation**: Pt-containing BEA zeolite carriers show superior stability and resistance to coking, which is a common issue in traditional catalysts. This ensures consistent performance and minimizes operational challenges.

Overall, selective oxygenate reforming not only enhances the sustainability of energy and chemical production but also improves economic viability by increasing product yields and reducing environmental impacts.

Answer: Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting CO2 and methane into useful and non-polluting compounds. Its key advantages over traditional methods include:

1. **Enhanced Product Yield**: The reforming process generates a suitable H2/CO ratio, nearly 1:1, ideal for the synthesis of liquid hydrocarbons, offering a higher yield of desired products compared to conventional steam reforming or partial oxidation of methane.

2. **Better Chemical Energy Transmission**: The endothermic nature of the process allows for efficient use in chemical energy transmission, optimizing the production of synthesis gas, particularly when combined with an oxidizing agent like CO2 or O2/H2O.

3. **Independent Source for Hydrogen Production**: The process can serve as an independent source for hydrogen production, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels, and decreasing CO2 emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect.

4. **Improved Environmental Impact**: By utilizing CO2 as a feedstock, selective oxygenate reforming helps mitigate the environmental impact of CO2 emissions, promoting a cleaner and more sustainable energy cycle.

5. **High Stability and Selectivity**: The use of dealuminated zeolite supports, such as BEA zeolite, ensures high stability and selectivity during prolonged operation, reducing the risk of carbon deposition and enhancing the longevity of the catalysts.

6. **Efficient Catalyst Utilization**: Zeolite supports provide a stable system with high metal dispersion, reducing the potential for support-metal interaction and improving the overall efficiency of the catalysts, thus minimizing waste and enhancing resource utilization.

In summary, selective oxygenate reforming offers a more sustainable, environmentally friendly, and efficient pathway for energy and chemical production compared to traditional methods, thanks to its optimized product yield, reduced environmental impact, and improved practical implementation.
