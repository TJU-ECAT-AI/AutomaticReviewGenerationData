[1] "In recent years, economical and sustainable industrial processes that can efficiently convert CO2 to a useful and non-polluting compound have become important."
[2] "Specifically, the CO2 reforming of methane (reaction 
(I)
) is an attractive way to utilize CO2, since it offers the following advantages over steam reforming (reaction 
(II)
) and the partial oxidation of methane (reaction 
(III)
): (i) it forms a suitable H2/CO ratio, i.e., nearly 1:1, for use in the synthesis of liquid hydrocarbons; (ii) it is better used in chemical energy transmission, and (iii) it can be used as an independent source for the production of synthesis gas, with the condition that some amount of an oxidizing agent, e.g., CO2 or O2/H2O, is added [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5]."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by converting CO2 into a useful and non-polluting compound. Its key advantages include forming a suitable H2/CO ratio for synthesizing liquid hydrocarbons, being efficient in chemical energy transmission, and serving as an independent source for producing synthesis gas, requiring the addition of an oxidizing agent like CO2 or O2/H2O.
