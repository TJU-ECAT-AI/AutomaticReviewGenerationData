<p>Indeed, dry reforming of methane can be an important route for increasing the hydrogen production and reducing CO2 and CH4 emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of heterogeneous catalysts that work under severe conditions in CO2 reforming of CH4 has been demonstrated.</p>
<p>There are few reports that investigated the effect of these supports on the catalytic performance in the dry reforming of methane.</p>
<p>Most of them focused on the properties of the two zeolites in converting methane, in terms of activity and thermal and mechanical resistance.</p>
<p>There are no clear correlations between acidity and analysis of the influence of the metals present on the supports.</p>
<p>Dealumination by steaming of FAU type Y and BEA zeolites formed mesopores.</p>
<p>This process considerably increased the acidity and also improved the accessibility of the catalysts.</p>
<p>The catalytic performance in the CO2 reforming of methane showed that Ni-containing monometallic samples were inactive in the reaction due to the large amount of filamentous amorphous carbon deposited on these solids.</p>
<p>Activity results on the bimetallic NiPt systems were higher than those of PtY monometallic catalysts, attributable to the favourable adsorption of CO2 on the adjacent Ni site (together with Pt), which reacts with the surface filamentous carbon deposits.</p>
<p>In contrast, low catalytic activity was obtained by using FAU type Y support due to its high acidity, which is conducive to forming difficult to eliminate carbon whiskers.</p>
<p>Pt-containing BEA zeolite carriers have a superior activity and stability in the dry reforming of methane, compared to Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/active carbon and other catalysts studied, due to its high resistance to coking.</p>

The process of selective oxygenate reforming plays a crucial role in sustainable energy and chemical production. It significantly boosts hydrogen production while reducing CO2 and CH4 emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect. Compared to traditional methods, this process offers several key advantages:

1. **Enhanced Product Yield**: The utilization of heterogeneous catalysts in CO2 reforming of methane has proven effective, enabling higher yields of hydrogen.

2. **Reduced Environmental Impact**: By converting methane and CO2 into hydrogen, a cleaner fuel, the process significantly reduces emissions of greenhouse gases, contributing positively to environmental sustainability.

3. **Improved Practical Implementation**: The use of dealuminated zeolite supports with moderate acidity, such as BEA carriers, enhances the dispersion of metals like platinum, improving catalyst stability and resistance to coking. This leads to better performance and more efficient reactions compared to traditional supports like alumina or active carbon.

4. **Optimized Reaction Conditions**: The process allows for the optimization of reaction conditions, leading to higher efficiency and selectivity in producing hydrogen, which is crucial for sustainable chemical production processes.

5. **Resistance to Carbon Formation**: Pt-containing BEA zeolite carriers show superior stability and resistance to coking, which is a common issue in traditional catalysts. This ensures consistent performance and minimizes operational challenges.

Overall, selective oxygenate reforming not only enhances the sustainability of energy and chemical production but also improves economic viability by increasing product yields and reducing environmental impacts.

选择性氧化物重整过程在可持续能源和化学生产中起着关键作用。它显著增加了氢气的生产，同时减少了导致温室效应的二氧化碳和甲烷排放。与传统方法相比，该过程具有几个关键优势：

1. **提高产品产率**：在甲烷和二氧化碳重整过程中使用异质催化剂已经证明是有效的，可以实现更高的氢气产量。

2. **减少环境影响**：通过将甲烷和二氧化碳转化为清洁燃料氢气，该过程大大减少了温室气体的排放，对环境保护做出了积极贡献。

3. **改进实施方式**：使用带适度酸性的去铝硅酸盐载体（如BEA载体）可以增强铂等金属的分散性，提高催化剂的稳定性和抗结焦能力。这导致性能更好、反应更有效，与传统的氧化铝或活性碳载体相比。

4. **优化反应条件**：该过程允许优化反应条件，提高了生产氢气的效率和选择性，对于可持续化学生产过程至关重要。

5. **抵抗碳形成**：含铂的BEA载体显示了出色的稳定性和抗结焦能力，这是传统催化剂中常见的问题。这确保了性能的一致性，并最小化了运营挑战。

总的来说，选择性氧化物重整不仅提高了能源和化学生产的可持续性，还通过增加产品产率和减少环境影响来提高了经济可行性。
