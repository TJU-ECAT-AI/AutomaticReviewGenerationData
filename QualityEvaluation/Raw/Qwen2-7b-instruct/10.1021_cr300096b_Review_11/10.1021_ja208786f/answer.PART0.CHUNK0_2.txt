Answer: The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting biomass derivatives into valuable products. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to minimized waste and emissions, and enhanced practical implementation through optimized reaction conditions on surfaces like monolayer Ni. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming typically offers improved selectivity, allowing for the targeted production of specific compounds, which can lead to more efficient use of resources and potentially lower costs.
