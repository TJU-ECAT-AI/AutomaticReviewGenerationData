<p>Although natural gas, gasoline and methanol are usually mentioned as the likely sources for hydrogen production, their use does not reduce reliance on fossil fuels or emission of pollutants. Ethanol has recently received attention as a hydrogen source due to its crucial advantage of being producible from renewable sources such as biomass, plants or waste materials of agricultural and forestry industries.</p>
<p>Hydrogen production from bio-ethanol offers a nearly closed carbon loop since the carbon dioxide produced is consumed for biomass growth.</p>
<p>The most likely side reactions over Ni-based catalysts are ethanol SR with methane production, ethanol decomposition and methane SR.</p>
<p>A parametric study was conducted to reveal the effects of water-to-ethanol ratio and temperature on ethanol conversion and hydrogen formation, and a kinetic study was carried out in order to propose a power-function rate expression for ethanol conversion by steam reforming over PtNi/δ-Al2O3.</p>
<p>About 773 K is selected as the optimum reaction temperature, since high H2 production rates are accompanied by low CO and CH4 production rates, thus yielding favorable H2/CO and H2/CH4 production ratios at this temperature.</p>
<p>An empirical power function rate equation is proposed on the basis of intrinsic rates evaluated at 673 K over PtNi/δ-Al2O3. Reaction orders are calculated as 1.25 (0.05) and 0.215 (0.015) with respect to ethanol and steam, respectively.</p>

The process of selective oxygenate reforming, particularly focusing on ethanol steam reforming, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by leveraging renewable resources. Its key advantages include:

1. **Renewable Resource Utilization**: Ethanol, derived from biomass, plants, or waste materials from agricultural and forestry industries, serves as a sustainable hydrogen source. This reduces reliance on fossil fuels and minimizes pollution emissions.

2. **Closed Carbon Loop**: In the hydrogen production process, the carbon dioxide generated during the reforming is utilized for biomass growth, creating a nearly closed carbon cycle.

3. **Efficient Conversion**: The study demonstrates that the bimetallic PtNi/δ-Al2O3 catalyst is effective in ethanol steam reforming, showing resistance to coke deposition even at low steam-to-carbon ratios. Higher water-to-ethanol ratios enhance both ethanol conversion and hydrogen formation, indicating efficient use of reactants.

4. **Optimized Conditions**: The optimal reaction temperature of 773 K ensures high hydrogen production rates alongside low levels of CO and CH4, providing favorable production ratios and minimizing unwanted byproducts.

5. **Kinetic Insights**: The proposed power-function rate expression elucidates the reaction dynamics, revealing that the rate of ethanol steam reforming is directly proportional to the partial pressure of ethanol and mildly inhibited by steam partial pressure. This understanding aids in optimizing process conditions for enhanced efficiency.

6. **Apparent Activation Energy**: The calculated apparent activation energy of 39.3 (2.1) kJ mol−1 supports the reaction controlling conditions under which the experiments were conducted, indicating the practicality of the process.

In summary, selective oxygenate reforming, particularly ethanol steam reforming, offers a sustainable and efficient pathway for hydrogen production, benefiting from renewable resources, closed carbon cycles, optimized reaction conditions, and kinetic insights that facilitate practical implementation.
