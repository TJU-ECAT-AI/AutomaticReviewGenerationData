Ethanol steam reforming for hydrogen production over bimetallic PtNi/Al2O3 is a process that aims to efficiently convert ethanol into hydrogen, a cleaner energy source. The process benefits from several advantages compared to traditional methods. Firstly, ethanol can be produced from renewable sources such as biomass, plants, or waste materials from agricultural and forestry industries, creating a nearly closed carbon loop since the carbon dioxide produced is consumed for biomass growth. This makes the process environmentally friendly, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and emission of pollutants.

In terms of product yield, the bimetallic catalyst is resistant to coke deposition even at a steam-to-carbon ratio as low as 1.5, allowing for efficient conversion of ethanol to hydrogen. Higher water-to-ethanol ratios have a positive effect on both ethanol conversion and hydrogen formation, enhancing the yield. Moreover, the optimal reaction temperature of approximately 773 K ensures high hydrogen production rates while keeping the levels of byproducts such as carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4) low, thus yielding favorable H2/CO and H2/CH4 production ratios. This balance minimizes the production of unwanted byproducts that could be detrimental in downstream processes, particularly in fuel cells where CO can act as a poison for electrodes.

From a practical standpoint, the process utilizes an empirical power-function rate expression, which provides insights into the reaction orders and apparent activation energy. The reaction order of 1.25 for ethanol and 0.215 for steam suggests that the rate of ethanol steam reforming is directly proportional to the partial pressure of ethanol and is mildly inhibited by steam partial pressure. The apparent activation energy of 39.3 kJ mol−1 between 673 and 723 K indicates that the process operates under reaction-controlling conditions, ensuring that kinetic experiments are conducted effectively. This understanding contributes to the optimization of reaction conditions, leading to efficient and cost-effective hydrogen production.

In summary, ethanol steam reforming over bimetallic PtNi/Al2O3 offers several advantages, including environmental sustainability, enhanced product yield, controlled byproduct formation, and effective kinetic understanding, making it a promising alternative for hydrogen production and clean energy generation.

醇蒸汽重整用于氢生产的双金属PtNi/Al2O3过程旨在高效地将醇转化为氢，一种更清洁的能源。与传统方法相比，该过程具有几大优势。首先，醇可以从生物质、植物或农业和林业行业的废弃物等可再生资源中生产出来，形成一个近乎闭合的碳循环，因为产生的二氧化碳被用于生物体生长，这使得过程对化石燃料的依赖性降低，减少了污染物的排放。

在产率方面，双金属催化剂即使在蒸汽与碳比低至1.5的情况下也能抵抗焦炭沉积，从而实现高效的醇到氢的转化。更高的水与醇比有助于提高醇的转化率和氢的生成，增强产率。此外，大约773K的最优反应温度确保了高氢气产生速率的同时，使CO和CH4等副产品的水平保持较低，从而获得有利的H2/CO和H2/CH4产率比。这种平衡最大限度地减少了可能对后续过程有害的副产品产量，特别是在燃料电池中，CO可能会成为电极的毒物。

从实际应用的角度来看，利用幂函数动力学表达式，可以深入了解反应的顺序和显热能。醇的反应顺序为1.25，蒸汽为0.215，表明醇蒸汽重整的速率直接与醇的分压成正比，而蒸汽分压对其影响较小。在673至723K之间的39.3 kJ mol−1的显热能表明，过程在反应控制条件下进行，确保了动力学实验的有效性。这种理解有助于优化反应条件，实现高效且成本效益高的氢气生产。

总之，醇蒸汽重整在PtNi/Al2O3上具有几个优势，包括环境可持续性、提高产率、控制副产物形成和有效动力学理解，使其成为氢生产和清洁能源发电的有前景的替代方案。
