<p>Even though natural gas, gasoline and methanol are usually mentioned as the likely sources for hydrogen production, their use does not reduce reliance on fossil fuels or emission of pollutants. Ethanol has recently received attention as a hydrogen source due to its crucial advantage of being producible from renewable sources such as biomass, plants or waste materials of agricultural and forestry industries.</p>
<p>Hydrogen production from bio-ethanol offers a nearly closed carbon loop since the carbon dioxide produced is consumed for biomass growth.</p>
<p>Even though the overall steam reforming reaction looks straightforward, the reaction scheme is complicated by the presence of other reactions occurring in the system, depending mostly on reaction temperature and catalyst composition and resulting in exit streams containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ethylene, acetaldehyde etc.</p>
<p>The most likely side reactions over Ni-based catalysts are ethanol SR with methane production, ethanol decomposition and methane SR:</p>
<p>Comas et al. [7] studied ethanol SR over Ni/Al2O3 at 573773 K to propose a reaction scheme.</p>
<p>Fatsikostas and Verykios [8] investigated the effect of using different supports for Ni catalysts and reported that carbon deposition is significantly reduced by impregnating γ-Al2O3 with La2O3.</p>
<p>Sun et al. [9] suggested that ethanol steam reforming on Ni catalysts is first-order with respect to ethanol and computed apparent activation energies between 1.87 and 16.88 kJ mol1 depending on the type of catalyst support.</p>
<p>Akande et al. [10] studied crude ethanol SR over Ni/Al2O3 and suggested a reaction order of 0.43 with respect to ethanol and activation energy of 4.41 kJ mol1.</p>
<p>Intrinsic kinetics of ethanol SR studied over Ru/Al2O3 using excess water, on the other hand, showed that ethanol conversion was directly proportional to ethanol partial pressure and independent of steam partial pressure with apparent activation energy of 96 kJ/mol.</p>
<p>The fuel processor/fuel cell system proposed by Avci et al. [13] for hydrogen production from different hydrocarbons was modified to investigate ethanol conversion to hydrogen by a series of thermodynamic analyses and computer simulations [14].</p>
<p>The present work focuses on ethanol SR over bimetallic PtNi/δ-Al2O3, which is a successful IPOX catalyst that has potential for fuel processor applications associated with PEM fuel cells.</p>
<p>A parametric study was conducted to reveal the effects of water-to-ethanol ratio and temperature on ethanol conversion and hydrogen formation, and a kinetic study was carried out in order to propose a power-function rate expression for ethanol conversion by steam reforming over PtNi/δ-Al2O3.</p>

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production through the utilization of renewable resources like biomass, plants, or waste materials for producing hydrogen. This method reduces reliance on fossil fuels and minimizes the emission of pollutants. Ethanol, in particular, offers a nearly closed carbon loop because the carbon dioxide produced during the process is utilized for biomass growth, enhancing sustainability. This process is advantageous compared to traditional methods due to its environmental benefits, efficient product yield, and practical implementation.

Advantages of selective oxygenate reforming over traditional methods include:

1. **Environmental Impact**: By utilizing renewable resources, it significantly reduces the dependency on non-renewable fossil fuels, thereby lowering greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating environmental pollution.

2. **Product Yield**: The reforming process is designed to maximize the yield of desired products such as hydrogen, making it a cost-effective and efficient method for energy production.

3. **Practical Implementation**: Ethanol and other oxygenates can be easily sourced and transported, simplifying logistics and reducing costs associated with the procurement and handling of raw materials.

The kinetic studies conducted on ethanol steam reforming over bimetallic PtNi/δ-Al2O3 confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of this approach in producing hydrogen sustainably. The power-function rate expression derived from intrinsic rates provides insights into the reaction dynamics, aiding in the optimization of the reforming process and enhancing its practical application in fuel cells and fuel processors.
