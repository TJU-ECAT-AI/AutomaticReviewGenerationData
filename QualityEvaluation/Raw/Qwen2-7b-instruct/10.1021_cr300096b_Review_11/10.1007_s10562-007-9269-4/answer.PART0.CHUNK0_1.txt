[1] "One of the novel alternatives for clean energy generation is fuel cell technology. Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) powered by hydrogen are well-suited for both vehicular and decentralized stationary facilities such as combined heat and power generation for houses and small-scale commercial applications [1, 2]."
[2] "Ethanol has recently received attention as a hydrogen source due to its crucial advantage of being producible from renewable sources such as biomass, plants or waste materials of agricultural and forestry industries."
[3] "Ethanol is widely available, easily transportable, safe to handle and less toxic compared to methanol."
[4] "Ethanol steam reforming is a highly endothermic reaction:$$ {\text{C}}_2 {\text{H}}_5 {\text{OH}} + 3\,{\text{H}}_2 {\text{O}} \Rightarrow 2\,{\text{CO}}_2 + 6\,{\text{H}}_2 \,\,\,\,\,\Updelta {\text{H}}\circ _{{\text{298}}} = 173\,{\text{kJ}}\,{\text{mol}}{ - 1} $$ (1)"
[5] "Even though the overall steam reforming reaction looks straightforward, the reaction scheme is complicated by the presence of other reactions occurring in the system, depending mostly on reaction temperature and catalyst composition and resulting in exit streams containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ethylene, acetaldehyde etc [6, 7]."
[6] "About 773 K is the optimum since high H2 production rates are accompanied by low CO and CH4 production rates, thus yielding favorable H2/CO and H2/CH4 production ratios at this temperature."
[7] "An empirical power function rate equation is proposed on the basis of intrinsic rates evaluated at 673 K over PtNi/δ-Al2O3. Reaction orders are calculated as 1.25 (0.05) and 0.215 (0.015) with respect to ethanol and steam, respectively."

Selective oxygenate reforming, particularly ethanol steam reforming, contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by leveraging renewable resources like biomass. This method offers several key advantages:

1. **Environmental Impact**: Ethanol is produced from renewable sources, leading to a nearly closed carbon loop where the carbon dioxide produced is consumed for biomass growth. This reduces reliance on fossil fuels and minimizes emissions.

2. **Product Yield**: Ethanol steam reforming can produce hydrogen efficiently, with high yields at temperatures around 773 K. This ensures that the process is optimized for maximum hydrogen output while minimizing the formation of byproducts like carbon monoxide and methane.

3. **Practical Implementation**: The bimetallic catalyst, specifically PtNi/δ-Al2O3, demonstrates resistance to coke deposition even at low steam-to-carbon ratios, making it suitable for fuel processor applications associated with PEM fuel cells. This catalyst's ability to operate effectively under various conditions enhances the practicality of the reforming process.

4. **Efficiency and Selectivity**: The power function rate equation derived from intrinsic rates at 673 K reveals that ethanol conversion is directly proportional to ethanol partial pressure and slightly inhibited by steam partial pressure. This indicates a highly efficient and selective process for steam reforming, with calculated reaction orders that suggest a reaction occurring on a mostly water-covered surface, supporting the production of hydrogen with minimized formation of unwanted byproducts.

Answer: Selective oxygenate reforming, especially ethanol steam reforming, promotes sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing renewable resources, ensuring high hydrogen yields, offering practical and efficient processes through optimized catalysts, and maintaining high selectivity in the production of desired products while minimizing environmental impact.
