<p>Even though natural gas, gasoline and methanol are usually mentioned as the likely sources for hydrogen production, their use does not reduce reliance on fossil fuels or emission of pollutants. Ethanol has recently received attention as a hydrogen source due to its crucial advantage of being producible from renewable sources such as biomass, plants or waste materials of agricultural and forestry industries. Hydrogen production from bio-ethanol offers a nearly closed carbon loop since the carbon dioxide produced is consumed for biomass growth.</p>
<p>The criteria for the selection of the optimal hydrocarbon source for small-scale energy production include either a well-established distribution network, as in the case of natural gas, and/or a liquid fuel for easy storage and transportation, as in the case of gasoline. Although natural gas, gasoline and methanol are usually mentioned as the likely sources for hydrogen production, their use does not reduce reliance on fossil fuels or emission of pollutants.

<p>Even though the overall steam reforming reaction looks straightforward, the reaction scheme is complicated by the presence of other reactions occurring in the system, depending mostly on reaction temperature and catalyst composition and resulting in exit streams containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ethylene, acetaldehyde etc.</p>
<p>The most likely side reactions over Ni-based catalysts are ethanol SR with methane production, ethanol decomposition and methane SR.</p>
<p>The present work focuses on ethanol SR over bimetallic PtNi/δ-Al2O3, which is a successful IPOX catalyst that has potential for fuel processor applications associated with PEM fuel cells.</p>
<p>Intrinsic kinetics of ethanol SR studied over Ru/Al2O3 using excess water, on the other hand, showed that ethanol conversion was directly proportional to ethanol partial pressure and independent of steam partial pressure with apparent activation energy of 96 kJ/mol.</p>
<p>The results indicated that H2 yields up to 65% of the theoretical (1 mol ethanol can yield up to 6 mol H2) can be obtained with an ethanol total oxidation conversion of about 13% at a steam-to-carbon ratio of 3.3 and an IPOX reactor exit temperature of 873 K.</p>
<p>Considering the stoichiometry of Reaction 1, and in order to eliminate coke deposition on the PtNi catalyst, the water/ethanol molar ratio was fixed at 5.0 for investigating the effect of temperature on ethanol conversion and product distribution.</p>
<p>No coke formation was observed at either temperature and even at the lowest water/ethanol ratio of 3.0 corresponding to a steam/carbon ratio of 1.5, which is well below the limit claimed to eliminate coke deposition over monometallic Ni catalysts.</p>
<p>The variation in total ethanol conversion with the water/ethanol ratio at 773 K is presented in Fig. 5, while the corresponding hydrogen and methane production trends are shown in Fig. 6.</p>
<p>The general form of the empirical power-function rate expression for ethanol conversion by steam reforming is postulated as follows:</p>
<p>Evaluation of the rate parameters, i.e. α, β, k0 and EA, involves the calculation of reaction rates from ethanol conversion versus residence time data.</p>

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing renewable resources like biomass, plants, or waste materials from agricultural and forestry industries to produce hydrogen. This method offers several key advantages:

1. **Environmental Impact**: Ethanol reforming reduces reliance on fossil fuels and minimizes pollutant emissions, making it a cleaner alternative for hydrogen production.
2. **Product Yield**: Ethanol reforming can achieve high hydrogen yields, especially when optimized, which is crucial for efficient energy conversion processes.
3. **Practical Implementation**: The ability to use a variety of feedstocks, including biomass, makes ethanol reforming versatile and adaptable for various industrial settings, enhancing its practicality and scalability.

In comparison to traditional methods, such as using natural gas, gasoline, or methanol as sources for hydrogen production, ethanol reforming demonstrates a more sustainable approach. Traditional methods often rely heavily on non-renewable resources and contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, ethanol reforming, especially when derived from renewable sources, provides a nearly closed carbon loop, meaning the carbon dioxide generated during the process is utilized in biomass growth, reducing overall environmental impact.

Moreover, the kinetic studies conducted on ethanol reforming over bimetallic catalysts like PtNi/δ-Al2O3, as well as the power-function rate expressions derived from these studies, highlight the potential for optimizing the process to achieve desired product yields with minimal side reactions. The use of such catalysts and the optimization of reaction conditions, like temperature and water-to-ethanol ratio, can further enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the reforming process.

In summary, selective oxygenate reforming, particularly when ethanol is the feedstock, offers a promising avenue for sustainable hydrogen production that minimizes environmental impact, maximizes product yield, and is adaptable to various feedstocks and industrial scales.
