[1] "Researchers are currently developing ways to utilize renewable resources as feedstocks for energy generation and chemical production, with the aim of reducing CO2 emissions as well as the dependency on fossil fuels."
[2] "Among these efforts, hydrogen production has been attracting considerable attention. For example, hydrogen can be used as an environmentally friendly fuel and as a feedstock for ammonia-based fertilizers or other chemicals."
[3] "Additionally, many catalytic bio-fuels production processes, including several developed by our group, require a feed stream of renewable hydrogen."
[4] "This flexibility allows the implementation of renewable feeds in applications that require relatively pure H2 as well as applications requiring various grades of synthesis gas (H2:CO = 2), such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and methanol synthesis."
[5] "The conditions necessary for the integration of glycerol reforming with water-gas shift place special requirements on the downstream water-gas shift catalyst."
[6] "The WGS catalyst must be stable and active at intermediate temperatures, at which Cu-based WGS catalysts tend to sinter and Fe-based high-temperature WGS catalysts display low activity."
[7] "Numerous investigators have observed that oxide-supported noble metal catalysts may offer significant advantages to Cu-based catalysts, including operation at higher temperatures (faster kinetics), facile activation and regeneration, stability in oxidizing conditions, and greater resistance to sintering."
[8] "Lastly we demonstrate that concentrated glycerol solutions (30-80 wt.%) can be processed at low temperatures (e.g., at 573 K) in a two bed-single reactor system (PtRe/C and Pt/CeZrOx) to obtain 100% conversion of the carbon in glycerol to gas phase products, with a hydrogen yield equal to 80%."
