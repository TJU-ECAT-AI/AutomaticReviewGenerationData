<p>Among these efforts, hydrogen production has been attracting considerable attention. For example, hydrogen can be used as an environmentally friendly fuel and as a feedstock for ammonia-based fertilizers or other chemicals. Hydrogen is also gaining widespread applications with the advent of fuel cell technologies [1] . Additionally, many catalytic bio-fuels production processes, including several developed by our group, require a feed stream of renewable hydrogen [2] ,[3] ,[4] .</p>
<p>In this work, we report a two-stage, single reactor process for the production of hydrogen from glycerol. Glycerol is currently produced as a by-product of the trans-esterification of fats and oils in biodiesel production [5] . Glycerol can also be produced by the fermentation of sugars [6] or catalytic hydrogenolysis of sugars and sugar-alcohols [7] .</p>
<p>To integrate the glycerol gasification and water-gas shift processes in a single reactor system, the gasification process must operate at conditions that are thermodynamically favorable for WGS (e.g., lowest temperature possible).</p>
<p>Our approach to hydrogen production outlined in this paper places emphasis on the flexibility of combining glycerol reforming with downstream WGS in one reactor system to furnish CO:H2 mixtures with variable compositions. This flexibility allows the implementation of renewable feeds in applications that require relatively pure H2 as well as applications requiring various grades of synthesis gas (H2:CO = 2), such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and methanol synthesis [14] ,[15] .</p>
<p>To examine the viability of the dual-bed system we must consider the loss in energy efficiency associated with the processing of dilute feedstocks, resulting from water vaporization and the reduction in the H2 content of the effluent while processing more concentrated feedstocks.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the value of the glycerol concentration leading to zero input of energy does not change significantly when the reaction temperature changed by 50 K, since the energy required to heat the feed to the reaction temperature is small compared to the heat of vaporization. Nonetheless, the ability of performing the reaction at lower temperature brings the benefit of utilizing lower grade heat sources, and implementing heat recycling from other processes.</p>

Furthermore, the process is designed to handle concentrated and dilute feedstocks effectively, ensuring consistent performance across a range of glycerol concentrations.

3. The integrated catalytic system proposed in the document combines glycerol reforming with water-gas shift, offering a viable solution for hydrogen production from biomass-derived feedstocks. This system is advantageous because it allows for the control of hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratios, making it suitable for applications requiring pure hydrogen or synthesis gas. By integrating these processes within a single reactor, the system enhances energy efficiency and reduces the need for separate reactors, thus simplifying the production process. Additionally, the system's ability to handle a wide range of glycerol concentrations ensures its applicability across various industrial scales and feedstock qualities.

The viability of the dual-bed system, which includes a glycerol reforming catalyst followed by a water-gas shift catalyst, is examined in the document by considering the energy efficiency losses associated with processing dilute feedstocks. The system is optimized to ensure near-complete conversion of glycerol into synthesis gas and to maintain near-equilibrium conversion of carbon monoxide through water-gas shift. The energy balance calculations indicate that the system can achieve a positive net energy output for glycerol concentrations higher than 17 wt.%, with the maximum efficiency occurring at around 60 wt.%. This highlights the system's potential for energy recovery and efficient hydrogen production from biomass-derived feedstocks.

5. The ability to perform the reaction at lower temperatures brings benefits such as the utilization of lower-grade heat sources and the possibility of implementing heat recycling from other processes. These factors contribute to the overall energy efficiency of the system and make it more adaptable to various industrial settings.
