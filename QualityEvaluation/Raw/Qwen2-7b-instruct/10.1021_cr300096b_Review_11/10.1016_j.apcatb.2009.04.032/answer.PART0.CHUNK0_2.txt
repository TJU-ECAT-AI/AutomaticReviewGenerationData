<p>Among these efforts, hydrogen production has been attracting considerable attention. For example, hydrogen can be used as an environmentally friendly fuel and as a feedstock for ammonia-based fertilizers or other chemicals. Hydrogen is also gaining widespread applications with the advent of fuel cell technologies [1] .</p>
<p>In this work, we report a two-stage, single reactor process for the production of hydrogen from glycerol.</p>
<p>To integrate the glycerol gasification and water-gas shift processes in a single reactor system, the gasification process must operate at conditions that are thermodynamically favorable for WGS (e.g., lowest temperature possible).</p>
<p>Our approach to hydrogen production outlined in this paper places emphasis on the flexibility of combining glycerol reforming with downstream WGS in one reactor system to furnish CO:H2 mixtures with variable compositions.</p>
<p>This integrated catalytic system displayed 100% carbon conversion of concentrated glycerol solutions (3080 wt.%) into CO2 and CO, with a hydrogen yield equal to 80% of the amount that would ideally be obtained from the stoichiometric conversion of glycerol to H2 and CO followed by equilibrated water-gas shift with the water present in the feed.</p>
<p>The system exhibited excellent stability during the 48 h time-on-stream and the H2/CO ratio obtained varied significantly with the glycerol content.</p>
<p>For all glycerol concentrations, the hydrogen yield approached 80% of this calculated maximum.</p>
<p>Assuming the WGS reaction is equilibrated, the maximum efficiency for direct hydrogen production occurs at concentration around 60 wt.%, reaching a net gain of 1100 kJ mol1 of glycerol processed.</p>

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing renewable resources as feedstocks for hydrogen generation and chemical production. Its key advantages include producing environmentally friendly fuel, serving as a feedstock for ammonia-based fertilizers and other chemicals, and facilitating the development of fuel cell technologies. Compared to traditional methods, this process offers a more efficient way to produce hydrogen, reduces carbon emissions, and enables the use of lower-grade heat sources through the implementation of heat recycling.

2. The integrated catalytic system for hydrogen production from glycerol involves a two-stage process: glycerol reforming and water-gas shift. The glycerol reforming step converts glycerol into a hydrogen and carbon dioxide mixture, while the water-gas shift step further refines the mixture to control the H2:CO ratio. This system provides flexibility in tailoring the hydrogen yield to meet various application needs.

3. The gasification process in the integrated system operates at conditions that favor the water-gas shift reaction, allowing for the production of CO:H2 mixtures with controllable compositions. This enables the implementation of renewable feeds in applications requiring different grades of synthesis gas or pure hydrogen.

4. The integrated catalytic system achieves high carbon conversion rates from glycerol solutions, even at low temperatures, and maintains a high hydrogen yield that closely matches the ideal stoichiometric conversion. The system demonstrates excellent stability and adaptability to varying glycerol concentrations, providing a robust platform for hydrogen production from glycerol.

5. The integrated system offers a high efficiency for hydrogen production, especially when glycerol is processed at a concentration of around 60 wt.%. This efficiency results in a net energy gain of approximately 1100 kJ per mole of glycerol processed, highlighting the potential for energy savings and sustainability in the production process.
