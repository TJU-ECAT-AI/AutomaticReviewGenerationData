<p>Researchers are currently developing ways to utilize renewable resources as feedstocks for energy generation and chemical production, with the aim of reducing CO2 emissions as well as the dependency on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Our approach to hydrogen production outlined in this paper places emphasis on the flexibility of combining glycerol reforming with downstream WGS in one reactor system to furnish CO:H2 mixtures with variable compositions.</p>
<p>This integrated catalytic system displayed 100% carbon conversion of concentrated glycerol solutions (3080 wt.%) into CO2 and CO, with a hydrogen yield equal to 80% of the amount that would ideally be obtained from the stoichiometric conversion of glycerol to H2 and CO followed by equilibrated water-gas shift with the water present in the feed.</p>
<p>To examine the viability of the dual-bed system we must consider the loss in energy efficiency associated with the processing of dilute feedstocks, resulting from water vaporization and the reduction in the H2 content of the effluent while processing more concentrated feedstocks.</p>
