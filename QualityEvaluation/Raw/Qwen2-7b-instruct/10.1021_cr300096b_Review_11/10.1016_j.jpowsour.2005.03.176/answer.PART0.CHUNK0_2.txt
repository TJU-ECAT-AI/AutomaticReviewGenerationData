<p>The conversion of hydrocarbon fuels to H2 can be carried out by several catalytic reaction processes, including steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX) and autothermal reforming (ATR). ATR involves the reaction of oxygen, steam and fuel to produce H2 and CO2. In essence, this process can be viewed as a combination of POX and SR and provides higher energy efficiency than the above processes [8].</p>
<p>The design of ATR catalysts can be challenging, particularly for gasoline/diesel reforming due to the complex and ill-defined nature of the fuel. ATR catalysts have to be active for both steam reforming and partial oxidation, be resistant to high temperatures and tolerant against sulfur poison and coke formation, especially in the catalytic zone with inadequate oxygen concentration.</p>
<p>A method for developing a noble metal catalyst of improved resistance to sulfur compounds has been claimed [13]. The catalytic composition is obtained by subjecting the catalyst containing a noble metal from group VIII or a compound thereof, a halogen and a carrier. For higher hydrocarbons, the catalyst typically comprises of metals such as Pt, Rh, Ru and Ni deposited or incorporated into carefully engineered oxide supports such as ceria-containing oxides [14].</p>
<p>Current interest in bimetallic catalysts is increasing, in particular because they show superior selectivity and resistance to poisoning as well as improved activity and stability. The main objective of the present work was to determine whether the autothermal reforming activity of Pt can be improved when a second metal is added to the substrate.</p>

1.Autothermal reforming (ATR) combines steam reforming (SR) and partial oxidation (POX) processes, offering higher energy efficiency than either SR or POX alone. It is a promising method for converting hydrocarbon fuels into hydrogen (H2).

2.ATR catalysts are designed to withstand high temperatures, resist sulfur poisoning, and manage coke formation, especially in zones with insufficient oxygen supply. This makes them suitable for gasoline/diesel reforming.

3.A novel approach to enhancing noble metal catalysts' resistance to sulfur compounds involves combining a noble metal from group VIII or a compound thereof with a halogen and a carrier. This method allows for the creation of catalysts capable of reforming higher hydrocarbons, like diesel, using metals such as platinum (Pt), rhodium (Rh), ruthenium (Ru), and nickel (Ni), often deposited or integrated into sophisticated oxide supports, like ceria-based materials.

4.Bimetallic catalysts are gaining attention due to their superior performance in terms of selectivity, resistance to poisoning, and enhanced activity and stability. The study aimed to assess if the autothermal reforming capability of platinum (Pt) could be augmented by incorporating a secondary metal into its substrate.

1.自动热重整（ATR）结合了蒸汽重整（SR）和部分氧化（POX）过程，提供比单独的SR或POX更高的能效。它是一种有前景的方法，用于将碳氢燃料转化为氢气（H2）。

2.ATR催化剂设计以承受高温、抵抗硫污染，并在氧气供应不足的催化区域管理焦炭形成，使其适用于汽油/柴油重整。

3.一种增强贵金属催化剂对硫化合物抵抗力的新方法是将来自第Ⅷ族的贵金属或其化合物与卤素和载体结合。这种方法允许使用铂（Pt）、铑（Rh）、钌（Ru）和镍（Ni）等金属制造能够使用诸如铈基材料的复杂氧化物支持来重整较高碳氢化合物的催化剂。

4.双金属催化剂正在获得关注，因为它们在选择性、抗中毒能力、活性和稳定性方面表现出优越性能。研究旨在评估是否可以在其基体中添加第二种金属来增强铂（Pt）的自动热重整能力。
