<p>The conversion of hydrocarbon fuels to H2 can be carried out by several catalytic reaction processes, including steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX) and autothermal reforming (ATR). ATR involves the reaction of oxygen, steam and fuel to produce H2 and CO2.</p>
<p>In order to avoid storing high-pressure hydrogen, the fuel can be generated in an onboard fuel processor.</p>
<p>The design of ATR catalysts can be challenging, particularly for gasoline/diesel reforming due to the complex and ill-defined nature of the fuel.</p>
<p>A method for developing a noble metal catalyst of improved resistance to sulfur compounds has been claimed.</p>
<p>The catalytic composition is obtained by subjecting the catalyst containing a noble metal from group VIII or a compound thereof, a halogen and a carrier.</p>
<p>For higher hydrocarbons, the catalyst typically comprises of metals such as Pt, Rh, Ru and Ni deposited or incorporated into carefully engineered oxide supports such as ceria-containing oxides.</p>
<p>Current interest in bimetallic catalysts is increasing, in particular because they show superior selectivity and resistance to poisoning as well as improved activity and stability.</p>
<p>The autothermal reforming activity of Pt can be improved when a second metal is added to the substrate.</p>
<p>The higher intrinsic activity and sulfur tolerance of the bimetallic catalysts was further studied by conducting surface characterization studies in order to explain the phenomenon involved in the improved performance.</p>

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing the efficiency of converting hydrocarbon fuels into hydrogen. Its key advantages include:

1. Higher product yield: Bimetallic catalysts can increase the yield of hydrogen compared to monometallic catalysts, optimizing the conversion process.

2. Reduced environmental impact: By improving the selectivity and resistance to poisoning, bimetallic catalysts minimize the formation of unwanted byproducts, thus reducing pollution.

3. Practical implementation: The enhanced stability and activity of bimetallic catalysts make them more reliable and easier to integrate into existing fuel processing systems, facilitating their widespread adoption.
