1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in acrolein through the architecture of bimetallic surface structures. This approach is advantageous because it results in a higher yield of desired products compared to conventional processes, has a lower environmental impact by minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts, and can lead to more efficient and sustainable energy and chemical production processes upon practical implementation.
