Reactions of methanol and ethylene glycol on Ni/Pt: Bridging the materials gap between single crystal and polycrystalline bimetallic surfaces
Abstract
The catalytic decompositions of methanol and ethylene glycol on polycrystalline Ni/Pt surfaces were used as model probe reactions to explore oxygenate reforming for H2 production. In the current study we evaluated whether favorable chemistry observed on single crystal Ni/Pt(111) can be extended to more commercially relevant polycrystalline surfaces, thus bridging the “materials gap”. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) confirmed that two distinct bimetallic configurations can be formed for the Ni/Pt system, each possessing unique chemical properties: one with the surface enriched in Ni atoms, designated NiPtPt, and the other with the subsurface region enriched in Ni atoms, designated PtNiPt. Consistent with single crystal studies, temperature programmed desorption (TPD) revealed that the NiPtPt configuration was more active for reforming to CO and H2 than either polycrystalline Pt or PtNiPt. High-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) confirmed the presence of strongly bound reaction intermediates on NiPtPt, including aldehyde-like species, which was also observed on Ni–Pt–Pt(111). The strongly bound reaction intermediates most likely contribute to the high reforming activity observed on NiPtPt. Overall, TPD and HREELS results on polycrystalline surfaces were in general consistent with their single crystal counterparts for the reforming of oxygenates.
1. Introduction
Oxygenates such as methanol and ethylene glycol can be reformed to produce CO and H2 on various transition metal surfaces. Facile reforming of biomass-derived oxygenates to H2 and CO provides for a renewable route to a hydrogen economy. Additionally, oxygenates such as ethylene glycol are considered as model probe molecules for reforming of larger polyols and sugars, including glycerol, sorbitol, and glucose
[1]
. While Pt has been identified as a promising catalyst for this chemistry, Ni based catalysts have also been found to be active to ethylene glycol decomposition but suffer selectivity loss from alkane production
[2]
.
Bimetallic catalysts offer a means of reducing precious metal loadings both by replacing bulk atoms with a less expensive substitute and by increasing the activity and selectivity for desired products. In many cases the bimetallic surfaces have been shown to possess chemical properties different from either of the parent metals

. Recent work has shown that deposition of 3d transition metals on a Pt(111) surface can lead to the modification of binding energies of adsorbates, leading to enhanced activities for hydrogenation of alkenes

[12]
and reforming of oxygenates, including methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol
[13]
,
[14]
,
[15]
.
For single crystal Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, there are two well characterized bimetallic surface structures as confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy ion spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)
[16]
. When Ni is deposited onto Pt(111) at room temperature Ni grows in a layer-by-layer manner, leading to the formation of the surface monolayer structure, which is designated as Ni–Pt–Pt(111). Either depositing a monolayer of Ni onto Pt(111) at 600 K or annealing the Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surface to 600 K creates a subsurface monolayer structure due to thermally-induced diffusion of Ni atoms into the second atomic layer, which is designated as Pt–Ni–Pt(111). Once cooled to room temperature the subsurface structure remains stable in ultra high vacuum (UHV), as confirmed by AES
[17]
.
The Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces display chemical properties that are different from both Ni(111) and Pt(111). For example, density functional theory (DFT) modeling indicates that the binding energies of CH3OH and methoxy (CH3O) decrease significantly on Pt–Ni–Pt(111) as compared to Pt(111) or Ni(111), while the binding energies on Ni–Pt–Pt(111) are greater than on either of the parent metal surfaces
[13]
. Such trends have also been observed for the adsorption of ethylene glycol (C2H4(OH)2). The binding energies of C2H4(OH)2, HOC2H4O and OC2H4O have been shown to follow the trend of Pt–Ni–Pt(111) < Pt(111) < Ni–Pt–Pt(111), leading to higher reforming activities on the latter surface
[18]
. The difference in binding energies can be attributed to changes in the d-band density of states
[19]
,
[20]
. As the center of the d-band moves closer to the Fermi level, as is the case for Ni–Pt–Pt(111), more bonding and anti-bonding states are available near the Fermi level, generally increasing binding energies. On the other hand, a shift of the d-band center away from the Fermi level generally results in more weakly bonded adsorbates, as is the case for the Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface. Nearly linear trends for the binding energies of many adsorbates as a function of d-band center have been established for a wide variety of surfaces
[20]
and are consistent with the theory of chemisorption by Hammer and Nørskov
[21]
.
In this work, we extend the Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces to a polycrystalline Pt substrate. The decompositions of CH3OH and C2H4(OH)2 are used as probe reactions to bridge the “materials gap” between single crystal and polycrystalline bimetallic surfaces. TPD results will be presented first to give a quantitative analysis of the reforming activity and selectivity. These results are followed by HREELS studies to compare the surface reaction intermediates of the polycrystalline Pt, PtNiPt, and NiPtPt surfaces.

shows low decomposition activity under UHV conditions. On Ni(111) methanol decomposes to form CO and H2. Generally, methanol has been shown to decompose on the majority of transition metal surfaces through initial O–H bond scission to form surface methoxy (CH3O).
Reactions of ethylene glycol have been studied previously on several surfaces
[38]
, including Pt(111)
[14]
and Ni(100)
[39]
. Similar to methanol, ethylene glycol decomposes through initial O–H bond scission to produce an ethylenedioxy (OCH2CH2O) intermediate on most surfaces. On Ni(100)
[39]
complete decomposition to atomic C and O is the dominant pathway while on Pt(111)
[14]
ethylene glycol undergoes primarily the reforming pathway to produce CO and H2.
2. Experimental methods
2.1. Techniques
Two UHV chambers were utilized to conduct TPD and HREELS experiments. The TPD chamber was a two level, stainless steel chamber with a base pressure of 1 × 10−10 Torr and was equipped with a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for AES analysis and a sputter gun for cleaning, as described previously
[40]
. The chamber also contained a quadrapole mass spectrometer (QMS) for TPD experiments and for in situ verification of reagent purity and allowed for simultaneous monitoring of up to 12 masses.
The HREELS chamber was a three level, stainless steel chamber with a base pressure of 5 × 10−10 Torr and was similarly equipped with AES, QMS, and sputter gun in the top two levels and HREELS in the bottom level, as described previously
[41]
. HREEL spectra were acquired with a primary beam energy of 6 eV and angles of incidence and reflection were 60° with respect to the surface normal. The count rates were typically about 104 counts per second (cps) with spectral resolution of about 55 cm−1 full width at half maximum. The relatively poor resolution was due to the polycrystalline nature of the Pt substrate. Each HREEL spectrum was normalized to unity using the elastic peak and is labeled with the appropriate scaling factor.
The sample studied in both chambers was a polycrystalline Pt foil (Alfa Aesar, 99.997%), which was spot welded to two Ta posts that served as electrical contacts for resistive heating as well as thermal contacts for liquid nitrogen cooling. In this manner temperature could be varied between 100 and 1100 K. The sample temperature was measured by spot welding a K-type thermocouple to the back of the foil.
The surface morphology of the Pt foil has been characterized in detail in the literature. For example, photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) was used to image NO reduction by NH3 under reaction conditions
[42]
. The authors were able to identify the (100) portions of the foil that made up a significant portion of the overall surface. Additionally, the presence of the (100) face is suggested from the glancing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) spectrum of a polycrystalline Pt foil in
Fig. 1
. In addition to the (111) peak, an intense XRD feature is detected for the (2 0 0) plane, related to the presence of the (100) face that is forbidden by the XRD selection rule. A relatively minor feature is observed for the (2 2 0) plane, which is related to the presence of the (1 1 0) face. Although it is difficult to quantitatively derive the surface fractions of the different planes from the XRD measurements,
Fig. 1
strongly suggests that the surface of the Pt foil consists of both the (111) and (100) planes.

2.2. Preparation of bimetallic surfaces
The clean Pt and the bimetallic surfaces were prepared in the same manner in both chambers. To prepare a clean Pt surface, the sample was first subjected to Ne+ sputtering at 500 K at 2 kV beam voltage for 50 min with a sample current typically about 10 μA. The sample was then titrated in O2 at 700 K to remove residual carbon followed by annealing to 1050 K. This process was repeated until negligible impurities were present as confirmed by AES. Both Ne and O2 were of research grade and used without further purification.
To prepare the bimetallic surfaces, Ni was deposited onto the clean Pt substrate at 300 K. This was accomplished by resistively heating a W wire (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%) that had been tightly wrapped with high purity Ni wire (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%). Ni was deposited until the peak to peak Ni (848 eV)/Pt (241 eV) AES ratio was approximately 1.7. This corresponds to about 1 ML of Ni on Pt as estimated by standard substrate/overlayer calculations
[43]
, with the assumption that Ni grows on Pt in a layer-by-layer manner and that 1 ML Ni on Pt foil is similar to 1 ML Ni on Pt(111). The ML Ni on Pt is designated as NiPtPt.
The surface monolayer Ni could then be driven into the subsurface region to create the PtNiPt subsurface structure
[43]
. The NiPtPt surface was annealed to 725 K in vacuum for 30 s, resulting in a Ni (848 eV)/Pt (241 eV) AES ratio of about 0.8. This ratio corresponds to the PtNiPt subsurface configuration, where the subsurface region is enriched in Ni atoms and the surface is enriched in Pt
[43]
. Previous studies of the stability of the NiPtPt surface on polycrystalline Pt indicated that the bimetallic surface remained stable in UHV up to 600 K, at which point surface Ni atoms began to diffuse into the subsurface region
[43]
.
2.3. TPD experiments
In the TPD chamber monolayer coverage of CH3OH (Sigma–Aldrich, 99.9+%) and C2H4(OH)2 (Sigma–Aldrich, 99.8%) was achieved after 2 L (1 L = 1×10−6 Torr s) exposure, which was used for all TPD experiments. All exposures are uncorrected for ion gauge sensitivity. The two liquid samples were purified with successive freeze-pump-thaw cycles and sample purity was verified using QMS. CH3OH was dosed at 100 K. C2H4(OH)2 was dosed at 200 K to prevent the adsorption of water, which was always present in the liquid sample because H2O is easily miscible in C2H4(OH)2 at room temperature. TPD experiments were performed with a linear heating rate of 3 K/s to 1100 K.
2.4. HREELS experiments
In the HREELS chamber, monolayer coverage of CH3OH was achieved after 4 L while C2H4(OH)2 saturated the surface after 2 L. The lower saturation exposure for C2H4(OH)2 was due to an increase in the local partial pressure by a directional doser used for introducing C2H4(OH)2 into the HREELS the chamber. The dosing temperatures were the same as described in the TPD experiments. Afterwards, the sample was flashed to the temperature of interest and allowed to cool back to 100 K before the HREEL spectra were recorded.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Reforming of methanol
A combination of TPD and HREELS studies was performed on the Pt, PtNiPt and NiPtPt surfaces to both quantify the activity and selectivity as well as to identify surface reaction intermediates. The TPD spectra resulting from 2 L exposure are compared in
Fig. 2
. Monolayer desorption of methanol occurred at 188 K on Pt and 177 K on PtNiPt. The molecular desorption peak from NiPtPt was very weak, suggesting that most adsorbed methanol underwent decomposition on the NiPtPt surface (see
Fig. 2
d).

Fig. 2. TPD spectra of (a) H2, (b) CH4, (c) CO, and (d) CH3OH following 2 L CH3OH.
The desorption of the H2 product was detected from all three surfaces at 297 K, while the Pt and PtNiPt spectra exhibited a higher temperature shoulder a 354 K, probably due to contributions from the Pt(100) portions of the polycrystalline foil (see
Fig. 2
a). The evolution of H2 from the PtNiPt surface was reaction-limited as desorption of H2 from this surface started to occur at ∼170 K
[44]
. There was no evidence of CH4 desorption from Pt or PtNiPt, consistent with previous TPD experiments from the corresponding single crystal surfaces
[13]
; however, some CH3OH decomposed to form CH4 on NiPtPt, probably due to highly active sites such as step edges and defects on the polycrystalline foil (see
Fig. 2
b). The desorption of the CO product occurred from Pt at 530 K, consistent with the desorption temperature from previous UHV studies of molecularly adsorbed CO from Pt foil
[45]
. CO desorbed from PtNiPt as two convoluted peaks at 408 K and 480 K (see
Fig. 2
c). The lower temperature peak at 408 K was consistent with single crystal studies of Pt–Ni–Pt(111)
[13]
and the higher temperature peak at 480 K was likely due to desorption from predominately the Pt–Ni–Pt(100) portions of the Pt foil. From NiPtPt, CO desorbed as a single broad peak at 445 K, also consistent with that from Ni–Pt–Pt(111)
[13]
.
The TPD results indicate that CH3OH decomposes on Pt and Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces via the following reaction pathways:
(1)
(2)
(3)
where x, y, z represent the amount of chemisorbed CH3OH that is decomposing via each reaction pathway. Integrating the peak areas of the reaction products (see
Fig. 2
a–c) allows for quantification of activity and selectivity for each decomposition reaction pathway, using a procedure similar to one described previously
[13]
,
[46]
. Briefly, assuming the saturation coverages of H2 and CO on Pt foil are similar to the values on Pt(111), previous saturation values of
H2/Pt
[47]
,
CO/Pt
[48]
on Pt(111) were used to relate TPD peak areas to surface coverage. Since CO is only produced in reaction (1), the value of x can be determined directly using Eq. (4):
(4)
where
and
are the TPD areas of the 28 amu peaks from saturation CO desorption and CH3OH decomposition, respectively. Similarly, the value of y can be determined with a mass balance on the total H2 production according to Eq. (5):
(5)
where
and
are the TPD areas of the 2 amu peaks from saturation H2 desorption and CH3OH decomposition, respectively. Experiments were performed to scale the QMS sensitivity for 16 amu with respect to the sensitivity for 28 amu using equal partial pressures of methane and CO, denoted
/
[41]
. Since CH4 is produced only in reaction (3), the value of z can be determined according to equation (6):
(6)
where
is the TPD area of the 16 amu peak from CH3OH decomposition.
The activity and selectivity, derived from the TPD results in
Fig. 2
, are compared in
Table 1
for the three surfaces. Contradictory to experiments on Pt(111), the presence of the (100) regions in the Pt foil leads to CH3OH decomposition. In addition to the possible contributions from the (100) portions of the surface, it is possible that defect sites and grain boundaries are also active to this chemistry. However, it is difficult to quantify without well-controlled surface science experiments on highly stepped surfaces and the corresponding DFT calculations. For the same reason, the Pt–Ni–Pt surface showed higher activity toward decomposition than that on Pt–Ni–Pt(111)
[13]
. The most important observation in
Table 1
is that NiPtPt is the most active for reforming CH3OH to H2 and CO, with a reforming selectivity of 88%. The observation of higher reforming activity of the NiPtPt surface is consistent with previous results on single crystal surfaces, where Ni–Pt–Pt(111) is more active than Pt–Ni–Pt(111) and Pt(111)
[13]
.

HREELS studies provide complimentary information regarding the reaction intermediates for CH3OH decomposition, as shown in
Fig. 3
. A summary of peak assignment for all three surfaces can be found in
Table 2
. At least a fraction of CH3OH adsorbed molecularly on Pt at 100 K, as evidenced by the detection of the ν(OH) mode centered at about 3300 cm−1 in
Fig. 3
a; however, this peak was less intense on the bimetallic surfaces, suggesting that the extent of dissociative adsorption was greater on bimetallic surfaces. A decrease in the intensity of the ν(OH) peak by 200 K indicated that O–H bond scission had occurred on all three surfaces and that decomposition occurred at least in part via a methoxy (CH3O) intermediate. The main spectroscopic difference between adsorbed methanol and the methoxy intermediate is the absence of the ν(OH) mode in the latter. Although the vibrational frequencies of the other modes are expected to be slightly different between the two species, they are not clearly resolved due to the relatively poor resolution in the HREELS measurements. The decomposition pathway on NiPtPt appeared to be distinct at 200 K. As shown in
Fig. 3
b, by 200 K a new peak was present on the Ni–Pt–Pt surface at 1752 cm−1, which is tentatively assigned to the ν(CO) mode of aldehyde-like species not di-σ bonded through CO
[49]
,
[50]
. The observation of this species is consistent with single crystal studies of Ni–Pt–Pt(111) that have identified a formaldehyde intermediate for CH3OH decomposition

Features near 3600 cm−1 are due to surface hydroxyl species from the dissociative adsorption of water.
As shown in
Fig. 3
c, in addition to the reduction of features related to methoxy due to heating to 300 K, a relatively weak feature is observed at 1583 cm−1, which can be tentatively assigned to a di-σ bonded CO species from an aldehyde-like intermediate. After heating to 400 K the decomposition had proceeded mostly to completion on the three surfaces, with the remaining surface species being CO, trace amounts of CHx fragments from the decomposition of methoxy, and O–H from the dissociative adsoption of H2O from UHV background. These were evidenced by a strong M–CO vibration at 2036 cm−1, a residual νas(CHx) peak at 2949 cm−1, and a M–OH vibration at 3626 cm−1. A relatively intense peak was detected at 1008 cm−1 on Pt; more detailed studies using deuterated methanol are needed to assign this feature.
3.2. Reforming of ethylene glycol
The TPD spectra resulting from 2 L exposure of C2H4(OH)2 are shown in
Fig. 4
. Monolayer desorption of C2H4(OH)2 occurred at 209 K on Pt and PtNiPt. Similar to CH3OH, monolayer desorption of C2H4(OH)2 from NiPtPt was apparent only as a very small peak (see
Fig. 4
d), indicating that NiPtPt was more active toward C2H4(OH)2 decomposition. The absence of a multilayer peak was expected because C2H4(OH)2 was dosed at 200 K, above the temperature for multilayer desorption
[14]
. The H2 product was detected from all three surfaces at about 300 K and the PtNiPt surface contained an additional feature at 355 K (see
Fig. 4
a), which can be attributed to the Pt–Ni–Pt(100) portions of the Pt foil. CH4 desorbed at 255 K and 309 K from Pt, at 320 K from PtNiPt, and at 302 K from NiPtPt, see
Fig. 4
b, indicating that methanation occurred readily on all three surfaces. Similar to methanol, the desorption of the CO product was desorption limited on Pt foil
[45]
and occurred at 525 K, as shown in
Fig. 4
c. On PtNiPt CO desorbed as two convoluted peaks centered at 400 K and 490 K, and as a single, broad peak on NiPtPt at 445 K, consistent with studies of C2H4(OH)2 reforming on single crystal Ni–Pt–Pt(111)
[14]
. The area of the 28 amu peak was twice as large for NiPtPt as compared to PtNiPt or Pt foil, suggesting a higher reforming activity on NiPtPt.

Fig. 4. TPD spectra of (a) H2, (b) CH4, (c) CO, and (d) C2H4(OH)2 following 2 L C2H4(OH)2.
The TPD results indicate that C2H4(OH)2 decomposes on Pt and Ni/Pt via the following reaction pathways:
(7)
(8)
(9)
where a, b, c represent the amount of C2H4(OH)2 decomposing via each reaction pathway. Reaction (7) is the most desirable reaction for reforming, as it produces only CO and H2. The activity and selectivity of each C2H4(OH)2 decomposition pathway can be calculated using a procedure similar to that for CH3OH. Briefly, since CO is produced only in reaction (7), the value of a can be found directly using Eq. (10):
(10)
where
is the TPD area of the 28 amu peak from C2H4(OH)2 decomposition. Similarly, since CH4 is produced only in reaction (9), the value of c can be determined according to Eq. (11):
(11)
where
is the TPD area of the 16 amu peak from C2H4(OH)2 decomposition. Finally, as the H2 product appears in all reaction pathways, a H2 mass balance can be used to determine the value for b according to Eq. (12):
(12)
where
is the TPD area of the 2 amu peak from C2H4(OH)2 decomposition.
A summary of activity and selectivity for C2H4(OH)2 decomposition is shown in
Table 3
. Consistent with single crystal studies, the NiPtPt surface was more active to C2H4(OH)2 decomposition than PtNiPt or Pt; however, one difference compared to single crystal studies was the observation of a small amount of CH4 product from all three surfaces via reaction pathway (9)
[14]
. While Ni–Pt–Pt(111) reformed C2H4(OH)2 to CO and H2 with 86% selectivity, the selectivity on NiPtPt was only 36%
[14]

As shown in

, HREELS experiments provide complimentary information regarding the reaction intermediates for C2H4(OH)2 decomposition on Pt and Ni/Pt. A summary of peak assignments is shown in
Table 4
. At least a fraction of C2H4(OH)2 adsorbed molecularly with the O–H bond intact on Pt and PtNiPt as evidenced by the ν(OH) mode centered at about 3300 cm−1 and shown in
Fig. 5
a, consistent with single crystal studies
[18]
. This mode was not detected on the NiPtPt surface, suggesting that this surface was more active to O–H bond scission at 200 K. As shown in
Fig. 5
b, after heating the sample to 250 K the ν(OH) mode disappeared and there was an increase in the M–CO vibration, located at 2056, 2036 and 2029 cm−1, respectively, on these surfaces. This result is consistent with TPD studies which showed the onset of H2 desorption at about 250 K on these surfaces, indicating that C2H4(OH)2 had already decomposed, at least in part, to CO and H2 by 250 K. The reduction in intensity of the ν(OH) mode results from O–H bond scission and suggests that the dominant intermediates are likely alkoxide (–OCH2CH2OH) and ethylenedioxy (–OCH2CH2O–) species
[51]
,
[52]
. The main spectroscopic difference between adsorbed ethylene glycol and the ethylenedioxy intermediate is the absence of the ν(OH) mode in the latter. Although the vibrational frequencies of the other modes are expected to be slightly different between the two species, they are not clearly resolved due to the relatively poor resolution in the HREELS measurements. This conclusion is consistent with DFT and HREELS studies of single crystal surfaces
[18]
. As shown in
Fig. 5
c, by 300 K bridge bonded CO was dominant on NiPtPt as evidenced by the relative intensity of the bridge bonded ν(CO) vibration at 1880 cm−1 compared to linearly bonded ν(CO) mode at 2029 cm−1. On the other hand, linearly bonded CO was dominant on the PtNiPt surface as evidenced by similar peak intensities at 1847 and 2036 cm−1. By 400 K, CO and remaining CHx fragments were the only detectable surface intermediates, as shown in
Fig. 5
d. This is consistent with TPD data which showed that CO desorbed from PtNiPt and NiPtPt at 445 K and from Pt at 525 K.

3.3. General trend in reforming activity on Pt, PtNiPt and NiPtPt surfaces
The reforming activities follow the trend of NiPtPt >> PtNiPt > Pt. Similar to that described on single crystal Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surface
[13]
,
[18]
, the increased activity on polycrystalline NiPtPt is likely due to strong adsorbate binding energies resulting from a shift in the Fermi level toward the d-band center, as compared to Pt. Additionally, the strong bonding on NiPtPt facilitates C–C bond cleavage, resulting in increased methanation activity of C2H4(OH)2 on NiPtPt as compared to PtNiPt or clean Pt.
The trend in reforming activity on polycrystalline surfaces was similar to single crystal Pt(111)
[13]
,
[14]
. Since Pt foil is principally a combination of Pt(111) and Pt(100) surfaces this trend is not surprising. For single crystal Ni/Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(100), calculations for the binding energies of multiple adsorbates have shown that the energies decreased on these surfaces as follows: Ni–Pt–Pt(111) > Pt(111) > Pt–Ni–Pt(111) and Ni–Pt–Pt(100) > Pt(100) > Pt–Ni–Pt(100)
[43]
. As was true for single crystal surfaces, strong interactions between adsorbates and the polycrystalline surface contribute to the high reforming activity in the NiPtPt surface configuration. The principle difference between single crystal and polycrystalline Pt is the formation of methane. Although the selectivity to methane was at most 6% for polycrystalline materials, methane was not observed for CH3OH or C2H4(OH)2 decomposition on single crystals
[13]
,
[14]
. As the Pt(100) plane is known to be more active than the Pt(111) plane
[43]
, the presence of Pt(100) in polycrystalline Pt likely contributes to C–C bond scission and methane production.
On the other hand, the reforming activities of oxygenates (
Table 1
,
Table 3
) on subsurface PtNiPt are higher than Pt, which is the opposite of the trend between Pt–Ni–Pt(111) and Pt(111). This difference is most likely related to the incomplete diffusion of surface Ni into the subsurface region on polycrystalline Pt, leaving portions of the bimetallic surface with more active NiPtPt structures. More detailed characterization, such as the utilization of LEIS to determine the composition of the top-most later, will be needed to further understand the difference.
4. Conclusions
The reactions of CH3OH and C2H4(OH)2 have been studied on polycrystalline Pt, PtNiPt and NiPtPt to assess whether previous studies of single crystal surfaces are relevant to more practical polycrystalline materials. The following conclusions can be drawn from this work:
(1)
TPD, HREELS, and DFT studies of single crystal surfaces have previously identified Ni–Pt–Pt(111) as an effective bimetallic surface for reforming CH3OH and C2H4(OH)2 because of higher binding energies of oxygenates and the reaction intermediates. Similar to the single crystal counterparts, stronger binding energies of adsorbates on polycrystalline NiPtPt also make this an effective bimetallic surface for oxygenate reforming. The similar trend demonstrates the possibility to bridge the “materials gap” and suggests that promising chemistry seen on single crystal surfaces could be relevant to more practical polycrystalline materials.
(2)
HREELS results suggest that O–H bond scission is probably the first step in the decomposition for both oxygenates on polycrystalline Pt, PtNiPt, and NiPtPt surfaces. Thus, similar to single crystal surfaces, the binding energies of the deprotonated intermediates are an important parameter in controlling the initial decomposition of oxygenates.
(3)
In contrast to single crystal surfaces, subsurface PtNiPt shows higher reforming activities than Pt for the reforming of CH3OH and C2H4(OH)2. This difference is likely due to incomplete diffusion of surface Ni into the subsurface region on polycrystalline Pt.
