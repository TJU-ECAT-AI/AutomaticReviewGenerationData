[1] "Adsorption and desorption of methanol, ethanol and water on Pt(lll) and two, ordered, Pt-Sn alloys has been studied primarily using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) mass spectroscopy."
[2] "The two alloys studied were the p(2 × 2)Sn/Pt( 111 ) and ( × f3)R30 " Sn/Pt( 111 ) surface alloys prepared by vapor deposition of Sn on Pt( 111 ), with 0s. =0.25 and 0.33, respectively."
[3] "The two Pt Sn surface alloys were found to chemisorb both methanol and ethanol slightly more weakly than on the Pt( l I 1 ) surface."
[4] "Water is only weakly adsorbed on all three surfaces studied and a thermally stabilized bilayer structure is formed on the two alloy surfaces similarly to Pt(111 )."
[5] "In general, for all three molecules, a trend is observed for a small decrease in the desorption activation energies with increasing Sn concentration in the series Pt(111 ), (2 x 2) alloy and alloy surfaces, with a relatively larger influence upon forming the alloy."

1. The study investigates the adsorption and desorption of methanol, ethanol, and water on Pt(lll) and two ordered Pt-Sn alloy surfaces using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) mass spectroscopy.
2. The Pt-Sn alloy surfaces were prepared by vapor deposition of Sn on Pt(111), with coverage ratios of 0.25 and 0.33 for the two alloys.
3. The Pt-Sn alloy surfaces chemisorb methanol and ethanol slightly less strongly than the pure Pt(lll) surface.
4. Water forms a thermally stable bilayer structure on the alloy surfaces similar to Pt(111), indicating weak adsorption.
5. There is a trend of decreasing desorption activation energy with increasing Sn concentration in the series Pt(lll), (2 x 2) alloy, and alloy surfaces, with a larger influence in the formation of the alloy.

1. 研究使用温度程序脱附（TPD）质谱法研究了甲醇、乙醇和水在Pt(lll)和两个有序的Pt-Sn合金表面的吸附和解吸附。
2. Pt-Sn合金表面通过蒸气沉积Sn在Pt(111)上制备，两种合金的覆盖度比分别为0.25和0.33。
3. Pt-Sn合金表面在化学吸附甲醇和乙醇时略弱于纯Pt(lll)表面。
4. 水在所有三个表面上仅弱吸附，并在合金表面上形成类似Pt(111)的热稳定双层结构。
5. 随着Sn浓度的增加，在Pt(lll)，(2 x 2)合金和合金表面系列中观察到脱附活化能逐渐降低的趋势，形成合金时的影响较大。
