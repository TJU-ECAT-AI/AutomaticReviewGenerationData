[1] "The oxidation of methanol on different metal catalysts has been studied [3-8]. The principle limitation in using an electrode (electrocatalyst) with a viable organic fuel is the poisoning of the electrode by some intermediate and/or product produced by the reaction."
[2] "The most active catalysts for methanol oxidation are defined as those having a low surface concentration of all poisoning species. These are either platinum catalysts promoted by electrodeposition of certain metals [11 ] or alloys of platinum such as Pt-Ru [12-14] or Pt-Sn [13-19]."
[3] "For the Pt-Sn systems, there are controversies about the state of Sn in these catalysts and the activity of such electrodes. Most reports [13,15-17] state that Pt-Sn appears to be the most active catalyst in a sulfuric acid solution at a temperature above 40C."
[4] "In contrast, others report either an inhibition or an activity comparable to that of pure Pt [14,18,19]."
[5] "The interaction of water with transition metal surfaces is also an important topic for discussion of the electrode chemistry in electro-oxidation of alcohols."
[6] "Our data provide benchmarks for discussing the surface chemistry of alcohols on Pt-Sn alloys, opening the road for an improved understanding of electro-oxidation and catalysis of alcohols and other oxygenated molecules on bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts."

1. The primary challenge in utilizing metal catalysts for organic fuel oxidation is the catalyst poisoning caused by intermediates or products generated during the reaction. Active catalysts are characterized by a low surface concentration of poisoning species.

2. The most effective catalysts for methanol oxidation are platinum-based catalysts enhanced by specific metals through electrodeposition or alloys of platinum, such as Pt-Ru or Pt-Sn. 

3. The majority of reports indicate that Pt-Sn catalysts exhibit the highest activity in sulfuric acid solutions at temperatures above 40°C. 

4. Contrary findings suggest that Pt-Sn catalysts may either inhibit or match the activity of pure platinum under certain conditions.

5. The study of water interaction with transition metal surfaces is crucial for understanding the electrode chemistry in the electro-oxidation of alcohols.

6. The findings offer a standard for analyzing alcohol interactions with Pt-Sn alloys, facilitating a deeper insight into the electro-oxidation and catalysis of alcohols and other oxygen-containing molecules on bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts.
