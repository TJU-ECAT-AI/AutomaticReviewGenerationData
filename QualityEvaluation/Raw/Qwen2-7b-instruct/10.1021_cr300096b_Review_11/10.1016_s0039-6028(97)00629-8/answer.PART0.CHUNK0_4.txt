1. The use of simple organic molecules like methanol, ethanol, formic acid, and formaldehyde as future electrochemical fuels offers several advantages, crucial among which is their interaction with the electrode surface.

2. The performance of catalysts in methanol oxidation processes is largely determined by their ability to minimize the surface concentration of toxic species.

3. The incorporation of tin (Sn) into the surface layer of platinum-silver (Pt-Sn) alloys poses an intriguing question regarding how it might affect the chemistry of methanol and ethanol adsorption and oxidation.

4. Despite the presence of Sn in the surface layer of Pt-Sn alloys, water molecules maintain a stable bilayer structure, akin to that on a pure platinum (Pt(111)) surface.

5. The adsorption and desorption properties of water on Pt-Sn alloy surfaces remain largely unchanged, even as there's evidence suggesting a slight weakening of the direct interaction between water molecules and the surface with increased Sn concentration.

6. The data generated from this research provides a foundational framework for understanding the surface chemistry of alcohols on Pt-Sn alloys, paving the way for enhanced insights into the electro-oxidation and catalysis of alcohols and other oxygen-containing molecules on these bimetallic catalysts.
