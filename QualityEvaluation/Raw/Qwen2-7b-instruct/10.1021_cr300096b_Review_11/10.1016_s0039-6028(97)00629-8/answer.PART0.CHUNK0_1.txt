[1] "The use of simple organic molecules such as methanol, ethanol, formic acid and formaldehyde as future electrochemical fuels has several advantages. In addition to their high energy density [ 1 ], they are relatively nontoxic and easy to store and handle."
[2] "Crucial to the operation of these electrochemical systems is the interaction of the fuel with the electrode surface."
[3] "The oxidation of methanol on different metal catalysts has been studied [3-8]. The principle limitation in using an electrode (electrocatalyst) with a viable organic fuel is the poisoning of the electrode by some intermediate and/or product produced by the reaction."
[4] "For the Pt-Sn systems, there are controversies about the state of Sn in these catalysts and the activity of such electrodes."
[5] "The interaction of water with transition metal surfaces is also an important topic for discussion of the electrode chemistry in electro-oxidation of alcohols."
[6] "In order to aid discussion and resolution of the controversies discussed above and to provide a firm foundation for understanding the chemistry relevant to electro-oxidation of alcohols over Sn-promoted Pt electrodes, it is important to define the interactions of simple alcohols with well-defined Pt-Sn alloy surfaces."
[7] "The desorption temperature and desorption activation energy of this bilayer and subsequent condensed layers are unaffected by alloying, even though there is evidence that at very low coverages there is a small weakening of the direct interaction of water molecules with the surface with increasing Sn concentration."
[8] "Our data provide benchmarks for discussing the surface chemistry of alcohols on Pt-Sn alloys, opening the road for an improved understanding of electro-oxidation and catalysis of alcohols and other oxygenated molecules on bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts."
