[1] "The oxidation of methanol on different metal catalysts has been studied [3-8]. The principle limitation in using an electrode (electrocatalyst) with a viable organic fuel is the poisoning of the electrode by some intermediate and/or product produced by the reaction."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing simple organic molecules like methanol, ethanol, formic acid, and formaldehyde as future electrochemical fuels. These molecules are advantageous due to their high energy density, low toxicity, and ease of storage and handling. However, the primary challenge lies in preventing the poisoning of electrodes by intermediates or products generated during the reaction. Despite the potential for poisoning, Pt-Sn alloys show similar adsorption behavior for water on all surfaces studied, indicating that they can maintain stable bilayer structures without significant degradation of the water-molecule interaction strength, even at low coverages. This suggests that Pt-Sn alloys might offer a viable alternative for electrochemical fuel cell applications, potentially improving the sustainability and efficiency of energy production.
