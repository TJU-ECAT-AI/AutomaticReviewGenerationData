[1] "The use of simple organic molecules such as methanol, ethanol, formic acid and formaldehyde as future electrochemical fuels has several advantages. In addition to their high energy density [ 1 ], they are relatively nontoxic and easy to store and handle."
[2] "The oxidation of methanol on different metal catalysts has been studied [3-8]. The principle limitation in using an electrode (electrocatalyst) with a viable organic fuel is the poisoning of the electrode by some intermediate and/or product produced by the reaction."
[3] "Water is only weakly adsorbed on all three surfaces studied and a thermally stabilized bilayer structure is formed on the two alloy surfaces similarly to Pt(111 ). The desorption temperature and desorption activation energy of this bilayer and subsequent condensed layers are unaffected by alloying, even though there is evidence that at very low coverages there is a small weakening of the direct interaction of water molecules with the surface with increasing Sn concentration."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing simple organic molecules like methanol, ethanol, formic acid, and formaldehyde as future electrochemical fuels. These molecules are advantageous due to their high energy density, low toxicity, and ease of storage and handling. However, the primary challenge lies in preventing the poisoning of electrodes by intermediates or products generated during the reaction. Despite the potential for poisoning, Pt-Sn alloys show similar adsorption behavior for water on all surfaces studied, indicating that they can maintain stable bilayer structures without significant degradation of the water-molecule interaction strength, even at low coverages. This suggests that Pt-Sn alloys might offer a viable alternative for electrochemical fuel cell applications, potentially improving the sustainability and efficiency of energy production.

选择性氧化物重整过程通过利用如甲醇、乙醇、甲醛和甲酸等简单的有机分子作为未来的电化学燃料，为可持续能源和化工生产做出了贡献。这些分子因其高能量密度、低毒性以及易于存储和处理而具有优势。然而，使用能够有效阻止电极被反应中间体或产物毒化的电催化剂是主要挑战。尽管存在中毒风险，但研究发现，在所有表面条件下，Pt-Sn合金对水的吸附行为与Pt（111）表面相似，形成了稳定的双层结构，并且在低覆盖度下，随着锡浓度的增加，水分子与表面之间的直接相互作用强度略有减弱。这表明，Pt-Sn合金可能为电化学燃料电池应用提供了一种可行的替代方案，有可能提高能源生产和效率的可持续性和效率。
