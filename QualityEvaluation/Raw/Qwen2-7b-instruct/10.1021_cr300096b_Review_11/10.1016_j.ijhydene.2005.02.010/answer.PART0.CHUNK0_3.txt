[1] "Fuel cell requires hydrogen as its fuel source for generating power."
[2] "It is well known that essentially all hydrocarbon feeds contain sulfur at different concentrations."
[3] "The design of ATR catalysts can be challenging, particularly for gasoline/diesel reforming due to the complex and ill-defined nature of the fuel."
[4] "For transportation applications, the primary focus is on reforming gasoline, because a production and distribution infrastructure already exists."
[5] "For auxiliary power units, the focus is on reforming both gasoline (for automotive applications) and diesel (for trucks and heavy-duty vehicles)."
[6] "The conversion of hydrocarbon fuels to H2 can be carried out by several catalytic reaction processes, including steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX), and autothermal reforming (ATR)."
[7] "In essence, this process can be viewed as a combination of POX and SR and has recently attracted considerable attention due to its higher energy efficiency than the above processes and also low investment process using a simple system design."
[8] "Catalyst formulations for ATR fuel processors depend on the fuel choice and operating temperature."
[9] "The main objective of the present work was to determine whether the autothermal reforming activity of Pt can be improved when a second metal is added to the substrate."
[10] "Three model catalysts were prepared to study the ATR activity of synthetic diesel fuel: Pt, Pd and PtPd catalysts supported on alumina."
[11] "The autothermal reforming activity of these catalysts is shown in Fig. 1."
[12] "Before carrying out the activity tests, all the catalysts were reduced at 350 C in a 5% H2/N2 mixture."
[13] "The most interesting results are obtained from the mixed metal bimetallic PtPd catalysts."
[14] "The TPR profile of the bimetallic PtPd catalyst is not simply the sum of the monometallic Pt and Pd catalysts."
[15] "Significant differences were observed in the XPS spectra of the Pt and/or Pd catalysts supported on alumina."
[16] "In the case of bimetallic PtPd catalysts, the order of impregnation had no effect on the ATR activity."
[17] "The higher level of activities observed over the bimetallic catalysts was further studied by introducing sulfur-containing feeds in the ATR feed stream."
[18] "It is clear from these plots that both the catalysts (PtNi and PtPd) exhibit resistance to sulfur poisoning in contrast to the activity decay observed over the monometallic platinum catalyst."
[19] "The ceria-supported PtNi catalysts are even more active and stronger against deactivation in autothermal reforming of diesel fuel than the corresponding monometallic Ni and Pt catalysts."
[20] "The activity of these catalysts seems to depend on the order of loading of the metals and the formation of different oxidation states during the synthesis of the catalysts."
[21] "The XPS and TPR experiments confirm no synergy between the loaded metals and indicate that the amounts of exposed Ni and Pt sites are different among the catalysts, corresponding with the differences in the catalytic activity and stability."
[22] "The H2-TPR profile of the unreduced bimetallic PdPt catalyst showed marked differences compared to those of the monometallic catalysts."
[23] "While the major hydrogen species desorb at temperatures below 360 C from the bimetallic catalyst, they remain on Pt/Ceria surface at temperatures higher than 400 C."
[24] "The Pd-3d core level spectra for Ptceria, Pdceria and Pt/Pdceria catalysts studied are shown in Fig. 12."
[25] "For the monometallic Pd catalyst, the binding energy of the Pd 3d 5 2 level emerged at 335.4 eV and was assigned to PdO, in accordance with the literature."
[26] "For the bimetallic PtPd catalyst, a decrease in the Pd 3d 5 2 signal together with a positive binding energy shift to 336.5 eV was found."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by improving the efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of converting hydrocarbon fuels to hydrogen. Its key advantages include higher energy efficiency compared to traditional methods, lower investment costs due to simpler system designs, and the ability to utilize existing infrastructure for fuels like gasoline and diesel. This process enhances product yields and minimizes emissions, making it a promising approach for auxiliary power units and portable power generation.

2. The process of selective oxygenate reforming, specifically autothermal reforming (ATR), combines aspects of steam reforming (SR) and partial oxidation (POX), offering higher energy efficiency and low investment costs compared to traditional methods. It utilizes existing infrastructure for fuels such as gasoline and diesel, making it suitable for transportation and auxiliary power applications. By efficiently converting hydrocarbons to hydrogen, ATR supports sustainable energy production and chemical synthesis.

3. The autothermal reforming activity of Pt can be significantly enhanced when a second metal is added to the substrate, leading to improved performance in the conversion of hydrocarbon fuels to hydrogen. This improvement is due to the synergistic interaction between the metals and the catalyst support, resulting in better stability and activity. The addition of metals like Pd and Ni not only boosts the activity but also enhances the catalyst's resistance to sulfur poisoning, making it more effective in real-world applications where sulfur is commonly present in hydrocarbon feeds.

4. The catalytic behavior of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtPd, is closely tied to the presence of electron-deficient Pt species on the Pd surface. These species contribute to the high sulfur tolerance of the catalysts, preventing the formation of bulk sulfides and minimizing spill-over onto the support material. The close interaction between Pt and Pd leads to weakened H-metal bonds, facilitating better activity and selectivity in the autothermal reforming of diesel fuel. This synergy between the metals results in enhanced performance and stability, particularly in the presence of sulfur, making bimetallic catalysts a valuable tool in sustainable energy production and chemical synthesis.

2. 选择性氧化物重整（ATR），结合蒸汽重整（SR）和部分氧化（POX）的特点，提供了与传统方法相比更高的能量效率和较低的投资成本。它利用了汽油和柴油等燃料的现有基础设施，适用于交通运输和辅助电源应用。通过高效地将碳氢化合物转化为氢气，ATR支持了可持续能源生产和化学合成。

3. 当在基质中添加第二种金属时，铂的自动热重整活动可以显著增强，导致氢气生成过程中性能的提升。这种改进归因于金属之间及与催化剂支撑物之间的协同作用，导致了更好的稳定性和活性。添加金属如钯（Pd）和镍（Ni）不仅增强了活性，还提升了催化剂对硫中毒的抵抗力，使其更适合实际应用，在硫通常存在于烃燃料中时，硫中毒是催化剂失活的主要原因。

4. 二元催化剂，例如PtPd，其催化行为紧密依赖于Pt表面存在的电子缺乏Pt物种。这些物种有助于催化剂对硫的高耐受性，防止形成大块硫化物并减少向支撑材料溢出，从而在硫存在的情况下提供更有效的性能。Pt和Pd之间的密切相互作用导致H-金属键变弱，促进更好的活性和选择性，尤其是在硫的存在下，使得二元催化剂成为可持续能源生产和化学合成的宝贵工具。
