<p>For transportation applications, the primary focus is on reforming gasoline, because a production and distribution infrastructure already exists [4,5]. For auxiliary power units, the focus is on reforming both gasoline (for automotive applications [6]) and diesel (for trucks and heavy-duty vehicles [7]). For portable power generation, the focus has been on reforming natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas.</p>
<p>The conversion of hydrocarbon fuels to H2 can be carried out by several catalytic reaction processes, including steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX), and autothermal reforming (ATR). ATR involves the reaction of oxygen, steam, and fuel to produce H2 and CO2. In essence, this process can be viewed as a combination of POX and SR and has recently attracted considerable attention due to its higher energy efficiency than the above processes and also low investment process using a simple system design [8].</p>
<p>Autothermal reforming of synthetic diesel fuel was investigated for potential applications in auxiliary power units. Experimental results revealed that the impregnation of Ni or Pd (in addition to Pt) on alumina or ceria-supported catalysts not only improves the activity but also modifies the catalyst to resist poisoning from sulfur present in the feed. Surface analysis of these formulations showed that the enhanced stability is due to a strong metal-metal and metal-support interaction in the catalyst. The improved performance of the bimetallic catalysts is due to structural and electronic effects rather than the degree of metal dispersion.</p>

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing hydrocarbon fuels more efficiently. Its key advantages include higher energy efficiency, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and simplified system design for cost-effective implementation. Compared to traditional methods, this process can yield more hydrogen with less waste, making it a promising approach for renewable energy sources.

2. The process focuses on reforming gasoline, diesel, and natural gas for various applications such as transportation, auxiliary power units, and portable power generation. It combines the benefits of steam reforming and partial oxidation, offering a more efficient and economical solution for hydrogen production.

3. The bimetallic catalysts, containing Pt, Ni, or Pd, show superior performance in autothermal reforming of diesel fuel. They improve activity, resist sulfur poisoning, and maintain stability due to strong metal-metal and metal-support interactions. The enhanced performance is attributed to structural and electronic effects within the catalyst, rather than just metal dispersion.
