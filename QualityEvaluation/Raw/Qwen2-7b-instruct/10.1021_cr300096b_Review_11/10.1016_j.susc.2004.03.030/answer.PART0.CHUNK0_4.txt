[1] "Selective molecular-level information on the interaction of NO2 with metal surfaces has inhibited understanding catalytic reaction mechanisms involving nitrogen oxides."
[2] "Compared to Pt catalysts, PtSn reforming catalysts have greater resistance to coking and increased selectivity to aromatics."
[3] "Specifically, the effect of tin oxidation on the kinetics of CO oxidation by O2 on an α-Al2O3 supported, PtSn catalyst has been studied by Grass and Lintz."
[4] "These sensor systems are also complicated materials systems that could benefit greatly by surface science model studies that address the surface chemistry of PtSn alloys and elucidate additional molecular-level information on the interaction of gases with these surfaces."
[5] "We find that after desorption of all surface-bound NO and oxygen associated with Pt sites, θO=0.2 ML remains at the surface associated with oxidized Sn species."
