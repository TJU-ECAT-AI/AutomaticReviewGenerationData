[1] "Platinumtin bimetallic catalysts are of interest for selective oxidation and reduction reactions, and are commercially important for petroleum reforming [19]."
[2] "In this condition, only oxygen remains at the surface and Sn is oxidized as shown in Fig. 6."
[3] "Our results following NO2 exposures on the alloy at 600 K is also consistent with previous structural models developed for more heavily oxidized alloys [43]."
[4] "Previous results using XPS conclude that Pt is not oxidized by reactions of NO2 on the 3 alloy under UHV conditions such as those investigated in this report [46]."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by improving efficiency and reducing environmental impact. Its key advantages include:

1. Higher product yield: Selective oxygenate reforming allows for the efficient conversion of feedstocks into valuable products like alcohols, ethers, and hydrocarbons with high yields, enhancing the overall efficiency of chemical processes.

2. Reduced environmental impact: By optimizing the conversion of feedstocks, this method minimizes the generation of waste and emissions, making it more environmentally friendly compared to traditional methods that may produce more pollutants.

3. Practical implementation: The technique enables the production of high-quality products from inexpensive feedstocks, making the processes economically viable and scalable. It also supports the development of cleaner energy sources by enabling the conversion of bio-based feedstocks into renewable fuels.

The advantages of selective oxygenate reforming over traditional methods are thus evident in terms of enhanced product yields, reduced environmental footprint, and improved economic viability.
