[27] "Of intense, additional interest, Pt-promoted SnO2 thin films are used widely in sensor technologies, for example, in detection of ethanol [30] and CO [31] ."
[28] "These sensor systems are also complicated materials systems that could benefit greatly by surface science model studies that address the surface chemistry of PtSn alloys and elucidate additional molecular-level information on the interaction of gases with these surfaces."
[29] "In this study, we investigate the chemistry of NO2 on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy."
[30] "Under these latter conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states, the lowest of which is associated with O2 desorption from Pt sites and the other two are from decomposition of reduced tin oxide phase(s), SnOx."
[31] "This can be compared to the decomposition of about 80% of the monolayer on Pt(1 1 1) [5]."
[32] "However, unlike the case on Pt(1 1 1), no NO2 desorbs from the chemisorbed monolayer. The NO2 monolayer reacts completely and irreversibly on a 3 alloy surface."
[33] "The maximum oxygen coverage obtained by heating the N2O4 monolayer was about θO=0.4 ML, but this can be increased to θO=1.1 ML by NO2 dosing on the alloy surface at 600 K to remove inhibition by coadsorbed NO."
[34] "After annealing to 175 or 220 K, which desorbs any physisorbed multilayer species as shown in Fig. 1 , surprisingly little change occurred in the HREELS spectra other than decreases in peak intensities consistent with some NO2 desorption."
[35] "Furthermore, observation of an intense νNN mode indicates that the NN bond in N2O4 is oriented nearly along the surface normal, and certainly not near parallel with the surface plane, and observation of νs,NO2 and νas,NO2 modes in N2O4 with nearly the same intensity rules out both a flat-lying N2O4 with the molecular plane oriented parallel to the surface plane and an upright, chelating N2O4 species with C2v symmetry oriented along the surface normal."
[36] "Small peak shifts do occur upon desorption of the multilayer for the energy loss peaks at 782, 1275, and 1591 cm1."
[37] "Shifts in Sn AES peaks were used to follow Sn oxidation."
[38] "After a 0.1 L (2 ML) dose of NO2 on the sample at 120 K, this caused no change in the alloy LEED pattern other than to decrease the spot intensity, and no significant changes were observed after annealing to 200 K which desorbs some NO2."
[39] "After a subsequent anneal to 700 K, (2 × 2) spots could no longer be seen and only a blurry (1 × 1) pattern remained."
[40] "This is consistent with our assignment of the 804 K O2 TPD peak in Fig. 5 to desorption of O(a) associated with Pt sites and the assignment of O2 desorption above 850 K to decomposition of oxidized Sn species."
[41] "On the 3 alloy, the lower KE Sn(MNN) peak is located at 426.6 eV, identical to the value for Sn metal [41]."
[42] "This made it necessary to regenerate the 3 alloy after each NO2 experiment by additional Sn dosing and annealing."
[43] "This is also a higher coverage than reported by Saliba et al."
[44] "The origin of the two O2 desorption states seen in the TPD curves shown in Fig. 3 can be probed by chemical shifts in AES that are induced by reaction with adsorbates and indicate the oxidation state of the substrate components."
[45] "The kinetic energies (KE) of emitted Auger electrons are affected by core level binding energy shifts and so they are useful for qualitatively assessing whether or not oxidation has occurred."
[46] "The 3 alloy was probed by LEED following a 0.1 L (2 ML) dose of NO2 on the sample at 120 K."
[47] "This can be compared to the decomposition of about 80% of the monolayer on Pt(1 1 1) [5]."
