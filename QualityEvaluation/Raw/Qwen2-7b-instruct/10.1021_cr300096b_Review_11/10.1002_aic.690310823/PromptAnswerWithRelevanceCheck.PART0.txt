<quotes>
[1] "The Doraiswamy and Sharma volumes are well produced and fairly priced. They are a commendable advanced treatise, recommended to practicing engineers and as a supplementary reference for graduate courses in reaction engineering."
[2] "Bimetallic catalysts find wide application, especially in the petroleum industry. They offer the potential of improved selectivity and better activity maintenance as compared to catalysts containing only one metal."
[3] "Although most of the work discussed in the book has already appeared in the open scientific literature, the book brings twenty years of research at Exxons catalysis laboratories into context and makes it easier for the reader to appreciate the development of concepts and ideas concerning bimetallic catalysts."
[4] "This book makes interesting reading not only for the scientist or engineer directly involved in bimetallic catalysis, but serves as an example of the scientific research endeavor in general, demonstrating how new concepts and insights are developed on the basis of carefully posed questions followed by key experiments, ultimately culminating in important industrial applications."
