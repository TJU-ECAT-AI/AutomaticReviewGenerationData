[1] "Our previous studies have shown ZrO2-supported bimetallic RhPt catalysts to be active and selective for H2 formation by ATR of sulfur-free hydrocarbon mixtures in the temperature range of 400900 C."
[2] "In ATR of commercial diesel, the carbon deposition increased with the Pt-loading of the catalyst, whereas the sulfur deposition was strongest on the Rh catalyst."
[3] "The catalyst performance was affected drastically by H2S (10 ppm S). The conversions of simulated fuels and water decreased causing a poor product distribution, while the conversion of oxygen was not affected."
[4] "According to these results, ATR of liquid fuels in the presence of sulfur should be performed above 700 C to avoid RhPt catalyst deactivation."

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling efficient conversion of liquid fuels into hydrogen-rich gas. Its key advantages include high product yield, reduced environmental impact due to minimized emissions, and practical implementation through the use of advanced catalysts that selectively reform specific components of the fuel. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers improved selectivity and efficiency in hydrogen production.

2. In terms of carbon deposition, the process revealed that the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst increases with the Pt-loading of the catalyst. Conversely, sulfur deposition was found to be highest on the Rh catalyst. These findings highlight the importance of catalyst design and composition in managing the trade-offs between carbon and sulfur deposition during the reforming process.

3. The presence of H2S in the reforming process significantly impacts catalyst performance. It leads to a decrease in conversions of simulated fuels and water, resulting in poor product distribution. Notably, the conversion of oxygen remains unaffected, indicating that H2S does not hinder the oxidation reactions but rather degrades the activity for reforming. The reversibility of H2S adsorption allows for recovery of catalyst activity upon cessation of the H2S flow.

4. The study recommends performing autothermal reforming of liquid fuels in the presence of sulfur above 700°C to prevent RhPt catalyst deactivation. This recommendation underscores the need for careful control of operating conditions to maintain optimal catalyst performance and efficiency in the presence of sulfur compounds.

1. 选择性氧化重整过程通过使液体燃料转化为富含氢气的气体，为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。其关键优势包括高产品产率、由于减少了排放而降低了环境影响，以及通过使用能够选择性重整燃料中特定组分的先进催化剂实现的实施可行性。与传统方法相比，选择性氧化重整提供了在硫化合物存在下提高选择性和效率的机会。

2. 在碳沉积方面，研究表明随着催化剂中铂负载量的增加，碳沉积量也增加。相反，硫沉积量最高发生在铑催化剂上。这些发现强调了催化剂设计和组成对于管理重整过程中碳和硫沉积的重要性。

3. 硫化氢的存在对催化剂性能产生了显著影响。它导致模拟燃料和水的转化率降低，导致产品分布不佳。值得注意的是，氧气的转化率不受影响，表明硫化氢不会阻碍氧化反应，而是破坏重整活性。H2S吸附的可逆性允许在终止H2S流后恢复催化剂活性。

4. 研究建议在高于700°C的条件下进行液体燃料在硫存在的条件下的自热重整，以防止铑铂催化剂失活。这一建议强调了需要仔细控制操作条件以保持在硫化合物存在下催化剂性能和效率的最佳状态。
