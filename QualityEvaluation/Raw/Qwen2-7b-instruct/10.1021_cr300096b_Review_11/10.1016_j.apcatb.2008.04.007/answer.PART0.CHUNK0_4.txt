[1] "The production of hydrogen-rich fuel gas from liquid hydrocarbons by autothermal reforming (ATR) is of great interest for high temperature fuel cell applications."
[2] "The presence of side reactions can be controlled through choice of the catalyst and optimization of the reaction conditions."
[3] "In ATR of commercial low-sulfur diesel, the carbon deposition increased with the Pt-loading of the catalyst, whereas the sulfur deposition was strongest on the Rh catalyst."
[4] "Moreover, owing to the different behavior of sulfur compounds (H2S and 4,6-DMDBT) and the fact that H2S is not formed in ATR of low-sulfur diesel nor from 4,6-DMDBT at any temperature, H2S cannot be considered a suitable model compound for heterocyclic sulfur compounds in commercial, low-sulfur fuels."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently producing hydrogen-rich fuel gas from liquid hydrocarbons, which is particularly suitable for high temperature fuel cell applications. Its key advantages include high product yield, reduced environmental impact due to minimized emissions, and practical implementation through optimized catalyst selection and reaction conditions.

2. In the context of autothermal reforming (ATR), controlling side reactions is feasible by choosing appropriate catalysts and optimizing reaction conditions, ensuring efficient hydrogen production while minimizing unwanted byproducts.

3. In the case of ATR of commercial low-sulfur diesel, the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst increases with the Pt-loading, while sulfur deposition is most pronounced on the Rh catalyst. This highlights the specific interactions between catalyst components and sulfur compounds.

4. Considering the behavior of sulfur compounds in ATR, H2S is not a suitable model for simulating heterocyclic sulfur compounds found in commercial, low-sulfur fuels. The distinct effects of H2S and 4,6-DMDBT necessitate alternative approaches for modeling and understanding sulfur impacts in such fuels.

1. 自热重整（ATR）用于从液体烃中生产富含氢气的燃料气体，对于高温燃料电池应用具有极大价值。其主要优势包括高产品产量、降低环境影响（通过减少排放）、以及通过选择合适的催化剂和优化反应条件实现实际操作。

2. 在自热重整的背景下，通过选择合适的催化剂和优化反应条件，可以控制副反应，确保高效氢气生产的同时减少不希望出现的副产品。

3. 对于商业低硫柴油的自热重整，在催化剂上沉积的碳量随Pt负载增加，而硫沉积最强发生在铑催化剂上。这表明催化剂成分与硫化合物之间的特定相互作用。

4. 考虑到硫化合物在自热重整中的行为，H2S不是模拟商业低硫燃料中发现的杂环硫化物的有效模型。H2S和4,6-DMDBT的明显差异需要采取不同的方法来模拟和理解这种燃料中的硫影响。
