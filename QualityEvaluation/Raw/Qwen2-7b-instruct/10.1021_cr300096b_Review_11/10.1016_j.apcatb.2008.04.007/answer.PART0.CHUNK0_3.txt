1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently producing hydrogen-rich fuel gas from liquid hydrocarbons. Its key advantages include high product yield, reduced environmental impact through lower emissions compared to traditional methods, and practical implementation through the use of specific catalysts like ZrO2-supported RhPt. The process allows for the conversion of sulfur-containing fuels into cleaner, more usable forms, enhancing their potential as energy sources for fuel cells.

2. The presence of sulfur in fossil fuels can generate sulfur oxides during combustion, leading to air pollution and acid rain. Traditional catalytic hydrodesulfurization methods can remove most sulfur compounds, but heterocyclic sulfur compounds are more challenging and costly to eliminate. Commercial fuels, despite their low sulfur content, can still act as a poison for fuel cell systems due to their sulfur content. Autothermal reforming (ATR) offers an alternative method for producing hydrogen-rich fuel gas suitable for high-temperature fuel cell applications.

3. Our previous studies have demonstrated that ZrO2-supported bimetallic RhPt catalysts are effective for hydrogen production via ATR of sulfur-free hydrocarbon mixtures. These catalysts show high activity and selectivity within a temperature range of 400-900°C. The sulfur tolerance of noble metal catalysts, particularly Rh and Pt, plays a crucial role in their performance during ATR of sulfur-containing fuels.

4. Research on the impact of sulfur in the reforming of liquid hydrocarbons has been limited, with H2S commonly used as a model compound. However, this model may not fully represent heterocyclic sulfur compounds found in commercial low-sulfur fuels. In ATR of simulated and commercial low-sulfur diesel, the presence of sulfur affects the performance of catalysts, leading to deactivation over time. The suitability of sulfur-containing commercial fuels for fuel cell applications and as hydrogen sources is being considered, with a focus on the role of catalyst support in sulfur tolerance.

5. ZrO2 is a promising support material for catalysts due to its ability to vary sulfur tolerance based on acidic properties. Heterocyclic sulfur compounds like 4,6-DMDBT and H2S are used as model compounds in ATR of simulated fuels to evaluate catalyst performance. Side reactions in ATR can be managed through the selection of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions.

6. Controlling the effect of temperature on catalyst stability in ATR of low-sulfur diesel provides insights into the deactivation mechanisms at lower temperatures. While catalyst activity recovers partially upon returning to the initial temperature, irreversible deactivation occurs at lower temperatures. Temperatures above 700°C are ideal for maintaining high reforming activity and selectivity in Rh-containing catalysts.

7. The study highlights the importance of understanding the behavior of sulfur compounds in ATR of commercial fuels, emphasizing the distinction between H2S and heterocyclic sulfur compounds like 4,6-DMDBT. The presence of H2S in commercial fuels is not representative of heterocyclic sulfur compounds, and thus, H2S cannot be considered an adequate model for heterocyclic sulfur compounds in commercial, low-sulfur fuels.

8. The research aims to improve the efficiency and sustainability of energy production and chemical processes by optimizing ATR conditions, selecting appropriate catalysts, and understanding the role of sulfur in fuel reforming. The findings contribute to the development of cleaner, more efficient hydrogen production technologies suitable for high-temperature fuel cell applications.

1. 自动热重整过程通过从液态烃中高效生产富含氢气的燃料气体，为可持续能源和化工生产做出了贡献。其关键优势包括高产品产出、与传统方法相比降低的环境影响（通过减少排放），以及通过特定催化剂如氧化锆支持的铑钯双金属催化剂的可行实施来实现的实用性。该过程允许将含硫燃料转化为更可利用的形式，从而增强它们作为燃料电池系统的能源来源潜力。

2. 石油燃料中的硫在燃烧过程中会生成硫氧化物，导致空气污染和酸雨。传统的催化氢化脱硫方法可以去除大部分硫化合物，但异环硫化合物的去除则更为困难且成本更高。尽管商业燃料的硫含量较低，但由于其硫含量，仍可能成为燃料电池系统的毒药。自动热重整（ATR）提供了生产适用于高温燃料电池应用的氢富集燃料气体的替代方法。

3. 我们先前的研究表明，氧化锆支持的铑钯双金属催化剂在400-900°C的温度范围内对无硫烃混合物的氢生产非常有效。这些催化剂显示出高活性和选择性。贵金属催化剂，特别是铑和钯的耐硫能力，在硫含有燃料的重整中起着关键作用。

4. 对液体烃中硫的影响的研究相对有限，通常使用H2S作为模型化合物。然而，这可能无法充分代表商业低硫燃料中发现的异环硫化合物。在模拟和商业低硫柴油的自动热重整中，硫的存在会影响催化剂性能，并导致随时间的催化剂失活。考虑硫含量商业燃料作为燃料电池应用的主要燃料和氢源的适宜性，重点放在催化剂支持的硫容忍度上。

5. 氧化锆因其根据酸性性质改变硫容忍度的能力而成为有前景的支持材料。异环硫化合物如4,6-二甲基二苯并噻吩（4,6-DMDBT）和H2S被用作模拟燃料中的模型化合物，以评估催化剂性能。ATR中的副反应可以通过选择催化剂和优化反应条件来管理。

6. 在低硫柴油的自动热重整中研究温度对催化剂稳定性的影响，为了解低温下催化剂失活机制提供了见解。虽然在返回到初始温度时催化剂活性部分恢复，但在较低温度下发生不可逆失活。700°C以上的温度是保持铑类催化剂高重整活性和选择性的理想温度。

7. 研究强调了理解商业燃料中硫化合物行为的重要性，强调了H2S与异环硫化合物之间的区别。商业燃料中的H2S不能作为异环硫化合物在商业低硫燃料中的适当模型。

8. 研究旨在通过优化ATR条件、选择合适的催化剂和理解硫在燃料重整中的作用来提高能源生产和化工过程的效率和可持续性。研究成果有助于开发更清洁、更高效的氢生产技术，适用于高温燃料电池应用。
