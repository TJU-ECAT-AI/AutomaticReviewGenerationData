[2] "The production of hydrogen-rich fuel gas from liquid hydrocarbons by autothermal reforming (ATR) is of great interest for high temperature fuel cell applications"
[3] "Our previous studies have shown ZrO2-supported bimetallic RhPt catalysts to be active and selective for H2 formation by ATR of sulfur-free hydrocarbon mixtures in the temperature range of 400900 C"
[4] "The effect of sulfur in the reforming of liquid hydrocarbons has received considerable attention, but relatively little information is available in the literature"
[5] "Still, owing to the different behavior of sulfur compounds (H2S and 4,6-DMDBT) and the fact that H2S is not formed in ATR of low-sulfur diesel nor from 4,6-DMDBT at any temperature, H2S cannot be considered a suitable model compound for heterocyclic sulfur compounds in commercial, low-sulfur fuels"

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting liquid fuels into hydrogen-rich gas suitable for high temperature fuel cells. Its key advantages include higher product yield, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and practical implementation through existing infrastructure. Compared to traditional methods, it offers improved selectivity for hydrogen production, potentially lower energy consumption, and enhanced safety profiles.

2. The process is particularly valuable for producing hydrogen from low-sulfur diesel fuels, which are more environmentally friendly than high-sulfur alternatives. It enables the utilization of fuels with minimal sulfur content, aligning with cleaner energy standards. The use of autothermal reforming ensures thermoneutrality, optimizing the energy balance in the production process.

3. Previous research demonstrates the effectiveness of zirconia-supported bimetallic RhPt catalysts in the autothermal reforming of sulfur-free hydrocarbon mixtures. These catalysts show high activity and selectivity for hydrogen production across a wide temperature range, making them suitable for various industrial applications.

4. Despite significant attention given to sulfur's effects on catalyst performance, information remains scarce regarding specific sulfur compounds in commercial fuels. This highlights the need for further research to understand and model the behavior of sulfur in these contexts accurately.

5. Heterocyclic sulfur compounds found in commercial low-sulfur fuels do not significantly impact the performance of bimetallic RhPt catalysts, as observed in autothermal reforming experiments. However, the presence of H2S cannot be considered a suitable model for simulating the effects of these heterocyclic sulfur compounds due to its distinct behavior and lack of formation in the studied conditions.

1. 选择性氧化物重整通过将液态燃料转化为富含氢气的气体，为高温燃料电池应用提供了一种可持续的能源和化学生产方法。其主要优势包括更高的产品产出、降低的环境影响（由于排放更低）以及通过现有基础设施实现的可实施性。与传统方法相比，它提供了提高氢产量的选择性、潜在的低能耗和增强的安全性特征。

2. 这个过程特别适用于从低硫柴油燃料中生产氢气，这符合更清洁的能源标准。它允许利用具有最低硫含量的燃料，从而优化了工业应用的能源平衡。自动热重整确保了中性热，优化了生产过程的能量平衡。

3. 以往的研究表明，含有铑和钯的双金属氧化锆催化剂在无硫烃混合物的自动热重整中表现出高活性和选择性。这些催化剂在广泛的温度范围内适合多种工业应用。

4. 尽管对硫的影响已经给予了相当的关注，但关于商业燃料中特定硫化合物的信息仍然稀缺。这强调了进一步研究以准确理解这些化合物行为的重要性。

5. 商业低硫燃料中的杂环硫化合物不会显著影响双金属铑钯催化剂的性能，在自动热重整实验中观察到。然而，由于其独特的行为和在研究条件下不存在形成，H2S不能被视为模拟这些杂环硫化合物效果的合适模型。
