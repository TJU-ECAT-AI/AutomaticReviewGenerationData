[1] "During combustion, the sulfur present in fossil fuels generates sulfur oxides, which cause air pollution and acid rain."
[2] "Although most of the sulfur compounds can be removed by the present catalytic hydrodesulfurization (HDS) technology, certain heterocyclic sulfur compounds are difficult and expensive to remove."
[3] "The advantage of diesel fuel is its high volumetric hydrogen density."
[4] "The presence of side reactions can be controlled through choice of the catalyst and optimization of the reaction conditions."
[5] "In ATR of commercial diesel, the carbon deposition increased with the Pt-loading of the catalyst."
[6] "Moreover, owing to the different behavior of sulfur compounds (H2S and 4,6-DMDBT) and the fact that H2S is not formed in ATR of low-sulfur diesel nor from 4,6-DMDBT at any temperature, H2S cannot be considered a suitable model compound for heterocyclic sulfur compounds in commercial, low-sulfur fuels."

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting liquid hydrocarbons into hydrogen-rich fuel gas, reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and improved operational efficiency compared to traditional methods. By controlling side reactions through optimized catalyst selection and conditions, it ensures a cleaner and more sustainable production process.

2. The sulfur present in fossil fuels during combustion generates sulfur oxides, leading to air pollution and acid rain. While most sulfur compounds can be removed through catalytic hydrodesulfurization, heterocyclic sulfur compounds pose significant challenges due to their resistance to removal processes.

3. Diesel fuel offers a high volumetric hydrogen density, making it attractive for use in fuel cell systems. This property is beneficial for energy storage and conversion applications, enhancing the sustainability of energy supply.

4. The autothermal reforming (ATR) process allows for control of side reactions through the selection of appropriate catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions. This ensures efficient conversion of hydrocarbons into desired products, such as hydrogen, while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

5. In the context of autothermal reforming of diesel, the carbon deposition on the catalyst increases with the loading of platinum (Pt). This highlights the importance of catalyst design in managing carbon buildup and maintaining optimal performance.

6. Considering the behavior of sulfur compounds (H2S and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene, 4,6-DMDBT) in autothermal reforming of diesel, H2S cannot be regarded as a suitable model compound for simulating heterocyclic sulfur compounds found in commercial low-sulfur fuels. This distinction underscores the need for accurate modeling and understanding of sulfur interactions in fuel reforming processes.

1. 选择性氧化物重整过程通过高效地将液态烃转化为富含氢气的燃料气体，促进了可持续能源和化学生产的发展。其关键优势包括更高的产品产出、较低的环境影响（由于排放量减少）以及与传统方法相比的更高效的运行效率。通过优化催化剂选择和条件控制副反应，确保了更清洁、更可持续的生产过程。

2. 燃烧化石燃料时，其中的硫会生成硫氧化物，导致空气污染和酸雨。虽然大多数硫化合物可以通过现有的催化加氢脱硫技术去除，但某些杂环硫化合物的去除既困难又昂贵。

3. 柴油因其高体积氢密度而具有吸引力，使其成为用于燃料电池系统应用的理想选择。这一特性有利于能源存储和转换应用，从而增强能源供应的可持续性。

4. 自动热重整（ATR）过程允许通过选择合适的催化剂和优化反应条件来控制副反应。这确保了高效地将烃类转化为所需产品，如氢气，同时最大限度地减少不希望的副反应。

5. 在柴油自动热重整过程中，催化剂上的碳沉积随铂（Pt）负载的增加而增加。这强调了催化剂设计在管理碳积聚和保持最佳性能方面的重要性。

6. 考虑到硫化合物（硫化氢H2S和4,6-二甲基二苯并噻吩4,6-DMDBT）在柴油自动热重整中的行为，H2S不能被视为模拟商业低硫燃料中发现的杂环硫化合物的合适模型化合物。这一区别突出了对燃料重整过程中硫相互作用准确建模和理解的需求。
