[1] "The production of low H2/CO ratio syngases through the dry reforming of methane, i.e. the reaction of methane with carbon dioxide, is also a potentially useful process. Coking in this case is a more serious problem, and for this reason, noble metal catalysts, which suffer coking less than Ni-based ones, have longer life."
[2] "It is evident that the deactivation rate decreases strongly by the addition of Pt to Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. Indeed, the Pt-containing catalysts supported on the fibrous alumina are rather stable for the DRM."
[3] "The addition of small amounts of Pt significantly decreases the deactivation rate of the catalyst (as discussed in detail elsewhere [28] ) by reducing the formation of carbon nanotubes. Thus, small amounts of Pt can be useful to increase catalyst life, thus acting as stabilizer for Ni/Al2O3 catalysts."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by offering an alternative method to produce hydrogen and syngas with lower carbon footprint and environmental impact compared to traditional steam reforming methods. Its key advantages include:
   - Higher product yields of hydrogen and syngas, which are essential for fuel production and chemical synthesis.
   - Reduced carbon emissions, since it utilizes methane and carbon dioxide as feedstocks, which are greenhouse gases, thus contributing to climate change mitigation efforts.
   - Enhanced catalyst stability and reduced deactivation rates, allowing for longer operational periods and lower costs.

2. The process of dry reforming of methane involves reacting methane with carbon dioxide to produce syngas, which contains a lower H2/CO ratio. This process presents challenges in terms of coke formation, which is more severe than in traditional steam reforming processes. Noble metal catalysts, particularly those containing platinum, are advantageous because they undergo less coking and therefore exhibit longer lifespans, providing more reliable and efficient catalytic performance.

3. The inclusion of small quantities of platinum in catalyst formulations significantly reduces the deactivation rate of the catalyst, primarily by minimizing the formation of carbon nanotubes. This stabilization effect extends the operational lifespan of the catalyst, making it a valuable component in enhancing the longevity and efficiency of nickel-alumina catalysts, which are commonly used in various industrial applications.

1. 选择性氧化物重整为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献，提供了与传统蒸汽重整方法相比具有较低碳足迹和环境影响的替代方法。其关键优势包括：
   - 高氢气和合成气产品收率，对于燃料生产和化学合成至关重要。
   - 减少了碳排放，因为它利用甲烷和二氧化碳作为原料，这些是温室气体，有助于减缓气候变化的努力。
   - 催化剂稳定性增强和降解速率降低，允许更长的操作周期和更低的成本。

2. 干性甲烷重整过程涉及将甲烷与二氧化碳反应以产生合成气，该过程面临焦炭形成的问题，比传统蒸汽重整过程更为严重。特别是铂族金属催化剂，尤其是铂含量的催化剂，在这方面表现出较少的焦炭形成，因此寿命更长，提供更可靠和高效的催化性能。

3. 在催化剂配方中加入少量铂显著减少了催化剂的降解速率，主要通过减少碳纳米管的形成来实现。这种稳定效果延长了催化剂的使用寿命，使其成为提高镍-氧化铝催化剂长期有效性和效率的宝贵成分，这些催化剂在各种工业应用中被广泛使用。
