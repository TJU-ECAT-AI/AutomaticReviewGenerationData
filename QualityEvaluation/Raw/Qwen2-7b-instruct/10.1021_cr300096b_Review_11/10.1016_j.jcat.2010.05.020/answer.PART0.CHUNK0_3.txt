Characterization of alumina-supported Pt, Ni and PtNi alloy catalysts for the dry reforming of methane

The introduction highlights the importance of catalysts in hydrogen production, particularly focusing on Ni-based catalysts. It states, "The industrial catalysts are invariably based on Ni supported on an alumina-based carrier, usually stabilized by the presence of alkali and/or alkali earth cations." 

It continues, "However, at least in the case of ethanol steam reforming, cobaltnickel bimetallic catalysts appear to be more efficient than Ni catalysts."

It also discusses the potential for Pt-based catalysts, noting, "Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are also quite largely used as dehydrogenation catalysts such as in the Oleflex light paraffin dehydrogenation technology and in the Pacol long linear paraffin dehydrogenation technology, both from UOP."

The text mentions the challenges faced by Ni-based catalysts, such as coking and deactivation issues. It states, "Coking in this case is a more serious problem, and for this reason, noble metal catalysts, which suffer coking less than Ni-based ones, have longer life."

It further explains the synergistic effect of Pt and Ni, stating, "The addition of small amounts of Pt significantly decreases the deactivation rate of the catalyst (as discussed in detail elsewhere [28]) by reducing the formation of carbon nanotubes."

It also discusses the formation of PtNi alloy catalysts and their enhanced activity. It states, "In this work, two bimetallic combinations of PtNi have been prepared, supported over nanostructured γ-Al2O3 together with the corresponding monometallic materials."

The text details the experimental methods used for catalyst preparation, characterization, and testing. It states, "The activity of the catalysts has been described in detail in [28]."

It concludes by discussing the results, including the improved activity and stability of the PtNi alloy catalysts, stating, "This is in agreement with literature data showing that on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, carbon is removed by oxidation by CO2, ensuring a longer accessibility to active Pt sites."

It also mentions the XRD patterns showing the formation of a PtNi alloy with smaller metal crystal size, stating, "In the case of the 0.4Pt4Ni/Al2O3 sample, the [1 1 1] and [2 0 0] peaks of nickel metal are very much broadened but also definitely displaced to lower 2θ values. This corresponds to a further important lowering of the crystal size."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting oxygenates into lighter hydrocarbons and hydrogen. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower carbon emissions, and improved selectivity, which leads to better efficiency and lower costs compared to traditional methods. For instance, it can enhance the conversion rates in gasoline production, reduce the need for fossil fuels, and minimize the formation of pollutants. Practical implementation involves optimizing reaction conditions, catalyst selection, and reactor design to maximize the yield of desired products while minimizing energy consumption and waste production.
