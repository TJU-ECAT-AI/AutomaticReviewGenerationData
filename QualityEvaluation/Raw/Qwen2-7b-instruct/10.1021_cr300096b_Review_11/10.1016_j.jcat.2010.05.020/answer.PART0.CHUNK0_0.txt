1. Hydrogen production predominantly relies on steam reforming of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, conducted at high temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1200 Kelvin. This method involves serious coking issues, making noble metal catalysts preferable due to their lesser propensity to coking compared to nickel-based catalysts.

2. In the context of reforming processes, noble metal catalysts exhibit longer lifespans and are more effective in mitigating coking problems. 

3. Bimetallic catalysts, including those with a combination of Pt and Ni, demonstrate optimal performance in certain applications, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness.

4. The hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide (H2/CO) ratio achieved across various catalysts is consistently within the range of 0.64 to 0.68, indicating comparable performance.

5. Adding Pt to Ni/Al2O3 catalysts notably reduces catalyst deactivation rates, primarily by diminishing the creation of carbon-based materials. 

6. The surface of PtNi alloys displays a higher CO-stretching frequency by 10 cm1 compared to pure Pt, reflecting enhanced reactivity.

7. Despite having a higher nickel concentration, the surface of bimetallic NiPt/Al2O3 catalysts predominantly consists of Pt-rich surfaces alongside dispersed, easily oxidized Ni centers, according to recent findings by Mukainakano et al.

1. 氢气主要通过蒸汽重整烃类，尤其是天然气，在1000至1200开尔文的高温下生产。这种方法涉及到严重的结焦问题，因此，由于它们比镍基催化剂更少结焦，贵金属催化剂在性能上更优越。

2. 在重整过程中，贵金属催化剂表现出更长的使用寿命，并能有效缓解结焦问题。

3. 含有铂和镍组合的双金属催化剂在特定应用中表现优异，提高了效率和有效性。

4. 各种催化剂实现的氢气与一氧化碳（H2/CO）比例范围为0.64至0.68，显示了相似的性能。

5. 将铂添加到镍/氧化铝催化剂中显著降低了催化剂的失活速率，主要是通过减少碳基材料的生成。

6. PtNi合金表面的CO拉伸频率比纯铂高10 cm1，反映了增强的活性。

7. 尽管镍的浓度较高，但NiPt/Al2O3双金属催化剂的表面主要由富含铂的表面以及分散、易于氧化的镍中心组成，根据Mukainakano等人最近的研究结果。
