[1] "The activity results showed that the catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi samples strongly depended on the metal loadings and Ni/Pt loading ratio."
[2] "Among all the catalysts, 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, which has the lowest Ni/Pt ratio, exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability."
[3] "Low Ni/Pt molar loading ratio of 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 sample led to a relatively easy reduction of nickel oxide species and smaller nano-sized nickel particles having better dispersion caused by the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites in the closed vicinity."
[4] "0.3Pt10Ni was capable of operating under a variety of feed conditions without significant deactivation suggesting that the catalyst is very promising for synthesis gas production for gas-to-liquid technology."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing the efficiency of converting methane into synthesis gas, particularly through the use of optimized PtNi bimetallic catalysts. Key advantages include:

1. High activity and stability, as demonstrated by the 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, which shows superior performance with respect to the Ni/Pt loading ratio.
2. Enhanced reduction of nickel oxide species and formation of smaller, well-dispersed nickel particles due to the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites, leading to better catalytic performance.
3. The capability of operating under various feed conditions without significant deactivation, making the catalyst highly promising for gas-to-liquid technology, thus supporting sustainable energy production.

选择性氧化物重整过程通过提高甲烷转化为合成气的效率，对可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。关键优势包括：

1. 高活性和稳定性，以0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3催化剂为例，其性能与Ni/Pt负载比密切相关。
2. 由于铂和镍位点之间的紧密相互作用，镍氧化物种的容易还原和形成更小、分布更好的镍颗粒，从而提高了催化性能。
3. 在各种进料条件下都能稳定运行，无需显著失活，这使得该催化剂对于气态到液态技术的合成气生产非常有前景，从而支持可持续能源生产。
