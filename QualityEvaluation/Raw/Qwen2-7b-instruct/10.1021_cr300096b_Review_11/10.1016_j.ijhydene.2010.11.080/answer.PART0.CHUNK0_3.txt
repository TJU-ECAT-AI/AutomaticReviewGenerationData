[1] "A series of PtNi bimetallic catalysts supported on δ-Al2O3 to be used in carbon dioxide reforming of methane was prepared and tested with the objective of optimizing the Ni/Pt metal composition to obtain high activity and stability."
[2] "The activity results showed that the catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi samples strongly depended on the metal loadings and Ni/Pt loading ratio."
[3] "Among all the catalysts, 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, which has the lowest Ni/Pt ratio, exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability."
[4] "Low Ni/Pt molar loading ratio of 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 sample led to a relatively easy reduction of nickel oxide species and smaller nano-sized nickel particles having better dispersion caused by the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites in the closed vicinity."
[5] "0.3Pt10Ni was capable of operating under a variety of feed conditions without significant deactivation suggesting that the catalyst is very promising for synthesis gas production for gas-to-liquid technology."
[6] "The results of the combined dry reforming and partial oxidation tests strongly indicated a change in surface reaction mechanism depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing the efficiency of converting methane into synthesis gas, particularly through optimized PtNi bimetallic catalysts. Key advantages include:

1. **Product Yield**: The use of 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, with their optimized Ni/Pt ratio, leads to higher activity and stability, thus increasing the yield of synthesis gas during the reforming process. This results in more efficient conversion rates, which is crucial for sustainable energy production as it maximizes resource utilization.

2. **Environmental Impact**: By focusing on selective oxygenate reforming, the process minimizes the formation of unwanted byproducts such as coke deposition, which can clog equipment and reduce operational efficiency. This leads to cleaner energy production processes, reducing emissions and waste, thus contributing positively to environmental sustainability.

3. **Practical Implementation**: The versatility of the 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, capable of operating under various feed conditions without significant deactivation, makes it highly adaptable to different industrial settings. This enhances its practicality in real-world applications, particularly in gas-to-liquid technologies where flexibility and reliability are paramount. The catalyst's ability to maintain its performance across different conditions ensures a consistent and efficient production output, which is essential for both economic and environmental sustainability.

The detailed characterization and testing of these catalysts, along with the observed changes in surface reaction mechanisms, underscore the importance of optimizing metal compositions and ratios for achieving optimal performance in selective oxygenate reforming processes. These findings suggest that the developed catalysts offer a promising avenue for advancing sustainable energy production and chemical synthesis, particularly in the context of converting methane into valuable synthesis gas.
