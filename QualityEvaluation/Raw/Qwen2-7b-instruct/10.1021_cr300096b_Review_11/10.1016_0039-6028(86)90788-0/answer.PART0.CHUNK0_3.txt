Methanol decomposition on O/Pt(111) was studied over a coverage range of 0.015 ML to multilayers.
Product distribution for an initial methanol (CH3OD) coverage of 0.044 ML showed CO2, H2O, HDO, D2O, and O2 as desorbing products.
Increased CO formation was accompanied by decreased CO2 until at first layer saturation, no CO2 desorbed.
The presence of H2O has mechanistic implications because it signifies that not all O is initially titrated by D(a), even though excess molecular methanol is available.
TPD profile for CH1OD and C=sO for a monolayer of CH3OD on 0.25 ML sO/Pt(111) showed negligible exchange occurs with molecular CH3OD.
Methods of calculating the coverages of various reactant and product molecules were described.
