[1] "The initial sticking coefficient and the saturation first layer coverage of CH3OD are unity and 0.36 ML, respectively."
[2] "The maximum amounts decomposed in TPD on O/Pt(lll) and clean Pt(lll) are 0.19 and 0.047 ML, respectively."
[3] "The decomposed amount did not saturate at or before the onset of molecular methanol desorption, but increased monotonically until saturation of the first layer."
[4] "The CH- ion was the most intense ion in the positive SIMS spectrum of both methanol and methoxy."
[5] "Advantages and limitations of using SIMS as a tool for kinetic studies are discussed."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by allowing for the efficient conversion of oxygenates, such as methanol, into valuable products like hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Its key advantages include:

1. **Product Yield**: Selective oxygenate reforming can achieve high yields of desired products, optimizing the use of feedstocks and reducing waste.
2. **Environmental Impact**: By converting oxygenates rather than relying solely on fossil fuels, it reduces greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on non-renewable resources.
3. **Practical Implementation**: The technology is adaptable and can integrate with existing industrial processes, offering a pathway for gradual transition towards more sustainable production methods.

These advantages are realized through careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst design, ensuring that the reforming process is both efficient and selective.
