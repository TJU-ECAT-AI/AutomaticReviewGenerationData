A STATIC SIMS/TPD STUDY OF THE KINETICS OF METHOXY FORMATION AND DECOMPOSITION ON O/Pt(111)

The kinetics and mechanism of the decomposition of methanol (CH3OD) on oxygen-covered Pt(111) were studied using static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD).

The initial sticking coefficient and the saturation first layer coverage of CH3OD are unity and 0.36 ML, respectively.

The maximum amounts decomposed in TPD on O/Pt(111) and clean Pt(111) are 0.19 and 0.047 ML, respectively.

At low methanol coverages (< 0.05 ML) on O/Pt(111) the only reaction products were CO2, H20 and D20, whereas at saturation CO, H20, D20 and H 2 were observed.

The decomposed amount did not saturate at or before the onset of molecular methanol desorption, but increased monotonically until saturation of the first layer.

No oxygen exchange was observed between CH3OD and preadsorbed 180.

A decomposition mechanism involving methoxy and a hydroxyl type species is proposed.

Methanol coverages as low as 0.002 ML could be detected with SIMS.

The CH- ion was the most intense ion in the positive SIMS spectrum of both methanol and methoxy.

Larger ion clusters such as (CH3OD) + (n = 2, 3) developed successively at specific multilayer coverages.

At low coverages on O/Pt(111), methoxy formation occurs above 125 K and its decomposition becomes detectable above 150 K during temperature programming.

In the isothermal mode, the SIMS CH- ion was used to follow the kinetics.

Over the temperature range 120-145 K, the second order Arrhenius rate parameters for methoxy formation are E = 5.5 ± 0.7 kcal/mol and A = 1.5 × 10-7 cm2/s" molecule for an initial methanol coverage of 0.05 ML.

Methoxy decomposition was studied in the temperature range 150-165 K and at an initial coverage of 0.015 ML.

The first order kinetic parameters, E=11.4+0.5 kcal/mol and A=5.3×10131 s -1 were derived.

Advantages and limitations of using SIMS as a tool for kinetic studies are discussed.

II. Experimental

The experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber pumped by a 450 l/s turbomolecular pump. A base pressure of (2 4) x 10 10 Tort was routinely obtained.

The chamber was equipped with a double pass CMA for AES and a secondary ion quadrupole mass spectrometer for SIMS, TPD and RGA measurements.

The Pt(111) sample could be cooled to 100 K with liquid N2 and heated resistively to 1400 K.

Two chromel-alumel thermocouples were spotwelded at different positions on the back of the crystal and their readings agreed to within 0.01 mV.

Methanol exposures were done at 100-120 K through a glass multichannel doser and were calibrated against dosing by backfilling.

All exposures have been corrected for ion gauge sensitivity factors.

All TPD experiments were done at heating rates of either 1.1 or 5.5 K/s as indicated in the figures.

All temperature programmed SIMS experiments were done at a heating rate of 1.1 K/s.

SIMS and TPD spectra were taken with the sample surface in line-of-sight with the quadrupole.

The ion intensities are reported as recorded and have not been corrected for quadrupole transmission efficiency.

The Ar + ion beam (600 eV, < 3.0 nA) was rastered across the sample.

Under these conditions the loss of adsorbates due to sputtering during SIMS measurements was very slow but was taken into account (see below).

III. Results and discussion

3.1. TPD study

CH3OD decomposition on O/Pt(111) was studied over a coverage range of 0.015 ML to multilayers.

Initially, a (2 × 2)O/Pt(111) surface was prepared by adsorbing about 10 L 02 at 110-120 K followed by a brief flash to 250 K to remove molecular oxygen.

The product distribution for an initial methanol (CH3OD) coverage of 0.044 ML is shown in fig. 1.

At higher coverages, molecular methanol (195 K), CO (460 K) and H2 (350 K) were observed in desorption.

Increased CO formation was accompanied by decreased CO2. This trend continued until at first layer saturation, no CO2 desorbed.

The presence of H20 has mechanistic implications because it signifies that not all O is initially titrated by the D(a), even though excess molecular methanol is available.

The initial titration step can be represented by the equation:
CH3OD + O = CH30 + OD.

This provides a mechanism by which substantial amounts of oxygen may be left untitrated by CH3OD because the subsequent recombination of deuteroxyl groups recycles atomic oxygen:

OD + OD =
D20 + O.

This released oxygen is then available for reaction with H, generated from CH30 dissociation, to produce H20.

The TPSIMS data, discussed later, are also consistent with this reaction.

The two insets in fig. 2 show the TPD profiles for CH1OD and C=sO for a monolayer of CH3OD on 0.25 ML sO/Pt(lll).

It is evident that negligible exchange occurs with molecular CH3OD.

A small amount of ClSO (- 5 10% of CO) appears in the product CO.

In part, this is probably due to exchange at Multilayer peak

Before proceeding further, the methods of calculating the coverages of various reactant and product molecules is described.

The O(a) coverages were easily obtained from the O 2 TPD areas knowing the area corresponding to 0.25 ML of O(a).

The water TPD areas were calibrated by normalizing to the area corresponding to 0.25 ML of water prepared by titrating a layer of 0.25 ML O(a) with 2 × 10 - Torr of H 2 at 135 K [19].

The same calibration was used for D20 (i.e., small differences in mass spectrometer sensitivity and pumping speed are neglected).

The H2, CO and CO2 TPD areas were calibrated against water TPD in the following manner.

At low coverages (below 0.05 ML) all methanol decomposed to CO2 and water (fig. 1):

2 CH3OD + 80 ---, 2 CO
2 + 3 H20 + D20.

The CO2 and water TPD areas from the above reaction will correspond to a stoichiometry of 1:2.

Since the water area can be calibrated as above, this reaction provides a means of calibrating the CO2 areas.
