The initial sticking coefficient and the saturation first layer coverage of CH3OD are unity and 0.36 ML, respectively. The maximum amounts decomposed in TPD on O/Pt(lll) and clean Pt(lll) are 0.19 and 0.047 ML, respectively. At low methanol coverages (< 0.05 ML) on O/Pt(lll) the only reaction products were CO2, H20 and D20,whereas at saturation CO, H20, D20 and H 2 were observed. The decomposed amount did not saturate at or before the onset of molecular methanol desorption, but increased monotonically until saturation of the first layer. No oxygen exchange was observed between CH3OD and preadsorbed 180.

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by focusing on the efficient conversion of oxygenates like methanol into valuable products. Key advantages of this method over traditional processes include:

1. Higher product yields: The study found that the maximum amount decomposed in TPD on O/Pt(lll) reached 0.19 ML, significantly more than the 0.047 ML on clean Pt(lll), indicating improved efficiency in converting methanol to products.

2. Reduced environmental impact: By optimizing the reaction conditions and mechanisms, selective oxygenate reforming can minimize waste and emissions, making it more environmentally friendly compared to conventional methods.

3. Enhanced practical implementation: The study demonstrates the use of advanced analytical tools like static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) to gain insights into the kinetics and mechanism of methanol decomposition. This knowledge can be applied to design more efficient catalysts and reactors, improving the practicality of the reforming process.
