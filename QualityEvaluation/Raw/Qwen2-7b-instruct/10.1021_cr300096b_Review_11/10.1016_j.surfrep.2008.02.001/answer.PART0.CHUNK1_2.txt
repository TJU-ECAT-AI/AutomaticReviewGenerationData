[1] "Surface science studies would also provide a correlation with recent studies using supported catalysts, which showed that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol as compared to Pt/ γ - Al2O3 at similar conditions."
[2] "The reforming activities of both ethanol and ethylene glycol follow a linear relationship with the d-band center, although with different slopes."
[3] "For example, in the case of 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, the formation of the Pt-3d-Pt subsurface MBS structures shifts the d-band center further away from the Fermi level as compared to either parent metal, while the formation of the 3d-Pt surface MBS structure shifts the d-band center closer to the Fermi level."
[4] "The reforming activity of ethanol and ethylene glycol follows a linear relationship with the d-band center, although with different slopes."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by offering a more efficient and environmentally friendly way to produce hydrogen and other valuable products. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming has several key advantages:

1. **Increased Product Yield**: Selective oxygenate reforming, particularly when using bimetallic surfaces like NiPt, CoPt, and FePt, can achieve higher turnover frequencies for the reforming of oxygenates such as ethylene glycol and ethanol. This means that more products, like hydrogen, can be generated per unit of time and input material.

2. **Reduced Environmental Impact**: By optimizing the conditions for reforming reactions, selective oxygenate reforming minimizes the release of pollutants and waste. This is particularly beneficial in the context of hydrogen production, as hydrogen is a clean and renewable energy carrier that can be used in various sectors, including transportation and industry.

3. **Enhanced Selectivity**: The linear relationship between the reforming activity and the d-band center of the bimetallic surfaces indicates that precise control over the surface properties can lead to enhanced selectivity in the production of specific products. This means that hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be selectively produced from oxygenates, reducing the formation of unwanted byproducts.

4. **Practical Implementation**: The ability to tailor the surface properties of bimetallic catalysts to specific reaction conditions opens up possibilities for more practical and scalable manufacturing processes. This can lead to the development of cost-effective, industrially viable methods for hydrogen production from renewable sources, such as biomass or electrolysis of water.

5. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The enhanced efficiency and selectivity of selective oxygenate reforming can lead to lower costs associated with energy consumption and product recovery, making it a more economically viable option compared to traditional methods.

In summary, selective oxygenate reforming offers a promising avenue for sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing product yield, reducing environmental impact, improving selectivity, facilitating practical implementation, and achieving cost-effectiveness.
