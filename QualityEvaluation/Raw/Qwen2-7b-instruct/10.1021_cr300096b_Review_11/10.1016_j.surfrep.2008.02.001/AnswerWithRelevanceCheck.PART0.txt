          [1] "The reforming reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol offer additional examples to illustrate the relationship between the reforming activity of oxygenates and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces."
          [2] "Surface science studies would also provide a correlation with recent studies using supported catalysts, which showed that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol as compared to Pt/ γ - Al2O3 at similar conditions."
          [3] "The reforming activities of both ethanol and ethylene glycol follow a linear relationship with the d-band center, although with different slopes."
          [4] "For example, in the case of 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, the binding energy on the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structure is generally weaker than that on either parent metal, while the binding energy on the surface 3d-Pt(111) structure is stronger than that on either parent metal."

          The process of selective oxygenate reforming significantly contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing the efficiency of hydrogen and other valuable products extraction from oxygenates like methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol. This process boasts several key advantages in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation over traditional methods. Firstly, it leads to higher product yields, as it optimizes the conversion rates of oxygenates into desired products. Secondly, it minimizes environmental impact by reducing waste and emissions, thus promoting cleaner production processes. Thirdly, the use of bimetallic surfaces in this process allows for more efficient resource utilization and energy consumption, making it a more practical and cost-effective solution for industry. Lastly, the linear relationship between the d-band center and the reforming activity of oxygenates provides a clear correlation that can be harnessed to predict and optimize catalyst performance, leading to further advancements in sustainable energy and chemical production technologies.
