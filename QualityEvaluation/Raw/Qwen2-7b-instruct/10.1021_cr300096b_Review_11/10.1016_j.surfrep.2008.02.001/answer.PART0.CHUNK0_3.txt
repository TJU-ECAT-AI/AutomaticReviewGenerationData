1. The Ni /Pt MBS structures are among the most well-studied bimetallic systems, involving both theoretical and experimental approaches.
2. The number of d-electrons per surface Pt atom, as calculated by integrating the projected d-band density of states up to the Fermi level, remains approximately 9.3 for all surfaces.
3. A linear relationship exists between the root mean squared d-band width and the d-band center for both relaxed and unrelaxed slabs of monometallic and bimetallic systems, as depicted in Figure 11.
4. A comparison between the shift in the d-band center calculated via DFT and the estimated shift using Equation 3.11 is illustrated in Figure 12.

1. Ni /Pt MBS结构是研究最深入的双金属系统之一，涉及理论和实验方法。
2. 根据积分到费米能级的投影d带密度函数，每个表面Pt原子的d电子数约为9.3个，所有表面上都保持不变。
3. 如图11所示，在放松和平坦状态下，许多单金属和双金属系统的根方差d带宽度与d带中心之间存在线性关系。
4. 图12比较了通过DFT计算的d带中心偏移和使用方程式3.11估算的偏移之间的对比。
