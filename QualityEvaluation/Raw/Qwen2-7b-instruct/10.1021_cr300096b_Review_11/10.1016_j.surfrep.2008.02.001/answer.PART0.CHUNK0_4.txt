[1] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 on Ni(111) and Pt(111) is not an activated process."
[2] "Since the dissociative adsorption of H2 on the bimetallic surfaces is not activated, then desorption temperatures in Fig. 13 indicate a weaker metalH bond on subsurface PtNiPt(111) and a stronger metalH bond on surface NiPtPt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111)."
