[1] "The reforming reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol offer additional examples to illustrate the relationship between the reforming activity of oxygenates and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "Surface science studies would also provide a correlation with recent studies using supported catalysts, which showed that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol as compared to Pt/ γ - Al2O3 at similar conditions."
[3] "The reforming activity of both ethanol and ethylene glycol follows a linear relationship with the d-band center, although with different slopes."
[4] "For example, in the case of 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, the binding energy on the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structure is generally weaker than that on either parent metal, while the binding energy on the surface 3d-Pt(111) structure is stronger than that on either parent metal."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing the efficiency of hydrogen and other valuable products extraction from oxygenates like methanol and ethylene glycol. Key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to minimized waste and energy consumption, and improved practical implementation through optimized catalyst designs that match specific reaction conditions.

2. Recent studies indicate that supported catalysts such as NiPt, CoPt, and FePt show superior performance in aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. This suggests that the use of bimetallic catalysts can lead to increased turnover frequencies, which is crucial for sustainable energy production processes.

3. The reforming activity of oxygenates like ethanol and ethylene glycol correlates linearly with the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces, which helps in predicting and optimizing the performance of catalysts. Different slopes indicate that the relationship between d-band center and reforming activity can vary depending on the specific oxygenate involved.

4. In the context of bimetallic surfaces, the formation of subsurface structures like Pt-3d-Pt shifts the d-band center further away from the Fermi level compared to parent metals. This typically leads to weaker binding energies for adsorbates, which can be advantageous for hydrogenation reactions where keeping the bonds intact is desired. Conversely, for reforming reactions requiring the cleavage of bonds, stronger binding energies are preferred. The volcano relationship between the activity and the magnitude of d-band center shift can guide the rational design of more efficient catalysts.

1. 选择性氧化合物重整为可持续能源和化学生产做出贡献，通过提高从氧化合物如甲醇和乙二醇中提取氢和其他有价值产品的效率。关键优势包括更高的产品产量、由于减少了废物和能耗而降低了对环境的影响，以及通过与特定反应条件相匹配的优化催化剂设计实现更实际的实施。

2. 近期研究表明，如NiPt、CoPt和FePt这样的负载催化剂在水相乙二醇重整方面的转速高于γ-Al2O3上的Pt催化剂。这表明使用双金属催化剂可以实现更高的周转频率，这对于可持续能源生产过程至关重要。

3. 氧化物如乙醇和乙二醇的重整活动与双金属表面的能带中心呈线性关系，有助于预测和优化催化剂性能。不同的斜率表明，能带中心与重整活性之间的关系可能根据涉及的具体氧化物而有所不同。

4. 在双金属表面的背景下，形成亚表面结构如Pt-3d-Pt会将能带中心进一步远离费米能级，与母金属相比，这通常导致吸附剂的结合能较弱。对于保持键完整的氢化反应，这可能是有利的。相反，对于需要断裂键的重整反应，较强的结合能是首选。能带中心位移与活性之间的火山关系可以指导更有效的催化剂设计的合理设计。

[1] "The current review focuses on the general trends in the electronic and chemical properties of monolayer bimetallic surfaces (MBS). The MBS is defined in this review as a monolayer of admetal deposited on a single crystal metal substrate. Depending on the deposition temperature and reaction environment, the admetal in MBS can be in one of the three structures: occupying the topmost surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with surface to produce intermixed bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "The review will summarize recent experimental and theoretical studies of the surface monolayer, subsurface monolayer, and inter-mixed bimetallic structures to demonstrate their unique electronic and chemical properties."
[3] "One of the main goals of the catalysis industry is to develop new materials that have novel catalytic properties. Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinctly different from those of the parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity and stability."
[4] "Bimetallic surfaces, produced by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on a single crystal substrate, have allowed the utilization of a wide range of chemical, electronic and physical probes."
[5] "The modification effect is especially important when the admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime."
[6] "The formation of a bimetallic bond in MBS can lead to a shift in the surface d-band, resulting in a decrease or increase in the adsorbate binding energy."
[7] "The general trend in the chemical properties of MBS will be demonstrated using several classes of probe atoms and molecules."
[8] "In the past few years there have been significant efforts in experimental and DFT modeling of MBS. One of the new findings is that, depending on experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of the three structures: occupying the top-most surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with surface to produce inter-mixed bimetallic surfaces."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by providing an efficient way to generate hydrogen and other valuable products from renewable sources like methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol. Key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and the potential for direct integration into existing infrastructure, simplifying the transition to cleaner energy solutions.

2. The ability of supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt catalysts to display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 highlights the potential of bimetallic catalysts in enhancing the efficiency of oxygenate reforming reactions. This can lead to more sustainable and cost-effective production processes.

3. The relationship between the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces and their reactivity can be qualitatively visualized in Figure 51. This figure illustrates that for reactions requiring weakly bonded adsorbates, such as hydrogenation of alkenes, bimetallic surfaces with the d-band center further away from the Fermi level are preferred. Conversely, for reactions that require stronger adsorption energies, such as oxygenate reforming, surfaces with the d-band center closer to the Fermi level are advantageous.

4. In the context of hydrogenation, surfaces that bond weakly to atomic hydrogen and alkenes are preferred. This is because such surfaces maintain the integrity of the carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds, facilitating the desired chemical transformation.

5. For reforming reactions, the situation is reversed. Surfaces that bond more strongly to the oxygenate reactants and the reaction products of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are preferred. This is because the cleavage of carbon-carbon, carbon-hydrogen, and oxygen-hydrogen bonds requires stronger bonding, which is facilitated by bimetallic surfaces with a d-band center closer to the Fermi level.

2. 支持的NiPt、CoPt和FePt催化剂在水相乙二醇重整过程中相对于γ-Al2O3的转速增加显示了双金属催化剂在氧气化合物重整反应中的潜力。这可以导致更可持续和成本效益高的生产过程。

3. 双金属表面的d带中心与其反应活性之间的关系可以通过图51进行定性可视化。该图说明，在需要弱吸附剂的反应（如烯烃氢化）中，d带中心远离费米能级的双金属表面是优选的。相反，对于需要更强吸附能的反应（如氧化合物重整），具有更接近费米能级的d带中心的表面是优势的。

4. 在氢化背景下，那些与原子氢和烯烃弱结合的表面是优选的。这是因为这样的表面保持碳-碳和碳-氢键的完整性，促进所需的化学转化。

5. 对于重整反应，情况正好相反。那些与氧化合物反应物和氢气和一氧化碳的反应产物结合更紧密的表面是优选的。这是因为断裂碳-碳、碳-氢和氧-氢键需要更强的结合，这得益于具有更接近费米能级的d带中心的双金属表面。

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by offering a more efficient and environmentally friendly way to produce hydrogen and other valuable products. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming has several key advantages:

1. **Increased Product Yield**: Selective oxygenate reforming, particularly when using bimetallic surfaces like NiPt, CoPt, and FePt, can achieve higher turnover frequencies for the reforming of oxygenates such as ethylene glycol and ethanol. This means that more products, like hydrogen, can be generated per unit of time and input material.

2. **Reduced Environmental Impact**: By optimizing the conditions for reforming reactions, selective oxygenate reforming minimizes the release of pollutants and waste. This is particularly beneficial in the context of hydrogen production, as hydrogen is a clean and renewable energy carrier that can be used in various sectors, including transportation and industry.

3. **Enhanced Selectivity**: The linear relationship between the reforming activity and the d-band center of the bimetallic surfaces indicates that precise control over the surface properties can lead to enhanced selectivity in the production of specific products. This means that hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be selectively produced from oxygenates, reducing the formation of unwanted byproducts.

4. **Practical Implementation**: The ability to tailor the surface properties of bimetallic catalysts to specific reaction conditions opens up possibilities for more practical and scalable manufacturing processes. This can lead to the development of cost-effective, industrially viable methods for hydrogen production from renewable sources, such as biomass or electrolysis of water.

5. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The enhanced efficiency and selectivity of selective oxygenate reforming can lead to lower costs associated with energy consumption and product recovery, making it a more economically viable option compared to traditional methods.

In summary, selective oxygenate reforming offers a promising avenue for sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing product yield, reducing environmental impact, improving selectivity, facilitating practical implementation, and achieving cost-effectiveness.
