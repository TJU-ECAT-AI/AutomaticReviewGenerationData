[1] "The reforming reactions of methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol offer additional examples to illustrate the relationship between the reforming activity of oxygenates and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "Surface science studies would also provide a correlation with recent studies using supported catalysts, which showed that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol as compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 at similar conditions."

[3] "The reforming activities of both ethanol and ethylene glycol follow a linear relationship with the d-band center, although with different slopes."

[4] "The results discussed in Section 5.2 show that the trends in the reactivity of various oxygenates, such as methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol, are similar on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. This suggests that these smaller probe molecules might be useful to help understand the chemistry of larger oxygenates, such as glycerol and glucose, which are important biomass-derived reactants for either H2 or biofuels production."

The selective oxygenate reforming process contributes significantly to sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions. Key advantages include:

1. **Increased Product Yield**: The reforming of oxygenates like methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol leads to higher yields of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which are crucial feedstocks for renewable energy production and chemical synthesis.

2. **Reduced Environmental Impact**: By optimizing the conditions and catalysts, the process minimizes waste and emissions, aligning with sustainable practices.

3. **Enhanced Turnover Frequencies**: Studies show that bimetallic catalysts, such as NiPt, CoPt, and FePt, can achieve higher turnover frequencies compared to single metal catalysts, like Pt/γ-Al2O3, for aqueous phase reforming of oxygenates. This translates to more efficient use of resources and energy.

4. **Flexibility in Feedstock**: Selective reforming allows for the conversion of diverse oxygenates into hydrogen and carbon monoxide, enabling the use of a wider range of biomass-derived feedstocks for biofuels and other chemicals production.

These advantages make selective oxygenate reforming a promising technology for advancing sustainable energy and chemical production, offering a cleaner, more efficient, and versatile approach compared to traditional methods.

选择性氧化物重整过程在可持续能源和化学生产中贡献巨大，通过提高反应效率和选择性。关键优势包括：

1. **更高的产品产率**：对氧化的重整（如甲醇、乙醇和乙二醇）能产生更多的氢气和一氧化碳，这些是可再生能源生产和化学合成的关键原料。

2. **减少环境影响**：通过优化条件和催化剂，该过程能够减少废物和排放，与可持续做法相一致。

3. **增强周转频率**：研究表明，双金属催化剂（如NiPt、CoPt和FePt）在水相氧代物重整中的周转频率比单金属催化剂（如Pt/γ-Al2O3）更高。这意味着资源和能源的更有效利用。

4. **灵活的原料**：选择性重整允许将各种氧化的生物质原料转化为氢气和一氧化碳，为生物燃料和其他化学品生产提供了更广泛的原料选项。

这些优势使选择性氧化物重整成为推进可持续能源和化学生产的一项有前景的技术，提供了一个清洁、高效且多功能的方法，与传统方法相比更具优势。
