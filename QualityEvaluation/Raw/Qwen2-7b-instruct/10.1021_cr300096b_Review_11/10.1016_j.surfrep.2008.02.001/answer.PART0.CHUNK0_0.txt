[1] "The current review focuses on the general trends in the electronic and chemical properties of monolayer bimetallic surfaces (MBS). The MBS is defined in this review as a monolayer of admetal deposited on a single crystal metal substrate. Depending on the deposition temperature and reaction environment, the admetal in MBS can be in one of the three structures: occupying the topmost surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with surface to produce intermixed bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "The review will summarize recent experimental and theoretical studies of the surface monolayer, subsurface monolayer, and inter-mixed bimetallic structures to demonstrate their unique electronic and chemical properties."
[3] "One of the main goals of the catalysis industry is to develop new materials that have novel catalytic properties. Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinctly different from those of the parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity and stability."
[4] "Bimetallic surfaces, produced by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on a single crystal substrate, have allowed the utilization of a wide range of chemical, electronic and physical probes."
[5] "The modification effect is especially important when the admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime."
[6] "The formation of a bimetallic bond in MBS can lead to a shift in the surface d-band, resulting in a decrease or increase in the adsorbate binding energy."
[7] "The general trend in the chemical properties of MBS will be demonstrated using several classes of probe atoms and molecules."
[8] "In the past few years there have been significant efforts in experimental and DFT modeling of MBS. One of the new findings is that, depending on experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of the three structures: occupying the top-most surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with surface to produce inter-mixed bimetallic surfaces."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming plays a crucial role in sustainable energy and chemical production. It enhances product yield, minimizes environmental impact, and facilitates practical implementation compared to traditional methods. The key advantages are:

1. **Enhanced Selectivity**: Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those exhibiting distinct electronic and chemical properties from their parent metals, enable the development of catalysts with improved selectivity. This means they can selectively convert reactants into desired products, reducing waste and inefficiencies.

2. **Increased Activity and Stability**: The unique properties of bimetallic surfaces can lead to enhanced activity and stability in catalytic processes. This prolongs the life of the catalyst, reduces maintenance costs, and increases productivity.

3. **Utilization of Chemical Probes**: Bimetallic surfaces permit the application of a diverse range of chemical, electronic, and physical probes, offering insights into surface chemistry and catalytic behavior that are not possible with single metals. This comprehensive understanding aids in optimizing processes and designing more efficient catalysts.

4. **Modification Effects**: At low coverage levels, the interaction between admetal and the substrate can lead to subtle modifications in electronic properties, influencing the surface chemistry and catalytic performance. These modifications can enhance selectivity and efficiency in specific reactions.

5. **Shift in Adsorbate Binding Energies**: The formation of bimetallic bonds in monolayer bimetallic surfaces (MBS) can alter the electronic structure of the surface, affecting the binding energies of adsorbates. This can lead to more favorable conditions for selective reactions, improving product yields and reducing byproducts.

6. **Broad Application Scope**: The experimental and theoretical studies on MBS have shown that the properties of these surfaces can be tailored for various chemical processes. This versatility allows for the optimization of reactions across different industries, from petrochemicals to renewable energy technologies.

In summary, selective oxygenate reforming benefits from the strategic use of bimetallic surfaces, which can be designed to maximize efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and facilitate practical industrial applications.
