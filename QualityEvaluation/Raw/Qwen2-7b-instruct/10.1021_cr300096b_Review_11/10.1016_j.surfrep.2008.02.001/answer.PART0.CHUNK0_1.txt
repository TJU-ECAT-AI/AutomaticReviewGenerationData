[1] "One of the main goals of the catalysis industry is to develop new materials that have novel catalytic properties. Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinctly different from those of the parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity and stability."
[2] "For this reason, bimetallic surfaces have also gained a considerable amount of interest for fundamental surface science research, as summarized in several earlier reviews."
[3] "It is now well known that bimetallic surfaces often show novel properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces."
[4] "The combination of DFT modeling and experimental results revealed a general correlation between the position of the surface d-band center and the adsorption energy for various MBS structures, making it possible to predict bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties."
