[1] "The reforming reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol offer additional examples to illustrate the relationship between the reforming activity of oxygenates and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "Surface science studies would also provide a correlation with recent studies using supported catalysts, which showed that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol as compared to Pt/ γ - Al2O3 at similar conditions."
[3] "The general correlation of the modification of the d-band center and the reactivity of bimetallic surfaces are qualitatively illustrated in Fig. 51."
[4] "For example, for the hydrogenation of alkenes, the preferred surfaces are those that bond weakly to atomic hydrogen and alkenes, which are MBS structures with the surface d-band center further away from the Fermi level."
[5] "On the other hand, the reforming reaction requires MBS structures with stronger adsorption energies, i.e. with the d-band center closer to the Fermi level as compared to the parent metals."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by providing an efficient way to generate hydrogen and other valuable products from renewable sources like methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol. Key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and the potential for direct integration into existing infrastructure, simplifying the transition to cleaner energy solutions.

2. The ability of supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt catalysts to display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 highlights the potential of bimetallic catalysts in enhancing the efficiency of oxygenate reforming reactions. This can lead to more sustainable and cost-effective production processes.

3. The relationship between the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces and their reactivity can be qualitatively visualized in Figure 51. This figure illustrates that for reactions requiring weakly bonded adsorbates, such as hydrogenation of alkenes, bimetallic surfaces with the d-band center further away from the Fermi level are preferred. Conversely, for reactions that require stronger adsorption energies, such as oxygenate reforming, surfaces with the d-band center closer to the Fermi level are advantageous.

4. In the context of hydrogenation, surfaces that bond weakly to atomic hydrogen and alkenes are preferred. This is because such surfaces maintain the integrity of the carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds, facilitating the desired chemical transformation.

5. For reforming reactions, the situation is reversed. Surfaces that bond more strongly to the oxygenate reactants and the reaction products of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are preferred. This is because the cleavage of carbon-carbon, carbon-hydrogen, and oxygen-hydrogen bonds requires stronger bonding, which is facilitated by bimetallic surfaces with a d-band center closer to the Fermi level.

1. 选择性氧化合物重整为可持续能源和化学生产提供了高效的方法，通过从可再生资源如甲醇、乙醇和乙二醇等产生氢和其他有价值的产物。主要优势包括更高的产品产率、较低的环境影响（由于排放量较低）以及与现有基础设施的直接集成潜力，简化了向清洁能源解决方案的过渡。

2. 支持的NiPt、CoPt和FePt催化剂在水相乙二醇重整过程中相对于γ-Al2O3的转速增加显示了双金属催化剂在氧气化合物重整反应中的潜力。这可以导致更可持续和成本效益高的生产过程。

3. 双金属表面的d带中心与其反应活性之间的关系可以通过图51进行定性可视化。该图说明，在需要弱吸附剂的反应（如烯烃氢化）中，d带中心远离费米能级的双金属表面是优选的。相反，对于需要更强吸附能的反应（如氧化合物重整），具有更接近费米能级的d带中心的表面是优势的。

4. 在氢化背景下，那些与原子氢和烯烃弱结合的表面是优选的。这是因为这样的表面保持碳-碳和碳-氢键的完整性，促进所需的化学转化。

5. 对于重整反应，情况正好相反。那些与氧化合物反应物和氢气和一氧化碳的反应产物结合更紧密的表面是优选的。这是因为断裂碳-碳、碳-氢和氧-氢键需要更强的结合，这得益于具有更接近费米能级的d带中心的双金属表面。
