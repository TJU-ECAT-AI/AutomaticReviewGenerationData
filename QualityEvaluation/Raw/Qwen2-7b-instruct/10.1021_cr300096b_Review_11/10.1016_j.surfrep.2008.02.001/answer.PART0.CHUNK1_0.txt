[1] "The reforming reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol offer additional examples to illustrate the relationship between the reforming activity of oxygenates and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "Surface science studies would also provide a correlation with recent studies using supported catalysts, which showed that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol as compared to Pt/ γ - Al2O3 at similar conditions."
[3] "The reforming activity of both ethanol and ethylene glycol follows a linear relationship with the d-band center, although with different slopes."
[4] "For example, in the case of 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, the binding energy on the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structure is generally weaker than that on either parent metal, while the binding energy on the surface 3d-Pt(111) structure is stronger than that on either parent metal."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing the efficiency of hydrogen and other valuable products extraction from oxygenates like methanol and ethylene glycol. Key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to minimized waste and energy consumption, and improved practical implementation through optimized catalyst designs that match specific reaction conditions.

2. Recent studies indicate that supported catalysts such as NiPt, CoPt, and FePt show superior performance in aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. This suggests that the use of bimetallic catalysts can lead to increased turnover frequencies, which is crucial for sustainable energy production processes.

3. The reforming activity of oxygenates like ethanol and ethylene glycol correlates linearly with the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces, which helps in predicting and optimizing the performance of catalysts. Different slopes indicate that the relationship between d-band center and reforming activity can vary depending on the specific oxygenate involved.

4. In the context of bimetallic surfaces, the formation of subsurface structures like Pt-3d-Pt shifts the d-band center further away from the Fermi level compared to parent metals. This typically leads to weaker binding energies for adsorbates, which can be advantageous for hydrogenation reactions where keeping the bonds intact is desired. Conversely, for reforming reactions requiring the cleavage of bonds, stronger binding energies are preferred. The volcano relationship between the activity and the magnitude of d-band center shift can guide the rational design of more efficient catalysts.

1. 选择性氧化合物重整为可持续能源和化学生产做出贡献，通过提高从氧化合物如甲醇和乙二醇中提取氢和其他有价值产品的效率。关键优势包括更高的产品产量、由于减少了废物和能耗而降低了对环境的影响，以及通过与特定反应条件相匹配的优化催化剂设计实现更实际的实施。

2. 近期研究表明，如NiPt、CoPt和FePt这样的负载催化剂在水相乙二醇重整方面的转速高于γ-Al2O3上的Pt催化剂。这表明使用双金属催化剂可以实现更高的周转频率，这对于可持续能源生产过程至关重要。

3. 氧化物如乙醇和乙二醇的重整活动与双金属表面的能带中心呈线性关系，有助于预测和优化催化剂性能。不同的斜率表明，能带中心与重整活性之间的关系可能根据涉及的具体氧化物而有所不同。

4. 在双金属表面的背景下，形成亚表面结构如Pt-3d-Pt会将能带中心进一步远离费米能级，与母金属相比，这通常导致吸附剂的结合能较弱。对于保持键完整的氢化反应，这可能是有利的。相反，对于需要断裂键的重整反应，较强的结合能是首选。能带中心位移与活性之间的火山关系可以指导更有效的催化剂设计的合理设计。
