1. Bio-ethanol, obtained through the fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plants, is recognized as a renewable fuel. It has the potential for carbon neutrality in the entire cycle from crop cultivation to hydrogen production, although the balance between CO2 absorption and release varies depending on factors such as infrastructure, crop type, and processing methods.

2. Ethanol steam reforming, particularly in vehicles powered by proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), is advantageous because it can produce more hydrogen per mole of ethanol, and hydrogen can also be extracted from the steam.

3. Studies have primarily focused on inorganic oxides or oxide-supported metals as catalysts for ethanol steam reforming.

4. Organometallic cluster-derived nanoparticles are more stable and active compared to their salt-derived counterparts.

5. The monometallic Ru cluster-derived catalyst and the bimetallic RuPt cluster-derived catalyst surpassed their salt-derived counterparts and a commercial Ru/Al2O3 catalyst in terms of catalytic performance.

6. The cluster-derived catalysts demonstrated superior activity and selectivity over the Ru, RuPt salt-derived catalysts, commercial catalysts, and Co/ZnO catalyst.

7. The Rh catalyst is often regarded as one of the most active catalysts for ethanol steam reforming.

8. The optimal reforming temperatures for the cluster-derived catalysts ranged from 500 to 600 degrees Celsius, whereas other catalysts required at least 100 degrees Celsius higher temperatures.

9. A Co/ZnO catalyst was reported to achieve 100% ethanol conversion at 450 degrees Celsius, yet under the same conditions, the conversion was approximately 65% at a GHSV of 30,000 h1.

10. The cluster-derived catalysts showed significantly higher activity and selectivity compared to the Ru, RuPt salt-derived catalysts, commercial catalysts, and Co/ZnO catalyst.

1. 生物乙醇，通过碳水化合物丰富的植物发酵获得，被认为是可再生能源。它在整个作物种植到氢气生产的周期中具有潜在的碳中性，尽管CO2吸收和释放之间的平衡取决于基础设施、作物类型和处理方法等因素。

2. 对于由质子交换膜燃料电池（PEMFC）驱动的车辆，乙醇蒸汽重整特别有利，因为它可以产生每摩尔乙醇更多的氢气，并且可以从蒸汽中提取氢气。

3. 到目前为止的研究主要集中在无机氧化物或氧化物支持的金属作为乙醇蒸汽重整的催化剂。

4. 与盐衍生的同辈相比，有机金属簇衍生的纳米颗粒更加稳定和活跃。

5. 单金属Ru簇衍生催化剂和双金属RuPt簇衍生催化剂在活性和选择性方面超过了其盐衍生的同辈和商业Ru/Al2O3催化剂。
