The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by providing a renewable source of hydrogen from bio-ethanol. Key advantages include:

1. Renewable fuel: Ethanol, derived from carbohydrate-rich plants, offers a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.
2. High hydrogen/carbon ratio: Ethanol provides a higher proportion of hydrogen compared to other hydrocarbons, making it an efficient feedstock for hydrogen production.
3. Ease of transport: Ethanol can be easily transported, facilitating its use across different geographical locations.
4. Low toxicity: Ethanol is relatively non-toxic, reducing environmental hazards associated with hydrogen production.
5. Enhanced activity and selectivity: Organometallic cluster-derived catalysts, especially those containing bimetallic components like Ru and Pt, demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional catalysts. This is attributed to their smaller particle sizes, precise metal composition control, and enhanced ability to facilitate the desired chemical reactions, particularly at low temperatures.
6. Water gas shift reaction promotion: Platinum (Pt) acts as a co-catalyst, promoting the water gas shift reaction, which is crucial for increasing the yield of hydrogen from ethanol steam reforming.
7. Efficient hydrogen production: Cluster-derived catalysts enable higher hydrogen yields per mole of ethanol, making the process more economically viable and environmentally friendly.
