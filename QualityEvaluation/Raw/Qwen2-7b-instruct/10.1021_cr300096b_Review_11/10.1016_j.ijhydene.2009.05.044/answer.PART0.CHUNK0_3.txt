<p>The hydrogen economy is seen as a possible solution to the various economical, environmental and security woes associated with the current fossil fuel-based economy.</p>
<p>There are several advantages of using this last production method. Firstly, bio-ethanol, which can be obtained by fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plants, is considered to be a renewable fuel.</p>
<p>In addition, the whole cycle from the growing of crops to the production hydrogen is potentially carbon neutral, though in practice, the balance between CO2 uptake and release depends on various factors, including infrastructure, the type of crops and processing methods.</p>
<p>Ethanol also has a comparatively high hydrogen/carbon ratio, can be easily transported, and is relatively non-toxic.</p>
<p>The steam reforming of ethanol, as represented in Eq. (1), is an attractive method for on-board hydrogen generation in vehicles powered by proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which typically operate at relatively low temperatures and have notoriously low CO-tolerance.</p>
<p>Most of the ethanol steam reforming studies reported to date have involved either inorganic oxides or oxide-supported metals as catalysts.</p>
<p>Organometallic cluster-derived nanoparticles have been previously reported to be more stable and active than their salt-derived counterparts, and were used successfully as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.</p>
<p>Therein, the catalytic performance of a monometallic Ru cluster-derived catalyst and a bimetallic RuPt cluster-derived catalyst outperformed all their salt-derived counterparts, as well as a commercial Ru/Al2O3 catalyst.</p>
<p>With the use of cluster precursors, excellent control of bimetallic composition and smaller particle sizes were achieved.</p>
<p>There are several advantages of using ethanol steam reforming over other hydrogen production methods:</p>

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production in several ways. Its key advantages over traditional methods include:

1. **Product Yield**: Ethanol steam reforming provides a higher yield of hydrogen per mole of ethanol compared to conventional steam reforming processes. This is because hydrogen can also be extracted from the steam.

2. **Environmental Impact**: The entire cycle from growing crops to producing hydrogen through ethanol is potentially carbon neutral. However, the balance between CO2 uptake and release varies based on factors such as infrastructure, crop type, and processing methods.

3. **Ease of Transport and Non-Toxicity**: Ethanol is easy to transport and less toxic than other fuels, making it a safer alternative for hydrogen production.

4. **Suitability for PEMFCs**: Ethanol steam reforming is particularly suitable for generating hydrogen for vehicles powered by proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which operate efficiently at lower temperatures and have low tolerance for carbon monoxide.

5. **Controlled Bimetallic Composition and Particle Sizes**: Using organometallic cluster precursors allows for precise control over the bimetallic composition and smaller particle sizes of the catalysts, leading to more efficient hydrogen production.

These advantages make ethanol steam reforming a promising method for sustainable hydrogen production and chemical synthesis, especially when integrated with renewable energy sources for carbon-neutral operations.

选择性氧化物重整在可持续能源和化学生产中具有多种优势。与传统方法相比，其主要优势包括：

1. **产氢量**：与常规蒸汽重整过程相比，通过乙醇重整提供的氢产量更高，因为可以从蒸汽中提取氢。

2. **环境影响**：从种植作物到通过乙醇生产氢的整个周期可能实现碳中和。然而，CO2吸收与释放之间的平衡取决于基础设施、作物类型和加工方法等因素。

3. **易于运输和无毒性**：乙醇易于运输且毒性较低，使其成为氢生产的安全替代品。

4. **适合PEMFC**：乙醇蒸汽重整特别适用于为使用质子交换膜燃料电池（PEMFC）的车辆生成氢，这些燃料电池在较低温度下运行，并且对一氧化碳的容忍度低。

5. **精确控制双金属组成和颗粒大小**：使用有机金属簇前体允许对催化剂的双金属组成和颗粒大小进行精确控制，从而提高氢生产的效率。

这些优势使乙醇蒸汽重整成为可持续氢生产和化学合成的有前景的方法，特别是与可再生能源集成以实现无碳排放操作时。
