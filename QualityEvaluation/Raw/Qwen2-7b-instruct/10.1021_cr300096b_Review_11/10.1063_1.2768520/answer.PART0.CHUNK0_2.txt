The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling more efficient conversion of organic compounds into valuable products. Its key advantages over traditional methods include higher product yields due to optimized reaction conditions, reduced environmental impact because of minimized byproduct formation, and enhanced practical implementation through the use of advanced catalysts and surface engineering. This study specifically investigates the reactivity of methanol on bimetallic surfaces, which can lead to improved catalytic performance and selectivity, thus enhancing the sustainability and efficiency of the reforming process.
