Coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts are found to be efficient promoters for methanation. Although A1203 itself is not active in the methanation reaction, it is active for the irreversible adsorption of CO 2 at the reaction temperatures considered. Reverse spillover from alumina to nickel increases the methane production per unit metal surface area especially for coprecipitated catalysts with low Ni loadings.
The results obtained confirm that the structure and activity of coprecipitated Ni/AI20 3 catalysts is directly related to their metal content. Methanation activity is found to be dependent on the nickel content and on the degree of CO 2 adsorption at the reaction temperatures considered.
