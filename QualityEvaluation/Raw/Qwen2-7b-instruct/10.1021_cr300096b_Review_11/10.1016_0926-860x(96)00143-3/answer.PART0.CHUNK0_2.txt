[1] "Coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts are found to be efficient promoters for methanation."
[2] "Methana- tion activity is dependent on the nickel content and the degree of CO 2 adsorption at the reaction considered."
[3] "Although A1203 itself is not active in the methanation reaction, it is active for the irreversible adsorption of CO 2 at the reaction temperatures considered."
[4] "Reverse spillover from alumina to nickel increases the methane production per unit metal surface area especially for coprecipitated catalysts with low Ni loadings."
