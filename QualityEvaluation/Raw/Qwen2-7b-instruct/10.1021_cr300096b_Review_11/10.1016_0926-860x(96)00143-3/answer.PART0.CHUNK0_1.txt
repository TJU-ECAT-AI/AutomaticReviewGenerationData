Coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts are found to be efficient promoters for methanation. Methana- tion activity is dependent on the nickel content and the degree of CO 2 adsorption at the reaction considered. Although A1203 does not exhibit methanation activity, it is found to be active for CO 2 adsorption. Reverse spillover increases methane production per unit nickel surface particularly for catalysts with low Ni loadings.
Reverse spillover from alumina to nickel increases the methane production per unit metal surface area especially for coprecipitated catalysts with low Ni loadings.
The results obtained confirm that the structure and activity of coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts is directly related to their metal content. Methanation activity is found to be dependent on the nickel content and on the degree of CO 2 adsorption at the reaction temperatures considered.

1. Coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts are effective promoters for methanation, where the activity relies on nickel content and the extent of CO 2 adsorption at the reaction temperatures.
2. Alumina, despite not showing methanation activity on its own, is active for CO 2 adsorption.
3. Reverse spillover enhances methane production per unit nickel surface area, particularly in catalysts with lower nickel loadings.
4. The structure and activity of coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts are closely linked to their metal content, with methanation activity influenced by nickel content and CO 2 adsorption levels.
