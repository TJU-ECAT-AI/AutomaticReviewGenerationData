[1] "Recently, there has been a lot of interest in light hydrocarbons CO2-reforming, due to the use of synthesis gas as feedstock for several chemical processes, i.e. fuel cells, methanol synthesis and FischerTropsch reaction."
[2] "The commonly used catalysts for dry reforming are Ni-based catalysts. Unfortunately, under reforming conditions, Ni catalysts tend to form Ni clusters and unreactive carbon that could block the catalysts pores and encapsulate the active sites, which would lead to quick catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Moreover, Pt addition promoted the formation of NiO, instead of NiAl2O4, and facilitated its reduction to Ni0 during the catalysts activation."
[4] "From stability tests it can be concluded that Pt enhances the stability of Ni-based catalysts for DRM."
[5] "The aim of the present work is to develop stable Ni-containing catalysts with resistance to coke deposition and good performance under reforming conditions."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting light hydrocarbons into synthesis gas, which is used in various chemical processes like fuel cells, methanol synthesis, and Fischer-Tropsch reactions. Its key advantages include higher product yields, lower environmental impact due to reduced carbon emissions, and enhanced practical implementation through optimized catalysts that prevent coke formation and maintain high stability.
2. Traditional methods often suffer from the formation of Ni clusters and unreactive carbon, which block catalyst pores and encapsulate active sites, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation. In contrast, the use of Pt catalysts can inhibit carbon deposition, reduce the formation of coke, and enhance the stability of Ni-based catalysts for dry reforming of methane.
3. The addition of Pt to Ni-based catalysts promotes the formation of NiO instead of NiAl2O4, which facilitates easier reduction to the active Ni0 state during activation. This not only improves the stability of the catalysts but also reduces the risk of coke deposition.
4. The enhanced stability of Pt-added Ni-based catalysts for dry reforming of methane is crucial for maintaining high performance over prolonged operation times, which is essential for industrial applications aiming to achieve sustainable and efficient energy production.
5. The research aims to develop stable Ni-containing catalysts that resist coke deposition and perform well under reforming conditions, focusing on improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of the dry reforming process.

1. 选择性氧化物重整通过有效地将轻烃转化为合成气，用于燃料电池、甲醇合成和费休斯-特罗斯化学反应等化工过程，对可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。其主要优势包括更高的产品产出率、较低的环境影响（由于减少了碳排放）以及通过优化催化剂防止焦炭沉积和保持高稳定性实现的实践实施优化。
2. 传统方法常常导致镍簇形成和不反应的碳沉积，这些会堵塞催化剂孔道并封装活性位点，从而迅速导致催化剂失活。相比之下，使用铂催化剂可以抑制碳沉积，减少焦炭形成，并增强镍基催化剂在干式甲烷重整中的稳定性。
3. 向镍基催化剂中添加铂促进了镍氧化物（NiO）的形成而非镍铝氧化物（NiAl2O4），这使得在催化剂激活过程中更容易还原为活性状态Ni0。这不仅提高了催化剂的稳定性，还降低了焦炭沉积的风险。
4. 加入铂的镍基催化剂的增强稳定性对于维持长时间操作期间的高性能至关重要，这对于寻求实现可持续和高效能源生产的工业应用来说是关键的。
5. 研究旨在开发稳定且能够抵抗焦炭沉积的镍系催化剂，同时在重整条件下表现出良好的性能，重点是提高干式甲烷重整过程的整体效率和可持续性。
