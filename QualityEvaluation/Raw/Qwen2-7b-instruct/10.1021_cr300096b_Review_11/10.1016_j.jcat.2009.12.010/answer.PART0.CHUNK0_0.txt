[1] "Recently, there has been a lot of interest in light hydrocarbons CO2-reforming, due to the use of synthesis gas as feedstock for several chemical processes, i.e. fuel cells, methanol synthesis and FischerTropsch reaction."
[2] "Furthermore, dry reforming could be an alternative route to convert Natural Gas into products of higher value. The CO2-reforming of methane (DRM) is a process being developed for the production of syngas and CO."
[3] "Unfortunately, under reforming conditions, Ni catalysts tend to form Ni clusters and unreactive carbon that could block the catalysts pores and encapsulate the active sites, which would lead to quick catalyst deactivation."
[4] "However, carbon formation can be reduced or suppressed by controlling the reaction kinetically using adequate metals and supports."
[5] "Moreover, Pt inhibits coke deposition and reduces the operation temperature."
[6] "It has been studied by Martnez et al. the use of a nanofibrous alumina as support for RuCo catalysts for FischerTropsch process, which allows lower Co particle size and higher dispersion values than others commercial aluminas."
[7] "The aim of the present work is to develop stable Ni-containing catalysts with resistance to coke deposition and good performance under reforming conditions."

Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting oxygenates like alcohols and ethers into valuable hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals. Its key advantages include:

1. Enhanced product yield: Selective oxygenate reforming processes can selectively convert oxygenates to hydrocarbons, maximizing the yield of desired products.
2. Reduced environmental impact: By utilizing oxygenates as feedstocks, it offers an alternative to fossil fuels, potentially lowering greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on non-renewable resources.
3. Improved practical implementation: The use of optimized catalysts and conditions allows for efficient and cost-effective conversion, making the process scalable and economically viable.

These benefits make selective oxygenate reforming a promising technology for the production of sustainable fuels and chemicals, contributing to the transition towards cleaner energy sources.
