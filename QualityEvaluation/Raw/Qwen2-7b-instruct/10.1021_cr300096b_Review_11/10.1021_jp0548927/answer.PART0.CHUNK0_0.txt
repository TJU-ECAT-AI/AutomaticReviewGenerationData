[1] "The dehydrogenation and decarbonylation of ethylene glycol and ethanol were studied using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) on Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, as probe reactions for the reforming of oxygenates for the production of H2 for fuel cells."
[2] "Surfaces prepared by deposition of a monolayer of Ni on Pt(111) at 300 K, designated NiPtPt(111), displayed increased reforming activity compared to Pt(111), subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111), and thick Ni/Pt(111)."
[3] "Reforming activity was correlated with the d-band center of the surfaces and displayed a linear trend for both ethylene glycol and ethanol, with activity increasing as the surface d-band center moved closer to the Fermi level."
[4] "The surface monolayer NiPtPt(111) displays the highest reforming activity, compared to Pt(111), subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111), and thick Ni/Pt(111) surfaces."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling the efficient conversion of oxygenates into hydrogen, a clean and versatile fuel source. Its key advantages over traditional methods include:

   a. Higher product yield: The study found that the surface monolayer NiPtPt(111) displayed the highest reforming activity, indicating that selective reforming processes can achieve higher yields of hydrogen compared to conventional methods.
   
   b. Reduced environmental impact: Hydrogen produced through oxygenate reforming is considered cleaner since it emits fewer pollutants than traditional fossil fuels during combustion.
   
   c. Practical implementation: The ability to use less expensive metals like nickel in the reforming process reduces costs and makes hydrogen production more economically viable.
   
2. The reforming process allows for the selective conversion of oxygenates into hydrogen, which is crucial for fuel cells and other applications requiring hydrogen as a fuel source. This method offers several advantages over traditional processes:
   
   a. Increased efficiency: The study correlates reforming activity with the d-band center of the surfaces, suggesting that surfaces with a d-band center closer to the Fermi level can enhance the reforming process.
   
   b. Enhanced selectivity: The process minimizes unwanted reactions, such as CO bond scission, leading to higher yields of hydrogen and fewer byproducts.
   
   c. Cost-effectiveness: The use of nickel-based catalysts, which are less expensive than precious metals, can make the hydrogen production process more economical.
