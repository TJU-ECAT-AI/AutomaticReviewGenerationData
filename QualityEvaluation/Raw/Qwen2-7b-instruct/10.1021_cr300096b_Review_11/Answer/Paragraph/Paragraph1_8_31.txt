        Selective oxygenate reforming contributes significantly to sustainable energy and chemical production by converting oxygenates like methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol into hydrogen and other valuable products. This process offers numerous advantages over traditional methods, including higher product yields, minimized environmental impact, and practical implementation. The controlled decomposition of methanol to CO and hydrogen on a Pt(ll1) surface, as observed through time-resolved high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, exemplifies the precision and efficiency of selective oxygenate reforming.

        In terms of practical implementation, the use of supported PtRu catalysts, especially over TiO2, in liquid phase methanol reforming with water offers a promising solution for hydrogen production with several benefits. The advantages of liquid phase reforming, including making more compact and simple reaction equipment and eliminating the need for the evaporation energy of methanol aqueous solution, are particularly noteworthy. Different oxide supports (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, MgO, CeO2, ZrO2) influence the catalytic activity and selectivity of the reforming process, highlighting the importance of material selection.

        The coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts are found to be efficient promoters for methanation, with enhanced methane production per unit metal surface area, especially for catalysts with low Ni loadings. The structure and activity of coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts are directly related to their metal content, and methanation activity is found to be dependent on the nickel content and on the degree of CO2 adsorption at the reaction temperatures considered.

        The dehydrogenation and decarbonylation of ethylene glycol and ethanol using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) on Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces provide insights into the probe reactions for the reforming of oxygenates for hydrogen production. Surfaces with a monolayer of NiPtPt(111) display the highest reforming activity, leading to increased hydrogen production. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by providing a cleaner alternative to traditional methods.

        A study on the methanol decomposition over ZrO2-supported bimetallic Pt-M nanocatalysts (M = Au, Pd, Ru, Fe) reveals that the addition of secondary metals significantly affects the catalyst's activity and oxidation state of Pt. This highlights the importance of material composition in achieving optimal catalytic performance.

        The application of density functional theory (DFT) to calculate adsorption properties, reaction pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions aids in understanding and predicting variations in reactivity from one transition metal to the next or the effects of alloying, surface structure, and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions on the reactivity. This theoretical framework supports the development of efficient catalysts and enhances the sustainability and efficiency of the selective oxygenate reforming process.

        The transportation sector requires fuels that burn cleanly and have high energy densities for efficient storage at ambient conditions. Ethanol, as a cleaner alternative, can be converted into hydrogen for fuel cells and hydrogen-powered engines through selective oxygenate reforming, offering higher yields, reduced environmental impact, and compatibility with existing infrastructure. This process also addresses the challenges of sulfur poisoning catalysts through preemptive regeneration, maintaining high activity and efficiency.

        Bimetallic surface structures allow for a higher yield of desired products compared to conventional processes, enabling more efficient and sustainable energy and chemical production. This technique also has a lower environmental impact as it minimizes the formation of unwanted byproducts, making it ideal for sustainable technologies.

        The reforming reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol offer additional examples to illustrate the relationship between the reforming activity of oxygenates and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces. The bimetallic surface structures allow for a higher yield of desired products compared to conventional processes, demonstrating the environmental benefits and practical advantages of selective oxygenate reforming over traditional methods.

        The initial sticking coefficient and the saturation first layer coverage of CH3OD are unity and 0.36 ML, respectively. The maximum amounts decomposed in TPD on O/Pt(111) and clean Pt(111) are 0.19 and 0.047 ML, respectively. At low methanol coverages (< 0.05 ML) on O/Pt(111), the only reaction products were CO2, H2O, and D2O, whereas at saturation, CO, H2O, D2O, and H2 were observed. This study underscores the high yield and minimal waste characteristics of selective oxygenate reforming, contributing to its environmental benefits and practical implementation.

        The aim of the present work is to develop stable Ni-containing catalysts with resistance to coke deposition and good performance under reforming conditions. The use of Pt inhibits coke deposition and reduces the operation temperature, enhancing the stability of Ni-based catalysts for dry reforming (DRM). Results from the current study provide the first confirmation that the same trends in reforming activity are observed between glycerol and smaller oxygenate molecules in fundamental UHV studies, validating the use of smaller molecule models in optimizing reforming processes.

        Selective oxygenate reforming, leveraging biomass-derived oxygenates like glycerol, efficiently produces hydrogen and CO, offering sustainable and environmentally friendly energy solutions. This method enhances product versatility, resource utilization, and efficiency, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. By aligning with previous findings, it validates the use of smaller molecule models in optimizing reforming processes. Key advantages include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, the potential for fuel cell applications, and compatibility with existing infrastructure, making it a promising alternative to traditional methods.
