        Selective oxygenate reforming plays a pivotal role in sustainable energy and chemical production by optimizing the conversion of oxygenates into valuable products, such as hydrogen and alkanes, while reducing environmental impact and enhancing practical implementation compared to traditional methods. This process leverages the unique properties of bimetallic and supported catalysts, particularly those containing platinum and rhenium, to achieve higher product yields, minimize waste, and tailor the production of specific compounds.

        The utilization of density functional theory (DFT) has significantly advanced our understanding of surface chemical reactions, allowing for the precise prediction of reactivity trends across different metals, alloys, and surface structures. This knowledge is essential for the development of effective catalysts that can enhance the efficiency and sustainability of energy and chemical production processes.

        One notable application is the conversion of biomass-derived glycerol into liquid alkanes suitable for transportation, demonstrating the potential for integrating renewable resources with advanced catalytic technologies. This process combines glycerol conversion with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in a single reactor, effectively utilizing the heat generated by the exothermic reaction to drive the endothermic glycerol reforming reaction. The presence of rhenium in the catalyst significantly boosts the catalytic activity, allowing for the fine-tuning of fuel production under various operational conditions.

        Selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in acrolein through bimetallic surface structures represents another significant advancement, showcasing the ability to selectively produce desired products with minimal environmental impact. This technique offers higher yields and reduced byproduct formation, contributing to more efficient and sustainable energy and chemical production.

        The development of alternative energy sources, particularly hydrogen, is attracting considerable interest due to its potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Selective oxygenate reforming enables the efficient generation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide from biomass-derived oxygenates, making it a more sustainable and cleaner alternative for energy and chemical production. The reforming process can be tuned to produce hydrogen-rich mixtures suitable for fuel cells or coupled with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to yield liquid alkanes compatible with existing infrastructure.

        Methanol reforming with water over supported PtRu catalysts offers a promising solution for hydrogen production, with several benefits including compact and simple equipment, reduced evaporation energy requirements, and improved efficiency. Different oxide supports influence the catalytic activity and selectivity of the reforming process, highlighting the importance of material selection in achieving optimal performance.

        Surface science studies have provided insights into the initial sticking coefficients and saturation first layer coverages of methanol, aiding in the optimization of the reforming process. The maximum amounts decomposed during thermogravimetric analysis (TPD) and the observed reaction products underscore the efficiency of selective oxygenate reforming in converting oxygenates into valuable products.

        The controlled decomposition of methanol on Pt(ll1) surfaces, monitored by electron energy loss spectroscopy, demonstrates the selectivity and effectiveness of this method in generating hydrogen and carbon monoxide, with the ability to maximize yields and minimize waste. The absence of oxygen exchange between methanol and preadsorbed species highlights the method's selectivity, aligning with sustainable practices.

        The coprecipitation of Ni/A1203 catalysts has been found to be an efficient promoter for methanation, increasing methane production per unit metal surface area, especially for catalysts with low nickel loadings. The methanation activity depends on the nickel content and the degree of carbon dioxide adsorption at the reaction temperatures considered, underscoring the importance of catalyst structure and activity.

        Selective oxygenate reforming has emerged as a promising technique for sustainable energy and chemical production, offering higher product yields, reduced environmental impact, and enhanced practical implementation compared to traditional methods. The process involves the conversion of oxygenates into more valuable products through catalytic reactions, enabling the creation of high-quality fuels and chemicals with lower carbon footprints. The coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts are efficient promoters for methanation, increasing methane production per unit nickel surface area, particularly for catalysts with low nickel loadings.

        The reforming reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol illustrate the relationship between reforming activity and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces, providing correlations with recent studies using supported catalysts. The reforming activities of both ethanol and ethylene glycol follow a linear relationship with the d-band center, although with different slopes. Supported catalysts like NiPt, CoPt, and FePt demonstrate increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming, aligning with recent surface science studies and enhancing hydrogen production efficiency.

        The dehydrogenation and decarbonylation of ethylene glycol and ethanol using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) on Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces further elucidate the process's effectiveness in converting oxygenates to hydrogen. The surface monolayer NiPtPt(111) displays the highest reforming activity, compared to Pt(111), subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111), and thick Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, correlating with a closer surface d-band center to the Fermi level.

        The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 reveals the importance of metal composition in achieving optimal performance. The introduction of a small amount of Pt into Ni-based catalysts leads to a decrease in the NiO size, easier reduction, and a uniform distribution of nickel metal particles, enhancing the catalytic behavior and stability.

        The focus on light hydrocarbons CO2-reforming, including dry reforming as an alternative route to convert natural gas into higher-value products, showcases the versatility of selective oxygenate reforming in addressing environmental concerns while promoting sustainable energy production. Controlling reaction kinetics and using appropriate metals and supports can reduce carbon formation, minimizing environmental impact and improving product yields.

        The study of methanol decomposition over ZrO2-supported bimetallic Pt-M nanocatalysts with M = Au, Pd, Ru, Fe further illustrates the influence of secondary metal addition on Pt's oxidation state and activity, highlighting the importance of catalyst design in achieving enhanced catalytic performance and sustainability.

        In summary, selective oxygenate reforming is a transformative process that contributes significantly to sustainable energy and chemical production by providing cleaner, more efficient alternatives to traditional methods. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact, and improved practical implementation, making it a cornerstone in the advancement of sustainable industrial practices.
