        Selective oxygenate reforming significantly contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by converting oxygenates, including methanol, ethanol, and glycerol, into hydrogen and other valuable products. This process offers several key advantages over traditional methods, including higher product yields, minimized environmental impact, and practical implementation. For instance, the use of supported Pt catalysts over TiO2 for methanol reforming showcases the efficiency of this approach. The controlled decomposition of methanol to CO and hydrogen on a Pt(ll1) surface indicates precise control over reaction dynamics and surface reactions, highlighting the process's potential for cleaner energy production.

        Liquid phase reforming with water over supported PtRu catalysts offers a promising solution for hydrogen production, with the advantages of making more compact and simple reaction equipment and eliminating the need for evaporation energy of methanol aqueous solutions. Different oxide supports influence the catalytic activity and selectivity of the reforming process, demonstrating the importance of material selection in achieving optimal performance.

        The coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts are found to be efficient promoters for methanation, with enhanced methane production per unit metal surface area, especially for catalysts with low Ni loadings. This highlights the practical advantages of using less expensive metals like nickel in sustainable chemical production.

        Selective oxygenate reforming enhances the sustainable production of hydrogen by efficiently converting oxygenates into hydrogen-rich products, reducing the need for fossil fuel inputs and minimizing emissions. This cleaner process improves practical implementation and efficiency, making it a more sustainable and cleaner alternative for energy and chemical production.

        Studies on the effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 reveal that a small amount of Pt into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, easier reduction, and a more uniform distribution of nickel metal particles. This demonstrates how catalyst design can be optimized for better performance and efficiency in methane reforming.

        The application of density functional theory (DFT) aids in predicting reactivity trends across metals, alloys, and surfaces, crucial for developing efficient catalysts. This theoretical framework enhances the understanding of catalyst reactivity and guides the development of sustainable energy and chemical production processes.

        The transportation sector's requirements for fuels that burn cleanly and have high energy densities drive the development of alternative sources of transportation fuels, including biomass. Glycerol conversion processes can be combined with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in a single reactor process, allowing for the direct production of liquid alkanes suitable for transportation applications. This showcases the integration of sustainable technologies for efficient and environmentally friendly fuel production.

        Ethanol, as a lower vapor pressure fuel, can be blended with gasoline to reduce emissions and fossil fuel consumption. Ethanol reforming processes have been extensively studied, and the addition of Re to Pt catalysts significantly increases catalytic activity, showing how catalyst modification can enhance the efficiency of ethanol reforming.

        The reforming reactions of ethanol and ethylene glycol illustrate the relationship between reforming activity and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces, providing insights into optimizing catalytic performance. The bimetallic surface structures allow for a higher yield of desired products compared to conventional processes, highlighting the environmental benefits and practical advantages of selective oxygenate reforming.

        The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in acrolein through the architecture of bimetallic surface structures represents a significant advancement, offering higher yields of desired products compared to conventional processes. This technique also has a lower environmental impact, making it ideal for sustainable energy and chemical production.

        Selective oxygenate reforming emerges as a promising technique for sustainable energy and chemical production, with key advantages including higher product yields, reduced environmental impact, and enhanced practical implementation compared to traditional methods. This process involves the conversion of oxygenates such as alcohols and ethers into valuable products through catalytic reactions, enabling the production of high-quality fuels and chemicals with lower carbon footprints.

        The reforming activities of both ethanol and ethylene glycol follow a linear relationship with the d-band center, although with different slopes. For example, in the case of 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, the binding energy on the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structure is generally weaker than that on either parent metal, while the binding energy on the surface 3d-Pt(111) structure is stronger than that on either parent metal. This demonstrates the complex interplay between surface structure and catalytic activity in selective oxygenate reforming.

        The initial sticking coefficient and the saturation first layer coverage of CH3OD are unity and 0.36 ML, respectively. The maximum amounts decomposed in TPD on O/Pt(111) and clean Pt(111) are 0.19 and 0.047 ML, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of surface preparation and catalyst design in achieving optimal catalytic performance.

        Advantages and limitations of using SIMS as a tool for kinetic studies are discussed, providing insights into the practical considerations of employing surface analysis techniques in understanding the dynamics of surface reactions.

        The development of alternative energy sources to fossil fuels is attracting considerable interest for increasing energy supply and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Biomass, being widely available, carbon-neutral, and renewable, can make important contributions to energy supply without increasing CO2 emissions. Through aqueous phase reforming, oxygenates can be further reacted to yield H2 for use in fuel cells. Alternatively, the reforming process can be tuned to produce H2/CO mixtures that can be coupled with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to yield liquid alkanes compatible with existing petroleum transportation and storage infrastructure.

        Results from the current study provide the first confirmation that the same trends in reforming activity are observed between glycerol and smaller oxygenate molecules in fundamental UHV studies, validating the use of smaller molecule models in optimizing reforming processes. An increased reforming yield was observed on Ni-Pt-Pt(111) as compared to those on Pt(111) and Pt-Ni-Pt(111). The reactivity trend of glycerol on these surfaces is similar to previous results for ethylene glycol and ethanol, with an increasing reforming yield as the dband center shifts closer to the Fermi level.

        In summary, selective oxygenate reforming is a critical technique in the realm of sustainable energy and chemical production, offering numerous advantages over traditional methods. This process not only enhances product yields and environmental sustainability but also improves practical implementation through advanced catalyst design and optimized reaction conditions. As highlighted by the referenced studies, the potential for this technology to revolutionize energy and chemical production is significant, positioning it as a cornerstone in the transition towards a more sustainable future.
