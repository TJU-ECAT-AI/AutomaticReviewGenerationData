        Selective oxygenate reforming, a process that utilizes biomass-derived oxygenates like glycerol, efficiently produces hydrogen and carbon monoxide. This sustainable approach decreases reliance on fossil fuels, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions due to its carbon-neutral nature. It enhances product yield by yielding hydrogen suitable for fuel cells and creating liquid alkanes compatible with existing infrastructure through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, serves as a valuable feedstock, promising sustainable energy production. The study validates the use of simpler molecules as models, improving the efficiency and selectivity of the reforming pathway. This method represents a significant contribution to a more sustainable energy system, aligning with the goal of increasing energy supply without increasing CO2 emissions.

        The reactivity trend of glycerol on surfaces is similar to previous results for ethylene glycol and ethanol, with an increasing reforming yield as the dband center shifts closer to the Fermi level. An increased reforming yield was observed on Ni-Pt-Pt(111) as compared to those on Pt(111) and Pt-Ni-Pt(111).

        Selective oxygenate reforming enhances sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting oxygenates, like methanol, into CO and hydrogen, yielding high product concentrations. This process offers significant environmental benefits through the utilization of renewable feedstocks, unlike traditional fossil fuel methods. Advanced techniques, including electron energy loss spectroscopy, aid in understanding reaction dynamics, optimizing industrial applications. The reforming process stops at a specific surface CO concentration, independent of initial coverage, indicating precise control over surface reactions. The use of analytical tools enables real-time monitoring, contributing to the practical implementation and economic viability of this sustainable approach.

        The dehydrogenation and decarbonylation of ethylene glycol and ethanol were studied using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) on Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, as probe reactions for the reforming of oxygenates for the production of H2 for fuel cells. Surfaces prepared by deposition of a monolayer of Ni on Pt(111) at 300 K, designated NiPtPt(111), displayed increased reforming activity compared to Pt(111), subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111), and thick Ni/Pt(111). Reforming activity was correlated with the d-band center of the surfaces and displayed a linear trend for both ethylene glycol and ethanol, with activity increasing as the surface d-band center moved closer to the Fermi level.

        Selective oxygenate reforming optimizes sustainable energy and chemical production through biomass-derived glycerol conversion, offering several advantages over traditional methods. Key benefits include enhanced product yield, direct liquid alkane production suitable for transportation, reduced environmental impact, and practical implementation with cost-effective metal usage. Catalysts, notably those containing rhenium (Re) with platinum (Pt), improve catalytic activity, optimizing the reforming process for specific fuel types. This synergy supports sustainable alternatives, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and contributing to cleaner energy solutions.

        Light hydrocarbons CO2-reforming, due to the use of synthesis gas as feedstock for several chemical processes, including fuel cells, methanol synthesis, and Fischer-Tropsch reactions, significantly contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production. Its advantages include high product yields, reduced environmental impact, and improved operational efficiency compared to traditional methods. The use of Pt to inhibit coke deposition enhances the stability of Ni-based catalysts for direct reforming, reducing carbon formation and increasing the conversion rate of natural gas into higher-value products. This process thus offers a cleaner and more efficient alternative for energy and chemical production, supporting sustainability goals.

        Selective oxygenate reforming has emerged as a promising technique for sustainable energy and chemical production, offering higher product yields, reduced environmental impact, and enhanced practical implementation compared to traditional methods. The process involves the conversion of oxygenates such as alcohols and ethers into more valuable products through catalytic reactions, enabling the production of high-quality fuels and chemicals with lower carbon footprints. Compared to conventional reforming processes, selective oxygenate reforming offers improved selectivity and efficiency, leading to better economic viability.

        The growing interest in fuel cell technologies in heat and power production and as replacements for internal combustion engines increases the demand for hydrogen production. Selective oxygenate reforming enhances sustainable energy and chemical production by converting renewable ethanol into hydrogen, offering higher yields, reduced environmental impact, and compatibility with existing infrastructure for ethanol/gasoline blends. Key advantages include efficient use of renewable resources and lower costs compared to traditional methods. The process is sensitive to sulfur contamination, which can rapidly deactivate catalysts. However, preemptive regeneration through air treatment extends catalyst activity, making the process robust against sulfur-containing fuels.

        The development of an economy based on hydrogen requires major structural changes that could take several decades. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers several key advantages in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation. It enables higher efficiency in converting hydrocarbons to hydrogen-rich products, reduces the need for fossil fuel inputs, and minimizes emissions, making it a more sustainable and cleaner alternative for energy and chemical production.

        The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied. Introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3–0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction, and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles.

        The liquid phase reforming of methanol with water over supported PtRu catalysts offers a promising solution for hydrogen production with several benefits. Different oxide supports (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, MgO, CeO2, ZrO2) influence the catalytic activity and selectivity of the reforming process. This method notably over TiO2 ensures high hydrogen yield. Liquid phase reforming with water minimizes energy consumption, reducing environmental impact. Compact, simple reaction equipment makes this process more practical than traditional methods.

        Selective hydrogenation of acrolein's CO bond via bimetallic surfaces represents a significant advancement over traditional methods due to its ability to selectively hydrogenate the CO bond. The bimetallic surface structures allow for a higher yield of desired products compared to conventional processes. This technique also has a lower environmental impact as it minimizes the formation of unwanted byproducts. Practical implementation of this method can lead to more efficient and sustainable energy and chemical production processes.

        Surface science studies would provide a correlation with recent studies using supported catalysts, which showed that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol as compared to Pt/ γ - Al2O3 at similar conditions. The reforming activities of both ethanol and ethylene glycol follow a linear relationship with the d-band center, although with different slopes. For example, in the case of 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, the binding energy on the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structure is generally weaker than that on either parent metal, while the binding energy on the surface 3d-Pt(111) structure is stronger than that on either parent metal.

        The application of density functional theory to calculate adsorption properties, reac- tion pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions is reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on developing concepts that can be used to understand and predict variations in reactivity from one transition metal to the next or the effects of alloying, surface structure, and adsorbateadsorbate interactions on the reactivity. Most examples discussed are concerned with the catalytic properties of transition metal surfaces, but it is shown that the calculational approach and the concepts developed to understand trends in reactivity for metals can also be used for sulfide and oxide catalysts.

        Selective oxygenate reforming (SOR) stands as a pivotal technique in sustainable energy and chemical production, offering a more efficient, environmentally friendly, and economically viable alternative compared to traditional methods. The process, as elucidated by [10.1073/pnas.0609921104], involves the conversion of oxygenates, such as alcohols and ethers, into more valuable products through catalytic reactions, thereby enabling the production of high-quality fuels and chemicals with significantly lower carbon footprints. This is substantiated by the fact that SOR facilitates the generation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, critical components for sustainable energy solutions, with enhanced selectivity and efficiency, as reported in [10.1002/cssc.200800053] and [10.1016/j.apcatb.2011.05.027].

        The environmental benefits of SOR are profound, as it leverages biomass-derived oxygenates, which are carbon-neutral and renewable, thereby reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. This is exemplified by [10.1016/j.apcatb.2005.10.043], which underscores the potential for SOR to contribute to sustainable energy production by converting methanol into hydrogen, a cleaner fuel source.

        Moreover, SOR's practical advantages are evident in its ability to enhance resource utilization and operational efficiency, as detailed in [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.09.027]. The use of bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing Pt, Ni, and other metals, as explored in [10.1021/ja070264], showcases how SOR can be tailored for optimal performance, leading to higher yields and better environmental outcomes.

        The process of SOR also emphasizes the importance of surface science and catalysis, as highlighted in [10.1016/s0360-0564(02)45013-4] and [10.1016/0926-860x(96)00143-3]. The linear relationship between the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces and oxygenate reforming activity is a testament to the pivotal role of surface properties in achieving efficient and sustainable catalytic conversions.

        The study in [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001] further illustrates how the integration of theoretical calculations, such as density functional theory, with experimental observations can provide deep insights into the mechanisms underlying the enhanced performance of SOR processes. This multidisciplinary approach not only accelerates the development of more efficient catalysts but also paves the way for the optimization of industrial-scale implementations.

        In summary, selective oxygenate reforming offers a robust platform for sustainable energy and chemical production, characterized by its ability to harness the potential of oxygenates, optimize catalytic processes, and minimize environmental impacts. As detailed in the referenced studies, this approach not only addresses the immediate challenges of energy production but also lays the groundwork for future innovations that can further enhance the sustainability and efficiency of industrial practices.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1007/s11144-007-5139-8]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.apcata.2005.10.043], [10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.010], and [10.1016/j.apcata.2008.08.013]. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by optimizing the conversion of hydrocarbons and oxygenates into valuable products. It boasts higher product yields, reduced environmental impact, and enhanced operational flexibility compared to traditional methods.

        The introduction of a small amount of platinum (Pt) into nickel (Ni)-based catalysts improves surface properties and catalytic behavior, leading to better performance in methane reforming. This results in a more effective conversion process with reduced emissions, demonstrating the environmental benefits and practical superiority of selective oxygenate reforming over conventional methods.

        Selective oxygenate reforming efficiently generates hydrogen from methanol, pivotal for hydrogen's potential as a sustainable fuel. Key advantages include high product yield through supported PtRu catalysts, notably over TiO2; minimized energy consumption via liquid phase reforming; and compact, simple equipment facilitating practical implementation. This method outperforms traditional approaches by enhancing sustainability and efficiency in energy and chemical production.

        Methanol decomposition over ZrO2-supported bimetallic Pt-M nanocatalysts (with M = Au, Pd, Ru, Fe) shows the activity of Pt is significantly influenced by the secondary metal, affecting its oxidation state. This process delivers higher product yields, minimizes environmental impact, and improves practical implementation, making it a superior choice compared to conventional techniques.

        Coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts are found to be efficient promoters for methanation. Although Al203 itself is not active in the methanation reaction, it is active for the irreversible adsorption of CO2 at the reaction temperatures considered. Reverse spillover from alumina to nickel increases the methane production per unit metal surface area, especially for coprecipitated catalysts with low Ni loadings.

        The reforming activities of both ethanol and ethylene glycol follow a linear relationship with the d-band center, although with different slopes. This highlights the catalysts' efficiency in promoting methanation, directly related to nickel content and CO2 adsorption levels.

        Selective oxygenate reforming emerges as a promising technique for sustainable energy and chemical production, offering higher yields, reduced environmental impact, and improved practical implementation over traditional methods. By converting oxygenates such as alcohols and ethers into valuable products via catalytic reactions, it enables the creation of high-quality fuels and chemicals with lower carbon footprints.

        The development of alternative energy sources to fossil fuels is attracting considerable interest both for increasing energy supply and for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Through aqueous phase reforming, oxygenates can be further reacted to yield hydrogen for use in fuel cells. Alternatively, the reforming process can be tuned to produce hydrogen/carbon monoxide mixtures that can be coupled with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to yield liquid alkanes compatible with the existing petroleum transportation and storage infrastructure.

        The reactivity trend of glycerol on these surfaces is similar to previous results for ethylene glycol and ethanol, with an increasing reforming yield as the d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. An increased reforming yield was observed on Ni-Pt-Pt(111) as compared to those on Pt(111) and Pt-Ni-Pt(111).

        The surface monolayer NiPtPt(111) displays the highest reforming activity compared to Pt(111), subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111), and thick Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. Reforming activity was correlated with the d-band center of the surfaces and displayed a linear trend for both ethylene glycol and ethanol.

        The application of density functional theory to calculate adsorption properties, reaction pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions is pivotal in understanding and predicting variations in reactivity from one transition metal to the next or the effects of alloying, surface structure, and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions on the reactivity.

        The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing efficiency and minimizing waste, offering higher product yields, reduced environmental impact, and improved practical implementation. Density functional theory (DFT) is pivotal in predicting reactivity trends across metals, alloys, and surface structures, aiding in the development of effective catalysts.

        Future work will study these changes to the precious metal chemistry, focusing on the optimization of catalysts for sustainable energy production and chemical manufacturing. The development of innovative catalysts and processes is crucial for advancing sustainable energy technologies and reducing environmental impacts.
