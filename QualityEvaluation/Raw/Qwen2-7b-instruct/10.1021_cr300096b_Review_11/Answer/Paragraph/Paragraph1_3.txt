        Selective oxygenate reforming, a process that utilizes biomass-derived oxygenates like glycerol, efficiently produces hydrogen and carbon monoxide. This sustainable approach decreases reliance on fossil fuels, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions due to its carbon-neutral nature. It enhances product yield by yielding hydrogen suitable for fuel cells and creating liquid alkanes compatible with existing infrastructure through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, serves as a valuable feedstock, promising sustainable energy production. The study validates the use of simpler molecules as models, improving the efficiency and selectivity of the reforming pathway. This method represents a significant contribution to a more sustainable energy system, aligning with the goal of increasing energy supply without increasing CO2 emissions.

        The reactivity trend of glycerol on surfaces is similar to previous results for ethylene glycol and ethanol, with an increasing reforming yield as the dband center shifts closer to the Fermi level. An increased reforming yield was observed on Ni-Pt-Pt(111) as compared to those on Pt(111) and Pt-Ni-Pt(111).

        Selective oxygenate reforming enhances sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting oxygenates, like methanol, into CO and hydrogen, yielding high product concentrations. This process offers significant environmental benefits through the utilization of renewable feedstocks, unlike traditional fossil fuel methods. Advanced techniques, including electron energy loss spectroscopy, aid in understanding reaction dynamics, optimizing industrial applications. The reforming process stops at a specific surface CO concentration, independent of initial coverage, indicating precise control over surface reactions. The use of analytical tools enables real-time monitoring, contributing to the practical implementation and economic viability of this sustainable approach.

        The dehydrogenation and decarbonylation of ethylene glycol and ethanol were studied using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) on Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, as probe reactions for the reforming of oxygenates for the production of H2 for fuel cells. Surfaces prepared by deposition of a monolayer of Ni on Pt(111) at 300 K, designated NiPtPt(111), displayed increased reforming activity compared to Pt(111), subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111), and thick Ni/Pt(111). Reforming activity was correlated with the d-band center of the surfaces and displayed a linear trend for both ethylene glycol and ethanol, with activity increasing as the surface d-band center moved closer to the Fermi level.

        Selective oxygenate reforming optimizes sustainable energy and chemical production through biomass-derived glycerol conversion, offering several advantages over traditional methods. Key benefits include enhanced product yield, direct liquid alkane production suitable for transportation, reduced environmental impact, and practical implementation with cost-effective metal usage. Catalysts, notably those containing rhenium (Re) with platinum (Pt), improve catalytic activity, optimizing the reforming process for specific fuel types. This synergy supports sustainable alternatives, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and contributing to cleaner energy solutions.

        Light hydrocarbons CO2-reforming, due to the use of synthesis gas as feedstock for several chemical processes, including fuel cells, methanol synthesis, and Fischer-Tropsch reactions, significantly contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production. Its advantages include high product yields, reduced environmental impact, and improved operational efficiency compared to traditional methods. The use of Pt to inhibit coke deposition enhances the stability of Ni-based catalysts for direct reforming, reducing carbon formation and increasing the conversion rate of natural gas into higher-value products. This process thus offers a cleaner and more efficient alternative for energy and chemical production, supporting sustainability goals.

        Selective oxygenate reforming has emerged as a promising technique for sustainable energy and chemical production, offering higher product yields, reduced environmental impact, and enhanced practical implementation compared to traditional methods. The process involves the conversion of oxygenates such as alcohols and ethers into more valuable products through catalytic reactions, enabling the production of high-quality fuels and chemicals with lower carbon footprints. Compared to conventional reforming processes, selective oxygenate reforming offers improved selectivity and efficiency, leading to better economic viability.

        The growing interest in fuel cell technologies in heat and power production and as replacements for internal combustion engines increases the demand for hydrogen production. Selective oxygenate reforming enhances sustainable energy and chemical production by converting renewable ethanol into hydrogen, offering higher yields, reduced environmental impact, and compatibility with existing infrastructure for ethanol/gasoline blends. Key advantages include efficient use of renewable resources and lower costs compared to traditional methods. The process is sensitive to sulfur contamination, which can rapidly deactivate catalysts. However, preemptive regeneration through air treatment extends catalyst activity, making the process robust against sulfur-containing fuels.

        The development of an economy based on hydrogen requires major structural changes that could take several decades. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers several key advantages in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation. It enables higher efficiency in converting hydrocarbons to hydrogen-rich products, reduces the need for fossil fuel inputs, and minimizes emissions, making it a more sustainable and cleaner alternative for energy and chemical production.

        The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied. Introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3–0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction, and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles.

        The liquid phase reforming of methanol with water over supported PtRu catalysts offers a promising solution for hydrogen production with several benefits. Different oxide supports (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, MgO, CeO2, ZrO2) influence the catalytic activity and selectivity of the reforming process. This method notably over TiO2 ensures high hydrogen yield. Liquid phase reforming with water minimizes energy consumption, reducing environmental impact. Compact, simple reaction equipment makes this process more practical than traditional methods.

        Selective hydrogenation of acrolein's CO bond via bimetallic surfaces represents a significant advancement over traditional methods due to its ability to selectively hydrogenate the CO bond. The bimetallic surface structures allow for a higher yield of desired products compared to conventional processes. This technique also has a lower environmental impact as it minimizes the formation of unwanted byproducts. Practical implementation of this method can lead to more efficient and sustainable energy and chemical production processes.

        Surface science studies would provide a correlation with recent studies using supported catalysts, which showed that supported NiPt, CoPt, and FePt display increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol as compared to Pt/ γ - Al2O3 at similar conditions. The reforming activities of both ethanol and ethylene glycol follow a linear relationship with the d-band center, although with different slopes. For example, in the case of 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, the binding energy on the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structure is generally weaker than that on either parent metal, while the binding energy on the surface 3d-Pt(111) structure is stronger than that on either parent metal.

        The application of density functional theory to calculate adsorption properties, reac- tion pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions is reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on developing concepts that can be used to understand and predict variations in reactivity from one transition metal to the next or the effects of alloying, surface structure, and adsorbateadsorbate interactions on the reactivity. Most examples discussed are concerned with the catalytic properties of transition metal surfaces, but it is shown that the calculational approach and the concepts developed to understand trends in reactivity for metals can also be used for sulfide and oxide catalysts.
        
        In the integrative understanding and prospective outlook section, considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of more advanced catalysts that can efficiently utilize a wider range of oxygenates, enhance the selectivity and yield of hydrogen and other valuable products, and optimize the operating conditions for greater efficiency and sustainability. Additionally, there is a need to integrate the latest computational and theoretical tools to better predict and understand the complex reaction mechanisms involved in selective oxygenate reforming. This would enable the design of more effective and environmentally friendly processes for sustainable energy and chemical production.
