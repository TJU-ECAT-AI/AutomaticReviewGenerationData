          "Coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts are found to be efficient promoters for methanation. Although A1203 itself is not active in the methanation reaction, it is active for the irreversible adsorption of CO2 at the reaction temperatures considered. Reverse spillover from alumina to nickel increases the methane production per unit metal surface area especially for coprecipitated catalysts with low Ni loadings."
          "Methana- tion activity is dependent on the nickel content and the degree of CO 2 adsorption at the reaction considered."
          "Although A1203 does not exhibit methanation activity, it is found to be active for CO 2 adsorption."

          "Coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts are found to be efficient promoters for methanation."
          "The structure and activity of coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts is directly related to their metal content. Methanation activity is found to be dependent on the nickel content and on the degree of CO 2 adsorption at the reaction temperatures considered."
