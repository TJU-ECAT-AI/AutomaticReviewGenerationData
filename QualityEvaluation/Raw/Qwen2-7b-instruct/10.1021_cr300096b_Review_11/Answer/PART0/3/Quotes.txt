          [2] "Introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3 – 0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

          [2] "Nickel-based catalysts were found to be active for reforming of ethylene glycol but also displayed decreased hydrogen selectivity due to alkane production."
