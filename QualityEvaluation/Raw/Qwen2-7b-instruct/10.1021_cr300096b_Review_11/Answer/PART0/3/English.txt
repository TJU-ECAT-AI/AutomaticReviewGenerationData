The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting hydrocarbons, such as methane, into valuable chemicals and fuels with minimal waste. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and improved operational efficiency. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming often exhibits better selectivity towards desired products, enhanced stability of catalysts, and lower energy consumption, making it a preferred choice in modern chemical and energy industries.

In the context of selective oxygenate reforming, Pt stands out as a highly effective catalyst. However, the use of nickel-based catalysts, while active for the reforming of ethylene glycol, can lead to reduced hydrogen selectivity due to the formation of alkane byproducts. Bimetallic catalysts, like Ni/Pt, can offer unique properties that are not typically observed in their individual components, and the surface properties of such catalysts can vary depending on the preparation conditions.
