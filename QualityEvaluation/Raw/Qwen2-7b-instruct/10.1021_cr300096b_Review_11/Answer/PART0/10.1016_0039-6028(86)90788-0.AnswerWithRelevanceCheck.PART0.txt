          [1] "The initial sticking coefficient and the saturation first layer coverage of CH3OD are unity and 0.36 ML, respectively."
          [2] "The maximum amounts decomposed in TPD on O/Pt(111) and clean Pt(111) are 0.19 and 0.047 ML, respectively."
          [3] "At low methanol coverages (< 0.05 ML) on O/Pt(111) the only reaction products were CO2, H2O and D2O, whereas at saturation CO, H2O, D2O and H 2 were observed."
          [4] "No oxygen exchange was observed between CH3OD and preadsorbed 180."
          [5] "Advantages and limitations of using SIMS as a tool for kinetic studies are discussed."

          The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting oxygenates, such as methanol, into valuable products like CO2, H2O, and H2, while minimizing waste. Its key advantages include:

          1. **High product yield**: The process maximizes the production of desired chemicals, reducing inefficiencies.
          2. **Environmental benefits**: By minimizing waste and utilizing oxygenates, it reduces the environmental impact compared to traditional methods that might generate more pollutants.
          3. **Practical implementation**: Selective oxygenate reforming can be integrated into existing industrial processes, offering a straightforward transition to cleaner technologies.
