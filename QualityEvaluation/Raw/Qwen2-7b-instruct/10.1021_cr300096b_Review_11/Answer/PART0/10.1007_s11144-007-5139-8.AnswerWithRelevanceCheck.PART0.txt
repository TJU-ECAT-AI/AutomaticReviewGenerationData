          The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting hydrocarbons into valuable products such as hydrogen and syngas, which can be used in various industrial processes. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and enhanced practical implementation through optimized catalysts. The study of Pt/Ni ratio in bimetallic catalysts for methane reforming demonstrates that introducing a small amount of platinum (0.3-0.5 wt.%) can lead to better surface properties and catalytic behavior, specifically by decreasing the NiO size, facilitating its easy reduction, and achieving a uniform distribution of nickel particles.
