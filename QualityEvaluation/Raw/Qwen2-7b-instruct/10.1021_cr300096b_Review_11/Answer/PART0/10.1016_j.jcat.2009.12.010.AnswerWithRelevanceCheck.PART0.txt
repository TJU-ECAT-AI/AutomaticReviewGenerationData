          [1] "Recently, there has been a lot of interest in light hydrocarbons CO2-reforming, due to the use of synthesis gas as feedstock for several chemical processes, i.e. fuel cells, methanol synthesis and FischerTropsch reaction."
          [2] "Furthermore, dry reforming could be an alternative route to convert Natural Gas into products of higher value."
          [3] "Unfortunately, under reforming conditions, Ni catalysts tend to form Ni clusters and unreactive carbon that could block the catalysts pores and encapsulate the active sites, which would lead to quick catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "However, carbon formation can be reduced or suppressed by controlling the reaction kinetically using adequate metals and supports."
          [5] "Moreover, Pt inhibits coke deposition and reduces the operation temperature."
          [6] "From stability tests it can be concluded that Pt enhances the stability of Ni-based catalysts for DRM."
          [7] "The aim of the present work is to develop stable Ni-containing catalysts with resistance to coke deposition and good performance under reforming conditions."
