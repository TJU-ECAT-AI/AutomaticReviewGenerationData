          [1] "The dehydrogenation and decarbonylation of ethylene glycol and ethanol were studied using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) on Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, as probe reactions for the reforming of oxygenates for the production of H2 for fuel cells."
          [2] "Surfaces prepared by deposition of a monolayer of Ni on Pt(111) at 300 K, designated NiPtPt(111), displayed increased reforming activity compared to Pt(111), subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111), and thick Ni/Pt(111)."
          [3] "Reforming activity was correlated with the d-band center of the surfaces and displayed a linear trend for both ethylene glycol and ethanol, with activity increasing as the surface d-band center moved closer to the Fermi level."
          [4] "The surface monolayer NiPtPt(111) displays the highest reforming activity, compared to Pt(111), subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111), and thick Ni/Pt(111) surfaces."

          The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling the efficient conversion of oxygenates into hydrogen, a clean and versatile fuel source. Its key advantages over traditional methods include:

          - Higher product yield: The study found that the surface monolayer NiPtPt(111) displayed the highest reforming activity, indicating that selective reforming processes can achieve higher yields of hydrogen compared to conventional methods.
          - Reduced environmental impact: Hydrogen produced through oxygenate reforming is considered cleaner since it emits fewer pollutants than traditional fossil fuels during combustion.
          - Practical implementation: The ability to use less expensive metals like nickel in the reforming process reduces costs and makes hydrogen production more economically viable.

          [1] "Overall, Pt was identified as the most promising catalyst."
          [2] "Nickel-based catalysts were found to be active for reforming of ethylene glycol but also displayed decreased hydrogen selectivity due to alkane production."
          [3] "Bimetallic catalysts offer one approach to altering the physical and chemical properties of metals, in some cases producing unique catalytic properties not seen for either of the parent metals."
          [4] "The surface morphology of a Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surface depends on the deposition temperature and time."

          In the context of selective oxygenate reforming, Pt stands out as a highly effective catalyst. However, the use of nickel-based catalysts, while active for the reforming of ethylene glycol, can lead to reduced hydrogen selectivity due to the formation of alkane byproducts. Bimetallic catalysts, like Ni/Pt, can offer unique properties that are not typically observed in their individual components, and the surface properties of such catalysts can vary depending on the preparation conditions.
