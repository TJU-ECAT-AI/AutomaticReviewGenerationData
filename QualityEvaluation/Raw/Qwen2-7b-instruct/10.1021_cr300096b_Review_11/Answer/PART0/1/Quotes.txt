"[1] Increasing concerns about the environmental impact of vehicles with gasoline powered combustion engines have increased efforts to find technologies to reduce emissions and reduce fossil fuel consumption."
          "[2] Ethanol has a lower vapor pressure relative to gasoline and therefore ethanol/gasoline blends such as E85 (85% ethanol) or E15 (15% ethanol) are more likely to be available then 100% ethanol within the current infrastructure."

"[1] For energy production, substitution of fossil fuels by H2 is a suitable option for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, in particular CO2.
          [2] The major advantages of using H2 or H2-rich mixtures, i.e. syngas, as fuel include the diversity of primary fuels (natural gas, biomass, crude oil) that can be used in H2 production, its clean combustion and the possibility of long-term storage of the primary fuel.
          [3] The growing interest in fuel cell technologies in heat and power production and as replacements for internal combustion engines increases the demand for H2 production.

          [4] "We note that although the surface was accurately oriented using Laue back reflection,a l/2 miscut is sufficient to leave - 1% steps and defects."
          [5] "The amount of methanol decomposition can be estimated from the intensity of the C-O stretch,since appreciable CO desorption does not occur until the surface temperature is raised above 300 K."

[1] "Recently, there has been a lot of interest in light hydrocarbons CO2-reforming, due to the use of synthesis gas as feedstock for several chemical processes, i.e. fuel cells, methanol synthesis and FischerTropsch reaction."
          [2] "Furthermore, dry reforming could be an alternative route to convert Natural Gas into products of higher value."
          [3] "Unfortunately, under reforming conditions, Ni catalysts tend to form Ni clusters and unreactive carbon that could block the catalysts pores and encapsulate the active sites, which would lead to quick catalyst deactivation."
          [4] "However, carbon formation can be reduced or suppressed by controlling the reaction kinetically using adequate metals and supports."

          "[8] For glycerol conversion over a PtRe/C catalyst with an atomic Pt:Re ratio of 1:1, increasing pressure or decreasing temperature leads to an increase in the production of alkanes and light oxygenated hydrocarbons (ethanol, methanol, propanediols, and acetone) at the expense of CO and CO2."
          "[9] The results of these reaction kinetic studies and characterization studies indicate that the performance of PtRe/C catalysts for glycerol conversion is related to the formation of PtRe nanoparticles, for which Re promotes the overall rate of glycerol reforming by reducing the binding energy of CO to Pt."

          "Different oxide supports (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, MgO, CeO2, ZrO2) influence the catalytic activity and selectivity of the reforming process."

[1] "The application of density functional theory to calculate adsorption properties, reac- tion pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions is reviewed."
          [2] "Particular emphasis is placed on developing concepts that can be used to understand and predict variations in reactivity from one transition metal to the next or the effects of alloying, surface structure, and adsorbateadsorbate interactions on the reactivity."
          [3] "Most examples discussed are concerned with the catalytic properties of transition metal surfaces, but it is shown that the calculational approach and the concepts developed to understand trends in reactivity for metals can also be used for sulfide and oxide catalysts."

          [1] "The initial sticking coefficient and the saturation first layer coverage of CH3OD are unity and 0.36 ML, respectively."
          [2] "The maximum amounts decomposed in TPD on O/Pt(111) and clean Pt(111) are 0.19 and 0.047 ML, respectively."
          [3] "At low methanol coverages (< 0.05 ML) on O/Pt(111) the only reaction products were CO2, H2O and D2O, whereas at saturation CO, H2O, D2O and H 2 were observed."
          [4] "No oxygen exchange was observed between CH3OD and preadsorbed 180."
          [5] "Advantages and limitations of using SIMS as a tool for kinetic studies are discussed."
