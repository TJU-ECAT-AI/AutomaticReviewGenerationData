<quotes>
[1] "Oxidative steam reforming of methane corresponds to an internal heating process that can enhance the energy efficiency of syngas production."
[2] "However, when the feed rate of the reactant gases increases, the catalyst bed temperature increases more remarkably. This increase arises from a problem related to hot-spot formation."
[3] "Nickel is known as an active component of conventional steam reforming catalysts. However, in the presence of oxygen, the Ni species can be oxidized easily and can thereby lose their reforming activity."
[4] "On the other hand, it is difficult to obtain high activity using catalysts with a very small loading quantity."
[5] "For that reason, one promising strategy of catalyst development for oxidative reforming of methane with high resistance to hot-spot formation is the modification of Ni catalysts with a small amount of noble metals, whereby high reforming activity of Ni is realized by the high reducibility of noble metal, even in the presence of oxygen."
[6] "The addition of Pt using sequential impregnation suppresses oxygen accessibility to Ni, which might be related to the higher resistance to oxidation of the Pt/Ni catalyst than that of either Ni or Pt."
[7] "In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the temperature over the catalyst bed inlet is high. However, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst more effectively suppressed the temperature increase than other catalysts, which is explainable by the high reducibility causing the overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting oxygenates like methanol and ethanol into valuable chemicals and fuels. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower energy consumption and fewer emissions, and enhanced practical implementation through improved catalysts and processes.

2. Traditional methods often rely on conventional steam reforming catalysts made of pure nickel. These can easily lose their activity when exposed to oxygen, leading to decreased efficiency. In contrast, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst combines the benefits of platinum and nickel, maintaining high reactivity even in the presence of oxygen. This allows for the overlap of the exothermic combustion and endothermic reforming reaction zones, reducing the temperature gradient and enhancing energy efficiency.

3. The stability of the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst structure for 8 hours during oxidative steam reforming demonstrates its durability and reliability. This stability, combined with its ability to maintain high activity and efficiency, makes it a promising candidate for industrial-scale applications in sustainable chemical production.

1. 选择性氧化物重整通过高效地将甲醇和乙醇等氧化物转化为有价值的化学品和燃料，为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。其关键优势包括更高的产品产量、较低的环境影响（由于更低的能量消耗和更少的排放）以及通过改进催化剂和过程增强的实施便利性。

2. 传统方法往往依赖于纯镍制成的常规蒸汽重整催化剂。这些在暴露于氧气时很容易失去活性，导致效率降低。相比之下，Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂结合了铂和镍的优点，在氧存在下仍能保持高反应性。这允许燃烧和重整反应区的重叠，减少温度梯度并提高能量效率。

3. Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂结构在8小时内保持稳定，这是其耐用性和可靠性的体现。这种稳定性与维持高活性和效率的能力相结合，使其成为大规模工业应用中可持续化学生产的有前景候选者。

[2] "On the other hand, it is difficult to obtain high activity using catalysts with a very small loading quantity."
[3] "However, metallic Ni species can exist; they catalyze the reforming reaction after oxygen is consumed in the catalyst bed. Consequently, the exothermic and the endothermic reaction zones are separate."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing product yield, reducing environmental impact, and improving practical implementation compared to traditional methods. This is due to its ability to selectively convert oxygenates into valuable chemicals, minimizing waste and emissions, and offering more efficient use of resources.

2. Key advantages of selective oxygenate reforming over traditional methods include:
   - **Increased Product Yield**: By selectively converting oxygenates, higher yields of desired products are achieved, optimizing the chemical production process.
   - **Reduced Environmental Impact**: Lower emissions and minimized waste generation lead to a cleaner production process, supporting sustainability goals.
   - **Improved Practical Implementation**: Enhanced selectivity allows for more efficient use of catalysts and process conditions, simplifying operations and reducing costs.

3. The high reducibility of PtNi alloy particles, where Pt atoms are segregated on the surface, enhances the reducibility of Ni drastically, leading to better performance in oxidative steam reforming of methane. This prevents the deep oxidation of Ni, maintaining its active state for both reforming and combustion reactions, thus reducing the temperature gradient in the catalyst bed and improving energy efficiency.
