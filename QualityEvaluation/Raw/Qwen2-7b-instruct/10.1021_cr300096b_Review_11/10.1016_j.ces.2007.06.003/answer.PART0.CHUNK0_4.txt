<EnglishVersionAnswer>
2. The PtNi bimetallic catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation method are formed into PtNi alloy particles, where Pt atoms are segregated on the surface, enhancing the reducibility of Ni drastically.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
2. 通过连续浸渍法制备的PtNi双金属催化剂形成PtNi合金颗粒，其中Pt原子位于表面，大大提高了Ni的还原性。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

3. In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the PtNi bimetallic catalyst more effectively suppressed the temperature increase at the catalyst bed inlet, which is explainable by the high reducibility causing the overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone.
