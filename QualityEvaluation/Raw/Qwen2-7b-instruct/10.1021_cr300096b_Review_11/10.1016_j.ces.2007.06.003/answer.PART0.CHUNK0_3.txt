[1] "Oxidative steam reforming of methane corresponds to an internal heating process that can enhance the energy efficiency of syngas production."
[2] "However, when the feed rate of the reactant gases increases, the catalyst bed temperature increases more remarkably. This increase arises from a problem related to hot-spot formation."
[3] "Our group has reported that the temperature gradient of Pt and Rh is much smaller than that of Ni catalysts in oxidative steam reforming of methane."
[4] "The addition of methane oxygen mixture (through 10) to steam reforming and the effect of methane oxygen mixture removal from oxidative steam reforming on the catalytic performance and the bed temperature profile over monometallic Pt and Ni, and bimetallic PtNi catalysts."
[5] "In contrast, no hysteresis was observed for a PtNi catalyst that was prepared by sequential impregnation method."
[6] "Combined with characterization results obtained using EXAFS analysis and FTIR of CO adsorption, PtNi catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation is formed PtNi alloy particles, where Pt atoms are segregated on the surface, enhances the reducibility of Ni drastically and this is related to the behavior without hysteresis."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing the energy efficiency of syngas production. It allows for an internal heating process that can optimize the use of energy resources, reducing waste and improving overall sustainability. Its key advantages include higher product yields, minimized environmental impact due to efficient resource utilization, and practical implementation through tailored catalyst designs that reduce hot-spot formation, leading to more uniform temperature control and safer operations.

2. The process of selective oxygenate reforming provides several benefits compared to traditional methods. It leads to higher product yields, particularly for desired chemicals, while minimizing the production of unwanted byproducts. Environmental impacts are reduced due to the enhanced efficiency and minimized waste generation. Practically, the use of advanced catalysts, like the PtNi alloy, ensures safe operation and maintains high performance over extended periods, contributing to more reliable and sustainable industrial processes.
