[1] "Nickel is known as an active component of conventional steam reforming catalysts. However, in the presence of oxygen, the Ni species can be oxidized easily and can thereby lose their reforming activity."
[2] "On the other hand, it is difficult to obtain high activity using catalysts with a very small loading quantity."
[3] "For this study, we investigated the effect of added methane oxygen mixture ( ; for through 10) to steam reforming and the effect of methane oxygen mixture removal from oxidative steam reforming on the catalytic performance and the bed temperature profile over monometallic Pt and Ni, and bimetallic PtNi catalysts."
[4] "We also characterized the PtNi bimetallic catalysts using EXAFS and FTIR."
[5] "In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the temperature over the catalyst bed inlet is high. However, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst more effectively suppressed the temperature increase than other catalysts, which is explainable by the high reducibility causing the overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone."
[6] "The bimetallic structure formed on Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) was stable for 8 h during oxidative steam reforming of methane, which is also supported by the similar FTIR spectra of CO adsorption of the fresh and used catalysts."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting oxygenates like methanol and ethanol into valuable chemicals and fuels. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower energy consumption and fewer emissions, and enhanced practical implementation through improved catalysts and processes.

2. Traditional methods often rely on conventional steam reforming catalysts made of pure nickel. These can easily lose their activity when exposed to oxygen, leading to decreased efficiency. In contrast, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst combines the benefits of platinum and nickel, maintaining high reactivity even in the presence of oxygen. This allows for the overlap of the exothermic combustion and endothermic reforming reaction zones, reducing the temperature gradient and enhancing energy efficiency.

3. The stability of the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst structure for 8 hours during oxidative steam reforming demonstrates its durability and reliability. This stability, combined with its ability to maintain high activity and efficiency, makes it a promising candidate for industrial-scale applications in sustainable chemical production.

1. 选择性氧化物重整通过高效地将甲醇和乙醇等氧化物转化为有价值的化学品和燃料，为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。其关键优势包括更高的产品产量、较低的环境影响（由于更低的能量消耗和更少的排放）以及通过改进催化剂和过程增强的实施便利性。

2. 传统方法往往依赖于纯镍制成的常规蒸汽重整催化剂。这些在暴露于氧气时很容易失去活性，导致效率降低。相比之下，Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂结合了铂和镍的优点，在氧存在下仍能保持高反应性。这允许燃烧和重整反应区的重叠，减少温度梯度并提高能量效率。

3. Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6)催化剂结构在8小时内保持稳定，这是其耐用性和可靠性的体现。这种稳定性与维持高活性和效率的能力相结合，使其成为大规模工业应用中可持续化学生产的有前景候选者。
