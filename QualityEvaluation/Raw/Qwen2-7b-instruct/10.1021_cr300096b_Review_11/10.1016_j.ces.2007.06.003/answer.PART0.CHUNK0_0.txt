[1] "Oxidative steam reforming of methane corresponds to an internal heating process that can enhance the energy efficiency of syngas production."
[2] "However, when the feed rate of the reactant gases increases, the catalyst bed temperature increases more remarkably. This increase arises from a problem related to hot-spot formation."
[3] "Nickel is known as an active component of conventional steam reforming catalysts. However, in the presence of oxygen, the Ni species can be oxidized easily and can thereby lose their reforming activity."
[4] "On the other hand, it is difficult to obtain high activity using catalysts with a very small loading quantity."
[5] "For that reason, one promising strategy of catalyst development for oxidative reforming of methane with high resistance to hot-spot formation is the modification of Ni catalysts with a small amount of noble metals, whereby high reforming activity of Ni is realized by the high reducibility of noble metal, even in the presence of oxygen."
[6] "The addition of Pt using sequential impregnation suppresses oxygen accessibility to Ni, which might be related to the higher resistance to oxidation of the Pt/Ni catalyst than that of either Ni or Pt."
[7] "In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the temperature over the catalyst bed inlet is high. However, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst more effectively suppressed the temperature increase than other catalysts, which is explainable by the high reducibility causing the overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone."
