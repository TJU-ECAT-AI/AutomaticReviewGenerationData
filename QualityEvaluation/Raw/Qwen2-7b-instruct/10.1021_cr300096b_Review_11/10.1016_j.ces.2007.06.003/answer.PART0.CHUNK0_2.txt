[1] "Nickel is known as an active component of conventional steam reforming catalysts. However, in the presence of oxygen, the Ni species can be oxidized easily and can thereby lose their reforming activity."
[2] "On the other hand, it is difficult to obtain high activity using catalysts with a very small loading quantity."
[3] "However, metallic Ni species can exist; they catalyze the reforming reaction after oxygen is consumed in the catalyst bed. Consequently, the exothermic and the endothermic reaction zones are separate."
[4] "This behavior is related to the lower oxygen affinity of Rh and Pt than that of Ni."
[5] "The overlap of the combustion reaction zone with the reforming reaction zone is explainable by the small temperature gradient in the catalyst bed."
[6] "The PtNi bimetallic catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation is formed PtNi alloy particles, where Pt atoms are segregated on the surface, enhances the reducibility of Ni drastically and this is related to the behavior without hysteresis."
[7] "No hysteresis was observed for a PtNi catalyst that was prepared by sequential impregnation method."
[8] "These better results might be the result of deep oxidation of Ni during the reaction."
[9] "In oxidative steam reforming of methane, the temperature over the catalyst bed inlet is high. However, the Pt(0.1)/Ni(2.6) catalyst more effectively suppressed the temperature increase than other catalysts, which is explainable by the high reducibility causing the overlap of the exothermic combustion reaction zone with the endothermic reforming reaction zone."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enhancing product yield, reducing environmental impact, and improving practical implementation compared to traditional methods. This is due to its ability to selectively convert oxygenates into valuable chemicals, minimizing waste and emissions, and offering more efficient use of resources.

2. Key advantages of selective oxygenate reforming over traditional methods include:
   - **Increased Product Yield**: By selectively converting oxygenates, higher yields of desired products are achieved, optimizing the chemical production process.
   - **Reduced Environmental Impact**: Lower emissions and minimized waste generation lead to a cleaner production process, supporting sustainability goals.
   - **Improved Practical Implementation**: Enhanced selectivity allows for more efficient use of catalysts and process conditions, simplifying operations and reducing costs.

3. The high reducibility of PtNi alloy particles, where Pt atoms are segregated on the surface, enhances the reducibility of Ni drastically, leading to better performance in oxidative steam reforming of methane. This prevents the deep oxidation of Ni, maintaining its active state for both reforming and combustion reactions, thus reducing the temperature gradient in the catalyst bed and improving energy efficiency.
