<p>The production of large amounts of glycerol is becoming a problem for biodiesel producers because of its economical impact on the manufacturing of biodiesel. Therefore, it is important to look for alternatives that reduce the glycerol surplus and the costs associated with glycerol storage and management.</p>
<p>These problems have thus provoked alternatives directed toward the utilization of the bioglycerol by-product as a raw material to produce value-added products, such as H2. This H2 has a wide variety of industrial applications, including fuel cell technology. Moreover, the use of H2 could help achieve the target established by the European Union for the use of biofuels in the European Union Green Paper [1], which envisioned that 20% of the petrol and diesel used for road transport will be replaced with biofuels by 2020.</p>
<p>Among the catalytic reforming processes, catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) developed by Dumesic and co-workers, presents important advantages in comparison to catalytic steam reforming. These advantages include reduced energy requirements because it is not necessary to vaporize the feed, the produced gas is rich in H2 and poor in CO (the water gas shift reaction (WGS) is favoured at the temperatures and pressures that are employed in the APR process) and the decomposition reactions that take place at high temperatures are minimised.</p>

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by converting glycerol into hydrogen (H2) and other oxygenated hydrocarbons, which can be utilized in various industrial applications, including fuel cells. It addresses the issue of glycerol surplus and reduces the costs associated with its storage and management. The use of H2 produced from this process helps meet the European Union's target for replacing 20% of petrol and diesel used in road transport with biofuels by 2020.

2. The key advantages of selective oxygenate reforming over traditional methods include reduced energy requirements due to the absence of the need to vaporize the feed. The process generates a rich H2 stream with a low CO content, favorable for hydrogen fuel production. Additionally, the selective oxygenate reforming minimizes the occurrence of high-temperature decomposition reactions, enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of the energy conversion process.

1. 选择性氧基重整过程通过将甘油转化为氢气（H2）和其他含氧烃，为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。它解决了甘油过剩的问题，并降低了其存储和管理的成本。从这个过程中产生的氢气有助于满足欧盟到2020年将20%的汽油和柴油用于道路运输中生物燃料的目标。

2. 与传统方法相比，选择性氧基重整的关键优势包括减少能量需求，因为不需要蒸发原料。该过程产生丰富的H2流，CO含量低，有利于氢燃料生产。此外，选择性氧基重整减少了高温分解反应的发生，提高了能源转换过程的效率和可持续性。
