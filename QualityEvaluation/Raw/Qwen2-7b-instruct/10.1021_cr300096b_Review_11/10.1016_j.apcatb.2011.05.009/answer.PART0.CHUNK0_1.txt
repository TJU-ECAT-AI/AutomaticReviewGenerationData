[1] "The most suitable catalysts for ethylene glycol aqueous phase reforming are Pt [9], Raney-Ni modified with Sn [9], [10], [11], and PtPd [12] catalysts."
[2] "However, commercial reforming catalytic systems are typically based on transition metals, especially Ni [13] because of its low cost [14] and wide availability."
[3] "Based on this information, the aim of this work was to study the activity of Ni, Pt and PtNi catalysts supported on bare and La2O3-modified γ-Al2O3 in APR."
[4] "The glycerol aqueous phase reforming was also carried out over Ni catalysts supported on Al2O3 modified with CeO2, MgO, ZrO2 and La2O3 [17]."
[5] "These problems have thus provoked alternatives directed toward the utilization of the bioglycerol by-product as a raw material to produce value-added products, such as H2."
[6] "In addition, the deactivation of the Ni catalysts was also associated with the oxidation of metallic Ni phases in the presence of adsorbed H2O."

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting bio-waste products like glycerol into valuable chemicals and energy carriers such as hydrogen. Its key advantages over traditional methods include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to the use of renewable feedstocks, and practical implementation through the development of efficient catalysts that can operate under milder conditions, thereby minimizing energy requirements and potential waste generation.

2. The advantages of using aqueous phase reforming (APR) over traditional steam reforming include reduced energy requirements, since the feed doesn't need to be vaporized. The process produces a rich hydrogen gas and is less prone to decomposition reactions at high temperatures, making it more environmentally friendly and potentially more economically viable.

3. The primary objective of the research described in this document is to evaluate the activity and stability of different catalysts—specifically, monometallic Ni and Pt, and bimetallic PtNi—supported on γ-Al2O3 and La2O3-modified γ-Al2O3, in the context of glycerol liquid phase conversion through APR. The focus is on understanding how these catalysts perform under varying conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition, to optimize the conversion of glycerol into desired products like hydrogen and oxygenated hydrocarbons.

4. The research also aims to explore the use of Ni catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 modified with other materials like CeO2, MgO, ZrO2, and La2O3 for glycerol reforming, as well as the utilization of bioglycerol as a raw material for producing value-added products like hydrogen, aiming to address issues related to the disposal and economic value of glycerol.

5. The study highlights the challenges associated with the glycerol surplus produced during biodiesel manufacturing, such as its high cost and low demand, which can lead to its devaluation and environmental concerns. The proposed solutions involve converting the glycerol into high-value products like hydrogen, thereby reducing waste and increasing its economic utility.

6. The deactivation of Ni catalysts is attributed to the oxidation of metallic Ni phases in the presence of adsorbed water molecules, which affects their catalytic efficiency and limits their long-term performance in the glycerol reforming process.
