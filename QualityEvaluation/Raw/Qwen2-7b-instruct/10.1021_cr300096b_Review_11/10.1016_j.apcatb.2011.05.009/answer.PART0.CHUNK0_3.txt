[1] "The most suitable catalysts for ethylene glycol aqueous phase reforming are Pt [9], Raney-Ni modified with Sn [9],[10],[11] and PtPd [12] catalysts."
[2] "However, commercial reforming catalytic systems are typically based on transition metals, especially Ni [13] because of its low cost [14] and wide availability."
[3] "Glycerol aqueous phase reforming was also carried out over Ni catalysts supported on Al2O3 modified with CeO2, MgO, ZrO2 and La2O3 [17]."
[4] "Nevertheless, these catalysts were severely deactivated under the reaction conditions for glycerol aqueous phase reforming, resulting in glycerol conversions below 5% after 24 h."
[5] "For this reason, it is important to look for alternatives that reduce the glycerol surplus and the costs associated with glycerol storage and management."
[6] "Moreover, the use of H2 could help achieve the target established by the European Union for the use of biofuels in the European Union Green Paper [1], which envisioned that 20% of the petrol and diesel used for road transport will be replaced with biofuels by 2020."
[7] "The presence of La2O3 on the PtNi/γ-AM catalyst was observed to improve the capacity of this bimetallic catalyst to transform more glycerol into gas and liquid products than the PtNi/γ-A catalyst at 513 K."
[8] "In the particular case of the Ni catalysts, the deactivation did not seem to be related to the amount of carbonaceous deposits, because they produced lower amount of coke than Pt catalysts under the same conditions."
[9] "The activity decrease of the Ni catalysts was probably due to the catalysts undergoing changes to its properties after use in the reaction."
[10] "In addition, the filamentous coke was not harmful to the catalysts [69]."

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by converting renewable resources, such as glycerol, into valuable products like hydrogen and oxygenated hydrocarbons. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower carbon emissions, and more practical implementation compared to traditional methods, which often rely on fossil fuels.

2. The process allows for the efficient conversion of glycerol into hydrogen and oxygenated hydrocarbons, which can be used in various applications. It reduces the reliance on fossil fuels and the associated environmental issues, aligning with the European Union's goals for sustainable energy use and biofuel integration.

3. The bimetallic catalysts, particularly PtNi/γ-AM, show superior performance in terms of glycerol conversion and selectivity towards oxygenated hydrocarbons. This is attributed to the synergistic effect between the two metals, Pt and Ni, which leads to lower dispersion of metallic species, formation of metal alloys, and hydrogen spill-over, enhancing reactivity and stability.

4. The deactivation of Ni catalysts during the glycerol reforming process is primarily due to changes in the catalyst's properties after prolonged exposure to the reaction conditions, rather than the amount of carbonaceous deposits formed. This suggests that the catalyst's active sites undergo structural modifications that affect its performance.

5. Filamentous coke, a type of carbon deposit, does not pose a significant threat to the performance of the catalysts. It can migrate and accumulate on the metal-support interface, potentially affecting the catalyst's efficiency, but it does not completely deactivate the catalysts. The catalysts continue to operate effectively after the initial phase of reaction, indicating that the coke does not permanently impair their functionality.

1. 选择性氧化重整过程通过将可再生资源如甘油转化为有价值的产物，如氢气和氧化烃，为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。其关键优势包括更高的产品产率、较低的环境影响（由于碳排放减少），以及与传统方法相比更实际的实施，后者通常依赖于化石燃料。

2. 该过程允许高效地将甘油转化为氢气和氧化烃，从而在各种应用中使用。它减少了对化石燃料的依赖及其相关的环境问题，并与欧盟制定的可持续能源使用和生物燃料整合目标相一致。

3. PtNi/γ-AM这种双金属催化剂表现出优越的性能，在513K条件下能更有效地转化更多甘油为气体和液体产品。这归因于两种金属Pt和Ni之间的协同效应，导致金属物种分散度降低，形成金属合金，以及氢气溢出，增强活性和稳定性。

4. Ni催化剂在甘油重整过程中失效的主要原因在于催化剂在长期反应条件下的性质变化，而非形成的碳沉积物的数量。这表明催化剂的活性中心经历了结构变化，影响了其性能。

5. 纤维状焦炭，一种碳沉积物，对催化剂的性能影响不大。它可能会迁移到金属-支撑界面积累，可能会影响催化剂的效率，但不会完全使催化剂失活。催化剂在反应初期阶段后继续有效运行，表明焦炭不会永久损害其功能。
