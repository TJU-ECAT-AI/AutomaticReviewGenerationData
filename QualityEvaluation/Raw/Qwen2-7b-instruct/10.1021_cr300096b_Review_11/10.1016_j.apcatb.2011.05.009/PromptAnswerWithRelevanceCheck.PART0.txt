<p>These problems have thus provoked alternatives directed toward the utilization of the bioglycerol by-product as a raw material to produce value-added products, such as H2. This H2 has a wide variety of industrial applications, including fuel cell technology. Moreover, the use of H2 could help achieve the target established by the European Union for the use of biofuels in the European Union Green Paper [1], which envisioned that 20% of the petrol and diesel used for road transport will be replaced with biofuels by 2020.</p>
<p>Among the catalytic reforming processes, catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) developed by Dumesic and co-workers, presents important advantages in comparison to catalytic steam reforming. These advantages include reduced energy requirements because it is not necessary to vaporize the feed, the produced gas is rich in H2 and poor in CO (the water gas shift reaction (WGS) is favoured at the temperatures and pressures that are employed in the APR process) and the decomposition reactions that take place at high temperatures are minimised [9].</p>
<p>The most suitable catalysts for ethylene glycol aqueous phase reforming are Pt [9], Raney-Ni modified with Sn [9], [10], [11], and PtPd [12] catalysts. However, commercial reforming catalytic systems are typically based on transition metals, especially Ni [13] because of its low cost [14] and wide availability. In addition, as it was concluded in a previous work [15], [16], Ni catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 modified with different La2O3 loadings, especially intermediate loadings, and with the incorporation of Pt to Ni based catalysts improved the Ni/Al2O3 capacity for producing only gas products (mainly H2 and CO2) due to steam reforming of intermediate oxygenated hydrocarbons.</p>

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by converting bioglycerol into hydrogen and other valuable products. It aims to reduce the environmental impact of traditional energy production methods, improve product yields, and offer practical solutions for bioenergy utilization. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers advantages in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation due to its ability to efficiently convert bioglycerol into hydrogen, which can be utilized in various industries, including fuel cell technology. This process aligns with the European Union's targets for biofuel usage, aiming to replace 20% of petrol and diesel with biofuels by 2020.

2. Catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) offers several benefits over traditional catalytic steam reforming. APR reduces energy requirements as it doesn't necessitate vaporizing the feed, produces a gas rich in hydrogen with minimal carbon monoxide, and favors the water gas shift reaction at the preferred temperatures and pressures. Suitable catalysts for ethylene glycol aqueous phase reforming include platinum, Raney-Ni modified with tin, and platinum-palladium. Commercial systems often rely on transition metals, particularly nickel, due to its low cost and widespread availability. Previous studies have shown that incorporating palladium into nickel-based catalysts on gamma-alumina supports, especially those modified with intermediate levels of lanthanum oxide, can enhance the catalyst's capacity to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide through the steam reforming of intermediate oxygenated hydrocarbons.

1. 选择性氧基重整过程通过将生物甘油转化为氢和其他有价值的产品，为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。它旨在减少传统能源生产方法对环境的影响、提高产品产量，并提供生物能源利用的实用解决方案。与传统方法相比，选择性氧基重整过程在产品产量、环境影响和实施可行性方面提供了优势，因为它能够高效地将生物甘油转化为可用于多个行业（包括燃料电池技术）的氢气。这一过程符合欧盟对于生物燃料使用的目标，计划到2020年将20%的汽油和柴油替换为生物燃料。

2. 水相催化重整（APR）相对于传统的蒸汽重整过程具有多个优势。APR减少了能量需求，因为无需蒸发进料，产生的气体富含氢气且碳氧化物含量低，水煤气变换反应在所采用的温度和压力下得到促进。适合乙二醇水相重整的催化剂包括铂、锡改性的Raney镍以及铂钯。商业系统通常依赖过渡金属，尤其是镍，因其成本低廉且广泛应用。先前的研究表明，将钯纳入镍基催化剂上由γ-氧化铝支持，并通过中间负载镧氧化物修饰，特别是那些通过引入钯来增强镍/氧化铝体系产生仅含氢气和二氧化碳的能力，这是通过蒸汽重整中间氧基化合物实现的。

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting bio-waste products like glycerol into valuable chemicals and energy carriers such as hydrogen. Its key advantages over traditional methods include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to the use of renewable feedstocks, and practical implementation through the development of efficient catalysts that can operate under milder conditions, thereby minimizing energy requirements and potential waste generation.

2. The advantages of using aqueous phase reforming (APR) over traditional steam reforming include reduced energy requirements, since the feed doesn't need to be vaporized. The process produces a rich hydrogen gas and is less prone to decomposition reactions at high temperatures, making it more environmentally friendly and potentially more economically viable.

3. The primary objective of the research described in this document is to evaluate the activity and stability of different catalysts—specifically, monometallic Ni and Pt, and bimetallic PtNi—supported on γ-Al2O3 and La2O3-modified γ-Al2O3, in the context of glycerol liquid phase conversion through APR. The focus is on understanding how these catalysts perform under varying conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition, to optimize the conversion of glycerol into desired products like hydrogen and oxygenated hydrocarbons.

4. The research also aims to explore the use of Ni catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 modified with other materials like CeO2, MgO, ZrO2, and La2O3 for glycerol reforming, as well as the utilization of bioglycerol as a raw material for producing value-added products like hydrogen, aiming to address issues related to the disposal and economic value of glycerol.

5. The study highlights the challenges associated with the glycerol surplus produced during biodiesel manufacturing, such as its high cost and low demand, which can lead to its devaluation and environmental concerns. The proposed solutions involve converting the glycerol into high-value products like hydrogen, thereby reducing waste and increasing its economic utility.

6. The deactivation of Ni catalysts is attributed to the oxidation of metallic Ni phases in the presence of adsorbed water molecules, which affects their catalytic efficiency and limits their long-term performance in the glycerol reforming process.

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by converting renewable resources, such as glycerol, into valuable products like hydrogen and oxygenated hydrocarbons. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower carbon emissions, and more practical implementation compared to traditional methods, which often rely on fossil fuels.

2. The process allows for the efficient conversion of glycerol into hydrogen and oxygenated hydrocarbons, which can be used in various applications. It reduces the reliance on fossil fuels and the associated environmental issues, aligning with the European Union's goals for sustainable energy use and biofuel integration.

3. The bimetallic catalysts, particularly PtNi/γ-AM, show superior performance in terms of glycerol conversion and selectivity towards oxygenated hydrocarbons. This is attributed to the synergistic effect between the two metals, Pt and Ni, which leads to lower dispersion of metallic species, formation of metal alloys, and hydrogen spill-over, enhancing reactivity and stability.

4. The deactivation of Ni catalysts during the glycerol reforming process is primarily due to changes in the catalyst's properties after prolonged exposure to the reaction conditions, rather than the amount of carbonaceous deposits formed. This suggests that the catalyst's active sites undergo structural modifications that affect its performance.

5. Filamentous coke, a type of carbon deposit, does not pose a significant threat to the performance of the catalysts. It can migrate and accumulate on the metal-support interface, potentially affecting the catalyst's efficiency, but it does not completely deactivate the catalysts. The catalysts continue to operate effectively after the initial phase of reaction, indicating that the coke does not permanently impair their functionality.

2. 该过程允许高效地将甘油转化为氢气和氧化烃，从而在各种应用中使用。它减少了对化石燃料的依赖及其相关的环境问题，并与欧盟制定的可持续能源使用和生物燃料整合目标相一致。

3. PtNi/γ-AM这种双金属催化剂表现出优越的性能，在513K条件下能更有效地转化更多甘油为气体和液体产品。这归因于两种金属Pt和Ni之间的协同效应，导致金属物种分散度降低，形成金属合金，以及氢气溢出，增强活性和稳定性。

4. Ni催化剂在甘油重整过程中失效的主要原因在于催化剂在长期反应条件下的性质变化，而非形成的碳沉积物的数量。这表明催化剂的活性中心经历了结构变化，影响了其性能。

5. 纤维状焦炭，一种碳沉积物，对催化剂的性能影响不大。它可能会迁移到金属-支撑界面积累，可能会影响催化剂的效率，但不会完全使催化剂失活。催化剂在反应初期阶段后继续有效运行，表明焦炭不会永久损害其功能。
