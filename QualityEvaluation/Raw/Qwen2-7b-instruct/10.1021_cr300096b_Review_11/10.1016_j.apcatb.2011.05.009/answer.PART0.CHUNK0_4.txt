The most suitable catalysts for ethylene glycol aqueous phase reforming are Pt [9], Raney-Ni modified with Sn [9], [10], [11], and PtPd [12] catalysts. However, commercial reforming catalytic systems are typically based on transition metals, especially Ni [13] because of its low cost [14] and wide availability.

The presence of La2O3 on the PtNi/γ-AM catalyst was observed to improve the capacity of this bimetallic catalyst to transform more glycerol into gas and liquid products than the PtNi/γ-A catalyst at 513 K. The La2O3 addition also improved the H2 yield obtained.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
4. Incorporating La2O3 into the PtNi/γ-AM catalyst enhanced its capability to convert more glycerol into both gas and liquid products compared to the PtNi/γ-A catalyst at 513 K. This improvement was also reflected in a higher hydrogen yield.

The results derived from the TPO analysis indicated that carbonaceous species were generated during glycerol liquid conversion. Moreover, it seemed that this species were deposited as a layer on the active metallic phases of the catalysts, partially blocking the active centres. This blocking effect could have produced the rapid deactivation observed for the Pt, Ni and PtNi catalysts during the first 8 h of reaction at 498 K and 513 K.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
5. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TPO) results revealed that carbonaceous materials were produced during the glycerol liquid conversion process. It appeared that these materials accumulated as a layer on the active metallic components of the catalysts, partially obstructing the active sites, which led to the rapid catalyst deactivation observed in the first 8 hours of reaction at 498 K and 513 K.

5. 热重分析(TPO)结果显示，在甘油液相转化过程中产生了碳质材料。看来这些材料以一层的形式沉积在催化剂的活性金属成分上，部分阻塞了活性位点，导致在498 K和513 K下前8小时反应期间观察到的催化剂快速失活。

<quotes>
The activity of the catalysts remained steady over the last 10 h of reaction, however, indicating that the influence of the carbonaceous deposits on the activity of the catalysts waned. In this sense, it is likely that coke produced during first reaction hours was formed in the metallic centres and then migrated to metal-support interface, where the filamentous coke was generated.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
6. Yet, the catalyst activity stabilized over the final 10 hours of the reaction, suggesting that the impact of the carbon deposits diminished. In essence, the coke produced in the initial reaction period was likely formed within the metal centers and subsequently moved to the metal-support interface, where filamentous coke emerged.

6. 然而，催化剂活性在最后10小时的反应中保持稳定，表明碳沉积对催化剂活性的影响减弱。本质上，初期反应产生的焦炭可能在金属中心形成，并随后迁移到金属支撑界面，在那里形成了纤维状焦炭。
