<p>These problems have thus provoked alternatives directed toward the utilization of the bioglycerol by-product as a raw material to produce value-added products, such as H2. This H2 has a wide variety of industrial applications, including fuel cell technology. Moreover, the use of H2 could help achieve the target established by the European Union for the use of biofuels in the European Union Green Paper [1], which envisioned that 20% of the petrol and diesel used for road transport will be replaced with biofuels by 2020.</p>
<p>Among the catalytic reforming processes, catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) developed by Dumesic and co-workers, presents important advantages in comparison to catalytic steam reforming. These advantages include reduced energy requirements because it is not necessary to vaporize the feed, the produced gas is rich in H2 and poor in CO (the water gas shift reaction (WGS) is favoured at the temperatures and pressures that are employed in the APR process) and the decomposition reactions that take place at high temperatures are minimised [9].</p>
<p>The most suitable catalysts for ethylene glycol aqueous phase reforming are Pt [9], Raney-Ni modified with Sn [9], [10], [11], and PtPd [12] catalysts. However, commercial reforming catalytic systems are typically based on transition metals, especially Ni [13] because of its low cost [14] and wide availability. In addition, as it was concluded in a previous work [15], [16], Ni catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 modified with different La2O3 loadings, especially intermediate loadings, and with the incorporation of Pt to Ni based catalysts improved the Ni/Al2O3 capacity for producing only gas products (mainly H2 and CO2) due to steam reforming of intermediate oxygenated hydrocarbons.</p>

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by converting bioglycerol into hydrogen and other valuable products. It aims to reduce the environmental impact of traditional energy production methods, improve product yields, and offer practical solutions for bioenergy utilization. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming offers advantages in terms of product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation due to its ability to efficiently convert bioglycerol into hydrogen, which can be utilized in various industries, including fuel cell technology. This process aligns with the European Union's targets for biofuel usage, aiming to replace 20% of petrol and diesel with biofuels by 2020.

2. Catalytic aqueous phase reforming (APR) offers several benefits over traditional catalytic steam reforming. APR reduces energy requirements as it doesn't necessitate vaporizing the feed, produces a gas rich in hydrogen with minimal carbon monoxide, and favors the water gas shift reaction at the preferred temperatures and pressures. Suitable catalysts for ethylene glycol aqueous phase reforming include platinum, Raney-Ni modified with tin, and platinum-palladium. Commercial systems often rely on transition metals, particularly nickel, due to its low cost and widespread availability. Previous studies have shown that incorporating palladium into nickel-based catalysts on gamma-alumina supports, especially those modified with intermediate levels of lanthanum oxide, can enhance the catalyst's capacity to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide through the steam reforming of intermediate oxygenated hydrocarbons.

1. 选择性氧基重整过程通过将生物甘油转化为氢和其他有价值的产品，为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。它旨在减少传统能源生产方法对环境的影响、提高产品产量，并提供生物能源利用的实用解决方案。与传统方法相比，选择性氧基重整过程在产品产量、环境影响和实施可行性方面提供了优势，因为它能够高效地将生物甘油转化为可用于多个行业（包括燃料电池技术）的氢气。这一过程符合欧盟对于生物燃料使用的目标，计划到2020年将20%的汽油和柴油替换为生物燃料。

2. 水相催化重整（APR）相对于传统的蒸汽重整过程具有多个优势。APR减少了能量需求，因为无需蒸发进料，产生的气体富含氢气且碳氧化物含量低，水煤气变换反应在所采用的温度和压力下得到促进。适合乙二醇水相重整的催化剂包括铂、锡改性的Raney镍以及铂钯。商业系统通常依赖过渡金属，尤其是镍，因其成本低廉且广泛应用。先前的研究表明，将钯纳入镍基催化剂上由γ-氧化铝支持，并通过中间负载镧氧化物修饰，特别是那些通过引入钯来增强镍/氧化铝体系产生仅含氢气和二氧化碳的能力，这是通过蒸汽重整中间氧基化合物实现的。
