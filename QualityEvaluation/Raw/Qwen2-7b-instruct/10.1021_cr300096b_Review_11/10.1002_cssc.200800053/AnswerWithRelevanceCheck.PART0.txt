          [1] "The development of alternative energy sources to fossil fuels is attracting considerable interest both for increasing energy supply and for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions."
          [2] "It has been argued that biomass is widely available, carbon-neutral, and renewable, and can therefore make important contributions to energy supply without increasing CO2 emissions."
          [3] "Through aqueous phase reforming,1 the oxygenates can be further reacted to yield H2 for use in fuel cells."
          [4] "Alternatively, the reforming process can be tuned to produce H2/CO mixtures that can be coupled with FischerTropsch synthesis to yield liquid alkanes compatible with the existing petroleum transportation and storage infrastructure."
          [5] "Results from the current study provide the first confirmation that the same trends in reforming activity are observed between glycerol and smaller oxygenate molecules in fundamental UHV studies, validating the use of smaller molecule models."
          [6] "An increased reforming yield was observed on Ni-Pt-Pt(111) as compared to those on Pt(111) and Pt-Ni-Pt(111)."
          [7] "The reactivity trend of glycerol on these surfaces is similar to previous results for ethylene glycol and ethanol, with an increasing reforming yield as the dband center shifts closer to the Fermi level."

          The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing biomass-derived oxygenates, such as glycerol, to produce hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) efficiently. This method offers several key advantages over traditional methods:

          1. **Environmental Impact**: Biomass is carbon-neutral and renewable, making it an environmentally friendly resource. By harnessing the energy contained in biomass-derived oxygenates, the process reduces reliance on fossil fuels, thereby decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.

          2. **Product Yield**: Oxygenate reforming can yield hydrogen suitable for fuel cells, which is crucial for the transition towards cleaner energy solutions. Moreover, by tuning the reforming process to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide mixtures, these gases can be utilized in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to create liquid alkanes compatible with existing petroleum infrastructure, enhancing the versatility and compatibility of renewable energy sources.

          3. **Resource Utilization**: Glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, becomes a valuable feedstock for oxygenate reforming. As biodiesel production is expected to increase, the availability of glycerol could rise, providing a sustainable source for energy production and chemical synthesis.

          4. **Efficiency and Selectivity**: The study demonstrates that the reforming activity trends for glycerol align with those of smaller oxygenates, validating the use of simpler molecules as models. This insight not only enhances our understanding of the chemical processes involved but also improves the efficiency and selectivity of the reforming pathway, ensuring optimal production of desired products.

          In summary, selective oxygenate reforming offers a sustainable, efficient, and environmentally friendly method for generating hydrogen and other valuable chemicals, significantly contributing to the transition towards a more sustainable energy system.

          1. **环境影响**：生物质是无碳、可再生的，因此是一个环保资源。通过利用生物质衍生氧化物的能量，这一过程减少了对化石燃料的依赖，从而减少了温室气体排放。

          2. **产品产量**：氧化物重整可以产生适用于燃料电池的氢气，这对于向更清洁的能源解决方案过渡至关重要。此外，通过调整重整过程以产生氢气和一氧化碳混合物，这些气体可以用于费歇尔-特罗普希合成来制造与现有石油运输和储存基础设施兼容的液态烷烃，从而提高了可再生能源源的灵活性和兼容性。

          3. **资源利用**：作为生物柴油生产副产品的甘油成为有价值的供体分子。随着生物柴油生产量的预期增加，甘油的可用性可能会提高，为能源生产和化学合成提供了一种可持续的来源。

          4. **效率和选择性**：研究表明，甘油的重整活动趋势与较小氧化物的趋势一致，验证了使用简单分子作为模型的有效性。这一见解不仅增强了我们对化学过程的理解，而且提高了重整途径的效率和选择性，确保了最佳生产所需产品。

          综上所述，选择性氧化物重整提供了一种可持续、高效且环保的方法来生成氢气和其他有价值的化学品，显著推动了向更加可持续能源系统的转变。
