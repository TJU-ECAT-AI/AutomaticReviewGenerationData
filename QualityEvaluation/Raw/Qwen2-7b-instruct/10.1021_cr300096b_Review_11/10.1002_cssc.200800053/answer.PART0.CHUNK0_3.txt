[1] "The development of alternative energy sources to fossil fuels is attracting considerable interest both for increasing energy supply and for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions."
[2] "It has been argued that biomass is widely available, carbon-neutral, and renewable, and can therefore make important contributions to energy supply without increasing CO2 emissions."
[3] "Through aqueous phase reforming,1 the oxygenates can be further reacted to yield H2 for use in fuel cells."
[4] "Alternatively, the reforming process can be tuned to produce H2/CO mixtures that can be coupled with FischerTropsch synthesis to yield liquid alkanes compatible with the existing petroleum transportation and storage infrastructure."
[5] "Glycerol has attracted recent attention as a feed molecule for these processes1,46 and is particularly interesting because as a by-product of the transesterification of plant oils and animal fats its availability could potentially increase with the expected increase in biodiesel production."
[6] "The reactivity trend of glycerol on these surfaces is similar to previous results for ethylene glycol and ethanol, with an increasing reforming yield as the dband center shifts closer to the Fermi level."
[7] "Reforming was the primary reaction pathway on all surfaces, with selectivities of 5090%."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing biomass-derived oxygenates, such as glycerol, which are carbon-neutral and renewable resources. This method increases energy supply without causing additional CO2 emissions. Oxygenates can be further reacted to yield hydrogen (H2) suitable for fuel cells, or H2/CO mixtures can be produced to be used in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis for liquid alkanes compatible with existing petroleum infrastructure. The use of glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, as a feedstock for these processes enhances sustainability. The reactivity trend of glycerol on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, with an increasing reforming yield as the surface dband center approaches the Fermi level, indicates efficient catalyst design for oxygenate reforming. This process offers high selectivity (50-90%) for reforming reactions, contributing to environmentally friendly and economically viable energy solutions.

选择性氧化物重整过程通过利用生物质衍生的氧化合物，如甘油，这些是无碳、可再生的资源，为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。这种方法增加了能源供应，而不会导致额外的二氧化碳排放。氧化合物可以通过进一步反应产生用于燃料电池的氢（H2），或者可以产生H2/CO混合物以用于与现有石油运输和存储基础设施兼容的费希尔-特罗普斯合成液烷烃。将甘油作为生物柴油生产的副产品用作这些过程的原料，增强了可持续性。在基于Pt的双金属表面使用甘油，随着表面dband中心接近费米能级，重整产率增加，表明设计出高效的催化剂以进行氧化合物重整。该过程提供了高达50-90%的重整反应选择性，为环境友好和经济可行的能源解决方案做出了贡献。
