[1] "The development of alternative energy sources to fossil fuels is attracting considerable interest both for increasing energy supply and for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions."
[2] "It has been argued that biomass is widely available, carbon-neutral, and renewable, and can therefore make important contributions to energy supply without increasing CO2 emissions."
[3] "Through aqueous phase reforming,1 the oxygenates can be further reacted to yield H2 for use in fuel cells."
[4] "Alternatively, the reforming process can be tuned to produce H2/CO mixtures that can be coupled with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to yield liquid alkanes compatible with the existing petroleum transportation and storage infrastructure."
[5] "Results from the current study provide the first confirmation that the same trends in reforming activity are observed between glycerol and smaller oxygenate molecules in fundamental UHV studies, validating the use of smaller molecule models."
[6] "The reforming yield is defined as the number of oxygenate molecules that are decomposed by the reforming pathway."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by providing an alternative method to generate hydrogen and hydrocarbons from biomass-derived oxygenates, such as glycerol. This approach offers several key advantages over traditional methods:

1. **Product Yield**: Selective oxygenate reforming allows for the efficient conversion of oxygenates into hydrogen and other useful chemicals. In the study, glycerol was found to react selectively on Pt-based surfaces to form hydrogen and carbon monoxide, with increased reforming yields observed on certain bimetallic surfaces compared to others.

2. **Environmental Impact**: By utilizing biomass as a feedstock, the process reduces reliance on non-renewable resources and decreases greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with sustainability goals. The carbon-neutral nature of biomass ensures that the energy produced does not contribute to net CO2 emissions.

3. **Practical Implementation**: The ability to tune the reforming process to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide mixtures that can be further processed into liquid alkanes compatible with existing infrastructure makes this method highly practical for integration into current energy systems. This compatibility facilitates the transition towards cleaner energy sources without requiring extensive modifications to existing infrastructure.

In summary, selective oxygenate reforming offers a sustainable and efficient method for generating hydrogen and hydrocarbons, contributing positively to energy supply and environmental conservation.

选择性氧化合物重整过程通过提供从生物质衍生的氧化合物（如甘油）生成氢气和其他有用化学品的替代方法，对可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。这种方法在以下方面优于传统方法：

1. **产品产量**：选择性氧化合物重整允许从氧化合物高效地转化为氢气和其他有用化学品。研究表明，甘油可以在铂基表面上选择性地反应形成氢气和一氧化碳，在某些双金属表面的改性下，观察到了与纯铂表面相比更高的重整产率。

2. **环境影响**：通过利用生物质作为原料，该过程减少了对不可再生资源的依赖，并减少了温室气体排放，符合可持续发展目标。由于生物质是碳中性的，因此产生的能量不会导致净二氧化碳排放。

3. **实施可行性**：能够调节重整过程以产生可以进一步加工成与现有基础设施兼容的液态烷烃的氢气和一氧化碳混合物，使这种方法高度可行，用于集成到当前能源系统中。这种兼容性使得向更清洁的能源来源过渡无需对现有基础设施进行重大修改。

综上所述，选择性氧化合物重整提供了一种可持续且高效的生成氢气和碳氢化合物的方法，对能源供应和环境保护产生了积极影响。
