The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling the efficient conversion of oxygen-containing compounds, such as methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol, into hydrogen. This method offers several key advantages compared to traditional methods:

1. **Sustainable Energy Production**: Oxygenate reforming utilizes renewable biomass-derived oxygenates, which can be produced through biological processes. When combined with hydrogen production, this process can be CO2-neutral, as the CO2 by-product can be captured and utilized in future biomass growth cycles, thus contributing to a circular economy and reducing carbon emissions.

2. **Environmental Impact**: Oxygenates are known for their low toxicity and reactivity, which makes them safer and more compatible with existing transportation and storage infrastructure. This reduces the environmental risks associated with hydrogen production, transport, and storage.

3. **Product Yield and Efficiency**: The document highlights that the use of bimetallic surfaces, specifically those with a surface monolayer of transition metals like nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), or titanium (Ti) on platinum (Pt), can enhance the reforming activity and selectivity of oxygenates. For instance, the surface NiPtPt(1 1 1) displays increased activity for reforming ethanol and ethylene glycol compared to the corresponding subsurface structures. This indicates improved efficiency in the production of hydrogen and the conversion of oxygenates.

4. **Practical Implementation**: The use of 3d-Pt bimetallic surfaces, particularly those with Ni, Fe, or Ti, as the 3d metal, may be potential catalysts for reforming oxygenates. These catalysts offer a viable alternative to traditional methods, potentially reducing costs and improving performance in industrial applications.

5. **Selectivity and Reaction Products**: The reforming selectivity of oxygenates, especially ethanol, decreases as the surface d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level. This suggests that catalysts optimized for specific d-band centers can improve the selectivity of desired reaction products, such as hydrogen, over byproducts like carbon and oxygen.

6. **Theoretical and Practical Correlation**: The document establishes a correlation between the reforming activity and the surface d-band center, indicating that the electronic properties of the catalyst surface play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of oxygenate reforming. This provides a theoretical basis for the design of catalysts that can optimize hydrogen production.

These advantages collectively demonstrate how selective oxygenate reforming can enhance sustainability, efficiency, and environmental compatibility in the production of hydrogen, making it a promising technique for the future of green energy production.

氧气化物重整过程通过利用生物质衍生的氧气化合物，如甲醇、乙醇和乙二醇，高效地转化为氢气，从而为可持续能源和化学生产做出贡献。与传统方法相比，该方法具有以下几个关键优势：

1. **可持续能源生产**：氧气化物重整采用可再生生物基氧气化合物，这些化合物可通过生物过程产生。结合氢气生产，该过程可以实现二氧化碳中性，因为产生的二氧化碳副产品可以用于未来生物质生长周期，从而促进循环经济并减少碳排放。

2. **环境影响**：氧气化合物因其低毒性及反应性而闻名，这使得它们更安全且与现有运输和存储基础设施兼容。这减少了与氢气生产、运输和存储相关的环境风险。

3. **产量和效率**：文档指出，使用铂（Pt）表面的三金属体系，特别是镍（Ni）、铁（Fe）或钛（Ti）作为3d金属的表面结构，可以增强氧气化物的重整活性和选择性。例如，表面NiPtPt(1 1 1)在重整乙醇和乙二醇方面显示出比相应的亚表面结构更高的活性。这表明在氢生产和氧气化物转化过程中提高了效率。

4. **实施的可行性**：使用Ni、Fe、Ti等3d金属作为3d金属的3d-Pt双金属表面可能成为氧气化物重整的潜在催化剂。这些催化剂提供了一种替代传统方法的可行选择，可能降低成本并改善工业应用中的性能。

5. **选择性和反应产物**：氧气化物，尤其是乙醇的选择性在表面费米能级附近发生变化时会下降。这表明针对特定费米能级优化的催化剂可以提高所需产物（如氢气）的选择性，而减少碳和氧等副产品的生成。

6. **理论和实践的联系**：文档建立了重整活性与表面费米能级之间的相关性，表明催化剂表面的电子性质对氧气化物重整的效率和选择性起着至关重要的作用。这为设计优化氢生产的催化剂提供了理论基础。

综上所述，氧气化物重整能够提升可持续性、效率和环境兼容性，在绿色能源生产领域展现出巨大潜力。
