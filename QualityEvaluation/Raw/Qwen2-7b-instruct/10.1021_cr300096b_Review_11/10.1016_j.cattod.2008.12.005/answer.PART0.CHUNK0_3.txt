[1] "Selective reforming of oxygenates can be used for the production of hydrogen for use in fuel cells."
[2] "If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 by-product can be consumed by future biomass growth."
[3] "Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage."
[4] "A general criterion can be formulated for selecting 3d-Pt bimetallic surfaces with desirable reforming activity and selectivity."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy by producing hydrogen for fuel cells. It is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 by-product can be reused in biomass growth. Oxygenate reforming benefits from low toxicity and reactivity of reactants, making it compatible with existing infrastructure for transportation and storage. A criterion can be established for selecting bimetallic surfaces with favorable reforming properties.
