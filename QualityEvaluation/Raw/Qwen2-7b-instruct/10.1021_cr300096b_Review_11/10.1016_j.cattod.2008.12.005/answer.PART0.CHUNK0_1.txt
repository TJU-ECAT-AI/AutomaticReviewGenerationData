Answer: Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by leveraging renewable biomass resources to generate hydrogen. This method offers CO2 neutrality, as the CO2 by-product can be utilized in future biomass growth cycles. Additionally, it benefits from the low toxicity and reactivity of oxygenates, making them compatible with existing infrastructure for transportation and storage. A key advantage lies in formulating criteria for selecting 3d-Pt bimetallic surfaces that exhibit high reforming activity and selectivity, optimizing the hydrogen production process.
