<p>One main criterion in fully decomposing ethanol to H2 and ideally to CO2, is that the reaction intermediate should not include ethylene, the latter is formed by dehydration. Ethylene may further react to higher hydrocarbons and this does not only consume further hydrogen it may also lead to considerable deactivation of the catalyst due to un-desorbed high molecular weight compounds.</p>
<p>In this case it has been seen that the support plays a crucial role. Acidic oxides such as Al2O3 are found to make considerable amounts of ethylene when used to support Rh. On the other hand basic oxides such as CeO2 do not orient to the dehydration reaction.</p>
<p>Steam reforming reaction (SRR) together with WGSR have been studied over a wide range of catalysts in order to find the best catalytic formulation for hydrogen and CO2 production. It was found that while Rh is very good for SRR the presence of a good WGSR such as CeO2 has resulted in a decrease of the CO2 formation at high temperature.</p>
<p>The formation of methane is undesired and the next generation of catalysts will need to suppress methane formation if a low temperature (below 650 K) hydrogen production catalyst by reforming of ethanol is desired.</p>

1. The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting organic compounds, like ethanol, into hydrogen and CO2. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact through minimized emissions, and practical implementation through the use of specific catalysts like Rh-M/CeO2 that promote desired reactions and suppress undesired side products like ethylene and methane. This makes it suitable for applications requiring hydrogen production at lower temperatures, which is beneficial for fuel cells and other clean energy technologies.

2. In terms of product yield, selective oxygenate reforming ensures that the majority of the input organic compound is converted into hydrogen and CO2, minimizing waste and maximizing resource utilization. Environmental impact is reduced because the process typically produces fewer pollutants and greenhouse gases compared to traditional methods, especially when considering the use of basic oxides like CeO2, which prevent unwanted dehydration reactions that can lead to the formation of ethylene and other hydrocarbons.

3. Practical implementation of selective oxygenate reforming involves the strategic selection of catalyst materials and conditions that optimize the conversion efficiency of the target compounds. For instance, using Rh-M/CeO2 catalysts enhances the ability to selectively decompose ethanol into hydrogen and CO2, while suppressing the formation of undesired byproducts like methane. This makes the technology feasible for integration into existing industrial processes, such as biofuel refining, and adaptable to various scales of operation.

4. The next generation of catalysts will aim to further refine the selective oxygenate reforming process by developing materials that can maintain high efficiency at lower temperatures, thereby reducing energy consumption and potentially lowering operational costs. This is crucial for achieving sustainability goals and enhancing the economic viability of hydrogen production from organic sources.

1. Ethanol is gaining attention due to its capability to produce molecular hydrogen for fuel cells. It can contribute significantly to the energy supply, especially bioenergy which has the potential to meet up to 3 TW of annual global demand, given its renewable nature derived from crop fermentation with minimal CO2 emissions. Ethanol's transportability makes onboard hydrogen generation through reforming an appealing option for fuel cells.

2. The synthesis of ethanol poses a challenge as it necessitates the dissociation of one CO molecule to form one ethanol molecule from two CO molecules. Ethanol reforming to hydrogen becomes highly efficient above 650 K, yielding hydrogen with a selectivity of 60 volume%. At these temperatures, methane reforming also takes place.

3. The reforming of ethanol to hydrogen is studied over bimetallic CeO2 catalysts consisting of Rh and either Pd or Pt. Indicators of metal presence, like CO adsorption, XPS, and TPD, suggest the metals are likely in ultra-small clusters on the catalyst surface, but TEM does not conclusively confirm their presence.

4. Rh atoms play a crucial role in initiating the dissociation of the terminal carbon-hydrogen bond in ethanol, favoring the formation of the oxametallacycle intermediate necessary for further interaction with the surface and carbon-carbon bond dissociation.

5. Increased hydrogen production at high temperatures (above 650 K) is attributed to the reforming of methane. This process, while contributing to hydrogen yield, is undesirable and suggests future catalyst developments should aim to suppress methane formation for low-temperature hydrogen production from ethanol reforming.

1. 乙醇正因其能够生产用于燃料电池的分子氢而受到广泛关注。它能显著贡献能源供应，尤其是生物能源有可能每年提供高达3太瓦的能源，这得益于其通过作物发酵产生的可再生性，并且对整体二氧化碳排放贡献极小。乙醇的运输便利使得在燃料电池上进行板载氢生成成为一种吸引人的选择。

2. 乙醇的合成特别具有挑战性，因为它需要将一个CO分子分解以形成一个从两个CO分子中产生的乙醇分子。在高于650K的温度下，乙醇到氢的改革变得非常高效，氢的选择性达到60体积%。在这些温度下，甲烷改革也发生。

3. 乙醇到氢的改革研究集中在含Rh和Pd或Pt的双金属CeO2催化剂上。CO吸附、XPS和TPD等指标表明金属可能以超微簇的形式存在于催化剂表面，但TEM没有明确证实它们的存在。

4.Rh原子在启动乙醇中末端碳-氢键的分解方面起着关键作用，从而有利于形成可能的氧化金属环中间体，进一步与表面相互作用并使碳-碳键分解。

5. 高温（高于650K）下增加的氢产量归因于甲烷的改革。尽管这一过程为氢产量做出了贡献，但它是不希望的，并表明未来催化剂的发展应该旨在抑制乙醇改革中的甲烷形成，以便在低温下从乙醇改革产生氢。
