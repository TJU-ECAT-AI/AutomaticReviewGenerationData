[1] "Ethanol has been receiving considerable attention recently because of its high potential for producing molecular hydrogen to power fuel cells."
[2] "At present the primary global energy demand is around 15 TW and bioenergy has the potential to contribute by up to 3 TW annually."
[3] "Ethanol is attractive due to its renewable nature since it can be produced, in high yield by fermentation of crops, and thus has a negligible contribution into the overall CO2 production."
[4] "Because ethanol can be easily transported, on board hydrogen generation by reforming is an attractive solution to feed fuel cells."
[5] "Ethanol synthesis is particularly challenging since making one molecule of ethanol from two molecules of CO requires the dissociation of one molecule of CO."
[6] "Reforming of ethanol to hydrogen using (3 moles of water per mole of ethanol) was very efficient particularly above 650 K where hydrogen selectivity reaches 60 vol.%. At these temperatures hydrogen production from reforming of methane takes place."
[7] "The reaction of ethanol has been studied over bimetallic CeO2 catalysts (Rh and Pd or Pt) for the production of hydrogen."
[8] "While CO adsorption (IR and titration), XPS and TPD techniques revealed characteristics related to the presence of the metal, TEM does not give conclusive presence."
[9] "It is highly likely that these metals are dispersed in ultra small clusters on the surface of the support."
[10] "The presence of Rh atoms is crucial for the reforming of ethanol since they initiate the terminal carbonhydrogen bond dissociation and thus favoring the formation of the possible oxametallacycle intermediate needed for further interaction with the surface and dissociation of the carboncarbon bond."
[11] "The increasing hydrogen production at elevated temperatures (above 650 K) is most likely due to reforming of methane."

1. Ethanol is gaining attention due to its capability to produce molecular hydrogen for fuel cells. It can contribute significantly to the energy supply, especially bioenergy which has the potential to meet up to 3 TW of annual global demand, given its renewable nature derived from crop fermentation with minimal CO2 emissions. Ethanol's transportability makes onboard hydrogen generation through reforming an appealing option for fuel cells.

2. The synthesis of ethanol poses a challenge as it necessitates the dissociation of one CO molecule to form one ethanol molecule from two CO molecules. Ethanol reforming to hydrogen becomes highly efficient above 650 K, yielding hydrogen with a selectivity of 60 volume%. At these temperatures, methane reforming also takes place.

3. The reforming of ethanol to hydrogen is studied over bimetallic CeO2 catalysts consisting of Rh and either Pd or Pt. Indicators of metal presence, like CO adsorption, XPS, and TPD, suggest the metals are likely in ultra-small clusters on the catalyst surface, but TEM does not conclusively confirm their presence.

4. Rh atoms play a crucial role in initiating the dissociation of the terminal carbon-hydrogen bond in ethanol, favoring the formation of the oxametallacycle intermediate necessary for further interaction with the surface and carbon-carbon bond dissociation.

5. Increased hydrogen production at high temperatures (above 650 K) is attributed to the reforming of methane. This process, while contributing to hydrogen yield, is undesirable and suggests future catalyst developments should aim to suppress methane formation for low-temperature hydrogen production from ethanol reforming.

1. 乙醇正因其能够生产用于燃料电池的分子氢而受到广泛关注。它能显著贡献能源供应，尤其是生物能源有可能每年提供高达3太瓦的能源，这得益于其通过作物发酵产生的可再生性，并且对整体二氧化碳排放贡献极小。乙醇的运输便利使得在燃料电池上进行板载氢生成成为一种吸引人的选择。

2. 乙醇的合成特别具有挑战性，因为它需要将一个CO分子分解以形成一个从两个CO分子中产生的乙醇分子。在高于650K的温度下，乙醇到氢的改革变得非常高效，氢的选择性达到60体积%。在这些温度下，甲烷改革也发生。

3. 乙醇到氢的改革研究集中在含Rh和Pd或Pt的双金属CeO2催化剂上。CO吸附、XPS和TPD等指标表明金属可能以超微簇的形式存在于催化剂表面，但TEM没有明确证实它们的存在。

4.Rh原子在启动乙醇中末端碳-氢键的分解方面起着关键作用，从而有利于形成可能的氧化金属环中间体，进一步与表面相互作用并使碳-碳键分解。

5. 高温（高于650K）下增加的氢产量归因于甲烷的改革。尽管这一过程为氢产量做出了贡献，但它是不希望的，并表明未来催化剂的发展应该旨在抑制乙醇改革中的甲烷形成，以便在低温下从乙醇改革产生氢。
