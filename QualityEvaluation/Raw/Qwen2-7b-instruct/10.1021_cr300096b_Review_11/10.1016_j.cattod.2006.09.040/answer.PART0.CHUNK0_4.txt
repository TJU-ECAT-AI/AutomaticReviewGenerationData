[1] "Ethanol has been receiving considerable attention recently because of its high potential for producing molecular hydrogen to power fuel cells."
[2] "At present the primary global energy demand is around 15 TW and bioenergy has the potential to contribute by up to 3 TW annually."
[3] "Finding new processes or improving the present ones is thus highly desirable."
[4] "Ethanol synthesis is particularly challenging since making one molecule of ethanol from two molecules of CO requires the dissociation of one molecule of CO."
[5] "Within the principle of micro-reversibility it is thus not surprising that catalysts found appropriate for ethanol decomposition to hydrogen and carbon oxides are very similar to those found active for making it."
[6] "To make Hydrogen from ethanol in a catalytic reaction several requirements need to be fulfilled."
[7] "First, the metal used need to be efficient in dissociating the CC bond of ethanol."
[8] "Second, the support needs to be active for water gas shift reaction to maximize the hydrogen yield."
[9] "Third, the metal needs to be active for the H:H recombination reaction."
[10] "Ethanol-TPD was conducted on several monometallic and bimetallic catalysts, containing Rh, Pt and Pd on CeO2 and details of some are given in Refs."
[11] "This high activity is of course due to the higher loading of the support (see Table 1) but is essentially due to a combined (synergetic) effect of the Rh with Pd or Pt as explained next."
[12] "While the three unreduced catalysts behave similarly for ethanol decomposition and give considerable amounts of acetaldehyde the reduced catalysts containing Rh switch the reaction from acetaldehyde to methane."
[13] "On the contrary the reduced Pd-Pt/CeO2 does not show much difference."
[14] "In other words the carboncarbon bond splitting of ethanol is not further improved by reduction of Pd or Pt ions."
[15] "This behavior is best explained in Fig. 5."
[16] "While the three unreduced catalysts behave similarly for ethanol decomposition and give considerable amounts of acetaldehyde the reduced catalysts containing Rh switch the reaction from acetaldehyde to methane."
[17] "Ethanol has almost totally reacted at temperatures >650 K."
[18] "The 550650 K temperature-interval is very critical for CO and CO2 production."
[19] "Water gas shift reaction (WGSR) is most likely the reason."
[20] "Above 700 K hydrogen production increases in detriment of methane, this is consistent with reforming of methane."
