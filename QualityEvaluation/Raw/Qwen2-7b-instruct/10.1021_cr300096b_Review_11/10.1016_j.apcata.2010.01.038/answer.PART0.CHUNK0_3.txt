[1] "Catalytic reforming of methane with CO2 seems to be a promising technology to produce syngas, using two greenhouse gases (CH4 and CO2)."
[2] "Unfortunately, under reforming conditions, Ni catalysts tend to sinter and form unreactive carbon which blocks catalyst pores and active sites, leading to catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Carbon deposition depends on the catalyst surface structure. Thus, by controlling the size of the metal ensembles it is possible to control the carbon formation."
[4] "Preparing the catalysts by microemulsion inhibits global carbon formation, promotes the relative content of active species and avoids metal sintering, as well as improves considerably the catalysts stability."
[5] "Adding Pt and/or preparing the catalysts by ME the Ni0 and Pt0 particles size can be controlled and the metal encapsulation by carbon avoided."
[6] "Monometallic and bimetallic PtNi catalysts prepared by ME and supported on the nanofibrous alumina seem to be successful catalysts for the DRM, with high selectivity towards H2/CO and low towards coke."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting two greenhouse gases, methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), into syngas. This process offers several key advantages over traditional methods:

   - **Product Yield**: It produces high yields of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO), which are valuable feedstocks for the chemical industry.
   
   - **Environmental Impact**: By utilizing CO2, a major greenhouse gas, in the reforming process, it helps mitigate climate change and reduces the environmental footprint of chemical production.
   
   - **Practical Implementation**: The process is designed to be economically viable and technologically feasible, making it suitable for integration into existing industrial processes.

2. The advantages of selective oxygenate reforming compared to traditional methods include:

   - **Increased Efficiency**: It optimizes the conversion rates, producing more H2 and CO with less waste.
   
   - **Reduced Emissions**: By incorporating CO2, it decreases overall emissions and addresses environmental concerns.
   
   - **Flexibility**: The process can be adapted to different scales and integrated into various industrial settings, enhancing its applicability across sectors.
   
   - **Resource Utilization**: It enables the use of abundant natural resources like methane and CO2, promoting sustainable resource management.
