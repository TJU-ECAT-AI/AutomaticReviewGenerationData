<p>The industrial practices rely on Ni-based catalysts, because of their cost and availability in comparison with other metals.

<p>It has been reported that carbon deposition depends on the catalyst surface structure. Thus, by controlling the size of the metal ensembles it is possible to control the carbon formation.</p>
<p>Preparing the catalysts by microemulsion inhibits global carbon formation, promotes the relative content of active species and avoids metal sintering, as well as improves considerably the catalysts stability.</p>
<p>The reverse microemulsion method has proved to be an effective procedure to synthesize supported and unsupported catalysts with a high control of the composition and the metal dispersion, on the nanometer level.</p>
<p>In the bimetallic catalysts, there is a Pt-Ni interaction between metallic centers, which enhances the catalyst stability and selectivity towards H2 and CO.</p>
<p>From activity tests it can be concluded that catalysts prepared by the reverse microemulsion method are less sensitive to coke deposition and more stable under CO2-reforming conditions.</p>
<p>Adding Pt and/or preparing the catalysts by ME the Ni0 and Pt0 particles size can be controlled and the metal encapsulation by carbon avoided. The activity and stability of the PtNi nanocatalysts is improved when the metal ensembles have similar dimensions to the fibers of the support, which avoids metal sintering and the insertion of Ni into the alumina structure.</p>

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting greenhouse gases into valuable products, reducing environmental impact. Key advantages include higher product yields, minimized carbon formation, and enhanced catalyst stability. Compared to traditional methods, this process offers more controlled and selective transformations, making it more environmentally friendly and economically viable.

2. The process utilizes Ni-based catalysts, which are cost-effective and widely available. However, under reforming conditions, these catalysts tend to sinter and form unreactive carbon that obstructs active sites, leading to catalyst deactivation. Controlling the size of metal ensembles helps manage carbon formation, improving catalyst performance.

3. By preparing catalysts through microemulsion, the process inhibits global carbon formation, increases the active species' content, prevents metal sintering, and significantly boosts catalyst stability.

4. The reverse microemulsion method effectively synthesizes catalysts with precise control over composition and metal dispersion, enhancing their performance at the nanoscale level.

5. In bimetallic PtNi catalysts, the Pt-Ni interaction stabilizes the catalyst, enhancing its selectivity towards hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

6. Catalysts prepared using the reverse microemulsion method exhibit lower sensitivity to coke deposition and improved stability under CO2-reforming conditions.

7. Incorporating Pt and utilizing the ME method allows for the control of Ni0 and Pt0 particle sizes, preventing metal encapsulation by carbon, and improving the activity and stability of PtNi nanocatalysts.

8. Monometallic and bimetallic PtNi catalysts supported on nanofibrous alumina demonstrate high selectivity towards hydrogen and carbon monoxide, with low coke formation, making them effective for direct methane reforming processes.
