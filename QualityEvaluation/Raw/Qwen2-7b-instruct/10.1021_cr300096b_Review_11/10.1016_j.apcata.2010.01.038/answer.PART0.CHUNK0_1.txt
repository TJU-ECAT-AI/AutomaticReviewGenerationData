<p>It has been reported that carbon deposition depends on the catalyst surface structure. Thus, by controlling the size of the metal ensembles it is possible to control the carbon formation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the metal dispersion and metalsupport interaction are related to different aspects as the preparation procedure of the catalysts, the support employed and the catalytic pre-treatment. It is well established that an adequate preparation method can considerably improve the metal disposition over the support as well as its contact, which consequently affects the catalytic performance.</p>
<p>The reverse microemulsion method has proved to be an effective procedure to synthesize supported and unsupported catalysts with a high control of the composition and the metal dispersion, on the nanometer level.</p>
<p>Preparing the catalysts by ME inhibits global carbon formation, promotes the relative content of active species and avoids metal sintering, as well as improves considerably the catalysts stability.</p>

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by producing valuable oxygenated chemicals from greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide. Its key advantages include:

1. Improved selectivity towards hydrogen and carbon monoxide, reducing the formation of coke, which is beneficial for maintaining catalyst efficiency and reducing environmental impact.
2. Enhanced stability under reaction conditions, allowing for prolonged operation without significant deactivation, which reduces the need for frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement.
3. Control over the size and dispersion of active metal species, which helps in managing carbon deposition and enhancing the overall performance of the catalyst.
4. Compatibility with a nanofibrous alumina support, which allows for systems with homogeneous and stable metallic particles, improving the reaction kinetics and efficiency.
5. Potential for cost-effective and environmentally friendly production processes, as the use of noble metals like platinum can inhibit coke formation and improve the stability of Ni-based catalysts.
