<p>The dry reforming of methane (DRM) provides low H2/CO ratios desirable for the synthesis of valuable oxygenated chemicals.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, under reforming conditions, Ni catalysts tend to sinter and form unreactive carbon which blocks catalyst pores and active sites, leading to catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>Preparing the catalysts by microemulsion inhibits global carbon formation, promotes the relative content of active species and avoids metal sintering, as well as improves considerably the catalysts stability.</p>
<p>The reverse microemulsion method has proved to be an effective procedure to synthesize supported and unsupported catalysts with a high control of the composition and the metal dispersion, on the nanometer level.</p>
<p>Moreover, the metal dispersion and metalsupport interaction are related to different aspects as the preparation procedure of the catalysts, the support employed and the catalytic pre-treatment.</p>
<p>In the bimetallic catalysts, there is a Pt-Ni interaction between metallic centers, which enhances the catalyst stability and selectivity towards H2 and CO.</p>

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting greenhouse gases like methane and carbon dioxide into valuable oxygenated chemicals. Its key advantages compared to traditional methods include:

1. **High Product Yield**: Selective oxygenate reforming yields a higher proportion of desired products, such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide, compared to traditional methods that may produce more byproducts.

2. **Reduced Environmental Impact**: By utilizing methane and carbon dioxide, two significant greenhouse gases, this process helps mitigate climate change risks and reduces waste.

3. **Enhanced Practical Implementation**: The use of metal catalysts, particularly those prepared by the reverse microemulsion method, ensures better control over the composition and dispersion of metals, leading to catalysts with improved stability and activity. This makes the process more practical and scalable for industrial applications.

4. **Selective Catalysis**: The Pt-Ni interaction in bimetallic catalysts enhances stability and selectivity towards hydrogen and carbon monoxide, reducing unwanted side reactions and increasing efficiency.

5. **Controlled Carbon Formation**: The method of preparing catalysts by the reverse microemulsion inhibits global carbon formation, promoting active species and avoiding metal sintering, which extends the lifetime and efficiency of the catalysts.
