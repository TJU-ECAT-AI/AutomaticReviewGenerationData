<p>The dry reforming of methane (DRM) provides low H2/CO ratios desirable for the synthesis of valuable oxygenated chemicals.</p>
<p>The industrial practices rely on Ni-based catalysts, because of their cost and availability in comparison with other metals. Unfortunately, under reforming conditions, Ni catalysts tend to sinter and form unreactive carbon which blocks catalyst pores and active sites, leading to catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>Preparing the catalysts by microemulsion inhibits global carbon formation, promotes the relative content of active species and avoids metal sintering, as well as improves considerably the catalysts stability.</p>
<p>The reverse microemulsion method has proved to be an effective procedure to synthesize supported and unsupported catalysts with a high control of the composition and the metal dispersion, on the nanometer level.</p>
<p>In the bimetallic catalysts, there is a Pt-Ni interaction between metallic centers, which enhances the catalyst stability and selectivity towards H2 and CO.</p>
<p>Adding Pt and/or preparing the catalysts by ME the Ni0 and Pt0 particles size can be controlled and the metal encapsulation by carbon avoided. The activity and stability of the PtNi nanocatalysts is improved when the metal ensembles have similar dimensions to the fibers of the support, which avoids metal sintering and the insertion of Ni into the alumina structure.</p>
<p>Monometallic and bimetallic PtNi catalysts prepared by ME and supported on the nanofibrous alumina seem to be successful catalysts for the DRM, with high selectivity towards H2/CO and low towards coke.</p>

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes significantly to sustainable energy and chemical production by providing a cleaner alternative to traditional methods. It reduces environmental impact through lower emissions of harmful pollutants, enhances product yield by efficiently converting feedstocks into valuable chemicals, and improves practical implementation by offering a more cost-effective and efficient means of production.

Advantages compared to traditional methods include:

1. **Product Yield**: Selective oxygenate reforming allows for the conversion of hydrocarbons into oxygenated products with high selectivity, maximizing yield and efficiency.
   
2. **Environmental Impact**: By minimizing the formation of unreactive carbon and optimizing reaction conditions, it reduces emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, contributing to a greener manufacturing process.
   
3. **Practical Implementation**: The use of advanced catalysts, such as those prepared via the reverse microemulsion method, ensures better dispersion and control over metal particle sizes, leading to improved stability, reduced sintering, and minimized carbon deposition. This results in a more reliable and long-lasting catalyst system that requires less maintenance and operates more efficiently.
   
4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: With optimized catalyst design and improved stability, the overall cost of production can be reduced, making the process more economically viable for industry.
   
5. **Flexibility**: The ability to tailor catalyst properties, such as particle size and composition, enables customization to suit specific chemical production needs, enhancing the versatility of the reforming process.
