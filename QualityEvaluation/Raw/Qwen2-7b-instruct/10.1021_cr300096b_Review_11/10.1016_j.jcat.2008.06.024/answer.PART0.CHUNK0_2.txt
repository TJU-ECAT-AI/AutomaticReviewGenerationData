[1] "Due to rising fuel prices, efforts to improve catalysts for production of alternative fuels have increased in the last few years."
[2] "Hydrogen production from biomass is one of the most prevailing research areas in this regard. Hydrogen is considered one of the best alternative fuels because of its environmental benefits and high efficiency for energy production in fuel cells."
[3] "However, hydrogen as a fuel will be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions only when the source of hydrogen is environmentally benign such as water or biomass."
[4] "The focus is thus on biomass, which is cheap and abundant. Its high water content makes it unsuitable for gasification or steam reforming, but reforming of the biomass in the liquid phase is possible."
[5] "From our previous studies [5] and the literature [6] ,[7] ,[8] we observed that the activity of the catalyst can be greatly enhanced using a bimetallic catalyst."
[6] "It has also been suggested that the addition of noble metals to a Ni catalyst may reduce coke deposition and therefore provide stability [9]."
[7] "The NiPt system in particular has been extensively studied because of its synergetic catalytic effect [10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13]."
[8] "Reducibility and kinetic studies for various reactions on NiPt system supported on silica and alumina have also been reported [10] ,[11] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16]."
[9] "In this study we aim to correlate the effect of the noble metal promoters such as Pt and Pd on Ni, using temperature programmed reduction (TPR), oxidation (TPO) and CO desorption (TPD)."
[10] "Heat-flow microcalorimetry was employed to determine the strength of CO interaction on these catalysts."
[11] "CO interaction with the catalyst is of high importance because a strong interaction can lead to catalyst poisoning [21]."
[12] "It has been suggested that weaker interaction can decrease the heat of adsorption of CO and hydrogen chemisorption, thereby increasing the fraction of the surface available for the reforming reaction [22]."
[13] "Reducing the amount of precious noble metal content also reduces the cost of the catalysts."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing biomass as a renewable resource to produce hydrogen. This method has several key advantages compared to traditional methods:

1. Environmental Impact: Hydrogen produced from biomass sources, rather than fossil fuels, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, making it a cleaner energy option.

2. Product Yield: The reforming of biomass in the liquid phase allows for efficient conversion of oxygenates into hydrogen, potentially increasing the yield of hydrogen compared to traditional steam reforming processes.

3. Practical Implementation: Biomass is a cheap and abundant resource, making it a feasible feedstock for hydrogen production. The use of bimetallic catalysts, such as Ni-Pt and Ni-Pd, enhances the activity of the catalyst, leading to improved efficiency and productivity.

Answer: Selective oxygenate reforming leverages biomass as a sustainable feedstock to produce hydrogen, offering environmental benefits, higher product yields, and practical implementation through the use of efficient catalysts.
