[1] "Due to rising fuel prices, efforts to improve catalysts for production of alternative fuels have increased in the last few years."
[2] "Hydrogen production from biomass is one of the most prevailing research areas in this regard."
[3] "From our previous studies [5] and the literature [6] ,[7] ,[8] we observed that the activity of the catalyst can be greatly enhanced using a bimetallic catalyst."
[4] "However, hydrogen as a fuel will be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions only when the source of hydrogen is environmentally benign such as water or biomass."
[5] "The focus is thus on biomass, which is cheap and abundant."
[6] "Its high water content makes it unsuitable for gasification or steam reforming, but reforming of the biomass in the liquid phase is possible."
[7] "After the introduction of aqueous phase reforming of alcohols and ethylene glycol [1] ,[2] ,[3] , further studies [4] suggested that hydrogen can be directly produced from aqueous solutions of sugar or sugar alcohols."
[8] "It has also been suggested that the addition of noble metals to a Ni catalyst may reduce coke deposition and therefore provide stability [9] ."
[9] "The NiPt system in particular has been extensively studied because of its synergetic catalytic effect [10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ."
[10] "Reducibility and kinetic studies for various reactions on NiPt system supported on silica and alumina have also been reported [10] ,[11] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] ."
[11] "One of the reasons could be that the catalyst was more resistant to oxidation under the reaction condition [25] ."
[12] "Moreover, the activity and selectivity of the bimetallic catalyst per unit site of the catalyst was also found to be higher for the PROX reaction."
[13] "In this study we aim to correlate the effect of the noble metal promoters such as Pt and Pd on Ni, using temperature programmed reduction (TPR), oxidation (TPO) and CO desorption (TPD)."
[14] "The addition of Pt and Pd to the Ni may form surface alloys and create heterogeneity or different lattice spacing leading to decrease in two site chemisorption."
[15] "The addition of Pt and Pd to Ni catalyst increases the reducibility of Ni catalysts and therefore the number of active sites."
[16] "We observed that the differential heat of adsorption for NiPt/Alnf reduced to 111.28 kJ/mol, which was 11.45 and 5.51 kJ/mol lower than Pt/Alnf and Ni/Alnf respectively."
[17] "The reaction study conducted on the fixed bed reactor provided the evidence that the bimetallic catalysts exhibit substantially greater activity than the corresponding pure metal catalysts."
[18] "The rate of H2 formation from NiPt/Alnf was more than five times greater than Ni/Alnf and the sorbitol conversion also increased substantially."

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing biomass as a renewable resource. It offers advantages in product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation compared to traditional methods, particularly in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by producing hydrogen from water or biomass. This method is cheaper and more abundant, making it a promising approach for sustainable energy generation.

2. The key advantages of selective oxygenate reforming include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to the use of benign sources, and practical implementation through the utilization of inexpensive and abundant biomass resources. Additionally, the reforming process can directly produce hydrogen from aqueous solutions of sugars or sugar alcohols, enhancing efficiency and sustainability.

3. The addition of noble metals, such as Pt and Pd, to Ni catalysts enhances their activity, stability, and selectivity, contributing to the production of alternative fuels. These metals form surface alloys, creating heterogeneity or altering lattice spacing, which decreases the heat of adsorption and favors the water-gas shift reaction, leading to higher hydrogen yield.

4. The bimetallic catalysts, specifically Ni-Pt and Ni-Pd, exhibit significantly higher activity and selectivity compared to their monometallic counterparts. This increased activity translates into a faster rate of hydrogen formation and higher conversion rates of biomass derivatives, such as sorbitol, to hydrogen. These findings highlight the potential of bimetallic catalysts in enhancing the efficiency of biomass-based hydrogen production processes.

1. 选择性氧化物重整通过利用生物质作为可再生资源，对可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。它在产品产量、环境影响以及与传统方法相比的实施可行性方面提供了优势，特别是减少了温室气体排放，通过使用水或生物质产生氢气。这种方法更便宜、更丰富，是可持续能源产生的一种有前景的方法。

2. 选择性氧化物重整的关键优势包括更高的产品产量、降低环境影响（由于使用了无害来源）、以及通过利用廉价且丰富的生物质资源实现的实施可行性。此外，重整过程可以直接从糖或糖醇的水溶液中产生氢气，提高了效率和可持续性。

3. 向镍催化剂添加贵金属，如铂和钯，可以增强其活性、稳定性和选择性，从而促进替代燃料的生产。这些金属在表面形成合金，产生异质性或改变晶格间距，这降低了吸附热并有利于水-气体转移反应，从而提高氢产量。

4. 双金属催化剂，尤其是镍-铂和镍-钯，与单一金属催化剂相比表现出显著更高的活性和选择性。这种增加的活性转化为更快的氢生成速率和更高转化率的生物质衍生物（如山梨醇）到氢。这些发现强调了双金属催化剂在提高生物质为基础的氢生产过程效率的潜力。
