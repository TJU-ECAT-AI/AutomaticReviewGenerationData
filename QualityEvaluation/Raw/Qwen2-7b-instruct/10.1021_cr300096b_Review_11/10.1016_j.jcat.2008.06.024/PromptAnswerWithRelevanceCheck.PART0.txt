[1] "Due to rising fuel prices, efforts to improve catalysts for production of alternative fuels have increased in the last few years."
[2] "Hydrogen production from biomass is one of the most prevailing research areas in this regard."
[3] "However, hydrogen as a fuel will be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions only when the source of hydrogen is environmentally benign such as water or biomass."
[4] "It has been known for a long time [27] that an ideal catalyst should not have either too strong or too weak adsorption for the reactant."
[5] "The addition of noble metals, even in small fractions, to the Ni catalyst has a significant but weaker promoting effect on the adsorption of CO."
[6] "It was suggested earlier that the Pt and Pd forms near surface alloys with Ni and causes changes in the lattice spacing [39]."
[7] "According to the theoretical calculation of Greeley et al. [40] some of the near surface alloys including Ni/Pt may cause lowering of CO-binding energy leading to a decrease in heat of adsorption."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting biomass-derived oxygenates into hydrogen and other valuable chemicals. Its key advantages include:

1. **Product Yield**: Selective oxygenate reforming enables the production of hydrogen from biomass, which can be used as an environmentally friendly fuel source. The reforming process often results in higher yields of hydrogen compared to traditional methods, making it economically attractive.

2. **Environmental Impact**: By utilizing biomass as the feedstock, this process reduces reliance on fossil fuels, thereby decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Biomass is considered a renewable resource, contributing positively to sustainability goals.

3. **Practical Implementation**: The ability to use readily available biomass sources for hydrogen production simplifies the logistics of the supply chain. This makes the process more practical and adaptable to existing infrastructure, potentially reducing the costs associated with setting up new facilities.

4. **Enhanced Catalytic Activity**: The addition of noble metals like platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd) to nickel (Ni)-based catalysts improves their activity in the reforming reactions. These metals form surface alloys with Ni, which lowers the heat of adsorption of reactants like carbon monoxide (CO), facilitating more efficient and selective conversions.

These advantages make selective oxygenate reforming a promising technology for the sustainable production of hydrogen and other chemicals, offering a cleaner and more environmentally responsible alternative to traditional methods.

1. Selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by utilizing biomass as a renewable resource. It offers advantages in product yield, environmental impact, and practical implementation compared to traditional methods, particularly in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by producing hydrogen from water or biomass. This method is cheaper and more abundant, making it a promising approach for sustainable energy generation.

2. The key advantages of selective oxygenate reforming include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to the use of benign sources, and practical implementation through the utilization of inexpensive and abundant biomass resources. Additionally, the reforming process can directly produce hydrogen from aqueous solutions of sugars or sugar alcohols, enhancing efficiency and sustainability.

3. The addition of noble metals, such as Pt and Pd, to Ni catalysts enhances their activity, stability, and selectivity, contributing to the production of alternative fuels. These metals form surface alloys, creating heterogeneity or altering lattice spacing, which decreases the heat of adsorption and favors the water-gas shift reaction, leading to higher hydrogen yield.

4. The bimetallic catalysts, specifically Ni-Pt and Ni-Pd, exhibit significantly higher activity and selectivity compared to their monometallic counterparts. This increased activity translates into a faster rate of hydrogen formation and higher conversion rates of biomass derivatives, such as sorbitol, to hydrogen. These findings highlight the potential of bimetallic catalysts in enhancing the efficiency of biomass-based hydrogen production processes.
