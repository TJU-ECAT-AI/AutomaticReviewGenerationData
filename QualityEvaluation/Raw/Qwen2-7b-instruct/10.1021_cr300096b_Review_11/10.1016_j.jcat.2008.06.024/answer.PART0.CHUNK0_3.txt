[1] "Due to rising fuel prices, efforts to improve catalysts for production of alternative fuels have increased in the last few years. Hydrogen production from biomass is one of the most prevailing research areas in this regard."
[2] "We observed that the activity of the catalyst can be greatly enhanced using a bimetallic catalyst. It has also been suggested that the addition of noble metals to a Ni catalyst may reduce coke deposition and therefore provide stability."
[3] "The promoting effect of Pt and Pd in bimetallic NiPt and NiPd catalysts supported on alumina nano-fibre (Alnf) were tested for the liquid phase reforming of sorbitol to produce hydrogen."
[4] "The rate of H2 formation from sorbitol reforming was 3 to 5 times higher for bimetallic catalysts when compared to the monometallic catalysts."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting biomass into hydrogen, a cleaner alternative fuel. Its key advantages include:

1. Enhanced product yield: Bimetallic catalysts, specifically those containing Pt and Pd, significantly boost the formation rate of hydrogen from sorbitol, demonstrating higher efficiency than monometallic catalysts.
   
2. Reduced environmental impact: Hydrogen is considered an environmentally friendly fuel, and its production from biomass minimizes greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels.
   
3. Practical implementation: The use of bimetallic catalysts improves the stability of hydrogen production processes, potentially reducing the need for additional treatments like coke removal, thus simplifying industrial applications.

选择性氧化物重整过程通过将生物质转化为氢气，为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。其关键优势包括：

1. 提高产品产量：铂和钯基双金属催化剂显著提高了从山梨醇到氢气的形成速率，与单一金属催化剂相比，效率更高。
   
2. 减少环境影响：氢气被视为一种环保燃料，从生物质生产的氢气排放温室气体的量比化石燃料要少。
   
3. 实施简便：使用双金属催化剂可以提高氢气生产过程的稳定性，可能减少了额外处理（如焦炭去除）的需求，从而简化工业应用。
