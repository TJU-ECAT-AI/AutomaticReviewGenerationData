[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "Introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3–0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting methane into useful products such as hydrogen and syngas, which can be used in various industrial processes. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and enhanced practical implementation through optimized catalysts. The study of Pt/Ni ratio in bimetallic catalysts for methane reforming demonstrates that introducing a small amount of platinum (0.3-0.5 wt.%) can lead to better surface properties and catalytic behavior, specifically by decreasing the NiO size, facilitating its easy reduction, and achieving a uniform distribution of nickel particles.

选择性氧化物重整过程通过有效地将甲烷转化为有用的产物，如氢气和合成气，在可持续能源和化学生产中发挥重要作用。其主要优势包括更高的产品产出率、较低的环境影响（由于排放量减少）以及通过优化催化剂实现更高效的实施。铂镍双金属催化剂中铂含量（0.3-0.5 wt.%）的研究表明，引入少量铂可以改善表面性质和催化行为，具体表现为降低NiO尺寸、促进其易于还原，并实现镍颗粒的均匀分布。
