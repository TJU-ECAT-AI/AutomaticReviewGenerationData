[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "Introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3 – 0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting hydrocarbons, such as methane, into valuable chemicals and fuels with minimal waste. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and improved operational efficiency. Compared to traditional methods, selective oxygenate reforming often exhibits better selectivity towards desired products, enhanced stability of catalysts, and lower energy consumption, making it a preferred choice in modern chemical and energy industries.
