[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "Introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3–0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting hydrocarbons into valuable oxygenates such as methanol, ethanol, and other alcohols, ketones, and ethers. Its key advantages over traditional methods include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and enhanced practical implementation through improved catalyst stability and activity. The study of Pt/Ni ratio in bimetallic PtNi catalysts for methane reforming highlights the role of Pt in modifying the surface properties and catalytic behavior, leading to enhanced performance in terms of NiO size reduction, easier reduction, and a more uniform distribution of nickel metal particles.

选择性氧化重整过程通过有效地将碳氢化合物转化为有价值的氧化物，如甲醇、乙醇和其他醇、酮和醚，为可持续能源和化学生产做出了贡献。与传统方法相比，其关键优势包括更高的产品产率、更低的环境影响（由于排放量较低）以及通过提高催化剂稳定性和活性来增强实施的改进。在研究Pt/Ni比率对含CO2的甲烷重整用双金属PtNi催化剂的表面特性和催化行为的影响时，Pt的作用被证明能够改变表面性质并改善催化性能，导致NiO尺寸减小、更容易还原以及镍金属颗粒分布更均匀。
