<quotes>
[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "Introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3–0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling efficient conversion of hydrocarbons into valuable chemicals and fuels. Its key advantages over traditional methods include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and enhanced operational flexibility. The presence of a small amount of Pt in Ni-based catalysts for methane reforming improves surface properties and catalytic behavior, leading to better performance and efficiency in the reforming process.

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting hydrocarbons into valuable oxygenates such as methanol, ethanol, and other alcohols, ketones, and ethers. Its key advantages over traditional methods include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and enhanced practical implementation through improved catalyst stability and activity. The study of Pt/Ni ratio in bimetallic PtNi catalysts for methane reforming highlights the role of Pt in modifying the surface properties and catalytic behavior, leading to enhanced performance in terms of NiO size reduction, easier reduction, and a more uniform distribution of nickel metal particles.

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by efficiently converting methane into useful products such as hydrogen and syngas, which can be used in various industrial processes. Its key advantages include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and enhanced practical implementation through optimized catalysts. The study of Pt/Ni ratio in bimetallic catalysts for methane reforming demonstrates that introducing a small amount of platinum (0.3-0.5 wt.%) can lead to better surface properties and catalytic behavior, specifically by decreasing the NiO size, facilitating its easy reduction, and achieving a uniform distribution of nickel particles.
