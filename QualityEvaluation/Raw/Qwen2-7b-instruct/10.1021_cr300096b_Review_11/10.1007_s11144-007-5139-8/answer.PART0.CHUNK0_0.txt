[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "Introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3–0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The process of selective oxygenate reforming contributes to sustainable energy and chemical production by enabling efficient conversion of hydrocarbons into valuable chemicals and fuels. Its key advantages over traditional methods include higher product yields, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and enhanced operational flexibility. The presence of a small amount of Pt in Ni-based catalysts for methane reforming improves surface properties and catalytic behavior, leading to better performance and efficiency in the reforming process.
