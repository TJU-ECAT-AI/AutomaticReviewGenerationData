[1] "Very recently, the advent of boron nitride for the selective ODH of propane confirmed the exciting opportunity of BN catalysts for controllable aliphatic CH activation; the arm-chair BN edge was proposed to activate O2 onsite to form a B-O-O-N intermediate on the basis of calculations, and thereby the rupture of the nonterminal CH of propane ensued."
[2] "A follow-up study noted that on the basis of spectroscopic evidence, the BOH group in boron nitride was responsible for hydrogen abstraction of propane to propene and that this group simultaneously prevented overoxidation to CO2."
[3] "We therefore anticipated that O2 activation should be initiated by CH activation. Indeed, our operando spectroscopic results showed that BO(H) formation was accompanied by an induction phase of C2H6 activation and that it was these BO(H) sites that served as the active sites for the ODH ethane."
[4] "The active sites of BO(H) are formed at the BN edges by the aid of ethane, and the formed BO sites can abstract a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2."

1. Two-dimensional dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) are developed through the utilization of arm-chair boron nitride (BN) edges. These edges are proposed to activate oxygen (O2) on-site to form a B-O-O-N intermediate, facilitating the cleavage of the non-terminal carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond in propane. Spectroscopic evidence supports the involvement of the BOH group in the hydrogen abstraction process, ensuring the formation of propene without overoxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2).

2. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts offer a higher density of active sites, which translates to enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed sites enable more efficient and controlled activation of aliphatic CH bonds, resulting in improved selectivity for desired products like olefins.

3. The research interest in these unique structural features stems from the potential for developing more efficient and selective catalysts for aliphatic hydrocarbon activation. The ability to control the cleavage of CH bonds without unwanted side reactions, such as overoxidation to CO2, represents a significant advancement in the field of catalysis. The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts represent a promising avenue for achieving this level of control and selectivity.

1. 最近，对于丙烷的选择性氧化脱氢反应（ODHP），硼氮化物（BN）催化剂的臂椅BN边缘被证实为可控的碳氢键活化提供了令人兴奋的机会。基于计算，这些边缘在原位激活氧气（O2），形成B-O-O-N中间体，进而导致丙烷非端基CH键的断裂。根据光谱证据，BN中的BOH组分负责从丙烷中抽取氢原子生成丙烯，并同时防止过氧化生成二氧化碳（CO2）。

2. 相比于线性排列的边缘位点，二维分散的活性位点在硼基催化剂中提供了更高的活性位点密度，从而带来了增强的催化性能。这些独特的结构特征使得对烷烃中碳氢键的高效和精确活化成为可能，从而提高了目标产物如烯烃的选择性。

3. 对这些独特结构特征的研究兴趣源于开发更有效、选择性更高的催化剂以实现对烷烃碳氢键控制活化的潜力。通过避免不必要的副反应，如过氧化生成二氧化碳，实现对CH键的精确切割，代表了催化领域的一个重大进展。硼基催化剂中二维分散的活性位点代表了实现这一水平的控制和选择性的有希望的途径。
