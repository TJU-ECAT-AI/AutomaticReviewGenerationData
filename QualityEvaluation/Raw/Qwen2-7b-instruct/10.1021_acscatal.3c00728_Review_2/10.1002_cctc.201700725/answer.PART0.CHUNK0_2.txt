[1] "Very recently, the advent of boron nitride for the selective ODH of propane confirmed the exciting opportunity of BN catalysts for controllable aliphatic CH activation; the arm-chair BN edge was proposed to activate O2 onsite to form a B-O-O-N intermediate on the basis of calculations, and thereby the rupture of the nonterminal CH of propane ensued."
[2] "A follow-up study noted that on the basis of spectroscopic evidence, the BOH group in boron nitride was responsible for hydrogen abstraction of propane to propene and that this group simultaneously prevented overoxidation to CO2."
[3] "We therefore anticipated that O2 activation should be initiated by CH activation. Indeed, our operando spectroscopic results showed that BO(H) formation was accompanied by an induction phase of C2H6 activation and that it was these BO(H) sites that served as the active sites for the ODH ethane; as such, unprecedented selectivity for ethylene without CO2 formation under the weak oxidation conditions was found."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the utilization of boron nitride (BN) materials. Specifically, the arm-chair BN edge structure is proposed to activate oxygen (O2) onsite, leading to the formation of a B-O-O-N intermediate, which facilitates the cleavage of the non-terminal carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond in propane. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that the BOH group within BN is responsible for hydrogen abstraction from propane to form propene, while simultaneously preventing overoxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). The hypothesis is that the activation of CH bonds initiates the activation of O2, resulting in the formation of BO(H) sites. These sites serve as active catalysts during the ODHP reaction, allowing for the exclusive formation of ethylene without the formation of CO2 under mild oxidation conditions.

开发硼基催化剂中二维分散活性位点用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应，涉及利用硼氮化物（BN）材料。具体而言，臂椅型BN边缘结构被提议用于现场激活氧（O2），导致形成B-O-O-N中间体，从而促进丙烷中非端基碳-氢（CH）键的断裂。基于光谱证据，BN中的BOH组分负责从丙烷抽象氢原子以形成丙烯，并同时防止过氧化为二氧化碳（CO2）。假设是，通过CH键的活化引发O2的活化，导致形成BO(H)位点。这些位点作为催化活性中心，在ODHP反应中发挥作用，允许在温和氧化条件下仅生成乙烯而不形成CO2。
