[1] "Very recently, the advent of boron nitride for the selective ODH of propane confirmed the exciting opportunity of BN catalysts for controllable aliphatic CH activation; the arm-chair BN edge was proposed to activate O2 onsite to form a B-O-O-N intermediate on the basis of calculations, and thereby the rupture of the nonterminal CH of propane ensued."
[2] "A follow-up study noted that on the basis of spectroscopic evidence, the BOH group in boron nitride was responsible for hydrogen abstraction of propane to propene and that this group simultaneously prevented overoxidation to CO2."
[3] "We therefore anticipated that O2 activation should be initiated by CH activation. Indeed, our operando spectroscopic results showed that BO(H) formation was accompanied by an induction phase of C2H6 activation and that it was these BO(H) sites that served as the active sites for the ODH ethane; as such, unprecedented selectivity for ethylene without CO2 formation under the weak oxidation conditions was found."
[4] "The active sites of BO(H) are formed at the BN edges by the aid of ethane, and the formed BO sites can abstract a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2."

These 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction through the utilization of boron nitride (BN) materials. Specifically, the arm-chair BN edge is proposed to activate oxygen (O2) onsite to form a B-O-O-N intermediate, leading to the cleavage of the non-terminal carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond in propane. This process allows for the selective formation of propene without the overoxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2).

The advantages of these 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites in boron-based catalysts primarily lie in the higher density of active sites. The unique structural features of the arm-chair BN edges enhance the surface area available for reactions, thereby increasing the catalytic performance and efficiency. These structural characteristics have attracted significant research interest due to their potential for improving the selectivity and productivity in the ODHP reaction.

These findings provide insights into the mechanism of the ODHP reaction and guide the rational design of catalysts. The ability to activate oxygen without dissociation, along with the formation of active BO(H) sites facilitated by ethane, enables the exclusive production of olefins from paraffins. This work lays a foundation for the development of more efficient catalysts for the production of olefins from paraffin.

这些基于硼的催化剂上的二维分散活性位点通过利用硼氮化物（BN）材料，为丙烷的氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）开发。具体而言，臂椅状BN边缘被提议在原位激活氧气（O2），形成B-O-O-N中间体，导致丙烷中非末端碳-氢（CH）键的断裂。这一过程允许选择性地形成丙烯而不发生过氧化生成二氧化碳（CO2）。

与线性分散边界的硼基催化剂相比，这些二维分散活性位点的主要优势在于活性位点密度更高。臂椅状BN边缘的独特结构特征增加了可用于反应的表面积，从而提高催化性能和效率。这些结构特性引起了研究者的广泛关注，因为它们有可能改善ODHP反应的选择性和生产力。

这些发现提供了ODHP反应机制的见解，并指导了催化剂的理性设计。能够不分解氧激活以及由乙烷促进形成活性BO（H）位点的能力，使得从正构烷烃选择性生产烯烃成为可能。这项工作为从正构烷烃生产烯烃提供了新的途径，并为更高效的催化剂的发展奠定了基础。
