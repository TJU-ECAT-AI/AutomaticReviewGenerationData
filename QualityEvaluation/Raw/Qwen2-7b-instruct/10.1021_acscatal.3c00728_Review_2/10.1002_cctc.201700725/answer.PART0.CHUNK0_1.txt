[1] "Very recently, the advent of boron nitride for the selective ODH of propane confirmed the exciting opportunity of BN catalysts for controllable aliphatic CH activation; the arm-chair BN edge was proposed to activate O2 onsite to form a B-O-O-N intermediate on the basis of calculations, and thereby the rupture of the nonterminal CH of propane ensued."
[2] "A follow-up study noted that on the basis of spectroscopic evidence, the BOH group in boron nitride was responsible for hydrogen abstraction of propane to propene and that this group simultaneously prevented overoxidation to CO2."
[3] "We therefore anticipated that O2 activation should be initiated by CH activation. Indeed, our operando spectroscopic results showed that BO(H) formation was accompanied by an induction phase of C2H6 activation and that it was these BO(H) sites that served as the active sites for the ODH ethane; as such, unprecedented selectivity for ethylene without CO2 formation under the weak oxidation conditions was found."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the utilization of arm-chair BN edges. These edges are strategically positioned to activate O2 onsite, forming a B-O-O-N intermediate, which facilitates the rupture of the nonterminal CH bond in propane. The BOH group within the boron nitride structure plays a crucial role in hydrogen abstraction, transforming propane into propene while simultaneously preventing overoxidation to CO2. The active sites for the ODHP reaction are BO(H) sites, which emerge during the induction phase of propane activation. These sites enable the exclusive production of propene without the formation of CO2, showcasing the unique advantages of boron-based catalysts over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance.

对于丙烷的氧化脱氢反应（ODHP），硼基催化剂中二维分散活性位点的发展利用了臂椅BN边缘。这些边缘被策略性地定位以在原位激活O2，形成B-O-O-N中间体，从而促进非末端CH键的断裂。BOH组分在硼氮化物结构内部扮演关键角色，负责氢提取，将丙烷转化为丙烯，并同时防止过度氧化生成CO2。ODHP反应中的活性位点是BO(H)位点，在丙烷激活的诱导阶段出现。这些位点能够实现丙烯的独家生产，而不会形成CO2，这展示了与线性边缘位点相比，硼基催化剂在活性位点密度和催化性能方面的独特优势。
