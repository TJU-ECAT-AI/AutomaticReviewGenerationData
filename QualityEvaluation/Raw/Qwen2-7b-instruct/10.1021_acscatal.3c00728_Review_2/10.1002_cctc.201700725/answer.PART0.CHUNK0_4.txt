[1] "Very recently, the advent of boron nitride for the selective ODH of propane confirmed the exciting opportunity of BN catalysts for controllable aliphatic CH activation; the arm-chair BN edge was proposed to activate O2 onsite to form a B-O-O-N intermediate on the basis of calculations, and thereby the rupture of the nonterminal CH of propane ensued."
[2] "A follow-up study noted that on the basis of spectroscopic evidence, the BOH group in boron nitride was responsible for hydrogen abstraction of propane to propene and that this group simultaneously prevented overoxidation to CO2."
[3] "We therefore anticipated that O2 activation should be initiated by CH activation. Indeed, our operando spectroscopic results showed that BO(H) formation was accompanied by an induction phase of C2H6 activation and that it was these BO(H) sites that served as the active sites for the ODH ethane."
[4] "Our observations with operando spectroscopy offered important messages towards the understanding of the ODH reaction and the rational design of catalysts, particularly those of the nonmetal category: O2 adsorption but not dissociation is key to a combustion-free paraffin ODH reaction."
[5] "The active sites of BO(H) are formed at the BN edges by the aid of ethane, and the formed BO sites can abstract a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2."

1. For the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are developed through the utilization of arm-chair BN edges. These edges are strategically positioned to activate O2 locally, facilitating the formation of a B-O-O-N intermediate. This process enables the cleavage of the non-terminal C-H bond in propane, resulting in the production of propene. The BOH group within boron nitride plays a crucial role in hydrogen abstraction from propane, simultaneously preventing overoxidation to CO2. 

2. The development of these 2-D dispersed active sites offers several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. Firstly, the increased density of active sites leads to enhanced catalytic performance due to a higher number of available sites for reactant adsorption and product formation. Secondly, the localized activation of O2 and subsequent hydrogen abstraction from propane at the BN edges ensures a controlled and efficient conversion process, minimizing the risk of overoxidation and CO2 emissions. This makes the boron nitride-based catalysts particularly suitable for combustion-free paraffin ODH reactions.

3. The unique structural features of boron nitride, including its 2-D dispersion and arm-chair edges, have attracted significant research interest due to their potential for achieving selective and efficient activation of aliphatic C-H bonds. These features enable the precise control of O2 activation and the subsequent hydrogen abstraction, leading to the selective production of olefins from paraffins. The rational design of catalysts based on these principles holds promise for the development of more sustainable and environmentally friendly processes for olefin production.

1. 对于丙烷的氧化脱氢反应（ODHP），硼基催化剂中2-D分散的活性位点通过利用BN的臂椅边缘来开发。这些边缘被战略性地定位，以在本地激活O2，促进B-O-O-N中间体的形成。这一过程使非端基C-H键在丙烷中的断裂成为可能，从而产生丙烯。BN中的BOH组分在丙烷的氢抽象中发挥关键作用，同时防止过氧化导致CO2的生成。

2. 这些2-D分散的活性位点相较于线性边缘位点具有多个优势。首先，活性位点的高密度导致催化性能的增强，由于可用的吸附和产物形成位点数量增加。其次，BN边缘处的局部O2激活和随后的丙烷氢抽象确保了可控且高效的转换过程，最大限度地减少了过氧化和CO2排放的风险。这使得硼氮化物基催化剂特别适合无燃烧的石蜡氧化脱氢反应。

3. 硼氮化物的独特结构特征，包括其2-D分散性和臂椅边缘，吸引了大量研究兴趣，因为它们有可能实现对直链C-H键的精确控制。这些特性允许精确控制O2激活并随后进行氢抽象，从而实现从石蜡到烯烃的有选择性的生产。基于这些原则的催化剂设计的合理化为更可持续和环境友好的过程开发提供了希望，用于烯烃生产。
