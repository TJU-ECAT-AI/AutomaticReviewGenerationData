[1] "Very recently, the advent of boron nitride for the selective ODH of propane confirmed the exciting opportunity of BN catalysts for controllable aliphatic CH activation; the arm-chair BN edge was proposed to activate O2 onsite to form a B-O-O-N intermediate on the basis of calculations, and thereby the rupture of the nonterminal CH of propane ensued."
[2] "A follow-up study noted that on the basis of spectroscopic evidence, the BOH group in boron nitride was responsible for hydrogen abstraction of propane to propene and that this group simultaneously prevented overoxidation to CO2."
[3] "We therefore anticipated that O2 activation should be initiated by CH activation. Indeed, our operando spectroscopic results showed that BO(H) formation was accompanied by an induction phase of C2H6 activation and that it was these BO(H) sites that served as the active sites for the ODH ethane; as such, unprecedented selectivity for ethylene without CO2 formation under the weak oxidation conditions was found."
[4] "The active sites of BO(H) are formed at the BN edges by the aid of ethane, and the formed BO sites can abstract a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2."

These 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction through the utilization of boron nitride (BN) materials. Specifically, the arm-chair BN edge is proposed to activate oxygen (O2) onsite to form a B-O-O-N intermediate, leading to the cleavage of the non-terminal carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond in propane. This process allows for the selective formation of propene without the overoxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2).

The advantages of these 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites in boron-based catalysts primarily lie in the higher density of active sites. The unique structural features of the arm-chair BN edges enhance the surface area available for reactions, thereby increasing the catalytic performance and efficiency. These structural characteristics have attracted significant research interest due to their potential for improving the selectivity and productivity in the ODHP reaction.

These findings provide insights into the mechanism of the ODHP reaction and guide the rational design of catalysts. The ability to activate oxygen without dissociation, along with the formation of active BO(H) sites facilitated by ethane, enables the exclusive production of olefins from paraffins. This work lays a foundation for the development of more efficient catalysts for the production of olefins from paraffin.

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the utilization of arm-chair BN edges. These edges are strategically positioned to activate O2 onsite, forming a B-O-O-N intermediate, which facilitates the rupture of the nonterminal CH bond in propane. The BOH group within the boron nitride structure plays a crucial role in hydrogen abstraction, transforming propane into propene while simultaneously preventing overoxidation to CO2. The active sites for the ODHP reaction are BO(H) sites, which emerge during the induction phase of propane activation. These sites enable the exclusive production of propene without the formation of CO2, showcasing the unique advantages of boron-based catalysts over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance.

1. Two-dimensional dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) are developed through the utilization of arm-chair boron nitride (BN) edges. These edges are proposed to activate oxygen (O2) on-site to form a B-O-O-N intermediate, facilitating the cleavage of the non-terminal carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond in propane. Spectroscopic evidence supports the involvement of the BOH group in the hydrogen abstraction process, ensuring the formation of propene without overoxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2).

2. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts offer a higher density of active sites, which translates to enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed sites enable more efficient and controlled activation of aliphatic CH bonds, resulting in improved selectivity for desired products like olefins.

3. The research interest in these unique structural features stems from the potential for developing more efficient and selective catalysts for aliphatic hydrocarbon activation. The ability to control the cleavage of CH bonds without unwanted side reactions, such as overoxidation to CO2, represents a significant advancement in the field of catalysis.

1. For the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are developed through the utilization of arm-chair BN edges. These edges are strategically positioned to activate O2 locally, facilitating the formation of a B-O-O-N intermediate. This process enables the cleavage of the non-terminal C-H bond in propane, resulting in the production of propene. The BOH group within boron nitride plays a crucial role in hydrogen abstraction from propane, simultaneously preventing overoxidation to CO2. 

2. The development of these 2-D dispersed active sites offers several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. Firstly, the increased density of active sites leads to enhanced catalytic performance due to a higher number of available sites for reactant adsorption and product formation. Secondly, the localized activation of O2 and subsequent hydrogen abstraction from propane at the BN edges ensures a controlled and efficient conversion process, minimizing the risk of overoxidation and CO2 emissions. This makes the boron nitride-based catalysts particularly suitable for combustion-free paraffin ODH reactions.

3. The unique structural features of boron nitride, including its 2-D dispersion and arm-chair edges, have attracted significant research interest due to their potential for achieving selective and efficient activation of aliphatic C-H bonds. These features enable the precise control of O2 activation and the subsequent hydrogen abstraction, leading to the selective production of olefins from paraffins. The rational design of catalysts based on these principles holds promise for the development of more sustainable and environmentally friendly processes for olefin production.

3. 硼氮化物的独特结构特征，包括其2-D分散性和臂椅边缘，吸引了大量研究兴趣，因为它们有可能实现对直链C-H键的精确控制。这些特性允许精确控制O2激活并随后进行氢抽象，从而实现从石蜡到烯烃的有选择性的生产。基于这些原则的催化剂设计的合理化为更可持续和环境友好的过程开发提供了希望，用于烯烃生产。
