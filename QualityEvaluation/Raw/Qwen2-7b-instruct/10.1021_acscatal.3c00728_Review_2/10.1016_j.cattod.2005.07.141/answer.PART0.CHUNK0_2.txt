<p>The catalysts were characterized by SEM, TEM, X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption and temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR).</p>
<p>CNF itself is an effective catalyst for ODP, but the high propene yield can only be achieved at high reaction temperature, which would cause CNF gasification.</p>
<p>CNF-supported phosphoric oxides can operate at 500 C without gasification and a 39.63% propene selectivity could be reached at a 42.07% propane conversion.</p>
<p>Carbonyl-like groups on the CNF surface could be the active sites for ODP.</p>

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) involves utilizing the unique structural features of boron that allow for the dispersion of active sites in a two-dimensional pattern. This differs from the linearly dispersed edge sites commonly found in other catalysts, offering a higher density of active sites per unit area. The higher density of active sites enhances the catalytic performance, leading to more efficient conversion rates and product yields. These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest due to their potential to improve the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process, which is crucial for enhancing the economic viability and environmental impact of propane-to-propylene conversion technologies.
