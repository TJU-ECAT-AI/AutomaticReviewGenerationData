1. "Carbon nanofibers (CNF) and CNF-supported phosphoric oxides were tested as the catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP)."
2. "When most of the problems related to the synthesis of large amounts of these nanostructures are solved or almost solved, a large field of research is open to these materials with fascinating characteristics."
3. "That is because the phosphoric oxides are amorphous."
4. "These structures are also thought to be responsible for catalytic redox reaction on carbon surface."
5. "But high reaction temperature and O2/C3H8 ration is also benefit for CNF gasification, which limits achieve higher propene yields on CNF catalysts."
6. "A 39.63% propene selectivity could finally be reached at a 42.07% propane conversion over CNF-supported 5 wt% phosphoric oxides catalysts."

1. Carbon nanofibers and CNF-supported phosphoric oxides were evaluated as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
2. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the strategic arrangement of active sites across the material's surface, offering higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. This enhanced density improves catalytic performance due to increased accessibility and reactivity of the active sites, leading to more efficient conversion rates.
3. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest because they enable a higher concentration of active sites, potentially resulting in superior catalytic activity and efficiency in ODHP reactions.
4. High reaction temperatures and oxygen-to-propane ratio facilitate both the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to produce propene and the gasification of carbon nanofibers, which limits the ability to achieve higher propene yields on CNF catalysts.
5. The phosphoric oxides on the CNF surface inhibit propane over-oxidative reactions, enabling the catalyst to operate at 500°C without causing gasification and preventing propane from undergoing excessive oxidative reactions.
6. CNF-supported 5 wt% phosphoric oxides catalysts achieved a 39.63% propene selectivity at a 42.07% propane conversion, demonstrating the effectiveness of these materials in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
