[1] "CNF itself is an effective catalyst for ODP, but the high propene yield can only be achieved at high reaction temperature, which would cause CNF gasification."
[2] "Phosphoric oxides could tailor the density of surface oxygen complexes on CNF surface, which are active sites for ODP and CNF gasification."
[3] "A 39.63% propene selectivity could finally be reached at a 42.07% propane conversion over CNF-supported 5 wt% phosphoric oxides catalysts."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) involves creating a surface structure that allows for a higher density of active sites compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. These unique structural features enable more efficient utilization of the active sites, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. The specific advantages include increased surface area for reaction sites, better control over the distribution of active sites, and improved resistance to sintering. These features have attracted significant research interest due to their potential to improve the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process.
