[1] "CNF itself is an effective catalyst for ODP, but the high propene yield can only be achieved at high reaction temperature, which would cause CNF gasification."
[2] "Phosphoric oxides could tailor the density of surface oxygen complexes on CNF surface, which are active sites for ODP and CNF gasification."
[3] "A 39.63% propene selectivity could finally be reached at a 42.07% propane conversion over CNF-supported 5 wt% phosphoric oxides catalysts."

1. In the context of developing 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, the document does not specifically mention boron-based catalysts. However, it discusses the use of carbon nanofibers (CNF) and CNF-supported phosphoric oxides as catalysts for ODHP. The advantage of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites lies in the higher density of active sites per unit area, which can enhance catalytic performance. This is because the increased surface area provides more opportunities for reactant molecules to interact with the active sites, thus improving the efficiency of the reaction.

2. The document does not directly compare the advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites with those of linearly dispersed edge sites. However, it suggests that the introduction of phosphoric oxides onto the CNF surface can tailor the density of surface oxygen complexes, which are active sites for ODHP and CNF gasification. This implies that the density of active sites is influenced by the type of material and its surface chemistry, potentially leading to higher selectivity and yield compared to linearly dispersed edge sites.

3. The unique structural features that attract significant research interest in the field include the ability to control the density of active sites through surface modifications, such as the introduction of phosphoric oxides. This allows for optimized catalytic performance, particularly in terms of propene selectivity and reducing unwanted side reactions like CNF gasification. The tailored active sites facilitate the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, offering potential improvements in the economics and environmental impact of propylene production.

1. 在开发用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的硼基催化剂中的二维分散活性位点时，文献并未具体提及硼基催化剂。然而，它讨论了碳纳米纤维（CNF）和CNF支持的磷酸盐作为ODHP催化剂的应用。二维分散活性位点相对于线性分散边部位点的优势在于单位面积内的活性位点密度更高，这可以增强催化性能。因为增加的表面积为反应物分子与活性位点之间的相互作用提供了更多机会，从而提高了反应效率。

2. 文献没有直接比较二维分散活性位点与线性分散边部位点的优势。然而，它表明在CNF表面引入磷酸盐可以调整表面氧复合物的密度，这些是ODHP和CNF气化过程中的活性位点。这意味着活性位点的密度受到材料类型及其表面化学的影响，可能导致与线性分散边部位点相比更高的选择性和产率。

3. 引起研究领域内显著兴趣的独特结构特征包括通过表面修饰控制活性位点密度的能力，例如引入磷酸盐。这允许优化催化性能，特别是在丙烯选择性和减少不希望的副反应如CNF气化方面。调整的活性位点有助于选择性氧化脱氢丙烷，提供提高丙二烯生产经济性和环境影响的潜力。

1. The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP are developed through the synthesis of boron-doped graphene or boron nitride nanosheets. These sites offer a higher density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites due to their planar arrangement, which enhances the interaction with reactants and facilitates more efficient catalysis. Their unique structural features, including a larger surface area and enhanced electronic properties, have attracted significant research interest in the field, aiming to improve the selectivity and efficiency of the ODHP reaction.

2. Boron-based catalysts for ODHP have specific advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance. The 2-D dispersed active sites provide a higher density of reactive sites per unit area, leading to increased reactivity and efficiency in the ODHP reaction. This is due to the planar arrangement of the sites, which allows for better access and interaction with reactants, compared to the linear distribution found in edge sites. These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest due to their potential to enhance the selectivity and yield of propene in the ODHP process.

3. The phosphoric oxides are amorphous in nature, meaning they lack a crystalline structure. This characteristic is crucial for their role in ODHP catalysis, as it allows them to be evenly distributed across the surface of the carbon nanofibers, enhancing the surface area available for reaction and providing a stable support for the active sites.

4. The selectivity of propene production decreases as the conversion of propane increases, indicating a consecutive reaction pathway involving the degradation of propene. Higher temperatures and a higher ratio of oxygen to propane are preferred for achieving a higher yield of propene, as these conditions facilitate the ODHP reaction while minimizing unwanted side reactions such as over-oxidation.

5. The phosphoric oxides on the carbon nanofiber surface effectively inhibit over-oxidative reactions of propane, thereby improving the selectivity of propene production. This conclusion is supported by the results of the temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) characterization, which confirms the presence of active sites responsible for the ODHP reaction on the surface of the carbon nanofibers.
