[1] "When most of the problems related to the synthesis of large amounts of these nanostructures are solved or almost solved, a large field of research is open to these materials with fascinating characteristics."
[2] "As for ODH, Schlgl and co-workers studied catalytic performances of multi-walled nanotube and onion-like carbon for ethylbenzene oxidative dehydrogenation (ODE), where styrene selectivity of 68% allowed high styrene yields of 62%."
[3] "That is because the phosphoric oxides are amorphous."
[4] "The C3H6 selectivity decreases with the increase of C3H8 conversion, which implies consecutive reaction of C3H6 degradation."

1. The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP are developed through the synthesis of boron-doped graphene or boron nitride nanosheets. These sites offer a higher density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites due to their planar arrangement, which enhances the interaction with reactants and facilitates more efficient catalysis. Their unique structural features, including a larger surface area and enhanced electronic properties, have attracted significant research interest in the field, aiming to improve the selectivity and efficiency of the ODHP reaction.

2. Boron-based catalysts for ODHP have specific advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance. The 2-D dispersed active sites provide a higher density of reactive sites per unit area, leading to increased reactivity and efficiency in the ODHP reaction. This is due to the planar arrangement of the sites, which allows for better access and interaction with reactants, compared to the linear distribution found in edge sites. These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest due to their potential to enhance the selectivity and yield of propene in the ODHP process.

3. The phosphoric oxides are amorphous in nature, meaning they lack a crystalline structure. This characteristic is crucial for their role in ODHP catalysis, as it allows them to be evenly distributed across the surface of the carbon nanofibers, enhancing the surface area available for reaction and providing a stable support for the active sites.

4. The selectivity of propene production decreases as the conversion of propane increases, indicating a consecutive reaction pathway involving the degradation of propene. Higher temperatures and a higher ratio of oxygen to propane are preferred for achieving a higher yield of propene, as these conditions facilitate the ODHP reaction while minimizing unwanted side reactions such as over-oxidation.

5. The phosphoric oxides on the carbon nanofiber surface effectively inhibit over-oxidative reactions of propane, thereby improving the selectivity of propene production. This conclusion is supported by the results of the temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) characterization, which confirms the presence of active sites responsible for the ODHP reaction on the surface of the carbon nanofibers.
