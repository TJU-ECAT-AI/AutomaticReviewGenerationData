The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional structure with active sites spread throughout the material. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. Firstly, they significantly increase the active site density, leading to enhanced catalytic performance due to more direct contact with reactants. Secondly, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest because they enable better control over the reaction pathways, potentially leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process. The antioxidant ability of the silicon boride catalyst ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to its effectiveness in the ODHP process.
