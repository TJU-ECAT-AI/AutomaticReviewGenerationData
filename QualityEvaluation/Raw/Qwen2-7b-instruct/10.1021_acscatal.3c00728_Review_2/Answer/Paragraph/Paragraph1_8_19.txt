        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.jmmm.2003.12.918], synthesizing understanding from [10.1016/S0167-2991(98)80509-0], [10.1016/0926-860X(95)00273-1], and [10.1016/j.surfcoat.2005.02.164]. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional structure with active sites spread throughout the material, offering advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance.

        These 2-D dispersed sites significantly increase the active site density, leading to enhanced catalytic performance due to more direct contact with reactants. Their unique structural features attract significant research interest, as they enable better control over the reaction pathways, potentially leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process. Specifically, compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed sites offer a higher density of active sites, which potentially enhances the catalytic performance.

        The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites, such as their flat surface and well-defined edges, contribute significantly to enhanced catalytic performance by facilitating better interaction with reactants and promoting more effective conversion rates. This improvement in efficiency and selectivity makes these structures highly attractive for research and development in the field of chemical catalysis.

        Research interest in these structures is attributed to their potential for improving efficiency and selectivity in the ODHP reaction, particularly in the production of propylene with minimal formation of CO2. The antioxidant ability of the silicon boride catalyst ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to its effectiveness in the ODHP process. Moreover, the study on metal-free silicon boride may make a better understanding on the catalytic origin of the boron species, and further initiate the exploration of other new boron-based catalysts.

        The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction is an area of significant research interest. These sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites due to their higher active site density, which leads to enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed sites contribute to enhanced catalytic performance, making them highly attractive for research and development in the field of chemical catalysis.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook suggest an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing new boron-based catalysts with improved properties, optimizing the synthesis methods for 2-D dispersed active sites, and investigating the role of boron species in the catalytic origin of these structures. This could lead to more efficient and selective catalysts for the ODHP reaction, with applications in the production of valuable chemical intermediates.
