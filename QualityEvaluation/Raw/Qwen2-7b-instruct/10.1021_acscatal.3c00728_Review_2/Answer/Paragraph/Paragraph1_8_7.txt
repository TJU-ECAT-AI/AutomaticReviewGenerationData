        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.jmmm.2003.12.918]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/S0167-2991(98)80509-0] and [10.1016/0926-860X(95)00273-1]. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional structure with active sites spread throughout the material. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including a higher density of active sites which enhances catalytic performance through more direct contact with reactants. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential for achieving high selectivity in the ODHP reaction, particularly in the production of propylene with minimal formation of CO2. The antioxidant ability of the silicon boride catalyst ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to its effectiveness in the ODHP process.

        The recent discovery that antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for the oxidative dehydrogenation process of ethane and propane opens up a new research direction in selective cleavage of the CH bond of alkanes by a metal-free catalyst. It consequently expands the fundamental understanding of the industrially important ODHP process. Spectroscopic investigation suggests that borohydride (BOH) groups generated from boron oxide (BO) species with the assistance of steam might be the active sites responsible for selectively breaking the CH bond but simultaneously shutting off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2. In the following up study, Su et al. proposed that borohydride (BOH) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. Recently, boron nitride can also oxidize methane to valuable products, and carbon-doped BN catalyst showed good activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene. People in different groups identified that the boron species could be truly indispensable for high ODHP activity.

        Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriched in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance properties at high temperatures and could be a potential catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. Study on the metal-free silicon boride may make a better understanding on the catalytic origin of the boron species, and further initiate the exploration of other new boron-based catalysts. Based on spectra and dynamics analysis, it is supported that the catalytic origin of the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiates the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

        The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction has been an area of significant research interest. These sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites due to their higher active site density, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.

        The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through advanced synthesis methods that ensure uniform distribution across a two-dimensional plane. These sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites because they provide a higher density of active sites per unit area, leading to increased catalytic activity and efficiency. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed sites, such as their flat surface and well-defined edges, contribute significantly to enhanced catalytic performance by facilitating better interaction with reactants and promoting more effective conversion rates. This improvement in efficiency and selectivity makes these structures highly attractive for research and development in the field of chemical catalysis.

        Boron oxide catalysts supported on alumina have been prepared with boria loadings in the range 020 wt.-%. The surface areas of the samples decreased as the boria loading was increased. All catalysts tested for the rearrangement reaction diminished in activity with time-onstream. There was a direct relationship between the amount of coke which formed on the surface and the loss in catalytic activity. This loss was least for the highest boron oxide loading tested, and this catalyst also featured the least amount of coke formation. Selectivity to caprolactam was associated with the presence of surface acidic sites of intermediate strength. A correlation was observed between the concentration of these surface sites and the selectivity to caprolactam.
