They share similar strengths and weaknesses, particularly in terms of topic relevance, comprehensiveness, accuracy, structure, organization, academic standards, innovation, contribution, methodology assessment, timeliness, and writing quality. Both reviews suggest potential future research directions, propose feasible practical applications, and recognize the limitations of their studies. However, they could benefit from more detailed methodological descriptions, clearer identification of interdisciplinary perspectives, and more comprehensive multi-angle analysis. Neither review stands out significantly over the other in any particular aspect."
