        The development, methods, and advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction have been extensively studied and attract significant research interest due to their unique structural features and superior catalytic performance. These 2-D dispersed sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, notably a higher density of active sites, which leads to enhanced catalytic performance. This increased density results from the two-dimensional structure that allows for more direct contact between the active sites and reactants, thereby improving both the adsorption and desorption processes.

        The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites contribute to enhanced catalytic performance by enabling better control over the reaction pathways. This leads to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process, especially in the production of propylene with minimal formation of CO2. The antioxidant ability of silicon boride catalysts ensures the stability of the reaction, making them highly effective in the ODHP process. Moreover, the boron species in these catalysts are considered indispensable for achieving high ODH activity.

        The study of metal-free silicon boride catalysts further enhances our understanding of the catalytic origin of boron species, initiating the exploration of other new boron-based catalysts. Based on spectral and dynamic analyses, it is found that the borohydride (BOH) groups generated from boron oxide (BO) species with the assistance of steam serve as the active sites in the ODHP reaction. This work supports the idea that the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiates the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

        In terms of the research methods, boron oxide catalysts supported on alumina have been prepared with varying boria loadings. It is observed that as the boria loading increases, the surface area decreases, affecting the catalytic activity over time. High boria loadings result in less coke formation, maintaining better activity and efficiency. The presence of surface acidic sites of intermediate strength correlates with the selectivity towards caprolactam, influencing the overall reaction efficiency.

        In conclusion, the development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction has been a focus of recent research efforts, demonstrating significant advantages in terms of active site density, enhanced catalytic performance, and improved selectivity and efficiency. The unique structural features of these sites have attracted considerable research interest, contributing to the advancement of the field of chemical catalysis and opening up new possibilities for the production of valuable chemical intermediates.
