Boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through creating a two-dimensional structure where active sites are dispersed throughout, offering higher density and enhanced catalytic performance compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential for achieving high selectivity in the ODHP reaction, particularly in the production of propylene, with minimal formation of CO2. The antioxidant ability of the silicon boride catalyst ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to its effectiveness in the ODHP process. This structure facilitates better interaction with reactants and promotes more effective conversion rates, making these sites highly attractive for research and development in the field of chemical catalysis.

        The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a highly ordered two-dimensional structure with active sites spread out across the surface. These sites provide several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including increased active site density which enhances catalytic performance through more direct contact with reactants. Additionally, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential to enable better control over reaction pathways, leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process.

        2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through recent research efforts. These sites offer higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, leading to improved catalytic performance due to increased surface area for reactant adsorption and product desorption. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites have attracted significant research interest because they enable more efficient use of catalysts and potentially reduce energy consumption during the ODHP process.

        Based on spectra and dynamics analysis, the BOH groups generated from the BO species with the assistance of steam might be catalytic activity sites. This work experimentally supports that the catalytic origin of the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiates the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The recent discovery that antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for the ODH process of ethane and propane opens up a new research direction in selective cleavage of CH bond of alkanes by metal-free catalysts, expanding the fundamental understanding of the industrially important ODH process.

        The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional structure where the active sites are distributed throughout the material. The recent discovery that antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for the ODH process of ethane and propane opens up a new research direction in selective cleavage of CH bond of alkanes by the metal-free catalyst. It consequently expands the fundamental understanding of the industrially important ODH process. Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2. In the following up study, Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction. Recently, it was shown that boron nitride can also oxidize methane to valuable products. Moreover, Xie and coworkers demonstrated that carbon-doped BN catalyst showed good activity in the ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene. Anyhow, people in different groups identified with the idea that the boron species could be truly indispensable element for high ODH activity. Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for the ODH of light alkanes. Study on the metal-free silicon boride may make a better understanding on the catalytic origin of the boron species, and further initiate the exploration of other new boron-based catalysts.
