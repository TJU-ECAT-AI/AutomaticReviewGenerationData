The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional structure with active sites spread throughout the material. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including increased active site density which enhances catalytic performance through more direct contact with reactants, and unique structural features that attract significant research interest due to their potential for achieving high selectivity in the ODHP reaction, particularly in the production of propylene with minimal formation of CO2. The antioxidant ability of silicon boride catalysts ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to their effectiveness in the ODHP process.

        The unique 2-D dispersed active sites offer a higher density of active sites, leading to enhanced catalytic performance due to increased surface area for reactant adsorption and product desorption. The unique structural features of these sites have attracted significant research interest due to their potential for improving efficiency and selectivity in the ODHP process, which is crucial for the production of valuable chemical intermediates.

        Specifically, these 2-D dispersed sites offer a significant advantage in terms of active site density, which leads to enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites contribute to enhanced catalytic performance by facilitating better interaction with reactants and promoting more effective conversion rates. This improvement in efficiency and selectivity makes these structures highly attractive for research and development in the field of chemical catalysis.

        Research interest in these structures is attributed to their potential for improving efficiency and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction has been an area of significant research interest. These sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites due to their higher active site density, leading to improved catalytic performance.

        The recent discovery that antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for the ODH process of ethane and propane opens up a new research direction in selective cleavage of CH bond of alkanes by the metal-free catalyst. It consequently expands the fundamental understanding of the industrially important ODH process. Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2. In the following up study, Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction. Recently, we showed that boron nitride can also oxidize methane to valuable products. Moreover, Xie and coworkers demonstrated that carbon-doped BN catalyst showed good activity in the ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene.

        Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for the ODH of light alkanes. Study on the metal-free silicon boride may make a better understanding on the catalytic origin of the boron species, and further initiate the exploration of other new boron-based catalysts. Based on spectra and dynamics analysis, the BOH groups generated from the BO species with the assistance of steam might be catalytic activity sites. This work experimentally supports that the catalytic origin of the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiate the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on refining the synthesis methods for 2-D dispersed active sites, optimizing their structural features for enhanced catalytic performance, and investigating their application in other alkane dehydrogenation reactions to broaden the scope of their industrial utility. The development of boron-based catalysts with 2-D dispersed active sites represents a promising avenue for the advancement of chemical catalysis, particularly in the context of the ODHP reaction, offering a sustainable solution for the production of valuable chemical intermediates.
