        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.jmmm.2003.12.918]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/S0167-2991(98)80509-0], [10.1016/0926-860X(95)00273-1], [10.1016/j.surfcoat.2005.02.164], and [10.1021/acscatal.9b04558]. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional structure with active sites spread throughout the material. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including a higher density of active sites, which leads to enhanced catalytic performance through more direct contact with reactants. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites, such as their flat surface and well-defined edges, contribute significantly to enhanced catalytic performance by facilitating better interaction with reactants and promoting more effective conversion rates. This improvement in efficiency and selectivity makes these structures highly attractive for research and development in the field of chemical catalysis.

        The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through creating a highly ordered two-dimensional structure with active sites spread out across the surface. These sites provide several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including increased active site density which enhances catalytic performance through more direct contact with reactants. Additionally, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential to enable better control over reaction pathways, leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process. The antioxidant ability of the silicon boride catalyst ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to its effectiveness in the ODHP process.

        Recent discoveries have expanded the fundamental understanding of the industrially important ODHP process. Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2. In the following up study, Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction. Moreover, studies have shown that boron nitride can oxidize methane to valuable products, and carbon-doped BN catalyst showed good activity in ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene. People in different groups identified with the idea that the boron species could be truly indispensable elements for high ODH activity.

        The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites have attracted significant research interest due to their potential for achieving high selectivity in the ODHP reaction, particularly in the production of propylene, with minimal formation of CO2. The antioxidant ability of the silicon boride catalyst ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to its effectiveness in the ODHP process.

        The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction involves the formation of boron oxide (BO) species on the surface of the catalyst. These BO species can generate borohydride (BOH) groups with the assistance of steam, which are believed to be the active sites responsible for the cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond in propane. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed sites offer a higher density of active sites, potentially enhancing the catalytic performance.

        Based on spectra and dynamics analysis, the BOH groups generated from the BO species with the assistance of steam might be catalytic activity sites. This work experimentally supports that the catalytic origin of the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiates the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on refining the synthesis of 2-D dispersed active sites, optimizing the conditions for their formation, and investigating the impact of various structural features on catalytic performance. The exploration of new boron-based catalysts with enhanced properties, such as improved selectivity and stability, could also be a fruitful direction. The integration of computational chemistry tools for predicting the behavior of 2-D dispersed active sites under different reaction conditions could further accelerate the development of efficient and sustainable catalysts for the ODHP reaction.
