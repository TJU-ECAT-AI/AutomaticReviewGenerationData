Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.jcat.2018.11.014], [10.1016/S0167-2991(98)80509-0], [10.1016/0926-860X(95)00273-1], [10.1016/j.surfcoat.2005.02.164], and [10.1021/acscatal.9b04558]. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional structure where the active sites are distributed throughout the material. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including increased active site density, which enhances catalytic performance through more direct contact with reactants, and unique structural features that attract significant research interest due to their potential for achieving high selectivity in the ODHP reaction, particularly in the production of propylene, with minimal formation of CO2. The antioxidant ability of the silicon boride catalyst ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to its effectiveness in the ODHP process.

        The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through creating a highly ordered two-dimensional structure with active sites spread out across the surface. These sites provide several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including increased active site density which enhances catalytic performance through more direct contact with reactants. Additionally, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential to enable better control over reaction pathways, leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process. This improvement in efficiency and selectivity makes these structures highly attractive for research and development in the field of chemical catalysis.

        Specifically, these 2-D dispersed sites offer a significant advantage in terms of active site density, which leads to enhanced catalytic performance due to an increased number of reactive surfaces. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites have attracted significant research interest because they promise improved efficiency and selectivity in the ODHP process, which is crucial for the production of valuable chemical intermediates. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction has been an area of significant research interest, as these sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites due to their higher active site density. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed sites contribute to enhanced catalytic performance, making them highly attractive for research and development in the field of chemical catalysis.

        The recent discovery that antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for the ODH process of ethane and propane opens up a new research direction in selective cleavage of the CH bond of alkanes by metal-free catalysts. It consequently expands the fundamental understanding of the industrially important ODHP process. Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2. In the following up study, Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction. Recently, it was shown that boron nitride can also oxidize methane to valuable products. Moreover, Xie and coworkers demonstrated that carbon-doped BN catalyst showed good activity in the ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene. Anyhow, people in different groups identified with the idea that the boron species could be truly indispensable elements for high ODH activity. Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for the ODH of light alkanes. Study on the metal-free silicon boride may make a better understanding on the catalytic origin of the boron species, and further initiate the exploration of other new boron-based catalysts.

        Based on spectra and dynamics analysis, the BOH groups generated from the BO species with the assistance of steam might be catalytic activity sites. This work experimentally supports that the catalytic origin of the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiates the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through creating a two-dimensional structure that allows for a higher density of active sites compared to traditional linearly dispersed edge sites. These 2-D sites offer a notable advantage in terms of active site density, leading to improved catalytic performance due to an increased number of reactive surfaces. The unique structural characteristics of 2-D dispersed active sites have garnered considerable research interest due to their potential to enhance efficiency and selectivity in the ODHP process, which is vital for the production of valuable chemical intermediates.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing more efficient and selective 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts, optimizing their synthesis conditions, and expanding their applications beyond the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to other alkane conversions. There is also potential to investigate the synergistic effects of combining different boron-based materials or doping strategies to further enhance catalytic activity and stability. The integration of advanced characterization techniques, such as in situ spectroscopy and operando studies, could provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and active site dynamics, guiding the rational design of next-generation boron-based catalysts for sustainable chemical processes.
