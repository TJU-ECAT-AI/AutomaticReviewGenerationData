        The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the formation of boron oxide (BO) species on the surface of the catalyst, which can generate borohydride (BOH) groups with the assistance of steam. These BOH groups are believed to be the active sites responsible for the cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond in propane. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed sites offer a higher density of active sites, potentially enhancing the catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed sites attract significant research interest due to their potential for achieving high selectivity in the ODHP reaction, particularly in the production of propylene, with minimal formation of CO2. The antioxidant ability of the silicon boride catalyst ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to its effectiveness in the ODHP process.

        These 2-D dispersed active sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. Firstly, they significantly increase the active site density, leading to enhanced catalytic performance due to more direct contact with reactants. Secondly, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest because they enable better control over the reaction pathways, potentially leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction has been an area of significant research interest. These sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites due to their higher active site density, leading to improved catalytic performance due to increased surface area for reactant adsorption and product desorption. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites have attracted significant research interest because they enable more efficient use of catalysts and potentially reduce energy consumption during the ODHP process.

        The recent discovery that antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for the ODH process of ethane and propane opens up a new research direction in selective cleavage of CH bond of alkanes by the metal-free catalyst. It consequently expands the fundamental understanding of the industrially important ODH process. Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2. In the following up study, Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction. Recently, we showed that boron nitride can also oxidize methane to valuable products. Moreover, Xie and coworkers demonstrated that carbon-doped BN catalyst showed good activity in ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene. Anyhow, people in different groups identified with the idea that the boron species could be truly indispensable elements for high ODH activity. Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for ODH of light alkanes. Study on the metal-free silicon boride may make a better understanding on the catalytic origin of the boron species, and further initiate the exploration of other new boron-based catalysts. Based on spectra and dynamics analysis, the BOH groups generated from the BO species with the assistance of steam might be catalytic activity sites. This work experimentally supports that the catalytic origin of the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiates the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

        The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through creating a highly ordered two-dimensional structure with active sites spread out across the surface. These sites provide several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including increased active site density which enhances catalytic performance through more direct contact with reactants. Additionally, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential to enable better control over reaction pathways, leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process.

        The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through creating a two-dimensional structure that enables a higher density of active sites than traditional linearly dispersed edge sites. These 2-D sites offer a notable advantage in terms of active site density, leading to improved catalytic performance due to an increased number of reactive surfaces. The unique structural characteristics of 2-D dispersed active sites have garnered considerable research interest due to their potential to enhance efficiency and selectivity in the ODHP process, which is vital for the production of valuable chemical intermediates.

        The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through recent research efforts. These sites offer higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, leading to improved catalytic performance due to increased surface area for reactant adsorption and product desorption. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites have attracted significant research interest because they enable more efficient use of catalysts and potentially reduce energy consumption during the ODHP process.

        Boron oxide catalysts supported on alumina have been prepared with boria loadings in the range of 0.20 wt.-%. The surface areas of the samples decreased as the boria loading was increased. All catalysts tested for the rearrangement reaction diminished in activity with time-onstream. There was a direct relationship between the amount of coke which formed on the surface and the loss in catalytic activity. This loss was least for the highest boron oxide loading tested, and this catalyst also featured the least amount of coke formation. Selectivity to caprolactam was associated with the presence of surface acidic sites of intermediate strength. A correlation was observed between the concentration of these surface sites and the selectivity to caprolactam.

        The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction involves creating a two-dimensional structure where the active sites are distributed throughout the material. These sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites due to their higher active site density, leading to enhanced catalytic performance through more direct contact with reactants. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential for enabling better control over reaction pathways, leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process.
