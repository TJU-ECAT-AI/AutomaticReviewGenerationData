        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.jmmm.2003.12.918]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.jcat.2018.11.014] and [10.1016/S0167-2991(98)80509-0]. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional structure where the active sites are distributed throughout the material. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including increased active site density, which enhances catalytic performance through more direct contact with reactants. Additionally, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential for achieving high selectivity in the ODHP reaction, particularly in the production of propylene, with minimal formation of CO2. The antioxidant ability of the silicon boride catalyst ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to its effectiveness in the ODHP process.

        The recent discovery that antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for the ODH process of ethane and propane opens up a new research direction in selective cleavage of CH bond of alkanes by metal-free catalysts. It consequently expands the fundamental understanding of the industrially important ODH process. Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2. In the following up study, Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction. Recently [18], we showed that boron nitride can also oxidize methane to valuable products. Moreover, Xie and coworkers demonstrated that carbon-doped BN catalyst showed good activity in ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene. Anyhow, people in different groups identified with the idea that the boron species could be truly indispensable elements for high ODH activity. Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for ODH of light alkanes. Study on the metal-free silicon boride may make a better understanding on the catalytic origin of the boron species, and further initiate the exploration of other new boron-based catalysts.

        Based on spectra and dynamics analysis, the BOH groups generated from the BO species with the assistance of steam might be catalytic activity sites. This work experimentally supports that the catalytic origin of the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiate the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

        The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the formation of boron oxide (BO) species on the surface of the catalyst. These BO species can generate borohydride (BOH) groups with the assistance of steam, which are believed to be the active sites responsible for the cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond in propane. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed sites offer a higher density of active sites, potentially enhancing the catalytic performance.
