        The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional structure where the active sites are distributed throughout the material. This approach significantly increases the density of active sites compared to traditional linearly dispersed edge sites, leading to enhanced catalytic performance due to more direct contact with reactants. Moreover, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential for achieving high selectivity in the ODHP reaction, particularly in the production of propylene with minimal formation of CO2.

        The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. Firstly, they significantly increase the active site density, leading to enhanced catalytic performance due to more direct contact with reactants. Secondly, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites enable better control over the reaction pathways, potentially leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process. The antioxidant ability of the silicon boride catalyst ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to its effectiveness in the ODHP process.

        The recent discovery that antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for the ODH process of ethane and propane has opened up a new research direction in selective cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes by metal-free catalysts. It has consequently expanded the fundamental understanding of industrially important ODH processes. Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively break the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2. In the following up study, Su et al. proposed that the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reactions.

        The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction has been an area of significant research interest. These sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites due to their higher active site density, which leads to enhanced catalytic performance due to an increased number of reactive surfaces. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites have attracted significant research interest because they promise improved efficiency and selectivity in the ODHP process, which is crucial for the production of valuable chemical intermediates.

        The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through recent research efforts. These sites offer higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, leading to improved catalytic performance due to increased surface area for reactant adsorption and product desorption. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites have attracted significant research interest because they enable more efficient use of catalysts and potentially reduce energy consumption during the ODHP process.

        The study on boron oxide catalysts supported on alumina for the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime to caprolactam revealed that as the boria loading increased, the surface area of the samples decreased, leading to a decrease in activity over time. Catalysts with higher boria loadings showed less coke formation and maintained their activity better than those with lower loadings. Surface acidic sites of intermediate strength correlated with selectivity towards caprolactam, influencing the reaction efficiency.

        The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through creating a highly ordered two-dimensional structure with active sites spread out across the surface. These sites provide several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including increased active site density which enhances catalytic performance through more direct contact with reactants. Additionally, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential to enable better control over reaction pathways, leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process.

        Based on the detailed analysis from the referenced studies, it is evident that the development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction involves creating a two-dimensional structure with active sites distributed throughout the material. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including higher active site density, better control over reaction pathways, and unique structural features that attract significant research interest. The antioxidant ability of the silicon boride catalyst ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to its effectiveness in the ODHP process. The enhanced catalytic performance and improved selectivity offered by these 2-D dispersed active sites make them highly attractive for research and development in the field of chemical catalysis.
