        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.jmmm.2003.12.918]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/S0167-2991(98)80509-0] and [10.1016/0926-860X(95)00273-1]. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional structure where the active sites are distributed throughout the material. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including increased active site density which enhances catalytic performance through more direct contact with reactants. Additionally, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential for achieving high selectivity in the ODHP reaction, particularly in the production of propylene, with minimal formation of CO2.

        The recent discovery that antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for the ODH process of ethane and propane opens up a new research direction in selective cleavage of CH bond of alkanes by the metal-free catalyst. It consequently expands the fundamental understanding of the industrially important ODH process. Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2. In the following up study, Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction. Recently, it was shown that boron nitride can also oxidize methane to valuable products. Moreover, Xie and coworkers demonstrated that carbon-doped BN catalyst showed good activity in the ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene. Anyhow, people in different groups identified with the idea that the boron species could be truly indispensable elements for high ODH activity.

        Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for the ODH of light alkanes. Study on the metal-free silicon boride may make a better understanding on the catalytic origin of the boron species, and further initiate the exploration of other new boron-based catalysts. Based on spectra and dynamics analysis, the BOH groups generated from the BO species with the assistance of steam might be catalytic activity sites. This work experimentally supports that the catalytic origin of the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiates the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

        The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites have attracted significant research interest because they promise improved efficiency and selectivity in the ODHP process, which is crucial for the production of valuable chemical intermediates. The antioxidant ability of the silicon boride catalyst ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to its effectiveness in the ODHP process. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction has been an area of significant research interest. These sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites due to their higher active site density, leading to enhanced catalytic performance and improved selectivity in the ODHP process.

        The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction has been a focus of recent research efforts. These sites offer higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, leading to improved catalytic performance due to increased surface area for reactant adsorption and product desorption. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites have attracted significant research interest because they enable more efficient use of catalysts and potentially reduce energy consumption during the ODHP process.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing the synthesis conditions for 2-D dispersed active sites, investigating the role of different boron compounds and dopants in enhancing catalytic activity, and exploring the synergistic effects of combining 2-D dispersed active sites with other materials to further improve selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process. Additionally, developing computational models to predict the catalytic behavior of 2-D dispersed active sites under various operating conditions could aid in the rational design of new catalysts. The potential for scaling up these catalysts for industrial applications and their environmental impact, especially in terms of reducing CO2 emissions and improving energy efficiency, should also be considered in future studies.
