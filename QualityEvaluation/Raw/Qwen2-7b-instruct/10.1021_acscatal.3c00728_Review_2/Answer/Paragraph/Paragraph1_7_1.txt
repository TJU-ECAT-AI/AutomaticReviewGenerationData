        Based on spectra and dynamics analysis, the BOH groups generated from the BO species with the assistance of steam might be catalytic activity sites. This work experimentally supports that the catalytic origin of the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiates the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

        Anyhow, people in different groups identified with the idea that the boron species could be truly indispensable elements for high ODH activity. Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for ODH of light alkanes. Study on the metal-free silicon boride may make a better understanding on the catalytic origin of the boron species, and further initiate the exploration of other new boron-based catalysts.

        The antioxidant ability of the silicon boride catalyst ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to its effectiveness in the ODHP process. The recent discovery that antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for the ODH process of ethane and propane opens up a new research direction in selective cleavage of CH bond of alkanes by the metal-free catalyst. It consequently expands the fundamental understanding of the industrially important ODH process.

        Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2. In the following up study, Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction. Recently, boron nitride can also oxidize methane to valuable products. Moreover, Xie and coworkers demonstrated that carbon-doped BN catalyst showed good activity in ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene.

        The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the formation of boron oxide (BO) species on the surface of the catalyst. These BO species can generate borohydride (BOH) groups with the assistance of steam, which are believed to be the active sites responsible for the cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond in propane.

        The study focused on boron oxide catalysts supported on alumina for the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime to caprolactam. As the boria loading increased, the surface area of the samples decreased, leading to a decrease in activity over time. Catalysts with higher boria loadings showed less coke formation and maintained their activity better than those with lower loadings. Surface acidic sites of intermediate strength correlated with selectivity towards caprolactam, influencing the reaction efficiency.
