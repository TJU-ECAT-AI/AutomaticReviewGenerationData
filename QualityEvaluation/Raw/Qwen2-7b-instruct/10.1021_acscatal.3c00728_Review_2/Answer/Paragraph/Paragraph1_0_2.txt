        The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional structure with active sites distributed throughout the material. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, primarily increased active site density, which leads to enhanced catalytic performance due to more direct contact with reactants. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed sites attract significant research interest due to their potential for achieving high selectivity in the ODHP reaction, particularly in the production of propylene with minimal formation of CO2. The antioxidant ability of the silicon boride catalyst ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to its effectiveness in the ODHP process.
