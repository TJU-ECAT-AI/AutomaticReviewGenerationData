        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.jmmm.2003.12.918]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/S0167-2991(98)80509-0], [10.1016/0926-860X(95)00273-1], [10.1016/j.surfcoat.2005.02.164], and [10.1021/acscatal.9b04558]. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional structure with active sites spread throughout the material. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including increased active site density, which enhances catalytic performance through more direct contact with reactants, and unique structural features that attract significant research interest due to their potential for achieving high selectivity in the ODHP reaction, particularly in the production of propylene with minimal formation of CO2.

        The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through creating a highly ordered two-dimensional structure with active sites spread out across the surface. These sites provide several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including increased active site density, which enhances catalytic performance through more direct contact with reactants. Additionally, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential to enable better control over reaction pathways, leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process.

        The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction has been an area of significant research interest. These sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites due to their higher active site density, which leads to enhanced catalytic performance due to increased surface area for reactant adsorption and product desorption. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites have attracted significant research interest because they enable more efficient use of catalysts and potentially reduce energy consumption during the ODHP process.

        Recent studies have shown that the antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, opening up a new research direction in selective cleavage of the CH bond of alkanes by metal-free catalysts. This expands the fundamental understanding of industrially important ODHP processes. Spectroscopic investigations suggest that borohydride (BOH) groups generated from boron oxide (BO) species with the assistance of steam might be catalytic activity sites, supporting the catalytic origin of boron species in the initiation of the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

        Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriched in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for the ODHP of light alkanes. Study on the metal-free silicon boride may make a better understanding on the catalytic origin of the boron species, and further initiate the exploration of other new boron-based catalysts. The antioxidant ability of the silicon boride catalyst ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to its effectiveness in the ODHP process.

        The antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, attracting significant research interest in selective cleavage of the CH bond of alkanes by metal-free catalysts. The recent discovery expands the fundamental understanding of industrially important ODHP processes. Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively break the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2. In the following up study, Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction.

        Based on spectra and dynamics analysis, the BOH groups generated from the BO species with the assistance of steam might be catalytic activity sites. This work experimentally supports that the catalytic origin of the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiates the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. Anyhow, people in different groups identified with the idea that the boron species could be truly indispensable elements for high ODHP activity.

        Boron oxide catalysts supported on alumina have been prepared with boria loadings in the range 020 wt.-%. The surface areas of the samples decreased as the boria loading was increased. All catalysts tested for the rearrangement reaction diminished in activity with time-onstream. There was a direct relationship between the amount of coke which formed on the surface and the loss in catalytic activity. This loss was least for the highest boron oxide loading tested, and this catalyst also featured the least amount of coke formation. Selectivity to caprolactam was associated with the presence of surface acidic sites of intermediate strength, influencing the reaction efficiency.
