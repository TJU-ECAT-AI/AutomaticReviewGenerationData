The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction is an area of recent research focus. Their unique structural features contribute to enhanced catalytic performance, which leads to increased efficiency in the ODHP reaction. This has attracted significant research interest due to the potential for improved selectivity and activity in the production of valuable chemicals from propane.

The coordination environment of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts significantly impacts their activity for the oxygen reduction reaction. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts has been accomplished through a series of precise synthesis methods. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed active sites offer higher active site density, which is essential for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. These unique structural features attract significant research interest because they can enhance catalytic performance and efficiency.
