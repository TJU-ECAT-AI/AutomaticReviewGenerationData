          [1] "The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a highly ordered two-dimensional structure with active sites distributed throughout."
          [2] "These 2-D dispersed active sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. Firstly, they significantly increase the active site density, leading to enhanced catalytic performance due to more direct contact with reactants."
          [3] "Secondly, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest because they enable better control over the reaction pathways, potentially leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process."

          The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through the creation of a highly ordered two-dimensional structure with active sites spread out across the surface. These sites provide several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including increased active site density which enhances catalytic performance through more direct contact with reactants. Additionally, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential to enable better control over reaction pathways, leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process.
