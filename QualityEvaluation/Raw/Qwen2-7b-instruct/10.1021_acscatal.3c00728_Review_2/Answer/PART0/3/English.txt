The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through creating a two-dimensional structure where the active sites are distributed across the surface. This approach offers a higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites due to its planar arrangement, which enhances catalytic performance. These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest because they enable more efficient utilization of the catalyst surface area, potentially leading to improved selectivity and activity in the ODHP reaction.

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction requires precise control over the catalyst's structure and composition.
