1. 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are developed by creating a two-dimensional structure where the active sites are spread out on the surface. They offer higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, resulting in better catalytic performance due to increased contact with reactants. These unique features have drawn significant research attention as they facilitate more efficient and selective catalysis, potentially enhancing yield and minimizing side reactions.
