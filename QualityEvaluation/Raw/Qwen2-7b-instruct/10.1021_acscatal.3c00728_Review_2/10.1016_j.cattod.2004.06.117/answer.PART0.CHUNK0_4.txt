1. The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed by creating a two-dimensional structure where the active sites are distributed throughout the material rather than being linearly arranged. This results in higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, enhancing the efficiency and selectivity in the ODHP reaction.
2. The specific advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites lie in their higher active site density, which contributes to increased efficiency and selectivity in the ODHP reaction.
3. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites have attracted significant research interest because they offer the potential to enhance the catalytic performance of boron-based catalysts in various industrial applications.

1. 在硼基催化剂中，通过创建二维结构并使活性位点在整个材料中分布，而不是线性排列，来开发用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的2-D分散活性位点。这导致与线性分散边缘位点相比，活性位点密度更高，从而提高了ODHP反应的效率和选择性。
2. 2-D分散活性位点相对于线性分散边缘位点的具体优势在于其更高的活性位点密度，这有助于提高ODHP反应的效率和选择性。
3. 由于2-D分散活性位点的独特结构特征有可能增强硼基催化剂在各种工业应用中的催化性能，因此它们吸引了大量研究兴趣。
