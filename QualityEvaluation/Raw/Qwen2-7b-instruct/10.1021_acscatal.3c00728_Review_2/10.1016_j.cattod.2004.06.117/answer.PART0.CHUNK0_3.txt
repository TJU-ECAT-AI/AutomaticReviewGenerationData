[1] "The development of 2D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) involves creating a high-density array of active sites on the surface of the catalyst. These sites are strategically positioned to optimize the reaction pathway and enhance the efficiency of the ODHP process."
[2] "Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2D dispersed active sites offer a higher density of active sites per unit area, which leads to increased catalytic activity and efficiency. This is because the 2D structure allows for more direct and efficient access to the reactants and products, reducing the diffusion barriers that are typically encountered in bulk catalysts."
[3] "The unique structural features of 2D dispersed active sites have attracted significant research interest due to their potential to significantly improve the selectivity and yield of the ODHP reaction. Researchers are exploring various methods to fabricate these structures, such as chemical vapor deposition, molecular layer epitaxy, and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, to achieve optimal catalytic properties."
