The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through a specific synthesis method, which results in a high density of 2D dispersed active sites. These sites offer an advantage over linearly dispersed edge sites due to their higher active site density, leading to enhanced catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction. The unique structural features of these catalysts have attracted significant research interest because of their potential for improved efficiency and selectivity.
