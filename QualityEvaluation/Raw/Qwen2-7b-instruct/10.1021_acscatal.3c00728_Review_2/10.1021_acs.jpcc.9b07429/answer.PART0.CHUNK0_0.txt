1. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves a precise selection of boron sources, silica supports, and reaction conditions. These sites arise from specific preparation methods that contrast with the linearly dispersed edge sites typically observed in other boron-based catalysts.
2. The 2-D dispersed active sites offer a higher density of active sites, which results in enhanced catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction compared to catalysts with linearly dispersed edge sites. This is due to the increased accessibility of reactants and products, facilitated by the 2-D structure.
3. The unique structural features of these catalysts, particularly the 2-D dispersed active sites, have garnered significant research interest because they promise to improve the selectivity and yield of the ODHP reaction, which is crucial for the efficiency and sustainability of the process.
