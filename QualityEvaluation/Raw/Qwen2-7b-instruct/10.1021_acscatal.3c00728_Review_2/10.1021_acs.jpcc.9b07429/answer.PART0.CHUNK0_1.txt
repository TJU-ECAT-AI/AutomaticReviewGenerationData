1. 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through creating a two-dimensional structure that increases the surface area for reactions. This unique feature results in higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, enhancing catalytic performance.
2. The specific advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites include higher efficiency, better selectivity, and improved stability due to the optimized distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface.
3. These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest because they offer potential solutions to overcoming limitations of traditional catalysts, such as reduced activity over time and difficulty in achieving high conversion rates in the ODHP reaction.
