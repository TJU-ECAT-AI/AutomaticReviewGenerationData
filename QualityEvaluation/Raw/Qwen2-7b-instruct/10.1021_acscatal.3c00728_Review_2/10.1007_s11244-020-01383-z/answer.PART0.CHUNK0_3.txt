Recent studies have highlighted the development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. These sites, often found in materials like hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), offer a higher density of active sites compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. The unique 2-D dispersion allows for a greater surface area exposed to the reaction environment, which enhances the catalytic performance and selectivity towards olefin production. This is because the 2-D structure facilitates the formation of active surface boron oxide (BOx) species that can efficiently generate alkyl radicals. These radicals can then react with gas-phase oxygen or undergo unimolecular decomposition, leading to the selective formation of olefins rather than COx. The high olefin selectivity observed in these catalysts is attributed to the gas phase reactions involving these surface-active species.

The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts have attracted significant research interest due to their potential to improve the efficiency and environmental footprint of alkane oxidation processes. By focusing on the development of these sites, scientists aim to optimize the catalysts for practical applications, such as the production of propylene from propane without the coproduction of COx. The research efforts in this field are expected to contribute to more sustainable chemical manufacturing processes.

近期的研究已经揭示了硼基催化剂中二维分散活性位点在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的发展。这些位点，通常存在于材料如六方氮化硼（hBN）中，与线性边缘位点相比提供了更高的活性位点密度。独特的二维分布允许暴露更多的表面积以适应反应环境，从而提高催化性能和烯烃产物的选择性。这是因为二维结构有助于形成表面活性硼氧化物（BOx）物种，这些物种能够有效地生成烷基自由基。这些自由基可以与气相氧反应或进行单分子分解，导致选择性地形成烯烃而不是COx。这些催化剂中观察到的高烯烃选择性归因于涉及表面活性物种的气相反应。

硼基催化剂中二维分散活性位点的研究引起了极大的关注，因为它们有可能提高烷烃氧化过程的效率并减少环境影响。通过专注于这些位点的发展，科学家们旨在优化催化剂以用于实际应用，例如在不产生COx的情况下从丙烷生产丙烯。该领域的研究工作有望为更可持续的化学制造过程做出贡献。
