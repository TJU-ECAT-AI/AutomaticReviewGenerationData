[1] "Recently, boron-containing materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been identified as active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene with minimal COx selectivity."
[2] "Additionally, high olefin selectivity is also obtained in the oxidation of other alkanes and other materials such as metal borides and supported B/SiO2 have been successfully applied to this transformation."
[3] "Upon exposure to reaction conditions, the surface of hBN becomes functionalized with oxygen to form B-O and B-OH species."
[4] "Interestingly, exposure of hBN to only air at reaction temperature does not afford surface oxidation."
[5] "These findings coupled with computational investigations led us to hypothesize that the origin of activity of BN materials involved O2 activation on armchair edges."
[6] "However, our findings that other boron-containing materials such as B4C, NiB, WB2 among other inorganic borides are similarly selective ODHP catalysts falsified this hypothesis."
[7] "We subsequently followed up on our disclosure of ODHP over hBN with the study of the ODH of n-butane and isobutane over hBN, which also demonstrated high selectivity to the corresponding olefins and displayed similar trends in kinetics as to that of ODHP."
[8] "In 2016, our group reported that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are active and selective catalysts for ODHP."
[9] "Beyond the serendipitous discovery of the reactivity displayed by supposedly inert materials, we showed that boron nitride offered higher selectivity to propylene than exhibited by previously studied catalysts."
[10] "Studies from other researchers demonstrate success in the ODH of ethane over hBN."
[11] "In a previous account, we have outlined the ways in which the field of boron-based alkane oxidation catalysts had developed since its serendipitous discovery."
[12] "Our recent work provides further insight into the kinetics and mechanism of hBN-catalyzed alkane ODH."
[13] "The consumption of alkane (ethane, propane, n-butane, and isobutane) has been reported to be second order with respect to Palkane and follow partial order in PO2."
[14] "Our analytical estimates fell well within the bounds set by literature criterion for external and internal mass and heat transfer."
[15] "Despite this being the case, we observed that the rate of propane consumption did not track with WBN/Fo."
[16] "To further interrogate the origin of these unexpected trends in reactivity, SiC was employed as a inert diluent to evaluate the kinetic role of catalyst particle spacing."
[17] "Along these lines, we hypothesize that the mixed boron oxide hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acts as an initiator to form alkyl radicals that further react in the gas phase."
[18] "The selectivity of alkane oxidation over hBN is dependent upon the PO2 within the feed but mostly independent of Palkane."
[19] "Recently, we optimized the yield of cracking products in the oxidation of n-butane over hBN, as oxidative cracking of hydrocarbons may prove to be an efficient alternative to nonoxidative cracking."
[20] "Early investigations into the mechanisms of non-catalyzed alkane decompositions under non-oxidative conditions suggested that the addition of olefins resulted in a decrease in the rate of alkane decomposition."
[21] "As mentioned above, the initial hypothesis that armchair edges on hBN are the active site was quickly invalidated, as other boron-containing materials (e.g., B4C, WB2, NiB) exhibit the same highly selective behavior as hBN."
[22] "Interestingly, the B/SiO2 materials undergo an induction period and exhibit a loss of boron content, both of which are dependent on the initial boron weight loading."
[23] "This shift to more agglomeration along with the induction period suggest that the boron oxide layer is dynamic and that it restructures under reaction conditions to generate the active site."
[24] "Despite considerable B loading, catalytic testing for propane ODH revealed that this material is not an active ODH catalyst."
[25] "This study suggests that isolated BO3 units immobilized within a framework cannot form the active site and boron proximity achieved either through synthesis or restructuring under reaction conditions is a requirement for ODH activity."

1. In the context of the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts, such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), are developed through surface functionalization with oxygen to form boron-oxygen and boron-oxide hydrogen species. This process allows for high olefin selectivity and minimal production of COx, surpassing the performance of previously studied catalysts.

2. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts offer a higher density of active sites, which contributes to improved catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed sites attract significant research interest due to their ability to facilitate efficient alkane oxidation, leading to high olefin selectivity.

3. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts has attracted research interest because they enable selective oxidation of alkanes to olefins with reduced COx production, which is crucial for improving the efficiency and environmental sustainability of chemical synthesis processes. The enhanced olefin selectivity and reduced COx formation make these catalysts particularly valuable for industrial applications in the production of olefins from alkanes.
