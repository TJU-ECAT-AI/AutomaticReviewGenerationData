[1] "Recently, boron-containing materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been identified as active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene with minimal COx selectivity."
[2] "Beyond the serendipitous discovery of the reactivity displayed by supposedly inert materials, we showed that boron nitride offered higher selectivity to propylene than exhibited by previously studied catalysts."
[3] "Our recent work provides further insight into the kinetics and mechanism of hBN-catalyzed alkane ODH."
[4] "Over hBN, the consumption of alkane (ethane, propane, n-butane, and isobutane) has been reported to be second order with respect to Palkane and follow partial order in PO2."
[5] "Our findings that other boron-containing materials such as B4C, NiB, WB2 among other inorganic borides are similarly selective ODHP catalysts falsified this hypothesis."
[6] "Interestingly, exposure of hBN to only air at reaction temperature does not afford surface oxidation."
[7] "Examination of these materials using XPS after reaction gave evidence in favor of a common BOx phase that emerges on the surface of each material under reaction conditions."
[8] "Subsequently, evaluation of fresh and used BN materials using solid-state 11B-NMR revealed that the phase generated after ODHP is an amorphous mixed boron oxide hydroxide."
[9] "We recently examined the influence of transport phenomena in ODHP."
[10] "When the bed volume was held constant, a volcano-type dependence of the propane consumption rate as a function of hBN mass."
[11] "The selectivity of alkane oxidation over hBN is dependent upon the PO2 within the feed but mostly independent of Palkane."
[12] "The existence of silanol (SiOH) and boronol (BOH) species on the fresh and spent materials."
[13] "In situ Raman spectroscopy of the fresh B/SiO2 shows that above 100 C, boric acid-like features condense to form six-member boroxol rings and that the condensation is reversible."
[14] "Analysis of the spent B/SiO2 shows a shift to a higher degree of boron agglomeration, as seen in the 11B-11B double quantum-single quantum (DQ-SQ) NMR spectra."
[15] "Despite considerable B loading, catalytic testing for propane ODH revealed that this material is not an active ODH catalyst."

Boron-based catalysts, specifically hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), have been identified as active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) of propane to propylene. The use of two-dimensional (2-D) dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts, as opposed to linearly dispersed edge sites, offers several advantages. These 2-D dispersed sites provide a higher active site density, which translates to enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these catalysts have attracted significant research interest due to their ability to offer high selectivity in the ODHP reaction and minimal production of COx, which are advantageous over traditional metal oxide catalysts. Studies have shown that the reactivity and selectivity of boron-based catalysts are influenced by factors such as mass and heat transfer, transport phenomena, and the formation of boron oxide phases on the surface of the catalysts under reaction conditions. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the kinetics and mechanism of alkane oxidation over boron-containing catalysts, highlighting the potential of these materials in the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for alkane oxidation processes.
