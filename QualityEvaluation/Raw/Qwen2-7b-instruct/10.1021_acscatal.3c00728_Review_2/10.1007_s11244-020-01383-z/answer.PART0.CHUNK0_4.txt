[1] "Recently, boron-containing materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been identified as active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene with minimal COx selectivity."
[2] "Additionally, high olefin selectivity is also obtained in the oxidation of other alkanes and other materials such as metal borides and supported B/SiO2 have been successfully applied to this transformation."
[3] "Our findings that other boron-containing materials such as B4C, NiB, WB2 among other inorganic borides are similarly selective ODHP catalysts falsified this hypothesis."
[4] "Interestingly, exposure of hBN to only air at reaction temperature does not afford surface oxidation."
[5] "These findings coupled with computational investigations led us to hypothesize that the origin of activity of BN materials involved O2 activation on armchair edges."
[6] "However, our findings that other boron-containing materials such as B4C, NiB, WB2 among other inorganic borides are similarly selective ODHP catalysts falsified this hypothesis."
[7] "Subsequently, evaluation of fresh and used BN materials using solid-state 11B-NMR revealed that the phase generated after ODHP is an amorphous mixed boron oxide hydroxide."
[8] "Our recent work provides further insight into the kinetics and mechanism of hBN-catalyzed alkane ODH."
[9] "We recently examined the influence of transport phenomena in ODHP."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) involves the formation of a mixed boron oxide hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst after exposure to reaction conditions. This mixed phase emerges as an amorphous boron oxide hydroxide, which is distinct from the initial surface composition. The specific advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites include increased active site density and enhanced catalytic performance due to the dynamic nature of the boron oxide phase. These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest because they lead to improved olefin selectivity and suppressed over-oxidation pathways, which are critical for efficient propane conversion to propylene. The active sites likely require aggregated oxidized boron clusters, and careful material synthesis combined with in situ spectroscopy are needed to identify the active sites under reaction conditions.
