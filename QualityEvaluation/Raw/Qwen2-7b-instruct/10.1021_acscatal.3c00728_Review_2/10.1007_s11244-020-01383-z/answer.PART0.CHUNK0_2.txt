[1] "Recently, boron-containing materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been identified as active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene with minimal COx selectivity."
[2] "Additionally, high olefin selectivity is also obtained in the oxidation of other alkanes and other materials such as metal borides and supported B/SiO2 have been successfully applied to this transformation."
[3] "Beyond the serendipitous discovery of the reactivity displayed by supposedly inert materials, we showed that boron nitride offered higher selectivity to propylene than exhibited by previously studied catalysts."
[4] "We subsequently followed up on our disclosure of ODHP over hBN with the study of the ODH of n-butane and isobutane over hBN, which also demonstrated high selectivity to the corresponding olefins and displayed similar trends in kinetics as to that of ODHP."
[5] "A wide array of techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared, solid-state NMR (SSNMR), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that upon exposure to reaction conditions, the surface of hBN becomes functionalized with oxygen to form B-O and B-OH species."
[6] "Interestingly, exposure of hBN to only air at reaction temperature does not afford surface oxidation."
[7] "These findings coupled with computational investigations led us to hypothesize that the origin of activity of BN materials involved O2 activation on armchair edges."
[8] "However, our findings that other boron-containing materials such as B4C, NiB, WB2 among other inorganic borides are similarly selective ODHP catalysts falsified this hypothesis."
[9] "Subsequently, evaluation of fresh and used BN materials using solid-state 11B-NMR revealed that the phase generated after ODHP is an amorphous mixed boron oxide hydroxide."
[10] "Our recent work provides further insight into the kinetics and mechanism of hBN-catalyzed alkane ODH."
[11] "The determination of the influence of mass and heat transfer influence in the testing of catalysts is critical."
[12] "Our analytical estimates fell well within the bounds set by literature criterion for external and internal mass and heat transfer."
[13] "Despite this being the case, we observed that the rate of propane consumption did not track with WBN/Fo."
[14] "Expecting that this observation may have been linked to boundary layer gradients, we anticipated that moving to smaller reactor diameters should minimize transport effects."
[15] "This evidenced that complex gassolid interactions or gas phase chemistry have significant control over the reaction rate."
[16] "Our recent work provides further insight into the kinetics and mechanism of hBN-catalyzed alkane ODH."
[17] "Typically, the introduction of diluent leads to better heat dissipation and less localized hot spots in a catalyst bed and thus lower reaction rates."
[18] "Therefore, we proposed that the influence of increasing dilution arises from a mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism occurring over boron-containing materials."
[19] "When the bed volume was held constant, a volcano-type dependence of the propane consumption rate as a function of hBN mass (Fig. 2)."
[20] "This behavior indicates that there needs to be sufficient catalyst to initiate the radical reaction, but excess hBN leads to significant chain termination events on the catalyst surface."
[21] "The selectivity of alkane oxidation over hBN is dependent upon the PO2 within the feed but mostly independent of Palkane."
[22] "Recently, we optimized the yield of cracking products in the oxidation of n-butane over hBN, as oxidative cracking of hydrocarbons may prove to be an efficient alternative to nonoxidative cracking."
[23] "Early investigations into the mechanisms of non-catalyzed alkane decompositions under non-oxidative conditions suggested that the addition of olefins resulted in a decrease in the rate of alkane decomposition."
[24] "Therefore, in this previously unpublished experiment, we employed isobutene as a radical clock in the oxidation of n-butane under lean PO2 conditions."
[25] "This shift to more agglomeration along with the induction period suggest that the boron oxide layer is dynamic and that it restructures under reaction conditions to generate the active site."
[26] "It is not rigorously known how catalyst structure at the onset of reaction influences the types and quantities of active sites that arise after hours time-on-stream (TOS)."

Answer:

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the functionalization of boron nitride (hBN) surfaces with oxygen to form boron-oxygen (B-O) and boron-oxide hydroxyl (B-OH) species. This process leads to the formation of a mixed boron oxide hydroxide phase after exposure to reaction conditions. The high selectivity of hBN towards propylene compared to previously studied catalysts suggests that these unique structural features attract significant research interest in the field. The 2-D dispersion allows for a higher active site density, contributing to the catalyst's superior performance in the ODHP reaction. The ability to achieve high olefin selectivity without significant COx production is a key advantage of these boron-based catalysts.
