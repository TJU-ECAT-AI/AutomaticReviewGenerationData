Boron-based catalysts, specifically hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), have been identified as active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) of propane to propylene. The use of two-dimensional (2-D) dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts, as opposed to linearly dispersed edge sites, offers several advantages. These 2-D dispersed sites provide a higher active site density, which translates to enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these catalysts have attracted significant research interest due to their ability to offer high selectivity in the ODHP reaction and minimal production of COx, which are advantageous over traditional metal oxide catalysts. Studies have shown that the reactivity and selectivity of boron-based catalysts are influenced by factors such as mass and heat transfer, transport phenomena, and the formation of boron oxide phases on the surface of the catalysts under reaction conditions. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the kinetics and mechanism of alkane oxidation over boron-containing catalysts, highlighting the potential of these materials in the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for alkane oxidation processes.

1. In the context of the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts, such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), are developed through surface functionalization with oxygen to form boron-oxygen and boron-oxide hydrogen species. This process allows for high olefin selectivity and minimal production of COx, surpassing the performance of previously studied catalysts.

2. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts offer a higher density of active sites, which contributes to improved catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed sites attract significant research interest due to their ability to facilitate efficient alkane oxidation, leading to high olefin selectivity.

3. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts has attracted research interest because they enable selective oxidation of alkanes to olefins with reduced COx production, which is crucial for improving the efficiency and environmental sustainability of chemical synthesis processes. The enhanced olefin selectivity and reduced COx formation make these catalysts particularly valuable for industrial applications in the production of olefins from alkanes.

Answer:

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the functionalization of boron nitride (hBN) surfaces with oxygen to form boron-oxygen (B-O) and boron-oxide hydroxyl (B-OH) species. This process leads to the formation of a mixed boron oxide hydroxide phase after exposure to reaction conditions. The high selectivity of hBN towards propylene compared to previously studied catalysts suggests that these unique structural features attract significant research interest in the field. The 2-D dispersion allows for a higher active site density, contributing to the catalyst's superior performance in the ODHP reaction. The ability to achieve high olefin selectivity without significant COx production is a key advantage of these boron-based catalysts.

Recent studies have highlighted the development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. These sites, often found in materials like hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), offer a higher density of active sites compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. The unique 2-D dispersion allows for a greater surface area exposed to the reaction environment, which enhances the catalytic performance and selectivity towards olefin production. This is because the 2-D structure facilitates the formation of active surface boron oxide (BOx) species that can efficiently generate alkyl radicals. These radicals can then react with gas-phase oxygen or undergo unimolecular decomposition, leading to the selective formation of olefins rather than COx. The high olefin selectivity observed in these catalysts is attributed to the gas phase reactions involving these surface-active species.

The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts have attracted significant research interest due to their potential to improve the efficiency and environmental footprint of alkane oxidation processes. By focusing on the development of these sites, scientists aim to optimize the catalysts for practical applications, such as the production of propylene from propane without the coproduction of COx. The research efforts in this field are expected to contribute to more sustainable chemical manufacturing processes.

近期的研究已经揭示了硼基催化剂中二维分散活性位点在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的发展。这些位点，通常存在于材料如六方氮化硼（hBN）中，与线性边缘位点相比提供了更高的活性位点密度。独特的二维分布允许暴露更多的表面积以适应反应环境，从而提高催化性能和烯烃产物的选择性。这是因为二维结构有助于形成表面活性硼氧化物（BOx）物种，这些物种能够有效地生成烷基自由基。这些自由基可以与气相氧反应或进行单分子分解，导致选择性地形成烯烃而不是COx。这些催化剂中观察到的高烯烃选择性归因于涉及表面活性物种的气相反应。

硼基催化剂中二维分散活性位点的研究引起了极大的关注，因为它们有可能提高烷烃氧化过程的效率并减少环境影响。通过专注于这些位点的发展，科学家们旨在优化催化剂以用于实际应用，例如在不产生COx的情况下从丙烷生产丙烯。该领域的研究工作有望为更可持续的化学制造过程做出贡献。

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) involves the formation of a mixed boron oxide hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst after exposure to reaction conditions. This mixed phase emerges as an amorphous boron oxide hydroxide, which is distinct from the initial surface composition. The specific advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites include increased active site density and enhanced catalytic performance due to the dynamic nature of the boron oxide phase. These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest because they lead to improved olefin selectivity and suppressed over-oxidation pathways, which are critical for efficient propane conversion to propylene. The active sites likely require aggregated oxidized boron clusters, and careful material synthesis combined with in situ spectroscopy are needed to identify the active sites under reaction conditions.
