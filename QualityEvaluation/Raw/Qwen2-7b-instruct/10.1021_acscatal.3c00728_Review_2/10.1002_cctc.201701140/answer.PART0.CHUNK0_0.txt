[1] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions."
[2] "Moreover, the main byproduct with the use of TiN is undesired COx."
[3] "These B-containing catalysts were found to have similar surface elemental compositions, primarily composed of B and O atoms, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."
[4] "The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins."
[5] "Efforts to elucidate these effects on reactivity further are currently ongoing."

1. Boron-based catalysts, including boron carbide, titanium boride, nickel boride, cobalt boride, hafnium boride, and tungsten boride, are developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction through the creation of 2-D dispersed active sites. These sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites due to their higher density and improved catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest because they enhance the efficiency of the ODHP reaction.

2. Compared to boron-based catalysts, titanium nitride (TiN) does not exhibit the same high selectivity for propylene formation during the ODHP reaction, resulting in a predominant byproduct of COx instead of the desired olefins.

3. Boron-based catalysts, such as those containing boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB), demonstrate similar surface compositions primarily consisting of boron (B) and oxygen (O) atoms. This similarity is confirmed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, indicating the presence of boronoxygen coordination that plays a critical role in the ODHP reaction.

4. The formation of an active and selective BOx site on the surface of boron-based catalysts under ODHP reaction conditions is responsible for the selective pathway that leads to the formation of olefins. This site is crucial for the high selectivity observed in the ODHP reaction, contributing to the development and optimization of boron-based catalysts.

5. Further research is being conducted to understand the precise mechanisms by which the crystal structures of boron-based catalysts influence the formation of BOx species during the ODHP reaction. This knowledge will aid in refining the catalyst design and enhancing the catalytic performance for more efficient and selective ODHP processes.

1. 硼基催化剂，包括硼碳化物、钛硼化物、镍硼化物、钴硼化物、铪硼化物和钨硼化物，通过在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中形成二维分散活性位点而开发。与线性分散的边沿位点相比，这些位点具有更高的密度和催化性能优势。这些独特的结构特征吸引了研究兴趣，因为它们提高了ODHP反应的效率。

2. 与硼基催化剂相比，钛氮化物（TiN）在ODHP反应中不表现出相同的高丙烯选择性，导致主要副产品为COx而不是所需烯烃。

3. 硼基催化剂，如硼碳化物（B4C）、钛硼化物（TiB2）、镍硼化物（NiB）、钴硼化物（Co2B/Co3B）、铪硼化物（HfB2）和钨硼化物（WB），显示出相似的表面组成，主要由硼（B）和氧（O）原子组成。这一相似性通过X射线光电子能谱（XPS）分析得到证实，表明存在硼氧配位，这是ODHP反应的关键作用。

4. 在ODHP反应条件下，在硼基催化剂表面上形成的活性和选择性的BOx位点是选择性路径形成烯烃的原因。这个位点对观察到的高选择性ODHP反应负责，有助于硼基催化剂的发展和优化。

5. 目前正在进行进一步的研究，以理解硼基催化剂的晶体结构如何影响ODHP反应期间BOx物种的形成。这种知识将有助于改进催化剂设计并提高ODHP过程的催化性能。
