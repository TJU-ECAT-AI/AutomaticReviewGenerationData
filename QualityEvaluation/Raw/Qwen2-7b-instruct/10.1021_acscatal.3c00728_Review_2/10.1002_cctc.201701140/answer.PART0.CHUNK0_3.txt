[1] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions."
[2] "Moreover, the main byproduct with the use of TiN is undesired COx. We therefore conclude that boron is the necessary element to achieve high olefin selectivity."
[3] "These B-containing catalysts were found to have similar surface elemental compositions, primarily composed of B and O atoms, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."
[4] "Boronoxygen coordination was confirmed for spent B-containing compounds from observed shifts to higher binding energies of the B1s XPS feature."
[5] "The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins."
[6] "Efforts to elucidate these effects on reactivity further are currently ongoing."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the utilization of boron-containing materials such as boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB). These materials, along with elemental boron, demonstrate exceptional behavior in the ODHP reaction, converting propane into small olefins with high selectivity and efficiency. The unique advantage of these 2-D dispersed active sites lies in their ability to offer a higher density of active sites per unit mass compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, which contributes to improved catalytic performance. The research interest in these materials is driven by their potential to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process, offering a more economically attractive method for producing building-block olefins. Despite the observed high olefin selectivity, the underlying mechanisms and the precise nature of the active sites still require further investigation to optimize the catalytic performance and understand the role of boron in achieving high olefin selectivity.

2-D分散活性位点在硼基催化剂中的发展涉及利用硼化合物材料，如硼碳化物（B4C）、钛硼化物（TiB2）、镍硼化物（NiB）、钴硼化物（Co2B/Co3B）、铪硼化物（HfB2）和钨硼化物（WB）。这些材料，连同单质硼，展示了在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中进行高选择性和效率的小烯烃转化的独特行为。这些2-D分散活性位点的优势在于它们能够提供比线性边缘位点更高的活性位点密度，从而提高催化性能。对这些材料的研究兴趣是由它们增强ODHP过程效率和选择性的潜力驱动的，提供了一种生产基础烯烃更具经济吸引力的方法。尽管观察到了高的烯烃选择性，但实现高烯烃选择性的机制和活性位点的确切性质仍需要进一步研究以优化催化性能并理解硼的作用。
