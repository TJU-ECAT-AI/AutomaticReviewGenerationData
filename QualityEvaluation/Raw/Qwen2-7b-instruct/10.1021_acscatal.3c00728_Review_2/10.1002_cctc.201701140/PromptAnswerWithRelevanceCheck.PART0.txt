1. Boron-based catalysts, including boron carbide, titanium boride, nickel boride, cobalt boride, hafnium boride, and tungsten boride, are developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction through the creation of 2-D dispersed active sites. These sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites due to their higher density and improved catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest because they enhance the efficiency of the ODHP reaction.

2. Compared to boron-based catalysts, titanium nitride (TiN) does not exhibit the same high selectivity for propylene formation during the ODHP reaction, resulting in a predominant byproduct of COx instead of the desired olefins.

3. Boron-based catalysts, such as those containing boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB), demonstrate similar surface compositions primarily consisting of boron (B) and oxygen (O) atoms. This similarity is confirmed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, indicating the presence of boronoxygen coordination that plays a critical role in the ODHP reaction.

4. The formation of an active and selective BOx site on the surface of boron-based catalysts under ODHP reaction conditions is responsible for the selective pathway that leads to the formation of olefins. This site is crucial for the high selectivity observed in the ODHP reaction, contributing to the development and optimization of boron-based catalysts.

5. Further research is being conducted to understand the precise mechanisms by which the crystal structures of boron-based catalysts influence the formation of BOx species during the ODHP reaction. This knowledge will aid in refining the catalyst design and enhancing the catalytic performance for more efficient and selective ODHP processes.

1. 硼基催化剂，包括硼碳化物、钛硼化物、镍硼化物、钴硼化物、铪硼化物和钨硼化物，通过在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中形成二维分散活性位点而开发。与线性分散的边沿位点相比，这些位点具有更高的密度和催化性能优势。这些独特的结构特征吸引了研究兴趣，因为它们提高了ODHP反应的效率。

2. 与硼基催化剂相比，钛氮化物（TiN）在ODHP反应中不表现出相同的高丙烯选择性，导致主要副产品为COx而不是所需烯烃。

3. 硼基催化剂，如硼碳化物（B4C）、钛硼化物（TiB2）、镍硼化物（NiB）、钴硼化物（Co2B/Co3B）、铪硼化物（HfB2）和钨硼化物（WB），显示出相似的表面组成，主要由硼（B）和氧（O）原子组成。这一相似性通过X射线光电子能谱（XPS）分析得到证实，表明存在硼氧配位，这是ODHP反应的关键作用。

4. 在ODHP反应条件下，在硼基催化剂表面上形成的活性和选择性的BOx位点是选择性路径形成烯烃的原因。这个位点对观察到的高选择性ODHP反应负责，有助于硼基催化剂的发展和优化。

5. 目前正在进行进一步的研究，以理解硼基催化剂的晶体结构如何影响ODHP反应期间BOx物种的形成。这种知识将有助于改进催化剂设计并提高ODHP过程的催化性能。

[1] "Boron nitride was recently identified as a highly selective catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."
[3] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),"
[4] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions."
[5] "The various B-containing materials differ in their catalytic performance only in the rates of propane consumption (Figure2)."
[6] "With the exception of fresh hBN, which contains a roughly equivalent ratio of B and N atoms at its surface, it appears that the fresh materials actually contain very little of the non-boron elements at the surface."
[7] "Upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, surface oxygen concentrations increase, whereas concentrations of non-boron elements decrease."
[8] "The notable exception is hBN, which maintains its feature at approximately 191eV (assigned to BN coordination),"
[9] "The strong catalytic stability of hBN was already evidenced in separate studies, and it showed stable propane conversion for 3days7 and 13days on stream.9 Here, we additionally report that B4C shows a stable propylene yield for approximately 2days on stream after an initial induction period during the first day on stream."

1. 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through the formation of BOx active sites. These sites are not edge sites on the boron nitride but rather analogous surface-stabilized BOx sites on boride catalysts. They offer specific advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance due to their unique structural features.

2. These unique structural features, particularly the formation of surface-stabilized BOx active sites, have attracted significant research interest because they enable high olefin selectivity and stability in the ODHP reaction. The ability to maintain high selectivity and stability over time, as demonstrated by hBN, makes these catalysts valuable for industrial applications in producing building-block olefins efficiently and economically.

Answer: These unique structural features enable high olefin selectivity and stability in the ODHP reaction, making boron-based catalysts valuable for industrial applications in producing building-block olefins efficiently and economically. The formation of surface-stabilized BOx active sites, rather than relying on linearly dispersed edge sites, offers advantages in terms of active site density and catalytic performance, which has attracted significant research interest in the field.

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the utilization of boron-containing materials such as boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB). These materials, along with elemental boron, demonstrate exceptional behavior in the ODHP reaction, converting propane into small olefins with high selectivity and efficiency. The unique advantage of these 2-D dispersed active sites lies in their ability to offer a higher density of active sites per unit mass compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, which contributes to improved catalytic performance. The research interest in these materials is driven by their potential to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process, offering a more economically attractive method for producing building-block olefins. Despite the observed high olefin selectivity, the underlying mechanisms and the precise nature of the active sites still require further investigation to optimize the catalytic performance and understand the role of boron in achieving high olefin selectivity.
