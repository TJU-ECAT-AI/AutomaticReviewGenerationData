[1] "Boron nitride was recently identified as a highly selective catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."
[3] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),"
[4] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions."
[5] "The various B-containing materials differ in their catalytic performance only in the rates of propane consumption (Figure2)."
[6] "With the exception of fresh hBN, which contains a roughly equivalent ratio of B and N atoms at its surface, it appears that the fresh materials actually contain very little of the non-boron elements at the surface."
[7] "Upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, surface oxygen concentrations increase, whereas concentrations of non-boron elements decrease."
[8] "The notable exception is hBN, which maintains its feature at approximately 191eV (assigned to BN coordination),"
[9] "The strong catalytic stability of hBN was already evidenced in separate studies, and it showed stable propane conversion for 3days7 and 13days on stream.9 Here, we additionally report that B4C shows a stable propylene yield for approximately 2days on stream after an initial induction period during the first day on stream."

1. 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through the formation of BOx active sites. These sites are not edge sites on the boron nitride but rather analogous surface-stabilized BOx sites on boride catalysts. They offer specific advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance due to their unique structural features.

2. These unique structural features, particularly the formation of surface-stabilized BOx active sites, have attracted significant research interest because they enable high olefin selectivity and stability in the ODHP reaction. The ability to maintain high selectivity and stability over time, as demonstrated by hBN, makes these catalysts valuable for industrial applications in producing building-block olefins efficiently and economically.

Answer: These unique structural features enable high olefin selectivity and stability in the ODHP reaction, making boron-based catalysts valuable for industrial applications in producing building-block olefins efficiently and economically. The formation of surface-stabilized BOx active sites, rather than relying on linearly dispersed edge sites, offers advantages in terms of active site density and catalytic performance, which has attracted significant research interest in the field.

1. 硼基催化剂中的二维分散活性位点通过形成BOx活性位点来发展氧化脱氢反应丙烷（ODHP）反应。这些位点不是硼氮化物上的边缘位点，而是所有测试的硼化物催化剂表面稳定化的类似BOx位点。它们在活性位点密度和催化性能方面优于线性分散的边缘位点，这归功于它们的独特结构特征。

2. 这些独特结构特征，特别是表面稳定化的BOx活性位点的形成，吸引了大量研究兴趣，因为它们能够实现高烯烃选择性和稳定性。能够在一段时间内维持高选择性和稳定性，正如hBN所显示的那样，使这些催化剂对于工业应用生产高效经济的构建块烯烃具有价值。

答案：这些独特结构特征允许在ODHP反应中实现高烯烃选择性和稳定性，使硼基催化剂对于工业应用生产高效经济的构建块烯烃具有价值。形成表面稳定化的BOx活性位点而不是依赖于线性分散的边缘位点，在活性位点密度和催化性能方面提供了优势，这吸引了大量研究兴趣在该领域。
