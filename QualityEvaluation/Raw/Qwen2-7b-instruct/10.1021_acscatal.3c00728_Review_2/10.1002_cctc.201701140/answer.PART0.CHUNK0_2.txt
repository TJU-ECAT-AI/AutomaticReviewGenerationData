[1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),7 n-butane, and isobutane8 to form the corresponding olefins selectively."
[2] "Moreover, the main byproduct with the use of TiN is undesired COx."
[3] "Furthermore, the reactivity of elemental B far exceeds that of other boron-containing materials, and it achieves specific rates approximately 31 times higher than hBN and approximately 19 times higher than B4C."
[4] "The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the use of boron-containing materials that exhibit high selectivity and efficiency. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed sites offer a higher active site density and improved catalytic performance due to their unique structural features. These features have attracted significant research interest because they enable more efficient and selective conversion of propane to olefins under ODHP conditions. The higher reactivity and selectivity of elemental boron compared to boron-containing materials suggest that the active sites on these catalysts are BOx species, which play a crucial role in the ODHP reaction pathway. The research on these catalysts aims to understand the factors influencing their reactivity and active site density, which could lead to the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for the ODHP process.

2-D分散活性位点在硼基催化剂中用于丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的发展涉及使用表现出高选择性和效率的硼化合物材料。与线性分散边缘位点相比，2-D分散位点因其独特的结构特征提供了更高的活性位点密度和改进的催化性能。这些特征吸引了大量研究兴趣，因为它们允许在ODHP条件下更高效、更选择性地将丙烷转化为烯烃。元素硼的更高活性和选择性相对于硼化合物表明，这些催化剂上的活性位点是BOx物种，它们在ODHP反应途径中起着关键作用。对这些催化剂的研究旨在理解影响其活性和活性位点密度的因素，这可能导致开发更高效、更稳定的ODHP过程催化剂。
