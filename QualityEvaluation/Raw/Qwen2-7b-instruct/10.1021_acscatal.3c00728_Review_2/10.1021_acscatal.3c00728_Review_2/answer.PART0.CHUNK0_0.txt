1. 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through various methods, including doping active boron oxide/boron hydroxyl units on diverse hosting materials, utilizing the exposed surface of bulk boride materials, and creating defects and holes in the plane of BN nanosheets. These sites offer significant improvements in active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. Their unique structural features have attracted extensive research interest in the field.

2. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction involves several strategies. Key among these is the doping of active boron oxide or boron hydroxyl units onto various host materials. Additionally, exposing the surface of bulk boride materials can also serve as a source for 2-D active sites. Creating defects and holes within the plane of BN nanosheets is another effective method. These approaches significantly increase the density of active sites, thereby improving the catalytic performance of the materials. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed sites make them particularly interesting for researchers working on the ODHP reaction.
