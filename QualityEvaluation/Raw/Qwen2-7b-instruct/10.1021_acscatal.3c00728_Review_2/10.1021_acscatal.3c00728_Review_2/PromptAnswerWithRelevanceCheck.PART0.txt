2.2.2. 2-D Supported BOx Active Site
"Through the study of h-BN catalysts, researchers have realized the importance of BO or BOH species for the ODHP reaction. Therefore, the direct application of BOx-based materials to ODHP is a very promising direction."
"However, because the melting point of boron oxide (450°C) is lower than the operating temperature of ODHP (480-560°C), the sintering and loss of boron oxide species will occur under reaction conditions."
"Creating defects and holes in the plane of the BN nanosheet is also an efficient method for creating 2-D dispersed active sites."
"Moreover, the local chemical environment of h-BN could be regulated by N2-plasma treatment by breaking linked chemical bonds in a controlled manner and abstracting the N element in the plane of BN, resulting in more three-coordinated-B center N-defects formation and a remarkable ODH reaction performance."
"2.2.4. 2-D Active Sites in Metal Borides
"In addition to the metal-free materials, metal boride catalysts, including titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB), were investigated by Grant et al. for ODHP. (52) Unprecedented selectivity to propene was observed for these metal boride catalysts, and the main byproduct was ethene rather than COx (Figure 4d)."
"2.2.5. Exploration of Active Sites on 2-D B-Based Materials
"With the further development of research on this subject, more B-containing materials have been used in ODHP reactions and the real active sites on 2-D catalysts have been discussed from different perspectives."

1. Two-dimensional dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed by doping boron oxide or boron hydroxyl units on the surface of diverse hosting materials, or by exposing the bulk boride materials' surface. These sites offer significant improvements in active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. Researchers are particularly interested in these unique structural features because they can lead to enhanced catalytic performance.

2. The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. They allow for a significantly increased density of active sites, which translates to better catalytic performance. The ability to create defects and holes in the plane of the boron nanosheet also enhances the formation of active sites. Furthermore, controlling the local chemical environment through treatments like N2-plasma can lead to the formation of active sites with desirable properties, improving the overall reaction performance.

3. Metal boride catalysts, such as titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB), exhibit unprecedented selectivity to propene in ODHP reactions. These catalysts produce ethene as the main byproduct, rather than COx, demonstrating their effectiveness in the process. The high selectivity of these metal boride catalysts suggests that the presence of boron is crucial for achieving optimal performance in ODHP reactions, rather than the metal or nonmetallic element bonded with boron.

4. The exploration of active sites on 2-D boron-based materials has revealed that boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB), along with elemental boron (B), show similar behavior to boron nitride (BN) with analogous surface-stabilized BOx as the active site. This finding overturns the previous views regarding the active sites for the ODHP reaction. The crystal structures of the studied boride catalysts differ from that of BN, highlighting the necessity of boron for achieving high olefin selectivity. The XPS results confirm that oxygen is functionalized onto the surfaces of boron-containing catalysts during the ODHP reaction, contributing to the high stability of these catalysts.

2. 二维分散活性位点在硼基催化剂中的优势在于它们能够提供比线性分散边缘位点更高的活性位点密度，从而改善催化性能。通过在平面硼纳米片中创建缺陷和孔洞可以有效形成活性位点。此外，通过控制局部化学环境，如氮气等离子处理，可以实现更协调的B中心N缺陷形成，进而显著提高氧化脱氢反应性能。

3. 钛硼化物（TiB2）、镍硼化物（NiB）、钴硼化物（Co2B/Co3B）、铪硼化物（HfB2）和钨硼化物（WB）作为金属硼化物催化剂，在ODHP反应中显示出前所未有的丙烯选择性。这些催化剂以乙烷为主要副产品，而不是COx，表明它们在该过程中非常有效。这些金属硼化物催化剂的高选择性表明，硼的存在对于实现ODHP反应的最佳性能至关重要，而不仅仅是与硼结合的金属或非金属元素。

4. 对于2-D硼基材料上的活性位点的探索揭示了硼碳化物（B4C）、钛硼化物（TiB2）、镍硼化物（NiB）、钴硼化物（Co2B/Co3B）、铪硼化物（HfB2）和钨硼化物（WB），以及单质硼（B）都显示出了与硼氮化物（BN）类似的行为，具有类似的表面稳定化的BOx作为活性位点。这一发现颠覆了之前关于ODHP反应中活性位点的观点。研究了这些硼化物催化剂的晶体结构与BN不同，强调了硼对于实现高烯烃选择性的必要性。XPS结果证实，氧气会在硼基催化剂表面功能化，有助于这些催化剂的高稳定性。
