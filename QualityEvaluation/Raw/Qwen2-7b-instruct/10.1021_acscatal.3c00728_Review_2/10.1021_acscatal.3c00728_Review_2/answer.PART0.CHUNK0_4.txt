2.2. 2-D Dispersed Active Sites in B-Based Catalysts for the ODHP Reaction

The 2-D dispersed active sites can be developed by doping the active boron oxide/boron hydroxyl units on the surface of diverse hosting materials. Moreover, the exposed surface of bulk boride materials can also be regarded as the 2-D dispersed active sites for the ODHP reaction.

Compared with the linearly dispersed edge sites, the density of active site can be significantly improved. Consequently, B nanomaterials with 2-D active sites have drawn extensive interest from researchers in the ODHP reaction because of their unique structural features.

2.2.1. 2-D BN Active Sites

Creating defects and holes in the plane of the BN nanosheet is also an efficient method for creating 2-D dispersed active sites.

2.2.2. 2-D Supported BOx Active Site

Through the study of h-BN catalysts, researchers have realized the importance of BO or BOH species for the ODHP reaction.

2.2.3. 2-D Dispersed Active Sites in Nonmetal Borides

Boron carbide is generally considered a chemically inert material with super hardness, high melting, and wear resistance.

2.2.4. 2-D Active Sites in Metal Borides

In addition to the metal-free materials, metal boride catalysts, including titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB), were investigated by Grant et al. for ODHP.

2.2.5. Exploration of Active Sites on 2-D B-Based Materials

Grant et al. (52) found that boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB), as well as elemental B, showed similar behavior to BN with an analogous surface-stabilized BOx as the active site.

1. 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed by doping active boron oxide/boron hydroxyl units on the surface of diverse hosting materials or by exposing the surface of bulk boride materials. These sites are created through methods like creating defects and holes in the plane of the boron nitride (BN) nanosheet. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed active sites offer significantly improved density of active sites. This leads to enhanced catalytic performance, thus attracting extensive research interest in their unique structural features.

2. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction offer several advantages. The improved density of active sites compared to linearly dispersed edge sites leads to a higher number of reactive sites, which increases the efficiency of the catalytic process. This results in enhanced catalytic performance and selectivity towards desired products. The unique arrangement and density of these active sites enable more effective interaction with reactants, leading to improved reaction rates and yields of target compounds. Additionally, the 2-D structure often provides better stability and durability under reaction conditions, contributing to the overall effectiveness and reliability of the catalysts in industrial applications.
