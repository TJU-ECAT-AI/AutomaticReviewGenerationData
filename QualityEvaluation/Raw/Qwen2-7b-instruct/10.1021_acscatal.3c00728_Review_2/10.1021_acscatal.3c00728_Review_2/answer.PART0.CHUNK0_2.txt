These 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through doping boron oxide/boron hydroxyl units on diverse hosting materials or by exposing the bulk boride materials' surface. This method significantly improves the density of active sites compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. The unique structural features of these 2-D active sites have attracted significant research interest due to their ability to enhance catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction.

[1] "The 2-D BN active sites have been found to have a higher selectivity for olefins during the oxidative dehydrogenation process."
[2] "The local chemical environment of h-BN could be regulated by N2-plasma treatment by breaking linked chemical bonds in a controlled manner and abstracting the N element in the plane of BN, resulting in more three-coordinated-B center N-defects formation and a remarkable ODH reaction performance."
[3] "The 2-D supported BOx active site is important to improve the stability and dispersion of the BO species."

The 2-D BN active sites demonstrate a higher selectivity for olefins during the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The local chemical environment of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) can be adjusted through nitrogen plasma treatment, leading to the formation of more three-coordinate B centers with N defects and enhancing the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction performance. The construction of 2-D boron oxide-supported catalysts is crucial for improving the stability and dispersion of boron oxide species.
