2.2. 2-D Dispersed Active Sites in B-Based Catalysts for the ODHP Reaction
The 2-D dispersed active sites can be developed by doping the active boron oxide/boron hydroxyl units on the surface of diverse hosting materials. Moreover, the exposed surface of bulk boride materials can also be regarded as the 2-D dispersed active sites for the ODHP reaction.
2.2.1. 2-D BN Active Sites
Creating defects and holes in the plane of the BN nanosheet is also an efficient method for creating 2-D dispersed active sites.
2.2.2. 2-D Supported BOx Active Site
Through the study of h-BN catalysts, researchers have realized the importance of BO or BOH species for the ODHP reaction. Therefore, the direct application of BOx-based materials to ODHP is a very promising direction.
2.2.3. 2-D Dispersed Active Sites in Nonmetal Borides
As the B species are loaded on the surface of the 2-D support, the low loading and loss of active species result in a limited number of active sites and restrict the enhancement of its catalytic activity.
2.2.4. 2-D Active Sites in Metal Borides
In addition to the metal-free materials, metal boride catalysts, including titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB), were investigated by Grant et al. for ODHP.
2.2.5. Exploration of Active Sites on 2-D B-Based Materials
Grant et al. (52) found that boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB), as well as elemental B, showed similar behavior to BN with an analogous surface-stabilized BOx as the active site.

The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through various methods such as doping active boron oxide/boron hydroxyl units on diverse hosting materials, utilizing the exposed surface of bulk boride materials, creating defects and holes in the plane of boron nitride (BN) nanosheets, applying boron oxide (BOx)-based materials, and utilizing metal boride catalysts. These sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, particularly in terms of significantly increased active site density. This leads to enhanced catalytic performance, which has attracted significant research interest due to the unique structural features of these catalysts. Researchers have found that these sites are crucial for achieving high olefin selectivity in the ODHP reaction, and the stability of these catalysts has also been noted, indicating their potential for practical applications in industrial processes.
