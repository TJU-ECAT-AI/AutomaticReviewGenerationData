[1] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."
[2] "It is generally proposed that the formed oxidized B sites (for example, BO, BOH, and B(OH)xO3x) act as the active centers under ODHP reaction conditions."
[3] "Different from the traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based redox metal oxide catalysts in ODHP reaction, h-BN shows very low selectivity to carbon oxides and relatively high selectivity to ethylene, compared to V-based catalysts where the main by-products are COx."
[4] "The drastically different product distributions observed in the h-BN and metal oxide-based catalysts imply that the reaction mechanisms are different in these two types of catalysts."
[5] "The high BET surface area h-BN catalyst (72.7m2g1), denoted as BN-high, was prepared via a novel gas exfoliation of bulk h-BN in liquid N2."
[6] "The BN surface is oxidized and hydrolyzed to form BO and BOH species under ODH reaction conditions."
[7] "The absence of mass and heat transfer limitation in the ODHP tests was verified by WeiszPrater analysis and Mears analysis, respectively."
[8] "We detected traces of nitric oxide (NO) on BN-T-high catalyst at high temperatures at high propane conversion."
[9] "Our SVUV-PIMS results provided direct and unambiguous detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts."
[10] "The proposed mechanism bears similarities to other redox-poor oxides such as MgO,16 and shares their capacity for selective alkane conversions."

1. Two-dimensional dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts, specifically hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), are developed through a novel gas exfoliation process of bulk h-BN in liquid nitrogen. These active sites offer higher density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, which translates to improved catalytic performance. Their unique structural features, including high surface area and selective COx formation, have attracted significant research interest due to their potential for selective alkane conversions.

2. The use of h-BN as a catalyst for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction leads to low selectivity towards carbon oxides and high selectivity towards ethylene production, unlike traditional redox metal oxide catalysts. This difference in product distribution implies distinct reaction mechanisms in boron-based catalysts versus metal oxide catalysts.

3. The absence of mass and heat transfer limitations in the ODHP tests validates the efficiency of the catalysts. The detection of gas-phase methyl radicals through SVUV-PIMS supports the involvement of radical chemistry in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts.

4. The proposed reaction mechanism for ODHP over boron-based catalysts includes surface-mediated CH activation of propane, followed by a reduction of gas-phase oxidants, showcasing similarities to other redox-poor oxides like magnesium oxide (MgO) in selective alkane conversions.

1. 二维分散的活性位点在硼基催化剂中，特别是六方硼氮化物（h-BN），通过液体氮气中批量h-BN的新型气体剥离过程开发。这些活性位点相对于线性分散的边缘位点提供了更高的密度，从而提高了催化性能。它们独特的结构特征，包括高表面积和对碳氧化物的低选择性形成，吸引了大量的研究兴趣，这主要是由于它们在烷烃选择性转化方面的潜力。

2. 使用h-BN作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的催化剂，导致对碳氧化物的低选择性和乙烯的高选择性生产，与传统的红氧化金属氧化物催化剂不同。这种产物分布的不同表明，硼基催化剂和金属氧化物催化剂之间的反应机制存在差异。

3. 在ODHP测试中不存在质量传递和热传递限制验证了催化剂的效率。通过SVUV-PIMS检测到的气相甲基自由基支持了硼基催化剂上ODHP反应中涉及的自由基化学。

4. 提出的ODHP在硼基催化剂上的反应机制包括表面介导的丙烷CH激活，随后是对气相氧化剂的还原，展示了与其他红氧化不良氧化物如镁氧化物（MgO）在选择性烷烃转化中的相似性。
