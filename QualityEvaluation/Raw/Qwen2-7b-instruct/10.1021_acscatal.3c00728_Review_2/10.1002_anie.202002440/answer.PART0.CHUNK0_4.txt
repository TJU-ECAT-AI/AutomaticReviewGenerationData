[1] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."
[2] "The drastically different product distributions observed in the h-BN and metal oxide-based catalysts imply that the reaction mechanisms are different in these two types of catalysts."
[3] "Interestingly, a recent work implied a possible influence of gas-phase radical chemistry of h-BN catalyst in ODHP reaction,6 in which no expected relationship was found between the catalytic activity and contact time."
[4] "We detected traces of nitric oxide (NO) on BN-T-high catalyst during ODHP reaction at 600C by using the SVUV-PIMS (Supporting Information, FigureS22), which was consistent with the GC-TCD results (Supporting Information, FigureS8)."
[5] "In our DFT study, a surface model was constructed from B2O3 containing surface BO3 units (Supporting Information, FigureS23; further discussion of surface model therein)."
[6] "We find the formation of such as ethylene and methyl radicals can occur competitively over either the surface or the gas-phase (Supporting Information, FiguresS30, S31) with similar barriers."

1. 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through the exfoliation of bulk hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in liquid nitrogen. These sites offer a higher density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, enhancing catalytic performance. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed sites attract significant research interest due to their potential for increased surface area and reactivity, leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process.

2. The advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts over linearly dispersed edge sites primarily lie in their higher density and catalytic performance. These sites allow for a greater number of active sites per unit volume, which can lead to enhanced reaction rates and yields. Additionally, the unique structural properties of 2-D materials enable better control over the surface chemistry and electronic properties, potentially leading to more selective catalysis.

3. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts has attracted significant research interest due to their potential for increasing the density of active sites, improving catalytic performance, and enabling the realization of more selective and efficient alkane oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The enhanced surface area and controlled electronic properties of 2-D materials offer opportunities for optimizing the catalytic behavior of boron-based catalysts, particularly in terms of selectivity towards desired products and the minimization of unwanted side reactions.

4. The presence of nitric oxide (NO) on the BN-T-high catalyst during the ODHP reaction at 600°C, as detected by synchrotron radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS) and confirmed by gas chromatography with thermal conductivity detection (GC-TCD), suggests that radical chemistry plays a role in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts. This finding is significant because it provides evidence for the involvement of gas-phase radicals in the reaction pathway, which could influence the product distribution and catalytic performance.

5. The surface model for the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts includes a boron oxide layer with B(OH)xO3x sites. This model elucidates the reaction mechanism, which involves heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond in propane to form a co-adsorbed B-C3H7 species and a hydrogen atom. Subsequent steps involve the abstraction of hydrogen from the surface oxygen by oxygen to reduce O2 to HO2, forming a weakly bound BHO2 and BC3H7 species. These surface species then react to produce propene and H2O2, which desorb readily from the surface. The model also suggests that the formation of C1 and C2 products can occur through both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways.

6. The formation of ethylene and methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts can occur competitively on either the surface or in the gas phase, with similar barriers. This indicates that both pathways contribute to the formation of C1 and C2 products. The competitive formation of these radicals highlights the importance of considering gas-phase chemistry in the overall reaction mechanism, as it can significantly impact the product distribution and catalytic performance of boron-based catalysts in the ODHP process.
