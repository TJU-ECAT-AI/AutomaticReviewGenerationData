1. Two-dimensional dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts, specifically hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), are developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. These sites offer a higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed sites attract significant research interest due to their potential for improving the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process.

2. The ODHP reaction catalyzed by boron-based catalysts, including h-BN, involves gas-phase radical mechanisms and pathways. Gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) are identified through online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), providing direct evidence for the presence of these radicals in the ODHP reaction. This finding enhances the understanding of the reaction mechanisms and pathways over boron-based catalysts.

3. Propene is predominantly generated through a surface reaction involving the cleavage of CH bonds in propane. This process is crucial in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by boron-based catalysts.

4. The ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts, such as h-BN, is characterized by the formation of various products via distinct pathways. Propene is mainly produced through a surface reaction mechanism, whereas C1 and C2 products can be formed through both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. This dual approach to product formation showcases the versatility and efficiency of boron-based catalysts in the ODHP process.

5. The development of boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction enables the production of propene and C1/C2 products via surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. These pathways are essential for the selective conversion of propane to valuable olefins, making boron-based catalysts promising alternatives to traditional redox metal oxide catalysts in the ODHP process.

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves utilizing hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a catalyst. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. Firstly, h-BN catalysts have a high BET surface area, which increases the density of active sites available for the reaction. This leads to enhanced catalytic performance compared to catalysts with linearly dispersed edge sites. Secondly, the unique 2-D structure of h-BN allows for better dispersion of active sites, reducing agglomeration and improving the efficiency of the reaction. Lastly, the structural features of h-BN, such as its high surface area and dispersion of active sites, have attracted significant research interest due to their potential to enable more selective and efficient conversion of propane to olefins in the ODHP reaction.

In comparison to traditional redox metal oxide catalysts, h-BN demonstrates lower selectivity for carbon oxides and higher selectivity for ethylene, making it a promising alternative for the ODHP reaction. The lack of COx formation and the ability to produce ethylene selectively are significant advantages over vanadium-based catalysts, which often result in substantial amounts of COx as by-products.

The high BET surface area of the h-BN catalyst (72.7 m²/g1) prepared through a novel gas exfoliation method facilitates a large number of active sites for the ODHP reaction. This catalyst surface is oxidized and hydrolyzed to form boron-oxygen (BO) and boron-oxygen-hydroxy (BOH) species under the reaction conditions, enhancing its reactivity.

The ODHP tests conducted without mass and heat transfer limitations were confirmed using WeiszPrater and Mears analyses, respectively. This indicates that the reaction conditions were optimized for the ODHP process, supporting the development of effective boron-based catalysts for this reaction.

The discovery of direct experimental evidence of methyl radical generation in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts represents a significant advancement in the field. This finding provides new insights into the reaction mechanisms and pathways over boron-based catalysts, highlighting the importance of radical chemistry in the ODHP process. This knowledge can guide the development of highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.

开发硼基催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的二维分散活性位点涉及利用六方氮化硼（h-BN）作为催化剂。这些位点在与线性边缘位点相比时提供了几个优势。首先，h-BN催化剂具有高比表面积，这增加了可用于反应的活性位点密度。这导致与线性边缘位点相比，催化性能得到增强。其次，h-BN的独特二维结构允许活性位点的更好分散，减少了聚集并提高了反应效率。最后，h-BN的结构特征，如其高比表面积和活性位点的分散，吸引了大量研究兴趣，因为它们有可能使丙烷到相应烯烃的转化更选择性和高效地进行ODHP反应。

与传统的还原氧化金属氧化物催化剂相比，h-BN显示出较低的碳氧化物选择性和较高的乙烯选择性，使其成为ODHP反应的有前景的替代品。与经常产生大量COx副产品的钒基催化剂相比，这种缺乏COx形成和能够以较高选择性生产乙烯的特点是其优势。

h-BN催化剂（比表面积为72.7 m²/g1）通过新型气体剥离方法制备，具有高比表面积，为ODHP反应提供了大量活性位点。在反应条件下，该催化剂表面被氧化和水解形成硼氧（BO）和硼氧羟基（BOH）物种，从而增强了其反应性。

ODHP测试在没有质量传递和热传递限制的情况下进行，并通过WeiszPrater和Mears分析分别进行了验证。这表明已优化了反应条件以支持有效硼基催化剂的发展用于此反应。

直接实验证据显示，在硼基催化剂上ODHP反应中生成甲基自由基，这是领域内的重大进展。这一发现为理解硼基催化剂上的反应机制和路径提供了新的见解，突出了自由基化学在ODHP过程中的重要性。这些知识可以指导开发高度选择性的催化剂来实现烷烃氧化脱氢。

1. 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through the exfoliation of bulk hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in liquid nitrogen. These sites offer a higher density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, enhancing catalytic performance. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed sites attract significant research interest due to their potential for increased surface area and reactivity, leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process.

2. The advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts over linearly dispersed edge sites primarily lie in their higher density and catalytic performance. These sites allow for a greater number of active sites per unit volume, which can lead to enhanced reaction rates and yields. Additionally, the unique structural properties of 2-D materials enable better control over the surface chemistry and electronic properties, potentially leading to more selective catalysis.

3. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts has attracted significant research interest due to their potential for increasing the density of active sites, improving catalytic performance, and enabling the realization of more selective and efficient alkane oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The enhanced surface area and controlled electronic properties of 2-D materials offer opportunities for optimizing the catalytic behavior of boron-based catalysts, particularly in terms of selectivity towards desired products and the minimization of unwanted side reactions.

4. The presence of nitric oxide (NO) on the BN-T-high catalyst during the ODHP reaction at 600°C, as detected by synchrotron radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS) and confirmed by gas chromatography with thermal conductivity detection (GC-TCD), suggests that radical chemistry plays a role in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts. This finding is significant because it provides evidence for the involvement of gas-phase radicals in the reaction pathway, which could influence the product distribution and catalytic performance.

5. The surface model for the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts includes a boron oxide layer with B(OH)xO3x sites. This model elucidates the reaction mechanism, which involves heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond in propane to form a co-adsorbed B-C3H7 species and a hydrogen atom. Subsequent steps involve the abstraction of hydrogen from the surface oxygen by oxygen to reduce O2 to HO2, forming a weakly bound BHO2 and BC3H7 species. These surface species then react to produce propene and H2O2, which desorb readily from the surface. The model also suggests that the formation of C1 and C2 products can occur through both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways.

6. The formation of ethylene and methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts can occur competitively on either the surface or in the gas phase, with similar barriers. This indicates that both pathways contribute to the formation of C1 and C2 products. The competitive formation of these radicals highlights the importance of considering gas-phase chemistry in the overall reaction mechanism, as it can significantly impact the product distribution and catalytic performance of boron-based catalysts in the ODHP process.
