[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[3] "We detected traces of nitric oxide (NO) on BN-T-high catalyst at high temperatures at high propane conversion (Supporting Information, FigureS22), which was consistent with the GC-TCD results (Supporting Information, FigureS8)."
[4] "DFT calculations were performed to construct the reaction mechanism including pathways and radical chemistry of ODHP on the boron nitride catalyst."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the use of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and supported boron oxide catalysts. These materials offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites due to their higher active site density. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites enable more efficient interaction with reactants, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. This has attracted significant research interest in the field because of the potential for selective alkane conversions and the minimization of carbon oxides formation during the ODHP process.
