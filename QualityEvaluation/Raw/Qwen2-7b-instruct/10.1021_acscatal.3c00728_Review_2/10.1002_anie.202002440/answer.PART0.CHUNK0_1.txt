The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves utilizing hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a catalyst. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. Firstly, h-BN catalysts have a high BET surface area, which increases the density of active sites available for the reaction. This leads to enhanced catalytic performance compared to catalysts with linearly dispersed edge sites. Secondly, the unique 2-D structure of h-BN allows for better dispersion of active sites, reducing agglomeration and improving the efficiency of the reaction. Lastly, the structural features of h-BN, such as its high surface area and dispersion of active sites, have attracted significant research interest due to their potential to enable more selective and efficient conversion of propane to olefins in the ODHP reaction.

In comparison to traditional redox metal oxide catalysts, h-BN demonstrates lower selectivity for carbon oxides and higher selectivity for ethylene, making it a promising alternative for the ODHP reaction. The lack of COx formation and the ability to produce ethylene selectively are significant advantages over vanadium-based catalysts, which often result in substantial amounts of COx as by-products.

The high BET surface area of the h-BN catalyst (72.7 m²/g1) prepared through a novel gas exfoliation method facilitates a large number of active sites for the ODHP reaction. This catalyst surface is oxidized and hydrolyzed to form boron-oxygen (BO) and boron-oxygen-hydroxy (BOH) species under the reaction conditions, enhancing its reactivity.

The ODHP tests conducted without mass and heat transfer limitations were confirmed using WeiszPrater and Mears analyses, respectively. This indicates that the reaction conditions were optimized for the ODHP process, supporting the development of effective boron-based catalysts for this reaction.

The discovery of direct experimental evidence of methyl radical generation in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts represents a significant advancement in the field. This finding provides new insights into the reaction mechanisms and pathways over boron-based catalysts, highlighting the importance of radical chemistry in the ODHP process. This knowledge can guide the development of highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.

开发硼基催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的二维分散活性位点涉及利用六方氮化硼（h-BN）作为催化剂。这些位点在与线性边缘位点相比时提供了几个优势。首先，h-BN催化剂具有高比表面积，这增加了可用于反应的活性位点密度。这导致与线性边缘位点相比，催化性能得到增强。其次，h-BN的独特二维结构允许活性位点的更好分散，减少了聚集并提高了反应效率。最后，h-BN的结构特征，如其高比表面积和活性位点的分散，吸引了大量研究兴趣，因为它们有可能使丙烷到相应烯烃的转化更选择性和高效地进行ODHP反应。

与传统的还原氧化金属氧化物催化剂相比，h-BN显示出较低的碳氧化物选择性和较高的乙烯选择性，使其成为ODHP反应的有前景的替代品。与经常产生大量COx副产品的钒基催化剂相比，这种缺乏COx形成和能够以较高选择性生产乙烯的特点是其优势。

h-BN催化剂（比表面积为72.7 m²/g1）通过新型气体剥离方法制备，具有高比表面积，为ODHP反应提供了大量活性位点。在反应条件下，该催化剂表面被氧化和水解形成硼氧（BO）和硼氧羟基（BOH）物种，从而增强了其反应性。

ODHP测试在没有质量传递和热传递限制的情况下进行，并通过WeiszPrater和Mears分析分别进行了验证。这表明已优化了反应条件以支持有效硼基催化剂的发展用于此反应。

直接实验证据显示，在硼基催化剂上ODHP反应中生成甲基自由基，这是领域内的重大进展。这一发现为理解硼基催化剂上的反应机制和路径提供了新的见解，突出了自由基化学在ODHP过程中的重要性。这些知识可以指导开发高度选择性的催化剂来实现烷烃氧化脱氢。
