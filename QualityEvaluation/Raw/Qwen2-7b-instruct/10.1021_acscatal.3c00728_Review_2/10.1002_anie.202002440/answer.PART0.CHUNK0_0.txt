1. Two-dimensional dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts, specifically hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), are developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. These sites offer a higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed sites attract significant research interest due to their potential for improving the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process.

2. The ODHP reaction catalyzed by boron-based catalysts, including h-BN, involves gas-phase radical mechanisms and pathways. Gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) are identified through online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), providing direct evidence for the presence of these radicals in the ODHP reaction. This finding enhances the understanding of the reaction mechanisms and pathways over boron-based catalysts.

3. Propene is predominantly generated through a surface reaction involving the cleavage of CH bonds in propane. This process is crucial in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by boron-based catalysts. Surface-mediated reactions contribute significantly to the formation of propene, while both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways play roles in the production of C1 and C2 products.

4. The ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts, such as h-BN, is characterized by the formation of various products via distinct pathways. Propene is mainly produced through a surface reaction mechanism, whereas C1 and C2 products can be formed through both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. This dual approach to product formation showcases the versatility and efficiency of boron-based catalysts in the ODHP process.

5. The development of boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction enables the production of propene and C1/C2 products via surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. These pathways are essential for the selective conversion of propane to valuable olefins, making boron-based catalysts promising alternatives to traditional redox metal oxide catalysts in the ODHP process.
