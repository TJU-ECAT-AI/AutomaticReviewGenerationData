The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through a process that optimizes their distribution on the surface of hexagonal boron nitride. These sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites due to their higher density and improved catalytic performance. This unique structural feature attracts significant research interest as it enhances the efficiency of the ODHP reaction.

The dynamic phase diagram provides insights into how the surface properties of the catalyst change under various conditions, which is crucial for understanding and optimizing the catalytic activity during the ODHP process.
