Dynamic phase diagrams for the catalytic surface of hexagonal boron nitride were created under conditions of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This process involves converting propane to propylene with the release of water. Researchers developed 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). These sites provide higher active site density than linearly dispersed edge sites, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. The distinctive structural characteristics of these 2-D dispersed active sites have garnered considerable attention within the field.
