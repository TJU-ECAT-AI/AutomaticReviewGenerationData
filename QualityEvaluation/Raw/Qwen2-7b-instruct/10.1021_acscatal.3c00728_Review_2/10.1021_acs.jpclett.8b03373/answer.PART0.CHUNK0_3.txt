1. The dynamic phase diagram of the catalytic surface of hexagonal boron nitride under oxidative dehydrogenation of propane conditions involves the development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction.
2. These 2-D dispersed active sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of higher active site density, which can lead to enhanced catalytic performance.
3. The unique structural features of these sites have attracted significant research interest because they potentially enable more efficient and selective catalysis in the ODHP process.
