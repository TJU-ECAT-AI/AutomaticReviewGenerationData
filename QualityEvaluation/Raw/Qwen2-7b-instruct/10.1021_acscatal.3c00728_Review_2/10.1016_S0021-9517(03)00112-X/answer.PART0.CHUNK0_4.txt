1. The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking demonstrates yields reaching up to 50% of olefin, specifically propene and ethene.
2. Activation of alkane through a cleavage of a carbon-hydrogen bond acts as the rate-determining step for all produced reaction products.
3. The presence of gas-phase oxygen is vital for the conversion of propane.
4. Carbon dioxide has a substantial inhibitory effect on the activity of the catalyst for all products.
5. The conversion patterns of ethane, propane, and butane affirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane serves as the rate-determining step.
