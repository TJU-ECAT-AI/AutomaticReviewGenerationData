Oxidative conversion of lower alkanes over lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts offers a viable alternative for propene and ethene production. The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene).

The presence of small amounts of oxygen influences the radical gas-phase chemistry significantly because the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals are greatly increased.

Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibiting effect on the reaction without changing the product distribution, due to strong adsorption on the site that activates propane.

In the proposed reaction mechanism, activation of propane takes place predominantly on the catalyst as long as the propane partial pressure is below typically 0.3 bar.

The role of oxygen in activating propane is complex. The presence of oxygen opens a fast reaction pathway, shown by the marked increase of the rates of hydrocarbon product formation upon increasing the oxygen concentration from 0 to 5 mbar.

The presence of gas-phase oxygen appears to be crucial for propane conversion. The strong increase of the reaction rates by increasing the oxygen concentration has been attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with the chain-carrier radicals, opening a fast reaction pathway via OH radicals.

Carbon dioxide strongly suppresses the activity of the catalyst for all products. The apparent order is 1, which is attributed to blocking of active sites by forming Li+CO3 on the active site.

Consecutive reactions of propene give almost exclusively carbon oxides and proceeds mainly on the catalyst. The rate of conversion is low compared to the rate of conversion of propane due to the relative stability of the intermediate allyl radical compared to the propyl radical under reaction conditions.

The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-determining step. Gas-phase radical chemistry determines largely the selectivity pattern.
