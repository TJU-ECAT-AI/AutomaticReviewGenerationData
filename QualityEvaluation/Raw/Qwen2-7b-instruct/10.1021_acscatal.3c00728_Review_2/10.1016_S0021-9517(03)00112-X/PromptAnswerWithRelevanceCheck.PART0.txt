The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction offers several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. These advantages include higher active site density, enhanced catalytic performance, and unique structural features that have attracted significant research interest in the field. The 2-D dispersion allows for a greater number of active sites per unit area, which can lead to increased efficiency and productivity in the ODHP process. The specific structural characteristics of these sites enable better interactions with reactants, facilitating more effective activation and conversion of propane molecules. This results in improved selectivity and yield of desired products, such as olefins, compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. The research interest in 2-D dispersed active sites stems from their potential to significantly enhance the performance of catalysts in ODHP, offering a promising avenue for improving the economic viability and environmental impact of propane conversion processes.

Oxidative conversion of lower alkanes over lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts offers a viable alternative for propene and ethene production. The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene). The reaction kinetics were studied by means of variation of the partial pressures of the reactants as well as by addition of product species to the reaction mixture. The observations can be qualitatively explained with a mechanism including activation of propane on the catalyst generating propyl radicals that undergo a radical-chain mechanism in the gas phase. Alkane activation is rate determining. Oxygen has two functions in the mechanism. First, the presence of small amounts of oxygen influences the radical gas-phase chemistry significantly because the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals are greatly increased. At higher oxygen partial pressures the radical chemistry is only slightly influenced by the increasing oxygen concentration. The second function of oxygen is to facilitate the removal of hydrogen from the surface OH species that are formed during the activation of propane on the catalyst. Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibiting effect on the reaction without changing the product distribution, due to strong adsorption on the site that activates propane.

Oxidative conversion of lower alkanes over lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts offers a viable alternative for propene and ethene production. The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene).

The presence of small amounts of oxygen influences the radical gas-phase chemistry significantly because the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals are greatly increased.

Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibiting effect on the reaction without changing the product distribution, due to strong adsorption on the site that activates propane.

In the proposed reaction mechanism, activation of propane takes place predominantly on the catalyst as long as the propane partial pressure is below typically 0.3 bar.

The role of oxygen in activating propane is complex. The presence of oxygen opens a fast reaction pathway, shown by the marked increase of the rates of hydrocarbon product formation upon increasing the oxygen concentration from 0 to 5 mbar.

The presence of gas-phase oxygen appears to be crucial for propane conversion. The strong increase of the reaction rates by increasing the oxygen concentration has been attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with the chain-carrier radicals, opening a fast reaction pathway via OH radicals.

Carbon dioxide strongly suppresses the activity of the catalyst for all products. The apparent order is 1, which is attributed to blocking of active sites by forming Li+CO3 on the active site.

Consecutive reactions of propene give almost exclusively carbon oxides and proceeds mainly on the catalyst. The rate of conversion is low compared to the rate of conversion of propane due to the relative stability of the intermediate allyl radical compared to the propyl radical under reaction conditions.

The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-determining step. Gas-phase radical chemistry determines largely the selectivity pattern.
