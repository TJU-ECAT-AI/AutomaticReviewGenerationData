[1] "Alkane activation via a CH bond splitting is the rate-determining step for all reaction products."
[2] "For propane, rates are first order up to 0.3 bar propane."
[3] "At high propane partial pressures (>0.3 bar) the reaction order increases for all hydrocarbon products."
[4] "The presence of gas-phase oxygen appears to be crucial for propane conversion."
[5] "The strong increase of the reaction rates by increasing the oxygen concentration has been attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with the chain-carrier radicals, opening a fast reaction pathway via OH radicals."
[6] "A second function of oxygen is to regenerate the catalyst via removal of hydrogen from the catalyst in order to restore the activity of the catalyst for generation of radicals."
[7] "Carbon dioxide strongly suppresses the activity of the catalyst for all products."
[8] "Reactions in the gas phase were not influenced by CO2."
[9] "Consecutive reactions of propene give almost exclusively carbon oxides and proceeds mainly on the catalyst."
[10] "The rate of conversion is low compared to the rate of conversion of propane due to the relative stability of the intermediate allyl radical compared to the propyl radical under reaction conditions."
[11] "The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-determining step."
[12] "Gas-phase radical chemistry determines largely the selectivity pattern."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction offers several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. These advantages include higher active site density, enhanced catalytic performance, and unique structural features that have attracted significant research interest in the field. The 2-D dispersion allows for a greater number of active sites per unit area, which can lead to increased efficiency and productivity in the ODHP process. The specific structural characteristics of these sites enable better interactions with reactants, facilitating more effective activation and conversion of propane molecules. This results in improved selectivity and yield of desired products, such as olefins, compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. The research interest in 2-D dispersed active sites stems from their potential to significantly enhance the performance of catalysts in ODHP, offering a promising avenue for improving the economic viability and environmental impact of propane conversion processes.
