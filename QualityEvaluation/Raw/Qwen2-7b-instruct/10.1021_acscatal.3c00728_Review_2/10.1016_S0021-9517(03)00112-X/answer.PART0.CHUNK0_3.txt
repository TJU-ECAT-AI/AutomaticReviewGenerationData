[1] "In this paper (part I) we report a detailed study on the reaction kinetics of propane and propene oxidation in the presence of oxygen over Li/Dy/MgO catalysts and the reaction mechanism of propene oxidative conversion will be proposed based mainly on the kinetic measurements."
[2] "The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene)."
[3] "The reaction kinetics were studied by means of variation of the partial pressures of the reactants as well as by addition of product species to the reaction mixture."
[4] "Alkane activation via a CH bond splitting is the rate-determining step for all reaction products. For propane, rates are first order up to 0.3 bar propane. At high propane partial pressures (>0.3 bar) the reaction order increases for all hydrocarbon products."
[5] "The presence of gas-phase oxygen appears to be crucial for propane conversion. The strong increase of the reaction rates by increasing the oxygen concentration has been attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with the chain-carrier radicals, opening a fast reaction pathway via OH radicals. A second function of oxygen is to regenerate the catalyst via removal of hydrogen from the catalyst in order to restore the activity of the catalyst for generation of radicals."
[6] "Carbon dioxide strongly suppresses the activity of the catalyst for all products. The apparent order is 1, which is attributed to blocking of active sites by forming Li+CO3 on the active site."
[7] "Consecutive reactions of propene give almost exclusively carbon oxides and proceeds mainly on the catalyst. The rate of conversion is low compared to the rate of conversion of propane due to the relative stability of the intermediate allyl radical compared to the propyl radical under reaction conditions."
[8] "The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-determining step. Gas-phase radical chemistry determines largely the selectivity pattern."

1. The detailed study focuses on the reaction kinetics of propane and propene oxidation over Li/Dy/MgO catalysts, proposing the mechanism of propene oxidative conversion based on kinetic measurements.
2. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene).
3. The reaction kinetics were studied through adjustments of reactant partial pressures and addition of product species to the reaction mixture.
4. Activation of alkane via CH bond splitting is the rate-determining step for all reaction products. For propane, reaction rates are first order up to 0.3 bar, increasing at higher partial pressures.
5. Oxygen enhances propane conversion by facilitating the formation of OH radicals and catalyst regeneration through hydrogen removal.
6. Carbon dioxide significantly suppresses catalyst activity by blocking active sites.
7. Propene conversion is slower than propane due to the stability of the allyl radical.
8. Ethane, propane, and butane conversion patterns confirm hydrogen abstraction as the rate-determining step.
