Regular Article Vanadium Oxide Supported on Mesoporous MCM-41 as Selective Catalysts in the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Alkanes

The application of different techniques (51V NMR, diffuse reflectance, and TPR-H2) in the characterization of vanadia supported on mesoporous MCM-41 catalysts shows that the nature of the vanadium species depends on the V loading. In dehydrated catalysts with V content lower than 7 wt%, vanadium is mainly in a tetrahedral environment. In the presence of moisture, most V5+, placed in accessible positions, binds to water molecules, becoming hexacoordinated, while some V5+ species, probably located within the pore walls, keep their tetrahedral coordination. Higher V contents in the catalyst leads to the formation of polymeric V2O5-like species. Both XRD and textural results indicate that the mesoporous structure of the support is mostly maintained after the vanadium incorporation, and therefore high surface areas were obtained on the final catalysts. MCM-41-suppported vanadia catalysts are active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane, although the catalytic behavior depends on the V loading. A high rate of formation of propylene or ethylene per unit mass of catalyst per unit time have also been observed as a consequence of the high dispersion of V atoms achieved on the surface of the support.

The text describes the preparation and characterization of vanadium oxide supported on mesoporous MCM-41 catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. It mentions that the nature of the vanadium species varies depending on the vanadium loading. In lower V content catalysts, vanadium is predominantly in a tetrahedral environment. With higher V contents, polymeric V2O5-like species form. The text also indicates that the mesoporous structure of the support remains intact upon vanadium incorporation, leading to catalysts with high surface areas. These catalysts exhibit activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane, with the catalytic performance being dependent on the vanadium loading. The high dispersion of vanadium atoms on the support surface results in a high rate of propylene or ethylene formation per unit mass of catalyst per unit time.

文本描述了用于烷烃氧化脱氢的二氧化钒支持在微孔MCM-41催化剂的制备和表征。它提到，根据钒负载量，钒物种的性质会有所不同。在较低的V含量催化剂中，钒主要处于四面体环境中。随着V含量的增加，形成聚类的V2O5类似物。文本还表明，支撑材料的微孔结构在掺杂钒后保持不变，导致催化剂具有高比表面积。这些催化剂在丙烷和乙烷的氧化脱氢反应中表现出活性和选择性，催化性能依赖于钒负载量。支持表面的高分散度钒原子导致每单位催化剂质量每单位时间形成高比例的丙烯或乙烯。
