[1] "The nature of the vanadium species depends on the V loading."
[2] "In dehydrated catalysts with V content lower than 7 wt%, vanadium is mainly in a tetrahedral environment."
[3] "In the presence of moisture, most V5+, placed in accessible positions, binds to water molecules, becoming hexacoordinated, while some V5+ species, probably located within the pore walls, keep their tetrahedral coordination."
[4] "Higher V contents in the catalyst leads to the formation of polymeric V2O5-like species."
[5] "MCM-41-supported vanadia catalysts are active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane."
[6] "A high rate of formation of propylene or ethylene per unit mass of catalyst per unit time have also been observed as a consequence of the high dispersion of V atoms achieved on the surface of the support."

Vanadium oxide supported on mesoporous MCM-41 catalysts exhibit different properties based on vanadium loading. At lower loads, typically less than 7 wt%, vanadium forms a tetrahedral environment. Upon hydration, vanadium ions bind to water molecules, transforming into hexacoordinated species. At higher loads, polymeric V2O5-like structures form. These catalysts are active and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane. The high dispersion of vanadium atoms on the support surface leads to an increased rate of propylene or ethylene formation per unit mass of catalyst per unit time.

范德华氧化物支持在介孔MCM-41催化剂的性质基于钒负载不同。在较低的负载下，通常低于7wt%，钒形成四面体环境。在水分存在下，钒离子与水分子结合，转化为六配位物种。在较高负载下，形成类似V2O5的聚合物结构。这些催化剂对于丙烷和乙烷的氧化脱氢表现出活性和选择性。支撑表面的高分散度钒原子导致单位质量催化剂单位时间内丙烯或乙烯形成速率增加。
