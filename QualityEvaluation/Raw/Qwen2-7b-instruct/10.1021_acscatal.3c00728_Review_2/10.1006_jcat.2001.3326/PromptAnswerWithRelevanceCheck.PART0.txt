Regular Article Vanadium Oxide Supported on Mesoporous MCM-41 as Selective Catalysts in the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Alkanes
The application of different techniques (51V NMR, diffuse reflectance, and TPR-H2) in the characterization of vanadia supported on mesoporous MCM-41 catalysts shows that the nature of the vanadium species depends on the V loading.
In dehydrated catalysts with V content lower than 7 wt%, vanadium is mainly in a tetrahedral environment.
In the presence of moisture, most V5+, placed in accessible positions, binds to water molecules, becoming hexacoordinated, while some V5+ species, probably located within the pore walls, keep their tetrahedral coordination.
Higher V contents in the catalyst leads to the formation of polymeric V2O5-like species.
Both XRD and textural results indicate that the mesoporous structure of the support is mostly maintained after the vanadium incorporation, and therefore high surface areas were obtained on the final catalysts.
MCM-41-suppported vanadia catalysts are active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane, although the catalytic behavior depends on the V loading.
A high rate of formation of propylene or ethylene per unit mass of catalyst per unit time have also been observed as a consequence of the high dispersion of V atoms achieved on the surface of the support.

The application of various characterization techniques reveals that the nature of vanadium species on mesoporous MCM-41 catalysts varies depending on the vanadium loading. Lower V content results in a predominantly tetrahedral vanadium environment, while higher content forms polymeric V2O5-like structures. Moisture affects the coordination state of V5+ species, which can bind to water molecules or maintain tetrahedral coordination. These catalysts exhibit activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane and ethane, with performance influenced by the vanadium loading. High dispersion of vanadium atoms on the support surface enhances catalytic efficiency.

应用各种表征技术显示，MCM-41载体上的钒物种性质随钒负载量的不同而变化。较低的钒含量导致钒主要处于四面体环境中，而较高含量形成类似V2O5的聚合物结构。水分影响V5+物种的配位状态，它们可能与水分子结合或保持四面体配位。这些催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢反应中表现出活性和选择性，特别是丙烷和乙烷，其性能受钒负载量的影响。支持表面高分散的钒原子增强了催化效率。

With moisture presence, most V5+ ions bind to water molecules, becoming hexacoordinated, while some V5+ species maintain their tetrahedral coordination. Higher vanadium contents lead to the formation of polymeric V2O5-like species. The mesoporous structure of the support is largely preserved after vanadium incorporation, resulting in high surface areas on the final catalysts. These catalysts are active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane, with their catalytic behavior depending on the vanadium loading. High dispersion of vanadium atoms on the support surface leads to an increased rate of formation of propylene or ethylene per unit mass of catalyst per unit time.

在含钒量小于7 wt%的脱水催化剂中，钒主要以四面体环境存在。在水分存在下，大部分V5+离子会与水分子结合，成为六配位，而一些V5+物种则保持其四面体配位。较高的钒含量导致形成类似V2O5的聚合物物种。支持材料的微孔结构在钒掺杂后基本保持不变，最终催化剂具有高比表面积。这些催化剂在丙烷和乙烷的氧化脱氢反应中表现出活性和选择性，其催化性能取决于钒的负载量。表面分散的钒原子导致单位质量催化剂单位时间内的丙烯或乙烯生成速率增加。

The text describes the preparation and characterization of vanadium oxide supported on mesoporous MCM-41 catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. It mentions that the nature of the vanadium species varies depending on the vanadium loading. In lower V content catalysts, vanadium is predominantly in a tetrahedral environment. With higher V contents, polymeric V2O5-like species form. The text also indicates that the mesoporous structure of the support remains intact upon vanadium incorporation, leading to catalysts with high surface areas. These catalysts exhibit activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane, with the catalytic performance being dependent on the vanadium loading. The high dispersion of vanadium atoms on the support surface results in a high rate of propylene or ethylene formation per unit mass of catalyst per unit time.

文本描述了用于烷烃氧化脱氢的二氧化钒支持在微孔MCM-41催化剂的制备和表征。它提到，根据钒负载量，钒物种的性质会有所不同。在较低的V含量催化剂中，钒主要处于四面体环境中。随着V含量的增加，形成聚类的V2O5类似物。文本还表明，支撑材料的微孔结构在掺杂钒后保持不变，导致催化剂具有高比表面积。这些催化剂在丙烷和乙烷的氧化脱氢反应中表现出活性和选择性，催化性能依赖于钒负载量。支持表面的高分散度钒原子导致每单位催化剂质量每单位时间形成高比例的丙烯或乙烯。

Vanadium oxide supported on mesoporous MCM-41 catalysts exhibit different properties based on vanadium loading. At lower loads, typically less than 7 wt%, vanadium forms a tetrahedral environment. Upon hydration, vanadium ions bind to water molecules, transforming into hexacoordinated species. At higher loads, polymeric V2O5-like structures form. These catalysts are active and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane. The high dispersion of vanadium atoms on the support surface leads to an increased rate of propylene or ethylene formation per unit mass of catalyst per unit time.
