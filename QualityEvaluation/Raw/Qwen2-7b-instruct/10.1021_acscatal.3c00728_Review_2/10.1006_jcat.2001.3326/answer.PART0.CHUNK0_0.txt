Regular Article Vanadium Oxide Supported on Mesoporous MCM-41 as Selective Catalysts in the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Alkanes
The application of different techniques (51V NMR, diffuse reflectance, and TPR-H2) in the characterization of vanadia supported on mesoporous MCM-41 catalysts shows that the nature of the vanadium species depends on the V loading.
In dehydrated catalysts with V content lower than 7 wt%, vanadium is mainly in a tetrahedral environment.
In the presence of moisture, most V5+, placed in accessible positions, binds to water molecules, becoming hexacoordinated, while some V5+ species, probably located within the pore walls, keep their tetrahedral coordination.
Higher V contents in the catalyst leads to the formation of polymeric V2O5-like species.
Both XRD and textural results indicate that the mesoporous structure of the support is mostly maintained after the vanadium incorporation, and therefore high surface areas were obtained on the final catalysts.
MCM-41-suppported vanadia catalysts are active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane, although the catalytic behavior depends on the V loading.
A high rate of formation of propylene or ethylene per unit mass of catalyst per unit time have also been observed as a consequence of the high dispersion of V atoms achieved on the surface of the support.

The application of various characterization techniques reveals that the nature of vanadium species on mesoporous MCM-41 catalysts varies depending on the vanadium loading. Lower V content results in a predominantly tetrahedral vanadium environment, while higher content forms polymeric V2O5-like structures. Moisture affects the coordination state of V5+ species, which can bind to water molecules or maintain tetrahedral coordination. These catalysts exhibit activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane and ethane, with performance influenced by the vanadium loading. High dispersion of vanadium atoms on the support surface enhances catalytic efficiency.

应用各种表征技术显示，MCM-41载体上的钒物种性质随钒负载量的不同而变化。较低的钒含量导致钒主要处于四面体环境中，而较高含量形成类似V2O5的聚合物结构。水分影响V5+物种的配位状态，它们可能与水分子结合或保持四面体配位。这些催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢反应中表现出活性和选择性，特别是丙烷和乙烷，其性能受钒负载量的影响。支持表面高分散的钒原子增强了催化效率。
