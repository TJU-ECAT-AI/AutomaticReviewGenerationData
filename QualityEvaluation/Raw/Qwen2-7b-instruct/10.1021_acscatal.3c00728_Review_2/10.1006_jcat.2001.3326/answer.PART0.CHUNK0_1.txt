Regular Article Vanadium Oxide Supported on Mesoporous MCM-41 as Selective Catalysts in the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Alkanes
The application of different techniques (51V NMR, diffuse reflectance, and TPR-H2) in the characterization of vanadia supported on mesoporous MCM-41 catalysts shows that the nature of the vanadium species depends on the V loading.
In dehydrated catalysts with V content lower than 7 wt%, vanadium is mainly in a tetrahedral environment.
In the presence of moisture, most V5+, placed in accessible positions, binds to water molecules, becoming hexacoordinated, while some V5+ species, probably located within the pore walls, keep their tetrahedral coordination.
Higher V contents in the catalyst leads to the formation of polymeric V2O5-like species.
Both XRD and textural results indicate that the mesoporous structure of the support is mostly maintained after the vanadium incorporation, and therefore high surface areas were obtained on the final catalysts.
MCM-41-suppported vanadia catalysts are active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane, although the catalytic behavior depends on the V loading.
A high rate of formation of propylene or ethylene per unit mass of catalyst per unit time have also been observed as a consequence of the high dispersion of V atoms achieved on the surface of the support.

High dispersion of vanadium atoms on the support surface leads to an increased rate of formation of propylene or ethylene per unit mass of catalyst per unit time.

在含钒量小于7 wt%的脱水催化剂中，钒主要以四面体环境存在。在水分存在下，大部分V5+离子会与水分子结合，成为六配位，而一些V5+物种则保持其四面体配位。较高的钒含量导致形成类似V2O5的聚合物物种。支持材料的微孔结构在钒掺杂后基本保持不变，最终催化剂具有高比表面积。这些催化剂在丙烷和乙烷的氧化脱氢反应中表现出活性和选择性，其催化性能取决于钒的负载量。表面分散的钒原子导致单位质量催化剂单位时间内的丙烯或乙烯生成速率增加。
