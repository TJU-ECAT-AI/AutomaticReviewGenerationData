3.1. Effect of reaction temperature
"In the previous study, gas phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime over zirconia based catalysts was carried out at 300C and 350C [14] . A 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst showed the highest lactam yield (>94%) at either temperature for 6 h of reaction."
3.2. Comparison with other supports
"A total of six oxides, ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO and HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25), are used, respectively, to support 10% B2O3 for the rearrangement at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h."
3.3. Effect of the boria load
"Improvement of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst is made with optimizing the boria load. The catalysts with different boria load are compared for the Beckmann reaction at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h."
3.4. IR and NH3-TPD measurements
"The present data suggest that B2O3/ZrO2 is highly active and selective for the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime. At 10% boria load level the catalyst supported on zirconia shows much higher yield for the lactam syntheis than the ones on the other supports used in the present study."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the optimization of a boron-based catalyst, specifically a B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst, for the gas phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime. The study shows that this catalyst is highly active and selective, producing ε-caprolactam at 300-320°C. The performance of the catalyst is influenced by the boron oxide (boria) load, with the best performance observed at a 10% load level. This corresponds to two overlayers of boria on the zirconia support. The catalysts' structure, acidity, and catalytic performance are characterized through infrared spectroscopy (IR) and thermogravimetric analysis with ammonia (NH3-TPD). The IR spectra reveal that the presence of intermediate strong acid sites, responsible for ammonia desorption at 200-400°C, correlates with the lactam yield. The optimal boria load ensures a balance between the number of acid sites and the activity of the catalyst, leading to high lactam selectivity and stability.

3.2. Comparison with other supports
"The catalysts supported on ZrO2, TiO2, and HZSM-5 are highly selective for the lactam synthesis (ca. 95%). Medium lactam selectivity (ca. 70%) is obtained over SiO2 and Al2O3 supported catalysts ( Fig. 3 b), which is consistent with earlier studies in the literature [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ."
3.3. Effect of the boria load
"It is clear that all of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts are far superior to the support alone (with zero boria load, Fig. 4 ) for the Beckmann reaction. The support without boria is initially selective for the formation of cyclohexanone (6070%); considerable selectivity for the lactam (<50%) develops at longer TOS ( Fig. 5 )."
3.4. IR and NH3-TPD measurements
"The resultant TPD profiles are shown in Fig. 8 . Desorption of adsorbed NH3 from the catalyst covers a broad range of temperature (50400C) and features three peaks centered at about 100C, 200C, and 300C, respectively. The total desorbed ammonia or total area of the TPD peaks decreases with the boria load, indicating a reduction of the total number of acid sites."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves stacking boron onto the first monolayer of their boron oxide (BO4) colleagues on the zirconia surface. This process creates a structure with mainly BO3 as the active site units, with a BO4 sublayer lying between the support surface and the BO3 structures. This unique structural feature allows for a higher density of active sites and enhanced catalytic performance compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. The advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites include increased efficiency due to the higher concentration of active sites, which leads to better conversion rates and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest because they promise to improve the performance and efficiency of catalysts in the ODHP process, potentially leading to reduced energy consumption and increased yield.

In conclusion, 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through the stacking of boron onto the first monolayer of BO4 structures on the zirconia surface, resulting in a structure with BO3 as the main active site units. This configuration offers several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including a higher density of active sites and improved catalytic performance, which have made these unique structures a focus of extensive research in the field of catalyst development.

[1] "It is common for these supported boria catalysts that the lactam selectivity increases with increasing the boria load."
[2] "Judgement of the optimum boria load of these catalysts can only be made from the maximum activity or conversion of the oxime (Fig. 4, Fig. 6)."
[3] "While it seems difficult to extend this observation, based on the samples with 10% boria load, to the cases when boria catalysts supported on the other supports are optimized with boria loaded, the very high selectivity for the desired lactam over this 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst (90-97%) exceeds over those (<90%) documented for impregnation B2O3/SiO2 and B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts [7], [8], [9], [10]."
[4] "The performance of the B2O3/MgO catalyst, which produces no lactam but cyclohexanone and aniline and is similar to that of Na-ZrO2 and Na-Al2O3 in previous reports [9], [14], confirms that the formation of ε-caprolactam does not proceed over a surface that possesses strong basic sites."

The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are developed through the stacking of boria onto the first monolayer of their BO4 colleagues on the zirconia surface. This process creates a structure containing mainly BO3 as the structure units with a BO4 sublayer lying between the support surface and the BO3 structures. These 2-D dispersed active sites offer specific advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, particularly in terms of increased active site density and enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed sites have attracted significant research interest because they enable a more efficient utilization of the active sites, leading to improved catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

In the context of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts facilitate a more controlled and selective transformation of propane molecules. The increased density of active sites within the 2-D dispersed structure allows for a higher concentration of reactive sites per unit area, which can lead to faster reaction rates and higher conversion efficiencies. Additionally, the specific arrangement of these sites can promote the formation of desired products with improved selectivity, as opposed to the potential formation of unwanted byproducts that might occur with linearly dispersed edge sites.

The advantages offered by 2-D dispersed active sites, such as higher active site density and enhanced catalytic performance, have attracted significant research interest in the field of catalysis. These unique structural features allow for more efficient utilization of the active sites, which can lead to improved reaction kinetics, higher product yields, and lower energy consumption. As a result, these catalysts have potential applications in various chemical processes, including the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, the synthesis of fine chemicals, and the production of high-value petrochemical intermediates. Further research is ongoing to optimize the preparation methods, catalyst design, and operating conditions to fully exploit the benefits of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction and other related chemical transformations.
