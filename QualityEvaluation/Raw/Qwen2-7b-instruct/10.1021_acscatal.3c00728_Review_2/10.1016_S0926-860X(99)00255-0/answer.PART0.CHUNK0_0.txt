3.1. Effect of reaction temperature
"In the previous study, gas phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime over zirconia based catalysts was carried out at 300C and 350C [14] . A 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst showed the highest lactam yield (>94%) at either temperature for 6 h of reaction."
3.2. Comparison with other supports
"A total of six oxides, ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO and HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25), are used, respectively, to support 10% B2O3 for the rearrangement at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h."
3.3. Effect of the boria load
"Improvement of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst is made with optimizing the boria load. The catalysts with different boria load are compared for the Beckmann reaction at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h."
3.4. IR and NH3-TPD measurements
"The present data suggest that B2O3/ZrO2 is highly active and selective for the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime. At 10% boria load level the catalyst supported on zirconia shows much higher yield for the lactam syntheis than the ones on the other supports used in the present study."

The document discusses the optimization of a boron-based catalyst, specifically a B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst, for the gas phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime. The study shows that this catalyst is highly active and selective, producing ε-caprolactam at 300-320°C. The performance of the catalyst is influenced by the boron oxide (boria) load, with the best performance observed at a 10% load level. This corresponds to two overlayers of boria on the zirconia support. The catalysts' structure, acidity, and catalytic performance are characterized through infrared spectroscopy (IR) and thermogravimetric analysis with ammonia (NH3-TPD). The IR spectra reveal that the presence of intermediate strong acid sites, responsible for ammonia desorption at 200-400°C, correlates with the lactam yield. The optimal boria load ensures a balance between the number of acid sites and the activity of the catalyst, leading to high lactam selectivity and stability.

本文讨论了用于环己酮肟气相贝克曼重排的硼基催化剂（B2O3/ZrO2）的优化。研究表明，这种催化剂在300-320°C下对ε-己内酰胺的合成具有高活性和选择性。催化剂性能受到氧化硼（硼酸）负载的影响，在10%负载水平时达到最佳状态。这相当于一层在锆酸盐表面的硼酸层。通过红外光谱（IR）和氨（NH3-TPD）热重分析来表征催化剂的结构、酸性和催化性能。红外光谱显示，负责在200-400°C脱附氨的中间强酸位点与乳酸产量成正比。最佳的硼酸负载确保了酸位数和催化剂活性之间的平衡，导致高乳酸选择性和稳定性。
