3.1. Effect of reaction temperature

"In the previous study, gas phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime over zirconia based catalysts was carried out at 300C and 350C [14] . A 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst showed the highest lactam yield (>94%) at either temperature for 6 h of reaction."

3.2. Comparison with other supports

"A total of six oxides, ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO and HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25), are used, respectively, to support 10% B2O3 for the rearrangement at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h."

3.3. Effect of the boria load

"Improvement of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst is made with optimizing the boria load. The catalysts with different boria load are compared for the Beckmann reaction at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h."

3.4. IR and NH3-TPD measurements

"The present data suggest that B2O3/ZrO2 is highly active and selective for the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime. At 10% boria load level the catalyst supported on zirconia shows much higher yield for the lactam syntheis than the ones on the other supports used in the present study."

1. The 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst demonstrated the highest lactam yield over 94% at both 300C and 350C for a 6-hour reaction duration.

2. A variety of oxide supports including ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, and HZSM-5 (with a Si/Al ratio of 25) were utilized for supporting 10% B2O3 in the rearrangement at 300C for a period of 6 hours.

3. Optimization of the boria load led to enhanced catalyst activity and selectivity for the rearrangement at 300C.

4. The B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst exhibited high activity and selectivity for the rearrangement, surpassing other catalysts when supported on zirconia at a 10% boria load level.
