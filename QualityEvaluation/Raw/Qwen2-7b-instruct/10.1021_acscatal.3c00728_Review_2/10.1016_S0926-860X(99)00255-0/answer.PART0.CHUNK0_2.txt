3.1. Effect of reaction temperature
"In the previous study, gas phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime over zirconia based catalysts was carried out at 300C and 350C [14] . A 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst showed the highest lactam yield (>94%) at either temperature for 6 h of reaction."
3.2. Comparison with other supports
"The catalysts supported on ZrO2, TiO2, and HZSM-5 are highly selective for the lactam synthesis (ca. 95%). Medium lactam selectivity (ca. 70%) is obtained over SiO2 and Al2O3 supported catalysts ( Fig. 3 b), which is consistent with earlier studies in the literature [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ."
3.3. Effect of the boria load
"It is clear that all of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts are far superior to the support alone (with zero boria load, Fig. 4 ) for the Beckmann reaction. The support without boria is initially selective for the formation of cyclohexanone (6070%); considerable selectivity for the lactam (<50%) develops at longer TOS ( Fig. 5 )."
3.4. IR and NH3-TPD measurements
"The resultant TPD profiles are shown in Fig. 8 . Desorption of adsorbed NH3 from the catalyst covers a broad range of temperature (50400C) and features three peaks centered at about 100C, 200C, and 300C, respectively. The total desorbed ammonia or total area of the TPD peaks decreases with the boria load, indicating a reduction of the total number of acid sites."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves stacking boron onto the first monolayer of their boron oxide (BO4) colleagues on the zirconia surface. This process creates a structure with mainly BO3 as the active site units, with a BO4 sublayer lying between the support surface and the BO3 structures. This unique structural feature allows for a higher density of active sites and enhanced catalytic performance compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. The advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites include increased efficiency due to the higher concentration of active sites, which leads to better conversion rates and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest because they promise to improve the performance and efficiency of catalysts in the ODHP process, potentially leading to reduced energy consumption and increased yield.

In conclusion, 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through the stacking of boron onto the first monolayer of BO4 structures on the zirconia surface, resulting in a structure with BO3 as the main active site units. This configuration offers several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including a higher density of active sites and improved catalytic performance, which have made these unique structures a focus of extensive research in the field of catalyst development.
