[1] "In the present study, we show that the catalytic performance of B2O3/ZrO2 is superior to boria supported on Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2, MgO, and HZSM-5."
[2] "It is shown that the lactam yield is correlated with the number of intermediate strong acid sites that are responsible for ammonia desorption at 200400C."
[3] "The optimum boria load (10%) of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst corresponds to two overlayers of boria on the support."
[4] "The performance of supported boria catalysts can be improved by proper control of variable factors such as nature of the support, load and dispersion of boria."

1. The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through the strategic stacking of boron atoms onto the first monolayer of boron oxide (BO4) on the zirconia surface, forming a second layer of BO3 units. These 2-D dispersed sites offer higher active site density and enhanced catalytic performance compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. Their unique structural features have attracted significant research interest due to their ability to increase the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP reaction.

1. 在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应中，硼基催化剂中的二维分散活性位点通过将硼原子有策略地堆叠到锆石上第一层的硼酸盐（BO4）上形成第二层BO3单元来开发。这些二维分散的位点提供了更高的活性位点密度和增强的催化性能，与线性分散的边缘位点相比。它们的独特结构特征吸引了大量的研究兴趣，因为它们能够提高ODHP反应的效率和选择性。
