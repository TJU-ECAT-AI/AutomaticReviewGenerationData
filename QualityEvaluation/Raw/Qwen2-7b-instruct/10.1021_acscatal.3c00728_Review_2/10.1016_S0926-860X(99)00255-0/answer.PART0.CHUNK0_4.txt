[1] "It is common for these supported boria catalysts that the lactam selectivity increases with increasing the boria load."
[2] "Judgement of the optimum boria load of these catalysts can only be made from the maximum activity or conversion of the oxime (Fig. 4, Fig. 6)."
[3] "While it seems difficult to extend this observation, based on the samples with 10% boria load, to the cases when boria catalysts supported on the other supports are optimized with boria loaded, the very high selectivity for the desired lactam over this 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst (90-97%) exceeds over those (<90%) documented for impregnation B2O3/SiO2 and B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts [7], [8], [9], [10]."
[4] "The performance of the B2O3/MgO catalyst, which produces no lactam but cyclohexanone and aniline and is similar to that of Na-ZrO2 and Na-Al2O3 in previous reports [9], [14], confirms that the formation of ε-caprolactam does not proceed over a surface that possesses strong basic sites."

The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are developed through the stacking of boria onto the first monolayer of their BO4 colleagues on the zirconia surface. This process creates a structure containing mainly BO3 as the structure units with a BO4 sublayer lying between the support surface and the BO3 structures. These 2-D dispersed active sites offer specific advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, particularly in terms of increased active site density and enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed sites have attracted significant research interest because they enable a more efficient utilization of the active sites, leading to improved catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

In the context of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts facilitate a more controlled and selective transformation of propane molecules. The increased density of active sites within the 2-D dispersed structure allows for a higher concentration of reactive sites per unit area, which can lead to faster reaction rates and higher conversion efficiencies. Additionally, the specific arrangement of these sites can promote the formation of desired products with improved selectivity, as opposed to the potential formation of unwanted byproducts that might occur with linearly dispersed edge sites.

The advantages offered by 2-D dispersed active sites, such as higher active site density and enhanced catalytic performance, have attracted significant research interest in the field of catalysis. These unique structural features allow for more efficient utilization of the active sites, which can lead to improved reaction kinetics, higher product yields, and lower energy consumption. As a result, these catalysts have potential applications in various chemical processes, including the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, the synthesis of fine chemicals, and the production of high-value petrochemical intermediates. Further research is ongoing to optimize the preparation methods, catalyst design, and operating conditions to fully exploit the benefits of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction and other related chemical transformations.
