1. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional distribution of active sites on the surface of the catalyst. These sites offer higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, leading to enhanced catalytic performance due to increased contact between reactants and catalyst sites.
2. The specific advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites include higher active site density, which results in greater efficiency and selectivity in the ODHP reaction. This is because more reactant molecules can interact with the active sites simultaneously, leading to improved conversion rates and product yields. Additionally, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed sites attract significant research interest as they may enable better control over the reaction pathways, potentially leading to the production of higher-value products.
