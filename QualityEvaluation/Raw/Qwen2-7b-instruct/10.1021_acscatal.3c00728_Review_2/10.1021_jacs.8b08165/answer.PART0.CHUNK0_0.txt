1. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional distribution of active sites on the surface of boron nitride materials. These sites are positioned in a plane rather than along a linear edge, which allows for a higher density of active sites per unit area compared to traditional linearly dispersed edge sites. This increased density leads to improved catalytic performance, as more reactant molecules come into contact with the active sites, enhancing the rate and efficiency of the ODHP reaction.
2. The specific advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance are rooted in their geometric arrangement. By dispersing the active sites in a two-dimensional plane, the surface area available for reactions increases significantly, allowing for a greater number of active sites per unit volume. This results in a higher concentration of active sites that can interact with reactants, leading to faster reaction kinetics and potentially higher yields of desired products. The enhanced density of active sites also contributes to better utilization of the catalyst, reducing the likelihood of product inhibition and maintaining high conversion rates even at high reaction pressures and temperatures.
3. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites have attracted significant research interest in the field due to their potential to revolutionize catalytic processes. The high density of active sites and improved efficiency offered by this configuration promise to reduce energy consumption, lower production costs, and increase the selectivity of chemical reactions. These advancements could lead to more sustainable and economically viable manufacturing processes, particularly in industries relying on the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons for the production of valuable chemicals and fuels. The detailed study of these materials' properties and mechanisms under various reaction conditions is crucial for optimizing their performance and broadening their applications in industry.

1. 在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应中，通过在硼氮化物材料表面形成二维分布的活性位点来开发硼基催化剂。这些位点以平面形式排列，而不是沿线性边缘分散，这使得单位面积内的活性位点密度比传统线性分散边缘位点高。这种更高的密度导致催化性能增强，因为更多的反应物分子与活性位点接触，提高了反应速率和效率。
2. 与线性分散边缘位点相比，2-D分散活性位点在活性位点密度和催化性能方面的特定优势源于它们的几何排列方式。通过在二维平面上分散活性位点，可以显著增加表面面积，允许每单位体积内有更多活性位点。这导致活性位点的更高浓度，能够与反应物相互作用，从而加快反应动力学并可能提高所需产品的产率。活性位点的高密度也有助于更好地利用催化剂，即使在高压和高温下，也能维持高的转化率。这种配置还能降低能耗、减少生产成本，并提高化学反应的选择性，特别是在依赖氧化脱氢化烃生产有价值的化学品和燃料的工业领域。
3. 由于这些独特的结构特征提供了潜在的改进效率和选择性，2-D分散活性位点在研究领域引起了广泛关注。高密度的活性位点和改进的效率有望降低能源消耗、降低生产成本，并扩大工业应用。为了优化这些材料的性能并拓宽其应用范围，对这些材料在各种反应条件下的详细性质和机制进行研究至关重要。
