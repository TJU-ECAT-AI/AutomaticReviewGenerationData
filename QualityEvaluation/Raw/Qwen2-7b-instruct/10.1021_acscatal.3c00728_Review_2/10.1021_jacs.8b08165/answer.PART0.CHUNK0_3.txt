Answer: The literature does not provide specific details on how 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. It also lacks information on the advantages these sites offer over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance. Furthermore, there is no mention of why these unique structural features have attracted significant research interest in the field.
