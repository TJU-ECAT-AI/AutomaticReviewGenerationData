[1] "In recent years, the rich availability and low-cost of worldwide natural gas and shale gas production (Fig. 1b) have motivated the development of industrial techniques towards the gas-based dehydrogenation routes to obtain light olefins."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, featured by its intrinsic exothermicity and being free of coke, is a promising alternative to direct dehydrogenation."
[3] "The presence of hotspots in the catalyst bed is a typical phenomenon in the ODH of light alkanes owing to its highly exothermic nature, which can significantly accelerate the undesired over-oxidation of olefins, leading to a low selectivity to olefins."
[4] "Owing to its moderate electronegativity (2.0 in Pauling scale), boron may form borides with metal or nonmetal elements."
[5] "Boron oxide (B2O3) with low melting point (450 C) and low viscosity (436 Poise at 750 C) is mainly found in the vitreous form featuring a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles with a comparatively high fraction of six-membered rings (boroxol rings) and a portion of non-ring BO3/2 units."
[6] "Supported boron oxide catalysts consist of tri-coordinated BO3 species and tetra-coordinated BO4 species, and the proportion of tetra-coordinated BO4 species is closely related to the enhanced Brnsted acidity when increasing the amount of loaded boron oxide."
[7] "The BOS catalyst contained four types of boron species (Fig. 7a and b), i.e. boroxol ring (B(3a)), tri-coordinated hydroxylated linear BO3/2 (B(3b)), and tri-coordinated planar boron species (B(3c)) and a tetra-coordinated tetrahedral boron species (B(4)) which were fused into the silica matrix."
[8] "The layered borosilicate zeolites showed comparable catalytic activity with h-BN in the ODH of propane, and increasing boron content resulted in higher propane conversion with the propane conversion of 5.6%, 9.3% and 30.6% corresponding to the boron content of 1.54 wt.% (BZEO-1), 2.48 wt.% (BZEO-2) and 4.88 wt.% (BZEO-3), respectively (Fig. 8c)."

1. Two-Dimensional (2-D) dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through the assembly of 2D hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) into a 3D spherical superstructure, which exposes a larger number of active sites per unit volume compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. This results in higher active site density and improved catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D sites attract significant research interest due to their potential to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP reaction.

2. The advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites include:
   - **Increased Active Site Density**: 2-D sites provide a higher density of active sites, enhancing the catalyst's reactivity and selectivity towards the desired products.
   - **Enhanced Catalytic Performance**: The increased surface area and accessibility of reactants at 2-D sites leads to better performance in terms of product yield and selectivity.
   - **Potential for Selective Reactions**: The unique geometry of 2-D sites may enable more controlled and selective chemical reactions, reducing the formation of byproducts.
   - **Optimal Reaction Conditions**: The 3D spherical superstructure may help in maintaining optimal reaction conditions, reducing hotspots and improving mass transfer within the catalyst bed.

3. Research interest in 2-D dispersed active sites stems from their potential to overcome limitations associated with traditional linearly dispersed edge sites, such as reduced active site density and challenges in achieving high selectivity in the ODHP reaction. These sites offer a promising avenue for developing more efficient and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.
