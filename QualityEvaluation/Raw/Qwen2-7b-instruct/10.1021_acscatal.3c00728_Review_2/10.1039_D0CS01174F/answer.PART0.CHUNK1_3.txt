[1] "In the survey of h-BN and BNNT catalytic systems, Lu et al. noticed81 a low initial activity (<3%) in ODH of propane prior to reaching their stable performance, which implicated an activation period."
[2] "This suggested that the intact boron nitrides were inert to the reactants under the ODH reaction conditions, and the high catalytic activity of boron nitrides was the consequence of their in situ surface functionalization."
[3] "Thus, tailoring functional groups of boron nitride would be beneficial for optimal catalytic performance, and help to understand the nature of the active sites and catalytic origin."
[4] "In a detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst,39 aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified a large number of accessible edges generated after functionalization at the edges (Fig. 10a), and showed that lattice relaxations and distortions occurred exclusively at the edge of the layer."
[5] "Borohydride (BOH) groups were also reported38 in the study of ODH of propane on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of the materials in their fresh and spent forms by means of advance experimental techniques."
[6] "The presence of BOH groups was also reported38 in the study of ODH of propane on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of the materials in their fresh and spent forms by means of advance experimental techniques, e.g. XPS, ATR-IR, and DRIFTS, and the hypothetical peroxyl-bridged armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) was proposed to serve as an active site in the ODHP reaction."
[7] "Recently, Rossini and co-workers201 identified the existence of boron hydroxide/oxide termination on h-BN edges by means of combined 11B, 14N and 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy and plane-wave DFT calculations."
[8] "These results implicated that the boron-based catalysts have similar active phases of oxygenated species (BO or BOH) on the catalyst surfaces."
[9] "To better understand the structure of the active sites, Lu and coworkers synthesized mesoporous silica-supported boron oxide catalysts (B2O3/SBA-15) and identified four B species by using the 11B NMR technique,44 two of which on the upfield side (B(3a) and B(3B) in Fig. 7a) were considered as the responsible species for the activity by analyzing their variations before and after the ODHP test."
[10] "The activity of tricoordinated boron species and the inertness of tetracoordinated species were confirmed in further studies of the boronsilicate zeolite catalytic system.46,171 These studies also showed that clustered distribution of tricoordinated boron species is necessary."
[11] "The governing role of oxygenated boron species in the ODH of light alkanes has been extended to explain the activity of other boron-based materials, e.g. B4C, Ti2B, NiB, elemental boron,40 and silicon boride203 In these catalytic systems, resembling surface species and kinetic behaviors to h-BN in the ODH reaction were observed."

1. Two-dimensional dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are developed through functionalization of the material surface, which increases the density of active sites compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. This leads to improved catalytic performance due to the higher concentration of active sites available for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. These unique structural features attract significant research interest because they can enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process, potentially leading to more environmentally friendly and economically viable methods of producing valuable olefins.

2. The advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction include:
   - Increased active site density, which leads to higher catalytic activity and faster reaction rates.
   - Enhanced stability of the active sites, as they are protected within the 2-D structure, reducing the likelihood of deactivation due to oxidative environments.
   - Improved selectivity for the formation of olefins, as the 2-D dispersion allows for more controlled and directed reactions, minimizing unwanted side reactions.
   - Potential for easier access to the active sites for reactants, facilitating more efficient and uniform catalysis across the entire surface of the catalyst.
   - Enhanced thermal conductivity, which aids in managing heat dissipation during the exothermic ODHP reaction, preventing overheating and hotspots in the catalyst bed.

These features have attracted significant research interest because they offer a promising avenue for developing more efficient and selective catalysts for the ODHP process, which is crucial for the production of valuable olefins in a sustainable manner.
