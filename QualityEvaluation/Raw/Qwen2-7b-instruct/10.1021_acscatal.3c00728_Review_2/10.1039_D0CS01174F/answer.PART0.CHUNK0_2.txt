[1] "In recent years, the rich availability and low-cost of worldwide natural gas and shale gas production (Fig. 1b) have motivated the development of industrial techniques towards the gas-based dehydrogenation routes to obtain light olefins."
[2] "The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst49 offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues."

[4] "BPO4 was also used as a support in ODH catalytic systems. A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere (Fig. 9e) was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane,48 and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a selectivity of 66.4% for propylene and 18.4% for ethylene at a propane conversion of 24.7%. The loaded B2O3 was proposed in its molten state and worked as the active species, as in previous work of boron-containing catalytic systems, and BPO4 acted not only as a support, but also as a cocatalyst in the reaction.48"

The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. Firstly, 2-D dispersed sites increase the density of active sites on the catalyst surface, enhancing the catalytic performance. Secondly, these unique structural features allow for better control over the reaction pathways, leading to improved selectivity for desired products. Lastly, the research interest in these catalysts stems from their ability to efficiently convert propane to olefins with minimal side reactions, particularly deep oxidation, which is a significant challenge in traditional catalytic processes. The development of such catalysts is crucial for the industrialization of the ODHP reaction, aiming to produce light olefins in a more environmentally friendly manner with reduced energy consumption and emissions.
