[1] "In the survey of h-BN and BNNT catalytic systems, Lu et al. noticed81 a low initial activity (<3%) in ODH of propane prior to reaching their stable performance, which implicated an activation period."
[2] "This suggested that the intact boron nitrides were inert to the reactants under the ODH reaction conditions, and the high catalytic activity of boron nitrides was the consequence of their in situ surface functionalization."
[3] "The BNOH catalyst offered a good test bed to verify the active sites by a tidy assembly of oxygenated groups at the edges or the defects mainly in the form of >BOH, BOB, which may be easily accessible for substrates."
[4] "This was consistent with the opinion in earlier work,39 that the oxygenated boron species at the zig-zag edge were the active sites."
[5] "The presence of BOH groups was also reported38 in the study of ODH of propane on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of the materials in their fresh and spent forms by means of advance experimental techniques, e.g. XPS, ATR-IR, and DRIFTS, and the hypothetical peroxyl-bridged armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) was proposed to serve as an active site in the ODHP reaction."
[6] "Recently, Rossini and co-workers201 identified the existence of boron hydroxide/oxide termination on h-BN edges by means of combined 11B, 14N and 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy and plane-wave DFT calculations."
[7] "The governing role of oxygenated boron species in the ODH of light alkanes has been extended to explain the activity of other boron-based materials, e.g. B4C, Ti2B, NiB, elemental boron,40 and silicon boride203 In these catalytic systems, resembling surface species and kinetic behaviors to h-BN in the ODH reaction were observed."
[8] "These results implicated that the boron-based catalysts have similar active phases of oxygenated species (BO or BOH) on the catalyst surfaces."
[9] "Note that these incorporated species were considered inactive in the ODH of propane in an earlier work.44"

The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through the functionalization of boron nitride edges or defects, primarily in the form of >BOH, BOB groups. These unique structural features offer higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. They attract significant research interest because they enable efficient activation of propane molecules, leading to selective formation of propylene and water. The high catalytic activity and the intrinsic property of suppressing over-oxidation of olefins make boron-based catalysts promising choices for industrialization in the ODHP reaction.

2-D分散的活性位点在硼基催化剂中通过硼氮化物边缘或缺陷的功能化发展，主要形式为>BOH、BOB组。这些独特的结构特征提供了比线性分散边缘位更高的活性位点密度。它们吸引了大量的研究兴趣，因为它们能够有效激活丙烷分子，导致选择性生成丙烯和水。高催化活性和抑制烯烃过度氧化的内在特性使得硼基催化剂成为在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中实现工业化的有前景的选择。
