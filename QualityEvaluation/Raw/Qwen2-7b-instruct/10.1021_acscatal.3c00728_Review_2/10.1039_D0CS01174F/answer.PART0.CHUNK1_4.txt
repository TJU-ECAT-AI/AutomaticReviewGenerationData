2.4.1 Nature of the active sites
Identification of the active sites of boron-based catalysts is crucial to understand the catalytic origin, and to guide the design and evaluation of new boron-based catalysts. In the survey of h-BN and BNNT catalytic systems, Lu et al. noticed81 a low initial activity (<3%) in ODH of propane prior to reaching their stable performance, which implicated an activation period. This suggested that the intact boron nitrides were inert to the reactants under the ODH reaction conditions, and the high catalytic activity of boron nitrides was the consequence of their in situ surface functionalization. Thus, tailoring functional groups of boron nitride would be beneficial for optimal catalytic performance, and help to understand the nature of the active sites and catalytic origin.
In a detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst,39 aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified a large number of accessible edges generated after functionalization at the edges (Fig. 10a), and showed that lattice relaxations and distortions occurred exclusively at the edge of the layer. Boron K-edge electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM mode showed that the B/N ratio at the edge (1.28, point 2 in Fig. 10b) was higher than that of the in-plane (0.95, point 4 in Fig. 10b). This result suggested that a gradual substitution of nitrogen by oxygen occurred during the functionalization of pristine boron nitride. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and 2D 11B multiple quantum (MQ) magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectrum identified that there were two types of BO groups on the catalyst surface: the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms and the BOH sites (Fig. 10c and d).

2.4.2 Reaction mechanisms
Characterization of the kinetics of the ODH reactions via advanced experimental techniques provided abundant information to understand the underlying mechanism. The combination of in situ FTIR and online MS showed39 that the signals of OH groups of the BNOH catalyst remained unchanged in the absence of O2 in the feed gas, but diminished in the presence of O2, implicating that the co-presence of alkane and O2 is a prerequisite in the ODH of light alkanes catalyzed by boron-based catalysts. The diminished signals of an OH group could be recovered under a steam atmosphere (Fig. 12a), which, together with the isotope labelling experiment, showed the direct involvement of water in the replenish of the BOH groups. These spectroscopic data and kinetic experiments indicated that the hydrogen and oxygen atoms of OH(D) groups were involved in the reaction process (Fig. 12b and c), which also lent support to a later computational study of the mechanism that considered the breakage of the BO(H) bond during the reaction.204 The kinetic analysis suggested that the reaction order of O2 was 0.5, implicating the dissociation of O2 in the ODH reaction. The reaction order of C3H8 was calculated to be 2, and the kinetic isotope effects of CH cleavage were measured to be 1.4 for primary hydrogen abstraction and 1.5 for secondary hydrogen abstraction. The results suggested that activation of propane determined the total reaction rate, based on which a reaction mechanism was proposed78,81 (Fig. 12d) initiated by the reaction of BOH groups with O2 to generate active species that may further dehydrogenate propane to produce propylene and water, and recover BOH groups.

The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts, specifically in boron nitride (BN), offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed sites allow for a higher density of active sites, enhancing catalytic performance. These sites are more reactive due to their specific arrangement and surface chemistry, which facilitates the activation of reactants and the formation of active intermediates. The high density of active sites leads to increased efficiency in the reaction process, allowing for faster and more complete conversions of reactants into products.

These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest because they enable the development of highly active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The ability to tailor the functional groups of boron nitride helps in optimizing catalytic performance and understanding the nature of the active sites. By controlling the surface chemistry, researchers can enhance the catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity of the catalysts, making them promising candidates for industrial applications.

In contrast to linearly dispersed edge sites, which might have fewer opportunities for reactant access and less efficient activation, the 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts provide a larger surface area for reaction, leading to improved performance. The detailed analysis of the active sites, such as the identification of BO and BOH groups, further elucidates the mechanism of action and helps in designing more effective catalysts.

The research interest in these unique structural features is driven by the potential to overcome challenges associated with traditional catalysts, such as over-oxidation of olefins and the need for high selectivity in producing valuable carbon-based products. By leveraging the enhanced activity and selectivity provided by 2-D dispersed active sites, boron-based catalysts offer a promising avenue for industrialization of the ODHP process, minimizing CO2 emissions and achieving high productivity for light olefins.
