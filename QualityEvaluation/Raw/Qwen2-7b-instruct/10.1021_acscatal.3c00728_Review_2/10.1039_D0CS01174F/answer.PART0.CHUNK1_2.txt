[1] "Tailoring functional groups of boron nitride would be beneficial for optimal catalytic performance, and help to understand the nature of the active sites and catalytic origin."
[2] "This suggested that the intact boron nitrides were inert to the reactants under the ODH reaction conditions, and the high catalytic activity of boron nitrides was the consequence of their in situ surface functionalization."
[3] "Thus, tailoring functional groups of boron nitride would be beneficial for optimal catalytic performance, and help to understand the nature of the active sites and catalytic origin."
[4] "The BNOH catalyst offered a good test bed to verify the active sites by a tidy assembly of oxygenated groups at the edges or the defects mainly in the form of >BOH, BOB, which may be easily accessible for substrates."
[5] "This result suggested that a gradual substitution of nitrogen by oxygen occurred during the functionalization of pristine boron nitride."
[6] "Considering the inert nature of pure h-BN, the nascent functional groups (BOB and BOH groups) formed at the edge of BNOH were considered to be responsible for its catalytic activity in the ODH reaction."
[7] "The presence of BOH groups was also reported38 in the study of ODH of propane on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of the materials in their fresh and spent forms by means of advance experimental techniques, e.g. XPS, ATR-IR, and DRIFTS, and the hypothetical peroxyl-bridged armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) was proposed to serve as an active site in the ODHP reaction."
[8] "This was different from the abovementioned hypothesis39 that the oxygenated boron species at the zig-zag edge were the active sites."
[9] "Recently, Rossini and co-workers201 identified the existence of boron hydroxide/oxide termination on h-BN edges by means of combined 11B, 14N and 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy and plane-wave DFT calculations."
[10] "These results implicated that the boron-based catalysts have similar active phases of oxygenated species (BO or BOH) on the catalyst surfaces."
[11] "The activity of tricoordinated boron species and the inertness of tetracoordinated species were confirmed in further studies of the boronsilicate zeolite catalytic system.46,171 These studies also showed that clustered distribution of tricoordinated boron species is necessary."
[12] "This radical-mediated selective oxidation mechanism was previously proposed for the Li/MgO and Li/Dy/MgO catalyst systems,205 which catalyzed selective oxidative cracking of n-butane under O2-lean conditions. This pattern of selectivity appeared nearly identical as in the h-BN catalytic system, implicating potential similarities in the mechanisms between these catalytic systems."
[13] "Further support came from a recent direct detection206 of the gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3) in the ODH of propane by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUP-MS) in which the C3H6 was revealed to mainly form on the h-BN surface while C2 and C1 products were generated from catalyst surfaces and gas-phase pathways."
