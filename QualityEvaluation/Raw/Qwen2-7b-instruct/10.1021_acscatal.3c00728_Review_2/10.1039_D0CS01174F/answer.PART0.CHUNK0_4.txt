1. The development of industrial techniques towards the gas-based dehydrogenation routes to obtain light olefins has been motivated by the rich availability and low-cost of worldwide natural gas and shale gas production. Among the industrialized protocols of direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the Catofin process and Oleflex process are two popularly used processes, where the former uses a chromia-alumina catalyst and the latter a platinum-tin based catalyst.

2. Boron nitrides (BN) exist in three crystalline forms: graphite-like hexagonal BN (h-BN), diamond-like cubic BN (c-BN), and wurtzite BN (w-BN).

3. The h-BN catalytic system showed a selectivity of 79% for propylene and 12% for ethylene at 14% propane conversion, with a COx proportion of 9%. This value was far lower than that produced over traditional VOx/SiO2 catalysts at 9% propane conversion.

4. Home-made edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) demonstrated high selectivity and negligible CO2 formation in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane, achieving high propane conversion (20.6%) and olefin selectivity (80.2% for C3 and 90.9% for C23) with considerably low CO2 formation (0.5%).

5. The edge-hydroxylated boron nitride catalysts lowered the apparent activation energy to 175.3 kJ mol1, indicating that lower energy channels were favored on this catalyst.

6. A boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst was developed to improve olefin selectivity and heat and mass transfer in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. This is vital for industrialization because the high exothermicity of the ODH reaction could produce hotspots, negatively impacting olefin selectivity and safety issues.

7. The dependence of the propane consumption rate on the mass of h-BN was reported to be volcano-like, possibly due to multiple factors including the contribution of gas-phase radical chemistry, the forming and encapsulation of the catalyst, and other issues, which require further clarification.

1. 近年来，由于全球天然气和页岩气产量丰富且成本低廉，工业技术发展了基于天然气的脱氢途径以获取轻质烯烃。在直接脱氢轻烷烃的工业化过程中，Catofin过程和Oleflex过程是两种常用的工艺，前者使用氧化铬-铝催化剂，后者使用铂锡基催化剂。

2. 氮化硼（BN）存在三种结晶形式：石墨状六方氮化硼（h-BN）、金刚石状立方氮化硼（c-BN）和黄铁矿氮化硼（w-BN）。

3. h-BN催化系统在14%丙烷转化率下显示出79%的丙烯选择性和12%的乙烯选择性，COx比例为9%，远低于传统VOx/SiO2催化剂在9%丙烷转化率下的值。

4. 自制边缘羟基化的硼氮化物（BNOH）在丙烷和乙烷的氧化脱氢中显示出了高选择性和几乎无CO2形成，实现了高达20.6%的丙烷转化率和80.2%（C3）至90.9%（C23）的烯烃选择性，同时CO2排放极低（0.5%）。

5. 边缘羟基化的硼氮化物催化剂将表观活化能降低到175.3 kJ mol1，表明该催化剂上存在较低能量通道。

6. 开发了一种硼氮化物涂层的多孔催化剂，用于改善氧化脱氢反应中的烯烃选择性和热质量和传质。这是工业化的关键，因为氧化脱氢反应的高放热量可能导致热点产生，从而对烯烃选择性和安全性产生负面影响。

7. 烷烃消耗速率与h-BN的质量之间的依赖关系被报道为火山型，这可能是因为多种因素导致的，包括气体相自由基化学的贡献、催化剂的形成和封装以及其他问题，这些问题需要进一步澄清。
