1. In the initial phase of the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, boron nitride and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) showed low activity until an activation period. This implies that the intact boron nitrides were inactive under the reaction conditions, and their high activity was due to in situ surface functionalization. Tailoring the functional groups of boron nitride can lead to optimized catalytic performance and better understanding of the active sites and catalytic origin.

2. Detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst revealed that functionalization at the edges created numerous accessible edges, which led to a substitution of nitrogen by oxygen during the process. The newly formed functional groups, specifically BOB and BOH groups, were considered responsible for the catalytic activity in the ODHP reaction.

3. The BOH groups were also observed in the study of ODHP on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of materials in their fresh and spent forms using advanced experimental techniques. The existence of these groups was linked to the high catalytic activity of the materials.

4. Recent research by Rossini and colleagues utilized a combination of 11B, 14N, and 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy and plane-wave DFT calculations to identify the presence of boron hydroxide/oxide termination on h-BN edges, suggesting these sites as active for ODHP.

5. At low reaction temperatures (400°C), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) demonstrated high selectivity to propylene (40-60%) at low propane conversion levels (<5%). However, a major limitation for carbon-based catalytic systems is the low productivity of olefins, typically below 1 golefin gcat1 h1, making industrial application challenging.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的初始阶段，硼氮化物和硼氮化纳米管（BNNT）表现出较低的活性，直到激活期。这表明，原始的硼氮化物在反应条件下是惰性的，其高活性是由于原位表面功能化导致的。调整硼氮化物的功能团可以实现优化的催化性能，并更好地理解活性位点和催化起源。

2. 对BNOH催化剂的详细结构分析揭示了在边缘处的功能化产生了大量的可访问边缘，导致了氮向氧的逐渐取代过程。新形成的功能团，特别是BOB和BOH团，被认为是ODHP反应中催化活性的原因。

3. 在对h-BN和BNNT进行ODHP研究时，通过使用先进的实验技术对材料在新鲜和耗尽状态下的表征，观察到了BOH团的存在。这些团的存在与材料的高催化活性有关联。

4. 最近，Rossini及其同事利用结合11B、14N和15N固体状态NMR光谱学和平面波DFT计算的方法，识别了h-BN边缘上的硼羟基/氧化终止的存在，这表明这些位置对于ODHP具有活性。

5. 在低温（400°C）下，碳纳米管（CNTs）和碳纳米纤维（CNFs）在低丙烷转化率（<5%）下显示出对丙烯（40-60%）的高选择性。然而，碳基催化系统的一个主要限制是烯烃产率低，通常低于1 golefin gcat1 h1，这使得工业应用具有挑战性。
