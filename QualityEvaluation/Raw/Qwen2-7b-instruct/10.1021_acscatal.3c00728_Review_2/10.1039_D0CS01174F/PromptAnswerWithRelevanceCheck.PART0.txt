[1] "In the survey of h-BN and BNNT catalytic systems, Lu et al. noticed81 a low initial activity (<3%) in ODH of propane prior to reaching their stable performance, which implicated an activation period."
[2] "This suggested that the intact boron nitrides were inert to the reactants under the ODH reaction conditions, and the high catalytic activity of boron nitrides was the consequence of their in situ surface functionalization."
[3] "Thus, tailoring functional groups of boron nitride would be beneficial for optimal catalytic performance, and help to understand the nature of the active sites and catalytic origin."
[4] "In a detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst,39 aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified a large number of accessible edges generated after functionalization at the edges (Fig. 10a)."
[5] "This result suggested that a gradual substitution of nitrogen by oxygen occurred during the functionalization of pristine boron nitride."
[6] "Considering the inert nature of pure h-BN, the nascent functional groups (BOB and BOH groups) formed at the edge of BNOH were considered to be responsible for its catalytic activity in the ODH reaction."
[7] "The presence of BOH groups was also reported38 in the study of ODH of propane on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of the materials in their fresh and spent forms by means of advance experimental techniques."
[8] "Recently, Rossini and co-workers201 identified the existence of boron hydroxide/oxide termination on h-BN edges by means of combined 11B, 14N and 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy and plane-wave DFT calculations."
[9] "In the ODH of light alkanes, at low reaction temperature (400 C) highly crystalline CNTs and CNFs exhibited relatively high selectivity to propylene (4060%) at low propane conversion level (<5%)."
[10] "However, one deficiency that impedes the application of carbon-based catalytic systems is the low productivity of olefins which is always below 1 golefin gcat1 h1, making it hardly profitable for industrialization."

1. In the initial phase of the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, boron nitride and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) showed low activity until an activation period. This implies that the intact boron nitrides were inactive under the reaction conditions, and their high activity was due to in situ surface functionalization. Tailoring the functional groups of boron nitride can lead to optimized catalytic performance and better understanding of the active sites and catalytic origin.

2. Detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst revealed that functionalization at the edges created numerous accessible edges, which led to a substitution of nitrogen by oxygen during the process. The newly formed functional groups, specifically BOB and BOH groups, were considered responsible for the catalytic activity in the ODHP reaction.

3. The BOH groups were also observed in the study of ODHP on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of materials in their fresh and spent forms using advanced experimental techniques. The existence of these groups was linked to the high catalytic activity of the materials.

4. Recent research by Rossini and colleagues utilized a combination of 11B, 14N, and 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy and plane-wave DFT calculations to identify the presence of boron hydroxide/oxide termination on h-BN edges, suggesting these sites as active for ODHP.

5. At low reaction temperatures (400°C), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) demonstrated high selectivity to propylene (40-60%) at low propane conversion levels (<5%). However, a major limitation for carbon-based catalytic systems is the low productivity of olefins, typically below 1 golefin gcat1 h1, making industrial application challenging.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的初始阶段，硼氮化物和硼氮化纳米管（BNNT）表现出较低的活性，直到激活期。这表明，原始的硼氮化物在反应条件下是惰性的，其高活性是由于原位表面功能化导致的。调整硼氮化物的功能团可以实现优化的催化性能，并更好地理解活性位点和催化起源。

2. 对BNOH催化剂的详细结构分析揭示了在边缘处的功能化产生了大量的可访问边缘，导致了氮向氧的逐渐取代过程。新形成的功能团，特别是BOB和BOH团，被认为是ODHP反应中催化活性的原因。

3. 在对h-BN和BNNT进行ODHP研究时，通过使用先进的实验技术对材料在新鲜和耗尽状态下的表征，观察到了BOH团的存在。这些团的存在与材料的高催化活性有关联。

4. 最近，Rossini及其同事利用结合11B、14N和15N固体状态NMR光谱学和平面波DFT计算的方法，识别了h-BN边缘上的硼羟基/氧化终止的存在，这表明这些位置对于ODHP具有活性。

5. 在低温（400°C）下，碳纳米管（CNTs）和碳纳米纤维（CNFs）在低丙烷转化率（<5%）下显示出对丙烯（40-60%）的高选择性。然而，碳基催化系统的一个主要限制是烯烃产率低，通常低于1 golefin gcat1 h1，这使得工业应用具有挑战性。

How are 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, what specific advantages do they offer over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance, and why have these unique structural features attracted significant research interest in the field?

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction involves creating a spherical superstructure. This unique morphology allows for a significant improvement in ethylene selectivity, reaching up to 92% at 10% ethane conversion. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed sites offer higher active site density, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. The spherical structure also lowers the apparent activation energy to 175.3 kJ mol−1, suggesting a preference for lower energy reaction pathways. These features have attracted significant research interest because they enable more efficient and selective dehydrogenation of propane, offering a promising alternative to traditional catalytic processes.

The specific advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites include:

1. **Increased Active Site Density**: The spherical superstructure exposes a larger number of active sites per unit area compared to linearly dispersed sites, enhancing the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

2. **Lower Activation Energy**: The unique geometry of the spherical superstructure reduces the activation energy required for the dehydrogenation reaction, promoting the formation of desired olefin products.

3. **Enhanced Selectivity**: By lowering the energy barrier for the desired reaction pathways, the spherical catalysts can favorably select for olefin formation, reducing the formation of unwanted byproducts.

4. **Optimized Surface Area**: The spherical morphology optimizes the surface area-to-volume ratio, which is crucial for maximizing the number of active sites available for reaction, thereby improving catalytic performance.

These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest due to their potential to revolutionize the ODHP process, offering a more efficient, selective, and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods. The ability to tailor the catalyst's morphology to enhance specific catalytic properties represents a promising avenue for the development of sustainable and industrially viable dehydrogenation technologies.

2.4.1 Nature of the active sites
Identification of the active sites of boron-based catalysts is crucial to understand the catalytic origin, and to guide the design and evaluation of new boron-based catalysts. In the survey of h-BN and BNNT catalytic systems, Lu et al. noticed81 a low initial activity (<3%) in ODH of propane prior to reaching their stable performance, which implicated an activation period. This suggested that the intact boron nitrides were inert to the reactants under the ODH reaction conditions, and the high catalytic activity of boron nitrides was the consequence of their in situ surface functionalization. Thus, tailoring functional groups of boron nitride would be beneficial for optimal catalytic performance, and help to understand the nature of the active sites and catalytic origin.
In a detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst,39 aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified a large number of accessible edges generated after functionalization at the edges (Fig. 10a), and showed that lattice relaxations and distortions occurred exclusively at the edge of the layer. Boron K-edge electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM mode showed that the B/N ratio at the edge (1.28, point 2 in Fig. 10b) was higher than that of the in-plane (0.95, point 4 in Fig. 10b). This result suggested that a gradual substitution of nitrogen by oxygen occurred during the functionalization of pristine boron nitride. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and 2D 11B multiple quantum (MQ) magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectrum identified that there were two types of BO groups on the catalyst surface: the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms and the BOH sites (Fig. 10c and d).

2.4.2 Reaction mechanisms
Characterization of the kinetics of the ODH reactions via advanced experimental techniques provided abundant information to understand the underlying mechanism. The combination of in situ FTIR and online MS showed39 that the signals of OH groups of the BNOH catalyst remained unchanged in the absence of O2 in the feed gas, but diminished in the presence of O2, implicating that the co-presence of alkane and O2 is a prerequisite in the ODH of light alkanes catalyzed by boron-based catalysts. The diminished signals of an OH group could be recovered under a steam atmosphere (Fig. 12a), which, together with the isotope labelling experiment, showed the direct involvement of water in the replenish of the BOH groups. These spectroscopic data and kinetic experiments indicated that the hydrogen and oxygen atoms of OH(D) groups were involved in the reaction process (Fig. 12b and c), which also lent support to a later computational study of the mechanism that considered the breakage of the BO(H) bond during the reaction.204 The kinetic analysis suggested that the reaction order of O2 was 0.5, implicating the dissociation of O2 in the ODH reaction. The reaction order of C3H8 was calculated to be 2, and the kinetic isotope effects of CH cleavage were measured to be 1.4 for primary hydrogen abstraction and 1.5 for secondary hydrogen abstraction. The results suggested that activation of propane determined the total reaction rate, based on which a reaction mechanism was proposed78,81 (Fig. 12d) initiated by the reaction of BOH groups with O2 to generate active species that may further dehydrogenate propane to produce propylene and water, and recover BOH groups.

The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts, specifically in boron nitride (BN), offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed sites allow for a higher density of active sites, enhancing catalytic performance. These sites are more reactive due to their specific arrangement and surface chemistry, which facilitates the activation of reactants and the formation of active intermediates. The high density of active sites leads to increased efficiency in the reaction process, allowing for faster and more complete conversions of reactants into products.

These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest because they enable the development of highly active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The ability to tailor the functional groups of boron nitride helps in optimizing catalytic performance and understanding the nature of the active sites. By controlling the surface chemistry, researchers can enhance the catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity of the catalysts, making them promising candidates for industrial applications.

In contrast to linearly dispersed edge sites, which might have fewer opportunities for reactant access and less efficient activation, the 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts provide a larger surface area for reaction, leading to improved performance. The detailed analysis of the active sites, such as the identification of BO and BOH groups, further elucidates the mechanism of action and helps in designing more effective catalysts.

The research interest in these unique structural features is driven by the potential to overcome challenges associated with traditional catalysts, such as over-oxidation of olefins and the need for high selectivity in producing valuable carbon-based products. By leveraging the enhanced activity and selectivity provided by 2-D dispersed active sites, boron-based catalysts offer a promising avenue for industrialization of the ODHP process, minimizing CO2 emissions and achieving high productivity for light olefins.
