[1] "The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst49 offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues."
[2] "This h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst was fabricated by chemical vapor deposition using boric acid and urea as precursors, and exhibited 82.1% propylene selectivity with only 3.7% CO and no detected CO2 at 16.8% propane conversion in the ODH of propane with high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV, 576000 mL gBN1 h1) (Fig. 4a)."
[3] "The presence of hotspots in the catalyst bed is a typical phenomenon in the ODH of light alkanes owing to its highly exothermic nature, which can significantly accelerate the undesired over-oxidation of olefins, leading to a low selectivity to olefins."

The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through the creation of ordered microporous morphology in bulk BPO4 or by loading it onto a support. These unique structural features offer specific advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of higher active site density and improved catalytic performance. The microporous structure increases the surface area, which enhances the exposure of active sites and facilitates better mass transfer, thus optimizing the reaction conditions. This has attracted significant research interest due to the potential for enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the ODHP reaction.
