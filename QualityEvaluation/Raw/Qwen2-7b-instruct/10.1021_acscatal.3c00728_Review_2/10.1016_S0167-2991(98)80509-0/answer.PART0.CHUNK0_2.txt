1. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional structure where the active sites are distributed across the surface rather than being linearly dispersed along edges. This approach increases the active site density, potentially enhancing the catalytic performance due to a higher surface area available for reactions.
2. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed active sites offer several advantages. They increase the effective surface area per unit volume, which can lead to more efficient use of the catalyst. Additionally, this dispersion pattern may improve the accessibility of reactants to the active sites, further boosting the reaction rate and efficiency.
3. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites have attracted significant research interest because they promise to significantly enhance the performance of boron-based catalysts in the ODHP reaction. By optimizing the arrangement and density of active sites, researchers aim to develop more efficient and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, which could have substantial implications for the petrochemical industry and renewable energy applications.

1. 在硼基催化剂中开发氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）反应的二维分散活性位点涉及在表面形成二维结构，其中活性位点分布在表面而非沿着边缘线性排列。这种方法增加了活性位点密度，可能通过提供更多的反应表面来增强催化性能。
2. 相比于线性分散的边缘位点，二维分散的活性位点提供了几个优势。它们以单位体积增加有效表面面积，这可能导致催化剂更高效的使用。此外，这种分布模式可能改善了反应物到达活性位点的可及性，进一步提高反应速率和效率。
3. 由于可以显著增强硼基催化剂在ODHP反应中的性能，二维分散活性位点的独特结构特征吸引了大量的研究兴趣。通过优化活性位点的排列和密度，研究人员旨在开发更高效、选择性更强的催化剂用于丙烷脱氢，这将对石油化工行业和可再生能源应用产生重大影响。
