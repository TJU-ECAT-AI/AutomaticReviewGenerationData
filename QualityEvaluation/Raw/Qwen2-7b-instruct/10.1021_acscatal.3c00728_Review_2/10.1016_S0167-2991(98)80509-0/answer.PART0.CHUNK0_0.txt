The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through the creation of a highly ordered two-dimensional structure with active sites spread out across the surface. These sites provide several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including increased active site density which enhances catalytic performance through more direct contact with reactants. Additionally, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential to enable better control over reaction pathways, leading to improved selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process.
