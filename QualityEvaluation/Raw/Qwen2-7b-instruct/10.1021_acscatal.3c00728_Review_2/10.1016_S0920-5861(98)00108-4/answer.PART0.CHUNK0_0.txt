3.3. B2O3-containing catalysts
As reported earlier [20], the dissociative adsorption of both oxygen and propane is suppressed on B2O3 (30 wt%)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst as confirmed by HD and oxygen isotopic exchange reactions. Also no reaction of propane with lattice oxygen was detected by pulsing C3H8 over boriaalumina catalyst in the TAP reactor in the temperature range from 783 to 853 K. Therefore, propane activation via redox mechanism or by adsorbed oxygen can be excluded on this type of catalyst. A propyl radical is assumed to be the reactive intermediate; olefines and oxygenates are formed with high selectivities by secondary reactions of propyl radicals after their release into the gas phase due to diminished surface oxidation [20].

The type of acidity plays a decisive role in the propane activation on B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. It is assumed that the catalyst possesses a Lewis acidity which determines the activation of propane. The mechanism of the oxidative conversion of propane which takes place on boria-containing catalysts differs from those on V- or REO-based catalysts. In this case, acidity seems to play a decisive role in the propane activation. The initiation involves the formation of an alkyl radical which reacts with oxygen forming a peroxy radical. The reaction between the peroxy radical and alkane (CnH2n+1O2+CnH2n+2CnH2n+1O2H+CnH2n+1) is proposed to be the main propagation step.

在B2O3/Al2O3催化剂上，酸性起着决定性的作用。假设该催化剂具有Lewis酸性，从而决定了丙烷的活化。丙烷氧化的机制与V-或REO基催化剂不同，在这种情况下，酸性在丙烷激活中起着决定性的作用。反应的启动涉及形成一个烷基自由基，它与氧气反应形成过氧自由基。过氧自由基与烷烃（CnH2n+1O2+CnH2n+2CnH2n+1O2H+CnH2n+1）之间的反应被认为是主要的传播步骤。
