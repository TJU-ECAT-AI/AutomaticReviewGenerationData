[1] "As reported earlier [20], the dissociative adsorption of both oxygen and propane is suppressed on B2O3 (30 wt%)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst as confirmed by HD and oxygen isotopic exchange reactions."
[2] "Also no reaction of propane with lattice oxygen was detected by pulsing C3H8 over boriaalumina catalyst in the TAP reactor in the temperature range from 783 to 853 K."
[3] "Therefore, propane activation via redox mechanism or by adsorbed oxygen can be excluded on this type of catalyst."
[4] "A propyl radical is assumed to be the reactive intermediate; olefines and oxygenates are formed with high selectivities by secondary reactions of propyl radicals after their release into the gas phase due to diminished surface oxidation [20]."
