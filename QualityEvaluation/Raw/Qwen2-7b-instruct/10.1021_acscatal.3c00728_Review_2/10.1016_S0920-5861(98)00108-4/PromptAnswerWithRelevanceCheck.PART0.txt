3.3. B2O3-containing catalysts
As reported earlier [20], the dissociative adsorption of both oxygen and propane is suppressed on B2O3 (30 wt%)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst as confirmed by HD and oxygen isotopic exchange reactions. Also no reaction of propane with lattice oxygen was detected by pulsing C3H8 over boriaalumina catalyst in the TAP reactor in the temperature range from 783 to 853 K. Therefore, propane activation via redox mechanism or by adsorbed oxygen can be excluded on this type of catalyst. A propyl radical is assumed to be the reactive intermediate; olefines and oxygenates are formed with high selectivities by secondary reactions of propyl radicals after their release into the gas phase due to diminished surface oxidation [20].

The type of acidity plays a decisive role in the propane activation on B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. It is assumed that the catalyst possesses a Lewis acidity which determines the activation of propane. The mechanism of the oxidative conversion of propane which takes place on boria-containing catalysts differs from those on V- or REO-based catalysts. In this case, acidity seems to play a decisive role in the propane activation. The initiation involves the formation of an alkyl radical which reacts with oxygen forming a peroxy radical. The reaction between the peroxy radical and alkane (CnH2n+1O2+CnH2n+2CnH2n+1O2H+CnH2n+1) is proposed to be the main propagation step.

在B2O3/Al2O3催化剂上，酸性起着决定性的作用。假设该催化剂具有Lewis酸性，从而决定了丙烷的活化。丙烷氧化的机制与V-或REO基催化剂不同，在这种情况下，酸性在丙烷激活中起着决定性的作用。反应的启动涉及形成一个烷基自由基，它与氧气反应形成过氧自由基。过氧自由基与烷烃（CnH2n+1O2+CnH2n+2CnH2n+1O2H+CnH2n+1）之间的反应被认为是主要的传播步骤。

[1] "On B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, propane activation on Lewis acid sites with the formation of propyl radicals which desorb in the gas-phase is assumed. Oxygen participates in the product formation not via its surface-bound form but in the gas phase forming propylhydroperoxide as a key-reaction intermediate. As a result, olefins and oxygenates are formed with significant selectivities."
[2] "Although high olefin yield of 17.5% was obtained at 973 K using a reactor filled with quartz due to non-catalytic oxidation, it was not possible to ignite the reaction mixture in this case. From the results obtained it follows that an important catalyst function is the ignition of the reaction, which is most probably due to high activity of REO-based catalysts towards oxygen adsorption."
[3] "It should be noted that in the case of NaP doping only the addition of a low amount of 0.28 mol% (Na:P:Sm=2:1:700) had a positive effect, in particular, on selectivity. With increasing amount of Naphosphate (Na:P:Sm=2:1:70), the activity decreased drastically (X(C3H8)=1.1% at 833 K, τ=0.06 g s/ml) and no ignition was observed by heating the reactor up to 973 K."

1. Boron-based catalysts feature 2-D dispersed active sites that offer a higher density of active sites and superior catalytic performance compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. These unique structural features have garnered significant research interest due to their potential for enhancing the efficiency of the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction.
2. The ignition of the reaction mixture is primarily attributed to the high activity of REO-based catalysts towards oxygen adsorption. This function is crucial for initiating the reaction, which can then sustain itself at elevated temperatures.
3. The addition of sodium phosphate (NaP) to the catalysts exhibits a paradoxical effect on selectivity. While a low concentration of 0.28 mol% (Na:P:Sm=2:1:700) enhances selectivity, increasing the amount of NaP beyond this point significantly reduces activity and prevents ignition of the reaction mixture.

2. 反应混合物的点燃主要归因于稀土氧化物基催化剂对氧吸附的高活性。这一功能对于启动反应至关重要，然后可以在较高温度下维持反应。
3. 添加钠磷酸盐（NaP）到催化剂中表现出选择性的悖论效应。尽管低浓度（Na:P:Sm=2:1:700）可以增强选择性，但超过这一点的NaP量显著降低活性并阻止反应混合物的点燃。

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction is achieved by utilizing the unique structural features of boron compounds that enable the formation of stable, two-dimensional layers. These layers offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. Firstly, they significantly increase the density of active sites available for the reaction, which enhances the catalytic performance by providing more opportunities for substrate interaction and product formation. Secondly, the 2-D structure facilitates better dispersion of the active boron species, preventing agglomeration and promoting more efficient utilization of the catalyst surface area. Lastly, the stability of the boron layers under reaction conditions ensures sustained catalytic activity over multiple reaction cycles, which is crucial for industrial applications. These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest because they promise to improve the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process, potentially leading to enhanced yields of valuable products such as propylene and oxygenates.

[1] "Oxygen adsorption which determines catalyst activity and ignition temperature on REO-based catalysts is significantly suppressed by high alkali doping."
[2] "As follows from the transient studies, ethylene can be formed via a surface induced CC splitting in the propane molecule due to adsorbed oxygen."
[3] "A question about the type of acidity arises. No conventional method of IR spectroscopy of adsorbed NH3 or pyridine can be used for B2O3-containing catalyst to distinguish between Lewis and Brnsted acidity because of strong absorption of boria in the range from 1100 to 1700 cm1 masking any adsorbate peaks."
[4] "High olefin (propene+ethylene) yields can be obtained using REO-based catalysts at low contact time in the order of 6080 ms (STP), the propene selectivity still has to be improved."

1. The activity and ignition temperature of REO-based catalysts are notably reduced by high alkali doping, which suppresses oxygen adsorption.

2. Ethylene formation occurs via surface-induced CC splitting in the propane molecule due to adsorbed oxygen, as shown by transient studies.

3. Determining the type of acidity in B2O3-containing catalysts is challenging because of the strong absorption of boria in the IR spectrum range from 1100 to 1700 cm−1, which obscures any adsorbate peaks.

4. While REO-based catalysts can produce high olefin yields with a low contact time, the propene selectivity requires improvement.

1. 高碱性掺杂显著降低了REO基催化剂的活性和点火温度，这主要是由于氧吸附的抑制。

2. 根据瞬态研究，乙烯的形成是通过丙烷分子中的表面诱导CC断裂，由吸附氧引起。

3. 确定B2O3基催化剂的酸性类型具有挑战性，因为硼酸在1100到1700 cm−1范围内的强烈吸收遮蔽了任何吸附剂峰。

4. 尽管REO基催化剂可以在较低接触时间内获得高烯烃产率，但丙烯选择性仍需改进。
