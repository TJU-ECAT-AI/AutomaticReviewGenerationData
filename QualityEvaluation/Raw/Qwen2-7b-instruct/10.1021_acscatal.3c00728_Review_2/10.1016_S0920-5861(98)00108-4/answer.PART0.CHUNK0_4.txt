[1] "Oxygen adsorption which determines catalyst activity and ignition temperature on REO-based catalysts is significantly suppressed by high alkali doping."
[2] "As follows from the transient studies, ethylene can be formed via a surface induced CC splitting in the propane molecule due to adsorbed oxygen."
[3] "A question about the type of acidity arises. No conventional method of IR spectroscopy of adsorbed NH3 or pyridine can be used for B2O3-containing catalyst to distinguish between Lewis and Brnsted acidity because of strong absorption of boria in the range from 1100 to 1700 cm1 masking any adsorbate peaks."
[4] "High olefin (propene+ethylene) yields can be obtained using REO-based catalysts at low contact time in the order of 6080 ms (STP), the propene selectivity still has to be improved."

1. The activity and ignition temperature of REO-based catalysts are notably reduced by high alkali doping, which suppresses oxygen adsorption.

2. Ethylene formation occurs via surface-induced CC splitting in the propane molecule due to adsorbed oxygen, as shown by transient studies.

3. Determining the type of acidity in B2O3-containing catalysts is challenging because of the strong absorption of boria in the IR spectrum range from 1100 to 1700 cm−1, which obscures any adsorbate peaks.

4. While REO-based catalysts can produce high olefin yields with a low contact time, the propene selectivity requires improvement.

1. 高碱性掺杂显著降低了REO基催化剂的活性和点火温度，这主要是由于氧吸附的抑制。

2. 根据瞬态研究，乙烯的形成是通过丙烷分子中的表面诱导CC断裂，由吸附氧引起。

3. 确定B2O3基催化剂的酸性类型具有挑战性，因为硼酸在1100到1700 cm−1范围内的强烈吸收遮蔽了任何吸附剂峰。

4. 尽管REO基催化剂可以在较低接触时间内获得高烯烃产率，但丙烯选择性仍需改进。
