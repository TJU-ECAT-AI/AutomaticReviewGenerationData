[1] "On B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, propane activation on Lewis acid sites with the formation of propyl radicals which desorb in the gas-phase is assumed. Oxygen participates in the product formation not via its surface-bound form but in the gas phase forming propylhydroperoxide as a key-reaction intermediate. As a result, olefins and oxygenates are formed with significant selectivities."
[2] "Although high olefin yield of 17.5% was obtained at 973 K using a reactor filled with quartz due to non-catalytic oxidation, it was not possible to ignite the reaction mixture in this case. From the results obtained it follows that an important catalyst function is the ignition of the reaction, which is most probably due to high activity of REO-based catalysts towards oxygen adsorption."
[3] "It should be noted that in the case of NaP doping only the addition of a low amount of 0.28 mol% (Na:P:Sm=2:1:700) had a positive effect, in particular, on selectivity. With increasing amount of Naphosphate (Na:P:Sm=2:1:70), the activity decreased drastically (X(C3H8)=1.1% at 833 K, τ=0.06 g s/ml) and no ignition was observed by heating the reactor up to 973 K."

1. Boron-based catalysts feature 2-D dispersed active sites that offer a higher density of active sites and superior catalytic performance compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. These unique structural features have garnered significant research interest due to their potential for enhancing the efficiency of the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction.
2. The ignition of the reaction mixture is primarily attributed to the high activity of REO-based catalysts towards oxygen adsorption. This function is crucial for initiating the reaction, which can then sustain itself at elevated temperatures.
3. The addition of sodium phosphate (NaP) to the catalysts exhibits a paradoxical effect on selectivity. While a low concentration of 0.28 mol% (Na:P:Sm=2:1:700) enhances selectivity, increasing the amount of NaP beyond this point significantly reduces activity and prevents ignition of the reaction mixture.

1. 硼基催化剂的二维分散活性位点提供了比线性分散边缘位点更高的活性位点密度和催化性能。这些独特的结构特征因其对提高丙烷氧化脱氢反应效率的潜力而受到研究界的高度关注。
2. 反应混合物的点燃主要归因于稀土氧化物基催化剂对氧吸附的高活性。这一功能对于启动反应至关重要，然后可以在较高温度下维持反应。
3. 添加钠磷酸盐（NaP）到催化剂中表现出选择性的悖论效应。尽管低浓度（Na:P:Sm=2:1:700）可以增强选择性，但超过这一点的NaP量显著降低活性并阻止反应混合物的点燃。
