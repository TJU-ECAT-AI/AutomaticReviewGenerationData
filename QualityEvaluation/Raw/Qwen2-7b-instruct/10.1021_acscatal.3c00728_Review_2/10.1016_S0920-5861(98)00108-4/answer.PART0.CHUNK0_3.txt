The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction is achieved by utilizing the unique structural features of boron compounds that enable the formation of stable, two-dimensional layers. These layers offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. Firstly, they significantly increase the density of active sites available for the reaction, which enhances the catalytic performance by providing more opportunities for substrate interaction and product formation. Secondly, the 2-D structure facilitates better dispersion of the active boron species, preventing agglomeration and promoting more efficient utilization of the catalyst surface area. Lastly, the stability of the boron layers under reaction conditions ensures sustained catalytic activity over multiple reaction cycles, which is crucial for industrial applications. These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest because they promise to improve the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process, potentially leading to enhanced yields of valuable products such as propylene and oxygenates.
