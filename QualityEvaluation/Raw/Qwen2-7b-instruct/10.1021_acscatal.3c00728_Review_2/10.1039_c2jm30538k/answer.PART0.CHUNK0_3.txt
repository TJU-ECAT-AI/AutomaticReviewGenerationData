[1] "Nano-boron carbide supported platinum catalysts with much enhanced methanol oxidation activity and CO tolerance Platinum (Pt) nanoparticles were successfully deposited on the surface of nano-B4C with fragmentary nanostructured carbon thin film through a polyol process in an ethylene glycol solution."
[2] "The electrochemical surface area of the Pt/B4C was investigated and showed remarkable enhancement compared with conventional Pt/C catalysts, which could be attributed to fast hydroxyl adsorption and high OHad coverage occurring during the hydrogen desorption process."
[3] "It was also found that the novel Pt/B4C catalysts presented much enhanced methanol oxidation activity and CO tolerance by a negative shift in the onset potential and an increase of the peak current density in comparison to Pt/C catalysts."
[4] "Meanwhile, the Pt/B4C showed an improved oxygen reduction reaction activity compared to the Pt/C catalyst."

The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are developed through the deposition of platinum nanoparticles on the surface of nano-boron carbide (B4C) with fragmentary sections of amorphous carbon thin film. This unique structural feature offers several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. Firstly, the increased density of 2-D dispersed active sites leads to a higher catalytic performance. Secondly, these sites provide better access for reactants and products, enhancing the reaction efficiency. Lastly, the synergistic effect between the boron carbide support and the platinum nanoparticles results in improved CO tolerance and methanol oxidation activity. These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest due to their potential in enhancing the overall catalytic activity and stability in various industrial processes, including the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).
