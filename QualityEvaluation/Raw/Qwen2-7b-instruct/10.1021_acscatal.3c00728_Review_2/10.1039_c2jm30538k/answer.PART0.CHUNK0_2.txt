The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through the deposition of platinum nanoparticles on the surface of nano-boron carbide (nano-B4C) with fragmentary nanostructured carbon thin films. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including higher active site density and enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential to significantly improve the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP reaction.

These active sites provide a higher surface area for reactions to occur, leading to increased catalytic activity. The presence of the fragmentary nanostructured carbon thin film enhances the electronic conduction of the B4C support, making it more electrochemically suitable for the catalyst. This improvement in conductivity facilitates faster electron transfer and thus accelerates the catalytic reactions. Additionally, the fast hydroxyl adsorption and high OHad coverage on the Pt nanoparticles contribute to the enhanced activity and selectivity of the boron-based catalysts, particularly in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The improved catalytic performance of these boron-based catalysts, including higher methanol oxidation activity, CO tolerance, and oxygen reduction reaction activity, compared to conventional Pt/C catalysts, highlights their potential for various industrial applications, such as direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). The enhanced catalytic properties and selectivity of these catalysts make them promising candidates for the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly industrial processes, particularly in the petrochemical industry where the ODHP reaction plays a crucial role in the production of olefins and aromatics.

2-D分散活性位点在硼基催化剂中通过在纳米硼化物（nano-B4C）表面沉积铂纳米颗粒并附带碎片状纳米结构碳薄膜来开发氧化丙烷脱氢反应（ODHP）。这些位点相对于线性分散边缘位点提供了几个优势，包括更高的活性位点密度和增强的催化性能。这些独特的结构特征引起了研究界的广泛关注，因为它们有可能显著提高ODHP反应的效率和选择性。

这些活性位点提供了更高的反应表面，导致增加的催化活性。碎片状纳米结构碳薄膜的存在提高了B4C支持的电子传导性，使其更适合作为催化剂。这改善的传导性促进了更快的电子传输，从而加速了催化反应。此外，Pt纳米颗粒上的快速羟基吸附和高OHad覆盖率有助于增强硼基催化剂的活性和选择性，特别是在氧化丙烷脱氢反应中。

这些硼基催化剂的增强催化性能，包括更高的甲醇氧化活性、CO耐受性和氧还原反应活性，与传统的Pt/C催化剂相比，显示出了其在各种工业应用中的潜力，尤其是直接甲醇燃料电池（DMFCs）。这些催化剂的增强催化性能和选择性使它们成为开发更高效和环境友好的工业过程的有前景的候选者，特别是ODHP反应在生产烯烃和芳香族化合物中扮演关键角色的石油化学工业中。
