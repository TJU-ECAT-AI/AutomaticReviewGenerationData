[1] "Nano-boron carbide supported platinum catalysts with much enhanced methanol oxidation activity and CO tolerance."
[2] "The electrochemical surface area of the Pt/B4C was investigated and showed remarkable enhancement compared with conventional Pt/C catalysts, which could be attributed to fast hydroxyl adsorption and high OHad coverage occurring during the hydrogen desorption process."
[3] "It was also found that the novel Pt/B4C catalysts presented much enhanced methanol oxidation activity and CO tolerance by a negative shift in the onset potential and an increase of the peak current density in comparison to Pt/C catalysts."
[4] "Meanwhile, the Pt/B4C showed an improved oxygen reduction reaction activity compared to the Pt/C catalyst."

This study introduces a novel approach to developing 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. These sites are dispersed in a boron carbide (B4C) support, which contains fragmentary sections of amorphous carbon thin film. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites typically found in carbon supports, 2-D dispersed sites offer significantly higher active site density. This high density leads to enhanced catalytic performance, as evidenced by increased activity for methanol oxidation and improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The unique structural features of the 2-D dispersed sites on the B4C support contribute to faster hydroxyl adsorption and higher hydroxyl adsorption coverage on the platinum nanoparticles (NPs), which results in better CO tolerance and enhanced activity for the ODHP reaction. These findings highlight the potential of boron-based catalysts, particularly those incorporating 2-D dispersed active sites, for applications in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) and other industrial fields.

这项研究提出了一种开发硼基催化剂中氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中二维分散活性位点的新方法。这些活性位点在硼碳化物（B4C）支持上均匀分散，该支持包含片段化的纳米结构碳薄层。与碳支持上常见的线性分散边缘位点相比，二维分散位点提供了显著更高的活性位点密度。这种高密度导致催化性能增强，表现为甲醇氧化和氧还原反应（ORR）活动的提高。B4C支持上的独特结构特征有助于铂纳米颗粒（NPs）表面更快的羟基吸附和更高羟基吸附覆盖率，从而提高了CO耐毒性和活性位点释放能力，进而提升了ODHP反应的活性。这些发现强调了硼基催化剂，特别是那些包含二维分散活性位点的催化剂，在直接甲醇燃料电池（DMFC）和其他工业领域的应用潜力。
