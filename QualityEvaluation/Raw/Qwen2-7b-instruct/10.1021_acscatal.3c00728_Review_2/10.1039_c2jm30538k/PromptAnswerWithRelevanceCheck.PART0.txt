The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through the deposition of platinum nanoparticles on the surface of nano-boron carbide (nano-B4C) with fragmentary nanostructured carbon thin films. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including higher active site density and enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential to significantly improve the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP reaction.

These active sites provide a higher surface area for reactions to occur, leading to increased catalytic activity. The presence of the fragmentary nanostructured carbon thin film enhances the electronic conduction of the B4C support, making it more electrochemically suitable for the catalyst. This improvement in conductivity facilitates faster electron transfer and thus accelerates the catalytic reactions. Additionally, the fast hydroxyl adsorption and high OHad coverage on the Pt nanoparticles contribute to the enhanced activity and selectivity of the boron-based catalysts, particularly in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The improved catalytic performance of these boron-based catalysts, including higher methanol oxidation activity, CO tolerance, and oxygen reduction reaction activity, compared to conventional Pt/C catalysts, highlights their potential for various industrial applications, such as direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). The enhanced catalytic properties and selectivity of these catalysts make them promising candidates for the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly industrial processes, particularly in the petrochemical industry where the ODHP reaction plays a crucial role in the production of olefins and aromatics.

This study introduces a novel approach to developing 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. These sites are dispersed in a boron carbide (B4C) support, which contains fragmentary sections of amorphous carbon thin film. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites typically found in carbon supports, 2-D dispersed sites offer significantly higher active site density. This high density leads to enhanced catalytic performance, as evidenced by increased activity for methanol oxidation and improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The unique structural features of the 2-D dispersed sites on the B4C support contribute to faster hydroxyl adsorption and higher hydroxyl adsorption coverage on the platinum nanoparticles (NPs), which results in better CO tolerance and enhanced activity for the ODHP reaction. These findings highlight the potential of boron-based catalysts, particularly those incorporating 2-D dispersed active sites, for applications in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) and other industrial fields.
