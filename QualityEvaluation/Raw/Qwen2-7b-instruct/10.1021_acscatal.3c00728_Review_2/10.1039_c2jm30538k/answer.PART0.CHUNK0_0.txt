[1] "Nano-boron carbide supported platinum catalysts with much enhanced methanol oxidation activity and CO tolerance"
[2] "Platinum (Pt) nanoparticles were successfully deposited on the surface of nano-B4C with fragmentary nanostructured carbon thin film through a polyol process in an ethylene glycol solution."
[3] "The electrochemical surface area of the Pt/B4C was investigated and showed remarkable enhancement compared with conventional Pt/C catalysts, which could be attributed to fast hydroxyl adsorption and high OHad coverage occurring during the hydrogen desorption process."
[4] "It was also found that the novel Pt/B4C catalysts presented much enhanced methanol oxidation activity and CO tolerance by a negative shift in the onset potential and an increase of the peak current density in comparison to Pt/C catalysts."
[5] "Meanwhile, the Pt/B4C showed an improved oxygen reduction reaction activity compared to the Pt/C catalyst."

This study describes the development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. These sites are developed by depositing platinum nanoparticles on the surface of boron carbide (B4C) with fragmentary sections of amorphous carbon thin film. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, the 2-D dispersed active sites offer a higher density of active sites, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. This unique structural feature attracts significant research interest due to its potential for improving the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP reaction.

这项研究描述了在硼基催化剂上开发氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中丙烷（Propane）的活性位点的方法。这些活性位点通过将铂纳米颗粒沉积在硼化碳（B4C）的表面，带有碎片状的纳米结构碳薄膜而形成。与线性分散的边缘位点相比，二维分散的活性位点提供了更高的活性位点密度，导致催化性能的增强。这种独特的结构特征吸引了大量的研究兴趣，因为它有可能提高ODHP反应的效率和选择性。
