[1] "Nano-boron carbide supported platinum catalysts with much enhanced methanol oxidation activity and CO tolerance"
[2] "The electrochemical surface area of the Pt/B4C was investigated and showed remarkable enhancement compared with conventional Pt/C catalysts, which could be attributed to fast hydroxyl adsorption and high OHad coverage occurring during the hydrogen desorption process."
[3] "Meanwhile, the Pt/B4C showed an improved oxygen reduction reaction activity compared to the Pt/C catalyst."
[4] "The presence of carbon thin film facilitates the electrical conduction of the support materials."
[5] "For the CO tolerance test, CO gas (99.99% purity) was bubbled for 30 min with the potential held at 0.1 V to allow the complete adsorption of CO onto the active catalytic sites."
[6] "This means that the absorbed CO is prone to oxidation on Pt/B4C at lower potential, which is helpful for releasing the active sites of Pt for the further oxidation of methanol in DMFCs."

Nano-boron carbide supported platinum catalysts are developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction through a polyol process. These catalysts feature 2-D dispersed active sites, which offer higher active site density and improved catalytic performance compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest due to their potential for enhancing reaction kinetics and selectivity in the ODHP process. These sites facilitate better interaction with reactants, leading to increased efficiency in the conversion of propane to olefins.
