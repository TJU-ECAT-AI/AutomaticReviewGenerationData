[1] "Samples of B2O3/ZrO2 were prepared by impregnation of the zirconia support with an aqueous solution of boric acid.10,11 The boria loading in the catalyst was determined by ICP-MS analysis, and is expressed as a weight percentage of the catalyst sample."
[2] "Although the loading of boria affects the catalyst activity and selectivity, deactivated catalysts can be regenerated, regardless of the boria loading, to their initial activity and selectivity by calcination at 600 C."
[3] "For the 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts prepared with CAT = 600 C, it has been shown that the precalcination temperature (PCT = 110500 C) of the support precursor has little effect on the catalytic efficiency for the lactam synthesis."

These quotes do not specifically address the development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, nor do they compare these sites to linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance. They do discuss the regeneration of deactivated catalysts and the influence of calcination temperature on the catalytic efficiency of boron-based catalysts for lactam synthesis. The quotes suggest that high temperature calcination is crucial for the preparation of highly efficient B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts and that the precalcination temperature of the support precursor has little effect on the catalytic efficiency for lactam synthesis when the catalyst is prepared with a high activation temperature. However, these details do not directly answer the question about 2-D dispersed active sites or their advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites in the context of the ODHP reaction.

这些引文并未具体讨论在丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中硼基催化剂中发展2-D分散活性位点的方法，也未将这些位点与线性分散边缘位点在活性位点密度和催化性能方面的优势进行比较。它们确实讨论了催化剂的再生以及高温煅烧对乳酸合成催化剂效率的影响。引文表明，高温煅烧对于高效制备B2O3/ZrO2催化剂至关重要，并且当催化剂以高温活化时，支持前体预煅烧温度对乳酸合成的催化效率几乎没有影响。然而，这些细节并未直接回答有关2-D分散活性位点及其在ODHP反应中的优势的问题。
