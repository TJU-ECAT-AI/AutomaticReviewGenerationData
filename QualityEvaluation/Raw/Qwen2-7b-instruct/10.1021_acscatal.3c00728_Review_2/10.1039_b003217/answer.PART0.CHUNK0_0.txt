[1] "The main obstacle to the practical use of these catalysts comes from the rapid deactivation and poor regeneration properties of these catalysts."
[2] "Although the loading of boria affects the catalyst activity and selectivity, deactivated catalysts can be regenerated, regardless of the boria loading, to their initial activity and selectivity by calcination at 600 C."
[3] "It is evident from Fig. 1 that these two catalysts do not lose any activity for the Beckmann reaction, even after two repeated deactivation-regeneration cycles."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a structure where boron is distributed in a two-dimensional manner across the surface of the catalyst. This configuration offers several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. Specifically, the increased surface area provided by 2-D dispersion allows for a higher density of active sites, which enhances the catalytic performance by increasing the number of reactive points available for the ODHP reaction. This results in a more efficient conversion of propane to olefins and hydrogen.

These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest due to their potential to improve the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process. The enhanced active site density facilitates faster reaction kinetics and better utilization of the catalyst, leading to higher yields of desired products. Moreover, the ability of these catalysts to maintain their activity and selectivity after multiple deactivation and regeneration cycles makes them particularly appealing for industrial applications, where continuous operation and minimal downtime are crucial.

The studies mentioned in the literature demonstrate that through high-temperature calcinations, boron-based catalysts can achieve highly efficient and regenerable properties, making them suitable candidates for industrial-scale ODHP processes. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the chemistry of the interaction between boron and the surface of the support material, which could lead to the development of practical boria catalysts with optimized performance characteristics for industrial use.

开发氧化脱氢反应中丙烷（ODHP）用硼基催化剂的二维分散活性位点涉及在催化剂表面以二维方式分布硼。这种配置相对于线性分散边缘位点提供了几个优势。具体而言，二维分散提供的更大表面积使得活性位点密度更高，这通过增加可用于ODHP反应的反应点的数量来增强催化性能，从而提高了丙烷转化为烯烃和氢气的效率。

这些独特的结构特征吸引了大量研究兴趣，因为它们有可能提高ODHP过程的效率和选择性。增加的活性位点密度加快了反应动力学，并更好地利用了催化剂，导致了更理想的产物产率。此外，这些催化剂能够在多次失活和再生周期后保持其活性和选择性，这使得它们对工业应用特别有吸引力，其中连续运行和最小的停机时间至关重要。

文献中提到的研究表明，通过高温煅烧，硼基催化剂可以达到高效且可再生的性质，使其成为适用于工业规模ODHP过程的理想候选物。这些发现强调了理解硼与支撑材料表面之间化学作用的重要性，这可能有助于开发具有优化性能特性的实用硼催化剂用于工业使用。
