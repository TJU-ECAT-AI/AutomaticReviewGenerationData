[1] "The low utilization and stability of noble-metal catalysts is always a big barrier to commercialize proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells."
[2] "Here we report a positive progress on stabilizing the catalyst by modulating 2D graphene as an advanced support of Pt nanoparticles, where the interlayer of graphene is near perfectly intercalated by nano-B4C ceramics."
[3] "As results, our new graphene/B4C supported Pt catalyst (Pt-RGO/B4C) shows greatly enhanced electrochemical surface area (121 m2 g−1) and mass activity (185 A g−1 Pt) towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is remarkably higher than the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) supported Pt (Pt/RGO) catalyst and the commercial Pt/C catalyst."
[4] "In addition, the Pt-RGO/B4C electrode also possesses higher fuel cell performance than the Pt/RGO electrode."
[5] "After the electrochemical acceleration test for 10000 cycles, our new catalyst presents an excellent stability, even retains 45.2% initial electrochemical surface area, while the Pt/RGO and Pt/C are only 29.7 and 23.4%, respectively."

1. Nano-size boron carbide intercalated graphene is developed as a high-performance catalyst support for PEM fuel cells, enhancing the utilization and stability of noble-metal catalysts.
2. This method involves intercalating nano-B4C ceramics into the graphene interlayers to create 2D dispersed active sites for the Pt nanoparticles, offering advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of higher active site density and improved catalytic performance due to the strong restriction effect of the ceramics on the graphene structure.
3. The unique structural features of boron-based catalysts, such as the 2D dispersed active sites created by the intercalation of nano-B4C into graphene, have attracted significant research interest because they lead to enhanced electrochemical surface area, mass activity, and fuel cell performance compared to conventional methods, and demonstrate excellent stability over extended use.
