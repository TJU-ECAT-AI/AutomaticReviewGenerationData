Nano-size boron carbide intercalated graphene is used as a support for Pt nanoparticles in PEM fuel cells. The strong restriction effect of nano-B4C ceramics in the graphene interlayers significantly enhances the usage and electrochemical stability of the Pt catalyst. The Pt-RGO/B4C catalyst shows improved electrochemical surface area and mass activity towards oxygen reduction reaction compared to other catalysts. Additionally, the Pt-RGO/B4C electrode demonstrates higher fuel cell performance. After extensive electrochemical testing, the Pt-RGO/B4C catalyst maintains excellent stability, retaining 45.2% of its initial electrochemical surface area, whereas the Pt/RGO and Pt/C catalysts retain only 29.7% and 23.4%, respectively.
