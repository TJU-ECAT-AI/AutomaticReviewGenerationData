[1] "Here we report a positive progress on stabilizing the catalyst by modulating 2D graphene as an advanced support of Pt nanoparticles, where the interlayer of graphene is near perfectly intercalated by nano-B4C ceramics."
[2] "The strong restriction effect of nano-ceramics in graphene interlayers, can greatly improves the usage and electrochemical stability of Pt catalysts."
[3] "Our new graphene/B4C supported Pt catalyst (Pt-RGO/B4C) shows greatly enhanced electrochemical surface area (121 m2 g−1) and mass activity (185 A g−1 Pt) towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is remarkably higher than the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) supported Pt (Pt/RGO) catalyst and the commercial Pt/C catalyst."
[4] "In addition, the Pt-RGO/B4C electrode also possesses higher fuel cell performance than the Pt/RGO electrode."
[5] "Especially, after the electrochemical acceleration test for 10000 cycles, our new catalyst presents an excellent stability, even retains 45.2% initial electrochemical surface area, while the Pt/RGO and Pt/C are only 29.7 and 23.4%, respectively."

1. The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are developed through modulation of 2D graphene as an advanced support for Pt nanoparticles, with the interlayer of graphene perfectly intercalated by nano-B4C ceramics. This unique structure significantly enhances the utilization and electrochemical stability of the Pt catalysts.

2. The advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites lie in their higher active site density and improved catalytic performance. The 2-D dispersion allows for more efficient interaction between reactants and active sites, leading to better conversion rates and yield.

3. The unique structural features of the boron-based catalysts, such as the 2-D dispersion of active sites within the graphene matrix, have attracted significant research interest due to their potential to increase catalytic efficiency and stability. These features enable enhanced activity and durability, particularly in applications requiring high-performance catalysts, such as in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.
