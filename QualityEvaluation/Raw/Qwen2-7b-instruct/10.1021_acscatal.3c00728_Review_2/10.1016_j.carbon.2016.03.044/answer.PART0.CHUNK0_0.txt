[1] "The low utilization and stability of noble-metal catalysts is always a big barrier to commercialize proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells."
[2] "Here we report a positive progress on stabilizing the catalyst by modulating 2D graphene as an advanced support of Pt nanoparticles, where the interlayer of graphene is near perfectly intercalated by nano-B4C ceramics."
[3] "As results, our new graphene/B4C supported Pt catalyst (Pt-RGO/B4C) shows greatly enhanced electrochemical surface area (121 m2 g−1) and mass activity (185 A g−1 Pt) towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is remarkably higher than the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) supported Pt (Pt/RGO) catalyst and the commercial Pt/C catalyst."
[4] "In addition, the Pt-RGO/B4C electrode also possesses higher fuel cell performance than the Pt/RGO electrode."
[5] "After the electrochemical acceleration test for 10000 cycles, our new catalyst presents an excellent stability, even retains 45.2% initial electrochemical surface area, while the Pt/RGO and Pt/C are only 29.7 and 23.4%, respectively."

1. In the context of developing 2D dispersed active sites for boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, the literature highlights the stabilization of the catalyst through modulation on 2D graphene as an advanced support for Pt nanoparticles. Specifically, the interlayer of graphene is intercalated by nano-B4C ceramics, creating a structure that significantly enhances the usage and electrochemical stability of the Pt catalyst.

2. The advantages offered by 2D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites primarily lie in their higher active site density and improved catalytic performance. The unique structural feature of 2D dispersion allows for a more efficient interaction with reactants and products, leading to increased efficiency in the ODHP reaction.

3. The research interest in 2D dispersed active sites stems from their ability to provide enhanced electrochemical properties such as increased electrochemical surface area and mass activity. This is particularly evident in the context of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), where the new graphene/B4C supported Pt catalyst (Pt-RGO/B4C) demonstrates significantly superior performance compared to other catalysts. Moreover, the stability maintained over thousands of electrochemical cycles further underscores the potential of these sites for practical applications in fuel cell technology.
