The low utilization and stability of noble-metal catalysts is always a big barrier to commercialize proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells.
Our new graphene/B4C supported Pt catalyst (Pt-RGO/B4C) shows greatly enhanced electrochemical surface area (121 m2 g1) and mass activity (185 A g1 Pt) towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is remarkably higher than the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) supported Pt (Pt/RGO) catalyst and the commercial Pt/C catalyst.
After the electrochemical acceleration test for 10000 cycles, our new catalyst presents an excellent stability, even retains 45.2% initial electrochemical surface area, while the Pt/RGO and Pt/C are only 29.7 and 23.4%, respectively.
