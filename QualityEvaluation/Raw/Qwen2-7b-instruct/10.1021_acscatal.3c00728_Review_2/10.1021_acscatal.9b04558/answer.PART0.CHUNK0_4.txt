Answer: The literature does not provide specific details on how 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. However, it mentions that these 2-D dispersed sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of higher active site density and improved catalytic performance. These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest due to their potential for enhancing the efficiency of the ODHP reaction.
