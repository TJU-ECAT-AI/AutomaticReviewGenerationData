1. 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through careful control of the catalyst synthesis process to ensure uniform dispersion of the active sites on a two-dimensional surface.
2. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed active sites provide a significantly higher density of active sites, which leads to enhanced catalytic activity and efficiency.
3. The high active site density and improved catalytic performance associated with 2-D dispersed sites are the primary reasons for their increased research interest in the field.
