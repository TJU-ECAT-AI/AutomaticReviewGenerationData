[1] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times."
[2] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors...In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of V oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading."

1. During steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), the reduction of vanadium is less extensive than in stoichiometric reduction from V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Only a portion of the reduced centers are actively involved in catalytic cycles, while the rest are re-oxidized on timescales longer than the turnover times.

2. The reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH varies with the support material. Silica-supported vanadium oxide catalysts tend to be more selective in propane ODH than alumina-supported ones, and alumina is more selective than titania, primarily due to the lesser parallel propane combustion, especially at lower vanadia loadings.

1. 在稳态氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中，钒的还原程度低于从V5+到V4+或V3+的完全还原。只有部分还原中心在催化循环中起作用，其余部分则在远长于周转时间的尺度上重新氧化。

2. 钒氧化物在烷烃ODH中的反应性随支持材料的变化而变化。在丙烷ODH中，硅酸盐支持的钒氧化物催化剂比氧化铝支持的更具有选择性，而氧化铝比二氧化钛更具选择性，主要原因是较低的并行丙烷燃烧，尤其是在较低的钒负载下。
