[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acid-base characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid. Some of these features may also be significant for bulk metal oxides, with the additional role played by structural defects, degree of crystallinity, etc."
[2] "In the case of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts, these unique structural features attract significant research interest due to their potential to enhance active site density and catalytic performance."
[3] "Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed active sites offer higher active site density, which is advantageous for the ODHP reaction. This is because the 2-D structure allows for a greater number of active sites per unit volume, potentially leading to increased reaction rates and efficiency."
[4] "These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest because they can potentially lead to improved selectivity and yield for the ODHP reaction, which is a critical factor in the commercial implementation of the process."
