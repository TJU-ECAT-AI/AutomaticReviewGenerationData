[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acid-base characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid. Some of these features may also be significant for bulk metal oxides, with the additional role played by structural defects, degree of crystallinity, etc."
[2] "In the case of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts, these unique structural features attract significant research interest due to their potential to enhance active site density and catalytic performance."
[3] "Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed active sites offer higher active site density, which is advantageous for the ODHP reaction. This is because the 2-D structure allows for a greater number of active sites per unit volume, potentially leading to increased reaction rates and efficiency."
[4] "These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest because they can potentially lead to improved selectivity and yield for the ODHP reaction, which is a critical factor in the commercial implementation of the process."

[1] "The case of propane ODH is different because the best yields reported are still far from being interesting for industrial implementation. Conditions leading to best propylene yields also lead to the co-production of significant amounts of ethylene; therefore, the finding of a catalyst capable of combining industrially acceptable conversion/productivity with specificity to this olefin is still the major objective."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The main challenge in propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is finding a catalyst that can produce propylene with acceptable conversion and productivity while maintaining high selectivity to propylene. Current catalysts lead to the co-production of ethylene, which complicates industrial implementation.

[1] "For instance, concurrent trends have been reported of the activity per active site and the number of anchoring bonds per site as a function of the surface density [76]."
[2] "An inverse trend was found between the steady-state catalytic TOF and the support electronegativity for methanol oxidation over supported vanadium oxide-based catalysts [57]."
[3] "The more electronegative supports lead to higher activity, because the higher the difference between the electronegativity of active metal cations or support cations with oxygen, the stronger the bond [58]."
[4] "In the case of propane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%. Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO) [167],[168],[174],[182],[270],[271]."
[5] "The best performance in propane ODH has been obtained with non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides [231],[285],[286]."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The activity per active site and the number of anchoring bonds per site as a function of the surface density have shown concurrent trends. The inverse relationship between the steady-state catalytic turnover frequency (TOF) and the support electronegativity for methanol oxidation over supported vanadium oxide-based catalysts has been reported. The higher activity is attributed to the stronger bond between the active metal cations or support cations with oxygen due to the higher difference in electronegativity. 

2. Catalysts based on NiO oxide, specifically NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O, and NiO-MgO, have given outstanding performance in propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), with ethylene yields exceeding 20%.

3. Non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides have demonstrated the best performance in propane ODH, offering higher olefin yields compared to other catalyst types.

1. 活性位点和每个活性位点的锚定键数量随表面密度的变化表现出协同趋势。在甲醇氧化过程中，负载型钒氧化物催化剂的稳态催化转率因子（TOF）与支撑体电负性的反比关系已被报道。较高的活性归因于活性金属离子或支撑体离子与氧之间的更强键，这与两者之间电负性的更高差异有关。

2. 基于NiO氧化物的催化剂，尤其是NiO-Al2O3、Ni/Nb/O和NiO-MgO，在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出卓越性能，乙炔产率超过20%。

3. 难还原的碱金属或碱土金属氧化物在丙烷ODH中表现出最佳性能，提供了与其他催化剂类型相比更高的烯烃产率。

[1] "In contrast with the above-mentioned findings, the results obtained by Lemonidou and co-workers [27] showed that in titania and zirconia-supported vanadium oxide, the ability of vanadium to activate the CH bond in propane weakens when increasing VOx density."
[2] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+ [22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[28] ,[46] ."
[3] "The formation of binary dispersed structures, for example, VOx-CrOx and VOx-MoOx mixed structures lead to a higher propane ODH rate and selectivity than VOx domains present at similar surface densities on pure Al2O3 supports [26] ,[77] ,[78] ,[79] ."
[4] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V, modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide [38] ,[59] ,[84] ,[85] ,[86] ,[87] ,[88] ,[89] ,[90] ,[91] ."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Lemonidou and co-workers' findings indicate that the ability of vanadium to activate the CH bond in propane diminishes with increasing density of vanadium oxide on titania and zirconia supports. 
2. The study reveals that the degree of reduction of vanadium during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is less compared to stoichiometric reduction of vanadium pentoxide to vanadium tetravalent or trivalent states. 
3. Mixed structures like VOx-CrOx and VOx-MoOx, when incorporated into alumina supports, result in a higher rate and selectivity of propane oxidative dehydrogenation compared to pure alumina supports with similar vanadium oxide density. 
4. Additives like phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), niobium (Nb), magnesium (Mg), gold (Au), zinc (Zn), and molybdenum (Mo), when added in proportion to vanadium, modify the acid-basic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide catalysts.

1. Lemonidou等人的研究结果表明，在二氧化钛和氧化锆支持的钒氧化物上，随着钒氧化物密度的增加，钒激活丙烷中的CH键的能力减弱。
2. 研究发现，在稳定态氧化脱氢过程中，钒的还原程度远低于五价钒氧化为四价或三价的完全还原。
3. 当将VOx-CrOx和VOx-MoOx等二元分散结构引入纯氧化铝支持材料中时，可以得到比相同表面密度下纯氧化铝上存在的VOx区域更高的丙烷氧化脱氢速率和选择性。  
4. 添加剂如磷（P）、钾（K）、钙（Ca）、镍（Ni）、铬（Cr）、铌（Nb）、镁（Mg）、金（Au）、锌（Zn）和钼（Mo），以与钒的比例添加，可以改变支持的钒氧化物催化剂的酸碱性和还原性。

[1] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times."
[2] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors...In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of V oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. During steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), the reduction of vanadium is less extensive than in stoichiometric reduction from V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Only a portion of the reduced centers are actively involved in catalytic cycles, while the rest are re-oxidized on timescales longer than the turnover times.

2. The reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH varies with the support material. Silica-supported vanadium oxide catalysts tend to be more selective in propane ODH than alumina-supported ones, and alumina is more selective than titania, primarily due to the lesser parallel propane combustion, especially at lower vanadia loadings.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 在稳态氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中，钒的还原程度低于从V5+到V4+或V3+的完全还原。只有部分还原中心在催化循环中起作用，其余部分则在远长于周转时间的尺度上重新氧化。

2. 钒氧化物在烷烃ODH中的反应性随支持材料的变化而变化。在丙烷ODH中，硅酸盐支持的钒氧化物催化剂比氧化铝支持的更具有选择性，而氧化铝比二氧化钛更具选择性，主要原因是较低的并行丙烷燃烧，尤其是在较低的钒负载下。
