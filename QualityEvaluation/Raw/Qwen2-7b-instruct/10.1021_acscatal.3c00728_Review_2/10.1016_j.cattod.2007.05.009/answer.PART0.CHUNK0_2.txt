1. The activity per active site and the number of anchoring bonds per site as a function of the surface density have shown concurrent trends. The inverse relationship between the steady-state catalytic turnover frequency (TOF) and the support electronegativity for methanol oxidation over supported vanadium oxide-based catalysts has been reported. The higher activity is attributed to the stronger bond between the active metal cations or support cations with oxygen due to the higher difference in electronegativity. 

2. Catalysts based on NiO oxide, specifically NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O, and NiO-MgO, have given outstanding performance in propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), with ethylene yields exceeding 20%.

3. Non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides have demonstrated the best performance in propane ODH, offering higher olefin yields compared to other catalyst types.

1. 活性位点和每个活性位点的锚定键数量随表面密度的变化表现出协同趋势。在甲醇氧化过程中，负载型钒氧化物催化剂的稳态催化转率因子（TOF）与支撑体电负性的反比关系已被报道。较高的活性归因于活性金属离子或支撑体离子与氧之间的更强键，这与两者之间电负性的更高差异有关。

2. 基于NiO氧化物的催化剂，尤其是NiO-Al2O3、Ni/Nb/O和NiO-MgO，在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出卓越性能，乙炔产率超过20%。

3. 难还原的碱金属或碱土金属氧化物在丙烷ODH中表现出最佳性能，提供了与其他催化剂类型相比更高的烯烃产率。
