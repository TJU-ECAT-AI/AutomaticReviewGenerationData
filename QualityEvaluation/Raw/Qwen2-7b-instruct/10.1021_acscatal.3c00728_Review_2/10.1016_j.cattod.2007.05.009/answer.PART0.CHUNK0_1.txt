[1] "The case of propane ODH is different because the best yields reported are still far from being interesting for industrial implementation. Conditions leading to best propylene yields also lead to the co-production of significant amounts of ethylene; therefore, the finding of a catalyst capable of combining industrially acceptable conversion/productivity with specificity to this olefin is still the major objective."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The main challenge in propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is finding a catalyst that can produce propylene with acceptable conversion and productivity while maintaining high selectivity to propylene. Current catalysts lead to the co-production of ethylene, which complicates industrial implementation.

[1] "For instance, with a Li/Dy-MgO catalyst, at 650 C, the propylene yield is close to 24%, but if the formation of ethylene is also taken into account, the overall olefin yield is close to 48%."
