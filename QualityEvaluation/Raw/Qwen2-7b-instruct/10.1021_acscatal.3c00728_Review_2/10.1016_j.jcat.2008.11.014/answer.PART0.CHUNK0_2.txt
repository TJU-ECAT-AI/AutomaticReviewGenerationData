1. The research discusses the development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. These sites offer a higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. They attract significant research interest due to their unique structural features that enhance catalytic performance.
2. γ-Al2O3 supports mainly contain oligomers with varying degrees of nuclearity and a portion of isolated species, but no Cr2O3 particles. This indicates a different structure of chromium species on γ-Al2O3 compared to other supports.
3. Oligomeric chromium species on xCrAl2O3 are found to be more active and selective than isolated chromium sites, highlighting their importance in ODHP reactions.
4. In xCrSBA-15, isolated chromium(III) sites with coordination numbers greater than four are found to be more active, selective, and stable than chromium sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. This suggests that the structure of active sites significantly influences catalytic performance.

1. 研究讨论了用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的硼基催化剂中2-D分散活性位点的开发。这些位点在活性位点密度方面比线性分散的边缘位点更高。它们因独特的结构特征而吸引大量研究兴趣，这些特征能增强催化性能。
2. γ-Al2O3支持物主要包含不同核度的寡聚体和部分孤立物种，但没有Cr2O3颗粒。这表明γ-Al2O3上的铬物种结构与其它支持物不同。
3. xCrAl2O3上的寡聚铬物种被发现比孤立铬位点更活跃和选择性，强调了它们在ODHP反应中的重要性。
4. 在xCrSBA-15中，协调数大于四的孤立铬(III)位点被发现比结晶Cr2O3表面的铬位点更活跃、选择性和稳定。这表明活性位点的结构显著影响催化性能。
