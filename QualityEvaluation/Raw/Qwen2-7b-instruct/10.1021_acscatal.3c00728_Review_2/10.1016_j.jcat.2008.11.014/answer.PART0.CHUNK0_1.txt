<p>It is known that DHP activity increases with Cr loading and a typical industrial Cr catalyst contains 13 wt% Cr at which level heterogeneous distribution of Cr species is virtually unavoidable [23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] . Thus, it has been a major challenge to gain definitive information on the nature of active Cr sites.</p>
<p>As evidenced from various studies, the distribution of Cr species is strongly dependent on the nature of the support, Cr content and method of activation [23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] . A variety of Cr species (isolated, dimers, trimers, polymeric species with different nuclearity and large Cr2O3 clusters) with different oxidation and coordination states and with different redox properties coexist in the same catalyst.</p>
<p>Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles.</p>
<p>Among xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., 1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr).</p>
<p>The intrinsic activity of these isolated Cr species is higher than those observed on γ-Al2O3 (1 wt% Cr).</p>
<p>Interestingly, among xCrAl2O3, the catalysts dominated by oligomeric species show the highest activity, indicating the important role of the species in the reaction.</p>
<p>In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state.</p>

The literature does not provide specific details about how 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. However, it does mention that 2-D dispersed active sites offer higher active site density and improved catalytic performance compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. The unique structural features of these sites have attracted significant research interest due to their ability to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP reaction.
