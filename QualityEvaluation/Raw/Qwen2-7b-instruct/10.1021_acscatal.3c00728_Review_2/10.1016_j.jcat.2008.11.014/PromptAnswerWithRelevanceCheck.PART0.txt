The nature of active chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane: New insights by a comprehensive spectroscopic study

Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) was studied over a series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, to gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function. To this end, the catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopyenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEMEDXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS). 

All these characterization techniques indicate that, at 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral ( ) coordination, whilst on γ-Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species. At 5 wt% Cr, SBA-15 is dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, besides a fraction of isolated Cr(VI) species in coordination. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles.

<p>It is known that DHP activity increases with Cr loading and a typical industrial Cr catalyst contains 13 wt% Cr at which level heterogeneous distribution of Cr species is virtually unavoidable [23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] . Thus, it has been a major challenge to gain definitive information on the nature of active Cr sites.</p>
<p>As evidenced from various studies, the distribution of Cr species is strongly dependent on the nature of the support, Cr content and method of activation [23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] . A variety of Cr species (isolated, dimers, trimers, polymeric species with different nuclearity and large Cr2O3 clusters) with different oxidation and coordination states and with different redox properties coexist in the same catalyst.</p>
<p>Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles.</p>
<p>Among xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., 1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr).</p>
<p>The intrinsic activity of these isolated Cr species is higher than those observed on γ-Al2O3 (1 wt% Cr).</p>
<p>Interestingly, among xCrAl2O3, the catalysts dominated by oligomeric species show the highest activity, indicating the important role of the species in the reaction.</p>
<p>In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state.</p>

The literature does not provide specific details about how 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. However, it does mention that 2-D dispersed active sites offer higher active site density and improved catalytic performance compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. The unique structural features of these sites have attracted significant research interest due to their ability to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP reaction.

1. The research discusses the development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. These sites offer a higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites. They attract significant research interest due to their unique structural features that enhance catalytic performance.
2. γ-Al2O3 supports mainly contain oligomers with varying degrees of nuclearity and a portion of isolated species, but no Cr2O3 particles. This indicates a different structure of chromium species on γ-Al2O3 compared to other supports.

1. At 1 wt% Cr content, the SBA-15 catalyst contains only isolated Cr(VI) species in coordination, while γ-Al2O3 contains isolated sites along with a fraction of oligomers (including dimers).

2. At 5 wt% Cr, the SBA-15 catalyst forms crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, while γ-Al2O3 forms oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity instead of Cr2O3 particles.

3. The intrinsic catalytic activity of chromium species (isolated or oligomers) varies depending on the support material (SBA-15 or Al2O3) where they are stabilized, as demonstrated by the catalytic performance results.

4. In the xCrSBA-15 catalyst, isolated Cr(III) species with a coordination number greater than four are more active, selective, and stable compared to Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. Conversely, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr species on xCrAl2O3 for the DHP reaction.

5. However, the oligomeric species on xCrAl2O3 are less stable against regeneration compared to the former species, as indicated by the second DHP run and in situ XANES studies.

1. 在1 wt% Cr含量下，SBA-15催化剂仅含有协调状态下的孤立Cr(VI)物种，而γ-Al2O3催化剂除了孤立位点外，还包含一部分寡聚体（包括二聚体）。

2. 在5 wt% Cr含量下，SBA-15催化剂主要形成结晶态α-Cr2O3粒子，而γ-Al2O3催化剂主要形成具有不同核度的寡聚体，而不是Cr2O3粒子。

3. 铬物种（孤立或寡聚体）的内在催化活性依赖于它们被稳定在的支撑材料（SBA-15或Al2O3），这一结论通过催化性能结果得到了验证。

4. 在xCrSBA-15催化剂中，与表面结晶态Cr2O3粒子上的Cr位点相比，孤立Cr(III)物种的协调数大于四时，它们更具有活性、选择性和稳定性。相反，xCrAl2O3催化剂上固定的寡聚体Cr物种对于DHP反应更为活跃和选择性。

5. 然而，xCrAl2O3催化剂上的寡聚体物种在再生过程中比前者的物种稳定性更低，这一点由第二次DHP运行和原位XANES研究得到证实。
