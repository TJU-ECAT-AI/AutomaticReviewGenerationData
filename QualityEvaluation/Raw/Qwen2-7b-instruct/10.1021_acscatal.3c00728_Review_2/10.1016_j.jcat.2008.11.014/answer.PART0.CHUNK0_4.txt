[4] "In xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) species with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr species stabilized on xCrAl2O3 for DHP."
[5] "However, the former species are less stable against regeneration than the latter as evidenced from the second DHP run and in situ XANES."

1. At 1 wt% Cr content, the SBA-15 catalyst contains only isolated Cr(VI) species in coordination, while γ-Al2O3 contains isolated sites along with a fraction of oligomers (including dimers).

2. At 5 wt% Cr, the SBA-15 catalyst forms crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, while γ-Al2O3 forms oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity instead of Cr2O3 particles.

3. The intrinsic catalytic activity of chromium species (isolated or oligomers) varies depending on the support material (SBA-15 or Al2O3) where they are stabilized, as demonstrated by the catalytic performance results.

4. In the xCrSBA-15 catalyst, isolated Cr(III) species with a coordination number greater than four are more active, selective, and stable compared to Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. Conversely, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr species on xCrAl2O3 for the DHP reaction.

5. However, the oligomeric species on xCrAl2O3 are less stable against regeneration compared to the former species, as indicated by the second DHP run and in situ XANES studies.

1. 在1 wt% Cr含量下，SBA-15催化剂仅含有协调状态下的孤立Cr(VI)物种，而γ-Al2O3催化剂除了孤立位点外，还包含一部分寡聚体（包括二聚体）。

2. 在5 wt% Cr含量下，SBA-15催化剂主要形成结晶态α-Cr2O3粒子，而γ-Al2O3催化剂主要形成具有不同核度的寡聚体，而不是Cr2O3粒子。

3. 铬物种（孤立或寡聚体）的内在催化活性依赖于它们被稳定在的支撑材料（SBA-15或Al2O3），这一结论通过催化性能结果得到了验证。

4. 在xCrSBA-15催化剂中，与表面结晶态Cr2O3粒子上的Cr位点相比，孤立Cr(III)物种的协调数大于四时，它们更具有活性、选择性和稳定性。相反，xCrAl2O3催化剂上固定的寡聚体Cr物种对于DHP反应更为活跃和选择性。

5. 然而，xCrAl2O3催化剂上的寡聚体物种在再生过程中比前者的物种稳定性更低，这一点由第二次DHP运行和原位XANES研究得到证实。
