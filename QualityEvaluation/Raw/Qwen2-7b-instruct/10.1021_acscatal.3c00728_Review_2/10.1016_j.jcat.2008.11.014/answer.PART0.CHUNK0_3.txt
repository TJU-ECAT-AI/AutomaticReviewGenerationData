The nature of active chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane: New insights by a comprehensive spectroscopic study Abstract Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) was studied over a series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, to gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function. To this end, the catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopyenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEMEDXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS).

孤立的Cr物种的内在活性高于γ-Al2O3（1 wt% Cr）中观察到的活性。值得注意的是，在xCrAl2O3催化剂中，以寡聚物种为主的催化剂显示出最高的活性，强调了这些物种在反应中的重要作用。

Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles. Among xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., 1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr).

Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 mainly consists of oligomers with varying degrees of nucleus and a portion of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles. Within the xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those with solely isolated Cr species (1 wt% Cr) display higher activity and selectivity per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr).

值得注意的是，γ-Al2O3主要由具有不同核度的寡聚物以及部分孤立物种组成，但没有Cr2O3颗粒。在xCrSBA-15催化剂中，仅含有孤立Cr物种（1 wt% Cr）的催化剂在每摩尔Cr的活性和选择性方面比主要由晶态α-Cr2O3颗粒组成的催化剂更高。
