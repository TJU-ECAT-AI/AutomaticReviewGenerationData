[1] "The surface areas of the samples decreased as the boria loading was increased."
[2] "All catalysts tested for the rearrangement reaction diminished in activity with time-onstream."
[3] "There was a direct relationship between the amount of coke which formed on the surface and the loss in catalytic activity."
[4] "This loss was least for the highest boron oxide loading tested, and this catalyst also featured the least amount of coke formation."
[5] "Selectivity to caprolactam was associated with the presence of surface acidic sites of intermediate strength."
[6] "A correlation was observed between the concentration of these surface sites and the selectivity to caprolactam."

The document does not provide information on how 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, nor does it compare their advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance. Furthermore, it does not explain why these unique structural features have attracted significant research interest in the field.

文档没有提供关于如何在硼基催化剂中开发ODHP反应的2-D分散活性位点的信息，也没有比较它们在活性位点密度和催化性能方面的优势与线性分散边沿位点。此外，它也没有解释为什么这些独特的结构特征吸引了研究领域的广泛关注。
