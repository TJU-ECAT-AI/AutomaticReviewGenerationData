[1] "Boron oxide catalysts supported on alumina have been prepared with boria loadings in the range 020 wt.-%."
[2] "The surface areas of the samples decreased as the boria loading was increased, and all catalysts tested for the rearrangement reaction diminished in activity with time-onstream."
[3] "There was a direct relationship between the amount of coke which formed on the surface and the loss in catalytic activity."
[4] "This loss was least for the highest boron oxide loading tested, and this catalyst also featured the least amount of coke formation."
[5] "Selectivity to caprolactam was associated with the presence of surface acidic sites of intermediate strength."
[6] "A correlation was observed between the concentration of these surface sites and the selectivity to caprolactam."

The study focused on boron oxide catalysts supported on alumina for the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime to caprolactam. As the boria loading increased, the surface area of the samples decreased, leading to a decrease in activity over time. Catalysts with higher boria loadings showed less coke formation and maintained their activity better than those with lower loadings. Surface acidic sites of intermediate strength correlated with selectivity towards caprolactam, influencing the reaction efficiency.

研究集中在硼氧化物催化剂上，这些催化剂支持在氧化铝上，用于将环己酮肟转化为己内酰胺。随着三氧化二硼负载量的增加，样品的比表面积下降，导致活性随时间下降。与较低负载相比，较高负载的催化剂显示出较少的焦炭形成和更好的保持活动性。表面酸性中等强度的位点与己内酰胺的选择性相关联，影响反应效率。
