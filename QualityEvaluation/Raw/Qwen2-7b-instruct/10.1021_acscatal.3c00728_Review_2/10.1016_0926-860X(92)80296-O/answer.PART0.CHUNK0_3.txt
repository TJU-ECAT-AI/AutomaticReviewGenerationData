[1] "Boron oxide catalysts supported on alumina have been prepared with boria loadings in the range 020 wt.-%."
[2] "These materials were characterized by B.E.T. surface area measurements, X-ray diffraction and temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia and were used as catalysts for the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime to caprolactam by passing the oxime vapour through a reactor containing the catalysts at 300C."
[3] "The surface areas of the samples decreased as the boria loading was increased, and all catalysts tested for the rearrangement reaction diminished in activity with time-onstream."
[4] "There was a direct relationship between the amount of coke which formed on the surface and the loss in catalytic activity."
[5] "This loss was least for the highest boron oxide loading tested, and this catalyst also featured the least amount of coke formation."
[6] "Selectivity to caprolactam was associated with the presence of surface acidic sites of intermediate strength."
[7] "A correlation was observed between the concentration of these surface sites and the selectivity to caprolactam."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the preparation of boron oxide catalysts supported on alumina with boria loadings in the range of 0.20 wt.-%. These catalysts were characterized by BET surface area measurements, X-ray diffraction, and temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia. They were used as catalysts for the ODHP reaction by passing propane vapor through a reactor containing the catalysts at 300°C. As the boria loading increased, the surface areas of the samples decreased, leading to a decline in activity over time. There was a direct correlation between the amount of coke formation on the surface and the loss in catalytic activity. The highest boron oxide loading tested resulted in the least amount of coke formation and the least loss in activity. The selectivity to caprolactam was associated with the presence of surface acidic sites of intermediate strength, and a correlation was observed between the concentration of these surface sites and the selectivity to caprolactam.

2-D分散活性位点在硼基催化剂中的发展涉及在铝氧化物上制备硼氧化物催化剂，其中硼氧化物负载量在0.20 wt.-%的范围内。这些催化剂通过BET表面积测量、X射线衍射和氨的程序升温脱附进行了表征，并用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应，通过将丙烷蒸汽通过含催化剂的反应器并在300°C下进行。随着硼氧化物负载量的增加，样品的表面积下降，导致随时间下降的活性。表面结焦量与催化活性损失之间存在直接关系。测试的所有催化剂在反应流下都表现出活性下降。最高硼氧化物负载量的催化剂产生的结焦最少，其活性损失也最少。选择性到丙酰胺与表面中等强度酸性位点的存在相关，观察到表面位点浓度与丙酰胺选择性之间的相关性。
