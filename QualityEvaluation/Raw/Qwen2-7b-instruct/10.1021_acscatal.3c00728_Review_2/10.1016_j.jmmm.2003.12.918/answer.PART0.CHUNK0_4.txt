1. 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through advanced synthesis techniques that promote the formation of flat, two-dimensional structures. These sites offer higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites.
2. The higher active site density of 2-D dispersed sites provides greater surface area for reactions, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. This is because more active sites are available for the ODHP reaction, which increases the likelihood of successful chemical conversions.
3. Their unique structural features, such as the flat geometry and potentially enhanced electronic properties, contribute to improved selectivity and activity. This means that the catalyst can more efficiently convert propane into desired products while minimizing byproducts.
4. The research interest in these unique structural features stems from the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of the ODHP process. By doing so, it offers a promising pathway for the production of valuable chemicals from propane, which is a key feedstock in the petrochemical industry.

1. 硼基催化剂中分散的二维活性位点通过先进的合成技术开发，形成平铺的二维结构。这些位点相较于线性分散边缘位点具有更高的活性位点密度。
2. 二维分散位点的更高活性位点密度提供了更大的反应表面，从而增强了催化性能。这是因为更多的活性位点可供氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应使用，增加了化学转化成功的可能性。
3. 这些独特的结构特征，如平坦的几何形状和可能增强的电子性质，有助于提高选择性和活性。这意味着催化剂可以更高效地将丙烷转化为所需产品，同时减少副产品的产生。
4. 对这些独特结构特征的研究兴趣源于有可能显著提高ODHP过程的效率。这为从丙烷生产有价值的化学品提供了有前景的方法，丙烷是石油化工行业的关键原料。
