1. 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through advanced synthesis techniques that promote the formation of flat, two-dimensional structures. These sites offer higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites.
2. The higher active site density of 2-D dispersed sites provides greater surface area for reactions, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. This is because more active sites are available for the ODHP reaction, which increases the likelihood of successful chemical conversions.
3. Their unique structural features, such as the flat geometry and potentially enhanced electronic properties, contribute to improved selectivity and activity. This means that the catalyst can more efficiently convert propane into desired products while minimizing byproducts.
4. The research interest in these unique structural features stems from the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of the ODHP process. By doing so, it offers a promising pathway for the production of valuable chemicals from propane, which is a key feedstock in the petrochemical industry.
