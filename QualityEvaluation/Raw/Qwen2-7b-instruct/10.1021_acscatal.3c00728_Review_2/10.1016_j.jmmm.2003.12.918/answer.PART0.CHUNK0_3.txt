1. The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through creating a two-dimensional structure where the active sites are distributed across the surface. This approach offers a higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites due to its planar arrangement, which enhances catalytic performance.
2. The higher active site density achieved with 2-D dispersed active sites is attributed to their planar arrangement, allowing for more efficient utilization of the catalyst surface area. This leads to improved selectivity and activity in the ODHP reaction, attracting significant research interest in the field.

1. 在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应中，硼基催化剂的二维分散活性位点通过在表面形成二维结构并分布活性位点来开发。与线性分散边缘位点相比，这种方法提供了更高的活性位点密度，由于其平面排列，这提高了催化性能。
2. 二维分散活性位点的更高活性位点密度归因于它们的平面排列，允许更高效地利用催化剂表面积。这导致了ODHP反应选择性和活性的提高，吸引了该领域的大量研究兴趣。
