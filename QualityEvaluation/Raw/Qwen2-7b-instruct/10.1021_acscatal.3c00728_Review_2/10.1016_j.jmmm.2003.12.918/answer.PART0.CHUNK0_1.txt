The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through creating a two-dimensional structure with active sites spread throughout. These sites provide a higher density of active sites compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, which results in improved catalytic performance. The distinctive structural characteristics of 2-D dispersed active sites have garnered substantial research interest because of their capability to boost selectivity and efficiency in the ODHP process.
