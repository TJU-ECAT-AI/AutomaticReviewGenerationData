1. The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through creating a two-dimensional structure with non-linear dispersion of active sites. These sites offer higher density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, resulting in improved catalytic performance.
2. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed active sites have attracted significant research interest because they can potentially enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process.
