[1] "Remarkable stability was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test with steady conversion and product selectivity."
[2] "As reported herein our group found that boron nitride, after steam hydroxylation at the edges, can efficiently catalyze the ODH reaction of propane."
[3] "The BNOH catalyst provided surprisingly high selectivity toward propylene during ODH of propane at 530C."
[4] "The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst in the ODH of propane was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test at 530C, in which no significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity occurred."
[5] "The active BNO. site, generated dynamically through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen, triggered propane dehydrogenation by selectively breaking the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2."
[6] "The BNOH catalyst inherited a hexagonal layered structure of boron nitride."
[7] "Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation."

The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through steam hydroxylation at the edges of boron nitride. These edge sites offer specific advantages over linearly dispersed sites due to their higher density of active sites. The unique structural features of having zigzag edges and a high number of newly created edges during steam activation attract significant research interest. The hexagonal layered structure of boron nitride, with its in-plane lattice symmetry, supports the formation of these edge sites, which are crucial for the efficient catalysis of the ODHP reaction.

硼基催化剂中的二维分散活性位点通过蒸汽羟化在硼氮化物边缘处开发。这些边缘位点相对于线性分散位点具有特定优势，因为它们具有更高的活性位点密度。由于具有锯齿状边缘和在蒸汽激活过程中新创建的大量边缘的独特结构特征，引起了研究界的广泛关注。六角层状结构的硼氮化物支持形成这些边缘位点，这是有效催化丙烷氧化脱氢反应的关键。
