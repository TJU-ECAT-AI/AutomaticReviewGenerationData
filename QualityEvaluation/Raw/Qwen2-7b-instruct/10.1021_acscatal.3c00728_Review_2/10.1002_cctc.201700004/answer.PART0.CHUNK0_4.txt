[1] "Remarkable stability was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test with steady conversion and product selectivity."
[2] "The active BNO. site, generated dynamically through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen, triggered propane dehydrogenation by selectively breaking the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2."
[3] "The BNOH catalyst provided surprisingly high selectivity toward propylene during ODH of propane at 530C."
[4] "The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst in the ODH of propane was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test at 530C, in which no significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity occurred."
[5] "We show that edge-hydroxylated boron nitride offers high selectivity toward propylene (up to 80.2%) at higher propane conversion (20.6%)."

The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through the steam activation of pristine boron nitride to generate BOH groups at the edges. These edge sites offer higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites due to the increased number of exposed edges. This leads to improved catalytic performance, specifically enhanced selectivity for propylene production and minimized CO2 formation. The unique structural features of having densely populated edge sites, combined with the dynamic generation of active sites through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen, make boron-based catalysts particularly attractive for ODHP. The ability to selectively break the CH bond while simultaneously preventing the overoxidation of propylene to CO2 is a key advantage offered by these catalysts. These properties have attracted significant research interest due to their potential for efficient and environmentally friendly propylene production through the ODHP process.

氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中，硼基催化剂的二维分散活性位点是通过将原始的硼氮化物在蒸汽激活过程中生成BOH基团于边缘来开发的。与线性分散的边缘位点相比，这些边缘位点提供了更高的活性位点密度，因为暴露的边缘数量增加。这导致了催化性能的改进，尤其是丙烯产量的高选择性和CO2形成的最小化。这些独特的结构特征，即具有高度集中的边缘位点，并且能够通过分子氧对BOH基团的氢抽象动态生成活性位点，使硼基催化剂特别吸引人。能够选择性地断裂CH键同时同时阻止丙烯过氧化为CO2是这些催化剂的关键优势。这些性质吸引了大量研究兴趣，因为它们有可能通过ODHP过程高效且环境友好地生产丙烯。
