[1] "Recently, Hermans's group reported that boron nitride exhibits a high selectivity to propylene (79%) and ethylene (12%) at 14% conversion in the ODH reaction of propane."
[2] "Nevertheless, in view of activity, selectivity, and stability, there is still room for improvements, and a detailed structural characterization of this novel catalytic system and a better understanding of the structureactivity correlation in the ODH reaction of propane are still needed."
[3] "As reported herein our group found that boron nitride, after steam hydroxylation at the edges, can efficiently catalyze the ODH of propane."
[4] "We show that edge-hydroxylated boron nitride offers high selectivity toward propylene (up to 80.2%) at higher propane conversion (20.6%)."
[5] "At a 6.5% conversion level of propane, it offers a surprising propylene selectivity as high as 97.4%."
[6] "Remarkable stability was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test with steady conversion and product selectivity."
[7] "The active BNO. site, generated dynamically through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen, triggered propane dehydrogenation by selectively breaking the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2."

Answer: How are 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, what specific advantages do they offer over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance, and why have these unique structural features attracted significant research interest in the field?

The boron nitride catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction feature 2-D dispersed active sites, specifically at the edges after steam hydroxylation. These sites offer a high selectivity toward propylene, reaching up to 80.2% at a propane conversion of 20.6%. At a lower conversion level of 6.5%, the selectivity towards propylene is even higher, reaching 97.4%. The dynamic generation of active sites through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen allows for selective breaking of the CH bond in propane, while simultaneously preventing the overoxidation of propylene to CO2. The 2-D dispersion of these active sites increases the surface area available for reactions compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, enhancing both the density of active sites and catalytic performance. This unique structural feature, combined with improved selectivity and stability, has attracted significant research interest in developing more efficient and selective catalysts for the ODHP reaction.

如何在氧化脱氢反应中通过硼基催化剂开发出二维分散的活性位点，这些活性位点与线性边缘位点相比在活性位点密度和催化性能方面有何优势，以及为什么这些独特的结构特征吸引了研究领域的广泛关注？

氧化脱氢反应中的硼氮化物催化剂在其边缘经过蒸汽羟基化后形成了二维分散的活性位点。这些位点能够提供高达80.2%的丙烯选择性，在丙烷转化率为20.6%时。在较低的转化率（6.5%）下，丙烯的选择性甚至更高，达到97.4%。通过分子氧对BOH团簇的氢抽象动态生成活性位点，允许选择性地断裂丙烷中的CH键，同时阻止丙烯过氧化生成CO2。二维分散的活性位点相较于线性边缘位点增加了反应表面面积，提高了活性位点密度和催化性能。独特的结构特性，结合改进的选择性和稳定性，吸引了研究领域对更高效、选择性更强的催化剂进行开发的广泛关注。
