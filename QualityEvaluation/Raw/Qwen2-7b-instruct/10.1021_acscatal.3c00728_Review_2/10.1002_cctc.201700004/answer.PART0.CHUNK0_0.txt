[1] "We show that edge-hydroxylated boron nitride offers high selectivity toward propylene (up to 80.2%) at higher propane conversion (20.6%)."
[2] "The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst in the ODH of propane was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test at 530C, in which no significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity occurred."
[3] "As reported herein our group found that boron nitride, after steam hydroxylation at the edges, can efficiently catalyze the ODH of propane."
[4] "Remarkable stability was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test with steady conversion and product selectivity."
[5] "We could show that the BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride selectively activate the CH bond in propane and simultaneously suppress the overoxidation of propylene into CO2."

The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through steam hydroxylation of boron nitride at its edges. These edge-hydroxylated sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. Firstly, they provide a higher density of active sites due to the increased number of exposed edges, enhancing the catalytic performance. Secondly, these unique structural features enable the selective activation of the CH bond in propane, facilitating the desired dehydrogenation process while suppressing overoxidation to CO2, thus improving the selectivity towards propylene. These features have attracted significant research interest because they promise a more efficient and selective route to propylene production compared to traditional methods.
