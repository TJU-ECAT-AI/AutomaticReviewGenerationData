[1] "Recent, Hermans's group reported that boron nitride exhibits a high selectivity to propylene (79%) and ethylene (12%) at 14% conversion in the ODH reaction of propane."
[2] "Nevertheless, in view of activity, selectivity, and stability, there is still room for improvements, and a detailed structural characterization of this novel catalytic system and a better understanding of the structureactivity correlation in the ODH reaction of propane are still needed."
[3] "As reported herein our group found that boron nitride, after steam hydroxylation at the edges, can efficiently catalyze the ODH of propane."
[4] "We show that edge-hydroxylated boron nitride offers high selectivity toward propylene (up to 80.2%) at higher propane conversion (20.6%)."
[5] "At a 6.5% conversion level of propane, it offers a surprising propylene selectivity as high as 97.4%."
[6] "Taking the equally important product ethylene into account, the selectivity for light olefins (ethylene+propylene, C23=) was up to 90.9%, which was much higher than the selectivities obtained over the well-developed metal or metal oxide catalysts at a comparable propane conversion level."
[7] "Moreover, the formation of CO2 (0.5%) was considerably lower than for the traditional ODH processes (1060% CO2), demonstrating the excellent performance of the current BNOH catalyst in the selective activation of the CH bond in propane."
[8] "The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst in the ODH of propane was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test at 530C, in which no significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity occurred."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves steam hydroxylation at the edges of boron nitride. This process creates numerous edge sites that serve as active sites for the ODHP reaction. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed active sites offer higher active site density due to the increased number of edges per unit area. This leads to enhanced catalytic performance and selectivity towards propylene. The unique structural features of boron nitride, including the edge hydroxylation, have attracted significant research interest because they enable efficient activation of the CH bond in propane with minimal CO2 formation and high selectivity for propylene. These characteristics make boron-based catalysts highly promising for the industrial application in ODHP processes.

2-D分散活性位点在硼基催化剂中通过蒸汽羟基化边缘的硼氮化物开发用于丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）。这一过程在硼氮化物的边缘生成大量的边缘位点，作为ODHP反应的活性位点。与线性分散的边缘位点相比，2-D分散的活性位点由于单位面积内的边缘数量增加而提供了更高的活性位点密度。这导致了增强的催化性能和丙烯选择性。硼基材料的独特结构特征，包括边缘羟基化，引起了研究者的极大兴趣，因为它们能够有效地激活丙烷中的CH键，并且CO2排放量极低，同时具有高丙烯选择性。这些特性使硼基催化剂成为工业ODHP过程的极具前景的选择。
