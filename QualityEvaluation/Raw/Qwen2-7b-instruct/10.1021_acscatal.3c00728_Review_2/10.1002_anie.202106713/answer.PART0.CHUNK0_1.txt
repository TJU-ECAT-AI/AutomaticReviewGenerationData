[1] "Four kinds of plasmas (N2, O2, H2, Ar) were accordingly employed to regulate the local chemical environment of h-BN."
[2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
[3] "The outcome indicated that N2-BN displayed the best performance, of which propane conversion of 26.0% and selectivity of 76.7% toward propylene or 89.4% for all olefins were achieved at 520C."
[4] "N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN."
[5] "As shown in Figure3e, there was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2."
[6] "In particular, due to abundant unpaired electrons of O atoms in isolated conjugated OB structures formed under the O2 plasma atmosphere, the signal intensity of O2-BN was much greater than that of other catalysts."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves utilizing the properties of plasma treatments to modify the local chemical environment of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Specifically, nitrogen-defects, particularly three-boron center nitrogen-defects (TBC), are formed through N2 plasma treatment. These defects are advantageous as they facilitate the conversion of propane to propylene, showcasing remarkable activity with a 26.0% propane conversion rate and 89.4% olefin selectivity at 520°C. The density of active sites is significantly enhanced due to the formation of these defects, which improves catalytic performance. The research interest in this approach stems from the unique structural features that enable efficient and selective conversion of propane to propylene, offering an alternative to conventional methods with enhanced efficiency and environmental benefits.

The specific advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites include a higher density of active sites, which translates to improved catalytic performance. Edge sites, while potentially reactive, may not be as densely populated as 2-D dispersed sites, limiting their overall catalytic efficiency. The 2-D dispersion allows for a more uniform distribution of active sites across the catalyst surface, enhancing the reaction kinetics and selectivity towards desired products.

The research interest in this method is driven by the potential for developing highly active and selective catalysts for the ODHP reaction, which is crucial for the production of propylene from propane. This approach not only offers a competitive alternative to traditional methods but also addresses the limitations associated with conventional routes, such as thermodynamic equilibrium constraints and coke formation. The development of such catalysts through plasma treatments represents a significant advancement in the field, enabling the exploration of new pathways for the efficient production of valuable chemicals.

开发硼基催化剂中二维分散活性位点用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的方法，通过利用等离子体处理来调节六方氮化硼（h-BN）的局部化学环境。具体而言，通过N2等离子体处理形成氮缺陷，特别是三个硼中心氮缺陷（TBC），这些缺陷在520°C下展现出出色的活性，实现了26.0%的丙烷转化率和89.4%的烯烃选择性。活性位点的密度显著提高，得益于这些缺陷的形成，从而提高了催化性能。研究兴趣源自这种独特结构特征能够高效且选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，提供了一种与传统方法相比具有更高效率和环境效益的替代方案。

与线性分散边缘位点相比，二维分散位点的具体优势在于活性位点的高密度，这直接提高了催化性能。边缘位点可能的反应活性较低，密度不如二维分散位点密集，限制了整体催化效率。二维分散允许活性位点在整个催化剂表面更均匀分布，增强反应动力学和目标产物的选择性。

对这种方法的研究兴趣源于开发高效且选择性的催化剂用于ODHP反应的可能性，这对于从丙烷生产丙烯至关重要。这种方法不仅提供了一种有竞争力的替代方案，而且解决了传统途径的局限性，如热力学平衡限制和焦炭形成。通过等离子体处理发展这样的催化剂代表了该领域的一个重大进展，为探索高效生产有价值的化学品的新途径提供了机会。
