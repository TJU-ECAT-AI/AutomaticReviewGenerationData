[1] "Four kinds of plasmas (N2, O2, H2, Ar) were accordingly employed to regulate the local chemical environment of h-BN."
[2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
[3] "While the sintering effect of the BOx species in O2-treated BN, led to the suppressed catalytic performance (12.4% conversion at 520C)."
[4] "N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN."
[5] "N2-BN contained the most oxygen-containing boron species, corresponding to the best ODH activity."
[6] "These results demonstrated that the enhanced reactivity was closely related to the increased N-defects."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves employing plasma treatments with different gases (N2, O2, H2, Ar) to modify the local chemical environment of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Specifically, N2 plasma is effective in breaking chemical bonds on the surface of h-BN in a controlled manner, leading to the formation of more three-boron center nitrogen-defects. These defects are considered favorable sites for generating active species involved in the ODHP reaction. In contrast, O2 plasma can lead to the sintering effect, causing BOx species to form and suppress catalytic performance. The increased density of N-defects, facilitated by N2 plasma, correlates with improved catalytic activity, as evidenced by higher propane conversion and olefin selectivity. This unique structural feature, characterized by 2-D dispersed active sites, has attracted significant research interest due to its potential for enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP reaction.

为了开发氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中硼基催化剂上的二维分散活性位点，通过使用不同的等离子体（N2、O2、H2、Ar）来调节六方氮化硼（h-BN）的局部化学环境。具体来说，N2等离子体能够以受控方式在h-BN表面打破化学键，导致形成更多三硼中心氮缺陷。这些缺陷被认为是生成ODHP反应中涉及的活性物种的有利位置。相比之下，O2等离子体会导致烧结效应，导致BOx物种的形成并抑制催化性能。N2等离子体促进形成的高密度N缺陷与提高催化活性相关，如证明了较高的丙烷转化率和烯烃选择性。这种独特的结构特征，由二维分散的活性位点构成，因其提高ODHP反应的效率和选择性的潜力而引起了研究界的广泛关注。
