[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides."
[2] "However, high crystallinity of commercial h-BN and elusive cognition of active sites hindered the enhancement of utilization efficiency."
[3] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
[4] "While the sintering effect of the BOx species in O2-treated BN, led to the suppressed catalytic performance (12.4% conversion at 520C)."
[5] "Rational etching and chemical modifications on the surface of catalysts are critical for improving activity and understanding the reaction mechanism."
[6] "As an efficient up-to-down synthesis method, plasma technology not only provides a feasible way for the design of functionalized or defects-rich catalysts but also deepens the comprehension of active sites."

For the development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, the use of plasma treatments, particularly nitrogen plasma (N2), plays a crucial role. N2 plasma modifies the surface of boron nitride (BN) by creating more three-boron center nitrogen-defects, which are considered favorable sites for generating active species. These 2-D dispersed sites offer higher density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, leading to improved catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these sites, including the enhanced active site density and the ability to efficiently convert propane to propylene, have attracted significant research interest due to their potential for enhancing the ODHP reaction efficiency and selectivity.

对于氧化脱氢化反应中丙烷转化为丙烯的硼基催化剂中二维分散活性位点的发展，特别是氮等离子体的应用起着关键作用。氮等离子体通过在硼氮化物（BN）表面产生更多的三硼中心氮缺陷来修改表面，这些缺陷被认为是生成活性物种的理想位置。与线性分散边缘位点相比，这些二维分散的位点密度更高，从而提高了催化性能。这些位点的独特结构特性，包括增强的活性位点密度和高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯的能力，吸引了大量的研究兴趣，因为它们有可能提高ODHP反应的效率和选择性。
