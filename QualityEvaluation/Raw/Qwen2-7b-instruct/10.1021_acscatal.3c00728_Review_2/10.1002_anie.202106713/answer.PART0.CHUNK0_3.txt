[1] "Four kinds of plasmas (N2, O2, H2, Ar) were accordingly employed to regulate the local chemical environment of h-BN."
[2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
[3] "While the sintering effect of the BOx species in O2-treated BN, led to the suppressed catalytic performance (12.4% conversion at 520C)."
[4] "N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN."
[5] "O2-BN exhibited a wider band gap than BN, and the wider band got narrower after washing (O2-BN-wash: 2.7eV)."
[6] "The peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted (4.0cm1) relative to that of BN."
[7] "This transformation demonstrated that more N-defects sites were obtained, possibly due to nitrogen was more likely to leave the surface of h-BN and form low-boiling products such as N2, NOx through reacting with active species produced in plasma."
[8] "The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed and shown in Figure6."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the use of plasma treatments, specifically N2 plasma. N2 plasma modifies the local chemical environment of h-BN, leading to the creation of more three-boron center N-defects. These N-defects are advantageous as they are considered favorable sites for generating active species required for the ODHP reaction. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed sites offer higher active site density, potentially enhancing the catalytic performance. This unique structural feature has attracted significant research interest due to its potential to improve the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process.

氧化脱氢化反应（ODHP）中，通过等离子体处理特别是N2等离子体，发展了硼基催化剂的二维分散活性位点。N2等离子体会调节h-BN的局部化学环境，产生更多的三硼中心氮缺陷。这些氮缺陷被认为是有利的活性位点，能够促进ODHP反应。与线性边缘位点相比，二维分散位点具有更高的活性位点密度，可能提高催化性能。这种独特的结构特征吸引了大量的研究兴趣，因为它有可能提高ODHP过程的效率和选择性。
