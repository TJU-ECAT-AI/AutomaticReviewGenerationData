[1] "N2-BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
[2] "The outcome indicated that N2-BN displayed the best performance, of which propane conversion of 26.0% and selectivity of 76.7% toward propylene or 89.4% for all olefins were achieved at 520C."
[3] "Because N2 plasma could break chemical bonds linked in a controlled manner and abstract N element on the surface of BN, more three-boron center N-defects were formed, which were considered to be favorable sites for generating active species."
[4] "O2-BN showed the undesirable activity with the conversion of 12.4% of propane."
[5] "From the performance of H2-BN, although N-H and B-H were generated during the ODH reaction, they may not promote propane conversion."

1. 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) are developed through the use of N2 plasma. This process allows for the formation of more three-boron center N-defects, which are considered favorable sites for generating active species. These active sites are dispersed in a 2-D structure rather than being linearly dispersed at the edges, offering higher active site density and potentially better catalytic performance. This unique structural feature has attracted significant research interest because it may enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP reaction.

1. 对于丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP），通过使用N2等离子体在硼基催化剂中发展出二维分散的活性位点。这一过程允许形成更多的三硼中心N缺陷，被认为是生成活性物种的有利位置。这些活性位点以二维结构分散，而不是在边缘线性分散，提供更高的活性位点密度和可能更好的催化性能。这种独特的结构特征引起了大量研究兴趣，因为它可能会提高ODHP反应的效率和选择性。
