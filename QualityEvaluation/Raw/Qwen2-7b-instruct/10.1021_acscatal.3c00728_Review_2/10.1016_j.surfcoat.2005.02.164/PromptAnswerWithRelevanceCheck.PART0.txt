1. The 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction are developed through advanced synthesis methods that ensure uniform distribution across a two-dimensional plane. These sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites because they provide a higher density of active sites per unit area, leading to increased catalytic activity and efficiency. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed sites, such as their flat surface and well-defined edges, contribute significantly to enhanced catalytic performance by facilitating better interaction with reactants and promoting more effective conversion rates. This improvement in efficiency and selectivity makes these structures highly attractive for research and development in the field of chemical catalysis.
