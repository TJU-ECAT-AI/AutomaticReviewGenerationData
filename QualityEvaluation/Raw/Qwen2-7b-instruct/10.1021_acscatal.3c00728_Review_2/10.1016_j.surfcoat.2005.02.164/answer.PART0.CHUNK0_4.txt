The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface. This method offers specific advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, primarily through increased active site density. The higher density of 2-D sites results in greater conversion rates and selectivity, enhancing the overall catalytic performance. These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest because they promise improved efficiency in the ODHP process.
