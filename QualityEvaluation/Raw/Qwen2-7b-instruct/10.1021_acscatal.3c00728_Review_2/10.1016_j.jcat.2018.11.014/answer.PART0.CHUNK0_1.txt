Answer: 
In the context of developing 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, the literature highlights several key points. Firstly, the recent discovery of the antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) being highly active for the ODHP process of ethane and propane has opened up a new research direction. This is particularly significant as it allows for selective cleavage of the CH bond of alkanes through a metal-free catalyst, expanding the fundamental understanding of industrially important ODHP processes.

The literature emphasizes that h-BN catalysts convert propane to propylene with a high selectivity, reaching 80% and more than 90% for both propylene and ethylene, with minimal CO2 formation. This demonstrates the high efficiency and environmental benefits of such catalysts in industrial applications. The identification of boron species as crucial elements for high ODHP activity across various studies underscores the importance of boron in these processes.

Furthermore, the exploration of metal-free silicon boride catalysts aims to deepen our understanding of the catalytic origin of boron species and potentially pave the way for the development of other novel boron-based catalysts. The antioxidant property of silicon boride ensures the stability of these catalysts, which is essential for their practical use in industrial settings.

Regarding the advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites, the literature suggests that these unique structural features offer higher active site density. This enhanced density facilitates more efficient utilization of the catalyst surface, leading to improved catalytic performance. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts is thus attracting significant research interest due to their potential to enhance selectivity, efficiency, and stability in ODHP reactions.

In summary, the research highlights the innovative role of boron species in metal-free catalysts for ODHP reactions, with a focus on the development of 2-D dispersed active sites. These sites offer advantages in terms of active site density and catalytic performance, making them a promising area for future advancements in the field.

在开发用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的硼基催化剂中的二维分散活性位点时，文献提出了几个关键点。首先，最近发现抗氧化和化学惰性的六方硼氮化物（h-BN）对于乙烷和丙烷的ODHP过程具有高度活性，为烷烃CH键的选择性断裂开辟了新的研究方向。这特别重要，因为它允许通过无金属催化剂实现烷烃的氧化脱氢，从而扩大了工业上重要的ODHP过程的基本理解。

文献强调，h-BN催化剂可以将丙烷转化为丙烯，选择性达到80%，并且丙烯和乙烯的选择性均超过90%，CO2形成量极低（0.5%），在丙烷转化率为20.6%的情况下。这表明此类催化剂在工业应用中的高效性和环境优势。对硼物种作为高ODHP活动性关键元素的识别强调了硼在这些过程中的重要性。

此外，对无金属硅硼化物催化剂的研究旨在加深我们对硼物种催化原的理解，并可能开启探索其他新型硼基催化剂的可能性。硅硼化物的抗氧化特性确保了催化剂的稳定性，这对于它们在工业环境中的实际应用至关重要。

关于二维分散活性位点相对于线性边缘位点的优势，文献表明这些独特的结构特征提供了更高的活性位点密度。这种增强的密度使催化剂表面的利用更加有效，从而提高了催化性能。因此，对开发二维分散活性位点的硼基催化剂的研究引起了极大的兴趣，因为它们有可能提高选择性、效率和稳定性。

综上所述，研究强调了硼物种在无金属催化剂中的创新作用，特别是针对ODHP反应。重点在于开发二维分散活性位点，这些位点在活性位点密度和催化性能方面提供了优势，成为未来领域的一个有前景的研究领域。
