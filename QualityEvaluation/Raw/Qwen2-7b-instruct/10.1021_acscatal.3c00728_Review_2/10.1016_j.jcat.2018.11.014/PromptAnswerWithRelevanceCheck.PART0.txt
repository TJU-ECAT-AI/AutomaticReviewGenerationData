Due to the free coking and no equilibrium limitation in alkanes conversion, the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins offers an attractive route, but encounters the difficulty in selectivity control for olefins because of the over-oxidation reactions that produce a substantial amount of CO2.
The recent discovery that antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for ODH process of ethane and propane opens up a new research direction in selective cleavage of CH bond of alkanes by the metal-free catalyst.
Anyhow, people in different groups identified with the idea that the boron species could be truly indispensable element for high ODH activity.

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the use of boron species in a metal-free environment. These sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance due to their unique structural features. The 2-D dispersion allows for a higher concentration of active sites on the surface of the catalyst, enhancing its efficiency. The boron species, when present in this configuration, facilitate the selective cleavage of the C-H bond in propane, leading to the production of propylene. The advantages of these active sites include a higher yield of propylene, lower formation of unwanted byproducts such as CO2, and improved stability of the catalyst over time. These unique features have attracted significant research interest in the field, as they represent a promising avenue for developing more efficient and environmentally friendly methods for the conversion of alkanes to olefins.

Answer: 
In the context of developing 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, the literature highlights several key points. Firstly, the recent discovery of the antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) being highly active for the ODHP process of ethane and propane has opened up a new research direction. This is particularly significant as it allows for selective cleavage of the CH bond of alkanes through a metal-free catalyst, expanding the fundamental understanding of industrially important ODHP processes.

The literature emphasizes that h-BN catalysts convert propane to propylene with a high selectivity, reaching 80% and more than 90% for both propylene and ethylene, with minimal CO2 formation. This demonstrates the high efficiency and environmental benefits of such catalysts in industrial applications. The identification of boron species as crucial elements for high ODHP activity across various studies underscores the importance of boron in these processes.

Furthermore, the exploration of metal-free silicon boride catalysts aims to deepen our understanding of the catalytic origin of boron species and potentially pave the way for the development of other novel boron-based catalysts. The antioxidant property of silicon boride ensures the stability of these catalysts, which is essential for their practical use in industrial settings.

Regarding the advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites, the literature suggests that these unique structural features offer higher active site density. This enhanced density facilitates more efficient utilization of the catalyst surface, leading to improved catalytic performance. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts is thus attracting significant research interest due to their potential to enhance selectivity, efficiency, and stability in ODHP reactions.

In summary, the research highlights the innovative role of boron species in metal-free catalysts for ODHP reactions, with a focus on the development of 2-D dispersed active sites. These sites offer advantages in terms of active site density and catalytic performance, making them a promising area for future advancements in the field.

1. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) involves the formation of boron oxide (BO) groups on the surface of the catalyst. These groups participate in the reaction network and facilitate the cleavage of the CH bond in propane molecules, leading to the formation of olefins. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed sites offer a higher density of active sites, enhancing the catalytic performance of the ODHP reaction.

2. The advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP lie in their increased density and catalytic efficiency. These sites allow for a more uniform distribution of active sites across the catalyst surface, promoting more efficient utilization of the surface area and potentially increasing the reaction rate. The high density of 2-D dispersed sites also leads to a higher probability of collisions between reactant molecules and active sites, further enhancing the catalytic performance.

3. These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest in the field due to their potential to improve the selectivity and efficiency of ODHP processes. By facilitating the selective cleavage of the CH bond in propane molecules, these catalysts can produce valuable olefin products with high yield and minimal side reactions, such as the formation of CO2. Additionally, the enhanced selectivity and efficiency offered by 2-D dispersed active sites can lead to more sustainable and economically viable industrial processes for the production of olefins from propane.

4. The high ODH activity in silicon boride catalysts is most likely attributed to the formation of BOH groups from BO species on the surfaces of silicon boride with the assistance of steam. These BOH groups act as active sites in the ODHP reaction, enabling the selective cleavage of the CH bond in propane molecules and the formation of olefin products.

5. The kinetic analysis of the ODHP reaction over silicon boride catalysts reveals that the reaction order of oxygen is approximately 0.5. This indicates that molecular oxygen plays a crucial role in the ODHP process, possibly through the dissociation of oxygen molecules on the surface of the catalyst and subsequent incorporation into the reaction network.

6. The apparent activation energies (Ea) for the ODHP of ethane, propane, and isobutane over silicon boride catalysts are 268 kJ/mol, 244 kJ/mol, and 160 kJ/mol, respectively. These values are higher than those reported for metal oxide catalysts, suggesting that the ODHP reaction using silicon boride catalysts involves a more complex reaction mechanism that includes the activation of propane molecules.

7. The experimental support provided by this work confirms that the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiates the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, demonstrating the potential of silicon boride as an efficient and selective catalyst for ODHP processes.

5. 硅硼化物催化剂在ODHP过程中的动力学分析揭示了氧气的反应级数约为0.5。这表明氧气分子在ODHP过程中起着关键作用，可能通过在催化剂表面解离氧气分子并随后整合到反应网络中。

6. 乙烯、丙烷和异丁烷在硅硼化物催化剂上的ODHP的显热活化能分别为268 kJ/mol、244 kJ/mol和160 kJ/mol。这些值高于金属氧化物催化剂报道的值，表明使用硅硼化物催化剂进行ODHP反应涉及更复杂的反应机制，包括丙烷分子的激活。
