The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) involves the creation of antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). This material has proven to be highly active in cleaving the CH bond of alkanes without requiring a metal component. The discovery has expanded the fundamental understanding of the industrially important ODH process. Spectroscopic studies have suggested that BOH groups, formed at the edges of h-BN, act as active sites that selectively break the CH bond while preventing over-oxidation of propylene towards CO2. These findings have attracted significant research interest due to the potential for developing high-performance, metal-free catalysts for the ODH of alkanes.

Advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites include higher active site density, which can lead to improved catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these sites allow for more efficient interaction with reactants, potentially enhancing the rate of reaction and selectivity for desired products. Research interest in these sites stems from their potential to enable more efficient and environmentally friendly processes for the production of valuable olefins, such as propylene, from alkanes like propane.

2-D分散的活性位点在硼基催化剂中的发展涉及在抗氧化和化学惰性六方硼氮化物（h-BN）中构建。这种材料已被证明在不需要金属的情况下对烷烃的CH键具有高度活性。这一发现扩展了工业上重要的氧化脱氢过程的基本理解。光谱学研究表明，h-BN边缘处形成的BOH组合作为活性位点，可以选择性地断裂CH键同时阻止丙烯过氧化生成CO2。这些发现吸引了大量研究兴趣，因为它们有可能开发出高性能、无金属的催化剂来催化烷烃的氧化脱氢。

与线性分散的边缘位点相比，2-D分散的活性位点的优势包括更高的活性位点密度，这可能导致更好的催化性能。这些位点的独特结构特性允许更有效地与反应物相互作用，可能提高反应速率和所需产品的选择性。对这些位点的研究兴趣源于它们可能使烷烃如丙烷从丙烯更有效、更环保地生产有价值的烯烃的能力。
