1. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) involves the formation of boron oxide (BO) groups on the surface of the catalyst. These groups participate in the reaction network and facilitate the cleavage of the CH bond in propane molecules, leading to the formation of olefins. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed sites offer a higher density of active sites, enhancing the catalytic performance of the ODHP reaction.

2. The advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP lie in their increased density and catalytic efficiency. These sites allow for a more uniform distribution of active sites across the catalyst surface, promoting more efficient utilization of the surface area and potentially increasing the reaction rate. The high density of 2-D dispersed sites also leads to a higher probability of collisions between reactant molecules and active sites, further enhancing the catalytic performance.

3. These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest in the field due to their potential to improve the selectivity and efficiency of ODHP processes. By facilitating the selective cleavage of the CH bond in propane molecules, these catalysts can produce valuable olefin products with high yield and minimal side reactions, such as the formation of CO2. Additionally, the enhanced selectivity and efficiency offered by 2-D dispersed active sites can lead to more sustainable and economically viable industrial processes for the production of olefins from propane.

4. The high ODH activity in silicon boride catalysts is most likely attributed to the formation of BOH groups from BO species on the surfaces of silicon boride with the assistance of steam. These BOH groups act as active sites in the ODHP reaction, enabling the selective cleavage of the CH bond in propane molecules and the formation of olefin products.

5. The kinetic analysis of the ODHP reaction over silicon boride catalysts reveals that the reaction order of oxygen is approximately 0.5. This indicates that molecular oxygen plays a crucial role in the ODHP process, possibly through the dissociation of oxygen molecules on the surface of the catalyst and subsequent incorporation into the reaction network.

6. The apparent activation energies (Ea) for the ODHP of ethane, propane, and isobutane over silicon boride catalysts are 268 kJ/mol, 244 kJ/mol, and 160 kJ/mol, respectively. These values are higher than those reported for metal oxide catalysts, suggesting that the ODHP reaction using silicon boride catalysts involves a more complex reaction mechanism that includes the activation of propane molecules.

7. The experimental support provided by this work confirms that the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiates the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, demonstrating the potential of silicon boride as an efficient and selective catalyst for ODHP processes.

1. 2-D分散活性位点在硼基催化剂中通过在催化剂表面形成硼氧（BO）团簇，参与反应网络并促进丙烷分子中CH键的断裂，从而生成烯烃。与线性边缘位点相比，2-D分散位点提供更高的活性位点密度，提高了丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的催化性能。

2. 2-D分散活性位点相对于硼基催化剂中ODHP中的线性边缘位点的优势在于其更高的密度和催化效率。这些位点允许在整个催化剂表面上更均匀地分布活性位点，促进表面面积的有效利用，并可能提高反应速率。2-D分散位点的高密度也增加了活性位点与反应物分子碰撞的可能性，进一步提高了催化性能。
