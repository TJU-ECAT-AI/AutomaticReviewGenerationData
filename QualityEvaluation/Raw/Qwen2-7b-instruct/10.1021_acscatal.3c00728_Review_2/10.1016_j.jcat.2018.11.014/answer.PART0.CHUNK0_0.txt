Due to the free coking and no equilibrium limitation in alkanes conversion, the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins offers an attractive route, but encounters the difficulty in selectivity control for olefins because of the over-oxidation reactions that produce a substantial amount of CO2.
The recent discovery that antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for ODH process of ethane and propane opens up a new research direction in selective cleavage of CH bond of alkanes by the metal-free catalyst.
Anyhow, people in different groups identified with the idea that the boron species could be truly indispensable element for high ODH activity.

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the use of boron species in a metal-free environment. These sites offer advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance due to their unique structural features. The 2-D dispersion allows for a higher concentration of active sites on the surface of the catalyst, enhancing its efficiency. The boron species, when present in this configuration, facilitate the selective cleavage of the C-H bond in propane, leading to the production of propylene. The advantages of these active sites include a higher yield of propylene, lower formation of unwanted byproducts such as CO2, and improved stability of the catalyst over time. These unique features have attracted significant research interest in the field, as they represent a promising avenue for developing more efficient and environmentally friendly methods for the conversion of alkanes to olefins.

2-D分散的活性位点在硼基催化剂中用于丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的发展涉及使用无金属的硼物种。这些位点在活性位点密度和催化性能方面相对于线性分散的边缘位点提供了优势，这是由于它们的独特结构特征。2-D分散使得催化剂表面的活性位点浓度更高，从而提高了其效率。当硼物种以这种方式存在时，它们能够促进丙烷中C-H键的高选择性断裂，从而产生丙烯。这些活性位点的优点包括更高的丙烯产率、较少的副产物如CO2的形成，以及催化剂在长时间运行过程中的稳定性。这些独特特征吸引了研究领域的广泛关注，因为它们代表了一种有前途的方法，用于开发更高效且环境友好的方法将烷烃转化为烯烃。
