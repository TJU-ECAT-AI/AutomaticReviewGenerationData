[1] "Due to the free coking and no equilibrium limitation in alkanes conversion, the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins offers an attractive route, but encounters the difficulty in selectivity control for olefins because of the over-oxidation reactions that produce a substantial amount of CO2."
[2] "Nevertheless, the uncontrollable over-oxidation of olefins caused the formation of significant amounts of CO2 (1060%)."
[3] "The antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensured the catalytic stability."
[4] "Based on spectra and dynamics analysis, the BOH groups generated from the BO species with the assistance of steam might be catalytic activity sites."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the formation of boron oxide (BO) species on the surface of the catalyst. These BO species can generate borohydride (BOH) groups with the assistance of steam, which are believed to be the active sites responsible for the cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond in propane. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed sites offer a higher density of active sites, potentially enhancing the catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed sites attract significant research interest due to their potential for achieving high selectivity in the ODHP reaction, particularly in the production of propylene, with minimal formation of CO2. The antioxidant ability of the silicon boride catalyst ensures the stability of the reaction, contributing to its effectiveness in the ODHP process.

2-D分散活性位点在硼基催化剂中用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的发展涉及表面催化剂上硼氧化物（BO）物种的形成。这些BO物种可以通过蒸汽的帮助生成硼氢化（BOH）组分，被认为是催化活性位点，负责丙烷中碳-氢（CH）键的断裂。与线性分散的边缘位点相比，2-D分散位点提供了更高的活性位点密度，可能增强催化性能。这些2-D分散位点的独特结构特征吸引了大量研究兴趣，特别是由于它们在ODHP反应中实现高选择性的潜力，特别是在丙烯的生产中，同时尽量减少二氧化碳的形成。硅硼化物催化剂的抗氧化能力确保了反应的稳定性，有助于其在ODHP过程中的有效性。
