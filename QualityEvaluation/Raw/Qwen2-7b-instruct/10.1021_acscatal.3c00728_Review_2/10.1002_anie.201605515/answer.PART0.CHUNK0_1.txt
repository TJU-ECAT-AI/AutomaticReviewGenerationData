This document outlines a method for creating boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) through a thermal expansion triggered gas exfoliation process. The technique involves heating bulk boron nitride to a high temperature, which causes expansion and curling of the material. Following this, liquid nitrogen (L-N2) is introduced, leading to a rapid gasification and further exfoliation of the boron nitride. The resulting BNNS exhibit a nanosheet morphology with fewer than five atomic layers, and they have a high mass yield of 1620%. This process is advantageous due to its lack of chemical reagents, high yield, short reaction time, scalability, and low energy consumption. The BNNS have a high specific surface area, which is beneficial for their application in various fields such as catalysis, energy storage, and environmental adsorption. The method can potentially be adapted to produce other layered materials with optimized parameters.

本文描述了一种通过热膨胀触发的气体剥离方法来制备BNNS。该技术包括将硼氮化合物加热至高温，导致材料膨胀和卷曲。随后引入液氮（L-N2），导致快速气化并进一步剥离硼氮化合物。产生的BNNS表现出少于五层原子的纳米片形态，并具有1620%的高质量产率。这种方法的优势在于无需化学试剂、高产率、反应时间短、易于放大和低能耗。BNNS具有高比表面积，对催化、储能和环境吸附等领域应用有利。该方法有可能被调整以制备其他层状材料，并根据优化的参数进行调整。
