<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This document outlines a method for creating boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) through a thermal expansion triggered gas exfoliation process. The technique involves heating bulk boron nitride to a high temperature, which causes expansion and curling of the material. Following this, liquid nitrogen (L-N2) is introduced, leading to a rapid gasification and further exfoliation of the boron nitride. The resulting BNNS exhibit a nanosheet morphology with fewer than five atomic layers, and they have a high mass yield of 1620%. This process is advantageous due to its lack of chemical reagents, high yield, short reaction time, scalability, and low energy consumption. The BNNS have a high specific surface area, which is beneficial for their application in various fields such as catalysis, energy storage, and environmental adsorption. The method can potentially be adapted to produce other layered materials with optimized parameters.

[1] "As shown in Scheme1, when h-BN is heated to high temperature (800C), the interlayer distance and volume should expand."
[2] "Then, the h-BN is immediately dipped into the cryogenic L-N2 (196C)."
[3] "The instant local temperature variation (800C vs. 196C) not only leads to the curling and delamination of the h-BN, but also triggers the drastic expansion of L-N2 into gaseous N2 and exfoliates h-BN."
[4] "This novel gas exfoliation of high surface area BNNS not only opens up potential opportunities for wide applications, but also can be extended to produce other layered materials in high yields."
[5] "These results further demonstrate that the thermal expansion and L-N2 gasification play a synergistic role to exfoliate bulk h-BN."
[6] "The interaction energy reduced to 6.4kcalmol1 at 800C, indicating that the increase of temperature weakens the interaction between the interlayers of the h-BN."
[7] "In conclusion, an efficient thermal expansion triggered gas exfoliation method to prepare BNNS was successfully developed."

The boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) are synthesized through a method that combines high temperature-induced thermal expansion of bulk boron nitride (BN) and the subsequent cryogenic liquefaction of nitrogen gas (L-N2). This process leads to the curling and delamination of BN, followed by the gasification of L-N2 which exfoliates the BN into few-layered nanosheets. The method is advantageous due to its high yield, short reaction time, scalability, and energy efficiency. The BNNS exhibit a high specific surface area, which is beneficial for catalytic or adsorptive applications. The exfoliation process is facilitated by the significant reduction in the interaction energy between the BN layers at high temperatures, making the separation easier.

通过将高温诱导的硼氮化物（BN）块体膨胀与随后的液氮（L-N2）的冷凝相结合，合成硼氮化物纳米片（BNNS）。这一过程导致BN的卷曲和分层，随后是L-N2的气化，从而剥离BN为少数几层纳米片。该方法具有高产率、短反应时间、可放大性和低能耗的优势。BNNS表现出较高的比表面积，对催化或吸附应用有利。在高温下，BN层之间的相互作用能量显著降低，使分离变得更加容易，促进了剥离过程。

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the utilization of few-layered hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, particularly in terms of active site density and catalytic performance. The unique structural features of h-BN nanosheets, such as their high surface area and well-defined nanosheet morphology, contribute to an increased number of accessible active sites per unit area. This enhancement in active site density facilitates a higher efficiency in the ODHP reaction, leading to improved catalytic performance. Additionally, the high specific surface area of h-BN nanosheets allows for better adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products, which is crucial for the effective execution of the ODHP reaction. The research interest in these materials stems from their potential to overcome limitations encountered with traditional catalysts, offering a promising avenue for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for the ODHP reaction.

The high surface area and defined nanosheet morphology of h-BN nanosheets are key factors attracting significant research interest. These properties enable the creation of a dense array of 2-D dispersed active sites, which are critical for the successful implementation of the ODHP reaction. The ability to optimize reaction parameters to extend this gas exfoliation process to other layered materials also holds promise for expanding the applicability of boron-based catalysts across various industrial processes, enhancing their versatility and utility.
