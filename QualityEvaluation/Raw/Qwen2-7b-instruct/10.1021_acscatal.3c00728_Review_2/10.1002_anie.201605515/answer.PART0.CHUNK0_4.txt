The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves the utilization of few-layered hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, particularly in terms of active site density and catalytic performance. The unique structural features of h-BN nanosheets, such as their high surface area and well-defined nanosheet morphology, contribute to an increased number of accessible active sites per unit area. This enhancement in active site density facilitates a higher efficiency in the ODHP reaction, leading to improved catalytic performance. Additionally, the high specific surface area of h-BN nanosheets allows for better adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products, which is crucial for the effective execution of the ODHP reaction. The research interest in these materials stems from their potential to overcome limitations encountered with traditional catalysts, offering a promising avenue for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for the ODHP reaction.

The high surface area and defined nanosheet morphology of h-BN nanosheets are key factors attracting significant research interest. These properties enable the creation of a dense array of 2-D dispersed active sites, which are critical for the successful implementation of the ODHP reaction. The ability to optimize reaction parameters to extend this gas exfoliation process to other layered materials also holds promise for expanding the applicability of boron-based catalysts across various industrial processes, enhancing their versatility and utility.
