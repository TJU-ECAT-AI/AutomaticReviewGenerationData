This document describes a method for efficiently producing boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) through thermal expansion triggered gas exfoliation. The technique uses no chemical reagents, achieves high yields, has a short reaction time, is easily scalable, and consumes low energy. The resulting BNNS exhibit a defined nanosheet morphology and a high specific surface area, which can be optimized for other layered materials. These features make the method advantageous for the development of boron-based catalysts, particularly for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction.
