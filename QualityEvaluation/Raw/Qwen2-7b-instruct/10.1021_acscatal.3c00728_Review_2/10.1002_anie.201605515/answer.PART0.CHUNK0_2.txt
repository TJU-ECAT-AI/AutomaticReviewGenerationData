[1] "As shown in Scheme1, when h-BN is heated to high temperature (800C), the interlayer distance and volume should expand."
[2] "Then, the h-BN is immediately dipped into the cryogenic L-N2 (196C)."
[3] "The instant local temperature variation (800C vs. 196C) not only leads to the curling and delamination of the h-BN, but also triggers the drastic expansion of L-N2 into gaseous N2 and exfoliates h-BN."
[4] "This novel gas exfoliation of high surface area BNNS not only opens up potential opportunities for wide applications, but also can be extended to produce other layered materials in high yields."
[5] "These results further demonstrate that the thermal expansion and L-N2 gasification play a synergistic role to exfoliate bulk h-BN."
[6] "The interaction energy reduced to 6.4kcalmol1 at 800C, indicating that the increase of temperature weakens the interaction between the interlayers of the h-BN."
[7] "In conclusion, an efficient thermal expansion triggered gas exfoliation method to prepare BNNS was successfully developed."

The boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) are synthesized through a method that combines high temperature-induced thermal expansion of bulk boron nitride (BN) and the subsequent cryogenic liquefaction of nitrogen gas (L-N2). This process leads to the curling and delamination of BN, followed by the gasification of L-N2 which exfoliates the BN into few-layered nanosheets. The method is advantageous due to its high yield, short reaction time, scalability, and energy efficiency. The BNNS exhibit a high specific surface area, which is beneficial for catalytic or adsorptive applications. The exfoliation process is facilitated by the significant reduction in the interaction energy between the BN layers at high temperatures, making the separation easier.

通过将高温诱导的硼氮化物（BN）块体膨胀与随后的液氮（L-N2）的冷凝相结合，合成硼氮化物纳米片（BNNS）。这一过程导致BN的卷曲和分层，随后是L-N2的气化，从而剥离BN为少数几层纳米片。该方法具有高产率、短反应时间、可放大性和低能耗的优势。BNNS表现出较高的比表面积，对催化或吸附应用有利。在高温下，BN层之间的相互作用能量显著降低，使分离变得更加容易，促进了剥离过程。
