[1] "The present results indicate that the temperatures of support pre-calcination and of the catalyst activation are important preparation parameters that affecting the catalytic property of B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst."
[2] "This effect of PCT seems not important for the catalyst preparation when the late catalyst activation is set at CAT=600C."
[3] "As shown in Table 1, the surface areas of the supports with PCT<350C are more than three times higher than that of ZrO2-500, thus the 10% boria load is not enough to form a full monolayer over those support surfaces."
[4] "High percentage of the micropores can cause boria dispersion outside the pores and then induces, in addition to insufficient boria load (10%), in even higher percentage of the bare-support surface, which results in conversion of the oxime to the undesired byproducts."
[5] "The much lower lactam yields over the 10% B2O3/ZrO2-700-CAT catalysts are determined by the much lower activity for the oxime conversion."
[6] "On the average, about two boria overlayers are required for an optimum B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst."
[7] "The remarkable effect of CO2 as the carrier gas in enhancing both the lactam selectivity and the catalyst stability agrees qualitatively with the literature."
[8] "Alternately, the use of basic NH3 as the carrier proves to suppress the reactivity of the oxime as well as to diminish the lactam formation."
[9] "This concept can be explored for even better combinations and further study is required to detail the chemistry of the combinatorial effect."

1. The temperatures of support pre-calcination and of the catalyst activation play crucial roles in determining the catalytic properties of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst.
2. The effect of support pre-calcination temperature on catalyst activity becomes less significant when the late catalyst activation is carried out at a high temperature (600°C).
3. Supports pre-calcinated at lower temperatures (below 350°C) have significantly higher surface areas, making it insufficient for a full monolayer of boron oxide (B2O3) deposition.
4. High micropore content in supports with lower pre-calcination temperatures leads to boria dispersion outside the pores, resulting in a conversion of the reactant to unwanted byproducts.
5. Lower lactam yields are observed with catalysts prepared at higher temperatures (700°C) due to reduced activity in oxime conversion.
6. About two layers of boron oxide are typically needed for optimal catalytic activity in B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts.
7. Using carbon dioxide as the carrier gas enhances both lactam selectivity and catalyst stability, aligning with previous studies.
8. Ammonia as a carrier gas reduces the reactivity of the oxime and lactam formation, differing from findings in related literature.
9. The concept of optimizing the reaction atmosphere through a combination of solvents and carrier gases is promising, with further research needed to elucidate the underlying chemical mechanisms.

1. 支持预煅烧温度和催化剂活化温度对B2O3/ZrO2催化剂的催化性能起关键作用。
2. 当后期催化剂活化温度设置为600°C时，支持预煅烧温度的影响变得不那么重要。
3. 低于350°C预煅烧的支撑材料具有显著更高的表面积，使得B2O3沉积不足以形成完整的单层。
4. 预煅烧温度较低（以下）的支撑材料中的高微孔含量导致氧化物分散在孔外，从而导致反应物转化为副产物。
5. 在较高温度（700°C）下制备的催化剂显示出较低的乳酸酯产率，由于氧化物转化活性降低。
6. 通常需要约两层氧化硼才能达到B2O3/ZrO2催化剂的最佳催化活性。
7. 使用二氧化碳作为载气增强乳酸酯选择性和催化剂稳定性，与先前的研究一致。
8. 使用氨作为载气降低了氧基的反应性以及乳酸酯的形成，与相关文献中发现的结果不同。
9. 通过溶剂和载体气体的组合优化反应气氛的概念很有前景，需要进一步研究来阐明其背后的化学机制。
