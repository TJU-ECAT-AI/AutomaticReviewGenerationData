The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional array of active sites, as opposed to a linear dispersion along the edges of the catalyst particles. These 2-D dispersed sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including a higher density of active sites per unit volume of the catalyst. This leads to enhanced catalytic performance, typically manifested as higher conversion rates and/or selectivities for the desired products. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed sites have attracted significant research interest because they can potentially enable more efficient and selective chemical transformations, thereby improving the economics and environmental impact of industrial processes.

The specific advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites include:

1. Increased Active Site Density: By arranging active sites in a two-dimensional pattern, the total number of available sites for reaction increases significantly compared to linear arrangements. This can lead to higher overall reaction rates and improved product yields.

2. Enhanced Selectivity: The precise control over the spatial arrangement of active sites can lead to more selective catalysis. In some cases, this might involve directing reactions towards specific pathways or products, reducing unwanted side reactions.

3. Improved Reaction Kinetics: The geometry of 2-D structures can facilitate more efficient access to active sites by reactants, potentially leading to faster reaction rates.

4. Better Control Over Catalyst Properties: The design of 2-D structures allows for precise manipulation of properties such as surface area, pore size, and accessibility, which can be tuned to optimize catalytic activity and stability.

5. Reduced Agglomeration: Two-dimensional structures might exhibit better dispersion and stability under operating conditions, reducing the risk of agglomeration and loss of activity.

These factors have led to extensive research efforts aimed at developing new methods for the synthesis of 2-D dispersed active sites, exploring their fundamental properties, and applying them to a variety of catalytic processes, including the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The remarkable effect of CO2 as the carrier gas in enhancing both the lactam selectivity and the catalyst stability agrees qualitatively with the literature. This suggests that CO2 molecules function to keep basic sites from intervening into the reaction, possibly by neutralizing or preventing the formation of unfavorable intermediates. The use of basic NH3 as the carrier gas, on the other hand, results in a poisoning of the intermediate strong acid sites by NH3 molecules, which suppresses reactivity and diminishes lactam formation. This contrasts with previous findings by Landis and Venuto, indicating the complex interplay between carrier gas composition and catalytic performance in gas-phase reactions.

在氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）反应中，硼基催化剂上二维分散活性位点的发展涉及到在催化剂粒子边缘形成线性排列的活性位点。与线性排列的边部位点相比，二维分散位点提供了几个优势，包括单位体积催化剂中的活性位点密度更高。这通常导致增强的催化性能，表现为更高的转化率和/或所需产物的选择性。由于独特的结构特征，二维分散位点引起了研究界的广泛关注，因为它们有可能使化学转换更加高效和选择性，从而改善工业过程的经济性和环境影响。

2-D分散位点的具体优势包括：

1. 增加活性位点密度：通过以二维图案排列活性位点，单位体积中的可用位点数量显著增加，这可能导致更高的总体反应速率和产品收率。

2. 提高选择性：精确控制活性位点的空间排列可以实现更选择性的催化作用。在某些情况下，这可能涉及引导反应朝特定路径或产品进行，减少不希望的副反应。

3. 改进反应动力学：2-D结构的几何形状可能有助于更有效地使反应物接近活性位点，从而导致更快的反应速率。

4. 更好的催化剂性质控制：设计2-D结构允许对表面面积、孔径大小和可访问性等属性进行精细调整，这些属性可以被调整以优化催化活性和稳定性。

5. 减少聚集：二维结构可能表现出更好的分散性和稳定性，在运行条件下减少了聚集和活性丧失的风险。

这些因素导致了广泛的研究努力，旨在开发新的方法来合成2-D分散活性位点，探索它们的基本性质，并将它们应用于各种催化过程，包括氧化丙烷脱氢。

CO2作为载体气体增强乳酸选择性和催化剂稳定性的显着效果与文献一致。这表明CO2分子通过中和或防止形成不利中间体来保持基本位点的作用。另一方面，使用基本NH3作为载体气体导致NH3分子中毒中间强酸位点，抑制活性并减少乳酸形成。这与Landis和Venuto之前的发现形成对比，表明气体相反应中载体气体组成与催化性能之间的复杂相互作用。
