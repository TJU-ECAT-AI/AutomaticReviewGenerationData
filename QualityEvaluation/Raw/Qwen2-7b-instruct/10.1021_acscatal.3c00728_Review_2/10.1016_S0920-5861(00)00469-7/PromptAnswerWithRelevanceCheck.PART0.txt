The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional dispersion of active boron sites on the catalyst surface. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including higher active site density, which leads to enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed sites have attracted significant research interest because they can significantly improve the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP reaction. The specific advantages include increased contact between the active sites and the reactants, which facilitates faster and more effective hydrogenation processes. Additionally, the flat structure of 2-D sites allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, contributing to improved overall catalytic activity.

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional array of active sites, as opposed to a linear dispersion along the edges of the catalyst particles. These 2-D dispersed sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including a higher density of active sites per unit volume of the catalyst. This leads to enhanced catalytic performance, typically manifested as higher conversion rates and/or selectivities for the desired products. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed sites have attracted significant research interest because they can potentially enable more efficient and selective chemical transformations, thereby improving the economics and environmental impact of industrial processes.

The specific advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites include:

1. Increased Active Site Density: By arranging active sites in a two-dimensional pattern, the total number of available sites for reaction increases significantly compared to linear arrangements. This can lead to higher overall reaction rates and improved product yields.

2. Enhanced Selectivity: The precise control over the spatial arrangement of active sites can lead to more selective catalysis. In some cases, this might involve directing reactions towards specific pathways or products, reducing unwanted side reactions.

3. Improved Reaction Kinetics: The geometry of 2-D structures can facilitate more efficient access to active sites by reactants, potentially leading to faster reaction rates.

4. Better Control Over Catalyst Properties: The design of 2-D structures allows for precise manipulation of properties such as surface area, pore size, and accessibility, which can be tuned to optimize catalytic activity and stability.

5. Reduced Agglomeration: Two-dimensional structures might exhibit better dispersion and stability under operating conditions, reducing the risk of agglomeration and loss of activity.

These factors have led to extensive research efforts aimed at developing new methods for the synthesis of 2-D dispersed active sites, exploring their fundamental properties, and applying them to a variety of catalytic processes, including the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The remarkable effect of CO2 as the carrier gas in enhancing both the lactam selectivity and the catalyst stability agrees qualitatively with the literature. This suggests that CO2 molecules function to keep basic sites from intervening into the reaction, possibly by neutralizing or preventing the formation of unfavorable intermediates. The use of basic NH3 as the carrier gas, on the other hand, results in a poisoning of the intermediate strong acid sites by NH3 molecules, which suppresses reactivity and diminishes lactam formation. This contrasts with previous findings by Landis and Venuto, indicating the complex interplay between carrier gas composition and catalytic performance in gas-phase reactions.

在氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）反应中，硼基催化剂上二维分散活性位点的发展涉及到在催化剂粒子边缘形成线性排列的活性位点。与线性排列的边部位点相比，二维分散位点提供了几个优势，包括单位体积催化剂中的活性位点密度更高。这通常导致增强的催化性能，表现为更高的转化率和/或所需产物的选择性。由于独特的结构特征，二维分散位点引起了研究界的广泛关注，因为它们有可能使化学转换更加高效和选择性，从而改善工业过程的经济性和环境影响。

2-D分散位点的具体优势包括：

1. 增加活性位点密度：通过以二维图案排列活性位点，单位体积中的可用位点数量显著增加，这可能导致更高的总体反应速率和产品收率。

2. 提高选择性：精确控制活性位点的空间排列可以实现更选择性的催化作用。在某些情况下，这可能涉及引导反应朝特定路径或产品进行，减少不希望的副反应。

3. 改进反应动力学：2-D结构的几何形状可能有助于更有效地使反应物接近活性位点，从而导致更快的反应速率。

4. 更好的催化剂性质控制：设计2-D结构允许对表面面积、孔径大小和可访问性等属性进行精细调整，这些属性可以被调整以优化催化活性和稳定性。

5. 减少聚集：二维结构可能表现出更好的分散性和稳定性，在运行条件下减少了聚集和活性丧失的风险。

这些因素导致了广泛的研究努力，旨在开发新的方法来合成2-D分散活性位点，探索它们的基本性质，并将它们应用于各种催化过程，包括氧化丙烷脱氢。

CO2作为载体气体增强乳酸选择性和催化剂稳定性的显着效果与文献一致。这表明CO2分子通过中和或防止形成不利中间体来保持基本位点的作用。另一方面，使用基本NH3作为载体气体导致NH3分子中毒中间强酸位点，抑制活性并减少乳酸形成。这与Landis和Venuto之前的发现形成对比，表明气体相反应中载体气体组成与催化性能之间的复杂相互作用。

[1] "The present results indicate that the temperatures of support pre-calcination and of the catalyst activation are important preparation parameters that affecting the catalytic property of B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst. The lactam yield increases with PCT and gives the maximum numbers with PCT=350500C when the CAT is limited no higher than 500C."
[2] "The lactam yield increases with PCT and gives the maximum numbers with PCT=350500C when the CAT is limited no higher than 500C."
[3] "Another reason for the lower lactam yield using the lower PCTs may be related to the crystal phases and texture of the 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts."
[4] "This is supported by the effect of boria load on the Beckmann reaction ( Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 )."
[5] "Detailed effects of PCT and CAT on the surface area and pore structure based on nitrogen adsorption measurements are the focus of another report [26]."
[6] "The optimum boria load (10%) of the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 catalyst is connected with its highest density of intermediate strong acid sites which seem related with the dispersion structure of the boria overlayers [14] ,[15] ."

The study found that the temperatures of support pre-calcination and catalyst activation significantly impact the catalytic properties of B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts. Specifically, the lactam yield increases with the pre-calcination temperature (PCT) and reaches its peak at temperatures between 350°C and 500°C when the activation temperature (CAT) is limited to no more than 500°C. Lowering the PCTs may result in reduced lactam yield due to lower catalytic contribution from the bare-support surface and possibly altered crystal phases and textures of the catalysts. The optimum boria load of 10% for the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 catalyst correlates with its highest density of intermediate strong acid sites, suggesting a connection to the dispersion structure of the boria overlayers. The study also notes that detailed effects of PCT and CAT on the surface area and pore structure require further investigation.

研究发现，支持预煅烧温度和支持催化剂激活温度对B2O3/ZrO2催化剂的催化性能有重要影响。乳酸产量随着预煅烧温度（PCT）的增加而提高，并在PCT为350°C至500°C时达到最大值，当激活温度（CAT）限制在不超过500°C时。降低PCT可能导致乳酸产量降低，原因可能包括裸露支持表面的催化贡献减少以及催化剂晶体结构和纹理的改变。B2O3/ZrO2-500-350催化剂中10%的硼酸负载与其中间强酸位点的最高密度相关，这似乎与硼酸层分布结构有关。研究还指出，需要进一步探讨PCT和CAT对表面积和孔结构的详细影响。

The optimization of the catalyst preparation for the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime involves controlling the temperatures of support pre-calcination and catalyst activation. These parameters significantly impact the catalytic properties of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst. Proper selection of reaction solvents and carrier gases also enhances the lactam synthesis. The lactam yield is maximized when the pre-calcination temperature ranges between 350 and 500°C, provided the catalyst activation temperature is limited to no higher than 500°C. Beyond this limit, the effect of pre-calcination temperature on lactam yield becomes negligible. The optimal boria load is crucial, with the best performance observed when the catalyst has about two boria overlayers on the support. Combining appropriate solvents and carrier gases can optimize the reaction atmosphere for improving lactam selectivity and minimizing catalyst deactivation.

4. High micropore content in supports with lower pre-calcination temperatures leads to boria dispersion outside the pores, resulting in a conversion of the reactant to unwanted byproducts.
5. Lower lactam yields are observed with catalysts prepared at higher temperatures (700°C) due to reduced activity in oxime conversion.
6. About two layers of boron oxide are typically needed for optimal catalytic activity in B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts.
7. Using carbon dioxide as the carrier gas enhances both lactam selectivity and catalyst stability, aligning with previous studies.
8. Ammonia as a carrier gas reduces the reactivity of the oxime and lactam formation, differing from findings in related literature.
