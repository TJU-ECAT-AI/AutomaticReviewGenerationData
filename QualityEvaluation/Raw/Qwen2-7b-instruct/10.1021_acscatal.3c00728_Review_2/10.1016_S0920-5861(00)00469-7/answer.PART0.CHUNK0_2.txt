[1] "The present results indicate that the temperatures of support pre-calcination and of the catalyst activation are important preparation parameters that affecting the catalytic property of B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst. The lactam yield increases with PCT and gives the maximum numbers with PCT=350500C when the CAT is limited no higher than 500C."
[2] "The lactam yield increases with PCT and gives the maximum numbers with PCT=350500C when the CAT is limited no higher than 500C."
[3] "Another reason for the lower lactam yield using the lower PCTs may be related to the crystal phases and texture of the 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts."
[4] "This is supported by the effect of boria load on the Beckmann reaction ( Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 )."
[5] "Detailed effects of PCT and CAT on the surface area and pore structure based on nitrogen adsorption measurements are the focus of another report [26]."
[6] "The optimum boria load (10%) of the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 catalyst is connected with its highest density of intermediate strong acid sites which seem related with the dispersion structure of the boria overlayers [14] ,[15] ."

The study found that the temperatures of support pre-calcination and catalyst activation significantly impact the catalytic properties of B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts. Specifically, the lactam yield increases with the pre-calcination temperature (PCT) and reaches its peak at temperatures between 350°C and 500°C when the activation temperature (CAT) is limited to no more than 500°C. Lowering the PCTs may result in reduced lactam yield due to lower catalytic contribution from the bare-support surface and possibly altered crystal phases and textures of the catalysts. The optimum boria load of 10% for the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 catalyst correlates with its highest density of intermediate strong acid sites, suggesting a connection to the dispersion structure of the boria overlayers. The study also notes that detailed effects of PCT and CAT on the surface area and pore structure require further investigation.

研究发现，支持预煅烧温度和支持催化剂激活温度对B2O3/ZrO2催化剂的催化性能有重要影响。乳酸产量随着预煅烧温度（PCT）的增加而提高，并在PCT为350°C至500°C时达到最大值，当激活温度（CAT）限制在不超过500°C时。降低PCT可能导致乳酸产量降低，原因可能包括裸露支持表面的催化贡献减少以及催化剂晶体结构和纹理的改变。B2O3/ZrO2-500-350催化剂中10%的硼酸负载与其中间强酸位点的最高密度相关，这似乎与硼酸层分布结构有关。研究还指出，需要进一步探讨PCT和CAT对表面积和孔结构的详细影响。
