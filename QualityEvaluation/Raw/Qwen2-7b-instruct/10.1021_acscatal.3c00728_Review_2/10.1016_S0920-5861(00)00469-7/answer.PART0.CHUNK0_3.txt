[1] "The present results indicate that the temperatures of support pre-calcination and of the catalyst activation are important preparation parameters that affecting the catalytic property of B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst."
[2] "A remarkable benefit for the lactam synthesis is observed with proper combination of the solvents and carrier gases."
[3] "The lactam yield increases with PCT and gives the maximum numbers with PCT=350500C when the CAT is limited no higher than 500C."
[4] "This effect of PCT seems not important for the catalyst preparation when the late catalyst activation is set at CAT=600C."
[5] "Another part of this work focused on effects of the reaction solvents and carrier gases."
[6] "The optimum boria load (10%) of the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 catalyst is connected with its highest density of intermediate strong acid sites which seem related with the dispersion structure of the boria overlayers."
[7] "For the B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 samples, the higher optimum boria load (ca. 12%) is consistent with the higher catalyst surface of the specified preparations."

The optimization of the catalyst preparation for the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime involves controlling the temperatures of support pre-calcination and catalyst activation. These parameters significantly impact the catalytic properties of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst. Proper selection of reaction solvents and carrier gases also enhances the lactam synthesis. The lactam yield is maximized when the pre-calcination temperature ranges between 350 and 500°C, provided the catalyst activation temperature is limited to no higher than 500°C. Beyond this limit, the effect of pre-calcination temperature on lactam yield becomes negligible. The optimal boria load is crucial, with the best performance observed when the catalyst has about two boria overlayers on the support. Combining appropriate solvents and carrier gases can optimize the reaction atmosphere for improving lactam selectivity and minimizing catalyst deactivation.

催化剂制备的优化对于环己酮肟贝克曼重排具有重要意义，涉及控制支撑物预煅烧温度和催化剂活化温度。这些参数显著影响B2O3/ZrO2催化剂的催化性能。正确选择反应溶剂和载体气体也有助于提高乳酸合成。乳酸产量在预煅烧温度为350至500°C范围内达到最大值，前提是催化剂活化温度不超过500°C。超过这个限制，预煅烧温度对乳酸产量的影响变得不那么重要。最优的硼酸负载至关重要，当催化剂具有大约两层硼酸覆盖层时，表现出最佳性能。结合适当的溶剂和载体气体可以优化反应气氛，从而提高乳酸选择性和减少催化剂失活。
