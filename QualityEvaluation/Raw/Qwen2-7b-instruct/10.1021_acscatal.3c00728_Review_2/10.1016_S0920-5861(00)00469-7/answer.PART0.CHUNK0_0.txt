[1] "In the present study, we report some key factors of catalyst preparation that affect the catalysis efficiency of B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst for the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime."
[2] "The property of zirconia-supported catalyst is subject to the preparation methods. Temperature (calcination) histories of the support and the supported catalyst could be decisive for catalyst-support interaction."
[3] "As shown in Fig. 7, the influence of the borial load on the surface area and porosity of the B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 samples is exactly the same as for the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 ones."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves creating a two-dimensional dispersion of active boron sites on the catalyst surface. These sites offer several advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including higher active site density, which leads to enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of 2-D dispersed sites have attracted significant research interest because they can significantly improve the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP reaction. The specific advantages include increased contact between the active sites and the reactants, which facilitates faster and more effective hydrogenation processes. Additionally, the flat structure of 2-D sites allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, contributing to improved overall catalytic activity.
