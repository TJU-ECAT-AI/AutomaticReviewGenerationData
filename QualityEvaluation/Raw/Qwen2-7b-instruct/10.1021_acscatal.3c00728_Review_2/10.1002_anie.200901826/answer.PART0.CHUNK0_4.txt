The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) involves modifying carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with boron oxide. These sites are advantageous because they offer higher active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, leading to improved catalytic performance. The unique structural features, such as the 2-D dispersion, attract significant research interest due to their potential in enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the ODHP reaction.

The specific advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites over linearly dispersed edge sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction include:

1. **Increased Active Site Density**: The 2-D dispersion of boron oxide on the surface of CNTs leads to a higher concentration of active sites, which enhances the reaction rate and selectivity of propene formation.
   
2. **Optimized Reaction Pathways**: The presence of boron oxide modifies the surface properties of CNTs, creating a favorable environment for the activation of propane molecules to form propene selectively, rather than undergoing complete combustion.

3. **Selective Oxygen Species Formation**: By suppressing the formation of non-selective oxygen species, the 2-D dispersed active sites contribute to a higher propene selectivity during the ODHP reaction.

4. **Stability and Sustainability**: The modified CNTs remain stable under reaction conditions, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional metal oxides for alkane conversion, which aligns with the growing demand for environmentally friendly catalytic technologies.

These unique structural features have attracted significant research interest in the field due to their potential in improving the efficiency and sustainability of the ODHP process, particularly in the production of propene from propane. The ability to synthesize more optimized catalysts with increased active sites while maintaining high selectivity demonstrates promising advancements in the development of boron-based catalysts for alkane conversion.

在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应中，通过在碳纳米管（CNT）上引入硼氧化物来开发2-D分散活性位点。这些位点的优势在于与线性分散边缘位点相比，它们提供了更高的活性位点密度，从而提高了催化性能。这些独特的结构特征吸引大量研究兴趣，主要是因为它们有可能增强ODHP反应的选择性和效率。

2-D分散活性位点相对于硼基催化剂中线性分散边缘位点在ODHP反应中的特定优势包括：

1. **增加活性位点密度**：2-D分散的硼氧化物在CNT表面的存在导致活性位点的高浓度，这可以提高反应速率和丙烯选择性。

2. **优化反应途径**：硼氧化物的引入修改了CNT的表面性质，为丙烷分子的激活提供了一个有利的环境，使其能够选择性地形成丙烯，而不是完全燃烧。

3. **选择性氧物种形成**：通过抑制非选择性氧物种的形成，2-D分散的活性位点有助于提高丙烯选择性期间的ODHP反应。

4. **稳定性和可持续性**：经过修改的CNT在反应条件下保持稳定，提供了一种比传统金属氧化物更可持续的替代品，用于烷烃转换，这符合环保催化技术的需求。

这些独特的结构特征吸引了大量研究兴趣，主要是因为它们有可能改进ODHP过程的效率和可持续性，特别是在从丙烷生产丙烯时。能够合成更多优化的催化剂，同时保持高选择性，显示了在开发硼基催化剂方面取得的有前景的进步，用于烷烃转换。
