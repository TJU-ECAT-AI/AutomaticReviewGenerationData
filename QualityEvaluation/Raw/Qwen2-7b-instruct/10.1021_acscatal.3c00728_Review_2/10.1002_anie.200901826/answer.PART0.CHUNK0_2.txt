[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with remarkable selectivity. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modified by boron oxide catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with remarkable selectivity."
[3] "Such a pronounced enhancement can be related to the improved chemical stability after modification."
[4] "Pristine and modified CNTs have a similar activity and selectivity in the steady state, and also similar apparent activation energies of propane conversion, oxygen conversion, and propene formation."
[5] "The majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs."
[6] "Boroxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."
[7] "Vanadia catalysts, the most selective metal-based catalysts, can work well at a low partial pressure of oxygen owing to suppression of consecutive propene combustion."

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction involves modifying carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with boron oxide. This modification enhances the chemical stability of the catalyst, leading to remarkable selectivity in converting propane to propene. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, the 2-D dispersed sites offer higher active site density, contributing to improved catalytic performance. This unique structural feature is of significant interest because it enables efficient activation of propane molecules through surface oxygen groups, resulting in the selective formation of propene with minimal formation of unwanted byproducts. The enhanced stability and selectivity of boron-modified CNT catalysts make them an attractive alternative for alkane conversion processes, offering sustainable technology for alkane conversion.

在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中，硼基催化剂通过将碳纳米管（CNT）改性为硼氧化物来发展二维分散活性位点。这种修改提高了催化剂的化学稳定性，从而实现了对丙烷到丙烯的显著选择性转化。与线性分布的边缘位点相比，二维分散的位点提供了更高的活性位点密度，从而提高了催化性能。这种独特的结构特征引起了极大的研究兴趣，因为它允许通过表面氧基团有效地激活丙烷分子，从而选择性地形成丙烯，同时最小化副产品的生成。硼改性CNT催化剂的增强稳定性和选择性使其成为烷烃转化过程的有吸引力的替代方案，提供了一种可持续的烷烃转化技术。
