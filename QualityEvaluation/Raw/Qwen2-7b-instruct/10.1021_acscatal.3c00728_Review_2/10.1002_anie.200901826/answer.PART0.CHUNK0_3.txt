1. 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) are developed through the modification of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with boron oxide. This process enhances the selectivity of the ODHP reaction, offering specific advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these sites, characterized by their 2-D dispersion, have attracted significant research interest because they enable a more efficient and selective conversion of propane to propene. The boron oxide modification helps in blocking or covering combustion sites on the surface, leading to a reduction in non-selective active sites and an improvement in the overall selectivity towards propene formation.

2. Boron-based catalysts offer several advantages over traditional metal oxide catalysts for the ODHP reaction. Firstly, they provide a sustainable technology for alkane conversion, as carbon nanotubes can be an attractive alternative to conventional metal oxides. Secondly, they enable a feasible investigation of the reaction mechanism due to the unique properties of nanocarbon materials. Thirdly, boron oxide modification leads to a higher activation energy for oxygen conversion, which contributes to the enhanced selectivity towards propene. Additionally, these catalysts have shown superior stability and selectivity compared to supported vanadia catalysts, making them promising candidates for industrial applications.

3. The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction has attracted significant research interest primarily because of their ability to enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the conversion process. These sites are more densely packed than linearly dispersed edge sites, which results in a higher concentration of active sites on the catalyst surface. This higher density of active sites facilitates a more efficient utilization of reactants and leads to improved catalytic performance. Furthermore, the unique structural features of 2-D dispersed sites contribute to a better control over the reaction pathways, promoting the desired propene formation while minimizing unwanted side reactions, such as the total combustion of propane to COx. The combination of enhanced selectivity and efficiency makes these catalysts particularly appealing for industrial applications where the selective production of propene is crucial.
