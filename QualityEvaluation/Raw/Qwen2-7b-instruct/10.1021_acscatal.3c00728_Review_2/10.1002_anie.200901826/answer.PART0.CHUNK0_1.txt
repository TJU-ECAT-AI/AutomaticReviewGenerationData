[1] "Nanocarbon can be an attractive alternative to conventional metal oxides, as it enables a feasible investigation of the reaction mechanism and provides a sustainable technology for alkane conversion."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with remarkable selectivity. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modified by boron oxide catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with remarkable selectivity."
[3] "Such a pronounced enhancement can be related to the improved chemical stability after modification."
[4] "The modified CNTs are much more selective than a variety of supported vanadia catalysts."
[5] "One of the remaining drawbacks is the low overall activity of carbon catalysts, which can be overcome by fabricating a high concentration of selective sites on the surface."

1. Boron-based catalysts are developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) through modifying carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with boron oxide. This development offers specific advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, including increased active site density and enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D dispersed active sites attract significant research interest because they can significantly improve the selectivity and efficiency of the ODHP reaction, leading to more sustainable alkane conversion technologies.
