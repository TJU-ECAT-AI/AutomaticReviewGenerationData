[1] "More than 90 % of its world production is obtained by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB)."
[2] "Due to the highly endothermic and volume increasing character of the reaction, a large amount of superheated steam is required to supply heat, lower the partial pressure of the reactant, thus shifting the chemical equilibrium to higher styrene formation."
[3] "This process, if developed is believed to be an energy-saving and environmentally friendly process."
[4] "It is well known that in the present commercial iron catalyst, hematite (α-Fe2O3) is preferred for styrene production."
[5] "Compared to Fe-Cr-Si-30 and Fe-Cr- Ti-30 catalysts, Fe-Cr-Al-30 was found to be the most active (conversion = 57.2 %) and the most selective in styrene (94.1 %)."
[6] "The activity value was observed in the following order Fe-Cr-Al > Fe-Cr-Ti.> Fe-Cr-Si."
[7] "The variation of Fe-Cr content in the Fe-Cr-Al catalysts showed that the activity depends strongly on the content."
[8] "The optimal content determined was 50 wt- %."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with carbon dioxide over supported iron-chromium mixed oxides catalysts shows that the presence of aluminum as a dopant in the catalyst leads to higher activity and selectivity in styrene production. The activity of the catalysts depends strongly on the iron-chromium content, with the optimal content being 50 wt-%. The electronic structure of the catalyst is crucial for its performance, and the balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems is a key challenge. The use of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant in the process also contributes to carbon removal, enhancing the environmental friendliness of the process.
