The study investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene over Fe-Cr mixed oxide catalysts supported on different supports. The catalysts were prepared using the wet impregnation method. The effect of the support type and Fe-Cr loading on the catalyst performance was explored. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to characterize the catalysts. The dehydrogenation was conducted in a flow fixed bed reactor under atmospheric pressure. The XRD results showed that the mixed oxides had slight variations compared to unsupported binary oxides, suggesting some dispersion of iron and chromium ions into the support matrix. FTIR analysis provided insights into the metal-oxygen bonding changes. The catalyst activity decreased over time, possibly due to sintering rather than carbon deposition. SEM images confirmed no significant carbon deposits on the spent catalyst. The study concluded that Fe-Cr-Al catalysts were suitable for dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in the presence of CO2, with the activity and selectivity influenced by the Fe-Cr content.

The catalysts' electronic structure, influenced by preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation, affects their catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these systems include understanding the precise role of each parameter on the electronic structure and catalytic activity, optimizing the reaction conditions for maximum efficiency and selectivity, and ensuring the safety of the process to prevent hazards such as the formation of unwanted byproducts or excessive energy consumption.

研究了铁铬混合氧化物催化剂在不同支撑材料上对乙苯氧化脱氢制乙烯和乙烷氧化脱氢制乙炔的催化性能。催化剂采用湿浸渍法制备。探索了支撑类型和Fe-Cr负载对催化剂性能的影响。通过X射线衍射(XRD)和傅里叶变换红外光谱(FTIR)对催化剂进行了表征。在大气压下使用流动固定床反应器进行脱氢。XRD结果显示，混合氧化物与未支持的二元氧化物相比略有差异，表明铁和铬离子在支撑矩阵中分散。FTIR分析提供了金属-氧键变化的见解。催化剂活性随时间逐渐下降，可能主要是由于烧结而非碳沉积导致。扫描电子显微镜图像证实了耗尽催化剂上没有显著的碳沉积。研究结论指出，在二氧化碳存在的条件下，Fe-Cr-Al催化剂适合于乙苯的脱氢，催化剂的活性和选择性受到Fe-Cr含量的影响。

催化剂的电子结构受到制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成的影响，进而影响其在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。在理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性等方面的关键挑战包括理解每个参数如何精确影响电子结构和催化活性、优化反应条件以实现最大效率和选择性以及确保过程安全以防止诸如生成副产品过多或能量消耗过高等危害。
