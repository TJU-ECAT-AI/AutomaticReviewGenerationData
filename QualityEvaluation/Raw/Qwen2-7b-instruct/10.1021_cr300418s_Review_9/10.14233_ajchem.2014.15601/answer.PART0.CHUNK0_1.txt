INTRODUCTION
"Styrene is one of the most important monomer for synthetic polymers."
"Catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, IR and SEM."
"The activity value was observed in the following order Fe-Cr-Al > Fe-Cr-Ti.> Fe-Cr-Si."
"Compared to Fe-Cr-Si and Fe-Cr-Ti, Fe-Cr-Al is the suitable phase for the dehydrogenation of EB with CO2."
"Characterization of the spent Fe-Cr-Al catalyst indicated that that there are no significant carbonaceous deposits on the spent Fe-Cr-Al-30 catalyst."

This study focuses on the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) using binary iron-chromium oxide catalysts supported on various supports. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The research highlights that Fe-Cr-Al catalysts are particularly effective for EB dehydrogenation with CO2, showing high conversion and selectivity to styrene. The characterization of the spent catalyst revealed minimal carbon deposition, suggesting that the deactivation mechanism differs from other catalyst systems. The order of catalytic activity for the Fe-Cr-Al catalysts is Fe-Cr-Al > Fe-Cr-Ti > Fe-Cr-Si.

本文研究了在二氧化碳（CO2）存在下使用铁铬氧化物二元催化剂对乙基苯乙烯（EB）的脱氢反应。通过X射线衍射（XRD）、傅里叶变换红外光谱（FT-IR）和扫描电子显微镜（SEM）对催化剂进行了表征。研究结果表明，Fe-Cr-Al催化剂特别适用于EB与CO2的脱氢反应，并表现出高转化率和高苯乙烯选择性。对耗尽催化剂的表征显示碳沉积极少，暗示其失活机制与其他催化剂系统不同。Fe-Cr-Al催化剂的活性顺序为：Fe-Cr-Al > Fe-Cr-Ti > Fe-Cr-Si。
