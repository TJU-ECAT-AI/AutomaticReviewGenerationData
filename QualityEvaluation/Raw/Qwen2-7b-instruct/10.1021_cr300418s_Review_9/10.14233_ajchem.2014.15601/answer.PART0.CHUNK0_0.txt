INTRODUCTION
"Styrene is one of the most important monomer for synthetic polymers."
"Catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, IR and SEM."
"Compared to Fe-Cr-Si-30 and Fe-Cr- Ti-30 catalysts, Fe-Cr-Al-30 was found to be the most active (conversion = 57.2 %) and the most selective in styrene (94.1 %)."
"SEM images indicated that there are no significant carbonaceous deposits on the spent Fe-Cr-Al-30 catalyst, whereas modifications of its morphological aspect were observed."
"The activity value was observed in the following order Fe-Cr-Al > Fe-Cr-Ti.> Fe-Cr-Si."
"Characterization of the spent Fe-Cr-Al catalyst indicated that that there are no significant carbonaceous deposits on the spent Fe-Cr-Al-30 catalyst, whereas modifications of its morphological aspect were observed."
"Consequently various supports such as Al2O3, MgO, WO3, SiO2, ZrO2 and activated carbon have been tested on the dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of CO2 20-30."

This study investigates the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) using a series of binary iron-chromium oxides (Fe2O3-Cr2O3) supported on alumina, silica, and titania. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicate that Fe-Cr-Al-30 is the most active and selective catalyst for styrene production, with a conversion of 57.2% and a selectivity of 94.1%. SEM analysis shows no significant carbon deposits on the spent Fe-Cr-Al-30 catalyst, suggesting that deactivation is not primarily due to coke formation. Various supports, including Al2O3, MgO, WO3, SiO2, ZrO2, and activated carbon, have been tested for EB dehydrogenation in CO2, but the results vary significantly depending on the support used.

本研究采用铁铬氧化物（Fe2O3-Cr2O3）二元氧化物，支持在氧化铝、硅胶和二氧化钛上，探讨乙苯（EB）在二氧化碳（CO2）存在的条件下进行脱氢反应。通过X射线衍射（XRD）、红外光谱（IR）和扫描电子显微镜（SEM）对催化剂进行了表征。结果显示，Fe-Cr-Al-30是最活跃且选择性最好的催化剂，其转化率为57.2%，对苯乙烯的选择性为94.1%。SEM分析表明，使用过Fe-Cr-Al-30催化剂后没有明显的碳沉积物，这说明催化剂失活的主要原因可能不是焦炭形成。各种支持物，包括氧化铝、镁氧化物、钨氧化物、二氧化硅、锆氧化物和活性炭，都已被测试用于EB在CO2中的脱氢反应，但结果因所用支持物的不同而变化显著。

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
"XRD results indicated that the mixed oxides have slightly different values than the unsupported binary oxides depending on the support."
"Compared with the unsupported α-Fe2O3/Cr2O3 mixed oxides, the supported ones showed almost the same features in their FT-IR spectra."
"Change in the activity of catalyst with time on stream: The dehydrogenation of EB was performed in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant over the supported Fe-Cr oxide catalysts."
"The evolution of the yield with time on stream for all these catalysts showed that they form the cracking products with almost the same yield."
"SEM measurements. The morphological aspects of fresh and spent catalysts were evidenced by SEM images."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
X-ray diffraction results showed that the mixed oxides have slight differences from the unsupported binary oxides, depending on the support used. The supported mixed oxides displayed similar features in their Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra compared to the unsupported α-Fe2O3/Cr2O3 mixtures. The catalyst activity changed over time during the dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant. All catalysts formed cracking products with nearly identical yields over time. SEM measurements revealed the morphological changes of both fresh and spent catalysts through SEM images.
