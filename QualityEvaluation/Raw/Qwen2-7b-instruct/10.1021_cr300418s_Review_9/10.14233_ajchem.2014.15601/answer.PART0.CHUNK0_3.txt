INTRODUCTION
"Styrene is one of the most important monomer for synthetic polymers."
"Catalysts were prepared by the wet impregnation method."
"The effect of the support and Fe-Cr loading on the support was explored."
"Characterization of the spent Fe-Cr-Al catalyst indicated that that there are no significant carbonaceous deposits on the spent Fe-Cr-Al-30 catalyst, whereas modifications of its morphological aspect were observed."
"Compared to Fe-Cr-Si and Fe-Cr-Ti, Fe-Cr-Al is the suitable phase for the dehydrogenation of EB with CO2."
"Characterization of the spent Fe-Cr-Al catalyst indicated that that there are no significant carbonaceous deposits on the spent Fe-Cr-Al-30 catalyst, whereas modifications of its morphological aspect were observed."
"Ethylbenzene conversion initially increased from 31.93-95.38 % when Fe-Cr content increased from 10 to 70 %. Up to 70 % the EB conversion remained unchanged."
"The optimal loading of the catalyst was determined to be 50 %."

The introduction highlights the importance of styrene in synthetic polymers, the preparation method used for catalysts, and the exploration of how different supports and Fe-Cr loading affect the catalyst's performance. It also mentions the lack of significant carbon deposits on the spent catalyst and the finding that Fe-Cr-Al is the most suitable phase for dehydrogenating ethylbenzene (EB) with CO2. The introduction further discusses the relationship between Fe-Cr content and EB conversion, concluding that the optimal loading is 50%.
