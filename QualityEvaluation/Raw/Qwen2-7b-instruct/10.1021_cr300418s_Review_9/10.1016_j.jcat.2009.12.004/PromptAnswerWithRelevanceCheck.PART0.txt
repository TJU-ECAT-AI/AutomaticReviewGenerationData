[1] "The present systematic study of a series of Ni-based mixed oxides with doping metals varying from low (+1) to high valence (+5) elements clearly demonstrates the large effect of the dopant in both the physicochemical properties and the catalytic behavior of NiMeO mixed oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "The introduction of dopants in the NiO structure modifies, as in the case of the O2-TPD experiments, both the quantity and mobility of the exchanged oxygen species."
[3] "Quantitative results of the temperature-programmed 18O2 isotope exchange experiments are shown in Table 2. Indeed, the total amount of the oxides exchangeable oxygen species (estimated from the integration of the TPIE 16O response curves, expressed as the sum of 16O in 16O18O and 16O2) depends greatly on the valence of the doping metal."
[4] "Therefore, an important outcome of this work is that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, according to the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."

[2] "The dopants (Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb) easily insert the NiO lattice and form solid solutions, independent of the valence of the foreign species and given a similar ionic radius to Ni2+."
[3] "Results obtained via the temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange are consistent with the principle of controlled valence and clearly confirm that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor."
[4] "Not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species is affected by the presence of the different dopants, with high valence dopants resulting in more strongly bonded oxygen species."
[5] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."
[6] "The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above."
[7] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."

5. A linear relationship between the surface rate of oxygen exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of ethane consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms the active role of the monitored oxygen species in the ethane activation mechanism.
6. There is a clear inverse relationship between the amount of non-stoichiometric oxygen that the catalysts carry and their ability to selectively convert ethane substrates to ethylene, with this relationship being stronger as the valence of the foreign cation increases.
7. The higher the valence of the dopant cations, the higher the initial selectivity towards the desired product, with NiNb having the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%).
