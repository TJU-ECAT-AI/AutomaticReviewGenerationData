[1] "In this work, we investigate the effect of other than Nb non-reducible metals on the properties and catalytic behavior of Ni MeO mixed metal oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "The key for a viable industrial application of this process is the development of a highly active and selective catalytic material, able to activate and convert the relatively inert alkane to olefin at low temperature, and at the same time minimize the parallel and consecutive side reactions of both the alkane and the alkene to carbon oxides."
[3] "The synthesis and investigation of bulk NiNbO mixed oxides by our group led to the development of low temperature, highly active and selective materials for ethane ODH that exhibit one of the best catalytic performances compared to most catalysts reported in open literature."
[4] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."
[5] "An important outcome of this work is that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, according to the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."

1. This study examines the impact of non-niobium non-reducible metals on the properties and catalytic performance of nickel-based mixed metal oxides in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.
2. The main challenge in these catalytic systems is to develop highly active and selective materials capable of activating and converting relatively inert alkanes to olefins at low temperatures, while minimizing side reactions.
3. Our team's synthesis of bulk NiNbO mixed oxides resulted in the creation of low-temperature, highly active, and selective catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, demonstrating exceptional catalytic performance compared to other catalysts in the literature.
4. As the valence of the dopant increases, the initial selectivity towards the desired product also increases. NiNbO shows the highest selectivity (90%), while NiLiO shows the lowest (19%).
5. A significant finding is that the catalytic properties of nickel oxide in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation can be adjusted through doping, depending on the nature of the dopant in metal-promoted nickel oxide catalysts.
