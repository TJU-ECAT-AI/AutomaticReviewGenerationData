[1] "The present systematic study of a series of Ni-based mixed oxides with doping metals varying from low (+1) to high valence (+5) elements clearly demonstrates the large effect of the dopant in both the physicochemical properties and the catalytic behavior of NiMeO mixed oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "The introduction of dopants in the NiO structure modifies, as in the case of the O2-TPD experiments, both the quantity and mobility of the exchanged oxygen species."
[3] "Quantitative results of the temperature-programmed 18O2 isotope exchange experiments are shown in Table 2. Indeed, the total amount of the oxides exchangeable oxygen species (estimated from the integration of the TPIE 16O response curves, expressed as the sum of 16O in 16O18O and 16O2) depends greatly on the valence of the doping metal."
[4] "Therefore, an important outcome of this work is that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, according to the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."

1. The study of Ni-based mixed oxides with doping metals from low to high valence elements shows that doping significantly impacts both the physical and chemical properties, as well as the catalytic behavior of NiMeO mixed oxides during ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

2. The introduction of dopants in the NiO structure changes the quantity and mobility of exchanged oxygen species, similar to the effects observed in oxygen desorption experiments.

3. The total amount of exchangeable oxygen species on the catalysts, estimated from the integration of 16O response curves in isotope exchange experiments, largely depends on the valence of the doping metal.

4. An important finding is that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation can be adjusted through doping, based on the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts.
