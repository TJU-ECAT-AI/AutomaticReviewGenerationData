[1] "The present systematic study of a series of Ni-based mixed oxides with doping metals varying from low (+1) to high valence (+5) elements clearly demonstrates the large effect of the dopant in both the physicochemical properties and the catalytic behavior of NiMeO mixed oxides in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "The dopants (Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb) easily insert the NiO lattice and form solid solutions, independent of the valence of the foreign species and given a similar ionic radius to Ni2+."
[3] "Results obtained via the temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen and temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange are consistent with the principle of controlled valence and clearly confirm that the dissolution of lower/equal to nickel valence cations (Li1+, Mg2+) increases the non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while the higher valence cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Ti4+ Nb5+, Ta5+) act as electron donors and reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and consequently the electrophilic O radicals of the NiO acceptor."
[4] "Not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species is affected by the presence of the different dopants, with high valence dopants resulting in more strongly bonded oxygen species."
[5] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."
[6] "The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above."
[7] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."

1. The systematic study shows that doping metals in Ni-based mixed oxides have a significant impact on both the physical and chemical properties, as well as the catalytic behavior in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.
2. The doping elements easily integrate into the NiO lattice and form solid solutions, irrespective of their valence and having a similar ionic radius to Ni2+.
3. The principles of controlled valence are confirmed by the results of temperature-programmed oxygen desorption and isotopic oxygen exchange, demonstrating that lower/equal to nickel valence cations increase non-stoichiometric oxygen in NiO, while higher valence cations reduce the positive p+ hole concentration and electrophilic oxygen radicals.
4. The presence of different dopants affects not only the quantity but also the mobility of the oxygen species, with high valence dopants leading to more strongly bound oxygen species.
5. A linear relationship between the surface rate of oxygen exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of ethane consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms the active role of the monitored oxygen species in the ethane activation mechanism.
6. There is a clear inverse relationship between the amount of non-stoichiometric oxygen that the catalysts carry and their ability to selectively convert ethane substrates to ethylene, with this relationship being stronger as the valence of the foreign cation increases.
7. The higher the valence of the dopant cations, the higher the initial selectivity towards the desired product, with NiNb having the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%).

1. 系统研究显示，镍基混合氧化物中的掺杂金属在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中对物理和化学性质以及催化行为具有显著影响。
2. 掺杂元素容易融入NiO晶格并形成固溶体，与它们的价态无关，并且具有与Ni2+类似的离子半径。
3. 通过温度程序化氧脱附和同位素氧交换的结果与控制价原则一致，证实了低于或等于镍价态的离子增加了NiO中的非化学计量氧，而高价位离子作为电子供体减少了正p+空穴浓度和NiO受体的亲电氧基团。
4. 不同掺杂剂的存在不仅影响氧物种的数量，也影响其活性，高价位掺杂剂导致更牢固结合的氧物种。
5. 在TPIE实验中氧气交换表面速率与ODH活性测试中乙烯消耗表面速率之间的线性关系确认了监测的氧气物种在乙烷激活机制中的积极作用。
6. 非化学计量氧量与催化剂能够选择性地将乙烷基质转化为乙烯的能力之间存在明显的反向关系，随着外层阳离子价态的增加，这种关系更强。
7. 氧化剂价态越高，初始选择性越高，NiNb的最高选择性（90%）和NiLi的最低选择性（19%）。
