[2] "Using the hybrid DFT HSE06 exchange-correlation functional as a benchmark, we show that doping the (110) surface with a single trivalent ion leads to formation of a localized MCe/ + OO• (M = the 3+ dopant), O hole state, confirming the description found with DFT+U."
[3] "We use DFT+U to investigate the energetics of dopant compensation through formation of the 2MCe +VO·· defect, that is, compensation of two dopants with an oxygen vacancy."
[4] "On the other hand, the Y3+ dopant, with an ionic radius close to that of Ce4+, shows a positive anion vacancy formation energy, as does La3+, which is larger than Ce4+ (J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 2010, 20, 135004)."
[5] "Trivalent dopants, such as La3+ and Eu3+, have been investigated (28, 32) and give an improved rate of conversion of CO to CO2. However, this appears to happen only up to a certain concentration, of around 20%, of the dopant."
[6] "Our results show that each dopant forms a localized oxygen hole on one or two oxygen atoms neighboring the dopant."
[7] "In our previous work, (43, 45) we suggested that the results for La-doped CeO2 can be best understood by considering the nature of the host oxide: cerium is more easily reduced compared with the cations above, and formation of an oxygen vacancy resulting in formation of reduced Ce3+ is quite favorable."
[8] "However, Al3+ as a trivalent dopant in CeO2 appears to be an exception in that its defect chemistry leads to spontaneous compensation of the oxygen holes."
[9] "We attribute this to the smaller ionic radius of Al3+ compared with that of Ce4+ (and the other cation dopants considered), which leads to the strongest distortions around the dopant site."
[10] "In any case, experimental investigations of these systems to establish their stable defects are suggested."

1. 在CeO2(110)表面掺杂三价离子时，掺杂离子的离子半径起着关键作用。

2. 单个三价离子的掺杂会导致形成局部化的MCe/ + OO•状态，这与DFT+U的描述相符。

3. 研究探讨了通过形成2MCe +VO··缺陷来补偿掺杂物的能力学，即使用氧空位补偿两个掺杂物。

4. 与Ce4+相近的离子半径的Y3+掺杂物显示出正的阴离子空位形成能量，类似于La3+。

5. 三价掺杂物如La3+和Eu3+在提高CO向CO2的转化率方面表现出色，但仅在掺杂物浓度约为20%的情况下。

6. 每个掺杂物在邻近掺杂物的氧原子上形成一个局部化的氧孔。

7. 对于La-doped CeO2的结果可以通过考虑宿主氧化物的性质和铈的可还原性来最好地理解。

8. Al3+作为例外，由于其较小的离子半径，导致氧孔的自发补偿。

9. 强烈的掺杂物周围结构归因于Al3+的较小离子半径。

10. 建议对这些系统进行实验研究，以确定稳定缺陷。
