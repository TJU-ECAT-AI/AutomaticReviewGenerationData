[2] "Using the hybrid DFT HSE06 exchange-correlation functional as a benchmark, we show that doping the (110) surface with a single trivalent ion leads to formation of a localized MCe/ + OO• (M = the 3+ dopant), O hole state, confirming the description found with DFT+U."
[3] "In conjunction with earlier work on La-doped CeO2, we find that the stability of the compensating anion vacancy depends on the dopant ionic radius."
[4] "When considering the resulting electronic structure, in Al3+ doping, oxygen hole compensation is found. However, Sc3+, In3+, and Y3+ show the formation of a reduced Ce3+ cation and an uncompensated oxygen hole, similar to La3+."
[5] "Our results show that each dopant forms a localized oxygen hole on one or two oxygen atoms neighboring the dopant. However, the most stable defect, whether the oxygen hole polaron or the anion vacancy, depends on the ionic radius of the dopant."
[6] "Comparison of the DFT+U results will be made with the hybrid DFT for one dopant in the (2 × 2) surface cell."
[7] "We begin by describing the atomic structure of the (110) surface with the introduction of one trivalent dopant."
[8] "We show, for the example of Al3+ and In3+ as dopants, the DFT+U and HSE06 surface geometry of the doped (110) surface in a (2 × 2) surface supercell expansion."
[9] "In Figure 3, we show, for selected dopants in (a) the (2 × 2) surface supercell with DFT+U and HSE06 and (b) in the(2 × 4) surface supercell with DFT+U, the spin density for the oxygen hole polaron."
[10] "For Y3+, on one oxygen has a spin magnetization of 0.73 (DFT+U)/0.70 (HSE06) electrons and a second oxygen atom has a spin magnetization of 0.16 (DFT+U)/0.15 (HSE06) electrons."
