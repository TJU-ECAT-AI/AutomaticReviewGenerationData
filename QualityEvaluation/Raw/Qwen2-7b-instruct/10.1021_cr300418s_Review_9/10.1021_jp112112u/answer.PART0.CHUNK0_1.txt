[1] "In this paper, we use density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U) and hybrid DFT (HSE06 functional) to study the defects formed when the ceria (110) surface is doped with a series of trivalent dopants, namely, Al3+, Sc3+, Y3+, and In3+."
[2] "Using the hybrid DFT HSE06 exchange-correlation functional as a benchmark, we show that doping the (110) surface with a single trivalent ion leads to formation of a localized MCe/ + OO• (M = the 3+ dopant), O hole state, confirming the description found with DFT+U."
[3] "We use DFT+U to investigate the energetics of dopant compensation through formation of the 2MCe +VO·· defect, that is, compensation of two dopants with an oxygen vacancy."
[4] "When considering the resulting electronic structure, in Al3+ doping, oxygen hole compensation is found. However, Sc3+, In3+, and Y3+ show the formation of a reduced Ce3+ cation and an uncompensated oxygen hole, similar to La3+."
[5] "These results suggest that the ionic radius of trivalent dopants strongly influences the final defect formed when doping ceria with 3+ cations."
[6] "Comparison of the hybrid DFT and DFT+U results confirm the DFT+U description so that for investigation of the anion vacancy compensation mechanism (which requires a larger surface supercell and a larger number of calculations), we can apply DFT+U."
[7] "Our results show that each dopant forms a localized oxygen hole on one or two oxygen atoms neighboring the dopant. However, the most stable defect, whether the oxygen hole polaron or the anion vacancy, depends on the ionic radius of the dopant."
[8] "For Al3+, Sc3+, and In3+, because the computed formation energies are negative, this does indicate that spontaneous formation of a compensating oxygen vacancy can occur."
[9] "However, for Y3+ and La3+, (43, 45) the formation energies are positive so that charge compensation via oxygen vacancy formation is not necessarily spontaneous."
[10] "Taking these dopants together, there is a trend, as follows. The dopants with an ionic radius smaller than Ce4+ have a preference to form the compensating oxygen vacancy, although the stabilization of the oxygen vacancy structure is not large."
[11] "The dopants with larger ionic radii than Ce4+ prefer not to form the oxygen vacancy compensated structure, showing an energy cost for formation of the oxygen vacancy, although this cost is not very high."
[12] "Let us now examine the electronic structure of the oxygen vacancy compensated structures, with the spin density inFigure 8."
[13] "For the other dopants, the situation is different. Figure 8bd shows spin density plots for Sc3+, In3+, and Y3+ doping with the compensating oxygen vacancy."
[14] "In these plots, we see spin density isosurfaces consistent with an oxygen hole polaron and reduced Ce3+, which are confirmed by the PEDOS plots in Figure 9 and the computed spin magnetizations."
[15] "The PEDOS plots show states in the band gap due to the oxygen hole polaron and Ce3+. The spin magnetizations on the Ce3+ ion are 0.95 (Sc3+), 0.97 (In3+), and 0.97 electrons (Y3+), whereas the spin magnetizations on the polaron oxygen are 0.80 (Sc3+), 0.74 (In3+), and 0.72 electrons (Y3+)."

1. The study uses DFT+U and hybrid DFT to analyze defects in ceria (110) surface doped with trivalent ions like Al3+, Sc3+, Y3+, and In3+. It confirms the description found with DFT+U regarding the formation of a localized MCe/ + OO• (M = the 3+ dopant), O hole state. DFT+U is used to investigate the energetics of dopant compensation through the formation of the 2MCe +VO·· defect, which involves compensating two dopants with an oxygen vacancy.

2. The results show that the ionic radius of trivalent dopants significantly influences the final defect formed when doping ceria with 3+ cations. Al3+, Sc3+, and In3+ lead to the formation of an oxygen vacancy when a single dopant is introduced. Sc3+, In3+, and Y3+ show the formation of a reduced Ce3+ cation and an uncompensated oxygen hole when two dopants are compensated with an oxygen vacancy.

3. The study suggests that the electronic structure and defect formation depend on the dopant's ionic radius, with Al3+ leading to oxygen hole compensation, while Sc3+, In3+, and Y3+ show the formation of a reduced Ce3+ cation and an uncompensated oxygen hole.

4. The comparison between hybrid DFT and DFT+U confirms the DFT+U description for investigating the anion vacancy compensation mechanism, requiring larger surface supercells and more calculations. The results demonstrate that the most stable defect depends on the dopant's ionic radius, with Al3+, Sc3+, and In3+ leading to oxygen vacancy formation, and Y3+ and La3+ showing the formation of a reduced Ce3+ cation and an uncompensated oxygen hole.

1. 本文使用了修正的现场库仑相互作用的密度泛函理论（DFT+U）和混合DFT（HSE06功能）来研究铈（110）表面掺杂一系列三价掺杂剂（Al3+、Sc3+、Y3+、In3+）时形成的缺陷。研究表明，单个三价离子掺杂会导致形成局部化的MCe/ + OO•（M=3+掺杂剂），O空穴状态，这与使用DFT+U得出的描述一致。使用DFT+U研究了通过形成2MCe +VO··缺陷进行掺杂补偿的能力学，即用一个氧空位补偿两个掺杂剂。

2. 结果表明，三价掺杂剂的离子半径显著影响在铈中掺杂3+离子时形成的最终缺陷。Al3+、Sc3+和In3+导致当引入单个掺杂剂时形成氧空位。Sc3+、In3+和Y3+在用氧空位补偿两个掺杂剂时显示出形成减少的Ce3+阳离子和未补偿的氧空穴。

3. 研究表明，电子结构和缺陷形成取决于掺杂剂的离子半径，Al3+导致氧空位补偿，而Sc3+、In3+和Y3+显示形成减少的Ce3+阳离子和未补偿的氧空穴。

4. 混合DFT和DFT+U的比较确认了DFT+U的描述，用于研究阴离子空位补偿机制，需要更大的表面超单元和更多计算。结果显示，最稳定的缺陷取决于掺杂剂的离子半径，Al3+、Sc3+和In3+导致氧空位形成，而Y3+和La3+显示出形成减少的Ce3+阳离子和未补偿的氧空穴。
