[1] "When the (110) surface of ceria is doped with trivalent cations, the most stable defect depends on the ionic radius of the dopant. For small ionic radius dopants, with a large mismatch to the host oxide, the structure is strongly distorted. For Al, Sc, and In, the most stable defect is the oxygen vacancy compensating two dopants. For Y and La, the most stable defect is MCe/ + OO• with one dopant and an oxygen hole."

When the ceria (110) surface is doped with trivalent ions, the type of defect that forms depends significantly on the ionic radius of the dopant. Small ionic radius dopants, such as Al, Sc, and In, lead to a highly distorted structure and the formation of an oxygen vacancy that compensates for two dopants. In contrast, larger ionic radius dopants, like Y and La, form a defect where one dopant is accompanied by a localized Ce3+ ion and an oxygen hole.

当铈氧化物（110）表面用三价离子掺杂时，缺陷的类型取决于掺杂剂的离子半径。小离子半径掺杂剂，如Al、Sc和In，会导致高度扭曲的结构，并形成补偿两个掺杂剂的氧空位。相比之下，较大离子半径掺杂剂，如Y和La，在一个掺杂剂旁边形成一个局部化的Ce3+离子和一个氧空位。

[1] "The stability of the compensating anion vacancy depends on the dopant ionic radius. For Al3+, which has the smallest ionic radius, and Sc3+ and In3+, with intermediate ionic radii, formation of a compensating oxygen vacancy is stable. On the other hand, the Y3+ dopant, with an ionic radius close to that of Ce4+, shows a positive anion vacancy formation energy, as does La3+, which is larger than Ce4+."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The stability of the compensating anion vacancy is influenced by the dopant ionic radius. Al3+, with the smallest ionic radius, and Sc3+ and In3+, with intermediate ionic radii, allow for a stable formation of a compensating oxygen vacancy. Conversely, the Y3+ dopant, with an ionic radius similar to Ce4+, exhibits a positive anion vacancy formation energy, just like La3+, which is larger than Ce4+.

补偿阴离子空位的稳定性受到掺杂剂离子半径的影响。Al3+，具有最小的离子半径，以及Sc3+和In3+，具有中间的离子半径，允许形成稳定的补偿氧空位。相反，Y3+掺杂剂，其离子半径接近Ce4+，显示出正的阴离子空位形成能，就像比Ce4+大的La3+一样。

[1] "Al3+ as a trivalent dopant in CeO2 appears to be an exception in that its defect chemistry leads to spontaneous compensation of the oxygen holes."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
As a trivalent dopant in CeO2, Al3+ seems to be an exception because its defect chemistry results in the spontaneous compensation of oxygen holes.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
作为铈氧化物中的三价掺杂剂，Al3+似乎是例外，因为其缺陷化学导致了氧空位的自发补偿。
