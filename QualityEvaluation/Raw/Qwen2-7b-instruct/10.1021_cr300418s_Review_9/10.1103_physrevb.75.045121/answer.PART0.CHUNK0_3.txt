[I] "The hybrid HSE functional seems to provide a reasonably balanced description of CeO2 and Ce2O3. Most noticeably, the lattice constants can be predicted with roughly 1% precision, and the localization of a single 4f electron in Ce2O3 is well described, with the energy of the 4f states even matching measured spectra."
