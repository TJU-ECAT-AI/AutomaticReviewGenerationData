1. Accurately predicting the chemical and physical properties of systems with multivalent metals, especially lanthanide species, requires a precise description of the f states, which has been a challenge for density functional theory (DFT) calculations. 

2. Local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in DFT often inaccurately describe the behavior of systems where f-orbitals overlap minimally, bands are narrow, and electrons are nearly localized.

3. The DFT+U approach depends significantly on the Hubbard U parameter, the selection of localized orbitals, and the underlying exchange-correlation functional (LDA or GGA).

4. Hybrid functionals, notably B3LYP, have had limited application to periodic solids because of the substantial computational effort needed to evaluate nonlocal Fock exchange in plane-wave basis sets.

5. In Ce2O3, cerium atoms in a trivalent configuration localize the 4f orbital, causing the material to behave like a typical antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard insulator.

6. The DFT+U method calculates significantly different equilibrium volumes for CeO2 and Ce2O3 depending on whether the underlying functional is LDA or PBE.

7. The band gap of CeO2 calculated with DFT+U (5.3 eV) is smaller than the experimental value (6.0 eV) and much smaller than the values obtained with PBE0 and HSE (7.9 and 7.0 eV, respectively).

8. Increasing the effective U parameter (Ueff) in calculations shifts the occupied Ce 4f state away from the conduction band, as expected.

9. Determining heats of formation is challenging due to difficulties in preparing defect-free ceria with a well-defined oxidation state, making experimental measurement problematic.

10. For Ce2O3, the equilibrium volume calculated using hybrid functionals (PBE0 and HSE) is larger than that obtained with GGA calculations.

1. 精确预测包含多价金属，特别是镧系物种系统的化学和物理性质需要精确描述f状态，这一直是密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的一个挑战。

2. 当f轨道重叠最小、带宽狭窄且电子几乎局部化时，局部密度近似（LDA）和广义梯度近似（GGA）在DFT中通常会给出不准确的行为描述。

3. DFT+U方法在很大程度上依赖于Hubbard U参数、局部化轨道的选择以及底层交换相关功能（LDA或GGA）。

4. 尤其是B3LYP，由于评估扩展周期系统中平面波基集中的非局部Fock交换所需的大量计算工作，它在周期性固体中的应用受到限制。

5. 在Ce2O3中，三价铈原子局部化4f轨道，使得材料表现出典型的抗磁莫特-哈伯德绝缘体行为。

6. DFT+U方法根据底层功能（LDA或PBE）计算CeO2和Ce2O3的平衡体积显著不同。

7. CeO2使用DFT+U计算的带隙（5.3 eV）小于实验值（6.0 eV），远小于PBE0和HSE（分别为7.9和7.0 eV）。

8. 增加有效U参数（Ueff）将占据的Ce 4f状态从导带移开，符合预期。

9. 确定形成热是一个挑战，因为很难准备具有明确氧化态的无缺陷铈，这使得实验测量变得困难。

10. 对于Ce2O3，使用混合函数（PBE0和HSE）计算的平衡体积大于GGA计算的结果。
