[I] "The local and semilocal functionals yield an insulating solution, which is in agreement with spectroscopic and optical reflectivity measurements."
[II] "The hybrid functionals instead, overestimate the band gap, specifically, 7.93 PBE0 and 6.96 eV HSE."
[III] "The heats of formation are very difficult to measure experimentally, which is related to difficulties in preparing defect-free ceria with a well-defined oxidation state."
[IV] "For the prediction of thermochemical properties, the hybrid functionals do not appear to provide a clear-cut improvement over the standard PBE functional, although comparison with experiments is rather difficult, since the experimental formation energies are not known very accurately."
[V] "The DFT+U method does not possess any predictive capabilities, and worse, in the present case, there is no unique U that gives a reasonable account of structural parameters, the relative energies of different oxides, and spectroscopic properties."

<p>Despite the important impact of hybrid functionals in molecular quantum chemistry, B3LYP in particular,18 their applications to periodic solids used to be linked to Gaussian basis sets.15,24 The reason is the large computational effort to evaluate the nonlocal Fock exchange in extended periodic systems using a plane-wave basis set. Due to the progress in plane-wave-based algorithms25,26 and computer speed, hybrid functionals such as the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof27,28 HSE and the Perdew-Burke Ernzerhof2931 PBE0 functionals have been recently implemented in widely used plane-wave basis set codes.3234</p>
<p>In this work, we report a hybrid functional study of bulk CeO2 and Ce2O3 using the PBE0 and HSE hybrid functionals within the framework of the plane-wave projector augmented wave PAW formalism,3537 and compare with the LDA, the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof GGA from now on referred to as PBE, LDA+U, and PBE+U descriptions of these systems. We calculate the ground state structural, electronic, and magnetic properties as well as atomization energies and heats of formation. We also present results for the reduction energy of 2CeO2Ce2O3+ 1
2O2.</p>
<p>Selected PBE calculations were performed using the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave plus local orbitals FPL/APW+LO method.38</p>
<p>For the DFT+U case, the calculated CeO2 and Ce2O3 equilibrium volumes depend significantly on the description of the standard DFT part LDA versus PBE. The LDA+U scheme underestimates V0 by 0.6% and 3.2% for CeO2 and Ce2O3, respectively, whereas, the corresponding PBE+U volumes deviate by +4.5% and +3.6%. Hence the inclusion of U in either LDA or PBE changes the volume only little for CeO2 by up to +2%, but strongly increases the volume of Ce2O3 +6%. This is similar to the hybrid functionals and suggests that the LDA+U approach gives a reasonable account of the electron localization. It is noteworthy that the LDA+U values appear to be closer to experiment and the hybrid approaches than the PBE+U results. A recent publication of Fabris et al.61 also indicated a better performance of LDA+U than PBE+U for the description of reduced ceria surfaces.</p>

The study reports a hybrid functional analysis of bulk CeO2 and Ce2O3 using the PBE0 and HSE hybrid functionals within the plane-wave projector augmented wave PAW formalism. The research compares the results with those obtained using the local density approximation (LDA), the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA) (referred to as PBE), and the DFT+U approach (LDA+U and PBE+U). The hybrid functionals yield equilibrium volumes in good agreement with experimental data, especially for Ce2O3, where the volume increases from PBE to hybrid functionals. The LDA+U approach provides a reasonable account of electron localization and is closer to experimental results compared to the PBE+U approach.

Most noticeably, the lattice constants can be predicted with roughly 1% precision, and the localization of a single 4f electron in Ce2O3 is well described, with the energy of the 4f states even matching measured spectra."

[1] "The quantitive prediction of the chemical and physical properties of systems containing multivalent metals, in par- ticular lanthanide species, requires an accurate description of the f states and has been a challenge to density functional theory DFT calculations."
[2] "The local density LDA and gen- eralized gradient GGA approximations to the exchange-correlation XC energy functional often yield a qualitatively incorrect behavior for the case in which the f-orbital over- laps are small, the bands narrow, and the electrons nearly localize."
[3] "For DFT+U, the band gaps and the energetics depend on the Hubbard U parameter, the choice of the localized orbitals,and the underlying exchange- correlation functional LDA or GGA."
[4] "Despite the important impact of hybrid functionals in molecular quantum chemis-try, B3LYP in particular,18 their applications to periodic sol-ids used to be linked to Gaussian basis sets.15,1924 The rea-son is the large computational effort to evaluate the nonlocal Fock exchange in extended periodic systems using a plane- wave basis set."

[7] "Specifically, the CeO2 band gap Eg =5.3 eV in DFT+U is smaller than the experimental one 6.0 eV and much smaller than the PBE0 and HSE values 7.9 and 7.0 eV."
[8] "For Ce2O3, an increase of Ueff shifts the occupied Ce 4f state away from the conduc- tion band, as expected."
[9] "The results for the heats of formation and reaction energy are summarized in Table IV. A major problem is that the heats of formation are very difficult to measure experimen- tally, which is related to difficulties in preparing defect-free ceria with a well-defined oxidation state."
[10] "For the hybrid functionals, the equilibrium volume usually lies in between the LDA and GGA values, but for Ce2O3 the volume increases from the GGA to HSE and PBE0 results."

1. Accurately predicting the chemical and physical properties of systems with multivalent metals, especially lanthanide species, requires a precise description of the f states, which has been a challenge for density functional theory (DFT) calculations. 

2. Local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in DFT often inaccurately describe the behavior of systems where f-orbitals overlap minimally, bands are narrow, and electrons are nearly localized.

3. The DFT+U approach depends significantly on the Hubbard U parameter, the selection of localized orbitals, and the underlying exchange-correlation functional (LDA or GGA).

4. Hybrid functionals, notably B3LYP, have had limited application to periodic solids because of the substantial computational effort needed to evaluate nonlocal Fock exchange in plane-wave basis sets.

5. In Ce2O3, cerium atoms in a trivalent configuration localize the 4f orbital, causing the material to behave like a typical antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard insulator.

6. The DFT+U method calculates significantly different equilibrium volumes for CeO2 and Ce2O3 depending on whether the underlying functional is LDA or PBE.

7. The band gap of CeO2 calculated with DFT+U (5.3 eV) is smaller than the experimental value (6.0 eV) and much smaller than the values obtained with PBE0 and HSE (7.9 and 7.0 eV, respectively).

8. Increasing the effective U parameter (Ueff) in calculations shifts the occupied Ce 4f state away from the conduction band, as expected.

9. Determining heats of formation is challenging due to difficulties in preparing defect-free ceria with a well-defined oxidation state, making experimental measurement problematic.

10. For Ce2O3, the equilibrium volume calculated using hybrid functionals (PBE0 and HSE) is larger than that obtained with GGA calculations.

1. 精确预测包含多价金属，特别是镧系物种系统的化学和物理性质需要精确描述f状态，这一直是密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的一个挑战。

2. 当f轨道重叠最小、带宽狭窄且电子几乎局部化时，局部密度近似（LDA）和广义梯度近似（GGA）在DFT中通常会给出不准确的行为描述。

3. DFT+U方法在很大程度上依赖于Hubbard U参数、局部化轨道的选择以及底层交换相关功能（LDA或GGA）。

4. 尤其是B3LYP，由于评估扩展周期系统中平面波基集中的非局部Fock交换所需的大量计算工作，它在周期性固体中的应用受到限制。

5. 在Ce2O3中，三价铈原子局部化4f轨道，使得材料表现出典型的抗磁莫特-哈伯德绝缘体行为。

6. DFT+U方法根据底层功能（LDA或PBE）计算CeO2和Ce2O3的平衡体积显著不同。

7. CeO2使用DFT+U计算的带隙（5.3 eV）小于实验值（6.0 eV），远小于PBE0和HSE（分别为7.9和7.0 eV）。

8. 增加有效U参数（Ueff）将占据的Ce 4f状态从导带移开，符合预期。

9. 确定形成热是一个挑战，因为很难准备具有明确氧化态的无缺陷铈，这使得实验测量变得困难。

10. 对于Ce2O3，使用混合函数（PBE0和HSE）计算的平衡体积大于GGA计算的结果。
