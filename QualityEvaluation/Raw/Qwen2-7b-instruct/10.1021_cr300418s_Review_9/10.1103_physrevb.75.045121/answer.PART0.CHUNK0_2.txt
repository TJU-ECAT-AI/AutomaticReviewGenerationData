<p>Despite the important impact of hybrid functionals in molecular quantum chemistry, B3LYP in particular,18 their applications to periodic solids used to be linked to Gaussian basis sets.15,24 The reason is the large computational effort to evaluate the nonlocal Fock exchange in extended periodic systems using a plane-wave basis set. Due to the progress in plane-wave-based algorithms25,26 and computer speed, hybrid functionals such as the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof27,28 HSE and the Perdew-Burke Ernzerhof2931 PBE0 functionals have been recently implemented in widely used plane-wave basis set codes.3234</p>
<p>In this work, we report a hybrid functional study of bulk CeO2 and Ce2O3 using the PBE0 and HSE hybrid functionals within the framework of the plane-wave projector augmented wave PAW formalism,3537 and compare with the LDA, the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof GGA from now on referred to as PBE, LDA+U, and PBE+U descriptions of these systems. We calculate the ground state structural, electronic, and magnetic properties as well as atomization energies and heats of formation. We also present results for the reduction energy of 2CeO2Ce2O3+ 1
2O2.</p>
<p>Selected PBE calculations were performed using the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave plus local orbitals FPL/APW+LO method.38</p>
<p>For the DFT+U case, the calculated CeO2 and Ce2O3 equilibrium volumes depend significantly on the description of the standard DFT part LDA versus PBE. The LDA+U scheme underestimates V0 by 0.6% and 3.2% for CeO2 and Ce2O3, respectively, whereas, the corresponding PBE+U volumes deviate by +4.5% and +3.6%. Hence the inclusion of U in either LDA or PBE changes the volume only little for CeO2 by up to +2%, but strongly increases the volume of Ce2O3 +6%. This is similar to the hybrid functionals and suggests that the LDA+U approach gives a reasonable account of the electron localization. It is noteworthy that the LDA+U values appear to be closer to experiment and the hybrid approaches than the PBE+U results. A recent publication of Fabris et al.61 also indicated a better performance of LDA+U than PBE+U for the description of reduced ceria surfaces.</p>

The study reports a hybrid functional analysis of bulk CeO2 and Ce2O3 using the PBE0 and HSE hybrid functionals within the plane-wave projector augmented wave PAW formalism. The research compares the results with those obtained using the local density approximation (LDA), the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA) (referred to as PBE), and the DFT+U approach (LDA+U and PBE+U). The hybrid functionals yield equilibrium volumes in good agreement with experimental data, especially for Ce2O3, where the volume increases from PBE to hybrid functionals. The LDA+U approach provides a reasonable account of electron localization and is closer to experimental results compared to the PBE+U approach.

本研究采用平面波投影增强波PAW正则化框架下的PBE0和HSE混合函数对CeO2和Ce2O3进行宏观分析。研究将结果与局部密度近似（LDA）、Perdew、Burke和Ernzerhof广义梯度近似（GGA）（称为PBE）以及DFT+U方法（LDA+U和PBE+U）的结果进行了比较。混合函数提供了与实验数据相匹配的平衡体积，特别是对于Ce2O3，在从PBE到混合函数时体积增加。LDA+U方法合理地描述了电子局域化，并且与实验结果更为接近，相比于PBE+U方法。
