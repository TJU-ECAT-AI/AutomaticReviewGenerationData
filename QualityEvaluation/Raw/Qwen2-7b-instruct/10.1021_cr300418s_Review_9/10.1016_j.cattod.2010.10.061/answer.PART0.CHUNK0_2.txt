[1] "The substitution of one Ti atom in the (0 0 1) surface of anatase TiO2 by either a Au or a Fe atom, the creation of a oxygen vacancy defect in the doped and undoped surfaces, and the interaction of molecular O2 with the reduced doped and undoped surfaces have been investigated by means of periodic density functional calculations including spin polarization and considering different spin states with a fixed number of unpaired electrons for each system considered."
[2] "The interaction of molecular O2 with the oxygen vacancies in the reduced r-TiO2, r-AuTiO2 and r-FeTiO2 surfaces has been studied considering all possible different spin states arising from combination of triplet O2 with the corresponding state of the reduced surface."
[3] "O2 adsorption on the undoped surface is highly exothermic and involves a charge transfer from the oxide surface to molecular oxygen, with a reoxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ and formation of a adsorbed superoxide O2 species."
[4] "Interaction of O2 with the vacancy defect in Au-doped TiO2 is weak, and in the most stable complex the two atoms of molecular O2 are directly bonded to the Ti atom in contact with the vacancy, that exists as Ti4+, and not with the Au atom."
[5] "The O2 species thus formed is less activated than on undoped r-TiO2, suggesting that doping of anatase with Au is not an effective way of increasing the oxidation activity of titania catalysts."
[6] "The most promising result has been obtained with the Fe-doped surface. O2 adsorption involves a transfer of 0.8 e from the oxide to the molecule, that is activated as a superoxide O2 species, while Fe2+ is reoxidized to Fe3+."

1. The substitution of Ti atoms with Au or Fe atoms in anatase TiO2 creates oxygen vacancy defects and alters the electronic structure, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
2. Considering different spin states, the interaction of molecular O2 with oxygen vacancy defects in TiO2, AuTiO2, and FeTiO2 surfaces varies significantly.
3. Adsorption of O2 on undoped TiO2 involves a significant charge transfer and reoxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+, forming a superoxide O2 species.
4. In Au-doped TiO2, O2 interacts weakly with the Ti atom at the vacancy, rather than with the Au atom.
5. Doping with Au does not enhance the oxidation activity effectively, as the O2 species formed is less activated compared to undoped TiO2.
6. Fe-doped TiO2 shows promise due to the transfer of electron density from the oxide to O2, activating it as a superoxide species, and reoxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+.

1. 在锐钛矿TiO2中替换Ti原子为Au或Fe原子，会在材料中形成氧空位缺陷，并改变电子结构，从而影响氧化脱氢反应的催化性能。
2. 考虑不同的自旋状态，分子O2与锐钛矿、AuTiO2和FeTiO2表面中的氧空位缺陷之间的相互作用存在显著差异。
3. 在未掺杂的TiO2上吸附O2涉及显著的电荷转移和Ti3+的重新氧化，形成超氧O2物种。
4. 在Au掺杂的TiO2中，O2与位于空位附近的Ti原子直接结合，而不是与Au原子结合。
5. Au掺杂并不能有效提高TiO2的氧化活性，因为形成的O2物种相比未掺杂TiO2更不活跃。
6. Fe掺杂的TiO2显示出潜力，因为从氧化物向O2转移电子密度，激活其作为超氧物种，同时Fe2+被重新氧化为Fe3+。
