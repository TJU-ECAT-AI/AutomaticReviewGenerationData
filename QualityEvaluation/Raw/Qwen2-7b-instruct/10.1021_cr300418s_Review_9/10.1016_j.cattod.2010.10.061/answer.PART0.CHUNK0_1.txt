[1] "The substitution of one Ti atom in the (0 0 1) surface of anatase TiO2 by either a Au or a Fe atom, the creation of a oxygen vacancy defect in the doped and undoped surfaces, and the interaction of molecular O2 with the reduced doped and undoped surfaces have been investigated by means of periodic density functional calculations including spin polarization and considering different spin states with a fixed number of unpaired electrons for each system considered."
[2] "Doping of TiO2 anatase with Au or Fe weakens the metal-oxygen bonds around the dopant, decreases the energy necessary to form an oxygen vacancy defect from 2.7 eV in TiO2 to 1.24 eV in the Fe-doped system, and makes the reduction process exothermic in the case of Au-doped TiO2."
[3] "The interaction of molecular O2 with the oxygen vacancies in the reduced r-TiO2, r-AuTiO2 and r-FeTiO2 surfaces has been studied considering all possible different spin states arising from combination of triplet O2 with the corresponding state of the reduced surface."
[4] "O2 adsorption on the undoped surface is highly exothermic and involves a charge transfer from the oxide surface to molecular oxygen, with a reoxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ and formation of a adsorbed superoxide O2 species."
[5] "Interaction of O2 with the vacancy defect in Au-doped TiO2 is weak, and in the most stable complex the two atoms of molecular O2 are directly bonded to the Ti atom in contact with the vacancy, that exists as Ti4+, and not with the Au atom."
[6] "The O2 species thus formed is less activated than on undoped r-TiO2, suggesting that doping of anatase with Au is not an effective way of increasing the oxidation activity of titania catalysts."
[7] "The most promising result has been obtained with the Fe-doped surface. O2 adsorption involves a transfer of 0.8 e from the oxide to the molecule, that is activated as a superoxide O2 species, while Fe2+ is reoxidized to Fe3+."
[8] "Since the energy changes involved in the creation of the vacancy and in the subsequent O2 adsorption and vacancy healing are not as large as those found in undoped anatase, an enhanced oxidation activity can be expected in Fe-doped TiO2."

1. The study investigates the effects of doping titanium dioxide anatase with gold or iron on the oxygen vacancy formation, electronic structure, and interaction with molecular oxygen.

2. Doping titanium dioxide anatase with gold or iron weakens metal-oxygen bonds, reduces the energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation, and makes the reduction process exothermic in the case of gold doping.

3. Molecular oxygen interaction with oxygen vacancies in reduced titanium dioxide, gold-doped titanium dioxide, and iron-doped titanium dioxide is studied through various spin states.

4. Oxygen adsorption on the undoped surface is highly exothermic, leading to a charge transfer, reoxidation of titanium to the +4 state, and formation of a superoxide oxygen species.

5. In gold-doped titanium dioxide, molecular oxygen interacts weakly with the oxygen vacancy, bonding directly to the titanium atom rather than the gold atom.

6. Doping anatase titanium dioxide with gold does not effectively increase its oxidation activity due to the formation of less activated oxygen species.

7. The most promising result comes from iron doping, which allows for oxygen adsorption with a significant charge transfer, activation as a superoxide oxygen species, and reoxidation of iron to the +3 state.

8. Iron-doped titanium dioxide is expected to show enhanced oxidation activity because the energy changes during vacancy creation and subsequent oxygen adsorption and vacancy healing are less than in undoped anatase.

1. 研究了掺杂二氧化钛正钛酸盐中的金或铁对氧空位形成、电子结构和分子氧相互作用的影响。

2. 在掺杂的情况下，二氧化钛正钛酸盐中的金或铁削弱了金属-氧键，减少了形成氧空位所需的能量，并且在掺杂金的情况下使还原过程放热。

3. 分子氧与还原二氧化钛、金掺杂二氧化钛和铁掺杂二氧化钛中的氧空位的相互作用通过结合三重态氧与相应表面状态的所有可能的不同自旋状态进行了研究。

4. 未掺杂表面的氧吸附是高度放热的，导致电荷转移、钛氧化物表面的再氧化至+4状态以及形成超氧氧物种。

5. 在金掺杂二氧化钛中，分子氧与氧空位的相互作用较弱，直接与与氧空位接触的钛原子键合，而不是与金原子。

6. 由于金掺杂二氧化钛的活性较低，因此掺杂二氧化钛并不能有效提高其氧化活性，因为形成的氧物种活性较低。

7. 最有前景的结果来自于铁掺杂，这允许氧气吸附伴随着显著的电荷转移、作为超氧氧物种的激活以及铁的再氧化至+3状态。

8. 铁掺杂二氧化钛预计会表现出增强的氧化活性，因为在创建空位和随后的氧吸附以及空位愈合过程中所涉及的能量变化比未掺杂的正钛酸盐要少。
