[1] "In this paper, we have investigated, from a theoretical point of view, the substitution of one Ti atom in the (0 0 1) surface of anatase TiO2 with an Au atom, and have compared the results with those previously obtained for Fe-doping."
[2] "Although the presence of Au3+ species in Au/TiO2 catalysts has already been proposed on the basis of CO adsorption experiments [34,35], their exact nature and role in the mechanism of CO oxidation by gold supported on TiO2 have not been unequivocally demonstrated yet."
[3] "Doping of rutile TiO2(1 1 0) surface with Au, Ag, Cu, Ni, Pd or Pt reduces the bond of surface oxygen to titania, making it a better oxidation catalyst [30]."
[4] "Addition of Fe to TiO2 increases the oxidation activity of Au/TiO2 catalysts by a factor of two, and it has been demonstrated by theory [31] and experiment [32,33] that the effect of Fe-doping is to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancy defects on the TiO2 surface."
[5] "The finding that doping with Au results in thermodynamically stable oxygen vacancies had already been reported for the (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) surfaces of ceria [20,21], but to our knowledge it is the first time that this result is reported for titania."
[6] "O2 adsorption on the undoped surface is highly exothermic and involves a charge transfer from the oxide surface to molecular oxygen, with a reoxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ and formation of a adsorbed superoxide O2species."
[7] "Interaction of O2 with the vacancy defect in Au-doped TiO2 is weak, and in the most stable complex the two atoms of molecular O2 are directly bonded to the Ti atom in contact with the vacancy, that exists as Ti4+, and not with the Au atom."
[8] "The O2 species thus formed is less activated than on undoped r-TiO2, suggesting that doping of anatase with Au is not an effective way of increasing the oxidation activity of titania catalysts."
[9] "The most promising result has been obtained with the Fe-doped surface. O2 adsorption involves a transfer of 0.8 e from the oxide to the molecule, that is activated as a superoxide O2species, while Fe2+ is reoxidized to Fe3+. Since the energy changes involved in the creation of the vacancy and in the subsequent O2 adsorption and vacancy healing are not as large as those found in undoped anatase, an enhanced oxidation activity can be expected in Fe-doped TiO2."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions in various ways. The electronic structure affects the energy barriers for reactions, while the catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as the reactivity of the active sites, the stability of the catalyst, and the selectivity of the reaction. The key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure, understanding the dynamic behavior of the catalyst during the reaction, and optimizing the reaction conditions to achieve high efficiency, selectivity, and safety.

In the context of nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the specific challenges include:

1. Accurately modeling the electronic structure of the catalyst to predict the energy barriers for reaction steps.
2. Understanding how dopants and vacancies affect the electronic structure and reactivity of the catalyst.
3. Optimizing the reaction conditions to balance efficiency, selectivity, and safety.
4. Accounting for the dynamic behavior of the catalyst during the reaction, including the formation and stability of active sites.
5. Ensuring that the theoretical predictions are validated through experimental results.
6. Balancing the trade-offs between different performance metrics, such as reaction rate, product purity, and catalyst lifetime.

Answering these challenges requires advanced computational techniques, detailed kinetic studies, and rigorous experimental validation. Theoretical models must be continuously refined to improve their predictive capabilities and guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts.
