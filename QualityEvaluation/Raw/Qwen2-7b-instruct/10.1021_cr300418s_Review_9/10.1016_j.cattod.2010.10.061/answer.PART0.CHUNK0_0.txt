[1] "In this recent theoretical study about activation of molecular O2 on isolated and supported gold nanoparticles, we found that the activation energy involved in O2 dissociation is directly related with the degree of electron density transfer from the catalyst to the * molecular orbital of adsorbed O2, and therefore with the OO vibration frequency that reflects the strength of the OO bond."
[2] "It has been found that not only the calculated adsorption energies, but also the optimized structures and charge and spin distributions significantly differ from one spin state to another."
[3] "The interaction of molecular O2 with the oxygen vacancies in the reduced r-TiO2, r-AuTiO2 and r-FeTiO2 surfaces has been studied considering all possible different spin states arising from combination of triplet O2 with the corresponding state of the reduced surface."
[4] "O2 adsorption on the undoped surface is highly exothermic and involves a charge transfer from the oxide surface to molecular oxygen, with a reoxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ and formation of a adsorbed superoxide O2species."
[5] "Interaction of O2 with the vacancy defect in Au-doped TiO2 is weak, and in the most stable complex the two atoms of molecular O2 are directly bonded to the Ti atom in contact with the vacancy, that exists as Ti4+, and not with the Au atom."
[6] "The O2 species thus formed is less activated than on undoped r-TiO2, suggesting that doping of anatase with Au is not an effective way of increasing the oxidation activity of titania catalysts."
[7] "The most promising result has been obtained with the Fe-doped surface. O2 adsorption involves a transfer of 0.8 e from the oxide to the molecule, that is activated as a superoxide O2species, while Fe2+ is reoxidized to Fe3+."

1. The activation energy required for O2 dissociation is directly linked to the amount of electron density transferred from the catalyst to the adsorbed O2 molecule, and this is reflected in the OO vibration frequency, which indicates the strength of the OO bond.

2. Different spin states lead to significant variations in the calculated adsorption energies, optimized structures, and charge/spin distributions.

3. The interaction of molecular O2 with oxygen vacancies on various surfaces is examined through all possible spin states resulting from the combination of triplet O2 with the reduced surface state.

4. Adsorption on the undoped surface results in a strong exothermic process, with a charge transfer from the oxide to O2, leading to reoxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ and the formation of a superoxide O2 species.

5. In Au-doped TiO2, the interaction between O2 and the oxygen vacancy is weak, and the most stable configuration involves direct bonding between the O2 molecule and the Ti atom at the vacancy, which exists as Ti4+, rather than the Au atom.

6. The O2 species formed on the undoped surface is less activated compared to the surface doped with Au, suggesting that doping with Au does not effectively enhance the oxidation activity of titania catalysts.

7. The Fe-doped surface shows the most promising result, as O2 adsorption involves a transfer of 0.8 e from the oxide to the molecule, which becomes activated as a superoxide O2 species, while Fe2+ is reoxidized to Fe3+.

1. 在孤立和支撑的金纳米颗粒上激活分子O2的激活能量与催化剂向吸附的O2分子中电子密度转移的程度直接相关，并且通过反映OO键强度的OO振动频率来表示。

2. 不同的自旋状态导致计算吸附能、优化结构和电荷/自旋分布存在显著差异。

3. 对于各种表面，分子O2与氧空位的相互作用在所有可能的自旋状态下进行研究，自旋状态是通过将三重态O2与相应的减少表面状态组合得出的。

4. 对于未掺杂的表面，吸附过程非常放热，伴随着从氧化物到O2的电荷转移，导致Ti3+的重新氧化为Ti4+并形成吸附的超氧O2物种。

5. 在Au掺杂的TiO2中，O2与氧空位的相互作用较弱，在最稳定的配置中，O2分子与位于空位附近的Ti原子直接结合，该Ti原子以Ti4+的形式存在，而不是Au原子。

6. 形成的O2物种在未掺杂表面上比在Au掺杂的TiO2表面上更不活跃，这表明用Au掺杂并不能有效地提高氧化钛催化剂的活性。

7. 对于Fe掺杂的表面，显示出最有希望的结果，因为O2吸附涉及从氧化物到分子的电荷转移0.8 e，该O2物种被激活为超氧O2物种，而Fe2+被重新氧化为Fe3+。
