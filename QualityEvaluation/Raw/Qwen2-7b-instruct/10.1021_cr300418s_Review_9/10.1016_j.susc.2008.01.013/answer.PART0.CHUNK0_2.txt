[1] "As mentioned in the introduction, the standard DFT formulation with local-density approximation (LDA) or GGA functionals usually fails to describe strongly correlated electrons because of a deficient treatment of electron correlation, combined with an incomplete cancellation between the self-interaction in the Coulomb interaction with the exchange interaction."
[2] "We have used the DFT + U method [28,29], where a Hubbard parameter U is introduced for the Ce 4f electrons to describe the on-site Coulomb interaction."
[3] "The relaxation of CeO2(111) surface is quite small and the addition of the Hubbard U parameter for stoichiometric ceria has no significant consequences."
[4] "For the Zr-doped CeO2(111) slab with an O vacancy,we find that the relaxed atomic structure of the Va model is very similar to that of the undoped reduced CeO2(111) slab."
[5] "The formation of each oxygen vacancy results in the reduction of two Ce cations neighboring the O vacancy."
[6] "On the other hand Zr doping induces a large perturbation on the atomic structures of reduced and unreduced Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surfaces and enhances the generation of nonequivalent oxygen anions and the displacement of oxygen around the Zr centers."

The standard DFT formulation with local-density approximation (LDA) or GGA functionals does not adequately address the electron correlation issue due to inadequate treatment of electron correlation and an incomplete cancellation between the self-interaction in the Coulomb interaction with the exchange interaction. The DFT + U method introduces a Hubbard parameter U for the Ce 4f electrons to describe the on-site Coulomb interaction. The relaxation of the CeO2(111) surface is minimal, and adding the Hubbard U parameter for stoichiometric ceria does not have significant consequences. The relaxed atomic structure of the Va model for the Zr-doped CeO2(111) slab with an oxygen vacancy is similar to that of the undoped reduced CeO2(111) slab. The formation of an oxygen vacancy leads to the reduction of two Ce cations neighboring the vacancy. Zr doping results in a substantial distortion of the atomic structures on both reduced and unreduced Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surfaces, promoting the creation of non-equivalent oxygen anions and displacing oxygen atoms around the Zr centers.

标准的DFT公式结合局部密度近似（LDA）或GGA函数通常无法描述强相关电子，因为对电子相关性的处理不充分，并且自相互作用与交换作用之间的相互抵消不完全。DFT + U方法引入了U参数来描述Ce 4f电子上的局域电荷相互作用。对于均相铈氧化物表面，添加的Hubbard U参数没有显著影响。铈氧2(111)表面的松弛很小。Zr掺杂铈氧2(111)薄片中具有氧空位的最接近模型的松弛原子结构与未掺杂的还原铈氧2(111)薄片非常相似。氧空位的形成导致相邻氧空位的两个铈离子被还原。Zr掺杂会导致减少和未减少的Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)表面的原子结构发生显著扰动，促进非等效氧离子的生成和周围Zr中心的氧原子位移。
