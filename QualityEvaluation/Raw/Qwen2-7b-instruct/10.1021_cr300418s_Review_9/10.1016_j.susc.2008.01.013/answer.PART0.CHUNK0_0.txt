[1] "The effects of Zr doping on the atomic and electronic properties of the ceria(111) surface are studied using first-principles density functional theory with the inclusion of on-site Coulomb interaction."
[2] "It is found that (i) Zr doping induces a severe distortion of the unreduced surface structure; (ii) at the reduced Zr-doped ceria(111) surface, the oxygen anions around the oxygen vacancy show much larger displacements than those on the pure CeO2(111) surface; (iii) an oxygen vacancy is more easily formed around the Zr dopant, and the reduction energy is lowered by about 0.5 eV; (iv) the excess electrons left by the removed oxygen atom localize on the two Ce cations neighboring the vacancy and thus brings about the reduction of the two Ce4+ ions; and (v) the atomic structure modification induced by the Zr doping plays a vital role in facilitating the reduction of the ceriazirconia solid solution as compared to the pure ceria."
[3] "The effects of Zr doping on the electronic structure can be seen in the DOSs for the unreduced and reduced Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) (the Vb model) in Fig. 5c and d. It is found that the DOSs for the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) and the CeO2(111) systems are very similar, which suggests that the Zr doping has no obvious effect on the electronic structure when the O vacancy is created."
[4] "The reduction leads to a new gap state appearing above the O 2p band edge and below the Fermi level which is shown in Fig. 5d. The integration of this new peak gives again the total number of two electrons, which are almost completely localized on two of the nearest neighbor Ce cat- ions of the vacancy."

1. Zr doping in ceria(111) surfaces causes a significant distortion in the surface structure. Oxygen vacancies form more easily around the Zr dopant, reducing the energy required for their formation by about 0.5 eV. Excess electrons left by the oxygen vacancy localize on the two neighboring Ce4+ ions, causing their reduction to Ce3+ ions. Zr doping plays a crucial role in facilitating the reduction of ceria-zirconia solid solutions compared to pure ceria.

2. Zr doping does not significantly alter the electronic structure of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surfaces when oxygen vacancies are created. The two excess electrons from the removed oxygen atom localize on two nearest neighbor Ce ions, reducing each to a Ce3+ ion.

3. The presence of Zr dopants leads to the formation of a new gap state in the electronic density of states for both the unreduced and reduced Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surfaces. This new state indicates the presence of two electrons that are localized on two of the nearest neighbor Ce ions around the oxygen vacancy.

1. 在氧化锆（111）表面中掺入Zr会导致表面结构显著扭曲。在Zr掺杂点附近更容易形成氧空位，形成氧空位所需的能量降低了约0.5 eV。被移除的氧原子留下的多余电子集中在两个相邻的Ce4+离子上，导致它们还原为Ce3+离子。Zr掺杂在促进氧化锆-氧化锆固溶体的还原方面比纯氧化锆更为关键。

2. 当在Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)表面上创建氧空位时，Zr掺杂对电子结构的影响并不明显。从移除的氧原子留下的两个多余电子集中在两个最近邻的Ce离子上，将每个离子还原为Ce3+。

3. 存在Zr掺杂的情况下，在未还原和还原的Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)表面上都形成了新的能隙态。这个新的状态表明存在两个电子，这些电子集中在氧空位附近的两个最近邻的Ce离子上。
