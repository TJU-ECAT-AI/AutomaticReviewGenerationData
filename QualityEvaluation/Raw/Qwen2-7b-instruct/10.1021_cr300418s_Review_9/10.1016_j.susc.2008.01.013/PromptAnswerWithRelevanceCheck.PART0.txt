[1] "The effects of Zr doping on the atomic and electronic properties of the ceria(111) surface are studied using first-principles density functional theory with the inclusion of on-site Coulomb interaction."
[2] "It is found that (i) Zr doping induces a severe distortion of the unreduced surface structure; (ii) at the reduced Zr-doped ceria(111) surface, the oxygen anions around the oxygen vacancy show much larger displacements than those on the pure CeO2(111) surface; (iii) an oxygen vacancy is more easily formed around the Zr dopant, and the reduction energy is lowered by about 0.5 eV; (iv) the excess electrons left by the removed oxygen atom localize on the two Ce cations neighboring the vacancy and thus brings about the reduction of the two Ce4+ ions; and (v) the atomic structure modification induced by the Zr doping plays a vital role in facilitating the reduction of the ceriazirconia solid solution as compared to the pure ceria."
[3] "The effects of Zr doping on the electronic structure can be seen in the DOSs for the unreduced and reduced Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) (the Vb model) in Fig. 5c and d. It is found that the DOSs for the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) and the CeO2(111) systems are very similar, which suggests that the Zr doping has no obvious effect on the electronic structure when the O vacancy is created."
[4] "The reduction leads to a new gap state appearing above the O 2p band edge and below the Fermi level which is shown in Fig. 5d. The integration of this new peak gives again the total number of two electrons, which are almost completely localized on two of the nearest neighbor Ce cat- ions of the vacancy."

1. Zr doping in ceria(111) surfaces causes a significant distortion in the surface structure. Oxygen vacancies form more easily around the Zr dopant, reducing the energy required for their formation by about 0.5 eV. Excess electrons left by the oxygen vacancy localize on the two neighboring Ce4+ ions, causing their reduction to Ce3+ ions. Zr doping plays a crucial role in facilitating the reduction of ceria-zirconia solid solutions compared to pure ceria.

2. Zr doping does not significantly alter the electronic structure of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surfaces when oxygen vacancies are created. The two excess electrons from the removed oxygen atom localize on two nearest neighbor Ce ions, reducing each to a Ce3+ ion.

3. The presence of Zr dopants leads to the formation of a new gap state in the electronic density of states for both the unreduced and reduced Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surfaces. This new state indicates the presence of two electrons that are localized on two of the nearest neighbor Ce ions around the oxygen vacancy.

1. 在氧化锆（111）表面中掺入Zr会导致表面结构显著扭曲。在Zr掺杂点附近更容易形成氧空位，形成氧空位所需的能量降低了约0.5 eV。被移除的氧原子留下的多余电子集中在两个相邻的Ce4+离子上，导致它们还原为Ce3+离子。Zr掺杂在促进氧化锆-氧化锆固溶体的还原方面比纯氧化锆更为关键。

2. 当在Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)表面上创建氧空位时，Zr掺杂对电子结构的影响并不明显。从移除的氧原子留下的两个多余电子集中在两个最近邻的Ce离子上，将每个离子还原为Ce3+。

3. 存在Zr掺杂的情况下，在未还原和还原的Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)表面上都形成了新的能隙态。这个新的状态表明存在两个电子，这些电子集中在氧空位附近的两个最近邻的Ce离子上。

[1] "As mentioned in the introduction, the standard DFT formulation with local-density approximation (LDA) or GGA functionals usually fails to describe strongly correlated electrons because of a deficient treatment of electron correlation, combined with an incomplete cancellation between the self-interaction in the Coulomb interaction with the exchange interaction."
[2] "We have used the DFT + U method [28,29], where a Hubbard parameter U is introduced for the Ce 4f electrons to describe the on-site Coulomb interaction."
[3] "The relaxation of CeO2(111) surface is quite small and the addition of the Hubbard U parameter for stoichiometric ceria has no significant consequences."
[4] "For the Zr-doped CeO2(111) slab with an O vacancy,we find that the relaxed atomic structure of the Va model is very similar to that of the undoped reduced CeO2(111) slab."
[5] "The formation of each oxygen vacancy results in the reduction of two Ce cations neighboring the O vacancy."
[6] "On the other hand Zr doping induces a large perturbation on the atomic structures of reduced and unreduced Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surfaces and enhances the generation of nonequivalent oxygen anions and the displacement of oxygen around the Zr centers."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The standard DFT formulation with local-density approximation (LDA) or GGA functionals does not adequately address the electron correlation issue due to inadequate treatment of electron correlation and an incomplete cancellation between the self-interaction in the Coulomb interaction with the exchange interaction. The DFT + U method introduces a Hubbard parameter U for the Ce 4f electrons to describe the on-site Coulomb interaction. The relaxation of the CeO2(111) surface is minimal, and adding the Hubbard U parameter for stoichiometric ceria does not have significant consequences. The relaxed atomic structure of the Va model for the Zr-doped CeO2(111) slab with an oxygen vacancy is similar to that of the undoped reduced CeO2(111) slab. The formation of an oxygen vacancy leads to the reduction of two Ce cations neighboring the vacancy. Zr doping results in a substantial distortion of the atomic structures on both reduced and unreduced Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surfaces, promoting the creation of non-equivalent oxygen anions and displacing oxygen atoms around the Zr centers.

标准的DFT公式结合局部密度近似（LDA）或GGA函数通常无法描述强相关电子，因为对电子相关性的处理不充分，并且自相互作用与交换作用之间的相互抵消不完全。DFT + U方法引入了U参数来描述Ce 4f电子上的局域电荷相互作用。对于均相铈氧化物表面，添加的Hubbard U参数没有显著影响。铈氧2(111)表面的松弛很小。Zr掺杂铈氧2(111)薄片中具有氧空位的最接近模型的松弛原子结构与未掺杂的还原铈氧2(111)薄片非常相似。氧空位的形成导致相邻氧空位的两个铈离子被还原。Zr掺杂会导致减少和未减少的Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)表面的原子结构发生显著扰动，促进非等效氧离子的生成和周围Zr中心的氧原子位移。

The study investigates the impact of Zr doping on the atomic and electronic properties of ceria(111) surfaces. Zr doping causes significant distortion of the surface structure, increases oxygen vacancy formation, lowers reduction energy by about 0.5 eV, and facilitates the reduction of ceria-zirconia solid solutions by enabling the excess electrons to localize on Ce ions, leading to their reduction. In a ceria-zirconia solid solution, the high concentration of Zr dopants offers numerous active oxygen sites for easier reduction processes.

The research focuses on the effects of Zr doping on the atomic and electronic properties of the ceria(111) surface. Zr doping leads to a severe distortion of the surface structure, particularly in the vicinity of the dopant. Oxygen vacancies are more easily formed near the Zr dopant, reducing the reduction energy by about 0.5 eV. Excess electrons from the removed oxygen atom localize on the two Ce cations adjacent to the vacancy, leading to their reduction. The atomic structure changes induced by Zr doping play a crucial role in facilitating the reduction of the ceria-zirconia solid solution compared to pure ceria. The addition of the Hubbard U parameter for stoichiometric ceria does not have significant consequences. The structure of the reduced CeO2(111) surface is severely perturbed, breaking the initial symmetry of the three Ce ions around the vacancy. The effects of Zr doping on the electronic structure are minimal, as the DOSs for the unreduced and reduced Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) and CeO2(111) systems are similar.

研究主要关注了锆掺杂对铈氧化物(111)表面的原子和电子性质的影响。锆掺杂导致表面结构严重扭曲，尤其是在掺杂中心附近。氧空位更容易在锆掺杂点附近形成，降低还原能约0.5 eV。从被移除的氧原子中释放出的多余电子会局部化在与空位相邻的两个铈离子上，导致它们的还原。由锆掺杂引起的原子结构变化在促进铈锆氧化物固溶体的还原方面起着关键作用，相较于纯铈氧化物。对于等摩尔量的铈氧化物，添加Hubbard U参数对其没有显著影响。减去的CeO2(111)表面结构严重扰动，破坏了三个铈离子围绕空位的初始对称性。锆掺杂对电子结构的影响较小，未观察到明显差异，因为未掺杂的Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)和CeO2(111)系统的电子密度图相似。
