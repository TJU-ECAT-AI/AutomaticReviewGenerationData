[1] "The computational details are presented in Section 2."
[2] "The effects of Zr doping on the atomic and electronic properties of the ceria(111) surface are studied using first-principles density functional theory with the inclusion of on-site Coulomb interaction."
[3] "It is found that (i) Zr doping induces a severe distortion of the unreduced surface structure; (ii) at the reduced Zr-doped ceria(111) surface, the oxygen anions around the oxygen vacancy show much larger displacements than those on the pure CeO2(111) surface; (iii) an oxygen vacancy is more easily formed around the Zr dopant, and the reduction energy is lowered by about 0.5 eV; (iv) the excess electrons left by the removed oxygen atom localize on the two Ce cations neighboring the vacancy and thus brings about the reduction of the two Ce4+ ions; and (v) the atomic structure modification induced by the Zr doping plays a vital role in facilitating the reduction of the ceriazirconia solid solution as compared to the pure ceria."
[4] "This may be the reason that is responsible for the big reduction in the oxygen formation energy."
[5] "For a ceriazirconia solid solution like our model system of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111), the Zr doping centers are as many as 25% of the cations sites,which thus offer active oxygen sites up to 75% of the total number of the surface oxygen anions."

The study investigates the impact of Zr doping on the atomic and electronic properties of ceria(111) surfaces. Zr doping causes significant distortion of the surface structure, increases oxygen vacancy formation, lowers reduction energy by about 0.5 eV, and facilitates the reduction of ceria-zirconia solid solutions by enabling the excess electrons to localize on Ce ions, leading to their reduction. In a ceria-zirconia solid solution, the high concentration of Zr dopants offers numerous active oxygen sites for easier reduction processes.

研究探讨了锆掺杂对铈(111)表面原子和电子性质的影响。锆掺杂导致表面结构显著变形，增加氧空位形成，降低约0.5电子伏特的还原能，并通过使多余的电子局部化在铈离子上，促进铈锆固溶体的还原过程，从而实现铈的还原。在铈锆固溶体中，高浓度的锆掺杂提供大量的活性氧位点，便于进行还原反应。
