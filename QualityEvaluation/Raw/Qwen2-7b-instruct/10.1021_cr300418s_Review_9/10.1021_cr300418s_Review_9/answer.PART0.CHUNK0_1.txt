12 The idea of coupling dehydrogenation with a hydrogen consuming reaction is appealing, but the performance of the catalysts studied so far is not good enough for commercial use. 
14.2 Ethylbenzene Dehydrogenation in the Presence of CO2, Catalyzed by Doped Oxides
14.2.2 Are These Results Consistent with What We Know from Calculations? Unfortunately, we have no systematic calculations for the systems discussed in this section. 
15 Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethylbenzene to Styrene by Using Oxygen and Doped Oxide Catalysts
As we have emphasized, the use of oxygen to react with the H2 shifts the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction favorably. 
18 Ethane Oxidative Dehydrogenation with Oxygen Catalyzed by Zr-Doped NiO
Doping with even a small amount of Zr increases substantially the temperature at which hydrogen consumption by the oxide begins.

1. The use of doped oxides in catalytic systems for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions has shown promise but faces challenges in achieving commercial viability due to the current performance limitations of catalysts.
2. The results from studies on ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 indicate that doping oxides can enhance selectivity and conversion, albeit with stability issues. 
3. Without systematic calculations for the systems discussed, the consistency between experimental results and theoretical predictions remains uncertain.
4. Doping with zirconium in nickel oxide enhances the selectivity for ethylene production in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, with improvements in the binding energy of oxygen atoms and reduced reactivity towards hydrogen.
