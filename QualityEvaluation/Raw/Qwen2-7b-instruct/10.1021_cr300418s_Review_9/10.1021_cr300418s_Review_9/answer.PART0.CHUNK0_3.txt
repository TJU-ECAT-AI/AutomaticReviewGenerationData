14.2.1 Experimental Results
"The best ethylbenzene conversion, obtained with Fe3Ti, was 19.3% with a styrene yield of 18.6%."
"However, the area per gram of Fe3Ti is 98 m2/g, while that of TiO2 is 21.7 m2/g."
"Fe3Ti is about as active as TiO2; the main effect of the dopant on conversion is to increase the area per gram."
"ZrO2 doped with Ga is a worse catalyst than ZrO2, and both have very low performance."
"Ren et al. (415) prepared TiO2 doped with Fe, V, Zr, and Mg. Among these, Fe3Ti is most active."
"Among these, Fe3Ti is most active."
"The best catalyst in this group is Ni0.1Ce0.9O2, which gives an ethylbenzene conversion of 70% and a selectivity to styrene of 75%, at a temperature of 450 C, O2/ethylbenzene ratio = 0.8, and space velocity = 250 mL/gcat/min."
"The best performance was obtained for 10ZrNiO at 430 C with an ethylene yield of 40% and an ethylene selectivity of 66%."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, doping with low-valence dopants increases the specific area of the catalyst, enhancing its performance in ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene conversions. However, the stability of the catalysts is a challenge, as evidenced by the decrease in conversion over time. Theoretical modeling struggles to accurately predict the mechanisms of reaction, especially regarding the reactivity of the doped oxides with alkanes. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems is complex, requiring optimization of both the catalyst preparation and the reaction conditions. In ethane to ethylene reactions, doping with zirconium improves selectivity, as it binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide, potentially limiting the reactivity with ethane while enhancing selectivity towards ethylene. Theoretical models often fail to capture the specifics of oxygen vacancy formation and its impact on the reactivity of the catalyst surface.

在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成影响其电子结构和催化性能。具体来说，低价掺杂可以增加催化剂的特定面积，从而提高乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯转化的性能。然而，催化剂的稳定性是一个挑战，催化剂的转化率会随时间逐渐下降。理论建模难以准确预测反应机制，特别是关于掺杂氧化物与烷烃的反应活性。平衡催化系统的效率、选择性和安全性是复杂的，需要优化催化剂的制备和反应条件。在乙烷到乙烯反应中，锆掺杂提高了选择性，因为它使表面氧原子与氧化物更牢固地结合，可能限制了与乙烷的反应活性，同时增强了对乙烯的选择性。理论模型往往无法捕捉到氧化物表面氧空位形成及其对反应活性的影响。
