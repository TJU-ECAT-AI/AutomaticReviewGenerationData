[1] "Unfortunately, we have no systematic calculations for the systems discussed in this section."
[2] "As we have emphasized, the use of oxygen to react with the H2 shifts the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction favorably."
[3] "Danger of explosion and fire limits the oxygen/hydrocarbon ratios that can be used."
[4] "BET area of the material made by coprecipitation is 71 m2/g, and that of the material made by the template method is 134 m2/g."
[5] "The method of preparation makes a difference."

1. Systematic calculations for the systems discussed in this section are lacking.
2. Oxygen enhances the dehydrogenation reaction's equilibrium.
3. Oxygen/hydrocarbon ratios are constrained by safety concerns.
4. The BET area of the coprecipitated material is notably lower than that of the template-assisted method.
5. Preparation techniques impact the catalyst's performance.
