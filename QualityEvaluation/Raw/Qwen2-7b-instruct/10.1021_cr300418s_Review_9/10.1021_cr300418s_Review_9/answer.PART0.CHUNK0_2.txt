12.2 Oxidative Dehydrogenation: Generalities
"A much-pursued variant of this scheme is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using oxygen to form water: An alternative is to use CO2, to react with H2 and make CO and water (the reverse watergas shift reaction, RWGS):"
14.2 Ethylbenzene Dehydrogenation in the Presence of CO2, Catalyzed by Doped Oxides
"The best ethylbenzene conversion, obtained with Fe3Ti, was 19.3% with a styrene yield of 18.6%."
14.2.2 Are These Results Consistent with What We Know from Calculations?
"We caution that the experiments described here were very limited in scope and look only at a narrow range of parameters (dopant concentration, method of preparation, gas composition, temperature, etc.)."
15 Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethylbenzene to Styrene by Using Oxygen and Doped Oxide Catalysts
"As we have emphasized, the use of oxygen to react with the H2 shifts the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction favorably. An obvious disadvantage is that an aggressive molecule such as oxygen might react with styrene, reducing selectivity."
18 Ethane Oxidative Dehydrogenation with Oxygen Catalyzed by Zr-Doped NiO
"Wu et al. (126) have prepared Zr-doped NiO and undoped NiO by a solgel method."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The electronic structure changes due to the doping of high-valence elements like zirconium, which can act as strong Lewis bases, affecting the reactivity of the catalyst surface. The introduction of dopants can decrease the reactivity caused by Ni vacancies, which makes NiO a better oxidant. The presence of dopants also increases the binding energy of oxygen atoms to the oxide surface, making them less reactive. This is beneficial for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, potentially improving selectivity. Challenges in theoretical modeling involve accurately predicting the mechanism of the reaction, especially considering the possibility of O2 adsorption on the dopant, which can compete with the reaction with surface O. Process optimization requires balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety, considering the potential for reactions with other species in the system, such as styrene or ethylene. The limited scope of experiments, narrow range of parameters, and the lack of specific calculations for the systems discussed in the literature pose challenges in fully understanding and optimizing these catalytic systems.

在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成会影响其电子结构和催化性能。掺入高电荷元素如锆，作为强Lewis碱，可以影响催化剂表面的反应性。掺杂可以减少由Ni空位引起的活性，使NiO成为更好的氧化剂。掺杂还会增加氧原子与氧化物表面的结合能，使其活性降低。这对于乙烷到乙烯的氧化脱氢过程是有益的，可能提高选择性。理论建模的挑战在于准确预测反应机制，特别是考虑吸附在掺杂剂上的O2与表面O的竞争可能性。优化过程需要平衡效率、选择性和安全性，考虑到系统中其他物种（如苯乙烯或乙烯）的反应风险。实验的局限性、参数范围狭窄以及对讨论系统的特定计算缺乏，给全面理解并优化这些催化体系带来了挑战。
