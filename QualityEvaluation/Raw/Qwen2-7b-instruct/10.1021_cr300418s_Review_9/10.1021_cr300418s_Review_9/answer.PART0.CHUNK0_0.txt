12.2 Oxidative Dehydrogenation: Generalities

"The dehydrogenation reactions examined here are both described by the formula In one case R is a hydrogen atom, and in the other it is a phenyl group C6H5. Both reactions are endothermic, equilibrium limited, and take place at sufficiently high temperatures to require expensive technology."

"A much-pursued variant of this scheme is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using oxygen to form water: An alternative is to use CO2, to react with H2 and make CO and water (the reverse watergas shift reaction, RWGS):"

"To our knowledge, the first coupling of a dehydrogenation reaction with a hydrogen consuming reaction is the Deacon process, (383, 384) which can be viewed as a oxidative dehydrogenation of HCl (2HCl + 1/2O2  Cl2 + H2O)."

"A detailed comparison between ODH with O2 and with CO2 is best made separately, for each compound being dehydrogenated."

"While the idea of coupling dehydrogenation with a hydrogen consuming reaction is appealing, the performance of the catalysts studied so far is not good enough for commercial use."

The oxidative dehydrogenation reactions analyzed in the document involve the conversion of molecules with hydrogen or phenyl groups into their corresponding alkenes, often requiring high temperatures and expensive technology due to their endothermic nature. The document discusses the use of oxygen and carbon dioxide as oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), with oxygen forming water and carbon dioxide reacting with hydrogen to produce carbon monoxide and water. The Deacon process, which involves the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrochloric acid, is also mentioned as an example. Despite the potential benefits of coupling dehydrogenation reactions with hydrogen-consuming reactions, the performance of the catalysts developed so far has not met commercial standards.

在文档中分析的氧化脱氢反应涉及将具有氢或苯基团的分子转化为相应的烯烃，通常需要高温和昂贵的技术，由于它们是吸热的。文档讨论了使用氧气和二氧化碳作为氧化剂在氧化脱氢（ODH）中的应用，氧气形成水，二氧化碳与氢反应生成一氧化碳和水。描述了使用氯化氢进行氧化脱氢的Deacon过程的一个例子。尽管将脱氢反应与消耗氢的反应耦合有潜力，但目前开发的催化剂的性能尚未达到商业标准。

14.2 Ethylbenzene Dehydrogenation in the Presence of CO2, Catalyzed by Doped Oxides

"There is little work that attempted deliberately to prepare doped oxides and test them for ethylbenzene ODH with CO2. Ren et al. (415) studied TiO2 and TiO2 doped with Fe, V, Zr, and Mg, and Gao et al. (420) used ZrO2 and Ga-doped ZrO2."

"Doping with Fe increases substantially the area per gram even though the doped and the undoped oxide were prepared by the same solgel method, under identical conditions (except for the presence of the precursor for the dopant)."

"The reactivity of these catalysts, for ethylbenzene ODH with CO2 as oxidant, was measured at a temperature of 550 C, a pressure of 0.1 MPa, W/F = 40 gcat h/mol, a CO2/ethylbenzene ratio of 1:1, and a flow rate of 50 mL/min. The best ethylbenzene conversion, obtained with Fe3Ti, was 19.3% with a styrene yield of 18.6%."

"Aside from low conversion, a further disappointment is the low stability of the catalyst: the conversion drops from 19.4% to 8.6% after 2 h on stream."

"Gao et al. (420) prepared Ga-doped ZrO2 by coprecipitation."

"The conversion of ethylbenzene catalyzed by ZrO2 is 16.8%, and the selectivity is 100%, which gives a styrene yield of 16.8%."

There is limited research on intentionally synthesizing doped oxides and testing their performance in ethylbenzene oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with carbon dioxide. Researchers Ren et al. (415) and Gao et al. (420) investigated titanium dioxide (TiO2) doped with iron, vanadium, zirconium, and magnesium, and zirconia (ZrO2) doped with gallium (Ga). Adding iron to TiO2 significantly increased the surface area per gram. The catalysts' reactivity in ethylbenzene ODH with carbon dioxide was evaluated at 550°C, 0.1 MPa, a weight-to-flow ratio of 40 gcat h/mol, a CO2-to-ethylbenzene ratio of 1:1, and a flow rate of 50 mL/min. The highest ethylbenzene conversion, achieved with Fe3Ti, was 19.3%, with a styrene yield of 18.6%. However, the catalysts showed low conversion and stability, with the conversion dropping from 19.4% to 8.6% within 2 hours of operation. Gao et al. synthesized Ga-doped ZrO2 via coprecipitation. The ethylbenzene conversion with ZrO2 was 16.8%, resulting in a styrene yield of 16.8% and 100% selectivity.

在文档中，关于有意合成掺杂氧化物并测试其在乙苯CO2氧化脱氢（ODH）中的性能的研究工作较少。研究人员Ren et al.（415）和Gao et al.（420）研究了掺铁、钒、锆和镁的二氧化钛（TiO2），以及掺镓（Ga）的氧化锆（ZrO2）。向TiO2中添加铁显著增加了每克的表面面积。在550°C、0.1 MPa、重量与流速比为40 gcat h/mol、CO2与乙苯比例为1:1、流量速率50 mL/min的条件下，对这些催化剂在乙苯ODH中的反应活性进行了评估。Fe3Ti实现了最高的乙苯转化率19.3%，同时得到的对苯乙烯产率为18.6%。然而，这些催化剂显示出低转化率和稳定性，在2小时内操作后，转化率从19.4%下降到8.6%。Gao et al.通过共沉淀法合成了Ga掺杂的ZrO2。以ZrO2催化乙苯时，转化率为16.8%，对苯乙烯产率为16.8%，选择性为100%。

16 Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane to Ethylene

"We dedicate substantial space to ethane ODH on NiO or doped NiO catalysts because they are the most extensively studied doped-oxide catalysts for this reaction. (126, 127, 437-441)"

"Pacchionis calculations (454) show that if a Ni vacancy is present on the (100) surface of NiO, two holes are localized on the oxygen atoms. However, NiO is particularly easy to cleave (159) along the (100) surface, and this suggests that this is not a reactive face."

"Wu et al. (126) have prepared Zr-doped NiO and undoped NiO by a solgel method. Citric acid was added slowly to an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O. The solvent was evaporated at 70 C until a gel was formed. This was dried at 120 C for 24 h and then calcined in air at 450 C for 6 h."

"The XRD measurements found that 5Zr and 10Zr have the structure of NiO. The notation 5Zr indicates Zr-doped NiO with the molar ratio 100 Zr/(Zr+Ni) = 5. The lattice parameter of NiO increased with the addition of Zr, whose ionic radius (0.72 Å) is larger than that of Ni (0.69 Å)."

我们专门分配大量篇幅来研究乙烷ODH在NiO或掺杂NiO催化剂上的应用，因为这是此类反应中最广泛研究的掺杂氧化物催化剂。 （126, 127, 437-441）Pacchioni的计算（454）显示，如果镍空位存在于NiO的（100）表面上，则两个空穴会定位在氧原子上。然而，NiO特别容易沿着（100）表面断裂（159），这表明这不是一个活性表面。Wu et al.（126）采用溶胶凝胶法合成了Zr掺杂的NiO和未掺杂的NiO。他们逐渐向Ni(NO3)2·6H2O和Zr(NO3)4·5H2O溶液中加入柠檬酸。然后蒸发溶剂直至形成凝胶，再于120°C干燥24小时，并在450°C下空气煅烧6小时。X射线衍射（XRD）测量发现5Zr和10Zr具有NiO结构。5Zr表示Zr掺杂的NiO，其摩尔比为100 Zr/(Zr + Ni) = 5。NiO的晶格参数随Zr的添加而增加，Zr的离子半径（0.72 Å）大于Ni（0.69 Å）。
