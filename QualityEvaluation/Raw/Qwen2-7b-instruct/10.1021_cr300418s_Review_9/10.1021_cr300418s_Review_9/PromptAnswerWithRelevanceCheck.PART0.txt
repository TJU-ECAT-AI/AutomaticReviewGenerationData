12.2 Oxidative Dehydrogenation: Generalities

"The dehydrogenation reactions examined here are both described by the formula In one case R is a hydrogen atom, and in the other it is a phenyl group C6H5. Both reactions are endothermic, equilibrium limited, and take place at sufficiently high temperatures to require expensive technology."

"A much-pursued variant of this scheme is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using oxygen to form water: An alternative is to use CO2, to react with H2 and make CO and water (the reverse watergas shift reaction, RWGS):"

"To our knowledge, the first coupling of a dehydrogenation reaction with a hydrogen consuming reaction is the Deacon process, (383, 384) which can be viewed as a oxidative dehydrogenation of HCl (2HCl + 1/2O2  Cl2 + H2O)."

"A detailed comparison between ODH with O2 and with CO2 is best made separately, for each compound being dehydrogenated."

"While the idea of coupling dehydrogenation with a hydrogen consuming reaction is appealing, the performance of the catalysts studied so far is not good enough for commercial use."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The oxidative dehydrogenation reactions analyzed in the document involve the conversion of molecules with hydrogen or phenyl groups into their corresponding alkenes, often requiring high temperatures and expensive technology due to their endothermic nature. The document discusses the use of oxygen and carbon dioxide as oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), with oxygen forming water and carbon dioxide reacting with hydrogen to produce carbon monoxide and water. The Deacon process, which involves the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrochloric acid, is also mentioned as an example. Despite the potential benefits of coupling dehydrogenation reactions with hydrogen-consuming reactions, the performance of the catalysts developed so far has not met commercial standards.

14.2 Ethylbenzene Dehydrogenation in the Presence of CO2, Catalyzed by Doped Oxides

"There is little work that attempted deliberately to prepare doped oxides and test them for ethylbenzene ODH with CO2. Ren et al. (415) studied TiO2 and TiO2 doped with Fe, V, Zr, and Mg, and Gao et al. (420) used ZrO2 and Ga-doped ZrO2."

"Doping with Fe increases substantially the area per gram even though the doped and the undoped oxide were prepared by the same solgel method, under identical conditions (except for the presence of the precursor for the dopant)."

"The reactivity of these catalysts, for ethylbenzene ODH with CO2 as oxidant, was measured at a temperature of 550 C, a pressure of 0.1 MPa, W/F = 40 gcat h/mol, a CO2/ethylbenzene ratio of 1:1, and a flow rate of 50 mL/min. The best ethylbenzene conversion, obtained with Fe3Ti, was 19.3% with a styrene yield of 18.6%."

"Aside from low conversion, a further disappointment is the low stability of the catalyst: the conversion drops from 19.4% to 8.6% after 2 h on stream."

"Gao et al. (420) prepared Ga-doped ZrO2 by coprecipitation."

"The conversion of ethylbenzene catalyzed by ZrO2 is 16.8%, and the selectivity is 100%, which gives a styrene yield of 16.8%."

There is limited research on intentionally synthesizing doped oxides and testing their performance in ethylbenzene oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with carbon dioxide. Researchers Ren et al. (415) and Gao et al. (420) investigated titanium dioxide (TiO2) doped with iron, vanadium, zirconium, and magnesium, and zirconia (ZrO2) doped with gallium (Ga). Adding iron to TiO2 significantly increased the surface area per gram. The catalysts' reactivity in ethylbenzene ODH with carbon dioxide was evaluated at 550°C, 0.1 MPa, a weight-to-flow ratio of 40 gcat h/mol, a CO2-to-ethylbenzene ratio of 1:1, and a flow rate of 50 mL/min. The highest ethylbenzene conversion, achieved with Fe3Ti, was 19.3%, with a styrene yield of 18.6%. However, the catalysts showed low conversion and stability, with the conversion dropping from 19.4% to 8.6% within 2 hours of operation. Gao et al. synthesized Ga-doped ZrO2 via coprecipitation. The ethylbenzene conversion with ZrO2 was 16.8%, resulting in a styrene yield of 16.8% and 100% selectivity.

16 Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane to Ethylene

"We dedicate substantial space to ethane ODH on NiO or doped NiO catalysts because they are the most extensively studied doped-oxide catalysts for this reaction. (126, 127, 437-441)"

"Pacchionis calculations (454) show that if a Ni vacancy is present on the (100) surface of NiO, two holes are localized on the oxygen atoms. However, NiO is particularly easy to cleave (159) along the (100) surface, and this suggests that this is not a reactive face."

"Wu et al. (126) have prepared Zr-doped NiO and undoped NiO by a solgel method. Citric acid was added slowly to an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O. The solvent was evaporated at 70 C until a gel was formed. This was dried at 120 C for 24 h and then calcined in air at 450 C for 6 h."

"The XRD measurements found that 5Zr and 10Zr have the structure of NiO. The notation 5Zr indicates Zr-doped NiO with the molar ratio 100 Zr/(Zr+Ni) = 5. The lattice parameter of NiO increased with the addition of Zr, whose ionic radius (0.72 Å) is larger than that of Ni (0.69 Å)."

The solvent was evaporated at 70°C until a gel was formed, which was then dried at 120°C for 24 hours and calcined in air at 450°C for 6 hours.

我们专门分配大量篇幅来研究乙烷ODH在NiO或掺杂NiO催化剂上的应用，因为这是此类反应中最广泛研究的掺杂氧化物催化剂。 （126, 127, 437-441）Pacchioni的计算（454）显示，如果镍空位存在于NiO的（100）表面上，则两个空穴会定位在氧原子上。然而，NiO特别容易沿着（100）表面断裂（159），这表明这不是一个活性表面。Wu et al.（126）采用溶胶凝胶法合成了Zr掺杂的NiO和未掺杂的NiO。他们逐渐向Ni(NO3)2·6H2O和Zr(NO3)4·5H2O溶液中加入柠檬酸。然后蒸发溶剂直至形成凝胶，再于120°C干燥24小时，并在450°C下空气煅烧6小时。X射线衍射（XRD）测量发现5Zr和10Zr具有NiO结构。5Zr表示Zr掺杂的NiO，其摩尔比为100 Zr/(Zr + Ni) = 5。NiO的晶格参数随Zr的添加而增加，Zr的离子半径（0.72 Å）大于Ni（0.69 Å）。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The electronic structure changes due to the doping of high-valence elements like zirconium, which can act as strong Lewis bases, affecting the reactivity of the catalyst surface. The introduction of dopants can decrease the reactivity caused by Ni vacancies, which makes NiO a better oxidant. The presence of dopants also increases the binding energy of oxygen atoms to the oxide surface, making them less reactive. This is beneficial for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, potentially improving selectivity. Challenges in theoretical modeling involve accurately predicting the mechanism of the reaction, especially considering the possibility of O2 adsorption on the dopant, which can compete with the reaction with surface O. Process optimization requires balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety, considering the potential for reactions with other species in the system, such as styrene or ethylene. The limited scope of experiments, narrow range of parameters, and the lack of specific calculations for the systems discussed in the literature pose challenges in fully understanding and optimizing these catalytic systems.

在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成会影响其电子结构和催化性能。掺入高电荷元素如锆，作为强Lewis碱，可以影响催化剂表面的反应性。掺杂可以减少由Ni空位引起的活性，使NiO成为更好的氧化剂。掺杂还会增加氧原子与氧化物表面的结合能，使其活性降低。这对于乙烷到乙烯的氧化脱氢过程是有益的，可能提高选择性。理论建模的挑战在于准确预测反应机制，特别是考虑吸附在掺杂剂上的O2与表面O的竞争可能性。优化过程需要平衡效率、选择性和安全性，考虑到系统中其他物种（如苯乙烯或乙烯）的反应风险。实验的局限性、参数范围狭窄以及对讨论系统的特定计算缺乏，给全面理解并优化这些催化体系带来了挑战。

14.2.1 Experimental Results
"The best ethylbenzene conversion, obtained with Fe3Ti, was 19.3% with a styrene yield of 18.6%."
"However, the area per gram of Fe3Ti is 98 m2/g, while that of TiO2 is 21.7 m2/g."
"Fe3Ti is about as active as TiO2; the main effect of the dopant on conversion is to increase the area per gram."
"ZrO2 doped with Ga is a worse catalyst than ZrO2, and both have very low performance."
"Ren et al. (415) prepared TiO2 doped with Fe, V, Zr, and Mg. Among these, Fe3Ti is most active."
"Among these, Fe3Ti is most active."
"The best catalyst in this group is Ni0.1Ce0.9O2, which gives an ethylbenzene conversion of 70% and a selectivity to styrene of 75%, at a temperature of 450 C, O2/ethylbenzene ratio = 0.8, and space velocity = 250 mL/gcat/min."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, doping with low-valence dopants increases the specific area of the catalyst, enhancing its performance in ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene conversions. However, the stability of the catalysts is a challenge, as evidenced by the decrease in conversion over time. Theoretical modeling struggles to accurately predict the mechanisms of reaction, especially regarding the reactivity of the doped oxides with alkanes. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems is complex, requiring optimization of both the catalyst preparation and the reaction conditions. In ethane to ethylene reactions, doping with zirconium improves selectivity, as it binds surface oxygen more strongly to the oxide, potentially limiting the reactivity with ethane while enhancing selectivity towards ethylene. Theoretical models often fail to capture the specifics of oxygen vacancy formation and its impact on the reactivity of the catalyst surface.

在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成影响其电子结构和催化性能。具体来说，低价掺杂可以增加催化剂的特定面积，从而提高乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯转化的性能。然而，催化剂的稳定性是一个挑战，催化剂的转化率会随时间逐渐下降。理论建模难以准确预测反应机制，特别是关于掺杂氧化物与烷烃的反应活性。平衡催化系统的效率、选择性和安全性是复杂的，需要优化催化剂的制备和反应条件。在乙烷到乙烯反应中，锆掺杂提高了选择性，因为它使表面氧原子与氧化物更牢固地结合，可能限制了与乙烷的反应活性，同时增强了对乙烯的选择性。理论模型往往无法捕捉到氧化物表面氧空位形成及其对反应活性的影响。
