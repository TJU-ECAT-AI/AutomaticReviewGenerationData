[V] "Conclusions"
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The conclusions summarize the findings on the electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel oxide-based catalysts influenced by preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>
<ChineseVersionAnswer>
结论总结了制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对镍氧化物基催化剂的电子结构和催化性能的影响发现。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

The literature focuses on the theoretical investigation of cationic and anionic vacancies on the NiO(100) surface using computational methods such as DFT + U and hybrid functional density functional theory. It does not provide direct information on how preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation influence the electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel oxide-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it address the key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.
