The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the specific effects of preparation methods and dopant concentrations on the electronic structure and how these factors correlate with the catalytic activity and selectivity. Theoretical models often struggle with accurately predicting the complex interactions between the catalyst, reactants, and products due to the high dimensionality of the problem space and the need for precise quantum mechanical calculations. Process optimization requires a balance between achieving high conversion rates while maintaining high selectivity and minimizing side reactions, which can be challenging to achieve simultaneously. Ensuring the safety of the process involves managing potential hazards associated with the use of reactive materials and the conditions under which they operate. Balancing these factors often necessitates iterative testing and refinement of the catalyst design and operational parameters based on experimental data and theoretical predictions.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成可以显著影响它们在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能。这些催化系统理论建模、过程优化以及平衡效率、选择性和安全性时的关键挑战包括理解特定制备方法和掺杂浓度对电子结构的影响，以及这些因素与催化活性和选择性之间的关系。理论模型往往难以准确预测复杂相互作用的问题空间，特别是由于量子力学计算的精确性需求。过程优化需要在实现高转化率的同时保持高选择性，并尽量减少副反应，这通常是一个同时实现这些目标的挑战。确保过程安全涉及管理使用反应性材料及其操作条件相关的潜在风险。平衡这些因素通常需要基于实验数据和理论预测的催化剂设计和操作参数的迭代测试和改进。
