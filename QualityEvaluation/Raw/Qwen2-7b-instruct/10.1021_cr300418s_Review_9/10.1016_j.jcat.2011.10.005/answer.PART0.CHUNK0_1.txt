Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydronation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility. At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO. This geometric effect is supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings.

Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability. The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst.

The surface areas of the resulting materials increase significantly when Niobium is incorporated in the solgel method at similar loadings as those published. The material containing only 5 at.% Nb readily displays a surface area of 130 m2/g, which increases with increasing Nb loading until it reaches a maximum at 225 m2/g for Nb0.15Ni0.85O. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest surface area ever reported for such oxides.

With these systems, the ethene yields systematically decrease with increasing Nb content. This decrease occurs despite the higher surface area of the Nb-containing samples, as compared with that of NiO_SG. The low ethene yields result from a much lower intrinsic activity of the Nb-containing nickel oxides, as compared with that of NiO_SG. This could be explained by the presence of a Nb-based thin layer on the NiO crystallite surface, which prevents access to part of O active species.

Ethene yields obtained over these materials are very similar to those obtained on 48 m2/g NiO_SG. The two formulations containing the smallest NiO crystallites (7 nm) and the largest lattice parameter (4.184 Å), Nb0.03Ni0.97O and Nb0.04Ni0.96O, however, seem slightly more efficient. This is confirmed by decreasing the amount of oxygen in the reactant feed, i.e., by performing ethane ODH in the presence of 5 vol.% instead of 10 vol.% O2.

1. The preparation method, dopant concentration, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting their redox properties. The presence of the Nb-rich phase inhibits NiO reducibility, leading to less activity but increased selectivity. The Nb-rich phase likely covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO, affecting the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The close interaction between NiO and the Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, along with possible restructuration under ODH conditions, results in significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings. The optimal Nb content is 34 at.% for the most efficient catalyst, which combines high activity, selectivity, and stability.

2. Incorporating Niobium in the solgel method at similar loadings as published increases the surface area of the resulting materials. The surface area increases from 130 m2/g for 5 at.% Nb to a maximum of 225 m2/g for Nb0.15Ni0.85O, surpassing previously reported values.

3. The catalysts with higher Nb content exhibit lower intrinsic activity, leading to decreased ethene yields, even though their surface areas are higher. The presence of a Nb-based thin layer on the NiO crystallite surface likely prevents access to part of the active oxygen species, contributing to the decrease in intrinsic activity.

4. The formulations containing the smallest NiO crystallites (7 nm) and the largest lattice parameter (4.184 Å) seem slightly more efficient in ethane ODH. This efficiency is confirmed by performing the reaction in the presence of 5 vol.% O2 instead of 10 vol.% O2, where the ethene yields are higher.

1. 准备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对镍氧化物基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能产生影响，主要通过影响它们的还原性。铌富集相的存在抑制了镍氧化物的还原性，导致活性降低但选择性增加。铌富集相可能覆盖了部分非选择性的非等摩尔活性氧物种，影响了催化剂的活性和选择性。镍氧化物与铌富集混合氧化物层之间的紧密相互作用，以及在脱氢条件下可能的重构，导致高Nb负载时催化剂显著失活。最优的Nb含量为34原子%，这种催化剂结合了高活性、高选择性和稳定性。

2. 在溶胶凝胶法中以已发表的负载量添加铌，材料的表面积显著增加。从仅含5原子%Nb的样品开始，其表面积达到130 m2/g，随着Nb含量的增加，表面积增加至Nb0.15Ni0.85O的最大值225 m2/g，超过了之前报告的最高值。

3. 含有更高Nb含量的催化剂表现出较低的内在活性，导致乙烯产率下降，尽管它们的表面积更高。铌基薄层在镍氧化物晶粒表面的存在可能阻止了部分活性氧物种的访问，从而导致内在活性的降低。

4. 包含最小镍氧化物晶粒（7纳米）和最大晶格参数（4.184 Å）的配方在乙烷脱氢中表现出更高的效率。这一效率在使用5体积%氧气代替10体积%氧气的情况下得到确认，此时的乙烯产率较高。
