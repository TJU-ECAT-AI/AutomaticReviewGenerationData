<p>Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility.</p>
<p>At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO.</p>
<p>The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst.</p>
<p>Despite lower surface area (48 m2/g) and presence of <1 wt.% Ni metal, NiO_SG exhibits a higher efficiency than NiO_NH4OH, which is similar to that displayed by NiO_oxalic acid. The intrinsic activity of NiO_SG, in terms of number of mole of ethane converted per surface unit per time unit, is similar to that reported for nickel oxides prepared by the evaporation method.</p>
<p>By incorporating Niobium in the solgel method at similar loading (520 at.%) as those published, the surface areas of the resulting materials increase significantly. The material containing only 5 at.% Nb readily displays a surface area of 130 m2/g, which increases with increasing Nb loading until it reaches a maximum at 225 m2/g for Nb0.15Ni0.85O.</p>
<p>The significant increase in surface areas can be explained, on the other hand, by the presence of a less dense, amorphous NixNbyO phase, with a concentration that increases with increasing Niobium content.</p>
<p>At lower Nb contents (<4 at.%), the overall morphology of the Nb Ni oxides consists in 2030-nm particles with a spherical shape, which are similar to those displayed by NiO_SG and highly loaded Nb1xNixO.</p>

1. The redox properties and nanoscale size of the nickel oxide catalysts play a crucial role in their activity during ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The presence of the niobium-rich phase inhibits the reducibility of nickel oxide, affecting its catalytic performance.

2. Incorporating niobium into the solgel method enhances the surface area of the catalysts, reaching a maximum of 225 m2/g at a niobium content of 15 at.%. This increase in surface area is attributed to the presence of an amorphous niobium-rich oxide phase.

3. At lower niobium contents, the catalysts exhibit a spherical morphology similar to that of NiO_SG, indicating a potential effect of niobium on reducing the aggregation of nickel oxide crystallites.

4. The efficiency of catalysts decreases with increasing niobium content, but selectivity improves. This is believed to be due to the niobium-rich phase covering part of the non-stoichiometric, unselective active oxygen sites on the nickel oxide.

5. The optimization of the preparation method for the catalysts leads to significant improvements in their structural and catalytic properties, suggesting further advancements in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation are possible.

1. 这些纳米氧化物在低温乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的活性与其还原性有关。除了限制镍氧化物晶粒的大小，铌丰富的相还抑制了镍氧化物的还原性。

2. 当铌含量超过5原子%，含铌镍复合材料的乙烷ODH活性降低但选择性提高，表明铌丰富的相可能覆盖了镍氧化物中不选择性、非等价的活性氧物种的一部分。

3. 通过在溶胶凝胶方法中加入铌，达到与已发表文献中类似负载（520原子%）时，催化剂的表面面积显著增加。仅含5原子%铌的材料显示出了130 m2/g的高表面面积，并随着铌含量的增加而增加，直至达到最大值225 m2/g（铌0.15镍0.85氧化物）。

4. 表面面积的显著增加归因于存在一种较疏松的、无定形NiNb氧化物相，其浓度随铌含量的增加而增加。

5. 在较低的铌含量下，铌镍氧化物的形态呈现出20至30纳米的球形颗粒，与NiO_SG和高度加载的Nb1xNixO相似，这表明铌可能对镍氧化物结晶体的聚集产生了影响。

6. 随着铌含量的增加，催化剂的效率降低但选择性提高。这种现象可能是由于铌丰富的相覆盖了镍氧化物表面的部分不选择性、非等价的活性氧物种。

7. 催化剂制备方法的优化导致了其结构和催化性质的显著改善，这表明进一步改进乙烷氧化脱氢过程的可能性。
