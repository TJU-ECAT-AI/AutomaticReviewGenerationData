1. The preparation method for NiO and NbNiO nanocomposites involves the slow oxidation of a nickel-rich NbNi gel obtained in citric acid. This method leads to materials with higher surface areas than those produced via the conventional evaporation method. The activity of these nanooxides in the low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane is linked to their redox properties, and the presence of the Nb-rich phase restricts the reducibility of NiO.

2. The Nb-rich phase in the nanocomposites affects the redox properties of the NiO, influencing the catalytic performance of the nanocomposites. Specifically, at Nb contents above 5 atomic percent, the NbNiO composites exhibit reduced activity in ethane ODH but enhanced selectivity. This suggests that the Nb-rich phase likely covers non-stoichiometric, unselective active oxygen species of NiO, affecting the geometric structure of the catalyst.

3. The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites indicates that optimizing the catalyst could lead to further improvements in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH. This is because the preparation method influences the surface area, morphology, and redox properties of the catalysts, which are crucial factors determining their performance in ethane ODH.

1. NiO和NbNiO纳米复合材料的制备方法基于柠檬酸中获得的镍富集NbNi凝胶的缓慢氧化。这种方法导致的材料表面面积比通过镍硝酸盐和四水合铌氧酸铵蒸发法得到的材料更高。这些纳米氧化物在低温乙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）中的活性与其还原性性质有关，Nb丰富的相的存在限制了NiO的还原性。

2.Nb丰富的相在纳米复合材料中影响NiO的还原性，从而影响催化剂的性能。具体而言，在Nb含量大于5原子百分比时，NbNiO复合物在乙烷ODH中的活性降低但选择性增强。这表明Nb丰富的相可能覆盖NiO的非选择性、非等摩尔活性氧物种，影响催化剂的几何结构，进而影响其性能。

3. 制备方法对NbNiO纳米复合材料的结构和催化性能的影响表明，优化催化剂可以进一步提高NiO催化乙烷ODH的性能。这是因为制备方法影响催化剂的表面面积、形态和还原性，这些都是决定其在乙烷ODH性能的关键因素。
