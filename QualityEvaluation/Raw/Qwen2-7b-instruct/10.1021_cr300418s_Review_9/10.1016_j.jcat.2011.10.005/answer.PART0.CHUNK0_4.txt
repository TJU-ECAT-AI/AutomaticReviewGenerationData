[1] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehy- drogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."
[2] "The presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."
[3] "At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."
[4] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts affect their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by influencing their redox properties. The presence of a Nb-rich phase inhibits NiO reducibility, leading to a trade-off between activity and selectivity. As Nb content increases, catalyst activity decreases but selectivity improves, suggesting that the Nb-rich phase covers non-stoichiometric active oxygen species of NiO. Optimizing the catalyst preparation method could lead to further improvements in NiO-catalyzed ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

在制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成的影响下，镍氧化物基催化剂的电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能通过影响其还原性性质受到影响。Nb丰富的相抑制了NiO的可还原性，导致活性与选择性之间的权衡。随着Nb含量的增加，催化剂活性降低但选择性提高，表明Nb丰富的相覆盖了NiO中的非等价活性氧物种。优化催化剂制备方法可能会导致进一步改善NiO催化的乙烷氧化脱氢。
