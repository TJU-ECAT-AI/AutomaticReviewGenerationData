1. The preparation method for NiO and NbNiO nanocomposites involves the slow oxidation of a nickel-rich NbNi gel obtained in citric acid. This method leads to materials with higher surface areas than those produced via the conventional evaporation method. The activity of these nanooxides in the low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane is linked to their redox properties, and the presence of the Nb-rich phase restricts the reducibility of NiO.

2. The Nb-rich phase in the nanocomposites affects the redox properties of the NiO, influencing the catalytic performance of the nanocomposites. Specifically, at Nb contents above 5 atomic percent, the NbNiO composites exhibit reduced activity in ethane ODH but enhanced selectivity. This suggests that the Nb-rich phase likely covers non-stoichiometric, unselective active oxygen species of NiO, affecting the geometric structure of the catalyst.

3. The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites indicates that optimizing the catalyst could lead to further improvements in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH. This is because the preparation method influences the surface area, morphology, and redox properties of the catalysts, which are crucial factors determining their performance in ethane ODH.

1. NiO和NbNiO纳米复合材料的制备方法基于柠檬酸中获得的镍富集NbNi凝胶的缓慢氧化。这种方法导致的材料表面面积比通过镍硝酸盐和四水合铌氧酸铵蒸发法得到的材料更高。这些纳米氧化物在低温乙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）中的活性与其还原性性质有关，Nb丰富的相的存在限制了NiO的还原性。

2.Nb丰富的相在纳米复合材料中影响NiO的还原性，从而影响催化剂的性能。具体而言，在Nb含量大于5原子百分比时，NbNiO复合物在乙烷ODH中的活性降低但选择性增强。这表明Nb丰富的相可能覆盖NiO的非选择性、非等摩尔活性氧物种，影响催化剂的几何结构，进而影响其性能。

3. 制备方法对NbNiO纳米复合材料的结构和催化性能的影响表明，优化催化剂可以进一步提高NiO催化乙烷ODH的性能。这是因为制备方法影响催化剂的表面面积、形态和还原性，这些都是决定其在乙烷ODH性能的关键因素。

Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydronation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility. At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO. This geometric effect is supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings.

Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability. The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst.

The surface areas of the resulting materials increase significantly when Niobium is incorporated in the solgel method at similar loadings as those published. The material containing only 5 at.% Nb readily displays a surface area of 130 m2/g, which increases with increasing Nb loading until it reaches a maximum at 225 m2/g for Nb0.15Ni0.85O. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest surface area ever reported for such oxides.

With these systems, the ethene yields systematically decrease with increasing Nb content. This decrease occurs despite the higher surface area of the Nb-containing samples, as compared with that of NiO_SG. The low ethene yields result from a much lower intrinsic activity of the Nb-containing nickel oxides, as compared with that of NiO_SG. This could be explained by the presence of a Nb-based thin layer on the NiO crystallite surface, which prevents access to part of O active species.

Ethene yields obtained over these materials are very similar to those obtained on 48 m2/g NiO_SG. The two formulations containing the smallest NiO crystallites (7 nm) and the largest lattice parameter (4.184 Å), Nb0.03Ni0.97O and Nb0.04Ni0.96O, however, seem slightly more efficient. This is confirmed by decreasing the amount of oxygen in the reactant feed, i.e., by performing ethane ODH in the presence of 5 vol.% instead of 10 vol.% O2.

1. The preparation method, dopant concentration, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting their redox properties. The presence of the Nb-rich phase inhibits NiO reducibility, leading to less activity but increased selectivity. The Nb-rich phase likely covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO, affecting the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The close interaction between NiO and the Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, along with possible restructuration under ODH conditions, results in significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings. The optimal Nb content is 34 at.% for the most efficient catalyst, which combines high activity, selectivity, and stability.

2. Incorporating Niobium in the solgel method at similar loadings as published increases the surface area of the resulting materials. The surface area increases from 130 m2/g for 5 at.% Nb to a maximum of 225 m2/g for Nb0.15Ni0.85O, surpassing previously reported values.

3. The catalysts with higher Nb content exhibit lower intrinsic activity, leading to decreased ethene yields, even though their surface areas are higher. The presence of a Nb-based thin layer on the NiO crystallite surface likely prevents access to part of the active oxygen species, contributing to the decrease in intrinsic activity.

4. The formulations containing the smallest NiO crystallites (7 nm) and the largest lattice parameter (4.184 Å) seem slightly more efficient in ethane ODH. This efficiency is confirmed by performing the reaction in the presence of 5 vol.% O2 instead of 10 vol.% O2, where the ethene yields are higher.

1. 准备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对镍氧化物基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能产生影响，主要通过影响它们的还原性。铌富集相的存在抑制了镍氧化物的还原性，导致活性降低但选择性增加。铌富集相可能覆盖了部分非选择性的非等摩尔活性氧物种，影响了催化剂的活性和选择性。镍氧化物与铌富集混合氧化物层之间的紧密相互作用，以及在脱氢条件下可能的重构，导致高Nb负载时催化剂显著失活。最优的Nb含量为34原子%，这种催化剂结合了高活性、高选择性和稳定性。

2. 在溶胶凝胶法中以已发表的负载量添加铌，材料的表面积显著增加。从仅含5原子%Nb的样品开始，其表面积达到130 m2/g，随着Nb含量的增加，表面积增加至Nb0.15Ni0.85O的最大值225 m2/g，超过了之前报告的最高值。

3. 含有更高Nb含量的催化剂表现出较低的内在活性，导致乙烯产率下降，尽管它们的表面积更高。铌基薄层在镍氧化物晶粒表面的存在可能阻止了部分活性氧物种的访问，从而导致内在活性的降低。

4. 包含最小镍氧化物晶粒（7纳米）和最大晶格参数（4.184 Å）的配方在乙烷脱氢中表现出更高的效率。这一效率在使用5体积%氧气代替10体积%氧气的情况下得到确认，此时的乙烯产率较高。

The preparation of NiO and NbNiO nanocomposites affects their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, particularly ethane to ethylene. The method used to synthesize the catalysts, the concentration of the dopant niobium, and the formation of vacancies in the nickel oxide influence the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability. The redox properties of the nanooxides play a crucial role in their efficiency for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Further improvements in the catalyst can be expected by optimizing the preparation method. The niobium-rich phase inhibits the reducibility of the nickel oxide, affecting the catalyst's activity. The close interaction between nickel oxide and the niobium-rich layer, along with possible restructuring under oxidative dehydrogenation conditions, leads to catalyst deactivation at high niobium loadings. Optimal levels of niobium doping result in high efficiency and selectivity in low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

1. The redox properties and nanoscale size of the nickel oxide catalysts play a crucial role in their activity during ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The presence of the niobium-rich phase inhibits the reducibility of nickel oxide, affecting its catalytic performance.

2. Incorporating niobium into the solgel method enhances the surface area of the catalysts, reaching a maximum of 225 m2/g at a niobium content of 15 at.%. This increase in surface area is attributed to the presence of an amorphous niobium-rich oxide phase.

3. At lower niobium contents, the catalysts exhibit a spherical morphology similar to that of NiO_SG, indicating a potential effect of niobium on reducing the aggregation of nickel oxide crystallites.

4. The efficiency of catalysts decreases with increasing niobium content, but selectivity improves. This is believed to be due to the niobium-rich phase covering part of the non-stoichiometric, unselective active oxygen sites on the nickel oxide.

5. The optimization of the preparation method for the catalysts leads to significant improvements in their structural and catalytic properties, suggesting further advancements in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation are possible.

1. 这些纳米氧化物在低温乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的活性与其还原性有关。除了限制镍氧化物晶粒的大小，铌丰富的相还抑制了镍氧化物的还原性。

2. 当铌含量超过5原子%，含铌镍复合材料的乙烷ODH活性降低但选择性提高，表明铌丰富的相可能覆盖了镍氧化物中不选择性、非等价的活性氧物种的一部分。

3. 通过在溶胶凝胶方法中加入铌，达到与已发表文献中类似负载（520原子%）时，催化剂的表面面积显著增加。仅含5原子%铌的材料显示出了130 m2/g的高表面面积，并随着铌含量的增加而增加，直至达到最大值225 m2/g（铌0.15镍0.85氧化物）。

4. 表面面积的显著增加归因于存在一种较疏松的、无定形NiNb氧化物相，其浓度随铌含量的增加而增加。

5. 在较低的铌含量下，铌镍氧化物的形态呈现出20至30纳米的球形颗粒，与NiO_SG和高度加载的Nb1xNixO相似，这表明铌可能对镍氧化物结晶体的聚集产生了影响。

6. 随着铌含量的增加，催化剂的效率降低但选择性提高。这种现象可能是由于铌丰富的相覆盖了镍氧化物表面的部分不选择性、非等价的活性氧物种。

7. 催化剂制备方法的优化导致了其结构和催化性质的显著改善，这表明进一步改进乙烷氧化脱氢过程的可能性。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts affect their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by influencing their redox properties. The presence of a Nb-rich phase inhibits NiO reducibility, leading to a trade-off between activity and selectivity. As Nb content increases, catalyst activity decreases but selectivity improves, suggesting that the Nb-rich phase covers non-stoichiometric active oxygen species of NiO. Optimizing the catalyst preparation method could lead to further improvements in NiO-catalyzed ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.
