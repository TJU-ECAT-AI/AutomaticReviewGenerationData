[1] "A method for the preparation of NiO and NbNiO nanocomposites is developed, based on the slow oxidation of a nickel-rich NbNi gel obtained in citric acid."
[2] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydronation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties."
[3] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."
[4] "The presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility."
[5] "This close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."
[6] "The optimum levels of Nb doping is reduced, and results in both high efficiency (conversion  selectivity) and high stability in low-temperature ethane ODH."

The preparation of NiO and NbNiO nanocomposites affects their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, particularly ethane to ethylene. The method used to synthesize the catalysts, the concentration of the dopant niobium, and the formation of vacancies in the nickel oxide influence the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability. The redox properties of the nanooxides play a crucial role in their efficiency for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Further improvements in the catalyst can be expected by optimizing the preparation method. The niobium-rich phase inhibits the reducibility of the nickel oxide, affecting the catalyst's activity. The close interaction between nickel oxide and the niobium-rich layer, along with possible restructuring under oxidative dehydrogenation conditions, leads to catalyst deactivation at high niobium loadings. Optimal levels of niobium doping result in high efficiency and selectivity in low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.
