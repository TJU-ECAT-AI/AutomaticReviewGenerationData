[1] "Although ceria does not show long range mesoscopic organization, it exhibits a broad arrangement of meso-pores in the region 20-80 Å with a maximum located at around 35-40 Å."
[2] "HRTEM detected very small crystalline CeO2 particles with an approximate dimension of 20-50 Å."
[3] "It is suggested that the cationic surfactant does not act as a true templating agent but as a surface-area enhancer by incorporation into the hydrous oxide and lowering of the surface tension of water in the pores during drying."
[4] "With conventional ceria, a drop in surface area is generally observed around 900 K, which brings the specific area to a few square meters per gram. With HSA CeO2 the surface area at 1073 K is stable at a value of ca 100 (see Table 2) for at least 40 h and drops to ca 40 m2/g at 1173 K."
[5] "The lack of a long-range ordered structure is also confirmed by microscopy studies."

The synthesis of mesoporous high-surface area ceria involves reacting cerium salts under basic conditions with ammonia in the presence of a cationic surfactant. This results in the precipitation of a gelatinous hydrous cerium oxide/surfactant mixture, which, after drying and calcination, yields pure, high surface area, fluorite-structured CeO2. The ceria exhibits a broad arrangement of meso-pores in the region 20-80 Å with a maximum at around 35-40 Å. The incorporation of the cationic surfactant enhances the surface area of ceria by acting as a surface-area enhancer rather than a true templating agent. The surfactant lowers the surface tension of water in the pores during drying, contributing to the enhancement of textural and thermal resistance features. The ceria prepared using this hybrid organic/inorganic route shows improved resistance to sintering and enhanced textural stability compared to ceria prepared by conventional methods. The surface area exceeds 200 m2/g after calcination at 723 K, dropping to approximately 40 m2/g after calcination at higher temperatures. This ceria has potential for use as a catalyst support or promoter in industrial catalytic processes, especially under medium/high temperature ranges.

合成介孔高表面积铈氧化物的方法是，在基本条件下，用氨水处理铈盐与阳离子表面活性剂。这导致了一种凝胶状的水合铈氧化物/表面活性剂混合物的沉淀，干燥和煅烧后，得到纯的、高表面积的氟化铈结构CeO2。铈氧化物在20-80 Å范围内展现出广泛的介孔分布，最大值位于约35-40 Å。阳离子表面活性剂通过作为表面面积增强剂的作用，而不是真正的模板剂，增强了铈氧化物的表面积。表面活性剂在干燥过程中降低了水在孔隙中的表面张力，对增强材料的纹理和热稳定性有贡献。使用这种有机/无机混合方法制备的铈氧化物显示出比传统方法制备的铈氧化物更好的热稳定性和增强的纹理稳定性。煅烧后，表面面积超过200 m2/g，达到723 K时，其值稳定在约100 m2/g，而在1173 K时降低至约40 m2/g。这种铈氧化物具有在中/高温范围内的催化剂支持或促进剂的潜力，特别是在控制移动源排放物的催化过程中。

文献描述了介孔高比表面积氧化铈的合成与表征。在基本条件下，铈盐与氨水以及阳离子表面活性剂反应生成胶状水合铈氧化物/表面活性剂混合物。干燥和煅烧此混合物后，得到纯度高、氟化结构的CeO2。尽管铈氧化物没有长程微观组织，但其表现出2080 Å范围内的广泛介孔结构，最大值位于约3540 Å。阳离子表面活性剂的引入可以增强铈氧化物的表面积。高表面积介孔氧化铈（HSA CeO2）的纹理特性优于传统铈氧化物，特别是在温度范围为9001200 K时。高温下表面面积的损失归因于晶粒尺寸的增加。阳离子表面活性剂不仅不作为真正的模板剂，而是通过融入水合氧化物并降低干燥过程中水孔的表面张力来作为表面积增强剂。在高温下，表面面积的损失是由于晶体粒径从723 K后的25 nm增加到1273 K后的30100 nm。

The synthesis and characterization of mesoporous high-surface-area ceria are detailed in the document. Although the ceria does not display long-range mesoscopic organization, it has a broad distribution of mesopores ranging from 2080 Å to 3540 Å. The surfactant plays a crucial role in promoting the oxidation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ and the formation of hydrous oxide in solution. This surfactant might also help to reduce the interfacial energy, decreasing capillary stress, thus contributing to the stability of the pore structure.

The synthesis method using a hybrid organic/inorganic route results in ceria with enhanced textural and thermal resistance features. The ceria exhibits a broad arrangement of meso-pores, with a maximum density at around 35-40 Å, rather than a long-range mesoscopic organization. The cationic surfactant acts as a surface-area enhancer by incorporating into the hydrous oxide and lowering the surface tension of water in the pores during drying. The pH of the reaction medium affects the surface area of the ceria; an increase in pH leads to an increase in surface area, and ceria prepared in the pH range of 9-11 shows better thermal resistance. The reaction mechanism is outlined in Scheme 2.
