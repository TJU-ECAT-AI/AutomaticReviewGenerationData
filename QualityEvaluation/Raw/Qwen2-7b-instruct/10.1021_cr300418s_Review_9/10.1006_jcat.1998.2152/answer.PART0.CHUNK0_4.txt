[1] "Although ceria does not show long range mesoscopic organization, it exhibits a broad arrangement of meso-pores in the region 20-80 Å with a maximum located at around 35-40 Å."
[2] "This ceria shows enhanced textural and thermal resistance features compared with ceria prepared by conventional routes."
[3] "It is suggested that the cationic surfactant does not act as a true templating agent but as a surface-area enhancer by incorporation into the hydrous oxide and lowering of the surface tension of water in the pores during drying."
[4] "The lack of a long-range ordered structure is also confirmed by microscopy studies."
[5] "By increasing the pH, an increase of the surface area of the fresh material is always observed; a better thermal resistance is evidenced for ceria prepared in the range of pH 9-11."
[6] "The approach we followed can be summarized by the reaction paths outlined in Scheme 2."

The synthesis method using a hybrid organic/inorganic route results in ceria with enhanced textural and thermal resistance features. The ceria exhibits a broad arrangement of meso-pores, with a maximum density at around 35-40 Å, rather than a long-range mesoscopic organization. The cationic surfactant acts as a surface-area enhancer by incorporating into the hydrous oxide and lowering the surface tension of water in the pores during drying. The pH of the reaction medium affects the surface area of the ceria; an increase in pH leads to an increase in surface area, and ceria prepared in the pH range of 9-11 shows better thermal resistance. The reaction mechanism is outlined in Scheme 2.

使用混合有机/无机路线合成的铈氧化物具有增强的纹理和热稳定性特性。铈氧化物表现出在约35-40 Å处密度最高的广布介孔结构，而不是长程微观组织。阳离子表面活性剂作为表面面积增强剂，通过融入水合氧化铈并降低干燥过程中孔隙中水的表面张力起作用。反应介质的pH值影响铈氧化物的表面积；pH值增加导致表面积增大，且在pH范围为9-11的铈氧化物显示出更好的热稳定性。反应机制在方案2中概述。
