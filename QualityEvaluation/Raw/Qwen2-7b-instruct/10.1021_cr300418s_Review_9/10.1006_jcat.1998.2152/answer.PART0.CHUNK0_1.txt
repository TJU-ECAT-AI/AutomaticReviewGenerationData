[1] "Although ceria does not show long range mesoscopic organization, it exhibits a broad arrangement of meso pores in the region 2080 Å with a maximum located at around 3540 Å."
[2] "This ceria shows enhanced textural and thermal resistance features compared with ceria prepared by conventional routes."
[3] "In all commercial applications, stability of textural properties and resistance to sintering after aging play an important role."
[4] "It is suggested that the cationic surfactant does not act as a true templating agent but as a surface-area enhancer by incorporation into the hydrous oxide and lowering of the surface tension of water in the pores during drying."
[5] "Compared with conventional CeO2, the textural features of HSA CeO2 are superior, particularly in the temperature range 9001200 K."
[6] "The lack of a long-range ordered structure is also confirmed by microscopy studies."
[7] "The loss in surface area at high temperatures is due to an increase in the size of crystallite domains from a value of 25 nm, observed after calcination at 723 K to 30100 nm, observed after calcination at 1273 K."

The synthesis and characterization of mesoporous high-surface area ceria are described in the document. The reaction of cerium salts under basic conditions with ammonia in the presence of a cationic surfactant results in the precipitation of a gelatinous hydrous cerium oxide/surfactant mixture. This mixture, after drying and calcination, gives pure, high surface area, fluorite-structured CeO2. Although ceria does not show long range mesoscopic organization, it exhibits a broad arrangement of meso pores in the region 2080 Å with a maximum located at around 3540 Å. The incorporation of cationic surfactants enhances the surface area of ceria. The textural features of high surface area mesoporous ceria (HSA CeO2) are superior to those of conventional CeO2, particularly in the temperature range 9001200 K. The loss in surface area at high temperatures is due to an increase in the size of crystallite domains. The cationic surfactant does not act as a true templating agent but as a surface-area enhancer by incorporation into the hydrous oxide and lowering of the surface tension of water in the pores during drying.

文献描述了介孔高比表面积氧化铈的合成与表征。在基本条件下，铈盐与氨水以及阳离子表面活性剂反应生成胶状水合铈氧化物/表面活性剂混合物。干燥和煅烧此混合物后，得到纯度高、氟化结构的CeO2。尽管铈氧化物没有长程微观组织，但其表现出2080 Å范围内的广泛介孔结构，最大值位于约3540 Å。阳离子表面活性剂的引入可以增强铈氧化物的表面积。高表面积介孔氧化铈（HSA CeO2）的纹理特性优于传统铈氧化物，特别是在温度范围为9001200 K时。高温下表面面积的损失归因于晶粒尺寸的增加。阳离子表面活性剂不仅不作为真正的模板剂，而是通过融入水合氧化物并降低干燥过程中水孔的表面张力来作为表面积增强剂。在高温下，表面面积的损失是由于晶体粒径从723 K后的25 nm增加到1273 K后的30100 nm。
