The synthesis and characterization of mesoporous high-surface-area ceria are detailed in the document. Although the ceria does not display long-range mesoscopic organization, it has a broad distribution of mesopores ranging from 2080 Å to 3540 Å. The surfactant plays a crucial role in promoting the oxidation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ and the formation of hydrous oxide in solution. This surfactant might also help to reduce the interfacial energy, decreasing capillary stress, thus contributing to the stability of the pore structure.

文档详细描述了介孔高表面积氧化铈的合成和表征。尽管氧化铈没有表现出长程微结构组织，但它在2080 Å到3540 Å范围内展现出广泛的微孔分布。表面活性剂在促进Ce3+氧化为Ce4+以及在溶液中形成水合氧化物方面起着关键作用。此外，该表面活性剂可能通过降低界面能，减少表面张力应力，从而对孔结构稳定性产生有益影响。
