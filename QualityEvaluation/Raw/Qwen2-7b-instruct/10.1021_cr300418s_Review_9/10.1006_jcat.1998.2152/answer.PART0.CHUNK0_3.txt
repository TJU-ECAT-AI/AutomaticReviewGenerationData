[1] "The synthesis, characterization, and proposed formation mecha- nism of mesoporous high surface area ceria is described."
[2] "Although ceria does not show long range mesoscopic organization, it exhibits a broad arrangement of meso- pores in the region 2080 A with a maximum located at around 3540 A."
[3] "This ceria shows enhanced textural and thermal resistance features compared with ceria prepared by conventional routes."
[4] "It is suggested that the cationic surfactant does not act as a true templating agent but as a surface- area enhancer by incorporation into the hydrous oxide and lowering of the surface tension of water in the pores during drying."
[5] "In all cases, the atomic assembly as revealed by HRTEM is ordered only at a microdomain level, and in some regions is highly disordered, and pores are irregularly spaced and broadly distributed in size."
[6] "The lack of a long-range ordered structure is also con- firmed by microscopy studies."
[7] "Compared with ceria prepared by conventional precipitation, this ceria has a higher surface area and better thermal stability."

The synthesis involves the reaction of cerium salts under basic conditions with ammonia in the presence of a cationic surfactant. This leads to the precipitation of a gelatinous hydrous cerium oxide/surfactant mixture, which upon drying and calcination gives pure, high surface area, fluorite-structured CeO2. The ceria does not exhibit long-range mesoscopic organization, but it has a broad arrangement of mesopores in the region 20-80 Å with a maximum at around 35-40 Å. The cationic surfactant acts as a surface-area enhancer by incorporating into the hydrous oxide and lowering the surface tension of water in the pores during drying. The ceria shows enhanced textural and thermal resistance features compared to ceria prepared by conventional routes. The atomic assembly is only ordered at a microdomain level, and pores are irregularly spaced and broadly distributed in size. This ceria has a higher surface area and better thermal stability compared to conventionally prepared ceria.

合成过程涉及在基本条件下，铈盐与氨水在阳离子表面活性剂的存在下反应。这导致胶状水合铈氧化物/表面活性剂混合物的沉淀，在干燥和煅烧后产生纯的高表面积氟化铈结构。铈氧化物没有长程微结构组织，但具有在20-80 Å范围内的广泛介孔结构，最大值位于约35-40 Å处。阳离子表面活性剂作为表面增强剂使用，通过将自身融入水合氧化铈中，并在干燥过程中降低水在孔隙中的表面张力。该铈氧化物显示出与传统方法制备的铈氧化物相比，更高的表面积和更好的热稳定性。原子组装仅在微观区域有序，孔隙分布不规则且大小广泛分布。这种铈氧化物的表面积高于传统方法制备的铈氧化物，并且具有更好的热稳定性。
