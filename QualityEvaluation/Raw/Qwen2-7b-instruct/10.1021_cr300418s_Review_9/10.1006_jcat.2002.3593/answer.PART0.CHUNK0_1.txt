[1] "The styrene yield in the presence of carbon dioxide was 2.5 times higher than that in the absence of carbon dioxide (argon atmosphere) at 823 K, indicating that carbon dioxide markedly promoted the dehy- drogenation of ethylbenzene."
[2] "The styrene yield in the presence of carbon dioxide was 2.5 times higher than that in an argon atmosphere at 823 K, showing the remarkable promoting effect of carbon dioxide."
[3] "Carbon dioxide behaved as an oxidant for the vanadium species, and the surface vanadium species were kept in a high oxidation state with car- bon dioxide during the dehy- drogenation reaction."
[4] "In an argon atmosphere, the vanadium species is continuously reduced during the dehydrogenation reaction. On the other hand, in a carbon dioxide atmosphere,carbon dioxide can oxidize the reduced vanadium species,and the vanadium species is kept in a higher oxidation state (Scheme 1)."
[5] "The promoting effect of carbon dioxide was only observed on the catalyst with a large surface area, in which vanadium species were highly dispersed on the MgO support."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by altering the reactivity and stability of active sites. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure and dynamic behavior of the catalyst, optimizing the balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety, and accounting for the complex interactions within the catalytic system. The document does not provide specific details on nickel oxide-based catalysts, focusing instead on vanadium oxide-loaded MgO catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation. The promotion of the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene by carbon dioxide is attributed to its ability to oxidize the reduced vanadium species, keeping them in a higher oxidation state. The promoting effect is more pronounced on catalysts with a large surface area where vanadium species are highly dispersed. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety requires understanding the specific mechanisms involved in the dehydrogenation process, which is influenced by factors such as temperature, reaction time, and the composition of the catalyst.
