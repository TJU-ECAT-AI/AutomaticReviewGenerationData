[1] "The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over a vanadium oxide- loaded MgO catalyst was investigated using carbon dioxide."
[2] "The styrene yield in the presence of carbon dioxide was 2.5 times higher than that in the absence of carbon dioxide (argon atmosphere) at 823 K, indicating that carbon dioxide markedly promoted the dehy- drogenation of ethylbenzene."
[3] "At 873 K, the same catalyst afforded the highest styrene yield, 73.8% with a selectivity of 90.1%, in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[4] "Carbon dioxide behaved as an oxidant for the vanadium species, and the surface vanadium species were kept in a high oxidation state with car- bon dioxide during the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "Active phases of vanadium in the dehydrogenation reaction were believed to be V5+ species in V2O5 or Mg3V2O8 on highly dispersed MgO."
[6] "The reduced species, V4+ and V3+, were less reactive sites for the dehydrogenation."
[7] "In an argon atmosphere, the vanadium species is continuously reduced during the dehydrogenation reaction."
[8] "On the other hand, in a carbon dioxide atmosphere,carbon dioxide can oxidize the reduced vanadium species,and the vanadium species is kept in a higher oxidation state."
[9] "Based on the fact that no significant changes in the XRD patterns were observed between the reduced catalyst and the carbon dioxide-treated catalyst and that only a small amount of carbon monoxide was formed in the temperature-programmed reaction with carbon dioxide, it can safely be said that carbon dioxide can oxidize only the surface species of the reduced catalyst, while oxidation of the bulk of the reduced vanadium species cannot proceed with carbon dioxide."
[10] "According to Ishida et al., the reduction of a vanadium oxide-loaded Al2O3 catalyst creates a new Lewis acid site assigned to the reduced vanadium species."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding how these factors affect the electronic structure and reactivity of the catalysts, optimizing the reaction conditions for maximum efficiency and selectivity, and ensuring the safety of the process. Carbon dioxide can act as an oxidant for the vanadium species, keeping them in a high oxidation state during the dehydrogenation reaction, thus promoting the reaction. The active phases of vanadium in the dehydrogenation reaction are believed to be V5+ species in V2O5 or Mg3V2O8 on highly dispersed MgO. The reduced species, V4+ and V3+, are less reactive for the dehydrogenation. In an argon atmosphere, the vanadium species is continuously reduced, whereas in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, carbon dioxide can oxidize the reduced vanadium species, keeping them in a higher oxidation state. Carbon dioxide can only oxidize the surface species of the reduced catalyst, while the bulk of the reduced vanadium species cannot proceed with carbon dioxide. The reduction of a vanadium oxide-loaded Al2O3 catalyst creates a new Lewis acid site assigned to the reduced vanadium species, affecting the catalytic performance.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成可以影响它们在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能，如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯。这些催化系统的理论建模、过程优化以及平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战包括理解这些因素如何影响催化剂的电子结构和活性、优化反应条件以实现最大效率和选择性，并确保过程的安全性。二氧化碳可以作为钒物种的氧化剂，在脱氢反应期间保持它们的高氧化态，从而促进反应。脱氢反应中的活性钒相被认为是V2O5或Mg3V2O8上的高度分散MgO中的V5+物种。还原物种V4+和V3+对于脱氢反应活性较低。在氩气氛中，钒物种连续被还原，而在二氧化碳气氛中，二氧化碳可以氧化还原的钒物种，保持它们的高氧化态。二氧化碳只能氧化还原催化剂的表面物种，而还原的钒物种的主体不能与二氧化碳进行氧化。铝氧化物负载的钒氧化物的还原产生一个新的Lewis酸位点，归因于还原的钒物种，这会影响催化性能。
