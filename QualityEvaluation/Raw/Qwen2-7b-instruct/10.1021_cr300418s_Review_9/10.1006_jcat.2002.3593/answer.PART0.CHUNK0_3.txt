[1] "In order to elucidate the role of car- bon dioxide in this reaction, characterization of the catalyst was carried out via methods such as temperature-programmed reduc- tion, temperature-programmed reaction with carbon dioxide, and UVvisible, FT-IR, and XRD spectroscopies."
[2] "Carbon dioxide behaved as an oxidant for the vanadium species, and the surface vanadium species were kept in a high oxidation state with car- bon dioxide during the dehy- drogenation reaction."
[3] "Active phases of vanadium in the dehydrogenation reaction were believed to be V5+ species in V2O5 or Mg3V2O8 on highly dispersed MgO."
[4] "In an argon atmosphere, the vanadium species is continuously reduced during the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "On the other hand, in a carbon dioxide atmosphere,carbon dioxide can oxidize the reduced vanadium species,and the vanadium species is kept in a higher oxidation state (Scheme 1), resulting in a high styrene yield compared to that in an argon atmosphere."

1. The role of carbon dioxide in the reaction was elucidated through various characterization techniques including temperature-programmed reduction, temperature-programmed reaction with carbon dioxide, UVvisible, FT-IR, and XRD spectroscopies.
2. Carbon dioxide acted as an oxidant for the vanadium species, keeping them in a high oxidation state during the dehydrogenation reaction.
3. The active phases of vanadium in the dehydrogenation reaction were identified as V5+ species in V2O5 or Mg3V2O8 on highly dispersed MgO.
4. In an argon atmosphere, the vanadium species is continuously reduced during the dehydrogenation reaction.
5. In contrast, carbon dioxide can oxidize the reduced vanadium species in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, keeping them in a higher oxidation state and resulting in a high styrene yield compared to an argon atmosphere.

1. 碳二氣在反應中的作用通過溫度程序化還原、溫度程序化與碳二氣反應、紫外可見光、傅立葉轉換紅外光譜和X射線粉末衍射等多種表征技術進行了闡述。
2. 碳二氣作為氧化劑，使鈷酸鹽表面的鈷酸鹽保持高氧化狀態。
3. 過氧化反應中活性鈷酸鹽的形態被認為是V5+在V2O5或Mg3V2O8上的高度分散MgO上。
4. 在氦氣氛中，鈷酸鹽在過氧化反應中不斷被還原。
5. 相反，在碳二氣氛中，碳二氣可以氧化還原的鈷酸鹽，並使其保持較高的氧化狀態，導致較高的苯乙烯產量，相對於氦氣氛而言。
