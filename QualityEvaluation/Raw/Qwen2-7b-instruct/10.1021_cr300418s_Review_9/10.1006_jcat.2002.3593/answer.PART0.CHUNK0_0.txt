[1] "The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over a vanadium oxide- loaded MgO catalyst was investigated using carbon dioxide."
[2] "The styrene yield in the presence of carbon dioxide was 2.5 times higher than that in the absence of carbon dioxide (argon atmosphere) at 823 K, indicating that carbon dioxide markedly promoted the dehy- drogenation of ethylbenzene."
[3] "At 873 K, the same catalyst afforded the highest styrene yield, 73.8% with a selectivity of 90.1%, in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[4] "Carbon dioxide behaved as an oxidant for the vanadium species, and the surface vanadium species were kept in a high oxidation state with car- bon dioxide during the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "Active phases of vanadium in the dehydrogenation reaction were believed to be V5+ species in V2O5 or Mg3V2O8 on highly dispersed MgO."
[6] "The reduced species, V4+ and V3+, were less reactive sites for the dehydrogenation."

1. The study investigated the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene using a vanadium oxide-loaded MgO catalyst under the influence of carbon dioxide.
2. The presence of carbon dioxide significantly enhanced the styrene yield during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene at 823 K, achieving 2.5 times the yield compared to an argon atmosphere.
3. At 873 K, the highest styrene yield of 73.8% was observed with a 90.1% selectivity when using carbon dioxide.
4. Carbon dioxide acted as an oxidant, keeping the surface vanadium species at a high oxidation state during the dehydrogenation reaction.
5. It was hypothesized that active vanadium species involved in the dehydrogenation process were V5+ in V2O5 or Mg3V2O8 on highly dispersed MgO.
6. Reduced vanadium species, V4+ and V3+, were less effective in the dehydrogenation reaction.

1. 研究使用了载有二氧化钒的镁氧化物催化剂，在二氧化碳的作用下，对乙基苯进行了脱氢。
2. 在823 K下，二氧化碳的存在使苯乙烯的产率提高了2.5倍，与氩气气氛相比。
3. 在873 K时，当使用二氧化碳时，苯乙烯的最大产率为73.8%，选择性为90.1%。
4. 二氧化碳作为氧化剂，保持表面的钒物种处于高氧化态，期间进行脱氢反应。
5. 认为在脱氢过程中活性的钒物种是V5+在V2O5或高度分散的Mg3V2O8上。
6. 减少的钒物种，V4+和V3+，在脱氢反应中效率较低。
