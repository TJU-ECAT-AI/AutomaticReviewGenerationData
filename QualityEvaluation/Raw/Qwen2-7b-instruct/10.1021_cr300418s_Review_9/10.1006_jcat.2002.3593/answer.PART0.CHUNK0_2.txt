[1] "The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over a vanadium oxide- loaded MgO catalyst was investigated using carbon dioxide. The styrene yield in the presence of carbon dioxide was 2.5 times higher than that in the absence of carbon dioxide (argon atmosphere) at 823 K, indicating that carbon dioxide markedly promoted the dehy- drogenation of ethylbenzene."
[2] "Carbon dioxide behaved as an oxidant for the vanadium species, and the surface vanadium species were kept in a high oxidation state with car- bon dioxide during the dehydrogenation reaction."
[3] "Active phases of vanadium in the dehydrogenation reaction were believed to be V5+ species in V2O5 or Mg3V2O8 on highly dispersed MgO."
[4] "In an argon atmosphere, the vanadium species is continuously reduced during the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "On the other hand, in a carbon dioxide atmosphere,carbon dioxide can oxidize the reduced vanadium species,and the vanadium species is kept in a higher oxidation state (Scheme 1), resulting in a high styrene yield compared to that in an argon atmosphere."
[6] "Considering that the promoting effect of carbon diox- ide was observed on the V/MgO catalyst with a large sur- face area but not observed on bulk V2O5, the oxidation of lower-valency-state vanadium species with carbon dioxide may occur only in mixed oxides highly dispersed on magne- sium oxide."

The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over a vanadium oxide-loaded MgO catalyst was significantly enhanced in the presence of carbon dioxide. The styrene yield increased by 2.5 times compared to an argon atmosphere at 823 K. Carbon dioxide acted as an oxidant for the vanadium species, keeping them in a high oxidation state during the reaction. The active phases of vanadium involved in the dehydrogenation were identified as V5+ species in V2O5 or Mg3V2O8 on the highly dispersed MgO support. In an argon atmosphere, the vanadium species was continuously reduced, whereas in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, the vanadium species was oxidized, leading to a higher styrene yield. The promotion of the reaction by carbon dioxide was observed on catalysts with a large surface area but not on bulk V2O5, suggesting that the oxidation of lower-valency-state vanadium species with carbon dioxide occurred specifically in mixed oxides highly dispersed on magnesium oxide.

在二氧化碳的存在下，对氧化镁负载的钒氧化物催化剂进行乙基苯的脱氢反应显著增强。在823 K时，与氩气气氛相比，乙酰苯胺的产率提高了2.5倍。二氧化碳作为钒物种的氧化剂，使其保持在高氧化状态。脱氢过程中活性的钒物种被识别为在高度分散的氧化镁上的V2O5或Mg3V2O8中的V5+物种。在氩气气氛中，钒物种连续被还原，而在二氧化碳气氛中，钒物种被氧化，导致较高的乙酸产率。二氧化碳对反应的促进作用仅在具有大表面积的催化剂上观察到，但在纯V2O5上未观察到，表明在高度分散于氧化镁的混合氧化物中，低氧化价态的钒物种与二氧化碳的氧化作用可能只发生。
