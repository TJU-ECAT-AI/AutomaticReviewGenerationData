[1] "The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over a vanadium oxide- loaded MgO catalyst was investigated using carbon dioxide."
[2] "The styrene yield in the presence of carbon dioxide was 2.5 times higher than that in the absence of carbon dioxide (argon atmosphere) at 823 K, indicating that carbon dioxide markedly promoted the dehy- drogenation of ethylbenzene."
[3] "At 873 K, the same catalyst afforded the highest styrene yield, 73.8% with a selectivity of 90.1%, in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[4] "Carbon dioxide behaved as an oxidant for the vanadium species, and the surface vanadium species were kept in a high oxidation state with car- bon dioxide during the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "Active phases of vanadium in the dehydrogenation reaction were believed to be V5+ species in V2O5 or Mg3V2O8 on highly dispersed MgO."
[6] "The reduced species, V4+ and V3+, were less reactive sites for the dehydrogenation."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by altering the reactivity and stability of active sites. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure and dynamic behavior of the catalyst, optimizing the balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety, and accounting for the complex interactions within the catalytic system. The document does not provide specific details on nickel oxide-based catalysts, focusing instead on vanadium oxide-loaded MgO catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation. The promotion of the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene by carbon dioxide is attributed to its ability to oxidize the reduced vanadium species, keeping them in a higher oxidation state. The promoting effect is more pronounced on catalysts with a large surface area where vanadium species are highly dispersed. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety requires understanding the specific mechanisms involved in the dehydrogenation process, which is influenced by factors such as temperature, reaction time, and the composition of the catalyst.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成影响其在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能，通过改变活性位点的反应性和稳定性。理论建模的关键挑战包括准确预测催化剂的电子结构和动力学行为，优化效率、选择性和安全性的平衡，以及考虑催化系统内的复杂相互作用。文档没有提供关于镍氧化物基催化剂的具体信息，而是专注于用于乙苯脱氢的含钒氧化镁催化剂。二氧化碳对乙苯脱氢的促进作用归因于其能够氧化还原态的钒物种，保持它们处于较高的氧化状态。促进效果在具有较大表面积的催化剂上更为明显，其中钒物种在镁氧化物支持上高度分散。平衡效率、选择性和安全性需要理解脱氢过程的具体机制，该过程受温度、反应时间及催化剂组成等因素的影响。

The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over a vanadium oxide-loaded MgO catalyst was significantly enhanced in the presence of carbon dioxide. The styrene yield increased by 2.5 times compared to an argon atmosphere at 823 K. Carbon dioxide acted as an oxidant for the vanadium species, keeping them in a high oxidation state during the reaction. The active phases of vanadium involved in the dehydrogenation were identified as V5+ species in V2O5 or Mg3V2O8 on the highly dispersed MgO support. In an argon atmosphere, the vanadium species was continuously reduced, whereas in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, the vanadium species was oxidized, leading to a higher styrene yield. The promotion of the reaction by carbon dioxide was observed on catalysts with a large surface area but not on bulk V2O5, suggesting that the oxidation of lower-valency-state vanadium species with carbon dioxide occurred specifically in mixed oxides highly dispersed on magnesium oxide.

在二氧化碳的存在下，对氧化镁负载的钒氧化物催化剂进行乙基苯的脱氢反应显著增强。在823 K时，与氩气气氛相比，乙酰苯胺的产率提高了2.5倍。二氧化碳作为钒物种的氧化剂，使其保持在高氧化状态。脱氢过程中活性的钒物种被识别为在高度分散的氧化镁上的V2O5或Mg3V2O8中的V5+物种。在氩气气氛中，钒物种连续被还原，而在二氧化碳气氛中，钒物种被氧化，导致较高的乙酸产率。二氧化碳对反应的促进作用仅在具有大表面积的催化剂上观察到，但在纯V2O5上未观察到，表明在高度分散于氧化镁的混合氧化物中，低氧化价态的钒物种与二氧化碳的氧化作用可能只发生。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding how these factors affect the electronic structure and reactivity of the catalysts, optimizing the reaction conditions for maximum efficiency and selectivity, and ensuring the safety of the process. Carbon dioxide can act as an oxidant for the vanadium species, keeping them in a high oxidation state during the dehydrogenation reaction, thus promoting the reaction. The active phases of vanadium in the dehydrogenation reaction are believed to be V5+ species in V2O5 or Mg3V2O8 on highly dispersed MgO. The reduced species, V4+ and V3+, are less reactive for the dehydrogenation. In an argon atmosphere, the vanadium species is continuously reduced, whereas in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, carbon dioxide can oxidize the reduced vanadium species, keeping them in a higher oxidation state. Carbon dioxide can only oxidize the surface species of the reduced catalyst, while the bulk of the reduced vanadium species cannot proceed with carbon dioxide. The reduction of a vanadium oxide-loaded Al2O3 catalyst creates a new Lewis acid site assigned to the reduced vanadium species, affecting the catalytic performance.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成可以影响它们在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能，如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯。这些催化系统的理论建模、过程优化以及平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战包括理解这些因素如何影响催化剂的电子结构和活性、优化反应条件以实现最大效率和选择性，并确保过程的安全性。二氧化碳可以作为钒物种的氧化剂，在脱氢反应期间保持它们的高氧化态，从而促进反应。脱氢反应中的活性钒相被认为是V2O5或Mg3V2O8上的高度分散MgO中的V5+物种。还原物种V4+和V3+对于脱氢反应活性较低。在氩气氛中，钒物种连续被还原，而在二氧化碳气氛中，二氧化碳可以氧化还原的钒物种，保持它们的高氧化态。二氧化碳只能氧化还原催化剂的表面物种，而还原的钒物种的主体不能与二氧化碳进行氧化。铝氧化物负载的钒氧化物的还原产生一个新的Lewis酸位点，归因于还原的钒物种，这会影响催化性能。
