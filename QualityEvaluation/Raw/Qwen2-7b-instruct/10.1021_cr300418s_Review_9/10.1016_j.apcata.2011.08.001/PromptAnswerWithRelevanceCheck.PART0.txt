[1] "Mesoscopic doped Ce1xMxO (M = Al, Sn, Zr, Mn, and Ni) with large surface area prepared via template-assisted precipitation method have been tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene."
[2] "Of the Ce1xMxO catalysts tested, the CeNiO composite containing 10 mol% Ni demonstrates the highest ST yield of 55% with long-term stability for ODH of EB under 450 C."
[3] "The superior performance of Ce0.90Ni0.10O catalyst can be attributed to the dramatic improvement in oxygen mobility and storage capacity of the ceria materials, resulting from the introduction of Ni species into ceria cubic structure and hence a further shrinkage of ceria lattice."
[4] "A catalytic mechanism via a simple surface redox cycle has been tentatively proposed based on the XPS results."
[5] "Despite this, the use of pure CeO2 is highly discouraged because of its poor thermostability at high temperatures, thereby losing its crucial OSC characteristics."

1. The use of pure CeO2 is discouraged due to its poor thermostability at high temperatures, leading to the loss of crucial oxygen storage/release characteristics (OSC). Nanos-structured carbon materials like onion-like carbon (OLC) and carbon nanofibers (CNF) show high conversion rates of ethylbenzene (EB) and high selectivity to styrene (ST) at temperatures between 450 and 500 degrees Celsius.

2. Mesostructured ceria catalysts showed lower catalytic performance in terms of styrene productivity compared to the reported conversion and selectivity figures of carbon-based catalysts. The challenge lies in achieving high conversion and selectivity while maintaining thermostability and avoiding the drawbacks associated with pure CeO2.

3. The incorporation of Ni species into ceria materials through doping significantly improves the oxygen capacity and storage capacity, essential for an efficient ceria-based catalyst. This modification leads to enhanced catalytic performance for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as EB to ST.

4. The success of ceria materials in various applications is due to their unique combination of high oxygen transport capacity and the ability to easily switch between Ce3+ and Ce4+ states, contributing to their oxygen storage/release capabilities (OSC).

5. To overcome the limitations of pure CeO2, other transition metals are typically introduced into the ceria cubic structure, forming a defective fluorite-structured solid solution. This approach can confer new properties to the materials, such as improved resistance to sintering and higher OSC for various reactions.
