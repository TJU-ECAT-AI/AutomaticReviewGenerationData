1. The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by enhancing the oxygen transport capacity and storage capacity. Introducing Ni species into the ceria cubic structure leads to a further shrinkage of the ceria lattice, improving oxygen mobility and storage capacity. This results in a more efficient ceria-based catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene.
