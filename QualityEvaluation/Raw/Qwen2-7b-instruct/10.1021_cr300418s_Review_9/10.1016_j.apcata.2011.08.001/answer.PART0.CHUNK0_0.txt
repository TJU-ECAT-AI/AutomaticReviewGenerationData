[1] "Mesoscopic doped Ce1xMxO (M = Al, Sn, Zr, Mn, and Ni) with large surface area prepared via template-assisted precipitation method have been tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene."
[2] "Of the Ce1xMxO catalysts tested, the CeNiO composite containing 10 mol% Ni demonstrates the highest ST yield of 55% with long-term stability for ODH of EB under 450 C."
[3] "The superior performance of Ce0.90Ni0.10O catalyst can be attributed to the dramatic improvement in oxygen mobility and storage capacity of the ceria materials, resulting from the introduction of Ni species into ceria cubic structure and hence a further shrinkage of ceria lattice."
[4] "A catalytic mechanism via a simple surface redox cycle has been tentatively proposed based on the XPS results."
[5] "Despite this, the use of pure CeO2 is highly discouraged because of its poor thermostability at high temperatures, thereby losing its crucial OSC characteristics."
[6] "In view of the aforementioned modifications for ceria materials, we envisioned that it would be of interest to explore the doped ceria materials for the ODH of EB."

1. The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions through enhancing oxygen mobility and storage capacity. Specifically, the introduction of Ni species into the ceria cubic structure leads to improved oxygen storage and release capabilities, resulting in a more stable and efficient catalyst for ethylbenzene to styrene conversion.
2. Challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the detailed mechanisms of oxygen mobility and storage, optimizing the dopant concentration for maximum efficiency, and ensuring the catalyst's stability over long periods without compromising product selectivity or safety concerns.
