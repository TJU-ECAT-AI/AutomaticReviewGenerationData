[1] "In this context, it is highly desired to develop a newly robust catalyst applicable for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene."
[2] "Whereas, the catalytic performance in terms of styrene productivities achieved over the mesostructured ceria catalysts was still lower (22.7% conversion of ethylbenzene with 87.3% selectivity to styrene) for the further application."
[3] "In view of the aforementioned modifications for ceria materials, we envisioned that it would be of interest to explore the doped ceria materials for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene."
[4] "Our results have revealed that the prominent increase of oxygen capacity combined with storage capacity, after the introduction of Ni species with an optimal amount, is indispensable for an efficient ceria-based catalyst."

1. The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene. Specifically, the introduction of nickel species into the ceria cubic structure leads to an increase in oxygen capacity and storage capacity, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency and selectivity.

2. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the precise mechanisms by which the dopants affect the electronic structure, predicting the catalyst's performance under various conditions, and ensuring the catalyst's stability and reactivity over time without compromising safety.

3. The use of mesostructured ceria materials with high accessible specific areas can catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene at around 450°C. However, the catalytic performance, in terms of styrene productivities, was still lower compared to other catalysts. The incorporation of nickel into the ceria structure improves the catalytic performance significantly.

4. The doping of ceria with nickel is crucial for achieving an efficient ceria-based catalyst. The addition of nickel species to the ceria cubic structure results in improved oxygen mobility and storage capacity, contributing to the catalyst's superior performance.

5. Nickel oxide-based catalysts can exhibit high catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The catalysts synthesized via a template-assisted precipitation method demonstrate high selectivity and stability for ethylbenzene to styrene conversion.

6. The CeNiO composite containing 10 mol% nickel shows the highest styrene yield of 55% with long-term stability for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene under 450°C. This indicates that the introduction of nickel into the ceria structure is effective in enhancing the catalyst's performance.

7. The superior performance of the Ce0.90Ni0.10O catalyst is attributed to the significant enhancement in the oxygen capacity and storage capacity of the ceria materials due to the incorporation of nickel species. This improvement in ceria lattice structure facilitates better oxygen mobility and storage, leading to increased catalytic efficiency and selectivity.
