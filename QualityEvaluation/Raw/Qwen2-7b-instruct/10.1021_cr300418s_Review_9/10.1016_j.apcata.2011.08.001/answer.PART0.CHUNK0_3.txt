[1] "To date, the most promising catalysts suggested for the process have been confined to several nanos- tructured carbon materials including onion like carbon (OLC) or carbon nanofibers (CNF), which have exhibited high conversion (>60%) of EB as well as high selectivity (>80%) to ST at 450–500 C."
[2] "Nevertheless, due to their properties of fine pow- der and intrinsically low resistance to combustion of the materials in oxidative gas, the carbon-based catalysts cannot be extensively employed in the industrial application."
[3] "Ceria is one of the key components in the catalyst formulations for many industrially important reactions, e.g. three-way-catalysts (TWC) for automobile exhaust treatment, CO oxidation, and low temperature water-gas shift reaction."
[4] "Despite this, the use of pure CeO2 is highly discouraged because of its poor thermostability at high temperatures, thereby losing its crucial OSC characteristics."
[5] "To overcome the drawback, other transition metal ions are normally introduced into the ceria cubic structure, resulting in the formation of a defective fluorite-structured solid solution."
[6] "Such modifications may confer new properties to the materials such as better resistance to sintering and higher OSC for various reactions, thus leading to totally different catalytic behavior."
[7] "More recently, we have reported that mesostructured ceria materials with high accessible specific areas can catalyze the ODH of EB at ca. 450 C."
[8] "Whereas, the catalytic performance in terms of ST productivity achieved over the mesostructured ceria catalysts was still lower (22.7% conversion of EB with 87.3% selectivity to ST) for the further application."
[9] "In view of the aforementioned modifications for ceria materials, we envisioned that it would be of interest to explore the doped ceria materials for the ODH of EB."
[10] "Herein, we report the development of a mesostructured Ni-doped ceria catalyst with enhanced activity and stability for the ODH of EB."
[11] "Our results have revealed that the prominent increase of oxygen capacity combined with storage capacity, after the introduction of Ni species with an optimal amount, is indispensable for an efficient ceria-based catalyst."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The introduction of nickel species into the ceria cubic structure leads to improved oxygen capacity and storage capacity, which are essential for efficient catalysts. However, achieving a balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems remains challenging. Theoretical modeling and process optimization are key areas of focus for addressing these challenges.
