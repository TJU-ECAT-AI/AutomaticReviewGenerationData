[1] "To date, the most promising catalysts suggested for the process have been confined to several nanos- tructured carbon materials including onion like carbon (OLC) or carbon nanofibers (CNF), which have exhibited high conversion (>60%) of EB as well as high selectivity (>80%) to ST at 450–500 C."
[2] "Despite this, the use of pure CeO2 is highly discouraged because of its poor thermostability at high temperatures, thereby losing its crucial OSC characteristics."
[3] "Whereas, the catalytic performance in terms of ST productivity achieved over the mesostructured ceria catalysts was still lower (22.7% conversion of EB with 87.3% selectivity to ST) for the further application."
[4] "In view of the aforementioned modifications for ceria materials, we envisioned that it would be of interest to explore the doped ceria materials for the ODH of EB."
[5] "Our results have revealed that the prominent increase of oxygen capacity combined with storage capacity, after the introduction of Ni species with an optimal amount, is indispensable for an efficient ceria-based catalyst."
[6] "The success of ceria in various applications is largely attributed to its unique combination of an elevated oxygen transport capacity with the ability to shift easily between Ce3+ and Ce4+ states, i.e., oxygen storage/release capacities (OSC)."
[7] "To overcome the drawback, other transition metal ions are normally introduced into the ceria cubic structure, resulting in the formation of a defective fluorite-structured solid solution."

1. The use of pure CeO2 is discouraged due to its poor thermostability at high temperatures, leading to the loss of crucial oxygen storage/release characteristics (OSC). Nanos-structured carbon materials like onion-like carbon (OLC) and carbon nanofibers (CNF) show high conversion rates of ethylbenzene (EB) and high selectivity to styrene (ST) at temperatures between 450 and 500 degrees Celsius.

2. Mesostructured ceria catalysts showed lower catalytic performance in terms of styrene productivity compared to the reported conversion and selectivity figures of carbon-based catalysts. The challenge lies in achieving high conversion and selectivity while maintaining thermostability and avoiding the drawbacks associated with pure CeO2.

3. The incorporation of Ni species into ceria materials through doping significantly improves the oxygen capacity and storage capacity, essential for an efficient ceria-based catalyst. This modification leads to enhanced catalytic performance for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as EB to ST.

4. The success of ceria materials in various applications is due to their unique combination of high oxygen transport capacity and the ability to easily switch between Ce3+ and Ce4+ states, contributing to their oxygen storage/release capabilities (OSC).

5. To overcome the limitations of pure CeO2, other transition metals are typically introduced into the ceria cubic structure, forming a defective fluorite-structured solid solution. This approach can confer new properties to the materials, such as improved resistance to sintering and higher OSC for various reactions.

1. 纯CeO2在高温下的稳定性差，导致关键的氧气存储/释放特性（OSC）丧失。纳米结构碳材料如洋葱状碳（OLC）和碳纤维（CNF）在450至500度的温度下显示出EB到ST的高转化率和高选择性。

2. 芳烃氧化脱氢反应中，介孔结构铈催化剂的催化性能在乙苯转化为苯乙烯时表现出较低的生产力，与报道的碳基催化剂相比，其转化率和选择性更高。挑战在于在维持热稳定性的同时，避免纯CeO2的缺点，并实现高转化率和选择性。

3. 通过向铈材料中掺入Ni物种进行掺杂，显著提高了氧容量和存储容量，这对于高效的铈基催化剂至关重要。这种修改导致乙苯到苯乙烯等氧化脱氢反应的增强催化性能。

4. 铈材料在各种应用中的成功在于其独特的高氧传输能力和易于在Ce3+和Ce4+状态之间切换的能力，这有助于它们的氧气存储/释放能力（OSC）。

5. 为了克服纯CeO2的局限性，通常将其他过渡金属引入铈立方结构中，形成缺陷氟化物结构的固溶体。这种方法可以赋予材料新的特性，如提高抗烧结性和更高的各种反应的OSC。
