[1] "The effect of promoters on the catalytic activity in the V2Me/Al. It is clear that type of additives affects the catalyst activity."
[2] "The addition of promoters can all increase the selectivity of ST but have different influence on the conversion of EB."
[3] "EB conversion is higher at low calcined temperature than higher calcined temperature; a maximum EB conversion reaches 15.2% at 250 C while only 8.0% at 550 C."
[4] "The ST selectivity kept a high value(> 98%) during the reaction for 1 h, decreasing to 8.5% after a run of 11 h."
[5] "The decrease of the surface area and pore volume after the catalytic reaction, it seems to be due to the coke deposition during the dehydrogenation."
[6] "Increase of C/Al implied that the producing of coke deposited in the dehydrogenation, increase of V/Al suggested the migration of active vanadium species."
[7] "The reduction of surface vanadium species during the reaction is indicated by the increased full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the V 2p3/2 spectrum."
[8] "Based on our above discussions, it can be concluded that the catalytic reaction over V2K/Al followed the redox cycle."

1. The type of additives significantly impacts the catalyst activity in the V2Me/Al system. Promoters enhance styrene selectivity but affect ethylbenzene conversion differently.

2. Promoter addition increases styrene selectivity, yet varies in its impact on ethylbenzene conversion.

3. Ethylbenzene conversion peaks at 15.2% when calcined at 250°C, contrasting with only 8.0% at 550°C.

4. The ST selectivity remains high during the first hour of reaction but decreases over time.

5. The catalyst degradation is attributed to coke deposition, causing a reduction in surface area and pore volume.

6. The increase in C/Al ratio signifies the deposition of coke during dehydrogenation, while the rise in V/Al ratio indicates the migration of active vanadium species.

7. The broadening of the V 2p3/2 spectrum's full width at half maximum suggests the reduction of surface vanadium species during the reaction.

8. The catalytic reaction over V2K/Al adheres to a redox cycle, essential for CO2 activation in oxidative dehydrogenation.

1. 不同类型的添加剂在V2Me/Al系统中显著影响催化剂活性。促进剂提高了苯乙烯的选择性，但对乙基苯选择性的影响不同。

2. 添加剂的增加可以提高苯乙烯的选择性，但对乙基苯转化率的影响各不相同。

3. 在250°C下煅烧时，乙基苯的转化率达到峰值15.2%，而在550°C下仅为8.0%。

4. 反应的第一小时内，苯乙烯选择性保持高值，但在长时间反应后逐渐下降。

5. 催化剂的降解归因于焦炭沉积，导致表面面积和孔体积的减少。

6. C/Al比率的增加表明了沉积的焦炭在脱氢过程中产生，而V/Al比率的增加则表明了活性钒物种的迁移。

7. V 2p3/2光谱的全宽度半最大值的扩展表明反应期间表面钒物种的减少。

8. V2K/Al的催化反应遵循还原-氧化循环，对于含二氧化碳的氧化脱氢至关重要。
