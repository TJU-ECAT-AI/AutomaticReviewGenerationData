<p>The promoters have effect on the activity of V2/Al at 450 C, and V2K/Al calcined at 250 C had a better catalytic reactivity than that calcined at higher temperature.</p>

The document discusses the effectiveness of alumina-supported vanadium oxides (V2K/Al) as catalysts for the CO2-enhanced dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (CO2EBDH) at a lower temperature. The presence of promoters influences the activity of the catalysts at 450°C, and the catalysts calcined at 250°C demonstrated better reactivity than those calcined at higher temperatures. The stability of the catalysts is also explored, indicating that the reduction of surface vanadium species and coke deposition are the primary reasons for catalyst deactivation. After regeneration, the catalytic activity of V2K/Al is restored to 87% of its original level.

文献讨论了在较低温度下，以氧化铝为载体的五氧化二钒（V2K/Al）作为CO2增强乙基苯乙烯脱氢（CO2EBDH）催化剂的有效性。促进剂的存在影响了催化剂在450°C时的活性，而250°C煅烧的催化剂表现出比高温煅烧催化剂更好的反应性。还探讨了催化剂的稳定性，指出表面五氧化二钒物种的减少和焦炭沉积是催化剂失活的主要原因。再生后，V2K/Al的催化活性恢复至原始水平的87%。
