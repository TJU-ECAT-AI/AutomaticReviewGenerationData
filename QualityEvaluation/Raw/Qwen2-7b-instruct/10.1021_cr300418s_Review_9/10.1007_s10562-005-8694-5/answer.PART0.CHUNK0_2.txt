<p>The promoters have effect on the activity of V2/Al at 450 C, and V2K/Al calcined at 250 C had a better catalytic reactivity than that calcined at higher temperature.</p>
<p>The catalyst stability was also discussed, the reduction of surface vanadium species and coke deposition maybe the major reason for the catalyst deactivation, after regeneration the catalytic activity of V2K/Al can be resumed as 87% as the fresh one.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The promoters significantly impact the activity of V2/Al catalysts at 450°C, and V2K/Al calcined at 250°C demonstrated superior catalytic reactivity compared to higher temperatures. 
2. The stability of the catalyst was examined, attributing the catalyst deactivation to the reduction of surface vanadium species and coke deposition. After regeneration, the catalytic activity of V2K/Al recovered to 87% of its original level.

1. 添加剂对450°C下的V2/Al催化剂活性有显著影响，而250°C下煅烧的V2K/Al具有比高温更好的催化反应性。
2. 催化剂稳定性被讨论，催化剂失活的主要原因是表面钒物种的减少和焦炭沉积。再生后，V2K/Al的催化活性恢复到原始水平的87%。
