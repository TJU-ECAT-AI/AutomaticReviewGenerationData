[1] "Alumina-supported vanadium oxides (V2K/Al) were found to be an effective catalyst for the CO2EBDH in a lower temperature."
[2] "The promoters have effect on the activity of V2/Al at 450 C, and V2K/Al calcined at 250 C had a better catalytic reactivity than that calcined at higher temperature."
[3] "The catalyst stability was also discussed, the reduction of surface vanadium species and coke deposition maybe the major reason for the catalyst deactivation, after regeneration the catalytic activity of V2K/Al can be resumed as 87% as the fresh one."

1. The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene processes. The doping elements modify the electronic properties of the catalysts, affecting their activity and selectivity. Vacancy formation can alter the surface chemistry, impacting the catalytic performance. The key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure changes due to doping and vacancy formation. Process optimization requires careful control of synthesis conditions to achieve desired catalyst properties. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety necessitates understanding the fundamental mechanisms governing the reaction pathways and identifying the optimal operating conditions.

2. The use of promoters in the preparation of vanadia catalysts for CO2-ethylenedehydrogenation significantly affects their activity. At 450°C, the addition of potassium (V2K/Al) led to higher ethylen conversion rates compared to other promoters. Calcination at 250°C resulted in catalysts with superior reactivity compared to those calcined at higher temperatures. This highlights the importance of optimizing the preparation conditions to enhance catalyst performance.
