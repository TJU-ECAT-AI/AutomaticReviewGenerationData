The document discusses the effectiveness of alumina-supported vanadium oxides (V2K/Al) as catalysts for the CO2-enhanced dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (CO2EBDH) at a lower temperature. The presence of promoters influences the activity of the catalysts at 450°C, and the catalysts calcined at 250°C demonstrated better reactivity than those calcined at higher temperatures. The stability of the catalysts is also explored, indicating that the reduction of surface vanadium species and coke deposition are the primary reasons for catalyst deactivation. After regeneration, the catalytic activity of V2K/Al is restored to 87% of its original level.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The key factors affecting performance include the ability to facilitate redox reactions, the stability of active sites, and the prevention of coke deposition. Challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include accurately predicting catalyst behavior under various conditions, optimizing the reaction environment to maximize product yield while minimizing byproducts, and ensuring the catalyst remains stable and active over multiple cycles. In the context of the provided document, the focus is on developing a catalyst for the CO2-enhanced dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, with a particular emphasis on the effects of promoters, calcination temperature, and catalyst stability.

[1] "The effect of promoters on the catalytic activity in the V2Me/Al. It is clear that type of additives affects the catalyst activity."
[2] "The addition of promoters can all increase the selectivity of ST but have different influence on the conversion of EB."
[3] "EB conversion is higher at low calcined temperature than higher calcined temperature; a maximum EB conversion reaches 15.2% at 250 C while only 8.0% at 550 C."
[4] "The ST selectivity kept a high value(> 98%) during the reaction for 1 h, decreasing to 8.5% after a run of 11 h."
[5] "The decrease of the surface area and pore volume after the catalytic reaction, it seems to be due to the coke deposition during the dehydrogenation."
[6] "Increase of C/Al implied that the producing of coke deposited in the dehydrogenation, increase of V/Al suggested the migration of active vanadium species."
[7] "The reduction of surface vanadium species during the reaction is indicated by the increased full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the V 2p3/2 spectrum."
[8] "Based on our above discussions, it can be concluded that the catalytic reaction over V2K/Al followed the redox cycle."

1. The type of additives significantly impacts the catalyst activity in the V2Me/Al system. Promoters enhance styrene selectivity but affect ethylbenzene conversion differently.

2. Promoter addition increases styrene selectivity, yet varies in its impact on ethylbenzene conversion.

3. Ethylbenzene conversion peaks at 15.2% when calcined at 250°C, contrasting with only 8.0% at 550°C.

4. The ST selectivity remains high during the first hour of reaction but decreases over time.

5. The catalyst degradation is attributed to coke deposition, causing a reduction in surface area and pore volume.

6. The increase in C/Al ratio signifies the deposition of coke during dehydrogenation, while the rise in V/Al ratio indicates the migration of active vanadium species.

7. The broadening of the V 2p3/2 spectrum's full width at half maximum suggests the reduction of surface vanadium species during the reaction.

8. The catalytic reaction over V2K/Al adheres to a redox cycle, essential for CO2 activation in oxidative dehydrogenation.
