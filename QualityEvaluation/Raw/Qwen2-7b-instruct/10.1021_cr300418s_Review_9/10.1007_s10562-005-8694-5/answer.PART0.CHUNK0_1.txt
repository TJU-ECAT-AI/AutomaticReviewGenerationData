[1] "Alumina-supported vanadium oxides (V2K/Al) were found to be an effective catalyst for the CO2EBDH in a lower temperature."
[2] "The promoters have effect on the activity of V2/Al at 450 C, and V2K/Al calcined at 250 C had a better catalytic reactivity than that calcined at higher temperature."
[3] "The catalyst stability was also discussed, the reduction of surface vanadium species and coke deposition maybe the major reason for the catalyst deactivation, after regeneration the catalytic activity of V2K/Al can be resumed as 87% as the fresh one."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The key factors affecting performance include the ability to facilitate redox reactions, the stability of active sites, and the prevention of coke deposition. Challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include accurately predicting catalyst behavior under various conditions, optimizing the reaction environment to maximize product yield while minimizing byproducts, and ensuring the catalyst remains stable and active over multiple cycles. In the context of the provided document, the focus is on developing a catalyst for the CO2-enhanced dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, with a particular emphasis on the effects of promoters, calcination temperature, and catalyst stability.
