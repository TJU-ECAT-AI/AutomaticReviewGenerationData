[1] "Catalyst problems vary from case to case. Increased activity or improved selectivity may be called for, or decreased deactivation. Perhaps it is a question of devising satisfactory regeneration procedures."
[2] "Often data are incomplete or speculative. Correlations may be empirical but prove extremely useful. Utilization rather than analysis is often more fruitful; success its own reward."
[3] "The catalyst designer, seeking solutions to his problems, should not overlook any source of information. Not only the open literature but also patents and reports of experimental programs should be searched for relevant data."
[4] "Systematic, scientific methods for catalyst design have been pursued by researchers for many years. A recent book gives many examples(85) and more details and guidance are found in Chapter 5."
[5] "Candidate catalysts from the design may be new or novel compositions, giving the designer a proprietary position. However, commercialization takes longer since there are many steps remaining before the worthiness of the invention is demonstrated."
[6] "Design only specifies active components, supports, and promoters. It does not provide guidance on parameters such as concentration of the active component, method of preparation, and temperature of calcination."
[7] "After the design phase, exploratory catalysts are made for testing. Although small-scale preparations using colloidal laboratory procedures are used, careful records should be maintained."
[8] "Optimization of critical properties is an important feature at this stage. Design only specifies active components, supports, and promoters. It does not provide guidance on parameters such as concentration of the active component, method of preparation, and temperature of calcination."
[9] "Heat-transfer-limited processes are best tested with commercially sized tubes since heat-transfer characteristics are difficult to estimate."
[10] "Automation of pilot units increases construction but reduces operating costs. Turnkey units are available for almost any size and application."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The electronic structure affects the reactivity of the catalyst, while the dopant concentrations alter the surface properties, enhancing or suppressing the desired reaction pathways. Vacancy formation can impact the catalyst's stability and activity by affecting diffusion paths and interaction sites for reactants and products. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure and surface properties under various conditions. Process optimization focuses on finding the right balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety, often requiring trade-offs between these factors. Balancing these aspects necessitates extensive experimentation, informed by both theoretical insights and practical experience, to develop catalysts capable of performing oxidative dehydrogenation reactions effectively.

在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成会影响其电子结构和催化性能。电子结构影响催化剂的活性，掺杂浓度改变表面性质，促进或抑制所需的反应路径。空位形成可以影响催化剂的稳定性和活性，通过影响反应物和产物的扩散路径和相互作用点。理论建模的关键挑战是准确预测在不同条件下的电子结构和表面性质。过程优化集中在寻找效率、选择性和安全性的平衡，这往往需要在这些因素之间进行权衡。平衡这些方面需要广泛的实验，结合理论洞察和实践经验，以开发能够有效进行氧化脱氢反应的催化剂。
