3.5. CATALYST DESIGN
"Catalyst design involves selecting candidates for further testing and optimization. These may be very close to the final form if based on previously proven catalysts. For novel designs, however, considerable adjustment lies ahead."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. These factors can enhance or diminish the reactivity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure modifications due to these factors. Process optimization faces hurdles in achieving a balance between maximizing efficiency, ensuring high selectivity, and maintaining safety measures during the reaction. Balancing these aspects requires a deep understanding of the interplay between the catalyst's physical properties and the reaction kinetics, which is often challenging due to the complexity of the interactions involved.
