INTRODUCTION
Styrene is one of the most important monomer for synthetic polymers. More than 90 % of its world production is obtained by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB).
Currently, the dehydrogenation of EB is carried out at 600- 700 C, just below the temperature where thermal cracking becomes significant on the promoted iron oxide catalysts1,2.
Due to the highly endothermic and volume increasing character of the reaction, a large amount of superheated steam is required to supply heat, lower the partial pressure of the reactant, thus shifting the chemical equilibrium to higher styrene formation3-5.
The large amount of wasted energy in the form of excess steam6,the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and the deactivation of catalyst5 are among the several problems which must be solved7. In order to circumvent some of these cited difficulties,the process of dehydrogenation of EB using CO2 instead of steam has received much attention8-12. This process, if developed is believed to be an energy-saving and environmentally friendly process. In fact, the oxidative dehydrogenation of EB with CO2 as a soft oxidant13 possesses several advantages10,14-17 than O2 (strong oxidant) which leads the production of undesired by-products (oxygenates) along with styrene18. It is well known that in the present commercial iron catalyst, hematite (α-Fe2O3) is preferred for styrene production. Small amounts of other metal oxides like Cr2O3 are added as promoters19.

Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide was investigated over a series of binary iron-chromium oxides (Fe2O3-Cr2O3) supported on alumina, silica and titania. The catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, IR and SEM. XRD and FT-IR characterization indicated that iron and chromium ions are dispersed into the support matrix. Compared to Fe-Cr-Si-30 and Fe-Cr- Ti-30 catalysts, Fe-Cr-Al-30 was found to be the most active (conversion = 57.2 %) and the most selective in styrene (94.1 %). The activity value was observed in the following order Fe-Cr-Al > Fe-Cr-Ti.> Fe-Cr-Si. SEM images indicated that there are no significant carbonaceous deposits on the spent Fe-Cr-Al-30 catalyst, whereas modifications of its morphological aspect were observed. The variation of Fe-Cr content in the Fe-Cr-Al catalysts showed that the activity depends strongly on the content. The optimal content determined was 50 wt- %.
Keywords: Mixed oxides, Ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, Styrene, Carbon dioxide, Support. this commercial iron based catalyst does not work effectively for the ethylbenzene in the presence of CO2. Consequently various supports such as Al2O3, MgO, WO3, SiO2, ZrO2 and activated carbon have been tested on the dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of CO2 20-30. It has been found that Fe or Cr oxides supported on activated carbon and Fe oxide supported on ZrO2 exhibited high initial catalytic activity, but suffered from severe deactivation22,23,28,31. Saito et al. 32 found that EB was activated by the acidic sites over γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts while CO2 was activated by basic sites; CO2 conversion was then correlated with the amounts of strong basic sites.
The acid-basic and redox properties of the catalyst, at an optimum composition, will influence the conversion and selectivity to styrene24,29. Strong basic sites lead to the toluene formation, whereas acidic ones lead to the benzene formation33.
In this work, the performance of the binary oxides Fe-Cr cata- lyst system for the dehydrogenation of EB with CO2 has been investigated. The effect of the support and Fe-Cr loading on the support was explored.
EXPERIMENTAL
Catalysts preparation: The supported catalysts were prepared by the wet impregnation method. Typically, the support (alumina, silica and titania) was impregnated with aqueous mixture solution of 1 M Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and 1 M Fe(NO3)3·6H2O. The volumes of the mixture solution were Asian Journal of Chemistry;   Vol. 26, No. 2 (2014), 504-508 http://dx.doi.org/10.14233/ajchem.2014.15601 selected to obtain Fe/Cr = 10/90 (molar ratio) in the final binary oxides. Three catalysts, α-Fe2O3-Cr2O3-Al2O3, α-Fe2O3-Cr2O3- SiO2 and α-Fe2O3-Cr2O3-TiO2, referred to as Fe-Cr-Al-30, Fe-Cr-Si-30 and Fe-Cr-Ti-30 constituted of 30 % by weight of the binary oxides Fe-Cr in the catalyst were prepared by stirring the support and impregnation solutions maintained at 50 C until dryness evaporation and then dried overnight at 120 C. The precursor salt was calcined at 750 C in stainless steel reactor with air flow of 6 L/h. The sample was heated first to 120 C for 0.5 h then the temperature was increased to 750 C for 3.5 h.
Catalysts characterization: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer with CuKα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation. Fourier transform-infra- red spectra of the samples were recorded with Shimadzu FTIR Spetrometer 8400S at ambient conditions via grinding the sample with KBr and then pressed. Scanning electron micro- scopy and elemental analysis (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis: EDAX) were carried out using Jeol SEM model JSM 6360A (Japan).
Catalyst testing: The dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of CO2 was carried out in flow fixed bed reactor loaded with a sample of catalyst under atmospheric pressure.
Prior to dehydrogenation of EB, a sample of a mixed oxides catalyst was pretreated at 700 C for 1 h with 50 mL min-1 CO2 gas. Then, the reactant mixture CO2 and EB at a flow rate of 50 mL min-1 was passed through the catalyst at 660 C. The molar ratio of CO2 to EB was fixed at 11.7 and the W/F was controlled at 13.9 gcat h/mol. The flow of CO2 gas was cont- rolled by mass flow controller. Ethylbenzene was fed to the reaction system with syringe pump. The reaction products were analyzed with a gas phase chromatograph (Agilent 6890N) equipped with a flame ionization detector, a thermal conduc- tivity detector and a capillary column (HP-PLOT Q length 30 m ID 0.53 mm).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
X-Ray powder diffraction: The XRD patterns of samples with different compositions calcined at 750 C are shown in Fig. 1. Phase identification was performed by comparing the experimental XRD pattern results (Fig. 1) with the reported XRD data in ICDD (International Centre for Diffraction Data) and JCPDS (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards).
The mixed oxides, Cr-Fe-10, showed the typical XRD pattern of Cr2O3 and α-Fe2O3 with hematite structure (JCPDS files No. 33-664 and 38-1479, respectively). The peaks are relatively sharp and strong indicating crystalline product with relatively large crystallites. Nevertheless, other phases could be present as traces. In fact, it has been reported for several oxides, the Intensity (cps) 2 ( ) θ 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 (c) (b) (a) Fig. 1.

coexistence of various phases besides the main phase26,27. The XRD results indicated that the mixed oxides have slightly diffe- rent values than the unsupported binary oxides depending on the support. Table-1 presents the d-spacings that correspond to the most significant peaks in the patterns of the unsupported and the supported binary oxides. The deviation from the corresponding unsupported binary oxides, α-Fe2O3 and Cr2O3,respectively may suggest that some iron and chromium ions are dispersed into the support matrix.
FTIR analysis: The mixed oxides were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy. The IR spectra of the samples in the range from 4000-400 cm-1 are shown in Fig. 2. The IR band at 3464 cm-1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of adsorbed H2O molecules. The IR band at 1626 band is normally attributed to O-H bending vibrations34. Compared with the unsupported α-Fe2O3/Cr2O3 mixed oxides, the supported ones showed almost the same features in their FT-IR spectra that can be attributed to changes in the metal-oxygen bonding. The peaks are characteristic of IR-active fundamental and combination lattice modes of crystalline Cr and Fe oxides35. The bands in 800-400 cm-1 region could be assigned to Fe-O or Cr-O lattice vibration36-41. The band at 947 cm-1 is assigned to Cr-O-Cr vibrations. The bands at 897 cm-1 is assigned to Cr-O-Cr vibrations and Fe-O-Fe22,35. The deviation from the unsupported

Change in the activity of catalyst with time on stream: The dehydrogenation of EB was performed in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant over the supported Fe-Cr oxide catalysts. The overall EB conversion and the selectivity of the products for the different catalysts were studied. Fig. 3 showed that the time-on-stream experiments revealed that the EB conversion over Fe-Cr -Al decreased rapidly from 76.8 to
58.5 % after 7 h, whereas no evident decrease in the conversion
is observed over Fe-Cr -Si and Fe-Cr -Ti catalysts after 4 h.
The acidity of catalysts had significant impact on the catalytic performance. Strong acidity could promote the cracking of EB and make the styrene selectivity decrease. The deactivation of Fe-Cr-Al might not be due only to the coke formation, but also to the sintering of the catalyst. In fact, the evolution of the yield with time on stream for all these catalysts showed that they form the cracking products with almost the same yield (Fig. 4). The yield obtained over Fe-Cr-Al, Fe-Cr-Si and Fe-Cr-Ti are 3.7, 2.9 and 3.6 %, respectively. This result indi- cated that all the catalyst underwent the same effect of carbon deposition. Thus, the deactivation of Fe-Cr-Al might be due also to the sintering of the catalyst. This result was evidenced by SEM measurements. The morphological aspects of fresh and spent catalysts were evidenced by SEM images. As shown in Fig. 5a, fresh Fe-Cr -Al sample is characterized by irregular prismatic crystals. By contrast, spent Fe-Cr-Al catalyst is composed of large polygonal aggregates, particles (Fig. 5b).
No significant carbon deposits are identified; only the solid structure was modified. Thus, CO2 contributed in the carbon removal. In fact, Mamedov and Corberan42 have reported that CO2 has two main roles: first is to remove the hydrogen produced as water by the reverse water gas shift reaction; there- fore, the equilibrium limitation of dehydrogenation shifts to the products side and the second is to remove the deposited coke.
The evolution of the styrene selectivity with time on stream is shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that styrene is the major product in this reaction whereas benzene and toluene are minor by-products.

90.9 %, respectively. The stability of styrene selectivity with
time on stream while the activity decreased indicated that the catalyst deactivation was mostly due to sintering but not to carbon deposition (carbon deposition alters the styrene formation). Thus, besides its role as a soft oxidant, CO2 played also the role of coke removal. As shown in Table-2, the Fe-Cr/Al 506  Aouissi et al.

catalyst is the most active solid (conversion = 57.2 %) and the most selective in styrene (94.1 %). Its high activity compared to its counterpart silica and titania supported Fe-Cr oxides is due to the combined effects of acid-base and redox properties.
The activity values suggest the following order of the favourable acid-base /redox and catalytic properties under these reaction conditions: Fe-Cr-Al > Fe-Cr-Ti > Fe-Cr-Si.
Effects of binary oxides loading on the catalytic activity of Fe-Cr-Al: It is well known that the conversion and selectivity to styrene is influenced by the acid-basic and redox properties of the catalyst. An optimum of configuration in acid-basic and redox properties needs to be tailored base on the binding energies in EB molecule. If the surface basic sites are strong enough to abstract b-hydrogen from EB, the break of the lateral C-C bond is promoted and, therefore, the selectivity to toluene will increase. If the catalyst surface acidity is larger, α-hydrogen can be abstracted from EB and the break of the phenyl-C bond become more probably, therefore, a higher selectivity to benzene will be obtained33. Since EB dehydrogenation occurs at the redox sites on the solid surface and CO2 behaves as an oxidant for Fe and Cr species, it is useful to determine the optimal composition of the catalyst for dehydrogenation of EB with
CO2. For that purpose a series of Fe-Cr-Al catalysts with diffe-
rent Fe-Cr content (10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 wt %) marked as Fe-Cr-Al-x (x denotes the weight percent of Fe-Cr in Fe-Cr- Al) was prepared and tested. Fig. 7 represented the variation of the overall conversion of EB dehydrogenation as a function of time on stream over the series of catalysts. It can be seen that the EB conversion declined gradually with time on stream for low loadings while it remained stable for higher loadings 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Conversion (%) Time on stream (h) Fe-Cr-Al-10 Fe-Cr-Al-30 Fe-Cr-Al-50) Fe-Cr-Al-70 Fe-Cr-Al-90 Fig. 7.

(70 and 90 %). It is worth noting that the most stable catalysts were the less selective in styrene production (Fig. 8), i.e., the most selective in cracking products. This result suggested that the main deactivation was not due to the coke formation as it was the case for many catalyst systems22,43,44. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 S(styrene) (%) Time on stream (h) Fe-Cr-Al-10 Fe-Cr-Al-30 Fe-Cr-Al-50

Reaction conditions: temperature = 660 C, CO2/EB = 11.7 (molar ratio) and W/F = 13.9 gh/mol The activity and the selectivity at the steady state for dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of CO2 are presented in the Fig. 9. It can be seen that the catalytic behavour of Fe-Cr/Al depends strongly on the loading. Ethylbenzene conversion initially increased from 31.93-95.38 % when Fe-Cr content increased from 10 to 70 %. Up to 70 % the EB conversion remained unchanged. As for the selectivities, Fig. 9 showed that the selectivity of styrene and the cracking products (benzene and toluene) remained unchanged when the loading varied from 10-50 %. A further increase in the binary oxides content decreased the styrene selectivity in favour of that of cracking. Thus, the optimal loading of the catalyst was determined to be 50 %.

Reaction conditions: Temperature = 660 C, time = 7h, CO2/EB = 11.7 (molar ratio) and W/F = 13.9 g h/mol Conclusion Compared to Fe-Cr-Si and Fe-Cr-Ti, Fe-Cr-Al is the suitable phase for the dehydrogenation of EB with CO2. The activity value was observed in the following order : Fe-Cr-Al > Fe-Cr- Ti > Fe-Cr-Si. The variation of the Fe-Cr content in the Fe-Cr- Al catalyst systems indicated that the catalytic behavour of Fe-Cr -Al catalyst was strongly dependent on the Fe-Cr content. The optimal loading of the catalyst was observed when Fe-Cr content was equal to 50 wt- %, which could be attributed to the appropriate acid- base sites distribution. Characterization of the spent Fe-Cr-Al catalyst indicated that that there are no significant carbonaceous deposits on the spent Fe-Cr-Al-30 catalyst, whereas modifications of its morphological aspect were observed. These results suggest that the main deactivation is not due to the coke formation as it is the case for many catalyst systems. Besides its role as a soft oxidant, CO2 contri- buted in the carbon removal.
