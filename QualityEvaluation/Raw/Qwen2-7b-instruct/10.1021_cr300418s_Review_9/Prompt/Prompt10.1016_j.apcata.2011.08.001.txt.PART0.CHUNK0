Ethylbenzene Styrene a b  s  t  r  a c  t Mesostructured doped  Ce1xMxO  catalysts (M  =  Al,  Sn,  Zr,  Mn,  and  Ni)  with  large  surface area  prepared via template-assisted precipitation method have  been tested  for  the  oxidative dehydrogenation
(ODH)
of ethylbenzene
(EB)
to  styrene.
Several techniques including N2 desorptionadsorption, X-ray diffrac- tion, H2-temperature programmed reduction
(H2-TPR),
total  oxygen storage  capacity
(OSC),
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS)
were  applied to characterize the  physicochemical properties of  the as-synthesized materials.
Of  the  Ce1xMxO  catalysts tested,  the  CeNiO composite containing 10  mol%  Ni demonstrates the  highest ST  yield of  55%  with long-term stability for  ODH of  EB under 450 C.  By  analysis of H2-TPR  and  total OSC  characterization profiles,the  superior performance of  Ce0.90Ni0.10O  catalyst can be attributed to the  dramatic improvement in  oxygen mobility and  storage capacity of  the  ceria  materials,resulting from the  introduction of  Ni  species into  ceria  cubic structure and  hence  a  further shrinkage of ceria lattice.  A  catalytic mechanism via  a simple  surface redox  cycle  has  been  tentatively proposed based on the  XPS  results. 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Introduction Styrene
(ST)
is
one
of
the
most
important
chemi- cals
in
the
petrochemical
industry
for
the
production
of polystyrene,
acrylonitrilebutadienestyrene
(ABS)
terpoly- mer,styrenebutadiene rubber
(SBR),
and so forth [13].
In 2009,the worldwide production of
ST
was more than 23 megatons [4].
Commercially,
ST
is mainly produced by direct dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
(EB),
over K2O-promoted Fe2O3 catalysts in the pres- ence of a large quantity of steam at high temperature
(600650 C)
[5,6].
Due to its highly endothermic nature,this conventional pro- cess suffers from some disadvantages such as the thermodynamic limitation,irreversible catalyst deactivation and coke deposition [1,7].
Alternatively,the oxidative dehydrogenation
(ODH)
process of
EB
to
ST
in the presence of O2 has attracted considerable attention since it can be operated under lower temperatures and the
EB
conversion would not be equilibrium limited [810].
A
variety of catalytic systems,including amorphous AlPO4 [1],  CaO/SiO2 [11], MnO2/SiO2 [12], Mg(VO4)2MgO [13],and V2O5/CeO2/Al2O3 [14],have been investigated for the process of the
ODH
of
EB
recently.
To date,the most promising catalysts Corresponding author.

(Y.
Cao). suggested for the process have been confined to several nanos- tructured carbon materials including onion like carbon
(OLC)
[9,15] or carbon nanofibers
(CNF)
[16,17],  which have exhibited high conversion (>60%) of
EB
as well as high selectivity (>80%) to
ST
at
450500 C.
Nevertheless,due to their properties of fine pow- der [1618] and intrinsically low resistance to combustion of the materials in oxidative gas,the carbon-based catalysts cannot be extensively employed in the industrial application.
In this context,it is highly desired to develop a newly robust catalyst applicable for the
ODH
of
EB.
Ceria is one of the key components in the catalyst formulations for many industrially important reactions,e.g. three-way-catalysts
(TWC)
for automobile exhaust treatment
[19,20],  CO
oxidation [21],and low temperature water-gas shift reaction [22,23].  The success of ceria in various applications is largely attributed to its unique combination of an elevated oxygen transport capacity with the ability to shift easily between Ce3+ and Ce4+ states,i.e. oxygen stor- age/release capacities
(OSC)
[14,24].  Despite this,the use of pure CeO2 is highly discouraged because of its poor thermostability at high temperatures,thereby losing its crucial
OSC
characteristics [25].
To overcome the drawback,other transition metal ions are normally introduced into the ceria cubic structure,resulting in the formation of a defective fluorite-structured solid solution.
Such modifications may confer new properties to the materials such as better resistance to sintering and higher
OSC
for various reactions,thus leading to totally different catalytic behavior [26].

General 405 (2011) 142 148 143 More recently,we have reported that mesostructured ceria materials with high accessible specific areas can catalyze the
ODH
of
EB
at ca.
450 C
[27].
Whereas,the catalytic performance in terms of
ST
productivity achieved over the mesostructured ceria cata- lysts was still lower (22.7% convention of
EB
with
87.3%
selectivity to
ST)
for the further application.
In view of the aforementioned modifications for ceria materials,we envisioned that it would be of interest to explore the doped ceria materials for the
ODH
of
EB.
Herein,we report the development of a mesostructured Ni-doped ceria catalyst with enhanced activity and stability for the
ODH
of
EB.
Our results have revealed that the prominent increase of oxygen capacity combined with storage capacity,after the introduction of Ni species with an optimal amount,is indispensable for an efficient ceria-based catalyst.

Experimental
2.1.
Catalyst preparation Ce1xMxO
(M
= Al, Sn, Zr, Mn,and Ni,x denoted the molar ratio of
M
of to Ce) materials with high surface areas were synthe- sized via a previously established template-assisted precipitation method [28,29].  Typically,
4.5
mmol of Ce(NO3)3,the correspond- ing nitrate hydrate precursors (0.5 mmol),and
CTAB
(1.09 g) were dissolved in 100 ml of distilled water.
Then,150 ml of NaOH solu- tion (0.16 mol
L1)
was added into the solution under stirring.
The mixture was then maintained in a sealed glass vessel under stirring for 3 days.
After aging at
90 C
for 3 h,the as-obtained precipitate was filtered and washed with hot water
(80 C)
for several times to remove the residual
CTAB.
The resultant powder was dried at
100 C
for 6 h and then calcined at
500 C
for 4 h.
For the sake of com- parison in the following catalytic,the oxalate gel co-precipitation method [30] was also employed to synthesize the Ni-doped ceria sample (designated as Ce1xNixOCP).
2.2.
Characterization Nitrogen sorption at
196 C
was measured using a Micromerit- ics TriStar 3000 after the samples were degassed (1.33 × 102 Pa) at
300 C
overnight.
The specific surface area was calculated using the BrunauerEmmetTeller
(BET)
method,and pore size distribution was determined by the BarretJoynerHalenda
(BJH)
method.
TEM
analysis was carried out with a
JEOL
2010 electron micro- scope operating at 200 kV.
Before being transferred into the
TEM
chamber,the samples dispersed in ethanol were deposited onto a carbon-coated copper grid and then quickly moved into the vacuum evaporator.
Structural analysis of CeO2 and the doped ceria samples was carried out on a Bruker
D8
Advance X-ray diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator,operating at 40 kV and 40 mA  and employing nickel-filtered Cu-K radiation ( =
1.5418
A).
Temperature
programmed
reduction
(TPR)
profiles
were obtained on a homemade apparatus. 100 mg  of the samples were pretreated in a mixed gas
(O2/N2 =
1/8) at
450 C
for 30 min and cooled to room temperature.
Subsequently,the samples were reduced with 5% H2/Ar at 40 mL min1 with a ramping rate of
5 C
min1 to
910 C.
The H2 consumption was monitored by a
TCD
detector.
Thermal gravimetric analysis
(TGA),
as well as temperature- programmed oxidation
(TPO)
measurements of the fresh and spent catalysts,was conducted on a PerkinElmer
TGA
7 analyzer.
The sample was placed in an -Al2O3 cumber and heated in flowing air (50 mL  min1) from room temperature to
800 C
at a rate of
20 C
min1.
X-ray photoelectron spectra
(XPS)
analysis was performed on a PerkinElmer
PHI
5000C
spectrometer using Mg  K radiation (1253.6 eV,pass energy of
20.0
eV).
The carbonaceous

1s line (284.6 eV) was used as the
