[1] "The dopants are not as easily reduced as Ce and upon pulling two oxygen atoms out of the surface, the nearest Ce atoms to the sites of the removed oxygen atoms are the surface Ce and subsurface Ce that are shown to be reduced in Figure 5a."
[2] "When two NO molecules adsorb at neighboring oxygen vacancies, the molecules tilt so that a bond begins to form between the N atoms of each NO molecule; the resulting NN distances are longer than in free N2 (1.10 Å), but it is clear that a NN bond is forming."
[3] "Thus, the correlation between oxygen vacancy formation and surface reduction and reoxidation is clear: enhancing oxygen vacancy formation will enhance the interaction of CO with a doped ceria surface, but the tradeoff will be that the interaction of NOx with the doped surface will not be as favorable."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the reduction in energy required for oxygen vacancy formation upon doping leads to enhanced adsorption of CO, thereby increasing the oxidative power of the catalyst. However, this enhancement comes at the cost of reduced interaction and adsorption of NOx, particularly when two NO molecules adsorb at neighboring oxygen vacancies. The key challenge in theoretical modeling is accurately predicting the complex interactions between dopants, oxygen vacancies, and reactants. Process optimization requires balancing the efficiency, selectivity, and safety of these catalytic systems, ensuring that while the oxidative power is improved, the reductive capabilities are not compromised. This balance is crucial for achieving high yields of desired products while minimizing unwanted byproducts and maintaining operational safety.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和氧空位形成对氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）的电子结构和催化性能有显著影响。具体来说，氧空位形成能量降低导致CO吸附增强，从而提高了催化剂的氧化能力。然而，这种增强是以NOx与掺杂表面的相互作用减弱为代价的，特别是当两个NO分子吸附在相邻的氧空位上时。理论建模的关键挑战是准确预测掺杂剂、氧空位和反应物之间的复杂相互作用。过程优化需要在提高效率、选择性和安全性之间找到平衡，确保在不产生副产品的同时获得高产率的产品，并维持操作安全。
