[1] "The dopants are not as easily reduced as Ce and upon pulling two oxygen atoms out of the surface, the nearest Ce atoms to the sites of the removed oxygen atoms are the surface Ce and subsurface Ce that are shown to be reduced."
[2] "Thus, enhancing oxygen vacancy formation will enhance the interaction of CO with a doped ceria surface, but the tradeoff will be that the interaction of NOx with the doped surface will not be as favorable."
[3] "The distortion of the atomic structure around the dopant site tends to weaken the CeO bonds and makes removal of oxygen easier."
[4] "When two NO molecules adsorb at neighboring oxygen vacancies, the molecules tilt so that a bond begins to form between the N atoms of each NO molecule; the resulting NN distances are longer than in free N2 (1.10 Å), but it is clear that a NN bond is forming."

The introduction of dopants into the ceria (110) surface reduces the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation. This leads to enhanced interaction of CO with the doped surface due to increased stabilization of the surface intermediate. However, the interaction of NOx with the doped surface is less favorable. The distortion around the dopant site weakens CeO bonds, facilitating oxygen removal. When two NO molecules adsorb at neighboring oxygen vacancies, they form a bond between their N atoms, albeit with longer distances than in free N2, indicating the formation of a nitrogen bond.

掺杂引入到铈亚晶面中降低了氧空位形成的能量。这导致了CO与掺杂表面的增强交互作用，由于表面中间体的稳定性增加。然而，NOx与掺杂表面的交互作用不如未掺杂表面。围绕掺杂点的结构扭曲削弱了CeO键，有利于氧的移除。当两个NO分子吸附在相邻的氧空位上时，它们在各自的N原子之间形成了一种连接，尽管距离比自由N2长，这表明形成了一个氮原子键。
