[1] "The introduction of the dopant into the (110) surface of ceria reduces the energy required for formation of an oxygen vacancy in the surface."
[2] "As mentioned in other studies, the distortion of the atomic structure around the dopant site tends to weaken the CeO bonds and makes removal of oxygen easier."
[3] "The adsorption of CO onto the doped surface shows the impact of the reduction of the vacancy formation energy, in that the energy gained when CO pulls two oxygen atoms out of the surface is much larger on the doped surface than on the undoped surface, leading to a greater stabilization of the surface intermediate."
[4] "On comparing the dopants, the shortest NN distance is found for Zr doping, which then has the longest NO distances (1.42 Å), as well as the longest dopantO distance (to O of the adsorbate), and it is for Zr doping that the smallest adsorption energy is found."
[5] "Considering the reactions (3) (4) which will be affected by ceria doping, the impact of Ti, Zr, and Hf doping on the redox activity of ceria is therefore two-fold."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the reduction in energy required for oxygen vacancy formation and the enhanced adsorption of CO on doped surfaces indicate improved oxidative power. However, the adsorption of NO becomes less favorable on doped surfaces, potentially affecting the reductive power. Key challenges in theoretical modeling involve accurately predicting the complex interplay between dopants, electronic structure, and catalytic performance. Process optimization requires balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety, especially when considering the dual impact of dopants on oxidative and reductive activities. Theoretical models face difficulties in capturing the detailed mechanisms of complex reactions, necessitating a combination of experimental validation and advanced computational techniques.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，掺杂方法、掺杂剂浓度和氧空位形成对氧化脱氢反应的电子结构和催化性能产生显著影响。具体而言，氧空位形成的能量降低和CO在掺杂表面吸附增强表明了氧化能力的提升。然而，NO在掺杂表面的吸附变得不那么有利，可能会影响还原能力。理论模型化的主要挑战在于准确预测掺杂剂、电子结构与催化性能之间的复杂相互作用。过程优化需要在效率、选择性和安全性之间取得平衡，特别是考虑到掺杂剂对氧化性和还原性活动的双重影响。理论模型面临捕捉复杂反应机制的困难，这需要结合实验验证和高级计算技术的综合应用。
