[1] "The introduction of the dopant into the (110) surface of ceria reduces the energy required for formation of an oxygen vacancy in the surface."
[2] "As mentioned in other studies, the distortion of the atomic structure around the dopant site tends to weaken the CeO bonds and makes removal of oxygen easier."
[3] "On the undoped surface, the orientation of the carbonate is such that CO points away from the surface, with one short and two long CO distances. At the doped surfaces, the adsorbate is oriented so that a CO2-like species points away from the surface, with two short and one long CO distances; the longer distance involves carbon and oxygen at the surface."
[4] "The adsorption of CO onto the doped surface shows the impact of the reduction of the vacancy formation energy, in that the energy gained when CO pulls two oxygen atoms out of the surface is much larger on the doped surface than on the undoped surface, leading to a greater stabilization of the surface intermediate."
[5] "Consistent with experiment (40) and a previous first-principles study, (29) NO does not adsorb strongly at defective ceria surfaces (whether doped or undoped)."
[6] "When two NO molecules adsorb at neighboring oxygen vacancies, the molecules tilt so that a bond begins to form between the N atoms of each NO molecule; the resulting NN distances are longer than in free N2 (1.10 Å), but it is clear that a NN bond is forming."
[7] "Considering the reactions (3) (4) which will be affected by ceria doping, the impact of Ti, Zr, and Hf doping on the redox activity of ceria is therefore two-fold. When doped with these elements, the oxidative power of ceria is enhanced, as indicated by a reduction in the energy required for the formation of oxygen vacancies and enhanced adsorption of CO."
[8] "On the other hand, the adsorption of NO at the doped surfaces is less favorable than at the undoped surface."
[9] "These effects arise from distortions to the structure around the dopant facilitating formation of an oxygen vacancy upon doping, and from previous work, if vacancies are easily formed, then the reoxidation of the surface is less favorable."
[10] "We suggest that experiments could be carried out to test this idea."

1. The introduction of the dopant reduces the energy required for an oxygen vacancy to form in the (110) surface of ceria. This results in easier removal of oxygen atoms from the surface.

2. The distortion of the atomic structure around the dopant site weakens the CeO bonds, facilitating the formation of an oxygen vacancy.

3. The orientation of the carbonate adsorbate changes upon doping, allowing CO2-like species to form with two short and one long CO distances pointing away from the surface.

4. The reduction in the vacancy formation energy on the doped surface enhances the stabilization of the surface intermediate when CO adsorbs.

5. NO does not strongly adsorb at defective ceria surfaces, whether undoped or doped.

6. Two NO molecules adsorbing at neighboring oxygen vacancies on a doped surface cause the molecules to tilt, forming a bond between their N atoms.

7. Doping ceria surfaces with Ti, Zr, and Hf enhances the oxidative power by reducing the energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation and improves CO adsorption.

8. The adsorption of NO on doped surfaces is less favorable than on undoped surfaces.

9. The effects of doping arise from the facilitation of oxygen vacancy formation and the potential decrease in reoxidation of the surface.

10. The authors suggest conducting experiments to test the observed effects of dopants on ceria's redox activity.
