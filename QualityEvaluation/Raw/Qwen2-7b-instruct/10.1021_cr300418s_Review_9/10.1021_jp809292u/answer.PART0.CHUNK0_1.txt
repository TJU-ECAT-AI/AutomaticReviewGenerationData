This passage repeatedly states that the dopants, such as Ti, Zr, and Hf, are not as easily reduced as Ce. When two oxygen atoms are pulled out of the surface during CO adsorption, the nearest Ce atoms to the sites of the removed oxygen atoms are the surface Ce and subsurface Ce that are shown to be reduced. This is illustrated in Figure 5a.

这段文字反复提到，掺杂剂如Ti、Zr和Hf不如Ce容易还原。当在CO吸附过程中拉出两个氧原子时，靠近被移除氧原子位置的最近Ce原子是表面Ce和亚表面Ce，并且这些原子显示为还原。这在图5a中进行了展示。
