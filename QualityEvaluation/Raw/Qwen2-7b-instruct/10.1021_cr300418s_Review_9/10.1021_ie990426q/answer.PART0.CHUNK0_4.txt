[1] "The initial activities of the Cr/AC and Ce/AC catalysts were comparable to that of an iron-loaded activated carbon catalyst which was reported in a previous paper."
[2] "Only chromium(III) oxide and cerium(IV) oxide were detected by X-ray diffraction before and after reactions at higher loading levels, and these species might have been active forms."
[3] "In the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, carbon monoxide and water besides styrene were formed as products, and the amounts of carbon monoxide and water formed during the reaction agreed well with the amount of styrene."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the incorporation of specific dopants and control of vacancy formation can alter the band gap, surface chemistry, and reactivity of the catalysts, enhancing their performance in reactions like ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure modifications resulting from dopants and vacancies, optimizing the catalyst design for maximum efficiency, selectivity, and safety, and accounting for the dynamic nature of the catalytic sites during the reaction process.
