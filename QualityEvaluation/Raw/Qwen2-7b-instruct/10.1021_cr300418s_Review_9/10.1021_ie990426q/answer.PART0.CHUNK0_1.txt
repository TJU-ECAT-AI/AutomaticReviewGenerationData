[1] "Very low conversion of ethylbenzene (3.2%) and styrene yield (0.8%) were observed (run 1) in the dehydrogenation carried out under a carbon dioxide flow at 823 K in the absence of a catalyst."
[2] "Higher ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield were observed with various metal-loaded activated carbon catalysts (0.5 mmol/g of carbon, runs 311) than that with the activated carbon."
[3] "Cr/AC and Ce/AC afforded the highest ethylbenzene conversion (48%) and styrene yield (about 40%) with more than 82% selectivity, and these values were higher than those of Fe/AC catalyst reported in the previous paper13 and commercially used Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst (conversion, 16.0%; yield, 12.8%; selectivity, 79.8%) for the dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons."
[4] "Effects of metal loading level. Figure 1 illustrates the effects of the amount of chromium and cerium loaded on the activated carbon on the ethylbenzene conversion, the styrene yield, and the styrene selectivity."
[5] "These trends observed in the dehydrogenation with chromium and cerium oxide loaded activated carbon catalysts were similar to that observed in the reactions with iron-loaded activated carbon catalyst.13"
[6] "In the reaction with the Cr(0.3)/AC catalyst (Figure 2a), the ethylbenzene conversion increased markedly from 12.9 to 77.9% with an increase in the reaction temperature from 723 to 953 K."
[7] "The styrene yield reached a maximum (49.3%) at 823 K and decreased slightly with further increases in the reaction temperature."
[8] "However, the effect of carbon dioxide was negative in the reaction with Ce/AC (runs 12 and 17) on the styrene yield and selectivity."
[9] "Sharp diffraction peaks assigned as Cr2O3 appeared even after the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with argon and carbon dioxide."
[10] "Only the electron ascribed to Cr2O3 species (binding energy of 576.3 eV, Cr2p3/2) was observed after pretreatment with argon and carbon dioxide at 973 K and after the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene under a carbon dioxide flow at 823 K."

3. Activated carbon-supported chromium (Cr/AC) and cerium (Ce/AC) catalysts exhibited a high styrene yield (about 40%) with over 80% selectivity at 823 K.
4. The amount of chromium and cerium loaded on the activated carbon influenced the ethylbenzene conversion, styrene yield, and styrene selectivity.
5. The observed trends in dehydrogenation with chromium and cerium oxide-loaded activated carbon catalysts resembled those with iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts.
