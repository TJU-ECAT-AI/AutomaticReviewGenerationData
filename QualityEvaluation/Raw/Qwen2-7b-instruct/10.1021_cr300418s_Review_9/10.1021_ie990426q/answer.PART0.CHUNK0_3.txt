[1] "In this work, we will deal with the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene catalyzed by various metal oxides (vanadium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, ruthenium, lanthanum, and cerium) supported on an activated carbon in the presence of excess carbon dioxide."
[2] "Very low conversion of ethylbenzene (3.2%) and styrene yield (0.8%) were observed (run 1) in the dehydrogenation carried out under a carbon dioxide flow at 823 K in the absence of a catalyst."
[3] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with air, activated carbon 17 and graphite 18 were reported to be active catalysts."
[4] "In the reaction with the Cr(0.3)/AC catalyst (Figure 2a), the ethylbenzene conversion increased markedly from 12.9 to 77.9% with an increase in the reaction temperature from 723 to 953 K."
[5] "In the reaction with Ce(0.5)/AC catalyst (Figure 2b), behavior similar to that in the Cr/AC catalyst was observed."
[6] "In the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, carbon monoxide and water besides styrene were formed as products, and the amounts of carbon monoxide and water formed during the reaction agreed well with the amount of styrene."

1. The study focuses on the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using various metal oxides supported on activated carbon in the presence of excess carbon dioxide. 

2. Without a catalyst, the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene at 823 K under carbon dioxide flow resulted in very low conversion and yield.

3. Activated carbon and graphite were reported as active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with air.

4. Increasing the reaction temperature from 723 to 953 K led to a significant increase in ethylbenzene conversion with the Cr(0.3)/AC catalyst.

5. Similar behavior was observed in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with the Ce(0.5)/AC catalyst as with the Cr(0.3)/AC catalyst.

6. In the carbon dioxide atmosphere, carbon monoxide and water were formed along with styrene, and their formation matched the amount of styrene produced.

1. 本研究主要关注在过量二氧化碳存在的条件下，各种金属氧化物负载于活性炭上的乙苯脱氢反应，催化生成苯乙烯。

2. 在没有催化剂的情况下，在823 K下通过二氧化碳流进行的乙苯脱氢反应，转化率和产率非常低。

3. 活性炭和石墨被报道为氧气气氛下乙苯脱氢反应的活性催化剂。

4. 随着反应温度从723升至953 K，Cr(0.3)/AC催化剂的乙苯转化率显著增加。

5. 在Ce(0.5)/AC催化剂上进行的乙苯脱氢反应，其行为与Cr(0.3)/AC催化剂相似。

6. 在二氧化碳气氛中，除了生成苯乙烯之外，还形成了二氧化碳和水，它们的生成量与苯乙烯生成量相符。
