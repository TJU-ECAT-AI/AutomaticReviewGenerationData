[1] "The initial activities of the Cr/AC and Ce/AC catalysts were comparable to that of an iron-loaded activated carbon catalyst reported previously."
[2] "Only chromium(III) oxide and cerium(IV) oxide were detected by X-ray diffraction before and after reactions at higher loading levels, and these species might have been active forms."
[3] "The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over the Cr2O3/AC catalyst is to keep the chromium(III) oxide phase during the reaction."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts affect their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. In the study mentioned, the initial activities of the chromium (Cr)/activated carbon (AC) and cerium (Ce)/AC catalysts were found to be comparable to those of iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that only chromium(III) oxide and cerium(IV) oxide were present before and after the reactions at higher loading levels, suggesting these species might act as active forms. Carbon dioxide plays a crucial role in maintaining the chromium(III) oxide phase during the reaction, contributing to the catalytic performance. However, theoretical modeling challenges remain in understanding the complex interactions and dynamics within these catalytic systems, particularly in balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety. Process optimization requires careful consideration of factors such as reaction temperature, pressure, and the presence of dopants to achieve optimal catalytic activity while minimizing side reactions and ensuring operational safety.

在氧化脱氢反应（如乙基苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯）中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成会影响它们的电子结构和催化性能。根据研究，在Cr/活性炭（AC）和Ce/AC催化剂的初始活性方面，与之前报道的负载铁的活性炭催化剂相当。X射线衍射分析显示，在更高负载水平下反应前后只有铬（III）氧化物和铈（IV）氧化物被检测到，这可能表明这些物种是活性形式。二氧化碳在Cr2O3/AC催化剂上的作用是保持反应期间的铬（III）氧化物相，从而对催化性能产生贡献。然而，在这些催化系统中理解复杂相互作用和动力学的理论建模挑战仍然存在，特别是在平衡效率、选择性和安全性时。过程优化需要仔细考虑反应温度、压力和掺杂剂等因素，以实现最佳的催化活性，同时尽量减少副反应并确保操作安全。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the incorporation of specific dopants and control of vacancy formation can alter the band gap, surface chemistry, and reactivity of the catalysts, enhancing their performance in reactions like ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure modifications resulting from dopants and vacancies, optimizing the catalyst design for maximum efficiency, selectivity, and safety, and accounting for the dynamic nature of the catalytic sites during the reaction process.
