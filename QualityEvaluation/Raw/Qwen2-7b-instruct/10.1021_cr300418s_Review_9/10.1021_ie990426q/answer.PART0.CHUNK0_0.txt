[1] "Very low conversion of ethylbenzene (3.2%) and styrene yield (0.8%) were observed (run 1) in the dehydrogenation carried out under a carbon dioxide flow at 823 K in the absence of a catalyst."
[2] "Higher ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield were observed with various metal-loaded activated carbon catalysts (0.5 mmol/g of carbon, runs 311) than that with the activated carbon."
[3] "In the reaction with the Cr(0.3)/AC catalyst (Figure 2a), the ethylbenzene conversion increased markedly from 12.9 to 77.9% with an increase in the reaction temperature from 723 to 953 K."
[4] "However, the effect of carbon dioxide was negative in the reaction with Ce/AC (runs 12 and 17) on the styrene yield and selectivity."
[5] "Sharp diffraction peaks assigned as Cr2O3 appeared even after the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with argon and carbon dioxide."

1. In the absence of a catalyst, the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene under a carbon dioxide flow at 823 K showed very low conversion and yield of styrene.
2. Various metal-loaded activated carbon catalysts provided higher conversion of ethylbenzene and yield of styrene compared to the activated carbon alone.
3. The reaction temperature significantly affected the conversion of ethylbenzene with chromium-loaded activated carbon catalysts.
4. Carbon dioxide had a negative impact on styrene yield and selectivity when used with cerium-loaded activated carbon catalysts.
5. Even after dehydrogenation with argon or carbon dioxide, chromium(III) oxide remained present in the catalyst.

1. 在没有催化剂的情况下，使用二氧化碳流在823 K下进行的乙基苯脱氢反应显示出极低的乙基苯转化率和苯乙烯产率。
2. 各种金属负载的活性炭催化剂与仅使用活性炭相比，提供了更高的乙基苯转化率和苯乙烯产率。
3. 反应温度对含有铬负载的活性炭催化剂的乙基苯转化率有显著影响。
4. 二氧化碳在使用铈负载的活性炭催化剂时对苯乙烯产率和选择性产生了负面影响。
5. 即使在用氩气或二氧化碳进行脱氢后，仍然在催化剂中检测到铬(III)氧化物。
