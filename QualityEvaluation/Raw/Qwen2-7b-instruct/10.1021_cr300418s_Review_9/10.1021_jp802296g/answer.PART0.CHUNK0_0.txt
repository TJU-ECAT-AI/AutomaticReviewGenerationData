1. The literature mentions that a review article on doped oxides was published in 2002, containing only a few examples. Recent studies suggest that the catalytic activity of metal-on-oxide catalysts might be attributed to the ionic form of the metal. The spin conservation rule is applied to exclude reactions that require flipping a spin, as they are too slow for catalysis. For CO oxidation, the adsorption of O2 on the defective surface of MnxTi1xO2δ (110) is discussed. The energies of various intermediate reactions are summarized in Table 4. The energies of steps 2, 4, and 5 are unaffected by the catalyst's spin state composition.

1. 文献提到，唯一找到的关于掺杂氧化物的综述文章发表于2002年，其中只包含了几例。最近的研究表明，某些金属-氧化物催化剂的催化活性可能归因于金属的离子形式。应用自旋守恒规则排除了需要翻转自旋的反应，因为这类反应催化效率太低。对于CO氧化，对MnxTi1xO2δ（110）缺陷表面吸附O2进行了讨论。各种中间步骤的能量在表4中总结。步骤2、4和5的能量不受催化剂自旋状态组成的的影响。
