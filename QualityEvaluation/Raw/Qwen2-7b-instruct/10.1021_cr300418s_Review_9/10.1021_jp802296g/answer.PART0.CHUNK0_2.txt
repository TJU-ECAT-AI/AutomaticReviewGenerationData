<p>There are indications, from theory and experiment, that substitutionally doped oxides might be a class of interesting partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts. The explicit idea of using doped oxides (or mixed oxides as they were called in the older literature) seems to go back to Cimino and co-workers, (1, 2) who showed that NixMg1xO is more active for N2O decomposition than NiO. Although doped oxides received some attention in the older literature, (3, 4) there have been few studies of their catalytic activity. The only review article we could find (5) was written in 2002 and contains only a few examples. There are recent papers (6-13) proposing that the catalytic activity of certain metal-on-oxide catalysts is due to the ionic form of the metal; for example, the active catalytic centers in the Au/ceria catalyst for the water-gas shift reaction or CO oxidation are Au ions. These papers are somewhat controversial because the proof that the catalyst is ionic is indirect, and there is also the possibility that small, undetected neutral clusters are responsible for the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Doping is not always beneficial. Ceria doped with Sm, Gd, La, Nb, and Ta has lower activity toward n-butane oxidation (47) than ceria alone, and doping ceria with La, Pr, Gd, or Nb slows down CO oxidation. (27) A group at Daihatsu Motors and Cataler Corporation found (14-17) that the doped perovskite LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 has better catalytic properties and higher thermal stability than the conventional automotive exhaust catalyst of Pd-metal clusters supported on alumina.</p>
<p>These articles suggest that doped oxides might be a promising class of catalysts. Considering that a large number of oxides can be combined with a large number of dopants and considering the large number of oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions that might be catalyzed by such compounds, we feel that the potential of this class of catalyst has not been fully explored by either theory or experiment. This prompted us to use density functional theory (DFT) to examine several doped oxides to determine the extent to which they might be good oxidation catalysts.</p>

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling faces difficulties in accurately describing the energetics of oxygen vacancy formation and the chemistry of doped oxides, especially for narrow band oxides like TiO2.
2. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety requires a deep understanding of the interactions between dopants, oxygen vacancies, and reactants, which can be complex and not fully understood.
3. Process optimization demands precise control over dopant incorporation, oxygen pressure, and reaction conditions, which can be challenging to achieve in industrial settings.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，掺杂方法、掺杂剂浓度和空位形成影响它们在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能。这些催化系统的理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战包括：

1. 理论建模面临的困难在于准确描述氧空位形成的能力学和掺杂氧化物的化学性质，尤其是对窄带氧化物如TiO2。
2. 平衡效率、选择性和安全性需要深入理解掺杂剂、氧空位和反应物之间的相互作用，这些作用可能复杂且尚未完全理解。
3. 过程优化要求对掺杂剂的引入、氧气压力和反应条件进行精确控制，在工业设置中实现这一目标可能具有挑战性。
