[1] "Doping TiO2 (110) with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn lowers the energy of vacancy formation, and doping with W leaves it practically unchanged."
[2] "The energy of oxygen vacancy formation in (MO)xTi1xO2 (110) with M = V, W, Cr, or Moand in MnxTi1xO2 is smaller than in TiO2 (110)."
[3] "The energy of oxygen vacancy formation is not a good descriptor of the energies of carbonate decomposition to produce CO2 or of the CO reaction with the O2 adsorbed at a vacancy site."
[4] "For the systems in which CO oxidation takes place in two cycles we have used the average (the arithmetic mean) of the two O2 adsorption energies."
[5] "The three energies that change from one catalyst to another (the CO reaction with surface oxygen, the O2 binding to the oxygen vacancy, and the energy of vacancy formation) are related by two linear relations."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Doping TiO2 (110) with V, Cr, Mo, and Mn makes it easier to form oxygen vacancies.
2. The energy of oxygen vacancy formation in the doped oxides is lower than in undoped TiO2 (110).
3. The energy of oxygen vacancy formation is not a reliable indicator of the efficiency of carbon dioxide production or the CO reaction with adsorbed oxygen.
4. For catalysts undergoing two cycles, the average O2 adsorption energy is used.
5. The three changing energies (CO interaction with surface oxygen, O2 binding to vacancy, and vacancy energy formation) are linked by linear relationships.

1. 添加V、Cr、Mo和Mn到TiO2（110）中可以使氧空位更容易形成。
2. 在掺杂氧化物中的氧空位形成能量低于未掺杂的TiO2（110）。
3. 氧空位形成能不是判断二氧化碳生成效率或CO与吸附氧反应效率的好指标。
4. 对于经历两次循环的催化剂，使用平均O2吸附能量。
5. 变化的三种能量（表面氧的CO相互作用、O2绑定到空位以及空位的能量形成）通过线性关系联系起来。
