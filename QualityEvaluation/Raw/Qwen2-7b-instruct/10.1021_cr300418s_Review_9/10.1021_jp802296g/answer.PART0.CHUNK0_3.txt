[1] "We used density functional theory to study CO oxidation catalyzed by TiO2(110), in which some Ti atoms on the surface are replaced with V, Cr, Mo, W, or Mn."
[2] "We find that these materials oxidize CO by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the role of the dopant is to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies."
[3] "In deciding which intermediate reactions are most likely from an energetic point of view, we impose a spin conservation rule: a reaction that requires flipping a spin is too slow for catalysis."
[4] "Because of this, we only consider reactions that conserve spin."
[5] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene by affecting the ability to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies and conserve spin. Lowering the energy of vacancy formation through dopants makes the doped oxides better oxidants than the undoped ones, enhancing their catalytic performance in these reactions.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成通过影响促进氧空位形成的能力以及保持自旋来影响电子结构和氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）的催化性能。通过降低空位形成所需的能量，掺杂剂使掺杂氧化物比未掺杂的氧化物更有效地作为氧化剂，从而增强这些反应的催化性能。
