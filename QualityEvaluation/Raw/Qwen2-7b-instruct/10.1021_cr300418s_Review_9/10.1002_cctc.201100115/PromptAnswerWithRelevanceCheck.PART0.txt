The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the surface acidity, dispersion of nanoparticles, and interaction between metal and support. The use of a novel dry nanodispersion method leads to the dispersion of NiO nanoparticles on Nb2O5 materials, enhancing the catalytic performance for ethane ammoxidation. The surface acidity of niobium-supported catalysts is higher compared to unsupported NiO nanoparticles, contributing to better catalytic activity. The size and aggregation of NiO nanoparticles are controlled by the dopant concentration, impacting the dispersion and reactivity. Vacancy formation in the materials can alter the electronic structure, influencing the catalytic efficiency. The nature of the support, in this case, Nb2O5, significantly affects the reactivity of NiO nanoparticles, leading to different catalytic behaviors for ethane ammoxidation and oxidative dehydration. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety involve understanding the complex interactions between the metal, support, and reactants, predicting the optimal conditions for desired reactions, and ensuring the stability and longevity of the catalysts.

Tuning of Active Sites in NiNbO Catalysts for the Direct Conversion of Ethane to Acetonitrile or Ethylene

The results of this study demonstrate that NiO nanoparticles are active for ethane activation and that their catalytic performance can be modulated through the use of the appropriate support. These nanoparticles are dispersed on the surface of two different Nb2O5 materials by using a novel dry nanodispersion method. The catalysts obtained by the proposed route are promising catalytic materials for the ethane ammoxidation.

NiO nanoparticles that are highly active for the ethane activation have been prepared. These nanoparticles have been dispersed on the surface of two different Nb2O5 materials by using a novel dry nanodispersion method. This article describes the characterization and catalytic behavior of both series of catalysts as well as the nature of the active sites required for the transformation of ethane into acetonitrile and/or ethylene. It is demonstrated how such active sites present in the catalysts are obtained through this novel dry mixing method. The catalysts obtained are promising catalytic materials for both, ethane ammoxidation and oxidative dehydration (ODH) reactions.

The synthesis method for a given catalyst composition has a dramatic effect on performance. It has been demonstrated that the catalytic materials prepared by using the dry dispersion method are active and selective for both ammoxidation and ODH reactions and that the catalytic behavior of the materials is determined by the nature of the support.

For NiO,NiNbO mixed phases and acid sites are required to obtain selective and active catalysts for ammoxidation. The Nano-series catalysts exhibit the right combination of acidic sites near the incipient NiNbO phase for the appropriate activation of ethane and ammonia and their conversion into acetonitrile. In the case of the Micro-series catalysts, the dispersion of NiO nanoparticles on the Nb2O5 material results in a catalytic material that present good performance for the oxidative dehydration (ODH) reaction, which confirms that the NiNb interaction is efficient for ethane activation.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the use of a novel dry nanodispersion method allows for the modulation of catalytic performance through the dispersion of NiO nanoparticles on different Nb2O5 materials, leading to promising catalysts for ethane ammoxidation and oxidative dehydration (ODH) reactions. The Nano-series catalysts exhibit an optimal combination of acidic sites and NiNbO phases for the effective activation of ethane and ammonia, enabling the conversion into acetonitrile. Meanwhile, the Micro-series catalysts, with dispersed NiO nanoparticles on Nb2O5, show high performance in the ODH reaction, confirming the efficiency of the NiNb interaction in ethane activation. The choice of support plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic behavior of the materials, influencing their activity and selectivity in the targeted reactions.
