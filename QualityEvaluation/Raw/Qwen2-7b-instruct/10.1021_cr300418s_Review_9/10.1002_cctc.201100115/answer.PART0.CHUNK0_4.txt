The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by modulating their reactivity towards ethane and ammonia. The nanostructured materials, specifically those with high surface areas and optimized interface formation between NiO and Nb2O5, facilitate the right combination of acidic sites for effective activation of ethane and ammonia, leading to efficient conversion into acetonitrile. This results in promising catalysts for the ethane-ammoxidation reaction.
