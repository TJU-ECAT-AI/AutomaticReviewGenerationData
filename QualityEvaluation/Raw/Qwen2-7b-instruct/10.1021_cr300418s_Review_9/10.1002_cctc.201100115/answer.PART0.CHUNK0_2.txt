[1] "The synthesis method for a given catalyst composition has a dramatic effect on performance."
[2] "It has been demonstrated that the catalytic materials prepared by using the dry dispersion method are active and selective for both ammoxidation and ODH reactions and that the catalytic behavior of the materials is determined by the nature of the support."
[3] "The materials obtained by using the Nb2O5-Nano support present high surface area values and are able to form the active phases (NiNbO at the interface between NiO and Nb2O5) near the acidic sites for the bifunctional ammoxidation of ethane to acetonitrile."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The use of a dry dispersion method enhances the catalyst's performance for both ammoxidation and oxidative dehydration (ODH) reactions, with the catalytic behavior largely determined by the nature of the support. The materials prepared using the Nb2O5-Nano support exhibit high surface area values, facilitating the formation of active phases (NiNbO) at the interface between NiO and Nb2O5 near the acidic sites, which is crucial for the bifunctional ammoxidation of ethane to acetonitrile.

在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对其电子结构和催化性能产生显著影响。采用干燥分散法可以提高催化剂在氧化脱氢化和氧化脱水（ODH）反应中的活性和选择性，并且催化剂的行为主要由支撑材料的性质决定。使用Nb2O5-Nano支持制备的材料具有较高的表面积值，能够促进NiO和Nb2O5界面附近酸性位点附近的活性相（NiNbO）的形成，这对于乙烷的双功能氨化转化为丙酮腈至关重要。
