The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the surface acidity, dispersion of nanoparticles, and interaction between metal and support. The use of a novel dry nanodispersion method leads to the dispersion of NiO nanoparticles on Nb2O5 materials, enhancing the catalytic performance for ethane ammoxidation. The surface acidity of niobium-supported catalysts is higher compared to unsupported NiO nanoparticles, contributing to better catalytic activity. The size and aggregation of NiO nanoparticles are controlled by the dopant concentration, impacting the dispersion and reactivity. Vacancy formation in the materials can alter the electronic structure, influencing the catalytic efficiency. The nature of the support, in this case, Nb2O5, significantly affects the reactivity of NiO nanoparticles, leading to different catalytic behaviors for ethane ammoxidation and oxidative dehydration. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety involve understanding the complex interactions between the metal, support, and reactants, predicting the optimal conditions for desired reactions, and ensuring the stability and longevity of the catalysts.
