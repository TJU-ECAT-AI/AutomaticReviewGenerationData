In the first part of this series [5], we reported the development of bulk NiNbO mixed oxides as highly active and selective catalysts for ethane ODH. The Ni NbO multicomponent oxides combine both high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, resulting in an overall ethene yield of 46% at 400 C.

Detailed characterization of a series of NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni ratio (from 0 to 0.67) has been reported previously [5]. An overview of the characterization results indicates that the key component for this excellent catalytic behavior is the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping of NiO with Nb,since small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalytic material.

Optimum incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice was achieved for a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst),since higher Nb concentrations led to the saturation of the lat- tice sites available for substitution and segregation of the nickel and niobium phases.

Nickel sites were recognized as the active sites responsible for the activation of the paraffinic substrate,with niobium affecting mainly the selectivity to olefin by modifying the oxygen species on the catalytic surface.

The present work is complementary to the characterization and catalytic performance study of the NiNbO oxides reported earlier [5] and aims to obtain insight into the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation pathways over this new promising class of catalytic materials.

Several previous studies have addressed the details of the primary and secondary steps of the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction [69]. It is widely accepted that over reducible oxides, with operating temperature below 500600 C, the reaction proceeds via a redox (Marsvan Krev- elen [MVK]) type mechanism in two steps: reduction of the cat- alyst by the alkane with extraction of lattice oxygen, followed by reoxidation of the reduced catalyst by molecular dioxygen.

In the present study, we use various isotopic 18O2 exchange techniques on pure NiO and Nb-doped NiO to probe the nature of the active and selective sites and elucidate the ODH reaction mechanism.

Even though the kinetic studies cannot determine the molecular mechanism, they allow the exclusion of possible reaction pathways and help obtain a quantitative analysis for the participation of particular reaction routes (e.g., paral- lel vs. consecutive reactions) and different catalytic sites in the proposed mechanism.

The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the detailed reaction pathways, accurately predicting the catalytic performance under various conditions, optimizing the catalyst design for improved efficiency and selectivity, and ensuring the safety of the process.

The kinetic modeling indicates that the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, with the participation of two types of active sites: type I sites, responsible for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2.

Based on the indications derived from the 18O2 isotopic experiments, type I sites correspond to strongly bonded lattice O2 species, whereas type II sites correspond to the limited amount of nonstoichiometric Ospecies remaining on the surface after the incorporation of niobium.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The doping of nickel oxide with niobium forms a solid solution, enhancing the catalytic properties by combining high activity at low temperatures with high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels. The optimal niobium concentration, around 0.176 for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, saturates the lattice sites and affects the selectivity to olefin by modifying the oxygen species on the catalytic surface. The reaction proceeds via a redox mechanism, with the participation of two types of active sites: type I for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and ethene overoxidation, and type II for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2. The key challenges in modeling, optimizing, and balancing these systems include understanding the detailed reaction pathways, predicting performance under various conditions, optimizing catalyst design for efficiency and selectivity, and ensuring process safety.
