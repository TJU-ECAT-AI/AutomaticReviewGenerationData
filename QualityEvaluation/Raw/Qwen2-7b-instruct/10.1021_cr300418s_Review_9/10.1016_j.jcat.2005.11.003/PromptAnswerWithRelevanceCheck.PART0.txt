<p>However, the route for replenishing surface oxygen differs between the two oxides, leading to different oxygen species on the surface and consequently to the different product distribution observed in the ethane ODH reaction.</p>
<p>On NiO, replenishment occurs by rapid dissociation of gaseous oxygen on the cation vacancies with slower incorporation and diffusion, hence leading to large concentrations of electrophilic oxygen species on the surface. Niobium filling the cationic vacancies and reducing the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface.</p>
<p>Finally, a kinetic model able to successfully predict the catalytic performance of the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst in considerably different experimental conditions than the kinetic experiments, was developed.</p>

1. The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure by altering the availability of active sites and oxygen species on the surface. This impacts their catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include accurately predicting the electronic structure, understanding the role of different oxygen species, and accounting for the dynamic behavior of the catalyst surface under various reaction conditions.

2. The model developed successfully predicts the catalytic performance of the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst under experimental conditions different from those used in kinetic studies. This highlights the importance of considering the interplay between dopant concentration, vacancy formation, and electronic structure in achieving optimal catalytic performance.

3. The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation lead to distinct electronic structures and oxygen species on the surface of nickel oxide catalysts. This results in different catalytic behaviors, particularly in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. Challenges in modeling include capturing the complex interactions between oxygen species, active sites, and the catalyst's electronic properties under dynamic reaction conditions. Optimizing these systems requires a deep understanding of how these factors influence the catalyst's selectivity and efficiency.

4. The development of a kinetic model that can accurately predict the performance of the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst under different conditions demonstrates the effectiveness of considering the specific electronic and structural characteristics of the catalyst. This underscores the importance of detailed characterization and mechanistic insights in designing catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Achieving a balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety necessitates a comprehensive approach that integrates fundamental understanding with practical process optimization.

<quotes>
NiO exhibits almost twice the surface ethane activation rate than the NiNbO catalyst at the same reaction temperature, whereas the rate of oxygen exchange for NiO in the TPIE experiments appears to be again double in the 400500 C range. This implies a correlation between the ability of the catalysts to convert ethane and exchange oxygen on the surface. Therefore, it can be postulated that the high surface activity of NiO in the ethane ODH reaction is a result of highly active oxygen species, which, however, fully oxidize ethane to CO2. The addition of niobium reduces or eliminates this type of oxygen species, which can be assigned,based on O2-TPD studies performed on these materials [5] and literature reports [43], to nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The correlation between ethane conversion capability and oxygen exchange rate on the surface indicates that the high surface activity of NiO in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is due to highly reactive oxygen species. However, these species fully oxidize ethane to carbon dioxide. The addition of niobium reduces or eliminates such oxygen species, which are characterized as nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species based on thermogravimetric analysis (O2-TPD) and literature reports.

Despite the power-law models simplicity, it adequately predicts the main trends of the reaction and provides a good fitting of the experimental results. The total oxidation reactions of both ethane and produced ethene to CO2 have a much lower rate than the oxydehydrogenation reaction, conforming to the high selectivity recorded over the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst. On all three reactions, the power on the hydrocarbon (ethane or ethene) partial pressure is around 0.5. Concerning the effect of oxygen concentration in the feed, we can see that in the case of the oxy- dehydrogenation reaction and secondary oxidation of produced ethene, oxygen has a lower effect on the reaction rates, with similar power for oxygen on both reactions, ranging between
0.2 and 0.3. In contrast, in the primary oxidation of ethene to carbon dioxide, oxygen plays the dominant role, with almost first-order dependence of the reaction rate on oxygen concentration.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Despite its simplicity, the power-law model accurately captures the reaction's primary trends and matches the experimental outcomes well. The total oxidation reactions of both ethane and produced ethene to CO2 occur at much slower rates than the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, aligning with the high selectivity observed on the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst. Across all three reactions, the exponent related to hydrocarbon (ethane or ethene) partial pressure is approximately 0.5. Regarding the impact of oxygen concentration in the feed, it's evident that in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction and secondary oxidation of produced ethene, oxygen's influence on reaction rates is lower, with comparable powers for oxygen across both reactions, ranging between 0.2 and 0.3. Conversely, in the primary oxidation of ethene to carbon dioxide, oxygen holds a pivotal role, exhibiting nearly a first-order dependence on oxygen concentration.

尽管幂律模型的简化，它仍能准确地捕捉到反应的主要趋势并很好地拟合实验结果。乙烷和生成的乙醇到二氧化碳的总氧化反应速率远低于脱氢化反应，这与Ni0.85Nb0.15催化剂上记录的高选择性相符。在所有三个反应中，与烃（乙烷或乙醇）分压相关的指数约为0.5。关于进料中氧气浓度的影响，可以看出，在脱氢化反应和生成的乙醇的二次氧化中，氧气对反应速率的影响较小，两个反应中氧气的作用力范围大致在0.2至0.3之间。相反，在乙醇到二氧化碳的初步氧化中，氧气起主导作用，显示出接近于氧气浓度的线性依赖关系。

In the first part of this series [5], we reported the development of bulk NiNbO mixed oxides as highly active and selective catalysts for ethane ODH. The Ni NbO multicomponent oxides combine both high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, resulting in an overall ethene yield of 46% at 400 C.

Detailed characterization of a series of NiNbO oxides with varying Nb/Ni ratio (from 0 to 0.67) has been reported previously [5]. An overview of the characterization results indicates that the key component for this excellent catalytic behavior is the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping of NiO with Nb,since small amounts of niobium effectively convert NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an effective ODH catalytic material.

Optimum incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice was achieved for a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst),since higher Nb concentrations led to the saturation of the lat- tice sites available for substitution and segregation of the nickel and niobium phases.

Nickel sites were recognized as the active sites responsible for the activation of the paraffinic substrate,with niobium affecting mainly the selectivity to olefin by modifying the oxygen species on the catalytic surface.

The present work is complementary to the characterization and catalytic performance study of the NiNbO oxides reported earlier [5] and aims to obtain insight into the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation pathways over this new promising class of catalytic materials.

Several previous studies have addressed the details of the primary and secondary steps of the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction [69]. It is widely accepted that over reducible oxides, with operating temperature below 500600 C, the reaction proceeds via a redox (Marsvan Krev- elen [MVK]) type mechanism in two steps: reduction of the cat- alyst by the alkane with extraction of lattice oxygen, followed by reoxidation of the reduced catalyst by molecular dioxygen.

In the present study, we use various isotopic 18O2 exchange techniques on pure NiO and Nb-doped NiO to probe the nature of the active and selective sites and elucidate the ODH reaction mechanism.

Even though the kinetic studies cannot determine the molecular mechanism, they allow the exclusion of possible reaction pathways and help obtain a quantitative analysis for the participation of particular reaction routes (e.g., paral- lel vs. consecutive reactions) and different catalytic sites in the proposed mechanism.

The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the detailed reaction pathways, accurately predicting the catalytic performance under various conditions, optimizing the catalyst design for improved efficiency and selectivity, and ensuring the safety of the process.

The kinetic modeling indicates that the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Nb/NiO occurs via a redox parallel-consecutive reaction network, with the participation of two types of active sites: type I sites, responsible for the ethane ODH and ethene overoxidation reaction, and type II sites, active for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2.

Based on the indications derived from the 18O2 isotopic experiments, type I sites correspond to strongly bonded lattice O2 species, whereas type II sites correspond to the limited amount of nonstoichiometric Ospecies remaining on the surface after the incorporation of niobium.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The doping of nickel oxide with niobium forms a solid solution, enhancing the catalytic properties by combining high activity at low temperatures with high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels. The optimal niobium concentration, around 0.176 for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, saturates the lattice sites and affects the selectivity to olefin by modifying the oxygen species on the catalytic surface. The reaction proceeds via a redox mechanism, with the participation of two types of active sites: type I for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and ethene overoxidation, and type II for the direct oxidation of ethane to CO2. The key challenges in modeling, optimizing, and balancing these systems include understanding the detailed reaction pathways, predicting performance under various conditions, optimizing catalyst design for efficiency and selectivity, and ensuring process safety.
