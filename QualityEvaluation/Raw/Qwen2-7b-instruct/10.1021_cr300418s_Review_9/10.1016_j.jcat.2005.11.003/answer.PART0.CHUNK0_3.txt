The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene has been studied over a wide range of materials [14]; however,most catalysts suffer from low yields at high conversion due to the thermodynamically favored oxidation of both reactant and product to carbon oxides. In the first part of this series [5], we reported the development of bulk NiNbO mixed oxides as highly active and selective catalysts for ethane ODH. The Ni NbO multicomponent oxides combine both high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels, resulting in an overall ethene yield of 46% at 400 C.
