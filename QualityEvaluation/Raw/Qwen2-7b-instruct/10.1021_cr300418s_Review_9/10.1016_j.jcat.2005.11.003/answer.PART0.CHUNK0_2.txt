NiO exhibits almost twice the surface ethane activation rate than the NiNbO catalyst at the same reaction temperature, whereas the rate of oxygen exchange for NiO in the TPIE experiments appears to be again double in the 400500 C range. This implies a correlation between the ability of the catalysts to convert ethane and exchange oxygen on the surface. Therefore, it can be postulated that the high surface activity of NiO in the ethane ODH reaction is a result of highly active oxygen species, which, however, fully oxidize ethane to CO2. The addition of niobium reduces or eliminates this type of oxygen species, which can be assigned,based on O2-TPD studies performed on these materials [5] and literature reports [43], to nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species.

The correlation between ethane conversion capability and oxygen exchange rate on the surface indicates that the high surface activity of NiO in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is due to highly reactive oxygen species. However, these species fully oxidize ethane to carbon dioxide. The addition of niobium reduces or eliminates such oxygen species, which are characterized as nonstoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species based on thermogravimetric analysis (O2-TPD) and literature reports.

催化活性与表面氧交换率之间的相关性表明，NiO在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的高表面活性是由于高度反应性的氧物种所致。然而，这些物种完全将乙烷氧化为二氧化碳。铌的添加可以减少或消除这样的氧物种，根据热重分析（O2-TPD）和文献报告，它们被归类为非等价的电负性氧物种。

Despite the power-law models simplicity, it adequately predicts the main trends of the reaction and provides a good fitting of the experimental results. The total oxidation reactions of both ethane and produced ethene to CO2 have a much lower rate than the oxydehydrogenation reaction, conforming to the high selectivity recorded over the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst. On all three reactions, the power on the hydrocarbon (ethane or ethene) partial pressure is around 0.5. Concerning the effect of oxygen concentration in the feed, we can see that in the case of the oxy- dehydrogenation reaction and secondary oxidation of produced ethene, oxygen has a lower effect on the reaction rates, with similar power for oxygen on both reactions, ranging between
0.2 and 0.3. In contrast, in the primary oxidation of ethene to carbon dioxide, oxygen plays the dominant role, with almost first-order dependence of the reaction rate on oxygen concentration.

Despite its simplicity, the power-law model accurately captures the reaction's primary trends and matches the experimental outcomes well. The total oxidation reactions of both ethane and produced ethene to CO2 occur at much slower rates than the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, aligning with the high selectivity observed on the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst. Across all three reactions, the exponent related to hydrocarbon (ethane or ethene) partial pressure is approximately 0.5. Regarding the impact of oxygen concentration in the feed, it's evident that in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction and secondary oxidation of produced ethene, oxygen's influence on reaction rates is lower, with comparable powers for oxygen across both reactions, ranging between 0.2 and 0.3. Conversely, in the primary oxidation of ethene to carbon dioxide, oxygen holds a pivotal role, exhibiting nearly a first-order dependence on oxygen concentration.

尽管幂律模型的简化，它仍能准确地捕捉到反应的主要趋势并很好地拟合实验结果。乙烷和生成的乙醇到二氧化碳的总氧化反应速率远低于脱氢化反应，这与Ni0.85Nb0.15催化剂上记录的高选择性相符。在所有三个反应中，与烃（乙烷或乙醇）分压相关的指数约为0.5。关于进料中氧气浓度的影响，可以看出，在脱氢化反应和生成的乙醇的二次氧化中，氧气对反应速率的影响较小，两个反应中氧气的作用力范围大致在0.2至0.3之间。相反，在乙醇到二氧化碳的初步氧化中，氧气起主导作用，显示出接近于氧气浓度的线性依赖关系。
