The formation of LixNi1xO solid solutions is typically achieved through a solid-state reaction of Ni2+ precursor and Li2CO3 in air at temperatures between 700 and 900°C. For Li atomic fraction x > 0.3, a rhombohedral distortion of the cubic structure by partial lithium and nickel ions ordering on alternate 1 1 1 planes takes place, leading to a hexagonal structure. Electrical conductivity increases remarkably by doping NiO with lithium ions, with the electrical conductivity increasing owing to both the increase of the holes and the decrease of the activation energy Ea. Lithium loss occurs from the solid solution at high temperatures, with the evaporation of lithium oxide being a diffusion-controlled process governed by a parabolic law.

镍氧化物基催化剂的形成通常通过在700至900°C的空气中的Ni2+前体和Li2CO3的固态反应来实现。对于Li原子分数x > 0.3，通过部分锂和镍离子在交替的1 1 1平面上的排列导致立方结构的畸变，形成六角形结构。通过向镍氧化物中掺杂锂离子，电导率显著增加，电导率的增加归因于空穴数量的增加以及激活能Ea的降低。锂氧化物从固体溶液在高温下的蒸发是一个由扩散控制的过程，遵循抛物线定律。对于x = 0.13的LixNi1xO，在1200-1400°C的温度范围内，锂氧化物的蒸发得到的能量为209 kJ mol−1。
