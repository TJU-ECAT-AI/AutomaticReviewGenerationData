<p>Lithium nickel oxide solid solutions (LixNi1xO) are an important class of materials whose chemical, magnetic and transport properties have been extensively studied.</p>
<p>The formation of the solid solution from NiO and Li2CO3 powder mixture takes place as in the following reactions:</p>
<p>Accordingly, the oxygen atmosphere promotes the solid solution formation.</p>
<p>They observed that the cubic phase is maintained up to x = 0.3; then an eight-fold increase in the unit cell volume occurs between x = 0.30 and 0.38, and finally a hexagonal phase is obtained for x > 0.38.</p>
<p>The lithiation of NiO surface followed by Li+ diffusion into the interior of the oxide particle was observed also by Sata [23].</p>
<p>It must be denoted by the following: (1) thermal treatment being equal, there is a tendency to increase the vacancy concentration by increasing the lithium content in the starting mixture. (2) Nominal composition being equal, the vacancy concentration increases by increasing the temperature of the thermal treatment.</p>
<p>According to van Houten [51], the wandering of a hole through the lattice can be treated as a thermally activated diffusion process with a mobility:= ed2ν0 exp(Ea/kT) kT</p>
<p>Koumoto et al. [78] evaluated the dependence of electrical conductivity of LixNi1xO with x = 0.002 on oxygen partial pressure PO2 in the temperature range 8001400 C.</p>
<p>The Seebeck coefficient is generally expressed by the following equation:a = 1 eT(EF + AkT)</p>
<p>Li-doped NiO has high electrical conductivity but low thermopower. To increase the thermopower, additional Na doping on Li-doped NiO was carried out [80], thus increasing the power factor, as shown in Fig. 13.</p>

The document provides detailed information on the formation, structure, and transport properties of LixNi1xO solid solutions, particularly those with x ≤ 0.3. These materials have been extensively studied for their chemical, magnetic, and transport properties. The formation typically involves solid-state reactions of nickel oxide and lithium carbonate, with lithium substitution for nickel leading to a semiconductor phase. As lithium content increases, a rhombohedral distortion occurs, eventually forming a hexagonal structure. The electrical conductivity of LixNi1xO increases significantly upon lithium doping, influenced by factors such as the lithium content and thermal treatment conditions. The Seebeck coefficient shows a complex behavior, varying with temperature and lithium content. Lithium loss from the solid solutions at high temperatures follows a diffusion-controlled process, with the activation energy varying across different temperatures and lithium fractions. The power factor of Li-doped NiO can be enhanced by additional sodium doping, improving its thermoelectric performance.
