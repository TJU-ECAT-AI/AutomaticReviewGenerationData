镍氧化物基催化剂的形成通常通过在700至900°C的空气中的Ni2+前体和Li2CO3的固态反应来实现。对于Li原子分数x > 0.3，通过部分锂和镍离子在交替的1 1 1平面上的排列导致立方结构的畸变，形成六角形结构。通过向镍氧化物中掺杂锂离子，电导率显著增加，电导率的增加归因于空穴数量的增加以及激活能Ea的降低。锂氧化物从固体溶液在高温下的蒸发是一个由扩散控制的过程，遵循抛物线定律。对于x = 0.13的LixNi1xO，在1200-1400°C的温度范围内，锂氧化物的蒸发得到的能量为209 kJ mol−1。

1. The electrical conductivity of nickel oxide (NiO) is proportional to the concentration of positive holes in the lattice, as described by the relation σ = e[h•]. By doping NiO with lithium ions, the conductivity significantly increases.

2. The electrical conductivity of lithium-nickel oxide (LixNi1xO) exhibits a remarkable increase upon the introduction of very low amounts of lithium (x < 0.001), followed by a nearly linear increase up to x = 0.2.

3. The activation energy decreases sharply with the increase in lithium content (x) initially, and then gradually at a slower rate.

4. The conductivity of NiO and LixNi1xO can be calculated using the equation σ = C T exp(Ea/kT), where C is a constant proportional to the concentration of positive holes.

5. At constant temperature, the Seebeck coefficient (thermoelectric power) is influenced by the lithium atomic fraction (x) in LixNi1xO, exhibiting a logarithmic dependence.

6. Increasing the temperature causes a significant increase in the Seebeck coefficient in LixNi1xO, suggesting a band conduction mechanism rather than thermally activated hopping of small polarons.

7. The power factor of Li-doped nickel oxide can be enhanced through additional sodium doping, thereby increasing the thermopower.

The document provides detailed information on the formation, structure, and transport properties of LixNi1xO solid solutions, particularly those with x ≤ 0.3. These materials have been extensively studied for their chemical, magnetic, and transport properties. The formation typically involves solid-state reactions of nickel oxide and lithium carbonate, with lithium substitution for nickel leading to a semiconductor phase. As lithium content increases, a rhombohedral distortion occurs, eventually forming a hexagonal structure. The electrical conductivity of LixNi1xO increases significantly upon lithium doping, influenced by factors such as the lithium content and thermal treatment conditions. The Seebeck coefficient shows a complex behavior, varying with temperature and lithium content. Lithium loss from the solid solutions at high temperatures follows a diffusion-controlled process, with the activation energy varying across different temperatures and lithium fractions. The power factor of Li-doped NiO can be enhanced by additional sodium doping, improving its thermoelectric performance.
