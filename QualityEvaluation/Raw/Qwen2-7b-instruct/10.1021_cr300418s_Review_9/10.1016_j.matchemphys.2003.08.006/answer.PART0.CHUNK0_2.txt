[2] "Many papers have been devoted to the formation of LixNi1xO solid solutions. Solid state reaction of Ni2+ precursor and Li2CO3 in air in the temperature range 700900 C is the method commonly used to obtain LixNi1xO solid solutions."
[3] "According to the authors, the most probable cause of the decrease in lithia take-up with high Li2CO3 contents and of the retention of undoped NiO after the initial firing was that penetration of atmospheric oxygen into NiO pellets has been obstructed by the presence of liquid carbonate in the voids between the particles."

1. The formation, structure, and transport properties of LixNi1xO solid solutions with x 0.3 are detailed in the document. The common method for creating these solutions involves a solid-state reaction of Ni2+ precursor and Li2CO3 in air at a temperature range of 700 to 900°C.

2. The decrease in lithium uptake with high Li2CO3 content and retention of undoped NiO after initial firing can be attributed to the obstruction of atmospheric oxygen penetration into NiO pellets due to the presence of liquid carbonate in the voids between particles.

3. Shrinkage by liquid phase sintering occurs at 750°C for samples with a significant amount of Li2CO3 (x > 0.2).

4. The activation energy Ea varies with the lithium atomic fraction x in LixNi1xO across a temperature range of 27 to 27°C.

5. The Seebeck coefficient α is influenced by temperature, with a decrease at low temperatures followed by a slight increase at high temperatures.

6. To enhance the thermopower of Li-doped NiO, additional Na doping was conducted.

7. Lithium oxide loss from the solid solution happens at high temperatures, with a mechanism involving grain-boundary diffusion in the initial stage and volume diffusion for longer durations.

8. An activation energy of 344 kJ/mol1 for the initial stage of vaporization corresponds to the reaction heat from Li2O(c) to Li2O2(g) vapor.

1. 描述了x为0.3的LixNi1xO固溶体形成、结构和传输性质。通常，通过在700至900°C的空气中进行Ni2+前体和Li2CO3的固态反应来制备LixNi1xO固溶体。

2. 高Li2CO3含量下的锂吸收减少以及初始烧结后未掺杂NiO的保留可以归因于大气氧渗透被颗粒间液体碳酸盐阻碍。

3. 当样品具有显著的Li2CO3（x > 0.2）时，在750°C会发生由液相烧结引起的收缩。

4. 在27到27°C的温度范围内，x在LixNi1xO中的激活能Ea有所变化。

5. 见热系数α受温度影响，在低温下下降，然后在高温下略有增加。

6. 为了提高Li掺杂NiO的热电功率，进行了额外的Na掺杂。

7. 高温下，从固溶体中失去锂氧化物的机制包括在初始阶段的晶界扩散，随后是长时间的体积扩散。

8. 对于二次阶段的初始时间，产生344 kJ/mol1的激活能量对应于Li2O(c)到Li2O2(g)蒸汽的反应热。
