[1] "The electrical conductivity σ of NiO is proportional to the concentration of positive holes [h•] in the lattice according to the relation:σ = e[h•] (5) where e is the electronic charge and  the mobility of positive holes."
[2] "The electrical conductivity increases in a remarkable way by doping NiO with lithium ions [51]."
[3] "Fig. 10 shows the dependence of the electrical conductivity at room temperature on Li atomic fraction x in LixNi1xO. As can be seen, a remarkable increase in the electrical conductivity occurs following introduction into NiO lattice of very low Li amount (x < 0.001); then it has an almost linear slight increase of the conductivity with x up to 0.2."
[4] "The activation energy at first decreases sharply with x, and later much more slowly."
[5] "From Eqs. (5) and (6) we obtain σ = C T exp
Ea kT
(7) where C is a constant proportional to [h•]."
[6] "The temperature-independent hole mobility indicates that no activation energy is needed for hole conduction."
[7] "The Seebeck coefficient α is generally expressed by the following equation:a = 1 eT
(EF + AkT) (8) where EF is the energy of the Fermi level and AkT is a kinetic energy transport term."
[8] "From Eqs. (8) and (9), the Seebeck coefficient at fixed temperature seems to depend on lithium atomic fraction as log(12x)/x."
[9] "Li-doped NiO has high electrical conductivity but low thermopower."
[10] "To increase the thermopower, additional Na doping on Li-doped NiO was carried out [80], thus increasing the power factor, as shown in Fig. 13."

1. The electrical conductivity of nickel oxide (NiO) is proportional to the concentration of positive holes in the lattice, as described by the relation σ = e[h•]. By doping NiO with lithium ions, the conductivity significantly increases.

2. The electrical conductivity of lithium-nickel oxide (LixNi1xO) exhibits a remarkable increase upon the introduction of very low amounts of lithium (x < 0.001), followed by a nearly linear increase up to x = 0.2.

3. The activation energy decreases sharply with the increase in lithium content (x) initially, and then gradually at a slower rate.

4. The conductivity of NiO and LixNi1xO can be calculated using the equation σ = C T exp(Ea/kT), where C is a constant proportional to the concentration of positive holes.

5. At constant temperature, the Seebeck coefficient (thermoelectric power) is influenced by the lithium atomic fraction (x) in LixNi1xO, exhibiting a logarithmic dependence.

6. Increasing the temperature causes a significant increase in the Seebeck coefficient in LixNi1xO, suggesting a band conduction mechanism rather than thermally activated hopping of small polarons.

7. The power factor of Li-doped nickel oxide can be enhanced through additional sodium doping, thereby increasing the thermopower.

1. 镍氧化物（NiO）的电导率与其晶格中正空穴的浓度成正比，由关系式σ = e[h•]描述。通过向NiO掺杂锂离子，电导率显著增加。

2. 在引入非常低的锂含量（x < 0.001）后，LixNi1xO的电导率表现出显著的增加，随后在x = 0.2附近呈现出近线性增长。

3. 活化能随着锂含量（x）的增加而急剧下降，然后在较慢的速度逐渐下降。

4. 使用方程σ = C T exp(Ea/kT)可以计算NiO和LixNi1xO的导电性，其中C是与正空穴浓度成比例的常数。

5. 在恒定温度下，LixNi1xO的塞贝克系数（热电动势）对锂原子分数（x）具有对数依赖性。

6. 增加温度导致LixNi1xO的塞贝克系数显著增加，这表明存在带传导机制，而不是热激活的小极子跳跃。

7. 通过额外的钠掺杂，可以增强Li掺杂镍氧化物的功率因子，从而提高热电动势。
