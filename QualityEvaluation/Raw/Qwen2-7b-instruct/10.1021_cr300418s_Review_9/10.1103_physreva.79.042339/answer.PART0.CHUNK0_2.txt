[I] "We propose an efficient scheme for the implementation of quantum information transfer in a one-dimensional coupled resonator waveguide."
[II] "We first demonstrate that the coupled system can be reduced to an effective configuration which supports Raman transitions between the first atom and the end one."
[III] "This Hamiltonian describes direct Raman transitions between the first node and the last one, assisted by the intermediate nodes through virtual photon exchanges."
[IV] "Different from the schemes based on spin chains for short distance quantum communications, the principle advantage of this scheme is that, in the coupled resonator waveguide, individual lattice sites can be addressed with optical lasers."
[V] "We now discuss how to implement QIT in this one-dimensional coupled resonator waveguide."
[VI] "The fidelity is reduced due to the small probabilities of populating either the atomic excited states or the cavity modes."
[VII] "For experimental implementation of QIT in a coupled resonator waveguide, atoms or polar molecules trapped in coupled superconducting stripline microwave resonators are promising candidates."
[VIII] "Then we can estimate the fidelity of this state transfer channel."
[IX] "In Fig. 4 we display the fidelity for various waveguide lengths N."
[X] "Thus the number of cavities should be within 100 to make this scheme efficient."
