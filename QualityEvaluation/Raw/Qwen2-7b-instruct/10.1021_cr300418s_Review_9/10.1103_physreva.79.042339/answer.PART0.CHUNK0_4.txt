Quantum information transfer in a one-dimensional coupled resonator waveguide can be implemented efficiently. This scheme uses effective long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by cavity modes to induce Raman transitions between atoms trapped in different nodes. Quantum information can be transferred directly between the opposite ends of the waveguide without involving intermediate nodes, utilizing either Raman transitions or stimulated Raman adiabatic passages. The key advantage of this method compared to spin chain-based protocols lies in the ability to address individual lattice sites with optical lasers in the coupled resonator waveguide.

在一维耦合谐振子波导中实现量子信息传输可以高效地进行。该方案利用腔模式介导的有效长程偶极-偶极相互作用诱导不同节点中被囚禁原子之间的拉曼跃迁。可以在不涉及中间节点的情况下，直接在波导两端之间传输量子信息，利用的是拉曼跃迁或受激拉曼阿达波特通。与基于自旋链的协议相比，此方法的主要优势在于能够通过光学激光在耦合谐振子波导中对单个晶格点进行寻址。
