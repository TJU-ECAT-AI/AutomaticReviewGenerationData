The proposed scheme allows for the direct transfer of quantum information between the opposite ends of a one-dimensional coupled resonator waveguide, bypassing the intermediate nodes. This is achieved through effective long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by the cavity modes, enabling Raman transitions between trapped atoms in different nodes. Quantum information transfer (QIT) can occur without involving the intermediate nodes, either through Raman transitions or stimulated Raman adiabatic passages. This protocol utilizes the cavity field-induced nonlocal interactions and Raman transitions between atoms at the opposite ends of the waveguide to facilitate the direct transfer of quantum states, representing a significant advancement towards realizing quantum communications.

我们提出了一种在耦合谐振子波导中实现量子信息传输的有效方案。基于原子之间由腔模式介导的有效长程偶极偶极相互作用，不同节点中的原子之间可以发生拉曼跃迁。量子信息可以直接在耦合波导的两端进行传输，无需涉及中间节点，这可以通过拉曼跃迁或受激拉曼绝热过程实现。该协议利用腔场诱导的非局部相互作用和两端原子之间的拉曼跃迁来促进量子状态的直接传输，代表了实现量子通信的一个重要步骤。
