<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Quantum-information transfer in a one-dimensional coupled resonator waveguide is possible through the use of effective long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by cavity modes between atoms. This allows for Raman transitions and stimulated Raman adiabatic passages (STIRAP) to occur, enabling quantum states to be transferred directly from the first node to the end one within the waveguide. The protocol exploits the nonlocal interactions combined with lasers to induce these transitions between atoms trapped in the two ends of the waveguide, facilitating quantum information transfer without involving intermediate nodes. The fidelity of the state transfer can be affected by the probabilities of populating atomic excited states or cavity modes. Experimental implementation of this protocol is feasible using atoms or polar molecules trapped in coupled superconducting stripline microwave resonators, potentially leading to efficient quantum communications in networks using coupled resonators.

The proposed scheme allows for the direct transfer of quantum information between the opposite ends of a one-dimensional coupled resonator waveguide, bypassing the intermediate nodes. This is achieved through effective long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by the cavity modes, enabling Raman transitions between trapped atoms in different nodes. Quantum information transfer (QIT) can occur without involving the intermediate nodes, either through Raman transitions or stimulated Raman adiabatic passages. This protocol utilizes the cavity field-induced nonlocal interactions and Raman transitions between atoms at the opposite ends of the waveguide to facilitate the direct transfer of quantum states, representing a significant advancement towards realizing quantum communications.
