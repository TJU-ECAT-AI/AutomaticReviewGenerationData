The document outlines a method for quantum information transfer in a one-dimensional coupled resonator waveguide. This scheme enables direct quantum information transfer between the opposite ends of the waveguide without involving intermediate nodes, utilizing Raman transitions or stimulated Raman adiabatic passages. It relies on effective long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by cavity modes between atoms. The protocol is compatible with current technology. The fidelity of the transfer is influenced by the probabilities of atomic excited states and cavity modes being populated. To ensure coherent interaction, the effective decay rates E and C must satisfy E,Cr. For practical implementation, atoms or polar molecules trapped in coupled superconducting stripline microwave resonators are suggested as promising candidates.

文档提出了在一维耦合谐振子波导中进行量子信息传输的一种有效方案。该方案允许在不涉及中间节点的情况下，直接在波导两端进行量子信息传输，利用拉曼跃迁或受激拉曼绝热过程。它依赖于腔模式介导的原子之间的有效远距离偶极偶极相互作用。此协议与当前技术兼容。转移的信度受到原子激发态和腔模式被填充的概率的影响。为了确保相干交互，有效衰减率E和C需要满足E,Cr的关系。对于实际实施，在耦合的超导条线微波谐振器中捕获的原子或分子作为潜在候选物是很有前景的。
