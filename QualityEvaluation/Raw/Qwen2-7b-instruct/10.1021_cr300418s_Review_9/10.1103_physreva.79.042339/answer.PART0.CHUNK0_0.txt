Quantum-information transfer in a one-dimensional coupled resonator waveguide is possible through the use of effective long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by cavity modes between atoms. This allows for Raman transitions and stimulated Raman adiabatic passages (STIRAP) to occur, enabling quantum states to be transferred directly from the first node to the end one within the waveguide. The protocol exploits the nonlocal interactions combined with lasers to induce these transitions between atoms trapped in the two ends of the waveguide, facilitating quantum information transfer without involving intermediate nodes. The fidelity of the state transfer can be affected by the probabilities of populating atomic excited states or cavity modes. Experimental implementation of this protocol is feasible using atoms or polar molecules trapped in coupled superconducting stripline microwave resonators, potentially leading to efficient quantum communications in networks using coupled resonators.

在一维耦合谐振器波导中实现量子信息传输是可能的，通过腔模式介导的原子之间的有效长程偶极-偶极相互作用。这允许发生拉曼跃迁和受激拉曼绝热过程（STIRAP），从而使量子态能够直接从第一个节点传输到末端节点。该协议利用非局部相互作用以及激光来诱导波导两端捕获的原子之间的这些跃迁，从而在不涉及中间节点的情况下实现量子信息传输。该方案利用有效长程偶极-偶极相互作用和激光诱导拉曼跃迁，在波导两端捕获的原子之间进行量子信息传输，以实现从第一个节点到终端节点的直接传输。实验实施此协议的可能性存在于耦合超导传输线谐振器中捕获的原子或极性分子中，潜在地导致使用耦合谐振器网络中的量子通信。量子信息传输的保真度可能会受到填充原子激发态或腔模式的概率的影响。实现这一协议的实验可能性存在于耦合超导传输线谐振器中捕获的原子或极性分子中，这可能导致基于耦合谐振器网络的高效量子通信。
