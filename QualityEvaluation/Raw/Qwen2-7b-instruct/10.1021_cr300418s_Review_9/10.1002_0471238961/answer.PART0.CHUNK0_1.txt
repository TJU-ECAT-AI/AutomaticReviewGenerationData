<p>The polymerization activities of the dinuclear nickel(II) complexes 1 and 2 varied between 3.4·104 (8/MAO) and 9.8· 106 gpolymer/mol(Ni)·h (4/MAO).</p>
<p>The observed activity trends and differences are difficult to explain in the absence of a more profound knowledge of the active species.</p>
<p>The new dinuclear pre-catalysts 4 to 10 could be also activated with the co-catalytic system B(C6F5)3/AlEt3 and the activities are similar to those observed with MAO.</p>

1. The polymerization activities of the dinuclear nickel(II) complexes 1 and 2 showed a wide range, from 3.4·104 to 9.8·106 gpolymer/mol(Ni)·h. 
2. The reasons behind the observed activity trends and differences in the complexes' performance are not clear without deeper understanding of the active species involved.
3. The new dinuclear complexes 4 to 10, when activated with B(C6F5)3/AlEt3, exhibited similar polymerization activities to those observed with MAO.
