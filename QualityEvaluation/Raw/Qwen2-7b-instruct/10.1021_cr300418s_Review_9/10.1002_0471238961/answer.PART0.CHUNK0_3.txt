[1] "During our work, we became aware that only singular examples of homodinuclear NiII-, PdII-, CoII- and CrIII-complexes [15, 18,22, 24,69] were investigated. Thus, we present here the first polymerization results of a series of homodinuclear nickel(II) and palladium(II) complexes 1 to 10 with Schiff-base ligands derived from different (di)-aldehydes condensed with 2-amino-1-alcohols or with (thio)-semicarbazide and (thio)-carbonodihydrazide (Scheme 2) which can be activated with MAO, B(C6F5)3, or a combination of both B(C6F5)3/AlEt3."
[2] "As a reference point for the activity of the new pre-catalysts the Ni(salen)- complex 3 with a similar N2,O2-coordination was tested under the same polymerization conditions."
[3] "The catalytic systems 4  10/MAO showed remarkable differences in the polymerization activities depending on the metal. In the case of the palladium(II) complexes the polymerization activities covered a narrow range between 2.2 · 106 (10/MAO) and 1.5 · 107 gpolymer/mol(Pd)·h (7/MAO) with high monomer conversions in short polymerization times of 10 sec."
[4] "In contrast the polymerization activities of the nickel(II) complexes varied between 3.4·104 (8/MAO) and 9.8· 106 gpolymer/mol(Ni)·h (4/MAO)."
[5] "Activation of the new dinuclear complexes with B(C6F5)3 alone was only successful in the case of the complexes 4, 5, 7, and 10. There, the polymerization activities were rather low between 5.3 · 102 (10/B(C6F5)3) and 2.7 · 104 gpolymer/mol(metal)·h (7/B(C6F5)3)."
