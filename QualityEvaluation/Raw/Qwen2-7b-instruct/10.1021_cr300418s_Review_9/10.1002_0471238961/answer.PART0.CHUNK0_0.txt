[1] "During our work, we became aware that only singular examples of homodinuclear NiII-, PdII-, CoII- and CrIII-complexes [15, 18,22, 24,69] were investigated. Thus, we present here the first polymerization results of a series of homodinuclear nickel(II) and palladium(II) complexes 1 to 10 with Schiff-base ligands derived from different (di)-aldehydes condensed with 2-amino-1-alcohols or with (thio)-semicarbazide and (thio)-carbonodihydrazide (Scheme 2) which can be activated with MAO, B(C6F5)3, or a combination of both B(C6F5)3/AlEt3."
[2] "In comparison to the mononuclear reference system 3 and in general [19,34  36, 50,51] the catalysts based on the dinuclear nickel(II) complexes 1 and 2 show rather high polymerization activities in combination with different co-catalytic systems."
[3] "The activities covered a range between 1.1·106 (1/B(C6F5)3 and 2/B(C6F5)3) to 2.3 · 107 gpolymer/mol(Ni)·h (1/MAO)."
[4] "The new dinuclear pre-catalysts 4 to 10 could be also activated with the co-catalytic system B(C6F5)3/AlEt3 and the activities are similar to those observed with MAO."
[5] "Of course, a compromise has to be made in terms of the stability of the pre-catalytic complex for preparation, handling, and storage."

1. The research team discovered that only a few examples of homodinuclear nickel(II), palladium(II), cobalt(II), and chromium(III) complexes had been studied previously. They then presented the first polymerization results for a series of homodinuclear nickel(II) and palladium(II) complexes, which can be activated with methylalumoxane (MAO), tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3), or a combination of both B(C6F5)3 and triethylaluminum (AlEt3).

2. The catalysts based on the dinuclear nickel(II) complexes 1 and 2 demonstrated notably high polymerization activities compared to a mononuclear reference system. These activities ranged between 1.1·106 (when activated with B(C6F5)3) and 2.3·107 (when activated with MAO).

3. The polymerization activities of the complexes were evaluated under various co-catalyst conditions. For example, complex 1 showed an activity of 2.3·107 gpolymer/mol(Ni)·h when activated with MAO.

4. The dinuclear nickel(II) and palladium(II) complexes 4 to 10 could also be activated with the co-catalytic system B(C6F5)3/AlEt3, and their activities were similar to those observed with methylalumoxane (MAO).

5. The stability of the pre-catalytic complexes needed to be balanced with considerations for their preparation, handling, and storage, as a compromise was required to achieve optimal catalytic performance.

1. 研究团队发现，之前只有少数同核二价镍、钯、钴和铬复合物被研究过。他们随后展示了由不同醛与2-氨基-1-醇或硫脲、硫碳二羟基腙缩合形成的Schiff基配体组成的系列同核二价镍和钯复合物的聚合结果，这些复合物可以用甲基铝氧烷（MAO）、三(p-氟苯基)硼烷（B(C6F5)3）或两者组合激活。

2. 与单核参考系统相比，基于二价镍复合物1和2的催化剂在不同的协同催化剂体系下显示出相当高的聚合活性。这些活性范围从使用B(C6F5)3激活时的1.1·106到使用MAO激活时的2.3·107 gpolymer/mol(Ni)·h。

3. 对复合物的聚合活性进行了评估，在不同协同催化剂条件下进行。例如，复合物1在使用MAO激活时的活性为2.3·107 gpolymer/mol(Ni)·h。

4. 二价镍和钯复合物4到10也可以用B(C6F5)3/AlEt3协同催化剂体系激活，并且其活性与使用MAO观察到的相似。

5. 需要在稳定性、制备、处理和存储方面对预催化剂复合物进行权衡，以实现最佳催化性能。
