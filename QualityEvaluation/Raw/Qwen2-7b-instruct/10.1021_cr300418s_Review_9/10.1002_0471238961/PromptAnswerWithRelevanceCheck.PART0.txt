How do the preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions (such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene), and what are the key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems?

[1] "During our work, we became aware that only singular examples of homodinuclear NiII-, PdII-, CoII- and CrIII-complexes [15, 18,22, 24,69] were investigated. Thus, we present here the first polymerization results of a series of homodinuclear nickel(II) and palladium(II) complexes 1 to 10 with Schiff-base ligands derived from different (di)-aldehydes condensed with 2-amino-1-alcohols or with (thio)-semicarbazide and (thio)-carbonodihydrazide (Scheme 2) which can be activated with MAO, B(C6F5)3, or a combination of both B(C6F5)3/AlEt3."
[2] "In comparison to the mononuclear reference system 3 and in general [19,34  36, 50,51] the catalysts based on the dinuclear nickel(II) complexes 1 and 2 show rather high polymerization activities in combination with different co-catalytic systems."
[3] "The activities covered a range between 1.1·106 (1/B(C6F5)3 and 2/B(C6F5)3) to 2.3 · 107 gpolymer/mol(Ni)·h (1/MAO)."
[4] "The new dinuclear pre-catalysts 4 to 10 could be also activated with the co-catalytic system B(C6F5)3/AlEt3 and the activities are similar to those observed with MAO."
[5] "Of course, a compromise has to be made in terms of the stability of the pre-catalytic complex for preparation, handling, and storage."

1. The research team discovered that only a few examples of homodinuclear nickel(II), palladium(II), cobalt(II), and chromium(III) complexes had been studied previously. They then presented the first polymerization results for a series of homodinuclear nickel(II) and palladium(II) complexes, which can be activated with methylalumoxane (MAO), tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3), or a combination of both B(C6F5)3 and triethylaluminum (AlEt3).

2. The catalysts based on the dinuclear nickel(II) complexes 1 and 2 demonstrated notably high polymerization activities compared to a mononuclear reference system. These activities ranged between 1.1·106 (when activated with B(C6F5)3) and 2.3·107 (when activated with MAO).

3. The polymerization activities of the complexes were evaluated under various co-catalyst conditions. For example, complex 1 showed an activity of 2.3·107 gpolymer/mol(Ni)·h when activated with MAO.

4. The dinuclear nickel(II) and palladium(II) complexes 4 to 10 could also be activated with the co-catalytic system B(C6F5)3/AlEt3, and their activities were similar to those observed with methylalumoxane (MAO).

5. The stability of the pre-catalytic complexes needed to be balanced with considerations for their preparation, handling, and storage, as a compromise was required to achieve optimal catalytic performance.

1. 研究团队发现，之前只有少数同核二价镍、钯、钴和铬复合物被研究过。他们随后展示了由不同醛与2-氨基-1-醇或硫脲、硫碳二羟基腙缩合形成的Schiff基配体组成的系列同核二价镍和钯复合物的聚合结果，这些复合物可以用甲基铝氧烷（MAO）、三(p-氟苯基)硼烷（B(C6F5)3）或两者组合激活。

2. 与单核参考系统相比，基于二价镍复合物1和2的催化剂在不同的协同催化剂体系下显示出相当高的聚合活性。这些活性范围从使用B(C6F5)3激活时的1.1·106到使用MAO激活时的2.3·107 gpolymer/mol(Ni)·h。

3. 对复合物的聚合活性进行了评估，在不同协同催化剂条件下进行。例如，复合物1在使用MAO激活时的活性为2.3·107 gpolymer/mol(Ni)·h。

4. 二价镍和钯复合物4到10也可以用B(C6F5)3/AlEt3协同催化剂体系激活，并且其活性与使用MAO观察到的相似。

5. 需要在稳定性、制备、处理和存储方面对预催化剂复合物进行权衡，以实现最佳催化性能。
