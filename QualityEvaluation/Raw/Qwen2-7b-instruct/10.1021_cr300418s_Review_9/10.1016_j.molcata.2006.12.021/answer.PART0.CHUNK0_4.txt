<p>“By varying the composition of TiO2 and ZrO2, various TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation method using ammonium hydroxide as a hydrolyzing agent.”</p>
<p>“Similarly, TiO2 and ZrO2 isolated oxides were also prepared for the purpose of comparison.”</p>
<p>“K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high performance towards the selective conversion of ethylbenzene into styrene in the presence of CO2, wherein K2O improved the conversion of ethylbenzene and selectivity of styrene acting as a basic promoter, similarly CO2 enhanced both conversion and selectivity acting as an oxidant as well as a diluent.”</p>
<p>“The unified promotional effects of K2O and CO2 improved the conversion of ethylbenzene up to 6065% at 9599% selectivity levels of styrene.”</p>
<p>“3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst is promising for the selective dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence excess of CO2.”</p>
<p>“As evidenced from the TPD of NH3 weak to moderate acidic sites are essential for the selective production of styrene, whereas the strong acidic sites lead to the formation of by-products.”</p>
<p>“CO2 enhanced the conversion of ethylbenzene and styrene selectivity acting as oxidant and diluent.”</p>

The preparation methods involve co-precipitation using ammonium hydroxide, while dopant concentrations include 1, 2, 3, and 4 wt.% K2O. Vacancy formation influences the electronic structure and catalytic performance, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety involve understanding how these factors interact within the catalytic system. The unified promotional effects of K2O and CO2 enhance both the conversion of ethylbenzene and the selectivity of styrene significantly.
