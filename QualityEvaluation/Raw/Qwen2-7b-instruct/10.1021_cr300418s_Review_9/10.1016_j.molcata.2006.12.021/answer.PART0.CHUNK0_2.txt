[1] "By varying the composition of TiO2 and ZrO2, various TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation method using ammonium hydroxide as a hydrolyzing agent."
[2] "Similarly, TiO2 and ZrO2 isolated oxides were also prepared for the purpose of comparison."
[3] "K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high performance towards the selective conversion of ethylbenzene into styrene in the presence of CO2, wherein K2O improved the conversion of ethylbenzene and selectivity of styrene acting as a basic promoter, similarly CO2 enhanced both conversion and selectivity acting as an oxidant as well as a diluent."
[4] "The unified promotional effects of K2O and CO2 improved the conversion of ethylbenzene up to 6065% at 9599% selectivity levels of styrene."
[5] "The role of CO2 has thoroughly been investigated over alumina supported vanadium catalysts with a vide varieties of promoters."
[6] "Recently, in one of our recent reports the enhanced activity of ZrO2 in the presence of CO2 has been described."
[7] "These TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts can be further improved up to the stage of complete suppression of by-products by neutralizing the strong acidic sites by K2O addition."

The preparation methods involve creating various TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts through a co-precipitation process using ammonium hydroxide as a hydrolyzing agent. Different dopant concentrations, specifically 1, 2, 3, and 4 wt.% of K2O, were added to these catalysts. CO2 acts as an oxidant and diluent, enhancing both the conversion of ethylbenzene and the selectivity of styrene. The unified effects of K2O and CO2 lead to a significant improvement in the conversion of ethylbenzene, reaching up to 60-65% at selectivity levels of 95-99% for styrene. The catalysts show enhanced activity when combined with CO2, particularly in the presence of various promoters like vanadium, manganese, ceria, and zirconia. The addition of K2O helps in suppressing by-products by neutralizing the strong acidic sites within the catalyst, leading to a more efficient and selective conversion of ethylbenzene to styrene.

制备方法涉及通过共沉淀法使用氨水作为水解剂来创建各种TiO2-ZrO2混合氧化物催化剂。不同掺杂浓度，具体为1、2、3和4 wt.%的K2O，被添加到这些催化剂中。CO2作为氧化剂和稀释剂，能增强乙基苯的转化率以及苯乙烯的选择性。K2O和CO2的协同作用使得乙基苯的转化率达到60%-65%，苯乙烯的选择性达到95%-99%。当与各种促进剂（如钒、锰、铈、锆）结合时，催化剂在CO2的存在下表现出增强的活性。通过向催化剂中添加K2O来中和强酸性位点，可以抑制副产品的生成，从而实现更高效的乙基苯转化为苯乙烯。
