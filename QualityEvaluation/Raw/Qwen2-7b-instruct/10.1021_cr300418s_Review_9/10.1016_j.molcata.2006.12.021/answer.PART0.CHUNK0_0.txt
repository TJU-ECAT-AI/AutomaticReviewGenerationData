The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst surface produces active oxygen species, which oxidizes H2 into H2O through the reverse water gas shift reaction, releasing the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation. The presence of weak to moderate acidic sites is crucial for the selective production of styrene, while strong acidic sites lead to the formation of by-products. Adding 3 wt% K2O to TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts neutralizes strong acidic sites, preventing coke deposition and unwanted by-product formation. CO2 acts as both an oxidant and diluent, enhancing the conversion of ethylbenzene and styrene selectivity. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involves optimizing the electronic structure, managing acidic sites, and effectively utilizing CO2. Theoretical modeling faces challenges in accurately predicting these interactions and optimizing the complex catalytic processes.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成会影响它们在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能。具体而言，CO2在催化剂表面的分解产生活性氧物种，通过逆水煤气变换反应将H2氧化为H2O，从而释放热力学平衡限制。NH3的温度程序脱附结果表明，弱到中等酸性位点对于选择性生产苯乙烯至关重要，而强酸性位点会导致副产物的生成。向TiO2-ZrO2混合氧化物催化剂中添加3 wt% K2O可以中和导致焦炭沉积和不良副产物形成的强酸性位点。CO2作为氧化剂和稀释剂的作用，增强乙苯的转化率和苯乙烯的选择性。在这些催化系统中平衡效率、选择性和安全性涉及优化电子结构、管理酸性位点并有效地利用CO2。理论建模面临的挑战在于准确预测这些相互作用并优化复杂的催化过程。
