[1] "The high activity of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 is due to the dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst surface to produce active oxygen species."
[2] "This oxygen species oxidizes H2 that produced in the simple ethylbenzene dehydrogenation process intoH2Oby reverse water gas shift reaction and thereby releases the limitation of thermodynamic equilibrium."
[3] "The data are suggesting that the basic sites are not strong enough to convert ethylbenzene into toluene."
[4] "The high activity of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 is due to the dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst surface to produce active oxygen species. This oxygen species oxidizes H2 that produced in the simple ethylbenzene dehydrogenation process intoH2Oby reverse water gas shift reaction and thereby releases the limitation of thermodynamic equilibrium."
[5] "CO2 enhanced the conversion of ethyl- benzene and styrene selectivity acting as oxidant and diluent."
[6] "As evidenced from the TPD of NH3 weak to moderate acidic sites are essential for the selective production of styrene, whereas the strong acidic sites lead to the formation of by-products."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst surface produces active oxygen species, which oxidizes H2 into H2O through the reverse water gas shift reaction, releasing the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation. The presence of weak to moderate acidic sites is crucial for the selective production of styrene, while strong acidic sites lead to the formation of by-products. Adding 3 wt% K2O to TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts neutralizes strong acidic sites, preventing coke deposition and unwanted by-product formation. CO2 acts as both an oxidant and diluent, enhancing the conversion of ethylbenzene and styrene selectivity. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involves optimizing the electronic structure, managing acidic sites, and effectively utilizing CO2. Theoretical modeling faces challenges in accurately predicting these interactions and optimizing the complex catalytic processes.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by enhancing the conversion of ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The introduction of potassium oxide (K2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) acts synergistically to improve the catalytic performance. Specifically, K2O improves the conversion of ethylbenzene and selectivity of styrene as a basic promoter, while CO2 enhances both conversion and selectivity as an oxidant and diluent. The unified promotional effects of K2O and CO2 lead to an improvement in the conversion of ethylbenzene up to 60-65% at selectivity levels of styrene reaching 95-99%. The high activity of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 is due to the dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst surface to produce active oxygen species, which oxidizes hydrogen produced in the simple ethylbenzene dehydrogenation process into water through the reverse water gas shift reaction. The addition of 3 wt% K2O to the TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst neutralizes the strong acidic sites responsible for coke deposition and the formation of unwanted by-products. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the detailed electronic structure modifications, optimizing the dopant concentration and vacancy formation, and managing the risk of coke deposition and by-product formation.

The preparation methods involve creating various TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts through a co-precipitation process using ammonium hydroxide as a hydrolyzing agent. Different dopant concentrations, specifically 1, 2, 3, and 4 wt.% of K2O, were added to these catalysts. CO2 acts as an oxidant and diluent, enhancing both the conversion of ethylbenzene and the selectivity of styrene. The unified effects of K2O and CO2 lead to a significant improvement in the conversion of ethylbenzene, reaching up to 60-65% at selectivity levels of 95-99% for styrene. The catalysts show enhanced activity when combined with CO2, particularly in the presence of various promoters like vanadium, manganese, ceria, and zirconia. The addition of K2O helps in suppressing by-products by neutralizing the strong acidic sites within the catalyst, leading to a more efficient and selective conversion of ethylbenzene to styrene.
