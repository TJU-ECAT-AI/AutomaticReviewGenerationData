[1] "The catalytic performance of ZrO2 and TiO2 is inferior to all the TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts."
[2] "The enhancement in cat- alytic activity of TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts might be due to huge hike in weak to moderate acidic sites compared to either TiO2 or ZrO2 and other changes in the physico- chemical properties such as BET surface area and crystalline properties."
[3] "The unified promotional effects of K2O and CO2 improved the conversion of ethylbenzene up to 6065% at 9599% selectivity levels of styrene."
[4] "CO2 enhanced the conversion of ethyl- benzene and styrene selectivity acting as oxidant and diluent."
[5] "The high activity of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 is due to the dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst surface to produce active oxygen species."

1. The performance of pure ZrO2 and TiO2 catalysts is inferior to that of mixed oxide TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts, likely due to differences in their acidic sites and physicochemical properties.
2. The improvement in the catalytic activity of the mixed oxide catalysts is attributed to an increase in the number of weak to moderate acidic sites, alongside other changes in properties like BET surface area and crystallinity.
3. The combined effects of K2O and CO2 significantly enhance the conversion of ethylbenzene, reaching up to 60-65% at high selectivity levels of 95-99% for styrene.
4. CO2 acts as both an oxidant and diluent, enhancing both the conversion of ethylbenzene and the selectivity of styrene.
5. The high activity of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 is due to the dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst surface, generating active oxygen species that facilitate the conversion of ethylbenzene into styrene.

1. 纯ZrO2和TiO2催化剂的性能劣于混合氧化物TiO2-ZrO2催化剂，这可能归因于它们的酸性位点和物理化学性质的不同。
2. 混合氧化物催化剂活性提高的原因可能是弱到中等酸性位点数量的增加，以及其他变化如BET表面积和结晶性的变化。
3. K2O和CO2的联合促进作用显著提高了乙苯的转化率，最高可达60-65%，同时使苯乙烯的选择性达到95-99%。
4. CO2作为氧化剂和稀释剂，既提高了乙苯的转化率，又提高了苯乙烯的选择性。
5. 在CO2存在的条件下催化剂表现出高活性的原因是CO2在催化剂表面的离解产生了活性氧物种，这些物种促进了乙苯向苯乙烯的转换。
