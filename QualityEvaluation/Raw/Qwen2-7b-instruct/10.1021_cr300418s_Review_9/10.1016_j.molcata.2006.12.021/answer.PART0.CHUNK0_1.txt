The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by enhancing the conversion of ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The introduction of potassium oxide (K2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) acts synergistically to improve the catalytic performance. Specifically, K2O improves the conversion of ethylbenzene and selectivity of styrene as a basic promoter, while CO2 enhances both conversion and selectivity as an oxidant and diluent. The unified promotional effects of K2O and CO2 lead to an improvement in the conversion of ethylbenzene up to 60-65% at selectivity levels of styrene reaching 95-99%. The high activity of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 is due to the dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst surface to produce active oxygen species, which oxidizes hydrogen produced in the simple ethylbenzene dehydrogenation process into water through the reverse water gas shift reaction. The addition of 3 wt% K2O to the TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst neutralizes the strong acidic sites responsible for coke deposition and the formation of unwanted by-products. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the detailed electronic structure modifications, optimizing the dopant concentration and vacancy formation, and managing the risk of coke deposition and by-product formation.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成影响其在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能，从而提高乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯。钾氧化物（K2O）和二氧化碳（CO2）的协同作用提高了催化剂的催化性能。具体来说，K2O作为基本促进剂提高了乙苯的转化率和苯乙烯的选择性，而CO2作为氧化剂和稀释剂同时增强转化和选择性。K2O和CO2的统一促进效果使乙苯的转化率达到60-65%，苯乙烯的选择性达到95-99%。催化剂在CO2存在的高活性归因于CO2在催化剂表面的分解产生活性氧物种，该物种通过逆水煤气变换反应氧化简单乙苯脱氢过程中产生的氢气为水。向TiO2-ZrO2混合氧化物催化剂中添加3 wt%的K2O可以中和导致焦炭沉积和副产物形成的强酸性位点。理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战包括理解详细的电子结构修改，优化掺杂浓度和空位形成，并管理焦炭沉积和副产物形成的风险。
