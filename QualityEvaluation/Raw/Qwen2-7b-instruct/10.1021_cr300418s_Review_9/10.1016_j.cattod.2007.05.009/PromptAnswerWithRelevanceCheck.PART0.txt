Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO- Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO) [167,168,174,182,270,271],and mixed molybdates (Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O and Mo/V/ Te/Nb/O) [145,162,164,272,273]."
[2] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems,including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems [181,187,189,263269]."
[3] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by altering their reactivity towards substrates and the efficiency of electron transfer. For instance, dopants like Nb enhance the dispersion of the nickel phase and facilitate CH bond activation, thereby improving catalytic performance. Theoretical modeling faces challenges in accurately predicting the complex interactions within these systems, optimizing processes for efficiency, selectivity, and safety requires understanding the subtle effects of these variables on the catalyst's activity. The key challenges involve developing precise models that capture the dynamics of electron transfer and substrate interactions, and identifying optimal conditions for the operation of these catalytic systems.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Nickel oxide (NiO) and its compounds interact with the support material, such as alumina, by forming specific surface species that facilitate the activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. The introduction of dopants like niobium (Nb) reduces the interaction between nickel and the support, inhibits nickel incorporation into the lattice, and enhances the reactivity to ethane while maintaining high selectivity for ethylene. This suggests that the balance between dispersion of the nickel phase and electron transfer promotion by dopants is crucial for achieving high efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.

1. The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance by altering the reactivity of the metal centers involved in the activation of the hydrocarbon bonds. High dopant concentrations can modify the electronic properties of the catalyst, leading to changes in the reactivity and selectivity towards desired products. Vacancy formation can affect the stability and reactivity of the active sites, influencing the overall catalytic performance. The key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure and reactivity of the catalysts under various conditions, optimizing the balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety, and understanding the dynamic interactions between the catalyst and reactants.

2. Catalysts based on NiO oxide, particularly when promoted with Nb or Mg, have demonstrated exceptional performance in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, yielding ethylene at high rates. The promotion of Ni with Nb enhances the reactivity of the catalyst towards ethane, while maintaining high selectivity towards ethylene. Mg promotion also improves the catalytic activity, although the exact mechanisms behind these enhancements require further investigation.
