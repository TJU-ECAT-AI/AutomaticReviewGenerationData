[1] "In the case of ethane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%."
[2] "Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO- Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO)."
[3] "In NiO-based catalysts, Ni interacts strongly with the support when the latter is alumina,by forming surface nickel aluminate-like species in the submonolayer regime, while NiO crystallites form on top of the nickel/alumina interface for multilayer coverages."
[4] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, thus increasing the reactivity to ethane by more than 50% while maintaining the high ethylene selectivity."

1. Most catalysts reported in literature for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation yield ethylene at less than 20%.
2. Catalysts achieving exceptional performance include those based on NiO oxide, such as NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O, and NiO-MgO.
3. In nickel oxide-based catalysts, nickel strongly interacts with the support, particularly alumina, forming surface nickel aluminate-like species when the nickel coverage is submonolayer, and NiO crystallites appear on the nickel/alumina interface for multilayer coverages.
4. Introducing niobium notably enhances the reactivity of ethane in oxidative dehydrogenation while preserving high ethylene selectivity.

1. 文献中报告的大多数催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的乙烯产率低于20%。
2. 达到优异性能的催化剂包括基于NiO氧化物的，如NiO-Al2O3、Ni/Nb/O和NiO-MgO。
3. 在镍基催化剂中，镍与支撑材料（尤其是氧化铝）强烈相互作用，在亚单层覆盖度时形成表面镍氧化铝类似物种，而在多层覆盖度时镍氧化物结晶体出现在镍/氧化铝界面。
4. 在氧化脱氢过程中引入铌显著提高了乙烷的反应性，同时保持了高乙烯选择性。
