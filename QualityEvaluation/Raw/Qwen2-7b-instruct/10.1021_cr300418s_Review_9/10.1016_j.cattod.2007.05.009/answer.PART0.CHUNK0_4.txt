[1] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems."
[2] "In the case of ethane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%. Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO- Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO) [167,168,174,182,270,271], and mixed molybdates (Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O and Mo/V/ Te/Nb/O) [145,162,164,272,273]."

1. The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance by altering the reactivity of the metal centers involved in the activation of the hydrocarbon bonds. High dopant concentrations can modify the electronic properties of the catalyst, leading to changes in the reactivity and selectivity towards desired products. Vacancy formation can affect the stability and reactivity of the active sites, influencing the overall catalytic performance. The key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure and reactivity of the catalysts under various conditions, optimizing the balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety, and understanding the dynamic interactions between the catalyst and reactants.

2. Catalysts based on NiO oxide, particularly when promoted with Nb or Mg, have demonstrated exceptional performance in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, yielding ethylene at high rates. The promotion of Ni with Nb enhances the reactivity of the catalyst towards ethane, while maintaining high selectivity towards ethylene. Mg promotion also improves the catalytic activity, although the exact mechanisms behind these enhancements require further investigation.
