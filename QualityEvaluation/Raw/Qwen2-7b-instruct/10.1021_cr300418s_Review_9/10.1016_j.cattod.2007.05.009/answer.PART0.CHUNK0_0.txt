[1] "In the case of ethane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%. Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO- Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO) [167,168,174,182,270,271],and mixed molybdates (Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O and Mo/V/ Te/Nb/O) [145,162,164,272,273]."
[2] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems,including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems [181,187,189,263269]."
[3] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times."
[4] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors [27,37,46,47,5175]."
[5] "The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases the activity and increases the selectivity to propylene in propane ODH [59,88]."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by altering their reactivity towards substrates and the efficiency of electron transfer. For instance, dopants like Nb enhance the dispersion of the nickel phase and facilitate CH bond activation, thereby improving catalytic performance. Theoretical modeling faces challenges in accurately predicting the complex interactions within these systems, optimizing processes for efficiency, selectivity, and safety requires understanding the subtle effects of these variables on the catalyst's activity. The key challenges involve developing precise models that capture the dynamics of electron transfer and substrate interactions, and identifying optimal conditions for the operation of these catalytic systems.
