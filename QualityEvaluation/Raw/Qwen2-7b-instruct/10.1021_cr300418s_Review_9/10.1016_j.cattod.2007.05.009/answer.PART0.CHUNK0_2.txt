[1] "In the case of ethane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%."
[2] "Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO- Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO)."
[3] "In NiO-based catalysts, Ni interacts strongly with the support when the latter is alumina,by forming surface nickel aluminate-like species in the submonolayer regime, while NiO crystallites form on top of the nickel/alumina interface for multilayer coverages."
[4] "Promoters are intercalated between nickel and alumina, thus reducing the strong nickel-alumina interaction and inhibiting nickel incorporation into the alumina lattice."
[5] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, thus increasing the reactivity to ethane by more than 50% while maintaining the high ethylene selectivity."
[6] "It is possible that apart from improving the dispersion of the nickel phase, Nb facilitates the CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Nickel oxide (NiO) and its compounds interact with the support material, such as alumina, by forming specific surface species that facilitate the activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. The introduction of dopants like niobium (Nb) reduces the interaction between nickel and the support, inhibits nickel incorporation into the lattice, and enhances the reactivity to ethane while maintaining high selectivity for ethylene. This suggests that the balance between dispersion of the nickel phase and electron transfer promotion by dopants is crucial for achieving high efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.

在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物及其化合物（如NiO）和支撑材料（如氧化铝）之间的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成会影响它们的电子结构和催化性能。镍与支撑材料形成特定表面物种，有助于碳-氢键的激活。引入铌（Nb）等掺杂物可以降低镍与支撑材料之间的相互作用，抑制镍的晶格整合，并增强对乙烷的反应性，同时保持高乙烯选择性。这表明，分散镍相与促进电子转移的掺杂物之间的平衡对于实现高效、高选择性和安全的催化系统至关重要。
