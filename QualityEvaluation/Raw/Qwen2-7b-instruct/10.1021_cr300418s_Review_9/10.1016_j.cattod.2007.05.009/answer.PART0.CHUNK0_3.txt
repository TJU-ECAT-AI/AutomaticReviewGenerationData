[1] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems."
[2] "In the case of ethane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%."
[3] "Catalytic systems reported in the literature for the period 2000-2006 and giving alkane conversion higher than 10% have been included. Systems operating in millisecond-contact-time reactors have not been reported."
