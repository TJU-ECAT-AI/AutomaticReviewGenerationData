<p>The MnO2-ZrO2 binary oxides exhibited greatly elevated catalytic activity for the conversion of ethylbenzene (EB) than those of individual oxides in the presence of CO2.</p>
<p>CO2 had a profound role as a soft oxidant by improving both activity and stability in the EBD over MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts.</p>
<p>MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts were demonstrated to be highly active in the dehydrogenation of EB to SM in the presence of CO2.</p>
<p>The best results were obtained over 10% of MnO2 loaded on ZrO2 catalyst at 650 8C with a conversion of 73% and the selectivity to styrene was about 98%.</p>

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, enhancing both the activity and stability of these catalysts. The MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides show improved catalytic activity for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation compared to individual oxides, especially when CO2 is present. The optimal catalyst is a 10% MnO2-loaded ZrO2 catalyst operating at 650°C, achieving a conversion of 73% with a styrene selectivity of about 98%.

在MnO2-ZrO2混合氧化物催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成的影响下，它们在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能得到了提高。二氧化碳作为软氧化剂，通过提高活性和稳定性来增强这些催化剂的性能。与单一氧化物相比，MnO2-ZrO2混合氧化物在二氧化碳存在的条件下显示出更高的催化活性。最佳催化剂是650°C下负载10% MnO2的ZrO2催化剂，其乙苯转化率为73%，苯乙烯选择性约为98%。
