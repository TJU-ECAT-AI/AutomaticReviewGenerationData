[1] "The superior activity of MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide over its respective individual oxides might be due to generation of active sites during the stages of mixed oxide catalyst preparation as described above."
[2] "In accordance with our previous publication, ZrO2 contributes towards the activation of CO2 based on its crystallographic phases [18] and acid-base capacities [20]."
[3] "The combined effect of redox and acid-base properties might be responsible for the higher activity of MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides."
[4] "The initial low activity was observed with CO2 when the catalyst was not pretreated with CO2."
[5] "In the presence of CO2, certain amount of coke might be converting into CO [24]."
[6] "Therefore, 10% MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst showed the optimum activity and stability at the CO2 to EB ratio of 10.2 due to the adequate balance for the adsorption and activation of CO2 and EB."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts play crucial roles in influencing their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. These factors affect the generation of active sites, the activation of CO2, and the balance between adsorption and activation of reactants. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the detailed mechanisms involved, predicting the behavior of complex mixed oxide systems, and managing the trade-offs between different operational parameters to achieve optimal performance. The role of CO2 as a soft oxidant enhances both activity and stability in the dehydrogenation process, leading to improved selectivity and reduced coke deposition. The optimum CO2 to ethylbenzene ratio of 10.2 for the 10% MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst ensures the highest activity and stability by achieving an adequate balance for the adsorption and activation of CO2 and ethylbenzene.
