The MnO2-ZrO2 binary oxides exhibited greatly elevated catalytic activity for the conversion of ethylbenzene (EB) than those of individual oxides in the presence of CO2.
CO2 had a profound role as a soft oxidant by improving both activity and stability in the EBD over MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts.
The superior activity of MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide over its respective individual oxides might be due to generation of active sites during the stages of mixed oxide catalyst preparation.
The addition of MnO2, chosen not only for the enhancement in acid base properties of mixed oxide but also for its redox properties, anticipated the improved performance for the dehydrogenation of EB to SM in presence of CO2.
In the absence of CO2, poor catalytic activity and stabilities were observed.
Gradual enhancement of activities were demonstrated in the higher CO2 to EB ratios.
CO2 attributed to the enhancement in catalytic activity by the oxidative conversion as well as catalytic life by suppressing the coke deposition.

The MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts demonstrated high activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene. The best results were achieved with 10% MnO2 loaded on ZrO2 at 650°C, showing a conversion of 73% with 98% selectivity for styrene. CO2 played a significant role as a soft oxidant, enhancing both activity and stability. The presence of CO2 led to improved catalytic performance compared to its absence. Higher CO2 to ethylbenzene ratios resulted in enhanced activities. The catalysts showed better performance in the presence of CO2, likely due to the oxidative conversion and suppression of coke deposition, thus extending the catalytic life.

锰氧化锆混合氧化物催化剂在乙苯氧化脱氢为苯乙烯中表现出高活性。最佳结果是在650°C时，10%锰氧化物负载在锆氧化物上，显示出73%的转化率和98%的苯乙烯选择性。二氧化碳作为软氧化剂，通过提高活性和稳定性，在锰氧化锆复合氧化物催化剂上起着重要作用。与无二氧化碳相比，二氧化碳的存在导致催化性能提升。更高的二氧化碳与乙苯比导致了增强的活性。催化剂在二氧化碳存在下表现更好，可能由于氧化反应和焦炭沉积的抑制，从而延长了催化剂寿命。
