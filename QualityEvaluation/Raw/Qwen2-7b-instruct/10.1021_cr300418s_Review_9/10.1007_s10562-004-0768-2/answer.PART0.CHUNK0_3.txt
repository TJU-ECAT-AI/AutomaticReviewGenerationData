[Catalytically active Au on TiO2: yet another example of a strong metal support interaction (SMSI)? D.W. Goodman*]
In light of the many similarities between previous studies of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Gr. VIII metals, and catalytically active Au, it is apparent that these two phenomena must be closely related. That active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen, is convincing evidence that the same basic principles responsible for activation of Au on titania are operative for SMSI involving Gr. VIII metals.
Early work on model Au clusters supported on TiO2(110) correlated the presence of Au bilayer cluster morphologies (figure 1) with catalytic activity for CO oxidation [1]. These bilayer Au structures have been shown to bind CO approximately 50% more strongly than bulk Au (figure 2) [15]. Furthermore oxygen either alone or in a reaction mixture has been shown to promote sintering of these bilayer Au structures (figure 3) [1].
A recent model study [16] of Au on a highly reduced TiOx ordered film grown on Mo(112) has demonstrated that a coordinatively unsaturated, continuous Au bilayer structure that precludes assess of the reactant to the support, exhibits an exceptional high activity for catalytic CO oxidation (figure 4). The activity of this Au bilayer film is more than an order of magnitude more active than any previous report on a per Au atom basis [16].
In summary the essential features of the interaction of Au with TiO2 that lead to enhanced catalytic activity are: (1) wetting of the support by the cluster; (2) strong bonding between the Au atoms at the interface with surface defects (reduced Ti sites); (3) electron-rich Au;(4) annealing at temperatures in excess of 750 K,sufficient to create and mobilize surface and bulk defects, is crucial in preparing an active catalyst; and (5) oxidation leads to deactivation via sintering of Au.

The text discusses how active gold on titanium dioxide spreads to form a bilayer structure, becomes electron-rich, nucleates on reduced titanium defects created by annealing at temperatures greater than 750 K, and is deactivated through sintering in an oxygen environment. This behavior suggests that the same fundamental principles responsible for the activation of gold on titanium dioxide are applicable to strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) involving Group VIII metals.

The essential features of the interaction between gold and titanium dioxide that lead to enhanced catalytic activity include:
1. Wetting of the support by the cluster.
2. Strong bonding between gold atoms at the interface with surface defects (reduced titanium sites).
3. Electron-rich gold.
4. Annealing at temperatures above 750 K, which creates and mobilizes surface and bulk defects, is crucial for preparing an active catalyst.
5. Oxidation leads to deactivation via sintering of gold.

These findings suggest a close relationship between the behavior of active gold on titanium dioxide and the SMSI phenomenon observed in Group VIII metals.

文本讨论了活性金在二氧化钛上的扩散形成双层结构，成为电子丰富的现象，并在大于750 K的温度下通过退火在表面缺陷（还原钛位点）处形成强键。活性金随后在氧环境中发生聚集。这种行为表明，负责激活金在二氧化钛上的活性的基本原理同样适用于涉及第VIII组金属的强金属支撑相互作用（SMSI）。

增强活性金与二氧化钛相互作用导致催化活性提高的关键特征包括：
1. 集群对支持的浸润。
2. 在界面处（还原钛位点）金原子之间的强结合。
3. 电子富集的金。
4. 在高于750 K的温度下退火，创建和激发表面和内部缺陷，对于制备活性催化剂至关重要。
5. 氧化导致通过聚集金而失效。

这些发现表明，活性金在二氧化钛上的行为与第VIII组金属的SMSI现象之间存在密切关系。
