[1] "In light of the many similarities between previous studies of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Gr.VIII metals, and catalytically active Au, it is apparent that these two phenomena must be closely related."
[2] "Active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen."
[3] "Reduction in hydrogen at 773 K is the typical condition required to induce SMSI. This temperature has been shown to be sufficient to create surface defects in model studies of single crystal TiO2."
[4] "With SMSI electron transfer occurs from titania to the supported metal yielding an electron-rich metal."
[5] "When induced, SMSI leads to suppression of H2 and CO chemisorption for various metals."
[6] "Oxidative environments reoxidize the reduced TiOx support and reverse the SMSI effect."
[7] "There is one outstanding discrepancy in the comparison of SMSI and catalytically active Au. This discrepancy is the assertion that SMSI arises from migration of a reduced TiOx, perhaps TiO, onto the supported metal causing inhibition of chemisorption and modified catalytic properties."
[8] "For Au on titania an oxidizing environment re-oxidizes the TiOx support causing de-wetting and sintering of the Au."

In comparing the strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Group VIII metals with catalytically active Au on titania, several key points emerge. Firstly, active Au on titania forms a bilayer structure, which is electron-rich, nucleates on reduced Ti defects after annealing to temperatures above 750 K, and becomes deactivated through sintering in an oxygen atmosphere. This indicates that the principles governing the activation of Au on titania are also applicable to SMSI involving Group VIII metals. Reduction conditions at 773 K typically trigger SMSI, which involves electron transfer from the titania support to the metal, resulting in an electron-rich metal. SMSI often suppresses hydrogen and carbon monoxide chemisorption. Oxidative environments can reverse the SMSI effect by re-oxidizing the reduced TiOx support, causing the Au to dewet and sinter. However, a notable discrepancy exists regarding the mechanism of SMSI, suggesting that the assertion of metal migration from the reduced TiOx to the supported metal might not fully explain the SMSI phenomenon. Instead, the focus seems to shift towards the critical role of defect sites at the cluster-support interface in enhancing the interaction between the metal and the reduced support at elevated temperatures.

在比较涉及第VIII族金属的强金属支持相互作用（SMSI）与在氧化钛上的活性Au时，出现了一些关键点。首先，活性Au在氧化钛上形成双层结构，该结构电子丰富，在750 K以上的温度下通过退火在还原Ti缺陷上形成，并在氧气气氛中通过烧结失活。这表明指导Au在氧化钛激活的原则也适用于涉及第VIII族金属的SMSI。在773 K的还原条件下通常触发SMSI，这涉及从氧化钛支撑到金属的电子转移，导致金属电子丰富。SMSI经常抑制氢和一氧化碳的化学吸附。氧化环境可以通过重新氧化还原的TiOx支撑来反转SMSI效果，导致Au脱湿和烧结。然而，存在一个明显的差异，关于SMSI的机制，表明关于金属迁移从还原TiOx到支持金属的说法可能不完全解释SMSI现象。相反，似乎更关注在高温下在簇-支撑界面处增强金属和还原支持之间交互的关键作用的缺陷位点。
