"Catalytically active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen."
"In light of the many similarities between previous studies of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Gr.VIII metals, and catalytically active Au, it is apparent that these two phenomena must be closely related."
"There is one outstanding discrepancy in the comparison of SMSI and catalytically active Au. This discrepancy is the assertion that SMSI arises from migration of a reduced TiOx, perhaps TiO, onto the supported metal causing inhibition of chemisorption and modified catalytic properties."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the electronic structure is affected by the creation of defects, which can alter the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst. Challenges in theoretical modeling involve accurately predicting the complex interactions within the catalyst system, optimizing processes to achieve high efficiency and selectivity, and ensuring the safety of the catalytic system under operational conditions. Key challenges include understanding the precise mechanisms of defect formation, the role of dopants in enhancing catalytic activity, and the dynamic behavior of the catalyst during the reaction process.
