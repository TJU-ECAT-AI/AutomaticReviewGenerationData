[1] "Early work on model Au clusters supported on TiO2(110) correlated the presence of Au bilayer cluster morphologies (figure 1) with catalytic activity for CO oxidation [1]."
[2] "These bilayer Au structures have been shown to bind CO approximately 50% more strongly than bulk Au (figure 2) [15]."
[3] "Furthermore oxygen either alone or in a reaction mixture has been shown to promote sintering of these bilayer Au structures (figure 3) [1]."
[4] "A recent model study [16] of Au on a highly reduced TiOx ordered film grown on Mo(112) has demonstrated that a coordinatively unsaturated, continuous Au bilayer structure that precludes assess of the reactant to the support, exhibits an exceptional high activity for catalytic CO oxidation (figure 4)."
[5] "The activity of this Au bilayer film is more than an order of magnitude more active than any previous report on a per Au atom basis [16]."
[6] "A key feature of Au grown on TiOx/Mo(112) is the strength of the interaction between the overlayer Au and the support comprised of strong bonding between Au and reduced Ti atoms of the TiOx support, yielding electron-rich Au [16]."
[7] "These recent studies are entirely consistent with recent theoretical studies [17] that show the importance of reduced Ti defect sites at the boundary between Au clusters and a TiO2 interface in determining the Au cluster shape and electronic properties via transfer of charge from the support to Au [18]."
[8] "Finally a recent theoretical study [19] has shown that a Au-only reaction pathway for a TiOx supported Au bilayer cluster is energetically competitive with alternative pathways requiring reactant-support interactions."
[9] "In summary the essential features of the interaction of Au with TiO2 that lead to enhanced catalytic activity are: (1) wetting of the support by the cluster; (2) strong bonding between the Au atoms at the interface with surface defects (reduced Ti sites); (3) electron-rich Au;(4) annealing at temperatures in excess of 750 K,sufficient to create and mobilize surface and bulk defects, is crucial in preparing an active catalyst; and (5) oxidation leads to deactivation via sintering of Au."
[10] "Reduction in hydrogen at 773 K is the typical condition required to induce SMSI. This temperature has been shown to be sufficient to create surface defects in model studies of single crystal TiO2 [36] and to be critical in the nucleation and growth morphology of Au clusters [37]."
[11] "Inducement of SMSI leads to wetting of the support by the metal [34]."
[12] "With SMSI electron transfer occurs from titania to the supported metal yielding an electron-rich metal."
[13] "When induced, SMSI leads to suppression of H2 and CO chemisorption for various metals [22,23]."
[14] "For an active Au/TiO2 model catalyst, core level shifts measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are consistent with electron transfer from titania to Au leading to electron-rich Au [3]."
[15] "Density functional calculations also are consistent with Au being electron-rich when supported on titania [18,39]."
[16] "Oxidative environments reoxidize the reduced TiOx support and reverse the SMSI effect [30]."
[17] "There is one outstanding discrepancy in the comparison of SMSI and catalytically active Au. This discrepancy is the assertion that SMSI arises from migration of a reduced TiOx, perhaps TiO, onto the supported metal causing inhibition of chemisorption and modified catalytic properties [31,42]."
[18] "This discrepancy could be due to the logical, yet possibly incorrect, interpretation of the original data used to deduce migration of TiOx onto the metal during SMSI."
[19] "Assuming this accumulation of defects at the cluster-support interface occurs as well during SMSI formation, this could easily be interpreted as TiOx formation on the cluster because the metal bilayer structure that we now know forms on TiO2 is relatively transparent to electron probes such as XPS."
[20] "Likewise, an increase in the Ti feature in low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS) as a function of anneal temperature, interpreted as migration of TiOx onto the metal, could be simply due to the improved accessibility of the probe ions to Ti because of the decrease in the oxygen stoichiometry during reduction."
[21] "Finally, there is the possibility that decoration occurs for Gr. VIII metals but does not for Au. Nonetheless, the essential feature for the activation of both systems is the strong interaction between the metal and defects formed at the surface of the reduced support at elevated temperatures, and the de-wetting and sintering of the Au in an oxidizing environment."

The literature provides insights into the preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influencing their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It highlights the importance of Au bilayer structures for CO oxidation, which bind CO more strongly than bulk Au. Oxygen promotes sintering of these bilayer structures. Recent studies demonstrate that Au on a highly reduced TiOx film grown on Mo(112) exhibits exceptional high activity for catalytic CO oxidation, with the Au bilayer film being more active than previous reports on a per Au atom basis. The interaction between Au and TiOx support, characterized by strong bonding between Au and reduced Ti atoms, yields electron-rich Au, enhancing catalytic activity. Annealing at temperatures above 750 K creates surface and bulk defects crucial for catalyst preparation, while oxidation reverses the SMSI effect by re-oxidizing the reduced TiOx support and causing de-wetting and sintering of Au. However, the discrepancy between SMSI and catalytically active Au regarding the migration of TiOx onto the metal during SMSI formation suggests a possible misinterpretation of the original data. The essential feature for both systems' activation is the strong interaction between the metal and defects at the reduced support surface at elevated temperatures, followed by de-wetting and sintering of Au in an oxidizing environment.

文献提供了关于镍氧化物基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能的影响因素。它强调了Au双层结构对于CO氧化的重要性，这些结构比块状Au更强烈地结合CO。氧气促进了这些双层Au结构的烧结。最近的研究表明，在Mo(112)上生长的高还原度TiOx薄膜上的Au表现出催化CO氧化的极高活性，Au双层薄膜的活性高于以前报告的每Au原子基础。Au与TiOx支持之间的相互作用，表现为Au和还原Ti原子之间的强键合，产生电子丰富的Au，从而增强催化活性。在750 K以上的温度下进行退火可以创建表面和内部缺陷，这对于催化剂的制备至关重要，而氧化则通过重新氧化还原的TiOx支持并导致Au的去湿和烧结来逆转SMSI效应。然而，SMSI和催化活性Au之间关于金属期间SMSI形成过程中的TiOx迁移的差异表明可能存在对原始数据的误解。两种系统激活的关键特征是金属与还原支持表面在高温下的强相互作用，随后在氧化环境中导致Au的去湿和烧结。
