"Catalytically active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen."
"In light of the many similarities between previous studies of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Gr.VIII metals, and catalytically active Au, it is apparent that these two phenomena must be closely related."
"There is one outstanding discrepancy in the comparison of SMSI and catalytically active Au. This discrepancy is the assertion that SMSI arises from migration of a reduced TiOx, perhaps TiO, onto the supported metal causing inhibition of chemisorption and modified catalytic properties."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the electronic structure is affected by the creation of defects, which can alter the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst. Challenges in theoretical modeling involve accurately predicting the complex interactions within the catalyst system, optimizing processes to achieve high efficiency and selectivity, and ensuring the safety of the catalytic system under operational conditions. Key challenges include understanding the precise mechanisms of defect formation, the role of dopants in enhancing catalytic activity, and the dynamic behavior of the catalyst during the reaction process.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In comparing the strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Group VIII metals with catalytically active Au on titania, several key points emerge. Firstly, active Au on titania forms a bilayer structure, which is electron-rich, nucleates on reduced Ti defects after annealing to temperatures above 750 K, and becomes deactivated through sintering in an oxygen atmosphere. This indicates that the principles governing the activation of Au on titania are also applicable to SMSI involving Group VIII metals. Reduction conditions at 773 K typically trigger SMSI, which involves electron transfer from the titania support to the metal, resulting in an electron-rich metal. SMSI often suppresses hydrogen and carbon monoxide chemisorption. Oxidative environments can reverse the SMSI effect by re-oxidizing the reduced TiOx support, causing the Au to dewet and sinter. However, a notable discrepancy exists regarding the mechanism of SMSI, suggesting that the assertion of metal migration from the reduced TiOx to the supported metal might not fully explain the SMSI phenomenon. Instead, the focus seems to shift towards the critical role of defect sites at the cluster-support interface in enhancing the interaction between the metal and the reduced support at elevated temperatures.

在比较涉及第VIII族金属的强金属支持相互作用（SMSI）与在氧化钛上的活性Au时，出现了一些关键点。首先，活性Au在氧化钛上形成双层结构，该结构电子丰富，在750 K以上的温度下通过退火在还原Ti缺陷上形成，并在氧气气氛中通过烧结失活。这表明指导Au在氧化钛激活的原则也适用于涉及第VIII族金属的SMSI。在773 K的还原条件下通常触发SMSI，这涉及从氧化钛支撑到金属的电子转移，导致金属电子丰富。SMSI经常抑制氢和一氧化碳的化学吸附。氧化环境可以通过重新氧化还原的TiOx支撑来反转SMSI效果，导致Au脱湿和烧结。然而，存在一个明显的差异，关于SMSI的机制，表明关于金属迁移从还原TiOx到支持金属的说法可能不完全解释SMSI现象。相反，似乎更关注在高温下在簇-支撑界面处增强金属和还原支持之间交互的关键作用的缺陷位点。

[1] "Early work on model Au clusters supported on TiO2(110) correlated the presence of Au bilayer cluster morphologies (figure 1) with catalytic activity for CO oxidation [1]."

[3] "Furthermore oxygen either alone or in a reaction mixture has been shown to promote sintering of these bilayer Au structures (figure 3) [1]."
[4] "A recent model study [16] of Au on a highly reduced TiOx ordered film grown on Mo(112) has demonstrated that a coordinatively unsaturated, continuous Au bilayer structure that precludes assess of the reactant to the support, exhibits an exceptional high activity for catalytic CO oxidation (figure 4)."
[5] "The activity of this Au bilayer film is more than an order of magnitude more active than any previous report on a per Au atom basis [16]."
[6] "A key feature of Au grown on TiOx/Mo(112) is the strength of the interaction between the overlayer Au and the support comprised of strong bonding between Au and reduced Ti atoms of the TiOx support, yielding electron-rich Au [16]."
[7] "These recent studies are entirely consistent with recent theoretical studies [17] that show the importance of reduced Ti defect sites at the boundary between Au clusters and a TiO2 interface in determining the Au cluster shape and electronic properties via transfer of charge from the support to Au [18]."
[8] "Finally a recent theoretical study [19] has shown that a Au-only reaction pathway for a TiOx supported Au bilayer cluster is energetically competitive with alternative pathways requiring reactant-support interactions."
[9] "In summary the essential features of the interaction of Au with TiO2 that lead to enhanced catalytic activity are: (1) wetting of the support by the cluster; (2) strong bonding between the Au atoms at the interface with surface defects (reduced Ti sites); (3) electron-rich Au;(4) annealing at temperatures in excess of 750 K,sufficient to create and mobilize surface and bulk defects, is crucial in preparing an active catalyst; and (5) oxidation leads to deactivation via sintering of Au."
[10] "Reduction in hydrogen at 773 K is the typical condition required to induce SMSI. This temperature has been shown to be sufficient to create surface defects in model studies of single crystal TiO2 [36] and to be critical in the nucleation and growth morphology of Au clusters [37]."

This discrepancy is the assertion that SMSI arises from migration of a reduced TiOx, perhaps TiO, onto the supported metal causing inhibition of chemisorption and modified catalytic properties [31,42]."
[18] "This discrepancy could be due to the logical, yet possibly incorrect, interpretation of the original data used to deduce migration of TiOx onto the metal during SMSI."
[19] "Assuming this accumulation of defects at the cluster-support interface occurs as well during SMSI formation, this could easily be interpreted as TiOx formation on the cluster because the metal bilayer structure that we now know forms on TiO2 is relatively transparent to electron probes such as XPS."
[20] "Likewise, an increase in the Ti feature in low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS) as a function of anneal temperature, interpreted as migration of TiOx onto the metal, could be simply due to the improved accessibility of the probe ions to Ti because of the decrease in the oxygen stoichiometry during reduction."
[21] "Finally, there is the possibility that decoration occurs for Gr. VIII metals but does not for Au. Nonetheless, the essential feature for the activation of both systems is the strong interaction between the metal and defects formed at the surface of the reduced support at elevated temperatures, and the de-wetting and sintering of the Au in an oxidizing environment."

The literature provides insights into the preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influencing their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It highlights the importance of Au bilayer structures for CO oxidation, which bind CO more strongly than bulk Au. Oxygen promotes sintering of these bilayer structures. Recent studies demonstrate that Au on a highly reduced TiOx film grown on Mo(112) exhibits exceptional high activity for catalytic CO oxidation, with the Au bilayer film being more active than previous reports on a per Au atom basis. The interaction between Au and TiOx support, characterized by strong bonding between Au and reduced Ti atoms, yields electron-rich Au, enhancing catalytic activity. Annealing at temperatures above 750 K creates surface and bulk defects crucial for catalyst preparation, while oxidation reverses the SMSI effect by re-oxidizing the reduced TiOx support and causing de-wetting and sintering of Au. However, the discrepancy between SMSI and catalytically active Au regarding the migration of TiOx onto the metal during SMSI formation suggests a possible misinterpretation of the original data. The essential feature for both systems' activation is the strong interaction between the metal and defects at the reduced support surface at elevated temperatures, followed by de-wetting and sintering of Au in an oxidizing environment.

文献提供了关于镍氧化物基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能的影响因素。它强调了Au双层结构对于CO氧化的重要性，这些结构比块状Au更强烈地结合CO。氧气促进了这些双层Au结构的烧结。最近的研究表明，在Mo(112)上生长的高还原度TiOx薄膜上的Au表现出催化CO氧化的极高活性，Au双层薄膜的活性高于以前报告的每Au原子基础。Au与TiOx支持之间的相互作用，表现为Au和还原Ti原子之间的强键合，产生电子丰富的Au，从而增强催化活性。在750 K以上的温度下进行退火可以创建表面和内部缺陷，这对于催化剂的制备至关重要，而氧化则通过重新氧化还原的TiOx支持并导致Au的去湿和烧结来逆转SMSI效应。然而，SMSI和催化活性Au之间关于金属期间SMSI形成过程中的TiOx迁移的差异表明可能存在对原始数据的误解。两种系统激活的关键特征是金属与还原支持表面在高温下的强相互作用，随后在氧化环境中导致Au的去湿和烧结。

[Catalytically active Au on TiO2: yet another example of a strong metal support interaction (SMSI)? D.W. Goodman*]
In light of the many similarities between previous studies of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Gr. VIII metals, and catalytically active Au, it is apparent that these two phenomena must be closely related. That active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen, is convincing evidence that the same basic principles responsible for activation of Au on titania are operative for SMSI involving Gr. VIII metals.
Early work on model Au clusters supported on TiO2(110) correlated the presence of Au bilayer cluster morphologies (figure 1) with catalytic activity for CO oxidation [1]. These bilayer Au structures have been shown to bind CO approximately 50% more strongly than bulk Au (figure 2) [15]. Furthermore oxygen either alone or in a reaction mixture has been shown to promote sintering of these bilayer Au structures (figure 3) [1].
A recent model study [16] of Au on a highly reduced TiOx ordered film grown on Mo(112) has demonstrated that a coordinatively unsaturated, continuous Au bilayer structure that precludes assess of the reactant to the support, exhibits an exceptional high activity for catalytic CO oxidation (figure 4). The activity of this Au bilayer film is more than an order of magnitude more active than any previous report on a per Au atom basis [16].
In summary the essential features of the interaction of Au with TiO2 that lead to enhanced catalytic activity are: (1) wetting of the support by the cluster; (2) strong bonding between the Au atoms at the interface with surface defects (reduced Ti sites); (3) electron-rich Au;(4) annealing at temperatures in excess of 750 K,sufficient to create and mobilize surface and bulk defects, is crucial in preparing an active catalyst; and (5) oxidation leads to deactivation via sintering of Au.

The text discusses how active gold on titanium dioxide spreads to form a bilayer structure, becomes electron-rich, nucleates on reduced titanium defects created by annealing at temperatures greater than 750 K, and is deactivated through sintering in an oxygen environment. This behavior suggests that the same fundamental principles responsible for the activation of gold on titanium dioxide are applicable to strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) involving Group VIII metals.

The essential features of the interaction between gold and titanium dioxide that lead to enhanced catalytic activity include:
1. Wetting of the support by the cluster.
2. Strong bonding between gold atoms at the interface with surface defects (reduced titanium sites).
3. Electron-rich gold.
4. Annealing at temperatures above 750 K, which creates and mobilizes surface and bulk defects, is crucial for preparing an active catalyst.
5. Oxidation leads to deactivation via sintering of gold.

These findings suggest a close relationship between the behavior of active gold on titanium dioxide and the SMSI phenomenon observed in Group VIII metals.
