1. The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) involving Gr. VIII metals and catalytically active Au share similarities, indicating they are closely related phenomena. Active Au on titania forms a bilayer structure, becomes electron-rich, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures above 750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen, which provides convincing evidence for the activation principles of Au on titania being applicable to SMSI involving Gr. VIII metals.

2. Model studies on Au clusters supported on TiO2(110) correlate the presence of Au bilayer cluster morphologies with increased catalytic activity for CO oxidation.

3. Oxygen promotes the sintering of bilayer Au structures.

4. The strength of the interaction between Au and the reduced Ti atoms of the TiOx support yields electron-rich Au on the Au/Mo(112)/TiOx system, enhancing its catalytic activity.

5. The Au bilayer film on this system is significantly more active than previous reports on a per Au atom basis.

6. In the late 1970s and 1980s, considerable attention was directed towards the unusual properties of metals supported on TiO2 when reduced at high temperatures, initially reported by Tauster et al. for supported Pt and Ir, and designated as SMSI.

7. Tauster et al. demonstrated that hydrogen and carbon monoxide chemisorption on highly dispersed titania-supported catalysts was suppressed under SMSI conditions.

8. Induction of SMSI leads to the metal wetting the support.

9. SMSI involves electron transfer from titania to the supported metal, resulting in an electron-rich metal.

10. SMSI leads to the suppression of hydrogen and carbon monoxide chemisorption for various metals.

11. An oxidizing environment re-oxidizes the reduced TiOx support, causing the de-wetting and sintering of Au on titania.

1. SMSI涉及Gr. VIII金属和催化活性Au的现象密切相关，表明它们紧密相关。活性Au在氧化钛上形成双层结构，成为电子富集，通过在750 K以上的温度下退火在Ti缺陷上核化，并在氧气中通过烧结而失活，这为Au在氧化钛上的激活原则适用于Gr. VIII金属的SMSI提供了确凿证据。

2. 模型研究在TiO2(110)上支持的Au簇中关联了Au双层簇形态的存在与CO氧化催化活性的增加。

3. 氧气促进了这些双层Au结构的烧结。

4. Au与TiOx支持中的还原Ti原子之间的强结合产生电子富集的Au，在Au/Mo(112)/TiOx系统中增强了其催化活性。

5. 这个Au薄膜在该系统中的活性比之前关于每Au原子的报告高出一个数量级。

6. 在1970年代后期和1980年代，对TiO2上高温度还原时金属的异常性质给予了大量关注，最初由Tauster等人报道了支持Pt和Ir的SMSI现象。

7. Tauster等人证明，高分散的氧化钛支持催化剂上的氢和一氧化碳化学吸附被抑制。

8. SMSI导致金属润湿支撑物。

9. SMSI涉及从氧化钛到支持金属的电子转移，导致电子富集的金属。

10. SMSI导致各种金属的氢和一氧化碳化学吸附被抑制。

11. 一个氧化环境重新氧化了还原的TiOx支持，导致Au在氧化钛上的脱湿和烧结。
