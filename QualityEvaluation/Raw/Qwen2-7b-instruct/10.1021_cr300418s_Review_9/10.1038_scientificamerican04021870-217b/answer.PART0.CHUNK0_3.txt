The preparation of chlorate of baryta, as proposed by Moritz Bran dau, involves mixing 49 parts by weight of sulfuric acid, 333 parts of sulfate of alumina, and 122t parts chlorate of potash to create a paste in water. This mixture is gently warmed until completely cool, then mixed with approximately an equal volume of alcohol and filtered. The resulting alcoholic filtrate is neutralized with caustic baryta, leading to chlorate of baryta in solution with a precipitate of sulfate of baryta. This method allows for the production of chloric acid at a lower cost, potentially facilitating its broader application due to its interesting properties and uses that are not fully understood.

莫里斯·布兰道提出了制备氯酸钡的方法：将49份重量的硫酸、333份硫酸铝盐和122t份钾氯酸盐混合成水中的糊状物，然后用温水轻轻加热。当完全冷却后，与大约等体积的酒精混合并过滤。通过用氢氧化钡中和得到的酒精滤液，产生溶液中的氯酸钡以及硫酸钡沉淀。这种方法允许以较低的成本生产氯酸，可能由于其有趣的特点和用途尚未完全理解，从而促进其更广泛的使用。
