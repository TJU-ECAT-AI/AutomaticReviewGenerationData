The preparation methods for silver include distillation similar to zinc, which requires high heat and a special furnace. Moritz Bran dau proposed a simple method for producing chloric acid, which involves mixing certain weights of substances and then cooling the mixture to separate chloric acid from precipitates. Silver can be distilled in various regions around the world, with the amount varying significantly based on geographical location. For instance, North America can produce up to $20,000,000 worth of silver in the form of a pure, soft metal with a specific gravity of 10.575. Other regions such as Mexico and South America, British America, Australia and New Zealand, Siberia, and others also have potential for silver production.

银的制备方法与锌类似，需要高温和特殊炉子。Moritz Bran dau 提出了一种简单的方法来生产氯酸，该方法涉及混合特定重量的物质，然后将冷却混合物以分离氯酸和沉淀物。银可以在世界各地的不同地区进行提炼，产量因地理位置而异。例如，北美可以提炼高达2亿美元的银，形成纯度为10.575的软金属。其他地区如墨西哥和南美、北美、澳大利亚和新西兰、西伯利亚等也有银生产的潜力。
