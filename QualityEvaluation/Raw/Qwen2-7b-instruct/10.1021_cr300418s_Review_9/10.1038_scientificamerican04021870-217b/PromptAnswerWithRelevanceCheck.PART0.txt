The preparation methods for silver involve distillation under high heat and specialized furnaces. Moritz Bran dau proposed a straightforward process for preparing chloric acid using sulfuric acid, sulfate of alumina, and potassium chlorate. The chlorate is then decanted, evaporated to remove excess alcohol, and used in various applications. Lime can be used as a crucible material when applying the heat of the oxyhydrogen flame to distill silver. Silver can be produced in a pure, soft metallic form with a specific gravity of 10.575.

The preparation methods for silver include distillation similar to zinc, which requires high heat and a special furnace. Moritz Bran dau proposed a simple method for producing chloric acid, which involves mixing certain weights of substances and then cooling the mixture to separate chloric acid from precipitates. Silver can be distilled in various regions around the world, with the amount varying significantly based on geographical location. For instance, North America can produce up to $20,000,000 worth of silver in the form of a pure, soft metal with a specific gravity of 10.575. Other regions such as Mexico and South America, British America, Australia and New Zealand, Siberia, and others also have potential for silver production.

The preparation of chlorate of baryta, as proposed by Moritz Bran dau, involves mixing 49 parts by weight of sulfuric acid, 333 parts of sulfate of alumina, and 122t parts chlorate of potash to create a paste in water. This mixture is gently warmed until completely cool, then mixed with approximately an equal volume of alcohol and filtered. The resulting alcoholic filtrate is neutralized with caustic baryta, leading to chlorate of baryta in solution with a precipitate of sulfate of baryta. This method allows for the production of chloric acid at a lower cost, potentially facilitating its broader application due to its interesting properties and uses that are not fully understood.
