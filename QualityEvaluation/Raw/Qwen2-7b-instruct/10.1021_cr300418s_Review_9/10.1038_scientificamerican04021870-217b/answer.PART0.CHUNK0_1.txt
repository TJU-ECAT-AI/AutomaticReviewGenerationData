The preparation methods for silver involve distillation under high heat and specialized furnaces. Moritz Bran dau proposed a straightforward process for preparing chloric acid using sulfuric acid, sulfate of alumina, and potassium chlorate. The chlorate is then decanted, evaporated to remove excess alcohol, and used in various applications. Lime can be used as a crucible material when applying the heat of the oxyhydrogen flame to distill silver. Silver can be produced in a pure, soft metallic form with a specific gravity of 10.575.

银的制备方法包括在高温和专用炉中进行蒸馏。Moritz Bran dau 提出了一种简单的方法来准备氯酸，使用硫酸、硫酸铝盐和钾氯酸混合物。氯酸从沉淀物中分出，蒸发掉多余的酒精，然后用于各种应用。石灰可以作为应用氧氢火焰热时的坩埚材料，用于蒸馏银。银可以以纯软金属的形式生产，其密度为10.575。
