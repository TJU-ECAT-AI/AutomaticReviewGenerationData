[2] "Moritz Bran dau propoaes the following simple method of procedure:"
[3] "The product is a solution of chloric acid with alum, and excess of SUlphuric acid and 8ulphate of alumina."
[4] "When it is entirely cool it is mixed with about an equal volume of alcohol and then filtered."
[5] "The alcoholic filtrate is then neutralized with caustic baryta which gives us chlorate of baryta in solution, while SUlphate of bar yta is precipitated."
[6] "It could be employed in the preparation of oxygen gas, but for this purpose would be more expensive than chlorate of potash."
[7] "The uses of chl.oric acid are not well understood, and a cheap method like the above for its production may lead to a more general application of this highly interesting compound."
