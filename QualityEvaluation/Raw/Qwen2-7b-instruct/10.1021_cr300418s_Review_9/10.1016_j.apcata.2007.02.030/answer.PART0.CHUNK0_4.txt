[1] "Our group has performed extensive investigations on transition metal oxides catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes [6-12]."
[2] "Recently, we have reported [10-12] the high potential of a new class of catalytic materials based on nickel for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene."
[3] "The developed bulk NiNbO mixed nano-oxides [11] exhibit high activity in ethane ODH at low reaction temperature and very high selectivity, resulting in an overall ethene yield of 46% at 400 °C."
[4] "Varying the Nb/Ni atomic ratio led to an optimum catalytic performance for catalysts with Nb/Ni ratio in the range 0.1-0.18."
[5] "Detailed characterization of the as-synthesized materials with several techniques [11] showed that the key component for the excellent catalytic behavior is the NiNb solid solution formed upon the introduction of niobium in NiO, evidenced by the contraction of the NiO lattice constant."
[6] "An upper maximum dissolution of Nb5+ cations in the NiO lattice was attained for Nb/Ni ratios 0.18, with higher Nb contents leading to inhomogeneity and segregation of the NiO and Nb2O5 phases."
[7] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice, by substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric NiO surface structure, led to a reduction of the materials non-stoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2, electrical conductivity measurements [11] and isotopic oxygen (18O2) exchange [12]."
[8] "The Nb-induced effects were related to charge compensation phenomena, as a consequence of the Ni2+ substitution by Nb5+ and due to the difference of ionic charge, as discussed in detail in Ref. [11]."
[9] "Therefore, the excellent catalytic behavior of the NiNbO nano-oxides in ethane ODH is related to the electronic and structural rearrangement induced by the incorporation of niobium cations in the NiO lattice."
[10] "This substitution-induced enhancement in catalytic activity has been observed for several mixed-metal oxides with different structures [13-15], with however no concerted efforts to explore how the morphological changes arising from cationic substitution, such as changes in size, shape, surface area etc., are related or contribute to the observed catalytic performance."
[11] "In this work, we report an in-depth characterization of the developed NiNbO mixed oxides for ethane ODH (with Nb/Ni atomic ratios ranging from 0 to 0.25) using HRTEM observations, coupled with chemical analysis by EDS, in order to study the nanostructural features formed in the materials and their relation with the improved catalytic results."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The introduction of niobium cations into the nickel oxide lattice through substitution and filling of cationic vacancies leads to a reduction in the materials' non-stoichiometry, enhancing the selectivity for ethylene production. The Nb-induced effects involve charge compensation phenomena and are associated with changes in the crystallite size and surface area, contributing to the catalyst's overall activity and selectivity. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the detailed mechanisms of the electronic and structural rearrangements induced by cationic substitution and predicting the relationship between the morphological changes and catalytic performance.

The main challenges in modeling these systems include:
1. Understanding the detailed mechanisms of the electronic and structural rearrangements induced by cationic substitution.
2. Predicting the relationship between the morphological changes and catalytic performance, specifically how changes in size, shape, and surface area affect activity and selectivity.
3. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in the design of catalytic systems, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions involving complex alkanes like ethane and ethylbenzene.
