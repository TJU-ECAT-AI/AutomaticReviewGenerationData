1. The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by inducing specific nanostructural features that enhance the surface area and reactivity of the materials. The key challenges in theoretical modeling involve accurately predicting the interactions between dopants and vacancies, their effects on electronic properties, and how these changes impact catalytic activity and selectivity. Process optimization requires balancing factors such as reaction temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition to achieve desired product yields while maintaining catalyst stability and efficiency. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety often necessitates careful control of reaction conditions and the development of robust catalyst supports or additives.

2. The dopant Nb, when introduced into the NiO lattice, leads to the formation of a NiNb solid solution, which results in a reduction of the NiO non-stoichiometry. This reduction in non-stoichiometry leads to the elimination of unselective oxygen species, enhancing the selectivity of the catalysts towards ethylene in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The structural rearrangements induced by Nb incorporation also reduce the crystallite size, increasing the surface area and per-weight activity of the catalysts.

1. 在氧化脱氢反应中，镍基氧化物催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和位点形成影响其电子结构和催化性能，通过诱导特定的纳米结构特征来增强材料的表面积和活性。理论建模的关键挑战在于准确预测掺杂剂和空位之间的相互作用、它们对电子性质的影响以及这些变化如何影响催化活性和选择性。过程优化需要平衡反应温度、压力和原料组成等因素，以实现所需的产物产率，同时保持催化剂的稳定性和效率。平衡效率、选择性和安全性通常需要仔细控制反应条件和开发坚固的催化剂支撑或添加剂。

2. 当将Nb引入到NiO晶格中时，会导致NiNb固溶体的形成，从而导致NiO非化学计量性的减少。这种非化学计量性的减少导致了催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中乙烯选择性的提高。Nb引入所引发的结构重排也减少了晶粒尺寸，增加了催化剂的表面积和每单位质量活性。
