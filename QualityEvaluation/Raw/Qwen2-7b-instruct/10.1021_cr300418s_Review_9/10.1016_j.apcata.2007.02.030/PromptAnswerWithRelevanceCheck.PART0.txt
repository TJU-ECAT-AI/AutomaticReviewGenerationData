1. The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by inducing specific nanostructural features that enhance the surface area and reactivity of the materials. The key challenges in theoretical modeling involve accurately predicting the interactions between dopants and vacancies, their effects on electronic properties, and how these changes impact catalytic activity and selectivity. Process optimization requires balancing factors such as reaction temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition to achieve desired product yields while maintaining catalyst stability and efficiency. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety often necessitates careful control of reaction conditions and the development of robust catalyst supports or additives.

2. The dopant Nb, when introduced into the NiO lattice, leads to the formation of a NiNb solid solution, which results in a reduction of the NiO non-stoichiometry. This reduction in non-stoichiometry leads to the elimination of unselective oxygen species, enhancing the selectivity of the catalysts towards ethylene in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The structural rearrangements induced by Nb incorporation also reduce the crystallite size, increasing the surface area and per-weight activity of the catalysts.

1. 在氧化脱氢反应中，镍基氧化物催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和位点形成影响其电子结构和催化性能，通过诱导特定的纳米结构特征来增强材料的表面积和活性。理论建模的关键挑战在于准确预测掺杂剂和空位之间的相互作用、它们对电子性质的影响以及这些变化如何影响催化活性和选择性。过程优化需要平衡反应温度、压力和原料组成等因素，以实现所需的产物产率，同时保持催化剂的稳定性和效率。平衡效率、选择性和安全性通常需要仔细控制反应条件和开发坚固的催化剂支撑或添加剂。

2. 当将Nb引入到NiO晶格中时，会导致NiNb固溶体的形成，从而导致NiO非化学计量性的减少。这种非化学计量性的减少导致了催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中乙烯选择性的提高。Nb引入所引发的结构重排也减少了晶粒尺寸，增加了催化剂的表面积和每单位质量活性。

[1] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice, by substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric NiO surface structure, led to a reduction of the materials non-stoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2, electrical conductivity measurements [11] and isotopic oxygen (18O2) exchange [12] and consequently of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant in NiO and responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by inducing specific structural and electronic rearrangements. When niobium is introduced into the nickel oxide lattice, it substitutes nickel atoms and fills cationic vacancies, reducing the non-stoichiometry of the material. This leads to a decrease in the abundance of electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide. As a result, the catalysts become more selective towards ethylene production. The reduction of structural defects through the reaction with niobium enhances the surface area and activity of the materials, contributing to their superior catalytic performance in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, the key challenge lies in understanding the precise role of individual structures within the catalysts, especially regarding the contributions of the second Nb-rich phase to the catalytic performance, which remains unclear due to its inherent difficulty in isolation and evaluation.

The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involve accurately predicting the complex interactions between the dopants, defects, and reactants, optimizing the catalyst composition and structure for maximum efficiency and selectivity, and ensuring safe operation under industrially relevant conditions. Despite advancements in understanding the fundamental mechanisms, there is still a need for further research to develop robust, efficient, and environmentally friendly catalytic systems for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度以及空位形成影响其电子结构和催化性能。通过将铌引入镍氧化物晶格中，可以替代镍原子并填充阳离子空位，从而降低材料的非化学计量性。这导致电荷过剩氧物种（O）的数量减少，这些物种负责乙烷的完全氧化为二氧化碳。因此，催化剂变得更加选择性地生产乙烯。通过反应去除结构缺陷增强了材料的表面积和活性，从而提高了它们在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。

然而，在理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的关键挑战在于准确预测复杂相互作用的细节，包括掺杂物、缺陷和反应物之间的相互作用，优化催化剂组成和结构以实现最大效率和选择性，并确保在工业相关条件下安全运行。尽管在理解基本机制方面取得了进展，但仍需要进一步研究来开发稳健、高效且环境友好的催化系统用于氧化脱氢反应。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Low-temperature treatment of NiO leads to the formation of stacking faults due to cationic deficiency, enhancing reactivity. Doping with Nb causes the formation of two distinct structural phases - a Ni-rich crystallized phase with Nb cations incorporated in the NiO lattice, and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, which serves as a precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound. The elimination of NiO structural defects by Nb enhances the selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts in ethane ODH reactions by forming strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species, which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2.

在镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成的影响下，这些催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能会发生显著变化。低温处理NiO会导致由于正离子缺陷而产生堆积故障，从而提高活性。通过Nb掺杂形成了两种不同的结构相：一种是Ni富集的结晶相，其中Nb离子嵌入到NiO晶格中，并保持其原始晶体结构；另一种是高度畸变的Nb富集相，是形成混合NiNb2O6晶相的前体。通过Nb消除NiO的结构缺陷可以增强NiNbO催化剂在乙烷ODH反应中的选择性，因为这些空位导致形成了强氧化性的电负性氧物种（O），负责将乙烷完全氧化为CO2。

[2] "The study of the materials catalytic performance clearly demonstrated that introducing even small amounts of Nb in NiO convert nickel oxide from an effective total oxidation catalyst to an efficient low-temperature with very high selectivity ODH catalyst [11]."
[3] "By combining the present HRTEM investigations and all characterization results reported in Ref. [11] on pure NiO and NiNbO mixed oxides, the following can be deduced: pure NiO calcined at high temperatures is stoichiometric, structurally uniform and consists of long-range order, well-defined cubic microcrystallites. Calcination at low temperatures leads to the formation of a highly non-stoichiometric oxidic phase, with visible extensive structural defects due to cationic vacancies (i.e., nickel deficiency)."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by altering the surface properties and reactivity. Specifically, the substitution of nickel atoms with niobium cations in the nickel oxide lattice leads to a reduction in non-stoichiometry and an increase in the surface area, which enhances the catalytic activity. Low-temperature treatment of nickel oxide creates highly reactive stacking faults due to cationic deficiencies, facilitating the reaction of foreign species like niobium with these vacancies to form distinct structural phases. These phases contribute to the catalytic performance, particularly in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, by reducing the non-stoichiometry and eliminating unselective oxygen species, thus improving ethylene selectivity.

The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involve accurately predicting the complex interactions between the dopants, vacancies, and the catalyst's electronic structure. Optimization requires understanding how to control the dopant concentration and processing conditions to achieve the desired catalytic performance without compromising stability or safety. Balancing these factors necessitates a deep understanding of the underlying chemistry and physics involved in the catalytic reactions, as well as the ability to model these processes computationally with sufficient accuracy.

在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成影响其电子结构和催化性能，通过改变表面性质和活性。具体而言，镍氧合物晶格中镍原子被铌离子取代，导致非化学计量比的减少和表面积的增加，从而增强催化活性。低温处理镍氧化物会产生高度反应性的层错缺陷，由于阳离子缺位（即镍缺乏），这使得外来物种如铌与这些空位反应形成不同的结构相。这些相对催化性能有贡献，尤其是在乙烷氧化脱氢中，通过减少非化学计量比并消除不选择性氧物种，从而提高乙烯选择性和增强乙烷氧化脱氢活性。

这些催化系统的理论建模、过程优化以及平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战涉及准确预测复杂相互作用之间的复杂性，包括掺杂剂、空位和催化剂的电子结构。优化需要理解如何控制掺杂剂浓度和加工条件以达到所需的催化性能，同时不损害稳定性和安全性。平衡这些因素需要深入了解催化反应背后的化学和物理原理，以及能够计算这些过程的足够精确的建模能力。
