[1] "In-depth structural characterization of pure NiO and NiNb O mixed oxide catalysts (highly active and selective materials for the production of ethylene via ethane oxidative dehydro- genation) by HRTEM led to the identification of the nanostructural features formed upon doping of NiO with Nb cations."
[2] "Low-temperature treatment of NiO causes the formation of highly reactive stacking faults due to cationic deficiency."
[3] "The reaction of the foreign species (Nb) with these cationic vacancies leads to the formation of two distinct structural phases: a Ni-rich crystallized phase with Nb cations incorporated in the NiO lattice, which retains its original crystallographic structure, and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase,precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."
[4] "In terms of catalytic performance, the elimination of the NiO structural defects by niobium is responsible for the high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts in the ethane ODH reaction to ethylene, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O) responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Low-temperature treatment of NiO leads to the formation of stacking faults due to cationic deficiency, enhancing reactivity. Doping with Nb causes the formation of two distinct structural phases - a Ni-rich crystallized phase with Nb cations incorporated in the NiO lattice, and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, which serves as a precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound. The elimination of NiO structural defects by Nb enhances the selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts in ethane ODH reactions by forming strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species, which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2.

在镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成的影响下，这些催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能会发生显著变化。低温处理NiO会导致由于正离子缺陷而产生堆积故障，从而提高活性。通过Nb掺杂形成了两种不同的结构相：一种是Ni富集的结晶相，其中Nb离子嵌入到NiO晶格中，并保持其原始晶体结构；另一种是高度畸变的Nb富集相，是形成混合NiNb2O6晶相的前体。通过Nb消除NiO的结构缺陷可以增强NiNbO催化剂在乙烷ODH反应中的选择性，因为这些空位导致形成了强氧化性的电负性氧物种（O），负责将乙烷完全氧化为CO2。
