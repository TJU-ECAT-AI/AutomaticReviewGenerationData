[1] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice, by substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric NiO surface structure, led to a reduction of the materials non-stoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2, electrical conductivity measurements [11] and isotopic oxygen (18O2) exchange [12] and consequently of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant in NiO and responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."
[2] "The excellent catalytic behavior of the NiNbO nano-oxides in ethane ODH is related to the electronic and structural rearrangement induced by the incorporation of niobium cations in the NiO lattice."
[3] "The reaction of Nb with the cationic vacancies leads to rupture of larger crystals into smaller ones, thus increasing the surface area and consequently the per weight activity of the samples in the ethane ODH reaction."
[4] "The elimination of the NiO structural defects by niobium is responsible for the high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts in the ethane ODH reaction to ethylene, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O) responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by inducing specific structural and electronic rearrangements. When niobium is introduced into the nickel oxide lattice, it substitutes nickel atoms and fills cationic vacancies, reducing the non-stoichiometry of the material. This leads to a decrease in the abundance of electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide. As a result, the catalysts become more selective towards ethylene production. The reduction of structural defects through the reaction with niobium enhances the surface area and activity of the materials, contributing to their superior catalytic performance in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, the key challenge lies in understanding the precise role of individual structures within the catalysts, especially regarding the contributions of the second Nb-rich phase to the catalytic performance, which remains unclear due to its inherent difficulty in isolation and evaluation.

The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involve accurately predicting the complex interactions between the dopants, defects, and reactants, optimizing the catalyst composition and structure for maximum efficiency and selectivity, and ensuring safe operation under industrially relevant conditions. Despite advancements in understanding the fundamental mechanisms, there is still a need for further research to develop robust, efficient, and environmentally friendly catalytic systems for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度以及空位形成影响其电子结构和催化性能。通过将铌引入镍氧化物晶格中，可以替代镍原子并填充阳离子空位，从而降低材料的非化学计量性。这导致电荷过剩氧物种（O）的数量减少，这些物种负责乙烷的完全氧化为二氧化碳。因此，催化剂变得更加选择性地生产乙烯。通过反应去除结构缺陷增强了材料的表面积和活性，从而提高了它们在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。

然而，在理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的关键挑战在于准确预测复杂相互作用的细节，包括掺杂物、缺陷和反应物之间的相互作用，优化催化剂组成和结构以实现最大效率和选择性，并确保在工业相关条件下安全运行。尽管在理解基本机制方面取得了进展，但仍需要进一步研究来开发稳健、高效且环境友好的催化系统用于氧化脱氢反应。
