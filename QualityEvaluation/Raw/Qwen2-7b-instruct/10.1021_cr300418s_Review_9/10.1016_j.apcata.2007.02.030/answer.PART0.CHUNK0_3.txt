[1] "The incorporation of Nb in the NiO lattice, by substitution of nickel atoms and/or filling of the cationic vacancies in the defective non-stoichiometric NiO surface structure, led to a reduction of the materials non-stoichiometry, as indicated by TPD-O2, electrical conductivity measurements [11] and isotopic oxygen (18O2) exchange [12] and consequently of the electrophilic oxygen species (O), which are abundant in NiO and responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."
[2] "The study of the materials catalytic performance clearly demonstrated that introducing even small amounts of Nb in NiO convert nickel oxide from an effective total oxidation catalyst to an efficient low-temperature with very high selectivity ODH catalyst [11]."
[3] "By combining the present HRTEM investigations and all characterization results reported in Ref. [11] on pure NiO and NiNbO mixed oxides, the following can be deduced: pure NiO calcined at high temperatures is stoichiometric, structurally uniform and consists of long-range order, well-defined cubic microcrystallites. Calcination at low temperatures leads to the formation of a highly non-stoichiometric oxidic phase, with visible extensive structural defects due to cationic vacancies (i.e., nickel deficiency)."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by altering the surface properties and reactivity. Specifically, the substitution of nickel atoms with niobium cations in the nickel oxide lattice leads to a reduction in non-stoichiometry and an increase in the surface area, which enhances the catalytic activity. Low-temperature treatment of nickel oxide creates highly reactive stacking faults due to cationic deficiencies, facilitating the reaction of foreign species like niobium with these vacancies to form distinct structural phases. These phases contribute to the catalytic performance, particularly in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, by reducing the non-stoichiometry and eliminating unselective oxygen species, thus improving ethylene selectivity.

The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involve accurately predicting the complex interactions between the dopants, vacancies, and the catalyst's electronic structure. Optimization requires understanding how to control the dopant concentration and processing conditions to achieve the desired catalytic performance without compromising stability or safety. Balancing these factors necessitates a deep understanding of the underlying chemistry and physics involved in the catalytic reactions, as well as the ability to model these processes computationally with sufficient accuracy.

在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成影响其电子结构和催化性能，通过改变表面性质和活性。具体而言，镍氧合物晶格中镍原子被铌离子取代，导致非化学计量比的减少和表面积的增加，从而增强催化活性。低温处理镍氧化物会产生高度反应性的层错缺陷，由于阳离子缺位（即镍缺乏），这使得外来物种如铌与这些空位反应形成不同的结构相。这些相对催化性能有贡献，尤其是在乙烷氧化脱氢中，通过减少非化学计量比并消除不选择性氧物种，从而提高乙烯选择性和增强乙烷氧化脱氢活性。

这些催化系统的理论建模、过程优化以及平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战涉及准确预测复杂相互作用之间的复杂性，包括掺杂剂、空位和催化剂的电子结构。优化需要理解如何控制掺杂剂浓度和加工条件以达到所需的催化性能，同时不损害稳定性和安全性。平衡这些因素需要深入了解催化反应背后的化学和物理原理，以及能够计算这些过程的足够精确的建模能力。
