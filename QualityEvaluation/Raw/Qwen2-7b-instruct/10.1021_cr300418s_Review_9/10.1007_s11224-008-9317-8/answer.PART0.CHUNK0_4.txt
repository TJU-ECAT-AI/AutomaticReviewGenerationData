[1] "Biotechnology, one of the most important scientific technologies of the twenty-first century, is the commercial application of living organisms like bacteria, fungi, plant cells, viruses, yeasts, and mammalian cells or their products, which involves the deliberate manipulation of their DNA molecules."
[2] "Biochemical engineering employs biotechnologies' methods for the industrial production and processing of chemical substances, food and feed, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other materials, and it deals with the design of apparatus and vessels suitable for carrying out biochemical reactions."
[3] "This two-volume collection is based on the latest online edition of the critically acclaimed standard reference source, Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, and includes articles that have not yet been published in print, e.g., a cutting-edge survey of biorefineries (Article 17)."
[4] "Although, as might be expected from an anthology from Ullmann's, almost half (38) of the book's 74 academic and industrial contributors are German, it is an international enterprise with world-renowned authorities from the United States (13), United Kingdom (seven), Switzerland (six), Japan, and the Netherlands (four each), and Australia and Austria (one each)."
[5] "The 18 articles are divided into numbered sections, subsections, subsubsections, and subsubsubsections, each with bibliographies, including thousands of articles, books, and Internet sites as recent as 2006. Hundreds of figures as well as chemical and mathematical equations and tables are provided."
[6] "Both volumes contain lists of symbols and units, conversion factors, abbreviations, country codes, and a periodic table of the elements. A 23 double-column-page index in small type from Alkaloids to Zymomonas mobilis makes location of material very easy."
[7] "An idea of the scope of the collection can be gleaned from the following list: Volume 1 (xviii + 455 pp.) Biotechnology (155 pp., 821 references) Nucleic Acids (38 pp., 353 references) Techniques for DNA Analysis (19 pp., 11 references) Polymerase Chain Reaction (38 pp., 93 references) Amino Acids (60 pp., 422 references) Peptide Synthesis (15 pp., 37 references) Peptide and Protein Hormones (114 pp., the longest article; 2025 references) Monoclonal Antibodies (13 pp., 45 references)"
[8] "Volume 2 (xviii + 399 pp.) Genetic Engineering (35 pp., 251 references) Mutagenic Agents (9 pp., 5 references) Enzymes (81 pp., 431 references) Enzymes and Immunoassays (28 pp., 96 references) Biochemical Engineering (70 pp., 75 references) Immobilized Biocatalysts (52 pp., 296 references) Non-immobilized Biocatalysts in Industrial Fine Chemical Synthesis (21 pp., 75 references) Biochemical Separations (28 pp., 89 references) Biorefineries-Industrial Processes and Products (33 pp., 196 references) Biomass Chemicals (7 pp., the shortest article; 21 references)"

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. These include reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The electronic structure affects the reactivity of the catalyst, while dopants and vacancies can alter the surface properties, leading to changes in selectivity and activity. Key challenges in theoretical modeling involve accurately predicting these effects under various operating conditions. Process optimization requires balancing multiple factors, including the efficiency of the reaction, the selectivity towards desired products, and ensuring safety during operation. Balancing these aspects often necessitates trade-offs and may require extensive experimental testing to fine-tune the catalyst formulation and operating parameters.
