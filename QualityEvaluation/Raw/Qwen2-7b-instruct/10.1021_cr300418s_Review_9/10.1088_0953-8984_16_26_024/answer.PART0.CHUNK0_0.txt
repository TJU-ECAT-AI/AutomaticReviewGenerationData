The gradient-corrected functionals which work better for the properties of NH3/NiO and CO/NiO (energies, geometries,vibrations) provide wrong answers for NO/NiO and vice versa.

A correct description of the bonding of both closed-shell (NH3 and CO) and open-shell (NO) molecules to NixMg1xO is obtained only after inclusion of dynamical correlation and dispersion forces via wavefunction- based methods.

1. Introduction
A correct description of the bonding of molecular complexes to transition metal oxide surfaces is of fundamental importance for the understanding of problems in catalysis, gas sensors,corrosion protection, etc. The bonding of simple molecules such as NH3, CO, and NO to metal oxides represents a serious challenge to theorists. A recent experimental paper on the structure of these molecules on NiO(100) [1, 2] has highlighted the weakness of current theoretical descriptions of oxidemolecule bonding, in particular as regards the bond lengths (and hence the bond strengths). Nowadays, two basically different approaches are used to describe the bonding at surfaces. Wavefunction-based methods with explicit inclusion of correlation effects (e.g. through configuration interaction or perturbative treatments) were developed in the 1980s and 1990s and can be applied within the local cluster model approach.
Their use is not straightforward and their application is restricted to relatively small systems.
This is one reason for the wide use of density functional theory (DFT) in the description of the surface chemical bonding and of the electronic structure of solids and surfaces [3].
Historically, DFT was developed to perform band structure calculations where periodic boundary conditions are properly taken into account. Thanks to the introduction of hybrid exchangecorrelation functionals, the description of bond dissociation energies in molecular complexes has also approached so-called chemical accuracy (errors < 1 kcal mol1).However, recent studies on some special problems (magnetic coupling [4], localized holes in insulators [5, 6], weakly interacting systems [7, 8], etc) have shown limitations of DFT which may lead to a physically incorrect picture or to a strong dependence of the results on the exchangecorrelation functional.

The document discusses the challenges in describing the bonding of NH3, CO, and NO to NiO and Ni-doped MgO surfaces using density functional theory (DFT). The main points are:

1. Recent experimental studies have raised questions about the capability of current theoretical methods to accurately describe the bonding of these molecules to NiO surfaces.
2. Different density functionals work well for the properties of NH3/NiO and CO/NiO but provide wrong answers for NO/NiO and vice versa.
3. This issue is not due to the difficulty in describing the insulating character of NiO, but rather to the inability of DFT to handle the complexities of bonding between open-shell (NO) and closed-shell (NH3 and CO) molecules and the surface.
4. Including dynamical correlation and dispersion forces through wavefunction-based methods improves the description of bonding, but uncertainties still exist in predicting the energy of adsorption of NO on NiO.
5. While complete-active-space self-consistent field (CASPT2) calculations agree reasonably well with experimental data, approximate coupled-cluster calculations underestimate the adsorption energy.

These findings highlight the limitations of DFT in accurately modeling the bonding between transition metal oxides and molecular complexes, especially for open-shell species like NO.

文献讨论了描述NH3、CO和NO在NiO及Ni掺杂MgO表面的键合使用密度泛函理论（DFT）所面临的挑战。主要观点如下：

1. 近期实验研究表明，当前的理论方法在准确描述这些分子与NiO表面键合方面存在不足。
2. 不同的密度函数对NH3/NiO和CO/NiO的性质描述较好，但对于NO/NiO则提供错误答案，反之亦然。
3. 这个问题并非源于描述NiO绝缘性质的困难，而是DFT难以处理开放壳层（如NO）与表面之间以及闭合壳层（如NH3和CO）分子之间的复杂键合问题。
4. 通过波函数基方法引入动态相关性和分散力可以改善键合描述，但仍存在预测NO在NiO上吸附能的不确定性。
5. 完全活性空间自洽场（CASPT2）计算与实验数据有较好的一致性，而近似耦合簇计算低估了吸附能。

这些发现表明，在精确模拟过渡金属氧化物与分子复合物之间的键合，特别是对于开放壳层物种（如NO）时，DFT存在局限性。
