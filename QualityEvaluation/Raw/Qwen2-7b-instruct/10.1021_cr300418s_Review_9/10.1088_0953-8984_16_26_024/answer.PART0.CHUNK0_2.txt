[4] "The B3LYP method does not provide a satisfactory description of the three bonds."
[5] "LDA appears to be totally inadequate since it fails even to correctly predict NiO as an insulator."

1. The multi-reference character of the ground state indicates that the system involves multiple reference states beyond a single determinant, which complicates the description of the bonding.
2. The bonding of ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitric oxide (NO) to nickel oxide (NiO) surfaces poses significant difficulties for theoretical models.
3. In NO/NiO and NO/NiMg8O9 systems, the paramagnetic NO molecule interacts with a magnetic Ni2+ ion in an open-shell 3d8, 3B2 configuration, leading to complex bonding interactions.
4. The B3LYP method does not provide an adequate description of the bonding characteristics of these molecules to NiO surfaces.
5. The Local Density Approximation (LDA) fails to accurately predict the insulating nature of nickel oxide, indicating its inadequacy in modeling the properties of NiO.

1. 这表明基态具有多参考特性，系统涉及多个参考状态而非单一基态，这使得描述这些分子与NiO表面的结合变得更加复杂。
2. NH3、CO和NO与NiO表面的结合是理论模型面临的一个重大挑战。
3. 在NO/NiO和NO/NiMg8O9系统中，顺磁性NO分子与磁性Ni2+离子在开放壳层3d8、3B2配置下相互作用，导致复杂的结合交互。
4. B3LYP方法无法提供对这些分子与NiO表面结合特性的满意描述。
5. 局部密度近似（LDA）未能准确预测镍氧化物的绝缘性质，表明其在建模NiO属性方面的不足。
