[1] "The DFT results exhibit a strong dependence on the exchangecorrelation functional used and that in some cases this results in a qualitatively wrong picture of the interaction."
[2] "Functionals which provide the best answers for NH3/NiO and CO/NiO are inadequate to describe the bonding in NO/NiO and vice versa."
[3] "The reason for this failure lies in the description of the on-site Coulomb repulsion in Ni2+."
[4] "The ordering of the 2A curves follows the same trend; see figure 1."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly affect their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key challenges in theoretical modeling involve accurately representing these factors, optimizing the process for maximum efficiency, selectivity, and safety. The document highlights difficulties in describing the bonding of simple molecules like NH3, CO, and NO to NiO surfaces using current theoretical methods, especially when it comes to the bond lengths and thus bond strengths. This is due to limitations in density functional theory (DFT) in describing the interactions and spin states of these molecules with NiO. Different exchange-correlation functionals yield varying results, often failing to provide a consistent, accurate picture of the bonding across all molecules. For instance, the hybrid B3LYP approach provides a poor description of the bonding for all three molecules, while the gradient-corrected BLYP functional offers a better match for CO/NiO but fails for NO/NiO. These discrepancies suggest that while some functionals may provide good results for certain molecules, they may fall short for others, indicating a need for more sophisticated theoretical approaches that can account for dynamical correlation and dispersion forces, as well as more precise descriptions of electronic interactions.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响它们在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能。理论建模的关键挑战在于准确地表示这些因素，并优化过程以实现最大效率、选择性和安全性。文献强调了描述简单分子（如NH3、CO和NO）与NiO表面之间的相互作用时，当前理论方法面临的困难，特别是关于键长和因此键强度的问题。这主要是由于密度泛函理论（DFT）在描述这些分子与NiO之间相互作用和自旋状态方面的局限性。不同的交换相关函数会产生不同的结果，有时会导致对所有分子的相互作用提供不一致或不准确的图像。例如，混合B3LYP方法对所有三种分子的描述效果不佳，而梯度校正BLYP功能在描述CO/NiO时提供更好的匹配，但在描述NO/NiO时失败。这些差异表明，虽然某些功能可能为某些分子提供良好的结果，但对于其他分子而言，则需要更高级的理论方法，能够考虑到动态相关性和散射力，以及更精确的电子相互作用描述。
