[1] "The DFT results exhibit a strong dependence on the exchangecorrelation functional used and that in some cases this results in a qualitatively wrong picture of the interaction."
[2] "For NO/NiMg8O9 the U-B3LYP approach gives De = 0.25 eV (BSSE corrected), a NiN distance of 2.02 Å, but a spin distribution which is contrary to experiment; see table 3."
[3] "Clearly, the B3LYP method does not provide a satisfactory description of the three bonds."
[4] "The reason for this failure lies in the description of the on-site Coulomb repulsion in Ni2+."

1. The DFT results are highly sensitive to the exchangecorrelation functional employed, leading to inaccuracies in describing interactions in systems like NH3, CO, and NO bonded to NiO or Ni-doped MgO surfaces.
2. Using the U-B3LYP method on NO/NiMg8O9 results in an incorrect bond energy (De = 0.25 eV), NiN distance (2.02 Å), and spin distribution, contrary to experimental findings.
3. The B3LYP method fails to adequately describe the bonding characteristics of the three molecules.
4. The failure in describing NO/NiO bonding stems from the overestimation of the on-site Coulomb repulsion in Ni2+, affecting the electron affinity and the ordering of the 2A curves.

1. 密度泛函理论（DFT）的结果高度依赖于所使用的交换关联函数，导致在描述NiO或Ni掺杂MgO表面吸附的NH3、CO和NO分子间的相互作用时出现不准确的情况。
2. 使用U-B3LYP方法处理NO/NiMg8O9时，得到的键能（De = 0.25 eV）、NiN距离（2.02 Å）以及自旋分布与实验结果不符。
3. B3LYP方法未能正确描述三种分子的结合特性。
4. NO/NiO结合失败的原因是过估计了Ni2+中的本征库仑排斥力，影响了Ni的电子亲和能和2A曲线的排列顺序。
