[1] "Their first goal was to give examples of important, representative new catalytic oxidations and to consider them in a way that could lead to greater understanding of these reactions so that this insight might provide better design of catalytic oxidation processes."
[2] "The second goal that the authors set out was to take a fresh look at long established ideas and concepts, to ascertain their limitations and, by so doing delineate guidelines for future research."
[3] "The authors also highlight the enormous contributions made by catalytic oxidation technology to the chemical industry, noting that more than half the products made using catalytic processes and nearly all the monomers used for the production of fibers and plastics are obtained through selective oxidation."

Selective Oxidation by Heterogeneous Catalysis discusses the application of heterogeneous catalysts in industrial petrochemical production, focusing on the selective oxidation process. The book aims to clarify fundamental concepts necessary for a better understanding of new opportunities in this field and the design of new catalysts or catalytic reactions. It emphasizes not only the catalyst itself but also its role within the process, highlighting the relationship between catalyst design and engineering aspects of the process. The authors aim to provide insights that could lead to improved design of catalytic oxidation processes and suggest new innovative directions for research. The book covers various aspects of selective oxidation, such as trends and outlook, new technological and industrial opportunities, control of surface reactivity, new fields of application, new concepts and strategies, new aspects of mechanisms and structure/activity relationships, and general conclusions. It also highlights the significant contributions of catalytic oxidation technology to the chemical industry, stating that over half of the products made using catalytic processes and nearly all monomers used for fiber and plastic production are obtained through selective oxidation.
