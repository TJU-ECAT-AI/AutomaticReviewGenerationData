It is well known that the physical properties of some transition-metal compounds ~mostly oxides! are
strongly affected by intra-atomic correlations. Very recently, investigations of the adsorption of small mol-
ecules such as CO on the surfaces of transition-metal oxides have led to rather surprising results: the weak
adsorbate-substrate bonding and the asymmetric ~tilted! adsorption geometries contrast sharply the strong
bonding and symmetric geometries characteristic for metallic surfaces. Calculations based on either Hartree-
Fock or density-functional methods have failed to explain these observations. For bulk transition-metal oxides
it has been demonstrated that the addition of a Hubbard-type on-site Coulomb repulsion U to the local-density
Hamiltonian leads to an improved description of the electronic structure of these materials, but a consistent
description of all physical properties proved to be elusive. In the present work, we present a comprehensive
investigation of bulk NiO and of clean and CO-covered NiO~100! surfaces. We demonstrate that adding the
on-site Coulomb repulsion to the spin-polarized gradient-corrected density-functional Hamiltonian leads to a
consistently improved description of a wide range of cohesive, electronic, and magnetic properties of NiO
~bulk and surface! and a very accurate description of the adsorption properties of CO. The effects of the strong
electronic correlations in the substrate on the adsorbate-substrate bonding are discussed in detail.

I. INTRODUCTION
The surfaces of metal oxides, and in particular transition-
metal oxides, play an extremely important role in heteroge-
neous catalysis, either as active catalysts or as support for
nanostructured metallic catalysts.1–3 The adsorption and re-
actions of molecules on metallic surfaces have been studied
extensively by both experimental and theoretical techniques.
Due to the progress realized in computational density-
functional theory ~DFT!, excellent agreement between theory
and experiment has been achieved for the structural param-
eters characterizing the adsorbate-substrate complex: usually
adsorbate-substrate bond lengths can be calculated within a
few hundreds of an angstrom, and vibrational frequencies
with a maximum error of 3 pct. Energy barriers of surface
reactions can be predicted with an accuracy sufﬁcient for a
quantitative analysis of reaction rates.4
On the other hand, despite the considerable fundamental
and industrial interest, our knowledge of transition-metal ox-
ide ~TMO! surfaces is much more limited. Experimental
data, especially for molecular adsorbates on transition-metal
oxides, are rather scarce. This is due to both the difﬁculties
in preparing well-characterized single-crystal surfaces and to
the fact that the application of electron emitting or adsorbing
spectroscopic techniques to insulating surfaces is difﬁcult
due to charging. In theoretical studies, standard density-
functional techniques often fail in predicting even the most
fundamental properties of bulk transition-metal oxides such
as the presence or absence of a gap at the Fermi level; e.g.,
local-spin-density calculations predict NiO to be either me-
tallic or a semiconductor with a very narrow gap, whereas in
experiment5–9 it is found to be an antiferromagnetic insulator
with a gap ranging between 4.0 eV and 4.3 eV. Similar dis-
crepancies between theory and experiment have been en-
countered for many TMO’s. Under these circumstances, only
a very few attempts have been made to study molecular re-
actions on TMO surfaces.
The failure of density-functional theory is due to the fact
that the electronic structure of many TMO’s is dominated by
the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion ~strong correlation! be-
tween the d electrons. A number of attempts have been made
to
overcome
the
limitations
of
the
local-spin-density-
approximation ~LSDA! for TMO’s. Again NiO may serve as
a very illustrative example. For NiO these ‘‘beyond-LSDA’’
investigations include the GW treatments of Aryasetiawan
and Gunnarsson10 and of Massidda et al.,11 the self-
interaction corrections ~SIC! to the LSDA of Svane and
Gunnarsson12 and of Szotek et al.,13 the three-particle cor-
rection to the LSDA proposed by Calandra and Manghi,14 the
LSDA1U method developed by Anisimov et al.,15 reformu-
lated by Liechtenstein et al.16 and applied to NiO by Du-
darev et al.,17 and a Hartree-Fock study by Towler et al.18
Very recently, Bredow and Gerson19 have applied unre-
stricted Hartree-Fock, gradient-corrected DFT, and hybrid
techniques to investigate the bulk properties of NiO. The
results of these studies may be summarized as follows ~again
these conclusions concern not only NiO, but a wide class of
strongly correlated TMO’s!: Hartree-Fock ~HF! calculations
grossly overestimate the width of the gap and underestimate
the cohesive energies. Adding electronic correlation effects
in the form of the functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr20 ~HF-
LYP! improves the prediction of the cohesive energy with-
out, however, correcting the band gap. Adding generalized
gradient corrections to the LSDA leads to a reasonable cohe-
sive energy and lattice constant, but produces only a minimal
gap of 0.4 eV. This can be corrected either by adding many-
body terms ~GW or SIC!, by using a hybrid functional mix-
ing exact exchange with DFT ~B3LYP!,21 or by adding a
Hubbard term describing the strong on-site Coulomb repul-

sion U to the LSDA Hamiltonian (DFT1U). All three meth-
ods lead to the opening of a gap ranging between 2.6 eV
~SIC!, 3.0 eV (LSDA1U, depending on the strength of the
on-site potential U), and 4.2 eV ~B3LYP!. Qualitatively,
there is a general agreement that the top of the valence band
is of mixed Ni-d and O-p character, whereas the bottom of
the conduction band is Ni-d-like. Hence while the gap is
caused by the Ni-d correlation, it is neither of a pure Mott-
Hubbard d-d nor of a pure charge-transfer ~O-p–Ni-d) type.
However, even within the post-DFT approaches differences
in quantitative predictions for band gap, exchange splitting,
and other physical properties persist.10–13,17,19
The electronic structure of TMO surfaces has been stud-
ied experimentally using x-ray photoemission spectroscopy
~XPS!, electron-energy-loss spectroscopy ~EELS!, and scan-
ning tunneling microscopy ~STM!. For NiO~100! surfaces,
extensive EELS work of Gorschlu
¨ter and Merz22 yields in-
formation on surface d-shell excitation. Atomically resolved
STM images of the NiO~100! surfaces23 show the surprising
result of a contrast reversal when the applied bias voltage is
reversed. Out of the many techniques that have been used to
study bulk NiO, only the LSDA1U approach has been ap-
plied to extended TMO surfaces. Calculations by Dudarev
et al.24 found two types of surface states on NiO~100!, a
ﬁlled state consisting primarily of pz orbitals on the oxygen
atoms and an empty surface state originating from Ni-
d3z22r2 orbitals. These surface states explain the observed
contrast reversal and suggest that at the surface the charge-
transfer character of the gap might be more pronounced than
in the bulk.
Experimental determinations of the structural properties
of molecular adsorbates on TMO surfaces have been per-
formed for the model systems CO, NO, and NH3 adsorbed
on a NiO~100! surface.25–27 The comparison of the measured
bond lengths and adsorption energies of the same species on
a metallic Ni surface demonstrated that the adsorption on the
surface of the TMO is much weaker than on a metallic sur-
face. In addition, all three adsorbed molecules were found in
a tilted conﬁguration instead of in a strictly vertical position
like on most metal surfaces. The tilt angle is relatively mod-
est for CO (1266°) and NH3 (766°), but as large as 45°
for NO. Quantum-chemical ab initio calculations for small
NiO clusters on the Hartree-Fock level28–30 produced signiﬁ-
cantly larger bond lengths and even lower adsorption ener-
gies with respect to experiment and failed to reproduce the
observed tilting of the adsorbates. This result was interpreted
as a signiﬁcant ‘‘failure of current theoretical methods.’’26,27
Very recently, Di Valentin et al.31 and Bredow32 have per-
formed cluster calculations on the adsorption of NO ~Ref.
31! and CO ~Ref. 32! on NiO~100! using Hartree-Fock,
density-functional, and hybrid methods. Both groups of au-
thors come to somewhat different conclusions. Di Valentin
et al. argue that although bonding of NO to NiO cannot be
described by single-determinant approaches ~and conse-
quently by DFT!, spin-polarized DFT calculations with hy-
brid functionals lead to reasonable adsorption geometries ~in-
cluding the tilt of the adsorbed molecule!. However, a strong
dependence on the exchange-correlation functional is noted
for the adsorption strength ~from strongly bound to unbound!
and the spin properties, and this is attributed to different
descriptions of the Coulomb repulsion within the 3d shell.
Bredow reports a good agreement for the Ni-CO bond length
~a possible tilting of the molecule was not considered! with
the B3LYP functional, but ﬁnd the molecule to be almost
unbound (Ead50.02 eV). Surprisingly, in spite of the very
weak adsorbate-substrate interaction, adsorption leads to a
large down-shift of the CO stretching frequency which has
not been observed experimentally. Hence many questions re-
main open.
The aim of the present work is twofold.
~i! We have implemented the DFT1U method in its ro-
tationally invariant form proposed by Liechtenstein et al.16
in a full-potential electronic structure code @the Vienna ab
initio simulation package33–37 ~VASP!#. In this form the
DFT1U Hamiltonian is based on the full all-electron orbit-
als and densities. This should be considered as a step forward
compared to the implementation in codes using mufﬁn-tin
orbitals and the atomic-sphere approximation.
~ii! The DFT1U approach implemented in VASP has been
used to investigate the physical properties of bulk NiO and
of clean NiO~100! surfaces, and to perform a detailed inves-
tigation of the adsorption of CO molecules on this surface.
The experimentally well-characterized CO/NiO~100! system
has been used as a test case for exploring the ability of the
DFT1U approach to study molecular adsorption on TMO
surfaces. We demonstrate that a semilocal spin-polarized
generalized gradient approximation ~SGGA! to the LSDA
functional, together with the on-site Coulomb repulsion U
~resulting in a SGGA1U approach! leads to an improved
and consistent description of the cohesive, structural, me-
chanical, electronic, and magnetic properties of bulk NiO
and NiO surfaces. Even more importantly, we demonstrate
that the SGGA1U approach allows us to describe the ad-
sorption energy and geometry of CO on NiO~100! in almost
perfect agreement with experiment. Our paper is organized
as follows: In Sec. II we recapitulate the foundations of the
DFT1U approach and its implementation in VASP within the
framework
of
the
projector-augmented
wave
~PAW!
method.38,37,39 Sections III and IV describe the results for
bulk NiO and a clean NiO~100! surface, demonstrating that a
SGGA1U approach leads to an accurate and consistent de-
scription of bulk and surface properties. Section V presents a
detailed study of the adsorption properties of CO on
NiO~100! in the LSDA, SGGA, LSDA1U, and SGGA1U
approximations, and we conclude in Sec. VI.
II. THEORETICAL METHODS
A. DFT¿U method
Transition-metal compounds such as NiO experience a
strong on-site Coulomb-repulsion amongst Ni-3d electrons
due to the narrow d-band-width, which is not correctly de-
scribed in a spin-polarized DFT treatment. This error can be
corrected with the DFT1U method, which is a combination
of the DFT in either the LSDA or SGGA and a Hubbard
Hamiltonian for the Coulomb repulsion and exchange inter-
action. For the present calculations we use a simple DFT

1U version, proposed by Dudarev et al. in Ref. 17. It is
based on a model Hamiltonian with the form17

where n
ˆ ms is the operator yielding the number of electrons
occupying an orbital with magnetic quantum number m and
spin s at a particular site.
The Coulomb repulsion is characterized by a spherically
averaged Hubbard parameter U describing the energy in-
crease for placing an extra electron on a particular site, U
5E(dn11)1E(dn21)22E(dn), and a parameter J repre-
senting the screened exchange energy. While U depends on
the spatial extension of the wave functions and on screening,
J is an approximation to the Stoner exchange parameter and
almost constant ;1 eV. The Mott-Hubbard Hamiltonian in-
cludes energy contributions already accounted for by the
DFT functional. To correct for this ‘‘double counting,’’ Eq.
~1! is estimated in the limit of integer occupancies and sub-
tracted from the DFT energy to obtain the spin-polarized
DFT1U energy functional.24,17 A simple functional is ob-
tained after some straightforward algebra:17

This energy functional is yet not invariant with respect to
a unitary transformation of the orbitals. A formulation given
by Liechtenstein et al.16 replaces the number operator by the
on-site density matrix rij
s of the d electrons to obtain a rota-
tionally invariant energy functional. In the present case this
yields the functional17

~3!
The interpretation of this DFT1U functional is particularly
simple. In the limit of an idempotent on-site occupancy ma-
trix rs,
rs25rs,
the DFT1U functional yields exactly the same energy as the
DFT functional EDFT1U5EDFT . The second term in Eq. ~3!
enforces this idempotency. If U.J, the term is positive deﬁ-
nite, since the eigenvalues ni of the on-site occupancy matrix
can vary only between 0 and 1:
rs2rsrs5(
i
ni
s2ni
s2.0,
where the sum on the right-hand side is over all eigenvalues
ni of the on-site occupancy matrix rs. Hence the second
term in Eq. ~3! can be interpreted as a positive-deﬁnite pen-
alty function driving the on-site occupancy matrices towards
idempotency. The DFT1U energy obtained in this manner is
always larger than the DFT energy. The ‘‘strength’’ of the
penalty function is parametrized by a single parameter U
2J. A larger U2J forces a stricter observance of the on-site
idempotency. This is achieved by lowering the one-electron
potential locally for a particular metal d orbital and in turn
modifying the hybridization with the ligand atoms. The one-
electron potential is given by the functional derivative of the
total energy with respect to the electron density, i.e., in a
matrix representation,

It is recognized that ﬁlled d orbitals which are localized on
one particular site are moved to lower energies, by 2(U
2J)1/2, whereas empty d orbitals are raised to higher ener-
gies by (U2J)1/2.
B. Implementation within the projector-augmented wave
method
The DFT1U is implemented in the PAW method as de-
scribed by Bengone et al.39 In the PAW method, the all-
electron ~AE! wave function Cn is related to the pseudo-
wave-function C
˜ n through a linear transformation,38,37
uCn&5uC
˜ n&1(
i
~ufi&2uf
˜ i&)^p
˜ iuC
˜ n&.
~5!
The index i is a shorthand for the atomic site R, the an-
gular momentum numbers L5l,m and an additional index n
referring to the reference energy enl of the partial waves fi .
The all-electron partial waves fi are solutions of the Schro
¨-
dinger equation for a spherical symmetric reference atom,
and the pseudo-partial-waves f
˜ i are equivalent to the AE
partial waves outside a core radius rc and match continu-
ously onto f
˜ i inside the core radius. The projector functions
p
˜ i are dual to the partial waves:
^p
˜ iuf
˜ j&5dij .
Starting from Eq. ~5! it is possible to show that the AE
charge density is given by a sum of three terms in the PAW
method ~for details we refer to Refs. 38 and 37!:

Here, n
˜ is the soft pseudo-charge-density related directly to
the pseudo-wave-functions C
˜ n . The on-site charge densities
n1(r) and n
˜ 1(r) are only deﬁned inside spheres with radius
rc centered around each atom ~PAW spheres!. For the densi-
ties n1(r) and n

For a complete set of partial waves, the density n1(r) is
exactly equivalent to the exact all electron charge density
within the PAW sphere:
n~r!5n1~r!,
which is the crucial relation on which the present implemen-
tation of the DFT1U method rests.
To derive the PAW1U method, one needs to deﬁne the
orbital density matrix rmm8 entering Eq. ~3!. The natural
deﬁnition is based on the AE charge density inside the PAW
augmentation spheres, n1(r), which can be written more ex-
plicitly as

With the restriction to l and l852, one can therefore relate
the on-site density matrix rmm8 to the PAW on-site occu-
pancy matrix r(lmn),(lm8n8)

This establishes the crucial link between the PAW and the
DFT1U method. For further details the reader is referred to
Ref. 39. At this point we only add a few remarks concerning
the implementation of the DFT1U approach in the PAW
method in relation to that in other band-structure codes.
~i! Within the PAW method the calculation of the density
matrix is based on the extended AE orbitals, whereas, e.g.,
within the LMTO-ASA ~atomic sphere approximation!
method it is based on the mufﬁn-tin orbitals deﬁned within
overlapping atomic spheres producing only pseudo electron
densities.
~ii! The PAW approach is a frozen-core method. A relax-
ation of the core could inﬂuence the results, although we
expect this to be less important for NiO than for materials
with ‘‘semicore’’ states not too far below the bottom of the
valence band.
C. Further computational details
In this work, the calculations were performed with
VASP.33–37VASP is a ﬁrst-principles plane-wave code, treating
exchange and correlation in the DFT scheme. The projector-
augmented wave ~PAW! method38 in the implementation of
Kresse and Joubert37 is used to describe the electron-ion in-
teraction. At the level of the LSDA, the exchange-correlation
functional proposed by Perdew and Zunger40 ~based on the
quantum Monte Carlo calculations of Ceperley and Alder41!
is used. Generalized gradient corrections ~GGC’s! are added
in the form of the Perdew-Wang42 functional. For spin-
polarized calculations, the spin interpolation of Vosko et al.43
was used. GGC’s add, through the dependence of the func-
tional on the gradient of the electron and spin densities, a
semilocal element to the purely local LSDA functional. The
inﬂuence of the GGC’s on the results of the calculations of
physical properties is by now well documented ~see, e.g.,
Moroni et al.44 and further references given therein!.
~i! They correct the overbinding tendency characteristic
for the LSDA, leading to smaller cohesive energies and
larger equilibrium lattice constants.
~ii! For magnetic systems, GGC’s predict a slightly en-
hanced exchange splitting and larger magnetic moments.
Generally, the magnetic state is stabilized relative to the non-
magnetic state—the most striking example is Fe where only
the SGGA predicts the correct ground state ~body-centered
cubic and ferromagnetic!, whereas the LSDA predicts non-
magnetic hexagonal Fe to be lower in energy.44
~iii! For molecular adsorption at metallic surfaces, the
LSDA predicts in many cases a qualitatively incorrect
potential-energy surface, whereas the SGGA results in a cor-
rect description of the adsorption/desorption dynamics.45,46
~iv! The inﬂuence of the gradient corrections is largest for
the light elements where the overbinding tendency of the
LSDA is most severe. For very heavy elements, the GGC’s
eventually overcorrect the LSDA error. Part of the present
study is also aimed at exploring the interplay of the GGC’s to
the LSDA Hamiltonian with the Hubbard term. This question
has hardly received any attention so far.
The Kohn-Sham equations are solved via iterative matrix
diagonalization based on the minimization of the norm of the
residual vector to each eigenstate and optimized charge- and
spin-mixing routines.47–49 To sample the band structure, the
Brillouin-zone integration is performed using Monkhorst-
Pack grids.50 The unit cells are usually extended in one di-
rection due to symmetry breaking in antiferromagnetic set-
ups. k- point grids varying from 33331 to 63634 were
used. The densities of states ~DOS’s! were calculated using
the linear tetrahedron method.51–53 For the calculation of the
total energy as a function of volume, a Gaussian-smearing
approach with s50.2 eV was used. The plane-wave cutoff
was ﬁxed to 330 eV. The DFT1U version of Dudarev
et al.17 described above was used for all calculations. Since
the DFT1U functional depends only on the difference U
2J, J was kept ﬁxed to 1 eV during all calculations. The
U2J50 case represents the DFT limit.
III. BULK NICKEL OXIDE
Bulk nickel oxide is an antiferromagnetic insulator with
an experimental band gap between 4.0 and 4.3 eV according
to different experiments.5–8 It crystallizes in the rocksalt
structure with a lattice constant of a54.17 Å. Below its
Ne
´el temperature of TN5523 K, it assumes an antiferromag-
netic type-II ordering @planes with collinear spins are parallel
to the ~111! plane# with local magnetic moments of
(1.64–1.77)mB at saturation.

1U. The results are compiled in Table I. We ﬁrst note that
the LSDA yields a 9% too small lattice constant of 4.07 Å, a
too large bulk modulus, a 20% too small magnetic moment,
and no gap. The SGGA improves the results somewhat by
correcting the overbinding characteristic for the LSDA ~we
also note good agreement with the SGGA results of Bredow
and Gerson19!. A small band gap of 0.5 eV opens, and the
local magnetic moment increases to 1.28mB , both are too
small compared to experiment. The lattice constant and the
bulk modulus on the other hand agree reasonably well with
experiment. There is deﬁnitely a need for further improve-
ment by including correlation effects.
To determine the optimal value for the on-site Coulomb
potential, U was varied between U50 and U59 eV. Figure
1 shows the dependence of the equilibrium lattice constant,
the magnetic moment, and the band gap as calculated in the
SGGA1U approach. The lattice parameter shows only a
weak dependence on U, while the magnetic moment and the
band gap increase monotonously with increasing U. For the
magnetic-moment agreement with experiment is achieved at
U;5 eV, while the measured band gap can be matched only
at U>8 eV. The variation of all physical quantities with U
in a LSDA1U approach is similar, but as disagreement be-
tween theory and experiment is much larger in the LSDA
than in the SGGA, a much larger value of U is required to ﬁt
the experimental values ~for the lattice constant agreement
cannot be achieved for any acceptable value of U) and the
scatter of the values required to ﬁt different physical quanti-
ties is also much larger. Within the SGGA1U, a value of
U2J55.3 eV leads to reasonable values for all considered
physical properties: magnetic moment and bulk modulus
agree within experimental uncertainty, the lattice constant is
;0.5% too large, although the band gap is still underesti-
mated by nearly 1 eV. To ﬁt the band gap, a value of U
>8 eV is required, such a large value, however, would lead
to a bad overall description of the electronic spectrum. We
also note reasonable agreement with the results based on the
B3LYP hybrid functional.
In the present calculations, the lattice constant is hardly
affected by the inclusion of the on-site Hubbard term, in
contrast to previous studies using the LMTO-ASA method
with similar DFT1U corrections done by Dudarev et al.17
The reason for this discrepancy is not quite clear, but could
be due to the frozen-core approximation applied in the
present work. As in other DFT1U calculations, the minority
eg orbital is shifted to higher energies by the on-site Cou-
lomb repulsion. This reduces the hybridization between the
minority Ni-eg and O-p orbitals, decreasing the covalent
bonding between O-p and eg states. This process should
yield an increase in the volume. In our calculations, however,
this seems to be counterbalanced by a contraction of the t2g
orbitals which reduces the Pauli repulsion between d orbitals
and O-p states.

of the valence band is dominated by O-2p states weakly
hybridized with the Ni-3d states, the upper part of the va-
lence band and the lowest conduction band are of almost
pure Ni-3d character, the top of the valence has Ni-eg char-
acter for the majority spins, and Ni-t2g character for the mi-
nority spins. The lowest excited states are minority Ni-eg
states. Hence the small gap that exists in the SGGA is of
Mott-Hubbard-type. The SGGA band structure is quite simi-
lar to the LSDA result of Bengone et al.,39 but in the SGGA
we note a stronger overlap of the t2g and eg manifolds of the
majority states due to a down-shift of the occupied eg states
caused by the larger magnetic moment and exchange split-
ting than in the LSDA. At increasing U, the exchange split-
ting of the eg states is strongly increased, at U56.3 eV we
ﬁnd a value of about 9.5 eV, in good agreement with the GW
calculations of Massida et al.11 who report a splitting of 9
eV. The LSDA1U calculations of Bengone et al.39 produce
a smaller splitting of 8.6 eV at U55 eV, in accordance with
the difference we have already noted between the LSDA and
SGGA results. Compared to the O-2p states, the Ni-t2g states
are shifted to larger binding energies, resulting in a strongly
increased O-2p–Ni-3d hybridization. At the top of the va-
lence band we now have states with predominantly O-2p
character and a small admixture of Ni-t2g states for both
majority and minority electrons; hence the band gap is a
mixture of a charge transfer and a Mott-Hubbard d-d type.
At U56.3 eV, the calculated width of the gap is 3.1 eV in
the LSDA1U and 3.2 eV in the SGGA1U approximation,
in reasonable agreement with the GW gap of 3.5 eV. The SIC
calculations
of
Szotek
et al.13
and
of
Svane
and
Gunnarsson12 agree on a smaller gap of 2.5 eV, they also
produce a magnetic moment of only 1.5mB . The mixed Ni-
d–O-p character of the top of the valence band is also in
good agreement with the B3LYP calculations,19 although
they result in a somewhat broader gap. Increasing the on-site
Coulomb repulsion beyond U;6 eV leads to an exchange
splitting signiﬁcantly larger than that obtained in the GW
calculations and enhances the O-p character of the top of the
valence band. The mixed character of the top of the valence
band is also conﬁrmed by a comparison of the experimental
XPS ~Ref. 54! and the O Ka x-ray emission spectra.55,56 The
XPS spectrum is dominated by emission from Ni states and
the O Ka XES spectrum by emission from O-2p states, both
spectra show considerable intensity at the top of the valence
band.
Detailed investigations of the dispersion of the occupied
electronic eigenstates have been performed using angular-
resolved
ultraviolet
photoemission
spectroscopy
~ARUPS!.25,57 Comparison of theory and experiment at an
absolute energy scale is difﬁcult because the experiments
have been performed on samples in which the Fermi level
was pinned at different energies in the gap. In previous at-
tempts to compare theory and experiments,39,57 the alignment
of the various sets of experimental data and of the theoretical
bands has been arbitrarily chosen in order to make experi-
ment and theory agree at the highest valence band at the G
point. We consider this procedure as quite problematic as it
misaligns the spectra with respect to the Fermi level. We
proceed in a slightly different way. Figure 3 shows our
SGGA and SGGA1U results for the bands along the G-X
direction, compared with the ARUPS experiments of Shen
et al.57 and Kuhlenbeck et al.25 For each data set, the top of
the valence band was located at De/2 below the energy zero
at the Fermi level, using the experimental and calculated
value of the band gap De as appropriate for each case. The
ARUPS data show essentially four signiﬁcant features: the
two almost dispersionless features at energies of ;22 eV
and ;23.6 eV marked by triangles in Figs. 3~a! and 3~b!
have been assigned, on the basis of the variation of the in-
tensity with the energy of the incident photons, to the Ni-3d
band. For these features we note a very good agreement with
our SGGA1U calculations. As discussed by Shen et al., the
details of the photoemission intensities also show indications
for a splitting into several weakly dispersing bands, also in
agreement with the calculations. The strongly dispersive fea-
tures marked by circles in Figs. 3~a! and 3~b! have been
assigned to oxygen bands. For the upper of these two bands
we ﬁnd again good agreement with the SGGA1U results.
The lower of these two bands shows strong dispersion in the
center of the Brillouin zone and is rather ﬂat towards the X
point. In this region we note good agreement with the
SGGA1U result, whereas the strongly dispersive part can-
not be associated with a single continuous band. In both sets
of experimental data, an additional feature ~not shown in the
dispersion relations with a rather weak dispersion! is located
at 29 eV binding energy. Its intensity increases strongly
with increasing photon energy, which is consistent with its
Ni-3d character. This feature agrees quite well with the
lower edge of the Ni valence band that is pushed to lower
energies by the on-site Coulomb interactions in the SGGA
1U—in contrast in a SGGA calculation the lower edge of
the band is of oxygen character. The data of Kuhlenbeck
et al. @see Fig. 3~d!# agree quite well with those of Shen
et al. Only the lowest Ni band has not been included in this
study. Altogether we note a quite satisfying agreement of the
SGGA1U results with experiment.

IV. CLEAN „100… SURFACE
Cleavage of NiO along the ~100! plane yields a nonpolar
and rather stable surface. The magnetic ordering in the sur-
face plane is antiferromagnetic with parallel spins aligned in
nearest-neighbor rows.59 Table II compares our present re-
sults with other theoretical calculations and experiment. The
LSDA calculations predict an outward relaxation of the top
layer,
contrasting
the
inward
relaxation
found
in
the
experiment,58 and a quite substantial buckling of 0.1 Å ~the
Ni atoms move outwards compared to the O atoms! which
has not been observed. The SGGA, LSDA1U, and SGGA
1U calculations on the other hand predict a small (;1%)
inward relaxation of the top layer, an even weaker outward
relaxation of the subsurface layer, and almost no buckling.
The magnetic moment of the Ni surface atoms is almost
unaffected by this modest structural relaxation, but the gap is
slightly narrowed compared to the bulk. A previous investi-
gation of the NiO surface using LSDA by Dudarev et al.24
has been performed on a bulk-terminated surface geometry,
without allowing any relaxation. In accordance to our results,
no change in the magnetic moment and a slight band narrow-
ing compared to the bulk have been reported.
The layer-resolved density of states as calculated using
SGGA and SGGA1U is shown in Fig. 4.
We ﬁrst note that the empty minority eg band splits into
two well-separated subbands at the surface. As discussed in
Ref. 24, the peak at the conduction band edge originates
from the dz2 states which, at the surface, experience only the
ﬁeld originating from the oxygen atoms below the Ni surface
atom, whereas the crystal ﬁeld felt by the dx22y2 orbital is
hardly modiﬁed compared to the bulk. This leads to a sizable
reduction of the band gap at the surface from 0.5 eV to 0.1
eV and 3.2 to 2.9 eV in SGGA and SGGA1U respectively.
Figure 5 shows the dispersion relations of the electronic
eigenstates of our slab model, together with the bulk disper-
sion relations projected onto the surface Brillouin zone. It is
evident that the Ni-eg surface states are split from the lower
edge of the conduction band, whereas at the top of the va-
lence band, all bands merge with the continuum of bulk
states. In a scanning tunneling microscopy with positive
sample bias, states at the lower conduction-band edge are
imaged; the strong localization of the Ni-eg surface states
leads to a rather sharp image contrast.23,59 Experiments with
a negative sample bias on the other hand image states at the
top of the valence band. The dominant O-p character of these
states explains the contrast reversal observed in the STM
experiments as the bias is reversed, the overlap of these
states with the bulk bands leads to a signiﬁcantly more dif-
fuse STM image.
V. CO ADSORPTION ON NiO„100…
Experimentally26,27 it is known that CO adsorbs exother-
mally on NiO~100! with an adsorption energy of 0.3 eV and
an adsorption bond length Ni-C of 2.07 Å. The C-O bond
length remains 1.15 Å, close to the gas-phase bond length.
Both the Ni-C (;763°) and the C-O (1266°) bonds are
tilted with respect to the surface normal. Compared to CO
adsorbed on the metallic Ni~111! surface, which has an ad-
sorption energy of ;1.2 eV, the adsorption on NiO~100! is
much weaker.
Former calculations of Pacchioni et al.28 and Po
¨hlchen
and Staemmler29 for this system performed in the Hartree-
Fock approximation and using small clusters to represent the
NiO surface show a substantial overestimation of the Ni-C
bond length while underestimating the adsorption energy
only slightly ~see Table III!. The tilts are not reproduced.

Very recently Bredow32 used cluster-based Hartree-Fock,
density-functional, and hybrid methods to investigate the ad-
sorption of CO on NiO~100!. The rather wide scatter in the
Hartree-Fock results illustrate the difﬁculties to achieve con-
vergence with respect to cluster size and basis set. The best
agreement for the Ni-C bond length is achieved using the
B3LYP hybrid functional, but it also gives an almost zero
adsorption energy and a too large negative shift of the C-O
stretching frequency. The possibility of a tilted adsorption
geometry was evidently not considered, but we note that Di
Valentin et al.31 found a stable tilted geometry for NO on
NiO~100! using B3LYP. All other methods lead to a substan-
tial disagreement for the adsorption length.
A. Adsorption geometry and energy
We have examined the adsorption of CO on NiO~100!
using the LSDA, SGGA, LSDA1U, and SGGA1U meth-
ods, with U56.3 eV, as optimized for bulk NiO. The two
topmost layers and the CO molecule were allowed to relax.
The coverage was varied between 1 ML, 0.5 ML, and 0.25
ML ~where ML stands for monolayer! by using c(131),
c(A23A2) and c(232) supercells, respectively ~see Fig.

6!. Initially the CO molecule was kept parallel to the surface
normal, but in a second step a tilt with respect the surface
normal was considered. In a range of Ni-C-O angles from 0°
to 30°, starting points for relaxations were deﬁned at inter-
vals of 5° for tilts in both the @010# and the @001# directions.
Initially, the angles between the surface normal and the Ni-C
and C-O bonds were assumed to be the same. For each of
these initial conﬁgurations, the z ~@001#! and y ~@010#! coor-
dinates of the O atom were ﬁxed, so that the atom could only
move in the @100# direction. The C atom was free to move in
all directions so that the angles of the Ni-C and C-O bonds
relative to the surface normal can be different and both the
Ni-C and C-O bond lengths can be optimized. The variation
of the adsorption energy as a function of the tilting angle of
the C-O band is illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, and adsorption
energies, bond lengths, and tilting angles for the optimal ad-
sorption geometry are summarized in Table III and compared
with experiment and previous theoretical studies.
In both the LSDA and SGGA, any tilting of the molecule
from a perpendicular position is energetically unfavorable. In
the LSDA, the calculated Ni-C bond length is too short by
0.4 Å; the calculated adsorption energy is four times higher
than measured. This is characteristic for the overbinding ten-
dency of the LSDA. Generalized gradient corrections lead
only to a marginal improvement: a small increase in the ad-
sorption distance by 0.05 Å ~which is still much too small!
and a reduction of the adsorption energy by nearly 50%
~which is still too large!. For the Ni-C bond length, our
SGGA results are rather close to the BLYP results of
Bredow,32 but the PW functional or the plane-wave basis set
leads to a much larger adsorption energy. Only if the on-site

Coulomb repulsion is added to the DFT functional, tilting
was found to be energetically stable in both @010# and @001#
directions, with a tilt towards the oxygen atom ~@001# direc-
tion! in the surface plane being energetically less stable than
a tilt towards the nickel atom ~@010# direction!. The tilting is
strongest at a coverage of 0.5 ML, at larger coverage lateral
interactions reduce the tilting. At the lower coverage of 0.25
ML, the increasing adsorbate-substrate bonding also reduces
the tendency to tilt away from the surface normal. In the
LSDA1U, the Ni-C bond length is still too small by about
0.24 Å and the adsorption energy is largely overestimated. In
agreement with our results on bulk NiO and on the clean
surface, the best results are achieved using the SGGA1U
approach: Ni-C, C-O bond lengths, tilting angles, and ad-
sorption energies agree almost perfectly with experiment. As
the results compiled in Table III demonstrate, the calculated
Ni-C bond length agrees with experiment within 0.02 Å, the
tilt angles also agree within the experimental uncertainty, and
even the adsorption energies are accurate to within 0.05 eV.
B. Bonding mechanism
The tilted adsorption geometry for a weakly adsorbed lin-
ear molecule such as CO is a rather surprising result. On the
surfaces of transition metals, CO is usually adsorbed in an
upright position for metals with a nearly full d band. On the
surfaces of metals with a half or less than half-ﬁlled d band,
CO is dissociated. Only on the relatively open a-Fe~100!
surface, CO is molecularly adsorbed in a tilted conﬁguration,
forming an angle of 45610° with respect to the surface
normal60–62 and dissociates upon heating. In contrast, both
on the close-packed ~110! surface of a-Fe and on the sur-
faces of thin ﬁlms of g-Fe, CO is adsorbed in an upright
position63 and desorbs in molecular form. Hence in these
cases, the tilted conﬁguration appears as a precursor to dis-
sociation, and adsorbate-substrate interactions are mediated
by strong covalent bonds. It has been shown64 that the tilting
observed on the a-Fe~100! surface is induced by a strong
hybridization between O-p orbitals extending parallel to the
surface and t2g orbitals of the substrate atoms. However, it
cannot be expected that these results, which apply to a
strong-bonding situation, can be transferred straightfor-
wardly to the weakly bonded CO on NiO.
Quite generally, the bonding of a CO molecule to a
transition-metal atom of the substrate can be attributed to the
hybridization of the highest occupied molecular orbital
~HOMO! and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
~LUMO! of CO with d orbitals in the appropriate energy
range. For CO on NiO~100! this leads to the following
scenario:28 ~i! The empty Ni-dz2 build hybrid orbitals with
the fully occupied 5s HOMO of CO ~donation!, ~ii! the
occupied Ni-dzx and Ni-dzy orbitals build hybrid orbitals
with the unoccupied 2p* LUMO of CO ~back-donation!.
The former process contributes to the formation of the
adsorbate-substrate bond and the latter to the reduction of the
intramolecular bond strength. The adsorption properties of
CO on NiO~100! are therefore dependent on the degree of
hybridization of these orbitals, which depends on their rela-
tive position.
The source of failure of the LSDA and SGGA calcula-
tions, where the Ni-C bond length is substantially underesti-
mated and the adsorption energy is overestimated, is the in-
correct description of the Ni-d states, leading to a too strong
hybridization between the 2p* LUMO of CO and the ﬁlled
Ni-dzx and Ni-dzy states and to a reduction of the intramo-
lecular bond strength. In DFT1U calculations the increased
exchange splitting pushes the Ni-t2g states to much lower
energies and reduces strongly the 2p*-(dzx1dzy) hybridiza-
tion and hence the adsorption strength.

wards a neighboring O atom ~@001# direction! have been explored.

These effects are very clearly reﬂected in the local partial
densities of states. Figures 9 and 10 compare the results for
the spin-polarized Ni-t2g , -dz2, and-dx22y2 states and for the
2p!, 5s, and 1p molecular orbitals of CO as obtained in
the SGGA, without and with the on-site Coulomb repulsions.
In the SGGA, the signiﬁcant features are the broadening and
bonding/antibonding splitting of the Ni-dz2 and CO 5s
DOS’s as well as the bonding/antibonding splitting in the CO
2p! DOS, leading to an incipient population of these anti-
bonding molecular orbitals. In the SGGA1U, the dz2-5s
interaction is reduced to the majority states and the 2p!
states remain completely empty. This means that mechanism
~i! dominates the adsorbate-substrate bond.
While the analysis of the projected DOS helps us to un-
derstand the reduction of the adsorption strength resulting
from the electronic correlation effects, the tilting of the mol-
ecule is a more subtle effect. DFT ~LSDA or SGGA!1U
predicts a substantial tilt of both Ni-C and C-O bonds. In the
upright conﬁgurations, only the 5s-dz2 and 2p*-(dzx
1dzy) interactions are nonzero by symmetry. The former
(pds)-type coupling is relatively insensitive against a tilting
of the molecule, while the latter (pdp)-type coupling
strongly prefers the upright conﬁguration. If the (pdp) in-
teraction is strong ~as in LSDA and SGGA!, the upright
high-symmetry conﬁguration is the stable one. In the
SGGA1U calculations, this type of interaction is strongly
reduced by the increased exchange splitting, as evidenced by
the lack of a 2p* peak at the energy of the t2g states. Hence,
the bonding between the substrate and the molecule is no
longer directional, and the CO molecule can tilt without a
signiﬁcant loss of covalent binding energy. Furthermore, in a
symmetry-broken tilted conﬁguration, the dz2 states can in-
teract with both p orbitals of the CO molecule ~initially sym-
metry forbidden!. The corresponding changes in the local
partial densities of states are found to be rather minute. To
underline the previous argument we show in Fig. 11 charge-
density ﬂow ~difference electron density! diagrams for CO in
an upright and a tilted conﬁguration as calculated in SGGA
1U. In both ﬁgures negative charge ﬂow ~dark color! is

nisms discussed above. In the tilted conﬁguration, an addi-
tional lobe with negative charge ﬂow appears at the C atom
pointing towards the tilting direction, and a charge accumu-
lation is visible at the opposite side of the C atom indicated
by an arrow in Fig. 11. These features are caused by the
rehybridization of the 1p and 2p* orbitals with the dz2
states, resulting in a small net binding. Certainly the strength
of the binding can be determined only on the basis of a full
ab initio calculation, and it is difﬁcult to deduce it from a
simpliﬁed analysis on the basis of the density of states or
charge ﬂow.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
We have presented a comprehensive investigation of the
physical properties of bulk NiO, of clean and CO-covered
NiO~100! surfaces, both using density-functional theory and
using the DFT1U approach in which a Hubbard term de-
scribing the strong on-site Coulomb interactions is added to
the density-functional Hamiltonian. In the past repeated at-
tempts have been made to describe the properties of the
strongly correlated transition-metal oxides within the DFT
framework, but it remained unclear whether a comprehensive
description of all physical properties could be achieved with
a single value of the on-site Coulomb potential. It should
also be emphasized that various DFT variants may be found
in the literature, differing in the way in which the energy
contributions which are included in both the Hubbard term
and in the DFT Hamiltonian are subtracted out. In our cal-
culations we have adopted the rotationally invariant formu-
lation of the DFT1U Hamiltonian introduced by Liechten-
stein et al.16 and Dudarev et al.17 and implemented it in the
projector-augmented-wave method, which is one of the most
accurate full-potential all-electron electronic structure meth-
ods. We have also investigated both local ~LSDA! and
gradient-corrected ~SGGA! exchange-correlation functionals.
The comparison of the LSDA1U and SGGA1U for
bulk NiO leads to the ﬁrst important result: while in the
LSDA1U approach it turns out to be difﬁcult to achieve
good agreement for all physical properties—to ﬁt the equi-
librium volume and bulk modulus to experiment would re-
quire a substantially larger value of the on-site potential than
required to ﬁt the band gap or the magnetic moments—
consistent description with a physically reasonable value of
U56.3 eV is achieved in the SGGA1U, which also im-
proves the calculated binding energy. A SGGA1U calcula-
tion also leads to a good description of the clean NiO sur-
face. The result that the Hubbard on-site term should be used
best in conjunction with a gradient-corrected DFT functional
conﬁrms very recent results on the less strongly correlated
transition-metal sulﬁdes. For bulk NiO we ﬁnd that the
SGGA1U description leads to similar results as calculations
based on hybrid functionals mixing exact exchange to the
SGGA functional.19
We have shown that the strong on-site correlations lead to
a qualitative change in the adsorption behavior of CO on
NiO. While a pure DFT ~LSDA or SGGA! approach predicts
a strong-binding situation and an upright adsorption geom-
etry, the SGGA calculation leads to an adsorption geometry
and energy in perfect agreement with experiment. This is
achieved with the same value of the on-site Coulomb poten-
tial that has been used in the bulk calculations. The weak
binding and the tilting of the molecule away from the surface
normal are shown to result from the increased exchange
splitting of the Ni-d states, which largely suppresses the
2p*-(dzx1dzy) interaction and enables a 1p-dz2 hybridiza-
tion favoring the tilted geometry.
Whereas for bulk NiO the use of a hybrid B3LYP func-
tional provides a physically reasonable interpolation between
the HF approaches ~which overestimate gap and exchange
splitting! and DFT ~leading to metallic behavior!, the situa-
tion is different for CO adsorption: in this case B3LYP pre-
dicts a reasonable Ni-C bond, but an almost unbound CO
molecule.
In summary, using CO on NiO surfaces as a testing
ground, we have demonstrated that a DFT1U approach
could provide not only a reasonable strategy for calculating
not only the bulk properties of strongly correlated transition-
metal compounds, but in addition lead to signiﬁcant ad-
vances in the description of molecular adsorption on the sur-
faces of these important materials as well. Preliminary
results on other TMO’s and their surfaces (Fe2O3 , Cr2O3,
etc.!65–67 suggest that these conclusions drawn here for a test
system have more general validity.
