Abstract
We have been exploring various new catalyst systems for the utilization of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant in the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene. The utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant for the commercially important catalytic dehydrogenation of EB to styrene has received enormous attention recently due to its several attractive features. This review summarizes the results of our most recent findings on zirconia-based composite oxide catalyst systems exploited for this reaction. Under this systematic and comprehensive investigation various zirconia-based composite oxide catalysts namely, TiO2-ZrO2, MnO2-ZrO2, CeO2-ZrO2, K2O/TiO2-ZrO2, B2O3/TiO2-ZrO2 and CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 have been synthesized, characterized by various techniques and evaluated for the title reaction. Most of these composite oxide catalysts were found to exhibit very interesting physicochemical characteristics and exceptionally better catalytic properties for this reaction. As revealed by characterization results, a large number of acid–base sites with moderate strength are essential for a high conversion and product selectivity of this reaction with CO2 as the soft oxidant.

1 Introduction
Carbon dioxide has taken a center stage in the environmental domain in recent years. One of the most alarming global environmental problems of today is the greenhouse effect. Especially, the global warming caused by the accelerative accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere is causing a lot of concern all over the world [1]. However, the CO2 cannot be considered as a bad and unwanted entity; it possesses a number of characteristic features that suggest utilization of CO2 could provide both environmental and economical benefit [2]. One such approach for its efficient utilization is as a soft oxidant for catalytic selective oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of various hydrocarbons including ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene and lower alkanes such as ethane, propane and butane to value added products ethylene, propylene and butene, respectively [2–4]. There is a lot of interest on this subject ever since it was realized that styrene could be produced selectively via this new approach by selective dehydrogenation of EB utilizing CO2. The dissociation of CO2 on the surface of an appropriate catalyst system produces active oxygen species. Therefore, several chemical reactions could be benefited from using CO2 as a mild oxidant, or as a selective source of active ‘oxygen’ atoms.
Since 1996, our research group has been actively engaged on the development of efficient catalyst systems and the technology for the dehydrogenation of EB to styrene employing CO2 [5, 6]. During the course of our continued efforts several catalyst systems namely, zeolite supported iron oxide [7], iron oxide on γ-Al2O3 [8], antimony promoted vanadium oxide [9, 10], and other have been developed [11–15]. Significance of these catalyst systems for the title reaction has been consolidated from time-to-time in various journals [5, 6]. The primary aim of our research work on this topic has always been to design a better catalyst system in terms of activity, selectivity and stability in time-on-stream experiments. On those lines our most recent investigations revealed that several zirconia-based composite oxides, in particular TiO2-ZrO2, MnO2-ZrO2, CeO2-ZrO2, K2O/TiO2-ZrO2, B2O3/TiO2-ZrO2, and CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 exhibit very interesting and exceptionally better catalytic properties for this reaction [16–20]. This review has been undertaken to signify the salient features of these studies together. The importance of composite oxides, role of acid–base properties, redox characteristics, and relationships between the observed catalytic performance and the structural features of these catalyst systems have been emphasized systematically in this review. The historical perspective of ODH of EB and the beneficial role of CO2 in the EB dehydrogenation process have also been briefly discussed.
2 Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethylbenzene to Styrene
Styrene is one of the most important basic chemicals in the modern petrochemical industry. It is mainly employed as a monomer for the production of many different synthetic polymer materials, such as polystyrene, styrene–acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) and styrene–butadiene latex. The most important commercial production routes for styrene are the catalytic dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of large quantities of steam at high temperatures and the epoxidation process of propylene and ethylbenzene hydroperoxide over a molybdenum-based catalyst resulting styrene and propylene oxide [21–25]. The catalytic dehydrogenation of EB with potassium promoted iron(III) oxide catalyst is responsible for 90% of the world styrene production and it is one of the 10 most important industrial processes. The dehydrogenation of EB over potassium-promoted iron oxide is performed at around 600–650 °C in excess of steam (steam/EB = 7–15 mol/mol), just below the temperature where thermal cracking becomes significant [25]. This process primarily yields styrene as the main reaction product, and benzene and toluene being the side products. Due to high endothermic (125 kJ/mol) nature and volume increasing character of the reaction, a large amount of superheated steam is necessary to supply the heat and lower the partial pressure of reactants to shift the equilibrium towards the styrene product [22, 25]. However, much of the latent heat of steam is lost at the gas-liquid separator due to rapid quenching of the product as it is necessary. The heat consumption during this high temperature process is a substantial part of the total costs of the styrene production. Therefore, there is a large interest to develop better catalysts or a new process that can decrease the reaction temperature and energy consumption significantly. Also due to rapid demand of synthetic rubber, the research on this subject has been actively pursued all over the world.
The dehydrogenation of EB process is normally operated by incorporating an excess steam to the EB in an adiabatic reactor under pressurized conditions at high temperatures wherein steam plays several important roles such as (a) the medium for supplying heat to the endothermic dehydrogenation, (b) diluent of EB to increase equilibrium conversion and (c) to avoid coke deposition on the catalyst [22, 25]. It is now being established that carbon dioxide can play the above-mentioned three crucial roles. Several papers concerning the CO2 as an active oxidative reactant transforming EB into styrene have also been emerged [26–40]. The mechanism of this reaction has also been fairly established [5, 6]. There are at least two possible pathways for the EB dehydrogenation with CO2. The reaction can proceed by oxidative dehydrogenation of EB through oxygen species dissociated from CO2 in a single-step route and dehydrogenation of EB coupled with reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS) in the two-step process [9, 26, 30, 40]. In spite of some uncertainty, the final result is same—carbon monoxide and water molecules are formed besides styrene in stoichiometric ratios. Application of CO2 instead of water steam significantly lowers the energy costs. As per an estimation, a simple replacement of water steam with CO2 in a styrene installation should decrease the energy consumption from 6.4 to 0.8 GJ/t of styrene [24]. It should be taken into account that world demand for styrene is more than 20 Mt/year.
3 Salient Features of CO2 as an Oxidant
Turning carbon dioxide into a useful feedstock chemical could help to reduce levels of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, as well as providing a cheap source of carbon or CO and active oxygen. Of course, the transformation of CO2 into more useful organic substances is a promising long term objective. The production of chemicals by utilizing CO2 could have a small but significant positive impact on the global carbon balance. Carbon dioxide is a totally renewable feedstock compared to oil or coal. Carbon dioxide is generally considered to be a green or environmentally benign solvent or medium in that it is relatively nontoxic, nonflammable, and naturally abundant. As such, CO2 has also been suggested as a sustainable replacement for organic solvents in a number of chemical processes.
Carbon dioxide is known to be less reactive than molecular oxygen and water molecule for gasification of coke and carbon monoxide. As defined by Bartholomew [41], the oxidizing ability of various gases in the gasification of coke is as follows: O2 (105) > H2O (3) > CO2 (1) > H2 (0.003). The numbers in the parenthesis clearly indicate that the CO2 could be considered as an oxidant. The typical prominent features of these gases have been summarized in a tabular form in a recent review by Park and Han [5]. As per the literature, CO2 can act as a soft oxidant as well as diluent, however it is unlike from oxygen and steam. It has the highest heat capacity among other typical gases. Therefore, it is very useful for minimizing the hot spot phenomenon on the catalyst surface [26]. It is well-known that strong oxidant like O2 facilitates burning of significant quantities of valuable hydrocarbons leading to the generation of unwanted carbon oxides. On the other hand steam leads to loss of a large amount of latent heat upon condensation at a gas-liquid separator following the reaction. Therefore, a soft oxidant like CO2 is highly desirable for efficient conversion of EB to styrene and in other related oxidative conversions.
The significance of CO2 as a soft oxidant has also been recognized by various other research groups by employing in different reactions. Several prominent features of CO2 have also been pointed out which include, for example, CO2 accelerates the reaction rate [42], enhances the selectivity [43], alleviates the chemical equilibrium [24], suppresses the unwanted total oxidation products [27], prevents the hot spots on the catalyst surface [44], and poisons the nonselective sites of the catalysts [42]. By considering all these unique features, the CO2 could be coined as a soft oxidant for utilization in the oxidative conversion of EB to styrene [5]. To date, several research groups have also tried to generalize the function and the role of CO2 as an oxidant for catalytic conversion of various hydrocarbons including EB to styrene [5, 26–40, 45, 46]. It has also been realized that oxygen species of CO2 is useful for oxidative conversion of various hydrocarbons and reforming of CH4 [7–10]. For example, Yoo found that adding CO2 to the oxidation reaction of alkylaromatics with O2 enhances the rate of reaction and improves the selectivity towards the aldehyde and oxygenate products [27].
4 Significance of ZrO2-based Mixed Oxides
Metal oxides represent one of the most important and widely employed categories of solid catalysts, either as active phases or supports. Metal oxides have been extensively utilized both for their acid–base and redox characteristics, and constitute the largest family of catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis [47–49]. Among various metal oxides, the combination of titania-zirconia has attracted considerable attention in recent years as an active catalyst as well as support for a wide variety of reactions as summarized in a recent review by Reddy and Khan [50]. Most interestingly, both ZrO2 and TiO2 single oxides exhibit excellent catalytic properties for several reactions and both have been extensively utilized as supports to disperse various noble and transition metals for different catalytic applications. The ZrO2 with an appropriate promoter is a well-known solid acid catalyst [51–53] and the TiO2 is unique for its photocatalytic and strong metal support interaction (SMSI) properties [54–57]. It is an established fact in the literature that mixing two dissimilar oxides adds another parameter since they are liable to form new stable compounds, which can lead to totally different physicochemical properties and the catalytic behavior. With the formation of mixed-oxide phases, the structural and the energetic factors are often modified. The resulting redox, catalytic and thermal properties of the composite oxides could be very different from those of pure oxides. Hence, the titania-zirconia mixed oxides not only take advantage of both TiO2 (active catalyst and support) and ZrO2 (acid–base properties), but also extend their application through the generation of new catalytic sites due to a strong interaction between them. In fact, the facile formation of zirconium titanate (ZrTiO4) compound between ZrO2 and TiO2 leads to excellent catalytic properties for various liquid phase as well as vapor phase reactions as elaborated elsewhere [50].
The significant features of TiO2-ZrO2 composite oxides include a high specific surface area, profound surface acid–base properties, a high thermal stability, and strong mechanical strength [50]. It is an established fact in the literature that active components dispersed on mixed metal oxides often produce superior catalysts to the one supported on single oxides for a number of reactions [58]. It is well established from modern catalytic surface science studies that the nature and quality of the carrier material is a key part of the catalyst. Defined properties and consistent quality of the support material are a prerequisite for a successful industrial catalyst. Although TiO2-ZrO2 binary oxides have been employed for various purposes in different domains, there was no attempt on the utilization of them for the ODH of EB. Therefore, these composite oxides and their derived combinations were profitably employed by our group for the title reaction based on their redox and acid–base bi-functional characteristics.
5 TiO2-ZrO2 Composite Oxides
For dehydrogenation of EB with CO2, the acidic properties of carbon dioxide necessitate the choice of a catalyst with basic properties for its initial adsorption and subsequent reaction. On the other hand, the catalytic system should be capable of activating EB with specific acidic sites. Therefore, an ideal catalyst system should possess both acid–base characteristics together with redox properties. On those lines, the TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide combination was thought to be a most suitable system for this reaction and investigated systematically. In this study, the TiO2-ZrO2 composite oxides with various amounts of TiO2 ranging from 10 to 90 mole% were prepared by adopting a co-precipitation method from zirconyl(IV) nitrate hydrate and titanium(IV) chloride precursors by hydrolysis with aqueous ammonia solution at pH = 7–8 [16]. The resulting precipitates were calcined at 550 °C for 6 h after oven drying at 120 °C for 12 h. For the purpose of comparison, pure individual oxides (TiO2 and ZrO2) were also synthesized under identical conditions. Activity tests were conducted in a fixed-bed down flow micro-reactor under normal atmospheric pressure. Gaseous and liquid products were analyzed simultaneously by on-line GC equipped with TCD and FID. Among the liquid products analyzed, styrene was the major product and benzene, toluene, benzaldehyde and acetophenone were the minor/trace products. Typical gaseous products analyzed include hydrogen, methane, CO and CO2.
The XRD and BET surface area measurements of these samples revealed very interesting information. As presented in Table 1, the TiO2 and ZrO2 individual oxides obtained under identical preparation conditions exhibited much lower specific surface areas than the titania-zirconia mixed oxides. With the addition of TiO2 to ZrO2, a sharp increase in the surface area has been observed and reached to a maximum of 130 m2 g−1 at 40% TiO2, and remained almost constant up to 60% TiO2. Further increase in TiO2 content showed a decrease in the surface area. The bulk densities of these mixed oxides (Table 1) revealed that they are lighter than the individual oxides indicating porous nature of the mixed oxides in conformity with the observed high surface areas [16]. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1, the XRD pattern of pure ZrO2 revealed a monoclinic phase and the pure TiO2 is in the anatase form, whereas the mixed oxides (40–60%) are found to be in X-ray amorphous state. Very interestingly, the pure ZrO2 obtained under identical preparation conditions stabilized in the monoclinic form whereas in 10–20% TiO2 containing samples it is in the tetragonal form. Further increase of TiO2 (30%) content in the TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides revealed the presence of highly crystalline TiO2-anatase phase whose intensity increased with increasing TiO2 content. Very interestingly, the 40–60% TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides were in the X-ray amorphous state. The 1:1 mole ratio mixed oxides and close to that composition are mostly in amorphous form due to the facile formation of TiZrO4 compound when calcined at around 500 °C [50]. The crystallinity of this compound generally increases with increasing calcination temperature beyond 600 °C [59].

To understand the acid–base properties of these oxides, temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia and CO2 were undertaken. As shown in Fig. 2, the 50% TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide exhibits very interesting acid and base properties together. As can be noted from Fig. 2a, the NH3 TPD profiles reveal that the number of acid sites and their acid strength are in the order ZrO2 < TiO2 < TiO2-ZrO2. It is known that the amount of NH3 desorbed below 200 °C is a measure of weak acidic sites, 200–350 °C range corresponds to medium acidic sites, and above 350 °C represent strong acid sites [60]. The TPD profiles of TiO2 and ZrO2 are distributed over the temperature from 150 to 500 °C indicating that the acid strength is distributed from weak to strong uniformly. In the case of TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide, the NH3 TPD peak maximum is noted at 225 °C, and also it is distributed in a wide temperature range from 175 to 450 °C with a strong signal intensity. This is primarily due to generation of new acidic sites owing to mixing of TiO2 and ZrO2 as elaborated in a recent review [50]. As can be noted from Fig. 2b, similar to NH3 TPD profiles, the CO2 TPD profiles also demonstrate that the strength and number of basic sites of 50% TiO2-ZrO2 are much higher than that of its individual oxides. The temperature maxima for ZrO2, TiO2, and TiO2-ZrO2 are 140, 145, and 187 °C, respectively. The shift of peak maximum from lower to higher temperature is an indication of increase in the basic strength in the case of 50% TiO2-ZrO2 sample. The NH3 as well as CO2 TPD measurements revealed an enhancement in the number and strength of both acidic and basic sites of TiO2 and ZrO2 after mixing together.

The catalytic activity data of individual oxides and the 50% TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst obtained at different time intervals is shown in Table 2. As can be noted from this table, the TiO2-ZrO2 composite oxide exhibits exceptionally better conversion and product yield than the individual oxides under similar reaction conditions. Among various compositions, the 50% and 60% TiO2 containing TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides exhibited highest conversion and product selectivity. The formation of amorphous TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide, enhancement in the specific surface area, and an increase in the number and strength of acid–base sites are some of the reasons for the observed high catalytic activity and selectivity of these mixed oxides towards the conversion of EB to styrene than their constituent single oxides [16].

The time-on-stream measurements on the 50% TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 3, in the presence and absence of CO2 are also investigated which clearly indicated the potential role of CO2 in directing the product formation and catalyst stability. The conversion of EB and the styrene selectivity were slightly lower in the first 2 h of the reaction. This was mainly due to the presence of large number of OH groups initially on the surface of the catalyst and the competitive adsorption of EB and CO2. From third hour onwards an enhancement and significant difference in the EB conversion, styrene selectivity, and catalyst stability were noted between CO2 and N2 feed gases, suggesting that a simple dehydrogenation of EB is taking place in the absence of CO2 (Eq. 1); whereas in the presence of CO2 the RWGS reaction (Eq. 2) coupled with the simple dehydrogenation are taking place as shown in Eqs. 1 and 2.
$$ {\text{C}}_{6} {\text{H}}_{5} {\text{CH}}_{2}{-}{\text{CH}}_{3} \to {\text{C}}_{6} {\text{H}}_{5} {\text{CH}}{=}{\text{CH}}_{2} {\text{ }} + {\text{H}}_{2} \; \;{\text{(dehydrogenation)}} $$ (1)
$$ {\text{H}}_{2} + {\text{CO}}_{2} \to {\text{CO}} + {\text{H}}_{2}{\text{O}}\; \; {\text{(RWGS)}} $$ (2)
As pointed out by Cavani and Trifiro [22], the oxidation of hydrogen by CO2 shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium to achieve higher yields by increasing the conversion as well as selectivity. In a recent study Sun et al. [61] also explained clearly the role of CO2 by coupling the RWGS reaction with the EB dehydrogenation. Also several authors emphasized the mechanism of EB dehydrogenation to styrene in the presence of CO2 in which redox sites operate either with single step pathway (Eq. 3) or dual step pathway as envisaged earlier (Eqs. 3 and 4) [5, 9, 26, 29, 40].
$$ {\text{C}}_{6} {\text{H}}_{5} {\text{CH}}_{2}{-}{\text{CH}}_{3} + {\text{CO}}_{2} \to {\text{C}}_{6} {\text{H}}_{5} {\text{CH}}{=}{\text{CH}}_{2} + {\text{H}}_{2} {\text{O}} $$ (3)
$$ {\text{C}}_{{\text{6}}} {\text{H}}_{{\text{5}}} {\text{CH}}_{{\text{2}}}{-}{\text{CH}}_{{\text{3}}} \to {\text{C}}_{{\text{6}}} {\text{H}}_{{\text{5}}} {\text{CH}}{=}{\text{CH}}_{{\text{2}}} + {\text{H}}_{{\text{2}}} $$ (4)
The TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide is also superior in terms of styrene selectivity which could be due to catalytic active site compatibility. The commonly observed by-products such as benzene and toluene produced by cracking and hydrogenolysis (Eqs. 5 and 6), respectively were minimal even at high temperatures suggesting that the catalytic sites responsible for these reactions might be different from those of simple EB dehydrogenation.
$$ {\text{C}}_{{\text{6}}} {\text{H}}_{{\text{5}}} {\text{CH}}_{{\text{2}}}{-}{\text{CH}}_{{\text{3}}} \to {\text{C}}_{{\text{6}}} {\text{H}}_{{\text{6}}} + {\text{C}}_{{\text{2}}} {\text{H}}_{{\text{4}}} \; \;{\text{(cracking)}} $$ (5)
$$ {\text{C}}_{{\text{6}}} {\text{H}}_{{\text{5}}} {\text{CH}}_{{\text{2}}}{-}{\text{CH}}_{{\text{3}}} + {\text{ H}}_{{\text{2}}} \to {\text{C}}_{{\text{6}}} {\text{H}}_{{\text{5}}} {\text{CH}}_{{\text{3}}} + {\text{ CH}}_{{\text{4}}}\; \; {\text{(hydrogenolysis)}} $$ (6)
The dehydrogenation of EB over 50% TiO2-ZrO2 at different reaction temperatures was also investigated. The catalytic activity at 400 °C was almost negligible, whereas at 500 °C it attained a considerable conversion level (17%), thereafter a significant increase was observed. At normal industrial operating temperature (about 650 °C), the conversion was about 57% and in particular, selectivity towards styrene (96%) was remarkable at this higher temperature. It is quite common that as the reaction temperature increases the conversion increases whereas the selectivity decreases. Sugino et al. [26] observed that as the conversion of EB increases with increase in temperature, both selectivity and yield of styrene decreased drastically over active carbon supported lithium promoted iron catalyst. Similar observation was put forwarded by Ohishi et al. [38], over chromia supported MCM-41 catalyst, in which increasing the temperature up to 600 °C, EB conversion gradually decreased and further increase of reaction temperature showed a clear decrease in the styrene monomer and increase in benzene formation significantly. Interestingly, the TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst exhibited an increase of conversion with increasing reaction temperature without foregoing selectivity of styrene. The uniqueness of the TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst is that it maintained a higher selectivity even at higher conversions, and reasonably quite stable in the time-on-stream experiments. Only a marginal decrease in the conversion was noted in the time-on-stream experiments with CO2 as the oxidant due to coke formation. It is a normally expected phenomenon.

5.1 Effect of Potassium Oxide Promoter
It is known that more acidic catalysts generally favor cracking of hydrocarbons facilitating formation of more unwanted side products and coke which subsequently leads to catalyst deactivation. As elaborated earlier, the TiO2-ZrO2 composite oxides exhibit both acidic and basic characteristics. Therefore, it was thought that by altering the acid–base properties of TiO2-ZrO2 composite oxides their activity and selectivity could be further improved. In particular, selectivity can be enhanced by complete suppression of the by-products by neutralizing the strong acidic sites of TiO2-ZrO2 by basic oxide like K2O. Therefore, a systematic study was undertaken to investigate the influence of K2O on the acid–base and catalytic properties of TiO2-ZrO2 [17]. In this study various amounts of K2O (1–4 wt.%) were impregnated over a specific composition of the TiO2-ZrO2 (60:40 mole ratio) which exhibited a better conversion and styrene product selectivity. These preparations were achieved by adopting a wet impregnation method by using potassium carbonate as the precursor. After impregnation, the promoted catalysts were oven dried at 120 °C for 12 h and calcined at 550 °C for 6 h.
There was some decrease in the specific surface area of TiO2-ZrO2 (135 m2 g−1) after impregnating with various amounts of K2O. The 1 wt.% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst exhibited a specific surface area of 118 m2 g−1 and the 4% catalyst showed 89 m2 g−1. The 2% and 3% catalysts exhibited in between. A decrease in the surface area is normally expected due to penetration of the dispersed K2O into the pores of the TiO2-ZrO2 and blocking some of the micropores. The XRD patterns of K2O promoted samples are presented in Fig. 4. Although the TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide was in the amorphous form, its K2O promoted samples exhibited crystalline behavior with the presence of TiO2-anatase phase. Due to K2O addition, the TiO2-anatase phase separation has been clearly observed. This is mainly due to the crystallization of the excess TiO2 under the influence of K2O. It is known from the literature that basic oxides like K2O promote the crystallization and stabilization of TiO2-anatase form [57]. The NH3 TPD results revealed, as shown in Fig. 5, that in the case of 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst only weak to moderate acidic sites are present. As described earlier the TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst exhibited weak to moderate acidic sites and high in number, but the strong acidic sites are comparable to TiO2 and ZrO2. As reported by some other groups [62, 63], at small loadings of K2O strong acid sites get poisoned, with the increase in K2O loading simultaneously both moderate and weak acidic sites are neutralized.

The influence of K2O on the catalytic activity of TiO2-ZrO2 can be understood from Fig. 6. As presented in this figure, the K2O promoter shows a substantial positive influence on the conversion of EB. Very interestingly, the unpromoted TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst exhibited higher conversion than the promoted catalyst in the first 2 h of reaction. However, after 2 h of time-on-stream a marginal decrease is observed due to coke formation. On the other hand, the K2O promoted catalysts showed a continuous increase with increasing reaction time up to 7 h of time-on-stream. The maximum conversion on K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 at 550 °C was 57.4%, but the TiO2-ZrO2 alone showed 47.9% conversion. A 10% enhancement in the conversion of EB over TiO2-ZrO2 has been achieved by doping with K2O promoter. A similar promotional influence on the selectivity is also noted as shown in Fig. 7. To compare the real influence of CO2 over N2, the K2O promoted and unpromoted TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts were investigated for their conversion and selectivity under identical reaction conditions and the observed results are presented in Fig. 7. The conversion of EB over TiO2-ZrO2 in N2 atmosphere was 52% which increased to 60.6% in the presence of CO2. Correspondingly, the selectivity of styrene was also increased from 94.5% to 97.1%. Interestingly, the conversion of EB over 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 has increased dramatically to 72% and the selectivity to 99.6%. As can be noted from Fig. 7, the conversion and selectivity over K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 in the presence of N2 also increased with respect to unpromoted catalyst due to the influence of the promoter. The higher selectivity of styrene over K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst could be explained due to two reasons. The first one is owing to suppression of the dealkylation products by neutralizing the strong acidic sites of the TiO2-ZrO2 by an optimum amount of K2O as evidenced by NH3 TPD measurements. The second reason could be that the hydrogen produced in the simple dehydrogenation is converting into water by the coupling of the RWGS reaction as described earlier. Hence, there is less scope for the hydrogenolysis and its subsequent reactions, consequently the selectivity of styrene increased remarkably. These comparative studies revealed that the K2O promoted catalyst is much superior to the unpromoted TiO2-ZrO2 [17].

5.2 Effect of Boron Oxide Promoter
As pointed out earlier, the dehydrogenation of EB to styrene in the presence of CO2 proceeds effectively on acid–base bi-functional catalysts with a balanced strength and number of acidic and basic sites. The B2O3/TiO2-ZrO2 system was selected as part of our effort to investigate the influence of acidic and basic sites of the TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts on the conversion and product selectivity of EB. In this study various amounts of B2O3 (2.5–15 wt.%) were impregnated over a specific composition of TiO2-ZrO2 (60:40 mole ratio) mixed oxide that was investigated after doping with K2O. For this purpose, on the calcined TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide various amounts of B2O3 were impregnated by using boric acid as the precursor [18]. The impregnated samples were calcined at 550 °C for 6 h after oven drying at 120 °C for 12 h.
As expected, the specific surface area of the TiO2-ZrO2 decreased after impregnating with B2O3 due to penetration of the promoter molecules into the pores of the support. The XRD patterns revealed an interesting information. As described earlier, the TiO2-ZrO2 was in an amorphous state when calcined at 550 °C. As can be noted from Fig. 8, the B2O3 impregnated catalysts reveal the presence of crystalline titania-anatase phase and the intensity of which increased with increasing the concentration of B2O3. Apparently, the added B2O3 also influences the crystallization and stabilization of the TiO2-anatase form. As revealed by NH3 TPD described earlier, when K2O was added to TiO2-ZrO2 both acidic strength and number of acid sites have been decreased. On the contrary, the addition of B2O3 increased both acidic strength and number of acid sites. As elaborated earlier, the promotional effect of K2O on the TiO2-ZrO2 is clearly reflected in their enhanced activity and selectivity. In particular, from the selectivity point of view the 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst was much superior to the TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst. The 5% B2O3/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst did not exhibit good conversion and selectivity in comparison to TiO2-ZrO2 and K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts. Benzene and toluene were the two major side products observed over B2O3/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts containing various amounts of B2O3. As pointed out by Wang et al. [62] from their systematic study that the formation of toluene and benzene are mainly due to the influence of strong acid–base centers on the surface of the catalysts. Strong basic sites can abstract the β–H of the adsorbed EB which facilitate the cleavage of side chain C–C bond resulting in the formation of toluene (Eq. 6), whereas the strong acid centers abstract α–H of EB and facilitate the cleavage of phenyl-C bond resulting in the production of benzene (Eq. 5).

On the TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst, the formation of toluene was not significant which is an indication that there are no strong basic sites compatible for participation in the hydrogenolysis reaction to produce toluene and methane. However, the formation of benzene was more significant along with ethylene (Eq. 5). The produced ethylene could be converted into coke by pyrolytic mechanism as reported by Vissers et al. [64]. Due to the formation of benzene over TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst, the selectivity to styrene was slightly reduced. However, in the case of K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst deactivation was prolonged due to less coke deposition. Also the benzene formation was almost negligible over the K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst due to neutralization of the acidic sites. As mentioned earlier, an acid–base bi-functional mechanism was proposed by several authors for the dehydrogenation of EB [5]. Accordingly, EB will be activated by the acidic sites, wherein, α–H of EB attacks the acid site of the catalyst, simultaneously β–H attacks the basic site followed by the stabilization of partial positive charge on α–C transition state of the aromatic ring, subsequently, the catalytic cycle gets completed by the desorption of styrene and hydrogen from the activated complex. Contrarily, in the beginning, CO2 will be activated by the basic sites of the catalysts, wherein the basic sites of TiO2-ZrO2 might be participating in the dissociative chemisorption of CO2 followed by the generation of oxygen ion (O2−) and subsequent transformation into H2O and simultaneous desorption of CO from the catalyst surface and regenerate the basic sites on the surface of the catalyst. The B2O3 addition decreased both the conversion and selectivity substantially.
At this point, it is clear that certain amount of acidic and basic sites are compulsory for either simple dehydrogenation or oxidative dehydrogenation of EB with CO2 and also there should be a balance between acidic and basic sites number and strength. The exact number and strength of acidic and basic sites are still a matter of further investigation.
6 The MnO2-ZrO2 Composite Oxides
Another interesting mixed oxide system that we have investigated was MnO2-ZrO2. As mentioned earlier, the ZrO2 facilitates the activation of CO2 based on its crystallographic phases and acid–base characteristics [65, 66]. The MnO2 is known to exhibit redox properties and also contributes to the enhancement of acid–base properties [67]. Therefore, the MnO2-ZrO2 combination was selected for thorough investigation [19]. The MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides containing 5–50 mole% MnO2 were synthesized from zirconyl(IV) nitrate and manganese(IV) nitrate precursors by hydrolysis with aqueous ammonia solution. The synthesized precipitates were washed thoroughly until free from anion impurities, oven dried at 120 °C for 12 h and calcined at 550 °C for 6 h.
These mixed oxides were also found to exhibit interesting specific surface areas in comparison to their parent single oxides (Table 3). Here again the specific surface areas of the MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides are more than that of the individual oxides and increased with increasing the content of MnO2. As shown in Table 2, the bulk densities of these mixed oxides revealed that they are lighter than the individual oxides indicating porous nature [19]. Specific surface areas of the mixed oxides are higher because of their porous nature. As presented in Fig. 9, the X-ray powder diffraction patterns revealed that they are in poorly crystalline form exhibiting amorphous nature. On the contrary the corresponding single oxides are in well crystalline form. The NH3 and CO2 TPD measurements also revealed that the individual oxides possessed fewer acidic as well as basic sites than the 10% MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide (Fig. 10). As mentioned earlier, mixing of two dissimilar oxides facilitates synergistic effects leading to the enhanced acid–base properties [50].

The influence of mixing is also reflected in their catalytic activity as shown in Fig. 11. As can be noted from this figure, the 10% MnO2-ZrO2 composite oxide catalyst exhibits superior activity than its individual oxides. Not only activity, a better selectivity was also noted over the 10% MnO2-ZrO2 catalyst. The combination of redox properties together with the acid–base characteristics could be responsible for the observed high activity of the MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst. The influence of MnO2 and ZrO2 composition on the catalytic activity was also investigated and these studies revealed that almost all compositions exhibit better activity and selectivity than the individual oxides. In particular, the 10% MnO2-ZrO2 catalyst showed better performance than higher MnO2 containing catalysts giving an impression that contribution of ZrO2 surface is also necessary for the effective activation of CO2. The catalytic activities of various MnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides calcined at different temperatures from 550 to 850 °C were also investigated to understand the influence of calcination temperature on the catalytic activity. The 550 °C calcined sample exhibited better conversion and product selectivity. The catalytic activity was observed to decease with increasing calcination temperature. A change from amorphous to crystalline compounds formation was noted from XRD analysis of these samples calcined at higher temperatures. The decrease in the activity at higher calcination temperatures could be due to the formation of catalytically inert crystalline compounds and a decrease in the specific surface area of the samples. It is an established fact in the literature [47, 49].

The influence of contact time on the conversion of EB was also systematically investigated. The data were collected by varying the weight of the catalyst and keeping the flow rates of CO2 and EB at a constant molar ratio of 10.2. At 8.37 g h/mole contact time, the EB conversion was 46.8% and increased to 72.8% at 16.73 g h/mole contact time. On further increase in the contact time to 33.46, only a marginal increase in the conversion, 78.2%, was noted. The influence of CO2 concentration on the EB conversion was also investigated by varying the feed composition of CO2 and EB. The conversion of EB in the absence of CO2 at 650 °C was 64.3%, which increased to 72.8% when N2 (N2/EB = 10.2) was replaced with CO2 (CO2/EB = 10.2) in the feed. The increase in the conversion of EB was observed with increase in the amount of CO2 in the feed up to a CO2/EB ratio of 10.2 and decreased beyond it. These studies gave an impression that an optimum concentration of CO2 at the surface of the catalyst is necessary to obtain a high activity and good stability owing to competitive adsorption of CO2 and EB on the catalyst surface. It was realized that the 10% MnO2-ZrO2 catalyst exhibited optimum activity and stability at the CO2/EB ratio of 10.2 due to an adequate balance of adsorption and activation of CO2 and EB. Thus best results were obtained over 10% MnO2-ZrO2 catalyst at 650 °C with an EB conversion of 73% and a styrene product selectivity of 98%.
7 CeO2-ZrO2 and CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 Composite Oxides
Cerium oxide is widely employed as catalytically active component in several catalyst formulations including three-way catalysts (TWC) for simultaneous oxidation of CO and hydrocarbons, and reduction of NO x [68, 69]. Introduction of transition and rare earth metal oxides into the CeO2 lattice increases the overall performance of cerium oxide containing catalysts by enhancing catalytic, textural, redox, and oxygen storage properties [70]. The CeO2 has a close packed cubic arrangement of metal atoms in which all the tetrahedral holes are filled by oxygen. Mixed oxides of CeO2 with ZrO2 deserve particular attention, because the substitution affects the redox properties of CeO2 and allows the formation of a wide variety of crystal structures that can influence catalytic behavior [68, 71]. In this study, CeO2-ZrO2 and CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 catalysts besides with their constituent single oxides were investigated systematically [20]. The CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide (25% CeO2 and 75% ZrO2) along with their CeO2 and ZrO2 single oxides were prepared by coprecipitation and precipitation methods respectively using aqueous ammonia as the hydrolyzing agent. To make the CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 sample, the SBA-15 was synthesized first as per the established procedures in the literature and impregnated with 25 wt.% CeO2-ZrO2. All the synthesized samples were calcined at 550 °C for 6 h after oven drying at 120 °C for 12 h [20].
As presented in Table 4, the BET surface area of CeO2-ZrO2 is more than that of CeO2 and ZrO2 samples. As expected, the CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 sample exhibited less specific surface area than the SBA-15 support alone. This is a good indication for better dispersion of the impregnated mixed oxides over the surface of the support. As pointed out earlier, the specific surface area of SBA-15 has decreased due to penetration of the dispersed CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide into the pores of the support. The pore size distribution measurements of these samples also revealed the same fact. As shown in Fig. 12, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of SBA-15 and CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 samples revealed type IV nature with H1 hysteresis loops implying the mesoporous nature of the samples. In particular, the adsorption branch of isotherm pertaining to CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 exhibited a sharp inflection at a relative pressure of 0.68 of the parent SBA-15. This is a characteristic feature of capillary condensation within the uniform pores [72]. The hysteresis loop of the CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 sample exhibited deformation from the original loop and the decrease in the pore volume is mainly due to the formation of clustered layers of CeO2-ZrO2 phase in the internal pore surface or partial blockage of the pores [73].

The XRD patterns of various samples are presented in Fig. 13. The XRD patterns of CeO2 and ZrO2 revealed typical patterns of cubic ceria and monoclinic phase of ZrO2, respectively. The XRD patterns of CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide revealed the formation of ceria-zirconia solid solution with tetragonal symmetry [20]. Due to a facile reaction between ceria and zirconia leading to the formation of solid solution between them, no lines due to tetragonal or monoclinic forms of ZrO2 were observed [70]. Further, no XRD lines pertaining to any of the crystalline compounds were observed in the case of CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 sample indicating that no crystalline phase of the mixed oxide is formed or agglomerated over the surface of the SBA-15 support. The low angle XRD patterns of SBA-15 and CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 samples revealed that the SBA-15 structure was mostly remained intact after impregnating with Ce-Zr-oxides. However, there was a decline in the structural ordering.

The catalytic activity of CeO2-ZrO2 and CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 samples were compared with the pure CeO2 and ZrO2 oxides in terms of turn over frequency (TOF) for the purpose of better comparison. The TOF has been defined as the number of moles of EB converted into products per second per mole of the active phase based on the catalyst composition and weight. The TOF has been calculated assuming that all active oxides are in 4+ oxidation state. The TOF estimations are shown in Table 5. These results reveled that CeO2 and ZrO2 oxides exhibit almost similar activity, but the CeO2-ZrO2 combination shows better activity and the CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 presents superior activity. As can be observed from Table 5, the positive effect of SBA-15 support, wherein, the turn over frequency of CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 catalyst enhanced to more than 10 times in comparison to its bulk oxides. The better activity of CeO2-ZrO2 in comparison to their counter part oxides is due to the obvious reasons of mixing together which leads to the formation of fine particles or amorphous mixtures with high specific surface area and enhanced acid–base and redox properties. The best performance of CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 catalyst could be explained due to a better dispersion of the active CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide phase on the high surface area SBA-15 support. Due to a high dispersion of the active phase on the support, accessibility of the active sites for the adsorption and subsequent reaction of the reactants increases to a significant level. Apart from this, the kinetic diffusion limitations are also eliminated due to larger pore size of the SBA-15 support. Also the metal oxide and support oxide interaction could be anticipated leading to synergistic effects. Another interesting observation to be noted from Table 5 is that the catalytic activity of CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 is maintained up to 10 h of time-on-stream in comparison to other bulk oxide catalysts. The sustained activity of CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 catalyst is mainly due to the avoidance of sintering of the active phase over the SBA-15 support. Another probable reason could be that a reduction in the acidic sites of the catalyst that are mainly responsible for cracking of EB into carbonaceous deposits.

The effect of CeO2-ZrO2 content on the SBA-15 support was also systematically investigated. The conversion of EB has been increased from 42 to 56.8% with increase in CeO2-ZrO2 loading from 15 to 25 wt.% on the SBA-15 support. The enhancement in the conversion of EB is due to an increase in the number of active sites up on increasing the loading of CeO2-ZrO2 on the SBA-15 support. The conversion of EB has not been increased with further increase of CeO2-ZrO2 loading beyond 25 wt.%. It is expected since the loading beyond 25% could facilitate formation of agglomerated CeO2-ZrO2 particles. However, the selectivity is marginally increased from 93.2% to 95.9% with the increase of CeO2-ZrO2 loading from 15 to 40 wt.%.
The effect of reaction temperature on the EB conversion and selectivity over CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 was also investigated at different temperatures from 450 to 650 °C. As presented in Fig. 14, the EB conversion at 450 °C is below 21%, which has increased to around 65% with an increase in the reaction temperature from 450 to 650 °C. The increase of EB conversion from 21% to 65% with an increase in the reaction temperature from 450 to 650 °C is remarkable. The styrene selectivity at 450 °C is 97%, which has decreased marginally with an increase in reaction temperature from 450 to 600 °C. The styrene selectivity is approximately 93% at 650 °C. The noticeable decrease in the selectivity at 650 °C is mainly due to cracking of EB into benzene, toluene, and CO2.

In order to investigate the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of EB over the CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 catalyst, two additional experiments were also conducted under identical reaction conditions, one with CO2 and another with N2. The EB conversion and styrene selectivity were higher when the reaction was conducted in the presence of CO2 than in its absence. As described earlier, the significance of which can be realized that the energy required for the production of one ton styrene in the presence and absence of the CO2 is 6.3 × 108 and 1.5 × 109 cal, respectively [24]. The activity and selectivity results over CeO2-ZrO2/SBA catalyst also reveals clearly that mesoporous silica SBA-15 material is another promising support for the development of highly active and selective metal oxide catalysts.
8 Concluding Remarks
The ZrO2-based composite oxide catalysts are highly active, selective, and stable in the dehydrogenation of EB to styrene in the presence of CO2. The catalytic activity of the investigated ZrO2-based mixed oxide catalysts is almost two orders of magnitude than their corresponding individual single oxides. Also the catalytic activity of the mixed oxides is superior in the presence of CO2 than its absence. In particular, the conversion of EB increased with increasing reaction temperature without foregoing much selectivity of the styrene product. The acid–base characteristics of the mixed oxides could be fine tuned by incorporating the appropriate acid–base promoters to enhance the conversion and product selectivity further. The catalytic results indicate conclusively that the ZrO2-based mixed oxide catalysts are highly suitable for CO2 coupled processes. In particular, this study establishes clearly that there is a sequential advantage from simple bulk metal oxides to mixed metal oxides followed by supporting mixed metal oxides in the oxidative dehydrogenation of EB to styrene utilizing CO2. With regard to future directions, there is still more room for further improvement of the catalyst systems for EB dehydrogenation with CO2. According to Towler and Lynn calculations [74], at 600 °C with a CO2/EB ratio of 5:1, equilibrium conversion of EB could be shifted to as high as 95% whereas, in the absence of CO2, equilibrium conversion is 67%, similar to the conversions obtained industrially for the steam EB ODH. We are currently focusing our efforts on improving further the catalyst activities, which, although generally higher than previously observed, are lower than the predicted levels. Further broadening of the scope, perhaps as a result of increased research activity, would correspondingly enhance the practical utility of this technology very soon.
