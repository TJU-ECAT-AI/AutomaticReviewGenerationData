Abstract
Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene (ST) in the presence of carbon dioxide was investigated over a series of alumina-supported
vanadia catalysts (VOx/Al2O3) with the vanadium loading of 0.40–3.00 mmol/g Al2O3. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, H2-TPR, TGA,
UV-Raman and UV–vis spectroscopy. The catalytic behaviour as well as the structure of VOx species on alumina depends strongly on the vanadium
loading. Catalytic activity increases ﬁrstly with increasing the vanadium loading and the STyield reaches a maximum value of 69.7% at a vanadium
loading of 1.50 mmol/g Al2O3, and then the activity decreases with a further increase in the vanadium loading. This may be related to the fraction of
VOx exposed on the domain surfaces and the reducibility of the surface VOx species. The catalysts with different vanadium loadings are also
different in the deactivation mechanism. The deactivation of VOx/Al2O3 with vanadium loading below 1.50 mmol/g Al2O3 is mainly ascribed to
coke deposition, while the deep reduction of V5+ species becomes an important factor in the deactivation of catalyst with higher vanadium loading.
EB dehydrogenation over VOx/Al2O3 in the presence of carbon dioxide exhibits higher ST yield than that in the presence of an inert nitrogen
atmosphere. Such a result can be attributed to the facts that carbon dioxide as a weak oxidant can eliminate hydrogen produced during EB
dehydrogenation, regain the oxidation state (lattice oxygen) of reduced vanadium species and alleviate the catalyst deactivation.

1. Introduction
Styrene (ST) is commercially produced by the dehydro-
genation of ethylbenzene (EB) on the promoted iron oxide
catalysts at 600–700 8C, just below the temperature where
thermal cracking becomes signiﬁcant. Due to its highly
endothermic and volume-increasing character, a large amount
of superheated steam is used to supply heat, lower the partial
pressure
of
the
reactant,
and
avoid
the
formation
of
carbonaceous deposits. However, much of the latent heat of
steam is lost in the gas–liquid separator [1].
The dehydrogenation of EB to ST in the presence of CO2
instead of steam is believed to be an energy-saving and
environmentally friendly process. It is estimated that the energy
required for producing 1 t of ST in the new process using CO2 is
(1.5–1.9)  108 cal, much lower compared with 1.5  109 cal
needed in the current commercial process [2,3].
Because the commercial Fe–Cr–K catalysts do not work
effectively for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, the
catalysts have been screened extensively [1–26]. Fe, V, Cr or Ce
oxides supported on activated carbon (AC) [4–9], V oxide
supported on MgO [10], hydrotalcite-like compounds (Mg–Al–
Fe, Mg–Al–V) [11–14], and Fe oxide supported on ZrO2 [15,16]
exhibited high initial catalytic activity for EB dehydrogenation
under CO2, but suffered from severe deactivation even during
several hours operation. Comparatively, Fe, V and Na oxides
supported on Al2O3 [2,17–26] were much more stable and
showed reasonable activity values. For example, the initial yield
of STover Fe and V supported on AC reached 60% but decreased
rapidly to 25% in the ﬁrst 6 h [9], while V supported on Al2O3
still maintained a reasonable activity even after the reaction
lasted for 70 h [25,26]. These results suggest that alumina-
supported vanadia (VOx/Al2O3) may be a promising catalyst for
EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. However, the

catalytic behaviour, the deactivation mechanism as well as the
structure and properties of VOx species on alumina surface for
VOx/Al2O3 with different vanadium loadings are still unclear.
Such vagueness may restrain us from further improving the
activity and stability of the catalyst VOx/Al2O3.
The objective of this work is to determine the structure and
properties of VOx species, catalytic behaviour and deactivation
mechanisms of VOx/Al2O3 for EB dehydrogenation in the
presence of CO2. The VOx/Al2O3 catalysts with a large range of
vanadium loading (0.40–3.00 mmol/g Al2O3) were prepared and
characterized. We then investigated the effects of vanadium
loading on the structure of VOx species, the relationship between
the structure and the catalytic activity, the function of CO2 in the
reaction coupling as well as the causes of catalyst deactivation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
g-Al2O3 (obtained from Institute of Coal Chemistry, Chinese
Academy of Science) with a BET area of 275 m2/g, a pore
volume of 0.70 cm3/g and an average pore aperture of 10 nm was
used as the catalyst support. The support was ﬁrst crushed and
sieved to 20–40 mesh, and then activated at 500 8C in air for 2 h
before use. The catalyst VOx/Al2O3 was prepared through the
incipient wetness impregnation of the support with NH4VO3
dissolvedinanaqueoussolutionofoxalicacid.Theimpregnation
treatment lasted for 24 h, and then the catalysts were dried at
120 8C in air for 4 h and further calcined at 550 8C in air for 4 h.
2.2. Reaction and analytical procedures
The catalytic tests were performed in a stainless steel tube
reactor with Ø6.0 mm i.d., in which about 300 mg of the
catalyst was loaded per run. Before each test, the catalyst was
ﬁrst activated under a nitrogen ﬂow from room temperature to
the reaction temperature 550 8C, and then the nitrogen ﬂow was
switched to CO2. The catalyst was maintained at this
temperature for 15 min before introducing EB (5.44 mmol-
EB/(g-cat h)) by a micro feeder pump. The molar ratio of CO2
to EB was ﬁxed at 20 and the W/F was controlled at 8.75 g-
cat h/mol (i.e. 184 g-cat h/mol-EB). The reaction was operated
at atmospheric pressure, and the efﬂuents, including product
ST, unreacted EB, and side products like benzene and toluene,
were condensed in a trap with an ice water bath.
The liquid products were analyzed with an FID gas
chromatograph
(Shimadzu
GC-7A)
equipped
with
a
3 mm  3 m stainless steel column packed with OV-101.
The gaseous efﬂuents (CO2, CO, H2, CH4 and C2H6) were
analyzed with a TCD gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-9A)
equipped with a 3 mm  3 m stainless steel column packed
with carbon molecular sieve.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
BET surface area of the catalysts was measured by nitrogen
adsorption at 77.4 K with ASAP2000 (Micromeritics Instru-
ment Co., USA). The samples were degassed at 200 8C and
6.7 Pa for 2 h prior to the measurement.
The crystal phase of VOx species loaded on alumina was
identiﬁed by XRD with a powder X-ray diffractometer
(Shimadzu 6100) with a monochromated Cu Ka (40 kV and
30 mA) radiation source. The measurements were made from
108 to 708 with a scanning rate of 48/min.
UV-Raman spectra were obtained on the apparatus T64000
(Dilor-Jobin Yvon-Spex) under ambient conditions. A 325 nm
He–Cd laser was used as the exciting source.
Diffuse reﬂectance UV–vis spectra were collected on UV-
2501 PC (Shimadzu) spectrophotometer in the range 200–
800 nm at room temperature.
H2-TPR was performed in a quartz micro reactor TP-5000
(Tianjin-Xianquan, China) connected with a mass spectrometer
(Omni Star 200), and about 50 mg sample was used in each
measurement. The catalyst sample was ﬁrst pretreated in air at
300 8C for 1 h, followed by purging with nitrogen at the same
temperature
for
1 h
and
then
cooling
down
to
room
temperature. After that, the ﬂow of H2 (7%) diluted in nitrogen
(50 ml/min) was switched into the system, and the sample was
then heated up from room temperature to 800 8C at a ramp of
10 8C/min. The exhaust gases were detected and monitored
with a thermal conductivity detector and a mass spectrometer.
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on the
apparatus TGA92 (Setaram Co., France) under air within the
temperature range 20–600 8C at a heating rate of 10 8C/min.

3.1. Vanadium species on the alumina surface
A list of BET surface areas of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts with
different vanadium loadings are shown in Table 1. The surface
area decreases slightly with an increase in the vanadium loading
from 0 to 1.50 mmol/g Al2O3, and then decreases sharply with

a further increase in the vanadium loading. The decrease in the
surface area of VOx/Al2O3 with the introduction of vanadium at
a lower loading may be mainly ascribed to the decrease in the
fraction of alumina support. At higher loading, however, the
blocking of the micropores of the alumina support by the
superﬂuous amounts of VOx may cause the sharp decrease in
the catalyst surface area.
The XRD patterns of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in
Fig. 1. No diffraction lines corresponding to the vanadium
compounds were detected in the samples with the vanadium
loading below 1.50 mmol/g Al2O3, suggesting that VOx species
are highly dispersed on the alumina surface. However, V2O5
diffraction lines appeared in the samples with the vanadium
loading above 2.00 mmol/g Al2O3, indicating the formation of
bulk vanadia at high vanadium loading. No evidence of AlV3O9
was detected in any of the samples, suggesting that the reaction
between VOx and Al2O3 is negligible during the treatment at
550 8C.
UV resonance Raman spectroscopy has recently proved to
be another powerful technique to identify the structure of
isolated transition metal anchored on the surface of metal
oxides [27–30]. It is useful to characterize the structures of VOx
species supported on metal oxides or molecular sieves
[27,28,30]. The intensity of the Raman signal will be
selectively enhanced by several orders of magnitude when
the excitation laser line is close to the electronic transition
absorption of the samples [29]. As shown in Fig. 2, the Raman
bands observed for VOx/Al2O3 at 345, 510, 832 and 930 cm1
are assigned to the bending, symmetric stretching and
asymmetric stretching of the V–O–V bond and the symmetric
stretching of O–V–O for polymeric vanadia species, respec-
tively; the band at 974 cm1 is ascribed to the V O stretching
in the polyvanadate structures [27,30–33]. The band at
994 cm1 is one of the typical bands of V2O5 crystallites in
the bulk. The Raman bands of VOx/Al2O3 are broad under
ambient conditions, which may be due to the overlap of the
band for the hydrated monomer with those assigned to the
polyvanadate species [34].
The absence of the typical band at ca. 994 cm1 of V2O5 in
Fig. 2(a)–(c) implies that little crystalline V2O5 is formed in
VOx/Al2O3
samples
with
the
vanadium
loading
below
1.5 mmol/g Al2O3. This suggests that the vanadium species
are highly dispersed on the surface in this range of vanadium
loading [30], which is consistent with the absence of crystalline
structures in the XRD patterns. For the sample with a vanadium
loading of 2.0 mmol/g Al2O3, the Raman band at ca. 974 cm1
becomes very weak, while a shoulder band at ca. 994 cm1 is
observed, suggesting the existence of crystalline V2O5 at higher
vanadium loading.
The absorption edge energy in the UV–vis spectra of VOx/
Al2O3 varies with the vanadium loading, as shown in Fig. 3.
These data were determined by using Tauc’s law, an expression
that describes the near-edge region in amorphous semicon-
ductor and in crystalline semiconductor with indirect band gap
transitions [31]. As revealed by the characterization of the size
of VOx [31], MoOx [35,36] and WOx [37] domains dispersed in
the solid catalysts, the absorption edge energy decreases with

an increase in the domain size. The absorption edge energy here
decreases
with
an
increase
in
the
vanadium
loading,
approaching the typical value of large V2O5 crystallites; this
suggests that the size of VOx domains increases with increasing
the vanadium loading. With the vanadium loading below
1.5 mmol/g Al2O3, vanadium species are ﬁnely dispersed and
the size of V2O5 crystallites is too small to be detected by XRD.
At higher vanadium loading, the increase in the size of VOx
domains is signiﬁcant, as evidenced by the XRD characteriza-
tion.
To
investigate
the
reducibility
of
vanadium
species
deposited on the support, we obtained the H2-TPR proﬁles
of VOx/Al2O3 samples with different vanadium loadings
(Fig. 4). Only a single reduction peak in the range 500–
520 8C is observed on VOx/Al2O3 with the vanadium loading
below 1.50 mmol/g Al2O3. At higher vanadium loading, this
reduction peak shifts to 530–550 8C and another reduction peak
emerges at about 625 8C. The peak at lower temperature is
attributed to the reduction of dispersed surface vanadium
species [30,38], while the peak at about 625 8C should be
ascribed to the reduction of polymeric V2O5-like V5+ species.
Thus, the present H2-TPR results further conﬁrm that the highly
dispersed vanadium species on the alumina surface are formed
as the vanadium loading is below 1.50 mmol/g Al2O3.
As shown in Fig. 4, the peak temperature decreases with an
increase in the vanadium loading from 0.40 to 1.50 mmol/
g Al2O3 and then increases with further increasing the
vanadium loading. Larger VOx domains may be favorable
for the reduction of vanadium species, but the formation of bulk
V2O5 at high vanadium loading will retard the reduction. The
sample at a vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3 exhibits the
highest reducibility due to the ﬁne dispersity and proper VOx
domain size.
3.2. Catalytic activity and role of carbon dioxide in EB
dehydrogenation
3.2.1. Effects of vanadium loading on the catalytic activity
Catalytic results of VOx/Al2O3 for EB dehydrogenation both
in the presence of CO2 and in an inert atmosphere of N2 at
550 8C are listed for comparison in Table 2. The catalytic
behaviour of VOx/Al2O3 depends strongly on the vanadium
loading. Both pure Al2O3 support and bulk V2O5 exhibit poor
activity for EB dehydrogenation in comparison with VOx/
Al2O3. With the introduction of vanadium on Al2O3, the
catalytic activity and ST yield were enhanced remarkably. As
also shown in Fig. 5, the catalytic activity increases ﬁrstly with
the vanadium loading and the ST yield reaches a maximum
value of 69.7% in the presence of CO2 at a vanadium loading of
1.50 mmol/g Al2O3, and then the activity decreases with a
further increase in the vanadium loading.
The apparent turn over frequency (TOF), the number of EB
molecules converted per VOx unit in 1 h, decreases with the
increase in vanadium loading (Table 2). This suggests that the
fraction of surface vanadium species accessible to the reactants
decreases with increasing the vanadium loading due to the
formation of polyvanadate and multilayer vanadia.
It was considered that, for EB dehydrogenation in the
presence of CO2, the activation of EB molecule through the
dissociation of C–H bond involves the incipient reduction of
metal cations with the formation of oxygen vacancies
[4,9,10,23,25], and the catalytic activity is related to the

catalyst reducibility [39]. As shown in the TPR proﬁles (Fig. 4),
the catalytic activity of VOx/Al2O3 exhibits the same trend as
the reducibility with the change in the vanadium loading. The
catalyst at a vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3 exhibits
the highest activity as well as the reducibility, which may be
ascribed to the highly dispersed vanadium species with proper
VOx domain size and negligible amounts of bulk V2O5 clusters.
At a lower vanadium loading, the active sites are too few; at a
higher vanadium loading, the formation of bulk V2O5 crystallites
may result in the loss of accessibility and reducibility of active
VOx sites.
3.2.2. Role of carbon dioxide in EB dehydrogenation
As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 5, ST selectivity in the presence
of CO2 is a little higher than that in the presence of N2, although it
isgenerallyhigher than95%forall catalytictestsexceptthatover
pure Al2O3 support, with small amounts of toluene and benzene
as by-products. ST yield in the presence of CO2 is always quite
high in comparison with that in the presence of N2, which proves
the promoting effect of CO2 on the EB dehydrogenation over
VOx/Al2O3 and the superiority of the reaction coupling over the
single dehydrogenation in an inert atmosphere. In the presence of
CO2, the equilibrium conversion can be improved through the
reaction coupling of EB dehydrogenation with the reverse water-
gas shift (RWGS) [40], which provides the thermodynamic
driving force to achieve higher EB conversion; VOx/Al2O3 as
catalystmay promotetheactivationofEB and/or CO2 and realize
the reaction coupling.
VOx/Al2O3 exhibited very low activity for the RWGS;
however, the EB conversion is associated with the conversion of
CO2 and there exists a close relation between EB dehydrogena-
tion and CO2 hydrogenation [26]. To understand the effect of
CO2 on the catalyst, we conducted a series of H2-TPR tests on
the fresh calcined catalyst, on the catalyst reduced after the ﬁrst
step of TPR, on the reduced catalyst retreated with pure CO2
gas ﬂow, and on the spent catalysts after EB dehydrogenation in
different atmospheres, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, an
intense peak was observed at around 500 8C in H2-TPR proﬁle
of the freshly calcined VOx/Al2O3, which is attributed to the
reduction of dispersed tetrahedral vanadium species [30,38].
No H2 consumption was observed during the second H2-TPR of
reduced sample, suggesting that the reduction of reducible
vanadium species was completed in the ﬁrst TPR. After the
treatment of the reduced sample with CO2, the reduction peak
reappeared in the third H2-TPR proﬁle; the consumption of H2
during the third TPR accounts for about 70% of that in the ﬁrst
TPR. In the H2-TPR proﬁles of the spent catalysts after EB
dehydrogenation, two reduction peaks were observed, at about
540 and 640 8C. However, the reduction peaks of the sample
after reaction in the presence of N2 are smaller than those in the
presence of CO2. These clearly suggest that CO2 as a weak
oxidant can regain the oxidation state (lattice oxygen) of the
reduced vanadium species and the vanadium species can be
maintained at a higher oxidation state during the reaction.
Therefore, it can be supposed that EB dehydrogenation over
VOx/Al2O3 occurred at the redox sites on the surface vanadium
species. The active lattice oxygen activates EB molecules
through abstracting hydrogen; this process forms the reduced
surface vanadium species and releases H2O. CO2 can regain the
oxidation state of reduced vanadium species and then promote
the EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. Here CO2 is
mainly activated at the redox sites on the surface vanadium
species, then dissociates into CO and surface oxygen. The
elimination of hydrogen produced during EB dehydrogenation
with the surface oxygen through the reaction coupling can shift
the reaction to the product side, especially for the reaction at
high EB conversion.
3.3. Catalyst deactivation
One of the major problems that restrain the process of EB
dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 from being practical is

the rapid deactivation of catalyst. As shown in Table 2 and
Fig. 5, the STyield as well as the catalytic activity decrease with
the time on stream. Moreover, VOx/Al2O3 catalysts with
various vanadium loadings and under different atmospheres are
also different in the extent of deactivation, expressed here as the
quantity of ST yield decreased in 20 h operation (Qyd20) due to
the catalyst deactivation.
3.3.1. Effects of vanadium loading on the catalyst
deactivation
As shown in Table 2, the deactivation of VOx/Al2O3 for EB
dehydrogenation is distinctly inﬂuenced by the vanadium
loading. When the vanadium loading is below 1.50 mmol/
g Al2O3, the value Qyd20 increases only slightly with the
vanadium loading; however, the catalytic activity as well as the
ST production during the 20 h reaction (PST20) are enhanced
signiﬁcantly by the increase in vanadium loading. When the
vanadium loading exceeds 1.50 mmol/g Al2O3, Qyd20 increases
sharply with the vanadium loading, accompanied with a severe
decrease in the catalytic activity and the quantity of PST20.
These results suggest that, at low vanadium loading, the activity
of VOx/Al2O3 is relatively stable for EB dehydrogenation and
the catalyst deactivation is related to the quantities of ST
produced or EB consumed during the reaction. However, the
catalysts
VOx/Al2O3
with
a
vanadium
loading
above
1.50 mmol/g Al2O3 suffer from severe deactivation.
To search for the causes of catalyst deactivation, we
characterized the spent catalysts after reaction on stream for
20 h by XRD, TGA and H2-TPR. As listed in Table 1, the
quantities of coke deposited on VOx/Al2O3 are not consistent
with the extent of catalyst deactivation. The largest amounts of
coke deposit on VOx/Al2O3 with a vanadium loading of
1.50 mmol/g Al2O3 that exhibits the highest catalytic activity.
On the contrary, the catalyst with high vanadium loading
deactivates severely during the reaction, but the coke deposition
was not so severe. These indicate that the coke formation is far
from the only cause of catalyst deactivation, although it results
in a decrease in the speciﬁc surface area of the catalyst.
As revealed by H2-TPR of the spent catalysts with a low
vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3), large amounts of the
vanadium species remain in the oxidation state after the
reaction lasts for 20 h in the presence of CO2 (Fig. 6). Little
crystalline vanadium species is observed in the spent VOx/
Al2O3 with a vanadium loading below 1.50 mmol/g Al2O3,
which suggests that the surface vanadium species is still highly
dispersed in VOx/Al2O3. However, at higher vanadium loading,
V2O3 together with V2O5 crystallites appear in the spent VOx/
Al2O3, and the surface vanadium species at the initial high
oxidation state is reduced and cannot be regained considerably
by CO2 during the reaction.
All these suggest that the causes of catalyst deactivation vary
with the vanadium loading. With low vanadium loading
(1.50 mmol/g Al2O3), the moderately stable activity of VOx/
Al2O3fortheEBdehydrogenationisattributedtotheexistenceof
renewable surface vanadium species at high valence; a major
reason for the catalyst deactivation is the coke deposition. With
high vanadium loading (>1.50 mmol/g Al2O3), on the other
hand, the deep reduction of the surface vanadium species
contributes signiﬁcantly to the severe deactivation of VOx/Al2O3
forthe EBdehydrogenation; thecoke formation isreduced dueto
thelow catalyticactivity andlow EB consumption, though itmay
remain one cause of the catalyst deactivation.
3.3.2. About the coke deposition
Mamedov and Corberan [41] reported that one of the main
roles of CO2 in the catalytic dehydrogenation process is the
removal of the deposited coke. Nakagawa et al. [42,43] thought
that the acidic sites are the active sites for the dehydrogenation
of ethane in the presence of CO2 over Ga2O3/TiO2, so CO2 may
promote rapid desorption of products from the surface of the
catalyst and then suppress coke formation. However, in this
work, the amounts of coke deposited on all catalysts in the
presence of CO2 are larger than those in the presence of N2
(Table 1), especially on the catalysts with low vanadium
loading, which is not consistent with the extent of catalyst
deactivation (Table 2).
As shown in Fig. 7, the quantity of coke deposition is
actually related to the catalyst activity and EB consumption
(CEB20); the larger the amounts of EB consumed (converted to
ST or by-products), the more coke deposited. There exists a
roughly linear relation between the coke content and CEB20,
regardless of the variances in the vanadium loading or the
reaction atmosphere. At a low vanadium loading (<1.50 mmol/
g Al2O3), Qyd20 in the presence of CO2 is less than that in the
presence of N2 (Table 2). This indicates that CO2 can alleviate
the catalyst deactivation, although it is not able to suppress the
coke formation. At a high vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/
g Al2O3), on the contrary, Qyd20 is much greater for EB
dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 than in the presence of
N2; so CO2 can neither suppress the coke deposition nor
alleviate the catalyst deactivation.
Coke deposition contributes to the catalyst deactivation;
however, it seems that the catalyst deactivation due to the coke
deposition cannot be alleviated by CO2. Sakurai et al. [10,44]
also observed similar phenomena: coke formation on the

tion in 20 h under different atmospheres over VOx/Al2O3 with various vanadium
loadings.
catalyst increased in the presence of CO2 more than in the
presence of Ar for EB dehydrogenation over V2O5/MgO. EB
dehydrogenation with CO2 over V2O5/MgO seems to be via the
redox mechanism, i.e., CO2 behaves as an oxidant and retains
the surface vanadium species at an oxidation state during the
reaction. Takehira et al. [45] obtained similar results for the
dehydrogenation of propane in CO2 on Cr-MCM-41 catalysts.
3.3.3. Function of carbon dioxide on alleviating the
catalyst deactivation
As addressed above, both the deep reduction of the surface
vanadium species and the coke deposition contribute to the
deactivation of VOx/Al2O3 for EB dehydrogenation. Coke
deposition is directly related to the EB consumption or ST
production and cannot be effectively suppressed by CO2;
therefore, this portion of catalyst deactivation due to coke
deposition cannot be alleviated by CO2.
Deep reduction of the surface vanadium species is another
cause of the catalyst deactivation, which is actually associated
with the vanadium loading and the reaction atmosphere. The
catalyst VOx/Al2O3 with a low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/
g Al2O3) includes highly dispersed surface vanadium species
with proper redox properties; for EB dehydrogenation in the
presence of CO2, CO2 as a weak oxidant can regain the oxidation
state (lattice oxygen) of the reduced vanadium species and then
alleviate this portion of catalyst deactivation due to the deep
reduction of the surface vanadium species. As the vanadium
loading exceeds 1.50 mmol/g Al2O3, CO2 cannot regain the
oxidation state of the reduced vanadium species effectively, so a
severe deactivation of catalyst (large Qyd20 value, as shown in
Table 2) was obtained.
For EB dehydrogenation in the presence of N2, the
deactivation of VOx/Al2O3 does not exhibit such a sharp
variance with the vanadium loading, because an inert atmo-
sphere cannot prompt the resumption of the oxidation state of
the vanadium species regardless of the vanadium loading.
Moreover, EB conversion in the presence of N2 remains at a
relatively low level all the time in comparison with that in the
presence of CO2, which results in less coke deposition.
It should be noted that the catalyst deactivation may also
come from the sintering of active sites or from the loss of active
components due to the existence of water or operation at high
temperature. However, there are few ﬁndings to prove the
signiﬁcance of such causes in catalyst deactivation, because
water here is only produced from RWGS and its content in the
stream is very low (<5 vol.%) compared with the conventional
process with large quantity of superheated steam as the diluent.
The operation temperature is also lowered for EB dehydro-
genation in the presence of CO2. Moreover, such facts are also
less relevant to the investigation of effects of CO2 and
vanadium loading on catalytic activity and stability, and
therefore are of less concern in the current work.
4. Conclusions
The catalytic behaviour of VOx/Al2O3 for EB dehydrogena-
tion in the presence of CO2 depends strongly on the vanadium
loading. VOx/Al2O3 at a vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/
g Al2O3 exhibits the highest activity as well as reducibility,
which may be ascribed to the highly dispersed vanadium
species with proper VOx domain size and nonsigniﬁcant
formation of bulk V2O5 clusters.
VOx/Al2O3 exhibits higher activity for EB dehydrogenation
in the presence of CO2 than that in the presence of an inert
atmosphere. This result can be attributed to the facts that CO2
can eliminate hydrogen produced during EB dehydrogenation,
regain the oxidation state (lattice oxygen) of reduced vanadium
species and alleviate the catalyst deactivation.
Both the deep reduction of the surface vanadium species and
the coke deposition contribute to the catalyst deactivation. Coke
deposition is directly related to the EB consumption or ST
production and cannot be effectively suppressed by CO2, while
deep reduction of the surface vanadium species is associated
with the vanadium loading and reaction atmosphere.
In the presence of CO2, the deactivation of VOx/Al2O3 with
low vanadium
loading
(1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) is mainly
ascribed to the coke deposition, while the portion of
deactivation due to the deep reduction of the surface vanadium
species can be alleviated by CO2 through regaining the
oxidation state of the reduced vanadium species. However, for
the catalysts with higher vanadium loading (>1.50 mmol/
g Al2O3) or reactions in the presence of an inert atmosphere, the
deep reduction of vanadium species becomes an important
factor in the catalyst deactivation.
