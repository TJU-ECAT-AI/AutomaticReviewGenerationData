<p>It is known that more acidic catalysts generally favor cracking of hydrocarbons facilitating formation of more unwanted side products and coke which subsequently leads to catalyst deactivation. As elaborated earlier, the TiO2-ZrO2 composite oxides exhibit both acidic and basic characteristics. Therefore, it was thought that by altering the acidbase properties of TiO2-ZrO2 composite oxides their activity and selectivity could be further improved.</p>
<p>Very interestingly, the unpromoted TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst exhibited higher conversion than the promoted catalyst in the first 2 h of reaction. However, after 2 h of time-on-stream a marginal decrease is observed due to coke formation. On the other hand, the K2O promoted catalysts showed a continuous increase with increasing reaction time up to 7 h of time-on-stream.</p>
<p>The influence of K2O on the catalytic activity of TiO2-ZrO2 can be understood from Fig. 6. As presented in this figure, the K2O promoter shows a substantial positive influence on the conversion of EB. Very interestingly, the unpromoted TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst exhibited higher conversion than the promoted catalyst in the first 2 h of reaction. However, after 2 h of time-on-stream a marginal decrease is observed due to coke formation. On the other hand, the K2O promoted catalysts showed a continuous increase with increasing reaction time up to 7 h of time-on-stream. The maximum conversion on K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 at 550 C was 57.4%, but the TiO2-ZrO2 alone showed 47.9% conversion. A 10% enhancement in the conversion of EB over TiO2-ZrO2 has been achieved by doping with K2O promoter.</p>
<p>As can be noted from Fig. 7, the conversion and selectivity over K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 in the presence of N2 also increased with respect to unpromoted catalyst due to the influence of the promoter. The higher selectivity of styrene over K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst could be explained due to suppression of the dealkylation products by neutralizing the strong acidic sites of the TiO2-ZrO2 by an optimum amount of K2O as evidenced by NH3 TPD measurements.</p>
<p>The influence of contact time on the conversion of EB was also systematically investigated. The data were collected by varying the weight of the catalyst and keeping the flow rates of CO2 and EB at a constant molar ratio of 10.2. At 8.37 g h/mole contact time, the EB conversion was 46.8% and increased to 72.8% at 16.73 g h/mole contact time. On further increase in the contact time to 33.46, only a marginal increase in the conversion, 78.2%, was noted.</p>
<p>The effect of CeO2-ZrO2 content on the SBA-15 support was also systematically investigated. The conversion of EB has been increased from 42 to 56.8% with increase in CeO2-ZrO2 loading from 15 to 25 wt.% on the SBA-15 support. The enhancement in the conversion of EB is due to an increase in the number of active sites up on increasing the loading of CeO2-ZrO2 on the SBA-15 support.</p>
<p>In order to investigate the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of EB over the CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 catalyst, two additional experiments were also conducted under identical reaction conditions, one with CO2 and another with N2. The EB conversion and styrene selectivity were higher when the reaction was conducted in the presence of CO2 than in its absence.</p>
<p>The catalytic results indicate conclusively that the ZrO2-based mixed oxide catalysts are highly suitable for CO2 coupled processes. In particular, this study establishes clearly that there is a sequential advantage from simple bulk metal oxides to mixed metal oxides followed by supporting mixed metal oxides in the oxidative dehydrogenation of EB to styrene utilizing CO2.</p>
