<p>It is known that more acidic catalysts generally favor cracking of hydrocarbons facilitating formation of more unwanted side products and coke which subsequently leads to catalyst deactivation. As elaborated earlier, the TiO2-ZrO2 composite oxides exhibit both acidic and basic characteristics. Therefore, it was thought that by altering the acidbase properties of TiO2-ZrO2 composite oxides their activity and selectivity could be further improved.</p>
<p>Very interestingly, the unpromoted TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst exhibited higher conversion than the promoted catalyst in the first 2 h of reaction. However, after 2 h of time-on-stream a marginal decrease is observed due to coke formation. On the other hand, the K2O promoted catalysts showed a continuous increase with increasing reaction time up to 7 h of time-on-stream.</p>
<p>The influence of K2O on the catalytic activity of TiO2-ZrO2 can be understood from Fig. 6. As presented in this figure, the K2O promoter shows a substantial positive influence on the conversion of EB. Very interestingly, the unpromoted TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst exhibited higher conversion than the promoted catalyst in the first 2 h of reaction. However, after 2 h of time-on-stream a marginal decrease is observed due to coke formation. On the other hand, the K2O promoted catalysts showed a continuous increase with increasing reaction time up to 7 h of time-on-stream. The maximum conversion on K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 at 550 C was 57.4%, but the TiO2-ZrO2 alone showed 47.9% conversion. A 10% enhancement in the conversion of EB over TiO2-ZrO2 has been achieved by doping with K2O promoter.</p>
<p>As can be noted from Fig. 7, the conversion and selectivity over K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 in the presence of N2 also increased with respect to unpromoted catalyst due to the influence of the promoter. The higher selectivity of styrene over K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst could be explained due to suppression of the dealkylation products by neutralizing the strong acidic sites of the TiO2-ZrO2 by an optimum amount of K2O as evidenced by NH3 TPD measurements.</p>
<p>The influence of contact time on the conversion of EB was also systematically investigated. The data were collected by varying the weight of the catalyst and keeping the flow rates of CO2 and EB at a constant molar ratio of 10.2. At 8.37 g h/mole contact time, the EB conversion was 46.8% and increased to 72.8% at 16.73 g h/mole contact time. On further increase in the contact time to 33.46, only a marginal increase in the conversion, 78.2%, was noted.</p>
<p>The effect of CeO2-ZrO2 content on the SBA-15 support was also systematically investigated. The conversion of EB has been increased from 42 to 56.8% with increase in CeO2-ZrO2 loading from 15 to 25 wt.% on the SBA-15 support. The enhancement in the conversion of EB is due to an increase in the number of active sites up on increasing the loading of CeO2-ZrO2 on the SBA-15 support.</p>
<p>In order to investigate the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of EB over the CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 catalyst, two additional experiments were also conducted under identical reaction conditions, one with CO2 and another with N2. The EB conversion and styrene selectivity were higher when the reaction was conducted in the presence of CO2 than in its absence.</p>
<p>The catalytic results indicate conclusively that the ZrO2-based mixed oxide catalysts are highly suitable for CO2 coupled processes. In particular, this study establishes clearly that there is a sequential advantage from simple bulk metal oxides to mixed metal oxides followed by supporting mixed metal oxides in the oxidative dehydrogenation of EB to styrene utilizing CO2.</p>

<p>Significance of CO2 as a soft oxidant has also been recognized by various other research groups by employing in different reactions. Several prominent features of CO2 have also been pointed out which include, for example, CO2 accelerates the reaction rate [42], enhances the selectivity [43], alleviates the chemical equilibrium [24], suppresses the unwanted total oxidation products [27], prevents the hot spots on the catalyst surface [44], and poisons the nonselective sites of the catalysts [42]. By considering all these unique features, the CO2 could be coined as a soft oxidant for utilization in the oxidative conversion of EB to styrene [5].</p>
<p>To date, several research groups have also tried to generalize the function and the role of CO2 as an oxidant for catalytic conversion of various hydrocarbons including EB to styrene [5, 2640, 45, 46]. It has also been realized that oxygen species of CO2 is useful for oxidative conversion of various hydrocarbons and reforming of CH4 [710].</p>
<p>The significant features of TiO2-ZrO2 composite oxides include a high specific surface area, profound surface acidbase properties, a high thermal stability, and strong mechanical strength [50].</p>

<p>It is an established fact in the literature that mixing two dissimilar oxides adds another parameter since they are liable to form new stable compounds, which can lead to totally different physicochemical properties and the catalytic behavior.</p>
<p>The ZrO2-based composite oxide catalysts are highly active, selective, and stable in the dehydrogenation of EB to styrene in the presence of CO2. The catalytic activity of the investigated ZrO2-based mixed oxide catalysts is almost two orders of magnitude than their corresponding individual single oxides. Also the catalytic activity of the mixed oxides is superior in the presence of CO2 than its absence.</p>
<p>In particular, the conversion of EB increased with increasing reaction temperature without foregoing much selectivity of the styrene product. The acidbase characteristics of the mixed oxides could be fine tuned by incorporating the appropriate acidbase promoters to enhance the conversion and product selectivity further.</p>
<p>Further broadening of the scope, perhaps as a result of increased research activity, would correspondingly enhance the practical utility of this technology very soon.</p>

1. The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the precise role of dopants and vacancies in modulating the electronic properties of the catalysts, predicting their reactivity accurately, and ensuring that the optimized catalysts meet safety standards while achieving high efficiency and selectivity. Further research could potentially overcome these challenges by developing advanced computational models and experimental techniques that allow for detailed insights into the catalyst behavior under various conditions.

2. The ZrO2-based composite oxide catalysts demonstrated exceptional activity, selectivity, and stability in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene in the presence of CO2. Compared to their individual oxide counterparts, the mixed oxides showed catalytic activities that were two orders of magnitude higher. The presence of CO2 led to an enhancement in the catalytic performance, and the conversion of EB increased with rising reaction temperatures without compromising the selectivity of styrene. The acid-base properties of the mixed oxides could be finely adjusted through the use of appropriate promoters to boost conversion and product selectivity.

3. Future advancements in catalyst systems for EB dehydrogenation with CO2 are anticipated to focus on enhancing catalyst activities beyond the current levels, which, though superior, are lower than predicted values. The integration of broader research efforts could accelerate the practical applicability of this technology by addressing the remaining gaps in catalyst performance and optimizing their efficiency, selectivity, and safety.
