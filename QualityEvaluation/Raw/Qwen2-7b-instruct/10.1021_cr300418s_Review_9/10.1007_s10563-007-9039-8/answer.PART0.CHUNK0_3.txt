<p>Significance of CO2 as a soft oxidant has also been recognized by various other research groups by employing in different reactions. Several prominent features of CO2 have also been pointed out which include, for example, CO2 accelerates the reaction rate [42], enhances the selectivity [43], alleviates the chemical equilibrium [24], suppresses the unwanted total oxidation products [27], prevents the hot spots on the catalyst surface [44], and poisons the nonselective sites of the catalysts [42]. By considering all these unique features, the CO2 could be coined as a soft oxidant for utilization in the oxidative conversion of EB to styrene [5].</p>
<p>To date, several research groups have also tried to generalize the function and the role of CO2 as an oxidant for catalytic conversion of various hydrocarbons including EB to styrene [5, 2640, 45, 46]. It has also been realized that oxygen species of CO2 is useful for oxidative conversion of various hydrocarbons and reforming of CH4 [710].</p>
<p>The significant features of TiO2-ZrO2 composite oxides include a high specific surface area, profound surface acidbase properties, a high thermal stability, and strong mechanical strength [50].</p>
<p>As presented in Table 1, the TiO2 and ZrO2 individual oxides obtained under identical preparation conditions exhibited much lower specific surface areas than the titania-zirconia mixed oxides.</p>
<p>The XRD and BET surface area measurements of these samples revealed very interesting information. As presented in Table 1, the TiO2 and ZrO2 individual oxides obtained under identical preparation conditions exhibited much lower specific surface areas than the titania-zirconia mixed oxides.</p>
<p>The 50% TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide exhibits very interesting acid and base properties together. As can be noted from Fig. 2a, the NH3 TPD profiles reveal that the number of acid sites and their acid strength are in the order ZrO2 < TiO2 < TiO2-ZrO2.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity data of individual oxides and the 50% TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst obtained at different time intervals is shown in Table 2. As can be noted from this table, the TiO2-ZrO2 composite oxide exhibits exceptionally better conversion and product yield than the individual oxides under similar reaction conditions.</p>
<p>The influence of mixing is also reflected in their catalytic activity as shown in Fig. 11. As can be noted from this figure, the 10% MnO2-ZrO2 composite oxide catalyst exhibits superior activity than its individual oxides.</p>
<p>The effect of CeO2-ZrO2 content on the SBA-15 support was also systematically investigated. The conversion of EB has been increased from 42 to 56.8% with increase in CeO2-ZrO2 loading from 15 to 25 wt.% on the SBA-15 support.</p>

The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant accelerates reaction rates, enhances selectivity, alleviates chemical equilibrium, suppresses unwanted oxidation products, prevents hotspots on the catalyst surface, and poisons nonselective sites of catalysts. The TiO2-ZrO2 composite oxides show high specific surface area, strong thermal stability, and mechanical strength. They exhibit better catalytic properties compared to individual TiO2 and ZrO2 oxides. The addition of promoters like potassium oxide and boron oxide to the TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts can improve activity and selectivity. The MnO2-ZrO2 composite oxides also show superior activity compared to their individual components. The CeO2-ZrO2 content on the SBA-15 support increases the conversion of ethylbenzene.

作为软氧化剂，二氧化碳可以加速反应速率、提高选择性、缓解化学平衡、抑制非期望的过氧化产物、防止催化剂表面热点，并毒化催化剂上的非选择性位点。TiO2-ZrO2复合氧化物显示出高比表面积、强热稳定性和机械强度。与单独的TiO2和ZrO2氧化物相比，它们表现出更好的催化性能。向TiO2-ZrO2催化剂中添加如钾氧化物和硼氧化物这样的促进剂可以改善活性和选择性。MnO2-ZrO2复合氧化物也显示出与单个成分相比更高的活性。CeO2-ZrO2在SBA-15支持上的含量增加提高了乙基苯的转化率。
