[1] "The ZrO2-based composite oxide catalysts are highly active, selective, and stable in the dehydrogenation of EB to styrene in the presence of CO2."
[2] "Among the liquid products analyzed, styrene was the major product and benzene, toluene, benzaldehyde and acetophenone were the minor/trace products."
[3] "Very interestingly, the 4060% TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides were in the X-ray amorphous state."
[4] "The TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide is also superior in terms of styrene selectivity which could be due to catalytic active site compatibility."
[5] "Interestingly, the TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst exhibited an increase of conversion with increasing reaction temperature without foregoing selectivity of styrene."
[6] "The BET surface area of CeO2-ZrO2 is more than that of CeO2 and ZrO2 samples."
[7] "The specific surface area of SBA-15 has decreased due to penetration of the dispersed CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide into the pores of the support."
[8] "The activity and selectivity results over CeO2-ZrO2/SBA catalyst also reveals clearly that mesoporous silica SBA-15 material is another promising support for the development of highly active and selective metal oxide catalysts."
