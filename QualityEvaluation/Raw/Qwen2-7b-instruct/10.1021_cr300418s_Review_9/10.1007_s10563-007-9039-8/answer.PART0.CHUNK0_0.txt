[1] "The ZrO2-based composite oxide catalysts are highly active, selective, and stable in the dehydrogenation of EB to styrene in the presence of CO2."
[2] "The utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant for the commercially important catalytic dehydrogenation of EB to styrene has received enormous attention recently due to its several attractive features."
[3] "Significantly, the TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst maintained a higher selectivity even at higher conversions, and reasonably quite stable in the time-on-stream experiments."
[4] "In particular, selectivity can be enhanced by complete suppression of the by-products by neutralizing the strong acidic sites of TiO2-ZrO2 by basic oxide like K2O."
[5] "The influence of K2O on the catalytic activity of TiO2-ZrO2 can be understood from Fig. 6."
[6] "The better activity of CeO2-ZrO2 in comparison to their counter part oxides is due to the obvious reasons of mixing together which leads to the formation of fine particles or amorphous mixtures with high specific surface area and enhanced acidbase and redox properties."
[7] "The catalytic activity of CeO2-ZrO2 and CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 samples were compared with the pure CeO2 and ZrO2 oxides in terms of turn over frequency (TOF) for the purpose of better comparison."
[8] "The catalytic results indicate conclusively that the ZrO2-based mixed oxide catalysts are highly suitable for CO2 coupled processes."

1. ZrO2-based composite oxide catalysts are highly effective in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2). They show high activity, selectivity, and stability in this process.
2. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant for the catalytic dehydrogenation of EB to styrene has gained significant interest due to CO2's advantageous characteristics.
3. Remarkably, the TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide catalyst maintained a high selectivity even at higher conversion rates, and demonstrated reasonable stability over extended operation periods.
4. By adding a basic oxide like potassium oxide (K2O) to TiO2-ZrO2, the strong acidic sites can be neutralized, thereby enhancing selectivity and reducing the formation of by-products.
5. The effect of potassium oxide (K2O) on the catalytic activity of TiO2-ZrO2 can be observed through changes in conversion rates and product yields over time.
6. The superior activity of the CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst compared to its individual oxides can be attributed to the formation of fine particles or amorphous mixtures with increased surface area and enhanced acid-base and redox properties.
7. The catalytic activity of CeO2-ZrO2 and CeO2-ZrO2/SBA-15 was assessed using turnover frequency (TOF) to compare their effectiveness against pure CeO2 and ZrO2 oxides.
8. The experimental results clearly confirm that ZrO2-based mixed oxide catalysts are highly suitable for processes involving CO2.
