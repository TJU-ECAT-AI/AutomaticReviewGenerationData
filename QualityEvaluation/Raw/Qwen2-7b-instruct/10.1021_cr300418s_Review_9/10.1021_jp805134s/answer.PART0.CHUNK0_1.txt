[1] "The DFT+U method was used to show that both oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption on ceria and doped ceria are surface reduction processes, and thus the reaction energy for methane oxidation correlates with surface reducibility."
[2] "Dissociative methane adsorption proceeds through H abstraction and the formation of a methyl radical transition state in which a metal atom of the surface is reduced by a single electron."
[3] "The incorporation of metals such as Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption."
[4] "Previous studies (13, 19-21) have illustrated the incorporation of Zr into the fluorite lattice of ceria, however we have neglected to consider the thermodynamic preference of Pd surface substitution, which will be addressed in future studies."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The electronic structure modifications lead to changes in the reactivity, selectivity, and efficiency of the catalysts. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure modifications, optimizing the catalyst design for desired performance metrics, and ensuring the safety of the catalytic systems. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety requires a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the ability to model complex interactions within the catalytic systems.
