[1] "Previous studies (13, 19-21) have illustrated the incorporation of Zr into the fluorite lattice of ceria, however we have neglected to consider the thermodynamic preference of Pd surface substitution, which will be addressed in future studies."
[2] "The incorporation of metals such as Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption."
[3] "The reducibility can be increased by the substitution of Zr or Pd into the CeO2 surface, which also lowers the energy barrier for dissociative methane adsorption."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of metals like Zr or Pd into the catalyst lattice can lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, which in turn reduces the reaction energy and barrier for substrate adsorption. This leads to enhanced reducibility and improved catalytic performance. However, the thermodynamic preference for Pd surface substitution is not fully considered in current studies and will be explored in future research. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems requires careful theoretical modeling and process optimization to ensure optimal performance.

在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成可以影响其电子结构和催化性能。将金属如Zr或Pd引入催化剂晶格中可以降低氧空位形成能，进而降低反应能和吸附底物的能垒，从而提高可还原性并改善催化性能。然而，目前的研究没有充分考虑钯表面替换的热力学偏好，并将在未来的研究中进行探讨。为了确保最佳性能，需要仔细地理论建模和过程优化来平衡这些催化系统的效率、选择性和安全性。
