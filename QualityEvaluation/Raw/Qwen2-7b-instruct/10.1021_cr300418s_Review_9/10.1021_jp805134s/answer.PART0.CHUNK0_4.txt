[1] "The DFT+U method was used to show that both oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption on ceria and doped ceria are surface reduction processes, and thus the reaction energy for methane oxidation correlates with surface reducibility."
[2] "The incorporation of metals such as Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the surface reducibility. Higher reducibility enables easier activation of substrates, leading to improved efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing these factors involve accurately predicting the electronic structure modifications due to doping and understanding how these changes impact the reaction pathways and energy barriers. Balancing the need for high reactivity with the risk of product selectivity loss and operational safety requires careful consideration of the dopant's effect on the catalyst's overall stability and activity.
