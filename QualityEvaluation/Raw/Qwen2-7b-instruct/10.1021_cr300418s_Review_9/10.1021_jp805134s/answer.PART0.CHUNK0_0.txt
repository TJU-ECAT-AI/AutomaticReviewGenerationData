[1] "The catalytic properties of CeO2 for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions have implications for a variety of applications."
[2] "For each of these applications, the use of ceria is motivated by its ability to store and release oxygen, or more generally to readily transition between oxidation states."
[3] "Ceria exhibits activity for the oxidation of hydrocarbons, (3-10) making it suitable for catalytic combustion applications and as anode electrocatalysts for direct hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs)."
[4] "The addition of low levels of rare-earth or noble metals alters the redox properties (11-13) and hydrocarbon oxidation activity (5, 7, 9) of ceria-based materials."
[5] "The redox properties of ceria-based materials have been probed using experimental (12-21) and theoretical (22-30) methods, however the correlation between redox properties and hydrocarbon oxidation activity with changes in composition is unclear."
[6] "Herein, we use density functional theory, with the inclusion of an on-site Coulombic interaction (DFT+U), to examine the energetics of dissociative methane adsorption and oxygen vacancy formation over ceria surfaces with the addition of Zr or Pd."
[7] "These results provide insight into the relationship between composition, surface reduction and catalytic activity of ceria-based materials."
[8] "Additionally, the known substitution of Zr into Ce positions in the fluorite lattice provides a useful contrast with Pd-substituted systems studied herein."
[9] "For Pd supported on ceria, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results indicate that surface reduction can occur at temperatures as low as 423 K, as compared to 623 K for pure ceria."
[10] "The mechanism by which Pd alters the catalytic activity and reducibility of ceria is not well understood."
[11] "While the reduction properties of the Pd/CeO2 system have been less extensively investigated than those of ZrO2CeO2, unique interactions between Pd and CeO2 at the metalmetal oxide interface have been observed."
[12] "High resolution electron microscopy (HREM) images show evidence of alloying between Pd and Ce species at the Pd/CeO2 interface after reduction at temperatures exceeding 1173 K."
[13] "Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data, Xiao et al. propose that palladium oxide (PdOx) species may form at the PdCeO2 interface."
[14] "Experimental studies have demonstrated the effects on catalytic performance and redox properties of the addition of Pd to ceria, however the mechanism responsible for these effects merits further theoretical investigation."

The document discusses the catalytic properties of ceria for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, focusing on its ability to store and release oxygen and transition between oxidation states. Ceria is particularly active in hydrocarbon oxidation, making it suitable for catalytic combustion and anode electrocatalysts in solid oxide fuel cells. The introduction of rare-earth or noble metals affects the redox properties and hydrocarbon oxidation activity of ceria-based materials. Density functional theory (DFT+U) is employed to examine the energetics of methane adsorption and oxygen vacancy formation over ceria surfaces with Zr or Pd substitutions. This provides insights into the relationship between material composition, surface reduction, and catalytic activity. Palladium, in particular, can reduce at lower temperatures than pure ceria, suggesting it alters the catalytic activity and reducibility of ceria. The mechanism behind these effects requires further theoretical investigation.

文档讨论了氧化反应中氧化铈的催化性质，重点是其存储和释放氧的能力以及在不同氧化状态之间的转换能力。氧化铈在烃类氧化中表现出活性，使其适用于催化燃烧和固体氧化物燃料电池的阳极催化剂。引入稀土或贵金属会改变铈基材料的还原性和烃类氧化活性。采用密度泛函理论（DFT+U）来研究铈表面锌或钯掺杂对甲烷吸附和氧空位形成的影响能量。这为理解组成、表面还原性和催化活性之间的关系提供了见解。钯在比纯氧化铈更低的温度下可以还原，表明它改变了氧化铈的催化活性和可还原性。这些效应背后的机制需要进一步的理论研究。
