[1] "The DFT+U method was used to show that both oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption on ceria and doped ceria are surface reduction processes, and thus the reaction energy for methane oxidation correlates with surface reducibility."
[2] "The incorporation of metals such as Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption."
[3] "Previous studies (13, 19-21) have illustrated the incorporation of Zr into the fluorite lattice of ceria, however we have neglected to consider the thermodynamic preference of Pd surface substitution, which will be addressed in future studies."
[4] "This study illustrates the correlation between surface reducibility and catalytic activity for methane oxidation on CeO2-based materials. Calculated reaction energies suggest that a fully oxidized surface will provide enhanced activity for methane activation."

1. The DFT+U method indicates that both oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption on ceria and doped ceria involve surface reduction processes, implying that the energy for methane oxidation is related to the surface's reducibility.

2. Incorporating metals like Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface reduces the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, along with lowering the energy barrier for methane adsorption.

3. Studies have shown the addition of Zr into the ceria lattice, but the thermodynamic preference for Pd surface substitution was not considered. Future research will address this aspect.

4. This study highlights the link between surface reducibility and the catalytic activity of methane oxidation on ceria-based materials. Fully oxidized surfaces are predicted to enhance methane activation.

1. 使用DFT+U方法表明，Ceria及其掺杂体系中的氧空位形成和甲烷吸附都是表面还原过程，因此甲烷氧化的能量与表面的可还原性相关。

2. 将Zr或Pd等金属引入Ceria晶格中能降低氧空位形成能量，同时降低甲烷吸附的能量壁垒。

3. 已有研究表明将Zr引入Ceria晶格，但Pd表面替换的热力学偏好未被考虑。未来的研究将探讨这一方面。

4. 本研究揭示了表面可还原性与基于Ceria材料的甲烷氧化催化活性之间的联系。完全氧化的表面被认为能够增强甲烷活化。
