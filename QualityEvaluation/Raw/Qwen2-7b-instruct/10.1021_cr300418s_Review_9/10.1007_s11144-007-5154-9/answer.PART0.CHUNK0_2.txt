<p>Smectites intercalated with metal oxide pillars and additionally modified with transition metals have been found to be active catalysts of the selective reduction of NO with ammonia.</p>
<p>Significantly more thermally stable microporous materials can be obtained by the replacement of smectites for micas.</p>
<p>The pillaring solution was prepared by a slow addition of 0.1 M NaOH into AlCl3 solution under constant stirring until the molar ratio of OH/Al reached 2.4.</p>
<p>The transition metal loadings were determined by electron microprobe analysis performed on a JEOL JCXA 733 superprobe.</p>
<p>The modified phlogophites were tested as catalysts of the selective reduction of NO with ammonia.</p>
<p>The Al2O3-pillared phlogophite unmodified with transition metals (P-NA-OA-Al) has shown activity only at temperature above 350C.</p>
<p>A significant increase in the catalytic activity of the phlogophite samples was observed after the deposition of transition metals.</p>
<p>In our previous studies performed for other types of Cu- and Fe-containing catalysts, the opposite activity order had been found.</p>
<p>The high selectivity to nitrogen, which did not drop below 94% in the whole temperature range studied, is a very important parameter of phlogophite based catalysts.</p>

The document discusses the preparation and use of phlogophite materials as catalysts in the DeNOx process. The materials are modified through intercalation with alumina pillars, followed by treatment with acids to reduce the charge of the clay layers. Transition metals, specifically iron and copper, are then deposited on the surface of the modified phlogophites via an ion-exchange method. The textural parameters and transition metal loading of the materials are determined through N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction, electron microprobe analysis, and UV-Vis-DR spectroscopy. The phlogophite-based catalysts are found to be active and selective in the DeNOx process, with the Fe-containing samples showing higher activity at lower temperatures compared to those modified with copper. The high selectivity to nitrogen is noted as a critical parameter for these catalysts.

本文讨论了使用天然磷灰石材料作为脱NOx过程的催化剂。这些材料通过与氧化铝支柱的插层进行修饰，然后通过酸处理减少粘土层的电荷。随后，铁和铜通过离子交换方法在修改后的磷灰石表面沉积。通过N2吸附、X射线衍射、电子探针分析和紫外可见-差分反射光谱确定了材料的物理化学参数。磷灰石基催化剂在脱NOx过程中表现出活性和选择性，其中含铁样品在较低温度下显示出比铜改性的样品更高的活性。氮的选择性被指出是这些催化剂的关键参数。
