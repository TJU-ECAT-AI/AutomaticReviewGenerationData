The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting their reactivity and selectivity. In the context of the provided literature, the intercalation of natural phlogophite with Al2O3 pillars resulted in a significant increase of its surface area and pore volume, enhancing its catalytic performance. The deposition of transition metals, such as copper and iron, on the surface of the modified phlogophites led to a decrease in these parameters, affecting the catalyst's activity. Specifically, the Fe-containing catalysts were found to operate effectively at lower temperatures compared to phlogophites modified with copper, due to a higher loading of iron and the presence of catalytically active oligomeric and bulky iron oxide species. However, the competitive ammonia oxidation by oxygen decreased the efficiency of the DeNOx process in the high temperature range.

Challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the precise mechanisms of metal adsorption, the formation of active sites, and the dynamics of the reaction pathways. Optimizing the dopant concentration and the pillaring process can improve the catalyst's stability and activity. Ensuring safety involves managing the handling of hazardous materials, monitoring the release of pollutants, and designing efficient waste management strategies. The literature highlights the importance of considering the textural parameters of the samples, as they strongly influence the catalytic performance of the phlogophite-based catalysts.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成影响它们在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能，从而影响其反应活性和选择性。根据提供的文献，在此背景下，通过将天然磷灰石与Al2O3层插入，显著增加了其表面积和微孔体积，从而提高了其催化性能。在表面沉积过渡金属（如铜和铁）导致这些参数的减少，影响催化剂的活性。具体而言，含铁催化剂在较低温度下表现出有效活性，与仅用铜修饰的磷灰石相比，这归因于较高的铁负载和催化活性的寡聚体和大型铁氧化物物种的存在。然而，在高温范围内，氨氧化氧的竞争性消耗降低了DeNOx过程的效率。

在理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的挑战包括理解金属吸附的确切机制、活性位点的形成及其反应路径的动力学。优化掺杂浓度和层插入过程可以提高催化剂的稳定性和活性。确保安全涉及管理危险材料的处理、监测污染物的释放以及设计有效的废物管理策略。文献强调了考虑样品的纹理参数的重要性，因为它们强烈影响基于磷灰石的催化剂的催化性能。
