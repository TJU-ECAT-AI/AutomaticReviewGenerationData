[1] "The pillared phlogophite samples were characterized with respect to structure (XRD), texture (BET), composition (EPMA), and chemical nature of the deposited transition metals species (UV-vis-DRS)."
[2] "The obtained samples were found to be active and selective catalysts of the DeNOx process."
[3] "A significant increase in the catalytic activity of the phlogophite samples was observed after the deposition of transition metals."
[4] "In our previous studies performed for other types of Cu- and Fe-containing catalysts, the opposite activity order had been found."
[5] "The high selectivity to nitrogen, which did not drop below 94% in the whole temperature range studied, is a very important parameter of phlogophite based catalysts."

The study discusses the preparation of phlogophite-based catalysts modified with aluminum oxide pillars and transition metals such as iron and copper. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurements, energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EPMA), and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis-DRS). The results indicate that the modified phlogophite samples are active and selective catalysts for the DeNOx process. The presence of transition metals leads to an increase in catalytic activity, particularly for iron-modified samples, which show better performance at lower temperatures compared to copper-modified samples. The high selectivity to nitrogen is another crucial feature of these catalysts.

本文研究了通过铝氧化物支柱和过渡金属（如铁和铜）改性的石绿石基催化剂的制备。通过X射线衍射（XRD）、布拉斯—埃姆特—泰勒（BET）比表面积测量、能量色散X射线分析（EPMA）和紫外可见漫反射光谱（UV-vis-DRS）对催化剂进行了表征。结果表明，改性后的石绿石样品是DeNOx过程的有效选择性催化剂。过渡金属的存在导致了催化活性的提高，特别是铁改性样品在较低温度下表现出更好的性能与铜改性样品相比。这些催化剂的高氮选择性是其另一个关键特性。
