[1] "The pillared phlogophite unmodified with transition metals (P-NA-OA-Al) has shown activity only at temperature above 350C. However, the NO conversion measured for this sample did not exceed 20% at temperatures below 500C."
[2] "A significant increase in the catalytic activity of the phlogophite samples was observed after the deposition of transition metals."
[3] "The Fe-containing catalysts (Fig. 4A) were active at lower temperatures than the phlogophites modified with copper (Fig. 4B)."
[4] "Moreover, iron is present mainly in the form of oligomeric and bulky oxide species, which are catalytically active in the low temperature DeNOx and also in the side reaction of ammonia oxidation by oxygen."
[5] "As was shown in Table 1, these samples were characterized by significantly higher surface area and porosity than the materials unmodified in this way."
[6] "Therefore,it seems that the textural parameters of the samples strongly influence their catalytic performance."
[7] "The high selectivity to nitrogen, which did not drop below 94% in the whole temperature range studied, is a very important parameter of phlogophite based catalysts."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms. The intercalation of phlogophite with Al2O3 pillars leads to a significant increase in surface area and pore volume, which enhances the accessibility of reactants and products, thus improving the catalytic performance. The deposition of transition metals on the surface of the modified phlogophites decreases the surface area and porosity, affecting the electronic structure and reactivity of the catalyst. Copper dopants are found in the form of isolated cations, oligomeric, and bulky copper oxide species, while iron dopants are predominantly in the form of oligomeric and bulky iron oxides. These differences in the distribution of transition metals influence the catalytic activity and selectivity of the catalysts. The textural parameters of the samples, including surface area and porosity, play a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance. High selectivity to nitrogen, maintaining over 94% across the studied temperature range, is a key parameter for the effectiveness of phlogophite-based catalysts. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems requires careful optimization of preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and understanding the effects of vacancy formation on the electronic structure and reactivity of the catalysts.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，准备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成通过多种机制影响氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能。将磷灰石与Al2O3层间填充物进行层间插入可以显著增加表面积和孔体积，从而提高反应物和产物的可接近性，进而改善催化剂性能。在修改的磷灰石表面上沉积过渡金属会降低表面面积和孔体积，从而影响催化剂的电子结构和活性。铜掺杂剂主要以孤立离子、寡聚体和大型铜氧化物物种的形式存在，而铁掺杂剂则主要以寡聚体和大型铁氧化物形式存在。这些不同分布的过渡金属对催化剂的活性和选择性产生影响。文本参数，包括表面积和孔体积，在确定催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。在整个研究温度范围内保持超过94%的高氮选择性是磷灰石基催化剂有效性的关键参数。平衡效率、选择性和安全性这些催化系统需要仔细优化准备方法、掺杂浓度，并深入了解空位形成对催化剂的电子结构和活性的影响。
