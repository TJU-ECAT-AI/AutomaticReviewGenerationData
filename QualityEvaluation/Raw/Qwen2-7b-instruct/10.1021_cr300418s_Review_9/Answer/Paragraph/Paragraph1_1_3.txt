        The synthesis and characterization of doped nickel oxide materials have significantly advanced our understanding of their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in the conversion of propane to propylene. The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation play pivotal roles in influencing these properties. For instance, the transformation of lead monoxide (PbO) to red lead (Pb2(II)Pb(IV)O) upon heating in the presence of air or oxygen, which behaves as a mixture of PbO and Pb02, illustrates the dynamic nature of these materials under reaction conditions. The sites responsible for hydrogen atom abstraction on these oxides are identified as lattice Os2- ions associated with Pb(I1) ions, rather than Pb(IV), highlighting the complex interplay between dopants and the underlying oxide structure.

        The role of antimony (Sb) as a dopant in vanadium oxide-based catalysts is particularly noteworthy. It enhances both the activity and stability of the catalysts in the CO2-EBDH reaction, leading to higher initial styrene yields and more consistent performance over time. This is attributed to antimony acting as a spillover oxygen donor, contributing to the inhibition of deep reduction of the catalysts through reoxidation of reduced active sites with high efficiency.

        Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding how preparation methods and dopant concentrations affect the bond strength of the weakest C-H bond, the presence of radical-forming sites on the surface, and the propensity of radicals to either desorb or undergo further surface reactions. The dispersion of vanadium oxide on the support surface also significantly contributes to catalyst stability by increasing amounts of mobile lattice oxygen, facilitating redox cycles.

        In the realm of future research, there is a need to develop more sophisticated theoretical models that accurately predict the behavior of these catalysts under various conditions. This would require a deeper integration of experimental data with computational simulations, taking into account the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the electronic structure of the catalyst. Process optimization efforts must balance multiple objectives, including maximizing yield, ensuring high selectivity, and maintaining safety throughout the operation.

        The addition of spillover oxygen donor phases, like antimony oxide, to the reducible oxides can provide a means to inhibit deep reduction, thereby promoting catalyst re-oxidizability. However, achieving this balance requires a detailed understanding of the kinetics and thermodynamics involved in the redox processes.

        The integration of machine learning algorithms with traditional modeling techniques could offer new insights into the relationship between catalyst design parameters and performance metrics. This could enable the rapid screening of candidate materials and the prediction of optimal operating conditions, leading to more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes.

        尼克尔氧化物基催化剂的合成和表征在了解其在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯、乙烷转化为乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能方面取得了显著进展。制备方法、掺杂浓度以及空位形成对这些性质具有关键影响。例如，铅氧化物（PbO）在空气或氧气的存在下加热时转化为红铅（Pb2(II)Pb(IV)O），表现为PbO和Pb02的混合物，这表明了这些材料在反应条件下的动态性质。这些氧化物中负责氢原子抽象的站点被识别为与Pb(I1)离子相关的晶格Os2-离子，而不是Pb(IV)，这突出了掺杂剂与底层氧化物结构之间复杂相互作用的特性。

        硫化锑（Sb）作为钒氧化物基催化剂的掺杂物的作用尤为突出。它增强了CO2-EBDH反应中催化剂的活性和稳定性，导致较高的初始苯乙烯产率和更一致的长期性能。这是归因于硫化锑作为溢出氧供体的角色，通过再氧化还原活性位点来抑制催化剂的深层还原，这种再氧化过程具有高效率。

        在理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面存在的关键挑战包括理解制备方法和掺杂浓度如何影响最弱C-H键的键强度、表面上的自由基形成位点的存在以及自由基是脱附还是进一步表面反应的倾向。支持表面上的钒氧化物的分散也对催化剂稳定性产生显著贡献，通过增加晶格氧的移动量，促进氧化还原循环。

        对于未来研究，需要发展更先进的理论模型，准确预测在各种条件下这些催化剂的行为。这需要将实验数据与计算模拟的深入整合，考虑到掺杂剂、空位和催化剂电子结构之间的复杂相互作用。在过程优化方面，必须平衡多个目标，包括最大化产量、确保高选择性，并在整个操作过程中维持安全。

        向可还原氧化物添加溢出氧供体相，如硫化锑，可以提供抑制深层还原、促进催化剂再氧化化的途径。然而，实现这一平衡需要对还原过程的动力学和热力学有详细的了解。

        结合机器学习算法的传统建模技术可以提供关于催化剂设计参数与性能指标之间关系的新见解，从而加速候选材料的筛选并预测最优运行条件。这对于各种氧化脱氢反应具有广泛的应用。
