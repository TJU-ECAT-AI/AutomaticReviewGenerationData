            Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The exploration of doped nickel oxide materials in propane dehydrogenation catalysts presents a promising avenue for enhancing catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of dopants such as antimony significantly boosts the catalytic activity and stability of vanadium oxide-based catalysts, leading to higher yields of desired products and improved long-term stability. This enhancement can be attributed to the role of antimony as a spillover oxygen donor, which facilitates redox cycles and inhibits deep reduction of catalysts, thereby promoting catalyst re-oxidizability. Moreover, the dispersion of vanadium oxide on the support surface contributes to better stability by increasing the amount of mobile lattice oxygen, thus supporting redox reactions essential for catalytic efficiency.

            As we move forward, the field is poised for significant advancements in theoretical modeling and process optimization. By leveraging insights gained from studying dopant effects and vacancy formation, researchers can develop more accurate predictive models that account for the intricate interplay between electronic structure, reaction mechanisms, and catalyst stability. These models will enable the design of catalysts that not only achieve high efficiency and selectivity but also ensure safety through optimized operating conditions and material properties. Additionally, future research efforts should focus on exploring the synergistic effects of multiple dopants and vacancies, aiming to create catalysts that can efficiently balance these critical factors. This approach promises to revolutionize the design and application of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, including those involved in the conversion of propane to propylene, thereby opening new avenues for sustainable and efficient chemical synthesis processes.

            综合理解与未来展望: 探索掺杂镍氧化物材料在丙烷脱氢催化剂中的应用，为提高氧化脱氢反应的催化性能提供了有前景的途径。引入诸如锑这样的掺杂剂显著提升了钒基催化剂的活性和稳定性，从而提高了目标产物的初始产率，并改善了长期稳定性。这种提升可归因于锑作为溢出氧供体的作用，它支持红ox循环并抑制催化剂的深层还原，进而促进催化剂的再氧化化能力。此外，钒氧化物在支撑表面的分散增加了自由晶格氧的量，从而支持对催化效率至关重要的红ox反应。

            随着技术的发展，理论建模和过程优化的领域将迎来重大突破。通过利用研究掺杂剂效果和空位形成所获得的见解，研究人员可以开发更精确的预测模型，这些模型能够考虑电子结构、反应机制和催化剂稳定性的复杂相互作用。这些模型将使催化剂的设计不仅能够实现高效性和选择性，而且还能确保通过优化操作条件和材料性质来确保安全性。此外，未来的研究工作应专注于探索多种掺杂剂和空位的协同效应，旨在创建既能高效平衡这些关键因素又能有效催化丙烷转化为丙烯的催化剂。这一策略有望彻底改变氧化脱氢反应中催化剂的设计和应用，从而开辟可持续和高效化学合成过程的新方向。
