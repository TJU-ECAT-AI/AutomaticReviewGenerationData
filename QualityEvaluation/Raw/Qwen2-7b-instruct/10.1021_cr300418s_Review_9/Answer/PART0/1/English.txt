The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding how these factors affect the bond strength of the weakest C-H bond, the presence of radical-forming sites on the surface, and the propensity of radicals to desorb or undergo further surface reactions. For instance, lead monoxide (PbO) transforms to red lead (Pb2(II)Pb(IV)O) upon heating in the presence of air or oxygen, which behaves as a mixture of PbO and Pb02. The sites responsible for hydrogen atom abstraction on these oxides are likely lattice Os2- ions associated with Pb(I1) ions, not Pb(IV), based on the observed chemistry and radical amounts.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety include understanding reaction mechanisms, predicting effects of preparation methods and dopant concentrations, and ensuring catalyst stability and safety. Antimony oxide plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of vanadium oxide-based catalysts used in these reactions. It increases the initial yield of desired products and improves long-term stability, inhibiting deep reduction of catalysts and facilitating efficient re-oxidation. The dispersion of vanadium oxide on the support surface contributes to better stability by increasing amounts of mobile lattice oxygen, facilitating redox cycles. Antimony acts as a spillover oxygen donor, helping to prevent deep reduction and promote catalyst re-oxidizability.
