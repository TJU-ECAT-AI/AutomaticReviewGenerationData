[1] "The ability of a surface to generate gas-phase hydrocarbon radicals depends upon the bond strength of the weakest C-H bond, the presence of particular radical-forming sites on the surface, and the propensity of the radicals to either desorb or to undergo further surface reactions."
          [2] "Lead monoxide (PbO), when heated in the presence of air or oxygen, is easily converted to the mixed oxide Pb2(II)Pb(IV)O,(red lead), which behaves chemically as a mixture of PbO and Pb02."
          [3] "Considering this chemistry and the radical amounts observed for the PbO samples, it appears that the sites responsible for hydrogen atom abstraction on these oxides are most likely lattice Os2- ions associated with Pb(I1) ions, and not Pb(IV)."

"The better dispersion of vanadium oxide component on the support surface also contributed to the better stability of the VSb/Al catalysts providing easier reducible spread active VOx-component with increased amounts of mobile lattice oxygen."
          "Antimony oxide was found to be an effective co-component of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts for the CO2-EBDH reaction improving its activity and especially on-stream stability."
          "Incorporation of antimony into V/Al increases not only the initial styrene yield (up to Y1 = 76%), but also provides stable catalytic performance."
          "The role of antimony in the Sb-poor VSbOx/Al2O3 catalysts could be interpreted as a spillover oxygen donor in the frame of the remote control mechanism theory elaborated by Delmon."
          "The addition of spillover oxygen donor phases, like antimony oxide, to the reducible oxides (spillover oxygen acceptor) contributes to inhibition of their deep reduction, which may be attributable to the capability of spillover oxygen species to reoxidize the reduced active sites with high efficiency."
