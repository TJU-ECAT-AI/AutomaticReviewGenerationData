          "The better dispersion of vanadium oxide component on the support surface also contributed to the better stability of the VSb/Al catalysts providing easier reducible spread active VOx-component with increased amounts of mobile lattice oxygen."
          "Antimony oxide was found to be an effective co-component of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts for the CO2-EBDH reaction improving its activity and especially on-stream stability."
          "Incorporation of antimony into V/Al increases not only the initial styrene yield (up to Y1 = 76%), but also provides stable catalytic performance."
          "The role of antimony in the Sb-poor VSbOx/Al2O3 catalysts could be interpreted as a spillover oxygen donor in the frame of the remote control mechanism theory elaborated by Delmon."
          "The addition of spillover oxygen donor phases, like antimony oxide, to the reducible oxides (spillover oxygen acceptor) contributes to inhibition of their deep reduction, which may be attributable to the capability of spillover oxygen species to reoxidize the reduced active sites with high efficiency."

          The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety include understanding reaction mechanisms, predicting effects of preparation methods and dopant concentrations, and ensuring catalyst stability and safety. Antimony oxide plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of vanadium oxide-based catalysts used in these reactions. It increases the initial yield of desired products and improves long-term stability, inhibiting deep reduction of catalysts and facilitating efficient re-oxidation. The dispersion of vanadium oxide on the support surface contributes to better stability by increasing amounts of mobile lattice oxygen, facilitating redox cycles. Antimony acts as a spillover oxygen donor, helping to prevent deep reduction and promote catalyst re-oxidizability.

          尼克尔氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂剂浓度和空位形成对其在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能产生影响，如乙基苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯。理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战包括理解反应机制、预测制备方法和掺杂剂浓度的影响以及确保催化剂的稳定性和安全性。砷氧化物在提高钒氧化物基催化剂在这些反应中的活性和稳定性方面发挥着关键作用。它不仅增加了初始目标产物的产率，而且提供了稳定的催化性能，通过抑制催化剂的深度还原并促进高效氧化来防止深度还原。支持表面的钒氧化物分散有助于提高稳定性，通过增加移动晶格氧的数量，促进红ox循环。砷作为溢出氧供体，帮助防止深度还原并促进催化剂的再氧化。

          The catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is primarily influenced by the supported vanadium oxide components, while the catalyst stability is controlled by the antimony oxide. Improved dispersion of the vanadium oxide on the support surface enhances the stability of the VSb/Al catalysts by providing an easily reducible spread active VOx component with increased amounts of mobile lattice oxygen. Antimony oxide acts as an effective co-component in alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts, improving the activity and especially the on-stream stability in the CO2-EBDH reaction. The addition of spillover oxygen donor phases, such as antimony oxide, helps inhibit the deep reduction of the catalysts, which can be attributed to the ability of spillover oxygen species to efficiently reoxidize reduced active sites.

          氧化脱氢反应的催化活性主要由支持的钒氧化物成分决定，而催化剂稳定性由锑氧化物控制。支持表面更好的分散的钒氧化物增强了VSb/Al催化剂的稳定性，提供了易于还原的分散活性VOx成分，增加了移动晶格氧的数量。锑氧化物作为铝氧支持的钒氧化物催化剂的有效辅助成分，在二氧化碳乙苯脱氢反应中提高了活性，特别是在线稳定性。添加溢出氧供体相，如锑氧化物，有助于抑制催化剂的深度还原，这可以归因于溢出氧物种高效再氧化减少活性位点的能力。
