The catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is primarily influenced by the supported vanadium oxide components, while the catalyst stability is controlled by the antimony oxide. Improved dispersion of the vanadium oxide on the support surface enhances the stability of the VSb/Al catalysts by providing an easily reducible spread active VOx component with increased amounts of mobile lattice oxygen. Antimony oxide acts as an effective co-component in alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts, improving the activity and especially the on-stream stability in the CO2-EBDH reaction. The addition of spillover oxygen donor phases, such as antimony oxide, helps inhibit the deep reduction of the catalysts, which can be attributed to the ability of spillover oxygen species to efficiently reoxidize reduced active sites.
