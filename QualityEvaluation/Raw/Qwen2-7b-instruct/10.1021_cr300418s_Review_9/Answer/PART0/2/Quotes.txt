"Catalytic results of Table 1 reveal that the catalytic activity is mainly determined by supported vanadium oxide species while the catalyst stability is controlled by antimony oxide."
          "The better dispersion of vanadium oxide component on the support surface also contributed to the better stability of the VSb/Al catalysts providing easier reducible spread active VOx-component with increased amounts of mobile lattice oxygen."
          "Antimony oxide was found to be an effective co-component of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts for the CO2-EBDH reaction improving its activity and especially on-stream stability."
          "The addition of spillover oxygen donor phases, like antimony oxide, to the reducible oxides (spillover oxygen acceptor) contributes to inhibition of their deep reduction, which may be attributable to the capability of spillover oxygen species to reoxidize the reduced active sites with high efficiency."
