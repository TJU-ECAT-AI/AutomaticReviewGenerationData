[1] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and makes the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic."
[2] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."

1. Reducible oxides exhibit Lewis acid properties, which lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and enhance the binding of various bases to the doped oxide surface. This also makes the dissociative adsorption of alkanes more exothermic.
2. High-valence dopants act as Lewis bases, strongly attracting Lewis acids like O2 or halogen molecules.

1. 可还原氧化物表现出路易斯酸的性质，这降低了氧空位形成的能量，并增加了表面掺杂氧化物的各种基团的结合能力。这也使得烷烃的离解吸附更加放热。
2. 高价掺杂物表现为路易斯碱，强烈吸引像O2或卤素分子这样的路易斯酸。
