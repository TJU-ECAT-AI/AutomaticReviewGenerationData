<quotes>
<p>These rules seem general (we found no exceptions); the effects predicted by them are large; and they seem to apply any time a chemical process involves a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair.</p>
<p>Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms. The vacancy is a strong base, and the unpaired electrons produced when the oxygen atom is removed are transferred to the cations of the oxide. This reduces the energy to form the vacancy. An adsorbed metal atom, such as Pt, or Au, or Cu, donates electrons to reduce the oxides cation.</p>
<p>High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases. If the dopant is very basic, the O2 molecule (or X2) adsorbed on it is bound too strongly, and it is not chemically active. However, in some cases the group formed by the dopant with O2 adsorbed on it acts as a low-valence dopant and activates surface oxygen.</p>

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The electronic structure is affected by the introduction of dopants, which can alter the surface chemistry and reactivity. High-valence dopants, acting as Lewis bases, can adsorb strongly Lewis acids like O2 or halogen molecules, facilitating reactions. The balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems is a key challenge. Theoretical modeling must accurately predict the behavior of these catalysts under various conditions to optimize the process. Theoretical predictions need to account for the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and reactants to achieve high yields of desired products with minimal side reactions.

[1] "The binding energy of a Lewis acid to an oxide surface can be increased substantially if the surface is modified to become a Lewis base."
[2] "Conversely, the binding energy of a Lewis base can be increased by modifying the surface to become a Lewis acid, which can be achieved by doping with low-valence dopants."
[3] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. High-valence dopants, acting as Lewis bases, enhance the adsorption of Lewis acids such as O2 or halogen molecules. This increases the electronic conductivity and promotes the dissociation of hydrocarbons, leading to the production of olefins. Low-valence dopants, functioning as Lewis acids, lower the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation, which is crucial for the oxygen transfer in the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. This results in improved oxygen utilization and enhanced conversion rates. The balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety is a key challenge. Theoretical modeling often struggles to accurately predict the complex interactions at the catalyst surface, especially under dynamic reaction conditions. Process optimization requires a deep understanding of the kinetic pathways and thermodynamics, which can be computationally intensive. Balancing these factors necessitates a combination of advanced computational techniques, experimental validation, and continuous refinement of the catalyst design.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成可以显著影响它们在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能。高价掺杂剂作为Lewis碱，增强了氧气或卤素分子的吸附，提高了电子导电性并促进了烃类的分解，从而生成烯烃。低价掺杂剂作为Lewis酸，降低了氧空位形成能垒，对于马斯万克列恩机制中的氧传输至关重要。这提升了氧气利用效率和转化率。平衡效率、选择性和安全性是一个关键挑战。理论建模往往难以准确预测复杂的表面相互作用，尤其是在动态反应条件下。过程优化需要深入了解动力学路径和热力学，这可能非常耗时。平衡这些因素需要结合高级计算技术、实验验证和不断优化催化剂设计。

<p>The binding energy of Au on an ultrathin MgO film supported on a metal increases as the work function of the metal decreases.</p>
<p>A smaller work function means a higher HOMO energy and hence a stronger basicity.</p>
<p>Increasing the strength of the base results in a larger binding energy for the acid.</p>
<p>The acidity of Au is neutralized readily, and increasing the strength of the base beyond a certain value has no effect on the adsorption energy of Au.</p>
<p>O2, which is a stronger acid, is not neutralized as readily, and its binding energy can be increased by increasing the strength of the base.</p>

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The electronic structure of the catalysts can be tuned by adjusting these factors, affecting the reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts. For instance, doping with specific elements can alter the surface properties, such as the formation of oxygen vacancies, which can enhance the catalytic activity by providing active sites for reactions. The concentration of dopants can also impact the electronic distribution and thus the catalytic performance. However, the precise balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety remains a challenge. Theoretical modeling can help predict these effects, but accurately simulating the complex interactions between the catalysts, reactants, and products remains a significant challenge. Process optimization requires careful consideration of operational parameters, such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates, to ensure the most efficient conversion of feedstocks while maintaining high selectivity towards desired products. Balancing these factors requires a deep understanding of the underlying chemical kinetics and thermodynamics, which can be complex due to the heterogeneous nature of the catalytic reactions.

[2] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."
[3] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions in several ways. The introduction of Lewis acids, such as those formed by high-valence dopants or reducible oxides, alters the electronic structure of the catalyst. This modification can lead to a decrease in the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, thereby facilitating the creation of active sites for catalysis. Additionally, the presence of Lewis acids can increase the binding energy of Lewis bases, such as hydrogen and alkanes, to the surface. This enhancement can make the dissociative adsorption of alkanes more exothermic, lowering the activation energy for the key steps in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems presents significant challenges, particularly in managing the trade-offs between the catalytic activity and the potential for side reactions. Theoretical modeling efforts must accurately capture the complex interactions between the catalyst, reactants, and products to optimize process conditions. Key challenges include understanding the detailed mechanisms governing the conversion pathways, predicting the stability and reactivity of intermediates, and ensuring the catalyst's long-term performance under industrially relevant conditions.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂剂浓度和氧空位形成影响其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能。引入Lewis酸，如高价掺杂剂或可还原氧化物形成的Lewis酸，可以改变催化剂的电子结构。这种修改可以降低氧空位形成所需的能量，从而促进催化活性位点的生成。此外，Lewis酸的存在还可以增加表面Lewis碱（如氢和烷烃）的结合能。这可以使得烷烃的解离吸附更放热，降低关键步骤的活化能。在这些催化系统中平衡效率、选择性和安全性的挑战性很大，特别是管理催化活性与潜在副反应之间的权衡。理论建模努力必须准确捕获催化剂、反应物和产物之间复杂的相互作用，以优化工艺条件。关键挑战包括理解控制转化途径的详细机制，预测中间体的稳定性和反应性，并确保催化剂在工业相关条件下长期保持性能。
