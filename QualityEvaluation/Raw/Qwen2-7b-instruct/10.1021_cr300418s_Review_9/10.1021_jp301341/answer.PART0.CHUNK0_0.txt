<p>These rules seem general (we found no exceptions); the effects predicted by them are large; and they seem to apply any time a chemical process involves a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair.</p>
<p>Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms. The vacancy is a strong base, and the unpaired electrons produced when the oxygen atom is removed are transferred to the cations of the oxide. This reduces the energy to form the vacancy. An adsorbed metal atom, such as Pt, or Au, or Cu, donates electrons to reduce the oxides cation.</p>
<p>High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases. If the dopant is very basic, the O2 molecule (or X2) adsorbed on it is bound too strongly, and it is not chemically active. However, in some cases the group formed by the dopant with O2 adsorbed on it acts as a low-valence dopant and activates surface oxygen.</p>

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The electronic structure is affected by the introduction of dopants, which can alter the surface chemistry and reactivity. High-valence dopants, acting as Lewis bases, can adsorb strongly Lewis acids like O2 or halogen molecules, facilitating reactions. The balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems is a key challenge. Theoretical modeling must accurately predict the behavior of these catalysts under various conditions to optimize the process. Theoretical predictions need to account for the complex interactions between dopants, vacancies, and reactants to achieve high yields of desired products with minimal side reactions.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成可以显著影响它们在异丁烯转化为异丙苯和乙烷转化为乙烯等氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能。电子结构受到掺杂的影响，可改变表面化学性质和反应活性。高价掺杂剂作为亲核试剂，能强烈吸附氧或卤素分子等Lewis酸，促进反应。这些催化系统的效率、选择性和安全性之间的平衡是一个关键挑战。理论模型必须准确预测这些催化剂在不同条件下的行为，以优化过程。理论预测需要考虑掺杂剂、空位和反应物之间复杂的相互作用，以实现高产率的期望产物并减少副反应。
