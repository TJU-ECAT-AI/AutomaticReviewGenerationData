[1] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."
[2] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."
[3] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic (because the fragments R and H produced by dissociation are Lewis bases and the surface is a Lewis acid)."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions in several ways. The introduction of Lewis acids, such as those formed by high-valence dopants or reducible oxides, alters the electronic structure of the catalyst. This modification can lead to a decrease in the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, thereby facilitating the creation of active sites for catalysis. Additionally, the presence of Lewis acids can increase the binding energy of Lewis bases, such as hydrogen and alkanes, to the surface. This enhancement can make the dissociative adsorption of alkanes more exothermic, lowering the activation energy for the key steps in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems presents significant challenges, particularly in managing the trade-offs between the catalytic activity and the potential for side reactions. Theoretical modeling efforts must accurately capture the complex interactions between the catalyst, reactants, and products to optimize process conditions. Key challenges include understanding the detailed mechanisms governing the conversion pathways, predicting the stability and reactivity of intermediates, and ensuring the catalyst's long-term performance under industrially relevant conditions.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂剂浓度和氧空位形成影响其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能。引入Lewis酸，如高价掺杂剂或可还原氧化物形成的Lewis酸，可以改变催化剂的电子结构。这种修改可以降低氧空位形成所需的能量，从而促进催化活性位点的生成。此外，Lewis酸的存在还可以增加表面Lewis碱（如氢和烷烃）的结合能。这可以使得烷烃的解离吸附更放热，降低关键步骤的活化能。在这些催化系统中平衡效率、选择性和安全性的挑战性很大，特别是管理催化活性与潜在副反应之间的权衡。理论建模努力必须准确捕获催化剂、反应物和产物之间复杂的相互作用，以优化工艺条件。关键挑战包括理解控制转化途径的详细机制，预测中间体的稳定性和反应性，并确保催化剂在工业相关条件下长期保持性能。
