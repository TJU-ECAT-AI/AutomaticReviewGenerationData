[1] "The binding energy of a Lewis acid to an oxide surface can be increased substantially if the surface is modified to become a Lewis base."
[2] "Conversely, the binding energy of a Lewis base can be increased by modifying the surface to become a Lewis acid, which can be achieved by doping with low-valence dopants."
[3] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."
[4] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. High-valence dopants, acting as Lewis bases, enhance the adsorption of Lewis acids such as O2 or halogen molecules. This increases the electronic conductivity and promotes the dissociation of hydrocarbons, leading to the production of olefins. Low-valence dopants, functioning as Lewis acids, lower the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation, which is crucial for the oxygen transfer in the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. This results in improved oxygen utilization and enhanced conversion rates. The balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety is a key challenge. Theoretical modeling often struggles to accurately predict the complex interactions at the catalyst surface, especially under dynamic reaction conditions. Process optimization requires a deep understanding of the kinetic pathways and thermodynamics, which can be computationally intensive. Balancing these factors necessitates a combination of advanced computational techniques, experimental validation, and continuous refinement of the catalyst design.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成可以显著影响它们在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能。高价掺杂剂作为Lewis碱，增强了氧气或卤素分子的吸附，提高了电子导电性并促进了烃类的分解，从而生成烯烃。低价掺杂剂作为Lewis酸，降低了氧空位形成能垒，对于马斯万克列恩机制中的氧传输至关重要。这提升了氧气利用效率和转化率。平衡效率、选择性和安全性是一个关键挑战。理论建模往往难以准确预测复杂的表面相互作用，尤其是在动态反应条件下。过程优化需要深入了解动力学路径和热力学，这可能非常耗时。平衡这些因素需要结合高级计算技术、实验验证和不断优化催化剂设计。
