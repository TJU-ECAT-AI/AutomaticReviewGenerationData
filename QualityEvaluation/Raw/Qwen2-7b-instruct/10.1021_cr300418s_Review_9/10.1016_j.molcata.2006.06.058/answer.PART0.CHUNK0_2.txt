[1] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene (ODHE), NiO catalyst loaded on high-surface area MgO (HS-MgO) afforded high C2H6 conversion of 68.8%, C2H4 selectivity of 52.8%, and C2H4 yield of 36.8% at 600 C, without dilution of the feed."
[2] "XRD, XPS, and H2-TPR revealed that NiO phase surrounded by NiOMgO solid solution was the active phase for the ODHE."
[3] "To keep Ni species as NiO, a high surface area of MgO was essential."
[4] "When the NiO was reduced to metallic Ni, the partial oxidation of ethane proceeded with high selectivity to CO and H2."
[5] "HR-TEM images showed that the NiO particle size on high-surface area MgO was around 7 nm."

The preparation of nickel oxide (NiO) catalysts on high-surface area magnesium oxide (MgO) supports plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHE) of ethane to ethylene. Key factors influencing the electronic structure and catalytic performance of these catalysts include the NiO phase surrounded by a NiOMgO solid solution, which acts as the active phase for the ODHE. To maintain Ni species in the form of NiO, the MgO support must have a high surface area. Reducing the NiO phase to metallic Ni leads to a high selectivity for the partial oxidation of ethane, favoring the production of CO and H2. High dispersion of NiO on the MgO surface, as demonstrated by HR-TEM images, contributes to the catalyst's superior performance in ethylene production through selective ODHE reactions.

镍氧化物（NiO）催化剂在高表面积镁氧化物（MgO）支持上的制备对于乙烷到乙烯的氧化脱氢反应（ODHE）至关重要。影响这些催化剂的电子结构和催化性能的关键因素包括NiO相周围由NiOMgO固溶体形成的活性相，这是ODHE中的活性相。为了保持Ni物种以NiO的形式存在，MgO支持必须具有高表面积。将NiO相还原为金属Ni会导致乙烷的高选择性部分氧化，有利于生成CO和H2。通过高分辨透射电子显微镜（HR-TEM）图像显示，MgO表面高度分散的NiO有助于通过选择性ODHE反应产生乙二醇，从而提高催化剂的性能。
