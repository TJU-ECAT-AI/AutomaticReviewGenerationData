Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 260 (2006) 144151 Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene over NiO loaded on high surface area MgO Ken-Ichi Nakamura, Takanori Miyake, Toru Konishi, Toshimitsu Suzuki Department of Chemical Engineering and High Technology Research Center, Kansai University, Suita, Osaka 564-8680, Japan Received 11 May 2006; received in revised form 14 June 2006; accepted 26 June 2006 Available online 22 August 2006 Abstract The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over NiO-loaded MgO with high surface area was carried out using a fixed-bed flow reactor at 600 C under atmospheric pressure.
At 600 C, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C2H6/O2 = 1) without dilution with an inert gas resulted in C2H6 conversion of 68.8% and a high C2H4 selectivity of 52.8%, which corresponds to a C2H4 yield of 36.3%. In addition, the catalytic activity did not decrease for at least 10 h. X-ray photoelectron spectra of the catalysts after the reaction exhibited that the initial valence state of Ni2+ (NiO) was maintained during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. However, when NiO-loaded MgO was reduced with H2 prior to the reaction, C2H4 selectivity decreased to nearly zero and high CO and H2 selectivities were observed with the C2H6 conversion of 50 %, indicating that partial oxidation of C2H6 proceeded.
Therefore, it seems important to keep Ni species as an oxide phase on the support, and for this purpose, use of the high surface area of MgO is essential. 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Increasing demand on light alkenes is of current importance.
Ethylene and propylene are the most important petrochemical feed stocks, and they are produced via steam cracking of naptha and the heavier fraction of natural gas. This process, however,is operated at a high temperature and consumes large amount of energy with low selectivities to alkenes and unavoidable coke formation [1].
Recently, an efficient utilization of light gases from oil fields has attracted a great deal of attention from petrochemical indus- tries, and as a result, intensive development of more efficient and selective processes has been carried out. One of such processes is an oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene (ODHE;reaction (1)):

Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene could be achieved at much lower temperatures than those with steam cracking due to an exothermic reaction.
Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane was first reported by Lunsford et al. over MoO3 on SiO2 using N2O as an oxidant [2]. A large number of researchers have proposed various catalysts effective for ODHE; they are classified as non- reducible catalysts, reducible metal-oxide catalysts and complex metal-oxide catalysts.
Aika et al. [3] have shown that Co2+-doped MgO is effective for the ODHE with N2O as an oxidant. However, it is difficult to industrialize this process because of the high cost of N2O as an oxidant. From an industrial viewpoint, catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using oxygen as an oxidant should be exploited.
Thorsteinson et al. [4] have reported that mixed oxide of Mo and V is active for the ODHE, with very high selectivity to ethylene with a low conversion.
Lunsford et al. reported that Li+/MgO catalyst was active in the oxygen and ethane mixed gas at a low O2 partial pressure.
They proposed that ethoxide formed on MgO surface via ethyl radicals afforded a high yield of ethylene up to 34% at a reaction 1381-1169/$  see front matter  2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.molcata.2006.06.058

145 temperature above 600 C [5,6]. However, the catalyst exhibited only a short lifetime.
The ODHE reaction over V2O5- or MoO3-loaded catalysts has achieved high ethylene selectivity via the redox cycle (Mars and Krevelen mechanism) and/or acidbase properties [710].
However, a high activity always proceeded with deep oxidation of produced ethylene.
Layered complex metal chloride oxide SrBi3O4Cl3 with SrCl2 and KCl afforded very high selectivity to ethylene in the reaction of ethane and oxygen at 660 C [11,12].
Non-reducible mixed metal oxides like MoVTe oxides for ODHE have been reported to exhibit high activity at a temper- ature lower than 400 C [1317]. In these studies, most of the researchers employed conditions in which ethane and oxygen were highly diluted with an inert gas. From a practical stand point, dilution with inert gases must be avoided.
We have reported that carbon dioxide, as a mild oxidant,markedly promotes the dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga2O3- loaded TiO2 and Cr2O3-loaded oxidized diamond catalysts [18,19]. However, with these catalyst systems, ethylene yields decreased with an increase in the reaction time, due to carbon deposition onto the catalyst. To overcome this, development of an active and selective new catalyst using oxygen as an oxidant is essential.
Recently, NiO-loaded on Al2O3 catalysts for ODHE have been reported to exhibit high activity [2022]. NiO-loaded Al2O3 catalyst with highly dispersed NiO produces a high yield of ethylene. However, details regarding active sites for ODHE have not yet been clarified. Heracleous et al. have reported that Nb for NiONbnOm catalyst improves the dispersion of the nickel phase and facilitates CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter [23,24].
Heracleous et al. have reported that in the comparison between V- or Mo-oxide loaded on Al2O3 and those loaded on TiO2, the presence of basic sites enhances the fast desorption of the produced olefins on the catalyst surface, resulting in higher selectivities [10]. However, NiO loaded on basic support for ODHE has not been reported. Ruckenstein et al. have described that Ni species loaded on MgO catalyst exist in the form of a solid solution, which stabilizes nickel against sintering during the CO2 reforming of methane [25,26]. This finding seems to indicate that the highly dispersed NiO loaded on high-surface area MgO would be resistant to sintering and would promote the
ODHE.
The present study focused on the ODHE on NiO-loaded cat- alysts without dilution with an inert gas, and here we report that MgO with high surface area is a promising support for this reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The catalyst supports used in this study were MgO (100,1000 A; Ube Industries Ltd.), Al2O3 (Sumitomo Chemical Co.), SiO2 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.), TiO2 (P25; Japan Aerosil Co.), La2O3, and Y2O3 (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.).
The supported nickel oxide catalysts containing 5 wt.% of Ni as metal were prepared by impregnating an ethanol solu- tion of Ni(acac)2 (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) to a suspended support,followed by evaporation-to-dryness under vacuum. Supported catalyst precursors were calcined at 600 C for 5 h in air prior to the reaction. After the calcination, the catalysts were crashed and sieved to pass a 100 mesh screen and used for the reaction.
2.2. Catalytic reaction
The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane was carried out with a fixed-bed flow-type quartz reactor (8 mm i.d. × 350 mm L) at a temperature range from 450 to 600 C under atmospheric pressure. After placing 60 mg of a catalyst in the reactor, O2 and C2H6 were introduced with a molar ratio from 1:2 to 1:1. The total gas flow rate was fixed at 30 mL/min. Effluent gas (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and O2) was analyzed with an online high-speed gas chromatograph equipped with TCD detectors (PC-Chrom, M200 Chromato Analyzer) using Molecular Sieve 5 A and Poraplot Q columns.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
The surface area of the support and catalyst was measured by the BET method using N2 at 77 K with an automatic Micromerit- ics Gemini 2375.
Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was performed using an online quadrupole mass spectrometer (HAL201, Hiden Analytical Ltd.) fitted with an outlet of a fixed-bed quartz reactor (i.d. 4 mm × 200 mm). After placing a 50 mg of catalyst in the reactor, 3 mL/min of H2 and 27 mL/min of Ar were introduced.
Before the reaction, the catalyst was pretreated under Ar flow for 30 min at 400 C. A mass spectrometer was scanned for cor- responding parent peaks of the following five compounds, H2, H2O, CH4, CO, and CO2, within 1 s, and repeated scans were collected on a personal computer.
Pulsed CO adsorption technique was employed to measure the amounts of CO adsorbed on Ni by using a home build appa- ratus.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was obtained on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Jeol JPS-9000MX) using Mg K radiation as the energy source with the reference of C 1s at
285.0 eV
A Jeol JEM2010 was used to obtain high-resolution trans- mission electron microscope (HR-TEM) images at 200 kV.

There was also carbon formation on these supports as a side reaction:

H
298 = 136 kJ/mol (2) In order to confirm the Ni species after the reaction, XRD of the catalysts were measured, as shown in Fig. 1. After the reaction, NiO loaded on Al2O3 showed neither NiO nor Ni.
On the other hand, after the reaction using the other supports,diffraction peaks ascribed to metallic Ni were observed. This finding indicates that NiO on these supports was reduced to metallic Ni by the feed C2H6 and produced H2, and the POE reaction then proceeded on these catalysts.

When MgO having high surface area (HS-MgO) was employed as a support, C2H6 conversion decreased to 32.0% with a high C2H4 selectivity of 54.3%, and C2H4 yield of 17.4% was obtained without carbon formation (Run 9). As discussed later, at a high partial pressure of O2, C2H4 yield of 36.8% was obtained (Run 10). From these findings, high-surface area MgO was selected as the best support material for NiO in the ODHE and used in the following detailed studies.
If NiO-loaded HS-MgO was reduced with H2 prior to the reaction, C2H4 selectivity decreased to nearly zero, although C2H6 conversion increased to 50% (Run 11). These results seem to indicate that dehydrogenation proceeded on NiO, while only POE proceeded on metallic Ni.
In order to confirm active species of NiO loaded on HS- MgO,X-rayphotoelectronspectraofvariousNi-loadedcatalysts are compared and are shown in Fig. 2. It is known that the Ni 2p2/3 peak of bulk NiO and that of metallic Ni appear at 853.5 and 852.9 eV, respectively. On the surface of the fresh catalyst (Fig. 2a), only NiO was observed, as evidenced by the single peak at 853.3 eV, and after H2 reduction at 600 C the binding energy of Ni 2p2/3 shifted to the lower binding energy side,indicating that NiO was reduced to metallic Ni (Fig. 2b). The spectrum of the catalyst after the ODHE reaction with C2H6 and O2 (2:1) showed an overlapping peak composed of both NiO and metallic Ni (Fig. 2c). On the other hand, only a peak ascribed to metallic Ni was observed after the reaction with the pre-reduced catalyst (Fig. 2d).
NiO and MgO are well known to form solid solution. Par- malaina et al. have reported that a high calcination temperature at 800 C favors the diffusion of NiO on the surface of MgO to the inside of the MgO lattice to form solid solution [27]. It is reported to be difficult to reduce once formed NiOMgO solid solution on the MgO surface by H2 [28].

On the other hand, for the NiO/HS-MgO calcined at 950 C, no distinct reduction peak was observed, suggesting that the amount of NiO decreased on the MgO surface, probably due to the formation of a NiOMgO solid solution.
Table 2 illustrates the effects of catalyst calcination temper- ature on the C2H6 conversion and product selectivities. With NiO-loaded HS-MgO calcined at 400 C, the C2H6 conversion of 40.4% was obtained with high selectivities to CO and H2. This finding indicates that NiO on HS-MgO was reduced to metallic Ni and the POE proceeded. On the other hand, with NiO/HS- MgO calcined at 600 C, the C2H6 conversion decreased to
32.0% with a high C2H4 selectivity of 54.3%. With NiO/HS-
MgO calcined at 950 C, the C2H6 conversion further decreased to 22.8% with a decrease in C2H4 selectivity to 28.5%. These results suggest that the interaction is weak between NiO and MgO in the NiO-loaded MgO catalyst calcined at 400 C, and that NiO would be reduced to some extent to metallic Ni, giving CO and H2 via the POE. On the other hand, calcination at 600 C,the peripheral portion of NiO particles on the MgO surface could form a NiOMgO solid solution, but the central portion of the particles would remain as NiO. On the NiO surface, the ODHE reaction might have proceeded to give ethylene, as indicated by the decrease in the intensity of H2O desorption in the H2-TPR.
To evaluate sizes and the amount of reducible NiO on MgO after calcination, the calcined catalysts were hydrogen reduced at 400 C, and then CO adsorption was measured by pulse tech- nique. The results are shown in Table 2. The amount of CO adsorbed decreased with an increase in the calcination temper- ature, indicating that loss of reducible NiO and increase in the particle sizes.
3.2. Effects of Ni-loading level on the ODHE
Table 3 illustrates the effects of Ni-loading level on the C2H6 conversion and product selectivities. Over bare support MgO (Run 15), ethane conversion and product selectivity were sim- ilar to those without catalyst (Run 1). With an increase in the Ni-loading level, from 1 to 3 wt.%, C2H6 conversion and C2H4 selectivity markedly increased. Zhang et al. stated that well dis- persed NiO on Al2O3 is effective for the ODHE [20]. It seems natural to predict that at a lower Ni-loading level C2H4 selec- tivity increases with a decrease in the selectivity to CO2, since the lower loading level provides higher dispersion of NiO on Table 2 Effect of calcination temperature of the catalyst on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane Run Calcination (C) Surface area (m2/g) CO adsorptiona (mol/g cat) C2H6 conversion (%) C2H4 yield (%) Selectivity (%)

With an increase in Ni-loading level from 3 to 10 wt.%, how- ever, C2H6 conversion and C2H4 selectivity remained constant with a slight increase in CO2 selectivity. If the NiO-loading level was increased to 15 wt.%, however, the C2H4 selectivity decreased to nearly zero with 50% C2H6 conversion. At a high NiO-loading level, the particle size of NiO on HS-MgO becomes larger, so that the interaction between NiO and HS-MgO would decrease to undergo facile reduction to metallic Ni. As a result, POE proceeded at a higher Ni-loading level. From these results,the optimal loading level of Ni for HS-MgO would be 5 wt.%.
3.3. Effects of reaction temperature on the ODHE
Fig. 4 shows the effects of reaction temperature on the ODHE over NiO loaded on HS-MgO catalyst. Below 450 C,the reaction did not proceed and the ODHE occurred at above 475 C. With increases in reaction temperature, the C2H6 con- version and C2H4 selectivity increased with a decrease in the CO2 selectivity. One of the most undesired problems associ- ated with the ODHE catalysts is the decrease in the olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion, consistent with parallel-consecutive reactions [10]. Alkene is highly reactive molecule, in most cases more reactive than the correspond- ing alkane. Alkene is easily activated on the catalyst surface and undergoes secondary oxidation reactions to COx. In the case of NiO loaded on HS-MgO catalyst, the C2H4 selectiv- ity increased with an increase in the reaction temperature up to
625 C.
When the oxidation of C2H4 was carried out without cata- lyst using the same reactor at 550 C, the main products were CO and CO2 with a high C2H4 conversion of 30%, indicat- ing that C2H4 and unreacted O2 easily reacted to give CO2.
With an increase in the reaction temperature, the formation rate of C2H4 seems to be higher than the secondary oxidation rate of C2H4. Another possible reason for the increased selectiv- ity of C2H4 at a higher reaction temperature is the decrease in the concentration of unreacted O2, due to the increase in the C2H6 conversion. With increases in the reaction temperature, the C2H4 selectivity therefore increased with a decrease in the CO2 selectivity.
3.4. Effects of O2 partial pressure and space velocity on the
ODHE
Fig. 5 shows the effects of the O2 partial pressure on the ODHE over NiO loaded on HS-MgO catalyst, keeping the total gas flow rate at 30 mL/min. The O2/C2H6 ratio was varied from
0.33 to 1. At an O2/C2H6 ratio of 1, the highest C2H6 con-
version and C2H4 yield were obtained. However, at a lower O2 partial pressure, CO2, CO, and H2 selectivities increased,with a decrease in the selectivity to C2H4. This is just oppo- site behavior observed in general oxidative selective reactions,where under a low O2/substrate ratio, selectivity to the desired Fig. 4.

Accordingly, at the lower O2 partial pres- sure, NiO on HS-MgO would be reduced to metallic Ni due to the reducing atmosphere, and CO and H2 selectivities increased according to the progress of the POE.
These results were confirmed by XPS analyses of the cata- lysts before and after the reaction under different oxygen partial pressures (Fig. 6). With a decrease in the O2 partial pressure,the binding energy of Ni 2p3/2 peaks shifted to lower values, and the deconvoluted peak area ratio of Ni(II) to Ni(0) increased one to three, indicating that NiO on the fresh catalyst tended to be reduced to metallic Ni by the feed of C2H6 rich gas.
Fig. 7 shows the effects of the space velocity on the ODHE over NiO loaded on HS-MgO catalyst. The space velocity was varied by changing the amount of catalyst in the reactor. With an increaseinthespacevelocityfrom25,000to180,000 mL/g cat h,the C2H4 selectivity increased from 54.3 to 65.1% with a decrease in the C2H6 conversion from 35.6 to 16.7%. C2H4 selectivity decreased with an increased contact time due to the secondary deep oxidation reaction of C2H4 to CO2 and H2O.
3.5. Stability of NiO loaded on HS-MgO catalyst in the
ODHE
Catalytic performance of NiO loaded on HS-MgO catalyst was tested for a prolonged period at 600 C at an O2/C2H6 ratio of 0.5. Fig. 8 shows the conversion of C2H6 and the C2H4, Fig. 6.

CO2, and CO selectivities as a function of time on stream. As time progressed, the C2H6 conversion decreased slightly with an increase in the C2H4 selectivity. These results indicate that the catalyst may exhibit high activity for prolonged period.
3.6. HR-TEM images of NiO loaded on MgO catalyst
Fig. 9 shows HR-TEM images of NiO loaded on HS-MgO catalyst. TEM images of MgO crystallites were cubic, and con- siderably uniform and darker NiO images of ca 7 nm were seen.
The well dispersed NiO observed by TEM images provides strong evidence of the higher performance of NiO loaded on HS-MgO catalyst for the selective ODHE to ethylene.
4. Conclusion
For the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene (ODHE), NiO catalyst loaded on high-surface area MgO (HS- MgO) afforded high C2H6 conversion of 68.8%, C2H4 selec- tivity of 52.8%, and C2H4 yield of 36.8% at 600 C, without dilution of the feed.
XRD, XPS, and H2-TPR revealed that NiO phase surrounded by NiOMgO solid solution was the active phase for the ODHE.
To keep Ni species as NiO, a high surface area of MgO was essential. When the NiO was reduced to metallic Ni, the partial oxidation of ethane proceeded with high selectivity to CO and
H2.
HR-TEM images showed that the NiO particle size on high- surface area MgO was around 7 nm. Thus, highly dispersed NiO on HS-MgO is effective for the ODHE.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
