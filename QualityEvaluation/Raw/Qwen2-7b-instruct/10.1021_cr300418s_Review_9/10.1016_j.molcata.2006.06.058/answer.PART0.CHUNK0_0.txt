[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over NiO loaded on high surface area MgO was carried out using a fixed-bed flow reactor at 600 C under atmospheric pressure."
[2] "At 600 C, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C2H6/O2 = 1) without dilution with an inert gas resulted in C2H6 conversion of 68.8% and a high C2H4 selectivity of 52.8%, which corresponds to a C2H4 yield of 36.3%."
[3] "XRD, XPS, and H2-TPR revealed that NiO phase surrounded by NiOMgO solid solution was the active phase for the ODHE."
[4] "To keep Ni species as NiO, a high surface area of MgO was essential."
[5] "When the NiO was reduced to metallic Ni, the partial oxidation of ethane proceeded with high selectivity to CO and H2."
[6] "HR-TEM images showed that the NiO particle size on high-surface area MgO was around 7 nm."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the specific roles of these factors in determining the catalyst's activity, stability, and selectivity. The presence of a high surface area MgO support is crucial for maintaining the Ni species as NiO, which is the active phase for oxidative dehydrogenation. Reducing NiO to metallic Ni leads to partial oxidation of ethane with high selectivity to CO and H2. The HR-TEM images demonstrate that the NiO particle size on high-surface area MgO is approximately 7 nm, indicating that highly dispersed NiO is effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene.
