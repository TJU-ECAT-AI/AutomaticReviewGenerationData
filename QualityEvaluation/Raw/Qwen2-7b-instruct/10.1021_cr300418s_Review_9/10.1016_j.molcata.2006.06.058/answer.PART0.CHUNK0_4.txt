[1] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene (ODHE), NiO catalyst loaded on high-surface area MgO (HS-MgO) afforded high C2H6 conversion of 68.8%, C2H4 selectivity of 52.8%, and C2H4 yield of 36.8% at 600 C, without dilution of the feed."
[2] "XRD, XPS, and H2-TPR revealed that NiO phase surrounded by NiOMgO solid solution was the active phase for the ODHE."
[3] "To keep Ni species as NiO, a high surface area of MgO was essential. When the NiO was reduced to metallic Ni, the partial oxidation of ethane proceeded with high selectivity to CO and H2."
[4] "HR-TEM images showed that the NiO particle size on high-surface area MgO was around 7 nm. Thus, highly dispersed NiO on HS-MgO is effective for the ODHE."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The high surface area of magnesium oxide (MgO) is essential to maintain nickel species as nickel oxide (NiO), which acts as the active phase for oxidative dehydrogenation. Reducing NiO to metallic nickel leads to partial oxidation of ethane with high selectivity to carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2). The high dispersion of NiO on high-surface area MgO, as evidenced by HR-TEM images, is crucial for the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic system. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the detailed mechanisms of the reactions, optimizing the synthesis conditions to achieve high dispersion, and ensuring the stability and longevity of the catalyst under operational conditions.
