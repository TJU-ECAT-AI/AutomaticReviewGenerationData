[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over NiO-loaded MgO with high surface area was carried out using a fixed-bed flow reactor at 600 C under atmospheric pressure."
[2] "At 600 C, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C2H6/O2 = 1) without dilution with an inert gas resulted in C2H6 conversion of 68.8% and a high C2H4 selectivity of 52.8%, which corresponds to a C2H4 yield of 36.3%."
[3] "In addition, the catalytic activity did not decrease for at least 10 h."
[4] "X-ray photoelectron spectra of the catalysts after the reaction exhibited that the initial valence state of Ni2+ (NiO) was maintained during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
[5] "When NiO-loaded MgO was reduced with H2 prior to the reaction, C2H4 selectivity decreased to nearly zero and high CO and H2 selectivities were observed with the C2H6 conversion of 50 %, indicating that partial oxidation of C2H6 proceeded."
[6] "Therefore, it seems important to keep Ni species as an oxide phase on the support, and for this purpose, use of the high surface area of MgO is essential."
[7] "The present study focused on the ODHE on NiO-loaded catalysts without dilution with an inert gas, and here we report that MgO with high surface area is a promising support for this reaction."
[8] "XRD, XPS, and H2-TPR revealed that NiO phase surrounded by NiOMgO solid solution was the active phase for the ODHE."
[9] "HR-TEM images showed that the NiO particle size on high- surface area MgO was around 7 nm. Thus, highly dispersed NiO on HS-MgO is effective for the ODHE."

The document discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over NiO-loaded MgO catalysts with high surface area. At 600°C, without dilution with an inert gas, this process resulted in a 68.8% conversion of ethane with a high 52.8% selectivity for ethylene, leading to a 36.3% yield. The activity of the catalyst did not diminish over at least 10 hours. X-ray photoelectron spectra show that the initial valence state of Ni2+ (NiO) was preserved during the dehydrogenation. When the NiO/MgO was reduced with hydrogen before the reaction, ethylene selectivity dropped to almost zero, indicating that partial oxidation of ethane took place. It is crucial to maintain Ni species as an oxide phase on the support, with the high surface area of MgO being particularly beneficial for this reaction. The active phase for the oxidative dehydrogenation was identified as the NiO phase surrounded by a NiOMgO solid solution. HR-TEM images reveal that the NiO particles on high-surface area MgO were approximately 7 nm in size, confirming that highly dispersed NiO on HS-MgO is effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.

文献讨论了在高表面面积的NiO负载MgO催化剂上进行的乙烷氧化脱氢反应。在600°C下，不稀释惰性气体，此过程导致了68.8%的乙烷转化率和高达52.8%的乙烯选择性，对应于36.3%的乙烯产率。催化剂的活性至少保持了10小时。X射线光电子能谱显示，反应过程中Ni2+（NiO）的初始价态得以保持。当在反应前用氢气还原NiO/MgO时，乙烯选择性降至几乎为零，表明部分乙烷发生了氧化。维持Ni物种作为支持物上的氧化相至关重要，特别是使用高表面积的MgO对于这一反应非常有益。氧化脱氢作用的活性相被确认为NiO相包裹的NiOMgO固溶体。高分辨率透射电子显微镜图像显示，高表面面积MgO上的NiO颗粒约为7nm，这证实了在HS-MgO上高度分散的NiO对于乙烷的氧化脱氢是有效的。
