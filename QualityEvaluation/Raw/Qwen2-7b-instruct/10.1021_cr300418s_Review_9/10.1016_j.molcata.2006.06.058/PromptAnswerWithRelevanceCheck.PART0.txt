[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over NiO loaded on high surface area MgO was carried out using a fixed-bed flow reactor at 600 C under atmospheric pressure."
[2] "At 600 C, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C2H6/O2 = 1) without dilution with an inert gas resulted in C2H6 conversion of 68.8% and a high C2H4 selectivity of 52.8%, which corresponds to a C2H4 yield of 36.3%."
[3] "XRD, XPS, and H2-TPR revealed that NiO phase surrounded by NiOMgO solid solution was the active phase for the ODHE."
[4] "To keep Ni species as NiO, a high surface area of MgO was essential."
[5] "When the NiO was reduced to metallic Ni, the partial oxidation of ethane proceeded with high selectivity to CO and H2."
[6] "HR-TEM images showed that the NiO particle size on high-surface area MgO was around 7 nm."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the specific roles of these factors in determining the catalyst's activity, stability, and selectivity. The presence of a high surface area MgO support is crucial for maintaining the Ni species as NiO, which is the active phase for oxidative dehydrogenation. Reducing NiO to metallic Ni leads to partial oxidation of ethane with high selectivity to CO and H2. The HR-TEM images demonstrate that the NiO particle size on high-surface area MgO is approximately 7 nm, indicating that highly dispersed NiO is effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene.

[3] "In addition, the catalytic activity did not decrease for at least 10 h."
[4] "X-ray photoelectron spectra of the catalysts after the reaction exhibited that the initial valence state of Ni2+ (NiO) was maintained during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
[5] "When NiO-loaded MgO was reduced with H2 prior to the reaction, C2H4 selectivity decreased to nearly zero and high CO and H2 selectivities were observed with the C2H6 conversion of 50 %, indicating that partial oxidation of C2H6 proceeded."
[6] "Therefore, it seems important to keep Ni species as an oxide phase on the support, and for this purpose, use of the high surface area of MgO is essential."
[7] "The present study focused on the ODHE on NiO-loaded catalysts without dilution with an inert gas, and here we report that MgO with high surface area is a promising support for this reaction."

The document discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over NiO-loaded MgO catalysts with high surface area. At 600°C, without dilution with an inert gas, this process resulted in a 68.8% conversion of ethane with a high 52.8% selectivity for ethylene, leading to a 36.3% yield. The activity of the catalyst did not diminish over at least 10 hours. X-ray photoelectron spectra show that the initial valence state of Ni2+ (NiO) was preserved during the dehydrogenation. When the NiO/MgO was reduced with hydrogen before the reaction, ethylene selectivity dropped to almost zero, indicating that partial oxidation of ethane took place. It is crucial to maintain Ni species as an oxide phase on the support, with the high surface area of MgO being particularly beneficial for this reaction. The active phase for the oxidative dehydrogenation was identified as the NiO phase surrounded by a NiOMgO solid solution. HR-TEM images reveal that the NiO particles on high-surface area MgO were approximately 7 nm in size, confirming that highly dispersed NiO on HS-MgO is effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.

文献讨论了在高表面面积的NiO负载MgO催化剂上进行的乙烷氧化脱氢反应。在600°C下，不稀释惰性气体，此过程导致了68.8%的乙烷转化率和高达52.8%的乙烯选择性，对应于36.3%的乙烯产率。催化剂的活性至少保持了10小时。X射线光电子能谱显示，反应过程中Ni2+（NiO）的初始价态得以保持。当在反应前用氢气还原NiO/MgO时，乙烯选择性降至几乎为零，表明部分乙烷发生了氧化。维持Ni物种作为支持物上的氧化相至关重要，特别是使用高表面积的MgO对于这一反应非常有益。氧化脱氢作用的活性相被确认为NiO相包裹的NiOMgO固溶体。高分辨率透射电子显微镜图像显示，高表面面积MgO上的NiO颗粒约为7nm，这证实了在HS-MgO上高度分散的NiO对于乙烷的氧化脱氢是有效的。

The preparation of nickel oxide (NiO) catalysts on high-surface area magnesium oxide (MgO) supports plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHE) of ethane to ethylene. Key factors influencing the electronic structure and catalytic performance of these catalysts include the NiO phase surrounded by a NiOMgO solid solution, which acts as the active phase for the ODHE. To maintain Ni species in the form of NiO, the MgO support must have a high surface area. Reducing the NiO phase to metallic Ni leads to a high selectivity for the partial oxidation of ethane, favoring the production of CO and H2. High dispersion of NiO on the MgO surface, as demonstrated by HR-TEM images, contributes to the catalyst's superior performance in ethylene production through selective ODHE reactions.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The high surface area of magnesium oxide (MgO) is essential to maintain nickel species as nickel oxide (NiO), which acts as the active phase for oxidative dehydrogenation. Reducing NiO to metallic nickel leads to partial oxidation of ethane with high selectivity to carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2). The high dispersion of NiO on high-surface area MgO, as evidenced by HR-TEM images, is crucial for the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic system. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the detailed mechanisms of the reactions, optimizing the synthesis conditions to achieve high dispersion, and ensuring the stability and longevity of the catalyst under operational conditions.
