<p>The effect of calcination temperature on the catalytic performance of the ceria material was investigated. The best catalytic performance was obtained over the CeO2-450 sample under a high space velocity condition, affording a steady STY of 6.1 mmol-ST g 1 h1 at 450 C. The superior performance of CeO2-450 in the ODH of EB has been attributed to the high specific surface area and the well-developed mesostructure of this material. As a result, the ODH of EB could proceed much more effectively over the CeO2-450 sample with enhanced low temperature redox capacities, thus leading to the significant enhancement of its performance for the ODH of EB.</p>

The preparation method used, which involved a template-assisted precipitation method, resulted in mesostructured ceria materials with high surface areas. The calcination temperature significantly influenced the catalytic performance. The CeO2-450 sample, derived by calcining the material at 450°C, showed the highest performance. This was attributed to its high specific surface area and well-developed mesostructure, which allowed for enhanced low-temperature redox capabilities, leading to an improvement in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene.

采用模板辅助沉淀法制备的介孔结构铈氧化物材料具有高比表面积。煅烧温度对催化性能有显著影响。在450°C下煅烧得到的CeO2-450样品表现出最佳性能。这归因于其高比表面积和良好的介孔结构，这些特性使得乙基苯在低温下进行有效的氧化脱氢反应，从而提高了乙基苯转化为苯乙烯的性能。
