[1] "In this context, there is a great incentive to develop new robust catalyst applicable for the ODH of EB."
[2] "Nevertheless, the industrial application of the carbon-based catalysts has been till now prevented by their fine powder nature and intrinsically low resistance to combustion of the material."
[3] "The superior catalytic performance of the CeO2-450 sample can be attributed to its high specific surface area and enhanced redox properties as revealed by H2-TPR measurements."
[4] "The fact that no carbon deposits could be detected over the used CeO2-450 sample (see Fig. 7b) strongly indicates that the carbon deposits mechanism is not applicable for the present CeO2-catalyzed ODH of EB."
[5] "This indicates that the amount of surface lattice oxygen species on the ceria material contributes directly to the catalytic activity of CeO2 in the ODH of EB reaction, permitting a rational explanation for the negative effect of calcination temperature on the performance of the catalyst."

1. There is a strong motivation to create a durable catalyst suitable for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene (EB).
2. The industrial use of carbon-based catalysts has been hindered due to their fine particle size and susceptibility to combustion.
3. The high catalytic activity of the CeO2-450 sample is attributed to its large surface area and improved redox capabilities.
4. The absence of carbon deposits on the CeO2-450 sample indicates that the carbon deposit mechanism does not apply to this catalyst's ODH of EB process.
5. The correlation between the catalytic efficiency of the ceria catalyst and the hydrogen consumption of the low-temperature reduction peak suggests that the amount of surface lattice oxygen species directly influences the catalyst's activity in the ODH of EB reaction.
