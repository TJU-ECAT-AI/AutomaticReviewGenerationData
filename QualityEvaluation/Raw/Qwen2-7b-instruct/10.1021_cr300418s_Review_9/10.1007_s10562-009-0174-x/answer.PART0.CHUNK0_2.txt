[1] "A new type of mesostructured ceria material was synthesized via template-assisted precipitation method and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene to styrene by molecular oxygen."
[2] "Comparing the reaction rates for ODH of ethylbenzene (ca. 6.1 mmol ST g 1 cat h1 at 450 C) with the highly active nanostructured carbon-based catalysts in the current literature confirmed the very high activity of these new materials."
[3] "The effect of calcination temperature on the catalytic performances of the ceria catalysts has been investigated. Among the catalysts tested, the CeO2-450 sample derived by calcination at 450 C exhibited the highest ethylbenzene conversion (34%) and styrene selectivity (87%)."
[4] "The catalytic performance of CeO2-450 in the ODH of EB was also compared with those of other catalysts reported in the literature, as summarized in Table 3."
[5] "The fact that no carbon deposits could be detected over the used CeO2-450 sample (see Fig. 7b) strongly indicates that the carbon deposits mechanism is not applicable for the present CeO2-catalyzed ODH of EB."
[6] "This indicates that the amount of surface lattice oxygen species on the ceria material contributes directly to the catalytic activity of CeO2 in the ODH of EB reaction, permitting a rational explanation for the negative effect of calcination temperature on the performance of the catalyst."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts affect their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by influencing the availability of active sites for reactants and the reaction pathways. Key challenges in theoretical modeling involve accurately predicting the electronic structure and dynamic behavior of these catalysts under reaction conditions. Process optimization requires balancing factors such as reaction rate, selectivity, and product purity. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety necessitates careful control of operational parameters and understanding of potential side reactions. The high activity of the synthesized mesostructured ceria material for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene demonstrates the effectiveness of optimizing these aspects.
