[1] "The effect of calcination temperature on the catalytic performance of the ceria material was investigated. The best catalytic performance was obtained over the CeO2-450 sample under a high space velocity condition, affording a steady STY of 6.1 mmol-ST g 1 h1 at 450 C."
[2] "The variation in the H2 consumption of the LT reduction peak shows a good correlation with the corresponding EB conversion. This indicates that the amount of surface lattice oxygen species on the ceria material contributes directly to the catalytic activity of CeO2 in the ODH of EB reaction."
[3] "As a result, the ODH of EB could proceed much more effectively over the CeO2-450 sample with enhanced low temperature redox capacities, thus leading to the significant enhancement of its performance for the ODH of EB."

The preparation method and calcination temperature significantly influence the catalytic performance of ceria catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the CeO2-450 sample, prepared via a template-assisted precipitation method, showed the highest catalytic performance with an ethylbenzene conversion of 34.1%, styrene selectivity of 87.4%, and styrene yield of 29.8%. This superior performance is attributed to the high specific surface area and enhanced redox properties of the material, which facilitate the effective ODH of ethylbenzene.

The catalytic activity of the ceria catalysts correlates with the amount of surface lattice oxygen species, which contribute directly to the catalytic activity in the ODH of ethylbenzene reaction. The CeO2-450 sample, with its optimized surface area and redox properties, enables a more efficient and effective ODH of ethylbenzene, resulting in a steady styrene yield of 6.1 mmol-ST g 1 h1 at 450 C.

The challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the detailed mechanisms of the redox processes, predicting the optimal operating conditions, and ensuring the stability and longevity of the catalysts. The insights gained from the study of the CeO2-450 sample can guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

制备方法和煅烧温度对铈氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能产生显著影响。具体而言，通过模板辅助沉淀法制备的CeO2-450样品，在高空间速度条件下显示出最佳的催化性能，以450°C为反应温度时，乙基苯转化率为34.1%，苯乙烯选择性为87.4%，苯乙烯产率为29.8%。这种优异的性能归因于材料的高比表面积和增强的氧化还原性质，这使得乙基苯的氧化脱氢反应更加有效。

铈氧化物催化剂的催化活性与表面晶格氧物种的数量成正比，这些物种直接贡献到乙基苯氧化脱氢反应的催化活性中。CeO2-450样品，因其优化的表面面积和氧化还原性质，能够更有效地促进乙基苯的氧化脱氢反应，从而实现稳定的苯乙烯产率，即每克催化剂每小时产生6.1毫摩尔苯乙烯。

在理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的挑战包括理解还原过程的详细机制、预测最优操作条件以及确保催化剂的稳定性和寿命。从CeO2-450样品的研究中获得的见解可以指导开发更高效、选择性更高的催化剂用于氧化脱氢反应。
