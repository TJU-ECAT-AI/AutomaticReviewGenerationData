The catalytic performance of the CeO2-450 catalyst was compared with other catalysts in the literature. Under the conditions of 450°C and a total space velocity of 415 mL g 1 cat min1, the catalyst produced a reaction rate of 6.1 mmol ST g 1 cat h1 with a selectivity of 84% for styrene synthesis. This evaluation suggested that the CeO2-450 material, with its high surface area, could serve as an effective catalyst for styrene production through the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene.

在文献中，对CeO2-450催化剂的催化性能进行了比较。在450°C和总空速为415 mL g 1 cat min1的条件下，该催化剂产生的反应速率达到了6.1 mmol ST g 1 cat h1，而苯乙烯的选择性达到了84%。这一评估表明，具有高比表面积的CeO2-450材料可以作为乙基苯通过氧化脱氢制苯乙烯的有效催化剂。
