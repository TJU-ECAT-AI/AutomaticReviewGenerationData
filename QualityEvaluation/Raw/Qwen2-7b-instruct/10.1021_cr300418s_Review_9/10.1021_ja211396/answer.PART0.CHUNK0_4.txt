This research demonstrates that by doping oxide materials, one can manipulate the equilibrium shape of metal ad-particles on catalyst supports. For instance, introducing 4% molybdenum (Mo) into calcium oxide (CaO) changes the particle shapes from three-dimensional (3D) to two-dimensional (2D). Adding lithium (Li) to the Mo-doped CaO system alters the growth behavior significantly. The changes in the metal particle geometry can be attributed to charge-transfer processes between the dopants and the adsorbed metal. Specifically, the presence of Li+Mo3+ ion pairs, which are charge-compensated, prevents the modification of the metal growth behavior, restoring the original 3D growth regime.

这项研究展示了通过掺杂氧化物材料，可以调整支撑金属催化剂上的吸附粒子的平衡几何形状。例如，将4%的钼（Mo）引入钙氧化物（CaO）中会改变粒子形状从三维（3D）变为二维（2D）。在Mo掺杂的CaO系统中添加锂（Li）会显著改变生长行为。金属颗粒几何形状的变化可以归因于掺杂剂与吸附金属之间的电荷转移过程。具体而言，在Li+Mo3+离子对的存在下，这些离子对具有电荷补偿性，阻止了金属生长行为的修改，恢复了原始的3D生长模式。
