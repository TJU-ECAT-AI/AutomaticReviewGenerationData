The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Specifically, the introduction of overvalent Mo species into the catalysts leads to the growth of 2D metal islands, which are stabilized by an electron transfer from the impurity ions. Codoping with Li effectively blocks this charge exchange, as excess electrons are trapped by oxygen 2p-type holes created by the alkali dopants. Consequently, charge-compensated Li+Mo3+ ion pairs develop, which are unable to modify the Au growth behavior. The electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel oxide-based catalysts can be tailored through doping, demonstrating a method to control the equilibrium shape of ad-particles on supported metal catalysts.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，通过制备方法、掺杂浓度和缺陷形成，可以显著影响它们在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能。具体来说，向催化剂中引入过价Mo物种会导致金属岛从三维转变为二维，这些岛由杂质离子提供的电子稳定化。与Li共掺杂有效地阻止了这种电荷交换，因为多余的电子被氧2p型空位或结构电陷阱创建的空穴捕获。因此，形成了电荷补偿的Li+Mo3+离子对，无法改变Au生长行为。通过掺杂，可以控制支持金属催化剂上的颗粒形状，从而调整镍氧化物基催化剂的电子结构和催化性能。
