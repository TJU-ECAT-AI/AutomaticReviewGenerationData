This study showcases the potential of oxide doping to manipulate the equilibrium shape of metal adsorbates. By incorporating specific dopants like molybdenum (Mo) or lithium (Li) into calcium oxide (CaO) films, the researchers were able to induce a transition in the growth morphology of gold (Au) deposits. Specifically, the introduction of 4% Mo into the CaO lattice transforms the 3D growth pattern into a 2D island formation. Further addition of small quantities of Li to the Mo-doped CaO system reverts the growth behavior towards the initial 3D regime. These changes are attributed to charge transfer phenomena between the dopants and the ad-metal Au. Lithium, acting as an electron acceptor, creates electron traps within the oxide lattice, disrupting the electron flow towards the metal and consequently blocking the charge exchange process. This leads to the formation of charge-compensated Li+Mo3+ ion pairs that no longer influence the Au growth characteristics.

这项研究展示了氧化物掺杂如何利用控制金属吸附粒子的平衡形状的潜力。通过在钙酸盐（CaO）薄膜中加入特定的掺杂物，如钼（Mo）或锂（Li），研究人员能够诱导黄金（Au）沉积物生长形态的转变。具体来说，将4%的Mo引入CaO晶格中会将三维生长模式转变为二维岛形。进一步向Mo掺杂的CaO系统中添加少量Li会将生长行为恢复到初始的三维状态。这些变化归因于掺杂物和ad-金属Au之间的电荷转移现象。锂作为电子接受器，在氧化物晶体中形成电子陷阱，破坏了流向金属的电子流动，并且最终阻止了电荷交换过程。这导致形成电荷补偿的Li+Mo3+离子对，这些离子对不再影响Au的生长特性。
