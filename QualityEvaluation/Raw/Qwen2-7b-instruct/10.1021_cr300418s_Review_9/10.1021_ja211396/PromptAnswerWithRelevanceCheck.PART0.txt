The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene by altering the growth behavior of ad-particles. Specifically, Mo doping leads to the growth of 2D metal islands stabilized by electron transfer from impurity ions, while Li doping blocks this charge exchange by trapping excess electrons, thus restoring the original 3D growth regime of the ad-particles. This study demonstrates that oxide doping can be exploited to tailor the equilibrium geometry of ad-particles on supported metal catalysts, potentially improving their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, the challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems are not addressed in the provided literature.

公司X的工作表明，可以通过氧化物掺杂来调整支持金属催化剂上附着粒子的平衡几何形状。具体而言，在大多数批量氧化物中，附着金属的生长遵循沃勒-韦伯模式，产生紧凑的3D颗粒，具有较大的高度与直径比。将4%的Mo掺入CaO矩阵会改变颗粒形状从3D变为2D。向CaOMo中添加少量Li强烈改变了观察到的生长行为。Li掺杂有效地阻止了这种电荷交换，因为多余的电子被由碱性掺杂物产生的O 2p型空位捕获，从而恢复了原3D生长模式的附着颗粒。这项研究揭示了通过对氧化物支持进行掺杂来调整金属附着颗粒的几何形状的可能性，可能改善氧化脱氢反应如乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯的性能。然而，理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的挑战在提供的文献中没有得到解决。

1. This research demonstrates that oxide doping can be utilized to adjust the equilibrium shape of ad-particles on metal catalysts, particularly affecting their size and morphology.

2. The relevance of flat metal deposits has been emphasized by multiple authors for various chemical reactions.

3. On many bulk oxides, the deposition of ad-metals typically follows the VolmerWeber regime, leading to compact three-dimensional particles with a high height-to-diameter ratio.

4. Monolayer island formation has been observed on certain thin-film supports, which is facilitated by a spontaneous charge transfer into the ad-islands, thereby strengthening the metal-oxide bonding.

5. Dopants, such as lithium (Li) and molybdenum (Mo), introduce electron traps within the oxide lattice that disrupt the electron flow towards the metal surface.

6. This study highlights that modifying the oxide support through doping offers a method to control the equilibrium geometry of ad-particles on metal catalysts.

7. The use of dopants can lead to the creation of electron traps within the oxide lattice, which in turn interrupts the charge flow towards the metal, influencing the growth behavior of ad-particles.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Specifically, the introduction of overvalent Mo species into the catalysts leads to the growth of 2D metal islands, which are stabilized by an electron transfer from the impurity ions. Codoping with Li effectively blocks this charge exchange, as excess electrons are trapped by oxygen 2p-type holes created by the alkali dopants. Consequently, charge-compensated Li+Mo3+ ion pairs develop, which are unable to modify the Au growth behavior. The electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel oxide-based catalysts can be tailored through doping, demonstrating a method to control the equilibrium shape of ad-particles on supported metal catalysts.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，通过制备方法、掺杂浓度和缺陷形成，可以显著影响它们在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能。具体来说，向催化剂中引入过价Mo物种会导致金属岛从三维转变为二维，这些岛由杂质离子提供的电子稳定化。与Li共掺杂有效地阻止了这种电荷交换，因为多余的电子被氧2p型空位或结构电陷阱创建的空穴捕获。因此，形成了电荷补偿的Li+Mo3+离子对，无法改变Au生长行为。通过掺杂，可以控制支持金属催化剂上的颗粒形状，从而调整镍氧化物基催化剂的电子结构和催化性能。

This study showcases the potential of oxide doping to manipulate the equilibrium shape of metal adsorbates. By incorporating specific dopants like molybdenum (Mo) or lithium (Li) into calcium oxide (CaO) films, the researchers were able to induce a transition in the growth morphology of gold (Au) deposits. Specifically, the introduction of 4% Mo into the CaO lattice transforms the 3D growth pattern into a 2D island formation. Further addition of small quantities of Li to the Mo-doped CaO system reverts the growth behavior towards the initial 3D regime. These changes are attributed to charge transfer phenomena between the dopants and the ad-metal Au. Lithium, acting as an electron acceptor, creates electron traps within the oxide lattice, disrupting the electron flow towards the metal and consequently blocking the charge exchange process. This leads to the formation of charge-compensated Li+Mo3+ ion pairs that no longer influence the Au growth characteristics.

这项研究展示了氧化物掺杂如何利用控制金属吸附粒子的平衡形状的潜力。通过在钙酸盐（CaO）薄膜中加入特定的掺杂物，如钼（Mo）或锂（Li），研究人员能够诱导黄金（Au）沉积物生长形态的转变。具体来说，将4%的Mo引入CaO晶格中会将三维生长模式转变为二维岛形。进一步向Mo掺杂的CaO系统中添加少量Li会将生长行为恢复到初始的三维状态。这些变化归因于掺杂物和ad-金属Au之间的电荷转移现象。锂作为电子接受器，在氧化物晶体中形成电子陷阱，破坏了流向金属的电子流动，并且最终阻止了电荷交换过程。这导致形成电荷补偿的Li+Mo3+离子对，这些离子对不再影响Au的生长特性。

This research demonstrates that by doping oxide materials, one can manipulate the equilibrium shape of metal ad-particles on catalyst supports. For instance, introducing 4% molybdenum (Mo) into calcium oxide (CaO) changes the particle shapes from three-dimensional (3D) to two-dimensional (2D). Adding lithium (Li) to the Mo-doped CaO system alters the growth behavior significantly. The changes in the metal particle geometry can be attributed to charge-transfer processes between the dopants and the adsorbed metal. Specifically, the presence of Li+Mo3+ ion pairs, which are charge-compensated, prevents the modification of the metal growth behavior, restoring the original 3D growth regime.
