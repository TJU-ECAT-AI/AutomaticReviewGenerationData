1. This research demonstrates that oxide doping can be utilized to adjust the equilibrium shape of ad-particles on metal catalysts, particularly affecting their size and morphology.

2. The relevance of flat metal deposits has been emphasized by multiple authors for various chemical reactions.

3. On many bulk oxides, the deposition of ad-metals typically follows the VolmerWeber regime, leading to compact three-dimensional particles with a high height-to-diameter ratio.

4. Monolayer island formation has been observed on certain thin-film supports, which is facilitated by a spontaneous charge transfer into the ad-islands, thereby strengthening the metal-oxide bonding.

5. Dopants, such as lithium (Li) and molybdenum (Mo), introduce electron traps within the oxide lattice that disrupt the electron flow towards the metal surface.

6. This study highlights that modifying the oxide support through doping offers a method to control the equilibrium geometry of ad-particles on metal catalysts.

7. The use of dopants can lead to the creation of electron traps within the oxide lattice, which in turn interrupts the charge flow towards the metal, influencing the growth behavior of ad-particles.
