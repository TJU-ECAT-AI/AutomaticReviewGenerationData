The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene by altering the growth behavior of ad-particles. Specifically, Mo doping leads to the growth of 2D metal islands stabilized by electron transfer from impurity ions, while Li doping blocks this charge exchange by trapping excess electrons, thus restoring the original 3D growth regime of the ad-particles. This study demonstrates that oxide doping can be exploited to tailor the equilibrium geometry of ad-particles on supported metal catalysts, potentially improving their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, the challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems are not addressed in the provided literature.

公司X的工作表明，可以通过氧化物掺杂来调整支持金属催化剂上附着粒子的平衡几何形状。具体而言，在大多数批量氧化物中，附着金属的生长遵循沃勒-韦伯模式，产生紧凑的3D颗粒，具有较大的高度与直径比。将4%的Mo掺入CaO矩阵会改变颗粒形状从3D变为2D。向CaOMo中添加少量Li强烈改变了观察到的生长行为。Li掺杂有效地阻止了这种电荷交换，因为多余的电子被由碱性掺杂物产生的O 2p型空位捕获，从而恢复了原3D生长模式的附着颗粒。这项研究揭示了通过对氧化物支持进行掺杂来调整金属附着颗粒的几何形状的可能性，可能改善氧化脱氢反应如乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯的性能。然而，理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的挑战在提供的文献中没有得到解决。
