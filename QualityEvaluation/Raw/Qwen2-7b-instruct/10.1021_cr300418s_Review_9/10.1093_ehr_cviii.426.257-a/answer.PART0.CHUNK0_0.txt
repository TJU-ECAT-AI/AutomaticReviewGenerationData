[1] "Robert H. Whealey's Hitler and Spain: The Nazi Role in the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939 provides a wealth of information concerning the origins and development of German military and economic aid to Nationalist Spain."
[2] "Whealey first outlines the origins of Hitler's involvement, beginning with the interest which certain parts of the German military machine had shown in Spain before 1936."
[3] "However, despite the existence of this interest, which centred on the naval aid which Spain might afford Germany in the event of a war with France, the author believes that Hitler responded to the Nationalists' pleas for help for reasons that were political rather than military."
[4] "The presence of military and economic motives for intervention is not denied, but, as Whealey shows in the concise summary of its development which constitutes the remainder of the work, their potential was only realized after the initial decision to aid Franco had been taken."
[5] "This valuable addition to the historiography of the Civil War successfully meets its main objectives."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hitler's involvement in the Spanish Civil War, as detailed in Robert H. Whealey's book, was initially driven by political motives rather than purely military ones. The interest in Spain stemmed from the potential naval aid Spain could offer Germany in case of a conflict with France. Despite this, Hitler's decision to aid the Nationalists was influenced by the desire to exploit the conflict as an anti-Communist crusade, aiming to deepen divisions between Britain and France, undermine the Franco-Russian alliance, and strengthen ties with Italy and Japan. The book offers a comprehensive account of the origins, development, and impact of German military and economic aid to Nationalist Spain during the civil war.

在罗伯特·H·韦利的书中详细描述，希特勒参与西班牙内战最初是由政治动机而非纯粹军事动机驱动的。对西班牙的兴趣源自西班牙可能在法国与德国发生冲突时提供的海军援助。尽管如此，希特勒援助国家主义者的决定受到了利用这场冲突作为反共十字军的欲望的影响，旨在加深英法之间的分歧，破坏法俄联盟，并加强与意大利和日本的关系。这本书提供了内战期间德国军事和经济援助给西班牙国家主义者起源、发展和影响的全面记录。
