[1] "Robert H. Whealey's Hitler and Spain: The Nazi Role in the Spanish Civil War, 19J6-19J9 (Lexington: U. P. of Kentucky,1989; pp. ix + 269. $24) has now rectified that omission, providing the student with a wealth of information concerning the origins and development of German military and economic aid to Nationalist Spain."
[2] "Whealey first outlines the origins of Hitler's involvement, beginning with the interest which certain parts of the German military machine had shown in Spain before 1936."
[3] "However, despite the existence of this interest, which centred on the naval aid which Spain might afford Germany in the event of a war with France, the author believes that Hitler responded to the Nationalists' pleas for help for reasons that were political rather than military."
[4] "The presence of military and economic motives for intervention is not denied, but, as Whealey shows in the concise summary of its development which constitutes the remainder of the work, their potential was only realized after the initial decision to aid Franco had been taken."
[5] "Yet the picture is not wholly positive. Its footnotes (57 pages compared with 142 of actual text) are so copious that they have left insufficient space for argument, the result being that the author's thinking is sometimes difficult to follow."
[6] "Several points might also have been taken further: mention is made, for example, of the fabled tank and artillery units of the Condor Legion, but, whilst lamenting their obscurity, Whealey has failed to verify their existence, which is a matter of some doubt."
[7] "Factual errors also appear: it is surprising to learn that 'in July-August 1938 the Nationalists opened the offensive on the Ebro to wipe out the leftists of Catalonia'."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems often involve accurately predicting how these factors interact and affect the reaction pathways. The specific details provided in the literature do not address these questions directly.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响其在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能。这些催化系统的理论建模、过程优化以及平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战通常涉及准确预测这些因素如何相互作用并影响反应途径。文献中提供的具体细节并未直接回答这些问题。
