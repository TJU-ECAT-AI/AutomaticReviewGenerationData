[1] "Robert H. Whealey's Hitler and Spain: The Nazi Role in the Spanish Civil War, 19J6-19J9 (Lexington: U. P. of Kentucky,1989; pp. ix + 269. $24) has now rectified that omission, providing the student with a wealth of information concerning the origins and development of German military and economic aid to Nationalist Spain."
[2] "The picture is not wholly positive. Its footnotes (57 pages compared with 142 of actual text) are so copious that they have left insufficient space for argument, the result being that the author's thinking is sometimes difficult to follow."
[3] "This valuable addition to the historiography of the Civil War successfully meets its main objectives."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The book "Hitler and Spain: The Nazi Role in the Spanish Civil War" by Robert H. Whealey provides a wealth of information about the origins and development of German military and economic aid to Nationalist Spain. It rectifies the omission of an independent monograph on the subject in English language. However, the copious footnotes leave insufficient space for argument, making the author's thinking sometimes difficult to follow.

《希特勒与西班牙：纳粹在西班牙内战中的角色》一书由罗伯特·H·韦利提供，详细阐述了德国对西班牙民族主义者的军事和经济援助的起源和发展。它填补了英语语言中这一主题独立专著的空白。然而，庞大的脚注留下了不足以进行论证的空间，使得作者的思想有时难以理解。
