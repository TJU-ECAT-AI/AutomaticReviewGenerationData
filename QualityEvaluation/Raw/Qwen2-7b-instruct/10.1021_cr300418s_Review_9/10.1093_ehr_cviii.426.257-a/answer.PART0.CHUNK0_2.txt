Answer: The book by Robert H. Whealey titled "Hitler and Spain: The Nazi Role in the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939" provides a detailed account of the origins and development of German military and economic aid to Nationalist Spain during the Spanish Civil War. It addresses the reasons behind Hitler's involvement, initially driven by military interests in securing naval aid from Spain in case of a war with France. However, the author argues that Hitler's decision to aid the Nationalists was primarily political, aiming to exploit the conflict as an anti-Communist crusade to deepen divisions between Britain and France, undermine the Franco-Russian alliance, and strengthen ties with Italy and Japan. The book is praised for its thorough research and new information, though it is noted for having extensive footnotes that may make it challenging to follow the author's arguments.

书《希特勒与西班牙：纳粹在西班牙内战中的角色，1936-1939》（罗伯特·H·惠莱利著；肯塔基大学出版社，1989年出版；pp. ix + 269页。售价$24）已经填补了这一空白，为学生提供了关于德国军事和经济援助到西班牙民族主义者起源和发展的重要信息。书中首先概述了希特勒参与的起源，始于1936年前德国军方对西班牙的兴趣。这种兴趣主要集中在西班牙可能在与法国战争中为德国提供的海军援助上。然而，作者认为，希特勒响应西班牙民族主义者求助的原因主要是政治而非军事。该书因其详尽的研究和新信息而受到好评，但也因其脚注过多（共57页，而正文只有142页），导致缺乏足够的空间进行论述，使得作者的思考有时难以理解。

Robert H. Whealey's book contributes to the understanding of the Spanish Civil War by detailing the historical context of German involvement, particularly focusing on the military and political motivations behind Hitler's decision to support the Nationalists. By exploring the initial interest of certain parts of the German military in Spain's naval capabilities, the book offers insight into how these interests were translated into broader political objectives, such as exploiting the conflict as an anti-Communist crusade to deepen divisions between Britain and France, undermine the Franco-Russian alliance, and strengthen ties with Italy and Japan. This analysis provides a nuanced view of the complex factors influencing international intervention in the Spanish Civil War.

罗伯特·H·惠莱利的书籍通过详细描述德国参与的历史背景，特别是希特勒支持民族主义者的动机，为理解西班牙内战做出了贡献。本书特别关注德国军事对西班牙海上能力的兴趣，提供了如何将这些兴趣转化为更广泛的具有政治目的的洞察力的视角。例如，利用这场冲突作为反共产主义的十字军来加深英法之间的分歧、破坏法俄联盟并加强与意大利和日本的关系。这一分析为西班牙内战复杂因素影响国际介入提供了深入的见解。
