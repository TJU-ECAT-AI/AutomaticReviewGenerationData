[1] "Robert H. Whealey's Hitler and Spain: The Nazi Role in the Spanish Civil War, 19J6-19J9 (Lexington: U. P. of Kentucky,1989; pp. ix + 269. $24) has now rectified that omission, providing the student with a wealth of information concerning the origins and development of German military and economic aid to Nationalist Spain."
[2] "The presence of military and economic motives for intervention is not denied, but, as Whealey shows in the concise summary of its development which constitutes the remainder of the work, their potential was only realized after the initial decision to aid Franco had been taken."
[3] "This valuable addition to the historiography of the Civil War successfully meets its main objectives."
[4] "Negotiating Freer Trade: The United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and the Trade Agree- ments of ipj8 (Waterloo, Ont.: Wilfrid Laurier U.P., 1989; pp. x + 197. Can $29.95), by two distinguished Canadian historians, Ian M. Drummond and Nor- man Hillmer, deals briskly with such assertions."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions through various mechanisms. Higher dopant concentrations can enhance the conductivity and stability of the catalyst, affecting its electronic properties and thus its activity in the reaction. Vacancy formation, often resulting from thermal or chemical treatments, can lead to increased surface area and active sites, improving the catalyst's performance. However, excessive vacancies may lead to decreased stability and selectivity. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the complex interactions between the catalyst's structure and the reaction environment, optimizing parameters for maximum efficiency and selectivity, and ensuring safety during operation. Process optimization requires balancing factors such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition to achieve optimal conditions for the desired product yield.
