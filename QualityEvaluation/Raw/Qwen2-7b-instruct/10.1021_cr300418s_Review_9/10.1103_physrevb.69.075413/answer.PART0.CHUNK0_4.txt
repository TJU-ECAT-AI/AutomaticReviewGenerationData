The strong on-site correlations lead to a qualitative change in the adsorption behavior of CO on NiO. A pure DFT LSDA or SGGA approach predicts a strong-binding situation with an upright adsorption geometry, while the SGGA calculation achieves an adsorption geometry and energy that match experimental data perfectly. This outcome is attained using the same on-site Coulomb potential utilized in bulk calculations. The weak binding and tilting of the molecule away from the surface normal are attributed to the increased exchange splitting of the Ni-d states, which significantly diminishes the 2p*-(dzx1dzy) interaction and promotes a 1p-dz2 hybridization favoring the tilted geometry.

强本征相互作用导致CO在NiO上的吸附行为发生质的变化。纯DFT LSDA或SGGA方法预测了强烈的结合情况和直立的吸附几何形状，而SGGA计算实现了与实验数据完全一致的吸附几何形状和能量。这一结果使用了在本体计算中使用的相同的本征库仑势实现。弱结合和分子远离表面法线方向的倾斜是由Ni-d能级的增强交换分裂引起的，这显著减少了2p*-(dzx1dzy)相互作用，并促进了有利于倾斜几何形状的1p-dz2杂化。
