[1] "The comparison of the measured bond lengths and adsorption energies of the same species on a metallic Ni surface demonstrated that the adsorption on the surface of the TMO is much weaker than on a metallic surface."
[2] "The aim of the present work is twofold. i! We have implemented the DFT1U method in its ro- tationally invariant form proposed by Liechtenstein et al.16 in a full-potential electronic structure code @the Vienna ab initio simulation package3337 VASP!#. In this form the DFT1U Hamiltonian is based on the full all-electron orbit- als and densities."
[3] "The SGGA1U approach implemented in VASP has been used to investigate the physical properties of bulk NiO and of clean NiO100! surfaces, and to perform a detailed inves- tigation of the adsorption of CO molecules on this surface."
[4] "In both the LSDA and SGGA, any tilting of the molecule from a perpendicular position is energetically unfavorable."
[5] "Only if the on-site Coulomb repulsion is added to the DFT functional, tilting was found to be energetically stable in both @010# and @001# directions, with a tilt towards the oxygen atom @001# direc- tion! in the surface plane being energetically less stable than a tilt towards the nickel atom @010# direction!"

1. The adsorption of certain molecules on transition-metal oxides (TMOs) is significantly weaker compared to metallic surfaces, as evidenced by the bond lengths and energies measured.
2. The DFT1U method, particularly in its rotational invariant form, was implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) to study the physical properties of bulk materials and surfaces.
3. The SGGA1U approach, which combines the SGGA with the on-site Coulomb repulsion term, was utilized to explore the adsorption of CO molecules on a NiO100 surface.
4. In the DFT calculations conducted in the LSDA and SGGA frameworks, any tilting of the adsorbed molecule away from the perpendicular position was found to be energetically unfavorable.
5. By incorporating the on-site Coulomb repulsion term into the DFT functional, the calculations revealed that tilting towards the oxygen atom in the surface plane was energetically less favorable compared to tilting towards the nickel atom.

1. 在过渡金属氧化物（TMO）上吸附某些分子时，其与金属表面相比表现出显著的弱吸附性，这是通过测量的键长和能量得到证实的。
2. 特别是在维也纳原位模拟包（VASP）中实现了旋转不变形式的DFT1U方法，以研究材料的物理性质和表面性质。
3. SGGA1U方法，结合了SGGA和局域电荷之间的库仑排斥项，被用来探索CO分子在NiO100表面的吸附。
4. 在基于LSDA和SGGA框架的计算中，发现任何将吸附分子倾斜离开垂直位置的做法都是从能效的角度不利的。
5. 通过将局域电荷之间的库仑排斥项引入到DFT函数中，计算结果表明，相对于倾斜至镍原子方向而言，倾斜至氧原子表面平面方向在能效方面更不有利。
