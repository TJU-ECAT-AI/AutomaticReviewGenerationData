[1] "It is well known that the physical properties of some transition-metal compounds mostly oxides! are strongly affected by intra-atomic correlations."
[2] "Very recently, investigations of the adsorption of small mol- ecules such as CO on the surfaces of transition-metal oxides have led to rather surprising results: the weak adsorbate-substrate bonding and the asymmetric tilted! adsorption geometries contrast sharply the strong bonding and symmetric geometries characteristic for metallic surfaces."
[3] "Calculations based on either Hartree- Fock or density-functional methods have failed to explain these observations."
[4] "For bulk transition-metal oxides it has been demonstrated that the addition of a Hubbard-type on-site Coulomb repulsion U to the local-density Hamiltonian leads to an improved description of the electronic structure of these materials, but a consistent description of all physical properties proved to be elusive."
[5] "In the present work, we present a comprehensive investigation of bulk NiO and of clean and CO-covered NiO100! surfaces. We demonstrate that adding the on-site Coulomb repulsion to the spin-polarized gradient-corrected density-functional Hamiltonian leads to a consistently improved description of a wide range of cohesive, electronic, and magnetic properties of NiO bulk and surface! and a very accurate description of the adsorption properties of CO."
[6] "The effects of the strong electronic correlations in the substrate on the adsorbate-substrate bonding are discussed in detail."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the creation of reactive sites and the ability to facilitate electron transfer. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately representing the complex electronic structure, predicting the stability and reactivity of intermediates, and understanding the kinetic processes involved in the reactions. Process optimization requires balancing the rate of reaction with the selectivity of products and ensuring the safety of the operation. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety involves developing models that can predict the performance of the catalyst under various operating conditions, optimizing the reaction parameters, and incorporating robustness against variations in feedstock quality and process variables.

In the context of nickel oxide surfaces, the addition of a Hubbard-type on-site Coulomb repulsion U to the local-density Hamiltonian has proven effective in improving the description of the electronic structure and adsorption properties. This method accounts for the strong intra-atomic correlations that are typical in transition-metal oxides, leading to a more accurate prediction of the physical properties and the adsorption behavior of molecules like CO. The detailed discussion of the effects of strong electronic correlations on the adsorbate-substrate bonding highlights the importance of considering these interactions in the development of theoretical models for catalytic systems.

在镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成中，影响其在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能的关键因素包括创建活性位点的能力以及促进电子转移的能力。理论建模的主要挑战在于准确地表示复杂的电子结构、预测中间体的稳定性和反应性，并理解参与反应的过程。过程优化需要平衡反应速率与产物选择性，并确保操作的安全性。在平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面，需要开发能够预测催化剂在各种操作条件下性能的模型、优化反应参数，并考虑对原料质量和过程变量变化的鲁棒性。

对于镍氧化物表面而言，在局部密度哈密顿量中添加一种Hubbard类型的局域电荷斥力U，已证明对改善电子结构和吸附性质描述的有效性。这种方法可以有效地处理过渡金属氧化物中典型的强原子内关联，从而更准确地预测物理性质和分子如CO的吸附行为。详细讨论强电子关联对吸附剂-基底键合的影响强调了在催化系统的发展中考虑这些相互作用的重要性。
