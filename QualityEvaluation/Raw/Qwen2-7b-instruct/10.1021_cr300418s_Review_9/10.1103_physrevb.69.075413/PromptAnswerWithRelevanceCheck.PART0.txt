[1] "The comparison of the measured bond lengths and adsorption energies of the same species on a metallic Ni surface demonstrated that the adsorption on the surface of the TMO is much weaker than on a metallic surface."
[2] "The aim of the present work is twofold. i! We have implemented the DFT1U method in its ro- tationally invariant form proposed by Liechtenstein et al.16 in a full-potential electronic structure code @the Vienna ab initio simulation package3337 VASP!#. In this form the DFT1U Hamiltonian is based on the full all-electron orbit- als and densities."
[3] "The SGGA1U approach implemented in VASP has been used to investigate the physical properties of bulk NiO and of clean NiO100! surfaces, and to perform a detailed inves- tigation of the adsorption of CO molecules on this surface."
[4] "In both the LSDA and SGGA, any tilting of the molecule from a perpendicular position is energetically unfavorable."
[5] "Only if the on-site Coulomb repulsion is added to the DFT functional, tilting was found to be energetically stable in both @010# and @001# directions, with a tilt towards the oxygen atom @001# direc- tion! in the surface plane being energetically less stable than a tilt towards the nickel atom @010# direction!"

The DFT1U approach, which incorporates a Hubbard term to account for strong on-site Coulomb interactions, provides a more consistent and accurate description of the physical properties of bulk NiO, clean and CO-covered NiO100 surfaces, compared to traditional density-functional theory methods. The SGGA1U variant of this approach, in particular, leads to better predictions of the band gap, magnetic moments, and binding energies, as well as a good description of the clean NiO surface. This method also demonstrates its capability in accurately predicting the adsorption properties of CO on NiO surfaces, including the adsorption geometry and energy, in agreement with experimental data. The SGGA1U approach is found to be comparable to hybrid functional methods in describing bulk NiO properties, and the B3LYP functional predicts a reasonable Ni-C bond length for CO adsorption but an almost unbound CO molecule. Overall, the DFT1U approach offers a promising strategy for understanding the properties and behavior of strongly correlated transition-metal compounds and their surfaces.

DFT1U方法，通过加入描述强局域电荷相互作用的Hubbard项，对NiO的体相、清洁和CO覆盖的NiO100表面的物理性质提供了更为一致且准确的描述，相比传统的密度泛函理论方法。特别是SGGA1U这一变种，在预测带隙、磁矩和结合能方面表现出更好的性能，并且能够很好地描述清洁的NiO表面。这种方法还展示了在NiO表面上CO吸附性质的准确预测能力，包括吸附几何结构和能量，与实验数据一致。SGGA1U方法在描述NiO体相性质上与混合函数方法相当，而B3LYP功能预测CO吸附时得到合理的Ni-C键长，但CO分子几乎不受束缚。总的来说，DFT1U方法为理解强相关过渡金属化合物及其表面的性质提供了一个有前景的策略。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involve accurately predicting how these factors affect the electronic properties and reaction pathways. The document demonstrates that a DFT1U approach can provide a comprehensive strategy for understanding both the bulk properties and molecular adsorption on surfaces of transition-metal oxides, offering insights into optimizing catalyst performance.

The main challenges include:
1. Balancing the effects of preparation methods and dopants on the electronic structure and reactivity of nickel oxide catalysts. This requires precise control over parameters such as temperature, pressure, and chemical composition during synthesis.
2. Optimizing process conditions to maximize catalytic efficiency and selectivity while maintaining safety. This involves finding the right balance between reaction rates and product purity, which can be influenced by factors like reaction temperature, pressure, and catalyst loading.
3. Predicting the impact of vacancies and defects on the catalytic activity and stability of nickel oxide catalysts. Understanding these mechanisms can guide the design of more robust catalysts with enhanced performance and longevity.

By employing advanced theoretical methods like DFT1U, researchers can gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms governing the behavior of nickel oxide-based catalysts. This knowledge can facilitate the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, leading to advancements in industries such as petrochemical processing and fine chemicals production.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the creation of reactive sites and the ability to facilitate electron transfer. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately representing the complex electronic structure, predicting the stability and reactivity of intermediates, and understanding the kinetic processes involved in the reactions. Process optimization requires balancing the rate of reaction with the selectivity of products and ensuring the safety of the operation. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety involves developing models that can predict the performance of the catalyst under various operating conditions, optimizing the reaction parameters, and incorporating robustness against variations in feedstock quality and process variables.

In the context of nickel oxide surfaces, the addition of a Hubbard-type on-site Coulomb repulsion U to the local-density Hamiltonian has proven effective in improving the description of the electronic structure and adsorption properties. This method accounts for the strong intra-atomic correlations that are typical in transition-metal oxides, leading to a more accurate prediction of the physical properties and the adsorption behavior of molecules like CO. The detailed discussion of the effects of strong electronic correlations on the adsorbate-substrate bonding highlights the importance of considering these interactions in the development of theoretical models for catalytic systems.

[1] "The strong on-site correlations lead to a qualitative change in the adsorption behavior of CO on NiO."
[2] "While a pure DFT LSDA or SGGA! approach predicts a strong-binding situation and an upright adsorption geometry, the SGGA calculation leads to an adsorption geometry and energy in perfect agreement with experiment."
[3] "This is achieved with the same value of the on-site Coulomb potential that has been used in the bulk calculations."
[4] "The weak binding and the tilting of the molecule away from the surface normal are shown to result from the increased exchange splitting of the Ni-d states, which largely suppresses the 2p*-(dzx1dzy) interaction and enables a 1p-dz2 hybridization favoring the tilted geometry."

The strong on-site correlations lead to a qualitative change in the adsorption behavior of CO on NiO. A pure DFT LSDA or SGGA approach predicts a strong-binding situation with an upright adsorption geometry, while the SGGA calculation achieves an adsorption geometry and energy that match experimental data perfectly. This outcome is attained using the same on-site Coulomb potential utilized in bulk calculations. The weak binding and tilting of the molecule away from the surface normal are attributed to the increased exchange splitting of the Ni-d states, which significantly diminishes the 2p*-(dzx1dzy) interaction and promotes a 1p-dz2 hybridization favoring the tilted geometry.

强本征相互作用导致CO在NiO上的吸附行为发生质的变化。纯DFT LSDA或SGGA方法预测了强烈的结合情况和直立的吸附几何形状，而SGGA计算实现了与实验数据完全一致的吸附几何形状和能量。这一结果使用了在本体计算中使用的相同的本征库仑势实现。弱结合和分子远离表面法线方向的倾斜是由Ni-d能级的增强交换分裂引起的，这显著减少了2p*-(dzx1dzy)相互作用，并促进了有利于倾斜几何形状的1p-dz2杂化。
