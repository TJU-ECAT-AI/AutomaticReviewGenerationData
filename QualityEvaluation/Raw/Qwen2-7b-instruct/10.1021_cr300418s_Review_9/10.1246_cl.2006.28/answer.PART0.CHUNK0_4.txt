[1] "The components of reaction mixtures were analyzed by on-line gas chromatograph."
[2] "The VSb/Al and VSb/MgnAl catalysts are highly selective with respect to styrene (>95%)."
[3] "However, considering the difference in their SBET values (87 and 67 m2/g, respectively), the VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst can be regarded as a little more active one due to its higher specific yield based on the SBET value (YST/SBET), 1.1%/m2 against 0.9%/m2 for the VSb/Al."
[4] "The activities of the supported VSb oxide catalysts in the CO2-EBDH are mainly determined by the sup-ported VOx species whereas the presence of SbOx positively affects the catalyst stability through the facilitation of the redox cycle."
[5] "When we checked the content of carbon formation on each catalyst after 12 h on stream, we observed that Mg-modified catalysts reveal less carbon formation (4.4–6.0 wt %) as compared with VSb/Al (13.1 wt %), indicating that modification of alumina support with magnesia leads to the stable activity, at least partly, due to strong resistance against carbon formation."
[6] "As illustrated in NH3-TPD profiles (Figure 2), the VSb/ MgnAl catalysts contain smaller amounts of surface acid sites compared with the un-modified VSb/Al catalyst. Thus, the higher Mg-content leads to the lower acidity."
[7] "According to XRD patterns (Figure 3), both Mg0:1Al support and VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst do not contain a free crystalline MgO phase. Instead they showed a fully incorporated into spinel-like binary oxide phase, MgAl6O10. However, a crystal- line MgO is distinctively observed in the Mg0:3Al and Mg0:5Al whose major phase is MgAl2O4."
[8] "This result implies the stronger inter- action between acidic VSb oxide and MgnAl support materials while using a large content of basic MgO in catalyst preparation."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts affect their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The stability and activity of the catalysts are influenced by the balance between decreased acidity of the VSb oxide catalyst supported on MgO-modified alumina and the amount of VSb oxide species. The MgO dopant concentration plays a crucial role in controlling the surface acidity, which impacts the stability and activity of the catalysts. Higher MgO content leads to reduced surface acidities, contributing to better stability. The specific surface areas of the catalysts decrease with an increase in MgO-content, affecting their specific activities. The catalytic performance is mainly determined by the supported VOx species, with the presence of SbOx positively affecting the catalyst stability through facilitating the redox cycle. The Mg-modified catalysts show less carbon formation, indicating strong resistance against carbon formation. The theoretical modeling faces challenges in accurately predicting the complex interactions between the catalysts and reactants, optimizing the process parameters, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.

镍氧化物基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能受到其制备方法、掺杂浓度以及空位形成的影响。催化剂的稳定性和活性受到支持在镁改性氧化铝上的VSb氧化物的酸度降低和VSb氧化物物种数量之间的平衡的影响。镁氧含量的增加导致表面酸度降低，从而改善了催化剂的稳定性。催化剂的特定表面积随着镁氧含量的增加而减小，影响它们的特定活性。催化剂的催化性能主要由支持的VOx物种决定，SbOx的存在通过促进氧化还原循环对催化剂稳定性有积极影响。改性的镁催化剂表现出较少的碳形成，表明具有较强的抗碳形成能力。理论建模面临挑战，需要准确预测催化剂与反应物之间的复杂相互作用，优化过程参数，并在这些催化系统中平衡效率、选择性和安全性。
