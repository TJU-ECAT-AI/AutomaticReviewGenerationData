<p>The components of reaction mixtures were analyzed by on-line gas chromatograph.</p>
<p>VSty/Mg0:1Al sample showed similar initial styrene yield, YST  75 mol % after 1 h on-stream.</p>
<p>When we checked the content of carbon formation on each catalyst after 12 h on stream, we observed that Mg-modified catalysts reveal less carbon formation (4.4–6.0 wt %) as compared with VSb/Al (13.1 wt %).</p>
<p>This result implies the stronger interaction between acidic VSb oxide and MgnAl support materials while using a large content of basic MgO in catalyst preparation.</p>
<p>In summary, this work demonstrates that a favorable balance between the decreased acidity of the VSb oxide catalyst supported on MgO-modified alumina and an amount of VSb oxide species is needed for the stable and active catalytic performance in the CO2-EBDH.</p>

1. The MgO-modified alumina catalysts showed enhanced stability and activity in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of CO2, likely due to reduced surface acidity and facilitated olefin desorption. 

2. The specific surface area of the catalysts decreased with increasing MgO content, but this had only a slight effect on their specific activities. The activity of the catalysts was mainly determined by the supported VOx species, with the presence of SbOx contributing to catalyst stability through the facilitation of the redox cycle.

3. The Mg-containing catalysts exhibited a more stable catalytic behavior compared to the VSb/Al catalyst, possibly due to the strong resistance against carbon formation, which was attributed to the reduced surface acidities of the MgO-containing catalysts.

1. MgO修饰的氧化铝催化剂在二氧化碳存在下催化乙基苯脱氢为苯乙烯时，显示出增强的稳定性和活性，这可能归因于表面酸性的降低和烯烃更易从催化剂表面脱附。

2. 催化剂的比表面积随MgO含量的增加而减小，但对它们的特定活性影响很小。催化剂的活性主要由支持的VOx物种决定，SbOx的存在通过促进氧化还原循环，有助于催化剂稳定性。

3. 含有MgO的催化剂表现出比VSb/Al催化剂更稳定的催化行为，这可能是由于其对碳沉积的强抵抗力，这种抵抗力归因于MgO含有的催化剂表面酸性较低。
