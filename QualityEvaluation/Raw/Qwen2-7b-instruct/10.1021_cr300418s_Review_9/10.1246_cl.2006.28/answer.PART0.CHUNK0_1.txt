This work demonstrates that a favorable balance between the decreased acidity of the VSb oxide catalyst supported on MgO-modified alumina and an amount of VSb oxide species is needed for the stable and active catalytic performance in the CO2-EBDH. As a result, modification of alumina support with an appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al  0:1) leads to the stable activity of the VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst for the reaction.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by adjusting the acidity and stability of the catalyst surface. In this study, modifying the alumina support with an appropriate amount of magnesium oxide (MgO) led to a stable and active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene into styrene using carbon dioxide as an oxidant. The balance between decreased acidity and the amount of vanadium antimony oxide species was crucial for achieving stable and active catalytic performance. The MgO-modified catalyst showed enhanced stability against carbon formation, likely due to reduced surface acidity.

在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成通过调整催化剂表面的酸性和稳定性，影响其电子结构和催化性能。在这项研究中，通过在氧化铝支持体上适当添加镁氧化物(MgO)，获得了用于使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的乙苯脱氢为苯乙烯的稳定活性催化剂。为了实现稳定的催化性能，需要在酸性和所含的钒锑氧化物种量之间取得平衡。MgO改性催化剂表现出对碳沉积的增强稳定性，这可能归因于表面酸性的降低。
