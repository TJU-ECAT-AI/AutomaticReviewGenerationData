<quotes>
<p>The components of reaction mixtures were analyzed by on-line gas chromatograph.</p>
<p>VSty/Mg0:1Al sample showed similar initial styrene yield, YST  75 mol % after 1 h on-stream.</p>
<p>When we checked the content of carbon formation on each catalyst after 12 h on stream, we observed that Mg-modified catalysts reveal less carbon formation (4.4–6.0 wt %) as compared with VSb/Al (13.1 wt %).</p>
<p>This result implies the stronger interaction between acidic VSb oxide and MgnAl support materials while using a large content of basic MgO in catalyst preparation.</p>
<p>In summary, this work demonstrates that a favorable balance between the decreased acidity of the VSb oxide catalyst supported on MgO-modified alumina and an amount of VSb oxide species is needed for the stable and active catalytic performance in the CO2-EBDH.</p>

1. The MgO-modified alumina catalysts showed enhanced stability and activity in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of CO2, likely due to reduced surface acidity and facilitated olefin desorption. 

2. The specific surface area of the catalysts decreased with increasing MgO content, but this had only a slight effect on their specific activities. The activity of the catalysts was mainly determined by the supported VOx species, with the presence of SbOx contributing to catalyst stability through the facilitation of the redox cycle.

3. The Mg-containing catalysts exhibited a more stable catalytic behavior compared to the VSb/Al catalyst, possibly due to the strong resistance against carbon formation, which was attributed to the reduced surface acidities of the MgO-containing catalysts.

1. MgO修饰的氧化铝催化剂在二氧化碳存在下催化乙基苯脱氢为苯乙烯时，显示出增强的稳定性和活性，这可能归因于表面酸性的降低和烯烃更易从催化剂表面脱附。

2. 催化剂的比表面积随MgO含量的增加而减小，但对它们的特定活性影响很小。催化剂的活性主要由支持的VOx物种决定，SbOx的存在通过促进氧化还原循环，有助于催化剂稳定性。

3. 含有MgO的催化剂表现出比VSb/Al催化剂更稳定的催化行为，这可能是由于其对碳沉积的强抵抗力，这种抵抗力归因于MgO含有的催化剂表面酸性较低。

This work demonstrates that a favorable balance between the decreased acidity of the VSb oxide catalyst supported on MgO-modified alumina and an amount of VSb oxide species is needed for the stable and active catalytic performance in the CO2-EBDH. As a result, modification of alumina support with an appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al  0:1) leads to the stable activity of the VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst for the reaction.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by adjusting the acidity and stability of the catalyst surface. In this study, modifying the alumina support with an appropriate amount of magnesium oxide (MgO) led to a stable and active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene into styrene using carbon dioxide as an oxidant. The balance between decreased acidity and the amount of vanadium antimony oxide species was crucial for achieving stable and active catalytic performance. The MgO-modified catalyst showed enhanced stability against carbon formation, likely due to reduced surface acidity.

在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成通过调整催化剂表面的酸性和稳定性，影响其电子结构和催化性能。在这项研究中，通过在氧化铝支持体上适当添加镁氧化物(MgO)，获得了用于使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的乙苯脱氢为苯乙烯的稳定活性催化剂。为了实现稳定的催化性能，需要在酸性和所含的钒锑氧化物种量之间取得平衡。MgO改性催化剂表现出对碳沉积的增强稳定性，这可能归因于表面酸性的降低。

[1] "Modification of alumina support with an appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al  0:1) leads to the stable activity of the supported vanadiumantimony oxide catalyst for the dehydro- genation of ethylbenzene into styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide as oxidant."
[2] "The VSb/Mg0:1Al sample showed similar initial styrene yield, YST  75 mol % after 1 h on-stream. However, considering the difference in their SBET values (87 and 67 m2/g, respectively), the VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst can be regarded as a little more active one due to its higher specific yield based on the SBET value (YST/SBET),"
[3] "The activities of the supported VSb oxide catalysts in the CO2-EBDH are mainly determined by the sup-ported VOx species whereas the presence of SbOx positively affects the catalyst stability through the facilitation of the redox cycle."
[4] "It was found that XRD peaks of VSbO4like phases, which are well de- tectable in the VSb/Al12,13 and VSb/Mg0:1Al catalysts, are very weak in the VSb/Mg0:3Al and, moreover, they fully disappear in the VSb/Mg0:5Al catalyst."

1. Modifying the alumina support with a suitable amount of magnesia (Mg/Al ratio of 0:1) results in a stable activity for the vanadiumantimony oxide catalyst, enabling the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene into styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide as an oxidant.
2. The VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst demonstrated a comparable initial styrene yield of 75 mol % after 1 hour of operation. However, considering the difference in their surface areas (87 m²/g for VSb/Al and 67 m²/g for VSb/Mg0:1Al), the VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst appears marginally more active due to its higher specific yield based on surface area.
3. The activity of the supported VSb oxide catalysts in the CO2-EBDH is primarily determined by the supported VOx species, with the presence of SbOx contributing positively to catalyst stability by facilitating the redox cycle.
4. The XRD analysis revealed that the VSbO4-like phases detectable in the VSb/Al and VSb/Mg0:1Al catalysts become significantly weaker in the VSb/Mg0:3Al catalyst and are completely absent in the VSb/Mg0:5Al catalyst.

1. 将氧化铝支持材料与适当的镁含量（Mg/Al比为0:1）结合，可以实现范德华锑氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳作为氧化剂的情况下，促进乙苯脱氢生成苯乙烯。
2. VSb/Mg0:1Al催化剂在1小时操作后显示了相似的初始苯乙烯产率（75 mol %）。然而，考虑到它们的表面积差异（VSb/Al为87 m²/g，而VSb/Mg0:1Al为67 m²/g），根据表面积计算的特定产率，VSb/Mg0:1Al催化剂显示出更高的活性。
3. VSb氧化物催化剂在CO2-EBDH中的活性主要由支持的VOx物种决定，而SbOx的存在通过促进原电池循环对催化剂稳定性产生积极影响。
4. XRD分析表明，VSb/Al和VSb/Mg0:1Al催化剂中可检测到的VSbO4类似相变得较弱，并且在VSb/Mg0:3Al催化剂中完全消失，在VSb/Mg0:5Al催化剂中不存在。

[6] "As illustrated in NH3-TPD profiles (Figure 2), the VSb/ MgnAl catalysts contain smaller amounts of surface acid sites compared with the un-modified VSb/Al catalyst. Thus, the higher Mg-content leads to the lower acidity."
[7] "According to XRD patterns (Figure 3), both Mg0:1Al support and VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst do not contain a free crystalline MgO phase. Instead they showed a fully incorporated into spinel-like binary oxide phase, MgAl6O10. However, a crystal- line MgO is distinctively observed in the Mg0:3Al and Mg0:5Al whose major phase is MgAl2O4."
[8] "This result implies the stronger inter- action between acidic VSb oxide and MgnAl support materials while using a large content of basic MgO in catalyst preparation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts affect their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The stability and activity of the catalysts are influenced by the balance between decreased acidity of the VSb oxide catalyst supported on MgO-modified alumina and the amount of VSb oxide species. The MgO dopant concentration plays a crucial role in controlling the surface acidity, which impacts the stability and activity of the catalysts. Higher MgO content leads to reduced surface acidities, contributing to better stability. The specific surface areas of the catalysts decrease with an increase in MgO-content, affecting their specific activities. The catalytic performance is mainly determined by the supported VOx species, with the presence of SbOx positively affecting the catalyst stability through facilitating the redox cycle. The Mg-modified catalysts show less carbon formation, indicating strong resistance against carbon formation. The theoretical modeling faces challenges in accurately predicting the complex interactions between the catalysts and reactants, optimizing the process parameters, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.
