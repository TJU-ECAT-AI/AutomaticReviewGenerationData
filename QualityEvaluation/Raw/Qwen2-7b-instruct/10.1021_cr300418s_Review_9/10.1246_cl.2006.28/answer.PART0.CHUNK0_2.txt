[1] "Modification of alumina support with an appropriate amount of magnesia (Mg/Al  0:1) leads to the stable activity of the supported vanadiumantimony oxide catalyst for the dehydro- genation of ethylbenzene into styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide as oxidant."
[2] "The VSb/Mg0:1Al sample showed similar initial styrene yield, YST  75 mol % after 1 h on-stream. However, considering the difference in their SBET values (87 and 67 m2/g, respectively), the VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst can be regarded as a little more active one due to its higher specific yield based on the SBET value (YST/SBET),"
[3] "The activities of the supported VSb oxide catalysts in the CO2-EBDH are mainly determined by the sup-ported VOx species whereas the presence of SbOx positively affects the catalyst stability through the facilitation of the redox cycle."
[4] "It was found that XRD peaks of VSbO4like phases, which are well de- tectable in the VSb/Al12,13 and VSb/Mg0:1Al catalysts, are very weak in the VSb/Mg0:3Al and, moreover, they fully disappear in the VSb/Mg0:5Al catalyst."

1. Modifying the alumina support with a suitable amount of magnesia (Mg/Al ratio of 0:1) results in a stable activity for the vanadiumantimony oxide catalyst, enabling the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene into styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide as an oxidant.
2. The VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst demonstrated a comparable initial styrene yield of 75 mol % after 1 hour of operation. However, considering the difference in their surface areas (87 m²/g for VSb/Al and 67 m²/g for VSb/Mg0:1Al), the VSb/Mg0:1Al catalyst appears marginally more active due to its higher specific yield based on surface area.
3. The activity of the supported VSb oxide catalysts in the CO2-EBDH is primarily determined by the supported VOx species, with the presence of SbOx contributing positively to catalyst stability by facilitating the redox cycle.
4. The XRD analysis revealed that the VSbO4-like phases detectable in the VSb/Al and VSb/Mg0:1Al catalysts become significantly weaker in the VSb/Mg0:3Al catalyst and are completely absent in the VSb/Mg0:5Al catalyst.

1. 将氧化铝支持材料与适当的镁含量（Mg/Al比为0:1）结合，可以实现范德华锑氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳作为氧化剂的情况下，促进乙苯脱氢生成苯乙烯。
2. VSb/Mg0:1Al催化剂在1小时操作后显示了相似的初始苯乙烯产率（75 mol %）。然而，考虑到它们的表面积差异（VSb/Al为87 m²/g，而VSb/Mg0:1Al为67 m²/g），根据表面积计算的特定产率，VSb/Mg0:1Al催化剂显示出更高的活性。
3. VSb氧化物催化剂在CO2-EBDH中的活性主要由支持的VOx物种决定，而SbOx的存在通过促进原电池循环对催化剂稳定性产生积极影响。
4. XRD分析表明，VSb/Al和VSb/Mg0:1Al催化剂中可检测到的VSbO4类似相变得较弱，并且在VSb/Mg0:3Al催化剂中完全消失，在VSb/Mg0:5Al催化剂中不存在。
