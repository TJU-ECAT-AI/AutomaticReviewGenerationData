[1] "Though the books cover claims that the current edition, under the editorship of Nils Wiberg, is the first to be translated into English, this is, in fact, not true. The original Dutch edition was actually translated into English in 1902 by Hermon Cooper of Syracuse University and went through at least six editions by 1921."
[2] "Compared with the dog-and-pony show that now passes for the average freshman textbook with its multicolored pages, photos, sidebars, and supplementary CD, it is refreshing to see this material presented using straightforward, unpretentious, black and white, line drawings and print."
[3] "The coverage of concepts in Part A is basically at the level of an advanced freshman text. Given the average student's claims of total amnesia when it comes to the contents of earlier courses, this is probably not a bad idea and is also in keeping with the editors' stated claim that the book is intended for use by both beginning and advanced students."
[4] "The coverage of descriptive chemistry in Parts B, C, and D includes not only the latest research results but also basic information on naturally occurring mineral sources of the elements and on important industrial processes, such as iron smelting, the chemistry of glass, ceramics, and cement-topics that have all but disappeared from most American textbooks."
[5] "Regrettably, the book's treatment of this topic is one of the few with which I would take issue. Part C incorrectly classifies La and Ac as d-block or outer-transition metals even though extensive evidence was presented over 20 years ago showing that they are in fact f-block elements with irregular configurations and that Lu and Lr actually occupy the positions below Sc and Y in the d-block."
[6] "Despite these reservations, I strongly recommend this book. I found interesting and useful information on every topic I looked up. It is a model of thoroughness and organization and a must-reference book for every serious teacher, whether of freshman chemistry or advanced inorganic chemistry."
