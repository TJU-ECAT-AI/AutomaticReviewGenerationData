[1] "The current translation weighs in at 1884 pages and is printed on a light-weight grade of paper that has some problems with print bleed through."
[2] "Chemical Education Today JChemEd.chem.wisc.edu  •  Vol. 79  No. 8  August 2002  •  Journal of Chemical Education 945"
[3] "Whereas most American inorganic texts deal primarily with either concepts and models or with systematic descriptive chemistry (and, in the latter case, are often biased toward coverage of the transition metals), this text attempts to include both approaches."
[4] "This is done by dividing the book into four sections: Part A, (8 chapters, 276 pages) deals with fundamental concepts; Part B (10 chapters, 848 pages) deals with the chemistry of the main-group elements; Part C (14 chapters, 514 pages) deals with the chemistry of the outer-transition elements, and Part D (4 chapters, 104 pages) deals with the chemistry of the lanthanoids and actinoids."
[5] "Compared with the dog-and-pony show that now passes for the average freshman textbookwith its multicolored pages, photos,sidebars, and supplementary CDsit is refreshing to see this material presented using straight-forward, unpretentious, black and white, line drawings and print."
[6] "The coverage of descriptive chemistry in Parts B, C, and D includes not only the latest research results but also basic information on naturally occurring mineral sources of the elements and on important industrial processes, such as iron smelting, the chemistry of glass, ceramics and cement-topics that have all but disappeared from most American textbooks."
[7] "One unique feature of the book is its four-part coverage of the periodic lawan introductory chapter for Part A, and general overview chapters on each of the three major electronic blocks distributed among Parts B, C, and D."
[8] "Regrettably, the books treatment of this topic is one of the few with which I would take issue."
[9] "Part C incorrectly classifies La and Ac as d-block or outer-transition metals even though extensive evidence was presented over 20 years ago (J. Chem. Educ. 1982, 59, 634636) showing that they are in fact f-block elements with irregular configurations and that Lu and Lr actually occupy the positions below Sc and Y in the d-block."
[10] "Even more serious is the insistence that Zn, Cd, and Hg are outer-transition metals, though in fact there is nothing in either their electronic configurations or their known chemistry that could possibly justify such a classification."
[11] "A related, albeit minor, criticism is the books decision to use the terms lanthanide and actinide rather than the more linguistically correct terms lanthanoid and actinoid."
[12] "Despite these reservations, I strongly recommend this book."
[13] "I found interesting and useful information on every topic I looked up."
[14] "It is a model of thoroughness and organization and a must reference book for every serious teacher,whether of freshman chemistry or advanced inorganic chemistry."
[15] "It would also make a wonderful textbook, though its size would naturally limit its use to those schools which offer at least a full years sequence in inorganic chemistry."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The book under review contains a comprehensive 1884-page volume divided into four sections: Part A focuses on fundamental concepts, Part B covers the chemistry of main-group elements, Part C addresses the chemistry of outer-transition elements, and Part D discusses the chemistry of lanthanoids and actinoids. It provides thorough and organized information suitable for both beginners and advanced students, and includes the latest research results along with details on natural mineral sources and industrial processes. However, the book incorrectly classifies certain elements and uses terminology that differs from the more linguistically correct terms. Despite these issues, the book is recommended due to its extensive coverage and usefulness as a reference or textbook for inorganic chemistry courses.

该书包含一个全面的1884页版本，分为四部分：第A部分专注于基本概念，第B部分涵盖主族元素的化学，第C部分讨论外过渡元素的化学，第D部分讨论镧系和锕系的化学。它提供了适合初学者和高级学生使用的全面而有组织的信息，并包括最新研究成果以及自然矿物来源和工业过程的详细信息。然而，该书错误地对某些元素进行了分类，并使用了与更恰当术语不同的术语。尽管存在这些问题，但由于其广泛的覆盖范围和作为无机化学课程参考或教科书的实用性，仍然强烈推荐此书。
