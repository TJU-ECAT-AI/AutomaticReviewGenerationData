[1] "The current translation weighs in at 1884 pages and is printed on a light-weight grade of paper that has some problems with print bleed through."
[2] "Compared with the dog-and-pony show that now passes for the average freshman textbookwith its multicolored pages, photos,sidebars, and supplementary CDsit is refreshing to see this material presented using straight-forward, unpretentious, black and white, line drawings and print."
[3] "The coverage of descriptive chemistry in Parts B, C, and D includes not only the latest research results but also basic information on naturally occurring mineral sources of the elements and on important industrial processes, such as iron smelting, the chemistry of glass, ceramics and cement-topics that have all but disappeared from most American textbooks."
[4] "One unique feature of the book is its four-part coverage of the periodic lawan introductory chapter for Part A, and general overview chapters on each of the three major electronic blocks distributed among Parts B, C, and D."
[5] "Despite these reservations, I strongly recommend this book. I found interesting and useful information on every topic I looked up. It is a model of thoroughness and organization and a must reference book for every serious teacher,whether of freshman chemistry or advanced inorganic chemistry. It would also make a wonderful textbook, though its size would naturally limit its use to those schools which offer at least a full years sequence in inorganic chemistry."

This review does not contain direct information about the preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influencing their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it address the key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems. The focus of the review is on the Holleman-Wiberg Inorganic Chemistry textbook, discussing its content, presentation style, and recommendations for chemistry education rather than the specifics of catalytic systems.

这篇评论没有直接提供关于镍氧化物基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成如何影响它们的电子结构和催化性能的信息，也没有解决理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战。评论的重点是Holleman-Wiberg无机化学教科书的内容、呈现风格及其对化学教育的推荐，而不是这些催化系统的具体细节。
