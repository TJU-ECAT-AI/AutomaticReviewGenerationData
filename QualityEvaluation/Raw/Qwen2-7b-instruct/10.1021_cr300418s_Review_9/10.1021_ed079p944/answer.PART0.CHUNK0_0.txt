[1] "Though the books cover claims that the current edition, under the editorship of Nils Wiberg, is the first to be translated into English, this is, in fact, not true."
[2] "The first edition of this textbook was published in 1898 by the Dutch chemist, Arnold Frederick Holleman (1859 1953)."
[3] "As of 1995, it has passed through 34 German edi- tions and more than 100 printings."
[4] "This text attempts to include both approaches. This is done by dividing the book into four sections: Part A, (8 chapters, 276 pages) deals with fundamental concepts; Part B (10 chapters, 848 pages) deals with the chemistry of the main-group elements; Part C (14 chapters, 514 pages) deals with the chemistry of the outer- transition elements, and Part D (4 chapters, 104 pages) deals with the chemistry of the lanthanoids and actinoids."
[5] "Compared with the dog-and-pony show that now passes for the average freshman textbookwith its multicolored pages, photos, sidebars, and supplementary CDsit is refreshing to see this material presented using straight-forward, unpretentious, black and white, line drawings and print."
[6] "One unique feature of the book is its four-part cover- age of the periodic lawan introductory chapter for Part A, and general overview chapters on each of the three major electronic blocks distributed among Parts B, C, and D."
[7] "Regrettably, the books treatment of this topic is one of the few with which I would take issue. Part C incorrectly classi- fies La and Ac as d-block or outer-transition metals even though extensive evidence was presented over 20 years ago (J. Chem. Educ. 1982, 59, 634636) showing that they are in fact f-block elements with irregular configurations and that Lu and Lr actually occupy the positions below Sc and Y in the d-block."
[8] "Even more serious is the insistence that Zn, Cd, and Hg are outer-transition metals, though in fact there is nothing in either their electronic configurations or their known chemistry that could possibly justify such a clas- sification."
[9] "A related, albeit minor, criticism is the books decision to use the terms lanthanide and actinide rather than the more linguistically correct terms lanthanoid and actinoid."
[10] "Despite these reservations, I strongly recommend this book. I found interesting and useful information on every topic I looked up. It is a model of thoroughness and organization and a must reference book for every serious teacher, whether of freshman chemistry or advanced inorganic chemistry."

The Holleman-Wiberg Inorganic Chemistry textbook, despite having a long history and multiple editions, faced several criticisms. The first edition was published in 1898 by Arnold Frederick Holleman. The book has been translated into English before the current edition, with the first English translation occurring in 1902. The current edition divides the content into four parts: fundamental concepts, chemistry of main-group elements, chemistry of outer-transition elements, and chemistry of lanthanoids and actinoids. The book is praised for its straightforward presentation style, avoiding the overly colorful and multimedia-rich approach common in modern textbooks. However, the classification of certain elements, particularly lanthanides and actinides, has been questioned due to discrepancies with established chemical theory. Despite these issues, the book is highly recommended for its comprehensive coverage, organization, and utility as a reference for both introductory and advanced chemistry education.

霍莱曼-维伯格无机化学教科书，尽管有悠久的历史和多个版本，但仍面临一些批评。第一版于1898年由霍莱曼·弗雷德里克出版。该书在英语中被翻译过，最早的英语翻译发生在1902年。当前的版本将内容分为四部分：基本概念、主族元素的化学、外过渡元素的化学、镧系元素和锕系元素的化学。这本书因其直接而无炫耀的呈现方式而受到赞扬，避免了现代教科书中常见的过于色彩丰富和多媒体密集的方法。然而，对于某些元素（特别是镧系元素和锕系元素）的分类存在争议，这与已建立的化学理论相矛盾。尽管存在这些问题，但本书因其全面的覆盖范围、组织性和作为从入门到高级化学教育的参考书的实用性而强烈推荐。
