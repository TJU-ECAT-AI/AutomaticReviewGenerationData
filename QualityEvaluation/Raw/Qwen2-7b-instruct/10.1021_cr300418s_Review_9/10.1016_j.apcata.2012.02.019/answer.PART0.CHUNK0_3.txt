The study investigated the role of the reverse watergas-shift (RWGS) reaction in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in CO2 using vanadia, iron, and chromia catalysts on alumina. The potassium promoted vanadium catalyst showed the highest CO2 conversion for dehydrogenation. The presence of coke on the catalyst improved the activity of the vanadium catalyst due to hydrogen spill-over. A two-step mechanism involving hydrogen spill-over was proposed for the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in CO2. The redox mechanism for the RWGS and the two-step pathway for dehydrogenation were found to be the dominant routes. The bare alumina support exhibited a slight RWGS activity attributed to an associative mechanism.

该研究使用了铝氧化物支持的范德瓦尔、铁和铬催化剂，以调查在二氧化碳中乙基苯的脱氢作用对苯乙烯的影响。钾促进的钒催化剂显示出最高的二氧化碳转化率，并且具有最大的乙基苯转化率增加。催化剂上的焦炭的存在，提高了钒催化剂的活性，这是由于焦炭向金属催化剂溢出氢所致。提出了一个包含氢溢流的两步机制来解释二氧化碳中乙基苯的脱氢作用。步响应实验表明，RWGS反应的还原机制和脱氢作用的两步路径是主导途径。铝氧化物支持的轻微RWGS活性归因于关联机制。
