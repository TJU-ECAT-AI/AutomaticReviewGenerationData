The role of the RWGS reaction in the dehydrogenation process in CO2 has been investigated. This study utilized various catalysts, including iron, vanadium, and chromium, supported on alumina, both un-promoted and promoted with potassium or magnesium. The RWGS experiments were conducted in the presence and absence of dehydrogenation under similar conditions to facilitate comparison. The performance of the catalysts in CO2 diluent showed differences from those in nitrogen diluent, with the CO2 diluent generally leading to higher ethylbenzene conversion. The selectivity remained consistent across most catalysts, showing minimal deviation when comparing CO2 and nitrogen diluent experiments after 15-20 hours. The selectivity values were influenced by the presence of coke on the catalyst surface, affecting the RWGS reaction differently over chromium and iron catalysts but improving the activity of the vanadium catalyst.

在二氧化碳中进行脱氢反应过程中，逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应的作用进行了研究。这项研究使用了铁、钒和铬等催化剂，这些催化剂被支持在氧化铝上，并且可以未经促进或用钾或镁促进。在存在或不存在脱氢作用的情况下，在相似条件下进行RWGS实验，以方便比较。催化剂在二氧化碳稀释剂中的表现与在氮气稀释剂中的表现存在差异，通常二氧化碳稀释剂能带来更高的乙苯转化率。选择性保持稳定，大多数催化剂在二氧化碳或氮气稀释剂下的表现基本相同，显示出15至20小时后的小差异。选择性值受到催化剂表面焦炭存在的影响，对铬和铁催化剂的RWGS反应产生不同影响，但提高了钒催化剂的活性。

The study investigates the role of the reverse watergas-shift (RWGS) reaction in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene in carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere. Different types of catalysts, including vanadia, iron, and chromia supported on alumina, are tested for their performance in dehydrogenation with and without CO2. The addition of CO2 to the process enhances the styrene yield compared to using nitrogen as a diluent. The study reveals that the potassium promoted vanadium catalyst shows the highest CO2 conversion for dehydrogenation. The activity of the catalysts in the RWGS reaction varies significantly depending on the catalyst type. The presence of coke on the catalyst supports the RWGS reaction over chromium and iron catalysts, but improves the activity of the vanadium catalyst. A two-step mechanism with hydrogen spill-over is proposed for the EB dehydrogenation in CO2. The redox mechanism for the RWGS and the two-step pathway for dehydrogenation in CO2 are identified as the dominant routes. Bare alumina support exhibits a slight RWGS activity attributed to an associative mechanism.
