The study investigates the role of the reverse watergas-shift (RWGS) reaction in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene in carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere. Different types of catalysts, including vanadia, iron, and chromia supported on alumina, are tested for their performance in dehydrogenation with and without CO2. The addition of CO2 to the process enhances the styrene yield compared to using nitrogen as a diluent. The study reveals that the potassium promoted vanadium catalyst shows the highest CO2 conversion for dehydrogenation. The activity of the catalysts in the RWGS reaction varies significantly depending on the catalyst type. The presence of coke on the catalyst supports the RWGS reaction over chromium and iron catalysts, but improves the activity of the vanadium catalyst. A two-step mechanism with hydrogen spill-over is proposed for the EB dehydrogenation in CO2. The redox mechanism for the RWGS and the two-step pathway for dehydrogenation in CO2 are identified as the dominant routes. Bare alumina support exhibits a slight RWGS activity attributed to an associative mechanism.

本研究探讨了在二氧化碳（CO2）气氛下，乙苯（EB）脱氢生成苯乙烯的过程中的逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应的作用。测试了包括氧化钒、铁和铬等不同类型的催化剂，这些催化剂支持在氧化铝上，用于带有和不带有CO2的脱氢过程。将CO2添加到过程中可以提高苯乙烯的产率，与使用氮气作为稀释剂相比。研究表明，钾促进的氧化钒催化剂在脱氢过程中对CO2的转化率最高。催化剂在RWGS反应中的活性因催化剂类型而异。催化剂上的焦炭的存在抑制了铬和铁催化剂的RWGS反应，但提高了氧化钒催化剂的活性。提出了一个两步机制，其中氢溢出，用于解释CO2气氛下的EB脱氢。RWGS和CO2脱氢的红氧化机制被确定为主导路径。氧化铝基体在存在轻微的RWGS活性，归因于关联机制。
