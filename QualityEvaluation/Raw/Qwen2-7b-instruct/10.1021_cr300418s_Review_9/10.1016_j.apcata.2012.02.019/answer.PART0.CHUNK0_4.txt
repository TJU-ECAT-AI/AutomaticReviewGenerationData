[1] "The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene with CO2 is an alternative process option for the styrene production."
[2] "This new process has an improved conversion,higher selectivity,is safer,and is less energy consuming [16]."
[3] "Under the dehydrogena- tion conditions, CO2 is considered to be a mild oxidant like steam and is able to re-oxidize the catalyst."
[4] "And most importantly, CO2 can react with the formed H2 via the reverse watergas-shift (RWGS) reaction and,thereby,shifting the equilibrium conversion to higher values [16]."
[5] "The RWGS reaction is a mildly endothermic reaction (36 kJ/mol at 600 C)"
[6] "The goal of this study is to investigate the role of the RWGS reaction in the dehydrogenation in CO2."
[7] "Based on our recent insights into dehydrogenation catalysis [18],also coked catalysts and support are included."
[8] "The chosen load- ings are 1 mmol/g for vanadia (V), iron (Fe), and chromia (Cr) and 0.5 mmol/g for the promoters potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg)."
[9] "The role of the RWGS reaction has already been subject of previous research [2,6,17]."
[10] "The dehydrogenation experiments were performed under the same temperature and pressure as the RWGS studies."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the precise mechanisms of these reactions, predicting how changes in catalyst properties affect performance, and developing models that accurately capture the complex interactions between reactants, catalysts, and products. This study investigates the role of the reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS) reaction in the dehydrogenation process in carbon dioxide, including the effects of using various catalysts with different loadings of vanadia, iron, chromium, and promoters like potassium and magnesium. The research also includes the examination of coked catalysts and supports, aiming to improve the efficiency and selectivity of the dehydrogenation process while ensuring safety and reducing energy consumption.
