The role of the RWGS reaction in the dehydrogenation process in CO2 has been investigated. This study utilized various catalysts, including iron, vanadium, and chromium, supported on alumina, both un-promoted and promoted with potassium or magnesium. The RWGS experiments were conducted in the presence and absence of dehydrogenation under similar conditions to facilitate comparison. The performance of the catalysts in CO2 diluent showed differences from those in nitrogen diluent, with the CO2 diluent generally leading to higher ethylbenzene conversion. The selectivity remained consistent across most catalysts, showing minimal deviation when comparing CO2 and nitrogen diluent experiments after 15-20 hours. The selectivity values were influenced by the presence of coke on the catalyst surface, affecting the RWGS reaction differently over chromium and iron catalysts but improving the activity of the vanadium catalyst.

在二氧化碳中进行脱氢反应过程中，逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应的作用进行了研究。这项研究使用了铁、钒和铬等催化剂，这些催化剂被支持在氧化铝上，并且可以未经促进或用钾或镁促进。在存在或不存在脱氢作用的情况下，在相似条件下进行RWGS实验，以方便比较。催化剂在二氧化碳稀释剂中的表现与在氮气稀释剂中的表现存在差异，通常二氧化碳稀释剂能带来更高的乙苯转化率。选择性保持稳定，大多数催化剂在二氧化碳或氮气稀释剂下的表现基本相同，显示出15至20小时后的小差异。选择性值受到催化剂表面焦炭存在的影响，对铬和铁催化剂的RWGS反应产生不同影响，但提高了钒催化剂的活性。
