[1] "The activity per nickel ion is found to increase as the ions are diluted by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1 % nickel."
[2] "We infer from this that some chemisorption is occurring at temperatures above 0" and that "the isotherms at 0 and 40" probably do not correspond to true adsorption equilibrium."
[3] "A comparison may be made of the coverages determined by the two methods by reference to fig. 1, 2 and 4, with appropriate interpolation."
[4] "We consider that this correspondence of properties, which a priori is unexpected on account of the much smaller nickel content of MN 1, is sufficiently close for us to be able to attribute the high activity of MN 1 to the ability of its nickel ions to produce chemisorbed oxygen in this particular form."

1. The activity of nickel ions in catalysis increases when the concentration of magnesium ions dilutes the nickel ions, peaking around 1% nickel.
2. Some chemisorption is occurring at temperatures above 0°C, indicating that the adsorption isotherms at 0°C and 40°C do not represent true equilibrium.
3. Comparisons can be made between chemisorption coverages determined through direct experiments and those inferred from catalytic behavior.
4. The high activity of MN 1 can be attributed to its nickel ions producing a specific form of chemisorbed oxygen, despite having a much lower nickel content compared to other catalysts.

1. 镍离子浓度稀释镁离子时，其催化活性增加，峰值在镍离子浓度约为1%。
2. 温度高于0°C时存在部分化学吸附，这表明0°C和40°C的吸附等温线可能未达到真正的平衡状态。
3. 可以通过直接实验确定的化学吸附覆盖率与催化行为推断出的覆盖率进行比较。
4. MN 1的高活性可以归因于其镍离子产生特定形式的化学吸附氧，尽管其镍含量远低于其他催化剂。
