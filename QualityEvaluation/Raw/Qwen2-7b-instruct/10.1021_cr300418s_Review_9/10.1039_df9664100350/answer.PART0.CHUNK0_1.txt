[1] "The activity per nickel ion is found to increase as the ions are diluted by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1 % nickel."
[2] "The link between semiconductivity and catalysis is consequently much less direct and currently of limited heuristic value."
[3] "We shall show that this is so. Chemisorption of oxygen has been measured from -78 to 550C on the solids of greatest catalytic interest, thereby spanning the full range (300 to 500C) studied in the heterogeneous catalysis."
[4] "We infer from this that some chemisorption is occurring at temperatures above 0" and that the isotherms at 0 and 40" probably do not correspond to true adsorption equilibrium."

[1] The catalytic activity per nickel ion increases when magnesium ions dilute the nickel ions, peaking around 1% nickel.
[2] The connection between semiconductivity and catalysis is less straightforward and of limited practical value.
[3] Oxygen chemisorption was measured from -78 to 550°C on the materials of greatest interest for catalysis, covering the entire temperature range (300 to 500°C) studied in heterogeneous catalysis.
[4] We deduce that chemisorption is happening above 0°C, and the isotherms at 0°C and 40°C likely do not represent true adsorption equilibrium.

[1] 随着镁离子稀释镍离子，每个镍离子的催化活性增加，峰值出现在大约1%镍。
[2] 半导体与催化作用之间的联系较为间接，当前的实用价值有限。
[3] 我们在最感兴趣的催化材料上测量了从-78°C到550°C的氧吸附，覆盖了在异质催化中研究的整个温度范围（300°C到500°C）。
[4] 我们推断在高于0°C时存在化学吸附，0°C和40°C的等温线可能并未代表真正的吸附平衡。
