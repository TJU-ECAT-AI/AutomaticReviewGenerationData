[1] "The activity per nickel ion is found to increase as the ions are diluted by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1 % nickel."
[2] "The link between semiconductivity and catalysis is consequently much less direct and currently of limited heuristic value."

[1] The catalytic activity per nickel ion increases when magnesium ions dilute the nickel ions, peaking around 1% nickel.
[2] The connection between semiconductivity and catalysis is less straightforward and of limited practical value.
[3] Oxygen chemisorption was measured from -78 to 550°C on the materials of greatest interest for catalysis, covering the entire temperature range (300 to 500°C) studied in heterogeneous catalysis.
[4] We deduce that chemisorption is happening above 0°C, and the isotherms at 0°C and 40°C likely do not represent true adsorption equilibrium.

1. The research was conducted jointly by universities in Bristol and Palermo, supported by a NATO Research Grant program.
2. The catalytic activity per nickel ion increases with the dilution of the ions by magnesium ions, peaking around 1% nickel concentration.
3. Oxygen chemisorption has been quantified from -78 to 550C on materials of greatest catalytic interest, covering the entire 300 to 500C range of heterogeneous catalysis.
4. Below 400C, the solid solution with 1% nickel (MN 1) showed higher activity than the one with 10% nickel (MN 10).
5. The rates of oxygen adsorption were similar on MN 1 at all temperatures compared to MN 10, while they were faster on MO than on the solid solutions at all temperatures.
6. The most interesting catalysts, exhibiting extremes in behavior, were MO (least active with the highest activation energy), MN 1 (most active with the lowest activation energy), MN 10 (lowest activity per nickel ion), and MNL 1 :1 (highest activation energy among the solid solutions).
7. The high activity of MN 1 is attributed to the nickel ions' capability to create chemisorbed oxygen in a specific form, despite the smaller nickel content.
8. Incorporating lithium in solid solution in pure nickel oxide leads to a stronger form of oxygen chemisorption compared to pure nickel oxide, as reported by several investigators.
9. The proposed mechanism involves two oxygen atoms initially from NzO molecules that migrate together over a few lattice distances to form the adsorbed state depicted in the sketch.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the surface chemistry and reactivity. Specifically, the presence of dopants like magnesium and lithium changes the electronic properties, leading to different adsorption behaviors of reactants and intermediates. Vacancy formation can alter the surface morphology and coordination environment, impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure, surface configurations, and reaction pathways. Process optimization requires balancing factors such as reaction temperature, pressure, and catalyst loading to achieve high efficiency, selectivity, and safety. Safety concerns involve managing exothermic reactions and preventing potential hazards like fire or explosion.
