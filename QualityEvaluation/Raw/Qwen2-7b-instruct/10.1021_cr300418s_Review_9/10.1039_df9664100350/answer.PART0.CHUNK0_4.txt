[1] "The research described in this paper was a combined investigation carried out in the Universities of Bristol and Palermo and was supported by a joint award under the N.A.T.O. Research Grants Programme."
[2] "We consider that this correspondence of properties, which a priori is unexpected on account of the much smaller nickel content of MN 1, is sufficiently close for us to be able to attribute the high activity of MN 1 to the ability of its nickel ions to produce chemisorbed oxygen in this particular form."
[3] "We consider that the weak chemisorptions on the MN catalysts, and the results with MNL 1 :1 indicate that polarization of the N20 molecule is a probable source of the adsorption energy."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the surface chemistry and reactivity. Specifically, the presence of dopants like magnesium and lithium changes the electronic properties, leading to different adsorption behaviors of reactants and intermediates. Vacancy formation can alter the surface morphology and coordination environment, impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure, surface configurations, and reaction pathways. Process optimization requires balancing factors such as reaction temperature, pressure, and catalyst loading to achieve high efficiency, selectivity, and safety. Safety concerns involve managing exothermic reactions and preventing potential hazards like fire or explosion.
