[1] "The research described in this paper was a combined investigation carried out in the Universities of Bristol and Palermo and was supported by a joint award under the N.A.T.O. Research Grants Programme."
[2] "The activity per nickel ion is found to increase as the ions are diluted by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1 % nickel."
[3] "We shall show that this is so. Chemisorption of oxygen has been measured from -78 to 550C on the solids of greatest catalytic interest, thereby spanning the full range (300 to 500C) studied in the heterogeneous catalysis."
[4] "The most interesting result, however, is that below 400C the solid solution containing 1 % Niz+ (MN 1) is more active than that containing 10 % Ni2+ (MN lo)."
[5] "On MN 1 the rates at all temperatures were comparable to those at the lower temperatures on MN 10. On MO, on the other hand, the rates of adsorption were faster at all temperatures than on the solid solutions."
[6] "The catalysts of greatest interest as representing extremes of behaviour are MO (least active and highest E), MN 1 (most active and lowest E), MN 10 (lowest activity per Niz+ ion of MN series) and MNL 1 :1 (highest E among the solid solutions)."
[7] "We consider that this correspondence of properties, which a priori is unexpected on account of the much smaller nickel content of MN 1, is sufficiently close for us to be able to attribute the high activity of MN 1 to the ability of its nickel ions to produce chemisorbed oxygen in this particular form."
[8] "The incorporation of lithium in solid solution in pure NiO is well-known to lead to a stronger form of oxygen chemisorption than on NiO itself; comparisons having been made by several investigators."
[9] "The proposed mechanism is then one in which two 0- ions, originally formed from NzO molecules and separately chemisorbed, migrate together over not more than a few lattice distances to form the adsorbed state indicated in the sketch."

1. The research was conducted jointly by universities in Bristol and Palermo, supported by a NATO Research Grant program.
2. The catalytic activity per nickel ion increases with the dilution of the ions by magnesium ions, peaking around 1% nickel concentration.
3. Oxygen chemisorption has been quantified from -78 to 550C on materials of greatest catalytic interest, covering the entire 300 to 500C range of heterogeneous catalysis.
4. Below 400C, the solid solution with 1% nickel (MN 1) showed higher activity than the one with 10% nickel (MN 10).
5. The rates of oxygen adsorption were similar on MN 1 at all temperatures compared to MN 10, while they were faster on MO than on the solid solutions at all temperatures.
6. The most interesting catalysts, exhibiting extremes in behavior, were MO (least active with the highest activation energy), MN 1 (most active with the lowest activation energy), MN 10 (lowest activity per nickel ion), and MNL 1 :1 (highest activation energy among the solid solutions).
7. The high activity of MN 1 is attributed to the nickel ions' capability to create chemisorbed oxygen in a specific form, despite the smaller nickel content.
8. Incorporating lithium in solid solution in pure nickel oxide leads to a stronger form of oxygen chemisorption compared to pure nickel oxide, as reported by several investigators.
9. The proposed mechanism involves two oxygen atoms initially from NzO molecules that migrate together over a few lattice distances to form the adsorbed state depicted in the sketch.

1. 这项研究由布里斯托尔和帕尔马的大学联合进行，得到了北约研究基金项目的联合资助。
2. 随着镍离子浓度的稀释，每镍离子的催化活性增加，峰值出现在约1%镍浓度。
3. 在-78至550C范围内，对最大催化性能材料的氧化学吸附进行了量化，覆盖了异相催化分析中的300至500C整个范围。
4. 在低于400C时，含1%镍（MN 1）的固体溶液比含10%镍（MN 10）的固体溶液显示出更高的活性。
5. 在所有温度下，MN 1的氧吸附速率与MN 10相似，而MO在所有温度下的吸附速率均快于固体溶液。
6. 最有趣且行为极端的催化剂是MO（活性最低，激活能最高），MN 1（活性最高，激活能最低），MN 10（每镍离子活性最低），以及MNL 1 :1（固体溶液中激活能最高）。
7. 我们认为，尽管MN 1的镍含量较低，但其高活性可归因于镍离子产生特定形式的化学吸附氧的能力。
8. 将锂引入纯镍氧化物的固体溶液中，导致氧化学吸附比纯镍氧化物更强，这一结果被多位研究者比较过。
