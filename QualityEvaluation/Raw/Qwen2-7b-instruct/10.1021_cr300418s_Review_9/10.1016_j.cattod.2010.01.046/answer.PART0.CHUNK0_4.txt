[1] "Typically, the most efficient MoVTe(Sb)NbO catalysts present generally two crystalline phases: (i) an orthorhombic (AO)22x(A2O)xM20O56 (A = Te or Sb and M = Mo, V, Nb; with 0 < x <1), the so-called M1 phase; and (ii) an orthorhombically distorted (A2O)M6O19 phase (A = Te or Sb and M = Mo, V, Nb), the so-called M2 phase."
[2] "The main reaction products have been: ethylene from ethane, acrylic acid from propane, maleic anhydride from n-butane and methacrolein from isobutane."
[3] "Regarding the selectivity to reaction products, very different patterns have been observed."
[4] "In the case of ethylene no oxygen containing products different from COx were observed."
[5] "In the oxidation of ethane, ethylene was the only partial oxidation product, with a selectivity to ethylene of ca. 95%, meanwhile no aldehydes or acids were observed."
[6] "On the other hand, the presence of olefins in the reaction products decreases also from ethane to isobutane."
[7] "In this way, isobutene was practically not observed during the oxidation of isobutane in all the isobutane conversion range studied (from 5% to 25% isobutane conversion)."
[8] "However, the nature of the reaction products and the corresponding intermediates are very different depending on the alkane fed."
[9] "The catalyst studied here presents a very low conversion in ethylene oxidation."
[10] "Meanwhile the reaction rate for ethane is much higher than the rate for ethylene (rC2=rC2 < 0:1)."

The catalysts typically consist of two crystalline phases: the M1 phase, which is orthorhombic (AO)22x(A2O)xM20O56, and the M2 phase, which is orthorhombically distorted (A2O)M6O19. The main reaction products vary significantly depending on the alkane fed. For ethane, ethylene is the primary product with high selectivity. Acrylic acid is produced from propane, maleic anhydride from n-butane, and methacrolein from isobutane. The selectivity to reaction products differs greatly. Ethylene does not produce any oxygen-containing products other than COx. Ethylene has a selectivity of around 95% when oxidized from ethane, with no aldehydes or acids observed. The presence of olefins decreases from ethane to isobutane. Isobutene is practically not observed during the oxidation of isobutane within the tested conversion range. The nature of the reaction products and intermediates changes depending on the alkane fed. The catalyst shows a low conversion in ethylene oxidation. The reaction rate for ethane is notably higher than for ethylene (rC2=rC2 < 0:1).

催化剂通常由两种晶相组成：M1相，为正交（AO）22x（A2O）xM20O56，和M2相，为正交畸变（A2O）M6O19。主要反应产物根据输入的烷烃种类有很大差异。对于乙烷，乙烯是主要产物，并且具有高选择性。丙烷氧化产生丙烯酸，正丁烷产生马来酸酐，异丁烷产生甲基丙烯醛。反应产物的选择性有很大的不同。当从乙烷氧化时，乙烯具有约95%的高选择性，没有观察到醛类或酸类物质。从乙烷到异丁烷，烯烃的存在量逐渐减少。在测试的异丁烷转化范围内，几乎没有观察到异丁烯的氧化。根据输入的烷烃种类，反应产物和中间体的性质会发生变化。催化剂在乙烯氧化中的转化率很低。乙烷的反应速率明显高于乙烯（rC2=rC2 < 0:1）。
