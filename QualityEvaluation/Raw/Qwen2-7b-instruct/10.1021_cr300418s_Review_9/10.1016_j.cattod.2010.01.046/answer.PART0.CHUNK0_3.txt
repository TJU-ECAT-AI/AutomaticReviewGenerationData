3.1. Catalytic properties in the partial oxidation of C2C4 alkanes and olefins Firstly, it must be mentioned that the catalytic activity for the alkane conversion depends on the nature of the alkane and, as expected, the larger is the alkane the higher is the reactivity, with ethane and propane being the less reactive alkanes. Regarding the selectivity to reaction products, very different patterns have been observed. Fig. 1 shows the selectivity to the main partial oxidation products achieved during the partial oxidation of the C2C4 alkanes at 400 °C and an alkane conversion of ca. 25%.

3.2. FTIR study on the adsorption of olefins and aldehydes Fig. 3 shows the main adsorbed species observed by FTIR of propene (Fig. 3A), isobutene (Fig. 3B) or ethylene (Fig. 3C) adsorbed over the MoVTeNbO catalyst.

3.3. General remarks The results presented here show that C2C4 alkanes can be selectively activated over a MoVTeNbO catalyst. In all cases, the formation of the corresponding olefin seems to be the first step in the selective oxidative activation of lower alkanes. However, the adsorption/desorption behaviour of the olefinic intermediates and also the amount of olefin observed during the catalytic oxidation of lower alkanes change depending on the length of the alkane. In addition, the FTIR spectra of C2C4 olefins show that the activation mechanism and the nature of the intermediates change.

Conclusions MoVTeNbO-based catalysts present active sites of different nature in a single matrix [1126]. They have active sites for the selective oxidative activation of C2C4 alkanes. In addition, they have active and relatively selective sites for partial oxidation of olefins (except in the case of ethylene, in which a very low activity was observed).

According to this, a reaction network for propane and isobutane oxidation can be proposed (Fig. 5) in which the detection of reaction intermediates and the nature of the final reaction products depends on the more or less facility in the desorption of the corresponding reaction intermediates. It is clear that these aspects are clearly related to the nature and number of active sites in the catalyst. In addition, the different facility in the desorption of intermediates could determine the nature of the final reaction products, which is related to the structure of catalyst.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety involve understanding the complex interplay between the catalyst's active sites, the nature of the reactants, and the resulting reaction pathways. The nature of the final reaction products is influenced by the catalyst's structure and the ease of desorption of intermediates, which is closely related to the catalyst's active site characteristics.

The selectivity to reaction products varies significantly depending on the alkane's nature, with ethane and propane being less reactive. Ethylene shows a notably low catalytic activity in comparison to other olefins. The adsorption/desorption behavior of olefinic intermediates and the amount of olefin observed during the catalytic oxidation of lower alkanes depend on the alkane's length. FTIR studies reveal differences in activation mechanisms and intermediate species for various C2C4 olefins. A reaction network for propane and isobutane oxidation is proposed, where the nature of final products is determined by the catalyst's structure and the ease of desorption of reaction intermediates.

The conclusions highlight that MoVTeNbO-based catalysts have active sites for selective oxidative activation of C2C4 alkanes and selective partial oxidation of olefins, except for ethylene, which shows very low activity. The different reaction pathways and final products observed during the oxidation of propane and isobutane are attributed to the catalyst's structure and the varying desorption capabilities of intermediates.

在镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成方面，它们对氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）的电子结构和催化性能产生了影响。理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战在于理解催化剂活性位点、反应物性质与产物路径之间的复杂相互作用。最终产物的性质受到催化剂结构和中间体脱附能力的影响。

不同烷烃的性质导致选择性产物变化显著，其中乙烷和丙烷活性较低。乙烯在与其他烯烃相比显示极低的催化活性。不同长度的C2C4烯烃的吸附/脱附行为以及在催化氧化低烷烃过程中观察到的烯烃量取决于烷烃的长度。傅里叶变换红外光谱研究表明，各种C2C4烯烃的激活机制和中间物种存在差异。为丙烷和异丁烷氧化提出了一个反应网络，在其中检测到反应中间体和最终产物的性质取决于相应反应中间体脱附的可能性大小。这些方面明显与催化剂的活性位点特性有关。

结论指出，MoVTeNbO基催化剂具有用于选择性氧化激活C2C4烷烃的活性位点以及选择性部分氧化烯烃的能力（除了活性非常低的乙烯）。对于丙烷和异丁烷氧化，根据催化剂的结构和中间体脱附能力的不同，观察到不同的反应途径和最终产物。通过催化剂结构和中间体脱附能力的差异，可以解释在氧化丙烷和异丁烷过程中观察到的不同反应途径和最终产物。
