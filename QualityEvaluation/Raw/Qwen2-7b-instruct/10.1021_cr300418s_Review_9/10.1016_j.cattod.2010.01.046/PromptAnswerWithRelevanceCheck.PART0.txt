[1] "Typically, the most efficient MoVTe(Sb)NbO catalysts present generally two crystalline phases: (i) an orthorhombic (AO)22x(A2O)xM20O56 (A = Te or Sb and M = Mo, V, Nb; with 0 < x <1), the so-called M1 phase; and (ii) an orthorhombically distorted (A2O)M6O19 phase (A = Te or Sb and M = Mo, V, Nb), the so-called M2 phase."
[2] "Pure M1 phase based catalysts can be obtained by hydrothermal synthesis or by using post-synthesis treatment."
[3] "In this paper it will be presented a comparative study on the partial oxidation of C2C4 alkanes over a MoVTeNbO mixed metal oxide catalyst, prepared hydrothermally, and presenting the M1 phase."
[4] "The main reaction products have been: ethylene from ethane, acrylic acid from propane, maleic anhydride from n-butane and methacrolein from isobutane."
[5] "According to these results different reaction pathways will be proposed."
[6] "The XRD pattern of the catalyst is characterized by Bragg reflections at 2u = 6.6, 7.7, 8.9, 10.7, 22.1, 27.2, 29.2, 35.48, indicating the presence of M1 phase [22]."
[7] "However, the presence of M2 as a minority phase cannot be ruled out."
[8] "Regarding the selectivity to reaction products, very different patterns have been observed."
[9] "On the other hand, we must indicate that no changes in the XRD patterns of catalyst after the catalytic tests were observed."
[10] "Fig. 1 shows the selectivity to the main partial oxidation products achieved during the partial oxidation of the C2C4 alkanes at 400 8C and an alkane conversion of ca. 25%."
[11] "In the oxidation of ethane, ethylene was the only partial oxidation product, with a selectivity to ethylene of ca. 95%, meanwhile no aldehydes or acids were observed."
[12] "However, in the case of C3C4 alkanes, the nature of the main partial oxidation products changes depending on the alkane fed."
[13] "Thus, acrylic acid and propene (from propane), maleic anhydride and butadiene (from n-butane) and methacrolein (from isobutane) were mainly observed (Fig. 1)."
[14] "We must notice that the sum of the selectivities to the main partial oxidation products (i.e. olefin and O-containing products) strongly depends on the alkane fed and decreases according to the following trend (Fig. 1):ethane > propane > n-butane > isobutane."
[15] "On the other hand, the presence of olefins in the reaction products decreases also from ethane to isobutane."
[16] "In this way, isobutene was practically not observed during the oxidation of isobutane in all the isobutane conversion range studied (from 5% to 25% isobutane conversion)."
[17] "Fig. 2 shows the variation of the yield to the main reaction products achieved during the oxidation of C2C4 olefins at 380 8C and a contact time, W/F, of 75 gcat h mololefin 1 (Fig. 2 a) and the variation of the selectivity to the partial oxidation products achieved during the oxidation of C2C4 olefins at 380 8C and an olefin isoconversion of 20% (Fig. 2b)."
[18] "According to these results, it can be concluded that the same O-containing products were achieved from alkanes (Fig. 1) and from the corresponding olefins (Fig. 2a), although the selectivity to the main partial oxidation products observed during the partial oxidation of olefins was higher than those achieved from the corresponding alkanes."
[19] "In the case of ethylene no oxygen containing products different from COx were observed."
[20] "In addition, we must inform that the catalyst studied here presents a very low conversion in ethylene oxidation (Fig. 2a), which explains the high selectivity to ethylene observed during the oxidation of ethane."
[21] "Meanwhile the reaction rate for ethane is much higher than the rate for ethylene (rC2=rC2 < 0:1)."
[22] "In the case of the C3C4 hydrocarbons, the reactivity of the olefins is remarkably higher than that of the alkanes, with rolefin/ralkane of ca. 24 rC3H6=rC3H8, 31 r1C4H8=rnC4H10 and 38 riC4H8=riC4H10."
[23] "An increase in the reactivity of the olefin has been reported to favour a higher reduction of the catalyst surface [27]."
[24] "Thus, one could expect that the reduction degree of the catalysts during the oxidation of isobutene [28] must be higher than during the propene oxidation [29,30] favouring a lower extension of the consecutive conversion to acid or anhydrides."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The M1 phase typically found in MoVTe(Sb)NbO catalysts, composed of orthorhombic (AO)22x(A2O)xM20O56 and orthorhombically distorted (A2O)M6O19 phases, plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity. Pure M1 phase catalysts can be obtained through hydrothermal synthesis or post-synthesis treatments. The selectivity and nature of the reaction products depend on the alkane fed, showing distinct patterns for ethane, propane, n-butane, and isobutane. The selectivity to reaction products varies significantly, with ethane having the highest selectivity, followed by propane, n-butane, and isobutane. The presence of olefins in the reaction products decreases from ethane to isobutane, with isobutene practically not observed during isobutane oxidation. The reactivity of the olefins is higher than that of the alkanes, leading to different reaction pathways and products. The catalysts' electronic structure and the nature of active sites are critical factors in determining their catalytic performance and selectivity. Theoretical modeling faces challenges in accurately predicting the complex interactions within the catalyst and the reaction mechanisms. Process optimization requires balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety, often necessitating experimental validation and fine-tuning of operational conditions. The balance between these factors is essential for achieving optimal catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

3.1. Catalytic properties in the partial oxidation of C2C4 alkanes and olefins Firstly, it must be mentioned that the catalytic activity for the alkane conversion depends on the nature of the alkane and, as expected, the larger is the alkane the higher is the reactivity, with ethane and propane being the less reactive alkanes. Regarding the selectivity to reaction products, very different patterns have been observed. Fig. 1 shows the selectivity to the main partial oxidation products achieved during the partial oxidation of the C2C4 alkanes at 400 °C and an alkane conversion of ca. 25%.

3.2. FTIR study on the adsorption of olefins and aldehydes Fig. 3 shows the main adsorbed species observed by FTIR of propene (Fig. 3A), isobutene (Fig. 3B) or ethylene (Fig. 3C) adsorbed over the MoVTeNbO catalyst.

3.3. General remarks The results presented here show that C2C4 alkanes can be selectively activated over a MoVTeNbO catalyst. In all cases, the formation of the corresponding olefin seems to be the first step in the selective oxidative activation of lower alkanes. However, the adsorption/desorption behaviour of the olefinic intermediates and also the amount of olefin observed during the catalytic oxidation of lower alkanes change depending on the length of the alkane. In addition, the FTIR spectra of C2C4 olefins show that the activation mechanism and the nature of the intermediates change.

Conclusions MoVTeNbO-based catalysts present active sites of different nature in a single matrix [1126]. They have active sites for the selective oxidative activation of C2C4 alkanes. In addition, they have active and relatively selective sites for partial oxidation of olefins (except in the case of ethylene, in which a very low activity was observed).

According to this, a reaction network for propane and isobutane oxidation can be proposed (Fig. 5) in which the detection of reaction intermediates and the nature of the final reaction products depends on the more or less facility in the desorption of the corresponding reaction intermediates. It is clear that these aspects are clearly related to the nature and number of active sites in the catalyst. In addition, the different facility in the desorption of intermediates could determine the nature of the final reaction products, which is related to the structure of catalyst.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety involve understanding the complex interplay between the catalyst's active sites, the nature of the reactants, and the resulting reaction pathways. The nature of the final reaction products is influenced by the catalyst's structure and the ease of desorption of intermediates, which is closely related to the catalyst's active site characteristics.

The selectivity to reaction products varies significantly depending on the alkane's nature, with ethane and propane being less reactive. Ethylene shows a notably low catalytic activity in comparison to other olefins. The adsorption/desorption behavior of olefinic intermediates and the amount of olefin observed during the catalytic oxidation of lower alkanes depend on the alkane's length. FTIR studies reveal differences in activation mechanisms and intermediate species for various C2C4 olefins. A reaction network for propane and isobutane oxidation is proposed, where the nature of final products is determined by the catalyst's structure and the ease of desorption of reaction intermediates.

The conclusions highlight that MoVTeNbO-based catalysts have active sites for selective oxidative activation of C2C4 alkanes and selective partial oxidation of olefins, except for ethylene, which shows very low activity. The different reaction pathways and final products observed during the oxidation of propane and isobutane are attributed to the catalyst's structure and the varying desorption capabilities of intermediates.

在镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成方面，它们对氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）的电子结构和催化性能产生了影响。理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战在于理解催化剂活性位点、反应物性质与产物路径之间的复杂相互作用。最终产物的性质受到催化剂结构和中间体脱附能力的影响。

不同烷烃的性质导致选择性产物变化显著，其中乙烷和丙烷活性较低。乙烯在与其他烯烃相比显示极低的催化活性。不同长度的C2C4烯烃的吸附/脱附行为以及在催化氧化低烷烃过程中观察到的烯烃量取决于烷烃的长度。傅里叶变换红外光谱研究表明，各种C2C4烯烃的激活机制和中间物种存在差异。为丙烷和异丁烷氧化提出了一个反应网络，在其中检测到反应中间体和最终产物的性质取决于相应反应中间体脱附的可能性大小。这些方面明显与催化剂的活性位点特性有关。

结论指出，MoVTeNbO基催化剂具有用于选择性氧化激活C2C4烷烃的活性位点以及选择性部分氧化烯烃的能力（除了活性非常低的乙烯）。对于丙烷和异丁烷氧化，根据催化剂的结构和中间体脱附能力的不同，观察到不同的反应途径和最终产物。通过催化剂结构和中间体脱附能力的差异，可以解释在氧化丙烷和异丁烷过程中观察到的不同反应途径和最终产物。

The catalysts typically consist of two crystalline phases: the M1 phase, which is orthorhombic (AO)22x(A2O)xM20O56, and the M2 phase, which is orthorhombically distorted (A2O)M6O19. The main reaction products vary significantly depending on the alkane fed. For ethane, ethylene is the primary product with high selectivity. Acrylic acid is produced from propane, maleic anhydride from n-butane, and methacrolein from isobutane. The selectivity to reaction products differs greatly. Ethylene does not produce any oxygen-containing products other than COx. Ethylene has a selectivity of around 95% when oxidized from ethane, with no aldehydes or acids observed. The presence of olefins decreases from ethane to isobutane. Isobutene is practically not observed during the oxidation of isobutane within the tested conversion range. The nature of the reaction products and intermediates changes depending on the alkane fed. The catalyst shows a low conversion in ethylene oxidation. The reaction rate for ethane is notably higher than for ethylene (rC2=rC2 < 0:1).
