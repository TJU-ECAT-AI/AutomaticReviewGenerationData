[1] "MoVTeNb oxidic bronze catalyst, with a Mo/V/Te/Nb atomic ratio of 1/0.24/0.24/0.13, was prepared hydrothermally from an aqueous solution containing ammonium heptamolybdate tetra- hydrate, vanadyl sulphate, telluric acid and niobium oxalate, according to the procedure previously proposed [22]."
[2] "The XRD pattern of the catalyst is characterized by Bragg reflections at 2u = 6.6, 7.7, 8.9, 10.7, 22.1, 27.2, 29.2, 35.48, indicating the presence of M1 phase [22]."
[3] "Regarding the selectivity to reaction products, very different patterns have been observed."
[4] "Fig. 1 shows the selectivity to the main partial oxidation products achieved during the partial oxidation of the C2C4 alkanes at 400 °C and an alkane conversion of ca. 25%."
[5] "In the case of ethylene no oxygen containing products different from COx were observed."
[6] "The reactivity of the olefins is remarkably higher than that of the alkanes, with olefin/alkane of ca. 24 rC2H6/rC2H8, 31 rC3H8/rC3H10 and 38 rC4H8/rC4H10."
[7] "In this way, isobutene was practically not observed during the oxidation of isobutane in all the isobutane conversion range studied (from 5% to 25% isobutane conversion)."
[8] "An increase in the reactivity of the olefin has been reported to favour a higher reduction of the catalyst surface [27]."
[9] "The adsorption of ethylene on MoVTeNbO catalyst is shown in Fig. 3C."
[10] "In the case of isobutane oxidation, isobutene is practically not observed even at low isobutane conversion."
[11] "In our case, acrylic acid and methacrolein are the main partial oxidation products achieved during the partial oxidation of propane and isobutane, respectively."
[12] "However, a fast combustion is observed at high isobutane conversion rather than the formation of methacrylic acid (Fig. 5b)."
[13] "This has been explained due to a considerably lower oxidation rate of methacrolein compared to that of acrolein, while in the undesired subsequent oxidation of carboxylic acids, methacrylic acid is of the same order of magnitude as the oxidation of acrylic acid [43a]."

1. The MoVTeNb oxidic bronze catalyst was prepared hydrothermally with a specific atomic ratio and from particular chemical compounds. Its XRD pattern indicated the presence of the M1 phase.

2. The catalyst showed different selectivities towards various reaction products.

3. Figure 1 depicted the selectivity of the main partial oxidation products achieved during the partial oxidation of C2C4 alkanes.

4. No oxygen-containing products other than COx were observed during ethylene oxidation.

5. The reactivity of olefins was significantly higher than that of alkanes.

6. Isobutene was not observed during the oxidation of isobutane within the tested conversion range.

7. The reactivity of olefins can enhance the reduction of the catalyst surface.

8. Ethylene adsorption on the MoVTeNbO catalyst was characterized.

9. The nature of the reaction products during propane and isobutane oxidation differed.

10. Fast combustion was observed during high isobutane conversion instead of methacrylic acid formation.

11. Acrylic acid and methacrolein were identified as the main products from propane and isobutane oxidation, respectively.

12. The lack of methacrylic acid formation was attributed to the slower oxidation rate of methacrolein compared to acrolein.

13. The selectivity towards methacrylic acid was moderate over MoV-based catalysts due to the lower oxidation rate of methacrolein and the similarity of oxidation rates for both acids in subsequent reactions.
