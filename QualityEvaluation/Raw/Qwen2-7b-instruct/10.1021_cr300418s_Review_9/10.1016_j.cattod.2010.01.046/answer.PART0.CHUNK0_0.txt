[1] "Typically, the most efficient MoVTe(Sb)NbO catalysts present generally two crystalline phases: (i) an orthorhombic (AO)22x(A2O)xM20O56 (A = Te or Sb and M = Mo, V, Nb; with 0 < x <1), the so-called M1 phase; and (ii) an orthorhombically distorted (A2O)M6O19 phase (A = Te or Sb and M = Mo, V, Nb), the so-called M2 phase."
[2] "Pure M1 phase based catalysts can be obtained by hydrothermal synthesis or by using post-synthesis treatment."
[3] "In this paper it will be presented a comparative study on the partial oxidation of C2C4 alkanes over a MoVTeNbO mixed metal oxide catalyst, prepared hydrothermally, and presenting the M1 phase."
[4] "The main reaction products have been: ethylene from ethane, acrylic acid from propane, maleic anhydride from n-butane and methacrolein from isobutane."
[5] "According to these results different reaction pathways will be proposed."
[6] "The XRD pattern of the catalyst is characterized by Bragg reflections at 2u = 6.6, 7.7, 8.9, 10.7, 22.1, 27.2, 29.2, 35.48, indicating the presence of M1 phase [22]."
[7] "However, the presence of M2 as a minority phase cannot be ruled out."
[8] "Regarding the selectivity to reaction products, very different patterns have been observed."
[9] "On the other hand, we must indicate that no changes in the XRD patterns of catalyst after the catalytic tests were observed."
[10] "Fig. 1 shows the selectivity to the main partial oxidation products achieved during the partial oxidation of the C2C4 alkanes at 400 8C and an alkane conversion of ca. 25%."
[11] "In the oxidation of ethane, ethylene was the only partial oxidation product, with a selectivity to ethylene of ca. 95%, meanwhile no aldehydes or acids were observed."
[12] "However, in the case of C3C4 alkanes, the nature of the main partial oxidation products changes depending on the alkane fed."
[13] "Thus, acrylic acid and propene (from propane), maleic anhydride and butadiene (from n-butane) and methacrolein (from isobutane) were mainly observed (Fig. 1)."
[14] "We must notice that the sum of the selectivities to the main partial oxidation products (i.e. olefin and O-containing products) strongly depends on the alkane fed and decreases according to the following trend (Fig. 1):ethane > propane > n-butane > isobutane."
[15] "On the other hand, the presence of olefins in the reaction products decreases also from ethane to isobutane."
[16] "In this way, isobutene was practically not observed during the oxidation of isobutane in all the isobutane conversion range studied (from 5% to 25% isobutane conversion)."
[17] "Fig. 2 shows the variation of the yield to the main reaction products achieved during the oxidation of C2C4 olefins at 380 8C and a contact time, W/F, of 75 gcat h mololefin 1 (Fig. 2 a) and the variation of the selectivity to the partial oxidation products achieved during the oxidation of C2C4 olefins at 380 8C and an olefin isoconversion of 20% (Fig. 2b)."
[18] "According to these results, it can be concluded that the same O-containing products were achieved from alkanes (Fig. 1) and from the corresponding olefins (Fig. 2a), although the selectivity to the main partial oxidation products observed during the partial oxidation of olefins was higher than those achieved from the corresponding alkanes."
[19] "In the case of ethylene no oxygen containing products different from COx were observed."
[20] "In addition, we must inform that the catalyst studied here presents a very low conversion in ethylene oxidation (Fig. 2a), which explains the high selectivity to ethylene observed during the oxidation of ethane."
[21] "Meanwhile the reaction rate for ethane is much higher than the rate for ethylene (rC2=rC2 < 0:1)."
[22] "In the case of the C3C4 hydrocarbons, the reactivity of the olefins is remarkably higher than that of the alkanes, with rolefin/ralkane of ca. 24 rC3H6=rC3H8, 31 r1C4H8=rnC4H10 and 38 riC4H8=riC4H10."
[23] "An increase in the reactivity of the olefin has been reported to favour a higher reduction of the catalyst surface [27]."
[24] "Thus, one could expect that the reduction degree of the catalysts during the oxidation of isobutene [28] must be higher than during the propene oxidation [29,30] favouring a lower extension of the consecutive conversion to acid or anhydrides."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The M1 phase typically found in MoVTe(Sb)NbO catalysts, composed of orthorhombic (AO)22x(A2O)xM20O56 and orthorhombically distorted (A2O)M6O19 phases, plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity. Pure M1 phase catalysts can be obtained through hydrothermal synthesis or post-synthesis treatments. The selectivity and nature of the reaction products depend on the alkane fed, showing distinct patterns for ethane, propane, n-butane, and isobutane. The selectivity to reaction products varies significantly, with ethane having the highest selectivity, followed by propane, n-butane, and isobutane. The presence of olefins in the reaction products decreases from ethane to isobutane, with isobutene practically not observed during isobutane oxidation. The reactivity of the olefins is higher than that of the alkanes, leading to different reaction pathways and products. The catalysts' electronic structure and the nature of active sites are critical factors in determining their catalytic performance and selectivity. Theoretical modeling faces challenges in accurately predicting the complex interactions within the catalyst and the reaction mechanisms. Process optimization requires balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety, often necessitating experimental validation and fine-tuning of operational conditions. The balance between these factors is essential for achieving optimal catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
