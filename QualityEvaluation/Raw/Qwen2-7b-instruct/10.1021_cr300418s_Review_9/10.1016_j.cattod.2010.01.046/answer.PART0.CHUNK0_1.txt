[1] "Typically, the most efficient MoVTe(Sb)NbO catalysts present generally two crystalline phases: (i) an orthorhombic (AO)22x(A2O)xM20O56 (A = Te or Sb and M = Mo, V, Nb; with 0 < x <1), the so-called M1 phase; and (ii) an orthorhombically distorted (A2O)M6O19 phase (A = Te or Sb and M = Mo, V, Nb), the so-called M2 phase."
[2] "However, the low reactivity of ethylene on MoVTeNbO catalyst is observed, which is an anomalous behaviour if compared to the other olefins studied."
[3] "In our case, acrylic acid and methacrolein are the main partial oxidation products achieved during the partial oxidation of propane and isobutane, respectively."
[4] "The nature of the partial oxidation products depends also on the length of alkanes and olefins as reported on other catalytic systems."

1. Typically, the most efficient MoVTe(Sb)NbO catalysts consist of two crystalline phases: the M1 phase, which is orthorhombic (AO)22x(A2O)xM20O56 (where A is either Te or Sb, and M is Mo, V, or Nb), and the M2 phase, which is orthorhombically distorted (A2O)M6O19 (with A being either Te or Sb, and M being Mo, V, or Nb).

2. The catalyst shows an unusual behavior regarding ethylene, exhibiting low reactivity compared to other olefins tested.

3. During the partial oxidation of propane, acrylic acid is the main product achieved. For isobutane, methacrolein is the predominant product.

4. The nature of the partial oxidation products varies based on the length of the alkanes and olefins, aligning with observations from other catalytic systems.

1. 通常，效率最高的MoVTe(Sb)NbO催化剂包含两种晶态相：M1相，其为正交晶体结构(AO)22x(A2O)xM20O56（其中A为Te或Sb，M为Mo、V或Nb），以及M2相，其为正交畸变的(A2O)M6O19相（其中A为Te或Sb，M为Mo、V或Nb）。

2. 该催化剂在乙烷氧化中的低活性行为是与其它烯烃测试结果对比下的一种异常现象。

3. 在丙烷的氧化过程中，主要产物为丙烯酸。对于异丁烷，甲基丙烯醛为主要产物。

4. 部分氧化产物的性质依赖于烷烃和烯烃的长度，这与其它催化系统的观察结果一致。
