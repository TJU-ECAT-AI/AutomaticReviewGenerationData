[1] "Following our former study of the CO/NiOs100d system [Phys. Rev. B 69, 075413 (2004)], we have investigated the geometrical, electronic, and magnetic properties of NO adsorbed on NiO(100) to further elucidate the role of strong electron correlations in the substrate on the chemisorption of small molecules."
[2] "DFT+U calculations predict NO to be almost unbound in an upright configuration. In a tilted configuration, a hybridization of the 2p* molecular orbital with the Ni dz2 states, which is symmetry forbidden in the upright configuration, provides an alternative mechanism for the formation of a weak covalent adsorbate-substrate bond."
[3] "The energetic, geometric, vibrational, and magnetic properties of the adsorbate/substrate complex are strongly influenced by this alternative mechanism."
[4] "Our results demonstrate that, as suggested by earlier studies, the on-site Coulomb repulsion in the Ni d band plays a decisive role in the description of adsorption on transition-metal oxides and that DFT+U provides a sound description of chemisorption on these difficult systems."

In the study of NO adsorption on NiO(100), the researchers explored the geometrical, electronic, and magnetic properties of NO adsorbed on the surface. They utilized DFT, DFT+U, and other computational methods to understand the role of strong electron correlations in the substrate. The DFT+U approach proved effective in describing the chemisorption of small molecules on transition-metal oxides, demonstrating the significance of on-site Coulomb repulsion in the Ni d band. This study contributes to the understanding of adsorption processes on complex surfaces.
