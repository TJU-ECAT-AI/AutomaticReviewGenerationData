[I] "As for CO/NiOs100d, density-functional theory (DFT, both in the local-density and in the generalized gradient approximations) strongly overestimates the adsorption strength, but in contrast to CO, the strongly tilted adsorption geometry of NO is correctly predicted even at the DFT level."
[II] "DFT+U calculations predict NO to be almost unbound in an upright configuration. In a tilted configuration, a hybridization of the 2p* molecular orbital with the Ni dz2 states, which is symmetry forbidden in the upright configuration, provides an alternative mechanism for the formation of a weak covalent adsorbate-substrate bond."
[III] "The NiuNO bond length is found to be 1.88 Å (Ref. 3), an NO bond-length of 1.12 Å is reported, but with a substantial uncertainty of 0.15 Å."
[IV] "The NO/NiO system involves the interaction of a paramagnetic molecule with an antiferromagnetic surface. Because of the magnetic nature of both the adsorbate and the substrate and the difficulty to describe the intrashell Coulomb repulsion in 3d transition-metal ions, this problem represents a challenge to theory."
[V] "The magnetic interactions between the antiferromagnetic substrate and the paramagnetic molecule lead to a lifting of the degeneracy of the 2p* molecular orbital and a strong intramolecular flow of electrons from 2py * to 2pz * states, enhancing the hybridization with the Ni dz2 states."

1. Density-functional theory (DFT) overestimates the adsorption strength for CO/NiOs100d, but it correctly predicts the strongly tilted adsorption geometry of NO even without corrections for strong electron correlations.
2. DFT+U calculations show that NO is almost unbound in an upright configuration, but a tilted configuration allows for a weak covalent bond formation through hybridization with Ni dz2 states.
3. The NiuNO bond length is 1.88 Å, with a reported NO bond-length of 1.12 Å, though there is significant uncertainty.
4. The interaction between NO and NiO involves a paramagnetic molecule with an antiferromagnetic surface, presenting a challenge for theoretical models due to the complexity of magnetic interactions.
5. Magnetic interactions cause a lifting of the 2p* orbital degeneracy, facilitating electron flow from 2py * to 2pz * states, which enhances the covalent bond formation between NO and NiO.

1. 对于CO/NiOs100d，密度泛函理论（DFT）高估了吸附强度，但与CO不同，NO的强烈倾斜吸附几何结构即使在DFT水平上也能正确预测。
2. DFT+U计算表明，在直立配置中，NO几乎是未绑定的，但在倾斜配置中，通过与Ni dz2状态的杂化，允许形成弱共价吸附剂-基体键。
3. NiuNO键长为1.88 Å，报告的NO键长为1.12 Å，但存在显著的不确定性。
4. NO和NiO之间的相互作用涉及一个顺磁分子与反铁磁表面，由于3d过渡金属离子内部壳层库仑斥力难以描述，这给理论模型带来了挑战。
5. 磁相互作用导致2p*能级退度的提升，使得电子从2py *流向2pz *状态，从而增强了NO和NiO之间的共价键形成。
