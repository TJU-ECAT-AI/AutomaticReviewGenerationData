[1] "The strong on-site correlations lead to a qualitative change in the adsorption behavior of NO, but at the LSDA +U level, the molecule is still slightly overbound."
[2] "In contrast to CO/NiO were the molecule is adsorbed in a nearly upright geometry, a vertically adsorbed NO molecule is nearly unbound on NiO and the higher adsorption energy for NO than for CO is entirely a consequence of the strong dz2-2p* hybridization enabled by the tilted geometry."
[3] "The magnetic interactions between the antiferromagnetic substrate and the paramagnetic molecule lead to a lifting of the degeneracy of the 2p* molecular orbital and a strong intramolecular flow of electrons from 2py * to 2pz * states, enhancing the hybridization with the Ni dz2 states."
[4] "The most direct illustration of the mechanism leading to a tilted adsorption geometry is provided by a charge flow analysis."
[5] "The electron redistribution is reflected in the magnetization densities, as shown in Fig. 4b."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the complex interactions within the catalyst's electronic structure. Process optimization requires balancing factors such as reaction efficiency, product selectivity, and operational safety. The document illustrates how the adsorption behavior of NO on NiO changes qualitatively due to strong on-site correlations, leading to a higher adsorption energy compared to CO. This difference is explained by the strong hybridization between the 2p* molecular orbital and the Ni dz2 states, facilitated by a tilted adsorption geometry. Magnetic interactions between the antiferromagnetic substrate and the paramagnetic NO molecule play a crucial role in modifying the molecular orbital degeneracy and redistributing electrons within the molecule. This electron redistribution affects the magnetization densities, influencing the overall catalytic activity and selectivity of the system.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响其在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能。理论建模的挑战在于准确预测催化剂内部复杂的相互作用。过程优化需要平衡诸如反应效率、产品选择性和操作安全性等因素。文档说明了NO在NiO上的吸附行为由于强烈的局域电荷效应而发生了质的变化，导致与CO相比更高的吸附能。这种差异归因于强烈的2p*分子轨道与Ni dz2状态之间的杂化，这得益于倾斜的吸附几何。磁性相互作用在抗磁性基底和顺磁性NO分子之间起着关键作用，修改了分子轨道的退度，并在分子内重新分布电子。这种电子重排影响磁化密度，进而影响系统的整体催化活性和选择性。
