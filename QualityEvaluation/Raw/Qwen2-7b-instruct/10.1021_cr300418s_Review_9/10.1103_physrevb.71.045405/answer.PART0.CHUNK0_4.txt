[1] "We have investigated the adsorption of NO on the NiO(100) surface, complementing our former study of CO on NiO(100) (Ref. 1 hereafter, this paper will be referred to as I) and with the aim to further elucidate the effects of strong electronic correlation in NiO on the chemisorption of small molecules."
[2] "The NO/NiO system involves the interaction of a paramagnetic molecule with an antiferromagnetic surface."
[3] "The interesting properties of molecular adsorbates on NiO(100) have also attracted the interests of theorists."
[4] "A very comprehensive cluster study of the bonding of NO to NiO(100) using HF and post-HF techniques and density-functional theory (DFT) has been conducted by Di Valentin et al. (14) and later continued by Chiesa et al. (10)"
[5] "In the present paper we report on periodic DFT and post-DFT calculations of the adsorption of NO on antiferromagnetic NiO(100)."
[6] "In both DFT and DFT+U methods, as well as in the other theoretical studies, tilting of NO is energetically favorable."
[7] "But whereas the tilting direction in DFT is towards the nearest-neighbor oxygen atom (i.e., along the [011] direction), DFT+U prefers the [001] direction towards the nearest-neighbor nickel site (see Fig. 2)."
[8] "The NiuN bond lengths from the HFLYP, B3LYP, and BLYP calculations agree quite well with our LSDA+U results."
[9] "The NO bond length is only marginally increased compared to the free NO molecule, but the increase is higher for DFT than for DFT+U calculations."
[10] "HF-based calculations predict the NO molecule to be unbound, with a large endothermic adsorption energy. Hybrid functionals work better, with the BLYP calculations overestimating the adsorption strength, similarly to the DFT calculations."
[11] "Within both the SGGA and the SGGA+U, the energy gain due to the tilting of the molecule accounts for about three-quarters of the adsorption energy (see Table I and Fig. 2)."
[12] "Correlation effects also influence the magnetic properties of the adsorbate-substrate complex."
[13] "Within the SGGA (which underestimates the antiferromagnetic moment of Ni in bulk NiO; cf. I), the magnetic moment of a Ni atom to which an NO molecule is attached is reduced by nearly 40% in an upright configuration and by about 60% if the energetically favorable tilting is admitted."
[14] "In the tilted configuration, the molecule is practically completely demagnetized."
[15] "Within the SGGA+U (which produces an antiferromagnetic moment in good agreement with experiment), the magnetic moments of both adsorbate and substrate are essentially unchanged as long as the upright geometry is assumed."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure modifications caused by these factors. Process optimization aims to balance efficiency, selectivity, and safety. However, the document does not provide specific details on how these factors affect catalyst performance or the challenges in modeling them. The focus is on the adsorption properties of NO on NiO(100) and the role of strong electron correlations.

在镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成等影响下，它们的电子结构和氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）的催化性能会发生显著变化。理论建模的关键挑战包括准确预测这些因素引起的电子结构变化。过程优化旨在平衡效率、选择性和安全性。然而，文档没有提供这些因素如何影响催化剂性能或在建模中面临的挑战的详细信息。重点是研究NO在NiO(100)表面的吸附性质及其强电子相关性的作用。
