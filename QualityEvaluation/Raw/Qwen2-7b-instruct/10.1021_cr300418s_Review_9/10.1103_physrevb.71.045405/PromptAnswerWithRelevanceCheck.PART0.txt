[3] "High-resolution electron energy loss (HREELS) experiments2,6 have demonstrated that the NuO stretching frequency of the adsorbed molecule is redshifted by about 80 cm1 compared to the gas phase, whereas the stretching mode of adsorbed CO remains nearly unchanged compared to the free molecule."
[4] "Within the SGGA (which underestimates the antiferromagnetic moment of Ni in bulk NiO; cf. I), the magnetic moment of a Ni atom to which an NO molecule is attached is reduced by nearly 40% in an upright configuration and by about 60% if the energeti- cally favorable tilting is admitted."

The research investigated the adsorption of NO on NiO(100), focusing on the geometrical, electronic, and magnetic properties of the NO adsorbed on the surface. The study utilized density-functional theory (DFT) and the DFT+U approach, which incorporates a Hubbard term to describe the strong on-site Coulomb interactions in the substrate. The DFT+U method provided a better description of the surface physics and chemistry of the system compared to DFT alone, especially in terms of the adsorption energy and the formation of a weak covalent bond between the NO molecule and the NiO surface. The calculations revealed that the strong electronic correlation in NiO affects the adsorption behavior of NO, leading to a nearly unbound NO molecule on NiO in a vertical configuration. The tilted geometry enables a hybridization of the 2p* molecular orbital with the Ni dz2 states, providing an alternative mechanism for the formation of a weak covalent bond. The energetic, geometric, vibrational, and magnetic properties of the adsorbate/substrate complex are significantly influenced by this hybridization mechanism. The DFT+U approach accounted for the on-site Coulomb repulsion in the Ni d band, demonstrating its decisive role in the description of adsorption on transition-metal oxides.

研究分析了NO在NiO(100)表面的吸附，着重探讨了NO吸附在表面的几何、电子和磁性特性。研究采用了密度泛函理论（DFT）和DFT+U方法，后者通过引入Hubbard项来描述在基质中的强局域电荷相互作用。DFT+U方法在描述该难解系统时提供了更好的表面物理和化学特性，特别是在吸附能和NO分子与NiO表面之间形成弱共价键方面。计算结果表明，NiO中的强电子关联影响了NO的吸附行为，在垂直配置下使得NO分子几乎未被NiO吸附。倾斜的几何形状允许2p*分子轨道与Ni dz2状态的杂化，提供了一种形成弱共价键的替代机制。吸附剂/基质复合物的能量、几何、振动和磁性性质受到这种杂化机制的显著影响。DFT+U方法考虑了Ni d带内的局域电荷排斥，证明了它在描述过渡金属氧化物吸附方面的决定性作用。

[I] "As for CO/NiOs100d, density-functional theory (DFT, both in the local-density and in the generalized gradient approximations) strongly overestimates the adsorption strength, but in contrast to CO, the strongly tilted adsorption geometry of NO is correctly predicted even at the DFT level."
[II] "DFT+U calculations predict NO to be almost unbound in an upright configuration. In a tilted configuration, a hybridization of the 2p* molecular orbital with the Ni dz2 states, which is symmetry forbidden in the upright configuration, provides an alternative mechanism for the formation of a weak covalent adsorbate-substrate bond."
[III] "The NiuNO bond length is found to be 1.88 Å (Ref. 3), an NO bond-length of 1.12 Å is reported, but with a substantial uncertainty of 0.15 Å."
[IV] "The NO/NiO system involves the interaction of a paramagnetic molecule with an antiferromagnetic surface. Because of the magnetic nature of both the adsorbate and the substrate and the difficulty to describe the intrashell Coulomb repulsion in 3d transition-metal ions, this problem represents a challenge to theory."
[V] "The magnetic interactions between the antiferromagnetic substrate and the paramagnetic molecule lead to a lifting of the degeneracy of the 2p* molecular orbital and a strong intramolecular flow of electrons from 2py * to 2pz * states, enhancing the hybridization with the Ni dz2 states."

1. 对于CO/NiOs100d，密度泛函理论（DFT）高估了吸附强度，但与CO不同，NO的强烈倾斜吸附几何结构即使在DFT水平上也能正确预测。
2. DFT+U计算表明，在直立配置中，NO几乎是未绑定的，但在倾斜配置中，通过与Ni dz2状态的杂化，允许形成弱共价吸附剂-基体键。
3. NiuNO键长为1.88 Å，报告的NO键长为1.12 Å，但存在显著的不确定性。

[1] "The strong on-site correlations lead to a qualitative change in the adsorption behavior of NO, but at the LSDA +U level, the molecule is still slightly overbound."
[2] "In contrast to CO/NiO were the molecule is adsorbed in a nearly upright geometry, a vertically adsorbed NO molecule is nearly unbound on NiO and the higher adsorption energy for NO than for CO is entirely a consequence of the strong dz2-2p* hybridization enabled by the tilted geometry."
[3] "The magnetic interactions between the antiferromagnetic substrate and the paramagnetic molecule lead to a lifting of the degeneracy of the 2p* molecular orbital and a strong intramolecular flow of electrons from 2py * to 2pz * states, enhancing the hybridization with the Ni dz2 states."
[4] "The most direct illustration of the mechanism leading to a tilted adsorption geometry is provided by a charge flow analysis."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the complex interactions within the catalyst's electronic structure. Process optimization requires balancing factors such as reaction efficiency, product selectivity, and operational safety. The document illustrates how the adsorption behavior of NO on NiO changes qualitatively due to strong on-site correlations, leading to a higher adsorption energy compared to CO. This difference is explained by the strong hybridization between the 2p* molecular orbital and the Ni dz2 states, facilitated by a tilted adsorption geometry. Magnetic interactions between the antiferromagnetic substrate and the paramagnetic NO molecule play a crucial role in modifying the molecular orbital degeneracy and redistributing electrons within the molecule. This electron redistribution affects the magnetization densities, influencing the overall catalytic activity and selectivity of the system.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响其在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能。理论建模的挑战在于准确预测催化剂内部复杂的相互作用。过程优化需要平衡诸如反应效率、产品选择性和操作安全性等因素。文档说明了NO在NiO上的吸附行为由于强烈的局域电荷效应而发生了质的变化，导致与CO相比更高的吸附能。这种差异归因于强烈的2p*分子轨道与Ni dz2状态之间的杂化，这得益于倾斜的吸附几何。磁性相互作用在抗磁性基底和顺磁性NO分子之间起着关键作用，修改了分子轨道的退度，并在分子内重新分布电子。这种电子重排影响磁化密度，进而影响系统的整体催化活性和选择性。

[5] "In the present paper we report on periodic DFT and post-DFT calculations of the adsorption of NO on antiferromagnetic NiO(100)."
[6] "In both DFT and DFT+U methods, as well as in the other theoretical studies, tilting of NO is energetically favorable."
[7] "But whereas the tilting direction in DFT is towards the nearest-neighbor oxygen atom (i.e., along the [011] direction), DFT+U prefers the [001] direction towards the nearest-neighbor nickel site (see Fig. 2)."
[8] "The NiuN bond lengths from the HFLYP, B3LYP, and BLYP calculations agree quite well with our LSDA+U results."
[9] "The NO bond length is only marginally increased compared to the free NO molecule, but the increase is higher for DFT than for DFT+U calculations."
[10] "HF-based calculations predict the NO molecule to be unbound, with a large endothermic adsorption energy. Hybrid functionals work better, with the BLYP calculations overestimating the adsorption strength, similarly to the DFT calculations."
[11] "Within both the SGGA and the SGGA+U, the energy gain due to the tilting of the molecule accounts for about three-quarters of the adsorption energy (see Table I and Fig. 2)."
[12] "Correlation effects also influence the magnetic properties of the adsorbate-substrate complex."
[13] "Within the SGGA (which underestimates the antiferromagnetic moment of Ni in bulk NiO; cf. I), the magnetic moment of a Ni atom to which an NO molecule is attached is reduced by nearly 40% in an upright configuration and by about 60% if the energetically favorable tilting is admitted."
[14] "In the tilted configuration, the molecule is practically completely demagnetized."
[15] "Within the SGGA+U (which produces an antiferromagnetic moment in good agreement with experiment), the magnetic moments of both adsorbate and substrate are essentially unchanged as long as the upright geometry is assumed."
