[3] "High-resolution electron energy loss (HREELS) experiments2,6 have demonstrated that the NuO stretching frequency of the adsorbed molecule is redshifted by about 80 cm1 compared to the gas phase, whereas the stretching mode of adsorbed CO remains nearly unchanged compared to the free molecule."
[4] "Within the SGGA (which underestimates the antiferromagnetic moment of Ni in bulk NiO; cf. I), the magnetic moment of a Ni atom to which an NO molecule is attached is reduced by nearly 40% in an upright configuration and by about 60% if the energeti- cally favorable tilting is admitted."

The research investigated the adsorption of NO on NiO(100), focusing on the geometrical, electronic, and magnetic properties of the NO adsorbed on the surface. The study utilized density-functional theory (DFT) and the DFT+U approach, which incorporates a Hubbard term to describe the strong on-site Coulomb interactions in the substrate. The DFT+U method provided a better description of the surface physics and chemistry of the system compared to DFT alone, especially in terms of the adsorption energy and the formation of a weak covalent bond between the NO molecule and the NiO surface. The calculations revealed that the strong electronic correlation in NiO affects the adsorption behavior of NO, leading to a nearly unbound NO molecule on NiO in a vertical configuration. The tilted geometry enables a hybridization of the 2p* molecular orbital with the Ni dz2 states, providing an alternative mechanism for the formation of a weak covalent bond. The energetic, geometric, vibrational, and magnetic properties of the adsorbate/substrate complex are significantly influenced by this hybridization mechanism. The DFT+U approach accounted for the on-site Coulomb repulsion in the Ni d band, demonstrating its decisive role in the description of adsorption on transition-metal oxides.

研究分析了NO在NiO(100)表面的吸附，着重探讨了NO吸附在表面的几何、电子和磁性特性。研究采用了密度泛函理论（DFT）和DFT+U方法，后者通过引入Hubbard项来描述在基质中的强局域电荷相互作用。DFT+U方法在描述该难解系统时提供了更好的表面物理和化学特性，特别是在吸附能和NO分子与NiO表面之间形成弱共价键方面。计算结果表明，NiO中的强电子关联影响了NO的吸附行为，在垂直配置下使得NO分子几乎未被NiO吸附。倾斜的几何形状允许2p*分子轨道与Ni dz2状态的杂化，提供了一种形成弱共价键的替代机制。吸附剂/基质复合物的能量、几何、振动和磁性性质受到这种杂化机制的显著影响。DFT+U方法考虑了Ni d带内的局域电荷排斥，证明了它在描述过渡金属氧化物吸附方面的决定性作用。
