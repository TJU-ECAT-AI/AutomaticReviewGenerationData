[1] "Rational design of robust nanocatalysts for CO oxidation and NOx reduction is crucial for many important applications such as pollution control and energy production."
[2] "One of the most important tasks for fundamental research is to attain a clear understanding of mechanisms: (1) how lattice oxygen atoms contribute toward chemical reactions and, (2) how dopants modify surface activity."
[3] "Interestingly, we found a bent CO2,ad structure as the transition state for the reaction: CO + oxide  CO2,gas + deficient oxide, on the clean ceria (111) surface."
[4] "Zr dopants further weaken the CeO bonds in the substrate and therefore facilitate direct formation of CO + OL  CO2,gas."
[5] "Unlike traditional density functional calculations, we explored metastable geometries, in particular, those with the CO2,ad groups."
[6] "It is intriguing that CO directly forms CO2 with the lattice O on CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) and desorbs easily afterward from the deficient substrate."
