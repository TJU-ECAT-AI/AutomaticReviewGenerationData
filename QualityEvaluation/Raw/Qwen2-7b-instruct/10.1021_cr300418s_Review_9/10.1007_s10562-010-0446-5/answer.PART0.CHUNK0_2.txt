[1] "One major findings is that CO easily grasps one lattice oxygen atom to form CO2."
[2] "Interestingly, we found a bent CO2,ad structure as the transition state for the reaction: CO + oxide  CO2,gas + deficient oxide, on the clean ceria (111) surface."
[3] "CO tends to strongly bind to CeO2 (110) at the O-bridge site [25, 26]."
[4] "Unlike the clean CeO2 (111) surface, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) efficiently attract CO molecules from the gas phase, as suggested by the sizable adsorption energy of 18.5 kcal/mol."
[5] "On the other hand, Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."
[6] "Therefore, we believe that Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (110) is still inactive for direct CO oxidation, although it is somewhat better than CeO2(110)."

The literature discusses the role of lattice oxygen in the CO oxidation process on ceria surfaces, particularly focusing on the CeO2(111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surfaces. The key points include:

1. CO easily binds with a lattice oxygen atom to form CO2 on these surfaces, with activation energies that allow for facile reaction pathways.
2. A bent CO2,ad structure is identified as the transition state for CO oxidation on the clean ceria (111) surface.
3. CO has a stronger binding affinity to the CeO2(110) surface at the O-bridge site, compared to the (111) surface.
4. Zr dopants facilitate CO oxidation by weakening the Ce-O bonds, reducing the energy cost for CO adsorption and increasing the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms.
5. The presence of Zr dopants allows for a direct CO2 formation on the (111) surface, indicating a significant improvement in the catalytic activity.
6. While Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(110) shows some improvement in activity, it remains less efficient than Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) for CO oxidation due to the endothermic nature of the reaction on the (110) surface.

These findings provide insights into the role of lattice oxygen and the impact of Zr doping on the catalytic properties of ceria surfaces, offering potential strategies for enhancing CO oxidation processes.

文献主要讨论了氧离子在氧化作用过程中对铈氧化物表面（特别是CeO2(111)和Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)表面）的作用。关键点包括：

1. CO容易与氧离子结合形成CO2，特别是在这些表面上，激活能允许反应路径易于进行。
2. 在干净的铈氧化物（111）表面上，发现了弯曲的CO2,ad结构作为氧化过程的过渡状态。
3. 相比（111）表面，CO在（110）表面上更倾向于强烈吸附于桥氧位点。
4. Zr掺杂通过削弱铈氧键，降低CO吸附的能量成本，并增加氧离子周围的活性，从而促进CO氧化。
5. Zr掺杂允许（111）表面上直接形成CO2，表明催化活性显著提高。
6. 尽管Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(110)在活动性上有所改善，但由于（110）表面上的热力学反应是吸热的，因此对于CO氧化仍不如Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)表面有效。

这些发现提供了关于氧离子作用以及Zr掺杂对铈氧化物表面催化性质影响的见解，为增强CO氧化过程提供潜在策略。
