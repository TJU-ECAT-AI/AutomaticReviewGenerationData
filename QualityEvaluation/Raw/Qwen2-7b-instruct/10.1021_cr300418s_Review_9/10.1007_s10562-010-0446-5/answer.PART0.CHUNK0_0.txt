[1] "One major findings is that CO easily grasps one lattice oxygen atom to form CO2."
[2] "This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."
[3] "Unlike the clean CeO2 (111) surface, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) efficiently attract CO molecules from the gas phase, as suggested by the sizable adsorption energy of 18.5 kcal/mol."
[4] "On the other hand, Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."
[5] "Indeed, a bent CO2  species was found on Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (110), as shown in Fig. 1c."

The role of lattice oxygen in the CO oxidation process on ceria surfaces, particularly CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111), is significant. CO easily forms CO2 with lattice oxygen, and this process occurs with a low activation energy, facilitating the direct formation and release of CO2. Zirconium (Zr) doping facilitates the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3, weakening the CeO bonds. This modification benefits the direct oxidation of CO on Zr-doped ceria. The presence of Zr dopants also reduces the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancies and increases the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity of Zr-doped ceria surfaces for CO oxidation.

在氧化亚铈表面，特别是氧化亚铈（111）和掺杂了锆的氧化亚铈（111），晶格氧的作用至关重要。一氧化碳很容易与晶格氧形成二氧化碳，并且这一过程具有较低的活化能，从而实现直接形成和释放二氧化碳。掺杂锆可以促进四价铈转化为三价铈，削弱铈氧键。这有利于在掺杂的氧化钇表面直接氧化一氧化碳。掺杂锆还能降低氧空位的形成能并增加晶格氧原子的流动性，从而增强氧化钇表面的催化活性。
