Systematic density-functional calculations have been performed to address an important issue for CO oxidation on redox ceria: the role of lattice oxygen.
One major findings is that CO easily grasps one lattice oxygen atom to form CO2 and CO2 on CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) with small activation energies.
Zr dopants facilitate the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3 and hence weaken the CeO bonds, which benefit the direct formation and release of CO2.
Interestingly, we found a bent CO2,ad structure as the transition state for the reaction: CO + oxide CO2,gas + deficient oxide, on the clean ceria (111) surface.
Zr-dopants further weaken the CeO bonds in the substrate and therefore facilitate direct formation of CO + OL CO2,gas.
These findings provide clear evidence of lattice oxygen contribution toward CO oxidation on ceria.

The document discusses how lattice oxygen plays a crucial role in the CO oxidation process on ceria surfaces. It highlights that CO easily binds with lattice oxygen atoms to form CO2 with small activation energies. Zirconium (Zr) doping reduces the Ce+4 oxidation state to Ce+3, weakening the CeO bonds and promoting the direct formation and release of CO2. The research also reveals a bent CO2 structure as a transition state for CO oxidation on clean ceria (111) surfaces. Additionally, Zr doping facilitates the direct formation of CO + OL to CO2, gasifying CO directly. These findings emphasize the importance of lattice oxygen in CO oxidation reactions and demonstrate the benefits of Zr doping in enhancing the activity of ceria catalysts.

文献讨论了氧位在氧化铈表面的CO氧化过程中的关键作用。它强调了CO很容易与氧位原子结合形成CO2，且激活能较小。锆(Zr)掺杂可以降低Ce+4的氧化状态到Ce+3，减弱CeO键，促进CO2的直接形成和释放。研究还揭示了在清洁的ceria（111）表面上，CO氧化的过渡态为弯曲的CO2结构。此外，Zr掺杂促进了CO + OL直接形成CO2，实现了CO的直接气化。这些发现强调了氧位在CO氧化反应中的重要性，并展示了Zr掺杂增强氧化铈催化剂活性的优势。
