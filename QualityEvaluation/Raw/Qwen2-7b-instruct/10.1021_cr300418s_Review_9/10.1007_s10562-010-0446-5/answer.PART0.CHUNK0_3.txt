[1] "One major findings is that CO easily grasps one lattice oxygen atom to form CO2  and CO2 on CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) with small activation energies."
[2] "Interestingly, we found a bent CO2,ad structure as the transition state for the reaction: CO + oxide  CO2,gas + deficient oxide, on the clean ceria (111) surface."
[3] "Zr dopants further weaken the CeO bonds in the substrate and therefore facilitate direct formation of CO + OL  CO2,gas."
[4] "Apparently, Zr dopants strongly change the reaction mechanism of CO oxidation on the ceria (111) surface."
[5] "Unlike the clean CeO2 (111) surface, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) efficiently attract CO molecules from the gas phase, as suggested by the sizable adsorption energy of 18.5 kcal/mol."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of dopants like Zr facilitates the CO oxidation process, as evidenced by the weakening of CeO bonds and the ease of CO forming CO2 directly. However, the document does not provide detailed information on how preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation specifically affect nickel oxide-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It also does not discuss the key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成可以显著影响其在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能。例如，掺杂剂如Zr能促进CO氧化过程，表现为CeO键的削弱以及CO直接形成CO2的便利性。然而，文献没有详细说明特定条件下镍氧化物基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中如何受到制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成的影响。此外，它也没有讨论在这些催化系统中理论建模的关键挑战、过程优化以及如何平衡效率、选择性和安全性。
