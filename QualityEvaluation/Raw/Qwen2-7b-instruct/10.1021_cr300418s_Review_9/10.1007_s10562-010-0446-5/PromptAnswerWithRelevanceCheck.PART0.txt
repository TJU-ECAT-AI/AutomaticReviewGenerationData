[1] "One major findings is that CO easily grasps one lattice oxygen atom to form CO2."
[2] "This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."
[3] "Unlike the clean CeO2 (111) surface, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) efficiently attract CO molecules from the gas phase, as suggested by the sizable adsorption energy of 18.5 kcal/mol."
[4] "On the other hand, Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."
[5] "Indeed, a bent CO2  species was found on Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (110), as shown in Fig. 1c."

The role of lattice oxygen in the CO oxidation process on ceria surfaces, particularly CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111), is significant. CO easily forms CO2 with lattice oxygen, and this process occurs with a low activation energy, facilitating the direct formation and release of CO2. Zirconium (Zr) doping facilitates the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3, weakening the CeO bonds. This modification benefits the direct oxidation of CO on Zr-doped ceria. The presence of Zr dopants also reduces the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancies and increases the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity of Zr-doped ceria surfaces for CO oxidation.

在氧化亚铈表面，特别是氧化亚铈（111）和掺杂了锆的氧化亚铈（111），晶格氧的作用至关重要。一氧化碳很容易与晶格氧形成二氧化碳，并且这一过程具有较低的活化能，从而实现直接形成和释放二氧化碳。掺杂锆可以促进四价铈转化为三价铈，削弱铈氧键。这有利于在掺杂的氧化钇表面直接氧化一氧化碳。掺杂锆还能降低氧空位的形成能并增加晶格氧原子的流动性，从而增强氧化钇表面的催化活性。

Systematic density-functional calculations have been performed to address an important issue for CO oxidation on redox ceria: the role of lattice oxygen.
One major findings is that CO easily grasps one lattice oxygen atom to form CO2 and CO2 on CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) with small activation energies.
Zr dopants facilitate the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3 and hence weaken the CeO bonds, which benefit the direct formation and release of CO2.
Interestingly, we found a bent CO2,ad structure as the transition state for the reaction: CO + oxide CO2,gas + deficient oxide, on the clean ceria (111) surface.
Zr-dopants further weaken the CeO bonds in the substrate and therefore facilitate direct formation of CO + OL CO2,gas.
These findings provide clear evidence of lattice oxygen contribution toward CO oxidation on ceria.

The document discusses how lattice oxygen plays a crucial role in the CO oxidation process on ceria surfaces. It highlights that CO easily binds with lattice oxygen atoms to form CO2 with small activation energies. Zirconium (Zr) doping reduces the Ce+4 oxidation state to Ce+3, weakening the CeO bonds and promoting the direct formation and release of CO2. The research also reveals a bent CO2 structure as a transition state for CO oxidation on clean ceria (111) surfaces. Additionally, Zr doping facilitates the direct formation of CO + OL to CO2, gasifying CO directly. These findings emphasize the importance of lattice oxygen in CO oxidation reactions and demonstrate the benefits of Zr doping in enhancing the activity of ceria catalysts.

文献讨论了氧位在氧化铈表面的CO氧化过程中的关键作用。它强调了CO很容易与氧位原子结合形成CO2，且激活能较小。锆(Zr)掺杂可以降低Ce+4的氧化状态到Ce+3，减弱CeO键，促进CO2的直接形成和释放。研究还揭示了在清洁的ceria（111）表面上，CO氧化的过渡态为弯曲的CO2结构。此外，Zr掺杂促进了CO + OL直接形成CO2，实现了CO的直接气化。这些发现强调了氧位在CO氧化反应中的重要性，并展示了Zr掺杂增强氧化铈催化剂活性的优势。

The literature discusses the role of lattice oxygen in the CO oxidation process on ceria surfaces, particularly focusing on the CeO2(111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surfaces. The key points include:

1. CO easily binds with a lattice oxygen atom to form CO2 on these surfaces, with activation energies that allow for facile reaction pathways.
2. A bent CO2,ad structure is identified as the transition state for CO oxidation on the clean ceria (111) surface.
3. CO has a stronger binding affinity to the CeO2(110) surface at the O-bridge site, compared to the (111) surface.
4. Zr dopants facilitate CO oxidation by weakening the Ce-O bonds, reducing the energy cost for CO adsorption and increasing the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms.
5. The presence of Zr dopants allows for a direct CO2 formation on the (111) surface, indicating a significant improvement in the catalytic activity.
6. While Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(110) shows some improvement in activity, it remains less efficient than Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) for CO oxidation due to the endothermic nature of the reaction on the (110) surface.

These findings provide insights into the role of lattice oxygen and the impact of Zr doping on the catalytic properties of ceria surfaces, offering potential strategies for enhancing CO oxidation processes.

文献主要讨论了氧离子在氧化作用过程中对铈氧化物表面（特别是CeO2(111)和Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)表面）的作用。关键点包括：

1. CO容易与氧离子结合形成CO2，特别是在这些表面上，激活能允许反应路径易于进行。
2. 在干净的铈氧化物（111）表面上，发现了弯曲的CO2,ad结构作为氧化过程的过渡状态。
3. 相比（111）表面，CO在（110）表面上更倾向于强烈吸附于桥氧位点。
4. Zr掺杂通过削弱铈氧键，降低CO吸附的能量成本，并增加氧离子周围的活性，从而促进CO氧化。
5. Zr掺杂允许（111）表面上直接形成CO2，表明催化活性显著提高。
6. 尽管Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(110)在活动性上有所改善，但由于（110）表面上的热力学反应是吸热的，因此对于CO氧化仍不如Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)表面有效。

这些发现提供了关于氧离子作用以及Zr掺杂对铈氧化物表面催化性质影响的见解，为增强CO氧化过程提供潜在策略。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of dopants like Zr facilitates the CO oxidation process, as evidenced by the weakening of CeO bonds and the ease of CO forming CO2 directly. However, the document does not provide detailed information on how preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation specifically affect nickel oxide-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It also does not discuss the key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.
