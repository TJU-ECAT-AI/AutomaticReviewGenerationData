III.1 Chemical Compensation Effect

For example, examination of the energy of making a surface oxygen vacancy in the top oxygen layer of CeO2(111) (row 1, column 3 of Table 1) is 3.00 eV. The energy of making an oxygen vacancy on LaCeO2(111), at the position shown in Figure 1b (ignore the H atom present in that figure), is 1.36 eV (row 3, column 3 of Table 1). 

It is striking how little ΔECH4 changes with the position of the compensating H atom (see Table 3).

The binding energy of H (alone on the surface) is 1.24 eV and that of CH3 (alone on the surface) is 2.71 eV. 

The energy to dissociate CH4 and bind the fragments on two separate, undoped ceria surfaces is 2.90  1.24  2.71 = 1.05 eV.

The literature discusses the impact of doping oxides with cations of lower valence on their catalytic performance. It highlights two rules: (1) the presence of the dopant enhances the oxidizing capability of the oxide, and (2) adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts the dopant's effect, leading to a chemical compensation effect. The calculations show that the presence of a low valence dopant makes it easier to remove an oxygen atom from the surface, and that H and CH3 bind more strongly to the doped oxide surface compared to the undoped one. The energy required for the dissociative adsorption of methane to form a hydroxyl and a methoxy group is also significantly higher on the doped oxide. Additionally, the adsorption of an electron donor on the doped oxide modifies the electron deficiency created by the dopant, increasing the strength of the oxygen bond and making the surface less reactive, a phenomenon known as the chemical compensation effect. This effect is observed when analyzing the energies of various probe reactions on the surfaces of various oxides doped with different low valence dopants.

文献讨论了在氧化物中掺入较低价态阳离子对其催化性能的影响。它提出了两条规则：（1）掺杂剂的存在提高了氧化物的氧化能力，（2）在表面吸附电子供体可以抵消掺杂剂的作用，导致化学补偿效应。计算结果显示，掺杂低价阳离子使从表面去除氧原子变得更加容易，并且与未掺杂的氧化物相比，H和CH3在掺杂氧化物表面上的结合强度更大。甲烷的解离吸附形成羟基和甲氧基的能垒在掺杂氧化物上也显著更高。此外，吸附电子供体到掺杂氧化物上修改了由掺杂剂产生的电子缺乏，增加了表面氧键的强度并使表面活性降低，这一现象称为化学补偿效应。这种效应在分析不同低价掺杂剂掺杂的各种氧化物表面的各种探针反应的能量时被观察到。
