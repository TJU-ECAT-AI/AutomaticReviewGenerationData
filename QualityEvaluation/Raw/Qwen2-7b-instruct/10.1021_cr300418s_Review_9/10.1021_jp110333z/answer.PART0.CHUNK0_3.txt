[1] "The goal of these calculations is to document several aspects of the chemistry of oxides doped substitutionally with dopants whose valence is lower by one than the valence of the cation they substitute (LVD1)."
[2] "First, we extrapolate numerous computations (by us and by others) and propose that all LVD1 dopants substantially activate the oxygen atoms at the surface of any doped oxide."
[3] "To probe the change in oxygen activity caused by the dopant, we used the energy ΔEv of making an oxygen vacancy, the energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 to bind a H atom or a CH3 radical to an oxygen atom in the surface layer, and the energy ΔECH4 of the dissociative adsorption of methane to form a hydroxyl and a methoxide."
[4] "Second, we extrapolate the present calculations to postulate that the adsorption of an electron donor (H or CH3, in the examples given here) on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD1 counteracts the effect of the dopant. We call this a chemical compensation effect."
[5] "The reason for this chemical compensation effect can be understood as follows: having a lower valence than the cation it substitutes, an LVD creates a deficit of electrons in the surface. The oxygen atoms, which are very electrophilic, no longer bind as strongly to the doped surface and are therefore more inclined to react with adsorbates. Adsorbing an electron donor on the doped oxide heals (in full or in part) the electron deficit, increasing the strength of the oxygen bond to the oxide and making it less reactive."
[6] "We conclude this section by discussing the implications that our findings have for catalysis by oxides doped with LVD1s. The compensation effect proposed here introduces interesting complications in those reactions, catalyzed by an oxide doped with an LVD1, that involve the formation of electron-donating adsorbates (e.g., hydroxyls or organic radicals)."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The chemistry of the surface oxygen atoms is activated by dopants with a valence lower by one than the substituted cation (LVD1), making it easier to remove oxygen atoms and bind hydrogen and methyl radicals more strongly. This leads to enhanced reactivity. The presence of electron donors on the surface, such as hydrogen or methyl radicals, can compensate for the effect of the dopant, reducing the activity of the surface. This introduces complexities in catalytic reactions involving electron-donating adsorbates, potentially affecting the balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和表面氧空位的形成可以显著影响其在乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯等氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能。表面氧原子的化学性质通过具有比取代阳离子低一个价态的掺杂剂（LVD1）得到激活，使得从表面移除氧原子和吸附氢原子或甲基自由基更加容易，从而增强活性。表面存在的电子供体，如氢原子或甲基自由基，可以补偿掺杂剂的影响，降低表面活性，这在涉及电子供体吸附剂的催化反应中引入了复杂性，可能影响这些催化系统的效率、选择性和安全性之间的平衡。
