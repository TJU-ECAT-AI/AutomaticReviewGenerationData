[1] "The goal of these calculations is to document several aspects of the chemistry of oxides doped substitutionally with dopants whose valence is lower by one than the valence of the cation they substitute (LVD1)."
[2] "First, we extrapolate numerous computations (by us and by others) and propose that all LVD1 dopants substantially activate the oxygen atoms at the surface of any doped oxide."
[3] "Second, we extrapolate the present calculations to postulate that the adsorption of an electron donor (H or CH3, in the examples given here) on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD1 counteracts the effect of the dopant."
[4] "The reason for this chemical compensation effect can be understood as follows: having a lower valence than the cation it substitutes, an LVD creates a deficit of electrons in the surface."
[5] "The oxygen atoms, which are very electrophilic, no longer bind as strongly to the doped surface and are therefore more inclined to react with adsorbates."
[6] "Adsorbing an electron donor on the doped oxide heals (in full or in part) the electron deficit, increasing the strength of the oxygen bond to the oxide and making it less reactive."
[7] "This crude picture is reinforced by the analysis of the partial density of states for all the systems studied here."
[8] "The presence of an LVD on the surface produces a partially filled orbital in the valence band and the adsorption of a compensating electron donor fills this orbital, making the density of states of the compensated surface very similar to that of the undoped oxide."
[9] "In the case of LaCeO2 the molecular orbital in question is delocalized and consists mainly of oxygen atomic orbitals."
[10] "This is why doping with La equally affects the reactivity of all oxygen atoms in the supercell used for calculations."
[11] "We are tempted to think that all LVDs have the ability to induce long-range modifications in the chemistry of the oxygen atoms on the surface, but we have not performed calculations that would back up this guess."
[12] "We conclude this section by discussing the implications that our findings have for catalysis by oxides doped with LVD1s."
[13] "The compensation effect proposed here introduces interesting complications in those reactions, catalyzed by an oxide doped with an LVD1, that involve the formation of electron-donating adsorbates (e.g., hydroxyls or organic radicals)."
[14] "Consider, for example, the activation of methane by an oxide catalyst doped with an LVD1."
[15] "The presence of the LVD1 substantially increases the energy gained by the dissociative adsorption of methane."
[16] "Assuming that the EvansPolanyi rules work for this case, this will lower the activation energy for breaking the CH bond and oxides doped with LVD1 should be better catalysts for methane activation than the undoped oxides."
[17] "However, the dissociation produces H and CH3 bonded to the oxygen atoms of the surface, which act as compensating agents."
[18] "If these two species are not removed promptly from the surface, their presence substantially lower the activity of the surface (by the chemical compensation effect) and they poison the catalyst."
[19] "We may have a situation where the rate-limiting step is not the breaking of the CH bond but the removal of H and CH3 from the surface."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions in several ways. Firstly, doping with low-valence dopants (LVD1) activates the oxygen atoms at the surface of the doped oxide, making them more reactive towards reactants like methane. This activation is due to the creation of an electron deficit by the LVD, which weakens the oxygen bonds and makes the surface more susceptible to adsorbates. Secondly, the adsorption of electron donors (like H or CH3) on the doped oxide surface counteracts the effect of the dopant, healing the electron deficit and making the surface less reactive. This phenomenon is called the chemical compensation effect. In the context of methane activation, the presence of the LVD increases the energy required for dissociative adsorption, potentially lowering the activation energy for breaking the CH bond. However, the resulting H and CH3 species can act as compensating agents, reducing the activity of the surface if not removed promptly. This can lead to a situation where the rate-limiting step is not the initial bond-breaking but rather the removal of the compensating species.

The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include accurately predicting the effects of different dopants and preparation conditions on the electronic structure and reactivity of the catalyst. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of the chemical compensation effect and its impact on the catalytic performance is crucial. Balancing the need for high reactivity with the risk of poisoning by compensating species requires careful control of the dopant concentration and the development of strategies to efficiently remove these species from the surface. Ensuring safety involves managing the potential hazards associated with the reactive intermediates formed during the catalytic processes.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成影响其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯）的催化性能。首先，通过低价掺杂剂（LVD1）对掺杂氧化物表面的氧原子激活，使得它们更易于与反应物如甲烷反应。这种激活是由于掺杂剂在表面创建电子缺陷，削弱氧键并使表面更容易吸附物种。其次，表面吸附电子供体（如H或CH3）能够抵消掺杂剂的作用，修复电子缺陷并使表面活性降低。这种现象称为化学补偿效应。在甲烷激活的背景下，掺杂剂的存在可以提高脱附吸附的能量要求，可能降低断裂CH键的活化能。然而，产生的H和CH3物种可以作为补偿剂，如果不能及时从表面上移除，会显著降低表面活性。这可能导致初始键断裂步骤不是决定性的，而是去除补偿物种的过程。

在理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战包括准确预测不同掺杂剂和制备条件对催化剂电子结构和活性的影响。此外，理解化学补偿效应及其对催化性能的影响至关重要。平衡高活性与潜在中毒风险之间的关系需要精确控制掺杂剂浓度，并开发有效去除这些物种至表面的方法。确保安全性涉及管理反应中间体在催化过程中可能带来的风险。
