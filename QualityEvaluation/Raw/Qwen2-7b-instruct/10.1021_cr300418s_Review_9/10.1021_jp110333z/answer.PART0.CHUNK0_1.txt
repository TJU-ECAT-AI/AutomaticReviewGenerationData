[1] "The goal of these calculations is to document several aspects of the chemistry of oxides doped substitutionally with dopants whose valence is lower by one than the valence of the cation they substitute (LVD1)."
[2] "First, we extrapolate numerous computations (by us and by others) and propose that all LVD1 dopants substantially activate the oxygen atoms at the surface of any doped oxide."
[3] "Second, we extrapolate the present calculations to postulate that the adsorption of an electron donor (H or CH3, in the examples given here) on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD1 counteracts the effect of the dopant."
[4] "The reason for this chemical compensation effect can be understood as follows: having a lower valence than the cation it substitutes, an LVD creates a deficit of electrons in the surface."
[5] "This is why doping with La equally affects the reactivity of all oxygen atoms in the supercell used for calculations."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The electronic structure alteration due to doping can enhance the reactivity of the catalysts towards the reactants. The formation of vacancies can further modulate the electronic properties, affecting the reaction pathways and rates. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure changes, understanding the role of dopants and vacancies, and optimizing the balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety. Theoretical models often struggle with capturing the complex interplay between electronic effects, structural changes, and catalytic activity. Process optimization requires detailed knowledge of the reaction mechanisms, which can be difficult to obtain experimentally. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety necessitates a deep understanding of the fundamental science underlying the catalytic processes, as well as careful consideration of practical constraints and operational conditions.
