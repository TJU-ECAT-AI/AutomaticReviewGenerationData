[1] "We have found that this procedure may fail dramatically for adsorption on oxides. For example, the presence of a charge-donating species on a TiO2(110) surface changes very substantially the adsorption energy of a Au atom or an O2 molecule."

[4] "The compensation effect is present when we adsorb H on CuLa2O3, and it is easy to see that the values of the energies of the probe reactions on the compensated CuLa2O3 surface fall between those of H/NaLa2O3 and H/MgLa2O3."

The presence of a charge-donating species significantly alters the adsorption energy of Au atoms or O2 molecules on a TiO2(110) surface. The compensation effect affects the coadsorption of molecules, leading to a similar behavior as observed in the adsorption of other molecules. The energy of dissociative adsorption of methane depends on the type of dopant in the oxide. For example, the energy of CH4 dissociation is 0.34 eV for MgLa2O3, 1.96 eV for CuLa2O3, and 3.70 eV for NaLa2O3. When H is adsorbed on CuLa2O3, the compensation effect is present, resulting in probe reaction energies falling between those of H/NaLa2O3 and H/MgLa2O3. All systems analyzed exhibit similar behavior regarding the compensation effect and the interaction between adsorbates.

在TiO2(110)表面，带电捐赠物种的存在显著改变了Au原子或O2分子的吸附能。补偿效应影响了分子的共吸附行为，导致类似其他分子观察到的行为。甲烷解离吸附的能量取决于氧化物中的掺杂剂类型。例如，MgLa2O3的CH4解离能为0.34 eV，CuLa2O3为1.96 eV，而NaLa2O3为3.70 eV。当在CuLa2O3上吸附H时，补偿效应存在，导致探针反应能量介于H/NaLa2O3和H/MgLa2O3之间。所有分析的系统都表现出相似的补偿效应和吸附物种之间的相互作用行为。
