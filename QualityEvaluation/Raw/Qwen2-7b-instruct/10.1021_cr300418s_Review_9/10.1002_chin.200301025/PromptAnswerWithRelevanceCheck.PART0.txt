[1] "The new phase Te0.33(Mo,V)O3.33 is obtained by evaporation of an aqueous slurry comprising (NH4)6Mo7O24, Te(OH)6, and VOSO4, followed by calcination at 600 C for 2 h in N2."
[2] "The samples are characterized by powder XRD, SAED, HREM, and UV/VIS spectroscopy."
[3] "However, HREM reveals the crystals as being formed by structural domains of an orthorhombically distorted unit cell derived from the K0.130.33WO3 structure."
[4] "The results constitute the first step for elucidating the role of this new orthorhombic phase in the effectiveness of MoVTeNb mixed oxide catalysts."

The new phase Te0.33(Mo,V)O3.33 was synthesized through the evaporation of a specific aqueous slurry followed by calcination at 600°C under nitrogen. The crystal structure is characterized by XRD, SAED, HREM, and UV/VIS spectroscopy. The HREM analysis indicates that the crystals are composed of structural domains derived from the K0.130.33WO3 structure, which has been orthorhombically distorted. This study is the initial step in understanding the role of this orthorhombic phase in the performance of MoVTeNb mixed oxide catalysts.

The new phase Te0.33(Mo,V)O3.33 is synthesized through the evaporation of an aqueous slurry containing specific molybdate, tellurate, and vanadate compounds, followed by calcination at 600°C under nitrogen. The material's structure is analyzed using powder XRD, SAED, HREM, and UV/VIS spectroscopy. The XRD pattern is indexed based on a hexagonal cell structure, but high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) shows that the crystals consist of structural domains originating from an orthorhombically distorted unit cell similar to K0.130.33WO3.
