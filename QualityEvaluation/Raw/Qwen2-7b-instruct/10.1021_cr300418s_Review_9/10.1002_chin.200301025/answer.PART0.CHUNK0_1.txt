The new phase Te0.33(Mo,V)O3.33 is synthesized through the evaporation of an aqueous slurry containing specific molybdate, tellurate, and vanadate compounds, followed by calcination at 600°C under nitrogen. The material's structure is analyzed using powder XRD, SAED, HREM, and UV/VIS spectroscopy. The XRD pattern is indexed based on a hexagonal cell structure, but high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) shows that the crystals consist of structural domains originating from an orthorhombically distorted unit cell similar to K0.130.33WO3.

新相Te0.33(Mo,V)O3.33通过蒸发包含特定钼酸盐、亚砷酸盐和硫酸钒的水溶液合成，并在氮气中于600°C下进行煅烧。该材料的结构通过粉末X射线衍射（XRD）、扫描透射电子显微镜（SAED）、高分辨率电子显微镜（HREM）和紫外/可见光谱分析进行表征。XRD图谱基于六方晶系进行索引，然而，高分辨率电子显微镜显示晶体由源自K0.130.33WO3结构的正交畸变单元格中的结构域组成。
