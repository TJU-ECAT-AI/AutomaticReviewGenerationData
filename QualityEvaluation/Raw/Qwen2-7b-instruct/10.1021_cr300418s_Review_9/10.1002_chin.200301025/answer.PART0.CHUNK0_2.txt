The new phase Te0.33(Mo,V)O3.33 is synthesized through a specific process involving the evaporation of an aqueous slurry containing (NH4)6Mo7O24, Te(OH)6, and VOSO4, followed by calcination at 600°C under nitrogen for two hours. The characterization techniques used for the samples include powder XRD, SAED, HREM, and UV/VIS spectroscopy. The XRD pattern is indexed based on a hexagonal cell, while the HREM analysis indicates that the crystals are composed of structural domains originating from an orthorhombically distorted unit cell derived from the K0.130.33WO3 structure.

新相 Te0.33(Mo,V)O3.33 是通过特定过程合成的，包括将含 (NH4)6Mo7O24、Te(OH)6 和 VOSO4 的水溶液蒸发，然后在氮气中于600°C下煅烧两小时。用于样品表征的技术包括粉末XRD、SAED、HREM和UV/VIS光谱法。XRD模式根据六方晶系进行索引，而HREM分析表明晶体由来自K0.130.33WO3结构的正交畸变单胞域组成。
