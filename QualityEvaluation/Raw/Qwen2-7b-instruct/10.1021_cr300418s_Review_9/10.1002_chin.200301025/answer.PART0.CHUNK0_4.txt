The new crystalline phase, Te0.33(Mo,V)O3.33, is synthesized through a specific process involving the evaporation of an aqueous slurry containing (NH4)6Mo7O24, Te(OH)6, and VOSO4, followed by calcination at 600°C under nitrogen for 2 hours. This phase is characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning transmission electron microscopy (SAED), high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM), and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV/VIS). The XRD pattern is indexed based on a hexagonal cell, but HREM indicates that the crystals are composed of structural domains derived from an orthorhombically distorted unit cell, similar to the K0.130.33WO3 structure.

新结晶相Te0.33(Mo,V)O3.33通过将含(NH4)6Mo7O24、Te(OH)6和VOSO4的水溶液蒸发，然后在氮气中于600°C下煅烧2小时的方法合成。该相通过粉末X射线衍射(XRD)、扫描透射电子显微镜(SAED)、高分辨电子显微镜(HREM)和紫外可见光谱(UV/VIS)进行表征。XRD模式基于六角晶系进行索引，但HREM显示晶体由K0.130.33WO3结构衍生的正交畸变单胞结构域组成。
