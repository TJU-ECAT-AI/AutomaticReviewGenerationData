[1] "The new phase Te0.33(Mo,V)O3.33 is obtained by evaporation of an aqueous slurry comprising (NH4)6Mo7O24, Te(OH)6, and VOSO4, followed by calcination at 600 C for 2 h in N2."
[2] "The samples are characterized by powder XRD, SAED, HREM, and UV/VIS spectroscopy."
[3] "However, HREM reveals the crystals as being formed by structural domains of an orthorhombically distorted unit cell derived from the K0.130.33WO3 structure."
[4] "The results constitute the first step for elucidating the role of this new orthorhombic phase in the effectiveness of MoVTeNb mixed oxide catalysts."

The new phase Te0.33(Mo,V)O3.33 was synthesized through the evaporation of a specific aqueous slurry followed by calcination at 600°C under nitrogen. The crystal structure is characterized by XRD, SAED, HREM, and UV/VIS spectroscopy. The HREM analysis indicates that the crystals are composed of structural domains derived from the K0.130.33WO3 structure, which has been orthorhombically distorted. This study is the initial step in understanding the role of this orthorhombic phase in the performance of MoVTeNb mixed oxide catalysts.

新相 Te0.33(Mo,V)O3.33 通过蒸发特定的水溶液并随后在氮气中于600°C下煅烧制备。晶体结构通过粉末X射线衍射（XRD）、扫描透射电子衍射（SAED）、高分辨电子显微镜（HREM）和紫外/可见光谱（UV/VIS）进行表征。HREM分析表明，晶体由源于K0.130.33WO3结构的结构域组成，该结构已发生正交畸变。这项研究是理解这种正交相在MoVTeNb混合氧化物催化剂性能中的作用的第一步。
