The new phase Te0.33(Mo,V)O3.33 is synthesized through the evaporation of an aqueous slurry containing (NH4)6Mo7O24, Te(OH)6, and VOSO4, followed by calcination at 600°C for 2 hours in nitrogen. This phase is characterized using powder XRD, SAED, HREM, and UV/VIS spectroscopy. The HREM analysis indicates that the crystals are composed of structural domains originating from an orthorhombically distorted unit cell derived from the K0.130.33WO3 structure. These findings represent the initial step towards understanding the role of this new orthorhombic phase in the efficacy of MoVTeNb mixed oxide catalysts.

新相Te0.33(Mo,V)O3.33通过蒸发包含(NH4)6Mo7O24、Te(OH)6和VOSO4的水溶液制备，并在氮气中于600°C下煅烧2小时。使用粉末X射线衍射（XRD）、扫描透射电子显微镜（SAED）、高分辨透射电子显微镜（HREM）和紫外/可见光谱（UV/VIS）对样品进行表征。HREM分析表明，晶体由来自K0.130.33WO3结构的正交畸变单胞单元域组成。这些结果是阐明此新正交相在MoVTeNb混合氧化物催化剂效能中的作用的第一步。
