[1] "In this work, dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts has been investigated and compared."
[2] "As the Ga2O3 content is increased, the conversion of EB on GZ catalysts first increases and then decreases."
[3] "The activity of the ZrO2 catalyst is enhanced markedly after the incorporation of gallium oxide."
[4] "The propene yield rises slightly due to the decline in propene selectivity."
[5] "The different catalytic behavior of GZ catalysts in EB dehydrogenation and propane dehydrogenation with varying the Ga2O3 content could be related to the fact that the former reaction is easier to proceed than the latter one."

1. The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane was studied over Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts.
2. As the concentration of Ga2O3 increases, the conversion of ethylbenzene initially rises before decreasing.
3. Incorporating gallium oxide significantly enhances the activity of the ZrO2 catalyst.
4. The yield of propene increases slightly despite a decrease in its selectivity.
5. The distinct catalytic behaviors of Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts in ethylbenzene and propane dehydrogenation might stem from the relative ease of the former reaction.

1. 对Ga2O3ZrO2催化剂进行了乙苯和丙烷的脱氢反应研究。
2. 随着Ga2O3含量的增加，乙苯的转化率首先上升然后下降。
3. 添加镓氧化物显著提高了ZrO2催化剂的活性。
4. 虽然丙烯的选择性下降，但其产率略有增加。
5. Ga2O3ZrO2催化剂在乙苯和丙烷脱氢反应中的不同催化行为可能与前者反应更容易进行有关。
