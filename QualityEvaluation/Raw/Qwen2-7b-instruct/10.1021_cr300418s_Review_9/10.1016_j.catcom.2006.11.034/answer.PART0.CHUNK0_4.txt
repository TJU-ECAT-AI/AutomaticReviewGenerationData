Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts in the presence of CO2 Huiyun Li a,c, Yinghong Yue a, Changxi Miao b, Zaiku Xie b, Weiming Hua a,*, Zi Gao a

Propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein and acrylic acid.
The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene is of increasing significance due to the growing demand for propene. Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propene. However, the high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, resulting in a decline in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation.

Recently, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been reported to give rather high propene selectivity [2,11]. Since CO2 is one of the major greenhouse gases, the use of CO2 is attractive not only economically but also ecologically. Propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 has been studied over various catalysts, such as Cr2O3 [12,13], rare earth vanadates [14] and Ga2O3 [1517].

It is interesting to compare dehydrogenation of EB and propane in the presence of CO2. In this work, dehydroge- nation of ethylbenzene and propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 cat- alysts has been investigated and compared.
