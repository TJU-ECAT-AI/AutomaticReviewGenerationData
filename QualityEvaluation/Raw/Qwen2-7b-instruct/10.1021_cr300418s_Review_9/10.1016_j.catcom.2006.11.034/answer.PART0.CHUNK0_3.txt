[1] "The catalysts were characterized by XRD, Raman, DRS, XPS, SEM, EDX, IR, NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD and N2 adsorption methods."
[2] "The catalysts deactivate more seriously in propane dehydrogenation than in EB dehydrogenation."
[3] "The different catalytic behavior of GZ catalysts in EB dehydrogenation and propane dehydrogenation with varying the Ga2O3 content could be related to the fact that the former reaction is easier to proceed than the latter one."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and propane to propene. Specifically, the incorporation of Ga2O3 into ZrO2 retards the transformation from the metastable tetragonal phase to the monoclinic phase, affecting the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The correlation between the catalytic activity of the Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation and the presence of acid-base sites on the catalyst surface suggests that both types of sites are necessary for the reaction. However, the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 is less efficient than that of ethylbenzene, likely due to the more severe catalyst deactivation in propane dehydrogenation. This difference in behavior can be attributed to the ease of the dehydrogenation reaction for ethylbenzene compared to propane.

在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和丙烷转化为丙烯）中，镓氧化锆催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成会影响它们的电子结构和催化性能。具体来说，将镓氧化物引入氧化锆会减缓从亚稳四方相向单斜相的转变，这影响了催化剂的活性和选择性。镓氧化锆催化剂的活性与催化剂表面酸碱位点的存在之间的相关性表明，两种类型的位点对于反应都是必要的。然而，在二氧化碳存在的条件下，丙烷脱氢的效率低于乙苯脱氢，这可能是由于丙烷脱氢过程中催化剂降解更为严重。这种行为差异可以归因于乙苯脱氢反应比丙烷更容易进行。
