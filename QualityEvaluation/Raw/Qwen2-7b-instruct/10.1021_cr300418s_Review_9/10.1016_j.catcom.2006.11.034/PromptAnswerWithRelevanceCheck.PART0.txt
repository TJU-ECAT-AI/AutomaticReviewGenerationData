Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts in the presence of CO2 Huiyun Li a,c, Yinghong Yue a, Changxi Miao b, Zaiku Xie b, Weiming Hua a,*, Zi Gao a

Propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein and acrylic acid.
The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene is of increasing significance due to the growing demand for propene. Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propene. However, the high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, resulting in a decline in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation.

In this work, dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts has been investigated and compared. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UVVis DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectros-opy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), temperature programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2 (NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD) and N2 adsorption methods. The catalytic activities are correlated with the results of surface acidity and basicity measurements.

The dehydrogenation of EB was carried out in the presence of CO2 at 873 K. Styrene is the major product of the reaction, whereas benzene and toluene are minor by-products. The catalysts deactivate rather fast in the first 1 h, followed by a relatively slow decrease in activity. Meanwhile, the selectivity to propene increases progressively with time on stream. Comparison between two dehydrogenation reactions shows that the catalysts deactivate more seriously in propane dehydrogenation than in EB dehydrogenation.

The activity of the ZrO2 catalyst is enhanced markedly after the incorporation of gallium oxide, whereas the selectivity to styrene declines to some extent. The activity of GZ catalysts is ca. 2 times as high as that of ZrO2. As the Ga2O3 content is increased, the conversion of EB on GZ catalysts first increases and then decreases. A maximum of 36.9 conversion appears at a Ga2O3 content of 15%. The selectivity to styrene at the maximum conversion is 93.0%. The same variation trend was observed for the yield of styrene, since the selectivity to styrene is similar.

The dehydrogenation of propane was performed in the presence of CO2 at 873 K. The major product formed in the reaction is propene, and the major by-products are methane, ethane, and ethylene. The catalysts deactivate rather fast in the first 1 h, followed by a relatively slow decrease in activity. The propene yield rises slightly due to the decline in propene selectivity. The different catalytic behavior of GZ catalysts in EB dehydrogenation and propane dehydrogenation with varying the Ga2O3 content could be related to the fact that the former reaction is easier to proceed than the latter one.

1. The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene requires high temperatures, which can lead to thermal cracking reactions, reducing product yields and catalyst stability.
2. The incorporation of gallium oxide into zirconia enhances the activity of the catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in the presence of CO2.
3. The activity of gallium-zirconia oxide catalysts is significantly higher compared to pure zirconia catalysts.
4. The conversion of ethylbenzene increases initially and then decreases with increasing gallium oxide content.
5. The maximum conversion of ethylbenzene occurs at a gallium oxide content of 15%.
6. The selectivity towards styrene increases with the maximum conversion of ethylbenzene.
7. The propane conversion increases with increasing gallium oxide content, indicating that gallium oxide is the major active component for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.
8. The selectivity towards propene is lower than that towards styrene during the dehydrogenation of propane, indicating a higher risk of side reactions.
9. The catalysts deactivate more rapidly in propane dehydrogenation compared to ethylbenzene dehydrogenation.
10. The role of CO2 in the reaction is to promote the dehydrogenation through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and potentially aid in the elimination of coke through the Boudouard reaction.

The XPS spectra for the 15GZ catalyst show two peaks at 24.2 and 21.3 eV, corresponding to the O(2s) and Ga3+(3d) bands respectively. The Ga 3d banding energy of pure b-Ga2O3 is 20.8 eV, and the shift in binding energy by 0.5 eV can be attributed to a strong interaction between the Ga2O3 species and ZrO2.

Table 2 summarizes the CO2-TPD data of the GZ catalysts. As the Ga2O3 content is increased, the number of total base sites present on GZ catalysts first increases and then decreases. A maximum value appears at a Ga2O3 content of 15%. The basicity of ZrO2 is enhanced after the addition of appropriate amount of Ga2O3 into ZrO2. There is a much smaller number of base sites than acid sites on GZ catalysts, suggesting that Ga2O3ZrO2 mixed oxides are primarily acid catalysts.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and propane to propene. Specifically, the incorporation of Ga2O3 into ZrO2 retards the transformation from the metastable tetragonal phase to the monoclinic phase, affecting the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The correlation between the catalytic activity of the Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation and the presence of acid-base sites on the catalyst surface suggests that both types of sites are necessary for the reaction. However, the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 is less efficient than that of ethylbenzene, likely due to the more severe catalyst deactivation in propane dehydrogenation. This difference in behavior can be attributed to the ease of the dehydrogenation reaction for ethylbenzene compared to propane.

Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts in the presence of CO2 Huiyun Li a,c, Yinghong Yue a, Changxi Miao b, Zaiku Xie b, Weiming Hua a,*, Zi Gao a

Propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein and acrylic acid.
The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene is of increasing significance due to the growing demand for propene. Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propene. However, the high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, resulting in a decline in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation.

Recently, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been reported to give rather high propene selectivity [2,11]. Since CO2 is one of the major greenhouse gases, the use of CO2 is attractive not only economically but also ecologically. Propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 has been studied over various catalysts, such as Cr2O3 [12,13], rare earth vanadates [14] and Ga2O3 [1517].

It is interesting to compare dehydrogenation of EB and propane in the presence of CO2. In this work, dehydroge- nation of ethylbenzene and propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 cat- alysts has been investigated and compared.
