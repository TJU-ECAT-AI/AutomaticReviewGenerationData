1. Extensive research has led to a reasonable understanding of the basic reactions involved in the oxidative coupling of methane. However, a fully developed technological process for this conversion has not been established yet.

2. The objective of the technical research is to create a process that can efficiently convert methane into ethylene with high selectivity, while maintaining a moderate level of methane conversion in a single pass through the catalyst.

3. The complexity of catalysts used in oxidative coupling reactions implies that there isn't a single type of active center responsible for activating methane. Various catalysts exhibit different properties and mechanisms.

4. The [Li'O-] centers have been observed not only in Li/MgO catalysts but also in Li/ZnO catalysts. Similarly, [Na+O-] centers have been identified in Na/CaO catalysts.

5. The chlorided Li/MgO catalyst demonstrates unique characteristics, especially when the Cl/Li ratio reaches 20.9. At this specific ratio, the catalyst exhibits distinct performance and properties compared to other catalysts.

1. 对于甲烷的氧化耦合反应，尽管已经进行了广泛的科研工作，但至今还没有形成一种成熟的工业技术。科研成果已经对反应的基本原理有了合理的认识。

2. 技术研究的目标是开发出一个过程，在单次催化剂通过的情况下，既能实现较高的乙烯选择性，又能保持适度的甲烷转化率。

3. 在氧化耦合反应中使用的催化剂种类繁多，表明不存在单一的活性中心能够负责激活甲烷。不同的催化剂表现出不同的性能和机制。

4. 不仅在Li/MgO催化剂中观察到了[Li'O-]中心，而且在Li/ZnO催化剂中也发现了它们的存在。同样地，在Na/CaO催化剂中也发现了[Na+O-]中心。

5. 当Cl/Li比例达到20.9时，氯化锂/镁氧化物催化剂表现出独特的特性。在这一特定比例下，催化剂的性能和性质与其它催化剂有所不同。
