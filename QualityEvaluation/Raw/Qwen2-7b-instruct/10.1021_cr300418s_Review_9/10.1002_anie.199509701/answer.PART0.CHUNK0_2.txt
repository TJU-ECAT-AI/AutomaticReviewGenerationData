The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by altering their basicity. This impacts the efficiency and selectivity of reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic properties and reactivity patterns under operational conditions. Process optimization faces difficulties in achieving a balance between high efficiency, selectivity, and safety, especially in handling potentially hazardous gases like CO and CO2. Balancing these factors requires sophisticated computational methods and experimental validation to ensure robust and reliable catalytic systems.
