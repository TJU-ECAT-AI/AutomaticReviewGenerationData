[1] "Many of the same catalysts are effective, and the cross-coupling reaction also appears to involve surfacegenerated radicals."
[2] "The better catalysts are capable of promoting high C,, selectivities in the absence of a diluent."
[3] "Moreover, they are free of reducible surface cations."
[4] "Still another factor in evaluating a catalyst is the need of a diluent. The conversion and selectivity generally increases as the partial pressure of the reagents decreases, but the separation of C,H, from a large excess of a diluent gas is undesirable."
[5] "We have confirmed the excellent behavior of the Mn(2 wt %)/Na,WO,(S wt %)/SiO, catalyst and have found that at a CH,:O, ratio of 8:l without diluent and at 800 "C, the C, + selectivity was 81 YO at 20 YO"
[6] "Moreover, the larger sticking coefficients are found with oxides that have multiple oxidation states, making them accessible to reduction by CH;radicals."
[7] "For example, the Mn(2 wt %)/Na,WO,(S wt %)/SiO, catalyst does not react with CO, at elevated temperatures,which usually is taken as measure of strong basicity."
[8] "Clearly, the values of R are significantly greater than 1 .  Even at 650C over Li/MgO a value of R = 3.4 was obtained."
[9] "In poisoning the centers responsible for CH, activation, CO, has a profound effect on the kinetics of the coupling reaction."
[10] "The use of XPS to detect peroxide ions suffers from the fact that it is an ex situ method. By contrast, with Raman spectroscopy results can be obtained in the presence of the reagents and the catalyst at temperatures up to 800 'C."

1.Most of the catalysts are effective for cross-coupling reactions, involving surface-generated radicals.
2.High C, selectivities can be achieved without using a diluent.
3.Most catalysts lack reducible surface cations.
4.Conversion and selectivity typically increase with lower reagent partial pressures, but separating the product from a diluent is undesirable.
5.At a CH,:O, ratio of 8:l, the C, + selectivity reaches 81% at 800°C using the Mn(2 wt %)/Na,WO,(S wt %)/SiO, catalyst without a diluent.
6.Oxides with multiple oxidation states are more accessible to reduction by CH; radicals, resulting in higher sticking coefficients.
7.The Mn(2 wt %)/Na,WO,(S wt %)/SiO, catalyst does not react with CO, at elevated temperatures, indicating strong basicity.
8.Values of R, representing the ratio of COX product concentration to feedstock concentration, are significantly greater than 1 across various catalysts and temperatures.
9.CO, poisoning affects the kinetics of the coupling reaction by altering the activation of CH,.
10.Raman spectroscopy allows for in situ detection of peroxide ions, unlike XPS which requires an ex situ method.
