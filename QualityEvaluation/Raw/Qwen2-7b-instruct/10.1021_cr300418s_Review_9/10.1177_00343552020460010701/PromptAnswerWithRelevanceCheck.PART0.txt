<quotes>
[1] "Judy Heumanns first job application rejection, by the New York City Board of Education because she used a wheelchair, generated a New York Times editorial and an interview on the national news that were exclusively about her situation."
[2] "Upon retiring from Congress, Tony Coelho switched careers to the corporate sector. His boss, grateful to have snatched this enterprising former House Majority Whip, offered him a $100,000 annual bonus for reading the Wall Street Journal each day in toto, as part of a crash course in finance (p. 146)."
[3] "After publishing a New York Times op-ed piece that sharply criticized the fundraising strategy based on patronizing pity that the Jerry Lewis telethon employed, Evan Kemp found out that the beneficiary of that telethon, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, paid a private investigator about a quarter of a million dollars to surreptitiously discredit his reputation."
[4] "Despite early-onset deafness and not making a phone call until he was 25 years old, Frank Bowe was largely responsible for the proposal and passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990 that mandate telephone and television equipment and services be accessible to everyone."
[5] "For decades, Justin Dart and his wife, Yoshiko, have conducted their own version of foster parenting (life-quality training) in their home for more than 80 individuals with significant disabilities, to provide them with the skills and supports to start working and living independently."
[6] "With all his high-brow experiences to reminisce aboutstarring in a Hollywood film for which he received two Academy Awards and directing the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities under nine consecutive presidents, a retired septuagenarian, Harold Russell, chose to work as a program consultant and peer counselor for a radical, grassroots service program for homeless veterans."

The lives of Judy Heumann, Tony Coelho, Evan Kemp, Frank Bowe, Justin Dart, and Harold Russell, detailed in the book "Enabling Lives," showcase their remarkable achievements and contributions. Judy Heumann faced discrimination when applying for a job due to her wheelchair usage, which led to national attention. Tony Coelho, after retiring from Congress, was offered a $100,000 annual bonus for reading the Wall Street Journal daily as part of a finance crash course. Evan Kemp criticized the fundraising strategy of the Jerry Lewis telethon, which resulted in the Muscular Dystrophy Association hiring a private investigator to discredit him. Frank Bowe, despite his deafness, played a significant role in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990, advocating for accessibility in telecommunications. Justin Dart and his wife provided life-quality training for over 80 individuals with significant disabilities, helping them gain skills and independence. Harold Russell, after a successful career in Hollywood and directing the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities, chose to work as a program consultant and peer counselor for a service program aimed at homeless veterans.

These individuals' stories highlight the importance of resilience, advocacy, and perseverance in overcoming challenges and achieving success. Their experiences serve as inspiring examples for others facing similar obstacles, emphasizing the value of self-actualization and the potential for positive impact in various fields.

[1] "Perhaps the most mentioned specific topic in the main part of the text is the Americans with Disabilities Act, mostly in the form of anecdotes about the politics of crafting and passing this legislation."

[2] "Some of the crucial experiences recounted by the activists centered on encounters with children whom they did not know that turned the direction of their lives at a critical point."
[3] "In contrast to these positively stirring experiences with younger strangers, I noted that the parental recollections in four of the biographies were either absent (Russells father died when he was a toddler) or were marred by harsh discipline and rejection."
[4] "A common aspect of all the interviewees backgrounds was a keen interest or involvement in the civil rights struggle for racial equality, although in most cases they had not yet recognized equivalent injustices toward people with disabilities."
[5] "Recurring themes of spirituality and conscientious living characterize Darts life in particular. Part of his personal search for truth was rejecting, for much of his life, the extreme competitiveness and wealth of his business baron family."
[6] "The one about Judy Heumann has the most fictional flair to it, and the one about Justin Dart is the most straightforward and documentary in style."
[7] "Although the text is generally well written and edited, there are some unfortunate errors. Ralf Hotch- kiss, who is briefly mentioned only once, is listed (p. 51) as Ralph Hodgkins, a seemingly minuscule mistake that still could lead a student who is doing a Web-based or bibliographic name search to a dead end rather than to the available information about this trail-blazing rehabilitation engineer and disability change agent."
[8] "Speaking of personal life details, I found that there were, periodically, more tidbits given about a subject (in particular, romantic pursuits and failures, and sometimes even those of the children) than I thought were useful to mention. Such information seems beyond the meaningful parameters, maybe not of a whole book on the persons life, but certainly of a chapter targeted to his or her role in rehabilitation and disability circles."

The review highlights several aspects of the book "Enabling Lives". The most mentioned topic is the Americans with Disabilities Act, often discussed through anecdotes about the political process of creating and implementing the legislation. The book recounts how interactions with children significantly influenced the lives of some of its subjects. However, parental memories in four of the biographies were either missing or negatively impacted by strict discipline. The review notes a shared interest among the interviewees in civil rights for racial equality, though they hadn't yet acknowledged similar injustices towards people with disabilities. Justin Dart's biography stands out for its straightforward and documentary style, while Judy Heumann's has a more fictional tone. The reviewer also points out errors in the text, such as misidentifying a rehabilitation engineer named Ralf Hotch- kiss as Ralph Hodgkins, and the inclusion of unnecessary personal details about the subjects' romantic lives and children, which seem out of place in a chapter focused on their roles in rehabilitation and disability circles.

该评论强调了《赋能生活》这本书中的几个方面。提及最多的主题是《美国残疾人法案》，通常通过关于立法过程的政治故事来讨论。书中讲述了与儿童互动如何显著影响了一些受访者的生。然而，四篇传记中父母的记忆要么缺失，要么被严格的纪律所玷污。评论指出受访者对种族平等民权运动有共同的兴趣，尽管他们还没有认识到残疾人所遭受的类似不公。Justin Dart的传记以其直接和纪实的风格脱颖而出，而Judy Heumann的传记则带有更多的虚构色彩。评论还指出了文本中的错误，如将一名康复工程师Ralf Hotch- kiss误认为Ralph Hodgkins，并且包括了关于受访者浪漫生活和子女的无关细节，这似乎超出了以他们在康复和残疾圈子里的角色为焦点的章节的意义范围。
