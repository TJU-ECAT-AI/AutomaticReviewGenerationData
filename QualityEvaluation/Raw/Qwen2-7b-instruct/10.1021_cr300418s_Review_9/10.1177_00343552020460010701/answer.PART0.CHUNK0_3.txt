[1] "Perhaps the most mentioned specific topic in the main part of the text is the Americans with Disabilities Act, mostly in the form of anecdotes about the politics of crafting and passing this legislation."
[2] "Some of the crucial experiences recounted by the activists centered on encounters with children whom they did not know that turned the direction of their lives at a critical point."
[3] "In contrast to these positively stirring experiences with younger strangers, I noted that the parental recollections in four of the biographies were either absent (Russells father died when he was a toddler) or were marred by harsh discipline and rejection."
[4] "A common aspect of all the interviewees backgrounds was a keen interest or involvement in the civil rights struggle for racial equality, although in most cases they had not yet recognized equivalent injustices toward people with disabilities."
[5] "Recurring themes of spirituality and conscientious living characterize Darts life in particular. Part of his personal search for truth was rejecting, for much of his life, the extreme competitiveness and wealth of his business baron family."
[6] "The one about Judy Heumann has the most fictional flair to it, and the one about Justin Dart is the most straightforward and documentary in style."
[7] "Although the text is generally well written and edited, there are some unfortunate errors. Ralf Hotch- kiss, who is briefly mentioned only once, is listed (p. 51) as Ralph Hodgkins, a seemingly minuscule mistake that still could lead a student who is doing a Web-based or bibliographic name search to a dead end rather than to the available information about this trail-blazing rehabilitation engineer and disability change agent."
[8] "Speaking of personal life details, I found that there were, periodically, more tidbits given about a subject (in particular, romantic pursuits and failures, and sometimes even those of the children) than I thought were useful to mention. Such information seems beyond the meaningful parameters, maybe not of a whole book on the persons life, but certainly of a chapter targeted to his or her role in rehabilitation and disability circles."

The review highlights several aspects of the book "Enabling Lives". The most mentioned topic is the Americans with Disabilities Act, often discussed through anecdotes about the political process of creating and implementing the legislation. The book recounts how interactions with children significantly influenced the lives of some of its subjects. However, parental memories in four of the biographies were either missing or negatively impacted by strict discipline. The review notes a shared interest among the interviewees in civil rights for racial equality, though they hadn't yet acknowledged similar injustices towards people with disabilities. Justin Dart's biography stands out for its straightforward and documentary style, while Judy Heumann's has a more fictional tone. The reviewer also points out errors in the text, such as misidentifying a rehabilitation engineer named Ralf Hotch- kiss as Ralph Hodgkins, and the inclusion of unnecessary personal details about the subjects' romantic lives and children, which seem out of place in a chapter focused on their roles in rehabilitation and disability circles.

该评论强调了《赋能生活》这本书中的几个方面。提及最多的主题是《美国残疾人法案》，通常通过关于立法过程的政治故事来讨论。书中讲述了与儿童互动如何显著影响了一些受访者的生。然而，四篇传记中父母的记忆要么缺失，要么被严格的纪律所玷污。评论指出受访者对种族平等民权运动有共同的兴趣，尽管他们还没有认识到残疾人所遭受的类似不公。Justin Dart的传记以其直接和纪实的风格脱颖而出，而Judy Heumann的传记则带有更多的虚构色彩。评论还指出了文本中的错误，如将一名康复工程师Ralf Hotch- kiss误认为Ralph Hodgkins，并且包括了关于受访者浪漫生活和子女的无关细节，这似乎超出了以他们在康复和残疾圈子里的角色为焦点的章节的意义范围。
