The document discusses the use of vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts in the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with carbon dioxide. The incorporation of antimony into the vanadium oxide catalyst increases the dispersion of active vanadium species, enhances the redox properties of the system, and forms a new mixed vanadium-antimony oxide phase in the most catalytically efficient V0.43Sb0.57Ox/Al2O3 system. Antimony is found to improve the activity and on-stream stability of the catalyst.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Table 1 outlines the catalytic behaviors of alumina-supported vanadium oxide and VSb oxides in the CO2-EBDH reaction at 595°C. For this reaction, styrene is the primary product. Small quantities of benzene and toluene are obtained as by-products in the condensate along with traces of methane in the gaseous products. All catalysts studied exhibit high selectivity towards styrene (over 95%).

The V/Al catalyst exhibits initially high styrene yield (Y1 71%). As the reaction proceeds, catalytic activity decreases significantly. This was mainly due to coke formation, as evidenced by intense COx-evolution to give the recovered activity during the reoxidation of the used catalyst in an air stream at more than 550 C; over-reduction of vanadium oxidation state also takes place.
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The V/Al catalyst initially displays a high styrene yield (Y1 71%). However, as the reaction progresses, the catalytic activity declines significantly. This is primarily due to coke formation, which can be observed through the intense evolution of COx during the reoxidation of the spent catalyst in an air stream at temperatures exceeding 550 C. Additionally, there is an excessive reduction of the vanadium oxidation state.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
V/Al催化剂最初显示出较高的乙苯产率（Y1 71%）。但随着反应的进行，催化活性显著下降。这主要是由于焦炭的形成，这可以通过在超过550 C的空气流中对使用过的催化剂进行重新氧化时产生的大量COx来观察。此外，还存在过量的钒氧化态降低。

The addition of antimony oxide, which is almost inactive by itself [26], into V/Al increases not only the initial styrene yield (up to Y1 = 76%), but also provides stable catalytic performance. Among the VSb/Al systems, the V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst is found to be the best one.

Catalytic results of Table 1 reveal that the catalytic activity is mainly determined by supported vanadium oxide species while the catalyst stability is controlled by antimony oxide. Although the initial styrene yields over Al2O3-supported VSb oxide catalysts containing a medium level of Sb-content are slightly higher, their activities do not differ substantially when they are compared among themselves and with VOx/Al2O3.
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The catalytic outcomes listed in Table 1 indicate that the catalytic activity is primarily influenced by the supported vanadium oxide species, whereas catalyst stability is governed by the antimony oxide. Despite the slightly higher initial styrene yields observed in Al2O3-supported VSb oxide catalysts with a moderate Sb content, their activities do not vary significantly when compared within themselves and against VOx/Al2O3.

XRD data shows the difference between the dispersion of the supported VOx-component in the V/Al and VSb/Al catalysts. The fresh V/Al sample contains crystalline V2O5-phase, but this phase is transformed into V2O3 phase during the reaction. However, active VOx-component in the fresh and used VSb/Al catalysts is amorphous.
