The document discusses the use of vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts in the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with carbon dioxide. The incorporation of antimony into the vanadium oxide catalyst increases the dispersion of active vanadium species, enhances the redox properties of the system, and forms a new mixed vanadium-antimony oxide phase in the most catalytically efficient V0.43Sb0.57Ox/Al2O3 system. Antimony is found to improve the activity and on-stream stability of the catalyst.

The V/Al catalyst exhibits initially high styrene yield (Y1 71%). As the reaction proceeds, catalytic activity decreases significantly. This was mainly due to coke formation, as evidenced by intense COx-evolution to give the recovered activity during the reoxidation of the used catalyst in an air stream at more than 550 C; over-reduction of vanadium oxidation state also takes place.

The V/Al catalyst initially displays a high styrene yield (Y1 71%). However, as the reaction progresses, the catalytic activity declines significantly. This is primarily due to coke formation, which can be observed through the intense evolution of COx during the reoxidation of the spent catalyst in an air stream at temperatures exceeding 550 C. Additionally, there is an excessive reduction of the vanadium oxidation state.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The addition of antimony oxide as a co-component to alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly improves their activity and on-stream stability in the CO2-EBDH reaction. This enhancement is attributed to the improved dispersion of the active vanadium oxide component, increased redox properties of the systems, and the formation of a new mixed vanadium antimony oxide phase. Antimony acts as a spillover oxygen donor, inhibiting deep reduction of the active sites and promoting efficient re-oxidation. The most efficient catalyst, V0.43Sb0.57Ox/Al2O3, lacks deeply reduced vanadium ions, contributing to its stability and efficiency.

1. The catalyst's performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is influenced by the electronic structure and the presence of dopants. In the case of nickel oxide-based catalysts, the electronic structure is shaped by the preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and the formation of vacancies. This, in turn, affects the catalytic performance. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the detailed mechanisms of the reactions, predicting the effects of different preparation methods and dopant concentrations, and ensuring the stability and safety of the processes.

2. Antimony oxide plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of the vanadium oxide-based catalysts used in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. By incorporating antimony into the catalyst, not only does it increase the initial yield of desired products, but it also improves the long-term stability of the catalyst, reducing the risk of deactivation due to the formation of coke or other byproducts.

3. The dispersion of the vanadium oxide component on the support surface is a critical factor affecting the stability and performance of the catalyst. A better dispersion leads to increased amounts of mobile lattice oxygen, which facilitates the redox cycles and contributes to the overall stability of the catalyst.

4. The addition of antimony oxide as a spillover oxygen donor helps inhibit the deep reduction of the catalyst, thereby preventing the formation of highly reduced vanadium species. This not only enhances the re-oxidizability of the catalyst but also reduces the formation of byproducts like coke, contributing to a safer and more efficient catalytic process.

1. 尼克尔氧化物基催化剂的性能受到电子结构和掺杂剂的影响。在镍氧化物基催化剂的情况下，电子结构由制备方法、掺杂剂浓度以及空位的形成塑造。这进而影响催化性能。在理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性方面的关键挑战包括理解反应的详细机制、预测不同制备方法和掺杂剂浓度的效果，并确保过程的安全性。

2. 砷氧化物在提高钒氧化物基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的活性和稳定性方面起着关键作用。通过将砷引入催化剂中，不仅可以增加初始目标产物的产率，而且还可以提供稳定的催化性能，降低由于焦炭或其他副产品的形成导致催化剂失活的风险。

3. 钒氧化物成分在支持表面的分散是影响催化剂稳定性和性能的关键因素。更好的分散促进了移动晶格氧的增加，这有利于红ox循环并有助于催化剂的整体稳定性。

4. 在催化剂中添加砷氧化物作为溢出氧供体有助于抑制催化剂的深度还原，从而防止形成高度还原的钒物种。这不仅增强了催化剂的可氧化性，而且减少了像焦炭这样的副产品的形成，从而促进更安全、更高效的催化过程。
