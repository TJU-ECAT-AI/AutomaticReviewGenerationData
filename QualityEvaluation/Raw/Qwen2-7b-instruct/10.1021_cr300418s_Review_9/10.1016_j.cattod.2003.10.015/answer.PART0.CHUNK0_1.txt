[1] "Among a series of tested additives to VOx/Al2O3 catalyst, antimony oxide was found to be the best second additional component improving the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst activity and stability."
[2] "Incorporation of antimony into VOx/Al2O3 increases dispersion of the active VOx-component, enhances redox properties of the systems and forms a new mixed VSb oxide phase V1.1Sb0.9O4 in the most efficient binary V0.43Sb0.57Ox/Al2O3 catalyst."
[3] "The observed enhancement of the catalytic behavior as a result of the addition of antimony oxide seems to be related with the improved catalyst reducibility (H2-TPR of Fig. 2) and re-oxidizability by CO2 (Fig. 3)."
[4] "The role of antimony in the Sb-poor VSbOx/Al2O3 catalysts could be interpreted as a spillover oxygen donor in the frame of the remote control mechanism theory elaborated by Delmon."
[5] "Antimony oxide was found to be an effective co-component of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts for the CO2-EBDH reaction improving its activity and especially on-stream stability."

The addition of antimony oxide as a co-component to alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly improves their activity and on-stream stability in the CO2-EBDH reaction. This enhancement is attributed to the improved dispersion of the active vanadium oxide component, increased redox properties of the systems, and the formation of a new mixed vanadium antimony oxide phase. Antimony acts as a spillover oxygen donor, inhibiting deep reduction of the active sites and promoting efficient re-oxidation. The most efficient catalyst, V0.43Sb0.57Ox/Al2O3, lacks deeply reduced vanadium ions, contributing to its stability and efficiency.

添加三氧化二锑作为铝氧载体钒氧化物催化剂的辅助成分，显著提高了其在二氧化碳乙苯脱氢反应中的活性和在线稳定性。这种增强主要归因于活性钒氧化物组分的分散性改善、系统还原性的增加以及新混合钒锑氧化物相的形成。三氧化二锑作为溢出氧供体，抑制了活性位点的深度还原并促进了高效的再氧化。效率最高的催化剂V0.43Sb0.57Ox/Al2O3几乎不含深还原的钒离子，这有助于其稳定性和效率。
