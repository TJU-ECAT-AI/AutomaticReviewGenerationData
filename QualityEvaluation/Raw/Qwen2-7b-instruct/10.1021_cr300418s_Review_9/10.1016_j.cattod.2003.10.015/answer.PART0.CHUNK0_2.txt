Catalytic results of Table 1 reveal that the catalytic activity is mainly determined by supported vanadium oxide species while the catalyst stability is controlled by antimony oxide. Although the initial styrene yields over Al2O3-supported VSb oxide catalysts containing a medium level of Sb-content are slightly higher,their activities do not differ substantially when they are compared among themselves and with VOx/Al2O3.
However, the catalyst stability is much improved by the addition of the antimony promoter and its stabil- ity is much dependent on the V/Sb ratio in the cat- alysts. Among the supported VSb oxide catalysts,
V0.43Sb0.57Ox/Al2O3 is the most active and stable one.

The catalytic activity is primarily influenced by the supported vanadium oxide components, whereas the catalyst stability is governed by the antimony oxide. While medium Sb-content in Al2O3-supported VSb oxide catalysts might offer slightly higher initial styrene yields, the activities among these catalysts do not vary significantly. The addition of antimony promoter significantly enhances the catalyst stability, and this stability is highly dependent on the V/Sb ratio. Within the series of supported VSb oxide catalysts, V0.43Sb0.57Ox/Al2O3 stands out as the most active and stable catalyst.

催化活性主要由支持的钒氧化物成分决定，而催化剂稳定性则由锑氧化物控制。虽然在含中等Sb含量的Al2O3支持的VSb氧化物催化剂中，初始苯乙烯产率可能略高一些，但这些催化剂之间的活性变化不大。添加锑促进剂可以显著提高催化剂稳定性，这种稳定性高度依赖于V/Sb比。在系列支持的VSb氧化物催化剂中，V0.43Sb0.57Ox/Al2O3表现出最高的活性和稳定性。

Moreover, when the total amount of CO produced up to 45 CO2 pulses is estimated on the basis of the content of V2O5 in the catalysts, the data clearly point out the much high re-oxidizability of the V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst,i.e., 0.268 mol CO/mol V2O5 for V0.43Sb0.57/Al vs.
0.041 mol CO/mol V2O5 for V/Al.

Furthermore, when estimating the total amount of CO produced through 45 CO2 pulses based on the V2O5 content in the catalysts, the data clearly highlight the significantly higher re-oxidizability of the V0.43Sb0.57/Al catalyst. Specifically, the re-oxidizability is 0.268 mol CO/mol V2O5 for V0.43Sb0.57/Al compared to 0.041 mol CO/mol V2O5 for V/Al.

此外，根据催化剂中的V2O5含量估算通过45个CO2脉冲产生的总CO量时，数据明确指出V0.43Sb0.57/Al催化剂具有显著更高的重新氧化能力。具体而言，V0.43Sb0.57/Al的重新氧化能力为0.268 mol CO/mol V2O5，而V/Al仅为0.041 mol CO/mol V2O5。
