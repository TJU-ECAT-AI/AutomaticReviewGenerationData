[1] "V/Al catalyst exhibits initially high styrene yield (Y1 71%). As the reaction proceeds, catalytic activity decreases significantly. This was mainly due to coke formation, as evidenced by intense COx-evolution to give the recovered activity during the reoxidation of the used catalyst in an air stream at more than 550 C; over-reduction of vanadium oxidation state also takes place."
[2] "Incorporation of antimony into V/Al increases not only the initial styrene yield (up to Y1 = 76%), but also provides stable catalytic performance."
[3] "The better dispersion of vanadium oxide component on the support surface also contributed to the better stability of the VSb/Al catalysts providing easier reducible spread active VOx-component with increased amounts of mobile lattice oxygen."
[4] "Addition of spillover oxygen donor phases, like antimony oxide, to the reducible oxides (spillover oxygen acceptor) contributes to inhibition of their deep reduction, which may be attributable to the capability of spillover oxygen species to reoxidize the reduced active sites with high efficiency."

1. The catalyst's performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is influenced by the electronic structure and the presence of dopants. In the case of nickel oxide-based catalysts, the electronic structure is shaped by the preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and the formation of vacancies. This, in turn, affects the catalytic performance. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the detailed mechanisms of the reactions, predicting the effects of different preparation methods and dopant concentrations, and ensuring the stability and safety of the processes.

2. Antimony oxide plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of the vanadium oxide-based catalysts used in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. By incorporating antimony into the catalyst, not only does it increase the initial yield of desired products, but it also improves the long-term stability of the catalyst, reducing the risk of deactivation due to the formation of coke or other byproducts.

3. The dispersion of the vanadium oxide component on the support surface is a critical factor affecting the stability and performance of the catalyst. A better dispersion leads to increased amounts of mobile lattice oxygen, which facilitates the redox cycles and contributes to the overall stability of the catalyst.

4. The addition of antimony oxide as a spillover oxygen donor helps inhibit the deep reduction of the catalyst, thereby preventing the formation of highly reduced vanadium species. This not only enhances the re-oxidizability of the catalyst but also reduces the formation of byproducts like coke, contributing to a safer and more efficient catalytic process.
