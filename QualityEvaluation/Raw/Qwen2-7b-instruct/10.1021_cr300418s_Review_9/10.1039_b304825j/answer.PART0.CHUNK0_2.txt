[1] "The role of CO2 in catalytic reactions can give several merits in catalysis such as acceleration of the reaction rate, enhancement of product selectivity, alleviation of chemical equilibrium, suppression of the total oxidation, and prevention of hot spots on the catalyst surface."
[2] "It is worth noting that the stability of VSb/Al catalysts is much better than that of the unmodified one."
[3] "The addition of antimony oxide to V/Al leads to a profound effect on its activity and catalyst stability."
[4] "The improved catalyst activity and stability is likely to arise from the presence of the latter VSb phase, which induces a facile redox transformation of vanadium ions."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Specifically, the addition of antimony oxide to vanadium oxide catalysts enhances their activity and stability. This is attributed to the facile redox transformation of vanadium ions, facilitated by the presence of the mixed vanadiumantimony oxide phase, V1.1Sb0.9O4. The stability of the VSb/Al catalysts is notably superior to the unmodified catalyst. These catalysts show an accelerated reaction rate, enhanced product selectivity, and suppression of total oxidation, among other benefits.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成会影响它们在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能。特别是，向钒氧化物催化剂中添加锑氧化物可以增强其活性和稳定性。这归因于范德华离子的易于还原性转换，这是由存在于V1.1Sb0.9O4这种混合钒锑氧化物相中的催化体系促进的。与未经修改的催化剂相比，VSb/Al催化剂的稳定性显著提高。这些催化剂显示出反应速率加快、产物选择性增强以及总氧化抑制等优势。
