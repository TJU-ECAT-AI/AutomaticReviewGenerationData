The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts impact their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as converting ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene, by affecting the catalyst's ability to facilitate the redox transformations necessary for these reactions. Specifically, the presence of dopants like antimony enhances the redox properties of the catalyst, accelerating the reaction rate and improving product selectivity. The formation of vacancies can alter the electronic structure, influencing the catalyst's activity and stability. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the complex interactions between reactants and catalyst surfaces, optimizing the catalyst design for balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety, and understanding how different preparation methods affect the catalyst's long-term performance. Process optimization requires careful control of synthesis conditions to achieve the desired dopant distribution and vacancy formation, ensuring consistent and reproducible catalyst performance.
