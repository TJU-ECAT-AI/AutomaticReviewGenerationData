The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the redox properties of the catalyst. Specifically, the introduction of antimony into the vanadium oxide component enhances the catalyst's ability to undergo facile redox transformations, leading to improved activity and stability. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include accurately predicting the catalyst's behavior under various conditions, optimizing the dopant concentration for maximum performance, and ensuring the catalyst remains stable over multiple reaction cycles without compromising the selectivity towards desired products. The presence of the mixed vanadiumantimony oxide phase, V1.1Sb0.9O4, contributes to these improvements by facilitating the redox transformation of vanadium ions, thereby enhancing the catalyst's performance in the CO2-EBDH reaction.
