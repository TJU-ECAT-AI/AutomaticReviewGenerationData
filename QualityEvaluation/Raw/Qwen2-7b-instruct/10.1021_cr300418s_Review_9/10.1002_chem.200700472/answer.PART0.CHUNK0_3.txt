[1] "Our results, which include characterization of the catalysts in the functioning state by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and Raman spectroscopy, combined with conventional testing in a once-through fixed-bed reactor, give evidence for the participation of surface oxygen species in the CO oxidation reaction."
[2] "The enhanced activity of Au/Fe-TiO2 can be explained by a positive effect of iron doping, which we infer influenced the activity of the catalyst by increasing the interaction of the gold with the support (as evidenced by STEM) and generating defects where O2 can be activated by forming highly reactive oxygen species."
[3] "The EXAFS results indicate a strong interaction between the gold in these clusters and the support, as evidenced by the AuO contribution (and tentatively by the AuTi contribution)."
[4] "The enhanced activity of the catalysts prepared with the iron-modified TiO2 support is inferred to result from the promoting effect of iron in forming oxygen vacancies at the clustersupport interface, near which reactive intermediate oxygen species are generated."

1. The characterization of the catalysts in the functioning state by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and Raman spectroscopy, combined with conventional testing in a once-through fixed-bed reactor, provides evidence for the involvement of surface oxygen species in the CO oxidation reaction.
2. The improved activity of Au/Fe-TiO2 catalysts is attributed to the positive impact of iron doping, which increases the interaction between gold and the support, and creates defects that activate oxygen by forming reactive oxygen species.
3. The EXAFS data reveal a strong interaction between the gold clusters and the support, as indicated by the AuO contribution.
4. The enhanced activity of catalysts with the iron-modified TiO2 support is believed to stem from iron's role in creating oxygen vacancies near the interface between the clusters and the support, leading to the generation of reactive intermediate oxygen species.

1. 在功能状态对催化剂进行的X射线吸收边近端结构（XANES）、扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）和拉曼光谱的表征，结合一次通过固定床反应器的常规测试，为CO氧化反应中表面氧物种的参与提供了证据。
2. Au/Fe-TiO2催化剂的增强活性归因于铁掺杂的正效应，它通过增加金与支撑物的相互作用并产生激活氧气形成高度活性氧物种的缺陷来影响活性。
3. EXAFS结果表明，金簇与支撑物之间存在强烈相互作用，这是由AuO贡献所证明的。
4. 铁修饰TiO2支持的催化剂活性增强被认为源自铁在簇-支撑界面形成氧空位的作用，这些氧空位附近生成了活性中间氧物种。
