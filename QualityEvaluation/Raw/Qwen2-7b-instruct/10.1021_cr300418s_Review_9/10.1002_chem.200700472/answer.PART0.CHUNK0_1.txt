[1] "Since Haruta and co-workers demonstrated the high catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles for CO oxidation,1,2 the field of catalysis by gold has expanded to include a wide range of other reactions, exemplified by H2O2 synthesis,3 selective oxidation of alcohols, including polyols,4,5 chemically selective reduction of substituted aromatic nitro compounds,6 carboncarbon bond formation,7 hydrocarbon oxidation,8 and numerous others."
[2] "The effect of gold particle size is considered to be of paramount importance, but evidence indicates that, in catalytic CO oxidation, the support may also play an important role, either direct or indirect, in determining the activity and selectivity.12,916"
[3] "Recently, Shou etal.29 showed that the introduction of iron as a modifier of Au/TiO2 catalysts increases the activity and stability, but this material did not have appreciable activity at temperatures below 293K."
[4] "Our results, which include characterization of the catalysts in the functioning state by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and Raman spectroscopy, combined with conventional testing in a once-through fixed-bed reactor, give evidence for the participation of surface oxygen species in the CO oxidation reaction."
[5] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalyst-performance results offers a relatively complete picture of the working catalyst. Modification of the TiO2 by introduction of a small amount of iron (ca. 0.5wt%) leads to the substitution of Ti4+ ions by Fe3+ in the TiO2 structure and generates oxygen vacancies."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts can significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the dopant concentration, such as iron in the case of TiO2, can increase the number of oxygen vacancies, which in turn can enhance the activity of the catalyst. This enhancement is due to the promotion of oxygen activation and supply, particularly through the formation of reactive oxygen species like superoxide. The electronic structure of the catalyst is altered by the dopant, leading to changes in the adsorption of reactants and products, thereby affecting the catalytic performance. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure modifications and the dynamics of the reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface. Process optimization involves balancing factors such as reaction conditions, catalyst loading, and reaction time to achieve optimal efficiency, selectivity, and safety. Balancing these factors requires a deep understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the ability to tailor the catalyst properties to match the desired reaction conditions.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成可以显著影响它们在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能。具体来说，掺杂浓度，例如TiO2中的铁，可以增加氧空位的数量，从而增强催化剂的活性。这种增强是由于促进了氧气激活和供应，特别是通过形成反应物种如超氧的活性。催化剂的电子结构由于掺杂而发生变化，导致反应物和产物吸附的变化，从而影响催化性能。理论建模的关键挑战包括准确预测电子结构的修改和反应中间体的动力学。过程优化涉及平衡反应条件、催化剂负载和反应时间等参数，以实现最佳效率、选择性和安全性。平衡这些因素需要深入理解反应机制，并能够根据所需反应条件调整催化剂性质。
