[1] "Since Haruta and co-workers demonstrated the high catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles for CO oxidation,1,2 the field of catalysis by gold has expanded to include a wide range of other reactions, exemplified by H2O2 synthesis,3 selective oxidation of alcohols, including polyols,4,5 chemically selective reduction of substituted aromatic nitro compounds,6 carboncarbon bond formation,7 hydrocarbon oxidation,8 and numerous others."
[2] "The effect of gold particle size is considered to be of paramount importance, but evidence indicates that, in catalytic CO oxidation, the support may also play an important role, either direct or indirect, in determining the activity and selectivity.12,916"
[3] "The addition of iron to high-area TiO2 (Degussa P25, a mixture of anatase and rutile) increases the number of oxygen defect sites that react with O2 to form peroxide and superoxide species."
[4] "Our results, which include characterization of the catalysts in the functioning state by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and Raman spectroscopy, combined with conventional testing in a once-through fixed-bed reactor, give evidence for the participation of surface oxygen species in the CO oxidation reaction."
[5] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalyst-performance results offers a relatively complete picture of the working catalyst. Modification of the TiO2 by introduction of a small amount of iron (ca. 0.5wt%) leads to the substitution of Ti4+ ions by Fe3+ in the TiO2 structure and generates oxygen vacancies."
[6] "The EXAFS results indicate a strong interaction between the gold in these clusters and the support, as evidenced by the AuO contribution (and tentatively by the AuTi contribution)."
[7] "The enhanced activity of Au/Fe-TiO2 can be explained by a positive effect of iron doping, which we infer influenced the activity of the catalyst by increasing the interaction of the gold with the support (as evidenced by STEM) and generating defects where O2 can be activated by forming highly reactive oxygen species."
[8] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalyst-performance results offers a relatively complete picture of the working catalyst."
[9] "The possibility of modifying a support to increase the availability of reactive oxygen species such as peroxides is of quite general interest and may be expected to be useful in the design of novel catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity for various oxidation reactions."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions in several ways. Increasing the dopant concentration can lead to an increase in the number of oxygen defect sites, which react with O2 to form peroxide and superoxide species. This can enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The electronic structure is altered by the dopants, affecting the reactivity of the surface species involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The vacancy formation can also play a crucial role in the activation of reactants, providing reactive oxygen species necessary for the reactions. Challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the complex interactions between the dopants, the support, and the reactants. Process optimization requires balancing factors such as temperature, pressure, and reactant flow rates to achieve optimal activity and selectivity. Safety considerations involve understanding and controlling the potential hazards associated with high-temperature and high-pressure environments, as well as managing the reactive intermediates produced during the reactions. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety necessitates a deep understanding of the reaction mechanisms and careful experimental design.
