[1] "The effect of gold particle size is considered to be of paramount importance, but evidence indicates that, in catalytic CO oxidation, the support may also play an important role, either direct or indirect, in determining the activity and selectivity."
[2] "Our results, which include characterization of the catalysts in the functioning state by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and Raman spectroscopy, combined with conventional testing in a once-through fixed-bed reactor, give evidence for the participation of surface oxygen species in the CO oxidation reaction."
[3] "The superior activity of gold supported on iron-modified TiO2 relative to Au/TiO2 could then be attributed to the presence of highly reactive oxygen species (specifically, η1-superoxide and peroxide adspecies) at one-electron defect sites, consistent with the Raman spectra of the working catalyst."
[4] "The enhanced activity of Au/Fe-TiO2 can be explained by a positive effect of iron doping, which we infer influenced the activity of the catalyst by increasing the interaction of the gold with the support (as evidenced by STEM) and generating defects where O2 can be activated by forming highly reactive oxygen species."
[5] "The EXAFS results indicate a strong interaction between the gold in these clusters and the support, as evidenced by the AuO contribution (and tentatively by the AuTi contribution)."
[6] "The data reported here demonstrate a correlation between the catalytic activity of gold supported on iron-modified TiO2 and the density of reactive η1-superoxide and peroxide species at one-electron defect sites on the support."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, in catalytic CO oxidation, the support plays an important role in determining the activity and selectivity, alongside the size of gold particles. The iron doping in the TiO2 structure increases the interaction of gold with the support and generates defects, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species such as η1-superoxide and peroxide adspecies. These species contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity. The strong interaction between gold clusters and the support is also crucial for the catalytic performance, as evidenced by the AuO and AuTi contributions in the EXAFS data. The correlation between the catalytic activity of the gold supported on iron-modified TiO2 and the density of reactive oxygen species at one-electron defect sites on the support demonstrates the importance of these factors in optimizing the catalytic system for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include accurately predicting the electronic structure and the distribution of reactive oxygen species, understanding the detailed mechanisms of the catalytic processes, and ensuring the stability and durability of the catalysts under various operating conditions. Achieving a precise balance between these factors requires sophisticated computational methods, detailed kinetic analysis, and rigorous experimental validation.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响它们在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯到苯乙烯和乙烷到乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能。例如，在催化CO氧化中，支持对活性和选择性起着重要作用，这与金颗粒的大小有关。铁掺杂在TiO2结构中增加了金与支持的相互作用，并产生了缺陷，导致形成活性氧物种，如η1超氧和过氧亚基物种。这些物种促进了催化活性的增强。EXAFS结果表明，金簇与支持之间的强相互作用是通过AuO贡献（以及推测的AuTi贡献）得到的证据。报道的数据证明了铁改性的TiO2上支持的金负载与支持上的一电子缺陷点处的活性氧物种密度之间的相关性，这强调了这些因素在优化氧化脱氢反应的催化系统时的重要性。

在理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战包括准确预测电子结构和活性氧物种的分布、理解催化过程的详细机制以及确保在各种操作条件下催化剂的稳定性和耐用性。实现这些因素之间的精确平衡需要先进的计算方法、详细的动力学分析和严格的实验验证。
