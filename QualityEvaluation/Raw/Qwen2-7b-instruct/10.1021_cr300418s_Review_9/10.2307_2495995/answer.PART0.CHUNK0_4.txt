[1] "This would be lamentable under any circumstances, but it is particularly so in the case of a badly neglected field where acceptable texts are rare and works of in-depth scholarship are virtually nonexistent."
[2] "One's regret is even greater because the present volume might have had the incidental but desirable effect of encouraging American scholars to pay more attention to the work of their German colleagues, many of whom have done and are currently doing outstanding research."
[3] "Professor Wesson nevertheless has fundamentally achieved what he set out to do. He has written the kind of readable textbook, thematically integrated but with much useful illustrative detail, that many students want and probably need."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the complex interactions between the catalyst components and the reaction environment, predicting the precise conditions that maximize desired outcomes while minimizing unwanted side reactions, and ensuring the practical safety and environmental impact of the catalytic processes. The lack of comprehensive and in-depth scholarly works in the field hinders the advancement of knowledge and the development of innovative solutions to these challenges.
