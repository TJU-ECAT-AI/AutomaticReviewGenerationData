[1] "The oxidation of carbon monoxide over nickel oxide catalysts containing lithium or chromium in solid solution has been studied in the temperature range from 300-450C."
[2] "Activation energies range from 22.2 kcal mole-1 for NiO + 5 % Cr to 17.0 kcalmole-1 for NiO + 2-8 % Li, and NiO + 2-8 % Li again has the greatest specific activity."
[3] "The surface area results in fig. 1 reflect differences in sintering rates for the various solid solutions."
[4] "The study of CO oxidation shows that an increase in the positive hole concentration is accompanied by a systematic increase in the specific activity above 300C, thus confirming the conclusion invoked by Schwab and Block on the basis of their activation energy studies."
[5] "The first-order kinetics for carbon monoxide imply that CO chemisorption at low coverages is rate-determining, as pointed out by Schwab and Block."
[6] "The lower rates with hydrogen are consistent with the general experience that the interaction of CO with oxides, whether in simple chemisorption or reduction, occurs at a lower threshold temperature."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by altering the concentration and mobility of positive holes. This, in turn, affects the rate of chemisorption and the overall catalytic activity. For instance, lithium doping increases the positive hole concentration, leading to an increase in specific activity above 300°C. However, there is a compensation effect between the pre-exponential factor (ko) and the activation energy (E), resulting in a small increase in activity despite the increase in hole concentration. The interaction of carbon monoxide with oxides, particularly its chemisorption, is rate-determining in these reactions, influenced by the presence of holes and the potential barrier presented at the surface. The lower reaction rates with hydrogen compared to carbon monoxide can be attributed to the general experience that interactions involving CO with oxides occur at a lower threshold temperature. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involve understanding the complex interplay between the electronic structure, kinetic parameters, and the physical properties of the catalysts.

在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成通过改变正电荷的浓度和移动性来影响其电子结构和催化性能。这进而影响化学吸附速率和整体催化活性。例如，锂掺杂增加了正电荷浓度，导致特定活动度在300°C以上增加。然而，预指数因子（ko）和活化能（E）之间存在补偿效应，导致尽管孔浓度增加，但活动度增加很小。碳氧化合物与氧化物的相互作用，特别是其化学吸附，在这些反应中是决定性的，受表面存在的势垒的影响，并且由存在的孔和电子结构所调节。氢与氧化物的相互作用比二氧化碳具有更低的阈值温度，这可以解释氢反应速率较低的原因。在理论建模、过程优化以及平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战涉及理解催化剂的复杂相互作用机制，包括电子结构、动力学参数和物理性质之间的相互作用。
