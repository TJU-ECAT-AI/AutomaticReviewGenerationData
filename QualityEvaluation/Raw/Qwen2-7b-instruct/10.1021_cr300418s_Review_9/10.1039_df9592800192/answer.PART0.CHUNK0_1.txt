[1] "The study of CO oxidation shows that an increase in the positive hole concentration is accompanied by a systematic increase in the specific activity above 300C, thus confirming the conclusion invoked by Schwab and Block on the basis of their activation energy studies."
[2] "The first-order kinetics for carbon monoxide imply that CO chemisorption at low coverages is rate-determining, as pointed out by Schwab and Block. This also can be easily justified."
[3] "The reason for the compensation effect is a notoriously difficult problem in catalysis. As far as this reaction is concerned, the rate of chemi sorption of carbon monoxide will be governed, inter alia, by the concentration of holes, by their mobility and by the shape of the potential barrier which is pre sented at the surface."
[4] "The lower rates with hydrogen are consistent with the general experience that the interaction of CO with oxides, whether in simple chemisorption or reduction, occurs at a lower threshold temperature."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The increase in positive hole concentration leads to an increase in specific activity above 300°C. The first-order kinetics for carbon monoxide suggest that CO chemisorption at low coverages is the rate-determining step. The compensation effect in catalysis is attributed to the complex interplay between the concentration of holes, their mobility, and the shape of the potential barrier presented at the surface. The lower reaction rates with hydrogen compared to carbon monoxide are consistent with the general experience that the interaction of CO with oxides occurs at a lower threshold temperature. However, the key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems remain substantial due to the intricate nature of the catalytic processes involved.

在镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成的影响下，这些催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能显著受到影响。正空穴浓度的增加伴随着特定活性在300°C以上的系统性增加，这证实了Schwab和Block基于其活化能研究的结论。对于一氧化碳而言，第一级动力学表明低覆盖度下的CO化学吸附是决定性的步骤。补偿效应在催化领域中是一个极其困难的问题。对于这种反应来说，CO化学吸附的速度受孔浓度、它们的移动性和表面所呈现的势垒形状等因素的共同影响。与氢气相比，一氧化碳与氧化物的相互作用在较低阈值温度下发生，这是氢反应速率较低的一致经验。然而，理论建模、过程优化以及在这些催化体系中平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战仍然巨大，这主要是由于催化过程的复杂性质。
