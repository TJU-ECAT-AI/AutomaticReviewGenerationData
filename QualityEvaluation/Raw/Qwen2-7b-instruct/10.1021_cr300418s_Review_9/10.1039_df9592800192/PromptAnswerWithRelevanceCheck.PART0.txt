[1] "The oxidation of carbon monoxide over nickel oxide catalysts containing lithium or chromium in solid solution has been studied in the temperature range from 300-450C."
[2] "Activation energies range from 22.2 kcal mole-1 for NiO + 5 % Cr to 17.0 kcalmole-1 for NiO + 2-8 % Li, and NiO + 2-8 % Li again has the greatest specific activity."
[3] "The study of CO oxidation shows that an increase in the positive hole concentration is accompanied by a systematic increase in the specific activity above 300C, thus confirming the conclusion invoked by Schwab and Block 8913 on the basis of their activation energy studies."
[4] "The first-order kinetics for carbon monoxide imply that CO chemisorption at low coverages is rate-determining, as pointed out by Schwab and Block. This also can be easily justified."
[5] "The lower rates with hydrogen are consistent with the general experience that the interaction of CO with oxides, whether in simple chemisorption or reduction, occurs at a lower threshold temperature."
[6] "We have been concerned by a recent report 17 that nickel can be nucleated in nickel oxide merely by heating in vacuo at 210C."
[7] "With a greased joint eliminated and the protecting traps permanently cooled, no darkening was detected during outgassing at 500C for 10 h."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the concentration of positive holes, the mobility of these holes, and the potential barrier presented at the surface. These factors in turn impact the rates of chemisorption and desorption processes, which are crucial for catalytic reactions. For instance, an increase in positive hole concentration leads to a systematic increase in the specific activity above 300C, as confirmed by studies on CO oxidation. The introduction of dopants like lithium and chromium changes the electronic properties of the catalysts, influencing their reactivity. However, the challenges in theoretical modeling involve accurately predicting the complex interplay between electronic, thermodynamic, and kinetic factors. Process optimization requires balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety, often necessitating detailed experimental characterization and iterative testing. Safety concerns arise from the risk of contaminating the catalyst with impurities during preparation, which can affect the catalytic performance and stability. Proper handling and rigorous testing procedures are essential to mitigate these risks.

在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成影响其电子结构和催化性能，主要通过影响正空穴浓度、空穴的移动性和表面所呈现的势垒。这些因素进而影响吸附和脱附过程的速率，对于催化反应至关重要。例如，在CO氧化中，正空穴浓度的增加伴随着特定活性的系统性提高，这证实了Schwab和Block基于激活能研究得出的结论。掺入锂和铬等掺杂剂改变了催化剂的电子性质，从而影响其活性。然而，理论建模的挑战在于准确预测电子、热力学和动力学因素之间的复杂相互作用。过程优化需要平衡效率、选择性和安全性，通常需要详细的实验表征和迭代测试。安全问题来自于准备过程中可能将杂质污染催化剂的风险，这会影响催化剂的性能和稳定性。妥善处理和严格测试程序是降低这些风险的关键。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The increase in positive hole concentration leads to an increase in specific activity above 300°C. The first-order kinetics for carbon monoxide suggest that CO chemisorption at low coverages is the rate-determining step. The compensation effect in catalysis is attributed to the complex interplay between the concentration of holes, their mobility, and the shape of the potential barrier presented at the surface. The lower reaction rates with hydrogen compared to carbon monoxide are consistent with the general experience that the interaction of CO with oxides occurs at a lower threshold temperature. However, the key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems remain substantial due to the intricate nature of the catalytic processes involved.

在镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成的影响下，这些催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能显著受到影响。正空穴浓度的增加伴随着特定活性在300°C以上的系统性增加，这证实了Schwab和Block基于其活化能研究的结论。对于一氧化碳而言，第一级动力学表明低覆盖度下的CO化学吸附是决定性的步骤。补偿效应在催化领域中是一个极其困难的问题。对于这种反应来说，CO化学吸附的速度受孔浓度、它们的移动性和表面所呈现的势垒形状等因素的共同影响。与氢气相比，一氧化碳与氧化物的相互作用在较低阈值温度下发生，这是氢反应速率较低的一致经验。然而，理论建模、过程优化以及在这些催化体系中平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战仍然巨大，这主要是由于催化过程的复杂性质。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by altering the concentration and mobility of positive holes. This, in turn, affects the rate of chemisorption and the overall catalytic activity. For instance, lithium doping increases the positive hole concentration, leading to an increase in specific activity above 300°C. However, there is a compensation effect between the pre-exponential factor (ko) and the activation energy (E), resulting in a small increase in activity despite the increase in hole concentration. The interaction of carbon monoxide with oxides, particularly its chemisorption, is rate-determining in these reactions, influenced by the presence of holes and the potential barrier presented at the surface. The lower reaction rates with hydrogen compared to carbon monoxide can be attributed to the general experience that interactions involving CO with oxides occur at a lower threshold temperature. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involve understanding the complex interplay between the electronic structure, kinetic parameters, and the physical properties of the catalysts.

在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成通过改变正电荷的浓度和移动性来影响其电子结构和催化性能。这进而影响化学吸附速率和整体催化活性。例如，锂掺杂增加了正电荷浓度，导致特定活动度在300°C以上增加。然而，预指数因子（ko）和活化能（E）之间存在补偿效应，导致尽管孔浓度增加，但活动度增加很小。碳氧化合物与氧化物的相互作用，特别是其化学吸附，在这些反应中是决定性的，受表面存在的势垒的影响，并且由存在的孔和电子结构所调节。氢与氧化物的相互作用比二氧化碳具有更低的阈值温度，这可以解释氢反应速率较低的原因。在理论建模、过程优化以及平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战涉及理解催化剂的复杂相互作用机制，包括电子结构、动力学参数和物理性质之间的相互作用。
