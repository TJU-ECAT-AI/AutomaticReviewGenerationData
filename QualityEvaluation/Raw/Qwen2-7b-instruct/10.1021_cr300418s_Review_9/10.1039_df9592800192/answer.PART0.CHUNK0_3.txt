[1] "The oxidation of carbon monoxide over nickel oxide catalysts containing lithium or chromium in solid solution has been studied in the temperature range from 300-450C."
[2] "Activation energies range from 22.2 kcal mole-1 for NiO + 5 % Cr to 17.0 kcalmole-1 for NiO + 2.8 % Li, and NiO + 2-8 % Li again has the greatest specific activity."
[3] "The reason for the compensation effect is a notoriously difficult problem in catalysis."
[4] "The success of the doped oxide work in CO oxidation, N20 decomposition and, as we have now shown, in hydrogen oxidation stems primarily from this cause."
