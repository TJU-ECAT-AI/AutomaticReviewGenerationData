[1] "The oxidation of carbon monoxide over nickel oxide catalysts containing lithium or chromium in solid solution has been studied in the temperature range from 300-450C."
[2] "Activation energies range from 22.2 kcal mole-1 for NiO + 5 % Cr to 17.0 kcalmole-1 for NiO + 2-8 % Li, and NiO + 2-8 % Li again has the greatest specific activity."
[3] "The study of CO oxidation shows that an increase in the positive hole concentration is accompanied by a systematic increase in the specific activity above 300C, thus confirming the conclusion invoked by Schwab and Block 8913 on the basis of their activation energy studies."
[4] "The first-order kinetics for carbon monoxide imply that CO chemisorption at low coverages is rate-determining, as pointed out by Schwab and Block. This also can be easily justified."
[5] "The lower rates with hydrogen are consistent with the general experience that the interaction of CO with oxides, whether in simple chemisorption or reduction, occurs at a lower threshold temperature."
[6] "We have been concerned by a recent report 17 that nickel can be nucleated in nickel oxide merely by heating in vacuo at 210C."
[7] "With a greased joint eliminated and the protecting traps permanently cooled, no darkening was detected during outgassing at 500C for 10 h."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the concentration of positive holes, the mobility of these holes, and the potential barrier presented at the surface. These factors in turn impact the rates of chemisorption and desorption processes, which are crucial for catalytic reactions. For instance, an increase in positive hole concentration leads to a systematic increase in the specific activity above 300C, as confirmed by studies on CO oxidation. The introduction of dopants like lithium and chromium changes the electronic properties of the catalysts, influencing their reactivity. However, the challenges in theoretical modeling involve accurately predicting the complex interplay between electronic, thermodynamic, and kinetic factors. Process optimization requires balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety, often necessitating detailed experimental characterization and iterative testing. Safety concerns arise from the risk of contaminating the catalyst with impurities during preparation, which can affect the catalytic performance and stability. Proper handling and rigorous testing procedures are essential to mitigate these risks.

在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成影响其电子结构和催化性能，主要通过影响正空穴浓度、空穴的移动性和表面所呈现的势垒。这些因素进而影响吸附和脱附过程的速率，对于催化反应至关重要。例如，在CO氧化中，正空穴浓度的增加伴随着特定活性的系统性提高，这证实了Schwab和Block基于激活能研究得出的结论。掺入锂和铬等掺杂剂改变了催化剂的电子性质，从而影响其活性。然而，理论建模的挑战在于准确预测电子、热力学和动力学因素之间的复杂相互作用。过程优化需要平衡效率、选择性和安全性，通常需要详细的实验表征和迭代测试。安全问题来自于准备过程中可能将杂质污染催化剂的风险，这会影响催化剂的性能和稳定性。妥善处理和严格测试程序是降低这些风险的关键。
