[1] "In order to elucidate the catalytic behavior of SnO2ZrO2 nanocomposite catalysts the catalytic activity of Sn1.5Zr8.5 catalyst has been compared with its constituent oxide catalysts (Fig. 8)."
[2] "The conversion of ethylbenzene over bulk SnO2 (Sn10Zr0) is only 20.6% with the styrene selectivity of 96% and on bulk ZrO2 (Sn0Zr10) the conversion is 48.8% with the styrene selectivity of 97%, whereas over Sn1.5Zr8.5 nano- composite catalyst the conversion is 61.1% with 98% styrene selectivity."
[3] "The superior performance of Sn1.5Zr8.5 nanocomposite catalyst is not surprising. This type of peculiar character of mixed oxides such as TiO2ZrO2, MnO2ZrO2, CeO2ZrO2 have already been reported for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in our earlier reports [1518]."
[4] "Furthermore, nanosize effect might be playing a role in enhancing the catalytic activity."
[5] "The catalytic activity of Sn1.5Zr8.5 at different reaction temperatures has been shown in Fig. 9. The catalytic activity of Sn1.5Zr8.5 at 450 °C is negligible, wherein, the conversion of ethylbenzene is only 2.2% and the selectivity of styrene is 89.8%."
[6] "At 600 °C the conversion of ethylbenzene has been attained a maximum value of 61.1% with the styrene selectivity of 97.6%."
