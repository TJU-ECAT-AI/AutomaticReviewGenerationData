1. The SnO2ZrO2 nanocomposite catalysts were synthesized through a co-precipitation method using aqueous ammonia as a hydrolyzing agent at room temperature. The modification of the acidbase bi-functionality in these nanocomposites positively impacts their catalytic activity.

2. The Sn1.5Zr8.5 catalyst showed negligible activity at 450 °C, with a conversion of ethylbenzene at only 2.2% and a styrene selectivity of 89.8%.

3. The optimal reaction temperature for the Sn1.5Zr8.5 catalyst was found to be 600 °C, where the conversion of ethylbenzene reached a maximum of 61.1% with a styrene selectivity of 97.6%.
