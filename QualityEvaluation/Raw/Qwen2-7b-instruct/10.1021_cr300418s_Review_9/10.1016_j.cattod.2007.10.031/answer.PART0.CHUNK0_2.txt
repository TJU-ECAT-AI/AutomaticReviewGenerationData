2. The conversion of ethylbenzene over different compositions of SnO2ZrO2 nanocomposite catalysts with time on stream has been depicted in Fig. 7. The catalytic activity in terms of ethylbenzene conversion over Sn0.5Zr95.5 catalyst is very poor. When SnO2 content increased from 5 to 10% (Sn1Zr9) the conversion of ethylbenzene has drastically increased and at 15% SnO2 content catalyst (Sn1.5Zr8.5) the conversion is 61%.

3. The superior performance of Sn1.5Zr8.5 nanocomposite catalyst is not surprising. This type of peculiar character of mixed oxides such as TiO2ZrO2, MnO2ZrO2, CeO2ZrO2 have already been reported for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in our earlier reports [1518]. The peculiarity in the acidbase properties can be seen from Figs. 4 and 5. In the best catalyst (Sn1.5Zr8.5) weak to moderate acidic sites are higher in number than those of isolated ZrO2 and also strong acidic sites have been generated, which are believed to be originated from the SnO2 content (Fig. 5). Weak to strong basic sites have been developed, which are higher in number than those are present in the isolated oxides.

The outstanding performance of the Sn1.5Zr8.5 nanocomposite catalyst is unsurprising, considering the unique characteristics of mixed oxides like TiO2ZrO2, MnO2ZrO2, and CeO2ZrO2, which have been previously documented in our research for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation [15-18]. The distinct acid-base properties are evident in Figures 4 and 5. In the optimal catalyst (Sn1.5Zr8.5), the number of weak to moderate acidic sites exceeds those in isolated ZrO2, and strong acidic sites have been produced, which are thought to originate from the SnO2 content (Figure 5). Additionally, the development of weak to strong basic sites is higher in number than in the isolated oxides.

Sn1.5Zr8.5纳米复合催化剂的出色性能并不令人意外，考虑到之前的研究中，TiO2ZrO2、MnO2ZrO2和CeO2ZrO2等混合氧化物的独特特性已被记录下来，用于乙基苯脱氢 [15-18]。独特的酸碱性质从图4和图5中可以看出来。在最佳催化剂（Sn1.5Zr8.5）中，弱到中等酸性位点的数量超过了孤立的ZrO2，并且产生了强酸性位点，这被认为是源自SnO2的含量（图5）。此外，弱到强的基本位点的数量高于孤立氧化物中存在的情况。

3. The catalytic activity of Sn1.5Zr8.5 at different reaction temperatures has been shown in Fig. 9. The catalytic activity of Sn1.5Zr8.5 at 450 8C is negligible, wherein, the conversion of ethylbenzene is only 2.2% and the selectivity of styrene is 89.8%. As the reaction temperature increases to 500 8C the conversion of ethylbenzene augmented, but it is not so considerable amount. At 600 8C the conversion of ethylbenzene has been attained a maximum value of 61.1% with the styrene selectivity of 97.6%.
