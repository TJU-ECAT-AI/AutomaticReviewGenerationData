[1] "In this synthetic procedure, both the component oxides are mutually contributing for hastening of nucleation and prevention of particle growth."
[2] "The weight % of Sn and Zr are converted into mole% assuming 100% yields of SnO2 and ZrO2 instead of 99.8 and 98.6, respectively."
[3] "In the best catalyst (Sn1.5Zr8.5) weak to moderate acidic sites are higher in number than those of isolated ZrO2 and also strong acidic sites have been generated, which are believed to be originated from the SnO2 content (Fig. 5)."
[4] "Weak to strong basic sites have been developed, which are higher in number than those are present in the isolated oxides."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the number and strength of both acidic and basic sites on the catalyst surface. In the case of SnO2ZrO2 nanocomposite catalysts, the mutual contribution of both component oxides during synthesis enhances nucleation and prevents particle growth. The conversion of Sn and Zr from weight percentage to mole percentage is done assuming complete conversion to SnO2 and ZrO2, respectively. The best catalyst, Sn1.5Zr8.5, shows an increase in the number of weak to moderate acidic sites and strong acidic sites compared to isolated ZrO2, which are believed to originate from the SnO2 content. The development of weak to strong basic sites also exceeds those present in isolated oxides. The enhanced acid-base bi-functionality in the nanocomposite catalysts leads to improved catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, as previously observed in mixed oxide catalysts such as TiO2ZrO2, MnO2ZrO2, and CeO2ZrO2. These catalysts exhibit a unique combination of acidic and basic functionalities that facilitate the desired chemical transformations.

在镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成过程中，通过影响催化剂表面的酸性和碱性位点的数量和强度，从而影响氧化脱氢反应的电子结构和催化性能。对于SnO2ZrO2纳米复合催化剂而言，在合成过程中两种组分氧化物的相互贡献加速了晶核的形成并防止了颗粒的生长。将Sn和Zr从质量百分比转换为摩尔百分比时，假设完全转化为SnO2和ZrO2。最佳催化剂Sn1.5Zr8.5表现出与孤立ZrO2相比，酸性位点数量增加，包括弱至适度酸性位点以及源自SnO2含量的强酸性位点。同时，也发展了弱到强的碱性位点，其数量超过孤立氧化物中存在的情况。增强的酸碱双功能在纳米复合催化剂中促进了乙苯在二氧化碳存在的条件下氧化脱氢成苯乙烯的催化性能，这在我们之前的报告中已经在TiO2ZrO2、MnO2ZrO2和CeO2ZrO2等混合氧化物催化剂上观察到。这些催化剂显示出独特的酸碱功能组合，能够促进所需的化学转化。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by enhancing the acid-base bi-functional behavior. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involve understanding the complex interactions between the catalyst components and the reaction environment. The performance improvement in the Sn1.5Zr8.5 nanocomposite catalyst compared to its constituent oxides (SnO2 and ZrO2) is attributed to the synergistic effect between SnO2 and ZrO2, which leads to the development of both weak to moderate acidic sites and weak to strong basic sites. These sites cooperate to activate CO2 and ethylbenzene under reaction conditions, enhancing the catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene. The catalytic activity is optimized at 600 °C, where the conversion of ethylbenzene reaches its maximum value of 61.1% with a high styrene selectivity of 97.6%. Further increasing the reaction temperature leads to a decrease in styrene selectivity.

3. The superior performance of Sn1.5Zr8.5 nanocomposite catalyst is not surprising. This type of peculiar character of mixed oxides such as TiO2ZrO2, MnO2ZrO2, CeO2ZrO2 have already been reported for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in our earlier reports [1518].

Weak to strong basic sites have been developed, which are higher in number than those are present in the isolated oxides.

The outstanding performance of the Sn1.5Zr8.5 nanocomposite catalyst is unsurprising, considering the unique characteristics of mixed oxides like TiO2ZrO2, MnO2ZrO2, and CeO2ZrO2, which have been previously documented in our research for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation [15-18]. The distinct acid-base properties are evident in Figures 4 and 5. In the optimal catalyst (Sn1.5Zr8.5), the number of weak to moderate acidic sites exceeds those in isolated ZrO2, and strong acidic sites have been produced, which are thought to originate from the SnO2 content (Figure 5). Additionally, the development of weak to strong basic sites is higher in number than in the isolated oxides.
