[1] "In order to elucidate the catalytic behavior of SnO2ZrO2 nanocomposite catalysts the catalytic activity of Sn1.5Zr8.5 catalyst has been compared with its constituent oxide catalysts (Fig. 8)."
[2] "The superior performance of Sn1.5Zr8.5 nanocomposite catalyst is not surprising. This type of peculiar character of mixed oxides such as TiO2ZrO2, MnO2ZrO2, CeO2ZrO2 have already been reported for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in our earlier reports [1518]."
[3] "The conversion of ethylbenzene over bulk SnO2 (Sn10Zr0) is only 20.6% with the styrene selectivity of 96% and on bulk ZrO2 (Sn0Zr10) the conversion is 48.8% with the styrene selectivity of 97%, whereas over Sn1.5Zr8.5 nano-composite catalyst the conversion is 61.1% with 98% styrene selectivity."
[4] "In the best catalyst (Sn1.5Zr8.5) weak to moderate acidic sites are higher in number than those of isolated ZrO2 and also strong acidic sites have been generated, which are believed to be originated from the SnO2 content (Fig. 5)."
[5] "Weak to strong basic sites have been developed, which are higher in number than those are present in the isolated oxides."
[6] "The catalytic activity of Sn1.5Zr8.5 at different reaction temperatures has been shown in Fig. 9. The catalytic activity of Sn1.5Zr8.5 at 450 °C is negligible, wherein, the conversion of ethylbenzene is only 2.2% and the selectivity of styrene is 89.8%. As the reaction temperature increases to 500 °C the conversion of ethylbenzene augmented, but it is not so considerable amount. At 600 °C the conversion of ethylbenzene has been attained a maximum value of 61.1% with the styrene selectivity of 97.6%."
[7] "Further increase of reaction temperature to 650 °C, the conversion has been increased to 79.4%, but the selectivity of styrene has been substantially diminished."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by enhancing the acid-base bi-functional behavior. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involve understanding the complex interactions between the catalyst components and the reaction environment. The performance improvement in the Sn1.5Zr8.5 nanocomposite catalyst compared to its constituent oxides (SnO2 and ZrO2) is attributed to the synergistic effect between SnO2 and ZrO2, which leads to the development of both weak to moderate acidic sites and weak to strong basic sites. These sites cooperate to activate CO2 and ethylbenzene under reaction conditions, enhancing the catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene. The catalytic activity is optimized at 600 °C, where the conversion of ethylbenzene reaches its maximum value of 61.1% with a high styrene selectivity of 97.6%. Further increasing the reaction temperature leads to a decrease in styrene selectivity.

制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成对镍氧化物基催化剂的电子结构和氧化脱氢反应的催化性能产生了影响，通过增强酸碱双功能行为。在理论建模、过程优化以及平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战涉及理解催化剂成分与反应环境之间的复杂相互作用。Sn1.5Zr8.5纳米复合催化剂相对于其组分氧化物（SnO2和ZrO2）的性能提升归因于SnO2和ZrO2之间的作用协同效应，导致弱至中等强度的酸性位点和弱至强碱性位点的开发。这些位点合作激活CO2和乙苯，在反应条件下增强乙苯氧化脱氢为苯乙烯的催化活性。催化活性在600°C时达到最大值，乙苯转化率达到61.1%，苯乙烯选择性达到97.6%。进一步提高反应温度会导致苯乙烯选择性显著降低。
