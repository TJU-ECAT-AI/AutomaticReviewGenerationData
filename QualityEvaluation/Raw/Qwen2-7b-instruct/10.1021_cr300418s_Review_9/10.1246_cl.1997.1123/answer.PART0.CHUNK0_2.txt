The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure, which in turn affects their catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include the complexity of interactions between dopants, vacancies, and the substrate. Process optimization requires understanding the relationship between the catalyst's electronic structure and its catalytic activity. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety necessitates careful control over dopant concentration and preparation conditions.
