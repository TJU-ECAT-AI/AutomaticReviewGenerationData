The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety stem from the complexity of reaction mechanisms, the need for precise control over reaction conditions, and the risk assessment of hazardous reaction products, respectively.
