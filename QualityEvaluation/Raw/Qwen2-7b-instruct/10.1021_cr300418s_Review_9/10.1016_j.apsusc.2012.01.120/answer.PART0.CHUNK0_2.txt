[1] "A series of NiZrO catalysts with varying Zr contents were prepared by a modified solgel method using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O."
[2] "The strong interaction between Ni and Zr was detected in the synthesized catalyst."
[3] "The dopant Zr could enter the NiO lattice and lead to an increase in cell parameter."
[4] "The valence of Ni was increased due to electron transfer through the ZrONi bridge linkage."
[5] "The above two changes are believed to play important roles in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species."
[6] "The active site Ni tends to adsorb Ospecies than non-selective oxygen species O2, which is beneficial for the increase of ethylene selectivity."
[7] "At the same time, ethane conversion was decreased due to the reduced Ni concentration."
[8] "A best yield to ethylene of 40% with 66% selectivity could be obtained over 10% NiZrO catalyst at 430 C."

1. Nickel zinc oxide catalysts with different zinc concentrations were synthesized using a modified sol-gel technique involving nickel nitrate hexahydrate and zinc nitrate pentahydrate.
2. A strong interaction was identified between nickel and zinc in the synthesized catalyst.
3. Zinc could infiltrate the nickel oxide lattice, resulting in an increased cell parameter.
4. The nickel valence was elevated due to electron exchange through the zinc-nickel bond.
5. These modifications were thought to contribute to the diminished reducibility and the spatial distribution of adsorbed oxygen molecules.
6. The active site nickel tended to bind with oxygen molecules rather than non-specific oxygen molecules, which was advantageous for increasing ethylene selectivity.
7. Simultaneously, ethane conversion was reduced due to the lowered nickel concentration.
8. The optimal ethylene yield of 40% with 66% selectivity was achieved at 430°C on a 10% nickel zinc oxide catalyst.

1. 不同锌含量的镍锌氧化物催化剂使用改性的溶胶凝胶法通过硝酸镍六水合物和硝酸锌五水合物合成。
2. 合成催化剂中镍与锌之间存在强烈的相互作用。
3. 锌能够渗透到镍氧化物晶格中，导致晶格参数增加。
4. 镍的电荷被提高，这是由于锌镍键中的电子交换。
5. 这些改变被认为在减少可还原性以及吸附氧分子的空间分布方面起着重要作用。
6. 活性位点镍倾向于结合氧分子而非非选择性氧分子，这对于提高乙烯选择性是有利的。
7. 同时，由于镍浓度降低，乙烷转化率有所下降。
8. 在430°C下，10%镍锌氧化物催化剂的最佳乙烯产率为40%，选择性为66%。
