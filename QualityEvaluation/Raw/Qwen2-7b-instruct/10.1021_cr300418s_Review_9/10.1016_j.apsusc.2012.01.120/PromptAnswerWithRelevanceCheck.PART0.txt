[1] "The industrial production of ethylene from ethane is by thermal pyrolysis,which is a costly process in energy [1]."
[2] "Due to the complex multi-component structure, however,the mechanisms of the type of catalysts are difficult to be investigated."
[3] "The selectivity to ethylene,however,is not desirable enough."
[4] "Although the ethylene selectivity could be increased effectively when NiO was loaded on the supports with high surface area such as Al2O3,the reaction temperature was increased distinctly [23]."
[5] "In this work, Zr was used to be a dopant to improve the performance of NiO catalyst for ODHE reaction."
[6] "The strong interaction between Ni and Zr was detected in the synthesized catalyst."
[7] "The dopant Zr could enter the NiO lattice and lead to an increase in cell parameter."
[8] "The valence of Ni was increased due to electron transfer through the ZrONi bridge linkage."
[9] "The above two changes are believed to play important roles in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species."
[10] "The active site Ni tends to adsorb O species than non-selective oxygen species O2, which is beneficial for the increase of ethylene selectivity."
[11] "At the same time, ethane conversion was decreased due to the reduced Ni concentration."
[12] "A best yield to ethylene of 40% with 66% selectivity could be obtained over 10% NiZrO catalyst at 430°C."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the dopant zinc (Zr) can enter the nickel oxide (NiO) lattice, leading to an increase in cell parameter and the valence of nickel. This results in lessened reducibility and altered distribution of adsorbed oxygen species, which benefits ethylene selectivity. However, the decreased nickel concentration reduces ethane conversion. The best yield to ethylene is achieved with a 10% NiZrO catalyst at 430°C, resulting in 40% ethylene yield and 66% selectivity. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the detailed mechanisms of electron transfer and oxygen species distribution, optimizing the dopant concentration and lattice structure, and minimizing unwanted side reactions while maintaining high conversion rates.

在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成会影响其电子结构和催化性能。具体而言，掺杂锌（Zr）可以进入镍氧化物（NiO）晶格，导致晶格参数增加和镍的电荷升高。这导致了还原性的减弱和吸附氧物种分布的变化，从而有利于乙烷选择性。然而，镍浓度的降低减少了乙烷转化率。最佳的乙烷转化为40%，在430°C时，通过使用10% NiZrO催化剂，乙烷转化率为66%。在这些催化系统中进行理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战包括理解电子转移和氧物种分布的详细机制，优化掺杂浓度和晶格结构，并最小化不必要的副反应同时保持高转化率。
