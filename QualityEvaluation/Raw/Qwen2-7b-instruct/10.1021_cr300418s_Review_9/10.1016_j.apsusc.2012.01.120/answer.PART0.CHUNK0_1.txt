<p>The strong interaction between Ni and Zr was detected in the synthesized catalyst.</p>
<p>The dopant Zr could enter the NiO lattice and lead to an increase in cell parameter.</p>
<p>The valence of Ni was increased due to electron transfer through the ZrONi bridge linkage.</p>
<p>The above two changes are believed to play important roles in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species.</p>
<p>The active site Ni tends to adsorb O species than non-selective oxygen species O2, which is beneficial for the increase of ethylene selectivity.</p>
<p>At the same time, ethane conversion was decreased due to the reduced Ni concentration.</p>
<p>A best yield to ethylene of 40% with 66% selectivity could be obtained over 10% NiZrO catalyst at 430°C.</p>

1. The synthesis of NiZrO catalysts revealed a strong interaction between nickel and zirconium.
2. Zirconium incorporation into the nickel oxide lattice led to an expansion of the unit cell.
3. The valence of nickel increased due to electron exchange through the ZrONi bridge.
4. These modifications contributed to reduced reducibility and altered oxygen species distribution.
5. The active site of nickel preferred to adsorb oxygen species rather than non-selective oxygen, enhancing ethylene selectivity.
6. Ethane conversion diminished due to a reduced nickel content.
7. The optimal catalyst achieved a 40% ethylene yield with 66% selectivity at 430°C.

1. 合成的NiZrO催化剂显示了镍和锆之间强烈的相互作用。
2. 锆的引入导致镍氧化物晶格的单元格膨胀。
3. 镍的价态因通过ZrONi桥键交换电子而增加。
4. 这些修改有助于减少还原性并改变吸附氧物种的分布。
5. 活性位点的镍倾向于吸附氧物种而非非选择性氧，从而提高了乙二醇选择性。
6. 由于镍含量降低，乙烯转化率下降。
7. 最佳催化剂在430°C时实现了40%的乙烯产率和66%的选择性。
