[1] "The industrial production of ethylene from ethane is by thermal pyrolysis,which is a costly process in energy [1]."
[2] "Many attempts to replace this process by catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation have been carried out."
[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) to ethylene was applied to evaluate catalytic performance of the samples."
[4] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell parameter and the chemical environment of the catalysts,indicating the existence of strong interaction between Ni and Zr."
[5] "The interaction plays an important role in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species,consequently influence their catalytic performance."
[6] "The best yield to ethylene was obtained over the 10% NiZrO catalyst with 60% ethane conversion and 66% ethylene selectivity."
