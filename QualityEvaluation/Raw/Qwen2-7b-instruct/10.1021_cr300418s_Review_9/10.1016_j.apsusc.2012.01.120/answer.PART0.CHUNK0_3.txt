[1] "The strong interaction between Ni and Zr was detected in the synthesized catalyst."
[2] "The dopant Zr could enter the NiO lattice and lead to an increase in cell parameter."
[3] "The valence of Ni was increased due to electron transfer through the ZrONi bridge linkage."
[4] "The above two changes are believed to play important roles in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species."
[5] "The active site Ni tends to adsorb Ospecies than nonselective oxygen species O2, which is beneficial for the increase of ethylene selectivity."
[6] "At the same time, ethane conversion was decreased due to the reduced Ni concentration."
[7] "A best yield to ethylene of 40% with 66% selectivity could be obtained over 10% NiZrO catalyst at 430 C."

1. The synthesis of the catalyst revealed a strong interaction between nickel (Ni) and zirconium (Zr).
2. The introduction of Zr allowed it to incorporate into the NiO lattice, causing an increase in the cell parameter.
3. Through the ZrONi bridge linkage, the valence of Ni was elevated, resulting from electron transfer.
4. These alterations are considered crucial in reducing the catalyst's reducibility and influencing the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species.
5. The active Ni site preferentially binds to oxygen species rather than non-selective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethylene selectivity.
6. The decrease in ethane conversion was observed due to the reduction in Ni concentration.
7. The optimal catalyst, 10% NiZrO, achieved a 40% yield of ethylene with a 66% selectivity at 430°C.

1. 合成催化剂时发现了镍（Ni）和锆（Zr）之间的强烈相互作用。
2. 引入的Zr能够进入NiO晶格，导致晶胞参数的增加。
3. 通过ZrONi桥接键，Ni的电荷得到提升，这是由于电子转移的结果。
4. 这些变化被认为在降低催化剂的还原性以及影响吸附氧物种分布方面起着重要作用。
5. 活性Ni位点倾向于吸附氧物种而非非选择性氧物种，这有利于提高乙二醇的选择性。
6. 由于Ni浓度的降低，乙烷转化率随之下降。
7. 最佳催化剂10% NiZrO在430°C时实现了40%的乙二醇产率和66%的选择性。
