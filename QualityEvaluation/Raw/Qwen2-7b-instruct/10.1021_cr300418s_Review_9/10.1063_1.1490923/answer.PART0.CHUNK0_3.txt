The provided scientific literature does not contain specific information on how the preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it address the key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer based on the given content.
