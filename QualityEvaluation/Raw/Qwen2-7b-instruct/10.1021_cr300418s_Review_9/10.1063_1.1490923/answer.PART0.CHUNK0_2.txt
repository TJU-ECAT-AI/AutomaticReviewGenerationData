The bonding of NO to NiO(100) and Ni x Mg 1-x O(100) surfaces presents a theoretical challenge due to the influence of preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation on the electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel oxide-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Theoretical modeling of these systems is complicated by the intricate interactions between catalysts and reactants. Process optimization demands a thorough understanding of the catalysts' electronic properties, which may be hard to attain through experiments alone. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involves navigating a series of operational parameter trade-offs.
