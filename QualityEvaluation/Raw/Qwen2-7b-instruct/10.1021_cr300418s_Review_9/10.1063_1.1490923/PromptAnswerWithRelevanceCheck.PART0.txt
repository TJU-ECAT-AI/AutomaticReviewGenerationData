The bonding of nitrogen monoxide (NO) to nickel oxide (NiO) surfaces, particularly on the NiO(100) and Ni x Mg 1-x O(100) surfaces, presents a significant challenge for theoretical models. The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly impact their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, including the conversion of ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Theoretical modeling of these catalysts encounters difficulties, necessitating the optimization of processes while balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety.
