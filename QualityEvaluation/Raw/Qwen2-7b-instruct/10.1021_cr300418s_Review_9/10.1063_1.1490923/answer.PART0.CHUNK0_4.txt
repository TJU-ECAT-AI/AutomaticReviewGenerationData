The bonding of NO to NiO(100) and Ni x Mg 1-x O(100) surfaces poses a significant challenge for theoretical modeling due to the influence of preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation on the electronic structure and catalytic performance of nickel oxide-based catalysts. These factors are crucial in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as the conversion of ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in these catalytic systems include achieving optimal theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety.
