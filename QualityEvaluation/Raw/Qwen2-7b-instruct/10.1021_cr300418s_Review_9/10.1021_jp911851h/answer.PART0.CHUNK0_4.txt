[1] "The effect of Fe-doping on the oxygen vacancy energy formation and on the electronic structure of stoichiometric bulk and (001) surface of TiO2 anatase has been studied by means of periodic density functional calculations within the GGA+U approach including spin polarization."
[2] "The presence of Fe causes only a minor perturbation of the atomic structure of anatase."
[3] "The perturbation in the electronic structure is much larger due to the presence of 3d states which results in a high spin state, in agreement with experiment."
[4] "The presence of Fe strongly reduces the oxygen vacancy energy formation, especially at the surface."

The document discusses how iron (Fe) doping affects the oxygen vacancy energy formation and electronic structure in titanium dioxide (TiO2) anatase. The study uses periodic density functional calculations within the GGA+U approach with spin polarization. Fe doping has a minor impact on the atomic structure but significantly alters the electronic structure due to the presence of 3d states, leading to a high spin state that agrees with experimental findings. Importantly, Fe doping notably reduces the energy required to create oxygen vacancies, particularly at the surface, providing additional support for the enhanced catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles supported on Fe-doped TiO2 towards carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation.

该文档研究了铁（Fe）掺杂对钛酸盐TiO2的氧空位能形成和电子结构的影响。使用了包含自旋极化的GGA+U方法进行周期密度泛函计算。Fe掺杂对原子结构影响较小，但因3d状态的存在显著改变了电子结构，导致高自旋状态，与实验结果一致。重要的是，Fe掺杂显著降低了形成氧空位的能量，特别是在表面，为支持Fe掺杂TiO2作为金纳米粒子载体时CO氧化增强催化活性提供了额外且独立的支持。
