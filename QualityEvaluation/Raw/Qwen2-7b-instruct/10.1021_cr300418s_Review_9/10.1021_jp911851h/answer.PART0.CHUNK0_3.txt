[1] "The effect of Fe-doping on the oxygen vacancy energy formation and on the electronic structure of stoichiometric bulk and (001) surface of TiO2 anatase has been studied by means of periodic density functional calculations within the GGA+U approach including spin polarization."
[2] "For the undoped bulk anatase, present calculations are essentially in agreement with previous work, (42) although here we also show that the oxygen vacancy formation is easier at the surface than in the bulk."
[3] "The presence of Fe causes only a minor perturbation of the atomic structure of anatase. However, the perturbation in the electronic structure is much larger due to the presence of 3d states which results in a high spin state, in agreement with experiment."
[4] "This conclusion is likely to be much less dependent on the theoretical method used to describe the electronic structure of these materials and provides additional and independent support to the interpretation of Carrettin et al. (28) for the enhanced catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles supported on Fe-doped TiO2 toward CO oxidation."

The study investigated how iron doping affects the oxygen vacancy energy formation and electronic structure of titanium dioxide anatase, employing periodic density functional calculations within the GGA+U framework. It revealed that oxygen vacancy formation is easier on the surface compared to the bulk. Iron doping leads to a minor alteration of the atomic structure but significantly modifies the electronic structure, aligning with experimental findings. This outcome supports the catalytic enhancement of gold nanoparticles on iron-doped titanium dioxide towards CO oxidation, offering additional independent validation.

研究使用了GGA+U方法，探讨了铁掺杂对钛酸盐体和（001）表面氧空位能形成和电子结构的影响。结果表明，在表面处氧空位形成比在体相中更容易。铁掺杂仅轻微改变原子结构，但显著改变了电子结构，与实验结果一致。这一发现支持了铁掺杂二氧化钛上金纳米颗粒催化CO氧化活性增强的解释，并提供了额外的独立验证。
