[1] "The effect of Fe-doping on the oxygen vacancy energy formation and on the electronic structure of stoichiometric bulk and (001) surface of TiO2 anatase has been studied by means of periodic density functional calculations within the GGA+U approach."
[2] "The presence of Fe causes only a minor perturbation of the atomic structure of anatase but strongly reduces the oxygen vacancy energy formation, especially at the surface."
[3] "The present results provide additional and independent support to the claim that the enhanced catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles supported on Fe-doped TiO2 toward CO oxidation has its origin in the ease to create oxygen vacancies in the support."

The study investigates the impact of iron doping on the oxygen vacancy energy formation and electronic structure of titanium dioxide anatase, employing periodic density functional calculations within the GGA+U framework. Iron doping results in minimal structural alterations but significantly decreases the oxygen vacancy energy formation, particularly at the surface. This finding offers supplementary support to the notion that the improved catalytic performance of gold nanoparticles supported on iron-doped titanium dioxide in carbon monoxide oxidation is attributable to the facilitation of oxygen vacancy creation in the support.

研究使用了GGA+U方法内的周期密度泛函计算，探讨了铁掺杂对钛酸盐体相和（001）表面氧空位能量形成及电子结构的影响。铁掺杂仅引起轻微的结构变化，但显著降低了氧空位的能量形成，特别是在表面。这一结果为以下观点提供了额外的独立支持：在碳氧化物氧化中，以铁掺杂二氧化钛作为支持物的金纳米颗粒表现出增强催化活性的原因在于易于在支持物上产生氧空位。
