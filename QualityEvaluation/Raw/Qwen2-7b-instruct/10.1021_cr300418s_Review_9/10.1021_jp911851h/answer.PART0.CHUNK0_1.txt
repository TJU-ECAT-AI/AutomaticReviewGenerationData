[1] "The effect of Fe-doping on the oxygen vacancy energy formation and on the electronic structure of stoichiometric bulk and (001) surface of TiO2 anatase has been studied by means of periodic density functional calculations within the GGA+U approach including spin polarization."
[2] "The oxygen vacancy energy formation is always lower for the surface than for the bulk."
[3] "The presence of Fe causes only a minor perturbation of the atomic structure of anatase but strongly reduces the oxygen vacancy energy formation, especially at the surface."
[4] "The present results provide additional and independent support to the claim that the enhanced catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles supported on Fe-doped TiO2 toward CO oxidation has its origin in the ease to create oxygen vacancies in the support."
[5] "Formation of oxygen vacancy defects is easier at surfaces than in the bulk."
[6] "Doping with Fe reduces the energy necessary to create an oxygen vacancy in TiO2 by more than 2 eV."
[7] "The Ef obtained for the Fe-TiO2 surface, 0.82 eV, is lower than the values reported for the widely used CeO2, between 1.99 and 2.87 eV, and only slightly higher than the values reported for Ti-, Zr-, or Hf-doped CeO2."

1. The study focused on analyzing how iron doping affects oxygen vacancy formation and the electronic structure of TiO2 anatase, using periodic density functional calculations within the GGA+U approach with spin polarization.
2. Oxygen vacancy energy formation is generally lower on the surface compared to the bulk.
3. Iron doping introduces minimal structural changes to anatase but significantly decreases oxygen vacancy energy formation, particularly on the surface.
4. The findings offer further support to the idea that enhanced catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles on iron-doped titanium dioxide towards CO oxidation is due to the increased ability to generate oxygen vacancies in the support.
5. Oxygen vacancy formation is easier on surfaces than in the bulk of TiO2.
6. Iron doping substantially reduces the energy required to create an oxygen vacancy in TiO2, by over 2 electron volts.
7. The oxygen vacancy formation energy on the iron-doped titanium dioxide surface is 0.82 electron volts, which is lower than the values reported for ceria and slightly higher than those for titanium, zirconium, or hafnium-doped ceria.

1. 研究着重探讨了铁掺杂对钛酸亚钛体和（001）表面氧空位能量形成及电子结构的影响，利用了在自旋极化下的GGA+U方法进行周期密度泛函计算。
2. 氧空位能量形成在表面总是低于体相。
3. 铁掺杂仅对钛酸亚钛结构造成轻微扰动，但显著降低了氧空位能量形成，尤其是在表面。
4. 当前的结果为铁掺杂二氧化钛支持的金纳米颗粒在CO氧化中表现出增强催化活性的理论提供了额外且独立的支持，其根源在于在支撑材料中更容易产生氧空位。
5. 氧空位在表面的形成比在体相中更容易。
6. 铁掺杂显著降低了生成氧空位所需的能量，超过2个电子伏特。
7. 铁掺杂二氧化钛表面的氧空位形成能为0.82电子伏特，这低于常用的铈氧化物的值，并略高于钛、锆或铪掺杂的铈氧化物。
