[1] "The effect of Fe-doping on the oxygen vacancy energy formation and on the electronic structure of stoichiometric bulk and (001) surface of TiO2 anatase has been studied by means of periodic density functional calculations within the GGA+U approach including spin polarization."
[2] "For the undoped bulk anatase, present calculations are essentially in agreement with previous work, (42) although here we also show that the oxygen vacancy formation is easier at the surface than in the bulk."
[3] "In both cases, the ground state results in the reduction of two Ti4+ cations to Ti3+ with two open shells coupled in a high spin state."
[4] "However, the presence of Fe causes only a minor perturbation of the atomic structure of anatase. However, the perturbation in the electronic structure is much larger due to the presence of 3d states which results in a high spin state, in agreement with experiment."
[5] "The presence of Fe strongly reduces the oxygen vacancy energy formation, especially at the surface. This conclusion is likely to be much less dependent on the theoretical method used to describe the electronic structure of these materials and provides additional and independent support to the interpretation of Carrettin et al. (28) for the enhanced catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles supported on Fe-doped TiO2 toward CO oxidation."

The document discusses how iron doping affects the oxygen vacancy energy formation and electronic structure in titanium dioxide anatase, particularly in its bulk and (001) surface forms. The calculations reveal that oxygen vacancy formation is easier at the surface compared to the bulk. Iron doping leads to a high spin state in the electronic structure without significantly altering the atomic structure. Importantly, the presence of iron greatly reduces the energy required to create an oxygen vacancy, especially at the surface. This finding supports the interpretation that enhanced catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles supported on iron-doped titanium dioxide towards carbon monoxide oxidation originates from the increased ease of forming oxygen vacancies in the support.

本文研究了铁掺杂对钛酸亚坦体心立方晶体及其（001）表面中氧空位能量形成和电子结构的影响，通过周期性密度泛函计算方法，在广义梯度近似加U方法下包括自旋极化。结果表明，未掺杂的体心立方钛酸亚坦在表面的氧空位形成比在体内的更易发生。铁掺杂导致电子结构中只有轻微的结构扰动，但3d状态的存在引起了较大的电子结构扰动，从而形成高自旋状态，这与实验结果一致。重要的是，铁的掺杂显著降低了氧空位的形成能，尤其是在表面。这一发现支持了Carrettin等人对于铁掺杂的钛酸亚坦上负载的金纳米粒子催化CO氧化活性增强的原因解释，即通过增加支撑材料中的氧空位浓度来激活氧气。
