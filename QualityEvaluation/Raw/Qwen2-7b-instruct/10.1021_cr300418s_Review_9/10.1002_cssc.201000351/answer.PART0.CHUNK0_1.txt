[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons (ODH) to alkenes is industrially important for various large-volume synthetic polymers."
[2] "The activity of the supported vanadia is highly dependent on the specific oxide support as a result of the so-called strong metal oxidesupport effect."
[3] "Because ODH with molecular oxygen as oxidant is a promising solution, many efforts have been reported."
[4] "In the case of V2O5-loaded samples, no diffractions assigned to any vanadium species were observed by XRD."
[5] "The stabilization of V5+ by highly dispersed ceria and/or CeZrO2 solid solution is also critical for the high stability of the V2O5/CZA."
[6] "Moreover, defect-site-enriched ceria (with the nature of the defects determined by the applied preparation method) has been reported to promote ODEB with N2O."
[7] "This work provides a new route for designing widely used supported vanadia catalysts, and V2O5/CZA is expected to be a promising catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of other alkanes."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The specific oxide support plays a crucial role in determining the activity of the supported vanadia catalysts. Efforts have been made to optimize these processes for various large-volume synthetic polymers. The XRD analysis indicates that no diffractions assigned to vanadium species were observed in the V2O5-loaded samples, suggesting that the dispersion of vanadium species affects the catalytic activity. The stabilization of V5+ by ceria and CeZrO2 solid solution contributes to the high stability of the catalyst. Defect-site-enriched ceria, depending on the preparation method, promotes oxidative dehydrogenation reactions with N2O. The designed catalyst, V2O5/CZA, is anticipated to be effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of other alkanes.
