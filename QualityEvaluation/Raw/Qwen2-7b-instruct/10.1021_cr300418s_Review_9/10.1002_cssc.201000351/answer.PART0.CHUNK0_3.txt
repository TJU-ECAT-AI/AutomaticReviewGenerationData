<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The preparation method for the Ce0.6Zr0.4O2-Al2O3 involves a modified solgel technique. This method leads to the creation of a highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx stabilized with CeO2 and/or CeZrO2 solid solution, which contributes to the catalyst's high activity. Additionally, defect-site-enriched ceria, prepared through a specific method, enhances the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. The modification of the solgel method plays a crucial role in achieving the desired dispersion and stability of the catalyst components, thereby influencing its electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
