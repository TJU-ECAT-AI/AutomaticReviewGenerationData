[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons (ODH) to alkenes is industrially important for various large-volume synthetic polymers."
[2] "Because ODH with molecular oxygen as oxidant is a promising solution, many efforts have been reported."
[3] "To overcome safety problems that result from mixing oxygen and light hydrocarbons, a novel idea to remove the dehydrogenation product of hydrogen by using reducible lattice oxygen was proposed."
[4] "Alternatively, ODH using CO2, being a soft oxidant without the problem of deep oxidation, is very attractive because it may open up new directions for oxidation reactions,6 and create a new route for ODH."
[5] "Herein, we report a highly active and stable catalyst, V2O5/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2-Al2O3, for CO2-ODEB."
[6] "The Ce0.6Zr0.4O2-Al2O3 is prepared by a modified solgel method."
[7] "We determine that highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx stabilized with CeO2 and/or CeZrO2 solid solution is responsible for the high activity of the catalyst."
[8] "Moreover, defect-site-enriched ceria (with the nature of the defects determined by the applied preparation method) has been reported to promote ODEB with N2O."
[9] "The TOF of the supported vanadia catalysts was clearly higher than that of the Ce0.6Zr0.4O2, by over one order of magnitude, indicating the high catalytic activity of the supported vanadia towards CO2-ODEB."
[10] "The stabilization of V5+ by highly dispersed ceria and/or CeZrO2 solid solution is also critical for the high stability of the V2O5/CZA."
[11] "Although the stabilization of V5+ by ceria is very important for the high stability of V2O5/CZA, there must be additional factors, considering the stable performance of the V2O5/Al2O3."
[12] "In recent years, different forms of carbon have been revealed to be active catalysts for the ODH reactions."
[13] "To reveal the effect of the coke deposition on the stability of the catalyst, the coke contents of the catalysts after 10h TOS were determined by thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TGDSC) analysis."
[14] "R dramatically decreased with the increase in the coke content of the catalyst."
