This study reports on a highly active and stable catalyst, V2O5/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2-Al2O3, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with carbon dioxide. The catalyst features highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx stabilized with CeO2 and/or CeZrO2 solid solution, which contributes to its high activity. The stabilization of V5+ by the aforementioned ceria and/or CeZrO2 solid solution is crucial for the catalyst's high stability. Over a long-term experiment, the catalyst maintained a stable ethylbenzene conversion, even after 48 hours of operation. The stability of the catalyst is further influenced by the amount of vanadia loading, with higher loadings showing more pronounced decreases in conversion with increasing time-on-stream.

本研究报道了一种高效稳定的催化剂，V2O5/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2-Al2O3，用于以二氧化碳为氧化剂的乙苯氧化脱氢反应。该催化剂含有高度分散的二维VOx，通过稳定CeO2和/或CeZrO2固溶体，其高活性得以体现。高度分散的CeO2和/或CeZrO2固溶体对催化剂的高稳定性至关重要。在长期实验中，催化剂在48小时运行后仍能保持稳定的乙苯转化率。催化剂的稳定性还受到负载的钒含量的影响，较高的负载量显示出更显著的转化率随时间增加而下降的趋势。
