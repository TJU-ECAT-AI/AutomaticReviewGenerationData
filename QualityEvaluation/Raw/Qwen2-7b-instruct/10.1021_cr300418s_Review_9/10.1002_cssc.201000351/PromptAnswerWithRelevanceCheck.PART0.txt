This study reports on a highly active and stable catalyst, V2O5/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2-Al2O3, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with carbon dioxide. The catalyst features highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx stabilized with CeO2 and/or CeZrO2 solid solution, which contributes to its high activity. The stabilization of V5+ by the aforementioned ceria and/or CeZrO2 solid solution is crucial for the catalyst's high stability. Over a long-term experiment, the catalyst maintained a stable ethylbenzene conversion, even after 48 hours of operation. The stability of the catalyst is further influenced by the amount of vanadia loading, with higher loadings showing more pronounced decreases in conversion with increasing time-on-stream.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The specific oxide support plays a crucial role in determining the activity of the supported vanadia catalysts. Efforts have been made to optimize these processes for various large-volume synthetic polymers. The XRD analysis indicates that no diffractions assigned to vanadium species were observed in the V2O5-loaded samples, suggesting that the dispersion of vanadium species affects the catalytic activity. The stabilization of V5+ by ceria and CeZrO2 solid solution contributes to the high stability of the catalyst. Defect-site-enriched ceria, depending on the preparation method, promotes oxidative dehydrogenation reactions with N2O. The designed catalyst, V2O5/CZA, is anticipated to be effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of other alkanes.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, specifically ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The high activity and stability of the catalyst are attributed to the dispersion of vanadium species stabilized with ceria and/or ceria-zirconia solid solution, along with the presence of deposited carbonaceous materials. The redox mechanism involving the recycling of vanadium and cerium ions contributes to the high catalytic activity. The stabilization of the vanadium(V) state by the ceria and ceria-zirconia solid solution is crucial for the catalyst's stability. The facile recycling between vanadium(V) and vanadium(IV) ions, facilitated by the dispersion of the ions, is essential for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The deposition of carbon on the catalyst enhances its stability during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with carbon dioxide. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly in optimizing the theoretical models and experimental processes.
