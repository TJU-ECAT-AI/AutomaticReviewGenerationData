[1] "Highly dispersed two-dimensional VOx stabilized with CeO2 and/or CeZrO2 solid solution is responsible for the high activity of the catalyst."
[2] "Both the stabilized vanadium species and the deposited carbonaceous materials are, for the first time, revealed to be main factors for its high stability."
[3] "In the case of V2O5-loaded samples, no diffractions assigned to any vanadium species were observed by XRD."
[4] "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, together with diffuse selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Figure2a), revealed a very low degree of crystallization for the 6wt% V2O5/CZA."
[5] "The redox mechanism given in Scheme1 is responsible for the high activity of the V2O5/CZA."
[6] "The stabilization of V5+ by highly dispersed ceria and/or CeZrO2 solid solution is also critical for the high stability of the V2O5/CZA."
[7] "The claim is also supported by the much higher activity of the 6wt% V2O5/CZA sample compared to the 6wt% V2O5/Al2O3 sample."
[8] "Accordingly, as shown in Scheme1, the activity for the CO2-ODEB over the V2O5/CZA is enhanced by the stabilization of highly dispersed V5+ by the 2D ceria and/or solid solution of CeZrO2."
[9] "This is in agreement with a result obtained for the oxidation of methanol over supported vanadia, in which the specific catalytic activity originated from a ligand effect of the different support cations, that is, the VOS bond."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, specifically ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. The high activity and stability of the catalyst are attributed to the dispersion of vanadium species stabilized with ceria and/or ceria-zirconia solid solution, along with the presence of deposited carbonaceous materials. The redox mechanism involving the recycling of vanadium and cerium ions contributes to the high catalytic activity. The stabilization of the vanadium(V) state by the ceria and ceria-zirconia solid solution is crucial for the catalyst's stability. The facile recycling between vanadium(V) and vanadium(IV) ions, facilitated by the dispersion of the ions, is essential for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The deposition of carbon on the catalyst enhances its stability during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with carbon dioxide. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly in optimizing the theoretical models and experimental processes.
