[1] "The demand of ethylene and propylene as starting materials for the production of chemicals has never been so high and there is a need to develop alternative routes to produce them."

[2] "Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes would be one of the most promising routes if catalysts efficient enough to make the process commercially attractive were found."

[3] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."

[4] "An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% of selectivity to ethylene was obtained for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% of Nb at 350 C with a weight to flow W/F ratio of 0.54 g s mL−1."

[5] "The presence of even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide."

[6] "The results clearly showed that Nb has two main effects at low and high content."

[7] "At high Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectivity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant."

[8] "NiO presents a high surface content of O that makes it a very active but unselective catalyst to oxidize ethane."

[9] "The addition of niobium oxide at the surface of NiO increased the reduction temperature of almost 50 C."

[10] "The stability of the catalytic properties as a function of time has been studied in one hand on the Ni0.93Nb0.07O and Ni0.85Nb0.15O catalysts and in the other one, on the NiO-OA-3/1 and Nb/NiO compounds."

1. There is a growing demand for ethylene and propylene as starting materials for chemical production, necessitating the development of alternative production routes.

2. Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is among the most promising methods for producing ethylene and propylene, provided the catalysts are efficient enough to make the process commercially viable.

3. Nickel-niobium oxide (NiNbO) catalysts have been explored for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.

4. Optimal ethane conversion of 33% with 78% selectivity to ethylene was achieved using a NiNbO catalyst with 15% Nb content at 350°C and a weight-to-flow ratio of 0.54 g s mL−1.

5. Even small amounts of niobium significantly increased ethane conversion compared to pure nickel oxide.

6. The catalyst's performance had two main effects based on the niobium content.

7. At high niobium content, the apparent activation energy, selectivity to ethylene, and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained relatively constant.

8. Nickel oxide (NiO) is an active but unselective catalyst for the oxidation of ethane due to its high surface oxygen content.

9. Depositing niobium oxide on the surface of nickel oxide increased the catalyst's reduction temperature by nearly 50°C.

10. The catalysts' catalytic properties were studied over time, revealing a continuous decrease in activity.
