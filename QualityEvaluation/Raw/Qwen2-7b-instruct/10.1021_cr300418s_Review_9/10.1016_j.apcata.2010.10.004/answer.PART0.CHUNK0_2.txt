[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
[2] "An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% of selectivity to ethylene was obtained for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% of Nb at 350 C with a weight to flow W/F ratio of 0.54 g s mL1."
[3] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."
[4] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."
[5] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation."
[6] "This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature."
[7] "It is however not possible to ascertain if Nb could have a specific catalytic role by itself besides contributing to the reduction of the number of active sites and their site isolation."
[8] "What is important to note is that it appears difficult to avoid the formation of NiNb2O6 since it is the thermodynamic stable phase at 380 C and that a treatment under oxygen at 450 C do not allow to re-establish the oxygen over-stoichiometry."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the addition of niobium oxide (NbO) to nickel oxide (NiO) catalysts can reduce the amount of accessible oxygen species, leading to an increase in selectivity for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene. The key challenge in theoretical modeling is understanding how these modifications affect the electronic structure and catalytic sites. Process optimization involves balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety, particularly in managing the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO, which affects the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The formation of the thermodynamically stable phase NiNb2O6 is a significant challenge that impacts the catalyst's stability over time.

在氧化脱氢反应中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成影响其电子结构和催化性能。具体而言，向镍氧化物（NiO）催化剂中添加铌氧化物（NbO）可以减少可访问的氧物种数量，从而提高乙烷氧化脱氢至乙烯的选择性。理论建模的关键挑战是理解这些修改如何影响电子结构和催化位点。过程优化涉及平衡效率、选择性和安全性，特别是在管理NiO的氧过量系数方面，这直接影响催化剂的活性和选择性。NiNb2O6相的形成是一个重大挑战，它影响催化剂随时间的稳定性。
