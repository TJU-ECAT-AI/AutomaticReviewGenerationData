1. The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Doping with niobium reduces the oxygen over-stoichiometry on the surface of nickel oxide, leading to higher selectivity for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The key challenges in theoretical modeling involve accurately predicting the electronic properties and interactions within the catalyst. Process optimization focuses on maximizing efficiency and selectivity while maintaining safety. Balancing these factors requires careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst composition.

[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
[2] "An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% of selectivity to ethylene was obtained for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% of Nb at 350 C with a weight to flow W/F ratio of 0.54 g s mL1."
[3] "It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors."
[4] "Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6."
[5] "The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation."
[6] "This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature."
[7] "It is however not possible to ascertain if Nb could have a specific catalytic role by itself besides contributing to the reduction of the number of active sites and their site isolation."
[8] "What is important to note is that it appears difficult to avoid the formation of NiNb2O6 since it is the thermodynamic stable phase at 380 C and that a treatment under oxygen at 450 C do not allow to re-establish the oxygen over-stoichiometry."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the addition of niobium oxide (NbO) to nickel oxide (NiO) catalysts can reduce the amount of accessible oxygen species, leading to an increase in selectivity for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene. The key challenge in theoretical modeling is understanding how these modifications affect the electronic structure and catalytic sites. Process optimization involves balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety, particularly in managing the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO, which affects the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The formation of the thermodynamically stable phase NiNb2O6 is a significant challenge that impacts the catalyst's stability over time.

[2] "The addition of niobium has two main effects, which are predominant depending upon the Nb loading. At low loading, niobium oxide spreads at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible O. The remain- ing more isolated Ospecies which are active sites turned to be highly selective for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."
[3] "The results obtained show that surface interaction with nio- bium oxide is not the only way to lower the Oconcentration at the surface of NiO but partial reduction with oxalic acid thermally decomposed during preparation, has also to be considered."
[4] "The stability on stream of the catalysts has been studied. A con- tinuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts was observed over various periods of time. These deactivations over time on stream have been explained by the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase and the reduction of the oxygen over- stoichiometry of NiO to a point where no more Oactive species were present at the surface of NiO."

1. The optimal ethane conversion was 33% with 78% selectivity to ethylene using a NiNbO catalyst with 15% Nb at 350°C and a weight to flow ratio of 0.54 g s mL−1. The addition of niobium to the catalyst affects its electronic structure and catalytic performance, particularly at low concentrations, by spreading at the surface of the NiO phase and reducing the accessible oxygen species. This results in higher selectivity for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

2. The addition of niobium oxide to the nickel oxide catalyst is not the sole mechanism for lowering the oxygen concentration at the surface of NiO. Partial reduction of NiO with oxalic acid during preparation also contributes to this effect.

3. The stability of the NiNbO catalysts decreases over time due to the formation of the thermodynamically stable phase NiNb2O6 and the reduction of the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO. This results in a decrease in active oxygen species on the surface of NiO, leading to a decrease in activity.

4. A treatment at 450°C for 30 minutes in air does not regenerate the catalysts, suggesting that regenerating these catalysts for industrial application remains a challenge.

1. 最佳的乙烷转化率为33%，乙乙烯选择性为78%，使用含15%铌的NiNbO催化剂在350°C和质量流速比为0.54 g s mL−1下。铌的添加影响催化剂的电子结构和催化性能，尤其是在低浓度下，在镍氧化物相表面扩散并减少可接触的氧物种，导致乙烷氧化脱氢反应的高度选择性。

2. 铌氧化物添加到镍氧化物催化剂中不仅是降低NiO表面氧浓度的唯一方式。部分用准备过程中分解的草酸处理NiO也对这种效应有所贡献。

3. 催化剂的稳定性随时间逐渐下降，这是由于形成了热力学稳定的NiNb2O6相以及NiO上的氧过量减少所导致的。这导致NiO表面活性氧物种数量减少，进而导致活性下降。

4. 在450°C下空气处理30分钟不能使催化剂再生，表明这些催化剂的再生以供工业应用仍然是一个挑战。

[1] "The results of the catalytic testing of the NiNbO catalysts are in good agreement with those published in the literature and similar ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene were observed for the catalysts with similar composition tested in the same conditions [24]."
[2] "The presence of even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide."
[3] "The results clearly showed that Nb has two main effects at low and high content."
[4] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously,which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number."
[5] "At higher Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectiv- ity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant."
[6] "The increase in the specific surface area that leads to the optimal ethylene yield for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound may be explained by an effect already reported in the literature and called mutual protective effect [31]."
[7] "Although this effect is not fully understood, it has been proposed that it could take place already upon co-precipitation when mixed oxalates were formed."
[8] "The stability of the NiNbO catalysts had been studied by Lemonidou and coworker for 24 h on stream at 350 C [2]. Because it constituted a crucial parameter for a possible industrial develop- ment of these catalysts, we have pursued this study by testing the catalysts over a much longer period of time and at a temperature where the catalysts may present conversions with potential inter- est namely 380 C."
[9] "First it has been observed that all the catalysts studied were undergoing a deactivation after more or less time."
[10] "The deactivation process may be explain by the fact that contrarily to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extraction work from such surface is favored [32,35]."
