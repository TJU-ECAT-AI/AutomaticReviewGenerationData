1. The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Doping with niobium reduces the oxygen over-stoichiometry on the surface of nickel oxide, leading to higher selectivity for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The key challenges in theoretical modeling involve accurately predicting the electronic properties and interactions within the catalyst. Process optimization focuses on maximizing efficiency and selectivity while maintaining safety. Balancing these factors requires careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst composition.
