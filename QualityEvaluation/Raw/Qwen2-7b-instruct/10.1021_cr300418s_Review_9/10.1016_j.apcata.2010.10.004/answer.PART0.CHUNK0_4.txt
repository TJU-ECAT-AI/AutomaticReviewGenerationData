[1] "The results of the catalytic testing of the NiNbO catalysts are in good agreement with those published in the literature and similar ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene were observed for the catalysts with similar composition tested in the same conditions [24]."
[2] "The presence of even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide."
[3] "The results clearly showed that Nb has two main effects at low and high content."
[4] "At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously,which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number."
[5] "At higher Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectiv- ity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant."
[6] "The increase in the specific surface area that leads to the optimal ethylene yield for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound may be explained by an effect already reported in the literature and called mutual protective effect [31]."
[7] "Although this effect is not fully understood, it has been proposed that it could take place already upon co-precipitation when mixed oxalates were formed."
[8] "The stability of the NiNbO catalysts had been studied by Lemonidou and coworker for 24 h on stream at 350 C [2]. Because it constituted a crucial parameter for a possible industrial develop- ment of these catalysts, we have pursued this study by testing the catalysts over a much longer period of time and at a temperature where the catalysts may present conversions with potential inter- est namely 380 C."
[9] "First it has been observed that all the catalysts studied were undergoing a deactivation after more or less time."
[10] "The deactivation process may be explain by the fact that contrarily to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extraction work from such surface is favored [32,35]."

1. The catalytic testing results of NiNbO catalysts align with previous literature, showcasing similar ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity.

2. Even minimal amounts of Nb significantly enhance conversion rates compared to pure nickel oxide.

3. Nb impacts NiNbO catalysts in two primary ways, depending on its concentration.

4. At low Nb contents (up to 37%), the catalysts' activation energy and intrinsic ethane conversion rate decline, suggesting changes in the active sites.

5. At higher Nb contents, the catalysts' activation energy, ethylene selectivity, and intrinsic ethane conversion rate stay constant.

6. The increase in specific surface area for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound can be attributed to a mutual protective effect that prevents crystallization or growth of NiO particles.

7. This effect might occur during the co-precipitation of mixed oxalates.

8. The catalysts' stability was initially examined by Lemonidou et al. at 350 C for 24 hours. To explore practical industrial application, longer-term testing was conducted at 380 C.

9. It was noted that all catalysts experienced degradation over time.

10. The catalyst degradation process can be explained by the adsorption of O2 on a surface with an excess of oxygen, which facilitates its extraction, accelerating the deactivation process.

1. NiNbO催化剂的催化测试结果与文献中报道的一致，显示出相似的乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性。

2. 即使少量的Nb也能显著提高与纯镍氧化物相比的转化率。

3. Nb对NiNbO催化剂的影响主要取决于其浓度。

4. 在低Nb含量（最高37%）下，催化剂的活化能和乙烷内转化速率下降，表明活性位点发生了变化。

5. 在较高Nb含量下，催化剂的活化能、乙稀选择性和乙烷内转化速率保持不变。

6. Ni0.85Nb0.15O化合物的特定表面积增加可以归因于一种互保效应，该效应阻止了NiO颗粒的结晶或生长。

7. 这种效应可能在混合氧化物的共沉淀过程中发生。

8. Lemonidou等人最初在350°C条件下进行了24小时的催化剂稳定性测试。为了探索可能的工业应用，进行了更长时间的测试，在380°C条件下进行。

9. 发现所有催化剂均经历了降解。

10. 催化剂降解过程可以通过吸附在氧过剩表面的O2促进其提取来解释，加速了催化剂的降解过程。
