[1] "NiNbO catalysts with various Nb contents (019%) have been studied as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% of selectivity to ethylene was obtained for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% of Nb at 350 C with a weight to flow W/F ratio of 0.54 g s mL−1."
[2] "The addition of niobium has two main effects, which are predominant depending upon the Nb loading. At low loading, niobium oxide spreads at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible O. The remain- ing more isolated Ospecies which are active sites turned to be highly selective for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation."
[3] "The results obtained show that surface interaction with nio- bium oxide is not the only way to lower the Oconcentration at the surface of NiO but partial reduction with oxalic acid thermally decomposed during preparation, has also to be considered."
[4] "The stability on stream of the catalysts has been studied. A con- tinuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts was observed over various periods of time. These deactivations over time on stream have been explained by the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase and the reduction of the oxygen over- stoichiometry of NiO to a point where no more Oactive species were present at the surface of NiO."

1. The optimal ethane conversion was 33% with 78% selectivity to ethylene using a NiNbO catalyst with 15% Nb at 350°C and a weight to flow ratio of 0.54 g s mL−1. The addition of niobium to the catalyst affects its electronic structure and catalytic performance, particularly at low concentrations, by spreading at the surface of the NiO phase and reducing the accessible oxygen species. This results in higher selectivity for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

2. The addition of niobium oxide to the nickel oxide catalyst is not the sole mechanism for lowering the oxygen concentration at the surface of NiO. Partial reduction of NiO with oxalic acid during preparation also contributes to this effect.

3. The stability of the NiNbO catalysts decreases over time due to the formation of the thermodynamically stable phase NiNb2O6 and the reduction of the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO. This results in a decrease in active oxygen species on the surface of NiO, leading to a decrease in activity.

4. A treatment at 450°C for 30 minutes in air does not regenerate the catalysts, suggesting that regenerating these catalysts for industrial application remains a challenge.

1. 最佳的乙烷转化率为33%，乙乙烯选择性为78%，使用含15%铌的NiNbO催化剂在350°C和质量流速比为0.54 g s mL−1下。铌的添加影响催化剂的电子结构和催化性能，尤其是在低浓度下，在镍氧化物相表面扩散并减少可接触的氧物种，导致乙烷氧化脱氢反应的高度选择性。

2. 铌氧化物添加到镍氧化物催化剂中不仅是降低NiO表面氧浓度的唯一方式。部分用准备过程中分解的草酸处理NiO也对这种效应有所贡献。

3. 催化剂的稳定性随时间逐渐下降，这是由于形成了热力学稳定的NiNb2O6相以及NiO上的氧过量减少所导致的。这导致NiO表面活性氧物种数量减少，进而导致活性下降。

4. 在450°C下空气处理30分钟不能使催化剂再生，表明这些催化剂的再生以供工业应用仍然是一个挑战。
