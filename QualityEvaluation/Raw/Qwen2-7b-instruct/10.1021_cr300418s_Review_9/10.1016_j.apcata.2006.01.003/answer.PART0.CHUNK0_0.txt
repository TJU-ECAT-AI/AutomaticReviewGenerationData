[1] "The catalytic behaviour of VOx/Al2O3 for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 depends strongly on the vanadium loading. VOx/Al2O3 at a vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3 exhibits the highest activity as well as reducibility,which may be ascribed to the highly dispersed vanadium species with proper VOx domain size and nonsignificant formation of bulk V2O5 clusters."
[2] "VOx/Al2O3 exhibits higher activity for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 than that in the presence of an inert atmosphere. This result can be attributed to the facts that CO2 can eliminate hydrogen produced during EB dehydrogenation,regain the oxidation state (lattice oxygen) of reduced vanadium species and alleviate the catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Both the deep reduction of the surface vanadium species and the coke deposition contribute to the catalyst deactivation. Coke deposition is directly related to the EB consumption or ST production and cannot be effectively suppressed by CO2, while deep reduction of the surface vanadium species is associated with the vanadium loading and reaction atmosphere."
[4] "In the presence of CO2, the deactivation of VOx/Al2O3 with low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) is mainly ascribed to the coke deposition, while the portion of deactivation due to the deep reduction of the surface vanadium species can be alleviated by CO2 through regaining the oxidation state of the reduced vanadium species. However, for the catalysts with higher vanadium loading (>1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) or reactions in the presence of an inert atmosphere, the deep reduction of vanadium species becomes an important factor in the catalyst deactivation."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene, by affecting the dispersion of vanadium species, the size of vanadium oxide domains, and the formation of bulk vanadium pentoxide clusters. The vanadium loading plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and stability. CO2 enhances the catalytic performance by eliminating hydrogen produced during the reaction, regaining the oxidation state of reduced vanadium species, and alleviating catalyst deactivation. Deep reduction of vanadium species and coke deposition contribute to catalyst deactivation. In the presence of CO2, coke deposition is the primary cause of deactivation for catalysts with low vanadium loading, whereas the deactivation caused by deep reduction of vanadium species can be mitigated by regaining the oxidation state of the reduced vanadium species. For catalysts with higher vanadium loading or reactions in an inert atmosphere, the deep reduction of vanadium species becomes a significant factor in deactivation.

在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成影响其电子结构和催化性能，这主要通过影响钒物种的分散性、钒氧化物相域的大小以及大量钒五氧化物簇的形成。钒负载量对催化剂的活性和稳定性起着决定性作用。二氧化碳能够增强催化性能，通过消除反应过程中产生的氢，恢复还原钒物种的氧化状态，并缓解催化剂失活。二氧化碳的加入可以提高催化效率，尤其是在存在乙苯脱氢反应时。深度还原的钒物种和焦炭沉积是催化剂失活的主要原因。在二氧化碳存在的条件下，对于低钒负载量的催化剂，焦炭沉积是导致失活的主要原因，而由深度还原的钒物种引起的失活可以通过恢复还原钒物种的氧化状态来缓解。对于高钒负载量的催化剂或在惰性气氛下进行反应时，深度还原的钒物种成为催化剂失活的重要因素。
