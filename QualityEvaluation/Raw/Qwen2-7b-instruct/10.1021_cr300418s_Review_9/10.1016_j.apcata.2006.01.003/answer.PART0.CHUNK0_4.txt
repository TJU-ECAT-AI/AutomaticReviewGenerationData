[1] "The catalytic behaviour of VOx/Al2O3 for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 depends strongly on the vanadium loading. VOx/Al2O3 at a vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3 exhibits the highest activity as well as reducibility, which may be ascribed to the highly dispersed vanadium species with proper VOx domain size and nonsignificant formation of bulk V2O5 clusters."
[2] "VOx/Al2O3 exhibits higher activity for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 than that in the presence of an inert atmosphere. This result can be attributed to the facts that CO2 can eliminate hydrogen produced during EB dehydrogenation, regain the oxidation state (lattice oxygen) of reduced vanadium species and alleviate the catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Both the deep reduction of the surface vanadium species and the coke deposition contribute to the catalyst deactivation. Coke deposition is directly related to the EB consumption or ST production and cannot be effectively suppressed by CO2, while deep reduction of the surface vanadium species is associated with the vanadium loading and reaction atmosphere."
[4] "In the presence of CO2, the deactivation of VOx/Al2O3 with low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) is mainly ascribed to the coke deposition, while the portion of deactivation due to the deep reduction of the surface vanadium species can be alleviated by CO2 through regaining the oxidation state of the reduced vanadium species. However, for the catalysts with higher vanadium loading (>1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) or reactions in the presence of an inert atmosphere, the deep reduction of vanadium species becomes an important factor in the catalyst deactivation."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. High vanadium loading leads to the formation of bulk V2O5 clusters, which reduces the activity and stability of the catalyst. CO2 plays a role in alleviating catalyst deactivation by regaining the oxidation state of reduced vanadium species. Deep reduction of the surface vanadium species contributes to catalyst deactivation, particularly at high vanadium loading or in the presence of an inert atmosphere. Coke deposition is directly related to the EB consumption or ST production and cannot be effectively suppressed by CO2. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the complex interactions between dopant concentrations, vacancy formation, and reaction conditions, optimizing the balance between activity and stability, and developing strategies to mitigate deactivation mechanisms such as coke formation and deep reduction of vanadium species.

镍氧化物基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中的催化性能受制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成的影响。高钒含量导致形成大量V2O5簇，从而降低催化剂的活性和稳定性。二氧化碳通过恢复还原态钒物种的氧化状态来缓解催化剂失活。表面钒物种的深度还原是催化剂失活的原因之一，特别是在高钒含量或惰性气氛下。焦炭沉积直接与乙苯消耗或ST生成有关，并且不能有效地被二氧化碳抑制。关键挑战包括理解掺杂浓度、空位形成与反应条件之间的复杂相互作用，优化活性与稳定性的平衡，并开发减少失活机制（如焦炭形成和钒物种深度还原）的策略。
