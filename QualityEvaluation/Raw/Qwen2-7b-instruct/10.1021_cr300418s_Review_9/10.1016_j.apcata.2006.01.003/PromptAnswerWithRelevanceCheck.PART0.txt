[1] "The catalytic behaviour of VOx/Al2O3 for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 depends strongly on the vanadium loading. VOx/Al2O3 at a vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3 exhibits the highest activity as well as reducibility,which may be ascribed to the highly dispersed vanadium species with proper VOx domain size and nonsignificant formation of bulk V2O5 clusters."
[2] "VOx/Al2O3 exhibits higher activity for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 than that in the presence of an inert atmosphere. This result can be attributed to the facts that CO2 can eliminate hydrogen produced during EB dehydrogenation,regain the oxidation state (lattice oxygen) of reduced vanadium species and alleviate the catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Both the deep reduction of the surface vanadium species and the coke deposition contribute to the catalyst deactivation. Coke deposition is directly related to the EB consumption or ST production and cannot be effectively suppressed by CO2, while deep reduction of the surface vanadium species is associated with the vanadium loading and reaction atmosphere."
[4] "In the presence of CO2, the deactivation of VOx/Al2O3 with low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) is mainly ascribed to the coke deposition, while the portion of deactivation due to the deep reduction of the surface vanadium species can be alleviated by CO2 through regaining the oxidation state of the reduced vanadium species. However, for the catalysts with higher vanadium loading (>1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) or reactions in the presence of an inert atmosphere, the deep reduction of vanadium species becomes an important factor in the catalyst deactivation."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene, by affecting the dispersion of vanadium species, the size of vanadium oxide domains, and the formation of bulk vanadium pentoxide clusters. The vanadium loading plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and stability. CO2 enhances the catalytic performance by eliminating hydrogen produced during the reaction, regaining the oxidation state of reduced vanadium species, and alleviating catalyst deactivation. Deep reduction of vanadium species and coke deposition contribute to catalyst deactivation. In the presence of CO2, coke deposition is the primary cause of deactivation for catalysts with low vanadium loading, whereas the deactivation caused by deep reduction of vanadium species can be mitigated by regaining the oxidation state of the reduced vanadium species. For catalysts with higher vanadium loading or reactions in an inert atmosphere, the deep reduction of vanadium species becomes a significant factor in deactivation.

在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中，镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成影响其电子结构和催化性能，这主要通过影响钒物种的分散性、钒氧化物相域的大小以及大量钒五氧化物簇的形成。钒负载量对催化剂的活性和稳定性起着决定性作用。二氧化碳能够增强催化性能，通过消除反应过程中产生的氢，恢复还原钒物种的氧化状态，并缓解催化剂失活。二氧化碳的加入可以提高催化效率，尤其是在存在乙苯脱氢反应时。深度还原的钒物种和焦炭沉积是催化剂失活的主要原因。在二氧化碳存在的条件下，对于低钒负载量的催化剂，焦炭沉积是导致失活的主要原因，而由深度还原的钒物种引起的失活可以通过恢复还原钒物种的氧化状态来缓解。对于高钒负载量的催化剂或在惰性气氛下进行反应时，深度还原的钒物种成为催化剂失活的重要因素。

1. The catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene (ST) is highly dependent on the vanadium loading. A vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3 results in the highest activity and reducibility, attributed to the dispersion of vanadium species and the limited formation of bulk vanadia clusters. 
2. The use of CO2 in the EB dehydrogenation process enhances the catalytic activity of VOx/Al2O3 compared to an inert atmosphere. This improvement is due to CO2's ability to remove hydrogen generated during EB dehydrogenation, restore the oxidation state of reduced vanadium species, and mitigate catalyst deactivation.
3. Both coke deposition and the deep reduction of surface vanadium species contribute to catalyst deactivation. Coke formation is directly related to EB consumption or ST production and cannot be effectively inhibited by CO2. In contrast, the deep reduction of vanadium species is influenced by vanadium loading and the reaction atmosphere.
4. In the presence of CO2, catalyst deactivation in VOx/Al2O3 with low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) is primarily caused by coke deposition. The portion of deactivation due to deep vanadium species reduction can be mitigated by regaining the oxidation state of reduced vanadium species through CO2. For catalysts with higher vanadium loading or reactions in an inert atmosphere, deep vanadium reduction becomes a critical factor in deactivation.

1. 针对乙苯（EB）氧化脱氢生成苯乙烯（ST）的催化性能，VOx/Al2O3催化剂的活性和可还原性高度依赖于钒载量。当钒载量为1.5 mmol/g Al2O3时，表现出最高活性和最佳可还原性，这是由于分散的钒物种以及少量形成块状钒化物所致。
2. 在使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的情况下，VOx/Al2O3在乙苯脱氢过程中的催化活性高于惰性气氛。这种改善归因于二氧化碳能够消除生成的氢，恢复还原的钒物种的氧化状态，并缓解催化剂失活。
3. 催化剂失活的原因包括焦炭沉积和表面钒物种的深度还原。焦炭的形成直接与乙苯消耗或苯乙烯产量有关，并且不能有效抑制二氧化碳。相反，深度还原的钒物种与钒载量和反应气氛相关。
4. 在二氧化碳存在下，对于低钒载量（1.50 mmol/g Al2O3）的VOx/Al2O3催化剂，主要的失活原因是焦炭沉积。通过二氧化碳恢复还原的钒物种的氧化状态，可以减轻由深度还原导致的部分失活。而对于高钒载量的催化剂或在惰性气氛下的反应，深度还原的钒物种成为催化剂失活的关键因素。

1. The catalytic activity and reducibility of vanadium oxide/Al2O3 catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide are highly dependent on the vanadium loading. At a vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3, the catalysts exhibit the highest activity and reducibility, likely due to the dispersion of vanadium species with appropriate vanadium oxide domain sizes and minimal formation of bulk vanadium pentoxide clusters.

2. The catalysts show higher activity for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide compared to an inert nitrogen atmosphere. This can be attributed to the ability of carbon dioxide to remove hydrogen generated during the dehydrogenation process, recover the oxidation state of reduced vanadium species, and mitigate catalyst deactivation.

3. Both the deep reduction of surface vanadium species and coke deposition contribute to catalyst deactivation. Coke deposition is directly linked to ethylbenzene consumption or styrene production and cannot be effectively suppressed by carbon dioxide. Deep reduction of the surface vanadium species is associated with vanadium loading and the reaction atmosphere.

4. In the presence of carbon dioxide, the deactivation of catalysts with a low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) is primarily attributed to coke deposition, while the portion of deactivation due to the deep reduction of surface vanadium species can be mitigated by carbon dioxide through regaining the oxidation state of the reduced vanadium species. For catalysts with higher vanadium loading or reactions in an inert atmosphere, deep reduction of vanadium species becomes a significant factor in catalyst deactivation.

1. 对于在二氧化碳存在的条件下，氧化铝支持的钒氧化物催化剂的乙苯脱氢反应的催化活性和可还原性高度依赖于钒的负载量。在1.5 mmol/g Al2O3的负载量下，催化剂显示出最高的活性和可还原性，这可能归因于分散的钒物种与适当的钒氧化物域大小以及形成大量五氧化二钒的少量。

2. 催化剂在二氧化碳存在的条件下对乙苯脱氢的活性高于氮气气氛。这可以归因于二氧化碳能够去除生成的氢，恢复减少的钒物种的氧化状态，并减轻催化剂失活。

3. 表面钒物种的深还原和焦炭沉积都导致催化剂失活。焦炭沉积直接与乙苯消耗或苯乙烯产生有关，且不能被二氧化碳有效地抑制。表面钒物种的深还原与钒负载量和反应气氛相关。

4. 在二氧化碳存在的情况下，低钒负载（1.50 mmol/g Al2O3）的催化剂主要由焦炭沉积导致失活，而由于深还原表面钒物种所导致的部分失活可以通过二氧化碳通过恢复减少的钒物种的氧化状态来缓解。对于更高钒负载的催化剂或在惰性气氛中的反应，表面钒物种的深还原成为催化剂失活的重要因素。

[2] "The catalytic activity of VOx/Al2O3 exhibits the same trend as the reducibility with the change in the vanadium loading. The catalyst at a vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3 exhibits the highest activity as well as the reducibility, which may be ascribed to the highly dispersed vanadium species with proper VOx domain size and negligible amounts of bulk V2O5 clusters."
[3] "In the presence of CO2, the equilibrium conversion can be improved through the reaction coupling of EB dehydrogenation with the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS), which provides the thermodynamic driving force to achieve higher EB conversion; VOx/Al2O3 as catalyst may promote the activation of EB and/or CO2 and realize the reaction coupling."
[4] "The catalyst VOx/Al2O3 with a low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) includes highly dispersed surface vanadium species with proper redox properties; for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, CO2 as a weak oxidant can regain the oxidation state (lattice oxygen) of the reduced vanadium species and then alleviate this portion of catalyst deactivation due to the deep reduction of the surface vanadium species."

1. The catalytic behavior of VOx/Al2O3 for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is significantly influenced by the vanadium loading. A vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3 leads to the highest activity and reducibility due to the dispersion of vanadium species and the absence of significant bulk V2O5 clusters. The catalyst's reducibility follows a similar pattern to the change in vanadium loading.

2. The catalytic activity of VOx/Al2O3 correlates with its reducibility. The catalyst with a vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3 demonstrates the highest activity and reducibility, attributable to the dispersion of vanadium species and the absence of substantial bulk V2O5 clusters.

3. In the presence of CO2, the conversion efficiency can be enhanced through the coupling of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with reverse water-gas shift (RWGS), providing thermodynamic drive for higher ethylbenzene conversion. VOx/Al2O3 acts as a catalyst to facilitate the activation of ethylbenzene and/or CO2, achieving the reaction coupling.

4. A catalyst with a low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) possesses highly dispersed surface vanadium species with appropriate redox properties. In the presence of CO2, CO2 as a weak oxidant regains the lattice oxygen of reduced vanadium species, mitigating the catalyst deactivation caused by the deep reduction of surface vanadium species.

5. Deep reduction of surface vanadium species is another cause of catalyst deactivation, linked to vanadium loading and reaction atmosphere. A catalyst with a low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) has highly dispersed surface vanadium species with suitable redox properties. In the presence of CO2, CO2 as a weak oxidant regains the lattice oxygen of reduced vanadium species, alleviating the catalyst deactivation resulting from deep reduction of surface vanadium species.

1. VOx/Al2O3催化剂在乙苯脱氢过程中，CO2的存在对其催化性能影响显著，主要由钒负载量决定。当钒负载为1.5 mmol/g Al2O3时，表现出最高活性和可还原性，这归因于钒物种的高度分散以及不存在大量块状V2O5簇。催化剂的可还原性与钒负载量变化保持一致。

2. VOx/Al2O3催化剂的活性与其可还原性相匹配。当钒负载为1.5 mmol/g Al2O3时，展现出最高活性和可还原性，这是由于高度分散的钒物种和不存在大量块状V2O5簇所致。

3. 在CO2存在下，通过乙苯脱氢与逆向水煤气变换（RWGS）反应耦合可以提高转化效率，提供更高的乙苯转化热力学驱动力。作为催化剂，VOx/Al2O3能够促进乙苯和/或CO2的活化，实现反应耦合。

4. 当钒负载较低（1.50 mmol/g Al2O3）时，催化剂表面具有高度分散的、具有适当氧化还原性质的钒物种。在CO2存在下，CO2作为弱氧化剂能够回收还原态钒物种的晶格氧，缓解由表面钒物种深度还原导致的催化剂失活。

5. 表面钒物种的深度还原是催化剂失活的另一个原因，与钒负载和反应气氛相关联。当钒负载较低（1.50 mmol/g Al2O3）时，催化剂表面具有高度分散的、具有适当氧化还原性质的钒物种。在CO2存在下，CO2作为弱氧化剂能够回收还原态钒物种的晶格氧，缓解由表面钒物种深度还原导致的催化剂失活。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. High vanadium loading leads to the formation of bulk V2O5 clusters, which reduces the activity and stability of the catalyst. CO2 plays a role in alleviating catalyst deactivation by regaining the oxidation state of reduced vanadium species. Deep reduction of the surface vanadium species contributes to catalyst deactivation, particularly at high vanadium loading or in the presence of an inert atmosphere. Coke deposition is directly related to the EB consumption or ST production and cannot be effectively suppressed by CO2. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the complex interactions between dopant concentrations, vacancy formation, and reaction conditions, optimizing the balance between activity and stability, and developing strategies to mitigate deactivation mechanisms such as coke formation and deep reduction of vanadium species.
