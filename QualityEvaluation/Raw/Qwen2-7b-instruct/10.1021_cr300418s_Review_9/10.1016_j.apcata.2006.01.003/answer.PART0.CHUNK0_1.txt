[1] "The catalytic behaviour of VOx/Al2O3 for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 depends strongly on the vanadium loading. VOx/Al2O3 at a vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3 exhibits the highest activity as well as reducibility, which may be ascribed to the highly dispersed vanadium species with proper VOx domain size and nonsignificant formation of bulk V2O5 clusters."
[2] "VOx/Al2O3 exhibits higher activity for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 than that in the presence of an inert atmosphere. This result can be attributed to the facts that CO2 can eliminate hydrogen produced during EB dehydrogenation, regain the oxidation state (lattice oxygen) of reduced vanadium species and alleviate the catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Both the deep reduction of the surface vanadium species and the coke deposition contribute to the catalyst deactivation. Coke deposition is directly related to the EB consumption or ST production and cannot be effectively suppressed by CO2, while deep reduction of the surface vanadium species is associated with the vanadium loading and reaction atmosphere."
[4] "In the presence of CO2, the deactivation of VOx/Al2O3 with low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) is mainly ascribed to the coke deposition, while the portion of deactivation due to the deep reduction of the surface vanadium species can be alleviated by CO2 through regaining the oxidation state of the reduced vanadium species. However, for the catalysts with higher vanadium loading (>1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) or reactions in the presence of an inert atmosphere, the deep reduction of vanadium species becomes an important factor in the catalyst deactivation."

1. The catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene (ST) is highly dependent on the vanadium loading. A vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3 results in the highest activity and reducibility, attributed to the dispersion of vanadium species and the limited formation of bulk vanadia clusters. 
2. The use of CO2 in the EB dehydrogenation process enhances the catalytic activity of VOx/Al2O3 compared to an inert atmosphere. This improvement is due to CO2's ability to remove hydrogen generated during EB dehydrogenation, restore the oxidation state of reduced vanadium species, and mitigate catalyst deactivation.
3. Both coke deposition and the deep reduction of surface vanadium species contribute to catalyst deactivation. Coke formation is directly related to EB consumption or ST production and cannot be effectively inhibited by CO2. In contrast, the deep reduction of vanadium species is influenced by vanadium loading and the reaction atmosphere.
4. In the presence of CO2, catalyst deactivation in VOx/Al2O3 with low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) is primarily caused by coke deposition. The portion of deactivation due to deep vanadium species reduction can be mitigated by regaining the oxidation state of reduced vanadium species through CO2. For catalysts with higher vanadium loading or reactions in an inert atmosphere, deep vanadium reduction becomes a critical factor in deactivation.

1. 针对乙苯（EB）氧化脱氢生成苯乙烯（ST）的催化性能，VOx/Al2O3催化剂的活性和可还原性高度依赖于钒载量。当钒载量为1.5 mmol/g Al2O3时，表现出最高活性和最佳可还原性，这是由于分散的钒物种以及少量形成块状钒化物所致。
2. 在使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的情况下，VOx/Al2O3在乙苯脱氢过程中的催化活性高于惰性气氛。这种改善归因于二氧化碳能够消除生成的氢，恢复还原的钒物种的氧化状态，并缓解催化剂失活。
3. 催化剂失活的原因包括焦炭沉积和表面钒物种的深度还原。焦炭的形成直接与乙苯消耗或苯乙烯产量有关，并且不能有效抑制二氧化碳。相反，深度还原的钒物种与钒载量和反应气氛相关。
4. 在二氧化碳存在下，对于低钒载量（1.50 mmol/g Al2O3）的VOx/Al2O3催化剂，主要的失活原因是焦炭沉积。通过二氧化碳恢复还原的钒物种的氧化状态，可以减轻由深度还原导致的部分失活。而对于高钒载量的催化剂或在惰性气氛下的反应，深度还原的钒物种成为催化剂失活的关键因素。
