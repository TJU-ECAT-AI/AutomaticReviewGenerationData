[1] "The catalytic behaviour of VOx/Al2O3 for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 depends strongly on the vanadium loading. VOx/Al2O3 at a vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3 exhibits the highest activity as well as reducibility,which may be ascribed to the highly dispersed vanadium species with proper VOx domain size and nonsignificant formation of bulk V2O5 clusters."
[2] "The catalytic activity of VOx/Al2O3 exhibits the same trend as the reducibility with the change in the vanadium loading. The catalyst at a vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3 exhibits the highest activity as well as the reducibility, which may be ascribed to the highly dispersed vanadium species with proper VOx domain size and negligible amounts of bulk V2O5 clusters."
[3] "In the presence of CO2, the equilibrium conversion can be improved through the reaction coupling of EB dehydrogenation with the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS), which provides the thermodynamic driving force to achieve higher EB conversion; VOx/Al2O3 as catalyst may promote the activation of EB and/or CO2 and realize the reaction coupling."
[4] "The catalyst VOx/Al2O3 with a low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) includes highly dispersed surface vanadium species with proper redox properties; for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, CO2 as a weak oxidant can regain the oxidation state (lattice oxygen) of the reduced vanadium species and then alleviate this portion of catalyst deactivation due to the deep reduction of the surface vanadium species."
[5] "Deep reduction of the surface vanadium species is another cause of the catalyst deactivation, which is actually associated with the vanadium loading and the reaction atmosphere. The catalyst VOx/Al2O3 with a low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) includes highly dispersed surface vanadium species with proper redox properties; for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, CO2 as a weak oxidant can regain the oxidation state (lattice oxygen) of the reduced vanadium species and then alleviate this portion of catalyst deactivation due to the deep reduction of the surface vanadium species."

1. The catalytic behavior of VOx/Al2O3 for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is significantly influenced by the vanadium loading. A vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3 leads to the highest activity and reducibility due to the dispersion of vanadium species and the absence of significant bulk V2O5 clusters. The catalyst's reducibility follows a similar pattern to the change in vanadium loading.

2. The catalytic activity of VOx/Al2O3 correlates with its reducibility. The catalyst with a vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3 demonstrates the highest activity and reducibility, attributable to the dispersion of vanadium species and the absence of substantial bulk V2O5 clusters.

3. In the presence of CO2, the conversion efficiency can be enhanced through the coupling of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with reverse water-gas shift (RWGS), providing thermodynamic drive for higher ethylbenzene conversion. VOx/Al2O3 acts as a catalyst to facilitate the activation of ethylbenzene and/or CO2, achieving the reaction coupling.

4. A catalyst with a low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) possesses highly dispersed surface vanadium species with appropriate redox properties. In the presence of CO2, CO2 as a weak oxidant regains the lattice oxygen of reduced vanadium species, mitigating the catalyst deactivation caused by the deep reduction of surface vanadium species.

5. Deep reduction of surface vanadium species is another cause of catalyst deactivation, linked to vanadium loading and reaction atmosphere. A catalyst with a low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) has highly dispersed surface vanadium species with suitable redox properties. In the presence of CO2, CO2 as a weak oxidant regains the lattice oxygen of reduced vanadium species, alleviating the catalyst deactivation resulting from deep reduction of surface vanadium species.

1. VOx/Al2O3催化剂在乙苯脱氢过程中，CO2的存在对其催化性能影响显著，主要由钒负载量决定。当钒负载为1.5 mmol/g Al2O3时，表现出最高活性和可还原性，这归因于钒物种的高度分散以及不存在大量块状V2O5簇。催化剂的可还原性与钒负载量变化保持一致。

2. VOx/Al2O3催化剂的活性与其可还原性相匹配。当钒负载为1.5 mmol/g Al2O3时，展现出最高活性和可还原性，这是由于高度分散的钒物种和不存在大量块状V2O5簇所致。

3. 在CO2存在下，通过乙苯脱氢与逆向水煤气变换（RWGS）反应耦合可以提高转化效率，提供更高的乙苯转化热力学驱动力。作为催化剂，VOx/Al2O3能够促进乙苯和/或CO2的活化，实现反应耦合。

4. 当钒负载较低（1.50 mmol/g Al2O3）时，催化剂表面具有高度分散的、具有适当氧化还原性质的钒物种。在CO2存在下，CO2作为弱氧化剂能够回收还原态钒物种的晶格氧，缓解由表面钒物种深度还原导致的催化剂失活。

5. 表面钒物种的深度还原是催化剂失活的另一个原因，与钒负载和反应气氛相关联。当钒负载较低（1.50 mmol/g Al2O3）时，催化剂表面具有高度分散的、具有适当氧化还原性质的钒物种。在CO2存在下，CO2作为弱氧化剂能够回收还原态钒物种的晶格氧，缓解由表面钒物种深度还原导致的催化剂失活。
