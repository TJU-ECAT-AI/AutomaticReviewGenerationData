[1] "The catalytic behaviour of VOx/Al2O3 for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 depends strongly on the vanadium loading. VOx/Al2O3 at a vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3 exhibits the highest activity as well as reducibility, which may be ascribed to the highly dispersed vanadium species with proper VOx domain size and nonsignificant formation of bulk V2O5 clusters."
[2] "VOx/Al2O3 exhibits higher activity for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 than that in the presence of an inert atmosphere. This result can be attributed to the facts that CO2 can eliminate hydrogen produced during EB dehydrogenation, regain the oxidation state (lattice oxygen) of reduced vanadium species and alleviate the catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Both the deep reduction of the surface vanadium species and the coke deposition contribute to the catalyst deactivation. Coke deposition is directly related to the EB consumption or ST production and cannot be effectively suppressed by CO2, while deep reduction of the surface vanadium species is associated with the vanadium loading and reaction atmosphere."
[4] "In the presence of CO2, the deactivation of VOx/Al2O3 with low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) is mainly ascribed to the coke deposition, while the portion of deactivation due to the deep reduction of the surface vanadium species can be alleviated by CO2 through regaining the oxidation state of the reduced vanadium species. However, for the catalysts with higher vanadium loading (>1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) or reactions in the presence of an inert atmosphere, the deep reduction of vanadium species becomes an important factor in the catalyst deactivation."

1. The catalytic activity and reducibility of vanadium oxide/Al2O3 catalysts for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide are highly dependent on the vanadium loading. At a vanadium loading of 1.5 mmol/g Al2O3, the catalysts exhibit the highest activity and reducibility, likely due to the dispersion of vanadium species with appropriate vanadium oxide domain sizes and minimal formation of bulk vanadium pentoxide clusters.

2. The catalysts show higher activity for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide compared to an inert nitrogen atmosphere. This can be attributed to the ability of carbon dioxide to remove hydrogen generated during the dehydrogenation process, recover the oxidation state of reduced vanadium species, and mitigate catalyst deactivation.

3. Both the deep reduction of surface vanadium species and coke deposition contribute to catalyst deactivation. Coke deposition is directly linked to ethylbenzene consumption or styrene production and cannot be effectively suppressed by carbon dioxide. Deep reduction of the surface vanadium species is associated with vanadium loading and the reaction atmosphere.

4. In the presence of carbon dioxide, the deactivation of catalysts with a low vanadium loading (1.50 mmol/g Al2O3) is primarily attributed to coke deposition, while the portion of deactivation due to the deep reduction of surface vanadium species can be mitigated by carbon dioxide through regaining the oxidation state of the reduced vanadium species. For catalysts with higher vanadium loading or reactions in an inert atmosphere, deep reduction of vanadium species becomes a significant factor in catalyst deactivation.

1. 对于在二氧化碳存在的条件下，氧化铝支持的钒氧化物催化剂的乙苯脱氢反应的催化活性和可还原性高度依赖于钒的负载量。在1.5 mmol/g Al2O3的负载量下，催化剂显示出最高的活性和可还原性，这可能归因于分散的钒物种与适当的钒氧化物域大小以及形成大量五氧化二钒的少量。

2. 催化剂在二氧化碳存在的条件下对乙苯脱氢的活性高于氮气气氛。这可以归因于二氧化碳能够去除生成的氢，恢复减少的钒物种的氧化状态，并减轻催化剂失活。

3. 表面钒物种的深还原和焦炭沉积都导致催化剂失活。焦炭沉积直接与乙苯消耗或苯乙烯产生有关，且不能被二氧化碳有效地抑制。表面钒物种的深还原与钒负载量和反应气氛相关。

4. 在二氧化碳存在的情况下，低钒负载（1.50 mmol/g Al2O3）的催化剂主要由焦炭沉积导致失活，而由于深还原表面钒物种所导致的部分失活可以通过二氧化碳通过恢复减少的钒物种的氧化状态来缓解。对于更高钒负载的催化剂或在惰性气氛中的反应，表面钒物种的深还原成为催化剂失活的重要因素。
