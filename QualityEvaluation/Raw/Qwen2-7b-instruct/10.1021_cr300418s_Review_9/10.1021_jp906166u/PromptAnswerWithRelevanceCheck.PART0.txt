The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involve accurately predicting the effects of these factors on the catalyst's electronic structure and activity. The transient response method applied in the study helps understand the reaction behaviors of lattice oxygen in various metal oxides. The redox cycle involving lattice oxygen, particularly in vanadium and iron oxides, is crucial for enhancing catalytic activity in the presence of CO2. Chromium(III) oxide, however, does not undergo reduction during the dehydrogenation process. The study demonstrates that under CO2, the lattice oxygen is supplied partly from CO2, keeping the metal oxides at higher valence states, thus promoting the catalytic activity.

The challenges include accurately modeling the complex interactions between lattice oxygen, metal oxides, and reactants like ethylbenzene and ethane under various reaction conditions. Process optimization requires careful control of parameters such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates to achieve desired product yields and selectivities. Balancing efficiency and selectivity necessitates a deep understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the ability to adjust catalyst properties accordingly. Safety considerations involve managing potential hazards associated with high-temperature processes and the handling of reactive gases like CO2. Overall, addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach combining catalysis theory, materials science, and process engineering expertise.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响其在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能。在这些催化系统中，理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战在于准确预测这些因素对催化剂电子结构和活性的影响。研究中应用瞬态响应方法有助于理解支持上各种金属氧化物的氧层反应行为。范德华和铁氧化物的红ox循环尤其对于CO2存在下提高催化活性至关重要。三价铬氧化物在脱氢过程中不发生还原。研究表明，在CO2下，部分氧层氧从CO2供应，保持金属氧化物处于更高价态，从而促进催化活性。

面临的挑战包括准确建模复杂作用机制，即氧层、金属氧化物和反应物（如乙苯和乙烷）之间的相互作用，在不同反应条件下。过程优化需要精确控制温度、压力和流速等参数以实现所需的产物产率和选择性。平衡效率和选择性需要深入了解反应机制，并相应调整催化剂性质。安全考虑涉及管理高温过程和处理反应性气体（如CO2）的潜在危险。总的来说，解决这些挑战需要跨学科的方法，结合催化理论、材料科学和过程工程的专业知识。

<p>The transient response technique under Ar flow clearly demonstrated that lattice oxygen of V2O5 on O-Dia preferentially reacted with EB to give ST and H2O in the early stages of the reaction.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the reaction carried out under CO2, ST and H2O were formed just after the introduction of EB without any overshoot.</p>
<p>V/AC catalyst showed diffraction peaks of V2O3, since the catalyst was calcined in Ar and CO2 for only a short period.</p>
<p>Formation of H2O was not detected in the reaction under Ar flow.</p>
<p>It was verified that the amount of dispersed Cr2O3 on the surface of AC was not reduced with the dehydrogenation of EB.</p>
<p>On the other hand, on Cr2O3-loaded catalysts, no significant oxygen transfer from the lattice oxygen of Cr2O3 to EB was observed, and consequently no promoting effect of CO2 was observed.</p>

The study investigated the role of lattice oxygen in metal oxides during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene under a carbon dioxide atmosphere. Vanadium oxide-loaded catalysts showed a higher styrene yield under carbon dioxide than under an argon flow, suggesting a promoting effect of carbon dioxide. The transient response method was used to understand the reaction behaviors of lattice oxygen on various metal oxides. The results showed that lattice oxygen of vanadium oxide was consumed in the dehydrogenation reaction and that reduced vanadium oxide was reoxidized with carbon dioxide. A similar redox cycle was observed on iron oxide-loaded activated carbon catalyst. Spectroscopic characterization revealed that vanadium oxide and iron oxide on the support were reduced to a low valence state during the dehydrogenation reaction, and that carbon dioxide could oxidize the reduced metal oxides. In contrast, chromium(III) oxide was not reduced during dehydrogenation. The redox cycle over vanadium oxide- and iron oxide-loaded catalysts was concluded to be an important factor in promoting the catalytic activity with carbon dioxide.

The study focused on the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene using various metal oxides loaded on different supports, with a particular emphasis on the role of lattice oxygen under a CO2 atmosphere. The vanadium oxide-loaded catalysts showed higher styrene yields in CO2 compared to an inert atmosphere. A similar redox cycle was observed on iron oxide-loaded catalysts. Chromium(III) oxide remained unchanged during the dehydrogenation process. The transient response method was utilized to analyze the behavior of lattice oxygen on different metal oxides. The results indicated that the consumption and reoxidation of lattice oxygen played a crucial role in promoting the catalytic activity of the vanadium and iron oxides in the presence of CO2. In contrast, no significant effect of CO2 was observed on chromium oxide-based catalysts.

The study focused on the role of lattice oxygen in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene using metal oxides as catalysts, particularly over vanadium, chromium, and iron oxides supported on various materials. The transient response technique was employed to investigate the reaction dynamics of lattice oxygen in the presence of CO2. It was found that vanadium oxide and iron oxide catalysts showed higher styrene yields under CO2 conditions compared to an inert Ar atmosphere. The redox cycle involving the consumption and subsequent reoxidation of lattice oxygen by CO2 played a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity of these catalysts.

Chromium(III) oxide, however, did not undergo reduction during the dehydrogenation process, suggesting a different mechanism for its catalytic performance. Spectroscopic characterization techniques indicated that the metal oxides were reduced to lower valence states during the reaction, and CO2 could oxidize these reduced forms back to higher valence states. This redox cycle was identified as a key factor contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity observed with vanadium oxide- and iron oxide-based catalysts under CO2 conditions.

研究集中在使用金属氧化物作为催化剂时，对乙苯脱氢作用中晶格氧的作用。特别关注了在氧化钒、铬和铁氧化物上负载的催化剂，这些催化剂支持在活性碳、粉末钻石、γ-Al2O3和MgO等材料上。采用瞬态响应技术来研究晶格氧在二氧化碳存在下的反应动态。发现，在二氧化碳条件下，含钒、铁氧化物的催化剂能提供更高的苯乙烯产率，相比于惰性氮气气氛。二氧化碳与晶格氧的氧化还原循环被证明是促进这些催化剂活性的关键因素，这一过程涉及到晶格氧的消耗和随后由二氧化碳引起的再氧化。

相比之下，三价铬氧化物在脱氢过程中并没有被还原，这表明其催化性能的机制不同。光谱表征方法显示，金属氧化物在反应过程中被还原为较低的价态，并且二氧化碳可以将这些还原形式氧化回较高价态。这一氧化还原循环被认为是提高含钒氧化物和铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳条件下的活性的关键因素。

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The lattice oxygen of vanadium and iron oxides plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process, as it is transferred to the reactants in the early stages under an inert gas atmosphere. Under a CO2 atmosphere, the transferred lattice oxygen is partly supplied from CO2 to maintain the metal oxides at a higher valence state, thereby promoting the catalytic activity. The redox cycle observed in vanadium oxide- and iron oxide-loaded catalysts is an essential factor in enhancing the catalytic performance in the presence of CO2. Chromium oxide, on the other hand, does not undergo significant reduction during the dehydrogenation process, indicating that the role of CO2 is limited in this context. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involve understanding the detailed mechanisms of the redox cycles, optimizing the catalyst composition and support materials, and ensuring the stability and longevity of the catalyst under operating conditions.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成显著影响其在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能。范德华氧化物和铁氧化物的晶格氧在脱氢过程中起着关键作用，它在初始阶段被转移到反应物上，在惰性气体气氛下。在二氧化碳气氛下，从二氧化碳部分提供转移的晶格氧，以维持金属氧化物的高价态，从而促进催化活性。观察到的范德华氧化物-和铁氧化物负载催化剂的还原循环是增强二氧化碳存在下催化性能的重要因素。相比之下，铬氧化物在脱氢过程中不会经历显著的还原，表明二氧化碳的作用有限。这些催化系统理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战涉及理解还原循环的详细机制、优化催化剂组成和支持材料，并确保催化剂在运行条件下的稳定性和寿命。
