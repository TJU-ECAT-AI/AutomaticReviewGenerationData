<p>The transient response technique under Ar flow clearly demonstrated that lattice oxygen of V2O5 on O-Dia preferentially reacted with EB to give ST and H2O in the early stages of the reaction.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the reaction carried out under CO2, ST and H2O were formed just after the introduction of EB without any overshoot.</p>
<p>V/AC catalyst showed diffraction peaks of V2O3, since the catalyst was calcined in Ar and CO2 for only a short period.</p>
<p>Formation of H2O was not detected in the reaction under Ar flow.</p>
<p>It was verified that the amount of dispersed Cr2O3 on the surface of AC was not reduced with the dehydrogenation of EB.</p>
<p>On the other hand, on Cr2O3-loaded catalysts, no significant oxygen transfer from the lattice oxygen of Cr2O3 to EB was observed, and consequently no promoting effect of CO2 was observed.</p>

The study investigated the role of lattice oxygen in metal oxides during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene under a carbon dioxide atmosphere. Vanadium oxide-loaded catalysts showed a higher styrene yield under carbon dioxide than under an argon flow, suggesting a promoting effect of carbon dioxide. The transient response method was used to understand the reaction behaviors of lattice oxygen on various metal oxides. The results showed that lattice oxygen of vanadium oxide was consumed in the dehydrogenation reaction and that reduced vanadium oxide was reoxidized with carbon dioxide. A similar redox cycle was observed on iron oxide-loaded activated carbon catalyst. Spectroscopic characterization revealed that vanadium oxide and iron oxide on the support were reduced to a low valence state during the dehydrogenation reaction, and that carbon dioxide could oxidize the reduced metal oxides. In contrast, chromium(III) oxide was not reduced during dehydrogenation. The redox cycle over vanadium oxide- and iron oxide-loaded catalysts was concluded to be an important factor in promoting the catalytic activity with carbon dioxide.

研究探讨了在二氧化碳气氛下金属氧化物在乙基苯脱氢反应中的晶格氧作用。含钒氧化物负载催化剂在二氧化碳下的苯乙烯产率高于氩气流，表明二氧化碳具有促进作用。使用瞬态响应方法理解了各种金属氧化物上晶格氧的行为。结果表明，钒氧化物的晶格氧在脱氢反应中被消耗，并且还原的钒氧化物通过二氧化碳重新氧化。铁氧化物负载活性炭催化剂上也观察到了类似的还原-氧化循环。光谱表征显示，在脱氢反应中，钒氧化物和铁氧化物被还原到低价态，而二氧化碳能够氧化还原后的金属氧化物。相比之下，铬（III）氧化物在脱氢过程中没有被还原。钒氧化物-和铁氧化物负载催化剂上的还原-氧化循环被证明是提高二氧化碳催化活性的重要因素。
