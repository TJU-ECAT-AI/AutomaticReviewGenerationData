The study focused on the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene using various metal oxides loaded on different supports, with a particular emphasis on the role of lattice oxygen under a CO2 atmosphere. The vanadium oxide-loaded catalysts showed higher styrene yields in CO2 compared to an inert atmosphere. A similar redox cycle was observed on iron oxide-loaded catalysts. Chromium(III) oxide remained unchanged during the dehydrogenation process. The transient response method was utilized to analyze the behavior of lattice oxygen on different metal oxides. The results indicated that the consumption and reoxidation of lattice oxygen played a crucial role in promoting the catalytic activity of the vanadium and iron oxides in the presence of CO2. In contrast, no significant effect of CO2 was observed on chromium oxide-based catalysts.

研究重点是使用不同金属氧化物负载在各种支撑材料上进行乙苯脱氢，特别关注了CO2气氛下晶格氧的作用。钒氧化物负载催化剂在CO2中的苯乙烯产率高于惰性气氛。铁氧化物负载催化剂也显示出类似的氧化还原循环。三价铬氧化物在脱氢过程中保持不变。瞬态响应方法被用来分析不同金属氧化物上晶格氧的行为。结果显示，晶格氧的消耗和再氧化对促进含钒和铁氧化物的催化活性起到了关键作用。相反，在铬氧化物基催化剂中未观察到显著的CO2效果。
