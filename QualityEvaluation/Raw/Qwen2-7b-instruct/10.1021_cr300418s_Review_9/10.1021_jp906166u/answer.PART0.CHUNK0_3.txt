The study focused on the role of lattice oxygen in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene using metal oxides as catalysts, particularly over vanadium, chromium, and iron oxides supported on various materials. The transient response technique was employed to investigate the reaction dynamics of lattice oxygen in the presence of CO2. It was found that vanadium oxide and iron oxide catalysts showed higher styrene yields under CO2 conditions compared to an inert Ar atmosphere. The redox cycle involving the consumption and subsequent reoxidation of lattice oxygen by CO2 played a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity of these catalysts.

Chromium(III) oxide, however, did not undergo reduction during the dehydrogenation process, suggesting a different mechanism for its catalytic performance. Spectroscopic characterization techniques indicated that the metal oxides were reduced to lower valence states during the reaction, and CO2 could oxidize these reduced forms back to higher valence states. This redox cycle was identified as a key factor contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity observed with vanadium oxide- and iron oxide-based catalysts under CO2 conditions.

研究集中在使用金属氧化物作为催化剂时，对乙苯脱氢作用中晶格氧的作用。特别关注了在氧化钒、铬和铁氧化物上负载的催化剂，这些催化剂支持在活性碳、粉末钻石、γ-Al2O3和MgO等材料上。采用瞬态响应技术来研究晶格氧在二氧化碳存在下的反应动态。发现，在二氧化碳条件下，含钒、铁氧化物的催化剂能提供更高的苯乙烯产率，相比于惰性氮气气氛。二氧化碳与晶格氧的氧化还原循环被证明是促进这些催化剂活性的关键因素，这一过程涉及到晶格氧的消耗和随后由二氧化碳引起的再氧化。

相比之下，三价铬氧化物在脱氢过程中并没有被还原，这表明其催化性能的机制不同。光谱表征方法显示，金属氧化物在反应过程中被还原为较低的价态，并且二氧化碳可以将这些还原形式氧化回较高价态。这一氧化还原循环被认为是提高含钒氧化物和铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳条件下的活性的关键因素。
