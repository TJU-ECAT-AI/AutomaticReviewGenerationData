The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involve accurately predicting the effects of these factors on the catalyst's electronic structure and activity. The transient response method applied in the study helps understand the reaction behaviors of lattice oxygen in various metal oxides. The redox cycle involving lattice oxygen, particularly in vanadium and iron oxides, is crucial for enhancing catalytic activity in the presence of CO2. Chromium(III) oxide, however, does not undergo reduction during the dehydrogenation process. The study demonstrates that under CO2, the lattice oxygen is supplied partly from CO2, keeping the metal oxides at higher valence states, thus promoting the catalytic activity.

The challenges include accurately modeling the complex interactions between lattice oxygen, metal oxides, and reactants like ethylbenzene and ethane under various reaction conditions. Process optimization requires careful control of parameters such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates to achieve desired product yields and selectivities. Balancing efficiency and selectivity necessitates a deep understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the ability to adjust catalyst properties accordingly. Safety considerations involve managing potential hazards associated with high-temperature processes and the handling of reactive gases like CO2. Overall, addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach combining catalysis theory, materials science, and process engineering expertise.
