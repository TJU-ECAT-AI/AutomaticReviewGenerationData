The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The lattice oxygen of vanadium and iron oxides plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process, as it is transferred to the reactants in the early stages under an inert gas atmosphere. Under a CO2 atmosphere, the transferred lattice oxygen is partly supplied from CO2 to maintain the metal oxides at a higher valence state, thereby promoting the catalytic activity. The redox cycle observed in vanadium oxide- and iron oxide-loaded catalysts is an essential factor in enhancing the catalytic performance in the presence of CO2. Chromium oxide, on the other hand, does not undergo significant reduction during the dehydrogenation process, indicating that the role of CO2 is limited in this context. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involve understanding the detailed mechanisms of the redox cycles, optimizing the catalyst composition and support materials, and ensuring the stability and longevity of the catalyst under operating conditions.
