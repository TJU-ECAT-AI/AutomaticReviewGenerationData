Since there are no specific quotes related to the question regarding nickel oxide-based catalysts, their preparation methods, dopant concentrations, vacancy formation, electronic structure, catalytic performance, and the challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety, I will provide a summary based on the context of the literature provided.

The Handbook of Industrial Catalysts covers various aspects of catalysis, including fundamental concepts, applied techniques, and specific catalyst types. However, it does not delve deeply into the detailed preparation methods, dopant concentrations, or vacancy formation of nickel oxide-based catalysts, nor does it specifically address their electronic structure, catalytic performance, or the challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

For a comprehensive understanding of these topics, one would need to refer to more specialized literature that focuses on nickel oxide-based catalysts, their synthesis, and their application in specific chemical reactions.

由于文档中没有与问题相关的具体引文，关于镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度、空位形成、电子结构、催化性能以及理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的挑战，我将根据提供的文献上下文提供一个总结。

《工业催化剂手册》涵盖了催化作用的各个方面的内容，包括基本概念、应用技术以及特定催化剂类型。然而，它并没有深入探讨镍氧化物基催化剂的具体合成方法、掺杂浓度或空位形成，也没有专门讨论它们的电子结构、催化性能，或者在脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的挑战。

为了深入了解这些主题，需要参考更专业的文献，这些文献专注于镍氧化物基催化剂的合成及其在特定化学反应中的应用。
