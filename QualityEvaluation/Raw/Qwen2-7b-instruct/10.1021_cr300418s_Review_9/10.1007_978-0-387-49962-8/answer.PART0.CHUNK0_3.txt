The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts. For instance, the right preparation method ensures optimal crystallinity and surface area, which are crucial for efficient reaction sites. Dopant concentrations can alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, leading to changes in its redox potential and thus influencing the reaction rates and selectivities. Vacancy formation can impact the stability and activity of the catalyst, as well as its ability to regenerate during the reaction cycles. Key challenges in theoretical modeling involve accurately predicting the complex interactions between the catalyst, reactants, and products, optimizing the catalyst design to achieve high efficiency and selectivity, and ensuring safety in industrial applications.

Theoretical modeling faces difficulties due to the multiscale nature of catalytic processes, including quantum mechanical effects, surface chemistry, and fluid dynamics. Process optimization requires balancing various factors such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates to maximize yield while minimizing energy consumption and waste production. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety necessitates careful consideration of both the chemical and physical properties of the catalyst system, along with rigorous testing under real-world conditions to ensure robust performance and reliability.
