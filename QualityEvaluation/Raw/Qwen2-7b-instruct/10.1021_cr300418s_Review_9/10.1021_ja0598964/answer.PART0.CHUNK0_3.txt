The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. For instance, in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the electronic structure can be altered by adjusting the preparation methods and dopant concentrations, affecting the reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts. Vacancy formation, often introduced through annealing processes, can also modify the surface properties of the catalysts, impacting their catalytic activity and stability. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the complex interactions between reactants and catalysts, optimizing the catalyst design for specific reaction conditions, and ensuring the balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety. The process optimization requires careful tuning of the catalyst parameters, such as temperature, pressure, and the ratio of reactants, to achieve the desired product yield and purity while minimizing side reactions and potential hazards.
