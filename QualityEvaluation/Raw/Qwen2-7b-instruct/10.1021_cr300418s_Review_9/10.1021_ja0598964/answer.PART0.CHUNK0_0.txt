The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in theoretical modeling involve accurately predicting the electronic structure modifications due to these factors. Process optimization requires balancing the efficiency of the reaction, the selectivity of the product, and ensuring the safety of the system. Theoretical models often struggle to capture the complex interactions between the catalyst, reactants, and products, leading to discrepancies between predicted and experimental outcomes.
