The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include:

1. Theoretical modeling requires accurate representation of the catalyst's electronic structure, which is affected by preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation. This impacts the catalytic sites' reactivity and stability.
   
2. Process optimization involves finding the optimal operating conditions for each reaction type. This includes temperature, pressure, and the presence of specific reactants, which can significantly affect the conversion rates and selectivities.

3. Balancing efficiency and selectivity is crucial. For instance, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, high selectivity to ethylene is desired while maintaining a high overall conversion rate. Similarly, in the reduction of NOx, using ammonia or hydrocarbons selectively on metal oxides demands precise control over the reaction conditions to avoid side reactions.

4. Safety considerations involve preventing overheating, managing the release of hazardous byproducts, and ensuring the stability of the catalyst under operational conditions.

These challenges require interdisciplinary approaches combining chemical engineering, materials science, and catalysis theory to develop robust and efficient nickel oxide-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation and other catalytic processes.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成影响其电子结构和氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）的催化性能。这些催化系统理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战包括：

1. 理论建模需要准确地表示催化剂的电子结构，这受到制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成的影响。这影响催化位点的活性和稳定性。

2. 过程优化涉及为每种反应类型找到最佳的操作条件。这包括温度、压力以及特定反应物的存在，这些因素可以显著影响转化率和选择性。

3. 平衡效率和选择性至关重要。例如，在乙烷氧化为乙烯的氧化脱氢中，高乙烯选择性是所需的，同时保持总体转化率。同样，在NOx的还原中，使用氨或碳氢化合物在金属氧化物上进行选择性还原要求精确控制反应条件，以避免副反应。

4. 安全考虑包括防止过热、管理有害副产品的释放以及确保在操作条件下催化剂的稳定性。

这些挑战需要跨学科的方法，结合化学工程、材料科学和催化理论，来开发稳健且高效的镍氧化物基催化剂，用于氧化脱氢和其他催化过程。
