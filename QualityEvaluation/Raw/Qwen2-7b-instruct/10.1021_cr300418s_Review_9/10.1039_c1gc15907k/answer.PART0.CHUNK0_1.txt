<p>However, there are constant efforts to develop alternate catalysts to produce styrene, especially by ODH.</p>
<p>Unlike dehydrogenation, ODH is an exothermic reaction and hence the reactions can be carried out at relatively lower temperatures than the conventional endothermic dehydrogenation reactions.</p>
<p>The present report is a part of our ongoing investigations from our group towards comprehensive understanding of metal oxide catalysts for different heterogeneous catalytic reactions.</p>
<p>Comparable catalytic activity has been observed in air atmosphere indicates the possibility of enhancing the green chemistry and green engineering aspect of the reaction, by employing FCC reactor.</p>
<p>It is to be underscored the reactivity is retained at the cost of textural properties and phase change to rutile which is essential for the reaction.</p>
<p>Comparable activity has been observed under similar experimental conditions with four times higher air-flow than that of O2.</p>
<p>It is worth highlighting the following three important observations:</p>

The document discusses the development of alternative catalysts for producing styrene through oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which is an exothermic reaction that can be carried out at lower temperatures compared to conventional dehydrogenation reactions. The authors aim to comprehensively understand metal oxide catalysts for different heterogeneous catalytic reactions, including the use of air atmosphere for the reaction, which indicates possibilities for enhancing green chemistry and green engineering. The reactivity of the catalysts is retained at the cost of textural properties and phase change to rutile, which is essential for the reaction. Comparable activity has been observed with increased air flow compared to oxygen flow.
