The preparation method used was the simple solution combustion method (SCM). Vanadium ions were successfully incorporated into the titania lattice. The surface vanadium content increased with higher nominal V concentration, but it was less than the input amount. A catalyst with 10% vanadium content at 500°C showed high ethyl benzene conversion and stable styrene yield. Comparable activity was found under conditions with four times higher air flow than oxygen. After 12 hours, the catalysts had a low surface area between 35 to 40 m2 g-1. During the reaction, the catalysts transformed into rutile, which did not impact the activity. No significant drop in styrene yield occurred with the TVx catalysts, demonstrating the SCM's effectiveness.

The preparation of vanadium incorporated wormhole mesoporous nanocrystalline titania catalysts by a simple solution combustion method enables their use in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethylbenzene to styrene. The incorporation of vanadium ions into the titania lattice framework is confirmed by XRD, Raman, FT-IR, and XPS techniques. These catalysts demonstrate 23 times higher catalytic activity compared to pure TiO2, highlighting the importance of vanadium for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The 10% nominal vanadium incorporated titania catalyst shows stable yield towards styrene. Regeneration of the spent catalysts through heating in oxygen restores original activity. The exothermic nature of the reaction causes anatase phase titania to convert to rutile within 2 hours, which is essential for stable yield. Incorporation of vanadium beyond 10% leads to a decrease in ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield due to increased near neighbor V-V interactions. The comparable catalytic activity observed in air atmosphere suggests the potential for enhancing green chemistry and green engineering aspects of the reaction through the use of fluid catalytic cracking reactors.

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by altering the reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts. In the context of ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene reactions, the introduction of vanadium (V) into the titanium dioxide (TiO2) lattice framework enhances the catalytic activity. Specifically, the 10% nominal vanadium incorporated TiO2 catalyst shows stable yield towards styrene. The catalysts can be regenerated by heating in oxygen, restoring the original activity. The exothermic nature of the reaction leads to a complete conversion of anatase phase to rutile phase within 2 hours, which is crucial for maintaining stable yield. Beyond 10% vanadium content, the catalytic performance decreases due to increased near neighbor V-V interactions leading to more total oxidation. The observed comparable catalytic activity in air atmosphere suggests the potential for enhancing green chemistry and green engineering aspects of the reaction, utilizing fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) reactors.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成会影响它们在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能，进而改变催化剂的活性和选择性。在乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯的反应中，将钒（V）引入二氧化钛（TiO2）晶格框架中可以增强催化剂的活性。具体而言，10%名义钒含量的TiO2催化剂显示出稳定的苯乙烯产率。催化剂可以通过加热至氧气恢复原始活性。反应的放热性质导致在2小时内完全转换为锐钛矿相，这对于维持稳定产率至关重要。超过10%的钒含量，催化剂性能会降低，由于邻近V-V相互作用增加导致更多的完全氧化。观察到空气气氛下的类似催化活性表明有潜力通过利用流化床催化裂解（FCC）反应器来增强化学绿色和工程绿色方面的反应特性。
