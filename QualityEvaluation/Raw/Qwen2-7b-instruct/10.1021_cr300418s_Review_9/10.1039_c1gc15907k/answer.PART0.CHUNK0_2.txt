[1] "Compared to pure TiO2, all TVx catalysts shows 23 times higher catalytic activity demonstrates the importance of V for ODH reaction."
[2] "Among the TVx catalysts, 10% nominal vanadium incorporated titania shows the stable yield towards styrene."
[3] "Due to the exothermic nature of the reaction, anatase phase titania converts completely to rutile phase within 2 h of reaction, and it is the rutile phase responsible for the stable yield due to its stability under exothermic conditions."
[4] "Vanadium ion incorporation beyond 10% leads to a decrease in EB conversion and styrene yield,due to a possible increase in near neighbour VV interaction that leads to more total oxidation."
[5] "Comparable catalytic activity has been observed in air atmosphere indicates the possibility of enhancing the green chemistry and green engineering aspect of the reaction, by employing FCC reactor."

1. The incorporation of vanadium ions in the titania lattice framework significantly enhances the catalytic activity for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, specifically demonstrating its importance in these processes.

2. The 10% nominal vanadium incorporated titania catalyst exhibits stable styrene yield, highlighting its optimal performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

3. The exothermic nature of the reaction causes the anatase phase of titania to rapidly convert to rutile within the first 2 hours, with the rutile phase being crucial for maintaining stable yield under these conditions.

4. Incorporation of vanadium beyond 10% in the titania lattice leads to a decrease in ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield, likely due to increased interactions between vanadium ions that promote more extensive oxidation.

5. The observation of comparable catalytic activity in an air atmosphere suggests potential enhancements in green chemistry and engineering aspects of the reaction by utilizing fluid catalytic cracking reactors.
