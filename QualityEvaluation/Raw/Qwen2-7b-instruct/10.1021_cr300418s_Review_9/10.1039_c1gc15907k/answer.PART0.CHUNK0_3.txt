The preparation of vanadium incorporated wormhole mesoporous nanocrystalline titania catalysts by a simple solution combustion method enables their use in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethylbenzene to styrene. The incorporation of vanadium ions into the titania lattice framework is confirmed by XRD, Raman, FT-IR, and XPS techniques. These catalysts demonstrate 23 times higher catalytic activity compared to pure TiO2, highlighting the importance of vanadium for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The 10% nominal vanadium incorporated titania catalyst shows stable yield towards styrene. Regeneration of the spent catalysts through heating in oxygen restores original activity. The exothermic nature of the reaction causes anatase phase titania to convert to rutile within 2 hours, which is essential for stable yield. Incorporation of vanadium beyond 10% leads to a decrease in ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield due to increased near neighbor V-V interactions. The comparable catalytic activity observed in air atmosphere suggests the potential for enhancing green chemistry and green engineering aspects of the reaction through the use of fluid catalytic cracking reactors.

通过简单的溶液燃烧方法制备了含钒纳米孔径介晶钛酸盐催化剂，这些催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中，如乙苯转化为苯乙烯，具有重要的应用。通过X射线衍射、拉曼光谱、傅里叶变换红外光谱和X射线光电子能谱技术证实了钛酸盐晶格框架中钒离子的掺杂。与纯TiO2相比，所有TVx催化剂的催化活性提高了23倍，这强调了钒对于氧化脱氢反应的重要性。含10%名义钒的钛酸盐催化剂显示出稳定的苯乙烯产率。通过加热氧恢复废弃催化剂的原始活性。反应的放热性质导致在2小时内将锐钛矿相钛酸盐完全转换为金红石相，这是稳定产率所必需的。在高于10%的钒掺杂量下，乙苯转化率和苯乙烯产率降低，原因是近邻V-V相互作用的增加。在空气气氛中观察到的相似的催化活性表明，通过使用流化床催化裂解反应器可以增强反应的绿色化学和绿色工程方面。
