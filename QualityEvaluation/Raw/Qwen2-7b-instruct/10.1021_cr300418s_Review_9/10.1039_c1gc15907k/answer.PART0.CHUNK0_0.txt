The preparation method used was the simple solution combustion method (SCM). Vanadium ions were successfully incorporated into the titania lattice. The surface vanadium content increased with higher nominal V concentration, but it was less than the input amount. A catalyst with 10% vanadium content at 500°C showed high ethyl benzene conversion and stable styrene yield. Comparable activity was found under conditions with four times higher air flow than oxygen. After 12 hours, the catalysts had a low surface area between 35 to 40 m2 g-1. During the reaction, the catalysts transformed into rutile, which did not impact the activity. No significant drop in styrene yield occurred with the TVx catalysts, demonstrating the SCM's effectiveness.

采用简单溶液燃烧法（SCM）制备催化剂。成功将钒离子引入到二氧化钛晶格中。表面钒含量随名义V浓度增加而提高，但低于输入量。含10%钒的催化剂在500°C下表现出高乙苯转化率和稳定的苯乙烯产率。在氧气流速为四倍的条件下，类似实验条件下的活性相等。反应12小时后，催化剂的表面积在35至40 m2 g-1之间。在反应过程中，催化剂转化为锐钛矿，这没有影响活性。TVx催化剂的产率没有显著下降，证明了SCM的有效性。
