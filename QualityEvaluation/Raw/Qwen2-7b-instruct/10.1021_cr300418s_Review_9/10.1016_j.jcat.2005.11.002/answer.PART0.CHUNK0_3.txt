[1] "The present work demonstrates the high potential of a new class of catalytic materials based on nickel as active component for the low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene."
[2] "Even small amounts of niobium effectively substitute Ni2+ ions and/or fill the cationic vacancies in the NiO lattice, with higher Nb content leading to saturation of the bulk lattices sites and formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 phase and pure Nb2O5."
[3] "The key component for this excellent catalytic behavior seems to be the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping NiO with Nb."
[4] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides."
[5] "An optimum in the catalytic behavior is achieved for the catalyst containing Nb/Ni in an intermediate ratio of 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15), which exhibits the highest per weight activity and selectivity to ethylene (90%)."
[6] "A correlation between the ethane specific surface activity of the catalysts and the surface-exposed nickel content indicates that nickel sites constitute the active centers for activation of the paraffinic substrate, whereas niobium affects mainly the selectivity to the desired product, olefin."
