1. Small amounts of niobium can substitute Ni2+ ions or fill cationic vacancies in NiO, leading to the formation of mixed phases and pure Nb2O5. Surface exposure of Ni and Nb is constant except for the highest-Nb content catalyst, which may be due to inhomogeneity and segregation.

2. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen through Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity of Ni NbO mixed oxides.

3. Nickel sites are key for ethane activation, while niobium mainly affects selectivity towards olefin products.

4. NiO's cationic vacancies can hold electrophilic oxygen radicals, which are involved in total oxidation of ethane to CO2. Nb's favorable ionic radii allow it to fill vacancies or substitute Ni atoms, creating a NiNb solid solution.

1. 少量铌可以替代Ni2+离子或填充NiO中的空位，导致形成混合相和纯Nb2O5。Ni和Nb在表面的暴露是恒定的，除了最高Nb含量的催化剂，这可能是由于不均匀性和两相分离导致的。

2. 通过Nb掺杂消除非化学计量氧是Ni NbO复合氧化物表现出高乙烯选择性的主要原因。

3. 镍位点是烷烃活化的关键，而铌主要影响目标产物烯烃的选择性。

4. NiO的阳离子空位可以容纳带正电的氧自由基，这些自由基参与了乙烷到CO2的完全氧化过程。铌的有利离子半径允许它填充空位或替代Ni原子，形成NiNb固溶体。
