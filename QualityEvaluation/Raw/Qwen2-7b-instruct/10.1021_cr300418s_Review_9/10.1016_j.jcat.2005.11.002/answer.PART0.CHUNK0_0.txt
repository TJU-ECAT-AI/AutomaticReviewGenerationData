[1] "The present work demonstrates the high potential of a new class of catalytic materials based on nickel as active component for the low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene."
[2] "An optimum in the catalytic behavior is achieved for the catalyst containing Nb/Ni in an intermediate ratio of 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15), which exhibits the highest per weight activity and selectivity to ethylene (90%)."
[3] "NiO is a nonstoichiometric oxide with cationic vacancies, which can accommodate large amounts of excess electrophilic oxygen radicals, strong oxidizing species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2 occurring on the NiO surface."
[4] "Due to the favorable ionic radii of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution."
[5] "This substitution process is most likely responsible for the reduction of the nonstoichiometry and the cationic defects on the surface and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species,leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."

1. Nickel-based catalysts have high potential for the low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene.
2. The catalyst with the optimal Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176 shows the highest activity and selectivity for ethylene production.
3. Nickel oxide's nonstoichiometric nature allows it to accommodate large amounts of electrophilic oxygen radicals, which contribute to the total oxidation of ethane.
4. The introduction of niobium into nickel oxide results in a solid solution that reduces the nonstoichiometry and cationic defects, enhancing ethane ODH activity.
5. The substitution of niobium for nickel in the lattice of nickel oxide decreases the unselective oxygen species, improving the selectivity towards ethylene.
