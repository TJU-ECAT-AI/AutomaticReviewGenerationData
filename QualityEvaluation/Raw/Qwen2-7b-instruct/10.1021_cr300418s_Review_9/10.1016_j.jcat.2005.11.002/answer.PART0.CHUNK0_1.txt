[1] "NiNbO mixed oxides prove to be highly active and selective catalytic materials for the production of ethene via ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, exhibiting an overall ethylene yield of 46% at 400 C."
[2] "The key component for this excellent catalytic behavior seems to be the NiNb solid solution formed upon doping NiO with Nb."
[3] "XPS, electrical conductivity, and O2-TPD studies demonstrate that NiO is a highly conductive, nonstoichiometric oxide with cationic vacancies (excess surface oxygen)."
[4] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor."
[5] "The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."

1. Nickel niobium oxide mixed oxides were found to be highly effective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane into ethylene, achieving a yield of 46% at 400°C.
2. The primary factor behind the outstanding catalytic properties of these materials is the formation of a nickel niobium solid solution when niobium is added to nickel oxide.
3. XPS, electrical conductivity, and O2-TPD studies revealed that nickel oxide is a highly conductive, nonstoichiometric oxide with cationic vacancies on its surface.
4. By acting as an electron donor, niobium reduces the positive p+ holes in the nickel oxide acceptor, decreasing the concentration of these holes.
5. The reduction of nonstoichiometric oxygen in the catalysts through the addition of niobium is likely the reason for the high ethylene selectivity observed in these mixed oxide catalysts.
