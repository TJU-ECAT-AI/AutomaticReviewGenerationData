[1] "The present work demonstrates the high potential of a new class of catalytic materials based on nickel as active component for the low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene."
[2] "An optimum in the catalytic behavior is achieved for the catalyst containing Nb/Ni in an intermediate ratio of 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15), which exhibits the highest per weight activity and selectivity to ethylene (90%)." 
[3] "NiO is a nonstoichiometric oxide with cationic vacancies, which can accommodate large amounts of excess electrophilic oxygen radicals, strong oxidizing species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2 occurring on the NiO surface."  
[4] "Due to the favorable ionic radii of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution."
[5] "This substitution process is most likely responsible for the reduction of the nonstoichiometry and the cationic defects on the surface and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species,leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."
