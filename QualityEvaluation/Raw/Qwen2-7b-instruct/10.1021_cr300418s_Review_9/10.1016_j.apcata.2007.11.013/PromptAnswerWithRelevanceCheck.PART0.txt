The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the distribution and reactivity of active sites. High activity in ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene conversions can be achieved through the effective mono-dispersion of vanadium species and the absence of vanadium pentoxide clusters. Additionally, the addition of lanthanum ions can hinder the formation of coke on the catalyst surface, thus maintaining its stability. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the precise mechanisms of active site formation, optimizing the dopant concentration for optimal performance, and preventing deactivation due to coke formation.
