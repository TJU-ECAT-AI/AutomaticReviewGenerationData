[1] "The catalytic performance of the LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts in EB dehydrogenation using CO2 as oxidant depends closely on the extent of vanadium loading and the interaction between the lanthanum and vanadium entities."
[2] "The addition of La3+ can hinder coke formation on LaVOx/SBA-15 and hence sustain the stability of the catalysts."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions through the extent of vanadium loading and the interaction between lanthanum and vanadium entities. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems involve understanding the precise mechanisms by which these factors affect the catalyst's activity and stability. The addition of lanthanum can hinder coke formation, thereby sustaining the stability of the catalysts.
