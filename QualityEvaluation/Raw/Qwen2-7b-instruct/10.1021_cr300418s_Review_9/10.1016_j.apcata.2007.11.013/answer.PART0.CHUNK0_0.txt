[1] "The catalytic performance of a series of LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts with different vanadium loadings was investigated for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2 as oxidant."
[2] "The addition of La3+ has an effect of hindering carbon deposition and enhancing the stability of the catalysts."
[3] "The 10%La2O315%V2O5/SBA-15 (wt%) catalyst exhibited the best activity and stability, giving a styrene yield of 74%."
[4] "According to the results of characterization, the good performance of the catalyst could be related to the mono-dispersion of the VO4 3 species and the synergistic action of lanthanum and vanadium."
[5] "The conversion of EB and CO2, the yield of styrene over the LaVOx/SBA-15 and 15V/SBA-15 catalysts as a function of time on stream are depicted in Fig. 6."
[6] "The catalytic performance of the LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts in EB dehydrogenation using CO2 as oxidant depends closely on the extent of vanadium loading and the interaction between the lanthanum and vanadium entities."

1. The study investigated the catalytic performance of a series of LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2 as oxidant. The catalysts had varying vanadium loadings.
2. Adding La3+ to the catalysts hindered carbon deposition and enhanced their stability.
3. The 10%La2O315%V2O5/SBA-15 catalyst showed the best activity and stability, yielding 74% styrene.
4. The catalyst's excellent performance was attributed to the mono-dispersed VO4 3 species and the synergistic action of lanthanum and vanadium.
5. The conversion rates of ethylbenzene and CO2, along with styrene yields, were plotted against time on stream.
6. The catalytic performance of LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 as oxidant depended largely on vanadium loading and the interaction between lanthanum and vanadium.
