[1] "The catalytic performance of the LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts in EB dehydrogenation using CO2 as oxidant depends closely on the extent of vanadium loading and the interaction between the lanthanum and vanadium entities."
[2] "The 10La15V/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits high activity due to the effective mono-dispersion of the vanadium species and the absence of V2O5-like clusters."
[3] "The addition of La3+ can hinder coke formation on LaVOx/SBA-15 and hence sustain the stability of the catalysts."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the distribution and reactivity of active sites. High activity in ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene conversions can be achieved through the effective mono-dispersion of vanadium species and the absence of vanadium pentoxide clusters. Additionally, the addition of lanthanum ions can hinder the formation of coke on the catalyst surface, thus maintaining its stability. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the precise mechanisms of active site formation, optimizing the dopant concentration for optimal performance, and preventing deactivation due to coke formation.
