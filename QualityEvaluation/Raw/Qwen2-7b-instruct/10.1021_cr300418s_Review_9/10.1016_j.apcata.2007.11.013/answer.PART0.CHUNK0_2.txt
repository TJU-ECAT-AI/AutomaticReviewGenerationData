[1] "The catalytic performance of the LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts in EB dehydrogenation using CO2 as oxidant depends closely on the extent of vanadium loading and the interaction between the lanthanum and vanadium entities. The 10La15V/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits high activity due to the effective mono-dispersion of the vanadium species and the absence of V2O5-like clusters."
[2] "The addition of La3+ can hinder coke formation on LaVOx/SBA-15 and hence sustain the stability of the catalysts."
[3] "The 10La15V/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits high activity due to the effective mono-dispersion of the vanadium species and the absence of V2O5-like clusters."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene by affecting the dispersion of active species, the presence of active sites, and the interaction between dopants. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic structure and activity sites, optimizing the process parameters for maximum efficiency and selectivity while maintaining safety, and understanding the mechanisms of carbon deposition and its impact on catalyst deactivation. The 10La15V/SBA-15 catalyst stands out for its high activity, attributed to the effective mono-dispersion of vanadium species, absence of V2O5-like clusters, and the role of lanthanum in hindering coke formation.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成会影响其在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能，通过影响活性物种的分散、活性位点的存在以及掺杂剂之间的相互作用。理论建模的关键挑战包括准确预测电子结构和活性位点，优化参数以实现最大效率和选择性同时保持安全性，并理解碳沉积机制及其对催化剂失活的影响。10La15V/SBA-15催化剂因其高度的活性而突出，这归因于有效的钒物种分散、无V2O5类似簇的存在以及镧在阻止焦炭形成方面的作用。
