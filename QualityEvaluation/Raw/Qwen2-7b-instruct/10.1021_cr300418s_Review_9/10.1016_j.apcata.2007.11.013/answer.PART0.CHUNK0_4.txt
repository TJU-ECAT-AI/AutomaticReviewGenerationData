[1] "The catalytic performance of the LaVOx/SBA-15 catalysts in EB dehydrogenation using CO2 as oxidant depends closely on the extent of vanadium loading and the interaction between the lanthanum and vanadium entities."
[2] "The addition of La3+ can hinder coke formation on LaVOx/SBA-15 and hence sustain the stability of the catalysts."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene, through their impact on the extent of vanadium loading and the interaction between the lanthanum and vanadium entities. The electronic structure affects the reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts. The key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include accurately predicting the electronic structure changes due to doping and vacancy formation, optimizing the dopant concentration for desired catalytic activity, and understanding the complex interactions between different components of the catalyst system. The addition of lanthanum (La3+) can hinder coke formation, thereby sustaining the stability of the catalysts.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成影响它们在氧化脱氢反应（如乙苯转化为苯乙烯和乙烷转化为乙烯）中的电子结构和催化性能，这主要通过影响钒加载量的大小和镧和钒实体之间的相互作用来实现。电子结构影响催化剂的活性和选择性。这些催化系统的理论建模、过程优化以及平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战包括准确预测由于掺杂和空位形成导致的电子结构变化，优化掺杂浓度以获得所需的催化活性，并理解催化剂系统中不同成分之间复杂的相互作用。镧（La3+）的添加可以阻止焦炭形成，从而维持催化剂的稳定性。
