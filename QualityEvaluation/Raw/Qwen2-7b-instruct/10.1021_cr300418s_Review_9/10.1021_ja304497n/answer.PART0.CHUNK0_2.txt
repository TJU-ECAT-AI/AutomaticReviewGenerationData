The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts have significant impacts on their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. These factors are essential in transforming substrates like ethylbenzene into styrene and ethane into ethylene. The main challenges in modeling these systems theoretically, optimizing the processes, and achieving a balance between efficiency, selectivity, and safety are considerable.
