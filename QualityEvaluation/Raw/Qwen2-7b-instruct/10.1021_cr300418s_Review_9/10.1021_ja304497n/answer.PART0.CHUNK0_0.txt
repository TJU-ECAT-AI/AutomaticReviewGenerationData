1. The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by altering the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst. Key challenges in theoretical modeling include accurately predicting the electronic properties and interactions within the catalyst structure. Process optimization faces difficulties in achieving high efficiency, selectivity, and safety simultaneously, often requiring trade-offs among these factors. Balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety necessitates detailed understanding of the catalyst's behavior under various operating conditions.
