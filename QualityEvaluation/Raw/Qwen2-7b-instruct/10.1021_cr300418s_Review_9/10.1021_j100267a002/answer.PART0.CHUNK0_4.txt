[1] "The formation of surface-generated gas-phase radicals during the reactions of methane, ethane, ethylene, and propylene over selected oxide catalysts was examined."
[2] "With this system it was possible not only to detect the formation of gas-phase radicals, but also to determine the amounts of the radicals produced."
[3] "The results of this study, along with the specific surface areas of the oxides examined and the bond strengths of the most labile hydrogen atom of the hydrocarbons, are presented in Table I."
[4] "Considering this chemistry and the radical amounts observed for the PbO samples, it appears that the sites responsible for hydrogen atom abstraction on these oxides are most likely lattice Os2- ions associated with Pb(I1) ions, and not Pb(1V)."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding the specific surface areas and bond strengths of the reactants, as well as the nature of the active sites responsible for hydrogen atom abstraction. The presence of lattice Os2- ions associated with Pb(I1) ions on lead monoxide samples indicates that the sites for hydrogen atom abstraction are likely associated with lead ions, rather than the more common lead(IV) ions.

镍氧化物基催化剂的制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成会影响它们在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能。在理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性这些催化系统的关键挑战包括理解反应物的具体表面积和键强度，以及负责氢原子抽象的活性位点的性质。铅氧化物样本中存在晶格Os2-离子与铅(I)离子相关联的事实表明，氢原子抽象的位点可能与铅离子有关，而不是更常见的铅(IV)离子。
