[1] "The ability of a surface to generate gas-phase hydrocarbon radicals depends upon the bond strength of the weakest C-H bond, the presence of particular radical-forming sites on the surface, and the propensity of the radicals to either desorb or to undergo further surface reactions."
[2] "Lead monoxide (PbO), when heated in the presence of air or oxygen, is easily converted to the mixed oxide Pb2(II)Pb(IV)O,(red lead), which behaves chemically as a mixture of PbO and Pb02."
[3] "Considering this chemistry and the radical amounts observed for the PbO samples, it appears that the sites responsible for hydrogen atom abstraction on these oxides are most likely lattice Os2- ions associated with Pb(I1) ions, and not Pb(IV)."

The preparation methods, dopant concentrations, and vacancy formation in nickel oxide-based catalysts influence their electronic structure and catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key challenges in theoretical modeling, process optimization, and balancing efficiency, selectivity, and safety in these catalytic systems include understanding how these factors affect the bond strength of the weakest C-H bond, the presence of radical-forming sites on the surface, and the propensity of radicals to desorb or undergo further surface reactions. For instance, lead monoxide (PbO) transforms to red lead (Pb2(II)Pb(IV)O) upon heating in the presence of air or oxygen, which behaves as a mixture of PbO and Pb02. The sites responsible for hydrogen atom abstraction on these oxides are likely lattice Os2- ions associated with Pb(I1) ions, not Pb(IV), based on the observed chemistry and radical amounts.

在镍氧化物基催化剂中，制备方法、掺杂浓度和空位形成影响其在氧化脱氢反应中的电子结构和催化性能。在理论建模、过程优化和平衡效率、选择性和安全性的关键挑战包括理解这些因素如何影响最弱C-H键的键能、表面生成自由基的点的存在以及自由基脱附或进一步在表面上反应的趋势。例如，铅氧化物（PbO）在空气或氧气存在的加热下容易转化为红铅（Pb2(II)Pb(IV)O），其化学行为类似于PbO和Pb02的混合物。这些氧化物上负责氢原子提取的点可能是与Pb(I1)离子相关的晶格Os2-离子，而不是Pb(IV)，基于观察到的化学性质和自由基量。
