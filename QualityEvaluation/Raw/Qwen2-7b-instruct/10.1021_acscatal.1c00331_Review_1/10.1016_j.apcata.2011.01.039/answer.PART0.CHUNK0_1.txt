[1] "Coke on the catalyst could form from several routes, such as deep cracking of propane, polymerization of olefins (mainly propene) and condensation of large molecules."
[2] "These two mechanisms are represented by 
C3H8 3C + 4H2 (3) 
nC3H6 3nCH0.5 + 2.25nH2 (4)"
[3] "The model describes well the kinetics of catalyst deactivation, which is related to the rate of coke formation and takes into consideration the facts that propene promotes while hydrogen depresses coke formation, is proposed."

1. Coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly during propane dehydrogenation, can originate from several pathways. These include deep cracking of propane into carbon, polymerization of olefins, primarily propene, and the condensation of larger molecules.

2. The formation of coke can be represented by two mechanisms. The first mechanism involves the deep cracking of propane into three carbon atoms and four hydrogen molecules. The second mechanism involves the polymerization of n moles of propene into 3n moles of a half-integer carbon molecule and 2.25n moles of hydrogen.

3. The kinetic model developed considers the role of propene in accelerating coke formation while hydrogen acts to suppress it. This model effectively describes the dynamics of catalyst deactivation, which is directly linked to the rate of coke formation, taking into account the differing effects of propene and hydrogen on the process.

1. 在催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢过程中，焦炭沉积可以源自几个途径。这些包括丙烷的深层裂解为碳、烯烃聚合，主要为丙烯，以及大分子的缩合。

2. 焦炭的形成可以被表示为两个机制。第一个机制涉及将一个丙烷分子裂解为三个碳原子和四个氢分子。第二个机制涉及n摩尔丙烯的聚合为3n摩尔半整数碳分子和2.25n摩尔氢分子。

3. 所建立的动力学模型考虑了丙烯在加速焦炭形成中的作用，而氢则抑制这一过程。该模型有效地描述了催化剂失活的动力学，这直接与焦炭形成速率相关，并考虑到丙烯和氢对过程的不同影响。
