[1] "Coke on the catalyst could form from several routes, such as deep cracking of propane, polymerization of olefins (mainly propene) and condensation of large molecules."
[2] "These two mechanisms are represented by 
C3H8 3C + 4H2 (3) 
nC3H6 3nCH0.5 + 2.25nH2 (4)"

1. Coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly during propane dehydrogenation, can originate from several pathways. These include deep cracking of propane into carbon, polymerization of olefins, primarily propene, and the condensation of larger molecules.

2. The formation of coke can be represented by two mechanisms. The first mechanism involves the deep cracking of propane into three carbon atoms and four hydrogen molecules. The second mechanism involves the polymerization of n moles of propene into 3n moles of a half-integer carbon molecule and 2.25n moles of hydrogen.

3. The kinetic model developed considers the role of propene in accelerating coke formation while hydrogen acts to suppress it. This model effectively describes the dynamics of catalyst deactivation, which is directly linked to the rate of coke formation, taking into account the differing effects of propene and hydrogen on the process.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst type. The literature indicates that the primary component influencing coke formation is propene, which acts as the main precursor. Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation of coke and consequently deactivation. The kinetic models developed in this study effectively capture the dynamics of catalyst deactivation, linking it to the rate of coke formation and considering the contrasting effects of propene and hydrogen. These models accurately predict the changes in propane conversion over time under various operational conditions.

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. This variation is primarily attributed to the chemical nature of the catalyst, the reaction temperature, and the presence of reactants and products. Analytical techniques such as gas chromatography, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. These methods allow for the identification and quantification of coke components, providing insights into their structure and reactivity. The coke deposits often consist of various hydrocarbon polymers, carbonaceous materials, and sometimes metallic residues depending on the catalyst used and the reaction conditions.

The model presented in the literature identifies the first cleavage of propane molecules as the rate-determining step in PDH reactions. Propene is recognized as the primary precursor for coke formation, while hydrogen plays a role in suppressing coke formation and thus affecting catalyst deactivation. The model accurately predicts the kinetics of catalyst deactivation, taking into account the relationship between the rate of coke formation and the influence of propene and hydrogen on this process. This approach allows for a better understanding of the complex interactions between reactants, products, and catalysts during PDH reactions, facilitating the development of more efficient and stable catalysts.

催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭沉积物组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下变化显著。这种变化主要归因于催化剂的化学性质、反应温度以及反应物和产物的存在。通过气相色谱法、X射线衍射和扫描电子显微镜等分析技术，已经对这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性进行了深入研究。这些方法允许识别和量化焦炭成分，提供有关其结构和活性的见解。焦炭沉积物通常由各种烃聚合物、碳质材料以及有时是金属残留物组成，这取决于所使用的催化剂及其反应条件。

文献中提出的模型将丙烷分子的第一个裂解确定为PDH反应中的决定性步骤。丙烯被确认为焦炭形成的主要前体，而氢则在抑制焦炭形成并影响催化剂失活方面发挥作用。该模型准确地预测了催化剂失活的动态过程，考虑到焦炭形成速率与丙烯和氢对这一过程的影响。这种方法有助于更深入地理解PDH反应中反应物、产物和催化剂之间的复杂相互作用，从而促进更高效稳定的催化剂的发展。
