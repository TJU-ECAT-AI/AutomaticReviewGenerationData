[1] "The propene is identified as the main precursor for the coke formation and hydrogen suppressed coke formation and thus deactivation."
[2] "The model describes well the kinetics of catalyst deactivation, which is related to the rate of coke formation and takes into consideration the facts that propene promotes while hydrogen depresses coke formation, is proposed."
[3] "The changes of propane conversion with time-on-stream under different operating conditions are well predicted by the deactivation model."

1. In propane dehydrogenation reactions, propene is recognized as the primary precursor for coke formation, whereas hydrogen restrains coke formation and consequently catalyst deactivation.
2. The model effectively elucidates the dynamics of catalyst deactivation, which is contingent upon the rate of coke formation. It acknowledges that propene enhances coke formation, whereas hydrogen diminishes it.
3. Under varying operational conditions, the deactivation model accurately forecasts changes in propane conversion over time.

1. 在丙烷脱氢反应中，丙烯被确认为焦炭形成的主要前体，而氢气则抑制焦炭形成和催化剂失活。
2. 模型很好地解释了催化剂失活的动力学，这依赖于焦炭形成的速度。它指出，丙烯促进焦炭形成，而氢气则抑制它。
3. 在不同的操作条件下，失活模型能够准确预测丙烷转化率随时间的变化。
