[1] "Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic models for catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Pt-Sn/Al2O3 are proposed based on the reaction mechanisms that take into account the one step or two-step dehydrogenation and are evaluated by fitting the experiments."
[2] "The first CH cleavage in propane molecule is identified as the rate-determining step."
[3] "Propene is identified as the main precursor for the coke formation and hydrogen suppressed coke formation and thus deactivation."
[4] "The model describes well the kinetics of catalyst deactivation, which is related to the rate of coke formation and takes into consideration the facts that propene promotes while hydrogen depresses coke formation."
[5] "The changes of propane conversion with time-on-stream under different operating conditions are well predicted by the deactivation model."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst type. The literature indicates that the primary component influencing coke formation is propene, which acts as the main precursor. Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation of coke and consequently deactivation. The kinetic models developed in this study effectively capture the dynamics of catalyst deactivation, linking it to the rate of coke formation and considering the contrasting effects of propene and hydrogen. These models accurately predict the changes in propane conversion over time under various operational conditions.

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成会根据反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。文献表明，影响焦炭形成的主要成分是丙烯，它是主要的前体。氢气则抑制了焦炭的形成，并进而减少了催化剂的失活。本研究开发的动力学模型有效地捕捉了催化剂失活的动态，将其与焦炭形成速率相关联，并考虑了丙烯促进而氢气抑制焦炭形成的事实。这些模型能够准确预测在不同操作条件下丙烷转化率随时间的变化情况。
