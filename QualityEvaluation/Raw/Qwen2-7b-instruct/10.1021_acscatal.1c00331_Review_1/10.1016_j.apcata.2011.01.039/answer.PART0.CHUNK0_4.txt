[1] "Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic models for catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Pt-Sn/Al2O3 are proposed based on the reaction mechanisms that take into account the one step or two-step dehydrogenation and are evaluated by fitting the experiments."
[2] "When taking into consideration the fitting accuracy, the number of fitting parameters and the rigorosity of the reaction mechanism, the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation based on the assumptions of step-wise dehydrogenation, the first step dehydrogenation as the rate-determining step, and low surface coverage of C3H7 outperforms other kinetic models."
[3] "The change of catalyst activity with time-on-stream is related to the rate of coke formation that depends on the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen."
[4] "Finally a complete kinetic model, which includes propane dehydrogenation and cracking and catalyst deactivation because of coking, is developed, which is found to agree well with the changes of propane conversions with time-on-stream under different operating conditions."
[5] "The model describes well the kinetics of catalyst deactivation, which is related to the rate of coke formation and takes into consideration the facts that propene promotes while hydrogen depresses coke formation."
[6] "The strategy for kinetic modeling employed in the present work is to directly integrate the coking formation kinetic model into the deactivation model, making it possible to avoid measurement of coke content in situ."

1. Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic models for catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts are proposed based on the reaction mechanisms that consider one-step or two-step dehydrogenation, and these models are evaluated by fitting experimental data. 

2. Among the models considered, the one based on the assumption of step-wise dehydrogenation, with the first step as the rate-determining step and low surface coverage of C3H7, outperforms others in terms of fitting accuracy, number of fitting parameters, and the rigor of the reaction mechanism.

3. The rate of catalyst activity change with time-on-stream correlates with the rate of coke formation, which is influenced by the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen.

4. A comprehensive kinetic model that includes propane dehydrogenation, cracking, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is developed. This model accurately predicts the changes in propane conversion over time under various operating conditions.

5. The model effectively describes the kinetics of catalyst deactivation, taking into account that propene promotes and hydrogen suppresses coke formation.

6. The methodology for kinetic modeling in this study involves integrating the kinetic model for coke formation directly into the deactivation model, allowing for the prediction of catalyst deactivation without measuring coke content in situ.
