[1] "The carbonaceous deposit that is an inevitable by-product of catalytic cracking is called coke, and is generally determined as the weight per cent of carbon on feed or on catalyst."
[2] "In catalytic cracking, either fluid or fixed-bed, the extent of conversion is determined by such factors as catalyst, feed stock, temperature, pressure, feed rate, and length of time between catalyst regenerations (here called catalyst residence time)."
[3] "In fixed-bed cracking the conversion measured is the summation of the instantaneous conversions throughout the process period, the instantaneous conversions decreasing with time on stream as the catalyst becomes fouled with coke."
[4] "In fluid cracking the feed rate is generally expressed as weight of feed per hour per weight of catalyst held in the reactor or w/hr./w."
[5] "Another term employed in fluid cracking is the catalyst-to-oil ratio, which is the ratio of the weight rates of flow of catalyst and oil."
[6] "Data in fixed-bed and in fluid catalytic cracking are treated separately."
[7] "A considerable amount of data shows that the weight per cent carbon formed on the catalyst is approximately a logarithmic function of the length of time elapsed since the catalyst was freshly regenerated."
[8] "In the example just discussed for East Texas gas oil and synthetic catalyst, the implicit assumption is made that, within limits, the feed rate has no effect on the extent of carbon formation on catalyst for a given residence time."
[9] "It is common practice to purge off most of the strippable carbon Catalytic Regenerator at the Top of One of the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Units at the Baton Rouge Refinery before the catalyst is regenerated."
[10] "Although, as mentioned above, the yield of carbon on feed stock at a given temperature is a function of conversion, there is also a well-defined relation between the weight per cent of carbon on catalyst and the catalyst residence time."

1. Coke, an inevitable by-product of catalytic cracking, is determined as the weight percentage of carbon on feed or catalyst. 
2. The extent of conversion in catalytic cracking is influenced by factors including catalyst, feedstock, temperature, pressure, feed rate, and catalyst residence time.
3. In fixed-bed cracking, the conversion is the cumulative sum of instantaneous conversions, which decrease over time as the catalyst becomes fouled with coke.
4. In fluid cracking, the feed rate is typically expressed as the weight of feed per hour per weight of catalyst in the reactor, known as w/hr./w.
5. The catalyst-to-oil ratio, another term used in fluid cracking, is the ratio of the weight rates of flow of catalyst and oil.
6. Data from fixed-bed and fluid catalytic cracking processes are analyzed separately.
7. The weight percentage of carbon formed on the catalyst is roughly a logarithmic function of the time elapsed since the catalyst was freshly regenerated.
8. In the context of East Texas gas oil and synthetic catalyst, it's assumed that the feed rate has no impact on carbon formation on the catalyst for a given residence time, within specified limits.
9. Before regeneration, most of the strippable carbon is purged from the catalytic regenerator at the top of a fluid catalytic cracking unit in the Baton Rouge refinery.
10. The yield of carbon on the feed stock at a given temperature is dependent on conversion, while there's also a clear relationship between the weight percentage of carbon on the catalyst and the catalyst residence time.

1. 催化裂解的不可避免副产品，焦炭，通常以原料或催化剂上的碳的质量百分比来确定。
2. 在催化裂解过程中，转化程度受催化剂、原料、温度、压力、进料速率和催化剂再生时间等影响。
3. 在固定床裂解中，转化是过程周期内瞬时转化率的累积总和，随着催化剂因焦炭积聚而老化，瞬时转化率会降低。
4. 在流化床裂解中，进料速率通常以每小时每单位催化剂重量的原料质量来表示，称为w/hr./w。
5. 另一个在流化床裂解中使用的术语是催化剂对油的比例，这是催化剂和油的重量流速之比。
6. 固定床和流化床催化裂解的数据被分开处理。
7. 催化剂上形成的碳的质量百分比大致与自催化剂新鲜再生以来的时间呈对数函数关系。
8. 对于东德克萨斯州的天然气油和合成催化剂而言，在给定的停留时间内，假设在一定的范围内，进料速率对催化剂上碳形成的影响可以忽略不计。
9. 在流化床催化裂解装置的巴吞鲁日炼油厂顶部的催化再生器中，在催化剂再生前，通常会清除大部分可分离的碳。
10. 在给定温度下，原料上的碳产量取决于转化率，同时，催化剂上碳的质量百分比与催化剂停留时间之间也有明确的关系。
