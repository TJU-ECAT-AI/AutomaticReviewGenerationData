[1] "For all the data examined, the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst at given conditions is, within limits, independent of the hydrocarbon feed rate."
[2] "Certain generalized correlations of striking simplicity and considerable utility have resulted from a study of such data."
[3] "Although the extent of carbon formation in catalytic cracking depends on the type of catalyst, the feed stock, and the operating conditions, it has been found that there is an intrinsic uniformity in the way the carbon deposit on the catalyst increases with time."
[4] "In fixed-bed cracking the conversion measured is the summation of the instantaneous conversions throughout the process period, the instantaneous conversions decreasing with time on stream as the catalyst becomes fouled with coke."
[5] "In either fluid or fixed-bed cracking, conversion increases with increasing temperature, decreasing feed rate, and decreasing catalyst residence time."
[6] "Data in fixed-bed and in fluid catalytic cracking are treated separately."
[7] "In fixed-bed cracking the weight per cent carbon formed on the catalyst is approximately a logarithmic function of the length of time elapsed since the catalyst was freshly regenerated."
[8] "As the feed rate increases at a given temperature, the weight per cent carbon on feed decreases as might be expected, but the weight per cent carbon on catalyst remains substantially constant."
[9] "A practical demonstration that percent carbon on catalyst is virtually unaffected by feed rate was furnished some years ago in the operation of a semiplant-scale, fixed-bed catalytic cracking unit."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques such as gas chromatography (GC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry (MS) have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. These methods enable the identification and quantification of various organic compounds and their derivatives that contribute to the coke deposit, providing insights into the specific chemical structure and composition of the coke. The coke is typically composed of hydrocarbons, sulfur compounds, and other impurities, with the exact composition depending on factors such as the feedstock, catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and the duration of the reaction. By utilizing these advanced analytical tools, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the coke formation mechanisms and optimize the PDH process to enhance product selectivity and efficiency while minimizing coke buildup.
