[1] "In catalytic cracking, either fluid or fixed-bed, the extent of conversion is determined by such factors as catalyst, feed stock, temperature, pressure, feed rate, and length of time between catalyst regenerations (here called catalyst residence time)"
[2] "In fixed-bed cracking the conversion measured is the summation of the instantaneous conversions throughout the process period, the instantaneous conversions decreasing with time on stream as the catalyst becomes fouled with coke."
[3] "In fluid catalytic cracking the feed rate is generally expressed as weight of feed per hour per weight of catalyst held in the reactor or w/hr./w."
[4] "Another term employed in fluid cracking is the catalyst-to-oil ratio, which is the ratio of the weight rates of flow of catalyst and oil."
[5] "Data in fixed-bed and in fluid catalytic cracking are treated separately."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types due to the complex interplay between the feedstock, catalyst properties, and operational parameters. Analytical techniques such as chromatography, spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis have been employed to elucidate the diverse nature and complexity of coke constituents in these systems. These methods enable researchers to identify the molecular structure, functional groups, and elemental composition of coke deposits, providing insights into the reaction pathways and mechanisms involved in coke formation.
