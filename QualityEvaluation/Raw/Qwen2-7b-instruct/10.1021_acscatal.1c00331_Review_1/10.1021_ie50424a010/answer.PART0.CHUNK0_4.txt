There are no specific details provided in the literature regarding the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, under different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature focuses on the formation and accumulation of carbon deposits in catalytic cracking processes and their dependence on various factors such as catalyst, feedstock, temperature, pressure, feed rate, and catalyst residence time. Analytical techniques for elucidating the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents are not discussed in this context.
