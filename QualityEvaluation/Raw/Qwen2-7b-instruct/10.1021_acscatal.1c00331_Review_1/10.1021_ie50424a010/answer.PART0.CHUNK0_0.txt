[2] "A conspicuous exception is the case of high-pressure catalytic hydrogenation where the catalyst retains its activity for periods up to a year and longer without any regeneration (2)."

[3] "The carbonaceous deposit that is an inevitable by-product of catalytic cracking is called coke, and is generally determined as the weight per cent of carbon on feed or on catalyst."

[4] "Although the extent of carbon formation in catalytic cracking depends on the type of catalyst, the feed stock, and the operating conditions, it has been found that there is an intrinsic uniformity in the way the carbon deposit on the catalyst increases with time."

[5] "For all the data examined, the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst at given conditions is, within limits, independent of the hydrocarbon feed rate."

[6] "Certain generalized correlations of striking simplicity and considerable utility have resulted from a study of such data."

[7] "Data in fixed-bed and in fluid catalytic cracking are treated separately."

[8] "In fixed-bed cracking the weight per cent carbon formed on the catalyst is approximately a logarithmic function of the length of time elapsed since the catalyst was freshly regenerated."

[9] "It will be noted that, as the feed rate increases at a given temperature, the weight per cent carbon on feed decreases as might be expected, but the weight per cent carbon on catalyst remains substantially constant."

[10] "Much thought and speculation have been directed to answering the question as to why carbon on catalyst for a given residence time should be relatively independent of feed rate."

[11] "Consider what happens as the feed stock passes through the bed of catalyst. It is converted to an increasing extent into (a) gasoline and gas which have less tendency to carbonize than the original feed and (b) cycle gas oil which has more tendency to carbonize than the original feed."

[12] "This phenomenon is thus ascribed to a fortuitous balance between the carbonizing tendencies of the unconverted feed and the total products of reaction."

[13] "The data in Table I permit a study of the effect of temperature on carbon formation."

[14] "Figure 2 shows how carbon formation on catalyst increases with cracking temperature."

[15] "As indicated earlier, there is generally a good correlation between feed stock conversion and carbon yield based on feed for a given catalyst, feed stock, and temperature."

[16] "Figure 3 shows a fairly good linear correlation on log-log paper between conversion and carbon yield on feed."
