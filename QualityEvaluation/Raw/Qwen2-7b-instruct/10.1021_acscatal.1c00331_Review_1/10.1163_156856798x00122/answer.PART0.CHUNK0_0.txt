[1] "Both in the case of Pt/y Al203 and in the case of Cu/Na-ZSM-5, propene provided both higher conversion and coke deposition than propane in the presence or the absence ofO2 and/or NO."
[2] "For Pt/y AI203 catalyst, in the case of the absence of oxygen reactions, the propene conversion dropped more rapidly than the propane conversion."
[3] "Additionally, propene had a higher percent selectivity of coke formation for the reaction with the absence of oxygen, but propane had a higher percent selectivity of coke formation for the reaction with the presence of oxygen."
[4] "In the system with absence and presence of oxygen, the addition of oxygen caused a significant change in the % of coke selectivity."
[5] "With the presence of NOx, the percent conversion of both propane and propene decreased and that of the % coke selectivity of propane decreased, whereas that in propene increased."

1. In catalytic systems, especially during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the composition of coke deposits varies significantly based on different reaction conditions and catalyst types. These variations can be elucidated using analytical techniques such as temperature programmed oxidation (TPO).

2. In the absence of oxygen, the conversion rate of propene decreases more rapidly than propane. Propene tends to deposit more coke than propane under these conditions.

3. Propene shows a higher percentage selectivity for coke formation when reacting without oxygen, whereas propane exhibits a higher percentage selectivity for coke formation when reacting with oxygen present.

4. When oxygen is added to the system, there is a notable change in the selectivity of coke formation.

5. In the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx), the conversion rates of both propane and propene decrease, while the selectivity of coke formation for propane decreases, and it increases for propene.

1. 在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成根据不同的反应条件和催化剂类型有很大差异。这些差异可以通过温度程序氧化（TPO）等分析技术进行阐明。

2. 在没有氧气的情况下，丙烯的转化速率比丙烷更快地下降。丙烯在无氧条件下倾向于沉积更多的焦炭。

3. 丙烯在无氧反应下对焦炭形成具有更高的百分比选择性，而丙烷在有氧存在时对焦炭形成具有更高的百分比选择性。

4. 当添加氧气到系统中时，焦炭形成的选择性会发生显著变化。

5. 在氮氧化物（NOx）的存在下，丙烷和丙烯的转化率降低，而丙烷的焦炭形成选择性降低，丙烯的焦炭形成选择性增加。
