1. In catalytic systems, especially during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the composition of coke deposits varies significantly based on different reaction conditions and catalyst types. These variations can be elucidated using analytical techniques such as temperature programmed oxidation (TPO).

2. In the absence of oxygen, the conversion rate of propene decreases more rapidly than propane. Propene tends to deposit more coke than propane under these conditions.

3. Propene shows a higher percentage selectivity for coke formation when reacting without oxygen, whereas propane exhibits a higher percentage selectivity for coke formation when reacting with oxygen present.

4. When oxygen is added to the system, there is a notable change in the selectivity of coke formation.

5. In the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx), the conversion rates of both propane and propene decrease, while the selectivity of coke formation for propane decreases, and it increases for propene.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems varies significantly based on the type of catalyst, reaction conditions, and the presence of oxygen or nitrogen oxides. In propane dehydrogenation reactions, propene leads to higher conversion rates and coke deposition compared to propane. Specifically, propene exhibits higher coke selectivity in reactions without oxygen, whereas propane shows higher selectivity in reactions with oxygen present. The introduction of oxygen into the system significantly alters the coke selectivity. Moreover, when nitrogen oxides are included in the reaction mix, both propane and propene conversions decrease, but propene shows an increased coke selectivity compared to propane.

催化系统中的焦炭沉积物的组成在催化剂类型、反应条件和氧气或氮氧化物的存在与否方面存在显著差异。在丙烷脱氢反应中，丙烯的转化率和焦炭沉积量均高于丙烷。具体来说，在无氧条件下，丙烯显示出更高的焦炭选择性，而氧气存在的条件下则显示出较高的丙烷选择性。将氧气引入系统会显著改变焦炭选择性。此外，当氮氧化物包含在反应混合物中时，丙烷和丙烯的转化率都会降低，但丙烯的焦炭选择性相对于丙烷有所增加。

1. The reactions involving propene showed a higher percentage of hydrocarbon conversion in the initial stages compared to those using propane. This indicates that propene is more reactive in these reactions.
2. Propadiene, produced from propene under oxygen-free conditions, reacts irreversibly to form ethylidyne, leading to coke deposition. This product is more reactive than propene itself.
3. In catalytic reactions, propene led to a faster accumulation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface compared to propane.
4. When oxygen was present during the reactions, coke formation occurred concurrently with the production of carbon dioxide.
5. Propene conversions were found to be higher than those of propane in various catalytic reactions.
6. The amount of coke formed from propene reactions was significantly greater than that from propane reactions over Cu/Na-ZSM-5 zeolite.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. When oxygen is absent, propene provides both higher conversion rates and higher coke deposition compared to propane. Propadiene, a product of propene under oxygen-free conditions, is more reactive and leads to coke deposition. In the presence of oxygen, coke formation occurs concurrently with carbon dioxide production. In aromatization processes, propene converts to products more efficiently than propane, resulting in lower coke selectivity. Oxygen addition significantly impacts coke selectivity, both positively and negatively, depending on the reaction conditions. Catalysts like Cu/Na-ZSM-5 show distinct differences in coke selectivity when oxygen is present or absent.

在不同反应条件和催化剂类型下，催化系统中焦炭沉积物的组成在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中变化显著。在无氧条件下，丙烯提供更高的转化率和更高的焦炭沉积量，相比丙烷。在无氧条件下，丙烯的产物丙二烯更为活跃，导致焦炭沉积。当存在氧气时，焦炭形成与二氧化碳生成同时进行。在异构化过程中，丙烯比丙烷更有效地转化为产品，导致焦炭选择性较低。氧气的添加对焦炭选择性产生显著影响，具体取决于反应条件。如Cu/Na-ZSM-5等催化剂，在氧气存在或不存在的情况下，显示出焦炭选择性的明显差异。
