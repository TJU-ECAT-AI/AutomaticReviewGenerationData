[1] "It was found that both the case ofPt/y Al20 and the case ofCu/Na-ZSM-5, propene provided higher conversion and coke deposition than propane in the presence or the absence of O2 and/or NO."
[2] "Additionally, propene had a higher percent selectivity of coke formation for the reaction with the absence of oxygen, but propane had a higher percent selectivity of coke formation for the reaction with the presence of oxygen."
[3] "In the system with absence and presence of oxygen, the addition of oxygen caused a significant change in the % of coke selectivity."
[4] "With the presence of NOx, the percent conversion of both propane and propene decreased and that of the % coke selectivity of propane decreased, whereas that in propene increased."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems varies significantly based on the type of catalyst, reaction conditions, and the presence of oxygen or nitrogen oxides. In propane dehydrogenation reactions, propene leads to higher conversion rates and coke deposition compared to propane. Specifically, propene exhibits higher coke selectivity in reactions without oxygen, whereas propane shows higher selectivity in reactions with oxygen present. The introduction of oxygen into the system significantly alters the coke selectivity. Moreover, when nitrogen oxides are included in the reaction mix, both propane and propene conversions decrease, but propene shows an increased coke selectivity compared to propane.

催化系统中的焦炭沉积物的组成在催化剂类型、反应条件和氧气或氮氧化物的存在与否方面存在显著差异。在丙烷脱氢反应中，丙烯的转化率和焦炭沉积量均高于丙烷。具体来说，在无氧条件下，丙烯显示出更高的焦炭选择性，而氧气存在的条件下则显示出较高的丙烷选择性。将氧气引入系统会显著改变焦炭选择性。此外，当氮氧化物包含在反应混合物中时，丙烷和丙烯的转化率都会降低，但丙烯的焦炭选择性相对于丙烷有所增加。
