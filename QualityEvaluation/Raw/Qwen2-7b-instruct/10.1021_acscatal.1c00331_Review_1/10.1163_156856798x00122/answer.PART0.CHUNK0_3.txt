[1] "In all four reactions, it was observed that the reactions with propene as a reactant gave a larger percent of hydrocarbon conversion in the initial interval of time on stream."
[2] "Additionally, it was clarified that the product of propene from the reaction with the absence of oxygen, propadiene which is converted irreversibly to ethylidyne leading to coke deposition, was more reactive than propene."
[3] "Thus the catalysts in the reaction using propene as a reactant were rapidly covered by carbonaceous deposits."
[4] "Under the presence of oxygen, it suggested that coke is formed in parallel with carbon dioxide formation."
[5] "It was found that the propene conversion was higher than that of propane."
[6] "The temperature program oxidation (TPO) results were shown in Figure 4. It was found that the amount of coke from the four reactions of propene was greater than propane over Cu/Na-ZSM-5 zeolite."

1. The reactions involving propene showed a higher percentage of hydrocarbon conversion in the initial stages compared to those using propane. This indicates that propene is more reactive in these reactions.
2. Propadiene, produced from propene under oxygen-free conditions, reacts irreversibly to form ethylidyne, leading to coke deposition. This product is more reactive than propene itself.
3. In catalytic reactions, propene led to a faster accumulation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface compared to propane.
4. When oxygen was present during the reactions, coke formation occurred concurrently with the production of carbon dioxide.
5. Propene conversions were found to be higher than those of propane in various catalytic reactions.
6. The amount of coke formed from propene reactions was significantly greater than that from propane reactions over Cu/Na-ZSM-5 zeolite.

1. 在所有四种反应中，使用丙烯作为反应物的反应在初始时间段内显示出更高的烃类转化率。
2. 丙二烯，在无氧条件下从丙烯产生并不可逆地转化为乙烯基，是导致结焦的活性物质，比丙烯本身更活跃。
3. 在催化反应中，丙烯导致催化剂表面更快积累碳质沉积物，而丙烷则不那么明显。
4. 当存在氧气时，结焦与二氧化碳形成同时发生。
5. 丙烯的转化率高于丙烷在各种催化反应中的转化率。
6. 丙烯反应产生的结焦量远大于丙烷反应在Cu/Na-ZSM-5沸石上产生的结焦量。
