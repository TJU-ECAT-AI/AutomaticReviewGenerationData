[1] "In all four reactions, it was observed that the reactions with propene as a reactant gave a larger percent of hydrocarbon conversion in the initial interval of time on stream and also had a larger amount of coke than the reactions with propane as a reactant."
[2] "Additionally, it was clarified that the product of propene from the reaction with the absence of oxygen, propadiene which is converted irreversibly to ethylidyne leading to coke deposition [7,8], was more reactive than propene [6]."
[3] "Under the presence of oxygen, it suggested that coke is formed in parallel with carbon dioxide formation."
[4] "It was found that in aromatization, the percentage of propene conversion was greater than that of propane; however, on the other hand, the % coke selectivity ofpropene was less than that of propane, because propene was converted to product more than to coke while propane formed product less than coke."
[5] "With the presence of oxygen, the addition of oxygen caused a significant change in % of coke selectivity [13-15]."
[6] "In the system with absence and presence of oxygen it was found that the addition of oxygen caused a significant change in % of coke selectivity [13-15]."
[7] "For Cu/Na-ZSM-5, in the system with absence and presence of oxygen, the addition of oxygen caused a significant change in % of coke selectivity."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. When oxygen is absent, propene provides both higher conversion rates and higher coke deposition compared to propane. Propadiene, a product of propene under oxygen-free conditions, is more reactive and leads to coke deposition. In the presence of oxygen, coke formation occurs concurrently with carbon dioxide production. In aromatization processes, propene converts to products more efficiently than propane, resulting in lower coke selectivity. Oxygen addition significantly impacts coke selectivity, both positively and negatively, depending on the reaction conditions. Catalysts like Cu/Na-ZSM-5 show distinct differences in coke selectivity when oxygen is present or absent.

在不同反应条件和催化剂类型下，催化系统中焦炭沉积物的组成在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中变化显著。在无氧条件下，丙烯提供更高的转化率和更高的焦炭沉积量，相比丙烷。在无氧条件下，丙烯的产物丙二烯更为活跃，导致焦炭沉积。当存在氧气时，焦炭形成与二氧化碳生成同时进行。在异构化过程中，丙烯比丙烷更有效地转化为产品，导致焦炭选择性较低。氧气的添加对焦炭选择性产生显著影响，具体取决于反应条件。如Cu/Na-ZSM-5等催化剂，在氧气存在或不存在的情况下，显示出焦炭选择性的明显差异。
