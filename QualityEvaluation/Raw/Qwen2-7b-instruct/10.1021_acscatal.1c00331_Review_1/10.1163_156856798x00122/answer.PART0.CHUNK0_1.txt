[1] "In all four reactions, it was observed that the reactions with propene as a reactant gave a larger percent of hydrocarbon conversion in the initial interval of time on stream and also"
[2] "Additionally, it was clarified that the product of propene from the reaction with the absence of oxygen, propadiene which is converted irreversibly to ethylidyne leading to coke deposition"
[3] "It meant that propene is more active than propane [6]"
[4] "Under the presence of oxygen, it suggested that coke is formed in parallel with carbon dioxide formation"
[5] "It was found that the amount of coke from the four reactions of propene was greater than propane over Cu/Na-ZSM-5 zeolite."
[6] "In the case of propene (b,d), amount of coked catalyst for TPO is five times than that of propane."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. In all four reactions, the use of propene resulted in a higher percentage of hydrocarbon conversion during the initial period of the reaction compared to propane. 
2. The product of propene, propadiene, undergoes irreversible conversion to ethylidyne, leading to coke deposition under oxygen-free conditions.
3. Propene is identified as a more reactive substance than propane in these reactions.
4. When oxygen is present, coke formation occurs concurrently with the formation of carbon dioxide.
5. The amount of coke produced in reactions involving propene was found to be significantly greater than that produced by propane when using Cu/Na-ZSM-5 zeolite.
6. The quantity of coked catalyst resulting from propene reactions, as determined by TPO analysis, was found to be five times that of propane reactions.

1. 在所有四种反应中，使用丙烯作为反应物时，在初始反应时间内，烃类转化率高于丙烷。
2. 丙烯在无氧条件下产生的产物丙二烯不可逆转化为乙烯基，导致结焦。
3. 结果表明，丙烯比丙烷更具有反应活性。
4. 当存在氧气时，结焦与二氧化碳形成同时发生。
5. 在使用Cu/Na-ZSM-5沸石的情况下，丙烯反应产生的焦炭量显著大于丙烷反应产生的焦炭量。
6. 根据TPO分析，丙烯反应形成的结焦催化剂的数量是丙烷反应形成的五倍。
