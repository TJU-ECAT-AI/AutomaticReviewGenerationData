The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke deposits are noncatalytic and form irreversibly. Their density is typically set within a range reported in the literature. The complexity of the coking process increases when large pores are surrounded by plugged pores, rendering them inaccessible to reactants. A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, causing sudden changes in macroscopic properties like effective diffusivity and observed reaction rates. To address these complexities, a proper mathematical model is required to investigate coking and deactivation processes at the particle level.

The coking rate per unit pore surface area (Rc) is derived from literature sources, indicating how coke forms on the surface of the catalyst particles. Kirchhoff's Law for currents is satisfied in an inner node, reflecting the electrical behavior of the network of pores and nodes.

催化系统中的焦炭沉积物，尤其是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，其组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有所不同。焦炭是非催化性的，并且形成不可逆的。它们的密度通常设置在文献报告的范围内。当大孔被堵塞孔包围并变得对反应物不可达时，焦炭沉积过程的复杂性增加。当未打开或开放孔隙的比例低于临界阈值时，会发生所谓的渗透现象，导致宏观性质（例如有效扩散性和观察到的反应速率）突然变化。为了应对这些复杂性，需要一个适当数学模型来探究颗粒级别的焦化和失活过程。

从文献来源得出，单位孔表面面积的焦化率（Rc）表明催化剂颗粒表面上焦化的形成情况。内节点遵循Kirchhoff电流定律，反映了孔网络和节点的电气行为。
