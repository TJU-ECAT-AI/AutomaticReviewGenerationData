[1] "We find that the deactivation process can be separated into two stages when there exist severe diffusion limitation and pore blockage, and the toxicity of coke formed in the later stage is much stronger than of coke formed in the early stage."
[2] "The reaction temperature and composition change the coking rate and apparent reaction rate, informed by the kinetics, but, remarkably, they do not change the capacity for a catalyst particle to accommodate coke."
[3] "Conversely, the pore network structure significantly affects the capacity to contain coke."
[4] "The process of coking and deactivation in a catalyst particle is very complex. Coke can be nonuniformly distributed through the catalyst particle, and the distribution of coke is largely affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The deactivation process can be divided into two stages based on the severity of diffusion limitations and pore blockage. The toxicity of coke formed in the latter stage is notably higher than that in the earlier stage. Reaction temperature and composition impact the coking rate and apparent reaction rate, but they do not alter the catalyst particle's capacity to accommodate coke. Instead, the pore network structure plays a crucial role in determining the capacity to contain coke. Coke deposits are often unevenly distributed throughout the catalyst particle, and this distribution is influenced by both the pore network structure and reaction conditions.

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而显著变化。去活过程可以分为两个阶段，基于严重的扩散限制和孔堵塞情况。后期形成的焦炭的毒性远大于早期形成的焦炭。反应温度和组成会影响结焦速率和表观反应速率，但它们不会改变催化剂颗粒容纳焦炭的能力。相反，孔网络结构在决定容纳焦炭的能力方面起着关键作用。焦炭在催化剂颗粒中的分布通常是不均匀的，并且受孔网络结构和反应条件的影响。

[1] "Coke is assumed to be noncatalytic and its formation is irreversible; the density of coke is set to 1200 kg/m3, which is within the range reported in the literature."
[2] "Some large pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity of the coking process."
[3] "A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of unplugged or open pores drops below a critical threshold, in which the previously connected, particle-spanning cluster of open pores becomes disconnected."
[4] "In this case, macroscopic properties (e.g., effective diffusivity and the observed reaction rates) would experience a sudden change."
[5] "Consideration of the above complications, a proper mathematical model is needed to probe coking and deactivation at the particle level, which is what this article sets out to do."
[6] "In an inner node, due to the zero-volume assumption, Kirchhoffs Law for currents is satisfied: XnZ n1πr2 nJi,n  0"
[7] "The coking rate per unit pore surface area (Rc) is adopted from the literature16: Rc  dCc dt  ac kcPC3H6"

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke deposits are noncatalytic and form irreversibly. Their density is typically set within a range reported in the literature. The complexity of the coking process increases when large pores are surrounded by plugged pores, rendering them inaccessible to reactants. A percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, causing sudden changes in macroscopic properties like effective diffusivity and observed reaction rates. To address these complexities, a proper mathematical model is required to investigate coking and deactivation processes at the particle level.

The coking rate per unit pore surface area (Rc) is derived from literature sources, indicating how coke forms on the surface of the catalyst particles. Kirchhoff's Law for currents is satisfied in an inner node, reflecting the electrical behavior of the network of pores and nodes.

催化系统中的焦炭沉积物，尤其是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，其组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有所不同。焦炭是非催化性的，并且形成不可逆的。它们的密度通常设置在文献报告的范围内。当大孔被堵塞孔包围并变得对反应物不可达时，焦炭沉积过程的复杂性增加。当未打开或开放孔隙的比例低于临界阈值时，会发生所谓的渗透现象，导致宏观性质（例如有效扩散性和观察到的反应速率）突然变化。为了应对这些复杂性，需要一个适当数学模型来探究颗粒级别的焦化和失活过程。

从文献来源得出，单位孔表面面积的焦化率（Rc）表明催化剂颗粒表面上焦化的形成情况。内节点遵循Kirchhoff电流定律，反映了孔网络和节点的电气行为。

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke formed during PDH reactions is noncatalytic and irreversible. Its density is typically set at 1200 kg/m3, a value consistent with literature reports. The distribution of coke within a catalyst particle is complex and influenced by the pore network structure and reaction conditions. Coke can lead to a nonuniform distribution throughout the particle, affecting active sites and increasing diffusion resistance. This can result in a significant loss of activity, not only by covering active sites but also by narrowing and plugging pores, making them inaccessible to reactants. Additionally, a percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of open pores falls below a critical threshold, leading to a sudden change in macroscopic properties such as effective diffusivity and observed reaction rates. This critical point is referred to as the percolation threshold.

催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下变化显著。PDH过程中形成的焦炭是非催化剂且不可逆的。其密度通常设定为1200 kg/m3，这一数值与文献报道相符。焦炭在催化剂颗粒内的分布非常复杂，受孔隙网络结构和反应条件的影响。焦炭可能导致颗粒内非均匀分布，影响活性位点并增加扩散阻力。这不仅通过覆盖活性位点导致活性损失，还通过焦炭缩窄和堵塞孔隙，使得孔隙对反应物变得不可达，进一步造成活性损失。此外，当未开启或开放孔隙的比例低于一个临界阈值时，会发生一种称为渗透现象的现象。在这种情况下，之前贯穿整个颗粒的开放孔隙集群会断开连接。这个临界开放孔隙比例被称为渗透阈值。

[1] "For propane dehydrogenation, coking and deactivation at the active site level and the reactor level were extensively investigated. Many density functional theory calculations10-13 were performed to probe pathways and mechanisms of coke formation over active sites; some kinetic experiments14-18 were also conducted to correlate deactivation with coking in a quan- titative way."
