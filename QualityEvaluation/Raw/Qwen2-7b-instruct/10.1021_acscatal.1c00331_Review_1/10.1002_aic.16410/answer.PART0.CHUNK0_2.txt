[1] "Coke is assumed to be noncatalytic and its formation is irreversible; the density of coke is set to 1200 kg/m3, which is within the range reported in the literature."
[2] "The process of coking and deactivation in a catalyst particle is very complex. Coke can be nonuniformly distributed through the catalyst particle, and the distribution of coke is largely affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions."
[3] "Some large pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity of the coking process."
[4] "In addition, a percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of unplugged or open pores drops below a critical threshold, in which the previously connected, particle-spanning cluster of open pores becomes disconnected."
[5] "This critical fraction of open pores is known as the percolation threshold."
[6] "Finally, coke deactivates catalyst particles in several ways, not just by covering active sites; a significant loss in activity can also be caused by the increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke formed during PDH reactions is noncatalytic and irreversible. Its density is typically set at 1200 kg/m3, a value consistent with literature reports. The distribution of coke within a catalyst particle is complex and influenced by the pore network structure and reaction conditions. Coke can lead to a nonuniform distribution throughout the particle, affecting active sites and increasing diffusion resistance. This can result in a significant loss of activity, not only by covering active sites but also by narrowing and plugging pores, making them inaccessible to reactants. Additionally, a percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of open pores falls below a critical threshold, leading to a sudden change in macroscopic properties such as effective diffusivity and observed reaction rates. This critical point is referred to as the percolation threshold.

催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下变化显著。PDH过程中形成的焦炭是非催化剂且不可逆的。其密度通常设定为1200 kg/m3，这一数值与文献报道相符。焦炭在催化剂颗粒内的分布非常复杂，受孔隙网络结构和反应条件的影响。焦炭可能导致颗粒内非均匀分布，影响活性位点并增加扩散阻力。这不仅通过覆盖活性位点导致活性损失，还通过焦炭缩窄和堵塞孔隙，使得孔隙对反应物变得不可达，进一步造成活性损失。此外，当未开启或开放孔隙的比例低于一个临界阈值时，会发生一种称为渗透现象的现象。在这种情况下，之前贯穿整个颗粒的开放孔隙集群会断开连接。这个临界开放孔隙比例被称为渗透阈值。
