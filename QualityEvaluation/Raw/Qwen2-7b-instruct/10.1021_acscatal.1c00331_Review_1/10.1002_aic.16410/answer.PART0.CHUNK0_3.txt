[1] "For propane dehydrogenation, coking and deactivation at the active site level and the reactor level were extensively investigated. Many density functional theory calculations10-13 were performed to probe pathways and mechanisms of coke formation over active sites; some kinetic experiments14-18 were also conducted to correlate deactivation with coking in a quan- titative way."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies based on different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature discusses extensive investigations into coking and deactivation at the active site level and the reactor level for PDH. Techniques such as density functional theory calculations and kinetic experiments have been employed to understand the pathways and mechanisms of coke formation over active sites and to quantitatively correlate deactivation with coking.

在催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成会根据不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。文献讨论了对PDH中活性位点水平和反应器水平的焦炭化和失活的广泛研究。采用密度泛函理论计算和动力学实验等技术来理解活性位点上焦炭形成途径和机制，并定量地将失活与焦炭化相关联。
