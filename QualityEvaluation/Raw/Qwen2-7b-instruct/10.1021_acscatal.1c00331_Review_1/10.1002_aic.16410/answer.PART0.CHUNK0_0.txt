[1] "We find that the deactivation process can be separated into two stages when there exist severe diffusion limitation and pore blockage, and the toxicity of coke formed in the later stage is much stronger than of coke formed in the early stage."
[2] "The reaction temperature and composition change the coking rate and apparent reaction rate, informed by the kinetics, but, remarkably, they do not change the capacity for a catalyst particle to accommodate coke."
[3] "Conversely, the pore network structure significantly affects the capacity to contain coke."
[4] "The process of coking and deactivation in a catalyst particle is very complex. Coke can be nonuniformly distributed through the catalyst particle, and the distribution of coke is largely affected by the pore network structure and reaction conditions."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The deactivation process can be divided into two stages based on the severity of diffusion limitations and pore blockage. The toxicity of coke formed in the latter stage is notably higher than that in the earlier stage. Reaction temperature and composition impact the coking rate and apparent reaction rate, but they do not alter the catalyst particle's capacity to accommodate coke. Instead, the pore network structure plays a crucial role in determining the capacity to contain coke. Coke deposits are often unevenly distributed throughout the catalyst particle, and this distribution is influenced by both the pore network structure and reaction conditions.

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而显著变化。去活过程可以分为两个阶段，基于严重的扩散限制和孔堵塞情况。后期形成的焦炭的毒性远大于早期形成的焦炭。反应温度和组成会影响结焦速率和表观反应速率，但它们不会改变催化剂颗粒容纳焦炭的能力。相反，孔网络结构在决定容纳焦炭的能力方面起着关键作用。焦炭在催化剂颗粒中的分布通常是不均匀的，并且受孔网络结构和反应条件的影响。
