[1] "Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[2] "The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation."
[3] "The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane."
[4] "Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles."
[5] "Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms."

1. During propane dehydrogenation, less coke was formed compared to ethane dehydrogenation. There was no direct correlation between the amount of coke formed and the deactivation of the catalyst.
2. The addition of Ga to the catalyst suppressed the formation of coke.
3. The greater deactivation observed in propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of the active Pt particles by coke precursors from propane rather than ethane.
4. It was concluded that most of the coke deposits reside on the support, with only a small portion on the surface of the Pt particles.
5. The accumulation of coke with time on stream was greater for ethane dehydrogenation, and the quantity of carbon deposited on the catalyst was significantly higher than the amount of exposed Pt atoms.

1. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，形成的焦炭量少于乙烷脱氢。焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间没有直接相关性。
2. 添加Ga到催化剂中抑制了焦炭的形成。
3. 烯烃脱氢过程中催化剂失活程度较高的原因在于，丙烷来源的焦炭前体在活性铂颗粒上的覆盖度高于乙烷。
4. 结论是大部分焦炭沉积物位于支撑体上，只有少量位于铂颗粒表面。
5. 时间随流下焦炭积累更多发生在乙烷脱氢过程中，沉积在催化剂上的碳量远高于暴露的铂原子数量。
