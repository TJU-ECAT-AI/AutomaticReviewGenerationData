[1] "Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[2] "The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane."
[3] "Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles."
[4] "It has been shown that the overall amount of coke formed is greater during ethane dehydrogenation than during propane, but the deactivation is greater during propane dehydrogenation than during ethane; therefore, the total amount of coke formed cannot be responsible for the increased deactivation."

1. The formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation is less than during ethane dehydrogenation. No correlation was found between the amount of coke formed and the degree of catalyst deactivation.
2. The greater degree of catalyst deactivation observed in propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane is attributed to a higher coverage of platinum by coke precursors derived from propane.
3. The majority of the coke deposited during dehydrogenation processes is found on the support rather than on the platinum particles. The amount of coke is greater than the exposed surface area of platinum.
4. Although more coke is formed during ethane dehydrogenation, the deactivation is greater in propane dehydrogenation. This discrepancy indicates that factors other than the total amount of coke formed are responsible for the increased deactivation.

1. 烷烃脱氢过程中，丙烷脱氢产生的焦炭量少于乙烷。没有发现焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间的相关性。
2. 丙烷脱氢过程中的催化剂失活程度高于乙烷，这归因于来自丙烷的焦炭前体在铂表面覆盖得更多。
3. 脱氢过程中沉积的焦炭主要存在于支撑体上，而不是铂颗粒上。焦炭的量大于暴露的铂表面积。
4. 尽管在乙烷脱氢过程中形成的焦炭量更多，但丙烷脱氢过程中的失活程度更大。这种差异表明导致失活增加的因素不仅仅是焦炭形成的总数量。
