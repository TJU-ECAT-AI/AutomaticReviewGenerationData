[1] "The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation."
[2] "Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane."
[4] "The lack of correlation between extent of deactivation and carbon formation suggests that only a small fraction of the accumulated coke resides on the surface of the Pt particles and that the bulk accumulates on the support."
[5] "The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propyliyne compared to ethylidyne."
[6] "The disparity between decreased coke formation and increased deactivation observed during propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a greater coverage of the surface of the active metal particle by coke."

1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Coke formation is suppressed by the presence of Ga. Less coke forms during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane, and there's no direct correlation between coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

2. The reason for higher deactivation during propane dehydrogenation is that more coke precursors are adsorbed onto the Pt surface from propane than from ethane. 

3. Coke buildup on the catalyst surface is not directly correlated with the degree of deactivation. Only a small portion of the accumulated coke resides on the surface of the Pt particles, while the rest accumulates on the support.

4. The ease of hydrogenation of propyliyne over ethylidyne explains why less coke is formed during propane dehydrogenation.

5. The difference between decreased coke formation and increased deactivation during propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a greater coverage of the active metal surface by coke.

1. 催化剂系统中焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有所不同。镓的存在抑制了焦炭的形成。丙烷脱氢过程中形成的焦炭少于乙烷，焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间没有直接关联。

2. 烷烃脱氢过程中催化剂失活较高的原因是从丙烷到铂表面吸附的焦炭前体比从乙烷多。

3. 焦炭在催化剂表面上的积累与活性损失之间没有直接相关性。只有少量累积的焦炭存在于铂颗粒表面，而大部分积累在支撑上。

4. 丙炔比乙炔更容易氢化，这是为什么在丙烷脱氢过程中形成的焦炭较少的原因。

5. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，焦炭形成减少而失活增加之间的差异归因于活性金属表面焦炭覆盖度较高。
