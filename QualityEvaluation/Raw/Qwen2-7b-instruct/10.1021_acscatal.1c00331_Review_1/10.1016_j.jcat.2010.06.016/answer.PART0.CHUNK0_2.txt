[1] "The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane."
[2] "The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation. Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms."
[4] "The lack of correlation between extent of deactivation and carbon formation suggests that only a small fraction of the accumulated coke resides on the surface of the Pt particles and that the bulk accumulates on the support."
[5] "The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propyliyne compared to ethylidyne."

1. The higher deactivation in propane dehydrogenation is due to more coke precursors bonding to the platinum surface from propane than from ethane.
2. Adding gallium (Ga) to the catalyst reduced coke formation, showing less coke was produced during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no link was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation.
3. Accumulation of coke is more pronounced in ethane dehydrogenation compared to propane dehydrogenation, with significantly more carbon deposited on the catalyst in relation to the exposed platinum atoms.
4. The lack of correlation between deactivation and coke formation indicates that only a small portion of the coke resides on the surface of the platinum particles, with the majority accumulating on the support.
5. The lesser coke formation during propane dehydrogenation is explained by the easier hydrogenation of propyliyne compared to ethylidyne.

1. 在丙烷脱氢过程中观察到的较高失活是由于从丙烷到铂表面的焦炭前体比从乙烷多。
2. 添加镓（Ga）减少了焦炭形成，显示出在丙烷脱氢过程中产生的焦炭少于乙烷脱氢，且没有找到焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间的联系。
3. 焦炭积累在乙烷脱氢中的情况比在丙烷脱氢中更为明显，催化剂上沉积的碳量远高于暴露的铂原子。
4. 焦炭形成和失活之间缺乏相关性表明只有少量的焦炭存在于铂颗粒的表面上，大部分积聚在支撑物上。
5. 丙烷脱氢过程中较少的焦炭形成是由于丙烯基氢化比乙基氢化更容易进行。
