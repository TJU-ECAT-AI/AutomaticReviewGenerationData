The composition of coke deposits varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types in propane dehydrogenation reactions. This variation impacts the selectivity and stability of the catalytic systems. Analytical techniques, including temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents. The coke formation affects the catalytic performance by altering the electronic structure of the Pt surface, leading to deactivation of the catalyst.

In the context of the provided literature, the composition of coke deposits is influenced by the shape of Pt nanoparticles. Octahedral particles (12.0 nm) dominated by the Pt(1 1 1) surface show higher selectivity toward propylene production and better stability compared to cubic particles (11.5 nm) dominated by the Pt(1 0 0) surface. The DFT calculations suggest that the weakened binding strength of propylene and increased energy barrier for the CH bond cleavage on the Pt(1 1 1) surface contribute to the higher selectivity toward propylene. This is because it lowers the formation possibility of deeply dehydrated intermediates.

The deactivation of the Pt catalyst occurs when coke is formed on the surface, shifting the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms farther below the Fermi level. This leads to the deactivation of the Pt catalyst.

在丙烷脱氢反应中，焦炭沉积的组成因不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而异。这种变化影响催化系统的选择性和稳定性。已经使用了诸如程序升温氧化（TPO）等分析技术来阐明焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性。焦炭形成会影响催化性能，通过改变Pt表面的电子结构导致催化剂失效。

在提供的文献背景下，焦炭沉积的组成受铂纳米颗粒形状的影响。由12.0 nm的八面体粒子主导的Pt(1 1 1)表面显示出更高的丙烯选择性和更好的稳定性，与由11.5 nm的立方体粒子主导的Pt(1 0 0)表面相比。DFT计算表明，在Pt(1 1 1)表面上丙烯的结合力减弱以及CH键断裂的能量壁垒增加，对丙烯的选择性有贡献。这是因为降低了深层脱水中间体的形成可能性。

当焦炭形成在Pt表面时，周围的Pt原子的d带被进一步推至费米能级以下。这导致Pt催化剂的失效。
