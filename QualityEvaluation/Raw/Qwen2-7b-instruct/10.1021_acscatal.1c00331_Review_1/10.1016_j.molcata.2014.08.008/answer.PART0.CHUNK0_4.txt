1. When coke deposits form on the Pt surface, the energy levels of the surrounding Pt atoms are pushed further below the Fermi level, causing the Pt catalyst to deactivate.
2. Our DFT calculations offer a logical explanation for the observed impacts of catalyst shape on propane dehydrogenation processes.
3. By shaping Pt nanoparticles, the selectivity towards propylene and the stability of the catalyst in propane dehydrogenation can be improved under industrial conditions.
4. The adsorption energy of propylene in the di- mode is 1.22 eV, 0.15 eV more negative than when in the <i>end</i> mode.
5. In the adsorption mode, the deformation energy of propylene (Edef,mol) is notably lower than in the di-bonding configuration on both surfaces.
6. On Pt(1 0 0), the activation energies for the first and second dehydrogenation steps (Steps 1 and 2) are lower compared to Pt(1 1 1).

1. 当焦炭沉积在铂表面时，周围铂原子的能量水平会进一步低于费米能级，导致铂催化剂失活。
2. 我们的DFT计算为观察到的催化剂形状对丙烷脱氢作用的影响提供了合理的解释。
3. 通过塑造铂纳米粒子，在工业条件下可以提高丙烷脱氢过程中的丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。
4. 丙烷在di-模式下的吸附能为1.22 eV，比在<end>模式下高0.15 eV。
5. 在吸附模式下，丙烷的变形能（Edef,mol）在两个表面上的两个配置中都显著较低。
6. 对于Pt(1 0 0)，第一个和第二个脱氢步骤（步骤1和2）的激活能与Pt(1 1 1)相比更低。
