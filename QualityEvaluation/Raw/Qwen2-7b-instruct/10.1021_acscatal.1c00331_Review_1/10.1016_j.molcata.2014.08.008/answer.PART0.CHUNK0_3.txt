[1] "When coke is formed on the Pt surface, the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms is shifted farther below the Fermi level, leading to the deactivation of Pt catalyst."
[2] "Combined experiments and DFT calculations suggest that the weakened binding strength of propylene and increased energy barrier for the CH bond cleavage in propylene dehydrogenation on Pt(1 1 1) compared to Pt(1 0 0) and Pt(2 1 1) contribute to the higher selectivity toward propylene by lowering the formation possibility of the deeply dehy- drogenated intermediates."

1. Coke deposition on the Pt surface causes the surrounding Pt atoms' d-band to shift further below the Fermi level, resulting in the deactivation of the Pt catalyst.

2. The DFT calculations reveal that the reduced binding strength of propylene and increased energy barrier for CH bond cleavage on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, compared to Pt(1 0 0) and Pt(2 1 1), leads to a higher selectivity towards propylene by decreasing the formation probability of deeply dehydrogenated intermediates.

1. 当焦炭沉积在铂表面时，周围铂原子的d带向费米能级下方移动更远，导致铂催化剂失效。

2. 计算表明，与Pt(1 0 0)和Pt(2 1 1)相比，在Pt(1 1 1)表面上，丙烯的结合强度减弱以及CH键裂解的能垒增加，这降低了形成深度脱氢中间体的可能性，从而提高了丙烯的选择性。
