[1] "The selectivity toward propylene and catalyst stability in propane dehydrogenation can be enhanced by shaping Pt nanoparticles under industrially relevant conditions."
[2] "The selectivity toward propylene is lower on the cubic particles than that on the octahedral ones."
[3] "It should be noted that the TOFs were estimated based on Pt surface area of the fresh catalysts measured by H2 chemisorption."
[4] "The rates for coke formation were estimated to be 4.3 and 2.8 mg (g surface Pt)−1 ks−1 on the cubic and octahedral Pt nanoparticles, respectively, on the basis of the amount of coke measured by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO)."
[5] "As a result of coke formation, the activities for propylene formation on the cubic and octahedral particles dropped by 33% and 22% in less than 3 h, respectively."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques such as temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. For instance, the rates for coke formation on different types of Pt nanoparticles, such as cubic and octahedral, were estimated to be 4.3 and 2.8 mg (g surface Pt)^(-1) ks^(-1), respectively. As a consequence of coke formation, the activities for propylene formation on the cubic and octahedral particles dropped by 33% and 22% within less than 3 hours, respectively. This demonstrates how the composition of coke deposits affects the catalytic performance and selectivity in PDH reactions.

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成根据反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。通过温度程序氧化（TPO）等分析技术，可以揭示这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性。例如，不同类型的铂纳米颗粒（如立方体和八面体）上焦炭形成的速率估计分别为4.3和2.8 mg（g表面铂）^(-1) ks^(-1)。由于焦炭形成，立方体和八面体颗粒中丙烯生成的活性分别在不到3小时内下降了33%和22%。这表明焦炭沉积物的组成如何影响PDH反应的催化性能和选择性。
