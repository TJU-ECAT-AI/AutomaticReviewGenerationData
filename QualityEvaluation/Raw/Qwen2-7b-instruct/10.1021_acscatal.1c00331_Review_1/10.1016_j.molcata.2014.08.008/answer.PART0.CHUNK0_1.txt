[1] "Catalyst selectivity toward propylene and catalyst stability in propane dehydrogenation can be enhanced by shaping Pt nanoparticles under industrially relevant conditions."
[2] "Octahedral particles (12.0 nm) dominated by the Pt(1 1 1) surface have higher selectivity toward propylene production and better stability than cubic particles (11.5 nm) that are dominated by the Pt(1 0 0) surface."
[3] "When coke is formed on the Pt surface, the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms is shifted farther below the Fermi level, leading to the deactivation of Pt catalyst."

1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke formed can consist of various compounds, including polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), acetylenic compounds, and metallic deposits. Analytical techniques such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. These methods allow researchers to identify the specific chemical components and structural characteristics of coke deposits.

2. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems can affect the catalyst's selectivity towards propylene and stability. For example, when coke forms on the surface of the catalyst, it can lead to deactivation of the catalyst by shifting the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms farther below the Fermi level. This shift can inhibit the electronic interactions necessary for efficient catalytic activity, resulting in decreased selectivity and stability of the catalyst.

1. 催化剂系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢反应中的焦炭沉积物组成会根据反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。焦炭可以由各种化合物组成，包括多核芳烃（PAHs）、炔类化合物和金属沉积物。用于阐明这些系统中焦炭构成复杂性和多样性的分析技术包括气相色谱-质谱（GC-MS）、热重分析（TGA）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）。这些方法允许研究者识别焦炭沉积物的具体化学成分和结构特性。

2. 催化剂系统中焦炭的组成可以影响催化剂对丙烯的选择性和稳定性。例如，当焦炭在催化剂表面形成时，它可能导致催化剂失活，通过将周围铂原子的d带向费米能级以下更远的位置移动。这种位移可能抑制必要的电子相互作用以实现高效的催化活性，导致催化剂的选择性和稳定性降低。
