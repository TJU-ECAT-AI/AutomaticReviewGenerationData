[1] "The selectivity toward propylene and catalyst stability in propane dehydrogenation can be enhanced by shaping Pt nanoparticles under industrially relevant conditions."
[2] "The selectivity toward propylene is lower on the cubic particles than that on the octahedral ones."
[3] "It should be noted that the TOFs were estimated based on Pt surface area of the fresh catalysts measured by H2 chemisorption."
[4] "The rates for coke formation were estimated to be 4.3 and 2.8 mg (g surface Pt)−1 ks−1 on the cubic and octahedral Pt nanoparticles, respectively, on the basis of the amount of coke measured by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO)."
[5] "As a result of coke formation, the activities for propylene formation on the cubic and octahedral particles dropped by 33% and 22% in less than 3 h, respectively."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques such as temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. For instance, the rates for coke formation on different types of Pt nanoparticles, such as cubic and octahedral, were estimated to be 4.3 and 2.8 mg (g surface Pt)^(-1) ks^(-1), respectively. As a consequence of coke formation, the activities for propylene formation on the cubic and octahedral particles dropped by 33% and 22% within less than 3 hours, respectively. This demonstrates how the composition of coke deposits affects the catalytic performance and selectivity in PDH reactions.

1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke formed can consist of various compounds, including polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), acetylenic compounds, and metallic deposits. Analytical techniques such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. These methods allow researchers to identify the specific chemical components and structural characteristics of coke deposits.

2. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems can affect the catalyst's selectivity towards propylene and stability. For example, when coke forms on the surface of the catalyst, it can lead to deactivation of the catalyst by shifting the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms farther below the Fermi level. This shift can inhibit the electronic interactions necessary for efficient catalytic activity, resulting in decreased selectivity and stability of the catalyst.

1. 催化剂系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢反应中的焦炭沉积物组成会根据反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。焦炭可以由各种化合物组成，包括多核芳烃（PAHs）、炔类化合物和金属沉积物。用于阐明这些系统中焦炭构成复杂性和多样性的分析技术包括气相色谱-质谱（GC-MS）、热重分析（TGA）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）。这些方法允许研究者识别焦炭沉积物的具体化学成分和结构特性。

2. 催化剂系统中焦炭的组成可以影响催化剂对丙烯的选择性和稳定性。例如，当焦炭在催化剂表面形成时，它可能导致催化剂失活，通过将周围铂原子的d带向费米能级以下更远的位置移动。这种位移可能抑制必要的电子相互作用以实现高效的催化活性，导致催化剂的选择性和稳定性降低。

The composition of coke deposits varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types in propane dehydrogenation reactions. This variation impacts the selectivity and stability of the catalytic systems. Analytical techniques, including temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents. The coke formation affects the catalytic performance by altering the electronic structure of the Pt surface, leading to deactivation of the catalyst.

In the context of the provided literature, the composition of coke deposits is influenced by the shape of Pt nanoparticles. Octahedral particles (12.0 nm) dominated by the Pt(1 1 1) surface show higher selectivity toward propylene production and better stability compared to cubic particles (11.5 nm) dominated by the Pt(1 0 0) surface. The DFT calculations suggest that the weakened binding strength of propylene and increased energy barrier for the CH bond cleavage on the Pt(1 1 1) surface contribute to the higher selectivity toward propylene. This is because it lowers the formation possibility of deeply dehydrated intermediates.

The deactivation of the Pt catalyst occurs when coke is formed on the surface, shifting the d-band of surrounding Pt atoms farther below the Fermi level. This leads to the deactivation of the Pt catalyst.

在丙烷脱氢反应中，焦炭沉积的组成因不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而异。这种变化影响催化系统的选择性和稳定性。已经使用了诸如程序升温氧化（TPO）等分析技术来阐明焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性。焦炭形成会影响催化性能，通过改变Pt表面的电子结构导致催化剂失效。

在提供的文献背景下，焦炭沉积的组成受铂纳米颗粒形状的影响。由12.0 nm的八面体粒子主导的Pt(1 1 1)表面显示出更高的丙烯选择性和更好的稳定性，与由11.5 nm的立方体粒子主导的Pt(1 0 0)表面相比。DFT计算表明，在Pt(1 1 1)表面上丙烯的结合力减弱以及CH键断裂的能量壁垒增加，对丙烯的选择性有贡献。这是因为降低了深层脱水中间体的形成可能性。

当焦炭形成在Pt表面时，周围的Pt原子的d带被进一步推至费米能级以下。这导致Pt催化剂的失效。

1. Coke deposition on the Pt surface causes the surrounding Pt atoms' d-band to shift further below the Fermi level, resulting in the deactivation of the Pt catalyst.

2. The DFT calculations reveal that the reduced binding strength of propylene and increased energy barrier for CH bond cleavage on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, compared to Pt(1 0 0) and Pt(2 1 1), leads to a higher selectivity towards propylene by decreasing the formation probability of deeply dehydrogenated intermediates.
