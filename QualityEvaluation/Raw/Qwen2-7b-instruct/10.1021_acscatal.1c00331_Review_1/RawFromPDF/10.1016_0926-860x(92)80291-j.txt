1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Scope of this review 
“Coke” is the generic name given to nonvolatile and usually undesirable 
organic compounds which are formed in, or on, catalysts during operation and 
which block access to active sites, thereby causing catalyst deactivation. Deac- 
tivation through coke formation is a problem affecting all classes of catalysts 
involved with hydrocarbon reactions. Coke formation in any catalytic process 
is undesirable. An understanding of how coke is formed and of the factors 
influencing coke formation and removal is clearly essential if the undesirable 
consequences of coke formation are to be minimized. 
In the particular case of zeolite catalysts, coke formation has been widely 
studied in the context of catalytic cracking [ 11, and a number of reviews are 
available [ 
2-5 1. The new class of high silica medium pore size zeolites (the 
ZSM series) introduced by the Mobil Corporation in the mid 1970s show much 
higher resistance to coke formation than the faujasite and mordenite zeolite 
catalysts; the ZSM zeolites are also the basis for a number of important new 
catalytic processes, including the conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons [ 61. 
In this article we address the subject of coke formation in high silica zeolites, 
with particular emphasis on methanol conversion. High-silica zeolites are de- 
fined in this context as generally medium- or small-pore aluminosilicate zeo- 
lites with silicon-to-aluminium ratios, as synthesized, of usually 10 or higher. 
We specifically exclude faujasite or mordenite zeolites which may have been 
chemically treated to reduce the aluminium content. Also excluded are the 
newly synthesized high-silica large-pore zeolites and substituted alumino- 
phosphate-type zeolites on the grounds that the coking characteristics of these 
newer materials have not yet been established. The coverage extends to liter-

ature appearing through mid 1991. Undoubtedly there also exists a consider- 
able body of information generated in the industrial sector which remains in- 
accessible because of commercial sensitivity. We note that the general review 
by Bhatia et al. [7] on zeolite deactivation also includes discussion of coke 
formation in ZSM-5. 
1.2. Acid sites in ZSM-5 
The formation of coke in hydrocarbon reactions over acid zeolite catalysts 
inhibits further reaction either by competitive removal of acid sites or by block- 
ing access of reactant molecules to the acid sites. The number and nature of 
the acid sites will clearly influence coke formation and its effects. In this and 
the following section we review what is known about the acid sites in ZSM-5 
and other high-silica zeolites. 
Many studies have been made of the acidity of ZSM-5 zeolites. Disagree- 
ments in the early literature can be attributed to initial difficulties in preparing 
reproducible samples of the zeolite; synthesis of ZSM-5 is now a routine matter 
[ 81 and a consistent picture of the acid sites in ZSM-5 can be presented. 
Infrared spectroscopy has shown that acid ZSM-5, i.e., in the proton-ex- 
changed form, contains two kinds of hydroxyl group. One, with a vibrational 
frequency of ca. 3600 cm-‘, is associated with the Bronsted acidity of the zeo- 
lite [g-14]. The intensity of this band correlates with the aluminium content 
of the zeolite [ 121 and with the extent of proton exchange [ 
141. The hydroxyl 
group in ZSM-5 has a lower frequency than that in other acid zeolites and an 
unusually large extinction coefficient, suggesting an enhanced ionicity for the 
hydroxyl group in ZSM-5 [ 121. The Brsnsted protons can be quantitatively 
titrated with bases such as ammonia [ 
121 and pyridine [ 141. 
The other hydroxyl group, with a stretching frequency of around 3720-3740 
-l, has been attributed to silanol groups terminating the zeolite lattice (ex- 
Enal surface) or associated with amorphous silica impurities [ 121. For ZSM- 
5 samples having Si:Al ratios between 17 and 44, a direct correlation has been 
reported [ 
151 between the silanol concentration and the external surface area 
of the zeolite crystals. Dessau et al. [ 161 have more recently shown, however, 
that high-silica ZSM-5 (e.g. Si:Al = 13 000) can contain significant concen- 
trations of internal silanol groups which also give a 3740 cm-l infrared band. 
The silanol groups, whether internal or external, are incapable of protonating 
pyridine and must thus be regarded as non-acidic [ 13].ZSM-5 
samples sub- 
jected to mild steam treatment can also show a hydroxyl band at about 3660 
-’ which is attributed to hydroxyl groups associated with extralattice alu- 
znium 
species [ 171. 
High-resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy 
also shows the existence of two kinds of hydroxyl group in proton-exchanged 
ZSM-5 [ 18-201. A resonance at 2.0 ppm (relative to tetramethylsilane) is as- 
4 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) l-34 
signed to non-acidic silanol groups, both external and internal, whereas the 
Brensted protons show a larger chemical shift, giving a resonance at ca. 4.6 
ppm which correlates with the aluminium content and which is removed by 
reaction with pyridine. Invariance of the chemical shift with increasing alu- 
minium content suggested [ 191 that the Brensted sites maintain a constant 
acid strength. 
Microcalorimetric studies of ammonia adsorption in ZSM-5 suggest in con- 
trast that there is a distribution of acid site strengths in the proton-exchanged 
zeolite [9,10,21-231. In this technique the heat of adsorption of ammonia is 
related to the strength of the acid sites. Ammonia first adsorbed on the strong- 
est acid sites gives the largest heat of adsorption, which will then fall with 
increasing ammonia coverage. The curves of heat of adsorption versus cover- 
age obtained by Auroux and co-workers [ 9,10,21-23 ] showed in some cases an 
anomalous maximum which was ascribed to the location of the strongest acid 
sites within the zeolite pores, perhaps as a result of non-homogeneous alumin- 
ium distribution [ 24-271. The number of strong acid sites determined by mi- 
crocalorimetry appeared to be less than the total number of protons present, 
implying the existence of some “weak” Brensted sites. 
Acid site strengths and concentrations are also revealed by temperature- 
programmed desorption (TPD) experiments with appropriate bases. Numer- 
ous TPD studies have been reported of ammonia in ZSM-5 [ 11,18,28-381. The 
findings of these studies can be summarised as follows: 
(i) The ammonia TPD thermogram from proton-exchanged ZSM-5 can 
consist of up to three peaks. 
(ii) The low-temperature peak (350-470 K) consists of two or more over- 
lapping components, which are attributed to desorption of physically adsorbed 
ammonia from different environments within the zeolite. 
(iii) A high-temperature peak between 580 and 670 K is due to desorption 
of ammonia from Brensted acid sites; the intensity of this peak corresponds to 
the total Brensted acid site population calculated from the aluminium content 
of the zeolite. 
(iv) A second high-temperature peak (670-780 K) has been observed by 
some authors and attributed to ammonia desorption from very strong Brensted 
or Lewis sites [ 111, or to dehydroxylation of the zeolite [ 381. 
(v) Variations in the activation energy for desorption with varying alumin- 
ium content have been interpreted as evidence for acid strength variations 
[32]. This interpretation conflicts, however, with other evidence for a uni- 
formity in acid strength as the aluminium content is varied. 
TPD experiments with other bases adsorbed in ZSM-5 have been described 
by Parker and Bibby [ 341. Pyridine, like ammonia, desorbs intact from the 
zeolite. A high-temperature peak (873 K) is attributed to desorption of pyri- 
dine protonated at Brensted sites (supported by infrared observation of re- 
moval of protonated pyridine in this temperature range [ 351) , but the amount 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) l-34 
5 
of protonated pyridine was less than the number of acid sites determined from 
the ion exchange capacity, suggesting that not all of the acid sites are accessible 
to pyridine. In contrast, Camia et al. [ 
391 have claimed, from infrared studies 
of the competitive adsorption of ammonia and pyridine on ZSM-5, that all of 
the Brernsted 
sites can react with pyridine (and that ammonia and pyridine 
have approximately equal affinities for the zeolite protons). A similar conclu- 
sion was reported by Lercher and Rumplmayr [ 
351. 
A possible explanation for these differences of opinion concerning the ac- 
cessibility of Brsnsted sites to pyridine may lie in non-uniformity of alumin- 
ium distribution in different samples and within a single sample. The Brnrnsted 
sites are considered to be located at the intersections of the zeolite channels 
[ 11,351. The stability of the pyridinium ion formed by protonation of pyridine 
certainly implies a strong interaction with the zeolite surface which would be 
sterically difficult at any location other than a channel intersection. The unit 
cell of ZSM-5 contains 4 channel intersections, so that up to 4 Al per unit cell 
could be accommodated within a uniform distribution of 1 Al per intersection. 
In fact, the distribution of aluminium throughout the zeolite lattice on an atomic 
scale is random, subject to the constraint of Loewenstein’s rule [ 401, which 
permits a finite probability of finding a channel intersection containing two 
Brensted sites. This probability may be enhanced if aluminium is not distrib- 
uted homogeneously across the zeolite crystal; many authors have reported 
evidence for aluminium concentration gradients in ZSM-5 [ 25,27,41,42]. Two 
Brsnsted sites at a common channel intersection may be titrated by two am- 
monia molecules, whereas formation of a single pyridinium cation could block 
access of a second pyridine to the same intersection. 
The infrared spectrum of adsorbed pyridine provides evidence for Lewis acid 
sites in ZSM-5. Many authors have reported that ZSM-5 samples pretreated 
up to 400” C give a weak infrared band at ca. 1460 cm- ’ due to Lewis acid- 
bound pyridine [ 11,14,35,43]. Jacobs and von Ballmoos [ 121 showed, how- 
ever, that this band was totally absent from highly crystalline ZSM-5 samples 
pretreated carefully to prevent hydrolysis of the zeolite lattice. There is a grow- 
ing and significant body of evidence, however, that steam treatment can cause 
loss of aluminium from the lattice of ZSM-5. The most direct evidence for this 
comes from 27A1 
NMR spectroscopy, which shows disappearance of the char- 
acteristic signal of tetrahedrally coordinated aluminium [ 17,43,44]. The re- 
sulting extralattice aluminium is mostly NMR invisible (due to quadrupolar 
broadening), but can contain some Lewis acid sites which coordinate pyridine 
[ 17,43,44]. 
The acid sites in ZSM-5 have also been probed by means of catalytic test 
reactions. Haag et al. [45] have established a linear correlation over four or- 
ders of magnitude between the aluminium content of well crystalline ZSM-5 
and the first-order rate constant for n-hexane cracking. An identical correla- 
tion with the amount of tetrahedral aluminium in the zeolite, measured by 
6 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) l-34 
NMR spectroscopy, indicated that the active sites are quantitatively identifi- 
able with protonated framework aluminium sites, and the authors proposed 
that ZSM-5 contains only one type of acid site, whose strength is independent 
of the aluminium content. Similar correlations of activity with acid site con- 
centration have been reported by others [ 
29,32,46-501. 
Mild steam treatment 
can, however, generate a dramatically enhanced activity for hexane cracking 
[51]. Lago et al. [513 suggest that the enhanced activity is associated with 
pairs of aluminium sites at channel intersections which have undergone partial 
hydrolysis; one aluminium which has been hydrolysed from the lattice en- 
hances the acid strength of the remaining acid site. More recently, Brunner et 
al. [ 521 have proposed from a detailed NMR study (‘H, 27A1 
and “Si) that the 
activity enhancement is not due to enhanced Brensted acidity but to associa- 
tion of the Brensted acid site with an extraframework aluminium species trap- 
ped in the zeolite lattice. 
Although not all disagreements between different research groups can be 
accounted for at this stage, it is clear that in well crystallized ZSM-5 zeolites 
which have a homogeneous ahuninium distribution and which have not under- 
gone any hydrolysis during pretreatment, the acid sites can be described [ 12,531 
as protonated tetrahedral lattice aluminium sites

located at the channel intersections. A detailed structural model of this acid 
site, based on wideline proton NMR data, has been presented by Freude and 
Klinowski [ 541. Complications arising in “real” catalyst samples include the 
possibility of non-uniform distributions of aluminium producing variations in 
acid strength, and of partial hydrolysis of the framework during catalyst pre- 
treatment or on stream producing variable amounts of Lewis acidity and par- 
tial pore blockage with extraframework aluminium. 
1.3. Acid sites in other high-silica zeolites 
In contrast to the extensive literature on acid sites in ZSM-5, there have 
been very few reported studies of the acidity of other high-silica zeolites. ZSM- 
11 gives an infrared spectrum very similar to that of ZSM-5; a hydroxyl band 
at 3740 cm-l is attributed to non-acidic silanol groups, and a second band at 
3612 cm-l whose intensity correlates with the aluminium content closely re- 
sembles the Bronsted proton band in ZSM-5 [ 23,551. Ammonia adsorption 
experiments [ 
231 suggested that the Brensted sites in ZSM-11 are weaker than 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) 1-34 
7 
those in ZSM-5, since NH,+ formed by protonation of ammonia is more readily 
removed from ZSM-11, although calorimetric experiments [56] indicate that 
heats of adsorption are very similar in both zeolites. The infrared spectrum of 
pyridine adsorbed in ZSM-11 showed evidence for both Brensted and Lewis 
acid sites; the number of Brensted sites correlated with the intensity of the 
3610 cm-l hydroxyl band and the aluminium content, as for ZSM-5. 
Infrared spectra of the hydroxyl groups in the high-silica faujasite-like ZSM- 
20 have been reported [57]. The 3640 cm-’ 
band in ZSM-20 has a similar 
shape and structure to the corresponding band in dealuminated zeolite Y, and 
reacts with pyridine in a similar way. 
Acid sites in other high-silica zeolites do not appear to have been character- 
ised. Reports of catalytic activity, e.g. for xylene isomerisation over the high- 
silica synthetic ferrerite Fu-9 [ 581, or methanol conversion over Nu-1 [ 
591, 
suggest that these materials all contain Brensted acid sites qualitatively sim- 
ilar to those in ZSM-5. 
2. COKE FORMATION IN METHANOL-TO-GASOLINE 
CONVERSION 
2.1. The commercial MTG process 
The first commercial MTG plant is located at Motunui, New Zealand. This 
plant was designed to convert 155 000 Nm3/h of natural gas to 4400 tpd meth- 
anol. The crude methanol/water (83/17) produced by two 2200 tpd units is 
partially dehydrated over an alumina catalyst at 310” C to produce an equilib- 
rium mixture of dimethyl ether, methanol and water. This step releases about 
20 percent of the overall heat of reaction. This mixture is then mixed with 
recycled gas and fed to four ZSM-5 conversion reactors at an inlet temperature 
of 35O”C, where it is converted to an aromatic-rich mixture of hydrocarbons. 
A fifth reactor is either undergoing regeneration or is on standby. Each of the 
conversion reactors contains ca. 28 tonnes of pelletized ZSM-5 and operates 
at a (methanol) weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of ca. 2 h- ‘. 
The requirement to scale-up to the commercial plant from the laboratory 
pilot plant resulted in a number of reactor design constrains. The ZSM-5 bed 
depth in the fixed-bed conversion reactors are the same as in the pilot plant, 
so that the operating conditions and process variables are identical. 
The initial operating parameters were such that the conversion reaction oc- 
curred over a relatively small zone in the catalyst bed. However, it appears that 
operating under conditions where the reaction zone is increased to include as 
much of the bed as possible, increases the cycle time and catalyst life. A process 
called “catalyst rejuvenation” has also been developed which extends the cycle 
time of the ZSM-5 catalyst by an average of 18 days [ 601. 
The hydrocarbon product mixture is split to give fuel gas (light hydrocar- 
bons, hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide) LPG, light and heavy 
gasoline fractions. The heavy gasoline, containing durene, 1,2,4,5tetrame- 
8 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) l-34 
thylbenzene, is hydroisomerized over a nickel/alumina catalyst and reblended 
to give the final gasoline product. This reduces the durene content of the gas- 
oline to an acceptable level for ‘drivability’ and results in a total yield of 1680 
tpd synthetic gasoline [ 61,621. 
The overall conversion of methanol is exothermic and temperatures are con- 
trolled by carrying out the separate dehydration step, and then by diluting the 
feed to the conversion reactors with recycle gas in a ratio of 1 feed to 7 to 9 
recycle gas. This limits the adiabatic temperature rise in the conversion reactor 
to a maximum of ca. 70’ C. 
2.2. Deactivation 
and reactivation in the MTGprocess 
During the MTG process the ZSM-5 catalyst becomes less effective due to 
three forms of deactivation [ 60,62,63]. 
(i ) The deposition of a carbonaceous residue on and in the ZSM-5 catalyst. 
(ii) An irreversible loss of activity due to the effect of steam on the zeolite 
structure. 
(iii) During regeneration, when coke is removed by oxidation, the high tem- 
peratures involved may affect the zeolite structure. 
These processes can be controlled by minimising the regeneration temper- 
ature (iii), minimising the reaction temperature and partial pressure of steam 
(ii) and adjusting operating procedures to minimise coke formation. Optim- 
ising operating procedures has increased the time-on-stream from a projection 
of ca. 3 weeks up to ca. 10 weeks [ 
601. The total number of cycles before a new 
ZSM-5 catalyst charge is required has not been reported, but catalyst life ap- 
pears to be greater than the 2 years anticipated [ 601. 
The plant was designed so that one of the reactors could be off stream for 
regeneration by combustion of coke in a dilute ( < 1 percent) oxygen:nitrogen 
atmosphere. This process is monitored by analysing the composition of the 
combustion gases and the reactor bed temperature profile. The coke concen- 
tration will vary with bed depth and the levels have not been reported. How- 
ever, from pilot-plant data [60] levels up to 60% may be expected. 
3. COKE FORMATION IN OTHER PROCESSES 
3.1. Cracking and hydrocmcking 
The combination of shape selectivity and acid sites offered by ZSM-5 has 
been widely exploited in cracking and hydrocracking reactions. Research 
workers at Mobil [64] first showed that the relative rates of cracking of C&,-C, 
alkanes over ZSM-5 varied in the following order; straight chain > methyl 
substituted > dimethyl substituted isomers. The Mobil Distillate Dewaxing 
process, which improves the low-temperature characteristics of distillates by 
D. M. Bibby et al. 
jApp1. Catal. A 93 (1992) l-34 
9 
selectively cracking or hydro-cracking straight chain alkanes, is based on the 
use of a ZSM-5 catalyst [ 651. The process uses a fixed-bed reactor with hydro- 
gen circulation to reduce catalyst aging (which presumably involves coke de- 
position), and catalyst lifetimes of up to several months are reported [66]. 
Csicsery [67] has suggested that the catalysts may contain an additional hy- 
drogenation component such as nickel, zinc and/or palladium, which would 
inhibit coke formation, and Holderich and Gallei [ 
681 have reproduced Mobil 
data [69] showing that doping ZSM-5 with zinc and palladium reduces the 
catalyst aging rate, expressed as the temperature rise needed to maintain per- 
formance, from 1 
‘C per day to 0.5’ C per day. 
Coke formation in laboratory scale alkane cracking over ZSM-5 has been 
investigated by several research groups [ 32,47,70-731. Deactivation occurs 
much more slowly than over large-pore zeolite cracking catalysts. Guisnet and 
co-workers [ 70,711 have compared the deactivation rates of H-Y and H-ZSM- 
5 during n-heptane cracking, and find that H-Y loses 80% of its activity within 
the first 30 min of reaction, whereas H-ZSM-5 has only lost 50% of its initial 
activity after 70 h on stream. This unusual stability of a cracking catalyst is 
supported by Mobil data, published by Chen and Garwood [ 61, which showed 
an almost quantitative hydrogen balance between an n-octane feed and its 
cracking products, indicating an almost complete absence of coke. 
Addition of small concentrations of ZSM-5 to a fluidised bed cracking re- 
actor, or the incorporation of ZSM-5 into a conventional zeolite based cracking 
catalyst, has been shown to boost the octane rating of FCC gasoline by selec- 
tively cracking low octane alkane components [ 61, although the total gasoline 
yield is slightly reduced [ 
741. The low rate of coking of the high-silica medium- 
pore zeolite is undoubtedly an important factor in this application. The Mobil 
Lube Dewaxing process [ 751 is also based on the high resistance of ZSM-5 to 
coke formation. 
3.2. Alkene oligomerization 
The conjunct polymerisation of light alkenes to produce a mixture of al- 
kenes, alkanes, cycloalkanes and aromatics over acid catalysts is a well estab- 
lished route for gasoline production [ 761. More recently, Mobil have intro- 
duced the so-called MOGD (Mobil Olefins to Gasoline and Distillate) process 
based on ZSM-5 for the conversion of light alkenes to higher molecular weight 
distillate fuels and/or gasoline [ 77-811. No information is available to us con- 
cerning coke formation in the MOGD process, but the process design incor- 
porates three fixed-bed adiabatic reactors in series, with the first reactor con- 
taining the most deactivated (oldest) catalyst and the third the newest (least 
deactivated), with a fourth reactor off-stream at any particular time undergo- 
ing regeneration [ 
811. The chemistry of coke formation from alkenes in ZSM- 
10 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) l-34 
5 and its relationship to coke formation from methanol is discussed further in 
Section 6. 
3.3. Alkylatim and dealkylatim 
Several different processes which involve alkylation and/or dealkylation re- 
actions of aromatics over ZSM-5 have been commercialised. In the Mobil M- 
forming process low octane alkanes are cracked to alkenes which then alkylate 
benzene and toluene also in the gasoline to produce high octane alkylbenzenes 
[ 6,671. The Mobil-Badger Ethylbenzene process produces ethylbenzene, the 
feedstock for styrene, by alkylating benzene with ethene [ 6,821. Holderich and 
Gallei [68] have given further details of this process, which is carried out in 
an adiabatic multistage fixed-bed reactor. The selectivity to ethylbenzene is 
enhanced by doping the ZSM-5 with phosphorus; this partially blocks the po- 
res and probably also reduces the acidity [83]. Similar factors presumably 
influence the selectivity in benzene ethylation, and may also inhibit coke for- 
mation, although no data to that effect have been presented. The products 
obtained from alkylation of benzene with propene over ZSM-5 depend on the 
catalyst pretreatment conditions and on the amount of coke present [ 841. For 
example, high-temperature activation causes dealumination of the ZSM-5 lat- 
tice and resulting loss of strong acid sites, suppressing formation of cumene, 
while coke formation on stream causes enhancement of the yield ofpara-diiso- 
propylbenzene over meta-diisopropylbenzene. 
Toluene disproportionation over ZSM-5 (the MTDP Mobil Toluene Dis- 
proportionation Process [85] ) converts toluene to a mixture of xylene isomers 
and benzene. High selectivities to para-xylene can be achieved by modifying 
the ZSM-5 with phosphorus, boron or magnesium [ 86,871. Both activity and 
selectivity are strongly influenced also by extraframework aluminium and coke 
deposited during the reaction [ 881; complete deactivation of external surface 
sites and partial pore blockage are needed to achieve optimum para-xylene 
selectivity. 
Selective production of para-xylene by alkylation of toluene with methanol 
can also be achieved by modification of ZSM-5 with phosphorus or boron com- 
pounds, or by deposition of coke; Kaeding et al. [89] attributed these effects 
likewise to deactivation of acidic surface sites and a controlled reduction in 
pore size. 
Coke formation in ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 during alkylation of toluene has been 
studied by Ducarme and Vedrine [go]. In both zeolites, the rate of deactivation 
was found to increase with decreasing crystallite size, and increasing surface 
aluminium concentration, and to decrease when catalyst samples were com- 
pressed at high pressure (thereby decreasing the intercrystalline void volume); 
these authors suggest that the intercrystalline void volume and external sur- 
face play a major role in catalyst deactivation.

Neuber et al. [91] have recently reported reactions of 1-methylnaphthalene 
over the large-pore high-silica zeolite catalysts ZSM-20 and zeolite Beta, and 
have compared these with zeolite Y. Cracking and transalkylation occur, with 
simultaneous formation of coke, but there are pronounced differences in rates 
of deactivation for the three zeolites. In particular, coke formation and crack- 
ing were severely inhibited in zeolite Beta, although the effective pore size of 
this zeolite is only marginally smaller than those of ZSM-20 and Y. 
4. COMPOSITION AND LOCATION OF COKE IN ZEOLITES 
The evidence reviewed here suggests that, while the location of coke for- 
mation depends on reactant and product molecule dimensions, the surface 
acidity, reaction temperature, the nature of the reaction, the acid site concen- 
tration and zeolite morphology also play an important role. The evidence shows 
that where possible internal coking takes place preferentially. The rapid loss 
of acid sites at relatively low coke levels suggests that internal coke may cover 
certain acid (catalytic) sites causing deactivation, or may fill pores or cages, 
thus blocking access to the active sites. When external coke does form, it may 
be either chaotic, where relatively little hindrance to diffusion may be ex- 
pected, or more uniformly arranged so that pore mouths are blocked. 
The composition of coke is also affected by a range of factors including the 
nature of the reactants and time-on-stream, temperature, possibly acid site 
concentration, and, naturally, the site of coke formation or location. Coke will 
therefore have a broad range of composition dictated by this range of variables. 
The major components of coke are dependent on the reactants. Where these 
contain nitrogen, oxygen or metal atoms, possibly in impurities, then it is likely 
that they will be incorporated to some degree into the coke. In this review we 
are concerned largely with the conversion of oxygenates and hydrocarbons and 
the coke formed will contain predominantly carbon and hydrogen. Where ox- 
ygen is present, the amount incorporated into the coke will depend on the 
reaction temperature. 
One example, albeit with a low silica zeolite, which clearly shows the effect 
of temperature was a study of the reaction of ethene over H-mordenite [ 
921. 
At room temperature paraffinic coke formed which became more branched as 
the temperature was increased to 450 K. The low temperature H:C ratio of the 
coke would therefore be close to 2.0. At 500 K aromatic and polyaromatic spe- 
cies formed with a consequent decrease in the H:C ratio. 
The bulk composition of coke is usually determined as an adjunct to other 
work, although the changes in composition that take place during time-on- 
stream can give a useful indication of the structural changes that occur. 
Typically the H:C ratio decreases with time-on-stream [ 
3,93,94], as initial 
high concentrations of alkyl groups fall and aromatic, polyaromatic and even 
pseudographitic and graphitic residues form. 
12 
D.&i. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) l-34 
The shape-selective nature of some zeolite catalysts has a major impact on 
the rate of coke formation [ 
95-981 in that the formation of bulky coke precur- 
sor molecules is inhibited in zeolites which show a high degree of shape-selec- 
tivity. This can result in a low rate of internal coke formation and also, since 
precursors are not formed in significant quantities, in a reduction of external 
coke formation. 
Studying the location of coke and its nature requires sophisticated tech- 
niques. Coke is an intractable, poorly defined material, changing in nature and 
composition with almost all possible reaction variables. The advent of solid 
state NMR and developments in infrared (IR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV- 
visible) spectroscopy have allowed the functionality and composition of coke 
to be investigated in detail. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can be 
used to image coke directly and to determine to some degree its large-scale 
structure, while electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and X-ray photo- 
electron spectroscopy (XPS) can give analytical and structural information. 
Numerous indirect methods have also been used in investigating the location 
and formation of coke. 
A non-invasive technique for monitoring coke levels in a catalytic reactor is 
to use the nuclear properties of carbon and hydrocarbon. The H:C ratio of coke 
has been monitored during coke formation [ 1651 using the fact that the slow- 
neutron scatting cross-section of hydrogen is higher than that of carbon or any 
other element. If a constant H:C ratio for coke is assumed, then coke levels 
and profiles can be determined in situ [ 175-1771 however, water, because of 
its high hydrogen content must be rigorously excluded. 
An XPS study [42] of the distribution of coke on H-ZSM-5 during metha- 
nol-to-hydrocarbon conversion at 370°C showed that most of the coke was 
initially formed internally. External coke formation increased from about 7% 
(w/w) coke and then dominated from deactivation, at about 14% (w/w) coke, 
when internal coke formation had presumably ceased. 
Direct observation by TEM [ 
991 of the external surface of ZSM-5 samples, 
which had been used for methanol conversion, supported the conclusion that 
there had been an onset of external coke formation from about 6% (w/w) coke. 
However, this technique showed much more significant amounts of external 
coke for coke contents below 10% (w/w). It was suggested [ 
991 that the dis- 
crepancy over the extent of external coking arose from the assumption by Sex- 
ton et al. [ 421 that the external coke density was that of graphite; alternatives 
to this assumption are discussed later in this section. 
Alternatively, this discrepancy in the apparent rate of external coke forma- 
tion could be due to the significant differences in reaction temperatures, namely 
370” C [42] and 300 to 460’ C [ 
991. Temperature plays a significant role in 
coking. For instance, studies [ 1001 of the conversion of methanol over zeolites 
showed that at 375 “C coke formation on ZSM-5 was primarily internal, while 
at 475 o 
C coke deposition was mainly external. It was suggested [ 1001 that the 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) 1-34 
13 
high levels of external coke formed predominantly from thermal reactions of 
methanol. Infrared studies [ 
1011 of H-Y cracking catalysts showed evidence 
of rapid external coke formation from n-hexane and 1-hexene above 500°C. 
TEM studies [99] of external coke found that, at low surface coverage, the 
coke appeared to consist of disordered, roughly parallel, extended sheets of 
aromatic carbon, irregularly stacked, rather than graphite. When first formed, 
these carbon sheets appeared to form perpendicular to the zeolite surface, but 
the sheets became paraliel to the surface as the thickness of the coke layer 
increased, although they were still disordered. These observations are sup- 
ported [ 1021 by studies using EELS, in which it was found that the spectrum 
of external coke removed from ZSM-5 by dissolution in HF was similar to that 
of the polyaromatic coronene, but very different from that of graphite. In that 
work [ 1021 the coke was produced from n-heptane cracking over H-ZSM-5 at 
450” C. Similar results were obtained from coked zeolite offretite, but electron 
microscopy of coke on ultra&able-Y [ 1021 showed whisker formation and EELS 
suggested that the coke was more like the hydrocarbon pentacene than coro- 
nene. The explanation offered was that pentacene-like coke precursors formed 
in the pores of ultra&able-Y and were extruded to form filaments of coke. 
However, coronene-like aromatics, because of their size, must be formed in situ 
on the external surface of ZSM-5 or offretite, either from cracking reactions 
on the surface or from condensation of mono- and bi-aromatics diffusing from 
the internal pores. 
Infrared spectroscopic studies of ZSM-5 catalysts coked in methanol con- 
version showed evidence for graphite-like coke on the external surface as shown 
by an increased background absorbance at high frequencies and a perturbation 
of external silanol groups [ 
1031. 
The presence of strong acid sites on the surface can readily promote surface 
coking. Correlations [90] of the crystal diameter with the half-life for toluene 
*.alkylation 
with methanol at 400°C showed that, over a given range of Si/Al 
ratios, the larger the surface area-to-volume ratio, the shorter the reaction 
half-life. 
Studies of internal coke are, of necessity, more indirect, and generally a dif- 
ferent range of techniques is necessary. 
Studies [104,105] of the loss of acid sites with coke formation, using am- 
monia and pyridine as probes, suggested that initial coke formation covered, 
or poisoned, the acid sites. From the rate of loss of acid sites, and the coke 
build-up on one ZSM-5 catalyst used in methanol conversion, it was possible 
to estimate [ 1041 that initially about six carbon atoms per acid site were being 
laid down as coke. Above about 3% coke, about 17 carbon atoms were required 
to deactivate one acid site. It was suggested [104] that coke formation was 
promoted on acid sites in close proximity, possibly due to a cooperative phe- 
nomenon. Further work [ 1051 on three ZSM-5 catalysts, including one sup- 
plied by Mobil, showed significant differences in that the initial rapid loss of 
14 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) l-34 
acid sites was absent from the Mobil sample. This was ascribed to differences 
in the aluminium distribution within the ZSM-5 crystals. Possibly a more uni- 
form and regular distribution in the Mobil sample resulted in an absence of 
near-neighbour acid sites which led to a slower rate of coke formation. Centres 
of multipoint adsorption have also been suggested [ 1061 as the sites which will 
be poisoned first by coke formation. These centres consist of structural groups 
containing one or more aluminium atoms in the second coordination sphere of 
silicon atoms. 
The concentration of these centres of multipoint adsorption will not neces- 
sarily be directly related to the bulk Si/Al ratio, unless the zeolite composition 
is regular, 
or uniform, on an atomic scale. This is frequently not the case [ 25,411 
and an inhomogeneous aluminium distribution would increase the proportion 
of multipoint adsorption centres, or adjacent acid sites, compared to the case 
where the distribution was homogeneous. 
The composition of coke, as determined from the size of molecules extracted 
with a suitable solvent from the zeolite, can also give an indication of where 
coke is formed. Acid dissolution [ 
1071 of a chabazite used to convert methanol, 
followed by solvent extraction of the coke, produced pyrene as the maximum- 
sized soluble molecule, while extraction of the external coke only (i.e. prior to 
acid dissolution) showed the presence of much larger molecules, albeit in very 
low yield. The size of pyrene is close to that of the chabazite cage and thus a 
cut-off at that size is some confirmation that much of the coke was present 
internally. 
Comparisons [70] of the composition of soluble material extracted from 
zeolite Y and ZSM-5, after n-heptane cracking at 450°C and dissolution in 
HF, showed considerable differences. The main components extracted from 
zeolite Y had molecular weights corresponding to 20-24 carbon atoms and those 
from ZSM-5 corresponded to 14-15 carbons after 6 h, and 17-20 carbons after 
50 h. Chemical analysis showed the compounds from zeolite Y to be polyaro- 
matic, with three to seven rings, while those from ZSM-5 were alkylated mono- 
or bi-aromatics. Although the compounds formed on ZSM-5 are volatile, boil- 
ing below 300’ C, they could not be desorbed at 45O”C, showing that they must 
be trapped internally and located at channel intersections. At longer reaction 
times insoluble polyaromatics were also formed on ZSM-5. These must have 
been on the surface since they would be too large to be deposited in the chan- 
nels or intersections. 
Molecules extracted [ 
1081 from erionite which had been used in n-heptane 
cracking and contained 0.5% (w/w) coke, also had sizes related to the size of 
the erionite cage, although at higher coke levels, 5% (w/w) coke, longer poly- 
aromatics were found, possibly occupying several cages. 
The effect of temperature on the type of coke formed and its location, during 
methylation of chlorobenzene and toluene over H-Y, H-M and H-ZSM-5, has 
been studied by IR [ 109 
1. At low temperatures, below 523 K, poisoning was

15 
due to oligomers sorbed onto acid sites, while at higher temperatures, ca. 623 
K, polyaromatics and pseudographitic coke were formed, blocking pores. 
Sorption studies [ 1101 using 3-methylpentane and n-hexane were carried 
out on offretite, used for cracking hexane. They showed that, at short reaction 
times, coke formed largely in the smaller gmelinite cages. Using NMR it was 
also shown [ 1111 that, in ZSM-5 used for hexane cracking at 773 K, coke was 
initially located in the micropores and then externally at extended reaction 
times. However, during mesitylene transformation [ 721 coke was formed pre- 
dominantly externally from the first stages of the reaction. 
Sorption studies [ 1121 were also carried out on a ZSM-5 catalyst coked to 
23% (w/w) after methanol conversion at 370°C. These studies used trimethyl- 
amine to study all acid sites, ethylene di-isopropylamine to study surface sites 
only and benzene to study the kinetics of sorption. The results [ 1121 suggest 
that coke initially forms at different centres throughout the crystal, and grows 
locally from them, with a small amount forming externally without blocking 
access to the pore structure. 
NMR has been used [ 721 to study molecular diffusion in ZSM-5 previously 
coked with n-hexane, with and without adsorbed pyridine present. These stud- 
ies showed that the site for coke formation was the same as the pyridine sorp- 
tion sites, i.e. the acid sites. Coking with mesitylene had very little effect on 
molecular diffusion, showing that the coke was formed only externally in this 
case. Reactions which produce coke from mesitylene clearly take place only on 
the external surface of the zeolite, while n-hexane, which can penetrate the 
pore structure, preferentially forms coke internally. 
While little systematic work appears to have been reported, it is possible 
that non-framework species in zeolites, produced during synthesis or in con- 
version to a catalytically active form, may account for many of the reported 
differences in zeolite deactivation behaviour. The presence of sodium cations 
or non-framework alumina, produced by calcining ZSM-5 at 7OO”C, appears 
[ 1131 to promote coke formation. 
In the oligomerization of alkenes by ZSM-5 [ 1141 an internal oligomer is 
formed at low temperatures, which can cause deactivation of the zeolite and 
which is cracked to a volatile species as the temperature is increased to about 
300°C. At higher temperatures the production of aromatics from alkenes is 
accompanied by further coke formation which, from evidence based on the 
behaviour of the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal intensity after exposure 
to oxygen, must be external. 
One effect of the presence of internal coke is to change the lattice structure. 
H-ZSM-5 deactivated by methanol conversion at 645 K was found [95] to 
transform from the monoclinic to the orthorhombic system, while later, more 
detailed, work [ 1151 showed that both the circular pores and the oval pores 
changed shape significantly. 
Investigations have been made [ 95,116] of the decrease in internal void vol- 
16 
D.M. Bibby et aL/Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) l-34 
ume due to coking, and the corresponding mass of coke deposited, in zeolite 
samples at various stages during the conversion of methanol, and after several 
deactivation-reactivation cycles [ 
1161. A linear relationship was obtained for 
a large part of the coking range, but interpretation was made difficult by the 
fact that it was not known if the coke was internal or external and that the 
density of coke was not known. It is also possible that regions inside the zeolite 
might be “blocked off’ by coke without being occupied by coke. Ideally it would 
be expected that (internal) coke would remove only its own volume from the 
zeolite. 
On the extreme assumption that all the coke was internal, these data can be 
used to give an estimate of the effective density of the internal coke. For a given 
mass of coke deposited during the first cycle only, the decrease in void volume 
relative to the initial void volume is assumed to be the volume occupied by the 
deposited coke. The effective density of the coke deposited in this first cycle 
thus corresponded to 1.2 g cmm3 
which would seem reasonable compared to 
that of coal (ca. 1.4 g cmm3) a likely similar material, and to graphite (2.25 g 
cmm3) which would give a reasonable upper limit. Other experiments [ 1121 
confirm that this is a reasonable value for the density of the coke. The apparent 
density increased in subsequent cycles (values for the next four cycles being 
1.4,1.4, approximately 2 and 2.4 g cmm3, 
respectively). The increase in appar- 
ent coke density with recycle shows that significant changes must be occurring 
to the catalyst during use. In part the higher coke densities may reflect a higher 
proportion of external coke of a more graphitic nature, although this cannot 
explain the highest density found. 
The linear relationships observed for a large part of the deactivation process 
[95,116] imply a uniform deposition of coke, with a constant effective density, 
during deactivation of each sample studied. The amount of “blocking” and the 
internal/external coke ratio might vary from sample to sample, but the depo- 
sition of coke occurred uniformly for a given zeolite. 
Computer modelling and simulation of the coking process in zeolites was 
initiated [ 1171 as a result of the simple modelling developed in discussing the 
above results [95,116]. The analysis [ 1171 has modelled diffusion but has not 
yet produced any detailed results of processes such as “blocking”. Techniques 
such as computer modelling and the application of percolation theory have 
been applied to other catalysts and problems [ 118,119] and this promises to 
be a fruitful approach. 
Comparison [ 1081 of the number of coke molecules with the number of cages 
in an erionite sample used to crack n-heptane at 45O”C, suggested that only 
about 40% of the cages contained coke at deactivation. A model was presented 
showing that coke occupied the outer layer of cages and overflowed on to the 
surface. This situation would arise if, or when reactions took place preferen- 
tially near the surface of the zeolite crystal, with the coke, once formed, block- 
ing access to large parts of the zeolite’s microporous structure. 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) l-34 
17 
Anderson et al. have studied 1-hexene conversion over ZSM-5 [ 1201. Mea- 
surements of accessible pore volume of coked ZSM-5 suggested that the non- 
volatile products formed from 1-hexene and other hydrocarbons at 393-593 K 
were located mainly within the channels of ZSM-5, and that above 593 K these 
migrate to the external surface to undergo dehydrogenation/condensation 
to 
form polyaromatics in the C&,-C,, range. Confirming that these are mainly 
formed at the external surface of the zeolite, on ZSM-5 surface deacidified with 
Sic&, a large decrease in the proportion of higher aromatics formed from l- 
hexene at 593 K was observed. 
The technique of “‘Xe NMR spectroscopy has also provided recent evidence 
for coke formation occurring within the pores of ZSM-5. Tsiao et al. [121] 
showed that H-ZSM-5 coked by exposure to butene loses up to 50% of its in- 
ternal pore volume as measured by Xe NMR (the gradient of 12’Xe chemical 
shift versus coverage plots is a direct measure of the internal porz volume), 
whereas a Na-ZSM-5 sample acidified on the external surface only showed 
negligible loss of internal pore volume on coking consistent with external coke 
formation in this case. 
The control of the location of coke formation has some industrial interest. 
While it is unlikely that coke formation can be entirely eliminated in all re- 
actions of interest, it appears possible to make some changes to improve be- 
haviour, for example, to modify the external surface of a zeolite to minimise 
external coke formation. Removal of acid sites from the external surface with 
dealuminating agents [ 1221 or by poisoning the external sites with molecules 
too large to penetrate the zeolite pores [ 123,124] or selectively ion exchanging 
the surface protons [ 
1251 have all been suggested and have been found to have 
varying degrees of effectiveness. Also, control of the aluminium distribution 
within the zeolite lattice may effect the rate of internal coke formation [ 1051. 
5. ROLE OF ZEOLITE ACIDITY IN COKE FORMATION 
The deactivation of ZSM-5 during methanol conversion was first shown by 
Topsoe et al. [ 111 to cause a dramatic decrease in the number of acid sites 
measured by ammonia TPD. Calorimetric measurements [ 221 supported this 
result, in that the total number of acid sites decreased in a used catalyst, whereas 
the range (distribution) of acid strengths remained unchanged. Auroux et al. 
[ 221 and Derouane et al. [ 271 interpreted these observations in terms of coke 
deposition on the external surface of the zeolite. 
One criticism which can be levelled at these early observations is that the 
amounts of coke deposited in the used catalysts were quite small (e.g. 2.2 wt.- 
% [ 1261)) whereas coke loadings in excess of 20 wt.-% are found in the com- 
mercial methanol-to-gasoline 
process 
[ 621. McLellan 
and co-workers 
[ 104,105,127,128] accordingly undertook a detailed study of the numbers of 
acid sites in different ZSM-5 catalysts which had been coked to widely varying 
18 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) l-34 
extent by methanol conversion. The number of Brensted acid sites of two ZSM- 
5 catalysts containing 2.7 and 1.3 Al per unit cell, respectively, as a function of 
coke loading was measured by ammonia TPD and FT-IR spectroscopic obser- 
vation of the adsorbed base. Coke in this study was defined as the hydrocarbon 
residue remaining in the catalyst after desorption of methanol conversion 
products in flowing nitrogen at 370” C. As the coke content increased there was 
an initial steep decrease in acid site concentration, which was followed by a 
second more gradual decline. The initial loss of acid sites was consistent with 
the earlier reports [ 111 
of reduced acid site concentrations in zeolites contain- 
ing low coke levels, but it is noteworthy that catalysts containing more than 
10 wt.-% coke still contained some Brensted acid sites accessible to ammonia, 
and were still capable of converting methanol to hydrocarbons. 
The slope of the acid site concentration versus coke content graph was used 
to determine the ‘amount’ of coke needed to block one acid site. The initial 
slope for the ZSM-5 sample containing 2.7 Al per unit cell corresponded to one 
acid site removed for the equivalent of every six carbon atoms deposited (as- 
suming the coke to consist only of carbon). The corresponding figure for ZSM- 
5 containing 1.3 Al per unit cell is 15 carbon atoms per acid site lost. Assuming 
one nonvolatile coke ‘molecule’ to contain about 15 carbon atoms, these figures 
imply that one coke molecule blocks one acid site in the zeolite containing 1.3 
Al per unit cell, and 2.5 acid sites in the zeolite containing 2.7 Al per unit cell. 
The probability of finding two acid sites at the same channel intersection in 
the higher-aluminium zeolite is 10% (assuming a Poisson distribution), if the 
aluminium distribution is homogeneous. An inhomogeneous aluminium dis- 
tribution may, however, produce a larger number of paired sites. Evidence for 
non-uniformity of the aluminium distribution in this particular zeolite (the 
difference between the number of acid sites counted with ammonia and with 
pyridine) was discussed in Section 1.2. The numbers of acid sites measured by 
pyridine chemisorption decreased with increasing coke content with the same 
initial slopes as those observed with ammonia. Pyridine chemisorption was, 
however, completely suppressed in zeolites containing more than 10% coke. 
The explanation proposed for these results [ 104,105] was that coke forma- 
tion occurred initially at channel intersections, blocking one or more acid sites. 
The second stage in the deactivation was attributed to the formation of coke 
on the external surface of the zeolite and/or to topological blocking of the 
zeolite channels; pyridine is thus unable to gain access to acid sites which are 
still accessible to the smaller ammonia molecule, and to methanol. 27A1 
NMR 
measurements have supported this description [ 1291; coke formation at an 
acid site causes loss of the NMR signal of the corresponding framework alu- 
minium, due to lowering of symmetry at the quadrupolar nucleus, and the loss 
of the 27Al 
signal intensity with increasing coke content was found to follow 
the same changes as did ammonia and pyridine chemisorption. 
Bibby et al. also found [ 1051 that the acid sites removed by coke formation 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) 1-34 
19 
in methanol conversion could not be restored by heating the catalysts in flow- 
ing nitrogen to 650’ C. Oxidative regeneration (flowing oxygen above 500’ C ) 
did, however, restore about 90% of the original Brensted acid site concentra- 
tions, as measured by ammonia and pyridine chemisorption. Such regenera- 
tion also restored the 3610 cm-l hydroxyl band characteristic of the Bronsted 
sites. 
The deactivation of ZSM-5 catalysts in the cracking of alkanes has been 
reported by Post and van Hooff [ 321, and by Borade et al. [47]. Although the 
activity for hexane cracking correlates directly with the initial acid site con- 
centration measured by ammonia TPD (as discussed earlier), no simple rela- 
tionship could be found between the acid site concentration and the rate of 
deactivation due to coke formation. The complexity of coke formation in hy- 
drocarbon cracking reactions over large-pore zeolites is well known [ 1301, and 
as discussed below, the chemistry of coke formation from methanol will not 
necessarily be similar to that in cracking reactions. 
Bulow et al. [73] have studied the effects of coke deposition, from hexane 
and mesitylene cracking, on the acid site concentrations in ZSM-5, as mea- 
sured by pyridine chemisorption. Coke from hexane cracking was found to 
exert a strong inhibiting effect on pyridine chemisorption, similar to that de- 
scribed above for coke from methanol conversion, whereas coke from mesity- 
lene showed only a slight inhibiting effect. These results, together with mea- 
surements of methane diffusion in the coked catalysts, were interpreted to 
mean that mesitylene cracking causes preferential deposition of coke near the 
external surface of the zeolite, since mesitylene is too large to enter the ZSM- 
5 channels. During hexane cracking, on the other hand, coke formation is in- 
itiated at the internal acid sites, and topological blocking of the channels and/ 
or external coke formation occurs at a later stage. This two-stage picture is 
identical to that proposed for coke formation in methanol conversion [ 
42,951. 
6. THE CHEMISTRY OF COKE FORMATION 
Coke formation during hydrocarbon conversion over acid zeolites must be 
at least initiated by oligomerization, polymerisation and further reaction of 
small molecules at active sites within the zeolite pores. Derouane [ 41 proposed 
the following general reaction sequence for coke formation in zeolites: 
Alkanes- 
alkenes- 
oligomers 
coke - 
aromatics -napthenes 
In this section we examine some of the experimental evidence for this reac- 
tion sequence, and the extent to which individual molecular events can be 
characterised.

6.1. Interaction of aromatics with acid sites 
Walsh and Rollman [ 1311 first reported radiotracer measurements of coke 
formation when hexane:aromatic mixtures were passed over ZSM-5. The coke 
yields were found to be almost two orders of magnitude lower in ZSM-5 than 
in the corresponding experiments with mordenite, although the relative con- 
tributions of hexane and aromatic to the coke were similar, implying similar 
coke compositions in both zeolites. Coke formation was suggested to occur via 
a similar pathway in both zeolites, involving intermolecular hydrogen transfer 
reactions between adsorbed alkylaromatic species. These reactions were con- 
sidered to be sterically restricted in the smaller-pore ZSM-5. 
The concept of restricted transition state selectivity in zeolites has been 
discussed by several authors (refs. 126,132-134, for example ). In essence, the 
steric constraints imposed by the zeolite framework around the active site in- 
hibit the formation of a particular transition state, thereby suppressing that 
particular bimolecular reaction. Any bimolecular reactions involved in coke 
formation will, in principle, be subject to restricted transition state selectivity. 
Several groups have reported [9,135-1381 the formation of radical cations 
when aromatics are adsorbed in ZSM-5. For example, contact of activated H- 
ZSM-5 with liquid benzene produces a ‘I-line ESR signal attributed [ 1351 to 
the benzene radical cation. In mordenite, the same experiment gives a 13-line 
signal due to the benzene dimer radical cation, although traces of this 13-line 
signal can also be seen in the published ZSM-5 spectra [ 136,137]. UV-visible 
spectra [ 1381 show that heating the adsorbed benzene radical cation in ZSM- 
5 forms biphenyl, whereas in mordenite, fused-ring naphthalene and pyrene 
radical cations were generated. Vedrine et al. [ 
91 attribute these differences to 
steric restriction of aromatic ring fusion reactions in ZSM-5. Other evidence 
for the steric inhibition of ring fusion reactions in ZSM-5 includes the absence 
of fused ring products in TPD measurements on adsorbed alkylaromatics [ 1281. 
Ring fusion reactions have been shown to occur readily in the large pore zeolite 
H-Y [139]. 
A further important observation, made by Vedrine et al. [ 1371, is that radical 
cation formation from aromatics in ZSM-5 occurs within the zeolite pores and 
not on the external surface. Radical cation formation was poisoned by pyri- 
dine, but not by 2,4,6_trimethylpyridine, which is too large to enter the pores. 
Anderson et al. [ 1401 used solvent extraction followed by gas chromato- 
graphy-mass spectrometry (GC-MS ) analysis to show that both benzene and 
toluene react on H-ZSM-5 at 593 K and 673 K to yield low levels of coke, 0.4- 
1.2 wt.-%, consisting of C,-C,, alkanes, alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, al- 
kylfluorenes, alkylbiphenyls, alkyldiphenylmethanes and small amounts of 
polyaromatic anthracenes and phenanthrenes. It was also found that alkylflu- 
orenes, alkyl-substituted anthracenes and phenanthrenes were in general the 
major coke products formed on ZSM-5 from the reactions of the model coke

21 
precursors 3,3’-dimethylbiphenyl, 3- and 4-methyldiphenylmethane, 9-meth- 
ylfluorene, 9-ethylfluorene, 9,lOdihydroanthracene 
and anthracene over this 
zeolite. It was concluded that the fused-ring high molecular weight products 
were formed from benzene and toluene via biphenyls and diphenylmethanes, 
with alkylation being an important feature. 
6.2. Alkenes in 
ZSM-5 
The interaction of alkenes with ZSM-5 has been widely studied. Slightly 
above room temperature, ethene is readily protonated by the Brensted acid 
sites in H-ZSM-5, forming a carbenium cation which initiates oligomerization 
reactions. This has been shown by infrared spectroscopy [ 141-1441: the 3610 
cm-’ band due to the Brensted protons is removed and-C-H bands character- 
istic of alkyl groups appear. 13C 
NMR spectra also show that oligomerization 
occurs at or slightly above room temperature [ 141,145,146]. The NMR spectra 
of the oligomer indicate that it is not a linear (CH, ), chain, but is less branched 
than the corresponding oligomer formed in zeolite Y. Ethene oligomerization 
is inhibited by the presence of physically adsorbed water [ 141,145]. 
Propene interacts with the acid sites in ZSM-5 at room temperature in a 
manner similar to ethene, giving similar infrared [ 143,144,147,148] and NMR 
[ 1461 spectra. The infrared and NMR spectra of all acyclic alkenes adsorbed 
in ZSM-5 are remarkably similar [ 143,144,146], suggesting strongly that com- 
mon oligomeric species are formed within the zeolite pores. TPD measure- 
ments by Kofke and Gorte [ 1491 show that the low-temperature oligomeriza- 
tion stops at a stoichiometry of 12-18 carbon atoms per acid site, corresponding 
to 6 ethene or propene molecules per acid site. This represents approximate 
filling of the available pore volume around each acid site with an alkyl chain, 
at least in higher aluminium content zeolites where there is approximately one 
acid site per channel intersection. The infrared spectra of the oligomer species 
are also consistent with this picture of limited chain length, as judged by the 
relative concentrations of CH3 and CH2 groups [ 1441. The oligomer can be 
regarded formally as an alkyl carbenium cation: 
Recent NMR studies on propene in zeolite H-Y [ 1501 suggest, however, that 
the carbenium cation is bound to an oxide ion of the zeolite and should be more 
correctly described as an alkoxide group. 
Changes in the infrared and UV-visible spectra of alkenes adsorbed in ZSM- 
5 on heating at 100°C or above have been attributed [ 70,144,151] to the for- 
mation of alkenyl carbenium cations, through hydride transfer reactions be- 
tween alkyl carbenium cations and adsorbed alkenes: 
R++C,H,,+RH+C,H,+,_, 
22 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) l-34 
Such reactions produce alkanes and more highly unsaturated adsorbed species. 
Cyclization of the alkenyl carbenium cations and further hydride transfer re- 
actions will ultimately produce aromatics, which can be detected as reaction 
products 
in 
the 
gas phase 
at temperatures 
of 
200°C 
or 
above 
[ 128,141,143,144,148]. W-visible 
bands characteristic of adsorbed aromatics 
are also observed after heating ZSM-5 in alkenes at high temperature [ 1441. 
The gas-phase product distributions, observed when alkenes are passed over 
ZSM-5, must agree with the chemistry proposed from spectroscopic observa- 
tions of adsorbed species. At low temperatures, propene reacted over ZSM-5 
forms exclusively alkene oligomers, with a predominance of Cg, Cl2 and C,, 
products, while hexene gives mostly C&, Cl8 and C,, alkenes [ 
791. Quann et 
al. [ 
791 showed that the degree of methyl branching in the oligomerization 
products was less than that expected for non-shape-selective oligomerization, 
implying that oligomerization must occur within the zeolite pores and be sub- 
ject to steric restrictions. The opposite conclusion, that oligomerization occurs 
on the external surface of the zeolite, was reachedby Wilshier et al. [ 1521 from 
their analysis of the degree of branching in the Cg alkene products. According 
to Quann et al. [ 
791, a clear distinction between shape-selective and non-shape- 
selective oligomerization can only be made from product analysis of alkenes 
larger than Cg. The spectroscopic studies show clearly that oligomerization 
occurs within the zeolite pores; the observed gaseous products presumably re- 
sult from cracking and/or decomposition of the adsorbed oligomer. At higher 
temperatures, more severe cracking and isomerisation produces a randomisa- 
tion of the gas phase oligomer distribution. Cycloalkenes, cycloalkanes, al- 
kanes and aromatics are produced in the temperature range where adsorbed 
alkenyl carbenium cations are detected spectroscopically [ 
791. 
Anderson et al. [ 1201 studied the retained and desorbed products from the 
reactions of 1-hexene, cyclopentadiene, cyclopentadiene dimer and n-hexane 
over H-ZSM-5 at various temperatures. Retained products were identified 
mainly by the solvent extraction/GC-MS 
technique, complemented by 13C 
NMR cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) 
spectroscopy of 
coked zeolite samples. These authors formulated a coke formation scheme where 
C, alkenes (n = 8-15) formed from 1-hexene over ZSM-5 at 393-593 K de- 
hydrogenate and cyclise to give cyclopentadienes and their dimers, which sub- 
sequently evolve to form indanes, indenes and tetralins, eventually leading to 
naphthalenes and fused-ring tricyclic aromatics such as phenanthrenes and 
anthracenes -with 
many of these products being alkyl substituted. Alkylben- 
zenes were by-products of this sequence. Moreover, cyclopentadiene trimers 
were considered to be important in the formation of the bulky fused-ring tri- 
cyclic aromatics on the external surface of the zeolite. 
The reactions of cyclopentadiene, its dimer and n-hexane over H-ZSM-5 
over a similar temperature range were found to follow near identical reaction 
pathways. In comparison to the reaction of 1-hexene over ZSM-5, increased 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) l-34 
23 
amounts of retained alkylbenzenes were produced from cyclopentadiene and 
its dimer, both these and the polyaromatic residues on ZSM-5 were thought to 
be derived from the initially formed skeletal rearrangement products, tetralin 
and methyl-substituted indanes. Increased amounts of retained alkylbenzenes 
were also a feature of the reaction of n-hexane on ZSM-5, along with the emerg- 
ence of some cyclopentadiene dimers and trimers, although there were reduced 
quantities of the higher aromatics produced. 
The general reaction scheme proposed by Derouane [ 41 for coke formation 
in acid zeolites is thus supported by spectroscopic and other measurements on 
alkenes in ZSM-5. In comparison with larger pore xeolites, the formation of 
cyclic adsorbed species within ZSM-5 requires higher temperatures, and the 
formation of polynuclear aromatic coke is certainly inhibited [ 70,153]. 
Since alkenes are formed at an early stage in alkane cracking reactions [ 1301, 
coke formation in alkane cracking will follow the same reaction pathway. At 
the high temperatures of alkane cracking reactions, however, the oligomeric 
carbenium cations formed from alkenes at low temperatures are not stable, 
and the chemistry of coke formation under these conditions will involve un- 
saturated cyclic and aromatic adsorbed species. 
6.3. Methanol in ZSM-5 
Methanol conversion over ZSM-5 produces alkenes at an early stage in the 
reaction [ 601. The chemistry discussed above for alkenes in ZSM-5 will thus 
also apply to methanol conversion. There are however two additional factors 
which must be considered in methanol conversion: the role of methanol as a 
methylating agent, and the possible influence of water as a major reaction 
product. 
In situ FT-IR studies have shown that initial contact of ZSM-5 with meth- 
anol at conversion temperatures produces internal and external methoxy groups 
[ 154,155]. Although there has been extensive debate and disagreement over 
the mechanism of carbon-carbon bond formation from methanol or dimethyl 
ether, the important role of electrophilic methoxy groups, formed at internal 
acid sites, in initiating alkene formation seems now to be widely accepted [ 1561. 
Methoxy groups are also important in coke forming reactions at higher tem- 
peratures. Alkenes and aromatics are readily methylated by the methoxy groups 
[ 154,157,158], and non-catalytic methylation of coke by methanol has been 
proposed as an important process in ZSM-5 at high temperature [ 1001. 
None of the infrared bands characteristic of oligomeric carbenium cations 
formed from alkenes in ZSM-5 were observed in in situ IR studies of methanol 
conversion at high temperatures and long contact times [ 1031, but such spe- 
cies would not be expected to survive under these conditions. The in situ IR 
studies do show the gradual build-up of methylated aromatic coke species dur- 
ing prolonged exposure to flowing methanol at conversion temperatures [ 1031. 
24 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) 1-34 
In UV-visible spectra, methanol and dimethyl ether produce similar absorb- 
tion bands to those formed from alkenes at high temperature and attributed 
to aromatic coke precursors [ 103,144]. 
In situ NMR spectroscopy has recently been applied to study reaction path- 
ways leading to coke formation during methanol conversion over ZSM-5 by 
Anderson and Klinowski [ 159,160]. These authors recorded spectra of zeolite 
samples in sealed tubes after heating in methanol to successively higher tem- 
peratures. The spectra measured of adsorbed products show the initial hydro- 
carbon species to be aliphatic in nature, with aromatics first detected at 573 
K. Of particular significance in this study is the composition of the adsorbed 
aromatics. 1,2,3- And 1,2,5trimethylbenzenes 
are detected in the adsorbed 
phase, for example, but not in the gaseous products. Likewise, tetramethylben- 
zenes, which are never detected in gaseous products of methanol conversion at 
573 K, are found in the adsorbed phase. These observations clearly reinforce 
the importance of shape selectivity in ZSM-5 catalysis. Methylaromatics which 
are too large to escape from the zeolite pores into the gas phase provide a start- 
ing point for coke formation within the pores. 
The influence of water formed during methanol conversion on coke forma- 
tion chemistry has not yet been clearly established. The low-temperature oli- 
gomerization of ethene in ZSM-5 is poisoned by physically adsorbed water 
[ 1411, but the corresponding reaction with propene is not [ 1471, and physi- 
cally adsorbed water will not, in any event, be present at methanol conversion 
temperatures. As discussed earlier, water at high temperatures can modify the 
acidity of high-silica zeolites by hydrolysing aluminium from the zeolite lattice, 
which may in turn affect the coking behaviour of the zeolite. Alexander and 
co-workers [ 17,161] have shown that when a fresh ZSM-5 catalyst is subjected 
to methanol conversion for an extended period a large fraction of the Brensted 
acid sites are irreversibly lost due to hydrolysis of aluminium from the lattice. 
The extent of this loss depends on the aluminium content of the zeolite; for 
example, a high aluminium ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 12) lost 70% of its acid sites as 
measured by pyridine adsorption after 1 MTG cycle, whereas the correspond- 
ing figure for a zeolite with Si/Al = 74 was 45%. Repeated cycling through 
methanol conversion and regeneration (coke removal) cycles caused only mi- 
nor further changes in the acid site concentration. The catalyst lifetimes (as 
measured by the time taken for methanol conversion to fall below a specified 
threshold in a fixed-bed reactor operating at fixed temperature and space ve- 
locity) increased dramatically during second and subsequent cycles. Since cat- 
alyst lifetime is determined by the rate of coke formation, these results suggest 
that the reactions leading to coke formation e.g. intermolecular hydrogen 
transfer are strongly dependent on the acid site concentration; the water pro- 
duced during methanol conversion reduces this concentration and enhances 
the catalyst lifetime. Extraframework aluminium species remaining within the 
zeolite pores may also influence the chemistry of coke formation in aged cat- 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) l-34 
25 
alysts. Possible reactions between water vapour and adsorbed hydrocarbon 
coke precursors during MTG conversion also require further investigation. 
These various possible effects of water as a reaction product certainly mean 
that coking behaviour in the conversion of methanol or other oxygenates can- 
not be extrapolated from data obtained in cracking or oligomerization reac- 
tions (and vice versa). 
7. COKE REMOVAL OR CATALYST REGENERATION 
The regeneration of deactivated zeolite catalysts requires not only the re- 
moval of coke, usually by oxidation, but also the removal of poisons, such as 
nitrogen bases and metal cations, which originated, for example, as impurities 
in the feedstock. Bases can be removed during high temperature regeneration 
procedures used to remove coke. The presence of metal cations can be a more 
severe problem, but a discussion of methods available to control such poisoning 
is beyond the scope of this article. 
In view of the industrial importance of catalyst reactivation, the amount of 
published work is surprisingly limited. Retention of catalyst properties during 
reactivation is of critical importance, and the investigation of novel processes 
optimising the effectiveness of regeneration would seem of high priority. 
Industrially, coke is removed by oxidation. However, since a large fixed-bed 
reactor may contain several tonnes of coke, this procedure has to be monitored 
carefully in order to ensure that pre-determined temperature limits are not 
exceeded. During the removal of coke from ZSM-5 which had been deactivated 
during methanol conversion in a pilot plant, temperature control [62] was 
achieved by limiting the oxygen content to less than 1.0% (v/v) until the bulk 
of the coke had been removed. Any residual coke was then removed at a max- 
imum of 500°C in air [62]. Temperature control is also important in catalyst 
reactivation in FCC processes, where coke is oxidised under fluidising 
conditions. 
While dilute oxygen is invariably used in industrial-scale coke removal, other 
oxidants have been investigated on a laboratory scale. An oxygen plasma was 
shown [95] to be effective in removing coke, particularly external coke, from 
a ZSM-5 catalyst, with about 16% (w/w) coke, which had been used in meth- 
anol conversion. Although reaction times were long at the low pressures used, 
any rise in temperature was likely to have been minimal. Because the highly 
reactive oxygen radicals would tend to recombine on solid surfaces, this tech- 
nique has limited value in removing coke from the interior of zeolite pellets or 
extrudates. 
Pyrolysis of coke formed under MTG conditions has been investigated by 
infrared and temperature-programmed desorption measurements [ 103,105]. 
Methane is 
the only hydrocarbon evolved when coked MTG catalysts are heated 
in flowing argon, in a single peak at about 600’ C. 
Accompanying changes in the infrared spectra indicate loss of methyl groups, 
26 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) 1-34 
perhaps due to condensation reactions between adjacent methylaromatic rings. 
Such pyrolysis does not, however, restore the Brensted acid sites originally 
present in the fresh catalyst, the zeolite pores remaining blocked with polyn- 
uclear aromatic residues. 
A comparative study [ 1621 of the regeneration of zeolites Y, mordenite and 
ZSM-5 used for n-heptane cracking at 450” C, showed that at similar coke con- 
tents the rate of oxidation was much lower in ZSM-5. Differences in the mi- 
croporous structures were thought to account for these different rates. It was 
suggested that oxygen could penetrate the small-pore system in mordenite, 
thus oxidising coke throughout the structure. Similarly, in the case of zeolite 
Y, oxygen was thought to be able to circulate freely through the supercages. 
However, in ZSM-5 it was suggested [ 
1621 that the coke compounds tilled and 
blocked the channel intersections, preventing easy circulation of oxygen 
through the structure. Thus coke oxidation was described [ 1621 as a shape- 
selective process. 
The reactions of oxygen with coke have been studied using IR [ 1271 between 
400’ C and 580’ C, by evolved gas analysis [ 1621 between 250 
’ C and 500” C, 
by NMR [163] at 410°C and by IR [164] between 100°C and 500°C. 
The initial temperature for the formation of carbon dioxide varies with the 
zeolite [ 1621. In studies of zeolite Y and mordenite, the temperature at which 
carbon dioxide was evolved was about 250°C when the coke was “young”, i.e. 
had a high H/C ratio, and this increased to about 300°C for higher coke con- 
centrations, where the H/C ratios were lower. In contrast, carbon dioxide evo- 
lution from ZSM-5 was found [ 
1621 to start from about 300°C to 350” C, pos- 
sibly because of restricted oxygen access to internal coke. It was found that 
carbon dioxide evolution peaked at about 450 o 
C for all three zeolites, although 
significant coke still remained at 500’ C. In other work the evolution of carbon 
dioxide was found [ 1271 to peak at 400’ C at low coke levels and at up to 600 o 
C 
for coke levels above about 4%, suggesting that a more refractory form of coke 
was present at the higher coke levels. The H/C ratio of the coke reduced as the 
oxidation temperature was increased, thus it would appear that hydrogen-rich 
aliphatic side chains were being oxidised at the lower temperatures. Extraction 
of the coke before and after oxidation, by dissolution in HF and solution in 
dichloromethane, followed by analysis by GC, mass spectrometry, NMR and 
IR, showed the loss of most of the alkylaromatic and aromatic protons by ox- 
idation treatment and the formation of aldehyde, ketone and phenolic species. 
IR spectroscopy was used [ 1641 to study the effect of oxygen treatment of 
coke which had been formed on zeolite Y from methanol at 450°C. At 2OO”C, 
oxygen treatment reduced the intensity of the methyl and methylene absorp- 
tion bands, and bands typical of carbonyl species appeared. Substantial reduc- 
tion of a band at 1550 cm-‘, typical of condensed aromatics, indicated that 
transformation of these species was occurring at these low temperatures. In- 
creasing the temperature, first to 300°C then 4OO”C, intensified the above 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) l-34 
27 
effects and indicated the formation of carboxylate compounds and ether link- 
ages. At 500” C only residual compounds with carboxylate or carbonate struc- 
ture were found. 
Similar results were found [ 1271 when coke from ZSM-5 used for methanol 
conversion at 370 o 
C was subject to isothermal oxidation in a heatable IR flow 
cell. Dry air was flowed over sample wafers in situ between 400 o 
C and 750 ’ C 
and the formation of various carbonyl species was observed from 400’ C. Oxi- 
dation carried out in a vacuum IR cell using 50% 180-enriched oxygen, sug- 
gested that some of the carbonyl groups were coupled, as in cyclic anhydride 
groups. 
Steam is a product of coke oxidation and can cause permanent deactivation, 
because of its ability to remove acid sites. In many regeneration procedures 
[ 1661 steam is specifically removed from recycle gas. However, it is sometimes 
desirable to modify and improve the properties of zeolites by deliberately 
steaming them. Regeneration by coke oxidation in the presence of steam has 
been claimed [ 1661 to improve the selectivity of ZSM-5 for xylene isomerisa- 
tion in the second cycle. It has also been found both in the laboratory and on 
the commercial scale [62,63,167] that the performance of ZSM-5 in methanol 
conversion improves after the first deactivation-regeneration cycle, probably 
as a result of steam produced from the large amounts of water generated during 
reaction. It has also been found [ 1681 that the rate of coke formation reduces 
during the second and subsequent cycle of methanol conversion. 
The use of ozone as an oxidant has been reported [ 169-1711. Ozone was 
used to remove coke from ZSM-5 catalysts which had been used for methanol 
conversion and o&ho-xylene isomerisation, as well as from zeolite Y used for 
n-hexane cracking. Ozone can be readily formed in an electric discharge and 
decomposes to oxygen and atomic oxygen which rapidly combines to form ox- 
ygen at about 200 o 
C. This decomposition temperature conveniently serves to 
control the temperature of oxidation. The low-temperature ozone treatment 
was effective in regenerating the catalytic activity of a zeolite initially coked 
to about 2% (w/w) by methanol conversion; the coke level was reduced by 
ozone treatment to about 1.5% (w/w). The method was also used [ 1711 in the 
treatment of zeolite Y extrudate pellets with about 20% (w/w) coke as the 
result of conversion of n-hexane. Removal of coke from the centre of the zeolite 
Y pellets was not completely effective, probably due to decomposition of the 
ozone in the outer part of the pellets and subsequent diffusion limitations on 
the reactive species produced [ 1711. 
Distinct differences were seen [ 1631 between the reactions of ozone and 
oxygen with coke. Oxygen at 410°C reacts with both aliphatic and aromatic 
carbon, while ozone at about 200°C appears to react preferentially with aro- 
matic residues. The reactivated zeolites showed substantial levels of ether and 
carbonyl species in the residual coke, which remained after both ozone and 
oxygen treatment.

Pyrolysis, by heating in an inert atmosphere, may also result in the partial 
removal of coke. During this process the coke is thought to be cracked to pro- 
duce small, hydrogen-rich molecules, which are lost, leaving a residue with a 
lower H:C ratio, highly polyaromatic or more graphitic in nature. Since pyrol- 
ysis regenerates catalytic activity to some degree, it is possible that the coke 
remobilises during pyrolysis. 
Removal of coke by hydrogenation has also been claimed [ 1721. Deactiva- 
tion of ZSM-5 during toluene alkylation at 425°C was reversed by treatment 
with hydrogen at about 800 kPa at 550°C. This treatment appeared to be se- 
lective in removing coke deposited during reaction while retaining coke ini- 
tially deposited to improve the selectivity of the catalyst with respect to paru- 
ethyltoluene production. Similar results have been found [ 1731 in methanol 
conversion, where coke formation could be reduced by the presence of hydro- 
gen and coke removed in a stream of hydrogen and ammonia. 
In the commercial New Zealand methanol-to-gasoline plant, a rejuvenation 
process is carried out in mid-cycle where the temperature of the partially coked 
ZSM-5 bed is raised and a hydrogen-containing light-gas recirculated [ 1281. 
This process probably combines pyrolysis and coke remobilisation with some 
degree of hydrogenation and has the effect of regenerating catalytic activity 
and increasing the time-on-stream before a full regeneration procedure is 
required. 
Extraction of coke by solvents has been shown [ 1741 to be effective for ZSM- 
5 used as a dewaxing catalyst at about 330°C. While extraction with, for ex- 
ample, tetrahydrofuran was successful in removing a substantial part of the 
coke, nitrogen bases were still largely retained. Simultaneous ion exchange 
with solvent extraction proved successful in removing these bases. 
8. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
It is now possible to characterise down to the molecular level an intractable, 
amorphous material such as coke formed in high-silica zeolites during the con- 
version reactions of oxygenates and hydrocarbons. This is largely due to the 
availability of a number of new physical techniques which are ideally suited to 
this task. Moreover, the chemistry behind coke formation can be pieced to- 
gether using a variety of techniques, including NMR, FT-IR and UV-visible 
spectroscopies, and TPD-MS, which can follow coke formation in situ for a 
range of reaction conditions. Information obtained in this manner can be suc- 
cessfully correlated with the findings of solvent extraction/GC-MS 
studies of 
coke. Hence, it is with some degree of confidence that overall reaction schemes 
can be written for coke formation in high-silica zeolites, showing that it is a 
complex process consisting of many sequential and parallel reaction steps end- 
ing in coke. The nature of this carbonaceous material depends on several key 
D.M. Bibby et al./Appl. Catal. A 93 (1992) l-34 
29 
parameters, namely, the type of reactants and reaction conditions used, and 
the aluminium content, acid site density and channel dimensionality of the 
zeolite. 
Recent findings that much of the lattice aluminium in high-silica zeolites 
can be removed by reaction or catalyst treatment have important implications 
for coke formation chemistry. The acid sites initiating both desired reactions 
and coke formation cannot be regarded as fixed components in the catalyst. 
Both the concentration and nature of acid sites may change as reaction pro- 
ceeds or as the catalyst is regenerated. More research is needed on the role 
played by extraframework aluminium species. 
Some work has been done on ways of extending the lifetime of zeolites em- 
ployed in various conversion processes and on the regeneration of coked zeo- 
lites. However, in both cases more can be done, especially with respect to lim- 
iting coke formation under actual process conditions. 
Finally, it should be acknowledged that much of the information regarding 
coke formation and removal in commercially used zeolites is held confiden- 
tially by the companies responsible for their development as catalysts.
