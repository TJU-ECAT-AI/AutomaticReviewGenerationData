[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been considered as an alternative route for production of propylene, which is an important raw material in the production of polypropylene, acrolein, acrylic acid, polygas chemicals and oligomers [8,9]."
[2] "The role of platinum modifiers is to selectively weaken the platinum-paraffin interaction. Arsenic, tin or germanium are among the metals reported as being platinum activity modifiers."
[3] "Experiments have indicated that the presence of very small amounts of oxygenated additives such as water can reduce the amount of coke accumulated on the catalyst surface and enhance catalyst activity."
[4] "The addition of water as an oxygenated modifier to the feed in optimum amounts could result in a substantial reduction in coke formation as well as an increase in the catalyst activity."
[5] "The model predictions for both propane conversion and coke formation with time-on-stream were in good agreement with experimental data."
[6] "An example is illustrated in Fig. 1 where predicted and experimental propane conversions are plotted against time-on-stream for different amounts of water in the feed on for reaction temperature of 620 oC, indicating the ability of the proposed model to predict the optimum amount of water for maximum propane conversion."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) serves as an alternative method for producing propylene, a key ingredient in the synthesis of polypropylene, acrolein, acrylic acid, polygas chemicals, and oligomers.
2. Platinum modifiers play a role in selectively weakening the interaction between platinum and paraffin.
3. The presence of small amounts of oxygenated additives, such as water, can decrease the accumulation of coke on the catalyst surface and boost catalyst performance.
4. Adding water as an oxygenated additive to the feed can significantly reduce coke formation and enhance catalyst activity.
5. The model accurately forecasts both propane conversion and coke formation trends over time, aligning with experimental outcomes.
6. Figure 1 visually demonstrates the model's capability to determine the optimal amount of water for maximizing propane conversion, based on the relationship between water content and propane conversion over time at a reaction temperature of 620°C.
