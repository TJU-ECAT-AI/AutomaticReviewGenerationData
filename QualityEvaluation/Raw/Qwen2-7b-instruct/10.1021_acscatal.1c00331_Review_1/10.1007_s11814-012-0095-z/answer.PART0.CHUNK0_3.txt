To properly describe the kinetics of coke deposition on the catalyst leading to a decrease in the catalyst activity, it is important to include a kinetic expression for coke gasification which occurs in parallel with monolayer-multilayer coke formation. The follow- ing expression was used for the amount of gasified coke: Cg = k2G Cm + CM ( ) nG × time 0.5 × 1+ KWGpH2 pH2O - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The amount of gasified coke was calculated using the expression Cg = k2G Cm + CM ( ) nG × time 0.5 × 1+ KWGpH2 pH2O. This accounts for the concurrent coke formation and gasification processes on the catalyst surface, contributing to the catalyst deactivation over time.

The overall quality of optimization can be judged from an acceptable agreement between experimental and predicted propane conversions as reported in Tables1 to 3. An example is illustrated in Fig. 1 where predicted and experimental propane conversions are plotted against time-on-stream for different amounts of water added to feed on for reaction temperature of 620 oC,indicating the ability of the proposed model to predict the optimum amount of water for maximum propane conversion.

The optimization's effectiveness is assessed by the reasonable alignment between experimental and forecasted propane conversion percentages, as demonstrated in Tables 1 to 3. As depicted in Figure 1, the model accurately predicts the ideal quantity of water needed for the highest propane conversion rate at a 620°C reaction temperature, showing its capability to forecast the optimal water addition.
