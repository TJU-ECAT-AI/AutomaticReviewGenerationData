[1] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction that requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to achieve high yields of propylene."
[2] "The main problem in catalytic PDH is the rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
[3] "An increase in the water content of the feed would reduce deactivation due to enhanced coke gasification on the one hand, and on the other hand, it would enhance deactivation due to sintering."
[4] "Limited experimental data was available for the coke content of the spent catalysts, and the agreement between experimental and predicted coke content was also satisfactory."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke formation is influenced by factors such as temperature, catalyst composition, and the presence of oxygenated additives like water. The coke deposits consist of a variety of compounds, primarily derived from propane and its derivatives. In PDH reactions, coke formation is a critical issue that leads to catalyst deactivation. The coke deposits can include a range of hydrocarbons and other byproducts depending on the reaction conditions. Analytical techniques, such as gas chromatography and elemental analysis, have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. The coke content in the spent catalysts can vary significantly based on the reaction conditions, and understanding its composition helps in optimizing the process and improving catalyst performance.
