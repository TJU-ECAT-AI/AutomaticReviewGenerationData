[1] "The model used in this work to describe coke formation is a simple mechanistic model called the monolayer-multilayer coke growth model (MMCGM)."
[2] "The presence of steam in the reaction mixture leads to a continuous gasification of the deposited coke so that the experimentally measured rate of coke formation is a net rate resulting from both deposition and gasification."
[3] "To properly describe the kinetics of coke deposition on the catalyst leading to a decrease in the catalyst activity, it is important to include a kinetic expression for coke gasification which occurs in parallel with monolayer-multilayer coke formation."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The monolayer-multilayer coke growth model (MMCGM) is used to describe the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents. Steam and oxygenated additives, such as water, play crucial roles in the gasification of deposited coke, affecting the net rate of coke formation. Including a kinetic expression for coke gasification helps in accurately modeling the kinetics of coke deposition and its impact on catalyst activity.

催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭沉积物组成，在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下会有所不同。使用单层-多层焦炭生长模型（MMCGM）来描述焦炭构成的复杂性和多样性。蒸汽和氧化添加剂，如水，对沉积焦炭的气化起着关键作用，影响焦炭形成速率的净值。将焦炭气化动力学表达式包括在内有助于准确模拟焦炭沉积的动力学及其对催化剂活性的影响。
