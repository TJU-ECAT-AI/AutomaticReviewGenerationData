[1] "Deactivation of a solid catalyst by a coking mechanism is often extremely complex, because coke precursors can arise from reactant molecules, product molecules, reactive intermediates, and combinations thereof."
[2] "A number of empirical models have been proposed to relate catalyst activity to catalyst coke content, both for experimental data interpretation and for reactor design."
[3] "An alternative approach is suggested which provides a simpler perspective on activity-coke relationships for high levels of coke associated with mul-tilayer coverage of a catalyst surface during coke-induced deactivation."
[4] "The multilayer coke is expected to be formed at a rate proportional to the monolayer coke initiator and the partial pressure of the coke precursor."
[5] "Equation 19 can be integrated, for a differential reactor,a point in an integral reactor,or a thermobalance (constant Pi),to yield (20) where q = al(l - a) - cy2"

1. The deactivation of a solid catalyst through a coking mechanism is highly complex due to the various origins of coke precursors, including reactant molecules, product molecules, reactive intermediates, and their combinations.

2. Numerous empirical models have been developed to connect catalyst activity with catalyst coke content, serving both for interpreting experimental data and designing reactors.

3. An alternative method is proposed to offer a clearer view of the relationship between activity and coke content in cases of high coke levels associated with multi-layer coverage of a catalyst surface during coking deactivation.

4. The rate of formation of multilayer coke is anticipated to be proportional to the initiator of monolayer coke and the partial pressure of the coke precursor.

5. Equation 19 can be integrated into a differential reactor, an integral reactor, or a thermobalance (with constant Pi) to yield (20), where q = al(l - a) - cy2.

1. 催化剂通过焦化机制失活通常极其复杂，因为焦炭前体可以源自反应物分子、产物分子、活性中间体以及它们的组合。

2. 已经提出了许多经验模型来连接催化剂活性与催化剂焦炭含量，既用于解释实验数据，也用于设计反应器。

3. 提出了另一种方法来提供高焦炭水平下多层覆盖催化剂表面期间焦化导致的失活中活动和焦炭关系的更清晰视角。

4. 预期多层焦炭的形成速率与单层焦炭起始物和焦炭前体的压力成正比。

5. 方程19可以通过对差分反应器、积分反应器或热平衡（常数Pi）进行积分，得出（20），其中q = al(l - a) - cy2。
