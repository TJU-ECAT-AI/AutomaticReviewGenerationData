[1] "Deactivation of a solid catalyst by a coking mechanism is often extremely complex, because coke precursors can arise from reactant molecules, product molecules, reactive intermediates, and combinations thereof."
[2] "Most mechanistic models of catalyst deactivation employ Langmuir isotherm theory in their derivation, leading either to the classical hyperbolic Hougen-Watson models or to power function models (for sparsely covered surfaces)."
[3] "A model is presented which provides a relationship between catalyst activity and catalyst coke content, based upon the formation of both monolayer and multilayer coke."
[4] "The model adequately fits experimental data which previously had required three separate empirical activity-coke deactivation models, based upon linear, exponential,or hyperbolic equation forms."
[5] "The model contains ratios of rate constants which, depending upon their respective activation energies,can accommodate all the observed temperature dependencies of the empirical model forms."
[6] "It is also useful to speculate about the value of eq 20 in representing observed coke-time profiles, relative to the other empirical coke-activity equations."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke deposits can originate from reactant molecules, product molecules, reactive intermediates, and combinations thereof. Analytical techniques that have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems typically involve a combination of chemical analysis, such as elemental analysis, and physical methods like scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). These techniques help in identifying the chemical makeup of the coke deposits, including the presence of various organic and inorganic compounds, and understanding their spatial distribution on the catalyst surface. The coke deposits can affect catalyst performance by blocking active sites, reducing the surface area, and altering the reactivity of the catalyst. Understanding the detailed structure and composition of coke deposits is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate deactivation and optimize catalytic performance.
