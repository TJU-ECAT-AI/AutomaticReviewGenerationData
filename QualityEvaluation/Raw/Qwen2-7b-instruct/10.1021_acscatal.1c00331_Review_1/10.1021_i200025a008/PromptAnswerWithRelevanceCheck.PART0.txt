[1] "Deactivation of a solid catalyst by a coking mechanism is often extremely complex, because coke precursors can arise from reactant molecules, product molecules, reactive intermediates, and combinations thereof."
[2] "Most mechanistic models of catalyst deactivation employ Langmuir isotherm theory in their derivation, leading either to the classical hyperbolic Hougen-Watson models or to power function models (for sparsely covered surfaces)."
[3] "A model is presented which provides a relationship between catalyst activity and catalyst coke content, based upon the formation of both monolayer and multilayer coke."
[4] "The model adequately fits experimental data which previously had required three separate empirical activity-coke deactivation models, based upon linear, exponential,or hyperbolic equation forms."
[5] "The model contains ratios of rate constants which, depending upon their respective activation energies,can accommodate all the observed temperature dependencies of the empirical model forms."
[6] "It is also useful to speculate about the value of eq 20 in representing observed coke-time profiles, relative to the other empirical coke-activity equations."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke deposits can originate from reactant molecules, product molecules, reactive intermediates, and combinations thereof. Analytical techniques that have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems typically involve a combination of chemical analysis, such as elemental analysis, and physical methods like scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). These techniques help in identifying the chemical makeup of the coke deposits, including the presence of various organic and inorganic compounds, and understanding their spatial distribution on the catalyst surface. The coke deposits can affect catalyst performance by blocking active sites, reducing the surface area, and altering the reactivity of the catalyst. Understanding the detailed structure and composition of coke deposits is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate deactivation and optimize catalytic performance.

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下变化很大。焦炭沉积物可能来源于反应物分子、产物分子、活性中间体以及它们的组合。用于揭示这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性的分析技术通常包括化学分析，如元素分析，以及物理方法，如扫描电子显微镜（SEM）结合能量色散X射线光谱（EDS）。这些技术有助于确定焦炭沉积物的化学组成，包括各种有机和无机化合物的存在及其在催化剂表面的空间分布情况。焦炭沉积物会通过堵塞活性位点、减少表面积和改变催化剂活性来影响催化剂性能。理解焦炭沉积物的详细结构和组成对于制定减轻失活和优化催化性能策略至关重要。

[1] "For the activity-coke relationships to gain wide use, with confidence in their practical applicability,a more complete theoretical description is required which places the disparate experimental observations summarized earlier into a die d perspective."
[2] "The model, as derived, provides the same activ- ity-coke relationship for both parallel and series fouling;only the coke-bed length relationship is thereby altered."
[3] "Conversion of coal to cyclohexane soluble material is reproducible and correlates well with the conversion to 538 O C (1000 O F ) minus boiling point liquids obtained by larger scale process units."
[4] "We caution the reader, therefore,that, based on our experience, one assumes a real risk of deriving erroneous conclusions should the procedures not be followed carefully."

1. A more complete theoretical description is needed to integrate the varied experimental observations regarding activity-coke relationships and place them in a coherent perspective.
2. The derived model maintains the same activity-coke relationship for parallel and series fouling scenarios, with only the coke-bed length relationship changing.
3. The conversion of coal to cyclohexane-soluble material is consistent and correlates well with the conversion to 538 °C (1000 °F) minus boiling point liquids from larger-scale processes.
4. The authors warn that failing to meticulously follow the procedures can lead to incorrect conclusions in the research.

1. The deactivation of a solid catalyst through a coking mechanism is highly complex due to the various origins of coke precursors, including reactant molecules, product molecules, reactive intermediates, and their combinations.

2. Numerous empirical models have been developed to connect catalyst activity with catalyst coke content, serving both for interpreting experimental data and designing reactors.

3. An alternative method is proposed to offer a clearer view of the relationship between activity and coke content in cases of high coke levels associated with multi-layer coverage of a catalyst surface during coking deactivation.

4. The rate of formation of multilayer coke is anticipated to be proportional to the initiator of monolayer coke and the partial pressure of the coke precursor.

5. Equation 19 can be integrated into a differential reactor, an integral reactor, or a thermobalance (with constant Pi) to yield (20), where q = al(l - a) - cy2.
