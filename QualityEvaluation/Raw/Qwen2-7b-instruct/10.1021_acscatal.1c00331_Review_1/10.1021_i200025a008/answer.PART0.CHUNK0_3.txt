[1] "For the activity-coke relationships to gain wide use, with confidence in their practical applicability,a more complete theoretical description is required which places the disparate experimental observations summarized earlier into a die d perspective."
[2] "The model, as derived, provides the same activ- ity-coke relationship for both parallel and series fouling;only the coke-bed length relationship is thereby altered."
[3] "Conversion of coal to cyclohexane soluble material is reproducible and correlates well with the conversion to 538 O C (1000 O F ) minus boiling point liquids obtained by larger scale process units."
[4] "We caution the reader, therefore,that, based on our experience, one assumes a real risk of deriving erroneous conclusions should the procedures not be followed carefully."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. A more complete theoretical description is needed to integrate the varied experimental observations regarding activity-coke relationships and place them in a coherent perspective.
2. The derived model maintains the same activity-coke relationship for parallel and series fouling scenarios, with only the coke-bed length relationship changing.
3. The conversion of coal to cyclohexane-soluble material is consistent and correlates well with the conversion to 538 °C (1000 °F) minus boiling point liquids from larger-scale processes.
4. The authors warn that failing to meticulously follow the procedures can lead to incorrect conclusions in the research.

1. 需要更全面的理论描述来整合实验观察结果，并将其置于一个连贯的视角中。
2. 所提出的模型在并联和串联降解情况下提供相同的活性-焦炭关系，仅焦炭床长度关系发生变化。
3. 煤炭转化为环己烷可溶物的转化率是可重复的，并且与从大型过程单元获得的538°C（1000°F）减去沸点液体的转化率很好地对应。
4. 作者警告说，如果未能仔细遵循程序，则可能得出错误的结论。
