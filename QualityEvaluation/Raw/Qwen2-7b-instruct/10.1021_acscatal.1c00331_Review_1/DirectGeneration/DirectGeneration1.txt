Coke deposition in catalytic systems, particularly within the context of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, represents a multifaceted challenge that requires a deep understanding of its composition, variability, and analysis. This phenomenon is influenced by a myriad of factors including reaction conditions, the type of catalyst employed, and the analytical methods utilized for characterization. The composition of coke deposits is complex, comprising various hydrocarbon species and structural elements that can significantly impact the efficiency and longevity of PDH processes. Variability in coke formation is observed across different operational conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock properties, necessitating a nuanced approach to its study. Catalyst selection plays a pivotal role in determining the coke deposition pattern, with certain materials being more prone to coke buildup than others. Analytical techniques, including spectroscopic methods, microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis, provide insights into the coke's structure and evolution over time, enabling researchers to monitor and optimize process parameters to mitigate coke formation. The comprehensive analysis of coke deposits thus involves integrating knowledge from chemical engineering, materials science, and analytical chemistry to develop strategies for enhancing the performance and sustainability of PDH reactions.
