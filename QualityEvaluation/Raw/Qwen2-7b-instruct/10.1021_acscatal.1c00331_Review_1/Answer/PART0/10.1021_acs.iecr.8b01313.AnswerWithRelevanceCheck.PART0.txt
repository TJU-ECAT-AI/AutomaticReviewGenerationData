          The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly based on different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) have been utilized to investigate the intricate and diverse makeup of coke components in these systems.
