1. Gas bearing shale beds exhibit seven fundamental characteristics: continuous large-scale distribution, widespread lamina and bedding, abundant nanoscale organic pores, enrichment of sweet spot areas, thermogenic free gas as the determining factor for output, achieving high output through control of natural fracture density and over-pressure development degree, and the development of an artificial shale reservoir as a horizontal well fracturing network.
          2. There are instances where drilling wells beyond 3500 meters in depth has yielded unsatisfactory test results.
          3. Considering a single well investment cost of USD 4 million and ultimate recoverable reserves of 1.06 x 10^8 m3, the estimated internal rate of return is calculated to be 9.1%.
