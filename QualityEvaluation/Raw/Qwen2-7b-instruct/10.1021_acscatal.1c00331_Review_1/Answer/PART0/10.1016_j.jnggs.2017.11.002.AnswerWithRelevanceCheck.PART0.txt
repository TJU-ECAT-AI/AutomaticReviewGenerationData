          [1] "Gas bearing shale beds are characterized by continuous distribution in large area,lamina and bedding in widespread development, abundant nanoscale organic pores, sweet spot area (section)enrichment, thermogenic free gas as decisive factor to determine output, high output to be achieved by control of natural fracture density and over pressure development degree and development of artificial shale reservoir as horizontal well fracturing network, which are considered as 7 basic characteristics."
          [2] "There are many wells drilled down to the depth of more than 3500 m in some blocks, but the test results therein are poor."
          [3] "In case that the single well is USD 4 million in investment cost and (EUR) 1.06 108 m3 in ultimate recoverable reserves, it is estimated that its internal rate of return is 9.1%."

          1. Gas bearing shale beds exhibit seven fundamental characteristics: continuous large-scale distribution, widespread lamina and bedding, abundant nanoscale organic pores, enrichment of sweet spot areas, thermogenic free gas as the determining factor for output, achieving high output through control of natural fracture density and over-pressure development degree, and the development of an artificial shale reservoir as a horizontal well fracturing network.
          2. There are instances where drilling wells beyond 3500 meters in depth has yielded unsatisfactory test results.
          3. Considering a single well investment cost of USD 4 million and ultimate recoverable reserves of 1.06 x 10^8 m3, the estimated internal rate of return is calculated to be 9.1%.

          1. 含气页岩床具有七个基本特征：大规模连续分布、广泛层状和层带发育、丰富的纳米尺度有机孔隙、甜点区的富集、热解自由气体作为决定产出的关键因素、通过控制天然裂缝密度和过压发展程度实现高产出，以及在水平井压裂网络中开发人工页岩储层。
          2. 存在钻探深度超过3500米的区块，但测试结果不尽如人意的情况。
          3. 考虑单井投资成本为400万美元和最终可采储量为1.06 x 10^8立方米的情况下，估计的内部收益率计算得出为9.1%。
