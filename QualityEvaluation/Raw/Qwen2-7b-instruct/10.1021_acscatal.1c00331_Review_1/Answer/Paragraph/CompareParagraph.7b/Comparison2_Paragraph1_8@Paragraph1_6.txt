    "Summary": "Both reviews excel in providing comprehensive, accurate, and insightful analyses of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in PDH reactions. They are equally strong in organizing content coherently, integrating interdisciplinary perspectives, and proposing innovative research directions. However, they both fall short in detailing the research methodology and rigorously describing experimental setups. Both articles effectively contribute to the field with practical implications and feasible suggestions. The slight difference in scores is due to minor variations in writing quality and clarity of argumentation, but neither review stands out distinctly above the other."
