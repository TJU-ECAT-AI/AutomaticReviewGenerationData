    "Summary": "Both articles provide comprehensive reviews of coke deposits in catalytic systems, covering the composition, variability, and analysis of these deposits in propane dehydrogenation reactions. They offer insightful analyses of the influence of reaction conditions, catalyst types, and analytical techniques. However, neither article presents groundbreaking innovations or novel perspectives. Both articles are well-structured, with clear introductions and conclusions, and they use appropriate citation formats and recent literature. Their writing quality is comparable, and they both suggest feasible areas for future research. The main difference lies in the depth of analysis and critical thinking, where both articles demonstrate logical argumentation and multi-angle problem analysis, but neither fully explores the limitations of their studies."
