They both offer innovative insights and contribute to the field with potential for practical application. Their structures are well-organized, and they avoid plagiarism. However, they lack in-depth analysis of methodologies, which affects their rigor. Both articles propose new research directions and have timely inclusion of recent literature. Their writing quality is adequate, but there is room for improvement in fluency and conciseness. Neither review stands out distinctly over the other in terms of overall quality."
