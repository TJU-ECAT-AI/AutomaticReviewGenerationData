[1] "The effect of the hydrogen concentration in the propane feed on coke deposition was of special interest. It was found that the Raman bands originating from coke deposits become narrower as hydrogen is added to the feed."
[2] "Secondly, the position of the Raman G band changes towards higher wavenumbers."
[3] "A third trend is an increase in the D1/G ratio as the concentration of hydrogen increases."
[4] "This points towards the formation of less coke, which has a more graphitic nature as a function of increasing hydrogen concentration."
[5] "The corresponding on-line activity data shows that the addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the conversion and selectivity of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst."
[6] "The deactivation of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst was slowed down significantly by the addition of hydrogen, resulting in a more stable catalyst."
[7] "The increase in catalytic performance is attributed to hydrogen assisting in keeping the active sites for dehydrogenation free of coke deposits."

1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies based on reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques like operando Raman spectroscopy have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. As hydrogen concentration in the propane feed increases, the Raman bands originating from coke deposits become narrower, the position of the Raman G band shifts towards higher wavenumbers, and the D1/G ratio increases, indicating the formation of less coke with a more graphitic nature. This change in coke composition correlates with enhanced catalytic performance.

2. The addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the conversion and selectivity of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, slowing down the deactivation of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst and resulting in a more stable catalyst. This improvement in catalytic performance is attributed to hydrogen assisting in keeping the active sites for dehydrogenation free of coke deposits.

1. 在催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成根据反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。分析技术如在操作条件下进行的拉曼光谱法被用来揭示这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性。随着丙烷流中氢浓度的增加，源自焦炭沉积物的拉曼谱带变得更窄，Raman G谱带的位置向更高波数移动，并且D1/G比率增加，表明形成了更少、结构更有序的焦炭。这种焦炭组成的改变与催化性能的增强有关。

2. 将氢添加到流中可以提高Pt/Al2O3催化剂的转化率和选择性，减缓Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂的失活过程，从而得到更加稳定的催化剂。这种催化性能的提升归因于氢帮助保持脱氢活性位点免受焦炭沉积的影响。
