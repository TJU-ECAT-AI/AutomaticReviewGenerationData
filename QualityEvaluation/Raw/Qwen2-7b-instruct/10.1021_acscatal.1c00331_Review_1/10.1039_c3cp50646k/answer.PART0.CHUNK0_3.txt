1. The addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the conversion of propane in the PDH reaction.

2. During the initial cycles, the addition of hydrogen to the feed reduces the selectivity towards propene.

3. The intensity, band position, and bandwidth of various Raman features were examined to determine the nature of coke deposits.

4. The shift in the position of the G Raman band suggests that the size of the graphitic crystallites has decreased.

5. The narrowing of the Raman bands indicates a more ordered carbon structure with fewer defects.

6. An increase in the D1/G ratio correlates with an enhanced hydrogen concentration in the feed.

7. The Raman band positions, related widths, and the D1/G ratio remain unchanged throughout catalyst cycling.

8. Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) supports the findings from operando Raman spectroscopy regarding coke formation.

9. Hydrogen addition results in the formation of smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites.

10. TGA confirms that less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen.
