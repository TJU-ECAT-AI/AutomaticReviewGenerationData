The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Hydrogen addition to the feed influences the coke deposit's characteristics. Operando Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that hydrogen alters the nature of the coke deposits, leading to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites with fewer defects. Thermogravimetrical analysis confirms that hydrogen addition decreases coke formation. Consequently, the conversion and selectivity of the catalyst improve, as evidenced by on-line activity measurements. The stability of the catalyst is enhanced, with hydrogen reducing the drop in conversion between cycles.

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下显著变化。向燃料流中添加氢气会影响焦炭沉积物的特性。原位拉曼光谱显示，氢气改变了焦炭沉积物的性质，导致形成更小、更有序的石墨结晶体，缺陷更少。热重分析证实，氢气添加减少了焦炭的形成。因此，催化剂的转化率和选择性得到改善，这在在线活性测量中得到了证明。催化剂的稳定性增强，氢气减少了周期间转化率的下降。
