[1] "First of all, the presence of hydrogen increases the conversion of propane."
[2] "Secondly, the corresponding selectivities to propene are shown in Fig. 1b and 1e. The addition of hydrogen lowers the propene selectivity during the first cycles."
[3] "For the tenth cycle, the selectivity to propene is 43% for the 100% propane feed and 73% for the feed containing 50% propane, which is the highest selectivity measured on this catalyst material for this cycle."
[4] "The addition of H2 increases catalyst stability, meaning it decreases the drop in conversion between cycles."
[5] "Within a single cycle the catalytic conversion is stable on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is explained by reduced coke formation and the flow off effect."
[6] "The Raman bands become narrower and the positions appear to shift to lower wavenumbers."
[7] "The addition of H2 decreases the crystallite size of the graphite particles."
[8] "As less coke is deposited, which has a more graphitic nature, side reactions such as cracking are suppressed."
[9] "The amount of amorphous coke, as shown by the intensity of the D3 band decreases with increasing hydrogen content."
[10] "Interestingly, for these experiments the selectivity increases for each following cycle, suggesting a correlation with the type of coke formed."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies based on the reaction conditions and catalyst type. Hydrogen addition to the feed influences the nature of coke deposits. The Raman spectroscopy analysis reveals that as hydrogen concentration increases, the coke deposits become narrower, their position shifts towards higher wavenumbers, and the D1/G ratio increases, indicating the formation of less coke with a more graphitic nature. This results in increased catalytic performance, as evidenced by enhanced conversion and selectivity in the PDH reactions. The addition of hydrogen leads to a decrease in the amount of amorphous coke and an increase in the stability and selectivity of the catalyst, suggesting a correlation between the type of coke formed and the suppression of side reactions like cracking.

在催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成根据反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。氢添加到流体中会影响焦炭沉积物的性质。拉曼光谱分析显示，随着氢浓度的增加，焦炭沉积物变得更窄，位置向较高波数偏移，并且D1/G比率增加，表明形成较少具有更石墨性质的焦炭。这导致催化性能的提高，表现为PDH反应中的转化率和选择性的增加。氢的添加减少了无定形焦炭的量，并提高了催化剂的稳定性和选择性，表明焦炭形成的类型与抑制副反应如裂解之间的关联。
