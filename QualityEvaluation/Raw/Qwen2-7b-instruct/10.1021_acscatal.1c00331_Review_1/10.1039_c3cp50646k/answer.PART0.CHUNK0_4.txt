[1] "The addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the conversion of propane."
[2] "The corresponding selectivities to propene are shown in Fig. 10 1b and 1e. The addition of hydrogen lowers the propene selectivity during the first cycles."
[3] "For the tenth cycle, the selectivity to propene is 43% for the 100% propane feed and 73% for the feed containing 50% propane, which is the highest selectivity measured on this catalyst material for this cycle."
[4] "For the first, third and tenth cycle a higher conversion (2a), selectivity (2b) and yield (2c), in agreement with what has been reported in literature."
[5] "The corresponding on-line activity data shows that the addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the conversion and selectivity of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst."
[6] "The addition of hydrogen to the feed increases catalyst stability, meaning it decreases the drop in conversion between cycles."
[7] "For the experiments with 50 and 25% propane on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst only fluorescence was detected."
[8] "Our experiments have shown that the formation and maturing of coke quenches fluorescence."
[9] "From the operando Raman spectra we conclude, that the addition of hydrogen leads to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites."
[10] "The corresponding on-line activity data shows that the addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the conversion and selectivity of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst."

1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies with the addition of hydrogen to the feed. This leads to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites being formed. 

2. Analytical techniques such as operando Raman spectroscopy have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. These techniques allow for detailed on-line information on the coke deposition during the actual dehydrogenation reaction and changes in the nature of the coke species as a function of time.

3. The addition of hydrogen to the feed influences the structure of coke deposits by promoting the formation of more graphitic coke, which mainly covers the catalyst support, compared to disordered coke that is also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles.

4. The operando Raman spectra data correlates well with the activity data, showing that the conversion and selectivity of the catalyst increases when hydrogen is added. This suggests that hydrogen assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of disordered coke species, thus improving the overall catalytic performance.

5. Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) supports the findings from operando Raman spectroscopy, confirming that less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen. The coke deposited in the presence of hydrogen combusts at higher temperatures, indicating a more ordered structure.

6. The addition of hydrogen to the feed results in a more stable catalyst, as evidenced by the slowed down deactivation of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. This is attributed to hydrogen assisting in keeping the active sites for dehydrogenation free of coke deposits, leading to improved catalytic performance.

1. 在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随着氢气添加到流体中的变化而变化。这导致形成更小、更有序的石墨晶体结构。

2. 分析技术，如在操作条件下进行的拉曼光谱分析，已被用于揭示这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性。这些技术允许对实际脱氢反应期间的焦炭沉积提供详细的在线信息，并随时间观察焦炭物种的变化。

3. 氢气添加到流体中会影响焦炭沉积物的结构，通过促进更石墨状焦炭的形成，该焦炭主要覆盖催化剂支撑，与在支持的Pt纳米粒子上存在的无序焦炭相比。

4. 操作条件下的拉曼光谱数据与活性数据相关，表明当添加氢气时催化剂的转化率和选择性增加。这表明氢气有助于保持Pt表面免受无序焦炭物种的影响，从而提高整体催化性能。

5. 热重分析（TGA）支持拉曼光谱分析的结果，确认在氢气存在下形成的焦炭的燃烧温度更高，表明结构更有序。

6. 添加氢气到流体中会导致催化剂更稳定，这是由于氢气有助于保持脱氢活性位点免受焦炭沉积的抑制，从而提高了催化性能。
