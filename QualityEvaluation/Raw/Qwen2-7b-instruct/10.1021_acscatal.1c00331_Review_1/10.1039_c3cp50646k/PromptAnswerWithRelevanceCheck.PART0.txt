The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Hydrogen addition to the feed influences the coke deposit's characteristics. Operando Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that hydrogen alters the nature of the coke deposits, leading to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites with fewer defects. Thermogravimetrical analysis confirms that hydrogen addition decreases coke formation. Consequently, the conversion and selectivity of the catalyst improve, as evidenced by on-line activity measurements. The stability of the catalyst is enhanced, with hydrogen reducing the drop in conversion between cycles.

[1] "First of all, the presence of hydrogen increases the conversion of propane."
[2] "Secondly, the corresponding selectivities to propene are shown in Fig. 1b and 1e. The addition of hydrogen lowers the propene selectivity during the first cycles."
[3] "For the tenth cycle, the selectivity to propene is 43% for the 100% propane feed and 73% for the feed containing 50% propane, which is the highest selectivity measured on this catalyst material for this cycle."
[4] "The addition of H2 increases catalyst stability, meaning it decreases the drop in conversion between cycles."
[5] "Within a single cycle the catalytic conversion is stable on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is explained by reduced coke formation and the flow off effect."
[6] "The Raman bands become narrower and the positions appear to shift to lower wavenumbers."
[7] "The addition of H2 decreases the crystallite size of the graphite particles."
[8] "As less coke is deposited, which has a more graphitic nature, side reactions such as cracking are suppressed."
[9] "The amount of amorphous coke, as shown by the intensity of the D3 band decreases with increasing hydrogen content."
[10] "Interestingly, for these experiments the selectivity increases for each following cycle, suggesting a correlation with the type of coke formed."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies based on the reaction conditions and catalyst type. Hydrogen addition to the feed influences the nature of coke deposits. The Raman spectroscopy analysis reveals that as hydrogen concentration increases, the coke deposits become narrower, their position shifts towards higher wavenumbers, and the D1/G ratio increases, indicating the formation of less coke with a more graphitic nature. This results in increased catalytic performance, as evidenced by enhanced conversion and selectivity in the PDH reactions. The addition of hydrogen leads to a decrease in the amount of amorphous coke and an increase in the stability and selectivity of the catalyst, suggesting a correlation between the type of coke formed and the suppression of side reactions like cracking.

在催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成根据反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。氢添加到流体中会影响焦炭沉积物的性质。拉曼光谱分析显示，随着氢浓度的增加，焦炭沉积物变得更窄，位置向较高波数偏移，并且D1/G比率增加，表明形成较少具有更石墨性质的焦炭。这导致催化性能的提高，表现为PDH反应中的转化率和选择性的增加。氢的添加减少了无定形焦炭的量，并提高了催化剂的稳定性和选择性，表明焦炭形成的类型与抑制副反应如裂解之间的关联。

[1] "The effect of the hydrogen concentration in the propane feed on coke deposition was of special interest. It was found that the Raman bands originating from coke deposits become narrower as hydrogen is added to the feed."
[2] "Secondly, the position of the Raman G band changes towards higher wavenumbers."
[3] "A third trend is an increase in the D1/G ratio as the concentration of hydrogen increases."
[4] "This points towards the formation of less coke, which has a more graphitic nature as a function of increasing hydrogen concentration."
[5] "The corresponding on-line activity data shows that the addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the conversion and selectivity of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst."
[6] "The deactivation of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst was slowed down significantly by the addition of hydrogen, resulting in a more stable catalyst."
[7] "The increase in catalytic performance is attributed to hydrogen assisting in keeping the active sites for dehydrogenation free of coke deposits."

1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies based on reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques like operando Raman spectroscopy have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. As hydrogen concentration in the propane feed increases, the Raman bands originating from coke deposits become narrower, the position of the Raman G band shifts towards higher wavenumbers, and the D1/G ratio increases, indicating the formation of less coke with a more graphitic nature. This change in coke composition correlates with enhanced catalytic performance.

2. The addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the conversion and selectivity of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, slowing down the deactivation of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst and resulting in a more stable catalyst. This improvement in catalytic performance is attributed to hydrogen assisting in keeping the active sites for dehydrogenation free of coke deposits.

1. 在催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成根据反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。分析技术如在操作条件下进行的拉曼光谱法被用来揭示这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性。随着丙烷流中氢浓度的增加，源自焦炭沉积物的拉曼谱带变得更窄，Raman G谱带的位置向更高波数移动，并且D1/G比率增加，表明形成了更少、结构更有序的焦炭。这种焦炭组成的改变与催化性能的增强有关。

2. 将氢添加到流中可以提高Pt/Al2O3催化剂的转化率和选择性，减缓Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂的失活过程，从而得到更加稳定的催化剂。这种催化性能的提升归因于氢帮助保持脱氢活性位点免受焦炭沉积的影响。

1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies with the addition of hydrogen to the feed. This leads to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites being formed. 

2. Analytical techniques such as operando Raman spectroscopy have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. These techniques allow for detailed on-line information on the coke deposition during the actual dehydrogenation reaction and changes in the nature of the coke species as a function of time.

3. The addition of hydrogen to the feed influences the structure of coke deposits by promoting the formation of more graphitic coke, which mainly covers the catalyst support, compared to disordered coke that is also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles.

4. The operando Raman spectra data correlates well with the activity data, showing that the conversion and selectivity of the catalyst increases when hydrogen is added. This suggests that hydrogen assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of disordered coke species, thus improving the overall catalytic performance.

5. Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) supports the findings from operando Raman spectroscopy, confirming that less coke is formed in the presence of hydrogen. The coke deposited in the presence of hydrogen combusts at higher temperatures, indicating a more ordered structure.

6. The addition of hydrogen to the feed results in a more stable catalyst, as evidenced by the slowed down deactivation of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. This is attributed to hydrogen assisting in keeping the active sites for dehydrogenation free of coke deposits, leading to improved catalytic performance.
