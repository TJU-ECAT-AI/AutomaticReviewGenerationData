[1] "Two types of coke are identified on coked PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and assigned to coke on the metal and the support, respectively."
[2] "Coke formed on the metal has aliphatic hydrocarbon characteristic, containing more hydrogen than that formed on the support."
[3] "Coke formed on the support has an aromatic characteristic."
[4] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure while the rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure."

1. Two types of coke deposits are identified in catalytic systems, specifically in propane dehydrogenation reactions. One type is found on the metal surface, exhibiting an aliphatic hydrocarbon characteristic with a higher hydrogen content, while the other type is found on the support, displaying an aromatic characteristic.

2. The rate of coke formation on the metal surface is influenced by the propane pressure, showing a weak dependency on the propylene and hydrogen pressures, but increasing with the propane pressure. 

3. The rate of coke formation on the support increases with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure.

4. A kinetic mechanism for coke formation is proposed, which includes the reaction between two strong adsorbed C3H6* intermediates formed by the dehydrogenation of propane as the key step on the metal surface.

5. A portion of the coke precursor migrates from the metal surface to the support, undergoing polymerization, condensation, cyclization, and hydride transfer reactions, contributing to the formation of hard coke on the support.

1. 在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢反应中，识别出两种类型的焦炭沉积物。一种在金属表面，具有脂肪族烃的特性，并且氢含量较高；另一种在支撑材料上，显示芳烃特性。

2. 金属表面的焦炭形成速率受丙烷压力的影响，对丙烯和氢气压力的依赖较弱，但随着丙烷压力的增加而增加。

3. 支撑材料上的焦炭形成速率随着丙烷和丙烯压力的增加而增加，并随着氢气压力的降低而减少。

4. 基于动力学分析提出了焦炭形成机制，其中，在金属表面形成的两个强吸附的C3H6*中间体之间的反应被确定为关键步骤。

5. 从金属表面迁移到支撑材料的部分焦炭前体，通过聚合、缩合、环化和氢转移等反应，导致在支撑材料上形成硬焦炭。
