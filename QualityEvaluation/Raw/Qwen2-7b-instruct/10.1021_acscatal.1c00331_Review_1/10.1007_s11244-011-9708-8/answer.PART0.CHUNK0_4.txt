[1] "Two kinds of coke are identified from the TPO profiles and assigned to the coke on the metal and the coke on the support, respectively."
[2] "The coke formed on the metal is softer (containing more hydrogen) than that formed on the support."
[3] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."
[4] "A mechanism for the coke formation on the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst is proposed, and the dimerization of adsorbed C3H6 is identified to be the kinetic relevant step for coke formation on the metal."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke is classified into two types: one formed on the metal and the other on the support. The coke on the metal is softer, containing more hydrogen than that on the support. The rate of coke formation on the metal is influenced by propane pressure but not by propylene or hydrogen pressures. Conversely, the rate of coke formation on the support is affected by both propane and propylene pressures but decreases with hydrogen pressure. A kinetic mechanism for coke formation on the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst has been proposed, identifying the dimerization of adsorbed C3H6 as the key step for coke formation on the metal.

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷裂解反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有很大差异。焦炭被分为两种：一种在金属上形成，另一种在支撑体上形成。金属上的焦炭较软，氢含量高于支撑体上的焦炭。金属上的焦炭形成速率受丙烷压力影响，但不受丙烯或氢气压力的影响。相反，支撑体上的焦炭形成速率受丙烷和丙烯压力影响，但随着氢气压力的降低而减少。已经提出了PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上焦炭形成的动力学机制，确定了吸附的C3H6的二聚化为金属上焦炭形成的关键步骤。
