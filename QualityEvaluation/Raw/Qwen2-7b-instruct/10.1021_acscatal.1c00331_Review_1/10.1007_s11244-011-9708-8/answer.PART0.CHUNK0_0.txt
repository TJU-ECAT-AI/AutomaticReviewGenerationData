[1] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is found dependent on the propane pressure (Fig. 9). The apparent reaction order is about 1.7 with respect to propane and zero reaction order with respect to hydrogen and propylene."
[2] "Coke formation on the metal has aliphatic hydrocarbon characteristic, containing more hydrogen than that formed on the support."
[3] "The rate of coke formation on the support increases with the propylene or propane pressures, while it decreases with the hydrogen pressure."
[4] "A portion of the precursor migrates to the acid site and is involved in the coke formation on the support."
[5] "The propylene in the gas phase can also adsorb on the support and form coke through reactions such as polymerization/oligomerization, condensation, and so on."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques like thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), infrared spectroscopy (IR), Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. For instance, the coke formed on the metal surface has an aliphatic hydrocarbon characteristic with a higher hydrogen content compared to the coke formed on the support. The rate of coke formation on the metal surface is influenced primarily by the propane pressure, showing an apparent reaction order of 1.7 with respect to propane. Meanwhile, the rate of coke formation on the support surface increases with the propylene or propane pressures but decreases with the hydrogen pressure. The coke precursor formed on the metal can migrate to the support, undergoing further polymerization, condensation, cyclization, and hydride transfer, contributing to the formation of hard coke on the support. Propylene in the gas phase can also contribute to coke formation on the support through various chemical reactions such as polymerization, condensation, and cyclization.

在催化系统的不同反应条件和催化剂类型下，焦炭沉积物的组成存在显著差异。热重分析（TGA）、红外光谱（IR）、拉曼光谱和元素分析等技术被用来揭示这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性。例如，金属表面形成的焦炭具有脂肪族碳氢化合物特性，并且氢含量高于在支撑体上形成的焦炭。金属表面焦炭形成速率主要受丙烷压力影响，显示出与丙烷相对应的约1.7级反应速率。另一方面，支撑体表面焦炭形成速率随丙烯或丙烷压力增加而增加，但随氢气压力降低而减少。金属表面形成的焦炭前体可以迁移到支撑体上，进一步经历聚合、缩合、环化和氢转移等反应，从而在支撑体上形成硬焦炭。气体相中的丙烯也可以通过聚合、缩合和环化等多种化学反应贡献到支撑体上的焦炭形成。
