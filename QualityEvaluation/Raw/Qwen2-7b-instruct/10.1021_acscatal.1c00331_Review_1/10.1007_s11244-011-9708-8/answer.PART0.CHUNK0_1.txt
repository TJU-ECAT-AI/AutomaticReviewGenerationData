[1] "Two kinds of coke are identified from the TPO profiles and assigned to the coke on the metal and the coke on the support, respectively."
[2] "Coke formed on the metal is softer (containing more hydrogen) than that formed on the support."
[3] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."
[4] "A mechanism for the coke formation on the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst is proposed, and the dimerization of adsorbed C3H6 is identified to be the kinetic relevant step for coke formation on the metal."
[5] "Coke formed on the support has an aromatic characteristic."

1. Two types of coke are identified on coked PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, one on the metal and the other on the support, differing in their chemical properties and deposition patterns.

2. Coke on the metal is softer, indicating a higher hydrogen content compared to the coke on the support.

3. The rate of coke formation on the metal is influenced by propane pressure but not significantly by propylene or hydrogen pressures. Conversely, the rate on the support is influenced by both propylene and propane pressures but decreases with hydrogen pressure.

4. A mechanism for coke formation on the catalyst is proposed, highlighting the dimerization of adsorbed C3H6 as the key step in coke formation on the metal surface.

5. Coke formed on the support exhibits an aromatic characteristic, suggesting a different chemical nature compared to the coke on the metal.

1. 在PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上，识别出两种焦炭沉积物，分别位于金属和支撑物上，它们在化学性质和沉积模式上有差异。

2. 金属上的焦炭较软，氢含量更高，相比支撑物上的焦炭。

3. 金属表面上的焦炭形成速率主要受丙烷压力影响，而与丙烯或氢气压力关系不大。相反，支撑物上的焦炭形成速率受丙烯和丙烷压力影响，但随氢气压力降低。

4. 提出了催化剂上焦炭形成的机制，指出吸附的C3H6的二聚化是金属表面焦炭形成的关键步骤。

5. 支撑物上的焦炭表现出芳香性特征，表明其化学性质与金属表面的焦炭不同。
