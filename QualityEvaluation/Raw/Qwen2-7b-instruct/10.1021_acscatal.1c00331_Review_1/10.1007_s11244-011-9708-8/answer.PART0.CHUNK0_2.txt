1. Two types of coke are identified on coked PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and assigned to coke on the metal and the support, respectively. Coke formed on the metal has aliphatic hydrocarbon characteristic, containing more hydrogen than that formed on the support. Coke formed on the support has an aromatic characteristic.

2. The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure while the rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure.

3. A mechanism for coke formation has been proposed based on the kinetic analysis. The reaction between the two strong adsorbed C3H6*, which was formed by dehydrogenation of propane, was identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces.

4. In addition, the propylene in the gas phase can also adsorb on the support and form coke through reactions such as polymerization/oligomerization, condensation and so on.

1. 在PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上，识别出两种焦炭，分别归因于金属和支撑上的焦炭。在金属上形成的焦炭具有轻质烃类特性，含氢量高于在支撑上形成的焦炭。在支撑上形成的焦炭具有芳烃特性。

2. 金属上焦炭的形成速率弱依赖于丙烯和氢的压力，但随着丙烷压力的增加而增加；而支撑上焦炭的形成速率随着丙烷和丙烯压力的增加而增加，并随氢压力的降低而减少。

3. 根据动力学分析提出了一种焦炭形成机制。由丙烷脱氢产生的两个强吸附的C3H6*反应被确定为铂表面焦炭形成的关键步骤。

4. 此外，气相中的丙烯还可以吸附到支撑上，并通过聚合/寡聚、缩合等反应形成焦炭。
