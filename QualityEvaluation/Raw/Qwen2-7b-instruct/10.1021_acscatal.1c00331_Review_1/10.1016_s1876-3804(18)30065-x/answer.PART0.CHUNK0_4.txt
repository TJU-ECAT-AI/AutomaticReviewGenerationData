1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types due to the complex interactions between the catalyst, feedstock, and reaction environment. Analytical techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), gas chromatography (GC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) have been employed to elucidate the diverse nature and complexity of coke constituents in these systems. These methods help in identifying the chemical composition, structure, and bonding characteristics of coke, which can be influenced by factors like catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability, as well as the feedstock properties and reaction conditions.
