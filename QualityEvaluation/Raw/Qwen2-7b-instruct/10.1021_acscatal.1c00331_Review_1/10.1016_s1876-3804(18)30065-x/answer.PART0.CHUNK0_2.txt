1. The distribution of organic-rich shale is an important factor in evaluating shale gas. The precondition for high-production of marine shale gas is that organic-rich (TOC>2%) shale must be continuously developed. 

2. The sweet spot intervals of the WufengLongmaxi Formation have high organic content, organic matter dominated by algae and acritarchs with hydrogen-rich lipid structures, providing a good foundation for fracturing due to their high porosity.

3. Nanometer-scale pores found in the organic matter of shale provide the theoretical basis for understanding the integrated source and storage characteristics of organic-rich shale.

4. In structurally complex areas, the pressure coefficient of the gas reservoir is an important parameter in evaluating favorable zones and targets of shale gas. High production zones typically have a pressure coefficient higher than 1.2.

5. Fracability assessment is crucial for high production in shale gas reservoirs. These tight reservoirs require massive fracturing to produce commercial gas flow.

1. 石油页岩分布是评价页岩气的关键因素。页岩气高产的前提条件是有机质含量大于2%的页岩要连续发育。

2. 沪涪长页岩层带的甜点层段具有高有机质含量，主要由藻类和微化石组成的有机质，富含氢基脂质结构，提供良好的基础，因其高孔隙度有利于页岩气的富集。

3. 在纳米尺度测试技术的发展下，对储层岩石的研究更加深入和细致，发现大量纳米级孔隙存在于页岩的有机质中，为理解有机质丰富页岩的综合源储特征提供了理论依据。

4. 在地质构造复杂地区，气藏的压力系数是评价有利区块和目标的重要参数。高产区块通常具有压力系数高于1.2的特点。

5. 预裂性评估对于页岩气的高产至关重要。这些致密的页岩层需要大规模压裂以实现商业性的气体产出。
