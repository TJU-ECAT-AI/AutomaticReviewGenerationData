[1] "Through the practices of exploration and development, Chinese researchers[10,1622] proposed two-element enrich-ment rule for marine shale gas in regions with complex structures, and enrichment models of structure type sweet spot and continuous type sweet spot."
[2] "Compared with other thin-layers, the No.  to No. thin layers of the sweet spot intervals of the WufengLong- maxi Formation have the following characteristics (Fig. 1)."
[3] "The sweet spot intervals, No.  to No.  thin layers of high quality shale have high organic content, organic matter dominated by algae and acritarchs with hydrogen-rich lipid structures characterized by high hydrocarbon potential and good gas-bearing property."
[4] "The organic pores are largely concentrated in solid bitumen and hydrogen-rich lipid organic matter."
[5] "In the process of thermal evolution, the shale experienced oil generation of organic matter, cracking of oil to gas, gas generation by kerogen directly and cracking of bitu- men to gas."
[6] "In the Jiaoshiba area, the lower member of the WufengLongmaxi Formation can be divided into - nine thin layers, and the nine thin layers are grouped into two gas-bearing intervals, the lower interval composed of - and the upper interval composed of - ."
[7] "The successful exploration and development of shale gas are dependent on the collaborative research across different disci- plines, integrated geological-engineering-economic evaluation and integrated implementation of exploration and develop- ment engineering."
[8] "Through ten years of endeavor, shale gas industry in China has gained a solid start. Scaled commercial development of the WufengLongmaxi Formation above the depth of 3 500 m in the Sichuan Basin has been achieved."
