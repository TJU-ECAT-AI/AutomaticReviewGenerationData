The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst type. The coke can form on both the metal sites and the surface of the catalyst support. A significant portion of coke is typically found on the metal sites, contributing to the deactivation of the catalyst. However, characterizing this coke is challenging due to the presence of substantial amounts on the catalyst support surface. This study reported the unique nature of coke on the alloyed Pt sites, identifying several C3 species as carbonaceous deposits on the surface of the PtSn alloy. The formation pathways of these coke species were also investigated through DFT calculations. Notably, these coke deposits can be hydrogenated to propylene during the PDH process, offering insights into enhancing propylene yield and catalyst stability.

在催化系统的组成，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成根据反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。焦炭可以在金属位点和催化剂支撑表面形成。大量焦炭通常位于金属位点上，导致催化剂失活。然而，由于催化剂支撑表面存在大量的焦炭，因此很难对这种焦炭进行定性分析。本研究报告了合金Pt位点上的焦炭的独特性质，在PtSn合金表面上识别出几种C3物种作为碳沉积物。这些焦炭形成路径也通过DFT计算进行了调查。值得注意的是，这些焦炭沉积物可以在PDH过程中被氢化为丙烯，为提高丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性提供了理论指导。
