According to the previous studies, coke could be produced on the metal site and surface of catalyst support, respectively.[7] Furthermore, only a small part of coke was located on the metal, which was usually believed to be responsible for deactivation.
However, qualification on this kind of coke was rather difficult because large amounts of coke were present on the surface of catalyst support, disturbing the analysis. Herein, we reported a distinct nature of coke on the alloyed Pt sites. Several C3 spe- cies were identified as carbonaceous deposits on surface of PtSn alloy. In addition, several pathways for their production were investigated by DFT calculation as well. Further, these coke could be hydrogenated to propylene in PDH process. This finding can provide a theoretical guidance for enhancing pro- pylene yield and catalyst stability in PDH process.

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Specifically, coke can form on both the metal sites and the surface of the catalyst support. However, studies have shown that only a minor portion of the coke resides on the metal, often attributed to the catalyst's deactivation. The complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems are challenging to analyze due to the substantial amount of coke on the catalyst support's surface. A recent study has characterized the unique nature of coke on alloyed Pt sites, identifying several C3 species as carbonaceous deposits on the surface of a PtSn alloy. Additionally, various pathways for coke production have been explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Importantly, this coke can be hydrogenated to propylene in the PDH process, offering theoretical insights for enhancing propylene yield and catalyst stability in PDH processes.

催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下存在显著差异。具体而言，焦炭可以在催化剂活性中心和支撑体表面形成。然而，研究表明，焦炭仅在金属表面上形成一小部分，通常被认为是催化剂失活的原因。由于催化剂支撑表面上大量存在的焦炭，分析其复杂性质和多样性变得困难。最近的一项研究报道了合金化Pt位点上焦炭的独特性质，在PtSn合金表面识别出几种C3物种作为碳质沉积物。此外，通过密度泛函理论（DFT）计算探索了焦炭的生产途径。重要的是，这种焦炭可以在PDH过程中被氢化为丙烯，为提高PDH过程中的丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性提供了理论指导。
