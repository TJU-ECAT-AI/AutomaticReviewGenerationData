1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies based on the reaction conditions and catalyst type. Specifically, coke can form on both the metal sites and the surface of the catalyst support. However, a smaller portion of coke is typically found on the metal, and it is often considered responsible for catalyst deactivation. The research also identified several C3 species as carbonaceous deposits on the surface of the PtSn alloy. Additionally, multiple pathways for the production of these coke species were explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These findings suggest that the coke produced in PDH processes can be hydrogenated to propylene.

1. 催化剂系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成根据反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。具体来说，焦炭可以在催化剂支持物的金属位点和表面形成。然而，焦炭的一部分通常位于金属上，并且常被认为是导致催化剂失活的原因。研究还识别了几种C3物种作为PtSn合金表面的碳质沉积物。此外，通过密度泛函理论（DFT）计算探索了这些焦炭生产途径的多种方式。这些发现表明，在PDH过程中产生的焦炭可以氢化为丙烯。
