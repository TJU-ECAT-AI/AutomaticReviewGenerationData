The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly. Coke forms on both the metal sites and surfaces of catalyst supports. A smaller portion of coke is typically found on the metals, often considered to contribute to deactivation. Analyzing the exact nature of coke is challenging due to its extensive presence on catalyst support surfaces. However, the study highlights the unique nature of coke on alloyed Pt sites. Carbonaceous deposits in the form of C3 species were identified on the surface of PtSn alloys. The production pathways of these coke deposits were also explored through DFT calculations. Importantly, these coke deposits can be hydrogenated to propylene during the PDH process, offering insights into enhancing propylene yield and catalyst stability.

催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成变化显著。焦炭在催化剂支撑体的金属位点和表面形成。金属上焦炭的较小部分通常被认为是导致失活的原因。由于大量焦炭存在于催化剂支撑表面上，分析其精确性质较为困难。然而，研究报道了合金化Pt位点上的焦炭的独特性质。在PtSn合金表面识别到了碳质沉积物的C3物种。这些焦炭沉积物的产生途径也通过DFT计算进行了探索。重要的是，这些焦炭沉积物可以在PDH过程中被氢化为丙烯，为提高丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性提供了理论指导。
