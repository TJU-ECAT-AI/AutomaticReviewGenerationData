[1] "According to the previous studies, coke could be produced on the metal site and surface of catalyst support, respectively."
[2] "Furthermore, only a small part of coke was located on the metal, which was usually believed to be responsible for deactivation."
[3] "However, qualification on this kind of coke was rather difficult because large amounts of coke were present on the surface of catalyst support, disturbing the analysis."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Studies have indicated that coke can form on both the metal sites and the surface of the catalyst support. However, a significant portion of coke tends to accumulate on the surface of the catalyst support, complicating its characterization. The researchers in this study reported a unique nature of coke on the alloyed Pt sites, identifying several C3 species as carbonaceous deposits on the surface of the PtSn alloy. They also explored various pathways for the production of these coke species through computational methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, these coke deposits are capable of being converted to propylene during the PDH process, providing a theoretical basis for enhancing propylene yield and improving catalyst stability in PDH reactions.

在催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随着不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。研究表明，焦炭可以在金属位点和催化剂支撑表面形成。然而，大量焦炭倾向于积聚在催化剂支撑表面上，这使对其的定性分析变得困难。该研究的作者报告了合金Pt位点上焦炭的独特性质，在PtSn合金表面识别了几种C3物种作为碳质沉积物。他们还通过计算方法，如密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，探讨了这些焦炭物种的产生途径。此外，这些焦炭沉积物在PDH过程中可以被氢化为丙烯，为提高丙烯产率和PDH反应中催化剂稳定性提供了理论指导。
