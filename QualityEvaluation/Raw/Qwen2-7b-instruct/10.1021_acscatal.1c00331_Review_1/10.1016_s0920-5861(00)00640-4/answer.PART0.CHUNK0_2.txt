"Catalysis Today 66 (2001) 427436 A kinetic rate expression for the time-dependent coke formation rate during propane dehydrogenation over a platinum alumina monolithic catalyst"
"Keywords: Kinetics; Catalyst deactivation; Platinum alumina monolithic catalyst; Coke formation rates"

"Experiments were carried out in a TGA operated under differential isothermal reactor conditions at atmospheric pressure."
"Coke formation rates have been determined as a function of time for different propylenenitrogen and propylenehydrogen gas mixtures at different temperatures on monolithic samples with platinum dispersed in the washcoat."
"A very strong influence of the reaction temperature has been observed (see Fig. 2)."
"In Fig. 3 the influence of the propylene concentration in propylenenitrogen and propylenehydrogen gas mixtures on the coke formation rates at 600C is shown."
"Furthermore, Fig. 3 also clearly shows the very strong influence of the hydrogen concentration on the coking rates."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature indicates that the coke deposits originate almost solely from propylene, with a notable exception being a small conversion of propane to propylene at the platinum surface sites. The coke formation rates are influenced by several factors including reaction temperature, propylene concentration, and hydrogen concentration. High temperatures lead to a marked abrupt decrease in the coking rates when the coke concentration reaches about 12 wt.% of the total weight of the monolith sample, independent of the reaction temperature. The coke formation rate decreases after longer times on stream, resulting in a constant residual coke growth when the coke content exceeds 12 wt.%. The literature suggests that the auto-catalytic behavior of the coke formation process for short times on stream is attributed to the formation of an intermediary product in the formation of coke precursor (CP). The proposed kinetic rate expression quantitatively describes the coke formation rates over a wide temperature range (600-800°C) and wide concentration range (at least 0-50% propylene in nitrogen or hydrogen).

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随着不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。文献表明，焦炭沉积物几乎完全来源于丙烯，但在铂表面存在少量丙烷转化为丙烯的情况。焦炭形成速率受多种因素影响，包括反应温度、丙烯浓度和氢气浓度。当焦炭浓度达到总重量的约12 wt.%时，高温下焦炭形成速率会突然大幅度下降，与反应温度无关。长时间接触后，焦炭形成速率降低，当焦炭含量超过12 wt.%时，剩余焦炭生长保持恒定。文献认为，短时间接触时焦炭形成过程的自催化行为归因于焦炭前体（CP）的形成过程中产生的中间产物。提出的动力学速率表达式能够定量描述在600-800°C的宽温度范围内以及至少0-50%丙烯在氮气或氢气中的宽浓度范围内的焦炭形成速率。
