How does the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, vary across different reaction conditions and catalyst types, and what analytical techniques have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems?

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, specifically during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study utilized a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) to determine the coke formation rates as a function of time on stream, covering a wide range of temperatures and propylene concentrations. The coke formation process was characterized using a kinetic rate expression derived from a mechanistic dual coke growth model. This model incorporates the formation of coke precursors through propylene oligomerization and subsequent growth into monolayer and multilayer coke deposits. Analytical techniques such as SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) and GC (Gas Chromatography) were employed to analyze the coke deposits' structure and composition. The study also investigated the influence of hydrogen concentration on the coke formation rates, demonstrating that hydrogen can significantly suppress the formation of coke deposits, especially at lower temperatures.
