How does the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, vary across different reaction conditions and catalyst types, and what analytical techniques have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems?

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, specifically during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study utilized a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) to determine the coke formation rates as a function of time on stream, covering a wide range of temperatures and propylene concentrations. The coke formation process was characterized using a kinetic rate expression derived from a mechanistic dual coke growth model. This model incorporates the formation of coke precursors through propylene oligomerization and subsequent growth into monolayer and multilayer coke deposits. Analytical techniques such as SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) and GC (Gas Chromatography) were employed to analyze the coke deposits' structure and composition. The study also investigated the influence of hydrogen concentration on the coke formation rates, demonstrating that hydrogen can significantly suppress the formation of coke deposits, especially at lower temperatures.

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature indicates that the coke deposits originate almost solely from propylene, with a notable exception being a small conversion of propane to propylene at the platinum surface sites. The coke formation rates are influenced by several factors including reaction temperature, propylene concentration, and hydrogen concentration. High temperatures lead to a marked abrupt decrease in the coking rates when the coke concentration reaches about 12 wt.% of the total weight of the monolith sample, independent of the reaction temperature. The coke formation rate decreases after longer times on stream, resulting in a constant residual coke growth when the coke content exceeds 12 wt.%. The literature suggests that the auto-catalytic behavior of the coke formation process for short times on stream is attributed to the formation of an intermediary product in the formation of coke precursor (CP). The proposed kinetic rate expression quantitatively describes the coke formation rates over a wide temperature range (600-800°C) and wide concentration range (at least 0-50% propylene in nitrogen or hydrogen).

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随着不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。文献表明，焦炭沉积物几乎完全来源于丙烯，但在铂表面存在少量丙烷转化为丙烯的情况。焦炭形成速率受多种因素影响，包括反应温度、丙烯浓度和氢气浓度。当焦炭浓度达到总重量的约12 wt.%时，高温下焦炭形成速率会突然大幅度下降，与反应温度无关。长时间接触后，焦炭形成速率降低，当焦炭含量超过12 wt.%时，剩余焦炭生长保持恒定。文献认为，短时间接触时焦炭形成过程的自催化行为归因于焦炭前体（CP）的形成过程中产生的中间产物。提出的动力学速率表达式能够定量描述在600-800°C的宽温度范围内以及至少0-50%丙烯在氮气或氢气中的宽浓度范围内的焦炭形成速率。

2.1. "Firstly, it has been confirmed that coke deposits during propane dehydrogenation originate almost solely from propylene."
2.2. "Furthermore, comparable coke formation rates are obtained for pure propylene on monolith samples with and without platinum dispersed in the washcoat, suggesting that most of the carbonaceous products is formed on acid sites of the -Al2O3 washcoat."
2.3. "A remarkable increase in the coke formation rates in time can be observed from the increasing slope of the coke content versus time curve, for both propylenenitrogen and propylenehydrogen gas mixtures and especially at lower propylene concentrations."
2.4. "An excellent linear regression fit is obtained from the coke content versus time squared. The apparent reaction order of the coking process with respect to the propylene concentration is strikingly high, especially for propylenehydrogen gas mixtures at relatively short times on stream at lower temperatures."
2.5. "The hydrogen concentration did not influence the residu al coking activity, as also observed by Pea et al."
2.6. "The derived kinetic rate expression provides valuable information for the design and optimisation of propane dehydrogenation reactors."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke is primarily derived from propylene, with significant formation occurring on the acidic sites of the alumina washcoat. The coke formation rate increases notably with time, especially at lower propylene concentrations, and exhibits a high apparent reaction order with respect to propylene concentration. The influence of hydrogen concentration on coke formation is minimal, except at lower temperatures where it can suppress the rate significantly. The derived kinetic rate expression offers crucial insights for optimizing propane dehydrogenation reactors.

"Clearly visible is the marked abrupt decrease in the coking rates when the coke content reaches about 12 wt.% of the total weight of the monolith sample, independent of the reaction temperature."

"In Fig. 3 the influence of the propylene concentration in propylenenitrogen and propylenehydrogen gas mixtures on the coke formation rates at 600C is shown."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke formation rates are influenced by factors such as temperature, propylene concentration, and hydrogen presence. Analytical techniques employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems include thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential isothermal reactor methods.

At specific conditions, notably when the coke content reaches about 12 wt.% of the total weight of the monolith sample, there is an abrupt decrease in the coking rates, indicating self-deactivation of the coke formation reaction. The presence of hydrogen significantly impacts the coking rates, suppressing them remarkably at lower temperatures.

The kinetic rate expression derived from a mechanistic dual coke growth model, extended to assume that the rate-determining CP formation occurs via propylene oligomerization, quantitatively describes the coke formation rates over a wide temperature range (600-800°C) and wide concentration range (at least 0-50% propylene in nitrogen or hydrogen).

This model captures the observed influence of hydrogen concentration, providing valuable information for the design and optimization of propane dehydrogenation reactors.

在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下，催化系统中的焦炭沉积物组成显著变化。丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成速率受温度、丙烷浓度和氢气存在的影响。用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分复杂性和多样性的分析技术包括热重分析（TGA）和差分等温反应方法。

在特定条件下，当焦炭含量达到总重量的约12 wt.%时，会观察到明显的焦炭形成速率突然下降，这表明焦炭形成反应自我失活。氢气的存在对焦炭形成速率有显著影响，在较低温度下可以极大抑制它们。

从基于Pea等人和Marin等人提出的复杂双焦炭生长模型的机制模型开发的动力学速率表达式，扩展为假设初始CP形成通过丙烯聚合物化进行，定量描述了在600-800°C的广泛温度范围内和至少0-50%丙烷在氮或氢气中的广泛浓度范围内的焦炭沉积速率。

该模型捕获了氢浓度的影响，并提供了设计和优化丙烷脱氢反应器的宝贵信息。
