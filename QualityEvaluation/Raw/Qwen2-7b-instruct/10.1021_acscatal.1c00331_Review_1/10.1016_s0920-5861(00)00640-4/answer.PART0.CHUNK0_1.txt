Catalysis Today 66 (2001) 427436 A kinetic rate expression for the time-dependent coke formation rate during propane dehydrogenation over a platinum alumina monolithic catalyst
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study discusses the determination of coke formation rates under propane dehydrogenation reaction conditions on a used monolithic Pt/-Al2O3 catalyst. The coke formation rates have been experimentally determined in a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) as a function of time on stream, covering wide temperature and concentration ranges.

The kinetic rate expression for the coke formation rate has been successfully described by a mechanistic dual coke growth model. 
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The kinetic rate expression for the coke formation rate has been effectively described using a mechanistic dual coke growth model. This model assumes that initially coke precursor is formed via a propylene oligomerisation process, explaining the observed auto-catalysis for short times on stream.

<quotes>
The model satisfactorily describes the remarkable initial quadratic increase in the coke formation rates versus time (auto-catalysis) with its high apparent propylene reaction order, and the decrease in coke formation rates after longer times on stream (auto-deactivation), with a constant residual coke formation rate when the coke content exceeds 12 wt.%.
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The model accurately portrays the notable initial quadratic rise in the coke formation rates against time (self-catalysis) with its high apparent propylene reaction order, and the decline in coke formation rates after prolonged periods on stream (self-deactivation), maintaining a constant residual coke formation rate once the coke content surpasses 12 wt.%
