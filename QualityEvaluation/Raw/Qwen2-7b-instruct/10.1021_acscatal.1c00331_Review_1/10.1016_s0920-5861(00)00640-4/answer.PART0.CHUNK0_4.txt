"Catalysis Today 66 (2001) 427436 A kinetic rate expression for the time-dependent coke formation rate during propane dehydrogenation over a platinum alumina monolithic catalyst"

"Experiments were carried out in a TGA operated under differential isothermal reactor conditions at atmospheric pressure."

"Clearly visible is the marked abrupt decrease in the coking rates when the coke content reaches about 12 wt.% of the total weight of the monolith sample, independent of the reaction temperature."

"In Fig. 3 the influence of the propylene concentration in propylenenitrogen and propylenehydrogen gas mixtures on the coke formation rates at 600C is shown."

"However, the derived kinetic rate expression provides valuable information for the design and optimisation of propane dehydrogenation reactors."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke formation rates are influenced by factors such as temperature, propylene concentration, and hydrogen presence. Analytical techniques employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems include thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential isothermal reactor methods.

At specific conditions, notably when the coke content reaches about 12 wt.% of the total weight of the monolith sample, there is an abrupt decrease in the coking rates, indicating self-deactivation of the coke formation reaction. The presence of hydrogen significantly impacts the coking rates, suppressing them remarkably at lower temperatures.

The kinetic rate expression derived from a mechanistic dual coke growth model, extended to assume that the rate-determining CP formation occurs via propylene oligomerization, quantitatively describes the coke formation rates over a wide temperature range (600-800°C) and wide concentration range (at least 0-50% propylene in nitrogen or hydrogen).

This model captures the observed influence of hydrogen concentration, providing valuable information for the design and optimization of propane dehydrogenation reactors.

在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下，催化系统中的焦炭沉积物组成显著变化。丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成速率受温度、丙烷浓度和氢气存在的影响。用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分复杂性和多样性的分析技术包括热重分析（TGA）和差分等温反应方法。

在特定条件下，当焦炭含量达到总重量的约12 wt.%时，会观察到明显的焦炭形成速率突然下降，这表明焦炭形成反应自我失活。氢气的存在对焦炭形成速率有显著影响，在较低温度下可以极大抑制它们。

从基于Pea等人和Marin等人提出的复杂双焦炭生长模型的机制模型开发的动力学速率表达式，扩展为假设初始CP形成通过丙烯聚合物化进行，定量描述了在600-800°C的广泛温度范围内和至少0-50%丙烷在氮或氢气中的广泛浓度范围内的焦炭沉积速率。

该模型捕获了氢浓度的影响，并提供了设计和优化丙烷脱氢反应器的宝贵信息。
