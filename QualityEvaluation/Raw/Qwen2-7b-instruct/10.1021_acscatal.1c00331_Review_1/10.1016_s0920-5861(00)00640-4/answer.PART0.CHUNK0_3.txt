2.1. "Firstly, it has been confirmed that coke deposits during propane dehydrogenation originate almost solely from propylene."
2.2. "Furthermore, comparable coke formation rates are obtained for pure propylene on monolith samples with and without platinum dispersed in the washcoat, suggesting that most of the carbonaceous products is formed on acid sites of the -Al2O3 washcoat."
2.3. "A remarkable increase in the coke formation rates in time can be observed from the increasing slope of the coke content versus time curve, for both propylenenitrogen and propylenehydrogen gas mixtures and especially at lower propylene concentrations."
2.4. "An excellent linear regression fit is obtained from the coke content versus time squared. The apparent reaction order of the coking process with respect to the propylene concentration is strikingly high, especially for propylenehydrogen gas mixtures at relatively short times on stream at lower temperatures."
2.5. "The hydrogen concentration did not influence the residu al coking activity, as also observed by Pea et al."
2.6. "The derived kinetic rate expression provides valuable information for the design and optimisation of propane dehydrogenation reactors."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke is primarily derived from propylene, with significant formation occurring on the acidic sites of the alumina washcoat. The coke formation rate increases notably with time, especially at lower propylene concentrations, and exhibits a high apparent reaction order with respect to propylene concentration. The influence of hydrogen concentration on coke formation is minimal, except at lower temperatures where it can suppress the rate significantly. The derived kinetic rate expression offers crucial insights for optimizing propane dehydrogenation reactors.

在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下，催化系统中焦炭沉积物的组成在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中显著变化。焦炭主要来源于丙烯，大量形成在氧化铝洗涂层上的酸性位点上。焦炭生成速率随时间明显增加，特别是在较低丙烯浓度下，对丙烯浓度的反应序数特别高。氢浓度对焦炭生成的影响较小，但在较低温度下，它能显著抑制速率。推导出的动力学速率表达式为设计和优化丙烷脱氢反应器提供了关键信息。
