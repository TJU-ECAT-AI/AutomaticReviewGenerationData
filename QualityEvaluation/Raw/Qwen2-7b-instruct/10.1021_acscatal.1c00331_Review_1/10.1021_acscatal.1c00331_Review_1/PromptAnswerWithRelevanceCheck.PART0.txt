2.1. Composition, Distribution, and Consequence of Coke Deposition
"The exact constituents of coke are not well resolved because of the complex process of the coke formation. Most studies broadly attributed coke as the deposition of undesirable organic compounds."
"The proportion of each kind of coke and species under their reaction condition were given, and the aliphatic cokes take up the larger part of coke deposition, with the ratio of C/H around 1.5."
"A recent study with gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis pin down the detailed components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts. It was suggested that the coke mainly consists of three kind of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite."
"The coke distribution is all over the catalysts, including both active metal and inert support."
"One of most direct observations of coke influence is that the catalyst becomes black after the reaction."
2.2. Kinetics of Coke Formation
"Kinetics has an obvious importance in understanding the coke formation process."
"Several kinetic models of coke formation have been proposed. was given by Voorhies."
"Although model A and B could fit some experimental data well, little progress has been achieved with regard to understanding the coke formation in detail."

How does the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, vary across different reaction conditions and catalyst types, and what analytical techniques have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems?

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, especially in PDH reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Studies suggest that coke is primarily composed of undesirable organic compounds, with aliphatics taking up a larger part of the deposit, characterized by a C/H ratio of approximately 1.5. Recent analyses employing gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) techniques have provided detailed insights into the components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts, identifying it as consisting of aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite species. The distribution of coke is widespread throughout the catalyst, encompassing both active metals and inert supports. A direct impact of coke formation on catalyst performance is evident, as observed by the catalyst's color change after reactions. Kinetic modeling of coke formation has been attempted, but these models have yet to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the process, indicating the complexity and diversity of coke in catalytic systems.

催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭沉积物的组成如何随不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化，以及哪些分析技术被用来揭示这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性？

焦炭沉积物在催化系统中的组成，在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下存在显著差异。研究表明，焦炭主要是由不希望存在的有机化合物构成的，其中脂肪族化合物占据了较大的沉积部分，其C/H比约为1.5。最近，通过结合使用气相色谱与质谱（GC-MS）和热重分析（TG）技术对PDH上PtSn催化剂的焦炭成分进行了深入分析，发现焦炭主要由脂肪族、芳香族和预石墨三种类型组成。焦炭在整个催化剂中的分布广泛，包括活性金属和惰性支撑体。催化剂颜色的变化直接反映了焦炭形成的影响。对于焦炭形成过程的动态建模已经尝试过，但这些模型尚未实现对过程的全面理解，这表明催化系统中焦炭的复杂性和多样性。

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Recent studies employing gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis have identified the main components of coke as aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite. Aliphatic cokes constitute the larger part of the deposit, with a C/H ratio around 1.5. The type of coke deposited varies on different catalysts, ranging from atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 to C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3. The distribution of coke is widespread across the catalyst, affecting both the active metal and the inert support. A key indicator of coke deposition is the catalyst turning black after the reaction.

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Studies suggest that coke is primarily composed of aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite species. The proportion of each species depends on the reaction conditions and the catalyst used. Aliphatic cokes typically constitute the majority of coke deposition, with a C/H ratio around 1.5. The distribution of coke is widespread throughout the catalyst, affecting both the active metal and the inert support. The presence of coke can lead to catalyst deactivation, although in some cases, the support can accommodate more coke without significantly affecting the catalyst's activity.

1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Studies have shown that coke is primarily composed of aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite species. The exact proportions under various conditions are influenced by the reaction environment and catalyst characteristics, indicating that there is no universally defined composition of coke. The distribution of coke is widespread across the catalyst, encompassing both active metals and inert supports.

2. Analytical techniques such as gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG) have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems. These methods allow for a detailed characterization of coke components, revealing that aliphatic compounds constitute the majority of coke deposition, with a C/H ratio approximately 1.5. The composition of coke can vary significantly on different catalysts, highlighting the impact of reaction conditions and catalyst types on coke formation.

3. The monolayer-multilayer coke growth model (MMCGM) provides deeper insights into the process of coke formation in PDH reactions. This model categorizes coke into monolayer and multilayer forms, with the monolayer quickly covering active sites and deactivating the catalyst. Its formation rate is linked to the number of free active sites, while the multilayer coke begins to grow as soon as the monolayer forms, with its formation rate dependent on the amount of monolayer coke. This model simulates the deactivation of PDH in pore structure catalysts and suggests that the rate of coke deposition is proportional to the available sites for coke formation.

1. 催化剂系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下会有所变化。研究表明，焦炭主要由饱和烃、芳香烃和预石墨三种成分组成。在不同条件下的具体比例受到反应环境和催化剂特性的影响，表明焦炭没有普遍定义的组成。焦炭的分布广泛，遍布整个催化剂，包括活性金属和惰性支撑。

2. 如气相色谱与质谱联用（GC-MS）和热重分析（TG）等分析技术被用于揭示PDH系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性。这些方法允许对焦炭成分进行详细表征，显示饱和化合物构成了焦炭沉积的主要部分，C/H比约为1.5。焦炭的组成在不同催化剂上可以显著不同，这强调了反应条件和催化剂类型对焦炭形成的影响。

3. 一层多层焦炭生长模型（MMCGM）提供了PDH反应中焦炭形成过程的更深入见解。该模型将焦炭分为单层和多层两种形式，单层迅速覆盖活性位点并使催化剂失效，其形成速率与自由活性位点的数量有关。多层焦炭在单层形成后立即开始生长，其形成速率依赖于单层焦炭的数量。该模型模拟了具有孔结构催化剂的PDH去活，并表明焦炭沉积速率与可用于形成焦炭的活性位点成正比。

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Studies have identified coke as primarily consisting of three types of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite. The exact composition of coke remains debated, but it is believed that the precursors of coke originate from deep dehydrogenation. Analytical techniques such as gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. The distribution of coke is widespread throughout the catalyst, affecting both the active metal and the inert support. Coke formation is influenced by factors such as the reaction condition, catalyst type, and the presence of reactants, products, and intermediates. Advanced kinetic models, like the monolayer-multilayer coke growth model (MMCGM), have been developed to better describe the process of coke formation, incorporating insights into the detailed pathways involved.
