2.1. Composition, Distribution, and Consequence of Coke Deposition
"The exact constituents of coke are not well resolved because of the complex process of the coke formation."
"A recent study with gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis pin down the detailed components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts. It was suggested that the coke mainly consists of three kind of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite."
"The proportion of each kind of coke and species under their reaction condition were given, and the aliphatic cokes take up the larger part of coke deposition, with the ratio of C/H around 1.5."
"A coke hydrogenation study indicated that the species of coke deposition vary on different catalysts."
"It is suggested that the species could be atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, respectively."
"The coke distribution is all over the catalysts, including both active metal and inert support."
"One of most direct observations of coke influence is that the catalyst becomes black after the reaction."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Recent studies employing gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis have identified the main components of coke as aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite. Aliphatic cokes constitute the larger part of the deposit, with a C/H ratio around 1.5. The type of coke deposited varies on different catalysts, ranging from atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 to C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3. The distribution of coke is widespread across the catalyst, affecting both the active metal and the inert support. A key indicator of coke deposition is the catalyst turning black after the reaction.

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成因不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而异。最近的研究采用气相色谱法结合质谱法（GC-MS）和热重分析（TG）技术确定了焦炭的主要成分包括烷烃、芳香烃和预石墨。烷烃焦炭构成沉积物的大部，其C/H比约为1.5。在不同催化剂上沉积的焦炭类型各异，包括Pt/Al2O3上的原子碳或芳香烃以及PtSn/Al2O3上的C3物种。焦炭的分布遍及整个催化剂，影响活性金属和惰性支撑体。催化剂变黑是焦炭沉积的关键指标。
