[1] "Most studies broadly attributed coke as the deposition of undesirable organic compounds."
[2] "It was suggested that the coke mainly consists of three kind of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite."
[3] "The proportion of each kind of coke and species under their reaction condition were given, and the aliphatic cokes take up the larger part of coke deposition, with the ratio of C/H around 1.5."
[4] "Overall, the composition of cokes varies with reaction condition and catalytic system without a universal definition."
[5] "The coke distribution is all over the catalysts, including both active metal and inert support."
[6] "The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis (22,41,42) revealed that there are two peaks when coke elimination happens."
[7] "Although more coke is yielded, the activity is not affected because the support accommodates most cokes."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Studies suggest that coke is primarily composed of aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite species. The proportion of each species depends on the reaction conditions and the catalyst used. Aliphatic cokes typically constitute the majority of coke deposition, with a C/H ratio around 1.5. The distribution of coke is widespread throughout the catalyst, affecting both the active metal and the inert support. The presence of coke can lead to catalyst deactivation, although in some cases, the support can accommodate more coke without significantly affecting the catalyst's activity.

在催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下存在差异。研究表明，焦炭主要由饱和烃、芳香烃和预石墨化物等成分组成。每种成分的比例取决于反应条件和所用催化剂。饱和烃类焦炭通常构成焦炭沉积的主要部分，其C/H比约为1.5。焦炭的分布广泛覆盖催化剂的各个部分，影响活性金属和惰性支撑体。焦炭的存在可能导致催化剂失活，但在某些情况下，支撑体可以容纳更多焦炭而不会显著影响催化剂的活性。
