[1] "Most studies broadly attributed coke as the deposition of undesirable organic compounds."
[2] "A recent study with gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis pin down the detailed components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts."
[3] "It was suggested that the coke mainly consists of three kind of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite."
[4] "The proportion of each kind of coke and species under their reaction condition were given, and the aliphatic cokes take up the larger part of coke deposition, with the ratio of C/H around 1.5."
[5] "However, a coke hydrogenation study indicated that the species of coke deposition vary on different catalysts."
[6] "Overall, the composition of cokes varies with reaction condition and catalytic system without a universal definition."
[7] "The coke distribution is all over the catalysts, including both active metal and inert support."
[8] "One peak is around 325 C, which is related to the coke on metal, and contains more hydrogens."
[9] "The other one is at higher temperature around 425 C, which is ascribed to the coke on the support."
[10] "Moreover, the coke on the support can be further categorized into two types: one is easy to remove, and the other one, mainly graphitic coke, is more resistant."
[11] "Although more coke is yielded, the activity is not affected because the support accommodates most cokes."
[12] "The initial coke formation quickly covers the active sites."
[13] "Then, the occupation of available sites significantly reduced the rates of coke formation after initial stage."
[14] "A more sophisticated model called monolayer-multilayer coke growth model (MMCGM) was raised by Nam et al., which delivers deeper insight in describing the process of coke formation."
[15] "In those studies, the coke has been divided into two types: the monolayer coke and the multilayer coke."
[16] "The monolayer coke quickly covers the active sites and deactivates the catalyst, and its formation rate is related to the number of free active sites."
[17] "In addition, the multilayer coke began to grow as soon as the monolayer coke formed, and the rate of multilayer coke formation is related to the amount of monolayer."
[18] "This model was used to simulate the deactivation of PDH in pore structure catalysts recently."
[19] "Moreover, the individual site poisoning model was developed for coke formation, which indicates that the rate of coke deposition is proportional to the available sites for coke formation."

1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Studies have shown that coke is primarily composed of aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite species. The exact proportions under various conditions are influenced by the reaction environment and catalyst characteristics, indicating that there is no universally defined composition of coke. The distribution of coke is widespread across the catalyst, encompassing both active metals and inert supports.

2. Analytical techniques such as gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG) have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems. These methods allow for a detailed characterization of coke components, revealing that aliphatic compounds constitute the majority of coke deposition, with a C/H ratio approximately 1.5. The composition of coke can vary significantly on different catalysts, highlighting the impact of reaction conditions and catalyst types on coke formation.

3. The monolayer-multilayer coke growth model (MMCGM) provides deeper insights into the process of coke formation in PDH reactions. This model categorizes coke into monolayer and multilayer forms, with the monolayer quickly covering active sites and deactivating the catalyst. Its formation rate is linked to the number of free active sites, while the multilayer coke begins to grow as soon as the monolayer forms, with its formation rate dependent on the amount of monolayer coke. This model simulates the deactivation of PDH in pore structure catalysts and suggests that the rate of coke deposition is proportional to the available sites for coke formation.

1. 催化剂系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下会有所变化。研究表明，焦炭主要由饱和烃、芳香烃和预石墨三种成分组成。在不同条件下的具体比例受到反应环境和催化剂特性的影响，表明焦炭没有普遍定义的组成。焦炭的分布广泛，遍布整个催化剂，包括活性金属和惰性支撑。

2. 如气相色谱与质谱联用（GC-MS）和热重分析（TG）等分析技术被用于揭示PDH系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性。这些方法允许对焦炭成分进行详细表征，显示饱和化合物构成了焦炭沉积的主要部分，C/H比约为1.5。焦炭的组成在不同催化剂上可以显著不同，这强调了反应条件和催化剂类型对焦炭形成的影响。

3. 一层多层焦炭生长模型（MMCGM）提供了PDH反应中焦炭形成过程的更深入见解。该模型将焦炭分为单层和多层两种形式，单层迅速覆盖活性位点并使催化剂失效，其形成速率与自由活性位点的数量有关。多层焦炭在单层形成后立即开始生长，其形成速率依赖于单层焦炭的数量。该模型模拟了具有孔结构催化剂的PDH去活，并表明焦炭沉积速率与可用于形成焦炭的活性位点成正比。
