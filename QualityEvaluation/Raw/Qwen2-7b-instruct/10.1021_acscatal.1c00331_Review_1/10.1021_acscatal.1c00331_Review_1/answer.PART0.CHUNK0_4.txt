[1] "Most studies broadly attributed coke as the deposition of undesirable organic compounds."
[2] "A recent study with gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis pin down the detailed components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts. It was suggested that the coke mainly consists of three kind of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite."
[3] "Overall, the composition of cokes varies with reaction condition and catalytic system without a universal definition."
[4] "The coke distribution is all over the catalysts, including both active metal and inert support."
[5] "One of most direct observations of coke influence is that the catalyst becomes black after the reaction."
[6] "Although the exact composition of coke is still under debate, the precursors of coke are most likely to be from the deep dehydrogenation."
[7] "A more sophisticated model called monolayer-multilayer coke growth model (MMCGM) was raised by Nam et al., which delivers deeper insight in describing the process of coke formation."
[8] "Models A and B only discussed the relationship between the coke concentration and time."
[9] "However, MMCGM divides the coke into two types. The influences of different kind of cokes are explicitly included in the expression."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Studies have identified coke as primarily consisting of three types of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite. The exact composition of coke remains debated, but it is believed that the precursors of coke originate from deep dehydrogenation. Analytical techniques such as gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. The distribution of coke is widespread throughout the catalyst, affecting both the active metal and the inert support. Coke formation is influenced by factors such as the reaction condition, catalyst type, and the presence of reactants, products, and intermediates. Advanced kinetic models, like the monolayer-multilayer coke growth model (MMCGM), have been developed to better describe the process of coke formation, incorporating insights into the detailed pathways involved.

催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭沉积物的组成，在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下存在差异。研究发现焦炭主要由三种类型：直链化合物、芳香族化合物和预石墨化物组成。焦炭的确切组成仍在争论中，但普遍认为其前体来源于深度脱氢。通过气相色谱与质谱联用（GC-MS）和热重分析（TG）等技术，已经揭示了这些系统中焦炭构成的复杂性和多样性。焦炭的分布广泛存在于催化剂中，影响着活性金属和惰性支撑材料。焦炭形成受到反应条件、催化剂类型以及反应物、产物和中间体等因素的影响。高级动力学模型，如单层-多层焦炭生长模型（MMCGM），已被开发用于更好地描述焦炭形成过程，包括对焦炭形成详细途径的洞察。
