2.1. Composition, Distribution, and Consequence of Coke Deposition
"The exact constituents of coke are not well resolved because of the complex process of the coke formation. Most studies broadly attributed coke as the deposition of undesirable organic compounds."
"The proportion of each kind of coke and species under their reaction condition were given, and the aliphatic cokes take up the larger part of coke deposition, with the ratio of C/H around 1.5."
"A recent study with gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis pin down the detailed components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts. It was suggested that the coke mainly consists of three kind of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite."
"The coke distribution is all over the catalysts, including both active metal and inert support."
"One of most direct observations of coke influence is that the catalyst becomes black after the reaction."
2.2. Kinetics of Coke Formation
"Kinetics has an obvious importance in understanding the coke formation process."
"Several kinetic models of coke formation have been proposed. was given by Voorhies."
"Although model A and B could fit some experimental data well, little progress has been achieved with regard to understanding the coke formation in detail."

How does the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, vary across different reaction conditions and catalyst types, and what analytical techniques have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems?

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, especially in PDH reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Studies suggest that coke is primarily composed of undesirable organic compounds, with aliphatics taking up a larger part of the deposit, characterized by a C/H ratio of approximately 1.5. Recent analyses employing gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) techniques have provided detailed insights into the components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts, identifying it as consisting of aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite species. The distribution of coke is widespread throughout the catalyst, encompassing both active metals and inert supports. A direct impact of coke formation on catalyst performance is evident, as observed by the catalyst's color change after reactions. Kinetic modeling of coke formation has been attempted, but these models have yet to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the process, indicating the complexity and diversity of coke in catalytic systems.

催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭沉积物的组成如何随不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化，以及哪些分析技术被用来揭示这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性？

焦炭沉积物在催化系统中的组成，在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下存在显著差异。研究表明，焦炭主要是由不希望存在的有机化合物构成的，其中脂肪族化合物占据了较大的沉积部分，其C/H比约为1.5。最近，通过结合使用气相色谱与质谱（GC-MS）和热重分析（TG）技术对PDH上PtSn催化剂的焦炭成分进行了深入分析，发现焦炭主要由脂肪族、芳香族和预石墨三种类型组成。焦炭在整个催化剂中的分布广泛，包括活性金属和惰性支撑体。催化剂颜色的变化直接反映了焦炭形成的影响。对于焦炭形成过程的动态建模已经尝试过，但这些模型尚未实现对过程的全面理解，这表明催化系统中焦炭的复杂性和多样性。
