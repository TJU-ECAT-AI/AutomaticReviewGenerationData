[1] "Gas bearing shale beds are characterized by continuous distribution in large area,lamina and bedding in widespread development, abundant nanoscale organic pores, sweet spot area (section)enrichment, thermogenic free gas as decisive factor to determine output, high output to be achieved by control of natural fracture density and over pressure development degree and development of artificial shale reservoir as horizontal well fracturing network, which are considered as 7 basic characteristics."

[2] "There are many wells drilled down to the depth of more than 3500 m in some blocks, but the test results therein are poor."

[3] "In case that the single well is USD 4 million in investment cost and (EUR) 1.06 108 m3 in ultimate recoverable reserves, it is estimated that its internal rate of return is 9.1%."

1. Gas bearing shale beds exhibit seven fundamental characteristics: continuous large-scale distribution, widespread lamina and bedding, abundant nanoscale organic pores, enrichment of sweet spot areas, thermogenic free gas as the determining factor for output, achieving high output through control of natural fracture density and over-pressure development degree, and the development of an artificial shale reservoir as a horizontal well fracturing network.

2. There are instances where drilling wells beyond 3500 meters in depth has yielded unsatisfactory test results.

3. Considering a single well investment cost of USD 4 million and ultimate recoverable reserves of 1.06 x 10^8 m3, the estimated internal rate of return is calculated to be 9.1%.
