[1] "The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems varies significantly depending on the specific reaction conditions and the type of catalyst used. Different conditions and catalyst types can lead to the formation of diverse coke components."
[2] "Analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) have been employed to investigate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems."
