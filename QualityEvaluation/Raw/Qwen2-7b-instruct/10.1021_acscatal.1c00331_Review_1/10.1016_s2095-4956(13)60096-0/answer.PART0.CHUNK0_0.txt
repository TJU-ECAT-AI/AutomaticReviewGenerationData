<p>Propylene is the building block for many important petro- chemicals such as polypropylene and acrylonitrile. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is much sought as a complementary supply to the conventional processes such as steam cracking or FCC units to satisfy the growing demand [1]:</p>
<p>C3H8 → C3H6 + H2 DH0 = 124 kJ/mol (1)</p>
<p>The reaction is reversible, endothermic and accompanied by volume expansion.</p>
<p>Commercially, chromia and platinum-based catalysts are used for dehydrogenation of light alkanes [25]. Platinum exhibits a good activity in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, but the olefin yield is poor because the platinum particles catalyze CC bond rupture as well. Platinum-based catalysts are often promoted with tin and alkali metals (mostly potassium) to increase the selectivity and lifetime. Incorporation of tin into platinum-based catalysts has a positive effect on the selectivity toward dehydrogenation, at the expense of the hydrogenolysis reactions [68]. The acidity of the support is suppressed by the addition of an alkaline metal [7,8].</p>
<p>Due to thermodynamic limitations, dehydrogenation of light alkanes is operated at temperatures around 600 C to achieve reasonable commercial yields. Under these conditions, catalyst deactivation is rapid and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary [9].</p>
<p>The UOP Oleflex process [12], for example, employs Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst in 3 to 4 adiabatic moving-bed reactors in series. Hydrogen is used as the diluent and the catalyst is continuously regenerated by coke burning followed by Pt redispersion.</p>
<p>Consequently, despite the simple chemistry, dehydrogenation processes are very complicated. The availability of reliable kinetic models for the reactions and catalyst deactivation are, therefore, essential.</p>

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. These variations are influenced by factors such as temperature, feedstock composition, and catalyst properties. Analytical techniques employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems typically include:

1. Gas Chromatography (GC): This technique allows for the identification and quantification of individual components in the coke deposit. By analyzing the gas products separated on a GC column, researchers can determine the specific hydrocarbons and other compounds that make up the coke.

2. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC): HPLC is used to separate and identify organic molecules present in the coke deposit. This is particularly useful for detecting smaller, more volatile compounds that may contribute to the overall coke composition.

3. Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS): Py-GC/MS combines pyrolysis, which heats the coke deposit to release its constituent compounds, with GC and MS to analyze the released gases. This technique is highly sensitive and allows for detailed characterization of the coke components, including their molecular structure and composition.

4. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA): TGA is used to determine the weight loss of the coke deposit as it is heated, providing information on the thermal stability of the coke and the amount of organic material it contains. This can help in understanding the type of reactions occurring during the dehydrogenation process and how these reactions affect the catalyst.

5. Elemental Analysis: This involves determining the elemental composition of the coke deposit, such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen content. This information helps in assessing the chemical makeup of the coke and its potential reactivity.

6. Microscopy Techniques: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) are used to visualize the morphology and structure of the coke deposit. These techniques can provide insights into the physical properties of the coke, such as its size distribution, surface area, and porosity.

By combining these analytical techniques, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the diverse and complex nature of coke deposits in PDH reactions, which is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance, improving process efficiency, and reducing environmental impacts.
