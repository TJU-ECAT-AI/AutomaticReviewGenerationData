The study indicates that the propane dehydrogenation reaction and catalyst deactivation over Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst are not limited by external and internal mass transfer limitations. This suggests that the employed kinetics, derived from the power-law rate expression for the surface reaction and the independent law for deactivation kinetics, can be considered intrinsic. The absence of mass transfer limitations ensures that the kinetic parameters obtained are not influenced by transport phenomena, supporting the intrinsic nature of the kinetic model.

研究表明，丙烷脱氢反应和Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂上的催化剂失活不受外部和内部质量传递限制的影响。这表明所采用的动力学模型，基于表面反应动力学的幂律速率表达式和催化剂失活独立动力学的幂律表达式，可以被认为是内在的。缺乏质量传递限制确保了获得的动力学参数不受传输现象的影响，支持动力学模型的内在性质。
