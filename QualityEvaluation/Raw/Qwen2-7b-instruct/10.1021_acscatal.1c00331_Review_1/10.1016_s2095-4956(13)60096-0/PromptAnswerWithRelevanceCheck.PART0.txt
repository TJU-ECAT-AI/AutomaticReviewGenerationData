<p>Propylene is the building block for many important petro- chemicals such as polypropylene and acrylonitrile. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is much sought as a complementary supply to the conventional processes such as steam cracking or FCC units to satisfy the growing demand [1]:</p>
<p>C3H8 → C3H6 + H2 DH0 = 124 kJ/mol (1)</p>
<p>The reaction is reversible, endothermic and accompanied by volume expansion.</p>
<p>Commercially, chromia and platinum-based catalysts are used for dehydrogenation of light alkanes [25]. Platinum exhibits a good activity in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, but the olefin yield is poor because the platinum particles catalyze CC bond rupture as well. Platinum-based catalysts are often promoted with tin and alkali metals (mostly potassium) to increase the selectivity and lifetime. Incorporation of tin into platinum-based catalysts has a positive effect on the selectivity toward dehydrogenation, at the expense of the hydrogenolysis reactions [68]. The acidity of the support is suppressed by the addition of an alkaline metal [7,8].</p>
<p>Due to thermodynamic limitations, dehydrogenation of light alkanes is operated at temperatures around 600 C to achieve reasonable commercial yields. Under these conditions, catalyst deactivation is rapid and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary [9].</p>
<p>The UOP Oleflex process [12], for example, employs Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst in 3 to 4 adiabatic moving-bed reactors in series. Hydrogen is used as the diluent and the catalyst is continuously regenerated by coke burning followed by Pt redispersion.</p>
<p>Consequently, despite the simple chemistry, dehydrogenation processes are very complicated. The availability of reliable kinetic models for the reactions and catalyst deactivation are, therefore, essential.</p>

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. These variations are influenced by factors such as temperature, feedstock composition, and catalyst properties. Analytical techniques employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems typically include:

1. Gas Chromatography (GC): This technique allows for the identification and quantification of individual components in the coke deposit. By analyzing the gas products separated on a GC column, researchers can determine the specific hydrocarbons and other compounds that make up the coke.

2. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC): HPLC is used to separate and identify organic molecules present in the coke deposit. This is particularly useful for detecting smaller, more volatile compounds that may contribute to the overall coke composition.

3. Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS): Py-GC/MS combines pyrolysis, which heats the coke deposit to release its constituent compounds, with GC and MS to analyze the released gases. This technique is highly sensitive and allows for detailed characterization of the coke components, including their molecular structure and composition.

4. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA): TGA is used to determine the weight loss of the coke deposit as it is heated, providing information on the thermal stability of the coke and the amount of organic material it contains. This can help in understanding the type of reactions occurring during the dehydrogenation process and how these reactions affect the catalyst.

5. Elemental Analysis: This involves determining the elemental composition of the coke deposit, such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen content. This information helps in assessing the chemical makeup of the coke and its potential reactivity.

6. Microscopy Techniques: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) are used to visualize the morphology and structure of the coke deposit. These techniques can provide insights into the physical properties of the coke, such as its size distribution, surface area, and porosity.

By combining these analytical techniques, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the diverse and complex nature of coke deposits in PDH reactions, which is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance, improving process efficiency, and reducing environmental impacts.

在催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下变化显著。这些变化受到温度、原料组分和催化剂性质等因素的影响。用于阐明这些系统中焦炭构成复杂性和多样性的分析技术通常包括：

1. 气相色谱法（GC）：通过在GC柱上分离气体产物，此技术允许对焦炭沉积物中的单个成分进行识别和定量。研究人员可以通过分析分离出的气体来确定构成焦炭的特定烃类和其他化合物。

2. 高性能液相色谱法（HPLC）：HPLC用于分离并识别焦炭沉积物中存在的有机分子。对于检测可能构成焦炭的较小且更挥发性化合物特别有用。

3. 热裂解-气相色谱-质谱法（Py-GC/MS）：将热裂解与GC和MS结合使用，该技术首先加热焦炭沉积物以释放其组成化合物，然后分析释放的气体。此技术高度敏感，并允许详细分析焦炭成分，包括它们的分子结构和组成。

4. 热重分析（TGA）：TGA用于确定焦炭沉积物在加热时的质量损失，提供有关焦炭的热稳定性和所含有机材料的信息。这有助于理解在脱氢过程中发生的反应类型以及这些反应如何影响催化剂。

5. 元素分析：此技术涉及确定焦炭沉积物的元素组成，例如碳、氢、氧、硫和氮含量。这些信息有助于评估焦炭的化学组成及其潜在活性。

6. 显微镜技术：扫描电子显微镜（SEM）和透射电子显微镜（TEM）用于可视化焦炭沉积物的形态和结构。这些技术可以提供关于焦炭物理性质的见解，如尺寸分布、表面面积和孔隙度。

通过结合上述分析技术，研究人员可以全面了解PDH反应中焦炭沉积物的复杂性和多样性，这对于优化催化剂性能、提高过程效率和减少环境影响至关重要。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study indicates that the propane dehydrogenation reaction and catalyst deactivation over Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst are not limited by external and internal mass transfer limitations. This suggests that the employed kinetics, derived from the power-law rate expression for the surface reaction and the independent law for deactivation kinetics, can be considered intrinsic. The absence of mass transfer limitations ensures that the kinetic parameters obtained are not influenced by transport phenomena, supporting the intrinsic nature of the kinetic model.

2. Coke deposits in PDH reactions are complex and diverse. Analytical techniques like TGA, XRD, and FTIR have been used to characterize the coke constituents. The composition varies depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. Platinum catalysts, while effective, tend to promote additional reactions like CC bond rupture, leading to coke formation. Promoting the catalyst with tin increases dehydrogenation selectivity but may negatively impact hydrogenolysis reactions. The support material's acidity is reduced with the addition of an alkaline metal.
