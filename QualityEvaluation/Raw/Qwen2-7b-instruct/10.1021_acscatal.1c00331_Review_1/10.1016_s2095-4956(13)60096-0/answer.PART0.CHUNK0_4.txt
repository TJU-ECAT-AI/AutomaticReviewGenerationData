The kinetic models used for propane dehydrogenation and catalyst deactivation over Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst are considered intrinsic. The power-law rate expression for the surface reaction kinetics and independent law for deactivation kinetics provide fair fits for both differential and integral methods of analysis. The analysis indicates that the reaction is not limited by external and internal mass transfer limitations, suggesting that the obtained kinetic models are intrinsic to the process.

用于丙烷脱氢和Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂失活的动力学模型被认为是内在的。表面反应动力学的幂律表达式和独立衰减定律对于两种分析方法（差分法和积分法）都提供了良好的拟合。分析表明，该反应不受外部和内部质量传输限制的影响，这表明获得的动力学模型是过程的内在特性。
