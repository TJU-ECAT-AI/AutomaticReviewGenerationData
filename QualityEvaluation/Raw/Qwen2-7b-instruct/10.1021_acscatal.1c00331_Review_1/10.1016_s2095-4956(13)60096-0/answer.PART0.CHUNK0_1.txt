This study investigated the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation and catalyst deactivation over a Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. Performance tests were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor using propane and hydrogen as the feed under atmospheric pressure. A novel differential method of analysis was introduced and compared to the integral method. The research also assessed the impact of mass transfer limitations and concluded that the kinetic models and parameters could be considered intrinsic, not influenced by external or internal mass transfer limitations.

本研究对Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂上的丙烷脱氢和催化剂失活的动力学进行了考察。在常压下，使用丙烷和氢气作为流体，在固定床反应器中进行了性能测试。引入了一种基于积分反应器数据差分分析的新方法，并与积分分析方法进行了比较。研究还评估了传质限制的影响，并得出结论，动力学模型及其参数可以被认为是内在的，不受外部或内部传质限制的影响。
