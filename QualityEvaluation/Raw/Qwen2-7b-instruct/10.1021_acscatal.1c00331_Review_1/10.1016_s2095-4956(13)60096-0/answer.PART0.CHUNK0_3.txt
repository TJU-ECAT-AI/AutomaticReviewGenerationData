<p>Propylene is the building block for many important petro- chemicals such as polypropylene and acrylonitrile. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is much sought as a complementary supply to the conventional processes such as steam cracking or FCC units to satisfy the growing demand [1]:</p>

<p>The reaction is reversible, endothermic and accompanied by volume expansion. Therefore, higher temperatures and lower pressures shift it to completion. Higher temperatures,on the other hand, promote side reactions, coke formation and catalyst deactivation.</p>

1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems varies with different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Higher temperatures lead to more coke formation and catalyst deactivation due to side reactions. Coke constituents are elucidated through analytical techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).

<p>Commercially, chromia and platinum-based catalysts are used for dehydrogenation of light alkanes [25]. Platinum exhibits a good activity in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, but the olefin yield is poor because the platinum particles catalyze CC bond rupture as well. Platinum-based catalysts are often promoted with tin and alkali metals (mostly potassium) to increase the selectivity and lifetime. Incorporation of tin into platinum-based catalysts has a positive effect on the selectiv- ity toward dehydrogenation, at the expense of the hydrogenol- ysis reactions [68]. The acidity of the support is suppressed by the addition of an alkaline metal [7,8].</p>

2. Coke deposits in PDH reactions are complex and diverse. Analytical techniques like TGA, XRD, and FTIR have been used to characterize the coke constituents. The composition varies depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. Platinum catalysts, while effective, tend to promote additional reactions like CC bond rupture, leading to coke formation. Promoting the catalyst with tin increases dehydrogenation selectivity but may negatively impact hydrogenolysis reactions. The support material's acidity is reduced with the addition of an alkaline metal.

2. PDH反应中的焦炭沉积物复杂多样。使用TGA、XRD和FTIR等分析技术来表征焦炭成分。焦炭成分取决于反应条件和催化剂类型。铂催化剂虽然有效，但倾向于促进如CC键断裂等额外反应，导致焦炭生成。通过添加碱性金属促进催化剂使用时，提高了脱氢选择性，但可能对氢解反应产生负面影响。支持材料的酸性通过添加碱性金属得到抑制。
