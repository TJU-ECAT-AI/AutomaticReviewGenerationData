[1] "The influence of the coke on the reaction(s) causing catalyst deactivation is then naturally dealt with in terms of the real variables and the elementary steps."
[2] "Presently this is still done in an empirical way by multiplying the rate of the main reaction(s) by a deactivation function which is often related to time, tO =fit) (1) where e.g. j'( t) = e -at"
[3] "However, measurement of coke content is no longer a problem; adequate equipment has been developed that permits the simultaneous study of the main reaction(s) and coke formation, namely an electrobalance with or without recycle of the products and the TEOM [Beirnaert et al, 1994; Chen et al, 1996]."
[4] "Any progress in understanding the effects of coke on the rates of the reactions beyond the empirical level of the type of equation (2) requires more information on the structure of the coke and of the catalyst."
[5] "In the steam reforming sequence (2) - (9), leading to CO, the rate determining step is (8), in the sequence (2) - (7), leading to CO2 it is step (7), in the water gas shift step (10). In the coking sequence (2) - (3) - (4) - (12) - (13) the rate determining step is the first H-abstraction, (3)."
[6] "Clearly, applying this "molecular" approach to the cracking of a complex mixture like vacuum gas oil is an impossible task: the number of parameters would be overwhelming."
[7] "Indeed, even in a homologous series of n-paraffins each molecule reacts at a different rate; the rate coefficient for the disappearance of the molecule increases with chain length."
[8] "In dual-function catalysis species formed on one type of site have to move to the other before the next step of the reaction sequence can take place."
[9] "Singh and Froment [1997] recently developed a probabilistic model for the deactivation of a dual function catalyst by coke formation accounting for reaction and surface migration."

1. The influence of coke on catalyst deactivation is considered through real variables and elementary steps.
2. Empirical methods are used to calculate the deactivation function, often relating to time.
3. Adequate equipment allows for the simultaneous study of main reactions and coke formation.
4. More information about coke and catalyst structure is needed for deeper understanding of coke effects on reactions.
5. In steam reforming, the rate-determining steps vary across different sequences.
6. Applying a molecular approach to complex mixtures like vacuum gas oil is practically unfeasible due to the overwhelming number of parameters.
7. In a homologous series of n-paraffins, each molecule reacts at a different rate, with the rate coefficient increasing with chain length.
8. In dual-function catalysis, species formed on one type of site must migrate to another before proceeding.
9. Singh and Froment developed a probabilistic model for dual function catalyst deactivation by coke, considering reactions and surface migration.
