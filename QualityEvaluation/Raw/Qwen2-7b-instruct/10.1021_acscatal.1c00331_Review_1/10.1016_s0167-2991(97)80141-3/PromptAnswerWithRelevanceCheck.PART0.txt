[1] "In spite of its far reaching industrial implications catalyst deactivation by coke formation has been studied with insufficient depth and rigor."
[2] "Presently this is still done in an empirical way by multiplying the rate of the main reaction(s) by a deactivation function which is often related to time,tO =fit) (1) where e.g. j'( t) = e -at although it would be preferable to relate it to the true deactivating agent, coke itself :tp =f(Cc) (2) where e.g. f(Cc) = e -ace An exponential function of the coke content has been derived for a variety of processes [De Pauw & Froment, 1975; Dumez & Froment, 1976; Hatcher, 1985; Beirnaert et al, 1994]."
[3] "However, measurement of coke content is no longer a problem; adequate equipment has been developed that permits the simultaneous study of the main reaction(s) and coke formation, namely an electrobalance with or without recycle of the products and the TEOM [Beirnaert et al, 1994; Chen et al, 1996]."
[4] "This approach cannot predict the coke profile in a reactor, although the knowledge of this profile in an industrial reactor is of key importance for the operation of the catalyst regeneration."
[5] "The shortcomings of the approach symbolized by (1) have been extensively discussed [Froment, 1976]. Briefly, if coke is not measured, the deactivation of the coking reaction itself can not be accounted for, so that (1) is really a very biased equation."
[6] "Any progress in understanding the effects of coke on the rates of the reactions beyond the empirical level of the type of equation (2) requires more information on the structure of the coke and of the catalyst."
[7] "Clearly the rate equation for the cracking of methane, i.e. for the coke formation is not fundamentally different from that of one of the main reactions (12). What remains to be done is to link the coke content of the catalyst to the rate of the main reactions."
[8] "The latter is only observed when the Ni is encapsulated by coke growing on coke, but the modeling of this aspect remains to be developed."
[9] "In their study of the catalytic cracking of n-hexane on a US-Y-zeolite in an electrobalance with recycle Beimaert et al, [1994] derived an empirical deactivation function of the type (2) for the various reactions, but with different o-values, as illustrated in Table 2 for the isomerizations."
[10] "Indeed, even in a homologous series of n-paraffins each molecule reacts at a different rate; the rate coefficient for the disappearance of the molecule increases with chain length."

1. Catalyst deactivation by coke formation has received insufficient attention and rigorous study in its industrial implications. The current method of relating the rate of main reactions to a deactivation function that is often tied to time (e.g., e^-at) is empirical and biased, as it doesn't accurately account for the true deactivating agent, coke. This approach can't predict the coke profile in a reactor, crucial for catalyst regeneration operations.

2. Empirical deactivation functions for coke formation have been derived using exponential functions of the coke content for various processes. Adequate equipment has been developed for simultaneous study of main reactions and coke formation, facilitating more precise measurements.

3. The lack of coke content measurement limits the ability to account for the deactivation of the coking reaction itself, resulting in a biased equation. Understanding the structure of coke and catalyst is essential for progress in modeling its effects on reaction rates beyond empirical methods.

4. Linking coke content to the rate of main reactions is necessary for predicting coke formation in catalytic systems, especially in complex industrial processes like steam reforming. This is crucial for catalyst performance optimization and regeneration.

5. In catalytic cracking processes, the modeling of coke formation on the nickel surface and its interactions with the catalyst structure remains a challenge. The growth of coke encapsulating the nickel can lead to deactivation, but this aspect needs further development.

6. Beirnaert et al. (1994) found that empirical deactivation functions could be derived for various reactions in catalytic cracking, but with differing values of 'o' for each reaction, as illustrated in Table 2 for isomerizations of n-hexane. This highlights the complexity of coke formation and its impact on reaction rates.

7. In homologous series of n-paraffins, each molecule exhibits a different rate of reaction, with the rate coefficient for the disappearance of the molecule increasing with chain length. This complexity underscores the challenges in modeling coke formation in heterogeneous catalytic systems.

1. 在其工业影响方面，焦炭形成导致催化剂失活的研究没有得到足够的关注和严谨性。当前将主要反应速率与仅与时间（例如，e^-at）相关的失活函数的方法是经验性的，并且存在偏见，因为它不能准确地反映真正的失活剂，即焦炭。这种方法无法预测反应器中的焦炭分布，这对于催化剂再生操作至关重要。

2. 已经为各种过程开发了使用焦炭含量的指数函数形式的焦炭形成失活函数。已经开发出了能够同时研究主要反应和焦炭形成的适当设备，从而可以更精确地测量焦炭含量。

3. 如果不测量焦炭含量，就不能准确地计算出焦炭生成反应本身的失活，这导致了一个非常有偏见的方程。理解焦炭和催化剂的结构对于在超越经验水平上理解焦炭对反应速率的影响是必要的进展。

4. 将焦炭含量与主要反应速率相关联是预测催化系统中焦炭生成的关键，特别是在蒸汽重整等复杂工业过程中。这对于催化剂性能优化和再生至关重要。

5. 在催化裂解过程中，镍表面的焦炭生成及其与催化剂结构的相互作用的建模仍然是一个挑战。当焦炭包围镍时，会导致失活，但这个方面需要进一步的发展。

6. Beirnaert等人（1994年）发现，可以通过表2中n-己烷异构化反应的不同'o'值来推导出催化裂解过程中各种反应的实验失活函数。这突显了焦炭形成及其对反应速率影响的复杂性。

7. 在同系列的n烷烃中，每个分子表现出不同的反应速率，消失的分子率随着碳链长度的增加而增加。这种复杂性强调了在异质催化系统中建模焦炭形成所面临的挑战。

To address the question regarding the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, under varying conditions and with different catalyst types, the document does not provide specific details. The text focuses on the theoretical modeling of coke formation and its impact on catalyst deactivation, emphasizing the use of kinetic formulations to understand the interactions between hydrocarbons, catalytic sites, and coke formation. It discusses the empirical approaches to modeling coke formation, the limitations of these methods, and the need for a deeper understanding of the structure of coke and catalysts to improve modeling accuracy. The document also highlights the complexity of chemical processes in petroleum refining and the challenges in modeling coke formation in complex mixtures like vacuum gas oil. It mentions the superiority of the single event approach in dealing with complex mixtures due to its independence from chain length, which allows for a more manageable number of parameters compared to the molecular approach. 

The document further discusses the probabilistic approach to modeling coke formation and its impact on pore blockage and deactivation functions. It refers to studies that apply percolation theory and Monte Carlo simulations to understand coke formation and deactivation in zeolites and catalyst particles. The text also touches upon the evolution of the effective rate profile of the main reaction in reactors with diffusion limitations, indicating the importance of coke content in affecting the reaction rate over time.

However, the document does not provide specific analytical techniques employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems. To address this question, one would need access to more specialized research or experimental data focused specifically on PDH reactions, detailing the methodologies used to characterize coke deposits under different conditions and catalyst types.

The lack of direct information on analytical techniques in the document suggests that the question may require additional resources or literature specific to PDH reactions for a comprehensive answer.

关于催化系统中焦炭沉积物在不同反应条件和催化剂类型下的组成变化，以及如何使用分析技术来阐明这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性的问题，文献并未提供具体细节。文本着重于焦炭形成及其对催化剂失活的理论建模，强调了理解烃类、催化位点与焦炭形成之间相互作用所需的动力学公式的重要性。它讨论了焦炭形成的经验方法，这些方法的局限性，以及更深入地了解焦炭和催化剂结构以提高建模准确性的必要性。文献还提到了石油精炼过程中遇到的化学过程的复杂性以及在处理如减压气体油这类复杂混合物时建模焦炭形成所面临的挑战。

文献进一步讨论了预测焦炭形成及其对孔堵塞和失活函数影响的概率方法。它引用了应用渗滤理论和蒙特卡洛模拟来理解焦炭形成和催化剂颗粒中脱活的文献研究。文本还提到了反应速率在反应器内随时间变化的情况，指出焦炭含量对反应速率的影响。

然而，文献并未提供用于阐明PDH反应中焦炭构成复杂性和多样性的特定分析技术的详细信息。为了回答这个问题，可能需要访问专门针对PDH反应的研究或实验数据，这些数据详细描述了在不同条件和催化剂类型下使用的方法来表征焦炭沉积物。

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, can vary significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques used to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems include the use of electrobalances with or without recycle of the products and the Total Elemental Organic Measurement (TEOM) technique. These methods allow for the simultaneous study of both the main reaction(s) and coke formation. The effect of coke can extend beyond merely covering sites, potentially growing to sizes that block pores within the catalyst. In the case of methane cracking, the rate equation for coke formation is not fundamentally distinct from those of the main reactions. The pore size distribution and connectivity within the catalyst can also influence the extent of coke formation and its impact on the system. The complexity of analyzing coke formation in complex mixtures, such as vacuum gas oil, poses significant challenges due to the overwhelming number of parameters involved. However, the single event approach offers a superior method for dealing with such complexities, especially when considering mixtures. The butene dehydrogenation data from Dumez and Froment [1976] was analyzed using this approach by Matin et al [1986]. The presence of coke can alter the diffusing paths of molecules, making the effective diffusivity dependent on the probability of pore blockage.

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成会因不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而显著变化。用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性的分析技术包括使用电平衡器（带或不带产品循环）以及总元素有机测量（TEOM）方法。这些方法允许同时研究主反应和焦炭形成。焦炭的影响不仅限于覆盖位点，它可能会生长到足以堵塞催化剂中的孔隙的大小。在甲烷裂解的情况下，焦炭形成的速率方程与主要反应基本相同。催化剂的孔径分布及其互连性也会影响焦炭形成的程度及其对系统的整体影响。在复杂混合物如减压渣油中分析焦炭形成构成了重大挑战，这主要是由于涉及的参数数量过于庞大。然而，单一事件方法为处理此类复杂性提供了更优的方法，尤其是在考虑混合物时。Matin等人通过应用这种方法对Dumez和Froment [1976]的丁烯脱氢数据进行了分析。焦炭的存在可以改变分子的扩散路径，使得有效扩散性依赖于孔隙堵塞的概率。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The influence of coke on catalyst deactivation is addressed through the real variables and elementary steps of the reactions causing the deactivation. Empirical methods are used to quantify the deactivation, often relating it to time, but it would be more accurate to relate it to the actual deactivating agent, coke.

2. The deactivation function typically relates the rate of the main reactions to the coke content of the catalyst, using an exponential function. Various studies have derived such functions for different processes.

3. The empirical method of relating deactivation to time is biased because it does not account for the deactivation caused by the coking reaction itself when the coke content is not measured.

4. The rate of coke formation correlates with the irreversible fractional site coverage, rs, through the equation rc = eCtMcr = dC, assuming no multilayer growth of the coke.

5. Coke formation on Ni/alumina catalysts involves specific aspects such as whisker formation, which complicates the application of the rate equation due to the inaccessibility of coke adsorbed on the Ni surface.

6. Beirnaert et al. (1994) derived empirical deactivation functions for various isomerizations in the catalytic cracking of n-hexane on a US-Y-zeolite, with different o-values for each reaction.
