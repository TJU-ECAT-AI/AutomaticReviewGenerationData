[1] "The influence of the coke on the reaction(s) causing catalyst deactivation is then naturally dealt with in terms of the real variables and the elementary steps."
[2] "Presently this is still done in an empirical way by multiplying the rate of the main reaction(s) by a deactivation function which is often related to time, \( tO = fit) \) (1) where e.g. \( j'( t) = e^{-at} \) although it would be preferable to relate it to the true deactivating agent, coke itself :\( tp =f(Cc) \) (2) where e.g. \( f(Cc) = e^{-ace} \)"
[3] "The shortcomings of the approach symbolized by (1) have been extensively discussed [Froment, 1976]. Briefly, if coke is not measured, the deactivation of the coking reaction itself can not be accounted for, so that (1) is really a very biased equation."
[4] "Any progress in understanding the effects of coke on the rates of the reactions beyond the empirical level of the type of equation (2) requires more information on the structure of the coke and of the catalyst."
[5] "The present paper aims at reviewing progress in the modeling of coke formation and catalyst deactivation along the lines set in Table 1, although it stresses to a large extent the kinetic formulation, an area in which considerable progress has been achieved."
[6] "Clearly the rate equation for the cracking of methane, i.e. for the coke formation is not fundamentally different from that of one of the main reactions (12)."
[7] "What remains to be done is to link the coke content of the catalyst to the rate of the main reactions."
[8] "Chemical processes encountered in petroleum refining are far more complex than steam reforming. The feedstocks are complex mixtures of hydrocarbons of various types each of which is converted along intricate pathways."
[9] "Indeed, even in a homologous series of n-paraffins each molecule reacts at a different rate; the rate coefficient for the disappearance of the molecule increases with chain length."
[10] "The only way out is to express the transformation of the molecules in terms of the elementary steps of carbenium-ion chemistry: protonation, H- and Me-shifts, protonated cyclo-propane-type isomerization, 13-scission ..."
[11] "Clearly, applying this "molecular" approach to the cracking of a complex mixture like vacuum gas oil is an impossible task: the number of parameters would be overwhelming."
[12] "The superiority of the single event approach becomes evident when mixtures have to be dealt with. The rate coefficients of the elementary steps of the carbenium ions may be assumed to be independent of the chain length, so that the number of parameters does not increase for complex mixtures, unlike what happens with the molecular approach."
[13] "The case of site coverage and coke growth was already discussed in Section 2.2. Coke can grow to a size sufficient to block even mesopores [Levinter, 1967]."
[14] "Since there is no preferential location for the coverage of a site and the subsequent blockage of the pore Beeckman & Froment [1979] used a probabilistic approach."
[15] "Also,q)A :=(PC" In the more general case when the potential rate of polymerization is of the same order of magnitude as the potential rate of site coverage, two periods have to be distinguished."
[16] "Beyne and Froment [1993] applied percolation theory and Monte Carlo simulation to deactivation in zeolites, approximated by a simple cubic lattice."
[17] "Recently Gottifredi and Froment [1997] dealt with reaction, diffusion and coke formation in a catalyst particle, mainly focusing on the derivation and application of approximate but accurate formulae for the calculation of transport fluxes and deactivation functions."
[18] "Whereas for short times the highest rate is observed at the surface, with increasing reduced time, x, an internal maximum develops, the location of which shifts towards the center of the particle."
[19] "The figure is similar to that derived by Froment and Bischoff (1961) for deactivation by coke formation in a tubular reactor without diffusional limitations inside the catalyst particles, however."
[20] "The evolution with time of the effective rate profile of the main reaction in a plug flow reactor. Parallel coking. Diffusion-limited process on a ZSM-5 type catalyst."
[21] "As shown in Fig. 11 in such a case and pure A feed the coke content increases through the reactor, thus enhancing the importance of the upstream zone."

To address the question regarding the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, under varying conditions and with different catalyst types, the document does not provide specific details. The text focuses on the theoretical modeling of coke formation and its impact on catalyst deactivation, emphasizing the use of kinetic formulations to understand the interactions between hydrocarbons, catalytic sites, and coke formation. It discusses the empirical approaches to modeling coke formation, the limitations of these methods, and the need for a deeper understanding of the structure of coke and catalysts to improve modeling accuracy. The document also highlights the complexity of chemical processes in petroleum refining and the challenges in modeling coke formation in complex mixtures like vacuum gas oil. It mentions the superiority of the single event approach in dealing with complex mixtures due to its independence from chain length, which allows for a more manageable number of parameters compared to the molecular approach. 

The document further discusses the probabilistic approach to modeling coke formation and its impact on pore blockage and deactivation functions. It refers to studies that apply percolation theory and Monte Carlo simulations to understand coke formation and deactivation in zeolites and catalyst particles. The text also touches upon the evolution of the effective rate profile of the main reaction in reactors with diffusion limitations, indicating the importance of coke content in affecting the reaction rate over time.

However, the document does not provide specific analytical techniques employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems. To address this question, one would need access to more specialized research or experimental data focused specifically on PDH reactions, detailing the methodologies used to characterize coke deposits under different conditions and catalyst types.

The lack of direct information on analytical techniques in the document suggests that the question may require additional resources or literature specific to PDH reactions for a comprehensive answer.

关于催化系统中焦炭沉积物在不同反应条件和催化剂类型下的组成变化，以及如何使用分析技术来阐明这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性的问题，文献并未提供具体细节。文本着重于焦炭形成及其对催化剂失活的理论建模，强调了理解烃类、催化位点与焦炭形成之间相互作用所需的动力学公式的重要性。它讨论了焦炭形成的经验方法，这些方法的局限性，以及更深入地了解焦炭和催化剂结构以提高建模准确性的必要性。文献还提到了石油精炼过程中遇到的化学过程的复杂性以及在处理如减压气体油这类复杂混合物时建模焦炭形成所面临的挑战。

文献进一步讨论了预测焦炭形成及其对孔堵塞和失活函数影响的概率方法。它引用了应用渗滤理论和蒙特卡洛模拟来理解焦炭形成和催化剂颗粒中脱活的文献研究。文本还提到了反应速率在反应器内随时间变化的情况，指出焦炭含量对反应速率的影响。

然而，文献并未提供用于阐明PDH反应中焦炭构成复杂性和多样性的特定分析技术的详细信息。为了回答这个问题，可能需要访问专门针对PDH反应的研究或实验数据，这些数据详细描述了在不同条件和催化剂类型下使用的方法来表征焦炭沉积物。

由于文献缺乏直接信息，可以推测该问题可能需要额外的资源或专门针对PDH反应的文献，以便获得全面的答案。
