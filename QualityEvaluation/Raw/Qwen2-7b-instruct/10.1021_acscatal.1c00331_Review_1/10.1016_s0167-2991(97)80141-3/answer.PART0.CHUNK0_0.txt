[1] "In spite of its far reaching industrial implications catalyst deactivation by coke formation has been studied with insufficient depth and rigor."
[2] "Presently this is still done in an empirical way by multiplying the rate of the main reaction(s) by a deactivation function which is often related to time,tO =fit) (1) where e.g. j'( t) = e -at although it would be preferable to relate it to the true deactivating agent, coke itself :tp =f(Cc) (2) where e.g. f(Cc) = e -ace An exponential function of the coke content has been derived for a variety of processes [De Pauw & Froment, 1975; Dumez & Froment, 1976; Hatcher, 1985; Beirnaert et al, 1994]."
[3] "However, measurement of coke content is no longer a problem; adequate equipment has been developed that permits the simultaneous study of the main reaction(s) and coke formation, namely an electrobalance with or without recycle of the products and the TEOM [Beirnaert et al, 1994; Chen et al, 1996]."
[4] "This approach cannot predict the coke profile in a reactor, although the knowledge of this profile in an industrial reactor is of key importance for the operation of the catalyst regeneration."
[5] "The shortcomings of the approach symbolized by (1) have been extensively discussed [Froment, 1976]. Briefly, if coke is not measured, the deactivation of the coking reaction itself can not be accounted for, so that (1) is really a very biased equation."
[6] "Any progress in understanding the effects of coke on the rates of the reactions beyond the empirical level of the type of equation (2) requires more information on the structure of the coke and of the catalyst."
[7] "Clearly the rate equation for the cracking of methane, i.e. for the coke formation is not fundamentally different from that of one of the main reactions (12). What remains to be done is to link the coke content of the catalyst to the rate of the main reactions."
[8] "The latter is only observed when the Ni is encapsulated by coke growing on coke, but the modeling of this aspect remains to be developed."
[9] "In their study of the catalytic cracking of n-hexane on a US-Y-zeolite in an electrobalance with recycle Beimaert et al, [1994] derived an empirical deactivation function of the type (2) for the various reactions, but with different o-values, as illustrated in Table 2 for the isomerizations."
[10] "Indeed, even in a homologous series of n-paraffins each molecule reacts at a different rate; the rate coefficient for the disappearance of the molecule increases with chain length."

1. Catalyst deactivation by coke formation has received insufficient attention and rigorous study in its industrial implications. The current method of relating the rate of main reactions to a deactivation function that is often tied to time (e.g., e^-at) is empirical and biased, as it doesn't accurately account for the true deactivating agent, coke. This approach can't predict the coke profile in a reactor, crucial for catalyst regeneration operations.

2. Empirical deactivation functions for coke formation have been derived using exponential functions of the coke content for various processes. Adequate equipment has been developed for simultaneous study of main reactions and coke formation, facilitating more precise measurements.

3. The lack of coke content measurement limits the ability to account for the deactivation of the coking reaction itself, resulting in a biased equation. Understanding the structure of coke and catalyst is essential for progress in modeling its effects on reaction rates beyond empirical methods.

4. Linking coke content to the rate of main reactions is necessary for predicting coke formation in catalytic systems, especially in complex industrial processes like steam reforming. This is crucial for catalyst performance optimization and regeneration.

5. In catalytic cracking processes, the modeling of coke formation on the nickel surface and its interactions with the catalyst structure remains a challenge. The growth of coke encapsulating the nickel can lead to deactivation, but this aspect needs further development.

6. Beirnaert et al. (1994) found that empirical deactivation functions could be derived for various reactions in catalytic cracking, but with differing values of 'o' for each reaction, as illustrated in Table 2 for isomerizations of n-hexane. This highlights the complexity of coke formation and its impact on reaction rates.

7. In homologous series of n-paraffins, each molecule exhibits a different rate of reaction, with the rate coefficient for the disappearance of the molecule increasing with chain length. This complexity underscores the challenges in modeling coke formation in heterogeneous catalytic systems.

1. 在其工业影响方面，焦炭形成导致催化剂失活的研究没有得到足够的关注和严谨性。当前将主要反应速率与仅与时间（例如，e^-at）相关的失活函数的方法是经验性的，并且存在偏见，因为它不能准确地反映真正的失活剂，即焦炭。这种方法无法预测反应器中的焦炭分布，这对于催化剂再生操作至关重要。

2. 已经为各种过程开发了使用焦炭含量的指数函数形式的焦炭形成失活函数。已经开发出了能够同时研究主要反应和焦炭形成的适当设备，从而可以更精确地测量焦炭含量。

3. 如果不测量焦炭含量，就不能准确地计算出焦炭生成反应本身的失活，这导致了一个非常有偏见的方程。理解焦炭和催化剂的结构对于在超越经验水平上理解焦炭对反应速率的影响是必要的进展。

4. 将焦炭含量与主要反应速率相关联是预测催化系统中焦炭生成的关键，特别是在蒸汽重整等复杂工业过程中。这对于催化剂性能优化和再生至关重要。

5. 在催化裂解过程中，镍表面的焦炭生成及其与催化剂结构的相互作用的建模仍然是一个挑战。当焦炭包围镍时，会导致失活，但这个方面需要进一步的发展。

6. Beirnaert等人（1994年）发现，可以通过表2中n-己烷异构化反应的不同'o'值来推导出催化裂解过程中各种反应的实验失活函数。这突显了焦炭形成及其对反应速率影响的复杂性。

7. 在同系列的n烷烃中，每个分子表现出不同的反应速率，消失的分子率随着碳链长度的增加而增加。这种复杂性强调了在异质催化系统中建模焦炭形成所面临的挑战。
