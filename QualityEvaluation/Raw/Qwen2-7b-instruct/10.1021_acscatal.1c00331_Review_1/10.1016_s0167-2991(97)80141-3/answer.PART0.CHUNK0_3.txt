[1] "The influence of the coke on the reaction(s) causing catalyst deactivation is then naturally dealt with in terms of the real variables and the elementary steps."
[2] "Presently this is still done in an empirical way by multiplying the rate of the main reaction(s) by a deactivation function which is often related to time,tO =fit) (1) where e.g. j'( t) = e -at although it would be preferable to relate it to the true deactivating agent, coke itself :tp =f(Cc) (2) where e.g. f(Cc) = e -ace An exponential function of the coke content has been derived for a variety of processes [De Pauw & Froment, 1975; Dumez & Froment, 1976; Hatcher, 1985; Beirnaert et al, 1994]."
[3] "The shortcomings of the approach symbolized by (1) have been extensively discussed [Froment, 1976]. Briefly, if coke is not measured, the deactivation of the coking reaction itself can not be accounted for, so that (1) is really a very biased equation."
[4] "The rate of coke formation is related to the rate of irreversible fractional site coverage, rs,through:rc = eCtMcr = dC (7) dt provided there is no multilayer growth of the coke."
[5] "Thereby a specific aspect of coke formation on Ni/alumina catalysts has to be accounted for, namely whisker formation. The rate equation (16) is not directly applicable because it contains the concentration of coke adsorbed on the Ni-surface, which is not accessible, just like Celia. l, CH_ 1 ...."
[6] "In their study of the catalytic cracking of n-hexane on a US-Y-zeolite in an electrobalance with recycle Beimaert et al, [1994] derived an empirical deactivation function of the type (2) for the various reactions, but with different o-values, as illustrated in Table 2 for the isomerizations."

1. The influence of coke on catalyst deactivation is addressed through the real variables and elementary steps of the reactions causing the deactivation. Empirical methods are used to quantify the deactivation, often relating it to time, but it would be more accurate to relate it to the actual deactivating agent, coke.

2. The deactivation function typically relates the rate of the main reactions to the coke content of the catalyst, using an exponential function. Various studies have derived such functions for different processes.

3. The empirical method of relating deactivation to time is biased because it does not account for the deactivation caused by the coking reaction itself when the coke content is not measured.

4. The rate of coke formation correlates with the irreversible fractional site coverage, rs, through the equation rc = eCtMcr = dC, assuming no multilayer growth of the coke.

5. Coke formation on Ni/alumina catalysts involves specific aspects such as whisker formation, which complicates the application of the rate equation due to the inaccessibility of coke adsorbed on the Ni surface.

6. Beirnaert et al. (1994) derived empirical deactivation functions for various isomerizations in the catalytic cracking of n-hexane on a US-Y-zeolite, with different o-values for each reaction.

1. 催化剂失活中的焦炭影响通过反应的真实变量和基本步骤进行处理。使用经验方法量化失活，通常与时间相关联，但更准确的是将其与实际的失活剂焦炭联系起来。

2. 失活函数通常将主要反应速率与催化剂的焦炭含量相关联，使用指数函数。各种过程的研究中已推导出此类函数。

3. 将失活与时间关联的经验方法存在偏误，因为它不考虑当未测量焦炭含量时由焦炭生成反应引起的失活。

4. 焦炭形成速率与不可逆的局部站点覆盖度rs相关，通过等式rc = eCtMcr = dC计算，假设不存在多层生长的焦炭。

5. 在Ni/氧化铝催化剂上，焦炭形成涉及特定方面，如针状物形成，这使得应用速率方程变得复杂，因为无法访问Ni表面的焦炭吸附。

6. Beirnaert等人（1994）为在US-Y沸石上催化裂解n-己烷的各种异构化过程，使用回收电平衡法推导出不同的o值的失活函数。
