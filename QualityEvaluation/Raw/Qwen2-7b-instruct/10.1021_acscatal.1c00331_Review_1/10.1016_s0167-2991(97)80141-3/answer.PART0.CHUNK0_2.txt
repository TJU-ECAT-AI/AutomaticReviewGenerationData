[1] "Catalyst deactivation has such an impact on the design and operation of plants that studies along the approach outlined here are fully justified. They should be an integrated part of the process development."
[2] "The influence of the coke on the reaction(s) causing catalyst deactivation is then naturally dealt with in terms of the real variables and the elementary steps."
[3] "Presently this is still done in an empirical way by multiplying the rate of the main reaction(s) by a deactivation function which is often related to time, tO =fit) (1) where e.g. j'( t) = e -at"
[4] "However, measurement of coke content is no longer a problem; adequate equipment has been developed that permits the simultaneous study of the main reaction(s) and coke formation, namely an electrobalance with or without recycle of the products and the TEOM [Beirnaert et al, 1994; Chen et al, 1996]."
[5] "In other words: is the effect of coke limited to the coverage of sites? Or can it grow to a size blocking the pores?"
[6] "Clearly the rate equation for the cracking of methane, i.e. for the coke formation is not fundamentally different from that of one of the main reactions (12)."
[7] "What is the pore size distribution of the catalyst? Are the pores interconnected?"
[8] "Clearly, applying this "molecular" approach to the cracking of a complex mixture like vacuum gas oil is an impossible task: the number of parameters would be overwhelming."
[9] "The superiority of the single event approach becomes evident when mixtures have to be dealt with."
[10] "The approach was applied to the butene dehydrogenation data of Dumez and Froment [1976] by Matin et al [1986]."
[11] "It also affects the path followed by the diffusing molecules that becomes more tortuous, so that the effective diffusivity has to be expressed in terms of the blockage probability."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, can vary significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques used to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems include the use of electrobalances with or without recycle of the products and the Total Elemental Organic Measurement (TEOM) technique. These methods allow for the simultaneous study of both the main reaction(s) and coke formation. The effect of coke can extend beyond merely covering sites, potentially growing to sizes that block pores within the catalyst. In the case of methane cracking, the rate equation for coke formation is not fundamentally distinct from those of the main reactions. The pore size distribution and connectivity within the catalyst can also influence the extent of coke formation and its impact on the system. The complexity of analyzing coke formation in complex mixtures, such as vacuum gas oil, poses significant challenges due to the overwhelming number of parameters involved. However, the single event approach offers a superior method for dealing with such complexities, especially when considering mixtures. The butene dehydrogenation data from Dumez and Froment [1976] was analyzed using this approach by Matin et al [1986]. The presence of coke can alter the diffusing paths of molecules, making the effective diffusivity dependent on the probability of pore blockage.

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成会因不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而显著变化。用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性的分析技术包括使用电平衡器（带或不带产品循环）以及总元素有机测量（TEOM）方法。这些方法允许同时研究主反应和焦炭形成。焦炭的影响不仅限于覆盖位点，它可能会生长到足以堵塞催化剂中的孔隙的大小。在甲烷裂解的情况下，焦炭形成的速率方程与主要反应基本相同。催化剂的孔径分布及其互连性也会影响焦炭形成的程度及其对系统的整体影响。在复杂混合物如减压渣油中分析焦炭形成构成了重大挑战，这主要是由于涉及的参数数量过于庞大。然而，单一事件方法为处理此类复杂性提供了更优的方法，尤其是在考虑混合物时。Matin等人通过应用这种方法对Dumez和Froment [1976]的丁烯脱氢数据进行了分析。焦炭的存在可以改变分子的扩散路径，使得有效扩散性依赖于孔隙堵塞的概率。
