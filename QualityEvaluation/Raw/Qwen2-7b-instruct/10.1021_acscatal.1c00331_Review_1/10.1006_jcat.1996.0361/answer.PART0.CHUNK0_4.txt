[1] "Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles."
[2] "The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of the metal."
[3] "The second peak was coke on the carrier, and the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier."
[4] "We suggested a model which proposes that the coke observed is not responsible for the deactivation but formed in parallel."
[5] "The relation between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and the major part of the coke (Coke A) is independent of gas composition, but it is dependent on the temperature."
[6] "The graphitic type of coke on the carrier is formed via a separate mechanism, independent of the deactivation of the main reaction."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly based on different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques like temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. Three distinct types of coke were identified: coke on and near the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier. The formation of these different types of coke is influenced by factors such as temperature, partial pressures of propene and propane, and the presence of hydrogen. The model suggests that the coke responsible for deactivation forms in parallel with the main coke formation, indicating that the relationship between the deactivating coke and the major part of the coke is temperature-dependent but not influenced by gas composition. Graphitic coke on the carrier is formed through a separate mechanism, unrelated to the main deactivation process.

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成根据不同的反应条件和催化剂类型变化显著。通过分析技术如温度程序氧化（TPO），揭示了这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性。在研究中发现了三种不同类型的焦炭：靠近金属的焦炭、位于载体上的焦炭以及载体上的石墨状焦炭。这些不同类型的焦炭的形成受温度、丙烯和丙烷的分压以及氢气的存在等因素的影响。模型表明，导致失活的焦炭与主要焦炭形成同时产生，并且二者之间的关系依赖于温度但不受气体组分的影响。载体上的石墨状焦炭是通过独立于主要失活过程的机制形成的。
