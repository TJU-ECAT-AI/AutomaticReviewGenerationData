[1] "Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles."
[2] "The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of the metal."
[3] "The second peak was coke on the carrier, and the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier."
[4] "We suggested a model which proposes that the coke observed is not responsible for the deactivation but formed in parallel."
[5] "The relation between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and the major part of the coke (Coke A) is independent of gas composition, but it is dependent on the temperature."
[6] "The graphitic type of coke on the carrier is formed via a separate mechanism, independent of the deactivation of the main reaction."

1. Three types of coke deposits were identified in the TPO profiles: coke on or near the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier.
2. The coke on the metal and its vicinity was associated with the deactivation of the catalyst.
3. Graphitic coke on the carrier was formed through a distinct pathway unrelated to the main deactivation process.
4. The relationship between the deactivating coke and the main coke component is unaffected by gas composition but varies with temperature.

1. 在TPO图谱中检测到了三种类型的焦炭沉积物：金属附近或附近的焦炭，载体上的焦炭，以及载体上的石墨状焦炭。
2. 金属及其附近区域的焦炭与催化剂失活相关联。
3. 载体上的石墨状焦炭是通过独立于主要失活过程的途径形成的。
4. 失活焦炭与主要焦炭成分之间的关系不受气体组成的影响，但随温度变化而变化。
