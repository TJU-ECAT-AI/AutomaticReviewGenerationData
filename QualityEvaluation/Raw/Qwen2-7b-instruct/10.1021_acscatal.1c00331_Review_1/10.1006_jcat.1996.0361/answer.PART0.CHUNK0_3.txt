[1] "Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles."
[2] "The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of the metal."
[3] "The second peak was coke on the carrier, and the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier."
[4] "We suggested a model which proposes that the coke observed is not responsible for the deactivation but formed in parallel."
[5] "The relation between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and the major part of the coke (Coke A) is independent of gas composition, but it is dependent on the temperature."
[6] "Graphitic type of coke on the carrier is formed via a separate mechanism, independent of the deactivation of the main reaction."
[7] "Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst."

1. The TPO profiles revealed three distinct types of coke deposits in catalytic systems. The first type was coke located near the metal, the second was coke on the carrier material, and the third was graphitic coke on the carrier.

2. The formation of the first two types of coke, which are on and in the vicinity of the metal, and on the carrier, increases with temperature and propene partial pressure. Hydrogen, however, inhibits their formation.

3. The amount of the third type of coke, which is graphitic on the carrier, rises with temperature and propane partial pressure. 

4. The model proposed that the coke deposits observed do not contribute to deactivation, but rather form concurrently with the main coke formation.

5. The relationship between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and the primary coke (Coke A) is not influenced by gas composition, but depends on temperature.

6. Graphitic coke on the carrier forms through a distinct pathway, separate from the main deactivation process.

7. Hydrogen helps mitigate the rate of deactivation and the formation of the main coke component by inhibiting the formation of coke precursors, but it is unable to eliminate the coke already formed on the catalyst.

1. TPO谱图中检测到了三种不同的焦炭沉积类型。第一种是靠近金属的焦炭，第二种是沉积在载体上的焦炭，第三种是在载体上形成的石墨状焦炭。

2. 在高温和丙烯分压增加的情况下，靠近金属的第一种和第二种类型的焦炭形成量增加。然而，氢气能够抑制它们的形成。

3. 第三种焦炭（在载体上形成的石墨状焦炭）的量随温度和丙烷分压的增加而增加。

4. 提出的模型表明，观察到的焦炭沉积物不是导致失活的原因，而是与主要焦炭形成同时形成。

5. 活化焦（焦炭B）与主要焦炭（焦炭A）之间的关系不受气体组成的影响，但取决于温度。

6. 载体上的石墨状焦炭的形成通过一种单独的途径发生，与主要的失活过程无关。

7. 氢气有助于降低失活速率和主要焦炭成分的形成，通过抑制焦炭前体的形成，但它无法消除已沉积在催化剂上的焦炭。
