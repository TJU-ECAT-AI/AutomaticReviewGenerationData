[1] "Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles."
[2] "The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of the metal."
[3] "The second peak was coke on the carrier, and the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier."
[4] "We suggested a model which proposes that the coke observed is not responsible for the deactivation but formed in parallel."
[5] "The relation between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and the major part of the coke (Coke A) is independent of gas composition, but it is dependent on the temperature."
[6] "The graphitic type of coke on the carrier is formed via a separate mechanism, independent of the deactivation of the main reaction."
[7] "Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst."

1. The coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, vary across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Three types of coke were identified: coke on and near the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier.

2. The coke on and in the vicinity of the metal is responsible for deactivating the catalyst. Coke on the carrier is not involved in deactivation. Graphitic coke on the carrier forms independently of the main deactivation mechanism.

3. The relation between the deactivating coke and the main part of the coke is independent of gas composition but dependent on temperature. 

4. Hydrogen affects the formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation but does not remove already formed coke.

1. 催化剂系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢反应中，焦炭沉积物在不同反应条件和催化剂类型下存在差异。识别出了三种类型的焦炭：金属附近的焦炭、载体上的焦炭以及载体上的石墨状焦炭。

2. 金属附近及附近的焦炭导致催化剂失活。载体上的焦炭不参与失活过程。载体上的石墨状焦炭形成独立于主要失活机制的过程。

3. 失活焦炭与主要焦炭之间的关系不受气体组成的影响，但依赖于温度。

4. 氢气通过抑制焦炭前体形成来影响主要焦炭的形成，但无法去除已形成的焦炭。
