[1] "Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles."
[2] "The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of the metal."
[3] "The second peak was coke on the carrier, and the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier."
[4] "We suggested a model which proposes that the coke observed is not responsible for the deactivation but formed in parallel."
[5] "The relation between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and the major part of the coke (Coke A) is independent of gas composition, but it is dependent on the temperature."
[6] "The graphitic type of coke on the carrier is formed via a separate mechanism, independent of the deactivation of the main reaction."
[7] "Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst."

1. Three types of coke were identified in the TPO profiles: coke on or near the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier.

2. The coke on the metal and its surroundings plays a role in deactivation, whereas the graphitic coke on the carrier does not.

3. The amount of coke varies depending on the reaction conditions, with more coke accumulating at higher temperatures and pressures.

4. Hydrogen effectively prevents coke formation and maintains activity, but it does not remove existing coke.

5. The formation of coke and its deactivation mechanisms are influenced by temperature, but the coke composition remains consistent regardless of gas composition.

1. 在TPO图谱中检测到了三种类型的焦炭：靠近或位于金属附近的焦炭、载体上的焦炭以及载体上的石墨状焦炭。

2. 金属及其附近区域的焦炭参与了催化剂的失活过程，而载体上的石墨状焦炭则不参与此过程。

3. 不同的反应条件会影响焦炭的积累量，温度和压力越高，焦炭积累越多。

4. 氢气能够有效地防止焦炭形成并保持活性，但无法去除已经形成的焦炭。

5. 焦炭的形成和失活机制受温度影响，但不论气体组成如何，焦炭的组成保持不变。
