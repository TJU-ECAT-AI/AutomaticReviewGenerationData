[1] "The formation of short chain hydrocarbons (cracking) and coke (coking) are the main undesired reactions associated with propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Furthermore, coke is rapidly formed at high temperatures and as a consequence the catalyst is deactivated and needs to be regenerated."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies significantly based on the reaction conditions and catalyst type. The coke formation process involves the conversion of propane to short-chain hydrocarbons and coke at high temperatures, leading to catalyst deactivation. Analytical techniques, including thermogravimetric analysis, have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. In this study, a complete kinetic model for propane dehydrogenation, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation was developed using a PtSnK/Al2O3 catalyst. The model aimed to improve propene yield and develop new catalyst deactivation models. To achieve an aged and stable catalyst, a reduction-reaction-regeneration cycle was performed six times, resulting in a catalyst with a BET surface area of 138 m2/g and a pore volume of 0.45 mL/g.

在催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成根据反应条件和催化剂类型变化显著。焦炭形成过程涉及在高温下将丙烷转化为短链烃和焦炭，导致催化剂失活。已采用热重分析等技术来阐明这些系统中焦炭组成的复杂性和多样性。在此研究中，使用了PtSnK/Al2O3催化剂开发了一个完整的动力学模型，该模型涵盖了丙烷脱氢、焦炭形成及其对催化剂失活和催化剂再生的影响。该模型旨在提高丙烯产率并开发新的催化剂失活模型。为了获得老化和稳定的催化剂，进行了六次还原-反应-再生循环，最终得到BET表面积为138 m2/g和孔体积为0.45 mL/g的催化剂。
