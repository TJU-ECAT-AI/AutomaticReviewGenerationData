1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types due to the formation of short chain hydrocarbons and coke. Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in controlling the acidity, which can contribute to the formation of coke. Coke formation experiments were performed under various conditions to understand its complex nature and diversity. These conditions included a temperature range of 460-540°C, a propane molar fraction of 0.25-0.70, a catalyst mass of 200 mg, a particle size of 160-250 mm, atmospheric pressure, and total flow rates of 300 cm3(STP) min−1.

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies significantly based on the reaction conditions and catalyst type. The coke formation process involves the conversion of propane to short-chain hydrocarbons and coke at high temperatures, leading to catalyst deactivation. Analytical techniques, including thermogravimetric analysis, have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. In this study, a complete kinetic model for propane dehydrogenation, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation was developed using a PtSnK/Al2O3 catalyst. The model aimed to improve propene yield and develop new catalyst deactivation models. To achieve an aged and stable catalyst, a reduction-reaction-regeneration cycle was performed six times, resulting in a catalyst with a BET surface area of 138 m2/g and a pore volume of 0.45 mL/g.

2.1. Catalyst preparation
The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation. The support was first impregnated with 6 wt.% of SnCl22H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 98% purity) dissolved into HNO3 (SigmaAldrich, 1N). It was then dried in air at 100 8C during 12 h and calcined in a fluidized bed reactor as follows.
The catalyst was heated (3 8C min1) to 550 8C in air and calcined for 2.5 h at this temperature in humid air. The wet air was then replaced with dry air and the catalyst was calcined for a further 2 h at 550 8C. The purpose of the wet calcination was to reduce the chlorine content of the catalyst [6].

2.2. Thermogravimetric systems
Coke formation experiments were performed in a CI Electronics thermobalance, under several different conditions. The reactor feed contained propane diluted in nitrogen. All the streams were mass flow controlled (Brooks).

A series of previous experiments was conducted varying the sample mass, particle size and flow rates in order to assure that no bed depth effect or diffusional limitations were present during the kinetic tests.
