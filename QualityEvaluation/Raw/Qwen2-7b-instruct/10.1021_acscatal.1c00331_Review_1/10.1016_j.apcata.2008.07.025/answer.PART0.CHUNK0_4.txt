2.1. Catalyst preparation
The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation. The support was first impregnated with 6 wt.% of SnCl22H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 98% purity) dissolved into HNO3 (SigmaAldrich, 1N). It was then dried in air at 100 8C during 12 h and calcined in a fluidized bed reactor as follows.
The catalyst was heated (3 8C min1) to 550 8C in air and calcined for 2.5 h at this temperature in humid air. The wet air was then replaced with dry air and the catalyst was calcined for a further 2 h at 550 8C. The purpose of the wet calcination was to reduce the chlorine content of the catalyst [6].

2.2. Thermogravimetric systems
Coke formation experiments were performed in a CI Electronics thermobalance, under several different conditions. The reactor feed contained propane diluted in nitrogen. All the streams were mass flow controlled (Brooks).

A series of previous experiments was conducted varying the sample mass, particle size and flow rates in order to assure that no bed depth effect or diffusional limitations were present during the kinetic tests.

Analytical techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in propane dehydrogenation systems. The coke deposits' composition varies based on reaction conditions and catalyst types. Factors influencing the coke's complexity include temperature, feed composition, catalyst properties, and operational parameters like flow rates and particle size. These methods allow researchers to understand how different conditions affect the coke formation and its structure within catalytic systems.
