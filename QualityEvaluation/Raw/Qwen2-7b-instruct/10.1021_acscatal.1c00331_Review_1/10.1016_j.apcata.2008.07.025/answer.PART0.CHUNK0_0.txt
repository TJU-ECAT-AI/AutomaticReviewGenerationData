The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke formation involves the formation of short chain hydrocarbons (cracking) and coke (coking). The study employs a two-zone fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR) to investigate the dehydrogenation of propane over a PtSnK/Al2O3 catalyst, aiming to improve the propene yield and develop new models of catalyst deactivation. The research focuses on understanding the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems through kinetic modeling and experimental analysis.
