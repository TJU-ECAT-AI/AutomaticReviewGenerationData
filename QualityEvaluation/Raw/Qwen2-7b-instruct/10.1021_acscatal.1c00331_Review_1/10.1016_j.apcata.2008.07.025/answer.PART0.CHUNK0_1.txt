[1] "The formation of short chain hydrocarbons (cracking) and coke (coking) are the main undesired reactions associated with propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Furthermore, coke is rapidly formed at high temperatures and as a consequence the catalyst is deactivated and needs to be regenerated."
[3] "The coke formation experiments were performed under various conditions including temperature, molar fraction of propane, catalyst mass, particle size, and total flow rates."
[4] "Analytical techniques employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems include thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), gas chromatography (GC), and elemental analysis."

1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. Coke is typically formed at high temperatures, leading to catalyst deactivation. Analytical techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis, gas chromatography, and elemental analysis have been used to study the diverse nature of coke constituents in these systems.
