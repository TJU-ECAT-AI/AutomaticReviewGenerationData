1. The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types due to the formation of short chain hydrocarbons and coke. Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in controlling the acidity, which can contribute to the formation of coke. Coke formation experiments were performed under various conditions to understand its complex nature and diversity. These conditions included a temperature range of 460-540°C, a propane molar fraction of 0.25-0.70, a catalyst mass of 200 mg, a particle size of 160-250 mm, atmospheric pressure, and total flow rates of 300 cm3(STP) min−1. No significant bed depth effects or diffusional limitations were observed during the kinetic tests.

1. 在催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随着不同的反应条件和催化剂类型的变化而变化，这主要归因于短链烃类的形成和焦炭的形成。碱金属或碱土金属有助于控制酸性，这可能促进焦炭的形成。进行了焦炭形成实验，在不同条件下研究其复杂的性质和多样性。这些条件包括温度范围为460-540°C、丙烷摩尔分数为0.25-0.70、催化剂质量为200毫克、颗粒大小为160-250微米、大气压力以及总流量为300 cm3(STP) min−1。在动力学测试过程中未观察到明显的床层深度效应或扩散限制。
