Kinetic studies show that addition of Sn to Pt enhances the selectivity for isobutylene formation at temperatures near 700 K.
Mssbauer spectroscopic studies show that Sn interacts with Pt to produce a Pt/Sn alloy.
Microcalorimetric investigations show that addition of Sn reduces the number of sites that strongly interact with hydrogen or carbon monoxide.
The elimination of stronger adsorption sites may be caused by preferential blocking of sites by tin or weakening of sites due to ligand effects.
Microcalorimetric studies of ethylene adsorption suggest that addition of Sn inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species.
These results suggest that high dehydrogenation selectivity achieved by addition of Sn to Pt is caused by a decrease in the size of surface Pt ensembles.

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies based on the addition of tin (Sn) to platinum (Pt). At temperatures near 700 K, the inclusion of Sn enhances the selectivity for isobutylene formation. Mssbauer spectroscopic studies reveal that Sn interacts with Pt to form a Pt/Sn alloy. Microcalorimetric investigations indicate that adding Sn reduces the number of sites that strongly interact with hydrogen or carbon monoxide, possibly due to preferential blocking by tin or weakening of these sites through ligand effects. Additionally, microcalorimetric studies of ethylene adsorption suggest that Sn inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species. These findings collectively suggest that high dehydrogenation selectivity achieved by adding Sn to Pt is attributed to a decrease in the size of surface Pt ensembles.

在催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成根据铂（Pt）添加锡（Sn）的变化而变化。在约700 K的温度下，Sn的添加增强了异丁烯形成的选择性。Mssbauer光谱研究显示，Sn与Pt形成Pt/Sn合金。微热容量研究表明，添加Sn减少了强烈与氢或一氧化碳相互作用的位点的数量，这可能是由于锡的优先阻挡这些位点或通过配体效应削弱这些位点造成的。此外，对乙烯吸附的微热容量研究表明，Sn抑制了表面物种的高度脱氢化形成。这些发现共同表明，通过将Sn添加到Pt中实现的高脱氢化选择性归因于表面Pt簇尺寸的减少。
