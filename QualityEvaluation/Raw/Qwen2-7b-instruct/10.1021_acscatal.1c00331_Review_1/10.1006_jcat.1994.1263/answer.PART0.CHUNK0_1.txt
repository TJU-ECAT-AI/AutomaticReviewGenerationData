Kinetic studies show that addition of Sn to Pt enhances the selectivity for isobutylene formation at temperatures near 700 K.
Mssbauer spectroscopic studies show that Sn interacts with Pt to produce a Pt/Sn alloy.
Microcalorimetric investigations show that addition of Sn reduces the number of sites that strongly interact with hydrogen or carbon monoxide.
The elimination of stronger adsorption sites may be caused by preferential blocking of sites by tin or weakening of sites due to ligand effects.
However, strong adsorption sites are present on a Pt/Sn catalyst that exhibits high dehydrogenation selectivity.
Microcalorimetric studies of ethylene adsorption suggest that addition of Sn inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species.
These results suggest that high dehydrogenation selectivity achieved by addition of Sn to Pt is caused by a decrease in the size of surface Pt ensembles.

The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts enhances the selectivity for isobutylene formation, reduces the number of strong interaction sites with hydrogen or carbon monoxide, and decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles, leading to high dehydrogenation selectivity.

添加Sn到Pt催化剂中可以增强异丁烯的生成选择性，减少与氢或一氧化碳强烈作用的位点数量，并减小表面Pt簇的大小，从而实现高脱氢选择性。
