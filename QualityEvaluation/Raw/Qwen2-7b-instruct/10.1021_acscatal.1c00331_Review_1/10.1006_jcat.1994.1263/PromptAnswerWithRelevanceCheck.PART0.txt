Kinetic studies show that addition of Sn to Pt enhances the selectivity for isobutylene formation at temperatures near 700 K.
Mssbauer spectroscopic studies show that Sn interacts with Pt to produce a Pt/Sn alloy.
Microcalorimetric investigations show that addition of Sn reduces the number of sites that strongly interact with hydrogen or carbon monoxide.
Microcalorimetric studies of ethylene adsorption suggest that addition of Sn inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species.
These results suggest that high dehydrogenation selectivity achieved by addition of Sn to Pt is caused by a decrease in the size of surface Pt ensembles.

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies based on the addition of elements such as tin (Sn) to platinum (Pt). The kinetic studies reveal that the inclusion of Sn to Pt enhances the selectivity for isobutylene formation at temperatures around 700 K. Mssbauer spectroscopy indicates that Sn interacts with Pt to form a Pt/Sn alloy. Microcalorimetric investigations demonstrate that adding Sn decreases the number of sites that strongly interact with hydrogen or carbon monoxide. Microcalorimetric studies on ethylene adsorption suggest that the presence of Sn inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species. These findings collectively suggest that the high dehydrogenation selectivity achieved by incorporating Sn into Pt is due to a reduction in the size of surface Pt ensembles.

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成根据铂（Pt）添加元素如锡（Sn）的变化而变化。动力学研究表明，在700 K左右的温度下，向Pt中添加Sn可以增强异丁烯形成的选择性。Mssbauer光谱显示，Sn与Pt相互作用形成Pt/Sn合金。微热容量研究显示，添加Sn减少了与氢或一氧化碳强烈相互作用的位点的数量。对乙烯吸附的微热容量研究表明，Sn的存在抑制了高度脱氢表面物种的形成。这些发现共同表明，通过将Sn加入到Pt中实现的高脱氢选择性是由于表面Pt簇尺寸的减少造成的。

The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts enhances the selectivity for isobutylene formation, reduces the number of strong interaction sites with hydrogen or carbon monoxide, and decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles, leading to high dehydrogenation selectivity.

The kinetic, microcalorimetric, and Mssbauer spectroscopic studies indicate that adding tin (Sn) to platinum (Pt) catalysts enhances the selectivity for isobutylene formation at around 700 K. The Sn-Pt interaction creates an alloy, reducing the number of strong adsorption sites for hydrogen and carbon monoxide. This reduction might occur due to preferential blocking or weakening of these sites, although some strong adsorption sites remain on a Pt/Sn catalyst with high dehydrogenation selectivity. Additionally, the microcalorimetric studies on ethylene adsorption suggest that the addition of Sn hinders the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species. Consequently, the high selectivity in dehydrogenation achieved by incorporating Sn into Pt catalysts is attributed to a decrease in the size of surface Pt ensembles.

这些动力学、微热容量和Mössbauer光谱研究表明，向铂（Pt）催化剂中添加锡（Sn）可以在约700 K时提高异丁烷转化为异丁烯的选择性。Sn与Pt的相互作用形成了一个Sn-Pt合金，减少了与氢和一氧化碳的强吸附位点的数量。这种减少可能由于优先堵塞或由于配体效应削弱这些位点而发生，尽管在具有高脱氢选择性的Sn-Pt催化剂上仍然存在一些强吸附位点。此外，对乙烷吸附的微热容量研究表明，添加Sn抑制了表面物种的强烈脱氢化形成。因此，通过在Pt催化剂中加入Sn实现的高脱氢选择性归因于表面Pt簇尺寸的减小。
