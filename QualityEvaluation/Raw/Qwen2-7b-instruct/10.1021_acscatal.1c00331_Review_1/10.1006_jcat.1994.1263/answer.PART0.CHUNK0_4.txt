Kinetic studies show that addition of Sn to Pt enhances the selectivity for isobutylene formation at temperatures near 700 K.
Mssbauer spectroscopic studies show that Sn interacts with Pt to produce a Pt/Sn alloy.
Microcalorimetric investigations show that addition of Sn reduces the number of sites that strongly interact with hydrogen or carbon monoxide.
Microcalorimetric studies of ethylene adsorption suggest that addition of Sn inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species.
These results suggest that high dehydrogenation selectivity achieved by addition of Sn to Pt is caused by a decrease in the size of surface Pt ensembles.

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies based on the presence of tin (Sn) as an additive to platinum (Pt). At temperatures near 700 K, the addition of Sn to Pt catalysts enhances the selectivity for isobutylene formation. Mssbauer spectroscopy indicates that Sn interacts with Pt to form a Pt/Sn alloy. Microcalorimetric studies reveal that the addition of Sn decreases the number of sites that strongly interact with hydrogen or carbon monoxide, possibly due to preferential blocking of sites by tin or weakening of sites through ligand effects. Additionally, Sn inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species during ethylene adsorption. These findings suggest that the high dehydrogenation selectivity achieved by adding Sn to Pt catalysts is likely caused by a reduction in the size of surface Pt ensembles.

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成基于铂（Pt）催化剂中锡（Sn）的添加。在约700 K的温度下，向Pt催化剂中添加Sn可以增强异丁烯形成的选择性。Mssbauer光谱显示Sn与Pt形成Pt/Sn合金。微热量法研究表明，Sn的添加减少了强烈与氢或一氧化碳相互作用的位点的数量，这可能是由于Sn优先阻塞位点或通过配体效应减弱位点。此外，Sn抑制了在乙炔吸附期间形成高度脱氢表面物种。这些发现表明，通过向Pt催化剂中添加Sn实现的高脱氢选择性很可能是表面Pt簇尺寸减少的结果。
