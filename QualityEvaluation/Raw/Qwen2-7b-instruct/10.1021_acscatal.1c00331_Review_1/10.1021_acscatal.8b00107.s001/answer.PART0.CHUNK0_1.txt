Answer: The provided literature details various aspects of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, including minimum energy pathways for C-H and C-C bond breaking, coverage of adsorption species over time, counts of reactions under different hydrogen pressures, flow directions of carbon species during PDH at a specific time, and geometries of transition states involved in C-H bond breaking reactions for C2 and C1 species, accompanied by bond-breaking distances. However, it does not directly address the question regarding the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, across different reaction conditions and catalyst types.
