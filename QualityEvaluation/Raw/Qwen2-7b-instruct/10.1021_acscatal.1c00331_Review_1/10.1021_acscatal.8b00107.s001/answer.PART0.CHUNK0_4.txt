The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques such as kinetic modeling, thermodynamic analysis, and computational simulations have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. These methods allow for the detailed examination of reaction pathways, energy barriers, and the interaction dynamics between reactants, products, and catalyst surfaces. By understanding the specific conditions under which coke forms, researchers can optimize catalyst design and operation parameters to minimize coke buildup and enhance the efficiency and selectivity of PDH reactions.

In particular, the document presents a series of tables (S1-S97) that provide quantitative data on the behavior of various species during PDH reactions. These tables detail the energy changes associated with adsorption processes, the lateral interactions between adsorbed species, and the counts of reactions occurring under different pressures of hydrogen (H2). The data in these tables can be used to infer how the composition of coke deposits might change under varying conditions. For instance, the energy barriers for adsorption and desorption reactions (Tables S1-S2) offer insights into the stability of coke precursors on the catalyst surface, while the counts of reactions on different pressures of H2 (Tables S3-S97) shed light on the effect of pressure on the formation and removal of coke. By analyzing these data, scientists can gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing coke formation and develop strategies to mitigate its negative impact on PDH processes.

在催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭沉积物组成，在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下存在显著差异。为了揭示这些系统的复杂性和多样性，研究人员采用了动力学建模、热力学分析和计算模拟等技术来研究焦炭成分。这些方法允许对反应路径、能量壁垒以及反应物、产物与催化剂表面之间的相互作用进行详细的研究。通过了解焦炭形成的特定条件，可以优化催化剂设计和操作参数，以减少焦炭积累并提高PDH反应的效率和选择性。

文献中提供了系列表格（S1-S97），详细记录了PDH反应过程中各种物种的行为。这些表格包括吸附过程的能量变化（表S1-S2）、吸附物种之间的横向相互作用（表S1-S2）和在不同氢气压力下的反应计数（表S3-S97）。这些数据可以用来推断在不同条件下焦炭沉积物的组成可能会如何变化。例如，吸附和解吸反应的能量壁垒（表S1-S2）为理解焦炭前体在催化剂表面的稳定性提供了见解，而不同氢气压力下的反应计数（表S3-S97）则揭示了压力对焦炭形成和去除的影响。通过分析这些数据，科学家可以深入了解焦炭形成机制，并开发策略来减轻其对PDH过程的负面影响。
