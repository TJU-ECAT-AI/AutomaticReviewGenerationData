The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques such as kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. These techniques allow researchers to understand the interactions between reactants and products, the formation pathways of coke, and the distribution of coke species on the catalyst surface. By examining the minimum energy pathways of C-H and C-C bond breaking (Figures S1 and S2), the coverage of adsorption species over time (Figure S3), and the flow directions of carbon species during the PDH process (Figure S5), scientists can gain insights into the mechanisms governing the deposition and evolution of coke in PDH reactions. Additionally, the lateral interactions among co-adsorption species on the Pt(111) surface (Table S2) contribute to the understanding of how different molecules interact and affect the PDH process. The count of reactions on various pressures of hydrogen (Table S3 and Figures S4) further aids in identifying the conditions that influence the PDH efficiency and coke formation.

In summary, the coke deposits in catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation reactions exhibit significant variation depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst type. Researchers use advanced simulation methods, detailed reaction pathway analysis, and reaction counts under different conditions to dissect the intricate processes involved in coke formation and its impact on the overall PDH reaction efficiency.
