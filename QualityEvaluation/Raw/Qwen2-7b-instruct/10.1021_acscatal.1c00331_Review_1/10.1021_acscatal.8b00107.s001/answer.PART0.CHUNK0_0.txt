Where qvib,X is the partition functions of adsorbed X, kb is Boltzmanns constant, T is temperature, h is Planks constant, vi is the vibrate frequency calculated by DFT,  represent transition state, and the equations are suitable for reverse reaction too.

For non-activated adsorption reactions, pre-exponential factor is calculated by:=

Where Ssite is the effective area of one site, m is the mass of one gas molecule, T is temperature. = ,() ,() ,() ,
Where qrot,X(gas) is the rotational partition function, qtrans2D,X(gas)is the 2D translational partition function, which are calculated by:,() = 8

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The pre-exponential factor for various types of surface reactions is calculated using specific formulas based on partition functions, vibrational frequencies, and other parameters. These calculations apply to both forward and reverse reactions, as well as non-activated and activated adsorption processes.
