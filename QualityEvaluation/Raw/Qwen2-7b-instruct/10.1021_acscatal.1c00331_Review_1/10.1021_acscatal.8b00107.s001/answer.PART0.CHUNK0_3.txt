The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques such as kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations, detailed examination of reaction pathways, coverage of adsorption species over time, counts of reactions under different hydrogen pressures, and visualization of flow directions of carbon species in PDH processes at specific times have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. These methods allow researchers to understand how coke forms, its structure, and its impact on the catalytic activity, enabling the optimization of reaction conditions and catalyst design for improved efficiency and selectivity in PDH reactions.
