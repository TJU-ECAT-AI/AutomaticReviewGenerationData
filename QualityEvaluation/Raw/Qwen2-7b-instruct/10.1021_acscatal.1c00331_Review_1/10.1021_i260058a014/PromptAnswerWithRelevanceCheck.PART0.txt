[1] "The yield, I, is maximized by the optimal choice of the on stream time tf."
[2] "The linear relation between the regeneration time and the average coke content of the catalyst is a reasonable approximation of the true relation."
[3] "The optimal cycle time is then 0.4 h, which is clearly suboptimal, not only for the butadiene yield, but also for the selectivity."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The maximum butadiene yield, denoted as I, is achieved through the ideal selection of the operational duration, tf. The direct correlation between the catalyst's average coke content and the regeneration time serves as a rational estimate of the actual relationship. The calculated optimal cycle duration stands at 0.4 hours, which, beyond the butadiene output, also negatively impacts selectivity.

Answer: The kinetics of 1-butene dehydrogenation were determined over a Cr203-Al203 catalyst in a differential reactor. The study aimed to discriminate between competing Langmuir-Hinshelwood models through a sequential experimental design. Kinetics of coking from butene and butadiene, as well as deactivation functions for both coking and the main reaction, were also determined using a thermobalance. The derived equations from the differential reactor results accurately predicted the performance of an experimental integral reactor. The impact of internal transport limitations was explored, and an industrial reactor was simulated and optimized.
