The kinetics of butene dehydrogenation were studied over a Cr203-AI203 catalyst in a differential reactor between 490 and 600 O
C. The discrimination between kinetic models was achieved through a sequentially designed experimental program. The deactivation functions for coking and the main reaction were determined using a thermobalance. The study also investigated the effect of internal transport limitations. Finally, an industrial reactor was simulated and optimized.

在490至600 O
C的温度范围内，通过差分反应器研究了Cr203-AI203催化剂上的丁烯脱氢动力学。通过顺序设计的实验程序实现了对Langmuir-Hinshelwood模型的竞争性的区分。使用热平衡量定了丁二烯沉积和主要反应的失活函数。还研究了内部传输限制的影响。最后，对工业反应器进行了模拟和优化。
