[1] "The kinetics of 1-butene dehydrogenation over a Cr203-AI203 catalyst between 490 and 600 O C were determined in a differential reactor."
[2] "The effect of transport phenomena inside the particle is generally expressed by means of the effectiveness factor,which has been related to the geometry of the catalyst, the effective diffusivity and the rate parameters of the reaction in a closed form only for single reactions and simple kinetics."
[3] "The optimization of the process, which will be discussed in a later section, required a large number of numerical integrations of the reactor model, including the set of equations (23)."
[4] "The butadiene yield, averaged over one complete cycle (including dehydrogenation, purge, regeneration and evacuation) is given by the following formula."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques that have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems include chromatography, spectroscopy, and microscopic examination. These methods allow for the identification and quantification of the various components of the coke deposits, providing insights into their structure and origin.
