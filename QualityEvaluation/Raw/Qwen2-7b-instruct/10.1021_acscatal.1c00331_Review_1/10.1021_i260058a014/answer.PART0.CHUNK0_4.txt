Answer: The kinetics of 1-butene dehydrogenation were determined over a Cr203-Al203 catalyst in a differential reactor. The study aimed to discriminate between competing Langmuir-Hinshelwood models through a sequential experimental design. Kinetics of coking from butene and butadiene, as well as deactivation functions for both coking and the main reaction, were also determined using a thermobalance. The derived equations from the differential reactor results accurately predicted the performance of an experimental integral reactor. The impact of internal transport limitations was explored, and an industrial reactor was simulated and optimized.
