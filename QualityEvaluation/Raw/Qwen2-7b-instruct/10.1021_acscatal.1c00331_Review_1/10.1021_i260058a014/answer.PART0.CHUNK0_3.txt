The kinetics of butene dehydrogenation were determined in an electrical furnace equipped with a quartz tube. Experiments were conducted at four temperatures: 490, 525, 560, and 600 degrees Celsius. The effect of internal transport limitations was investigated. The optimization of the process necessitated numerous numerical integrations of the reactor model.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The temperature was regulated by two thermocouples, one located in the center of the catalyst zone and another near the wall. The feed stream was standardized and dried conventionally. The exit gases were examined using gas chromatography on a 20% propylene carbonate/chromosorb column. The conversion rate was maintained under 2% by modifying the catalyst quantity and gas flow rates.

[1] "The deactivation function for the dehydrogenation was also determined by means of the thermobalance."
[2] "The agreement with the value found for the deactiva- tion parameter for the two coking reactions is remarkable."
[3] "It may be concluded that the main reaction and the coking reactions occur on the same sites."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The deactivation function for the dehydrogenation process was determined using the thermobalance. The compatibility between this value and the deactivation parameter from the two coking reactions is noteworthy. It can be deduced that the primary reaction and the coking reactions take place at identical locations.

[1] "The yield, I, is maximized by the optimal choice of the on stream time tf."
[2] "The linear relation between the regeneration time and the average coke content of the catalyst is a reasonable approximation of the true relation."
[3] "The optimal cycle time is then 0.4 h, which is clearly suboptimal, not only for the butadiene yield, but also for the selectivity."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The maximum butadiene yield, denoted as I, is achieved through the ideal selection of the operational duration, tf. The direct correlation between the catalyst's average coke content and the regeneration time serves as a rational estimate of the actual relationship. The calculated optimal cycle duration stands at 0.4 hours, which, beyond the butadiene output, also negatively impacts selectivity.
