[1] "Propane dehydrogenation over a Pt-Sn/7-A1203 catalyst and a commercial Pt/A1203 catalyst (CK 303) has been studied in an oscillating microbalance reactor."
[2] "An excellent agreement was found between the selected model and the observed coke formation between 450 and 580  independently of whether or not hydrogen was present in the feed."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies significantly based on reaction conditions and catalyst type. Analytical techniques, such as temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents. In this study, the coke deposits were characterized over a range of temperatures and with and without hydrogen presence in the feed. The model selected for the study showed a good agreement with the observed coke formation across the specified temperature range (450-580°C).

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成基于反应条件和催化剂类型而有很大差异。采用技术如温度程序氧化（TPO）来阐明焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性。在本研究中，焦炭沉积物在不同温度范围以及有无氢气存在的情况下进行了表征。所选模型与观测到的焦炭形成在整个指定温度范围内（450-580°C）的良好一致性表明，焦炭组成会根据反应条件和催化剂类型发生变化。
