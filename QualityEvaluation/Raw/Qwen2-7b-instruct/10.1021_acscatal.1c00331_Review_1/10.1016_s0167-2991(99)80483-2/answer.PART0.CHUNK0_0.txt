<p>The present study deals with the use of an oscillating microbalance reactor (TEOM) to study the dehydrogenation of propane. The TEOM gives a realistic representation of a fixed-bed reactor and is very well suited for studying coke formation, kinetics of the main reaction as well as for the coking reaction.</p>
<p>Very few reports exist about the use of the new TEOM technique for studying supported metal catalysts.</p>
<p>The kinetics of coke formation and the deactivation functions for the coking and the dehydrogenation reaction were determined.</p>
<p>An excellent agreement was found between the selected model and the observed coke formation between 450 and 580 independently of whether or not hydrogen was present in the feed.</p>

1. The coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, vary significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques such as the oscillating microbalance reactor (TEOM) have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. The TEOM provides a realistic representation of a fixed-bed reactor and is well-suited for studying coke formation, the kinetics of the main reaction, and the coking reaction. This technique allows for detailed examination of the coke formation process under various conditions.
2. The coke deposits consist of various components, including coke on the metal surface, coke on and near the metal, and graphitic coke on the support. The proportions and characteristics of these components can differ significantly depending on the specific reaction conditions and the catalyst used.
