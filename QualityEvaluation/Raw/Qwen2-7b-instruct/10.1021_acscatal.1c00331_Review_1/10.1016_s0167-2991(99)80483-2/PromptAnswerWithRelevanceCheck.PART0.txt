1. The coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, vary significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques such as the oscillating microbalance reactor (TEOM) have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. The TEOM provides a realistic representation of a fixed-bed reactor and is well-suited for studying coke formation, the kinetics of the main reaction, and the coking reaction. This technique allows for detailed examination of the coke formation process under various conditions.
2. The coke deposits consist of various components, including coke on the metal surface, coke on and near the metal, and graphitic coke on the support. The proportions and characteristics of these components can differ significantly depending on the specific reaction conditions and the catalyst used.

[1] "The kinetics of coke formation and the deactivation functions for the coking and the dehydrogenation reaction were determined."
[2] "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the enhanced lifetime of dehydrogenation catalyst as a result of Sn addition, pointing to such effects as inhibition of the formation of dehydrogenated hydrocarbon species required for coking, isomerization and hydrogenolysis [1]."
[3] "Larsson et al. [8] identified three different types of coke in propane dehydrogenation, their conclusions were also based on TPO experiments. The three types were coke on the support, coke on and in the vicinity of the metal and graphitic coke on the support."
[4] "The initial TOFs would be expected to be similar for the two catalysts, as also observed previously [6]."
[5] "It is not always straightforward to determine the initial activity in deactivating processes and in particular in this case with a rapid initial deactivation."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques such as temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents. In the study, coke was found to deposit on the support, near the metal, and even as graphitic coke on the support. Despite the differences in catalyst composition and operating conditions, the initial activity of the two catalysts, a commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (CK 303) and a Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, showed a similar pattern, indicating that the initial activity is crucial for understanding catalyst deactivation. However, determining the precise initial activity remains challenging due to the rapid initial deactivation observed in these systems.

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随着不同的反应条件和催化剂类型的变化而显著变化。采用温度程序氧化（TPO）等分析技术揭示了焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性。研究中发现，焦炭沉积在支撑材料上、金属附近，甚至作为支撑材料上的石墨状焦炭。尽管催化剂组成和操作条件存在差异，两种催化剂的初始活性（一种商业铂/氧化铝催化剂（CK 303），另一种是铂-锡/氧化铝催化剂）显示出了相似的趋势，这表明初始活性对于理解催化剂失活至关重要。然而，由于这些系统中观察到的快速初始失活，精确确定初始活性仍然具有挑战性。

[1] "Two major reduction peaks are observed as expected [14] with maxima at 280  and at 495 respectively."
[2] "On the commercial Pt/A1203 catalyst,two major reduction peaks are observed as expected [14] with maxima at 280  and at 495 respectively."
[3] "The Pt-Sn catalyst shows a similar low-temperature reduction peak. The peak has a shoulder at about 380  but the 480  peak is not present."
[4] "The high temperature peaks can be attributed to the support."
[5] "Instead a peak at a higher temperattwe is seen (680 as well as high temperature peaks (900  and above, not shown here)."
[6] "The chosen pre-treatment procedure for the kinetic experiments which also included a 4 h hydrogen treatment at 520  should be sufficient to reduce Pt to its metallic state."
[7] "Coke formation was much more rapid on the Pt-Sn catalyst, and at the same time the catalytic activity was also higher."
[8] "Since dehydrogenation is a facile reaction the initial TOFs would be expected to be similar for the two catalysts, as also observed previously [6]."
[9] "Still the Pt-Sn catalyst shows a slightly higher initial TOF compared to the CK 303, but the difference is now much smaller."
[10] "Taking into consideration the differences in the coking and deactivation over these two samples, the results indicate that the initial activity is quite similar, which is in line with the earlier findings [6]."
[11] "Eq. 4 was found to describe the coke formation versus time on stream very well in both cases."
[12] "Eq. 4 was also found to describe the experimental coking data very well across the whole range of temperatures investigated (450 to 580 independent of whether hydrogen was present or not and at different partial pressures of propane."
[13] "By fitting TOF versus time on stream to an exponential model, TOF 0 was found to be 4.8 s"."
[14] "However, the initial reaction period is very important for the resulting deactivation of the catalyst."
[15] "It is seen from Figure 5 that the manner in which the extrapolation to initial activity is done strongly effects the value of the initial activity."
[16] "In the figures presented above, the activity is plotted versus the time on stream."
[17] "The models corresponding to Eqs. 1 and 2 are plotted together with the experimental data obtained at 520"

1. The coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, vary depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques such as temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.

2. The coke formation and deactivation functions in PDH reactions depend on various factors including the presence of hydrogen in the feed gas, the partial pressures of propane, and the type of catalyst used. Different catalysts exhibit varying degrees of deactivation and coke formation rates under the same conditions.

4. The coke formation kinetics and deactivation functions for the coking and main reaction have been determined through experiments conducted in an oscillating microbalance reactor. These findings provide insights into the coke deposit dynamics and help understand the deactivation mechanisms in PDH reactions.

5. The selected model accurately predicts the coke formation process across a wide temperature range (450-580°C) regardless of the hydrogen presence in the feed. This indicates that the model captures the essential features of coke formation in PDH reactions effectively.

6. The coke formation and deactivation functions for the coking and main reaction have been determined, offering valuable information on the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH reactions. Analytical techniques like TPO play a crucial role in understanding the coke formation patterns and the deactivation mechanisms associated with different catalysts.
