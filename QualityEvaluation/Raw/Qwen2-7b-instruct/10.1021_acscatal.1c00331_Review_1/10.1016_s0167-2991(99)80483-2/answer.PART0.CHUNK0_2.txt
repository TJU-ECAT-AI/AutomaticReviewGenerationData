[1] "Propane dehydrogenation over a Pt-Sn/7-A1203 catalyst and a commercial Pt/A1203 catalyst (CK 303) has been studied in an oscillating microbalance reactor."
[2] "An excellent agreement was found between the selected model and the observed coke formation between 450 and 580 °C independently of whether or not hydrogen was present in the feed."

How does the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, vary across different reaction conditions and catalyst types, and what analytical techniques have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems?
The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, especially in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. In this study, coke formation and the deactivation functions for the coking and main reaction were determined using an oscillating microbalance reactor. Analytical techniques employed to understand the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents include temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) and the use of an oscillating microbalance reactor (TEOM).
