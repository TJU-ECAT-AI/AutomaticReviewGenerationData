[1] "Two major reduction peaks are observed as expected [14] with maxima at 280  and at 495 respectively."
[2] "On the commercial Pt/A1203 catalyst,two major reduction peaks are observed as expected [14] with maxima at 280  and at 495 respectively."
[3] "The Pt-Sn catalyst shows a similar low-temperature reduction peak. The peak has a shoulder at about 380  but the 480  peak is not present."
[4] "The high temperature peaks can be attributed to the support."
[5] "Instead a peak at a higher temperattwe is seen (680 as well as high temperature peaks (900  and above, not shown here)."
[6] "The chosen pre-treatment procedure for the kinetic experiments which also included a 4 h hydrogen treatment at 520  should be sufficient to reduce Pt to its metallic state."
[7] "Coke formation was much more rapid on the Pt-Sn catalyst, and at the same time the catalytic activity was also higher."
[8] "Since dehydrogenation is a facile reaction the initial TOFs would be expected to be similar for the two catalysts, as also observed previously [6]."
[9] "Still the Pt-Sn catalyst shows a slightly higher initial TOF compared to the CK 303, but the difference is now much smaller."
[10] "Taking into consideration the differences in the coking and deactivation over these two samples, the results indicate that the initial activity is quite similar, which is in line with the earlier findings [6]."
[11] "Eq. 4 was found to describe the coke formation versus time on stream very well in both cases."
[12] "Eq. 4 was also found to describe the experimental coking data very well across the whole range of temperatures investigated (450 to 580 independent of whether hydrogen was present or not and at different partial pressures of propane."
[13] "By fitting TOF versus time on stream to an exponential model, TOF 0 was found to be 4.8 s"."
[14] "However, the initial reaction period is very important for the resulting deactivation of the catalyst."
[15] "It is seen from Figure 5 that the manner in which the extrapolation to initial activity is done strongly effects the value of the initial activity."
[16] "In the figures presented above, the activity is plotted versus the time on stream."
[17] "The models corresponding to Eqs. 1 and 2 are plotted together with the experimental data obtained at 520"

1. The coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, vary depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques such as temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.

2. The coke formation and deactivation functions in PDH reactions depend on various factors including the presence of hydrogen in the feed gas, the partial pressures of propane, and the type of catalyst used. Different catalysts exhibit varying degrees of deactivation and coke formation rates under the same conditions.

3. The coke formation and deactivation rates can significantly differ between catalysts even when subjected to similar reaction conditions. Factors such as metal composition, support properties, and reaction conditions influence the coke formation patterns.

4. The coke formation kinetics and deactivation functions for the coking and main reaction have been determined through experiments conducted in an oscillating microbalance reactor. These findings provide insights into the coke deposit dynamics and help understand the deactivation mechanisms in PDH reactions.

5. The selected model accurately predicts the coke formation process across a wide temperature range (450-580°C) regardless of the hydrogen presence in the feed. This indicates that the model captures the essential features of coke formation in PDH reactions effectively.

6. The coke formation and deactivation functions for the coking and main reaction have been determined, offering valuable information on the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH reactions. Analytical techniques like TPO play a crucial role in understanding the coke formation patterns and the deactivation mechanisms associated with different catalysts.
