[1] "The kinetics of coke formation and the deactivation functions for the coking and the dehydrogenation reaction were determined."
[2] "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the enhanced lifetime of dehydrogenation catalyst as a result of Sn addition, pointing to such effects as inhibition of the formation of dehydrogenated hydrocarbon species required for coking, isomerization and hydrogenolysis [1]."
[3] "Larsson et al. [8] identified three different types of coke in propane dehydrogenation, their conclusions were also based on TPO experiments. The three types were coke on the support, coke on and in the vicinity of the metal and graphitic coke on the support."
[4] "The initial TOFs would be expected to be similar for the two catalysts, as also observed previously [6]."
[5] "It is not always straightforward to determine the initial activity in deactivating processes and in particular in this case with a rapid initial deactivation."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques such as temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents. In the study, coke was found to deposit on the support, near the metal, and even as graphitic coke on the support. Despite the differences in catalyst composition and operating conditions, the initial activity of the two catalysts, a commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (CK 303) and a Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, showed a similar pattern, indicating that the initial activity is crucial for understanding catalyst deactivation. However, determining the precise initial activity remains challenging due to the rapid initial deactivation observed in these systems.

在催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随着不同的反应条件和催化剂类型的变化而显著变化。采用温度程序氧化（TPO）等分析技术揭示了焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性。研究中发现，焦炭沉积在支撑材料上、金属附近，甚至作为支撑材料上的石墨状焦炭。尽管催化剂组成和操作条件存在差异，两种催化剂的初始活性（一种商业铂/氧化铝催化剂（CK 303），另一种是铂-锡/氧化铝催化剂）显示出了相似的趋势，这表明初始活性对于理解催化剂失活至关重要。然而，由于这些系统中观察到的快速初始失活，精确确定初始活性仍然具有挑战性。
