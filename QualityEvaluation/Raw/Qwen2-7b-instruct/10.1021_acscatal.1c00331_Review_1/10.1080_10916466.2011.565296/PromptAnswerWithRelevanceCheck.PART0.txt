[2] "The coke formation kinetics was successfully described by a coke formation model based on a monolayer-multilayer mechanism."
[3] "The kinetic order for monolayer coke formation was found to be two, which would support a coke formation step involving two active sites."

1. In propane dehydrogenation reactions, the composition of coke deposits varies with different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques such as thermal gravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) have been employed to understand the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.
2. The coke formation kinetics was successfully modeled using a monolayer-multilayer mechanism. The kinetic order for monolayer coke formation was found to be two, suggesting a process that involves two active sites. The activation energy for monolayer coke formation was significantly lower than that for multilayer coke formation, indicating that metal presence can facilitate coke formation on the catalyst surface.
3. A time-dependent deactivation model was developed to describe the loss of catalyst activity over time and under varying temperatures. This model helped in predicting the coke deposition and catalyst activity, which matched well with experimental data.

1. The coke formation in catalytic systems, specifically in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. This variation is characterized by the coke formation model, which incorporates a monolayer-multilayer mechanism. Catalyst deactivation is described by a time-dependent function. The kinetic order for monolayer coke formation is determined to be two, suggesting a step involving two active sites. Conversely, the kinetic order for multilayer coke formation is found to be zero. The activation energy for monolayer coke formation is identified as 29.1 kJ/mol, which is notably lower than the activation energy of 265.1 kJ/mol for multilayer coke formation, indicating that the presence of metals can facilitate coke formation on the catalyst surface.

2. The coke formation kinetics in catalytic systems, specifically in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, was successfully described by a model that employs a monolayer-multilayer mechanism. The activation energy for single-layer coke formation was discovered to be 29.1 kJ/mol, which is significantly lower than the activation energy of around 265.1 kJ/mol for multi-layer coke formation. This suggests that the presence of metals can enhance coke formation on the catalyst surface during PDH reactions.

In the context of propane dehydrogenation over a commercial Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the composition of coke deposits varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke deposits consist of monolayer and multilayer structures, with activation energies of 29.1 kJ/mol and 265.1 kJ/mol, respectively, for monolayer and multilayer coke formation. The presence of metals, such as platinum and tin, promotes coke formation on the catalyst surface. Analytical techniques, specifically thermogravimetric differential thermal analyzers (TG-DTA), were employed to measure the amounts of coke deposited on the catalyst surface over time. The kinetics of coke formation were modeled using a monolayer-multilayer mechanism, which allowed for the prediction of coke deposition patterns based on the reaction conditions and catalyst properties.

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke is characterized by its monolayer-multilayer structure, with the monolayer showing a lower activation energy (29.1 kJ/mol) for formation compared to the multilayer (265.1 kJ/mol). This suggests that the presence of metals, like platinum (Pt) in the case of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, can enhance coke formation on the catalyst surface. Analytical techniques such as thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) are employed to measure the amounts of coke deposited on the catalyst over time. Furthermore, a kinetic model based on a monolayer-multilayer mechanism is used to describe the coke formation process, and a time-dependent deactivation model is developed to quantify the loss of catalyst activity associated with coke buildup.

在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下，催化系统中的焦炭沉积物的组成会发生变化。焦炭具有单层-多层结构，单层的形成激活能（29.1 kJ/mol）低于多层（265.1 kJ/mol）。这表明，铂（Pt），如在Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3催化剂中，可以促进催化剂表面的焦炭形成。使用热重差热分析（TG-DTA）等技术来测量催化剂上焦炭沉积的数量随时间的变化。此外，基于单层-多层机制的动力学模型被用来描述焦炭形成过程，而一个时间依赖的失活模型则被开发出来，以量化与焦炭积累相关的催化剂活性损失。
