[1] "Propane conversions were measured for catalyst time on stream of up to nine days."
[2] "The coke formation kinetics was successfully described by a coke formation model based on a monolayer-multilayer mechanism."
[3] "The kinetic order for monolayer coke formation was found to be two, which would support a coke formation step involving two active sites."
[4] "The activation energy for monolayer coke formation was found to be 29.1 kJ/mol, which was lower than the activation energy of about 265.1 kJ/mol for multilayer coke formation indicating that the presence of metals can promote coke formation on the catalyst surface."
[5] "A time-dependent deactivation model was also developed to describe the loss of catalyst activity as function of time-on-stream and reaction temperatures."
[6] "Predicted values of coke deposition and catalyst activity from the two models were in good agreement with experimental data."

1. In propane dehydrogenation reactions, the composition of coke deposits varies with different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques such as thermal gravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) have been employed to understand the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.
2. The coke formation kinetics was successfully modeled using a monolayer-multilayer mechanism. The kinetic order for monolayer coke formation was found to be two, suggesting a process that involves two active sites. The activation energy for monolayer coke formation was significantly lower than that for multilayer coke formation, indicating that metal presence can facilitate coke formation on the catalyst surface.
3. A time-dependent deactivation model was developed to describe the loss of catalyst activity over time and under varying temperatures. This model helped in predicting the coke deposition and catalyst activity, which matched well with experimental data.

1. 在丙烷脱氢反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成会随着不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。为了理解这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性，已经使用了诸如热重分析/差热分析（TG/DTA）等分析技术。
2. 焦炭形成动力学成功地通过单层-多层机制模型进行了描述。单层焦炭形成的动力学顺序被发现为二，这表明该过程涉及两个活性位点。单层焦炭形成的过程的活化能明显低于多层焦炭形成，表明金属的存在可以促进催化剂表面的焦炭形成。
3. 开发了一个时间依赖性失活模型来描述催化剂活性随时间以及温度变化而减少的过程。该模型有助于预测焦炭沉积和催化剂活性，并且与实验数据相匹配。
