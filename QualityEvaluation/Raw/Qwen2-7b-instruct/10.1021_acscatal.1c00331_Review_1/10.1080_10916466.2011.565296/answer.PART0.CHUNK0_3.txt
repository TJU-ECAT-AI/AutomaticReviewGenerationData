[1] "The coke formation kinetics was successfully described by a coke formation model based on a monolayer-multilayer mechanism."
[2] "The amounts of coke deposited on the catalyst were measured after one, three, six, and nine days on stream using a thermogravimetric differential thermal analyzer (TG-DTA) for each reaction temperature."
[3] "The activation energies for monolayer and multilayer coke formation were found to be 29.1 and 265.1 kJ/mol, respectively, indicating that the presence of metals could promote coke formation on the catalyst surface during propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "A time-dependent deactivation model was also developed to describe the loss of catalyst activity as function of time-on-stream and reaction temperatures."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke is characterized by its monolayer-multilayer structure, with the monolayer showing a lower activation energy (29.1 kJ/mol) for formation compared to the multilayer (265.1 kJ/mol). This suggests that the presence of metals, like platinum (Pt) in the case of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, can enhance coke formation on the catalyst surface. Analytical techniques such as thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) are employed to measure the amounts of coke deposited on the catalyst over time. Furthermore, a kinetic model based on a monolayer-multilayer mechanism is used to describe the coke formation process, and a time-dependent deactivation model is developed to quantify the loss of catalyst activity associated with coke buildup.

在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下，催化系统中的焦炭沉积物的组成会发生变化。焦炭具有单层-多层结构，单层的形成激活能（29.1 kJ/mol）低于多层（265.1 kJ/mol）。这表明，铂（Pt），如在Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3催化剂中，可以促进催化剂表面的焦炭形成。使用热重差热分析（TG-DTA）等技术来测量催化剂上焦炭沉积的数量随时间的变化。此外，基于单层-多层机制的动力学模型被用来描述焦炭形成过程，而一个时间依赖的失活模型则被开发出来，以量化与焦炭积累相关的催化剂活性损失。
