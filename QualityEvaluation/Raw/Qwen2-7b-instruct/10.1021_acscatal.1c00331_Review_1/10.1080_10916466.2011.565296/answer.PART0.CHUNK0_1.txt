1. The coke formation in catalytic systems, specifically in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. This variation is characterized by the coke formation model, which incorporates a monolayer-multilayer mechanism. Catalyst deactivation is described by a time-dependent function. The kinetic order for monolayer coke formation is determined to be two, suggesting a step involving two active sites. Conversely, the kinetic order for multilayer coke formation is found to be zero. The activation energy for monolayer coke formation is identified as 29.1 kJ/mol, which is notably lower than the activation energy of 265.1 kJ/mol for multilayer coke formation, indicating that the presence of metals can facilitate coke formation on the catalyst surface.

1. 催化剂系统的焦炭沉积物在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下存在差异，这一差异通过包含单层多层机制的焦炭形成模型来描述。催化剂失活由时间依赖性函数表示。单层焦炭形成的动力学序数被确定为两个，暗示了一个涉及两个活性位点的步骤。相反，多层焦炭形成的动力学序数被发现为零。单层焦炭形成的活化能被识别为29.1 kJ/mol，这明显低于多层焦炭形成的活化能265.1 kJ/mol，表明金属的存在可以促进催化剂表面的焦炭形成。

2. The coke formation kinetics in catalytic systems, specifically in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, was successfully described by a model that employs a monolayer-multilayer mechanism. The activation energy for single-layer coke formation was discovered to be 29.1 kJ/mol, which is significantly lower than the activation energy of around 265.1 kJ/mol for multi-layer coke formation. This suggests that the presence of metals can enhance coke formation on the catalyst surface during PDH reactions.

2. 催化剂系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭形成动力学，通过采用单层多层机制的模型成功地进行了描述。单层焦炭形成的活化能被发现为29.1 kJ/mol，这远低于多层焦炭形成的活化能约265.1 kJ/mol。这表明金属的存在可以增强PDH反应中催化剂表面的焦炭形成。
