[1] "Propane dehydrogenation was carried over a commercial Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst at atmospheric pressure and reaction temperatures of 580, 600, and 620°C and WHSV of 11 h−1 in an experimental tubular quartz reactor."
[2] "The amounts of coke deposited on the catalyst were measured after one, three, six, and nine days on stream using a thermogravimetric differential thermal analyzer (TG-DTA) for each reaction temperature."
[3] "The coke formation kinetics was successfully described by a coke formation model based on a monolayer-multilayer mechanism."
[4] "The activation energy for monolayer coke formation was found to be 29.1 kJ/mol, which was lower than the activation energy of about 265.1 kJ/mol for multilayer coke formation indicating that the presence of metals can promote coke formation on the catalyst surface."
[5] "The proposed coke formation rate equations can be evaluated for different sets of parameters m and n related to the kinetic order of coke formation for monolayer and multilayer coke, respectively."
[6] "Experimental data for amounts of coke deposited on catalyst surface for different reaction temperatures and time-on-streams were used to estimate the model parameters by minimizing the following objective function using the fmin search function in Matlab optimization toolbox."

In the context of propane dehydrogenation over a commercial Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the composition of coke deposits varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The coke deposits consist of monolayer and multilayer structures, with activation energies of 29.1 kJ/mol and 265.1 kJ/mol, respectively, for monolayer and multilayer coke formation. The presence of metals, such as platinum and tin, promotes coke formation on the catalyst surface. Analytical techniques, specifically thermogravimetric differential thermal analyzers (TG-DTA), were employed to measure the amounts of coke deposited on the catalyst surface over time. The kinetics of coke formation were modeled using a monolayer-multilayer mechanism, which allowed for the prediction of coke deposition patterns based on the reaction conditions and catalyst properties.

在商业Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢反应的过程中，焦炭沉积物的组成随不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。焦炭沉积物包括单层和多层结构，单层焦炭形成和多层焦炭形成的活化能分别为29.1 kJ/mol和约265.1 kJ/mol，表明金属的存在促进催化剂表面的焦炭形成。使用热重差热分析（TG-DTA）等分析技术测量了催化剂表面随时间沉积的焦炭量。通过单层-多层机制模型描述了焦炭形成动力学，该模型允许根据反应条件和催化剂性质预测焦炭沉积模式。
