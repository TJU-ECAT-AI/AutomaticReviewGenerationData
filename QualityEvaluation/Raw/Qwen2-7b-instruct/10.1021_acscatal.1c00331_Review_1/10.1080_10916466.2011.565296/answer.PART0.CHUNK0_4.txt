[1] "The coke content increased sharply with time-on-stream during an initial stage followed by a more moderate linear increase during the later stage of the reaction."
[2] "The activation energies for monolayer and multilayer coke formation were found to be 29.1 and 265.1 kJ/mol, respectively, indicating that the presence of metals could promote coke formation on the catalyst surface during propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "A monolayer-multilayer coke deposition model was proposed to describe the kinetics of coke formation on a commercial Pt-Sn/ -Al2O3 catalyst."
[4] "A time-dependent deactivation model was also developed to describe the loss of catalyst activity as function of time-on-stream and reaction temperatures."

1. The coke content in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation reactions, varies significantly with changes in reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques such as thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) have been utilized to identify and characterize the diverse components of coke deposits.

2. The activation energies for monolayer and multilayer coke formation were determined to be 29.1 kJ/mol and 265.1 kJ/mol, respectively. This suggests that the presence of metals, like those in the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, can facilitate coke formation on the catalyst surface during propane dehydrogenation.

3. A kinetic model incorporating a monolayer-multilayer mechanism was developed to elucidate the dynamics of coke formation on a commercial Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. This model helps in understanding the complex process of coke deposition.

4. A time-dependent deactivation model was formulated to quantify the loss of catalyst activity due to coke deposition. This model accounts for the gradual decrease in catalyst efficiency as a result of coke coverage on the catalyst surface.

1. 在催化系统中，尤其是丙烷脱氢反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随反应条件和催化剂类型的变化而显著变化。热重差热分析（TG-DTA）等分析技术被用于识别和表征焦炭沉积物的多种成分。

2. 焦炭形成步骤的活化能分别为29.1 kJ/mol和265.1 kJ/mol，表明在丙烷脱氢过程中，催化剂表面的金属如Pt-Sn/Al2O3的存在可以促进焦炭形成。

3. 提出了一种包含单层-多层机制的动态模型，以阐明商业Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂上的焦炭形成动力学。此模型有助于理解焦炭沉积的复杂过程。

4. 制定了一个时间依赖性失活模型，以量化由于焦炭沉积导致的催化剂活性下降。该模型考虑了催化剂表面焦炭覆盖引起的催化剂效率逐渐降低。
