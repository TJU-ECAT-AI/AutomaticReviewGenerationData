[1] "The objective of this work was to gain a better understanding of the influence of Sn on the dispersion of Pt in platinum supported SBA-15 catalysts and thereby on the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity,selectivity to propylene, coking and catalyst stability."
[2] "Despite extensive studies, the role of Sn in a bimetallic catalyst remains elusive and therefore it has been a subject of debate for many years."
[3] "It is evident from TEOM studies that after 220 min on stream the amount of coke formedis almostthreetimeshigher over Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than onits counterpartPt-SBA-15-IW,albeit the former exhibits considerably higher propane conversion, superior selectivity to propylene and stability than the latter."
[4] "However, the nature and activity properties of surface Pt sites in the catalysts are different due to differences in surface roughness (i.e., surface site heterogeneity) of the particles."
[5] "Therefore, in this study we have made an attempt to bring some clarity on the role of Sn."

1. The aim of this research was to explore how tin impacts the dispersion of platinum in SBA-15 supported catalysts, affecting propane dehydrogenation activity, propylene selectivity, coke formation, and catalyst stability.
2. The function of tin in bimetallic catalysts is still uncertain, making it a topic of ongoing debate.
3. Over the Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW catalyst, coke formation nearly triples compared to the Pt-SBA-15-IW catalyst after 220 minutes of operation, despite the former having higher propane conversion, better propylene selectivity, and greater stability.
4. The surface properties of platinum sites in the catalysts differ because of variations in surface roughness among the particles.
5. This study sought to shed light on the role of tin.

1. 本研究的目标是探索锡如何影响SBA-15支持催化剂中铂的分散，影响丙烷脱氢活性、丙烯选择性、焦炭形成和催化剂稳定性。
2. 锡在双金属催化剂中的作用仍不明确，因此这是一个长期争论的话题。
3. 在运行220分钟后，与Pt-SBA-15-IW催化剂相比，Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW催化剂的焦炭形成量几乎增加三倍，尽管前者的丙烷转化率更高、丙烯选择性更好、稳定性更优。
4. 催化剂中的铂表面性质不同，这是由于粒子表面粗糙度的差异造成的。
5. 本研究尝试揭示锡的作用。
