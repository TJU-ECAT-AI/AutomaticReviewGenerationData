[1] "The objective of this work was to gain a better understanding of the influence of Sn on the dispersion of Pt in platinum supported SBA-15 catalysts and thereby on the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity,selectivity to propylene, coking and catalyst stability."
[2] "It is evident from TEOM studies that after 220 min on stream the amount of coke formedis almostthreetimeshigher over Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than onits counterpartPt-SBA-15-IW,albeit the former exhibits considerably higher propane conversion, superior selectivity to propylene and stability than the latter."
[3] "However, the nature and activity properties of surface Pt sites in the catalysts are different due to differences in surface roughness (i.e., surface site heterogeneity) of the particles."
[4] "Additionally,catalytic properties of Pt sites are influenced by modification of electronic properties of the same sites by Sn in bimetallic PtSn alloy particles (Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW)."
[5] "Therefore, in this study we have made an attempt to bring some clarity on the role of Sn."

1. The primary objective of the research was to explore how tin impacts the dispersion of platinum in SBA-15 catalysts and consequently affects propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance, including activity, propylene selectivity, coke formation, and catalyst stability.

2. The amount of coke produced during PDH over the Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalyst was nearly three times higher than that produced over the Pt-SBA-15 catalyst after 220 minutes of operation, despite the former demonstrating significantly greater propane conversion, higher propylene selectivity, and improved stability.

3. The surface properties of platinum sites in the catalysts differ because of variations in the surface roughness (i.e., surface site heterogeneity) among the particles.

4. The catalytic properties of the platinum sites are altered by the electronic properties of the same sites when they are part of a bimetallic platinum-tin alloy (Pt-Sn-SBA-15).

5. The study aimed to clarify the role of tin in PDH catalysts.

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly depending on the catalyst type and reaction conditions. The study found that the amount of coke formed on the bimetallic Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalyst is nearly three times higher than that on the monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalyst. However, this increased coke formation does not significantly affect the propane conversion or propylene selectivity. The coke formation on the Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalyst is also accompanied by a lower relative loss in reaction rate compared to the monometallic catalyst, despite the higher amount of coke deposited. The study concluded that the bimetallic Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalyst exhibits higher activity and superior selectivity to propylene, demonstrating a combination of electronic and drain-off effects.
