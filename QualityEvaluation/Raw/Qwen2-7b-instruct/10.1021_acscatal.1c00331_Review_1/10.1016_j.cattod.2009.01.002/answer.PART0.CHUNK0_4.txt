<p>The amount of coke deposits after 220 min on stream was measured to be almost three times higher on Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than that on Pt-SBA-15-IW (Fig. 4a).</p>
<p>Despite this, propane conversion (16%) and selectivity to propylene (99%) are virtually unchanged over Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW.</p>
<p>However, the formation of all these by-products is almost negligible on Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW as compared on Pt-SBA-15-IW.</p>
<p>It can be clearly seen from Fig. 5 that despite high amount of coke formation on Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW, the relative loss in reaction rate is much lower while, it is more significant on Pt-SBA-15-IW even though the amount of coke deposition is much lower.</p>
<p>Based on these results it is evident that Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW shows higher activity and much superior selectivity to propylene than that by Pt-SBA-15-IW, in good agreement with numerous previous studies [5,6,1825].</p>

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly depending on the catalyst type and reaction conditions. The study found that the amount of coke formed on the bimetallic Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalyst is nearly three times higher than that on the monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalyst. However, this increased coke formation does not significantly affect the propane conversion or propylene selectivity. The coke formation on the Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalyst is also accompanied by a lower relative loss in reaction rate compared to the monometallic catalyst, despite the higher amount of coke deposited. The study concluded that the bimetallic Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalyst exhibits higher activity and superior selectivity to propylene, demonstrating a combination of electronic and drain-off effects.

催化系统中，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的焦炭沉积物组成，根据催化剂类型和反应条件显著变化。研究发现，双金属Pt-Sn-SBA-15催化剂上的焦炭形成量几乎是单金属Pt-SBA-15催化剂的三倍。然而，这种增加的焦炭形成对丙烷转化率或丙烯选择性的影响并不明显。与单金属催化剂相比，Pt-Sn-SBA-15催化剂上的焦炭形成伴随着更低的相对反应速率损失，尽管焦炭沉积量更高。研究得出结论，双金属Pt-Sn-SBA-15催化剂表现出更高的活性和更优的丙烯选择性，这表明电子和排水效应的组合。
