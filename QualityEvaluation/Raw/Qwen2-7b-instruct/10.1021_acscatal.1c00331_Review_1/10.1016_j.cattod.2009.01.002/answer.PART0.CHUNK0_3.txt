1. The amount of coke deposits was found to be almost three times higher on the Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalyst compared to the Pt-SBA-15 catalyst after 220 minutes of the dehydrogenation process.

2. Despite the higher amount of coke formation, the propane conversion rate and propylene selectivity remained virtually unchanged on the Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalyst.

3. The formation of by-products, such as methane, ethane, and ethylene, was significantly less on the Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalyst compared to the Pt-SBA-15 catalyst.

4. The XRD patterns of the catalysts were used to further validate the coke formation results.

5. An interesting observation noted was the formation of coke during the propane dehydrogenation process.

6. The amount of coke formed on the Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalyst was notably higher than on the Pt-SBA-15 catalyst.

7. The findings provided solid evidence for the formation of a significantly greater amount of coke on the bimetallic Pt-Sn catalyst compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst, without affecting the activity and selectivity.

8. The Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalyst showed higher activity and significantly better selectivity for propylene compared to the Pt-SBA-15 catalyst, aligning with previous studies.

9. It was clear from the study that the amount of coke formed on the Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalyst was much higher than on the Pt-SBA-15 catalyst.
