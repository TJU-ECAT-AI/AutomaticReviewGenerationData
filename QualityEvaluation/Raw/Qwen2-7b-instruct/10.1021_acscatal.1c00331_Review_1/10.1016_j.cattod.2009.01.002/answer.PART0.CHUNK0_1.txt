[1] "The objective of this work was to gain a better understanding of the influence of Sn on the dispersion of Pt in platinum supported SBA-15 catalysts and thereby on the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity,selectivity to propylene, coking and catalyst stability."
[2] "It is evident from TEOM studies that after 220 min on stream the amount of coke formedis almostthreetimeshigher over Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IWthan onits counterpartPt-SBA-15-IW,albeit the former exhibits considerably higher propane conversion, superior selectivity to propylene and stability than the latter."
[3] "Despite this, propane conversion (16%) and selectivity to propylene (99%) are virtually unchanged over Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW."
[4] "However, it is also evident from this study that the amount of coke formed over Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW is much higher than that on Pt-SBA-15-IW."
[5] "Therefore, despite higher amountofcokeformation on Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW,itstill exhibits much higher selectivity to propylene and catalyst stability than its counter part Pt-SBA-15-IW,which cannot be explained by the effect of the size of Pt particles."
[6] "Consequently, Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW shows higher propane conversion and higher amount of coke formation compared to Pt-SBA-15-IW which contains larger Pt particles."

1. The aim of the research was to explore how tin (Sn) affects the dispersion of platinum (Pt) in SBA-15 supported catalysts, impacting the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), selectivity to propylene, coke formation, and catalyst stability.

2. It was found that after 220 minutes of operation, the coke formation on the Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW catalyst was nearly three times greater than on the Pt-SBA-15-IW catalyst, even though the former showed higher propane conversion, better propylene selectivity, and stability.

3. Despite the higher coke formation, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity remained essentially the same on the Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW catalyst.

4. The study revealed that the amount of coke formed on the Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW catalyst was significantly higher than on the Pt-SBA-15-IW catalyst.

5. Despite the higher coke formation, the Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW catalyst maintained a much higher selectivity to propylene and better stability than the Pt-SBA-15-IW catalyst, an observation not explained solely by the size of the Pt particles.

6. The Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW catalyst exhibited higher propane conversion and coke formation compared to the Pt-SBA-15-IW catalyst, which contained larger Pt particles.

1. 研究的主要目标是了解锡（Sn）如何影响SBA-15支持催化剂中铂（Pt）的分散，从而影响丙烷脱氢（DHP）、丙烯选择性、焦炭形成和催化剂稳定性。

2. 实验结果表明，在220分钟后，Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW催化剂上的焦炭生成量几乎是Pt-SBA-15-IW催化剂的三倍，尽管前者的丙烷转化率更高，丙烯选择性更好，且稳定性更强。

3. 尽管焦炭生成量较高，但丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性在Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW催化剂上保持基本不变。

4. 研究发现，Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW催化剂上形成的焦炭量显著高于Pt-SBA-15-IW催化剂。

5. 尽管形成了更多的焦炭，但Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW催化剂仍保持了比Pt-SBA-15-IW催化剂更高的丙烯选择性和更好的稳定性，这一观察结果不能仅归因于Pt颗粒的大小。

6. Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW催化剂在丙烷转化率和焦炭形成方面比Pt-SBA-15-IW催化剂高，后者含有较大的Pt颗粒。
