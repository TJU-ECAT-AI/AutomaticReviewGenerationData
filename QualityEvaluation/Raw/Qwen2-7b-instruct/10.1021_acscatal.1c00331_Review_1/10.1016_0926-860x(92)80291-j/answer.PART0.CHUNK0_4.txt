The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, especially in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly depending on different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques such as gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and thermogravimetric analysis have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. These methods allow researchers to identify and quantify various components within coke deposits, providing insights into their structure and origin.
