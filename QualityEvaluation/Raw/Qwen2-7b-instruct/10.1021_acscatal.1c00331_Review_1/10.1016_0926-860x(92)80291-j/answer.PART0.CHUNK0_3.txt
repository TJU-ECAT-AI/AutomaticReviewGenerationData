The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, especially in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly based on reaction conditions and catalyst types. Analytical techniques utilized to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents include methods such as chromatography, spectroscopy, and microscopy. These tools allow researchers to identify and quantify different components within coke deposits, providing insights into its structure and evolution under various operating conditions. Additionally, the role of acid sites in the formation of coke and their interaction with reactants, such as aromatics, alkenes, and methanol, plays a crucial part in understanding the chemical processes involved in coke deposition. The specific analytical techniques and their application in studying coke formation and removal in PDH and other processes are discussed in detail within the literature.
