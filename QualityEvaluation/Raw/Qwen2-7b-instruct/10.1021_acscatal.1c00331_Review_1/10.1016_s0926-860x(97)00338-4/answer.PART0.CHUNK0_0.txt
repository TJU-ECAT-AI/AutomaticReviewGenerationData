<p>The origin of this behavior appears to be related to the formation of coke on the catalyst in the absence of hydrogen. The TEM results showed that little, if any, particle agglo- meration occurs during the reaction at 798 K in the absence of hydrogen.</p>
<p>However, TPO results shown in Fig. 9 and Table 4 indicate higher levels of coke after reaction in the absence of hydrogen at 798 K compared to reaction in the presence of hydrogen at 873 K.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The absence of hydrogen leads to the formation of coke on the catalyst, causing deactivation. This phenomenon is evident from the increased coke levels observed in the TPO results after reaction at 798 K in the absence of hydrogen, compared to reactions at 873 K in the presence of hydrogen.

在没有氢的情况下，催化剂上会形成焦炭，导致失活。从TPO结果中可以看出，在798 K下无氢反应后产生的焦炭量高于873 K下有氢反应时的焦炭量。
