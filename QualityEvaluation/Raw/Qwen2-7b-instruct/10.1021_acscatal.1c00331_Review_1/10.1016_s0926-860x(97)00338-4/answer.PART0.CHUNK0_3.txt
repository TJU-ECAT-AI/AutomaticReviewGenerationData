[1] "Increasing the amount of Sn in the catalyst decreases the amount of carbon deposited under these reaction conditions."
[2] "The addition of potassium to silica-supported Pt/Sn produces a highly selective isobutane dehydrogenation catalyst."
[3] "In the absence of hydrogen, the Pt/K-L catalyst deactivates to essentially zero activity within several minutes on-stream. Carbonaceous deposits block the pores and limit access to the active sites."

1. Adding tin to the catalyst reduces the amount of carbon deposited under specific reaction conditions.
2. Incorporating potassium into silica-supported platinum/tin catalysts enhances their selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation.
3. Without hydrogen, the Pt/K-L catalyst loses almost all activity within minutes due to carbon deposits blocking the pores and hindering access to active sites.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 在特定反应条件下，增加锡的含量会减少催化剂上沉积的碳量。
2. 将钾添加到二氧化硅支持的铂/锡催化剂中可以显著提高它们的异丁烷脱氢选择性。
3. 缺乏氢气时，Pt/K-L催化剂在几分钟内几乎完全失去活性，因为碳沉积物阻塞了孔道并限制了对活性位点的访问。
