<p>The origin of this behavior appears to be related to the formation of coke on the catalyst in the absence of hydrogen. The TEM results showed that little, if any, particle agglo- meration occurs during the reaction at 798 K in the absence of hydrogen.</p>
<p>However, TPO results shown in Fig. 9 and Table 4 indicate higher levels of coke after reaction in the absence of hydrogen at 798 K compared to reaction in the presence of hydrogen at 873 K.</p>
</quotes>

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems varies significantly depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature demonstrates that adding tin (Sn) and potassium (K) to Pt catalysts enhances their resistance to coke formation during propane dehydrogenation reactions at 873 K in the presence of hydrogen. The coke content leads to a higher percentage of sites being blocked for CO adsorption on the Pt/K-L catalyst compared to the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts. Without these additives, the Pt/K-L catalyst loses its activity almost completely within a few minutes in the absence of hydrogen, due to the formation of coke. The tin and potassium additives effectively transport coke from active sites to the support, reducing the size of the Pt surface ensembles and inhibiting hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coking reactions. This behavior explains why the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts maintain their deactivation profiles similarly with and without hydrogen, indicating that tin is sufficient to prevent the formation of coke on the surface, leading to the formation of undesirable by-products.

催化系统中的焦炭沉积物的组成在反应条件和催化剂类型上存在显著差异。文献表明，在873 K的氢气存在下进行丙烷脱氢反应时，添加锡（Sn）和钾（K）到铂（Pt）催化剂可以增强它们抵抗焦炭形成的抵抗力。焦炭含量导致Pt/K-L催化剂上的CO吸附位点被更高比例阻塞，与Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂相比。没有这些添加剂，Pt/K-L催化剂在没有氢气的情况下会迅速失去活性，仅在几分钟内达到几乎零活性，这是由于焦炭的形成。锡和钾添加剂有效地将焦炭从活性位点转移到支撑材料，减少Pt表面团簇的大小，并抑制氢化、异构化和焦炭生成反应。这种行为解释了为什么Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂在有无氢气时保持其失活曲线相似的原因，这说明锡足以防止表面形成焦炭，从而产生不希望的副产品。
