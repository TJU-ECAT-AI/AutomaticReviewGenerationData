<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts undergo deactivation due to coke formation, surface enrichment with tin, and/or metal particle sintering.

2. Without hydrogen, the pores of Pt/K-L zeolite get clogged with carbon deposits during isobutane dehydrogenation at 798 K.

3. Adding potassium to silica-supported Pt/Sn catalysts creates a highly selective catalyst for isobutane dehydrogenation.

4. At 873 K and with hydrogen, Pt/Sn/K/silica catalysts produce significantly less isobutene compared to Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts.

5. At 798 K without hydrogen, adding tin and potassium to supported Pt catalysts enhances their resistance to coke formation.

1. 在873 K下，有氢气的情况下，Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂由于焦炭形成、表面锡含量增加和/或金属颗粒烧结而发生失活。

2. 没有氢气，Pt/K-L沸石在798 K下的孔被碳沉积物堵塞，进行异丁烷脱氢反应。

3. 将钾添加到二氧化硅支持的Pt/Sn催化剂中会产生一种高度选择性的异丁烷脱氢催化剂。

4. 在873 K下，有氢气时，Pt/Sn/K/silica催化剂产生的异丁烯量远少于Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂。

5. 在798 K下没有氢气时，将锡和钾添加到支持的Pt催化剂中可以增强它们对焦炭形成的抵抗力。
