1. Sn might assist in transporting coke from the active sites to the support in catalytic systems.
2. Without hydrogen, the pores of Pt/K-L-zeolite get blocked by carbon deposits during isobutane dehydrogenation at 798 K.
3. Potassium addition to silica-supported Pt/Sn creates a highly selective isobutane dehydrogenation catalyst.
4. At 873 K and with hydrogen, Pt/Sn/K/silica catalysts show notably lower isobutene production rates compared to Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts.
5. At 798 K without hydrogen, adding Sn and K to Pt catalysts enhances their resistance against coking.

1.Sn可能帮助将焦炭从活性位点运输到载体。
2.在没有氢的情况下，798 K时Pt/K-L沸石的孔隙会被异丁烷脱氢反应产生的碳沉积物堵塞。
3.向二氧化硅支持的Pt/Sn中添加钾产生一种高度选择性的异丁烷脱氢催化剂。
4.在873 K和氢气存在下，Pt/Sn/K/二氧化硅催化剂的异丁烯生产速率显著低于Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂。
5.在798 K且无氢的情况下，向Pt催化剂中添加Sn和K可以增强其对结焦的抵抗力。
