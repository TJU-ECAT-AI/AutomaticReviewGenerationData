<p>Upon exposure of the freshly reduced 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst to the C3H8/Ar flow at 923 K, the outlet stream contained C3H6, H2, CH4, and unreacted C3H8. Transient responses (Fig. 1a) exhibited an initial unselective period of methane and hydrogen generation lasting 1 min, which was followed by a sharp decline in CH4 generation and a gradual increase in selectivity toward C3H6.</p>
<p>In one set of experiments, the temperature was linearly raised to 923 K at a rate of 5 K/min, while flowing O2. CO2 evolved in two distinct peaks with maximums at 646 and 797 K (Fig. 1b).</p>
<p>The nanostructure of coked Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst is shown on HRTEM images in Fig. 2. Three morphological features are clearly distinguished. Firstly, the underlying support appears as platelets with pronounced crystallinity, which is ascribed to distorted cubic MgO [27] (Fig. 2a). Secondly, individual Pt nanoparticles of various sizes are visible as highly crystalline, dark, globular features (Fig. 2a and b).</p>
<p>The present results complement the studies by Peng et al. [27] and Wu et al. [28] by examining coking behavior at very early as well as more mature stages of the dehydrogenation process. Very early stages of coking were characterized by TAP pulse-response experiments which elucidated the C3H8 interaction with the freshly reduced catalyst on a much shorter (<1 s) timescale and with better control over the amount of coke deposited per pulse than in conventional flow experiments.</p>
<p>When the delay between sequential pulse sequences was longer than a few seconds, the first several pulses of the resumed sequence demonstrated increased C3H8 consumption and extra-stoichiometric H2 release in comparison with the last pulses of the preceding interrupted sequence. This suggests that previously blocked Pt sites responsible for unselective reactions were spontaneously uncovered or otherwise regenerated during the inter-sequence pause.</p>
<p>Ex situ Raman spectra of the fresh, coked, and partially regenerated samples were performed on a RXN1 Raman spectrometer (Kaiser Optical Systems) fitted with a 532 nm laser operating at 40 mW and a 5 m optical probe. The spectrum corresponding to the coked sample exhibits two intense peaks at 1340 and 1600 cm1 which can be attributed to the characteristic D- and G-bands of graphene [55], respectively.</p>
<p>Carbon deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homogeneous and consist primarily of graphene, yet their oxidation is a complicated process involving both chemical reactions and transport processes on the support surface. The involvement of surface transport can explain the presence of two CO2 peaks that are often observed during TPO experiments with coked metal catalysts.</p>

1. The transient responses showed an initial unselective period of methane and hydrogen generation followed by a decline in methane generation and an increase in selectivity towards propylene.

2. Two distinct CO2 peaks evolved from the catalyst upon heating, indicating the presence of coke on both metal sites and the support.

3. The coked catalyst showed three morphological features: distorted cubic MgO platelets, Pt nanoparticles, and graphene sheets.

4. TAP pulse-response experiments provided insight into the early stages of coking by elucidating the interaction of propane with the catalyst on a shorter timescale.

5. Unblocked Pt sites responsible for unselective reactions were spontaneously uncovered during the inter-pulse delays in TAP experiments.

6. Raman spectra confirmed the presence of graphene in the coke deposits.

7. The oxidation of coke deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts is a complex process involving chemical reactions and transport processes on the support surface, which can explain the presence of multiple CO2 peaks during TPO experiments.
