1. During the annealing of ethylene-covered Pt surface, ethylene was first dehydrogenated into ethylidyne, which then decomposed into C1 fragments that migrated towards coke nucleation sites and were incorporated into growing graphene islands.

2. The behavior of coking on industrially-relevant supported catalysts differs from that on structurally simple single crystals, but the overall sequence of steps is expected to be similar.

3. The atomic details of the surface-mediated mechanism of graphene nucleation on small nm-sized particles remain largely unknown.

4. This study characterizes the initial stages of carbon deposition and burning to elucidate the mobility of surface species in more detail.

5. The surface of the nanoparticles is constantly in a state of atomic flux under reaction conditions.

6. The amount of uncovered Pt sites increases nonlinearly with delay and approaches a limit.

7. The presence of a shoulder peak and the behavior of CO2 during TAP experiments were consistently reproducible.

8. The morphology of mature carbon deposits corresponds to extended graphene sheets originating on small Pt nanoparticles and continuously shifting onto the support surface.

9. Graphene formed on larger Pt nanoparticles does not shift onto the support but forms encapsulating graphitic layers, in agreement with previous studies.

10. Partial oxidation can remove most of the coke deposits blocking the active sites on small nanoparticles, restoring a significant portion of the initial catalytic activity.

11. The complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in catalytic systems can be elucidated through time-resolved kinetic characterization using small perturbations like TAP.

12. Analytical techniques such as TAP, TPO, Raman spectroscopy, and TEM have been employed to study the complex nature of coke deposits in catalytic systems.
