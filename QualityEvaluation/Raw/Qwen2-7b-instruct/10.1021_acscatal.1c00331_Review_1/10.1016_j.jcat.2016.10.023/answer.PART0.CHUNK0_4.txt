<p>Upon exposure of the freshly reduced 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst to the C3H8/Ar flow at 923 K, the outlet stream contained C3H6, H2, CH4, and unreacted C3H8. Transient responses (Fig. 1a) exhibited an initial unselective period of methane and hydrogen generation lasting 1 min, which was followed by a sharp decline in CH4 generation and a gradual increase in selectivity toward C3H6.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the CO2 that was pre-adsorbed on the catalyst from the air was completely removed during the high-temperature reductive pretreatment, and all CO2 evolving from the catalyst dur- ing TPO was ascribed to the oxidation of carbon deposits. After TPO, the catalyst was reduced in H2 at 923 K, and another C3H8 treatment was performed to determine whether the catalytic activity was restored by the TPO/reduction cycle. The resulting transients (Fig. 1c) demonstrated that the activity and the charac- teristic selectivity pattern of the fresh catalyst were indeed mostly restored by the regeneration. In another set of experiments, the temperature ramp was stopped at 700 K, after the evolution of the first CO2 peak, but before the start of the second peak (Fig. 1d). The subsequent C3H8 treatment produced the transients depicted in Fig. 1e, which indicate that a significant portion of the catalytic activity and the selectivity patterns were restored even by the incomplete TPO treatment.</p>
<p>The nanostructure of coked Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst is shown on HRTEM images in Fig. 2. Three morphological features are clearly distinguished. Firstly, the underlying support appears as platelets with pronounced crystallinity, which is ascribed to distorted cubic MgO [27] (Fig. 2a). Secondly, individual Pt nanoparticles of various sizes are visible as highly crystalline, dark, globular features (Fig. 2a and b).</p>
<p>Low-coordinated Pt sites, such as corners, edges, and kinks, are very active in CAC scission. But these sites also bind deeply dehy- drogenated carbonaceous species stronger than the highly- coordinated Pt sites typically found on terraces. Therefore, these low-coordinated sites are most probably poisoned first, increasing C3H6 selectivity. As the coke deposits grow, the average size of exposed Pt ensembles on the atomic steps and terraces must also decrease, further hindering unselective CAC scission.</p>
<p>Very early stages of coking were characterized by TAP pulse-response experiments which elucidated the C3H8 interaction with the freshly reduced catalyst on a much shorter (<1 s) timescale and with better control over the amount of coke deposited per pulse than in conventional flow experiments. TAP experiments repro- duced the selectivity behavior during the onset of coking, i.e. the extinction of methane generation and the increase in propylene production (Fig. 5ad). The pulse-wise gradual coking of Pt sites in TAP experiments is analogous to the kinetic studies by Menon et al. [59] and Shum et al. [60] in which Pt sites were gradually poisoned by sulfur, leading to the hindrance of hydrogenolysis and selectivity enhancements.</p>
<p>When the delay between sequential pulse sequences was longer than a few seconds, the first several pulses of the resumed sequence demonstrated increased C3H8 consumption and extra-stoichiometric H2 release in compar- ison with the last pulses of the preceding interrupted sequence. This suggests that previously blocked Pt sites responsible for unselective reactions were spontaneously uncovered or otherwise regenerated during the inter-sequence pause.</p>
<p>Temperature-resolved oxidation of coked catalysts provided additional insights into the differentiation of carbonaceous depos- its resulting from their different locations on the catalyst surface. Two well-separated CO2 peaks centered at 650 K and 800 K were observed in TPO experiments (Fig. 1b). Despite substantial morphology deformations, coke deposits on Mg(Al)Ox-supported materials are exclusively graphene-like due to the mildly basic nat- ure of Mg(Al)Ox which precludes the formation of coke via propy- lene oligomerization.</p>
<p>Based on our data alone, we could not unambiguously distinguish between the surface mobility of activated oxygen spe- cies or Pt nanoparticles as sources of the observed behavior.</p>

1. The initial transient responses of the outlet stream showed a period of methane and hydrogen generation, followed by a decline in methane generation and an increase in selectivity towards propylene.
2. After the high-temperature reductive pretreatment, all pre-adsorbed CO2 was removed, and the CO2 evolved during TPO was attributed to the oxidation of carbon deposits. The activity and selectivity pattern of the catalyst were restored by the TPO/reduction cycle.
3. HRTEM images revealed platelet-like MgO support and Pt nanoparticles of varying sizes.
4. Low-coordinated Pt sites were more prone to poisoning by deeply dehydrogenated carbonaceous species, leading to an increase in C3H6 selectivity.
5. TAP pulse-response experiments captured the early stages of coke formation, reproducing the selectivity behavior during the onset of coking.
6. Increased C3H8 consumption and extra-stoichiometric H2 release during the resumed sequence suggested spontaneous uncovering or regeneration of previously blocked Pt sites.
7. The differentiation of carbon deposits was influenced by their location on the catalyst surface, with two CO2 peaks observed in TPO experiments.
8. The observed behavior could not be definitively attributed to the surface mobility of activated oxygen species or Pt nanoparticles.
