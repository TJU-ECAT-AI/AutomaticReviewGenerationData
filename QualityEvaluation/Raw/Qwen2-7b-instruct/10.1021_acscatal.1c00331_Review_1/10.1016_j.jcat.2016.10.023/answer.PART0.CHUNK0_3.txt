[1] "Coke deposition was characterized on a 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox dehy- drogenation catalyst upon its exposure to C3H8 at 923 K in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments and low-pressure tran- sient TAP experiments."
[2] "In agreement with the literature, these experiments suggest that non-selective Pt sites that are responsi- ble for hydrogenolysis and decomposition of propane are partially blocked during the initial stages of coke formation, leading to the increase in selectivity toward propylene."
[3] "Time-resolved TAP experiments with a variable time delay between successive sequences of C3H8 pulses revealed that the most active non-selective Pt sites deactivated by C3H8 are spontaneously uncovered in vacuum within minutes."
[4] "DFT calculations support the assignment of these observations to a combination of (i) C3-to-C1 conversion followed by the migration of coke precursors from dehydrogenation sites toward the sites of graphene assembly and (ii) restructuring of Pt nanoparticles under the influence of carbon deposits, which leads to the formation of new Pt sites."
[5] "According to TEM, the morphology of mature carbonaceous deposits obtained in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments corresponds to extended graphene sheets which originate on small (1.52 nm) Pt nanoparticles and continuously shift onto the sup- port."
[6] "On the support surface, thin graphene sheets undergo severe deformations and form disordered layers and entangled spaghetti- like bundles, possibly also containing carbon nanotubes."
[7] "Most of the coke deposits blocking the active sites on small nanoparticles can be removed and a signif- icant portion of the initial catalytic activity can be restored by par- tial oxidation at relatively mild conditions (up to 700 K), without burning off all of the carbon deposits from larger particles and support."
[8] "Carbon deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homo- geneous and consist primarily of graphene, yet their oxidation is a complicated process involving both chemical reactions and trans- port processes on the support surface."
[9] "The involvement of surface transport can explain the presence of two CO2 peaks that are often observed during TPO experiments with coked metal catalysts."

1. Coke deposition was characterized on a 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox dehydrogenation catalyst upon its exposure to propane at 923 K in both atmospheric-pressure flow experiments and low-pressure transient TAP experiments.
2. Non-selective Pt sites responsible for propane hydrogenolysis and decomposition are partially blocked during the initial stages of coke formation, resulting in an increased selectivity towards propylene.
3. Time-resolved TAP experiments showed that the most active non-selective Pt sites deactivated by propane are spontaneously uncovered in vacuum within minutes.
4. DFT calculations support the observations that the uncovering of Pt sites is due to a combination of C3-to-C1 conversion, migration of coke precursors towards graphene assembly sites, and restructuring of Pt nanoparticles influenced by carbon deposits.
5. Mature carbonaceous deposits in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments are in the form of extended graphene sheets originating from small Pt nanoparticles and shifting onto the support.
6. Thin graphene sheets on the support surface undergo severe deformation and form disordered layers and entangled bundles, possibly containing carbon nanotubes.
7. A significant portion of the initial catalytic activity can be restored by partial oxidation at mild conditions (up to 700 K) without removing all carbon deposits from larger particles and support.
8. Carbon deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homogeneous and mainly consist of graphene, but their oxidation is a complex process involving chemical reactions and surface transport on the support.
9. The presence of two CO2 peaks during TPO experiments with coked metal catalysts can be explained by the involvement of surface transport processes.

1. 在923 K下，通过大气压力流动实验和低压力瞬态TAP实验对0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox脱氢催化剂上的焦油沉积进行了表征。
2. 非选择性Pt位点负责丙烷的氢解和分解，在焦油形成初期部分被阻塞，导致丙烯的选择性增加。
3. 时间分辨TAP实验表明，由丙烷活化的最活跃非选择性Pt位点在真空条件下几分钟内自发暴露。
4. DFT计算支持以下观点：焦油位点的暴露是由于C3到C1的转换、焦油前体向石墨烯组装位点迁移以及Pt纳米颗粒在碳沉积影响下的表面重构。
5. 大气压力流动实验中成熟的碳沉积物表现为从小Pt纳米颗粒起源并转移到支撑物的延伸石墨烯片。
6. 支撑表面上薄的石墨烯片经历了严重的变形，形成了无序层和缠结的线状结构，可能包含碳纳米管。
7. 在温和条件（最高700 K）下进行的部分氧化可以恢复初始催化活性，而无需从较大颗粒和支持物上移除所有碳沉积物。
8. Pt/Mg(Al)Ox催化剂上的碳沉积物在化学上是均一的，主要由石墨烯组成，但它们的氧化是一个涉及表面传输过程的复杂过程。
9. TPO实验中焦油金属催化剂上的两个CO2峰的存在可以通过表面传输过程的参与来解释。
