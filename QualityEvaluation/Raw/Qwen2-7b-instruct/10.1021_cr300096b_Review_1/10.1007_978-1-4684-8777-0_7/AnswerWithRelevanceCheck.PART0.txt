          Interaction of Atoms and Molecules with Solid Surfaces emphasizes the importance of maintaining surface cleanliness in experiments. Techniques such as heating the sample and ion bombardment are used to clean the surface within an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber. The presence of impurities can lead to misleading results, particularly in low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) experiments, which are highly sensitive to surface cleanliness. Precise data can only be obtained from surfaces that are initially well-defined.

          The essential elements for conducting surface experiments, including Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), consist of an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber, an electron gun, a crystal holder, and means to observe diffracted electrons. A critical challenge is maintaining the surface cleanliness, which is typically addressed through various cleaning techniques within the UHV chamber, such as heating the sample and ion bombardment. Detecting impurities on the surface, often through Auger signals from adsorbed atoms, is another crucial step. Working on clean surfaces enables the collection of high-precision structural information.
