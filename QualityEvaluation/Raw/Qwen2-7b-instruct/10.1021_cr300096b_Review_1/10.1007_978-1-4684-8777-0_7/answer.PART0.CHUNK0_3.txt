[1] "The major difficulty is common to all surface experiments, namely, to keep the surface clean."
[2] "The UHV chamber will normally contain an array of techniques for cleaning the surface (provision for heating the sample, ion bombardment) as well as some means of detecting impurities at the surface, usually by detection of Auger signals from adsorbed atoms."
[3] "Experiments conducted on clean, perfect, surfaces can produce a large amount of structural information of high precision."

The essential elements for conducting surface experiments, including Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), consist of an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber, an electron gun, a crystal holder, and means to observe diffracted electrons. A critical challenge is maintaining the surface cleanliness, which is typically addressed through various cleaning techniques within the UHV chamber, such as heating the sample and ion bombardment. Detecting impurities on the surface, often through Auger signals from adsorbed atoms, is another crucial step. Working on clean surfaces enables the collection of high-precision structural information.
