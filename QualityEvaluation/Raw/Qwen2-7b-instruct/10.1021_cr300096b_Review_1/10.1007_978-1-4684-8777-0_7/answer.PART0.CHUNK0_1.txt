The essential elements for conducting surface experiments, such as low-energy electron diffraction, involve an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber to maintain surface cleanliness, an electron gun for producing a collimated beam of electrons within an energy range of 0 to 500 eV, a crystal holder and manipulator, and a method to observe the diffracted electrons, typically through a fluorescent screen. A significant challenge in these experiments is ensuring the surface remains clean. Utilizing an UHV chamber often incorporates techniques for cleaning the surface, such as heating the sample or ion bombardment, alongside mechanisms to detect surface impurities through Auger signal detection. Conducting experiments on clean, pristine surfaces yields substantial structural information with high accuracy.

进行表面实验的关键元素包括超高真空（UHV）室以保持表面清洁，电子枪用于在0至500电子伏特的能量范围内产生准直化的电子束，晶体持物器和操纵装置，以及观察散射电子的方法，通常通过荧光屏。这些实验的主要挑战之一是确保表面保持清洁。通常在UHV室中会包含一些技术来清洁表面，如加热样品或离子轰击，同时还有检测表面杂质的机制，通常是通过吸附原子的Auger信号检测。在清洁、完美的表面上进行的实验可以产生大量高精度的结构信息。
