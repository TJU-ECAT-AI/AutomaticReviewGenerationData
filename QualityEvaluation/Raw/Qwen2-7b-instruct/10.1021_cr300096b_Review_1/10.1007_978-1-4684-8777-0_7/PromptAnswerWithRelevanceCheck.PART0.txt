<p>The major difficulty is common to all surface experiments, namely, to keep the surface clean. The UHV chamber will normally contain an array of techniques for cleaning the surface (provision for heating the sample, ion bombardment) as well as some means of detecting impurities at the surface, usually by detection of Auger signals from adsorbed atoms. LEED is very sensitive to cleanliness of the surface and small amounts of contaminant can produce quite spurious results.</p>
<p>Experiments conducted on clean, perfect, surfaces can produce a large amount of structural information of high precision.</p>
<p>Obviously it is only possible to produce precise data for surfaces which are well defined in the first place.</p>

Interaction of Atoms and Molecules with Solid Surfaces emphasizes the importance of maintaining surface cleanliness in experiments. Techniques such as heating the sample and ion bombardment are used to clean the surface within an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber. The presence of impurities can lead to misleading results, particularly in low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) experiments, which are highly sensitive to surface cleanliness. Precise data can only be obtained from surfaces that are initially well-defined.

The essential elements for conducting surface experiments, such as low-energy electron diffraction, involve an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber to maintain surface cleanliness, an electron gun for producing a collimated beam of electrons within an energy range of 0 to 500 eV, a crystal holder and manipulator, and a method to observe the diffracted electrons, typically through a fluorescent screen. A significant challenge in these experiments is ensuring the surface remains clean. Utilizing an UHV chamber often incorporates techniques for cleaning the surface, such as heating the sample or ion bombardment, alongside mechanisms to detect surface impurities through Auger signal detection. Conducting experiments on clean, pristine surfaces yields substantial structural information with high accuracy.

The low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) technique is highly sensitive to the cleanliness of the surface. To ensure accurate and precise data, experiments are conducted on surfaces that are meticulously cleaned within an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber. The chamber contains various methods for cleaning the surface, such as heating the sample and ion bombardment. Impurities are detected through the analysis of Auger signals from adsorbed atoms. Conducting experiments on clean surfaces allows for the acquisition of substantial structural information with high precision. It is crucial that the surface is well-defined before precise data can be obtained.
