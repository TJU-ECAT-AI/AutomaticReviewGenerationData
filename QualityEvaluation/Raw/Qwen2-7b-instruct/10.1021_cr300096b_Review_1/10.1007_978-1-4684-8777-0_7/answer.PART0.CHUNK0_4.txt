[1] "The major difficulty is common to all surface experiments, namely, to keep the surface clean."
[2] "The UHV chamber will normally contain an array of techniques for cleaning the surface (provision for heating the sample, ion bombardment) as well as some means of detecting impurities at the surface, usually by detection of Auger signals from adsorbed atoms."
[3] "LEED is very sensitive to cleanliness of the surface and small amounts of contaminant can produce quite spurious results."
[4] "Experiments conducted on clean, perfect, surfaces can produce a large amount of structural information of high precision."
[5] "Obviously it is only possible to produce precise data for surfaces which are well defined in the first place."

The low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) technique is highly sensitive to the cleanliness of the surface. To ensure accurate and precise data, experiments are conducted on surfaces that are meticulously cleaned within an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber. The chamber contains various methods for cleaning the surface, such as heating the sample and ion bombardment. Impurities are detected through the analysis of Auger signals from adsorbed atoms. Conducting experiments on clean surfaces allows for the acquisition of substantial structural information with high precision. It is crucial that the surface is well-defined before precise data can be obtained.

低能电子衍射（LEED）技术对表面清洁度非常敏感。为了确保准确和精确的数据，实验在超真空（UHV）室中进行，该室包含一系列用于清洁表面的方法，如加热样品和离子轰击。通过分析吸附原子产生的阿格尔信号来检测杂质。在干净的表面上进行实验可以获取大量高精度的结构信息。在获得精确数据之前，必须首先定义好表面。
