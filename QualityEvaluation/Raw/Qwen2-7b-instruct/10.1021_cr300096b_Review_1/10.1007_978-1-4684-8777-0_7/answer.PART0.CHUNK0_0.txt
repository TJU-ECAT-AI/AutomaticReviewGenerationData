<p>The major difficulty is common to all surface experiments, namely, to keep the surface clean. The UHV chamber will normally contain an array of techniques for cleaning the surface (provision for heating the sample, ion bombardment) as well as some means of detecting impurities at the surface, usually by detection of Auger signals from adsorbed atoms. LEED is very sensitive to cleanliness of the surface and small amounts of contaminant can produce quite spurious results.</p>
<p>Experiments conducted on clean, perfect, surfaces can produce a large amount of structural information of high precision.</p>
<p>Obviously it is only possible to produce precise data for surfaces which are well defined in the first place.</p>

Interaction of Atoms and Molecules with Solid Surfaces emphasizes the importance of maintaining surface cleanliness in experiments. Techniques such as heating the sample and ion bombardment are used to clean the surface within an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber. The presence of impurities can lead to misleading results, particularly in low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) experiments, which are highly sensitive to surface cleanliness. Precise data can only be obtained from surfaces that are initially well-defined.

《原子和分子与固体表面相互作用》强调了在实验中保持表面清洁的重要性。在超高真空（UHV）室中使用技术如加热样品和离子轰击来清洁表面。表面杂质的存在可能导致误导性的结果，尤其是在低能电子衍射（LEED）实验中，这些实验对表面清洁度极其敏感。只有初始定义良好的表面才能获得精确的数据。
