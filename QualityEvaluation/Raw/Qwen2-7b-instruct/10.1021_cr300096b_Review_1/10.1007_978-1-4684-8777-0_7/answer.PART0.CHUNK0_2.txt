<p>The major difficulty is common to all surface experiments, namely, to keep the surface clean. The UHV chamber will normally contain an array of techniques for cleaning the surface (provision for heating the sample, ion bombardment) as well as some means of detecting impurities at the surface, usually by detection of Auger signals from adsorbed atoms. LEED is very sensitive to cleanliness of the surface and small amounts of contaminant can produce quite spurious results.</p>
<p>Experiments conducted on clean, perfect, surfaces can produce a large amount of structural information of high precision.</p>
<p>Obviously it is only possible to produce precise data for surfaces which are well defined in the first place.</p>

The interaction of atoms and molecules with solid surfaces involves maintaining a clean surface through techniques like heating the sample and ion bombardment. Leptons Electron Energy Diffraction (LEED) is highly sensitive to surface cleanliness, and even small contaminants can lead to misleading results. Precise data can only be obtained from surfaces that are well-defined initially.

原子和分子与固体表面的相互作用涉及通过加热样品和离子轰击等方法保持表面清洁。电子能量衍射（LEED）对表面清洁度非常敏感，即使是少量的污染物也可能导致误导性的结果。只能从一开始就定义明确的表面获得精确的数据。
