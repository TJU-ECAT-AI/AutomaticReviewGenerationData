2.1. Preparation of Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces
The amount of Ni deposition was primarily characterized by the Ni(LMM)/Pt(237 eV) AES ratio. Our earlier designation of the 1 ML Ni/Pt surface was based on the assumption of layer-by-layer growth for Ni and determination of the coverage where the Pt AES intensity was attenuated to 66% of its initial value [14] . This coincidentally occurred at a Ni/Pt AES ratio of 1.0. This will be the characteristic AES ratio of a surface which we refer to as a 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface. The accuracy of this designation is discussed in more detail in a later section. The surfaces prepared are further categorized in terms of the thermal history of the sample during deposition. Thus, a surface prepared by deposition on a sample at room temperature with a Ni/Pt AES ratio near unity will be referred to as 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K; one prepared by deposition at 600 K to the same AES ratio is designated 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 600 K. Surfaces prepared by deposition at room temperature and subsequent annealing to near 600 K for an amount of time, equivalent to the deposition time with a Ni/Pt AES ratio near unity after annealing, are referred to as 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K/600 K.
2.2. Temperature programmed desorption
Fig. 1a shows H2 TPD spectra from a clean Pt(1 1 1) surface, a 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 600 K surface, and a thick Ni film (>5 ML) on Pt(1 1 1) 600 K surface, after saturation exposures (50 L) to H2 at 120 K. H2 desorbs from the 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 600 K surface at temperatures lower than those on either the clean Pt(1 1 1) surface or the thick Ni film.

(b) Temperature programmed desorption of a saturation exposure of H2 on 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 600 K, 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K/600 K, and 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K.
Since the dissociative adsorption of H2 on Ni(1 1 1) and Pt(1 1 1) is not an activated process [15] , the desorption temperature of H2 from these surfaces should, in principle, be related to the respective metalH bond strengths. The barrier for desorption in this case is identical to the heat of dissociative adsorption of H2, and is equal to the gas-phase dissociation energy (calculated by DFT in this work as 4.545 eV, literature 4.522 eV [16] ) minus twice the metalH bond strength. H2 desorbs from Pt(1 1 1) at a lower temperature because the PtH bond strength (calculated by DFT in this work as 2.7 eV) is weaker than the NiH bond (calculated by DFT in this work as 2.82 eV). If one assumes that H2 dissociation on the bimetallic surfaces is also not activated, then the lower desorption temperature from the 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 600 K and 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K/600 K surfaces indicates a weaker metalH bond on these surfaces than on either the thick Ni film or the Pt(1 1 1) surface. In contrast, the higher H2 desorption temperature from the 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K surface suggests a stronger metalH bond on this surface (similar to the NiH bond in strength). In our TPD data, we observed similar yields of H2 from all of these surfaces for the same exposures, suggesting that if adsorption is activated on the bimetallic surfaces, it is only weakly so. The primary motivation for the more detailed studies of these surfaces is to identify the structure and composition of these Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces and the origin of the differences in metalH bond strengths.
2.3. Scanning tunneling microscopy
STM was used to study the growth of Ni films on Pt(1 1 1) under different deposition conditions. Since the desorption of H2 showed similar behavior on films deposited at room temperature and subsequently annealed to 600 K and films that were directly deposited at 600 K ( Fig. 1 ), we have examined the surface structures for both deposition conditions.

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a technique used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The method involves evaporating metal wires in a UHV chamber and depositing the vapor onto a substrate. Critical process parameters include the temperature of the substrate, the rate of evaporation, and the pressure in the chamber. To ensure high-purity metal overlayers, the chamber must be evacuated to extremely low pressures to minimize contamination. PVD facilitates surface science studies by allowing researchers to precisely control the composition and thickness of deposited layers, which can then be analyzed using various spectroscopic techniques. Key considerations for achieving optimal results include ensuring uniform deposition, minimizing defects, and controlling the growth mode of the deposited material. The method allows for the preparation of surfaces with specific compositions, such as Ni/Pt(1 1 1) alloys, which can exhibit unique chemical and catalytic properties.
