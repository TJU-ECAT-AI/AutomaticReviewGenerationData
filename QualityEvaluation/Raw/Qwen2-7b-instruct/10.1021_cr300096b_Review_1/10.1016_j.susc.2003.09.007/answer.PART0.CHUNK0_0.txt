<p>The approach taken in the present study was to deposit thin films of Ni onto a Pt(1 1 1) surface, and to probe the chemical reactivity of these films by temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments.</p>
<p>Experiments were performed in three different UHV chambers. Temperature programmed desorption experiments were performed in a UHV chamber equipped with AES, LEED optics and a quadrupole mass spectrometer.</p>
<p>The chamber was equipped with AES and an Omicron VT scanning tunneling microscope and was described in detail elsewhere.</p>
<p>Nickel was deposited by physical vapor deposition. The source consisted of Ni wires (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%) wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire (Goodfellow, 99.95%).</p>
<p>After sufficient outgassing of the source, the chamber background pressure remained below 7 × 1010 Torr during nickel evaporation.</p>
<p>The surfaces prepared are further categorized in terms of the thermal history of the sample during deposition.</p>
<p>Surfaces prepared by deposition at room temperature and subsequent annealing to near 600 K for an amount of time, equivalent to the deposition time with a Ni/Pt AES ratio near unity after annealing, are referred to as 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K/600 K.</p>
<p>Surfaces prepared by deposition at 600 K to the same AES ratio are designated 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 600 K.</p>
<p>The amount of Ni deposition was primarily characterized by the Ni(LMM)/Pt(237 eV) AES ratio.</p>
<p>The accuracy of this designation is discussed in more detail in a later section.</p>
<p>Subsurface Ni atoms could lead to a weaker metalhydrogen bond by modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms.</p>

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) was used to create bimetallic Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. Thin films of nickel were deposited onto a platinum (1 1 1) surface, and the chemical reactivity of these films was probed using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. Experiments were conducted in three UHV chambers equipped with various surface science techniques such as Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). Nickel deposition involved physical vapor deposition using Ni wires wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire. The chamber background pressure was kept below 7 × 10^-10 Torr during nickel evaporation. Surfaces were categorized based on the thermal history during deposition, with annealing to 600 K affecting the AES ratio, which was used to characterize the amount of nickel deposition. Subsurface nickel atoms were found to weaken the metalhydrogen bond by modifying the electronic structure of the surface platinum atoms.

物理气相沉积（PVD）用于在超高真空（UHV）环境中制备Ni/Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面。将薄层镍沉积到铂（1 1 1）表面上，并使用温度程序脱附（TPD）实验研究这些薄膜的化学活性。在三个配备有各种表面科学技术的UHV腔室中进行了实验，如Auger电子能谱（AES）、低能量离子散射光谱（LEIS）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和低能量电子衍射（LEED）。镍沉积通过物理气相沉积使用缠绕在电阻加热钨丝上的Ni丝进行。腔室背景压力保持在7×10^-10托以下。根据沉积过程中的热历史对表面进行了分类，600 K的退火影响了AES比率，用于表征镍沉积量。发现表面下镍原子通过修改表面铂原子的电子结构来减弱金属氢键。
