Physical vapor deposition (PVD) was conducted in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chambers to prepare bimetallic surfaces. Three distinct UHV chambers were utilized for the experiments. One chamber was equipped with AES, LEED optics, and a quadrupole mass spectrometer for temperature programmed desorption studies. Another chamber was designed for LEIS and XPS experiments, with details provided elsewhere. A third chamber was used for STM experiments, featuring AES and an Omicron VT scanning tunneling microscope, with specifications outlined in a referenced publication. The chamber pressure was maintained at 2 × 1010 Torr during STM experiments.

Nickel was deposited onto the Pt(1 1 1) crystal via physical vapor deposition. The source material consisted of nickel wires (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%) wound around a resistively heated tungsten wire (Goodfellow, 99.95%). In the STM chamber, a water-cooled stainless steel jacket with a movable shutter enclosed the entire apparatus. The quantity of nickel deposited on the crystal was regulated by adjusting the exposure duration. Techniques such as AES, XPS, LEIS, and STM were combined across the different chambers to assess the nickel deposition on the Pt(1 1 1) surface.
