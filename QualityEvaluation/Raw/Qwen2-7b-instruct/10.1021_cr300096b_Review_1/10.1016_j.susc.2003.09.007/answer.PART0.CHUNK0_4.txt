<p>Experiments were performed in three different UHV chambers. Temperature programmed desorption experiments were performed in a UHV chamber equipped with AES, LEED optics and a quadrupole mass spectrometer. This chamber was described in detail elsewhere [11] . The UHV chamber for the LEIS and XPS experiments was also described elsewhere [12] .</p>
<p>The STM experiments were performed in a UHV chamber with a base pressure of 2 × 1010 Torr. The chamber was equipped with AES and an Omicron VT scanning tunneling microscope and was described in detail elsewhere [13] .</p>
<p>Nickel was deposited by physical vapor deposition. The source consisted of Ni wires (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%) wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire (Goodfellow, 99.95%). In the STM chamber, a water-cooled stainless steel jacket with an adjustable shutter surrounded the whole assembly. The Ni source in the LEIS chamber was also water-cooled. In the other chambers, a stainless steel shield surrounded the assembly. After sufficient outgassing of the source, the chamber background pressure remained below 7 × 1010 Torr during nickel evaporation.</p>
<p>The amount of Ni deposition was primarily characterized by the Ni(LMM)/Pt(237 eV) AES ratio. Our earlier designation of the 1 ML Ni/Pt surface was based on the assumption of layer-by-layer growth for Ni and determination of the coverage where the Pt AES intensity was attenuated to 66% of its initial value [14] . This coincidentally occurred at a Ni/Pt AES ratio of 1.0.</p>
<p>We have identified a weakly bound hydrogen species on the annealed Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface. In a previous study, we observed significant differences in the bonding of cyclohexene to annealed Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces as compared to Pt(1 1 1) and thick Ni films (>5 ML) [10] . These differences can explain the enhanced selectivity for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene to cyclohexane over complete decomposition on the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface [10] . They may also contribute to the enhanced activity and selectivity for the formation of butene in the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of thiophene observed on annealed Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces [11] .</p>
<p>It was previously reported that these two surface preparations produced surfaces with similar chemical properties [14] , and is consistent with the similarity of the H2 TPD spectra from the two surfaces, shown in Fig. 1 .</p>
<p>Subsurface Ni atoms tended to increase the intensity of low energy states at the expense of higher energy states in the surface Pt atoms, thus lowering the average energy of the surface Pt d-band. In contrast, the Ni-monolayer d-band was narrower than even the Ni(1 1 1) d-band and was higher in energy than either the Ni or Pt slab.</p>

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) was used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. Thermal evaporation was the technique used for depositing thin films of nickel (Ni) onto a platinum (Pt) substrate. The process involved wrapping Ni wires (99.95% purity) around a resistively heated tungsten wire. The chamber for the deposition process maintained a background pressure below 7 × 10^-10 Torr during the evaporation of Ni. AES was used to characterize the deposition of Ni, based on the Ni(LMM)/Pt(237 eV) ratio. The chamber was designed to be surrounded by shields or jackets to prevent contamination. The annealed Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces showed a weakly bound hydrogen species, which contributed to enhanced selectivity and activity in certain chemical reactions.

The PVD technique facilitated surface science studies by allowing precise control over the deposition of metal overlayers. Key considerations for achieving optimal results included maintaining high vacuum conditions, controlling deposition rates, and ensuring the purity of the metal source material. The annealed Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces demonstrated distinct chemical properties, which could be attributed to the presence of subsurface Ni atoms modifying the electronic states of the surface Pt atoms. This led to the weakening of metal-hydrogen bonds, influencing the surface reactivity in various catalytic processes.

物理蒸镀（PVD）技术用于在超高真空（UHV）环境中制备双金属表面。采用热蒸发法将镍（Ni）薄层沉积到铂（Pt）基板上。过程包括将99.95％纯度的Ni线缠绕在电阻加热的钨线上。沉积室在蒸发Ni期间保持背景压力低于7×10^-10托。使用AES来表征Ni的沉积，基于Ni(LMM)/Pt(237 eV)比率。设计了具有屏蔽或护罩的腔体以防止污染。通过调整温度来实现Ni/Pt(1 1 1)表面的退火处理。退火后的Ni/Pt(1 1 1)表面显示出弱氢物种的存在，这在某些化学反应中增加了选择性和活性。

PVD技术为表面科学研究提供了精确控制金属覆盖层沉积的能力。实现最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括保持高真空条件、控制沉积速率以及确保金属源材料的纯度。退火Ni/Pt(1 1 1)表面表现出独特的化学性质，这可以归因于表面Pt原子电子状态的修改，由亚表面Ni原子引起。这导致了金属-氢键的减弱，影响了各种催化过程的表面反应性。
