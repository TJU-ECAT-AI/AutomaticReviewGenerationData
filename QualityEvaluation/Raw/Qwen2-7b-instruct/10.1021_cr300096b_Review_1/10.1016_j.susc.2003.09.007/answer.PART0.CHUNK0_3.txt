The physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, particularly thermal evaporation, was employed in a series of ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chambers to create bimetallic surfaces. Nickel wires sourced from Alfa Aesar (99.95%) were wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire sourced from Goodfellow (99.95%) to serve as the evaporation source. After adequate outgassing, the chamber's background pressure was maintained below 7 × 10^-10 Torr during nickel evaporation. The water-cooled stainless steel jacket in the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) chamber housed the evaporation source, with an adjustable shutter to control the deposition process. The amount of nickel deposited on the crystal was regulated by adjusting the exposure time, maintaining a constant current. Density functional theory (DFT) was utilized to analyze the trends in the strength of metal-hydrogen bonds on these surfaces.

物理气相沉积（PVD）技术，特别是热蒸发，在一系列超高真空（UHV）腔室中被用来制造双金属表面。从Alfa Aesar来源的镍线（99.95%）缠绕在Goodfellow来源的电阻加热钨线（99.95%）上作为蒸发源。在充分排气后，将腔体背景压力维持在7×10^-10托以下进行镍蒸发。STM腔室中的水冷不锈钢套管包含了蒸发源，带有可调的遮光器来控制沉积过程。通过调整暴露时间并保持恒定电流，控制了晶片上的镍沉积量。密度泛函理论（DFT）被用于分析这些表面上金属-氢键强度的趋势。
