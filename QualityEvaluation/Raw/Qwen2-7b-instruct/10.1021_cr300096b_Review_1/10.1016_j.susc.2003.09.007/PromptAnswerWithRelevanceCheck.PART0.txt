Physical vapor deposition (PVD) was used to create bimetallic Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. Thin films of nickel were deposited onto a platinum (1 1 1) surface, and the chemical reactivity of these films was probed using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. Experiments were conducted in three UHV chambers equipped with various surface science techniques such as Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). Nickel deposition involved physical vapor deposition using Ni wires wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire. The chamber background pressure was kept below 7 × 10^-10 Torr during nickel evaporation. Surfaces were categorized based on the thermal history during deposition, with annealing to 600 K affecting the AES ratio, which was used to characterize the amount of nickel deposition. Subsurface nickel atoms were found to weaken the metalhydrogen bond by modifying the electronic structure of the surface platinum atoms.

2.1. Preparation of Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces
The amount of Ni deposition was primarily characterized by the Ni(LMM)/Pt(237 eV) AES ratio. Our earlier designation of the 1 ML Ni/Pt surface was based on the assumption of layer-by-layer growth for Ni and determination of the coverage where the Pt AES intensity was attenuated to 66% of its initial value [14] . This coincidentally occurred at a Ni/Pt AES ratio of 1.0. This will be the characteristic AES ratio of a surface which we refer to as a 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface. The accuracy of this designation is discussed in more detail in a later section. The surfaces prepared are further categorized in terms of the thermal history of the sample during deposition. Thus, a surface prepared by deposition on a sample at room temperature with a Ni/Pt AES ratio near unity will be referred to as 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K; one prepared by deposition at 600 K to the same AES ratio is designated 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 600 K. Surfaces prepared by deposition at room temperature and subsequent annealing to near 600 K for an amount of time, equivalent to the deposition time with a Ni/Pt AES ratio near unity after annealing, are referred to as 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K/600 K.
2.2. Temperature programmed desorption
Fig. 1a shows H2 TPD spectra from a clean Pt(1 1 1) surface, a 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 600 K surface, and a thick Ni film (>5 ML) on Pt(1 1 1) 600 K surface, after saturation exposures (50 L) to H2 at 120 K. H2 desorbs from the 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 600 K surface at temperatures lower than those on either the clean Pt(1 1 1) surface or the thick Ni film.
Download: Download full-size image Fig. 1. (a) Temperature programmed desorption of a saturation exposure of H2 on Pt(1 1 1), 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 600 K, and a thick Ni film on Pt(1 1 1) 600 K. (b) Temperature programmed desorption of a saturation exposure of H2 on 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 600 K, 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K/600 K, and 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K.
Since the dissociative adsorption of H2 on Ni(1 1 1) and Pt(1 1 1) is not an activated process [15] , the desorption temperature of H2 from these surfaces should, in principle, be related to the respective metalH bond strengths. The barrier for desorption in this case is identical to the heat of dissociative adsorption of H2, and is equal to the gas-phase dissociation energy (calculated by DFT in this work as 4.545 eV, literature 4.522 eV [16] ) minus twice the metalH bond strength. H2 desorbs from Pt(1 1 1) at a lower temperature because the PtH bond strength (calculated by DFT in this work as 2.7 eV) is weaker than the NiH bond (calculated by DFT in this work as 2.82 eV). If one assumes that H2 dissociation on the bimetallic surfaces is also not activated, then the lower desorption temperature from the 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 600 K and 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K/600 K surfaces indicates a weaker metalH bond on these surfaces than on either the thick Ni film or the Pt(1 1 1) surface. In contrast, the higher H2 desorption temperature from the 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K surface suggests a stronger metalH bond on this surface (similar to the NiH bond in strength). In our TPD data, we observed similar yields of H2 from all of these surfaces for the same exposures, suggesting that if adsorption is activated on the bimetallic surfaces, it is only weakly so. The primary motivation for the more detailed studies of these surfaces is to identify the structure and composition of these Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces and the origin of the differences in metalH bond strengths.
2.3. Scanning tunneling microscopy
STM was used to study the growth of Ni films on Pt(1 1 1) under different deposition conditions. Since the desorption of H2 showed similar behavior on films deposited at room temperature and subsequently annealed to 600 K and films that were directly deposited at 600 K ( Fig. 1 ), we have examined the surface structures for both deposition conditions.

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a technique used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The method involves evaporating metal wires in a UHV chamber and depositing the vapor onto a substrate. Critical process parameters include the temperature of the substrate, the rate of evaporation, and the pressure in the chamber. To ensure high-purity metal overlayers, the chamber must be evacuated to extremely low pressures to minimize contamination. PVD facilitates surface science studies by allowing researchers to precisely control the composition and thickness of deposited layers, which can then be analyzed using various spectroscopic techniques. Key considerations for achieving optimal results include ensuring uniform deposition, minimizing defects, and controlling the growth mode of the deposited material. The method allows for the preparation of surfaces with specific compositions, such as Ni/Pt(1 1 1) alloys, which can exhibit unique chemical and catalytic properties.

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) was used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. Thermal evaporation was the technique used for depositing thin films of nickel (Ni) onto a platinum (Pt) substrate. The process involved wrapping Ni wires (99.95% purity) around a resistively heated tungsten wire. The chamber for the deposition process maintained a background pressure below 7 × 10^-10 Torr during the evaporation of Ni. AES was used to characterize the deposition of Ni, based on the Ni(LMM)/Pt(237 eV) ratio. The chamber was designed to be surrounded by shields or jackets to prevent contamination. The annealed Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces showed a weakly bound hydrogen species, which contributed to enhanced selectivity and activity in certain chemical reactions.

The PVD technique facilitated surface science studies by allowing precise control over the deposition of metal overlayers. Key considerations for achieving optimal results included maintaining high vacuum conditions, controlling deposition rates, and ensuring the purity of the metal source material. The annealed Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces demonstrated distinct chemical properties, which could be attributed to the presence of subsurface Ni atoms modifying the electronic states of the surface Pt atoms. This led to the weakening of metal-hydrogen bonds, influencing the surface reactivity in various catalytic processes.
