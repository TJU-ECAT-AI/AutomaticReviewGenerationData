Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a technique that is particularly suitable for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, which are essential for surface science studies. PVD methods use line-of-sight deposition to deposit a metal overlayer on the target substrate. Thermal evaporation, one common PVD method, involves heating a metal source to its evaporation temperature, typically using a tungsten or tantalum filament. The metal source is contained within a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening directing the deposition onto the substrate while preventing metal evaporation onto other components. To ensure purity, the metal deposition is performed at a lower pressure, usually less than 5 × 1010 Torr, in the UHV system. This process facilitates the study of surface properties by enabling precise control over the metal overlayer's composition and structure. Various characterization techniques, such as Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), are used to analyze the bimetallic surfaces' structures and compositions.

物理蒸镀（PVD）是一种特别适用于在超高真空（UHV）环境中制备二元金属表面的技术，这对于表面科学研究至关重要。PVD方法使用线视沉积在目标基板上沉积金属覆盖层。热蒸发是常见的PVD方法之一，涉及将金属源加热至其蒸发温度，通常使用钨或钽丝。金属源被包含在一个不锈钢筒内，其中有一个小开口直接将沉积物引导到基板上，同时防止金属蒸发到其他组件上。为了确保纯度，在UHV系统中进行金属沉积时，压力通常低于5×1010托，通常为较低压力。这个过程使研究表面性质成为可能，通过精确控制金属覆盖层的组成和结构。使用各种表征技术，如电子能谱（AES）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、低能电子衍射（LEED）和扫描隧道显微镜（STM），分析二元金属表面的结构和组成。
