Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a preferred technique for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments due to its compatibility with surface science studies. The process involves the deposition of a metal overlayer on a target substrate using line-of-sight deposition. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation via a thermal filament. Thermal evaporation utilizes a tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire as a source, wrapped with a smaller wire of the metal of interest. The metal source is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct deposition onto the substrate while preventing evaporation onto other components. To ensure high purity, the UHV system pressure should be maintained at 5 × 1010 Torr or lower during evaporation. This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing precise control over the deposition process and ensuring the creation of high-quality bimetallic surfaces.

To achieve optimal results, several critical process parameters must be considered:
1. **Deposition rate**: Controlled by the metal vapor flux, which influences the thickness and uniformity of the deposited layer.
2. **Time of deposition**: Determines the thickness of the metal overlayer.
3. **Substrate temperature**: Influences the diffusion behavior of atoms within the bimetallic structure.
4. **Deposition environment**: Maintaining a UHV environment prevents the accumulation of background impurities on the surface.

In addition to thermal evaporation, other PVD methods like magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, and e-beam sputtering offer alternative ways to deposit metal layers. Each method has its advantages and may be chosen based on specific requirements, such as the desired layer thickness, purity, and the nature of the substrate.

After deposition, the structure and elemental composition of bimetallic surfaces are determined using a range of UHV techniques including Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Low-Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS), Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). These techniques provide valuable insights into the surface properties and help in understanding the growth mechanism of the metal overlayer, as well as its morphology and structure.

物理气相沉积（PVD），特别是热蒸发，是创建超真空（UHV）环境中的双金属表面的首选技术，因为它与表面科学研究兼容。该过程通过视线沉积在目标基底上沉积金属覆盖层。常见的PVD方法包括磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射以及通过热丝蒸发的过层金属。热蒸发使用钨（W）或钽（Ta）线作为来源，并用较细的线包裹感兴趣的金属。金属源通常位于不锈钢圆筒中，前面有一个小开口以引导沉积到基板上并防止蒸发到其他组件上。为了确保高纯度，UHV系统压力在蒸发过程中应保持在5×1010托或更低。这种方法通过允许对沉积过程进行精确控制和确保创建高质量的双金属表面，从而促进表面科学研究。

为了实现最佳结果，需要考虑几个关键的工艺参数：
1. **沉积速率**：由金属蒸气流量控制，影响沉积层的厚度和均匀性。
2. **沉积时间**：决定了金属覆盖层的厚度。
3. **基片温度**：影响原子在双金属结构内的扩散行为。
4. **沉积环境**：维持UHV环境可防止表面积聚背景杂质。

除了热蒸发外，还有其他PVD方法如磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积和电子束溅射提供了沉积金属层的替代方式。每种方法都有其优势，并可根据特定需求选择，例如所需的层厚度、纯度和基片的性质。

沉积后，使用一系列UHV技术来确定双金属表面的结构和元素组成，包括原子发射光谱（AES）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、低能离子散射（LEIS）、低能电子衍射（LEED）和扫描隧道显微镜（STM）。这些技术提供了有关表面属性的重要见解，并有助于理解金属覆盖层的生长机制，以及其形态和结构。
