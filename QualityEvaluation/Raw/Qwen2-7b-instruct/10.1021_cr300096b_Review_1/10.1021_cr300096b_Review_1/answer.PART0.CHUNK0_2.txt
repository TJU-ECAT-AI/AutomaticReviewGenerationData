Answer: Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is particularly suited for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, which are essential for surface science studies. This technique employs line-of-sight deposition to deposit a metal overlayer on the substrate. Common PVD methods encompass magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation through a thermal filament. The process begins with a thin tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire wrapped around with the metal of interest, ensuring the deposition of the desired metal without contaminating the filament material. The metal source is enclosed within a stainless steel cylinder equipped with a small opening to guide the deposition onto the substrate while preventing the evaporation of metals from affecting other components in the UHV system. The metal source is heated to the evaporation temperature, maintained for a specific duration to ensure a reproducible, impurity-free deposition of the metal overlayer. This conditioning step typically requires several hours at a slightly higher current or voltage compared to the actual deposition. To prevent the accumulation of background impurities, the UHV system's pressure should be reduced to 5 × 10^(-10) Torr or lower during the evaporation process.

答案：物理蒸镀（PVD）特别适合在超高真空（UHV）环境中制备二元金属表面，这是表面科学研究必不可少的。此技术利用视线沉积来在基板上沉积一层金属覆盖层。常见的PVD方法包括磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射以及通过热丝蒸发的金属覆盖层。该过程以细长的钨（W）或钽（Ta）线围绕所需金属进行包装开始，确保在不污染线材材料的情况下沉积所需金属。金属源被封装在一个不锈钢筒中，配备了一个小开口，用于引导沉积到基板上并防止蒸发的金属影响系统中的其他组件。金属源加热至蒸发温度，并保持特定时间以确保无杂质、可重复沉积金属覆盖层。这一预处理步骤通常需要几个小时，在比实际沉积稍高的电流或电压下进行。为了防止背景杂质积累，UHV系统的压力应降低到每秒乘以10^-10托或更低的水平，期间进行蒸发过程。
