Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is the preferred technique for preparing bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments due to its compatibility with the stringent conditions required for surface science studies. This method involves depositing a metal overlayer on the target substrate using line-of-sight deposition. Common PVD processes include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal evaporation of the metal through a filament. Conditioning of the metal source takes several hours at a slightly higher current or voltage compared to the actual deposition process. To ensure high purity of the metal overlayer, the pressure within the UHV system must remain below 5 × 1010 Torr during the evaporation phase, thus preventing the buildup of background impurities on the bimetallic surface.

物理蒸汽沉积（PVD）是用于在超真空（UHV）环境中制备双金属表面的最佳技术，因为它符合表面科学研究所需的严格条件。此方法通过线视沉积在目标基底上沉积金属覆盖层。常见的PVD过程包括磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射和通过热丝蒸发金属以形成覆盖层。金属源的条件化需要几个小时，在实际沉积过程中电流或电压略高。为了确保金属覆盖层的高纯度，UHV系统中的压力必须保持在5×1010托以下，从而防止在双金属表面上积累背景杂质。
