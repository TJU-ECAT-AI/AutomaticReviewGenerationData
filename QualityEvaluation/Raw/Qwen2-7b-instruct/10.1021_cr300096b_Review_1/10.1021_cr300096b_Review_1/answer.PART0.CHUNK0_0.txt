Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is the preferred method for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, compatible with surface science studies. PVD utilizes line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the substrate. Common PVD techniques include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal evaporation using a tungsten or tantalum filament. The filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening directing the metal deposition onto the substrate. To ensure high purity, the UHV system pressure should be below 5 × 1010 Torr during evaporation. Procedures for preparing bimetallic surfaces under UHV conditions have been detailed previously. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) are used to quantify elemental compositions, while Low-Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) detects the topmost layer's composition with high sensitivity. Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) determines the overlayer structure, and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) assesses the structure and morphology of the metal overlayer.

物理蒸镀（PVD）是用于在超高真空（UHV）环境中制备二元金属表面的首选方法，与表面科学研究兼容。PVD通过视线沉积技术在基底上生成金属覆盖层。常见的PVD技术包括磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射以及使用钨或钽丝的热蒸发。丝通常封装在不锈钢圆筒中，前端有一个小开口，用于将金属沉积到基板上并防止金属沉积到UHV系统中的其他组件上。为了确保高纯度，蒸发过程中UHV系统的压力应低于5×1010托。已详细描述了在UHV条件下准备二元金属表面的程序。原子发射光谱（AES）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）用于量化元素组成，而低能离子散射（LEIS）以高灵敏度检测表面顶部层的组成。低能电子衍射（LEED）确定了覆盖层结构，扫描隧道显微镜（STM）评估了金属覆盖层的结构和形态。
