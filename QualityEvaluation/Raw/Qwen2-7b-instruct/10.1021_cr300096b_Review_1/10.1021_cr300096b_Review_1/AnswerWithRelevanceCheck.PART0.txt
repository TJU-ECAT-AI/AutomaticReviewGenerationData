          [1] "Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."
          [2] "The PVD methods utilize line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate."
          [3] "Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
          [4] "The metal source consists of a thin (typically 0.20.5 mm) tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, which is wrapped around with wire (typically 0.050.1 mm) of the metal of interest."
          [5] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with a small opening at the front face of the cylinder to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto other components in the UHV system."
          [6] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5 × 1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."
          [7] "Procedures for the preparation of bimetallic surface structures under UHV conditions have been described in detail previously."
          [8] "Auger Electron Spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy are often used to quantify the elemental compositions of bimetallic surfaces."
          [9] "In LEIS experiments, the surface is bombarded with positive ions of an inert element, such as He, Ne, or Ar, at a relatively low energy (1005000 eV)."
          [10] "LEED is a useful technique to determine the overlayer structure in bimetallic surfaces."
          [11] "Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is often used to determine the structure and morphology of the metal overlayer in bimetallic surfaces."

          Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is the preferred method for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, compatible with the stringent conditions required for surface science studies. This method involves depositing a metal overlayer on the target substrate using line-of-sight deposition. Common PVD techniques include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal evaporation using a tungsten or tantalum filament. The metal source typically consists of a thin tungsten or tantalum wire wrapped with a smaller wire of the metal of interest. The evaporation filament is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and prevent evaporation onto other components in the UHV system. To ensure high purity, the UHV system pressure during evaporation should be kept at 5 × 1010 Torr or lower. Procedures for preparing bimetallic surface structures under UHV conditions have been detailed previously. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) are often used to quantify the elemental compositions of bimetallic surfaces. In Low-Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) experiments, the surface is bombarded with positive ions of an inert element at relatively low energy to detect the topmost layer's composition. Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) helps determine the overlayer structure, and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) assesses the structure and morphology of the metal overlayer in bimetallic surfaces.

          物理蒸镀（PVD）是用于在超真空（UHV）环境中制备双金属表面的首选方法，因为它符合表面科学研究所需的严格条件。该方法通过视线沉积在目标基底上沉积金属覆盖层。常见的PVD技术包括磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射以及通过热丝蒸发使用钨或钽丝的金属。金属源通常由细长的钨或钽线包裹较小的线制成，感兴趣的金属。蒸发丝位于不锈钢圆筒中，前部有一个小开口，用于引导金属沉积到基板上并防止蒸发到UHV系统中的其他组件上。为了确保高纯度，在蒸发过程中UHV系统的压力应保持在5×1010托或更低。在UHV条件下准备双金属表面结构的程序已在之前详细描述。原子发射光谱（AES）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）经常用于量化双金属表面的元素组成。在低能离子散射（LEIS）实验中，表面被惰性元素的正离子轰击，能量相对较低（100-5000 eV），以检测最顶层的组成。低能电子衍射（LEED）有助于确定覆盖层结构，而扫描隧道显微镜（STM）评估了双金属表面的金属覆盖层的结构和形态。
