Physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques, particularly thermal evaporation, enable the creation of bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The experimental setup typically involves heating a metal source to its melting point, causing it to vaporize. The vapor is directed towards a substrate kept at a lower temperature, where it condenses and forms a film. Maintaining high vacuum conditions prevents contamination during the deposition process. Critical process parameters such as substrate temperature, evaporation rate, and vacuum pressure are optimized to achieve the desired film characteristics. This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing detailed examination of the surface chemistry and structure. Achieving optimal results requires meticulous control of the deposition conditions to ensure high purity and uniformity of the bimetallic overlay.
