Thermal evaporation is a fundamental physical vapor deposition technique used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum environments. It involves heating a pure metal source to a high temperature, causing it to sublime or evaporate. Operating in UHV conditions ensures minimal contamination and high-quality film deposition. Critical parameters include temperature control, substrate heating, and deposition rate. Proper substrate cleaning is essential before deposition. These films are valuable for detailed surface science studies and applications like corrosion resistance, optical coatings, and electronics.
