Physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques, especially thermal evaporation, enable the creation of bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. These processes typically involve heating metal sources in a source chamber to release vapor, which then condenses onto a substrate. Critical parameters include vapor pressure, substrate temperature, and deposition rate. High-purity metal overlayers are achieved through precise control of these factors and the use of high-purity metal sources. UHV conditions prevent oxidation and contamination, ensuring high-quality deposition. This method is instrumental in surface science studies, offering insights into deposited layers and interfaces. Key considerations for optimal results include minimizing surface defects, controlling layer thickness, and ensuring uniform deposition across the substrate.
