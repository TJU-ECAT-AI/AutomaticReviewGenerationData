This involved depositing 3d transition metals (Fe, Cu, Ni, Co) onto a Pt(111) single-crystal disk at a rate of 0.2 to 0.3 monolayers (ML) per minute to form a monolayer of the 3d metal on the surface. The deposition was carried out in a UHV chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for surface characterization and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. AES measurements were used to monitor the deposition process, determining the composition of the deposited metal layers. The AES quantified the physical vapor deposition and thermal behavior of both Fe and Cu on Pt(111), revealing distinct differences in their deposition characteristics. After deposition, the surfaces were heated to high temperatures, and AES scans were performed to assess the changes in surface composition. The AES ratios for Fe-Pt-Pt(111) and Cu-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces were calculated to be 1.7 and 1.8, respectively, consistent with experimental findings.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013"},
