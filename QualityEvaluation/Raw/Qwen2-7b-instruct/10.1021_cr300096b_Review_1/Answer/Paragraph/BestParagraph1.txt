        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/cr300096b_1]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013] and [10.1007/978-1-4684-8777-0_7]. Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies. This method involves depositing a metal overlayer on the target substrate using line-of-sight deposition. Common PVD techniques include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal evaporation using a tungsten or tantalum filament. The metal source typically consists of a thin tungsten or tantalum wire wrapped with a smaller wire of the metal of interest. The evaporation filament is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and prevent evaporation onto other components in the UHV system. To ensure high purity, the UHV system pressure during evaporation should be kept at 5 Ã— 10^10 Torr or lower.

        Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) are often used to quantify the elemental compositions of bimetallic surfaces. In Low-Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) experiments, the surface is bombarded with positive ions of an inert element at relatively low energy to detect the topmost layer's composition. Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) is a useful technique to determine the overlayer structure in bimetallic surfaces. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is often used to determine the structure and morphology of the metal overlayer in bimetallic surfaces.

        Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.2 to 0.3 ML/min. The current study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of . This chamber was equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) with a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases.

        Experiments conducted on clean, perfect, surfaces can produce a large amount of structural information of high precision. Obviously, it is only possible to produce precise data for surfaces which are well defined in the first place. The major difficulty is common to all surface experiments, namely, to keep the surface clean. Techniques such as heating the sample and ion bombardment are used to clean the surface within an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber.

        In summary, 3d-Pt-Pt(111), or the surface configuration, is representative of 1 ML of the 3d metal on Pt(111) and was prepared by depositing 1 ML at 300 K. The surfaces were then heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition. Several different active sites are available on the Cu-Pt alloy due to its relative amount of disorder. Using a model of an atomically thin overlayer element (Fe or Cu) on a substrate (Pt), the calculated AES ratios were 1.7 for the Fe-Pt-Pt(111) surface and 1.8 for the Cu-Pt-Pt(111) surface, in general agreement with the experimental results.

        The AES quantification of the physical vapor deposition and thermal behavior of Fe on Pt(111) and Cu on Pt(111) provides insights into the distinct deposition characteristics and surface compositions of these elements when deposited on a Pt(111) surface. These findings contribute to the understanding of the interaction between atoms and molecules with solid surfaces and the optimization of PVD techniques for the preparation of high-purity bimetallic surfaces in UHV environments, which are crucial for advanced materials science and catalysis research.
