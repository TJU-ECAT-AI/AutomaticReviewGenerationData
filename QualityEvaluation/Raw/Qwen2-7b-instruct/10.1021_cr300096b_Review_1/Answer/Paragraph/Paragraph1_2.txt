        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/cr300096b_1]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013] and [10.1007/978-1-4684-8777-0_7]. Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environment necessary for surface science studies. This method utilizes line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. Common PVD techniques include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal evaporation using a tungsten or tantalum filament. The metal source typically consists of a thin tungsten or tantalum wire wrapped with a smaller wire of the metal of interest. The evaporation filament is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and prevent evaporation onto other components in the UHV system. To ensure high purity, the UHV system pressure during evaporation should be kept at 5 × 10^-10 Torr or lower. Procedures for preparing bimetallic surface structures under UHV conditions have been described in detail previously. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) are often used to quantify the elemental compositions of bimetallic surfaces. In Low-Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) experiments, the surface is bombarded with positive ions of an inert element at relatively low energy to detect the topmost layer's composition. Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) helps determine the overlayer structure, and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) assesses the structure and morphology of the metal overlayer in bimetallic surfaces. Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.2 to 0.3 ML/min. The current study was performed in a two-level stainless steel UHV chamber with a base pressure of 5 × 10^-10 Torr. The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements. For the deposition of Cu, a break in the Pt signal was evident, whereas breaks in the Cu signal were not easily seen. Deposition of Fe at 600 K, which is in the middle of this alloy formation region, was performed to create a Pt-Fe-Pt(111) surface. The AES quantification of the physical vapor deposition and thermal behavior of Fe on Pt(111) and Cu on Pt(111) surfaces revealed distinct differences in their deposition characteristics. After deposition, the surfaces were heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition. In addition, several different active sites are available on the Cu-Pt alloy due to its relative amount of disorder. Interaction of Atoms and Molecules with Solid Surfaces emphasizes the importance of maintaining surface cleanliness in experiments. Techniques such as heating the sample and ion bombardment are used to clean the surface within an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber. The presence of impurities can lead to misleading results, particularly in low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) experiments, which are highly sensitive to surface cleanliness. Precise data can only be obtained from surfaces that are initially well-defined.
        
        In summary, the PVD technique, particularly thermal evaporation, facilitates the creation of high-purity bimetallic surfaces in UHV environments, providing insights into the surface science through detailed characterization methods like AES, XPS, LEIS, LEED, and STM. This method ensures the deposition of monolayers of metal on a substrate with controlled purity, allowing for a deeper understanding of the surface structure and properties. The meticulous control over deposition parameters, combined with rigorous surface cleaning techniques, ensures accurate and reliable data acquisition, making PVD a valuable tool in surface science studies.

        从参考文献[10.1021/cr300096b_1]建立详细的分析。从参考文献[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013]和[10.1007/978-1-4684-8777-0_7]中获取综合理解。在各种沉积方法中，物理蒸汽沉积（PVD）最符合超高压真空（UHV）环境对表面科学研究的需要。这种方法利用视线沉积在目标基底上形成金属覆盖层。常见的PVD技术包括磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射以及通过热丝蒸发金属覆盖层的热蒸发方法。金属源通常由薄的钨或钽线（直径通常为0.20.5毫米）和目标金属线（直径通常为0.050.1毫米）缠绕而成。蒸发丝放置在不锈钢圆筒中，并在前端有小开口以将金属沉积到基板上，并防止蒸发到UHV系统中的其他组件。为了确保高纯度，在蒸发过程中，UHV系统的压力应保持在5 × 10^-10托或更低。已经详细描述了在UHV条件下制备双金属表面结构的方法。原子发射光谱（AES）和X射线光电谱（XPS）经常用于量化双金属表面的元素组成。在低能离子散射（LEIS）实验中，表面被惰性元素的正离子（如He、Ne或Ar）以较低能量轰击，以检测顶层的组成。低能电子衍射（LEED）有助于确定覆盖层的结构，而扫描隧道显微镜（STM）评估金属覆盖层在双金属表面上的结构和形态。每种表面均以约一个单层（ML）的相应3d金属制备，沉积速率在0.2至0.3 ML/分钟之间。当前研究在具有基压为5 × 10^-10托的两层不锈钢UHV腔室中进行。通过3 kV加速电压在所有AES测量中确定3d（LMM）/Pt（241 eV）AES峰值到峰值比来定量3d金属的沉积量。对于Cu的沉积，Pt信号出现断裂，而Cu信号难以观察。在600 K的中间区域，通过Fe在Pt(111)表面上的沉积创建了Pt-Fe-Pt(111)表面。AES量化了Fe在Pt(111)表面和Cu在Pt(111)表面上的物理蒸汽沉积和热行为，揭示了Fe和Cu在沉积特性上的显著差异。沉积后，表面在3 K/s的加热速率下逐渐加热到更高的温度，并在冷却至低于500 K后执行AES扫描，以确定表面成分的变化。此外，Cu-Pt合金上有不同的活性位点可用，这归因于其相对较高的无序程度。《原子与分子与固体表面的相互作用》强调了在实验中维持表面清洁的重要性。使用加热样品和离子轰击等技术在超高压真空（UHV）腔室内清洁表面。杂质的存在可能导致误导性结果，特别是在低能电子衍射（LEED）实验中，这些实验对表面清洁度非常敏感。仅当表面最初定义良好时，才能从表面获得精确数据。

        总之，特别是热蒸发的PVD技术能够在一个超高压真空环境中创建高纯度的双金属表面，通过诸如AES、XPS、LEIS、LEED和STM等详细表征方法提供了表面科学的见解。这种方法确保以受控纯度在基板上沉积单层金属，允许深入了解表面结构和性质。沉积参数的精细控制，结合严格的表面清洁技术，确保了准确可靠的测量数据收集，使PVD成为表面科学研究的宝贵工具。持续优化表面科学技术以及理论模型的发展，将有助于更深入地理解原子和分子与固体表面之间的基本相互作用。
