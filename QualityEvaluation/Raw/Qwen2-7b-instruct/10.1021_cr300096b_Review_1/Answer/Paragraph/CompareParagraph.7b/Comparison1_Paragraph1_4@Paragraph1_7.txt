They are equally strong in discussing the topic relevance, comprehensiveness of information, accuracy of information, innovativeness of viewpoints, and integration of interdisciplinary perspectives. Both also display effective logical structures, balanced chapter arrangements, and quality introductions and conclusions. They maintain academic standards with accurate citations, timely and relevant references, and appropriate citation practices. The critical analyses of existing research and the proposal of new research directions are similarly insightful in both reviews. Their methodologies are described clearly and logically selected, although the rigor of research design could be improved. Both reviews reflect the latest research results and current research hotspots, offering feasible suggestions for future research and practical applications. However, neither review stands out distinctly in any single category, resulting in identical overall scores."
