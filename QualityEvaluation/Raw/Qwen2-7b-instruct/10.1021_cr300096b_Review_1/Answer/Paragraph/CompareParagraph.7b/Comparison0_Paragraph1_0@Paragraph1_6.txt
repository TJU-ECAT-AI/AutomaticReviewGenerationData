    "Summary": "Both reviews provide a thorough overview of physical vapor deposition techniques for preparing high-purity bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum environments. They share similar strengths in terms of content quality, structure and organization, academic standards, innovation and contribution, methodology assessment, timeliness and cutting-edge nature, writing quality, and practicality and application value. However, neither review stands out in any particular area, leading to identical scores for both. The lack of innovative viewpoints, in-depth critical analysis, and detailed implementation strategies limits their overall impact. Both articles would benefit from a deeper exploration of interdisciplinary perspectives, more rigorous research design, and a clearer presentation of potential contributions to the field."
