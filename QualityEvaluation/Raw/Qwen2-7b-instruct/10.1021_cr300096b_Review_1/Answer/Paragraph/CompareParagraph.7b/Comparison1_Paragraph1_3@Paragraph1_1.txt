    "Summary": "Both articles effectively cover the topic of physical vapor deposition techniques, particularly thermal evaporation, for preparing high-purity bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum environments. They offer a comprehensive overview of experimental setups, process parameters, and quality control measures relevant to surface science applications. However, they lack in-depth analysis, original perspectives, and a rigorous methodology. Both articles could benefit from incorporating more recent literature, clearer citations, and a more concise writing style to enhance their academic standards and practical applicability."
