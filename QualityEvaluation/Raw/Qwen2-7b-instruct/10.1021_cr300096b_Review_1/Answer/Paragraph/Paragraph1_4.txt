        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/cr300096b_1]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013] and [10.1007/978-1-4684-8777-0_7]. Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environment necessary for surface science studies. This method involves depositing a metal overlayer on the target substrate using line-of-sight deposition. Common PVD techniques include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament. The metal source typically consists of a thin tungsten or tantalum wire wrapped with a smaller wire of the metal of interest. The evaporation filament is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and prevent evaporation onto other components in the UHV system. To ensure high purity, the UHV system pressure during evaporation should be kept at 5 × 10^-10 Torr or lower. Procedures for preparing bimetallic surface structures under UHV conditions have been detailed previously. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) are often used to quantify the elemental compositions of bimetallic surfaces. In Low-Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) experiments, the surface is bombarded with positive ions of an inert element at relatively low energy to detect the topmost layer's composition. Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) helps determine the overlayer structure, and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) assesses the structure and morphology of the metal overlayer in bimetallic surfaces. Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.2 to 0.3 ML/min. The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements. The AES quantification of the physical vapor deposition and thermal behavior of both Fe and Cu on Pt(111) revealed distinct differences in their deposition characteristics. After deposition, the surfaces were heated to high temperatures, and AES scans were performed to assess the changes in surface composition. The AES ratios for Fe-Pt-Pt(111) and Cu-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces were calculated to be 1.7 and 1.8, respectively, consistent with experimental findings. Interaction of Atoms and Molecules with Solid Surfaces emphasizes the importance of maintaining surface cleanliness in experiments. Techniques such as heating the sample and ion bombardment are used to clean the surface within an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber. The presence of impurities can lead to misleading results, particularly in low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) experiments, which are highly sensitive to surface cleanliness. Precise data can only be obtained from surfaces that are initially well-defined.
