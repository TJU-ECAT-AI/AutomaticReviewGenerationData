The surfaces were subsequently heated at a rate of 3 K/s to higher temperatures, and AES scans were executed once the surfaces had cooled below 500 K, enabling the assessment of changes in the surface composition. Due to the Cu-Pt alloy's varying degrees of disorder, multiple active sites were available on the surface.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013"},

A critical challenge is maintaining the surface cleanliness, which is typically addressed through various cleaning techniques within the UHV chamber, such as heating the sample and ion bombardment. Detecting impurities on the surface, often through Auger signals from adsorbed atoms, is another crucial step. Working on clean surfaces enables the collection of high-precision structural information.", "Doi": "10.1007/978-1-4684-8777-0_7"},
