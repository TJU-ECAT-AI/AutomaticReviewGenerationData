The current study was conducted in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of . This chamber was equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) featuring a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for surface characterization, and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases. A Pt(111) single-crystal disk, sourced from Metal Crystals and Oxides, Ltd., Cambridge, was spot-welded directly to two tantalum posts. Prior to each experiment, the Pt(111) surface underwent several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, followed by flashing to 1050 K. Subsequently, oxygen dosing (for 50 seconds) was carried out at 890 K, and annealing took place at 1050 K for 5 minutes. The quantity of the 3d metal deposited was determined using the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, with an accelerating voltage of 3 kV applied in all AES measurements. For the deposition of Cu, a noticeable break in the Pt signal was observed, whereas the Cu signal did not exhibit similar interruptions. The surfaces were subsequently heated at a rate of 3 K/s to higher temperatures, and AES scans were executed once the surfaces had cooled below 500 K, enabling the assessment of changes in the surface composition. Due to the Cu-Pt alloy's varying degrees of disorder, multiple active sites were available on the surface.

The essential elements for conducting surface experiments, including Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), consist of an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber, an electron gun, a crystal holder, and means to observe diffracted electrons. A critical challenge is maintaining the surface cleanliness, which is typically addressed through various cleaning techniques within the UHV chamber, such as heating the sample and ion bombardment. Detecting impurities on the surface, often through Auger signals from adsorbed atoms, is another crucial step. Working on clean surfaces enables the collection of high-precision structural information.
