          The physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, particularly thermal evaporation, was employed to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. This involved depositing 3d transition metals (Fe, Cu, Ni, Co) onto a Pt(111) single-crystal disk at a rate of 0.2 to 0.3 monolayers (ML) per minute to form a monolayer of the 3d metal on the surface. The deposition was carried out in a UHV chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for surface characterization and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. AES measurements were used to monitor the deposition process, determining the composition of the deposited metal layers. The AES quantified the physical vapor deposition and thermal behavior of both Fe and Cu on Pt(111), revealing distinct differences in their deposition characteristics. After deposition, the surfaces were heated to high temperatures, and AES scans were performed to assess the changes in surface composition. The AES ratios for Fe-Pt-Pt(111) and Cu-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces were calculated to be 1.7 and 1.8, respectively, consistent with experimental findings.

          物理气相沉积（PVD）技术，特别是热蒸发，被用来在超高真空（UHV）环境中制造双金属表面。这涉及到以每分钟0.2至0.3个单层（ML）的速度将3d过渡金属（Fe、Cu、Ni、Co）沉积到Pt(111)单晶盘上，在表面上形成一层3d金属。沉积在装有原子发射光谱仪（AES）和四极质谱仪（MS）的UHV室中进行，用于表面表征和温度程序脱附（TPD）实验。AES测量用于监控沉积过程，确定沉积金属层的组成。AES量化了Fe和Cu在Pt(111)上的物理气相沉积和热行为，揭示了它们沉积特性之间的明显差异。沉积完成后，将表面加热至高温，并执行AES扫描以评估表面组成的变化。计算得出的Fe-Pt-Pt(111)和Cu-Pt-Pt(111)表面AES比分别为1.7和1.8，与实验结果一致。

          The current study was conducted in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of . This chamber was equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) featuring a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for surface characterization, and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases. A Pt(111) single-crystal disk, sourced from Metal Crystals and Oxides, Ltd., Cambridge, was spot-welded directly to two tantalum posts. Prior to each experiment, the Pt(111) surface underwent several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, followed by flashing to 1050 K. Subsequently, oxygen dosing (for 50 seconds) was carried out at 890 K, and annealing took place at 1050 K for 5 minutes. The quantity of the 3d metal deposited was determined using the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, with an accelerating voltage of 3 kV applied in all AES measurements. For the deposition of Cu, a noticeable break in the Pt signal was observed, whereas the Cu signal did not exhibit similar interruptions. The surfaces were subsequently heated at a rate of 3 K/s to higher temperatures, and AES scans were executed once the surfaces had cooled below 500 K, enabling the assessment of changes in the surface composition. Due to the Cu-Pt alloy's varying degrees of disorder, multiple active sites were available on the surface.

          当前的研究是在一个带有压力为 的两层不锈钢超高真空（UHV）室中进行的。该室配备了具有单次通过圆柱镜分析器的原子发射光谱仪（AES）用于表征表面，并配备有四极质谱仪（MS）用于温度程序脱附（TPD）实验和对注入气体纯度的原位验证。一块来自Cambridge Metal Crystals and Oxides有限公司的单晶盘状铂（111）直接焊接到两个钽针上。在每次实验之前，通过600 K的Ne+溅射循环清洁了Pt(111)表面，随后进行了闪蒸至1050 K。接着，在890 K下进行了氧气剂量处理（持续50秒），并在1050 K下进行了5分钟的退火。3d金属的沉积量通过3d（LMM）/Pt（241 eV）AES峰-峰比确定，所有AES测量中均使用了3 kV的加速电压。对于Cu的沉积，观察到了Pt信号的明显中断，而Cu信号没有表现出类似的中断。随后，表面以3 K/s的速率加热至更高温度，并在表面冷却至低于500 K后执行AES扫描，以评估表面组成的变化。由于Cu-Pt合金的混乱程度不同，表面上有多个活性位点可用。
