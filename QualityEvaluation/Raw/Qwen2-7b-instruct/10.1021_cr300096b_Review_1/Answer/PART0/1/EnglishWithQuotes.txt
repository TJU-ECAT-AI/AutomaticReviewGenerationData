After deposition, the surfaces were heated to high temperatures, and AES scans were performed to assess the changes in surface composition. The AES ratios for Fe-Pt-Pt(111) and Cu-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces were calculated to be 1.7 and 1.8, respectively, consistent with experimental findings.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013"},

Techniques such as heating the sample and ion bombardment are used to clean the surface within an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber. The presence of impurities can lead to misleading results, particularly in low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) experiments, which are highly sensitive to surface cleanliness. Precise data can only be obtained from surfaces that are initially well-defined.", "Doi": "10.1007/978-1-4684-8777-0_7"},
