[1] "Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."
          [2] "The PVD methods utilize line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate."
          [3] "Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
          [4] "The metal source consists of a thin (typically 0.20.5 mm) tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, which is wrapped around with wire (typically 0.050.1 mm) of the metal of interest."
          [5] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with a small opening at the front face of the cylinder to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto other components in the UHV system."
          [6] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5 × 1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."

          [9] "In LEIS experiments, the surface is bombarded with positive ions of an inert element, such as He, Ne, or Ar, at a relatively low energy (1005000 eV)."
