Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is the preferred method for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, compatible with the stringent conditions required for surface science studies. This method involves depositing a metal overlayer on the target substrate using line-of-sight deposition. Common PVD techniques include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal evaporation using a tungsten or tantalum filament. The metal source typically consists of a thin tungsten or tantalum wire wrapped with a smaller wire of the metal of interest. The evaporation filament is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and prevent evaporation onto other components in the UHV system. To ensure high purity, the UHV system pressure during evaporation should be kept at 5 × 1010 Torr or lower. Procedures for preparing bimetallic surface structures under UHV conditions have been detailed previously. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) are often used to quantify the elemental compositions of bimetallic surfaces. In Low-Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) experiments, the surface is bombarded with positive ions of an inert element at relatively low energy to detect the topmost layer's composition. Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) helps determine the overlayer structure, and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) assesses the structure and morphology of the metal overlayer in bimetallic surfaces.

The physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, particularly thermal evaporation, was employed to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. This involved depositing 3d transition metals (Fe, Cu, Ni, Co) onto a Pt(111) single-crystal disk at a rate of 0.2 to 0.3 monolayers (ML) per minute to form a monolayer of the 3d metal on the surface. The deposition was carried out in a UHV chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for surface characterization and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. AES measurements were used to monitor the deposition process, determining the composition of the deposited metal layers. The AES quantified the physical vapor deposition and thermal behavior of both Fe and Cu on Pt(111), revealing distinct differences in their deposition characteristics. After deposition, the surfaces were heated to high temperatures, and AES scans were performed to assess the changes in surface composition. The AES ratios for Fe-Pt-Pt(111) and Cu-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces were calculated to be 1.7 and 1.8, respectively, consistent with experimental findings.

Interaction of Atoms and Molecules with Solid Surfaces emphasizes the importance of maintaining surface cleanliness in experiments. Techniques such as heating the sample and ion bombardment are used to clean the surface within an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber. The presence of impurities can lead to misleading results, particularly in low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) experiments, which are highly sensitive to surface cleanliness. Precise data can only be obtained from surfaces that are initially well-defined.
