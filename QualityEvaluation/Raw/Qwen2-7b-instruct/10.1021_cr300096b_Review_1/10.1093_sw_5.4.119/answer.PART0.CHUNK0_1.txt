<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The text "Child Welfare: Principles and Methods" by Dorothy Zietz is an informational resource aimed at college classrooms. It provides a historical perspective on social movements and institutions related to child welfare. However, it deviates from its title slightly by focusing mainly on the historical context rather than presenting principles and methods in child welfare. This might lead to a lack of interest among undergraduate students due to the absence of evaluation of significant social developments. The book could be valuable for teachers looking for a factual outline on the subject.

《儿童福利：原则与方法》一书由Dorothy Zietz撰写，是一本面向大学课堂的信息性资源。它提供了有关儿童福利的社会运动和机构的历史视角。然而，这本书在标题上略有偏离，主要关注历史背景而非儿童福利的原则和方法。这可能导致本科生对缺乏对重要社会发展的评估而失去兴趣。对于寻求该主题事实概述的教师来说，这本书可能很有价值。
