This text focuses on the history and principles of child welfare, providing an informational overview rather than delving deeply into methods and techniques. It discusses the evolution of social work as a profession and acknowledges the interrelation of social work with other professions. The author has done a creditable job in presenting historical events, but offers limited evaluation of significant social developments. The book is based on a thorough review of source material, which makes it a valuable resource for educators in social work and related fields.
