[1] "Perhaps pooling the efforts of a number of treatment agencies might make it possible to develop a more substantial sample size."
[2] "This text is basically informational."
[3] "However, while abiding faithfully by the history of social movements and action, she has offered very little evaluation of significant social developments."
[4] "It is evident, both from the content and from the references, that Dr. Zietz has digested a great deal of source material in preparation for the writing of this book."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This text focuses on the history and principles of child welfare, providing an informational overview rather than delving deeply into methods and techniques. It discusses the evolution of social work as a profession and acknowledges the interrelation of social work with other professions. The author has done a creditable job in presenting historical events, but offers limited evaluation of significant social developments. The book is based on a thorough review of source material, which makes it a valuable resource for educators in social work and related fields.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The text "Child Welfare: Principles and Methods" by Dorothy Zietz is an informational resource aimed at college classrooms. It provides a historical perspective on social movements and institutions related to child welfare. However, it deviates from its title slightly by focusing mainly on the historical context rather than presenting principles and methods in child welfare. This might lead to a lack of interest among undergraduate students due to the absence of evaluation of significant social developments. The book could be valuable for teachers looking for a factual outline on the subject.
