[1] "The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the supports with chloroplatinic acid and were reduced in hydrogen prior to both the chemisorption and catalytic activity measurements."
[2] "For the platinum-on-alumina catalyst, the adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole."
[3] "In the case of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst, the number of hydrogen atoms adsorbed per platinum atom is essentially unity, corresponding to a high degree of dispersion of platinum."
[4] "The effect of the difference in platinum dispersion on catalytic activity is shown by data on the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation to benzene over the two platinum catalysts."

The study focused on the chemisorption of hydrogen on platinum deposited on two different supports: alumina and silica-alumina. The researchers aimed to investigate the effect of the support on the degree of dispersion of the platinum. They found that the platinum was dispersed to a much higher degree on alumina than on silica-alumina. This dispersion was attributed to the higher activity of the platinum on alumina for the cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction. For the platinum-on-alumina catalyst, the adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at a surface coverage of 70% was estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole. Additionally, the study revealed that the adsorption of hydrogen on the platinum was essentially unity, indicating a high degree of dispersion of the platinum on the alumina support. These findings were confirmed through measurements of the rate of dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, showing that the platinum's catalytic activity was significantly influenced by the support's nature, specifically the alumina support.

研究专注于氢在铂沉积在两种不同支撑物（氧化铝和硅酸盐氧化铝）上的化学吸附。研究人员旨在调查支撑物对铂分散度的影响。他们发现，铂在氧化铝上的分散程度远高于在硅酸盐氧化铝上。这种分散被归因于铂在氧化铝上进行环己烷脱氢反应时的更高活性。对于铂-氧化铝催化剂，在70%表面覆盖度下，氢在铂上的吸附被估计为放热7-8 kcal/mole的程度。此外，研究表明，氢在铂上的吸附接近于1，表明铂在氧化铝支撑物上的高分散度。这些发现通过环己烷脱氢速率的测量得到证实，显示了支撑物性质（特别是氧化铝支撑物）对铂的催化活性有显著影响。
