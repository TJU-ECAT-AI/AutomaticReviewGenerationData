[1] "The apparatus used for the hydrogen chemisorption measurements was a conventional glass vacuum system described previously (5)."
[2] "The adsorption isotherms for hydrogen on the platinum catalysts and supports are shown in Fig. 1."
[3] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x, where F represents the moles of cyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams."
[4] "In other words, the specific catalytic activity of the platinum (rate per unit platinum surface area) for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is essentially unaffected by the support."

The document discusses the chemisorption and catalytic properties of supported platinum on alumina and silica-alumina supports. The experiments were conducted in a conventional glass vacuum system with a 80 liter/sec oil diffusion pump. Adsorption isotherms for hydrogen on the catalysts and supports were measured, showing that the adsorption on alumina is small compared to the adsorption on the 2% platinum-on-alumina catalyst. The adsorption on alumina increases with increasing temperature, whereas the adsorption on silica-alumina is only about 15% of that on alumina at a pressure of 2 cm. The specific catalytic activity of platinum for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is essentially unaffected by the support, as it is mainly determined by the platinum surface area. The results suggest that the support affects the degree of dispersion of the platinum, rather than exerting a specific effect on the intrinsic catalytic properties.

文档讨论了支持在氧化铝和硅酸盐氧化铝支持上的铂的化学吸附和催化性质。实验在配备有80升/秒油扩散泵的常规玻璃真空系统中进行。测量了催化剂和支持上氢的吸附等温线，显示氧化铝上的吸附量远小于2%铂-氧化铝催化剂上的吸附量。随着温度的升高，氧化铝上的吸附量增加，而氧化铝上的吸附量仅为氧化铝的15%。在2厘米的压力下。结果表明，铂对环己烷脱氢化特定催化活性不受支持的影响，主要由铂表面积决定。这表明支持影响铂的分散程度，而不是对其内在催化性质产生特定影响。
