[1] "The apparatus used for the hydrogen chemisorption measurements was a conventional glass vacuum system described previously (5)."
[2] "The adsorption isotherms for hydrogen on the platinum catalysts and supports are shown in Fig. 1."
[3] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x, where F represents the moles of cyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams."
[4] "In other words, the specific catalytic activity of the platinum (rate per unit platinum surface area) for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is essentially unaffected by the support."

The document discusses the chemisorption and catalytic properties of supported platinum on alumina and silica-alumina supports. The experiments were conducted in a conventional glass vacuum system with a 80 liter/sec oil diffusion pump. Adsorption isotherms for hydrogen on the catalysts and supports were measured, showing that the adsorption on alumina is small compared to the adsorption on the 2% platinum-on-alumina catalyst. The adsorption on alumina increases with increasing temperature, whereas the adsorption on silica-alumina is only about 15% of that on alumina at a pressure of 2 cm. The specific catalytic activity of platinum for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is essentially unaffected by the support, as it is mainly determined by the platinum surface area. The results suggest that the support affects the degree of dispersion of the platinum, rather than exerting a specific effect on the intrinsic catalytic properties.

文档讨论了支持在氧化铝和硅酸盐氧化铝支持上的铂的化学吸附和催化性质。实验在配备有80升/秒油扩散泵的常规玻璃真空系统中进行。测量了催化剂和支持上氢的吸附等温线，显示氧化铝上的吸附量远小于2%铂-氧化铝催化剂上的吸附量。随着温度的升高，氧化铝上的吸附量增加，而氧化铝上的吸附量仅为氧化铝的15%。在2厘米的压力下。结果表明，铂对环己烷脱氢化特定催化活性不受支持的影响，主要由铂表面积决定。这表明支持影响铂的分散程度，而不是对其内在催化性质产生特定影响。

The study investigates the impact of different supports on the dispersion of platinum and its catalytic properties, specifically in the context of cyclohexane dehydrogenation. It compares the performance of platinum deposited on alumina versus silica-alumina supports. The results show that the platinum is more dispersed on alumina, leading to higher activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. The authors attribute the enhanced activity to the greater dispersion of platinum on the alumina support. The data also reveal that the adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is exothermic, with an estimated heat of adsorption of 7-8 kcal/mole for the alumina-supported catalyst. The study suggests that the support can influence the catalytic properties of platinum by affecting the dispersion of the metal, though the specific catalytic activity of platinum for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is not significantly affected by the support material.

研究探讨了不同载体对铂分散度及其催化性能的影响，特别是在环己烷脱氢反应中的应用。它将铂沉积在氧化铝和硅酸铝支持物上的性能进行了对比。结果显示，铂在氧化铝上的分散度更高，导致环己烷脱氢化反应活性增强。作者将这一现象归因于铂在氧化铝载体上更高的分散度。数据还表明，在铂表面覆盖度较高的氢吸附过程中（70%），吸附过程是放热的，对于氧化铝支持的催化剂，氢吸附到铂上的热量估计为每摩尔7-8 kcal。研究表明，支持物可以通过影响铂的分散度来影响铂的催化性能，但铂在环己烷脱氢化反应中的特定催化活性不受支持材料的影响。

The study focused on the chemisorption of hydrogen on platinum deposited on two different supports: alumina and silica-alumina. The researchers aimed to investigate the effect of the support on the degree of dispersion of the platinum. They found that the platinum was dispersed to a much higher degree on alumina than on silica-alumina. This dispersion was attributed to the higher activity of the platinum on alumina for the cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction. For the platinum-on-alumina catalyst, the adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at a surface coverage of 70% was estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole. Additionally, the study revealed that the adsorption of hydrogen on the platinum was essentially unity, indicating a high degree of dispersion of the platinum on the alumina support. These findings were confirmed through measurements of the rate of dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, showing that the platinum's catalytic activity was significantly influenced by the support's nature, specifically the alumina support.

研究专注于氢在铂沉积在两种不同支撑物（氧化铝和硅酸盐氧化铝）上的化学吸附。研究人员旨在调查支撑物对铂分散度的影响。他们发现，铂在氧化铝上的分散程度远高于在硅酸盐氧化铝上。这种分散被归因于铂在氧化铝上进行环己烷脱氢反应时的更高活性。对于铂-氧化铝催化剂，在70%表面覆盖度下，氢在铂上的吸附被估计为放热7-8 kcal/mole的程度。此外，研究表明，氢在铂上的吸附接近于1，表明铂在氧化铝支撑物上的高分散度。这些发现通过环己烷脱氢速率的测量得到证实，显示了支撑物性质（特别是氧化铝支撑物）对铂的催化活性有显著影响。

The research investigates the chemisorption and catalytic properties of platinum supported on two different supports, alumina and silica-alumina. The study highlights that the degree of dispersion of platinum on alumina is significantly higher than on silica-alumina. This dispersion is attributed to the platinum's higher activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation on alumina. The researchers estimate that at a moderate high surface coverage of 70%, the adsorption of hydrogen on platinum is exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole. The data suggests that the support used can substantially influence the results of hydrogen chemisorption, particularly for platinum. The study also includes the preparation of catalysts by impregnating the supports with chloroplatinic acid, followed by reduction in hydrogen. The adsorption of hydrogen on the platinum catalysts and supports is quantified through isotherms, which reveal differences in adsorption patterns between alumina and silica-alumina. The results indicate that the support affects the degree of platinum dispersion but does not exert any specific effect on the intrinsic catalytic properties of the platinum. The study provides insights into the relationship between support type, platinum dispersion, and catalytic activity.

研究探讨了氢在铂支持在两种不同的支撑物，氧化铝和硅酸铝上吸附的化学性质。研究人员旨在确定支撑物如何影响铂的分散度及其催化性能。他们通过将氯铂酸浸渍到支撑物中并还原在氢气中来制备催化剂，然后测量它们的化学吸附和催化活性。化学吸附结果表明，铂在氧化铝上的分散程度远高于在硅酸铝上。铂在氧化铝上对环己烷脱氢化反应的更高活性被归因于铂的更大分散度。研究还提供了在铂支持在氧化铝上吸附氢气的热量估计值，在适度高表面覆盖度下。结果表明，支撑物对金属分散度有显著影响，进而影响催化性能。然而，研究表明，支撑物的作用不仅局限于影响活性催化成分的表面积。
