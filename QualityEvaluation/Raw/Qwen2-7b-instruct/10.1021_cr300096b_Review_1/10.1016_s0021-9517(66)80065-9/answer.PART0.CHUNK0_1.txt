[1] "The effect of the difference in platinum dispersion on catalytic activity is shown by data on the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation to benzene over the two platinum catalysts. The data are given in Table 1."

[4] "The rates of dehydrogenation were deter- mined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quan- tity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x,where F represents the moles of eyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams. The activity of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst was about six times as high as that of the platinum on silica-alumina."

The study investigates the impact of different supports on the dispersion of platinum and its catalytic properties, specifically in the context of cyclohexane dehydrogenation. It compares the performance of platinum deposited on alumina versus silica-alumina supports. The results show that the platinum is more dispersed on alumina, leading to higher activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. The authors attribute the enhanced activity to the greater dispersion of platinum on the alumina support. The data also reveal that the adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is exothermic, with an estimated heat of adsorption of 7-8 kcal/mole for the alumina-supported catalyst. The study suggests that the support can influence the catalytic properties of platinum by affecting the dispersion of the metal, though the specific catalytic activity of platinum for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is not significantly affected by the support material.

研究探讨了不同载体对铂分散度及其催化性能的影响，特别是在环己烷脱氢反应中的应用。它将铂沉积在氧化铝和硅酸铝支持物上的性能进行了对比。结果显示，铂在氧化铝上的分散度更高，导致环己烷脱氢化反应活性增强。作者将这一现象归因于铂在氧化铝载体上更高的分散度。数据还表明，在铂表面覆盖度较高的氢吸附过程中（70%），吸附过程是放热的，对于氧化铝支持的催化剂，氢吸附到铂上的热量估计为每摩尔7-8 kcal。研究表明，支持物可以通过影响铂的分散度来影响铂的催化性能，但铂在环己烷脱氢化反应中的特定催化活性不受支持材料的影响。
