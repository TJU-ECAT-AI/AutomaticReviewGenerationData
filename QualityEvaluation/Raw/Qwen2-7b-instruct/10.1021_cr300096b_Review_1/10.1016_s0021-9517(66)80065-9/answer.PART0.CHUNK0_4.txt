[1] "The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the supports with chloroplatinic acid and were reduced in hydrogen prior to both the chemisorption and catalytic activity measurements."
[2] "The adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole."
[3] "In the case of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst, the number of hydrogen atoms adsorbed per platinum atom is essentially unity, corresponding to a high degree of dispersion of platinum."
[4] "Perhaps this is due to the much lower concentration of metal employed in the case of platinum (2% vs. 10%)."
[5] "However, it is possible that the more active platinum-on-alumina catalyst may have been limited to some degree by pore diffusion, so that the factor of 6 may be smaller than the true ratio of catalytic activities."
[6] "In other words, the specific catalytic activity of the platinum (rate per unit platinum surface area) for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is essentially unaffected by the support."
[7] "However, it should not be concluded that the role of the support is in general limited only to its effect on the surface area of the active catalytic component."

The study investigates the chemisorption of hydrogen on platinum supported on two different supports, alumina and silica-alumina. The researchers aimed to determine how the support affects the dispersion of platinum and its catalytic properties. They prepared the catalysts by impregnating the supports with chloroplatinic acid, reduced them in hydrogen, and then measured their chemisorption and catalytic activity. The chemisorption results showed that platinum was much more dispersed on alumina than on silica-alumina. The higher activity of platinum on alumina for cyclohexane dehydrogenation was attributed to the greater dispersion of platinum. The study also provided an estimate of the heat of adsorption of hydrogen at a moderate high surface coverage on platinum supported on alumina. The results suggest that the support has a significant impact on the dispersion of the metal, which in turn affects the catalytic properties. However, the study indicates that the support's role is not solely limited to affecting the surface area of the active catalytic component.

研究探讨了氢在铂支持在两种不同的支撑物，氧化铝和硅酸铝上吸附的化学性质。研究人员旨在确定支撑物如何影响铂的分散度及其催化性能。他们通过将氯铂酸浸渍到支撑物中并还原在氢气中来制备催化剂，然后测量它们的化学吸附和催化活性。化学吸附结果表明，铂在氧化铝上的分散程度远高于在硅酸铝上。铂在氧化铝上对环己烷脱氢化反应的更高活性被归因于铂的更大分散度。研究还提供了在铂支持在氧化铝上吸附氢气的热量估计值，在适度高表面覆盖度下。结果表明，支撑物对金属分散度有显著影响，进而影响催化性能。然而，研究表明，支撑物的作用不仅局限于影响活性催化成分的表面积。
