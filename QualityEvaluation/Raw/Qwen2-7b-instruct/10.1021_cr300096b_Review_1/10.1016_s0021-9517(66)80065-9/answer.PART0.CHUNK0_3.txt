[1] "The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the supports with chloroplatinic acid and were reduced in hydrogen prior to both the chemisorption and catalytic activity measurements."
[2] "The adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole."
[3] "In the case of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst, the number of hydrogen atoms adsorbed per platinum atom is essentially unity, corresponding to a high degree of dispersion of platinum."
[4] "The effect of the difference in platinum dispersion on catalytic activity is shown by data on the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation to benzene over the two platinum catalysts."
[5] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x."

The research investigates the chemisorption and catalytic properties of platinum supported on two different supports, alumina and silica-alumina. The study highlights that the degree of dispersion of platinum on alumina is significantly higher than on silica-alumina. This dispersion is attributed to the platinum's higher activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation on alumina. The researchers estimate that at a moderate high surface coverage of 70%, the adsorption of hydrogen on platinum is exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole. The data suggests that the support used can substantially influence the results of hydrogen chemisorption, particularly for platinum. The study also includes the preparation of catalysts by impregnating the supports with chloroplatinic acid, followed by reduction in hydrogen. The adsorption of hydrogen on the platinum catalysts and supports is quantified through isotherms, which reveal differences in adsorption patterns between alumina and silica-alumina. The results indicate that the support affects the degree of platinum dispersion but does not exert any specific effect on the intrinsic catalytic properties of the platinum. The study provides insights into the relationship between support type, platinum dispersion, and catalytic activity.

本研究探讨了两种不同载体上负载的铂的化学吸附和催化性质。研究表明，铂在氧化铝上的分散度远高于在硅酸铝上的分散度。这种分散性被归因于铂在氧化铝上的更高活性，用于环己烷脱氢化。研究人员估计，在70%的适度高表面覆盖率下，氢气在铂上的吸附是放热的，程度为7-8 kcal/mole。数据表明，所使用的支持可能对氢气化学吸附的结果产生重大影响，特别是对于铂而言。研究还包括将氯化铂酸浸渍到支撑材料中，然后在氢气中进行还原的过程。通过等温线量化了氢气在铂催化剂和支撑材料上的吸附，揭示了氧化铝与硅酸铝之间的吸附模式差异。结果表明，支撑物影响铂的分散度，但不对其铂的内在催化性质施加任何特定影响。本研究提供了关于支持类型、铂分散性和催化活性之间关系的见解。
