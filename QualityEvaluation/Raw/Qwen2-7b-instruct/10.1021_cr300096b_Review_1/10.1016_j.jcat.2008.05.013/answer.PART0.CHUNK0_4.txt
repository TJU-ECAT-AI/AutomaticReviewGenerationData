2.1. "The current study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of . This chamber was equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) with a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases."
2.2. "A Pt(111) single-crystal disk (99.999%, Metal Crystals and Oxides, Ltd., Cambridge), measuring 12 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in thickness, was spot-welded directly to two tantalum posts. The crystal could be resistively heated with a DC power supply to 1100 K or cooled with liquid nitrogen to 100 K."
2.3. "Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface was cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This was followed by oxygen dosing ( for 50 s) at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min."
2.4. "Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.20.3 ML/min."
2.5. "A break in the Fe and Pt intensities at around 300 s is indicative of deposition of the first ML of Fe, at an Fe/Pt AES ratio of 1.6."
2.6. "The surfaces were then heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition."
2.7. "The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements."
2.8. "A break in the Fe and Pt intensities at around 300 s is indicative of deposition of the first ML of Fe, at an Fe/Pt AES ratio of 1.6."
2.9. "Using a model of an atomically thin overlayer element (Fe or Cu) on a substrate (Pt), the calculated AES ratios were 1.7 for the Fe-Pt-Pt(111) surface and 1.8 for the Cu-Pt-Pt(111) surface, in general agreement with the experimental results."

The physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, particularly thermal evaporation, was employed to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments for this study. The experimental setup involved a two-level stainless steel UHV chamber with a base pressure of . This chamber was equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. A Pt(111) single-crystal disk was spot-welded to two tantalum posts, allowing it to be heated or cooled to temperatures ranging from 1100 K to 100 K using a DC power supply. Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface was meticulously cleaned using Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, followed by oxygen dosing and annealing at 1050 K for 5 minutes. To prepare the surfaces, a monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal was deposited at a rate of 0.20.3 ML/min. The deposition process was confirmed by AES measurements, with a break in the Fe and Pt intensities at around 300 seconds indicating the deposition of the first ML of Fe at an Fe/Pt AES ratio of 1.6. The surfaces were then heated at 3 K/s to high temperatures and AES scans were performed upon cooling to below 500 K to assess changes in surface composition. The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined using the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, with an accelerating voltage of 3 kV used in all AES measurements. AES scans revealed a break in the Fe and Pt intensities at around 300 seconds, indicating the deposition of the first ML of Fe. Additionally, the AES ratios for the Fe-Pt-Pt(111) and Cu-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces were calculated to be 1.7 and 1.8, respectively, in line with the experimental results.

本研究中，利用物理气相沉积（PVD）技术，特别是热蒸发，创建了在超高真空（UHV）环境下的双金属表面。实验装置包括一个带有压力为 的两层不锈钢UHV室。该室配备有原子发射光谱仪（AES）用于表征表面和四极质谱仪（MS）用于温度程序脱附（TPD）实验。一个Pt(111)单晶盘被焊接到两个钽针上，可以通过直流电源加热或冷却至1100 K至100 K的温度。在每个实验之前，通过600 K的Ne+溅射循环清洁Pt(111)表面，并随后在890 K下进行氧气剂量化和1050 K下5分钟的退火。为了准备表面，以每分钟0.20.3 ML的速度沉积一层3d金属。通过AES测量确认了沉积过程，大约在300秒时Fe和Pt强度的断裂表明了Fe的首次沉积，其Fe/Pt AES比率为1.6。然后将表面加热至3 K/s的高温度，并在冷却至低于500 K后执行AES扫描，以评估表面组成的变化。3d金属沉积量通过3d（LMM）/Pt（241 eV）AES峰-峰比确定，使用3 kV的加速电压进行所有AES测量。AES扫描显示大约在300秒时Fe和Pt强度的断裂，这表明了首次Fe沉积。此外，计算得到的Fe-Pt-Pt(111)和Cu-Pt-Pt(111)表面AES比分别为1.7和1.8，与实验结果一致。
