2.1. Preparation of bimetallic surfaces
The current study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of . This chamber was equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) with a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases.
2.2. TPD measurements
After the bimetallic surfaces were synthesized, hydrogen (Matheson, 99.999%) and cyclohexene (c-C6H10) (Aldrich, 99+%) were dosed on the surfaces at <150 K and <130 K, respectively. Hydrogen, along with neon and oxygen, were of research-grade purity (99.999%) and were introduced into the UHV chamber without further purification.

The physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, particularly thermal evaporation, was utilized in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber to synthesize bimetallic surfaces. The chamber was equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for TPD experiments. High-purity hydrogen and cyclohexene gases were dosed onto the surfaces at cryogenic temperatures to ensure the synthesis of high-quality metal overlayers. The purity of the dosed gases was confirmed through in-situ analysis within the UHV environment.
