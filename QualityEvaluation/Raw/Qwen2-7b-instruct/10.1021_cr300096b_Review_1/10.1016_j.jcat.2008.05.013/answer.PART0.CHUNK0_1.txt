<p>The current study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of . This chamber was equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) with a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases.</p>
<p>A Pt(111) single-crystal disk (99.999%, Metal Crystals and Oxides, Ltd., Cambridge), measuring 12 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in thickness, was spot-welded directly to two tantalum posts. The crystal could be resistively heated with a DC power supply to 1100 K or cooled with liquid nitrogen to 100 K.</p>
<p>Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface was cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This was followed by oxygen dosing ( for 50 s) at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min.</p>
<p>The surface was then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This was accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply.</p>
<p>Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.20.3 ML/min.</p>
<p>When the temperature of the Pt(111) was maintained at 300 K during deposition, the 3d metal remained on the surface. On the other hand, if the crystal temperature was elevated to 600 K during deposition, then the 3d metal began to diffuse into the subsurface region, with the first atomic layer being enriched in Pt.</p>
<p>Fig. 1 displays the change in the Pt and Fe AES intensities, along with the ratio of the Fe to Pt intensities, as a function of time at an approximately constant deposition rate.</p>
<p>In summary, 3d-Pt-Pt(111), or the surface configuration, is representative of 1 ML of the 3d metal on Pt(111) and was prepared by depositing 1 ML at 300 K. This surface was modeled as one layer of 3d metal on top of bulk Pt(111).</p>
<p>Deposition of 3d metals on Pt(111) at 300 K appears to follow the layer-by-layer growth mechanism, as indicated by the distinct breaks in Fig. 1 for Fe and Cu deposition and in previously published AES calibration curves for Ni and Co deposition.</p>
<p>The surface was relatively stable up to 550 K, after which the Cu/Pt ratio began to decrease steadily. For this reason, a temperature of 600 K also was used to create the Pt-Cu-Pt(111) surface alloy.</p>
<p>For the hydrogenation activity, cyclohexene was used as a chemical probe to determine the hydrogenation activity on these bimetallic surfaces.</p>

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) was utilized to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The process involved using a two-level stainless steel UHV chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for surface characterization and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. A Pt(111) single-crystal disk was spot-welded to tantalum posts and could be heated or cooled to various temperatures. Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface was cleaned using Ne+ sputter cycles and oxygen dosing at specific temperatures. A 3d metal was deposited on the surface using physical vapor deposition by wrapping a wire of the desired metal around a tungsten wire and directing the vapor onto the Pt(111) surface. The deposition rate was approximately 0.20.3 ML/min, with the surface being enriched in Pt at 600 K during deposition. AES was used to quantify the deposition of metals, showing distinct breaks at 300 K indicating layer-by-layer growth and at 600 K indicating diffusion into the subsurface region. The 3d-Pt-Pt(111) configuration represented a monolayer of 3d metal on Pt(111) deposited at 300 K, while the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) configuration represented bulk Pt(111) with the second atomic layer replaced by the 3d metal. The surface was heated to 600 K to create the Pt-Cu-Pt(111) surface alloy. Cyclohexene was used as a chemical probe to determine the hydrogenation activity on the bimetallic surfaces, revealing a volcano-type relationship between hydrogenation activity and cyclohexene binding energy, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) exhibiting the greatest activity.

物理蒸镀（PVD）技术在超真空环境中用于制备二元金属表面。该过程涉及使用两层不锈钢超真空室，配备有透射电子能谱仪（AES）和四极质谱仪（MS），用于表面表征和温度程序脱附（TPD）实验。一个Pt(111)单晶盘被焊接到钽柱上，并可以通过直流电源加热或用液氮冷却至不同温度。在每次实验之前，通过Ne+溅射周期和氧气剂量对Pt(111)表面进行清洁，在特定温度下进行氧气剂量处理。使用物理蒸镀方法在Pt(111)表面上沉积3d金属，通过将所需金属的线绕在一个钨线上并引导蒸汽到Pt(111)表面上来完成此过程。沉积速率约为0.20.3 ML/min，在600 K期间沉积时，表面会富集Pt。使用AES量化金属的沉积，显示在300 K时有明显的分段，表示层间生长机制，在600 K时表明扩散到亚表面区域。3d-Pt-Pt(111)配置代表了在300 K沉积在Pt(111)上的单层3d金属，而亚表面Pt-3d-Pt(111)配置代表了在顶部第二原子层替换为3d金属的bulk Pt(111)。将表面加热至600 K以创建Pt-Cu-Pt(111)表面合金。使用环烷烃作为化学探针确定了二元金属表面的氢化活性，揭示了氢化活性与环己烯结合能之间的火山型关系，其中Pt-Ni-Pt(111)具有最大的活性。
