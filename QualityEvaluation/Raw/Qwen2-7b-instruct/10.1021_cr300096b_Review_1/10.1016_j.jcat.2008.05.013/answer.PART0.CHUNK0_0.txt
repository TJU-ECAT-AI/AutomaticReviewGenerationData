Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a technique used in the creation of bimetallic surfaces within ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. In the context of this study, PVD involved the thermal evaporation of metals onto a substrate, specifically a Pt(111) single-crystal disk, to form bimetallic surfaces. The process begins with the preparation of a Pt(111) disk coated with a 3d transition metal, such as iron (Fe), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), or cobalt (Co), at room temperature. The deposition is conducted at a rate of 0.2 to 0.3 monolayers (ML) per minute, ensuring the formation of a monolayer of the 3d metal on the surface. To achieve the formation of a subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structure, the deposition temperature is increased to 600 K, which facilitates the diffusion of the 3d metal into the subsurface region of the Pt(111) surface. The deposition process takes place in a UHV chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for surface characterization and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. The AES provides real-time analysis of the surface composition during deposition, allowing for precise control over the deposition process and ensuring the purity of the deposited metal layers. The AES measurements confirm the formation of the desired metal layers on the Pt(111) surface, providing a quantitative measure of the deposition rates and the composition of the resulting bimetallic surfaces. The PVD technique enables detailed surface science studies by providing a controllable environment for the examination of surface properties and catalytic activities of the bimetallic surfaces. Key considerations for achieving optimal results include maintaining high vacuum conditions, precise control over deposition rates, and accurate measurement of surface composition to ensure the formation of the intended bimetallic structures.
