Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a technique used in the creation of bimetallic surfaces within ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. In the context of this study, PVD involved the thermal evaporation of metals onto a substrate, specifically a Pt(111) single-crystal disk, to form bimetallic surfaces. The process begins with the preparation of a Pt(111) disk coated with a 3d transition metal, such as iron (Fe), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), or cobalt (Co), at room temperature. The deposition is conducted at a rate of 0.2 to 0.3 monolayers (ML) per minute, ensuring the formation of a monolayer of the 3d metal on the surface. To achieve the formation of a subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structure, the deposition temperature is increased to 600 K, which facilitates the diffusion of the 3d metal into the subsurface region of the Pt(111) surface. The deposition process takes place in a UHV chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for surface characterization and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. The AES provides real-time analysis of the surface composition during deposition, allowing for precise control over the deposition process and ensuring the purity of the deposited metal layers. The AES measurements confirm the formation of the desired metal layers on the Pt(111) surface, providing a quantitative measure of the deposition rates and the composition of the resulting bimetallic surfaces. The PVD technique enables detailed surface science studies by providing a controllable environment for the examination of surface properties and catalytic activities of the bimetallic surfaces. Key considerations for achieving optimal results include maintaining high vacuum conditions, precise control over deposition rates, and accurate measurement of surface composition to ensure the formation of the intended bimetallic structures.

<p>A Pt(111) single-crystal disk (99.999%, Metal Crystals and Oxides, Ltd., Cambridge), measuring 12 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in thickness, was spot-welded directly to two tantalum posts.

<p>Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface was cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This was followed by oxygen dosing ( for 50 s) at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min.</p>
<p>The surface was then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This was accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply.</p>
<p>Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.20.3 ML/min.</p>
<p>When the temperature of the Pt(111) was maintained at 300 K during deposition, the 3d metal remained on the surface.

<p>The surface was relatively stable up to 550 K, after which the Cu/Pt ratio began to decrease steadily. For this reason, a temperature of 600 K also was used to create the Pt-Cu-Pt(111) surface alloy.</p>

AES was used to quantify the deposition of metals, showing distinct breaks at 300 K indicating layer-by-layer growth and at 600 K indicating diffusion into the subsurface region. The 3d-Pt-Pt(111) configuration represented a monolayer of 3d metal on Pt(111) deposited at 300 K, while the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) configuration represented bulk Pt(111) with the second atomic layer replaced by the 3d metal. The surface was heated to 600 K to create the Pt-Cu-Pt(111) surface alloy. Cyclohexene was used as a chemical probe to determine the hydrogenation activity on the bimetallic surfaces, revealing a volcano-type relationship between hydrogenation activity and cyclohexene binding energy, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) exhibiting the greatest activity.

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a method used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, particularly focusing on thermal evaporation. The process involves evaporating materials at high temperatures and depositing them onto a substrate under vacuum conditions. This method facilitates precise control over the deposition process, allowing for the creation of high-purity metal overlayers with well-defined compositions.

The experimental setup typically includes a UHV chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. The substrate, in this case, a Pt(111) single-crystal disk, is prepared by cleaning it with Ne+ sputter cycles, followed by oxygen dosing and annealing at high temperatures. The 3d metal is then deposited at a controlled rate, usually at a coverage of one monolayer (ML), using physical vapor deposition techniques.

Critical process parameters include the deposition rate, substrate temperature, and the choice of metal used. The substrate temperature affects the diffusion of the deposited metal into the subsurface region, while the deposition rate influences the uniformity and thickness of the metal layer. The purity of the deposited metal is ensured through the use of high-quality metal sources and precise control over the deposition conditions.

This method facilitates surface science studies by providing a means to precisely manipulate and investigate the properties of metal surfaces. Key considerations for achieving optimal results include the selection of appropriate metal deposition techniques, precise control over deposition parameters, and accurate characterization of the resulting surfaces. The UHV environment ensures minimal contamination, allowing for the study of surface phenomena under conditions closely resembling those encountered in real-world applications.

Achieving high-quality bimetallic surfaces through PVD requires careful attention to detail, including the choice of deposition conditions, monitoring of surface composition, and verification of purity through various analytical techniques. The results obtained from such studies can provide valuable insights into the behavior of surfaces and the mechanisms underlying various chemical processes, contributing to advancements in materials science, catalysis, and other fields.
