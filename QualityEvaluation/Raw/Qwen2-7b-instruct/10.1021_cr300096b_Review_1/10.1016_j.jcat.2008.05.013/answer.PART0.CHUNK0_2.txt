<p>The current study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of . This chamber was equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) with a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases.</p>
<p>A Pt(111) single-crystal disk (99.999%, Metal Crystals and Oxides, Ltd., Cambridge), measuring 12 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in thickness, was spot-welded directly to two tantalum posts. The crystal could be resistively heated with a DC power supply to 1100 K or cooled with liquid nitrogen to 100 K.</p>
<p>Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface was cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This was followed by oxygen dosing ( for 50 s) at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min.</p>
<p>The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements.</p>
<p>Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.20.3 ML/min.</p>
<p>Fig. 1 displays the change in the Pt and Fe AES intensities, along with the ratio of the Fe to Pt intensities, as a function of time at an approximately constant deposition rate.</p>
<p>The thermal behavior of 1 ML of Fe and Cu on Pt(111). Each of these metals was deposited at 300 K. The surfaces were then heated at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures, and AES scans were performed once the surfaces were cooled to below 500 K, to determine changes in the surface composition.</p>
<p>For the H2 TPD experiments, the hydrogen dose was 5 L for the Ni, Fe, and Cu surfaces and 10 L for the Co surfaces.</p>
<p>The binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene were studied using super cells containing four atomic layers, with the top two layers allowed to relax in each case.</p>
<p>The binding of cyclohexene was studied on hydrogen co-adsorbed surfaces. One cyclohexene molecule was bonded in the di-σ configuration on the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces, with the presence of two co-adsorbed hydrogen atoms in the super cell.</p>
<p>Fig. 4 shows that the HBE values were predicted to increase as the d-band center moved closer to the Fermi level, in agreement with trends for other surfaces noted in previous studies.</p>
<p>Fig. 5 compares these DFT trends with TPD results of hydrogen adsorption on the different 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces.</p>
<p>Fig. 7 shows the corresponding TPD results after cyclohexene was dosed on the Fe/Pt(111) surfaces with pre-adsorbed hydrogen.</p>
<p>Fig. 9 shows the comparison of TPD results of cyclohexene on hydrogen pre-dosed Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface structures.</p>
<p>In this case, the activity toward the formation of benzene on Pt-3d-Pt(111) is calculated.</p>
<p>These results clearly show that the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures are preferred over 3d-Pt-Pt(111) for hydrogenation reactions.</p>

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a method used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, particularly focusing on thermal evaporation. The process involves evaporating materials at high temperatures and depositing them onto a substrate under vacuum conditions. This method facilitates precise control over the deposition process, allowing for the creation of high-purity metal overlayers with well-defined compositions.

The experimental setup typically includes a UHV chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. The substrate, in this case, a Pt(111) single-crystal disk, is prepared by cleaning it with Ne+ sputter cycles, followed by oxygen dosing and annealing at high temperatures. The 3d metal is then deposited at a controlled rate, usually at a coverage of one monolayer (ML), using physical vapor deposition techniques.

Critical process parameters include the deposition rate, substrate temperature, and the choice of metal used. The substrate temperature affects the diffusion of the deposited metal into the subsurface region, while the deposition rate influences the uniformity and thickness of the metal layer. The purity of the deposited metal is ensured through the use of high-quality metal sources and precise control over the deposition conditions.

This method facilitates surface science studies by providing a means to precisely manipulate and investigate the properties of metal surfaces. Key considerations for achieving optimal results include the selection of appropriate metal deposition techniques, precise control over deposition parameters, and accurate characterization of the resulting surfaces. The UHV environment ensures minimal contamination, allowing for the study of surface phenomena under conditions closely resembling those encountered in real-world applications.

Achieving high-quality bimetallic surfaces through PVD requires careful attention to detail, including the choice of deposition conditions, monitoring of surface composition, and verification of purity through various analytical techniques. The results obtained from such studies can provide valuable insights into the behavior of surfaces and the mechanisms underlying various chemical processes, contributing to advancements in materials science, catalysis, and other fields.
