Surface science studies often utilize the physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, particularly thermal evaporation, to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. This method involves heating a solid material to a high temperature, causing it to sublime and deposit as a thin film on a substrate. Key experimental setups include a vacuum chamber equipped with a heated evaporation source, a substrate holder, and a vacuum pump system to maintain the UHV conditions.

Critical process parameters include the choice of metal, the substrate temperature, the rate of vapor flow, and the pressure within the vacuum chamber. High-purity metal overlayers are achieved through careful control of these parameters, ensuring minimal contamination and maintaining the integrity of the deposited film. Surface science benefits from PVD by enabling the study of atomic-scale properties, such as surface structure, composition, and interactions with other materials.

Optimal results are achieved by considering factors such as the compatibility of the metals being deposited, the deposition rate, and the stability of the film under various conditions. Proper selection and preparation of both the substrate and the evaporant material are crucial for obtaining high-quality bimetallic films suitable for applications in catalysis, electronics, and materials science research.

表面科学研究经常利用物理气相沉积（PVD）技术，特别是热蒸发，来在超高真空（UHV）环境中创建双金属表面。该方法涉及加热一种固体材料至高温，使其升华并沉积成一层薄层在基板上。关键实验设置包括配备有加热蒸发源的真空室、基板夹持器和用于保持UHV条件的真空泵系统。

关键过程参数包括所选金属的选择、基板温度、蒸汽流速以及真空室内的压力。通过仔细控制这些参数，可以实现高纯度金属覆盖层，确保最小化污染并维持沉积薄膜的完整性。表面科学得益于PVD，因为它允许研究原子尺度的属性，如表面结构、组成及其与其他材料的相互作用。

为了获得最佳结果，需要考虑金属沉积的兼容性、沉积速率以及薄膜在各种条件下的稳定性因素。正确选择和准备沉积物和基板材料对于获得适用于催化、电子学和材料科学研究的高质量双金属薄膜至关重要。

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) encompasses techniques for depositing materials as vapor, with thermal evaporation being a method where the source material is heated to evaporate. In UHV environments, the vapor condenses onto a substrate to form a film. The experimental setup involves a vacuum chamber, a heating element, and a substrate holder. Critical parameters include the source material, substrate temperature, deposition rate, and vacuum pressure. High purity metal overlayers are achieved by evacuating the chamber to very low pressures.
