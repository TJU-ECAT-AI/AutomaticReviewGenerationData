Physical vapor deposition (PVD) encompasses techniques for depositing materials as vapor, with thermal evaporation being a method where the source material is heated to evaporate. In UHV environments, the vapor condenses onto a substrate to form a film. The experimental setup involves a vacuum chamber, a heating element, and a substrate holder. Critical parameters include the source material, substrate temperature, deposition rate, and vacuum pressure. High purity metal overlayers are achieved by evacuating the chamber to very low pressures. This method supports precise control over film properties for surface science studies, requiring careful selection of materials, optimization of deposition conditions, and maintaining cleanliness throughout the process.
