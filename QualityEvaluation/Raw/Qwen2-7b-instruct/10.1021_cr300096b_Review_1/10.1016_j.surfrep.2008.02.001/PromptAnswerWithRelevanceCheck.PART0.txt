Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a key method used for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The PVD process involves the deposition of a metal overlayer using the line of sight deposition technique, which produces a metal layer on the target substrate. Critical parameters in PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and the deposition environment, typically in vacuum or with a selected gas background. PVD methods encompass various techniques such as magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation using a thermal filament. The evaporation filament is placed in a stainless steel cylinder with an opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate without contaminating the UHV systems. The source is conditioned for several hours at a slightly higher current or voltage than intended for the actual deposition. The desired bimetallic surface with a specific admetal coverage is achieved by positioning the single crystal substrate close to the metal source in the UHV system. The pressure during evaporation should be 5×1010 Torr or lower to prevent impurities from accumulating on the surface. The crystal temperature is often kept at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities like CO. The deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature determines whether the admetal overlayer stays at the surface or diffuses into the subsurface region. For instance, at 300 K, a monolayer of Ni atoms stays on a Pt(111) substrate forming the NiPt(111) surface monolayer, whereas a subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) is obtained by deposition at 600 K or post-annealing at 600 K from a 300 K surface.

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a key technique used in the synthesis of bimetallic surfaces, particularly in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, as favored by surface science studies. PVD methods, including magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation, enable the line-of-sight deposition of a metal overlayer on the substrate. Critical parameters such as metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and the deposition environment, including vacuum or a selected gas background, influence the deposition process. The metal source is often conditioned at a higher current or voltage than intended for deposition, taking several hours to achieve this state. The bimetallic surface with the desired admetal coverage is attained by positioning the single crystal substrate near the metal source opening. Maintaining the crystal temperature at 600 K during deposition minimizes impurity adsorption. Depending on the deposition or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal layer either stays at the surface or diffuses into the subsurface region. This phenomenon varies for different 3d metals on Pt(111) and will be further elaborated in Section 2.3.

1. The physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, particularly thermal evaporation, is used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The experimental setup involves evaporating one metal from a source and depositing it onto a substrate, often a single crystal, under UHV conditions to prevent contamination. Critical process parameters include the evaporation rate, substrate temperature, and vacuum pressure. To ensure high-purity metal overlayers, the substrate is typically cleaned thoroughly and the chamber is evacuated to remove any contaminants. Thermal evaporation facilitates surface science studies by providing a controlled environment for studying the properties of metal surfaces and interfaces. Key considerations for achieving optimal results include precise control over the deposition conditions, monitoring of the deposition rate, and careful analysis of the deposited films.

2. The method of thermal evaporation in PVD techniques allows for the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers on substrates by controlling the evaporation rate, substrate temperature, and vacuum pressure. This ensures that the deposited metals adhere well to the substrate and form a uniform film. The process is crucial for achieving optimal results in surface science studies because it allows for the examination of the properties of metal surfaces and interfaces under ultra-clean conditions, minimizing the risk of contamination. Factors such as the purity of the metal source, the quality of the substrate, and the precision of the deposition process all contribute to the success of the technique.

3. Thermal evaporation in PVD techniques is primarily performed on single crystal substrates, which allows for the creation of high-quality, well-defined metal surfaces. This approach facilitates detailed studies of surface properties and reactions due to the predictable and uniform nature of the crystal structure.

4. To bridge the materials gap between laboratory-scale experiments and industrial applications, systematic studies are needed to understand the formation and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces on polycrystalline substrates and within bimetallic nanoparticles. This includes exploring how the unique properties of bimetallic systems manifest on more complex geometries and under conditions that mimic industrial settings. Such studies aim to improve the reproducibility and scalability of bimetallic surface technologies, enabling their broader implementation in catalysis, electronics, and other fields.

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a technique used to deposit a metal overlayer on a target substrate. The process involves the evaporation of the metal in a vacuum chamber, where the metal atoms are then deposited onto the substrate. The PVD method is chosen for surface science studies because it is compatible with ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, which are essential for such studies. The deposition parameters, such as the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and the deposition environment, are crucial for obtaining a high-quality metal overlayer. Common PVD techniques include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the metal using a thermal filament. 

When studying bimetallic surface (MBS) structures, it is important to differentiate between the Frank van der Merwe growth mechanism, which leads to a layer-by-layer deposition, and the VolmerWeber (VW) mechanism, which results in 3D island growth. The growth mechanism can often be identified by analyzing the Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) or X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) intensities as a function of deposition time. At lower deposition temperatures, such as 300 K, the metal atoms may form a surface monolayer on the substrate, whereas at higher temperatures, such as 600 K, or after annealing at higher temperatures, the metal atoms may diffuse into the subsurface region.

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a method for depositing thin films by vaporizing a solid target and condensing the vapor onto a substrate. In thermal evaporation, a metal target is heated to a high temperature, releasing metal atoms that condense onto the substrate. To achieve high-purity deposition, the substrate is cooled to minimize contamination and control evaporation rates. The substrate is often placed on a cold finger, and the chamber is evacuated to high vacuum to prevent contaminant interference. Chamber walls may be coated for efficiency. PVD supports surface science by enabling the creation of controlled metal films. Optimal results are obtained by managing deposition rate, substrate temperature, and chamber pressure. Film quality is assessed with techniques like XRD and EDX.

[1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."
[2] "The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."
[3] "Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
[4] "Fig. 1 shows the typical experimental set-up of a metal source for the thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a 0.5 mm tungsten (W) wire, which is wrapped around with 0.1 mm wire of the metal of interest."
[5] "The extremely high melting temperature of the W filament allows the ultra-pure metal wire to evaporate without contamination from the tungsten."
[6] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with an opening of about 1 cm at the front face of the cylinder, to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto the UHV systems."
[7] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for certain amount of time to achieve the reproducible deposition of impurity free metal overlayer."
[8] "Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition."
[9] "Once the metal source is conditioned, the bimetallic surface with desired admetal coverage can be achieved by placing the single crystal substrate close to the opening of the metal source."
[10] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5×1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."
[11] "In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO."
[12] "Depending on the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal overlayer can either remain at the surface or diffuse into the subsurface region."
[13] "For example, at a deposition temperature of 300 K monolayer coverage of Ni atoms stay on a Pt(111) substrate to produce the NiPt(111) surface monolayer."
[14] "On the other hand, a subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) is obtained either by deposition at 600 K or by post-annealing the 300 K surface in vacuum to 600 K."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is the primary focus for depositing metal overlayers in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments for surface science studies. This method involves the line-of-sight deposition of metal vapor onto the substrate. Key parameters include the metal vapor flux rate, deposition time, substrate temperature, and deposition environment. Common PVD techniques encompass magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal filament evaporation. The metal source, consisting of a tungsten wire coated with the target metal, is heated to evaporation temperature and held for an extended period to deposit a pure metal layer. The substrate is positioned near the evaporation source in a UHV chamber with pressures below 5×1010 Torr to minimize impurity adsorption. Deposition temperatures dictate whether the metal layer remains at the surface or diffuses into the subsurface region.
