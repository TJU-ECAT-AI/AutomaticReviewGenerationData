[1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."
[2] "The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."
[3] "Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
[4] "For studying MBS structures, it is important to differentiate whether the metal atoms grow in a layer-by-layer mode, often referred to as the Frank van der Merwe growth mechanism as shown in Fig. 2 (a), or grow to form 3D islands in the VolmerWeber (VW) mechanism as shown in Fig. 2 (b)."
[5] "Depending on the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal overlayer can either remain at the surface or diffuse into the subsurface region. For example, at a deposition temperature of 300 K monolayer coverage of Ni atoms stay on a Pt(111) substrate to produce the NiPt(111) surface monolayer."
[6] "The utilization of both the calibration curves in Fig. 3 and Eq. (2.1) requires that the AES or XPS measurements of the substrate surface, with and without the metal overlayer, are performed with the sample at the identical location with respect to the AES or XPS spectrometer."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a common technique for depositing a metal overlayer on a substrate, particularly suited for surface science studies requiring ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. PVD methods, such as magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation, are employed. The process involves controlling parameters like the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and deposition environment. The growth of metal atoms can occur in a layer-by-layer mode, known as the Frank van der Merwe mechanism, or form 3D islands, following the VolmerWeber mechanism. The deposition temperature influences whether the admetal overlayer stays at the surface or diffuses into the subsurface region. Calibration curves and Eq. (2.1) are used to measure the precise thickness and coverage of the metal overlayer by ensuring consistent measurement locations for Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) or X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses.

物理蒸镀（PVD）是用于在基板上沉积金属覆盖层的一种常见技术，特别适用于需要超高真空（UHV）条件的表面科学研究。PVD方法，如磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射以及通过热丝蒸发的金属覆盖层沉积，被采用。该过程涉及控制参数，如金属蒸气流速率、沉积时间、基板温度和沉积环境。金属原子的生长可以以层状方式发生，称为范德梅尔弗兰克机制，或者形成三维岛屿，遵循沃勒-韦伯机制。沉积温度影响是否使吸附金属覆盖层停留在表面或扩散到亚表面区域。通过确保AES或X射线光电子能谱（XPS）分析的测量位置一致，利用校准曲线和公式（2.1）来精确测量金属覆盖层的厚度和覆盖率。
