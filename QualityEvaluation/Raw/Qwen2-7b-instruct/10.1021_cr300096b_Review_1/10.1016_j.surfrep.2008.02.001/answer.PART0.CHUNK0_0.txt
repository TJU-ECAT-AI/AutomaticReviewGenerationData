[1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."
[2] "The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."
[3] "Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
[4] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with an opening of about 1 cm at the front face of the cylinder, to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto the UHV systems."
[5] "Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition."
[6] "Once the metal source is conditioned, the bimetallic surface with desired admetal coverage can be achieved by placing the single crystal substrate close to the opening of the metal source."
[7] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5×1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."
[8] "In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO."
[9] "Depending on the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal overlayer can either remain at the surface or diffuse into the subsurface region."
[10] "For example, at a deposition temperature of 300 K monolayer coverage of Ni atoms stay on a Pt(111) substrate to produce the NiPt(111) surface monolayer."
[11] "On the other hand, a subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) is obtained either by deposition at 600 K or by post-annealing the 300 K surface in vacuum to 600 K."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a key method used for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The PVD process involves the deposition of a metal overlayer using the line of sight deposition technique, which produces a metal layer on the target substrate. Critical parameters in PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and the deposition environment, typically in vacuum or with a selected gas background. PVD methods encompass various techniques such as magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation using a thermal filament. The evaporation filament is placed in a stainless steel cylinder with an opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate without contaminating the UHV systems. The source is conditioned for several hours at a slightly higher current or voltage than intended for the actual deposition. The desired bimetallic surface with a specific admetal coverage is achieved by positioning the single crystal substrate close to the metal source in the UHV system. The pressure during evaporation should be 5×1010 Torr or lower to prevent impurities from accumulating on the surface. The crystal temperature is often kept at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities like CO. The deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature determines whether the admetal overlayer stays at the surface or diffuses into the subsurface region. For instance, at 300 K, a monolayer of Ni atoms stays on a Pt(111) substrate forming the NiPt(111) surface monolayer, whereas a subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) is obtained by deposition at 600 K or post-annealing at 600 K from a 300 K surface.

物理蒸汽沉积（PVD）是用于在超高真空（UHV）环境中制备二元金属表面的关键方法。PVD过程涉及通过视线沉积技术沉积金属覆盖层，该技术在目标基片上产生金属层。PVD合成的关键参数包括金属蒸气流速率、沉积时间、基片温度和沉积环境，通常为真空或带有选定气体背景。PVD方法涵盖了各种技术，如磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射和通过热丝蒸发物理蒸发金属。蒸发丝放置在不锈钢筒中，筒前端开口，以引导金属沉积到基片上，同时防止金属污染UHV系统。源需要在高于实际沉积时电流或电压几小时的条件下进行预处理。通过将单晶基片定位到金属源附近，可以实现具有特定合金金属覆盖度的二元金属表面。沉积过程中UHV系统的压力应为5×1010托或更低，以防止杂质在表面上积聚。通常在600 K下保持晶片温度，以减少CO等杂质的吸附。沉积温度或后沉积退火温度决定了合金覆盖层是在表面还是扩散到亚表面区域。例如，在300 K下，Ni原子在Pt(111)基片上形成一层单分子层，形成NiPt(111)表面单层；而通过在600 K下沉积或从600 K退火的300 K表面获得亚表面单层PtNiPt(111)。
