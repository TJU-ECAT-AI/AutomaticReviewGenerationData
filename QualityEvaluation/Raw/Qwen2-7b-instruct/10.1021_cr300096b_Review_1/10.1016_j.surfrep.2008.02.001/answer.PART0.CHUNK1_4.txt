Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a method for depositing thin films by vaporizing a solid target and condensing the vapor onto a substrate. In thermal evaporation, a metal target is heated to a high temperature, releasing metal atoms that condense onto the substrate. To achieve high-purity deposition, the substrate is cooled to minimize contamination and control evaporation rates. The substrate is often placed on a cold finger, and the chamber is evacuated to high vacuum to prevent contaminant interference. Chamber walls may be coated for efficiency. PVD supports surface science by enabling the creation of controlled metal films. Optimal results are obtained by managing deposition rate, substrate temperature, and chamber pressure. Film quality is assessed with techniques like XRD and EDX.

物理蒸镀（PVD）是一种通过蒸发固态靶材并将蒸汽凝结在基板上沉积薄膜的方法。在热蒸发中，加热金属靶材释放出金属原子，这些原子凝结在基板上。为了实现高纯度沉积，基板冷却以减少污染并控制蒸发速率。通常将基板放置在冷指上，并将腔室抽至高真空以防止干扰沉积过程的污染物。腔壁可能涂覆以提高效率。PVD支持表面科学，通过允许在基板上创建可控的金属薄膜。通过管理沉积速率、基板温度和腔室压力可获得最佳结果。薄膜质量可通过XRD和EDX等技术进行评估。
