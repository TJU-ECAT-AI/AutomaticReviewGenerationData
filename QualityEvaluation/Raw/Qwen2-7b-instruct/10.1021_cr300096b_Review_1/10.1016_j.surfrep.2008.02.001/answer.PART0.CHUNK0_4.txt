[1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."
[2] "The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."
[3] "Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
[4] "Fig. 1 shows the typical experimental set-up of a metal source for the thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a 0.5 mm tungsten (W) wire, which is wrapped around with 0.1 mm wire of the metal of interest. The W wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated using either DC or AC power supply."
[5] "Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition."
[6] "Once the metal source is conditioned, the bimetallic surface with desired admetal coverage can be achieved by placing the single crystal substrate close to the opening of the metal source."
[7] "In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO."
[8] "Depending on the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal overlayer can either remain at the surface or diffuse into the subsurface region."
[9] "For example, at a deposition temperature of 300 K monolayer coverage of Ni atoms stay on a Pt(111) substrate to produce the NiPt(111) surface monolayer."
[10] "On the other hand, a subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) is obtained either by deposition at 600 K or by post-annealing the 300 K surface in vacuum to 600 K."

Answer:

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a key technique used for depositing metal overlayers in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, particularly relevant for surface science studies. PVD methods include physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and electrochemical deposition. The focus in this review is on PVD, especially the thermal evaporation method, which is compatible with UHV conditions. Thermal evaporation involves heating a metal source to release vapor that deposits on the target substrate. The rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and deposition environment (vacuum or gas background) are crucial parameters in the synthesis process. Common PVD techniques include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal filament evaporation. The metal source typically consists of a tungsten wire wrapped with the metal of interest, heated to release vapor. The substrate temperature is usually kept at 600 K during deposition to minimize impurity adsorption. Deposition temperature and annealing temperature influence whether the metal overlayer stays on the surface or diffuses into the subsurface region. At 300 K, Ni atoms form a surface monolayer on Pt(111), while at 600 K, a subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) is created.

1.PVD是用于在超高真空（UHV）环境中沉积金属覆盖层的关键技术，特别是适用于表面科学研究。PVD方法包括物理蒸气沉积、化学气相沉积和电化学沉积。此评论的重点是PVD，特别是热蒸发法，它与UHV条件兼容。热蒸发涉及加热金属源以释放蒸汽并在目标基板上沉积。金属蒸发速率、沉积时间、基板温度和沉积环境（真空或气体背景）是合成过程中的关键参数。常见的PVD技术包括磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射和热丝蒸发。金属源通常由包裹有目标金属的钨丝组成，通过加热释放蒸汽。基板温度通常保持在600 K，以减少杂质吸附。沉积温度和退火温度影响金属覆盖层是在表面停留还是扩散到亚表面区域。在300 K时，Ni原子在Pt(111)基板上形成表面单层，而在600 K时，生成亚表面单层PtNiPt(111)。
