Physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques, particularly thermal evaporation, are used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. This process involves evaporating one metal onto a substrate while another metal is either already present or evaporated simultaneously. The experimental setup includes a UHV chamber with a vacuum system, a heating source for the metal, and a substrate holder capable of accommodating single crystal or polycrystalline materials.

Critical process parameters for thermal evaporation include the evaporation temperature, substrate temperature, chamber pressure, and deposition rate. Ensuring high-purity metals is essential for the quality of the resulting bimetallic films. To achieve this, the chamber must be evacuated to ultrahigh vacuum levels to eliminate contaminants. The substrate must also be cleaned thoroughly before deposition.

Bimetallic surfaces fabricated using thermal evaporation are indispensable for surface science studies, as they enable researchers to investigate the properties of interfaces and the behavior of molecules adsorbed on these surfaces. Understanding these properties is crucial for advancing the development of catalytic materials and surface modifications.

To attain optimal results, meticulous control over deposition conditions and real-time monitoring of film growth are necessary. Post-deposition treatments, such as annealing or exposure to reactive gases, may also be required to optimize surface properties.

物理蒸气沉积（PVD）技术，特别是热蒸发，用于在超高真空（UHV）环境中制备双金属表面。此过程涉及将一种金属蒸发到基板上，同时另一种金属已经在场或同时蒸发。实验设置包括一个配备真空系统的UHV室、加热源以及能够容纳单晶或多晶材料的基板保持器。

热蒸发的关键工艺参数包括蒸发温度、基板温度、室压和沉积速率。确保高纯度金属对于高质量双金属薄膜至关重要。为了实现这一点，必须将室腔抽至超高真空水平以消除污染物。基板在沉积前也必须进行彻底清洁。

通过热蒸发制备的双金属表面对表面科学研究至关重要，因为它们允许研究人员研究界面的性质以及吸附在这些表面上的分子的行为。理解这些性质对于先进催化剂材料和表面改性的发展至关重要。

为了达到最佳结果，需要精确控制沉积条件并实时监控薄膜生长。可能还需要后处理步骤，如退火或暴露于活性气体中，以优化表面性质。
