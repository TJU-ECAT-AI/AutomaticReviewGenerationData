[1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."
[2] "The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."
[3] "Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
[4] "Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition."
[5] "Once the metal source is conditioned, the bimetallic surface with desired admetal coverage can be achieved by placing the single crystal substrate close to the opening of the metal source."
[6] "In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO."
[7] "Depending on the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal overlayer can either remain at the surface or diffuse into the subsurface region."
[8] "This phenomenon is quite common for other 3d metals on Pt(111), although the diffusion temperature of the admetal layer varies for different 3d metals."
[9] "More about the preparation of surface and subsurface MBS structures will be discussed in Section 2.3."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a key technique used in the synthesis of bimetallic surfaces, particularly in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, as favored by surface science studies. PVD methods, including magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation, enable the line-of-sight deposition of a metal overlayer on the substrate. Critical parameters such as metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and the deposition environment, including vacuum or a selected gas background, influence the deposition process. The metal source is often conditioned at a higher current or voltage than intended for deposition, taking several hours to achieve this state. The bimetallic surface with the desired admetal coverage is attained by positioning the single crystal substrate near the metal source opening. Maintaining the crystal temperature at 600 K during deposition minimizes impurity adsorption. Depending on the deposition or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal layer either stays at the surface or diffuses into the subsurface region. This phenomenon varies for different 3d metals on Pt(111) and will be further elaborated in Section 2.3.

物理蒸气沉积（PVD）是合成双金属表面的关键技术，特别是在超高真空（UHV）环境中，这是表面科学研究的首选。包括磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射和通过热丝蒸发物理蒸发在内的PVD方法，允许沿视线在基板上沉积金属覆盖层。关键参数，如金属蒸气流速、沉积时间、基板温度和沉积环境，包括真空或选定气体背景，影响沉积过程。金属源通常在比预期的沉积电流或电压更高的状态下进行预处理，需要几个小时来达到这种状态。通过将单晶基板放置在金属源开口附近，可以获得具有所需前体金属覆盖层的双金属表面。在600 K的基板温度下进行沉积可最小化杂质吸附。根据沉积或后沉积退火温度的不同，前体金属层要么停留在表面，要么扩散到亚表面区域。对于在Pt(111)上的不同3d金属，这一现象各不相同，并将在第2.3节中进一步阐述。
