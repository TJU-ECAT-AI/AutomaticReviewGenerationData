Physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques enable the creation of thin films by evaporating a material and depositing it onto a substrate. Thermal evaporation involves heating a solid source to the point where it sublimates, releasing atoms or molecules that condense onto the substrate. In ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, the pressure is extremely low, typically less than 1 x 10^-8 Torr, to minimize contamination and ensure high-quality deposition. Critical process parameters include substrate temperature, deposition rate, and the choice of substrate holder and chamber. High-purity metal overlayers are essential to prevent impurities from contaminating the film and affecting its properties. Deposition rates must be controlled to ensure uniformity across the substrate. The choice of substrate holder affects the deposition angle and orientation, influencing the film's crystallinity and morphology. Chamber cleanliness is paramount in maintaining UHV conditions and preventing unwanted contamination. Achieving optimal results in PVD requires meticulous control over these parameters to ensure high-quality films.

物理蒸镀（PVD）技术通过蒸发材料并在基板上沉积，实现薄膜的制造。热蒸发涉及加热固体源，使其升华，释放出原子或分子，这些分子在基板上凝结。在超高真空（UHV）环境中，压力非常低，通常低于1 x 10^-8托，以减少污染并确保高质量沉积。关键过程参数包括基板温度、沉积速率以及选择基板支架和腔室。高纯度金属覆盖层是必不可少的，以防止杂质污染薄膜并影响其性质。必须控制沉积速率以确保在整个基板上的均匀性。选择基板支架影响沉积角度和方向，从而影响薄膜的结晶性和形态。腔室清洁度对于保持UHV条件并防止非预期污染至关重要。实现PVD的最佳结果需要仔细控制这些参数以确保高质量薄膜。
