Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a method for creating thin films by evaporating or sputtering a solid target material. Thermal evaporation specifically involves heating the source material to a high temperature, causing it to vaporize and condense onto the substrate. Critical parameters include substrate temperature, vapor pressure, and deposition rate. High-purity metal overlayers are crucial for high-quality films. UHV environments are necessary to prevent contamination and ensure good adhesion. Bimetallic surfaces generated through PVD are valuable for surface science studies due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. Optimal results are achieved through precise control of deposition conditions and thorough film characterization.
