[1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."
[2] "The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."
[3] "Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
[4] "Fig. 1 shows the typical experimental set-up of a metal source for the thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a 0.5 mm tungsten (W) wire, which is wrapped around with 0.1 mm wire of the metal of interest. The W wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated using either DC or AC power supply."
[5] "Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition."
[6] "Once the metal source is conditioned, the bimetallic surface with desired admetal coverage can be achieved by placing the single crystal substrate close to the opening of the metal source."
[7] "In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO."
[8] "Depending on the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal overlayer can either remain at the surface or diffuse into the subsurface region."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a common technique used for depositing metal overlayers, particularly in surface science studies requiring ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. PVD methods employ line-of-sight deposition to create metal overlayers on a substrate. Key parameters for PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and deposition environment, which can include vacuum or a background of selected gases. Techniques such as magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal filament evaporation of the metal are frequently used. The metal source is conditioned for hours at a slightly higher current or voltage than intended for deposition, ensuring purity. The substrate is positioned close to the metal source, and the crystal temperature is typically kept at 600 K to minimize impurity adsorption. The admetal overlayer can either stay on the surface or diffuse into the subsurface region based on the deposition or annealing temperature.

物理蒸气沉积（PVD）是用于在超高真空（UHV）条件下沉积金属覆盖层的常见技术，特别适用于表面科学研究。PVD方法通过线性视线沉积来创建金属覆盖层。PVD合成的关键参数包括金属蒸气流量速率、沉积时间、基板温度和沉积环境，可以包括真空或选定气体背景。常用的PVD技术包括磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射以及通过热丝蒸发金属的金属沉积。金属源需要在比实际沉积电流或电压稍高的电流或电压下进行条件处理，以确保纯度。将基板放置在金属源附近，晶体温度通常保持在600 K以减少杂质吸附。根据沉积或退火温度，金属覆盖层要么留在表面上，要么扩散到亚表面区域。
