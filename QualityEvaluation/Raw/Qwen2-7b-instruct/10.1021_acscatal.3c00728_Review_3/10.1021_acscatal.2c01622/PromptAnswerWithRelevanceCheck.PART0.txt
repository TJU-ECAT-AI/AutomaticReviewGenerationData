<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the unique architecture of these materials enhances their catalytic performance. This typically includes the presence of well-defined, interconnected pore networks that facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products, promoting efficient mass transfer and reaction kinetics. The dispersion of active sites within these frameworks ensures optimal utilization of the catalyst surface area, leading to enhanced activity and selectivity in catalytic processes.

2. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is often achieved through various methods such as covalent attachment, impregnation, or deposition-precipitation techniques. These methods have varying degrees of effectiveness depending on factors like the compatibility of the B component with the framework material, the desired distribution of active sites, and the specific catalytic application. For instance, covalent attachment can lead to strong and stable immobilization of B species, while impregnation might offer easier control over the loading of B onto the framework but could compromise stability under harsh conditions.

1. 分析硼基材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架的结构特征，涉及到理解这些材料如何通过其独特的架构增强催化性能。这通常包括明确的、相互连接的孔网络，它们有助于反应物和产物的扩散，促进有效的质量传递和反应动力学。这些框架中活性位点的分散确保了催化剂表面积的最大化利用，从而在催化过程中表现出增强的活性和选择性。

2. 将硼活性成分引入这些结构中通常采用各种方法，如共价结合、浸渍或沉积沉淀技术。这些方法的有效性在很大程度上取决于硼组件与框架材料的兼容性、期望的活性位点分布以及具体催化应用等因素。例如，共价结合可以导致强且稳定的硼物种固定化，而浸渍可能提供更容易控制硼负载到框架的能力，但可能在苛刻条件下损害稳定性。
