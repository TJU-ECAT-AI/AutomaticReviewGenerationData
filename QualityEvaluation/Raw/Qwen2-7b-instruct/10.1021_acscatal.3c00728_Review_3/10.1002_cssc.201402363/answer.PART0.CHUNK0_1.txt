Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these features enhance catalytic performance. The incorporation of B active components into these structures typically employs exsitu approaches. For instance, boron is often loaded onto carbon nanofibers (CNFs) by impregnating aqueous boric acid solutions, followed by calcination at a standard temperature in nitrogen atmosphere. This method allows for the dispersion of boron atoms throughout the porous framework, creating 3-D dispersed active sites. The effectiveness of this method varies depending on the boron loading and calcination temperature, which influence the speciation of boron and the catalytic conversion efficiency.

The study of B-CNFs reveals that boron loading and calcination temperature play crucial roles in determining the selectivity to propene. The type of heteroatom and the compound used as the precursor also impacts the selectivity, as they affect the deactivation of unselective oxygenated sites on carbon. In particular, the use of different precursors for P doping can lead to varying selectivities to propene, with triphenylphosphine being more effective in deactivating unselective sites while preserving selective sites.

Methods for incorporating B active components into porous frameworks generally involve chemical treatments such as impregnation, followed by thermal processing to stabilize the B species within the material. The effectiveness of these methods can vary depending on factors such as the precursor used, the loading amount, and the post-treatment conditions like calcination temperature. These methods are crucial for enhancing catalytic performance in applications requiring selective transformations of hydrocarbons, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The tailored dispersion of active B sites within the porous framework enables efficient reactivity and selectivity towards desired products, making these materials valuable for industrial processes.

分析硼基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔框架结构中的结构特征，涉及理解这些特性如何增强催化性能。将硼活性成分引入这些结构通常采用exsitu方法。例如，通过向水溶液中浸渍硼酸来加载硼到碳纳米纤维（CNF）上，然后在氮气气氛下进行标准温度的煅烧，这种方法允许硼原子在整个孔框架中分散，形成多维分散的活性位点。根据硼负载量和煅烧温度的不同，这些方法影响硼的物种和催化转化效率。

对B-CNFS的研究表明，硼负载量和煅烧温度在决定丙烯选择性方面起着关键作用。不同的杂原子类型和作为前体使用的化合物也会影响选择性，因为它们影响碳表面上无选择性氧化基团的失活。特别是，使用不同前体进行P掺杂可以导致丙烯选择性的差异，其中三苯基膦更有效地去除了无选择性基团，同时保持了选择性基团。

用于将硼活性成分引入孔框架的方法通常包括化学处理，如浸渍，随后是热处理以稳定材料中的硼物种。这些方法的有效性可能取决于诸如前体、负载量和后处理条件（如煅烧温度）等因素。这些方法对于需要选择性转化烃类的工业过程具有重要价值，如丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯。通过在孔框架内精确分散活性硼位点，可以实现高效的反应性和选择性，使这些材料成为有价值的材料。
