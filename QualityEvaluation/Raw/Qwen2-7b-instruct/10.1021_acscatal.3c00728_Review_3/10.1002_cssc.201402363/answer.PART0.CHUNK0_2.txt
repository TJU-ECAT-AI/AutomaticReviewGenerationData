[1] "For B-CNFs, the effects of boron loading and calcination temperature on B speciation and catalytic conversion were studied."
[2] "The P/C and O/C ratios determined by XPS (Table3) are much lower for 1.5%PTPP-CNF than 1.5%Pphosphate-CNF."
[3] "The N-CNFs prepared here are more active but less selective to propene than pristine CNFs."
[4] "In addition, the CO/CO2 ratio is larger for B- and P-doped CNFs, which suggests the pivotal role of groups that desorb CO in the catalysis of the selective dehydrogenation to propene in agreement with the literature."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these features enhance catalytic performance. Boron (B) is incorporated into these structures through various methods, including the exsitu approach where B is added after the synthesis of carbon nanofibers (CNFs). This allows for better control over the distribution and reactivity of B within the porous framework. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the desired application. For instance, the incorporation of B into CNFs can be optimized to improve the selectivity towards the formation of propene during oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This is due to the unique properties of B, such as its ability to modify the surface chemistry of CNFs, leading to the creation of more selective sites for the reaction. The study of B speciation and its impact on catalytic conversion provides insights into the optimal conditions for B loading and calcination temperature, which are crucial for enhancing the performance of B-based catalysts. In comparison, nitrogen (N)-doped CNFs, while showing enhanced activity in propane conversion, exhibit lower selectivity towards propene. This discrepancy can be attributed to the electronic effects of N, which influence the activation of oxygen molecules (O2) differently than boron or phosphorus (P). The CO/CO2 ratio being larger for B- and P-doped CNFs highlights the role of carbon oxides in the catalytic mechanism, indicating that the presence of these compounds is essential for the selective dehydrogenation to propene.

分析以三维分散活性位点的多孔框架为基质的B基材料的结构特征，涉及到如何通过这些特性提高催化性能。B通过多种方法被引入到这些结构中，包括在碳纳米纤维（CNF）合成后进行的exsitu方法。这允许对B在多孔框架中的分布和反应性进行更好的控制。这些方法的有效性因所需应用的不同而变化。例如，将B引入到CNF中可以优化以改善氧化脱氢过程中丙烷形成丙烯的选择性。这是由于B的独特性质，如其改变CNF表面化学的能力，导致了反应选择性位点的创建。B物种的分析及其对催化转化的影响提供了关于B负载量和煅烧温度的最佳条件的信息，这对于增强B基催化剂的性能至关重要。相比之下，氮（N）掺杂的CNF虽然在丙烷转换方面显示出增强的活性，但对丙烯的选择性较低。这种差异可以归因于N的电子效应，它以不同于硼或磷的方式影响氧分子的活化。B-和P掺杂的CNF中较高的CO/CO2比强调了碳氧化物在催化机制中的作用，表明这些化合物的存在对于选择性脱氢至丙烯至关重要。
