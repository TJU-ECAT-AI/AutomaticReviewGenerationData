[1] "For B-CNFs, the effects of boron loading and calcination temperature on B speciation and catalytic conversion were studied."
[2] "In that case, the conversion was promoted by enhanced ππ interactions of the ethylbenzene phenyl ring with the carbon basal planes."
[3] "The type of P precursor affects the selectivity to propene and that CNFs modified using triphenylphosphine as the precursor provided the highest selectivity at isoconversion."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the unique features of these materials enhance their catalytic performance. Boron (B) is incorporated into these structures through various methods, each demonstrating different effectiveness for distinct catalytic applications. The study of boron loading and calcination temperature impacts the boron speciation and catalytic conversion, suggesting that optimizing these parameters can significantly improve the performance of B-based catalysts. The ππ interactions between the ethylbenzene phenyl ring and the carbon basal planes in CNFs illustrate the role of surface interactions in enhancing catalytic efficiency. The use of different phosphorus (P) precursors influences the selectivity to propene, indicating that the choice of precursor is crucial for achieving optimal catalytic outcomes. Triphenylphosphine (TPP) is particularly effective in deactivating unselective oxygenated sites, leading to higher propene selectivity compared to ammonium phosphate. This highlights the importance of the interaction between dopant precursors and the material's surface in determining the catalytic performance.
