[1] "For B-CNFs, the effects of boron loading and calcination temperature on B speciation and catalytic conversion were studied."
[2] "For the same reaction temperatures and conversions, B- and P-doped CNFs exhibited higher selectivities to propene than pristine CNFs."
[3] "The N-CNFs were the most active but the least selective of the catalysts tested here."
[4] "The type of P precursor affects the selectivity to propene and that CNFs modified using triphenylphosphine as the precursor provided the highest selectivity at isoconversion."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these features enhance catalytic performance. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through various methods, including ex-situ approaches. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For instance, the study demonstrates that the type of boron loading and calcination temperature significantly influence the boron speciation and catalytic conversion in B-doped carbon nanofibers (B-CNFs). Moreover, the research highlights that B- and P-doped carbon nanofibers (CNFs) exhibit higher selectivities towards propene compared to pristine CNFs, under the same reaction conditions. The most active catalyst among those tested was N-doped CNFs, albeit with the least selectivity. Additionally, the study indicates that the choice of phosphorus precursor plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity to propene, with triphenylphosphine being particularly effective in deactivating unselective oxygenated sites while preserving selective ones.

分析以三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的B基材料的结构特性，涉及到理解这些特征如何增强催化性能。将B活性成分整合到这些结构中通常通过多种方法实现，包括离线方法。这些方法的有效性根据特定的催化应用而变化。例如，研究显示，硼负载和煅烧温度对硼物种和催化转化在B掺杂碳纳米纤维（B-CNF）中的影响显著。此外，研究表明，在相同的反应温度和转化率下，B-和P掺杂的碳纳米纤维（CNFs）对于丙烯的选择性高于纯CNFs。最活跃的催化剂是N掺杂的CNFs，尽管其选择性最低。此外，研究指出磷前体的选择对于确定丙烯选择性至关重要，特别是三苯基膦特别有效于去活无选择性的氧基团同时保持选择性。
