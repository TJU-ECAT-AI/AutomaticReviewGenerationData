Analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, explaining how these features enhance catalytic performance, and critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, discussing their relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications.

Structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks play a crucial role in enhancing their catalytic performance. These materials, known as carbon nanofibers (CNFs) modified with boron (B), exhibit unique features due to the incorporation of boron atoms into their framework. The presence of 3-D dispersed active sites within the porous structure allows for efficient access of reactants to the active sites, promoting faster and more efficient reactions. Boron doping modifies the electronic properties of the CNFs, leading to changes in the reactivity and selectivity towards specific chemical transformations. 

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures involve ex-situ approaches where boron is added post-synthesis, followed by calcination at various temperatures to alter the B speciation. The study found that the effects of boron loading and calcination temperature significantly influence the B speciation and catalytic conversion. For instance, higher boron loadings can lead to a wider pore size distribution, increasing the surface area and thus potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. However, the optimal loading and temperature must be determined to avoid excessive B deposition that could block the active sites.

The introduction of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) into CNFs also influences their catalytic properties. P doping brings about enhanced selectivity, whereas N doping results in higher activity but lower selectivity. The use of different precursors for P doping, such as triphenylphosphine and ammonium phosphate, leads to different P species on the CNFs, affecting their reactivity. In the case of N doping, the type of N and its content impact the selectivity to propene. The comparative study reveals that N-CNFs are more active but less selective than pristine CNFs, which contrasts with previous findings where N-doped carbon nanotubes were more selective.

The methods used to incorporate B, P, and N into CNFs are effective for enhancing catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The choice of method and the type of dopant can be tailored to achieve desired properties for specific catalytic applications. For instance, the B-CNFs with optimized boron loading and calcination temperature can maximize the propene yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The P doping using triphenylphosphine is particularly effective in deactivating unselective oxygenated sites, offering higher propene selectivities compared to ammonium phosphate.

In conclusion, the structural characteristics of B-based materials, along with the methods used for incorporating active components, significantly impact their catalytic performance. The optimization of these parameters can lead to the development of more efficient catalysts for various applications, including the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, where the goal is to achieve high selectivity and yield to propene.

分析硼基材料在三维分散活性位点的孔框架结构中的结构特性，解释这些特征如何增强催化性能，并批判性地评估将硼活性成分融入这些结构的方法，讨论它们在不同催化应用中的相对有效性。

硼基材料（碳纳米纤维，CNFs）的结构特性对于提高其催化性能至关重要。这些材料由于在其框架中引入硼原子而展现出独特的特性。三维分散的活性位点存在于孔结构中，允许反应物高效地接触活性位点，促进更快、更高效的反应。硼掺杂修改了CNFs的电子性质，导致特定化学转化的反应性和选择性的变化。

用于将硼活性成分融入这些结构的方法包括后合成的ex-situ途径，随后进行煅烧以改变B物种和催化转化。研究发现，硼负载量和煅烧温度对B物种和催化转化的影响显著。例如，更高的硼负载量可能导致较大的孔尺寸分布，增加表面面积，从而可能增强催化活性。然而，必须确定最佳负载量和温度，以避免过多的B沉积，这可能会阻塞活性位点。

向CNFs引入磷(P)和氮(N)也影响其催化性能。P掺杂带来增强的选择性，而N掺杂导致更高活性但更低选择性。使用不同的前驱体进行P掺杂，如三苯基膦和磷酸铵，导致CNFs上不同的P物种，影响其反应性。在N掺杂的情况下，掺杂的类型和含量影响丙烯选择性。比较研究表明，与未掺杂的碳纳米管相比，N-CNFS的活性更高但选择性较低。

用于将B、P和N融入CNFs的方法对于增强催化性能是有效的，为各种催化应用提供了增强的催化剂。选择方法和掺杂物类型可以被调整以实现所需的属性。例如，具有优化硼负载量和煅烧温度的B-CNFS可以最大化氧化脱氢过程中的丙烯产量。使用三苯基膦的P掺杂特别有效于消除非选择性氧基团，提供与使用磷酸铵相比更高的丙烯选择性。

总之，硼基材料的结构特性和用于融入活性成分的方法对催化性能产生重大影响。优化这些参数可以导致开发出更高效的催化剂，适用于各种应用，包括氧化脱氢丙烷，其中目标是实现高选择性和丙烯产量。

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these features enhance catalytic performance. The incorporation of B active components into these structures typically employs exsitu approaches. For instance, boron is often loaded onto carbon nanofibers (CNFs) by impregnating aqueous boric acid solutions, followed by calcination at a standard temperature in nitrogen atmosphere. This method allows for the dispersion of boron atoms throughout the porous framework, creating 3-D dispersed active sites. The effectiveness of this method varies depending on the boron loading and calcination temperature, which influence the speciation of boron and the catalytic conversion efficiency.

The study of B-CNFs reveals that boron loading and calcination temperature play crucial roles in determining the selectivity to propene. The type of heteroatom and the compound used as the precursor also impacts the selectivity, as they affect the deactivation of unselective oxygenated sites on carbon. In particular, the use of different precursors for P doping can lead to varying selectivities to propene, with triphenylphosphine being more effective in deactivating unselective sites while preserving selective sites.

Methods for incorporating B active components into porous frameworks generally involve chemical treatments such as impregnation, followed by thermal processing to stabilize the B species within the material. The effectiveness of these methods can vary depending on factors such as the precursor used, the loading amount, and the post-treatment conditions like calcination temperature. These methods are crucial for enhancing catalytic performance in applications requiring selective transformations of hydrocarbons, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The tailored dispersion of active B sites within the porous framework enables efficient reactivity and selectivity towards desired products, making these materials valuable for industrial processes.

分析硼基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔框架结构中的结构特征，涉及理解这些特性如何增强催化性能。将硼活性成分引入这些结构通常采用exsitu方法。例如，通过向水溶液中浸渍硼酸来加载硼到碳纳米纤维（CNF）上，然后在氮气气氛下进行标准温度的煅烧，这种方法允许硼原子在整个孔框架中分散，形成多维分散的活性位点。根据硼负载量和煅烧温度的不同，这些方法影响硼的物种和催化转化效率。

对B-CNFS的研究表明，硼负载量和煅烧温度在决定丙烯选择性方面起着关键作用。不同的杂原子类型和作为前体使用的化合物也会影响选择性，因为它们影响碳表面上无选择性氧化基团的失活。特别是，使用不同前体进行P掺杂可以导致丙烯选择性的差异，其中三苯基膦更有效地去除了无选择性基团，同时保持了选择性基团。

用于将硼活性成分引入孔框架的方法通常包括化学处理，如浸渍，随后是热处理以稳定材料中的硼物种。这些方法的有效性可能取决于诸如前体、负载量和后处理条件（如煅烧温度）等因素。这些方法对于需要选择性转化烃类的工业过程具有重要价值，如丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯。通过在孔框架内精确分散活性硼位点，可以实现高效的反应性和选择性，使这些材料成为有价值的材料。

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these features enhance catalytic performance. Boron (B) is incorporated into these structures through various methods, including the exsitu approach where B is added after the synthesis of carbon nanofibers (CNFs). This allows for better control over the distribution and reactivity of B within the porous framework. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the desired application. For instance, the incorporation of B into CNFs can be optimized to improve the selectivity towards the formation of propene during oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This is due to the unique properties of B, such as its ability to modify the surface chemistry of CNFs, leading to the creation of more selective sites for the reaction. The study of B speciation and its impact on catalytic conversion provides insights into the optimal conditions for B loading and calcination temperature, which are crucial for enhancing the performance of B-based catalysts. In comparison, nitrogen (N)-doped CNFs, while showing enhanced activity in propane conversion, exhibit lower selectivity towards propene. This discrepancy can be attributed to the electronic effects of N, which influence the activation of oxygen molecules (O2) differently than boron or phosphorus (P). The CO/CO2 ratio being larger for B- and P-doped CNFs highlights the role of carbon oxides in the catalytic mechanism, indicating that the presence of these compounds is essential for the selective dehydrogenation to propene.
