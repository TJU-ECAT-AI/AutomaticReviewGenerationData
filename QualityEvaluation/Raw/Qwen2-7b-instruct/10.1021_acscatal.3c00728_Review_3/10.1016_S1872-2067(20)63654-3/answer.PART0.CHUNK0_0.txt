[1] "Ordered macroporous materials have an extremely favorable architecture, which can improve mass transport, reduce diffusion limitations, and expose a large number of active sites."
[2] "Nevertheless, being thermodynamically unstable as well as sintering- or surface-inert, these materials are not suitable as active catalysts for high-temperature oxidative reactions."
[3] "Bulk metal-free oxides with thermally stable crystal structures can be potentially used in oxidation reactions, but are commonly associated with a low accessible surface area."
[4] "Considering the exposure of active sites in reactive processes, there is a pressing need to synthesize porous BPO4 crystals."
[5] "Moreover, mass and heat transfer issues are particularly important in the ODH of propane, because the highly exothermic nature of this reaction easily produces hot spots on the catalyst surface, in turn causing secondary reactions of the olefin products."
[6] "Based on the established understanding of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes catalyzed by boron-based catalysts, the BO (BOH) sites of edge-functionalized boron nitride and silica-supported B2O3 catalysts play a pivotal role in the production of olefins."
[7] "The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the ODH of propane."
[8] "This study provides a new strategy for improving the catalytic activity of metal-free oxides and offers a platform for investigating the composition and fracture of boron-based catalysts."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves examining how the architecture enhances catalytic performance. The materials feature an interconnected crystal framework that improves mass transport, reduces diffusion limitations, and exposes a large number of active sites. This design enables better exposure to reactive species, enhancing the catalytic activity. The incorporation of boron components into these structures typically involves hydrothermal-assisted synthesis, where boron compounds are mixed with templates to form porous frameworks. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For instance, in the case of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, the presence of tri-coordinated boron species on the surface of the material acts as active sites, facilitating the reaction. This study demonstrates a new strategy for improving the catalytic activity of metal-free oxides and provides insights into the composition and fracture of boron-based catalysts, contributing to advancements in catalytic science and technology.
