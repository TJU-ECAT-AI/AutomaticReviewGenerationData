[1] "An ordered macroporous boron phosphate crystals with a three-dimensionally interconnected ordered macroporous structure and a robust framework were fabricated and used as stable and selective catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane."
[2] "Due to the improved mass diffusion and higher number of exposed active sites in the ordered macroporous structure, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable olefin productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1, which is up to 2100 times higher than that of ODH catalysts reported to date."
[3] "The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the ODH of propane."
[4] "This study provides a route for preparing a new type of metal-free catalyst with stable structure against oxidation and remarkable catalytic activity, which may represent a potential candidate to promote the industrialization of the ODH process."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance through improved mass diffusion and a greater number of exposed active sites. These features facilitate easier access to reactive sites and improve kinetic diffusion, leading to higher yields and productivity. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through hydrothermal-assisted synthesis, which allows for the creation of an interconnected crystal framework. This method effectively incorporates B active components into the porous structures, making them highly effective for catalytic applications. The use of an ordered macroporous boron phosphate crystal framework, as demonstrated in this study, represents a novel strategy for improving the catalytic activity of metal-free oxides and provides insights into the composition and fracture of boron-based catalysts.

3-D分散在多孔框架中的B基材料的结构特征通过改善质量扩散和暴露更多的活性位点来增强催化性能。这些特性使反应物更容易接近活性位点，提高动力学扩散，并导致更高的产出和生产力。将B活性成分融入这些结构是通过水热辅助合成实现的，这使得能够在多孔结构中形成互连晶格框架。这种方法有效地将B活性成分融入多孔结构中，使其成为催化应用的有效催化剂。如本研究中所展示的有序多孔硼磷酸晶体框架代表了一种改进无金属氧化物催化活性的新策略，并提供了关于硼基催化剂组成和断裂的见解。
