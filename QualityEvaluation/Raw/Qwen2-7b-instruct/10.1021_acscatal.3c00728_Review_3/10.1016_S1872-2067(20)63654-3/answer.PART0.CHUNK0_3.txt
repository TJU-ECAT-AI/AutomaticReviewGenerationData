[1] "An ordered macroporous and metal-free BPO4 material with an interconnected crystal framework has been prepared by hydrothermal-assisted synthesis."
[2] "The material showed excellent catalytic performance in the ODH of propane to propene, as evidenced by high propane conversion, high propene selectivity, and low CO2 emission."
[3] "The olefin productivity of BPO4 was much higher than that of reported boron-containing catalysts [ 15 ,16 ,17 ,18 ,19 ,20 ]."
[4] "Structural characterizations revealed that the ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited a remarkable structural stability, and the tri-coordinated BO surface species incorporated in the framework were responsible for catalyzing the ODH reaction of propane."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by improving mass transport and exposing a large number of active sites. This allows for faster reaction kinetics and higher selectivity. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as hydrothermal-assisted synthesis, are effective for creating materials with interconnected crystal frameworks that exhibit excellent stability and catalytic activity. These materials are particularly advantageous for applications requiring high productivity and selectivity, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.
