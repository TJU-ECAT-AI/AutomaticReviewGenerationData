Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, we find that the incorporation of boron (B) active components into these structures significantly enhances catalytic performance. The key features contributing to this enhancement are the three-dimensional (3D) dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, which improve mass transport and expose a large number of active sites. The hydrothermal-assisted synthesis method used to prepare the materials allows for the creation of a robust framework with interconnected macropores, facilitating rapid mass transport and providing a large surface area for the active sites.

The effectiveness of the B active components is demonstrated by their ability to catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propene. The tri-coordinated boron species, identified as the active catalytic sites, are crucial for activating gaseous oxygen and participating in the dehydrogenation of alkanes. These sites exhibit remarkable structural stability, as evidenced by the stability of the catalyst's framework and the retention of the active boron species throughout the catalytic process. The enhanced performance of these materials, as measured by high propane conversion, high propene selectivity, and low CO2 emission, underscores the potential of this strategy for improving the catalytic activity of metal-free oxides and advancing the investigation of boron-based catalysts.

In conclusion, the incorporation of B active components into porous frameworks with 3-D dispersed active sites through hydrothermal-assisted synthesis enables the creation of materials with exceptional catalytic performance. The tri-coordinated boron species serve as the active catalytic sites, demonstrating their effectiveness in controlling the reaction mechanisms and enhancing the overall catalytic efficiency. This approach offers a promising avenue for developing advanced catalysts for various industrial applications.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, we find that these materials significantly enhance catalytic performance through several mechanisms. The ordered macroporous architecture improves mass transport and reduces diffusion limitations, thereby exposing a large number of active sites. This is crucial for high-temperature oxidative reactions, where surface accessibility plays a critical role. Metal-free oxides, especially those with thermally stable crystal structures like boron phosphate (BPO4), offer the potential for use as catalysts in oxidation reactions due to their stability and low surface inertness. However, they are often limited by their low accessible surface area. To overcome this challenge, creating porous structures within these materials is an effective strategy. This allows for the incorporation of active components, enhancing the surface area and reactivity.

BPO4, composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra, is highlighted for its superior thermal stability and oxidation resistance. Its porous structure facilitates the exposure of active sites, crucial for catalytic reactions. The high thermal conductivity of BPO4, combined with improved mass transfer, is expected to lead to a catalyst with excellent selectivity and productivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. 

The use of BPO4 in this context resulted in a much higher olefin productivity compared to reported boron-containing catalysts. The ordered macroporous framework of BPO4 demonstrated remarkable structural stability, with the tri-coordinated BO surface species identified as the active sites responsible for the ODH reaction of propane. This highlights the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into porous frameworks for enhanced catalytic performance, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

分析具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征，我们发现这些材料通过几种机制显著提高了催化性能。有序多孔结构改善了质量传输并减少了扩散限制，从而暴露了大量的活性位点。这对于高温氧化反应至关重要，表面可接近性是关键因素。无金属氧化物，特别是具有良好热稳定晶格结构的氧化物（如硼磷酸盐（BPO4）），由于其稳定性和低表面惰性，在氧化反应中作为催化剂的潜力很大。然而，它们常常受限于较低的表面积。为了克服这一挑战，创建这些材料内的多孔结构是一种有效策略。这允许活性成分的集成，增加了表面积和反应活性。

BPO4由角共享BO4和PO4四面体组成，因其出色的热稳定性和氧化稳定性而受到关注。其多孔结构有助于暴露活性位点，对于催化反应至关重要。BPO4的高热导率，结合改进的质量传输，预期将导致一种在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中具有优异选择性和生产力的新类型金属自由硼基催化剂。

在此背景下使用BPO4的结果表明，与报告的硼基催化剂相比，其烯烃产率要高得多。BPO4的有序多孔框架显示出非凡的结构稳定性，其中三协同BO表面物种被确定为催化丙烷ODH反应的活性位点。这强调了在多孔框架中集成B活性成分以提高催化性能的有效性，尤其是在氧化脱氢反应中。
