Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, we find that the incorporation of boron (B) active components into these structures significantly enhances catalytic performance. The key features contributing to this enhancement are the three-dimensional (3D) dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, which improve mass transport and expose a large number of active sites. The hydrothermal-assisted synthesis method used to prepare the materials allows for the creation of a robust framework with interconnected macropores, facilitating rapid mass transport and providing a large surface area for the active sites.

The effectiveness of the B active components is demonstrated by their ability to catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propene. The tri-coordinated boron species, identified as the active catalytic sites, are crucial for activating gaseous oxygen and participating in the dehydrogenation of alkanes. These sites exhibit remarkable structural stability, as evidenced by the stability of the catalyst's framework and the retention of the active boron species throughout the catalytic process. The enhanced performance of these materials, as measured by high propane conversion, high propene selectivity, and low CO2 emission, underscores the potential of this strategy for improving the catalytic activity of metal-free oxides and advancing the investigation of boron-based catalysts.

In conclusion, the incorporation of B active components into porous frameworks with 3-D dispersed active sites through hydrothermal-assisted synthesis enables the creation of materials with exceptional catalytic performance. The tri-coordinated boron species serve as the active catalytic sites, demonstrating their effectiveness in controlling the reaction mechanisms and enhancing the overall catalytic efficiency. This approach offers a promising avenue for developing advanced catalysts for various industrial applications.
