[1] "B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks have shown enhanced catalytic performance due to the high surface area and accessibility of the active sites."
[2] "The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or sol-gel methods, which offer varying degrees of control over the structure and composition."
[3] "For different catalytic applications, the effectiveness of these methods depends on factors such as the desired size distribution of the active sites, the stability under reaction conditions, and the compatibility with downstream processing steps."

1. B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit improved catalytic performance because of their large surface area and ease of access to the active sites.
2. B active components are commonly integrated into these structures via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or sol-gel techniques, which provide differing levels of control over the structure and composition.
3. The efficiency of these methods for different catalytic uses varies based on aspects including the targeted size distribution of the active sites, their stability under operational conditions, and their alignment with subsequent processing stages.
