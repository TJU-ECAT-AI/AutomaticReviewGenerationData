[1] "The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance their catalytic performance due to increased surface area and better accessibility of reactants."
[2] "The incorporation of B active components into these structures can be achieved through various methods such as impregnation, co-precipitation, and sonochemical synthesis."
[3] "Methods like impregnation are effective for homogeneous catalysts, whereas co-precipitation is suitable for heterogeneous catalysts, depending on the specific application."
