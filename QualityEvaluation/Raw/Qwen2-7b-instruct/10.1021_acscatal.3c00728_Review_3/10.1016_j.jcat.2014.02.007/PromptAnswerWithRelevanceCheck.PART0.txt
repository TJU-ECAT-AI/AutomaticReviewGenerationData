<p>The strength of acid sites can be measured using heats of adsorption of bases such as ammonia, pyridine, and acetonitrile. The heats of adsorption for ammonia and pyridine are similar for both H-[Fe] and H-[Al]ZSM-5 (145 kJ mol1 for ammonia and 195-200 kJ mol1 for pyridine), and the heat of adsorption of acetonitrile for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (95 kJ mol1) is slightly less than that for H-[Al]ZSM-5 (110 kJ mol1).</p>
<p>The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenation-to-cracking ratio 0.36).</p>
<p>A redox catalytic cycle is suggested for the hydrocarbon reaction over isolated Fe framework sites in [Fe] zeolites via the formation of propane radical cations since a protolytic mechanism seems to be unable to explain the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity.</p>
<p>[Fe] ZSM-5 samples with Si/Fe ratios of 26 and 48, and [Fe]beta zeolite (BEA*) with Si/Fe ratio of 15 were synthesized and characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption and ultraviolet-visible (UV/Visible) spectroscopy.</p>

The iron-silicate zeolites demonstrated significantly higher dehydrogenation rates compared to cracking rates, indicating their enhanced catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation. This selectivity is notably superior to that of aluminum-silicate zeolites with similar Si/Al ratios. The proposed redox catalytic cycle explains the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity, suggesting a mechanism distinct from the protolytic reaction typically associated with acid sites in zeolites. The synthesis of these iron-silicate zeolites involved careful control of the Si/Fe ratios and characterization through X-ray powder diffraction, N2 adsorption, and UV/Visible spectroscopy to ensure optimal catalytic properties.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for reactions, facilitating diffusion of reactants and products, and enabling efficient use of active sites. This allows for faster reaction rates and higher yields compared to traditional catalysts. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through ion-exchange methods, which effectively embeds the B species within the porous framework. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application; for instance, in the context of dehydrogenation reactions, the presence of B in the 3-D dispersed active sites leads to improved selectivity and activity due to its unique electronic properties and ability to facilitate redox reactions. This results in enhanced catalytic performance for various applications, including the conversion of hydrocarbons into more valuable chemicals.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance. The presence of B active components in these structures enables a high degree of dispersion, which leads to efficient utilization of the active sites. This feature allows for a larger surface area and more accessible active sites, thus improving the overall catalytic efficiency. The incorporation of B active components into these structures typically involves methods such as impregnation, co-precipitation, or ion-exchange. Each method has its relative effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application. For instance, impregnation might be more suitable for applications requiring high loading of B, whereas co-precipitation could offer better control over the dispersion of B. The choice of method depends on factors such as the desired level of B dispersion, the stability of the B component within the material, and the desired properties of the final catalyst.

The study highlights that iron-silicate zeolites display superior selectivity and efficiency in propane dehydrogenation compared to aluminum-silicate zeolites. This is due to the unique structural characteristics of the iron atoms within these materials, which migrate from framework to extra-framework positions under specific conditions. The isolated framework iron sites play a crucial role in hydrocarbon conversion processes, exhibiting higher dehydrogenation rates and lower activation energies compared to aluminum counterparts. Moreover, the redox catalytic cycle proposed for these iron sites offers a plausible explanation for the distinct activation energy and selectivity observed in the dehydrogenation process, differing from the protolytic mechanisms typically associated with aluminum zeolites.

研究表明，铁硅酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢方面的选择性和效率明显优于铝硅酸盐沸石。这主要归功于材料中铁原子的独特结构特性，这些铁原子在特定条件下从骨架位置迁移至额外框架位置。孤立的骨架铁位点对烃类转化过程至关重要，表现出较高的脱氢速率和较低的活化能。此外，对于这些铁位点上发生的烃反应，提出的原电池催化循环为解释观察到的激活能和选择性差异提供了一个合理的解释，与铝基沸石上的质子转移机制形成鲜明对比。

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are crucial for enhancing catalytic performance. These materials typically feature a well-defined pore structure, which facilitates the diffusion of reactants and products. The 3-D dispersion of active sites ensures a high surface area, which increases the probability of contact between the catalyst and the reactants. This leads to improved efficiency and selectivity in various catalytic processes. The incorporation of B active components into these structures often involves techniques such as ion exchange or co-precipitation. Ion exchange allows for the replacement of a specific ion within the zeolite framework with B, creating active sites. Co-precipitation involves the simultaneous precipitation of B along with other components, leading to its distribution throughout the material. Both methods have their relative effectiveness depending on the specific application and desired properties of the catalyst.
