[1] "Unit cell volumes, determined using XRD, were used to monitor the presence of Fe in the framework and the migration of Fe species from framework to extra-framework positions."
[2] "The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenation-to-cracking ratio 0.36)."
[3] "Isolated framework Fe sites are the most important sites for hydrocarbon conversion even though Fe species in extra-framework positions also showed catalytic activity for dehydrogenation."
[4] "A redox cycle is suggested for the hydrocarbon reaction over isolated Fe framework sites in [Fe] zeolites via the formation of propane radical cations since a protolytic mechanism seems to be unable to explain the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for reactions, facilitating diffusion of reactants and products, and enabling efficient use of active sites. This allows for faster reaction rates and higher yields compared to traditional catalysts. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through ion-exchange methods, which effectively embeds the B species within the porous framework. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application; for instance, in the context of dehydrogenation reactions, the presence of B in the 3-D dispersed active sites leads to improved selectivity and activity due to its unique electronic properties and ability to facilitate redox reactions. This results in enhanced catalytic performance for various applications, including the conversion of hydrocarbons into more valuable chemicals.

B基材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构的结构特征通过提供更大的反应表面，促进反应物和产物的扩散以及有效利用活性位点，从而提高了催化性能。这使得反应速率更快且产率更高，与传统催化剂相比。将B活性成分引入这些结构通常是通过离子交换方法实现的，这种方法有效地在多孔框架中嵌入了B物种。根据具体的应用，这些方法的有效性有所不同；例如，在脱氢反应的背景下，由于B的特殊电子性质和促进氧化还原反应的能力，其在三维分散活性位点的存在导致了改进的选择性和活性，从而提高了各种应用（如烃类转化）的催化性能。
