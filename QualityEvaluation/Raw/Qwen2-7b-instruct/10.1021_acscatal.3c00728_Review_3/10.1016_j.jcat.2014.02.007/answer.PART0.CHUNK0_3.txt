[1] "Most of the Fe atoms remain in framework positions after mild calcination (753 K in air), but most of the Fe species migrate to extra-framework positions after steaming at 973 K."
[2] "Isolated framework Fe sites are the most important sites for hydrocarbon conversion even though Fe species in extra-framework positions also showed catalytic activity for dehydrogenation."
[3] "The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenation-to-cracking ratio 0.36)."
[4] "A redox cycle is suggested for the hydrocarbon reaction over isolated Fe framework sites in [Fe] zeolites via the formation of propane radical cations since a protolytic mechanism seems to be unable to explain the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity."

The study highlights that iron-silicate zeolites display superior selectivity and efficiency in propane dehydrogenation compared to aluminum-silicate zeolites. This is due to the unique structural characteristics of the iron atoms within these materials, which migrate from framework to extra-framework positions under specific conditions. The isolated framework iron sites play a crucial role in hydrocarbon conversion processes, exhibiting higher dehydrogenation rates and lower activation energies compared to aluminum counterparts. Moreover, the redox catalytic cycle proposed for these iron sites offers a plausible explanation for the distinct activation energy and selectivity observed in the dehydrogenation process, differing from the protolytic mechanisms typically associated with aluminum zeolites.

研究表明，铁硅酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢方面的选择性和效率明显优于铝硅酸盐沸石。这主要归功于材料中铁原子的独特结构特性，这些铁原子在特定条件下从骨架位置迁移至额外框架位置。孤立的骨架铁位点对烃类转化过程至关重要，表现出较高的脱氢速率和较低的活化能。此外，对于这些铁位点上发生的烃反应，提出的原电池催化循环为解释观察到的激活能和选择性差异提供了一个合理的解释，与铝基沸石上的质子转移机制形成鲜明对比。
