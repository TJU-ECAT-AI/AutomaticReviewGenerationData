[1] "Most of the Fe atoms remain in framework positions after mild calcination (753 K in air), but most of the Fe species migrate to extra-framework positions after steaming at 973 K."
[2] "Isolated framework Fe sites are the most important sites for hydrocarbon conversion even though Fe species in extra-framework positions also showed catalytic activity for dehydrogenation."
[3] "The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenation-to-cracking ratio 0.36)."
[4] "A redox catalytic cycle is suggested for the hydrocarbon reaction over isolated Fe framework sites in [Fe] zeolites via the formation of propane radical cations since a protolytic mechanism seems to be unable to explain the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance. The presence of B active components in these structures enables a high degree of dispersion, which leads to efficient utilization of the active sites. This feature allows for a larger surface area and more accessible active sites, thus improving the overall catalytic efficiency. The incorporation of B active components into these structures typically involves methods such as impregnation, co-precipitation, or ion-exchange. Each method has its relative effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application. For instance, impregnation might be more suitable for applications requiring high loading of B, whereas co-precipitation could offer better control over the dispersion of B. The choice of method depends on factors such as the desired level of B dispersion, the stability of the B component within the material, and the desired properties of the final catalyst.

B基材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构的结构特征显著提高了催化性能。这些结构中的B活性组分的存在能够实现高度分散，从而提高活性位点的有效利用。这一特性允许更大的表面积和更易访问的活性位点，从而改善整体催化效率。将B活性组分引入这些结构通常涉及浸渍、共沉淀或离子交换等方法。每种方法在不同的催化应用中都有其相对有效性。例如，浸渍可能更适合需要高B负载的应用，而共沉淀则能提供更好的B分散控制。选择方法取决于所需B分散程度、B组分在材料中的稳定性以及最终催化剂的预期性质等因素。
