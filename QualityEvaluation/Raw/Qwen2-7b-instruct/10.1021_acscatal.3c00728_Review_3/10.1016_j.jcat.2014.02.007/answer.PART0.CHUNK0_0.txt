<p>The strength of acid sites can be measured using heats of adsorption of bases such as ammonia, pyridine, and acetonitrile. The heats of adsorption for ammonia and pyridine are similar for both H-[Fe] and H-[Al]ZSM-5 (145 kJ mol1 for ammonia and 195-200 kJ mol1 for pyridine), and the heat of adsorption of acetonitrile for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (95 kJ mol1) is slightly less than that for H-[Al]ZSM-5 (110 kJ mol1).</p>
<p>The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenation-to-cracking ratio 0.36).</p>
<p>A redox catalytic cycle is suggested for the hydrocarbon reaction over isolated Fe framework sites in [Fe] zeolites via the formation of propane radical cations since a protolytic mechanism seems to be unable to explain the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity.</p>
<p>[Fe] ZSM-5 samples with Si/Fe ratios of 26 and 48, and [Fe]beta zeolite (BEA*) with Si/Fe ratio of 15 were synthesized and characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption and ultraviolet-visible (UV/Visible) spectroscopy.</p>

The iron-silicate zeolites demonstrated significantly higher dehydrogenation rates compared to cracking rates, indicating their enhanced catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation. This selectivity is notably superior to that of aluminum-silicate zeolites with similar Si/Al ratios. The proposed redox catalytic cycle explains the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity, suggesting a mechanism distinct from the protolytic reaction typically associated with acid sites in zeolites. The synthesis of these iron-silicate zeolites involved careful control of the Si/Fe ratios and characterization through X-ray powder diffraction, N2 adsorption, and UV/Visible spectroscopy to ensure optimal catalytic properties.

铁硅酸盐沸石显示出显著更高的脱氢速率与裂解速率相比，表明它们在丙烷脱氢方面的催化性能更优。这种选择性明显优于具有相似Si/Al比例的铝硅酸盐沸石。提议的氧化还原催化循环解释了观察到的活化能和选择性的差异，暗示了一种不同于铝沸石上通常与酸位相关的脱水反应的机制。这些铁硅酸盐沸石的合成涉及对Si/Fe比例的精细控制，并通过X射线粉末衍射、N2吸附和紫外可见光谱进行了表征，以确保最佳的催化性质。
