[1] "Unit cell volumes, determined using XRD, were used to monitor the presence of Fe in the framework and the migration of Fe species from framework to extra-framework positions."
[2] "The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenation-to-cracking ratio 0.36)."
[3] "A redox cycle is suggested for the hydrocarbon reaction over isolated Fe framework sites in [Fe] zeolites via the formation of propane radical cations since a protolytic mechanism seems to be unable to explain the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity."
[4] "The migration of Fe species from framework to extra-framework positions was monitored using UV/Vis spectroscopy and using the volume of the unit cell determined using XRD patterns."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are crucial for enhancing catalytic performance. These materials typically feature a well-defined pore structure, which facilitates the diffusion of reactants and products. The 3-D dispersion of active sites ensures a high surface area, which increases the probability of contact between the catalyst and the reactants. This leads to improved efficiency and selectivity in various catalytic processes. The incorporation of B active components into these structures often involves techniques such as ion exchange or co-precipitation. Ion exchange allows for the replacement of a specific ion within the zeolite framework with B, creating active sites. Co-precipitation involves the simultaneous precipitation of B along with other components, leading to its distribution throughout the material. Both methods have their relative effectiveness depending on the specific application and desired properties of the catalyst.

B基材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构对于增强催化性能至关重要。这些材料通常具有明确的孔隙结构，这有利于反应物和产物的扩散。三维分散的活性位点确保了高比表面积，增加了催化剂与反应物接触的可能性。这在各种催化过程中能提高效率和选择性。将B活性成分引入这些结构通常涉及离子交换或共沉淀技术。离子交换允许在沸石框架中替换特定离子为B，形成活性位点。共沉淀则是在同时沉淀B和其他成分时，将其分布在整个材料中。这两种方法在具体应用和催化剂所需特性上各有其相对有效性。
