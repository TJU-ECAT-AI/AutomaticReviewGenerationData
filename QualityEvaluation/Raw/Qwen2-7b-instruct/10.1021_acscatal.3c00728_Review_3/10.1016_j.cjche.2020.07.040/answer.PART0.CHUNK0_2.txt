The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as the honeycomb cordierite monolithic B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst, significantly enhance catalytic performance. The first coated SiO2 plays a crucial role in stabilizing the active boron species, while the monolithic structure provides a uniform flow distribution, facilitates the utilization of the active component, and shortens diffusion paths, thereby restraining overoxidation. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through a two-step wash-coating method, which ensures efficient dispersion and firm attachment of the catalytically active B2O3 layer on the modified SiO2@HC support. This method is highly effective for different catalytic applications, as demonstrated by the high propylene productivity and selectivity of the catalyst under high space velocity conditions. The monolithic structure also impacts the product distribution, showing that the monolithic B2O3/SiO2@HC is more selective toward propylene than other SiO2-supported catalysts at similar propane conversions.

B基于材料在多维分散活性位点的孔隙框架中的结构特性，如蜂窝莫来石多孔B2O3/SiO2@HC催化剂，显著提高了催化性能。首先涂覆的SiO2在稳定活性硼物种方面发挥了关键作用，而多孔结构提供了均匀的流体分布，促进了活性成分的利用，并缩短了扩散路径，从而抑制了过氧化。将B活性成分引入这些结构中是通过两步洗涂法实现的，该方法确保了活性B2O3层在改性SiO2@HC支持上的高效分散和牢固附着。这种方法对不同催化应用非常有效，如通过在高空间速度条件下实现高丙烯产率和选择性，证明了催化剂的性能。此外，多孔结构也影响产物分布，表明多孔B2O3/SiO2@HC相对于其他SiO2支持催化剂在相似丙烷转化率下对丙烯的选择性更高。
