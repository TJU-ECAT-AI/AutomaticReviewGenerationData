[1] "The honeycomb cordierite monolithic B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst was designed and prepared by a two-step coating method."
[2] "A high selectivity toward olefin (97.2%) and negligible production of CO2 (0.1%) under high space velocity gave a high propylene productivity of 15.7 g C3H6(g B2O3)1·h1 for ODHP."
[3] "The promising performance of the catalyst was attributed to not only the efficient dispersion and firm attachment of the catalytically active B2O3 layer on the modified SiO2@HC support, but also the improved mass transfer brought by the honeycomb structure."
[4] "Overall, the SiO2- and B2O3-coated honeycomb cordierite monolith could be potentially recognized for industrial application of ODHP."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involve the incorporation of boron (B) elements into materials with a 3-dimensional network of interconnected pores. This architecture enhances catalytic performance by providing a high surface area for reactions, promoting efficient dispersion of active sites, and facilitating rapid mass transfer of reactants and products. The methods used to incorporate B active components typically involve chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sol-gel processes, or impregnation techniques onto porous supports such as cordierite monoliths. These methods ensure that B is uniformly distributed and firmly attached to the support, enabling effective utilization of the active sites. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application, with considerations including the type of support material, the reaction conditions, and the desired properties of the final catalyst.

The methods for incorporating B active components into porous frameworks often rely on the following steps:
1. Preparation of the porous support material, such as cordierite monoliths, through appropriate synthesis techniques to ensure structural integrity and porosity.
2. Surface modification of the support to enhance its reactivity with boron compounds, which might involve functionalization or treatment with specific chemicals.
3. Precise loading of boron compounds onto the support through methods like CVD, where boron is introduced in the vapor phase and reacts with the support's surface, or through sol-gel processes that involve the polymerization of boron-containing precursors.
4. Calcination or heat treatment to stabilize the boron species and remove any volatile precursors, ensuring that the boron is effectively incorporated and anchored within the framework.

These methods enable the creation of catalysts with tailored properties for various applications, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) in this context. The 3-D dispersed active sites within the porous framework facilitate efficient reaction kinetics, high selectivity, and resistance to sintering, making these materials suitable for industrial-scale applications.

The SiO2- and B2O3-coated honeycomb cordierite monoliths described in this document exhibit outstanding catalytic performance for ODHP, characterized by high propylene selectivity, low CO2 production, and high propylene productivity. The successful design and preparation of these catalysts highlight the importance of optimizing the integration of boron components within a 3-D porous matrix to achieve superior catalytic activity and selectivity. The methods employed here, involving a two-step coating process, demonstrate the potential for developing industrially viable catalysts with enhanced performance for ODHP and other catalytic processes requiring high selectivity and efficiency.

3-D分散活性位点在多孔框架中的B基材料结构特征涉及将硼（B）元素整合到具有三维相互连接孔隙网络的材料中。这种架构通过提供高表面积来增强催化性能，促进活性位点的有效分散，并且有利于反应物和产物的快速质量传输。用于整合B活性成分的方法通常包括化学气相沉积（CVD）、溶胶-凝胶过程或浸渍技术，这些技术是针对多孔支撑材料进行的，如陶瓷蜂窝状骨架，以确保结构完整性和孔隙度。这些方法确保B均匀分布并牢固地附着在支撑材料上，从而实现有效利用活性位点。

整合B活性成分到多孔框架中的方法通常涉及以下步骤：
1. 准备多孔支撑材料，例如陶瓷蜂窝状骨架，通过适当的合成技术确保其结构完整性和孔隙度。
2. 支撑表面的改性，以增强其与硼化合物的反应性，这可能涉及到表面功能化或使用特定化学品处理。
3. 使用方法如CVD精确加载硼化合物到支撑材料上，在此过程中，硼以蒸汽形式引入并与支撑材料表面反应，或通过溶胶-凝胶过程聚合硼化合物前体。
4. 热处理或煅烧以稳定硼物种并去除任何挥发性前体，确保硼有效地被整合并锚定在框架内。

这些方法允许根据特定应用的需求开发具有定制特性的催化剂，如本文中描述的氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）。三维分散的活性位点在多孔框架中促进了高效的反应动力学、高选择性和抗结块性，使得这些材料适合工业规模的应用。文中描述的SiO2-和B2O3涂层的陶瓷蜂窝状骨架展示了ODHP中卓越的催化性能，其特点是高丙烯选择性、低CO2生成和高丙烯产率。这些催化剂的成功设计和制备突显了优化硼组件在三维多孔矩阵内的整合对于实现优越催化活性和选择性的重要性。这里采用的两步涂层过程表明，有可能开发出具有增强性能的工业可行催化剂，适用于需要高选择性和效率的ODHP和其他催化过程。
