The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involve the incorporation of boron (B) elements into materials with a 3-dimensional network of interconnected pores. This architecture enhances catalytic performance by providing a high surface area for reactions, promoting efficient dispersion of active sites, and facilitating rapid mass transfer of reactants and products. The methods used to incorporate B active components typically involve chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sol-gel processes, or impregnation techniques onto porous supports such as cordierite monoliths. These methods ensure that B is uniformly distributed and firmly attached to the support, enabling effective utilization of the active sites. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application, with considerations including the type of support material, the reaction conditions, and the desired properties of the final catalyst.

The methods for incorporating B active components into porous frameworks often rely on the following steps:
1. Preparation of the porous support material, such as cordierite monoliths, through appropriate synthesis techniques to ensure structural integrity and porosity.
2. Surface modification of the support to enhance its reactivity with boron compounds, which might involve functionalization or treatment with specific chemicals.
3. Precise loading of boron compounds onto the support through methods like CVD, where boron is introduced in the vapor phase and reacts with the support's surface, or through sol-gel processes that involve the polymerization of boron-containing precursors.
4. Calcination or heat treatment to stabilize the boron species and remove any volatile precursors, ensuring that the boron is effectively incorporated and anchored within the framework.

These methods enable the creation of catalysts with tailored properties for various applications, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) in this context. The 3-D dispersed active sites within the porous framework facilitate efficient reaction kinetics, high selectivity, and resistance to sintering, making these materials suitable for industrial-scale applications.

The SiO2- and B2O3-coated honeycomb cordierite monoliths described in this document exhibit outstanding catalytic performance for ODHP, characterized by high propylene selectivity, low CO2 production, and high propylene productivity. The successful design and preparation of these catalysts highlight the importance of optimizing the integration of boron components within a 3-D porous matrix to achieve superior catalytic activity and selectivity. The methods employed here, involving a two-step coating process, demonstrate the potential for developing industrially viable catalysts with enhanced performance for ODHP and other catalytic processes requiring high selectivity and efficiency.

3-D分散活性位点在多孔框架中的B基材料结构特征涉及将硼（B）元素整合到具有三维相互连接孔隙网络的材料中。这种架构通过提供高表面积来增强催化性能，促进活性位点的有效分散，并且有利于反应物和产物的快速质量传输。用于整合B活性成分的方法通常包括化学气相沉积（CVD）、溶胶-凝胶过程或浸渍技术，这些技术是针对多孔支撑材料进行的，如陶瓷蜂窝状骨架，以确保结构完整性和孔隙度。这些方法确保B均匀分布并牢固地附着在支撑材料上，从而实现有效利用活性位点。

整合B活性成分到多孔框架中的方法通常涉及以下步骤：
1. 准备多孔支撑材料，例如陶瓷蜂窝状骨架，通过适当的合成技术确保其结构完整性和孔隙度。
2. 支撑表面的改性，以增强其与硼化合物的反应性，这可能涉及到表面功能化或使用特定化学品处理。
3. 使用方法如CVD精确加载硼化合物到支撑材料上，在此过程中，硼以蒸汽形式引入并与支撑材料表面反应，或通过溶胶-凝胶过程聚合硼化合物前体。
4. 热处理或煅烧以稳定硼物种并去除任何挥发性前体，确保硼有效地被整合并锚定在框架内。

这些方法允许根据特定应用的需求开发具有定制特性的催化剂，如本文中描述的氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）。三维分散的活性位点在多孔框架中促进了高效的反应动力学、高选择性和抗结块性，使得这些材料适合工业规模的应用。文中描述的SiO2-和B2O3涂层的陶瓷蜂窝状骨架展示了ODHP中卓越的催化性能，其特点是高丙烯选择性、低CO2生成和高丙烯产率。这些催化剂的成功设计和制备突显了优化硼组件在三维多孔矩阵内的整合对于实现优越催化活性和选择性的重要性。这里采用的两步涂层过程表明，有可能开发出具有增强性能的工业可行催化剂，适用于需要高选择性和效率的ODHP和其他催化过程。

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these features enhance catalytic performance. The presence of a three-dimensional network of active sites within the porous structure ensures efficient dispersion of the active component, which is crucial for maximizing the surface area available for reactions. This enhances the catalyst's ability to interact with reactants and facilitates faster reaction rates. The use of monolithic structures, specifically honeycomb cordierite, provides several benefits. The well-developed straight channels within the honeycomb structure allow for efficient gas flow distribution, ensuring that reactants are evenly distributed across the catalyst surface. This not only optimizes the utilization of the active component but also reduces the risk of localized overheating, which could lead to unwanted side reactions or reduced catalyst lifetime.

The incorporation of B active components into these structures typically involves a two-step wash-coating method. This process involves applying a solution containing the desired B compound onto the substrate, allowing it to adhere and form a thin layer. The use of SiO2 as a media layer plays a critical role in stabilizing the active boron species by providing a stable environment that prevents the loss of reactive functionalities during subsequent thermal treatments or reactions. The thin wash-coated layer of B2O3 facilitates effective pore diffusion, which is essential for maintaining high reactivity and preventing the accumulation of reactants or products that could inhibit the catalytic process.

The effectiveness of this method varies depending on the specific application. In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the monolithic B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving high propylene productivity, selectivity towards olefins, and minimal production of CO2. The catalyst's ability to operate under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) while maintaining high selectivity and productivity highlights the synergy between the monolithic structure and the B-based active sites. This synergy is further enhanced by the monolithic structure's capability to facilitate efficient use of the catalyst, reduce pressure drop, and minimize residence time differences among different parts of the catalyst, thereby improving overall efficiency and reducing operational costs.

However, the method also faces challenges, particularly in terms of scalability and practicality. High pressure drops associated with packed catalyst beds and poor mass transfer within the catalyst pellets can hinder the large-scale industrial application of particulate boron-based catalysts. Monolithic structures address these issues by providing a more streamlined and efficient platform for the active phase, which can lead to enhanced catalytic performance and broader applicability in various industrial processes.

In conclusion, the structural features of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, combined with the effective incorporation of B active components through tailored methods, significantly enhance catalytic performance. These advancements offer promising opportunities for the development of more efficient and scalable catalysts, particularly in industries requiring high selectivity and productivity in chemical synthesis processes.

分析硼基材料中三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特性，涉及理解这些特征如何增强催化性能。在多孔结构中形成三维网络的活性位点确保了活性成分的高效分散，这对于最大化与反应物接触的表面面积至关重要，从而加速反应速率。使用多孔结构，特别是蜂窝状刚玉，提供了几个优势。蜂窝结构中开发良好的直通道允许均匀的气体流分布，确保反应物均匀分布在催化剂表面。这不仅优化了活性成分的利用，还减少了局部过热的风险，这可能会导致不希望的副反应或催化剂寿命缩短。

将B活性成分引入这些结构通常涉及到两步涂布法。这个过程包括将包含所需B化合物的溶液涂覆到基体上，使其附着并形成一层薄层。SiO2作为介质层的关键作用在于稳定活性硼物种，通过提供一个稳定的环境来防止在后续热处理或反应过程中活性功能的损失。B2O3薄涂层的有效扩散促进了有效孔扩散，这对于保持高反应性和预防抑制催化过程的反应物或产物积累至关重要。

这种方法在特定应用中的有效性因具体情况而异。在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的背景下，多孔B2O3/SiO2@HC催化剂表现出卓越的性能，实现了高的丙烯产率、向烯烃的选择性以及极低的CO2生成。催化剂在高气相小时空间速度（GHSV）下运行时保持高选择性和生产力的能力强调了多孔结构和B基活性位点之间的协同效应。这种协同作用进一步得益于多孔结构对提高催化剂利用效率、降低压降和减少不同部分催化剂的停留时间差异的增强，从而提高整体效率并降低运营成本。

然而，该方法也面临着挑战，尤其是在大规模工业应用方面的可行性和可扩展性方面。由于填充催化剂床的高压降和催化剂颗粒内部的差混流可能阻碍了颗粒硼基催化剂的大规模工业应用。多孔结构通过提供更流畅且高效的平台来解决这些问题，从而可以提高活性位点的性能，并为各种工业过程提供更广泛的应用机会。

总之，B基材料中三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特征，结合B活性成分的有针对的方法的高效整合，显著增强了催化性能。这些进步为开发更高效和可扩展的催化剂提供了有前景的机会，特别是在需要高度选择性和生产性的化学合成过程中。
