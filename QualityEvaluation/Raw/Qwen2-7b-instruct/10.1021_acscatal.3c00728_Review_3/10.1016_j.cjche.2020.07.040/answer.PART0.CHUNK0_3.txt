[1] "The monolithic catalyst exhibited high propylene productivity under ODH conditions."
[2] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."
[3] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%)"
[4] "The obtained results strongly indicate that the boron-based monolithic catalyst can be properly fabricated to warrant the high activity and high throughput with its high gas/surface ratio and straight channels."
[5] "The monolithic structure allows a uniform flow distribution facilitating the utilization of the active component, and the catalytic layer wash-coated on the monolithic wall shorten the diffusion paths so that the overoxidation was restrained."
[6] "The promising performance of the catalyst was attributed to not only the efficient dispersion and firm attachment of the catalytically active B2O3 layer on the modified SiO2@HC support, but also the improved mass transfer brought by the honeycomb structure."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as the monolithic B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst, enhance catalytic performance through several mechanisms. The honeycomb cordierite structure provides well-developed straight channels, which facilitate efficient dispersion and firm attachment of the active B2O3 layer. This ensures optimal utilization of the active sites, minimizing overoxidation. The thin wash-coated B2O3 layer on the monolithic support effectively manages pore diffusion, while the high gas/surface ratio and straight channels improve mass transfer. The monolithic structure itself enables uniform flow distribution, optimizing the use of active components and reducing diffusion paths, which restrains overoxidation. These features collectively contribute to high propylene productivity, olefin selectivity, and negligible CO2 production, making the catalyst highly effective for oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

B基材料在多孔框架中的三维分散活性位点结构，如多孔蜂窝状刚玉型B2O3/SiO2@HC催化剂，通过多种机制增强催化性能。蜂窝状刚玉结构提供良好的直通道，能够高效分散并牢固附着活性B2O3层，确保最佳利用活性位点，减少过氧化。薄洗涂B2O3层在多孔支撑体上的应用有效管理孔扩散，而高气/表面比和直通道提高了质量传递。多孔结构本身允许均匀流分布，优化活性成分的使用，并减少扩散路径，从而抑制过氧化。这些特性共同导致高丙烯产率、高烯烃选择性和无CO2产生，使催化剂对氧化脱氢过程非常有效。
