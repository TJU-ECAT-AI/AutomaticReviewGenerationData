[1] "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modified by boron oxide catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with remarkable selectivity."
[2] "Lewis basic sites can abstract hydrogen atoms from CH bonds of alkanes to produce the corresponding alkenes."
[3] "The surface of carbon materials is usually terminated by a variety of oxygen functional groups."
[4] "Nanocarbon can be an attractive alternative to conventional metal oxides, as it enables a feasible investigation of the reaction mechanism and provides a sustainable technology for alkane conversion."
[5] "Samples with boron oxide and phosphorus oxide have a superior selectivity towards propene formation than pristine CNTs and oCNTs."
[6] "The activation of propane is not affected; the activation energy remains at (1305)kJmol1."
[7] "This, on the other hand, will suppress formation of non-selective oxygen species."
[8] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure."
[9] "Vanadia catalysts, the most selective metal-based catalysts, can work well at a low partial pressure of oxygen owing to suppression of consecutive propene combustion."
[10] "Using an oxygen-to-hydrocarbon ratio of 1:1, VOx-Al2O3, 5B-oCNTs, and even non-modified oCNTs provide stable catalytic performance for a time-on-stream of up to 200h."

The structural characteristics of boron-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance through several mechanisms. The porous frameworks allow for the efficient distribution of active sites, which increases the likelihood of contact between reactants and catalysts. The 3-D dispersion ensures that these active sites are accessible to reactants throughout the material, improving overall efficiency. The presence of boron atoms, acting as Lewis bases, facilitates the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from alkane molecules, forming alkenes. The oxygen functional groups on the surface of these materials are crucial for the activation of oxygen molecules, which are necessary for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The introduction of boron oxide or boron itself into these structures modifies the surface chemistry, leading to enhanced selectivity and stability. The covalent bonding of boron to the carbon nanotube structure ensures durability under reaction conditions, contributing to the long-term stability of the catalyst. The ability of boron to reduce the formation of non-selective oxygen species, such as peroxide or superoxide, further improves the selectivity of the catalytic process. This combination of features makes boron-based materials particularly effective for catalytic applications involving the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional metal oxides.
