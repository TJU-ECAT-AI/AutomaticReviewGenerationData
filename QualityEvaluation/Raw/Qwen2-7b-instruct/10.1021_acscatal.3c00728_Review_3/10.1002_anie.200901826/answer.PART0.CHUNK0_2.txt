Analyzing the structural characteristics of boron-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals several key features that enhance catalytic performance. These materials typically exhibit a high density of oxygen-functional groups on their surfaces, which act as Lewis basic sites capable of abstracting hydrogen atoms from alkane CH bonds to form alkenes. The incorporation of boron oxide into these materials leads to superior selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, specifically for converting propane to propene. This is attributed to the protective effect of boron oxide against oxygen activation, increasing the activation energy required for oxygen conversion by approximately 40 kJ/mol. The presence of boron and phosphorus oxides modifies the surface to block combustion sites and prevent the formation of COx groups, thus enhancing propene selectivity. The ability to fabricate high concentrations of selective sites on the surface addresses the drawback of low overall activity in carbon catalysts, making boron-based materials an attractive alternative to conventional metal oxides for alkane conversion. These features enable a sustainable and feasible investigation of reaction mechanisms, offering a promising avenue for alkane conversion technologies.

分析硼基材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构的特征揭示了几个关键特性，这些特性可以增强催化性能。这些材料通常在其表面具有高密度的氧功能团，这些功能团作为Lewis碱性位点，能够从烷烃CH键中提取氢原子形成烯烃。将硼氧化物引入这些材料中，导致氧化脱氢反应中的丙烷到丙烯转化具有显著的选择性。这归因于硼氧化物对氧气激活的保护作用，增加了氧气转换所需的活化能，约为40 kJ/mol。在表面引入硼和磷氧化物修改表面以阻塞燃烧位点并防止COx组分的形成，从而提高了丙烯选择性。通过在表面上制造高浓度的选择性位点来解决碳催化剂整体活性低的问题，使硼基材料成为常规金属氧化物的有吸引力替代品，用于烷烃转换技术。这些特性允许对反应机制进行可行的研究，提供了一种有前景的方法来开发烷烃转换技术。
