In the study presented in the document, the researchers discovered that unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) can serve as an effective seed for synthesizing large-area hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films with atomically flat surfaces, akin to those found in exfoliated single-crystal h-BN. The nc-G prevents structural deformations during chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. The sp3-hybridized edges of nc-G play a crucial role in these processes. The synthesized h-BN thin film is characterized by an ultra-flat surface morphology and is free from structural deformations, such as wrinkles and ripples, which are typical in CVD-grown h-BN thin films. This finding represents a significant advancement in the preparation of high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large scale.

The analysis of the structural properties of the h-BN thin film revealed that it consists of a long-range-ordered crystalline h-BN region and a short-range-ordered carbon region. The peak at 1357 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of the h-BN thin film is attributed to the superposition of the E2g mode of h-BN and the G mode of graphene. The formation of nc-G is hypothesized to occur due to small amounts of carbon-containing gases in air, particularly methane, under atmospheric pressure conditions. The document also highlights that nc-G acts as a useful seed for growing high-quality h-BN with an atomically flat surface on various substrates, including c-plane sapphire. This is evidenced by the successful synthesis of a wafer-scale, ultraflat h-BN thin film on a bare c-Al2O3 substrate, which contrasts with the inability to form uniformly flat h-BN on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under equivalent growth conditions.

Furthermore, the role of the nc-G sp3 edges in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer is elucidated through calculations of the maximum stabilization energies of h-BN monolayers terminated with B, N, O, and H atoms using the Vienna abinitio simulation package. These findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the synthesis of high-quality h-BN thin films and provide insights into the potential for tailoring the catalytic performance of these materials based on their structural characteristics.

在文档中介绍的研究中，研究人员发现意外形成的纳米晶状石墨烯（nc-G）可以作为合成大面积六方氮化硼（h-BN）薄膜的有效种子，其表面平滑程度与单晶h-BN薄膜相媲美。nc-G防止了化学气相沉积（CVD）过程中的结构变形。nc-G的sp3杂化边缘在这些过程中起着关键作用。合成的h-BN薄膜具有超平滑的表面形态，并且没有结构变形，如皱纹和波纹，这是常规CVD生长的h-BN薄膜常见的特征。这一发现代表了大规模制备高质量二维材料的重要进展。

对h-BN薄膜的结构特性的分析显示，它由长程有序的结晶h-BN区域和短程有序的碳区域组成。h-BN薄膜中Raman光谱的1357 cm−1峰归因于h-BN的E2g模式与石墨烯的G模式的叠加。nc-G的形成被假设是由于空气中少量含碳气体，特别是甲烷，在大气压力下的作用。文档还指出，nc-G可以作为生长具有原子级平坦表面的高质h-BN薄膜的有效种子，适用于各种基底，包括c轴平面蓝宝石。这通过在裸c-Al2O3基板上成功合成wafer-scale、超平滑h-BN薄膜得到证实，这与在相同生长条件下无法在单层石墨烯转移的c-Al2O3基板上形成均匀平滑h-BN薄膜形成了对比。

此外，通过使用维也纳abinitio模拟包计算终止于B、N、O和H原子的h-BN单层的最大稳定能，揭示了nc-G sp3边缘在粗糙nc-G层上形成具有原子级平坦表面的h-BN薄膜的作用。这些发现为理解合成高质量h-BN薄膜机制提供了见解，并为根据其结构特性调整这些材料的催化性能的可能性提供了线索。
