[1] "An unintentionally formed nc-G acts as a useful seed for the large-area synthesis of an h-BN thin film with an atomically flat surface comparable to that of exfoliated single crystal h-BN."
[2] "A wafer-scale dielectric h-BN thin film was successfully synthesized on a bare c-Al2O3 substrate by assistance of nc-G to prevent structural deformations in the CVD process."
[3] "On the other hand, uniformly flat h-BN does not form on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under the equivalent growth conditions, indicating that the sp3 edges of nc-G played a key role in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer."

This document discusses the synthesis of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films using unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a seed material. The nc-G helps prevent structural deformations during the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, resulting in atomically flat h-BN thin films. These films are comparable to exfoliated single-crystal h-BN. The synthesis method allows for the preparation of high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large surface, enhancing their use in two-dimensional electronic devices. The study highlights the role of the sp3 edges of nc-G in initiating and promoting the lateral growth of h-BN, leading to the formation of atomically flat surfaces.

本文讨论了使用意外形成的纳米晶石墨烯（nc-G）作为种子材料合成六方硼氮化物（h-BN）薄膜。nc-G有助于防止化学气相沉积（CVD）过程中的结构变形，从而产生原子级平滑的h-BN薄膜。这些薄膜与单晶剥离的h-BN相当。该合成方法允许在大型表面上制备高质量二维材料，增强其在二维电子设备中的应用。研究强调了nc-G的sp3边缘在启动和促进h-BN横向生长中的作用，导致形成原子级平滑表面。
