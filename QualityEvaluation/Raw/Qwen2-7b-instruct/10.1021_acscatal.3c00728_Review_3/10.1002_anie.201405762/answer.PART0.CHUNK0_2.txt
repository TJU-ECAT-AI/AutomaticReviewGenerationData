[1] "We herein present a promising breakthrough that prevents structural deformations in CVD-grown h-BN thin films by using nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as the catalytic seed layer."
[2] "Interestingly, it was found that the thin film is composed of a long-range-ordered crystalline h-BN region (in red) and a short-range-ordered carbon region (in green; Figure1b)."
[3] "This fact was further confirmed by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of the h-BN region (Figure1d)."
[4] "Furthermore, the rough interface between the h-BN region and the nc-G region suggests that nc-G plays a very important role for the lateral growth of h-BN."
[5] "However, it was found that h-BN nanoislands with a 3D growth mode and a low growth rate were formed on the ultraflat surface of the h-BN thin film, which led to a film with a rough surface morphology."

The document discusses the use of unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a seed layer for the large-area synthesis of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films. These films exhibit an atomically flat surface comparable to exfoliated single-crystal h-BN. The presence of long-range-ordered crystalline h-BN regions alongside a short-range-ordered carbon region indicates the role of nc-G in facilitating the lateral growth of h-BN. However, upon prolonged growth, h-BN nanoislands with a 3D growth mode emerge, leading to a rough surface morphology.

本文讨论了使用意外形成的纳米晶石墨烯（nc-G）作为h-BN薄片合成的种子层。这些薄膜表面的原子平滑度与单晶剥离的h-BN相当。长程有序的结晶h-BN区域与短程有序的碳区域并存，表明nc-G在促进h-BN横向生长中的作用。然而，在长时间生长后，出现具有三维生长模式的h-BN纳米岛，导致薄膜表面粗糙。
