[1] "Unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) can act as a useful seed for the large-area synthesis of a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin film with an atomically flat surface that is comparable to that of exfoliated single-crystal h-BN."
[2] "A wafer-scale dielectric h-BN thin film was successfully synthesized on a bare sapphire substrate by assistance of nc-G, which prevented structural deformations in a chemical vapor deposition process."
[3] "The growth mechanism of this nc-G-tailored h-BN thin film was systematically analyzed."
[4] "This approach provides a novel method for preparing high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large surface."
[5] "We herein present a promising breakthrough that prevents structural deformations in CVD-grown h-BN thin films by using nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as the catalytic seed layer."
[6] "Furthermore, a wafer-scale ultraflat h-BN thin film was successfully synthesized on a bare sapphire substrate by assistance of nc-G."
[7] "It has previously been reported that graphene or a graphitic carbon layer can be formed on a transition-metal substrate without any carbon precursor owing to the segregation and precipitation of dissolved carbon into the metal substrate."
[8] "Nevertheless, we confirmed that the formation of the nc-G-stacked structure on copper is reproducible under atmospheric pressure."
[9] "The more reactive sp3 carbon species at the edge of nc-G (Figure2e) are energetically favorable sites for edge-initiated lateral growth of h-BN2935 owing to the relatively weak van der Waals interactions (sp2sp2 interactions) between h-BN and graphene, which both feature sp2 hybridization and a hexagonal atom arrangement."
[10] "Therefore, the B3N3H6 vapor reacts more easily with the activated edges of the nc-G owing to the lateral sp2 growth of h-BN (Figure2f) followed by the formation of the flat surface."
[11] "Finally, the optimized h-BN thin film (60min growth, Figure2l) has an electrically insulating surface with a current of less than 143nA."
[12] "Generally, 2D materials that have been grown using a metal catalyst in a CVD process contain a large number of structural deformations owing to the different TECs between the metallic catalyst and the 2D material."
[13] "Therefore, it can be proposed that the formation of the h-BN thin film on the nc-G-stacked structure with an ultraflat surface morphology with very few structural deformations (wrinkles or ripples) caused by thermal stress26,27 is due to the similar negative TECs of nc-G and h-BN."
[14] "Furthermore, no BC and NC bonds were observed in the XPS measurements, indicating that a BCN phase had not been formed."
[15] "Thus we suggest that the nc-G sp3 edges are not directly connected to the h-BN sp3 edges, and that BO and CO bond formation plays an important role for the lateral initiation of the growth of h-BN from the edges of nc-G."
[16] "During the formation of h-BN on nc-G, O-rich sites are mainly localized along the edges of nc-G as the chamber is kept in the reducing atmospheric condition by injection of H2 gas and the dehydrogenation of borazine."

The document discusses the synthesis of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films using unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a seed layer. The presence of nc-G leads to the formation of an ultraflat h-BN thin film with an atomically flat surface, comparable to exfoliated single-crystal h-BN. This method prevents structural deformations in the chemical vapor deposition process, offering a novel approach for preparing high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large surface. The sp3 carbon edges of nc-G play a crucial role in the lateral growth of h-BN, facilitating the formation of an atomically flat surface. The formation of the h-BN thin film on the nc-G-stacked structure is attributed to the similar negative thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) of nc-G and h-BN, which reduces thermal stress-induced structural deformations. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate that BO and CO bonds are formed, contributing to the growth of h-BN from the edges of nc-G. The optimization of the h-BN thin film results in an electrically insulating surface with minimal electrical conductivity. The use of nc-G as a seed layer allows for the preparation of high-quality two-dimensional materials with controlled surface morphology and enhanced properties, which is beneficial for various applications in electronics and catalysis.

文档讨论了使用意外形成的纳米晶石墨烯（nc-G）作为种子层合成六方硼氮化物（h-BN）薄膜的方法。nc-G的存在导致形成具有原子平滑表面的超平坦h-BN薄膜，与单晶剥离的h-BN相媲美。这种方法在化学气相沉积过程中防止了结构变形，提供了一种在大面积上制备高质量二维材料的新方法。nc-G的sp3碳边缘在h-BN的横向生长中起着关键作用，促进了原子平滑表面的形成。h-BN薄膜在nc-G堆叠结构上的形成归因于nc-G和h-BN的相似负热膨胀系数（TEC），这减少了由热应力引起的结构变形。X射线光电子能谱（XPS）结果表明，BO和CO键的形成，有助于从nc-G的边缘生长h-BN。优化后的h-BN薄膜具有绝缘表面和极低的电导率。使用nc-G作为种子层允许制备具有控制表面形态和增强性能的高质量二维材料，这对电子学和催化应用有利。
