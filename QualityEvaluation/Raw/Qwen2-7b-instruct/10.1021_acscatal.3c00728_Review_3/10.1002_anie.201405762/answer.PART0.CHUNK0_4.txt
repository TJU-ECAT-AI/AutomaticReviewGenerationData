[1] "The more reactive sp3 carbon species at the edge of nc-G (Figure2e) are energetically favorable sites for edge-initiated lateral growth of h-BN2935 owing to the relatively weak van der Waals interactions (sp2sp2 interactions) between h-BN and graphene, which both feature sp2 hybridization and a hexagonal atom arrangement."
[2] "Element maps that were obtained by energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) indicated that a distinct region of boron atoms (B) and a distinct region of carbon atoms (C) exist (Figure1e)."
[3] "It has previously been reported that graphene or a graphitic carbon layer can be formed on a transition-metal substrate without any carbon precursor owing to the segregation and precipitation of dissolved carbon into the metal substrate."
[4] "The role of the nc-G sp3 edges for the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer can be understood by calculating the maximum stabilization energies of h-BN monolayers terminated with B, N, O, and H atoms using the Vienna abinitio simulation package."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks refer to the unique arrangement of boron atoms within these materials, which creates a high density of active sites suitable for catalytic reactions. These features enhance catalytic performance by increasing the surface area exposed to reactants and facilitating the interaction between the catalyst and reactants. The presence of 3-D dispersed active sites allows for better dispersion of the active component throughout the porous framework, improving its stability and efficiency in various catalytic applications.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures typically involve techniques such as ion-exchange, impregnation, and co-precipitation. Ion-exchange allows for the substitution of ions within the framework's pores with boron ions, creating active sites. Impregnation involves soaking the framework in a solution containing the B precursor, leading to its adsorption onto the framework's surface. Co-precipitation combines the synthesis of the framework and the B component simultaneously, ensuring uniform distribution.

The relative effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific catalytic application. For instance, ion-exchange might be preferred for applications requiring high stability and selectivity, while impregnation might be favored for those needing a high loading of B active component. Co-precipitation is often used for achieving a homogeneous dispersion of B across the entire framework, enhancing its performance in applications requiring broad surface coverage.

The incorporation of B active components into porous frameworks is critical for various catalytic applications, including but not limited to, hydrogen production, CO2 reduction, and the conversion of hydrocarbons. The precise control over the distribution and concentration of active sites ensures optimal catalytic activity and selectivity, making these materials valuable in the development of sustainable and efficient catalytic technologies.

这些材料中3-D分散活性位点的结构特征指的是硼原子在这些材料中的独特排列，这创造了高密度的活性位点，适合催化反应。这些特性通过增加暴露于反应物的表面面积和促进催化剂与反应物之间的相互作用来增强催化性能。3-D分散的活性位点允许在整个多孔框架中更好地分散活性成分，提高其在各种催化应用中的稳定性和效率。

用于将B活性成分引入这些结构的方法通常包括离子交换、浸渍和共沉淀等技术。离子交换允许在框架的孔中用硼离子替换离子，从而创建活性位点。浸渍是将含有B前体的溶液浸泡在框架中，导致其吸附到框架的表面。共沉淀同时合成框架和B成分，确保均匀分布。

这些方法的有效性取决于具体的应用。例如，离子交换可能更适合需要高稳定性和选择性的应用，而浸渍可能更适合需要高B活性成分负载的应用。共沉淀常用于实现整个框架内活性成分的均匀分散，提高其在需要广泛表面覆盖的应用中的性能。

将B活性成分引入多孔框架对于各种催化应用至关重要，包括但不限于氢生产、CO2还原和烃转化。精确控制活性位点的分布和浓度确保最佳的催化活性和选择性，使这些材料在可持续和高效催化技术的发展中具有重要价值。
