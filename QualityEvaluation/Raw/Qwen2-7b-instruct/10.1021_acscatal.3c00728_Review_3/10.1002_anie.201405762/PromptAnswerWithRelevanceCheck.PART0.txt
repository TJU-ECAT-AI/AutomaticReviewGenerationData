This document discusses the synthesis of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films using unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a seed material. The nc-G helps prevent structural deformations during the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, resulting in atomically flat h-BN thin films. These films are comparable to exfoliated single-crystal h-BN. The synthesis method allows for the preparation of high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large surface, enhancing their use in two-dimensional electronic devices.

In the study presented in the document, the researchers discovered that unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) can serve as an effective seed for synthesizing large-area hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films with atomically flat surfaces, akin to those found in exfoliated single-crystal h-BN. The nc-G prevents structural deformations during chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. The sp3-hybridized edges of nc-G play a crucial role in these processes. The synthesized h-BN thin film is characterized by an ultra-flat surface morphology and is free from structural deformations, such as wrinkles and ripples, which are typical in CVD-grown h-BN thin films. This finding represents a significant advancement in the preparation of high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large scale.

The analysis of the structural properties of the h-BN thin film revealed that it consists of a long-range-ordered crystalline h-BN region and a short-range-ordered carbon region. The peak at 1357 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of the h-BN thin film is attributed to the superposition of the E2g mode of h-BN and the G mode of graphene. The formation of nc-G is hypothesized to occur due to small amounts of carbon-containing gases in air, particularly methane, under atmospheric pressure conditions. The document also highlights that nc-G acts as a useful seed for growing high-quality h-BN with an atomically flat surface on various substrates, including c-plane sapphire. This is evidenced by the successful synthesis of a wafer-scale, ultraflat h-BN thin film on a bare c-Al2O3 substrate, which contrasts with the inability to form uniformly flat h-BN on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under equivalent growth conditions.

Furthermore, the role of the nc-G sp3 edges in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer is elucidated through calculations of the maximum stabilization energies of h-BN monolayers terminated with B, N, O, and H atoms using the Vienna abinitio simulation package. These findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the synthesis of high-quality h-BN thin films and provide insights into the potential for tailoring the catalytic performance of these materials based on their structural characteristics.

在文档中介绍的研究中，研究人员发现意外形成的纳米晶状石墨烯（nc-G）可以作为合成大面积六方氮化硼（h-BN）薄膜的有效种子，其表面平滑程度与单晶h-BN薄膜相媲美。nc-G防止了化学气相沉积（CVD）过程中的结构变形。nc-G的sp3杂化边缘在这些过程中起着关键作用。合成的h-BN薄膜具有超平滑的表面形态，并且没有结构变形，如皱纹和波纹，这是常规CVD生长的h-BN薄膜常见的特征。这一发现代表了大规模制备高质量二维材料的重要进展。

对h-BN薄膜的结构特性的分析显示，它由长程有序的结晶h-BN区域和短程有序的碳区域组成。h-BN薄膜中Raman光谱的1357 cm−1峰归因于h-BN的E2g模式与石墨烯的G模式的叠加。nc-G的形成被假设是由于空气中少量含碳气体，特别是甲烷，在大气压力下的作用。文档还指出，nc-G可以作为生长具有原子级平坦表面的高质h-BN薄膜的有效种子，适用于各种基底，包括c轴平面蓝宝石。这通过在裸c-Al2O3基板上成功合成wafer-scale、超平滑h-BN薄膜得到证实，这与在相同生长条件下无法在单层石墨烯转移的c-Al2O3基板上形成均匀平滑h-BN薄膜形成了对比。

此外，通过使用维也纳abinitio模拟包计算终止于B、N、O和H原子的h-BN单层的最大稳定能，揭示了nc-G sp3边缘在粗糙nc-G层上形成具有原子级平坦表面的h-BN薄膜的作用。这些发现为理解合成高质量h-BN薄膜机制提供了见解，并为根据其结构特性调整这些材料的催化性能的可能性提供了线索。

The formation of the h-BN thin film on the nc-G-stacked structure is attributed to the similar negative thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) of nc-G and h-BN, which reduces thermal stress-induced structural deformations. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate that BO and CO bonds are formed, contributing to the growth of h-BN from the edges of nc-G. The optimization of the h-BN thin film results in an electrically insulating surface with minimal electrical conductivity. The use of nc-G as a seed layer allows for the preparation of high-quality two-dimensional materials with controlled surface morphology and enhanced properties, which is beneficial for various applications in electronics and catalysis.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks refer to the unique arrangement of boron atoms within these materials, which creates a high density of active sites suitable for catalytic reactions. These features enhance catalytic performance by increasing the surface area exposed to reactants and facilitating the interaction between the catalyst and reactants. The presence of 3-D dispersed active sites allows for better dispersion of the active component throughout the porous framework, improving its stability and efficiency in various catalytic applications.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures typically involve techniques such as ion-exchange, impregnation, and co-precipitation. Ion-exchange allows for the substitution of ions within the framework's pores with boron ions, creating active sites. Impregnation involves soaking the framework in a solution containing the B precursor, leading to its adsorption onto the framework's surface. Co-precipitation combines the synthesis of the framework and the B component simultaneously, ensuring uniform distribution.

The relative effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific catalytic application. For instance, ion-exchange might be preferred for applications requiring high stability and selectivity, while impregnation might be favored for those needing a high loading of B active component. Co-precipitation is often used for achieving a homogeneous dispersion of B across the entire framework, enhancing its performance in applications requiring broad surface coverage.

The incorporation of B active components into porous frameworks is critical for various catalytic applications, including but not limited to, hydrogen production, CO2 reduction, and the conversion of hydrocarbons. The precise control over the distribution and concentration of active sites ensures optimal catalytic activity and selectivity, making these materials valuable in the development of sustainable and efficient catalytic technologies.

这些材料中3-D分散活性位点的结构特征指的是硼原子在这些材料中的独特排列，这创造了高密度的活性位点，适合催化反应。这些特性通过增加暴露于反应物的表面面积和促进催化剂与反应物之间的相互作用来增强催化性能。3-D分散的活性位点允许在整个多孔框架中更好地分散活性成分，提高其在各种催化应用中的稳定性和效率。

用于将B活性成分引入这些结构的方法通常包括离子交换、浸渍和共沉淀等技术。离子交换允许在框架的孔中用硼离子替换离子，从而创建活性位点。浸渍是将含有B前体的溶液浸泡在框架中，导致其吸附到框架的表面。共沉淀同时合成框架和B成分，确保均匀分布。

这些方法的有效性取决于具体的应用。例如，离子交换可能更适合需要高稳定性和选择性的应用，而浸渍可能更适合需要高B活性成分负载的应用。共沉淀常用于实现整个框架内活性成分的均匀分散，提高其在需要广泛表面覆盖的应用中的性能。

将B活性成分引入多孔框架对于各种催化应用至关重要，包括但不限于氢生产、CO2还原和烃转化。精确控制活性位点的分布和浓度确保最佳的催化活性和选择性，使这些材料在可持续和高效催化技术的发展中具有重要价值。
