          Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals that these features significantly enhance catalytic performance. These materials enable efficient interaction between reactants and catalysts, leading to improved conversion rates and selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Incorporating boron active components into these structures can be accomplished through impregnation, solvothermal synthesis, and sonochemical methods. The effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific catalytic application and the desired properties of the final product.
