Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these features enhance catalytic performance. The incorporation of B active components into these structures typically employs various methods such as impregnation, deposition-precipitation, and sol-gel processes. Each method has its relative effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application, such as oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
