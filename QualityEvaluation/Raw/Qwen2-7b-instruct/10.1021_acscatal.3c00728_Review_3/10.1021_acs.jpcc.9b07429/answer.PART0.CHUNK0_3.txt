The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing increased surface area and accessibility of the active sites. The incorporation of B active components into these structures was achieved through the hydrothermal synthesis process. The effectiveness of the catalysts varies depending on the specific application, such as the desired product and reaction conditions.
