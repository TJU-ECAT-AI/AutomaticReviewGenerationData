The synthesis and characterization of silica-supported boron oxide catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane involve incorporating boron active components into the structures through various methods such as impregnation, co-precipitation, and sol-gel processes. These materials exhibit enhanced catalytic performance due to their 3-D dispersed active sites within porous frameworks. The presence of these active sites facilitates better access to reactants and products, leading to improved catalyst efficiency. Different methods are required for different catalytic applications; impregnation is suitable for homogeneous catalysts, whereas co-precipitation and sol-gel processes are more appropriate for heterogeneous catalysts.
