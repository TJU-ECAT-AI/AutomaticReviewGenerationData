Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these features enhance catalytic performance. The presence of 3-D dispersed active sites allows for better contact between the catalyst and the reactants, facilitating faster and more efficient reactions. Porous frameworks provide additional surface area, which increases the number of active sites available for catalysis. The incorporation of B active components into these structures typically involves methods such as impregnation, co-precipitation, or deposition-precipitation. These methods are effective depending on the specific application, as they allow for precise control over the loading of B active sites and their dispersion within the porous framework. For instance, the impregnation method involves soaking the porous material in a solution containing the B component, allowing for a uniform distribution. The co-precipitation method combines the synthesis of the framework and B component in a single step, ensuring a high degree of dispersion and intimate contact between the two phases. The deposition-precipitation method involves depositing a precursor of the B component onto the framework and then precipitating it, which can result in a more controlled distribution and morphology of the active sites. Each method has its advantages and limitations, and the choice depends on factors such as the desired properties of the catalyst, the scale of production, and the nature of the reaction being catalyzed.

分析B基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔隙框架中的结构特征，涉及到如何增强催化性能的理解。这些特征通过提供更好的催化剂和反应物接触，加快并更有效地进行反应。孔隙框架提供了额外的表面积，增加了可用的活性位点数量。将B活性成分整合到这些结构中通常涉及浸渍、共沉淀或沉积-沉淀方法。这些方法根据具体应用的有效性取决于它们允许对B活性位点的精确控制和在孔隙框架内的分散程度。例如，浸渍方法是将多孔材料浸泡在包含B组分的溶液中，以实现均匀分布。共沉淀方法结合合成框架和B组分，在一步中完成，确保高度分散和两相之间的紧密接触。沉积-沉淀方法涉及在框架上沉积B组分的前体，并然后沉淀，这可能导致活性位点分布和形态的更严格控制。每种方法都有其优势和限制，选择取决于催化剂所需属性、生产规模以及正在进行的反应的性质等因素。

Due to the free coking and no equilibrium limitation in alkanes conversion, the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins offers an attractive route, but encounters the difficulty in selectivity control for olefins because of the over-oxidation reactions that produce a substantial amount of CO2.
The recent discovery that antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for ODH process of ethane and propane opens up a new research direction in selective cleavage of CH bond of alkanes by the metal-free catalyst.
Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2.
The kinetic analysis exhibited that the reaction order of oxygen approached 0.5.
The apparent activation energy (Ea) were estimated to be 268kJmol−1, 244kJmol−1 and 160kJmol−1 for ethane, propane and isobutane, respectively.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves examining the distribution and accessibility of boron atoms within these materials. The 3-D dispersion allows for a large surface area, enhancing the catalytic performance by providing numerous active sites for reactions. The porous nature facilitates the diffusion of reactants and products, ensuring efficient contact with the active sites. Incorporating B active components into such structures typically involves various methods, including impregnation, deposition, and covalent attachment. These methods vary in effectiveness depending on the specific requirements of the catalytic application, such as the desired reactivity, stability, and selectivity. For instance, impregnation can be effective for loading B species onto a support material, while covalent attachment might lead to more durable catalysts with improved long-term stability.

The document highlights that silicon boride catalysts exhibit excellent oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) properties for light alkanes, converting them into valuable olefins with high selectivity and stability. The catalyst shows superior olefin selectivity compared to other metal oxide catalysts and carbon materials. The antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensures its catalytic stability over prolonged use. Spectroscopic and dynamic analyses suggest that boron oxide (BOH) groups formed from boron oxide (BO) species on the catalyst surface, with assistance from steam, are the active sites driving the ODH reaction. Kinetic studies reveal that the reaction order of oxygen is approximately 0.5, indicating a near-second-order dependence on propane concentration, and that molecular oxygen enhances the formation of propylene.

This work provides experimental evidence supporting the role of boron species as the catalytic origin in initiating the ODH of light alkanes using metal-free silicon boride catalysts.
