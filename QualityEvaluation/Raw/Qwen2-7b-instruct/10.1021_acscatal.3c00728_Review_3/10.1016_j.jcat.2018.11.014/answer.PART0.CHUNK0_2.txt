2.1. "Due to the free coking and no equilibrium limitation in alkanes conversion, the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins offers an attractive route, but encounters the difficulty in selectivity control for olefins because of the over-oxidation reactions that produce a substantial amount of CO2."
2.2. "Nevertheless, the uncontrollable over-oxidation of olefins caused the formation of significant amounts of CO2 (1060%)."
2.3. "The antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensured the catalytic stability."
2.4. "The BOH groups generated from the BO species with the assistance of steam might be catalytic activity sites."
2.5. "This work experimentally supports that the catalytic origin of the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiate the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves examining the distribution and accessibility of boron atoms within these materials. The 3-D dispersion allows for a large surface area, enhancing the catalytic performance by providing numerous active sites for reactions. The porous nature facilitates the diffusion of reactants and products, ensuring efficient contact with the active sites. Incorporating B active components into such structures typically involves various methods, including impregnation, deposition, and covalent attachment. These methods vary in effectiveness depending on the specific requirements of the catalytic application, such as the desired reactivity, stability, and selectivity. For instance, impregnation can be effective for loading B species onto a support material, while covalent attachment might lead to more durable catalysts with improved long-term stability.
