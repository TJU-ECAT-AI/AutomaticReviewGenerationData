Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for reactions, facilitating the dispersion of active sites, and improving the accessibility of substrates. These materials typically exhibit high reactivity due to the unique electronic properties of boron. The incorporation of B active components into these structures often involves methods such as doping, impregnation, or synthesis within the framework itself. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For instance, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the use of silicon boride as a catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and stability, with the antioxidant property ensuring its long-term performance. The BOH groups generated from the BO species, with assistance from steam, are considered the catalytic activity sites, contributing to the high efficiency of the reaction.
