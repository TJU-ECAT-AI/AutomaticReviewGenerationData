<p>The catalytic performance of silicon boride catalyst in ODH of light alkanes including ethane, propane, and isobutane was showed in Fig. 1.</p>
<p>In the case of ODH of isobutane, the TOR was 3×10<sup>4</sup>mols<sup>-1</sup>molsite<sup>-1</sup> at 490°C and the 77.1% selectivity of isobutene (96.4% selectivity of olefins) was observed.</p>
<p>The stability of the silicon boride catalyst in the ODH of propane to propylene was evidenced by the operation of a 100-h test at 535°C. No significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity occurred.</p>
<p>An introduction period was observed on silicon boride catalysts which was also found in h-BN catalyzing ODH reactions.</p>
<p>To better understand the activation and reaction process, XRD measurement was performed to trace the structure evolution of the silicon boride catalyst under different conditions.</p>
<p>Upon exposure to the ODH of propane reaction (535°C), the surface oxygen concentrations increased to 50.4% after 1h (SiB-1h) and 54.8% after 3h (SiB-3h).</p>
<p>The kinetic analysis exhibited that the reaction order of oxygen approached 0.5.</p>

The document highlights that silicon boride catalysts exhibit excellent oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) properties for light alkanes, converting them into valuable olefins with high selectivity and stability. The catalyst shows superior olefin selectivity compared to other metal oxide catalysts and carbon materials. The antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensures its catalytic stability over prolonged use. Spectroscopic and dynamic analyses suggest that boron oxide (BOH) groups formed from boron oxide (BO) species on the catalyst surface, with assistance from steam, are the active sites driving the ODH reaction. Kinetic studies reveal that the reaction order of oxygen is approximately 0.5, indicating a near-second-order dependence on propane concentration, and that molecular oxygen enhances the formation of propylene.

This work provides experimental evidence supporting the role of boron species as the catalytic origin in initiating the ODH of light alkanes using metal-free silicon boride catalysts.
