Due to the free coking and no equilibrium limitation in alkanes conversion, the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins offers an attractive route, but encounters the difficulty in selectivity control for olefins because of the over-oxidation reactions that produce a substantial amount of CO2.
The recent discovery that antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for ODH process of ethane and propane opens up a new research direction in selective cleavage of CH bond of alkanes by the metal-free catalyst.
Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2.
The kinetic analysis exhibited that the reaction order of oxygen approached 0.5.
The apparent activation energy (Ea) were estimated to be 268kJmol−1, 244kJmol−1 and 160kJmol−1 for ethane, propane and isobutane, respectively.

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins provides an appealing process due to its lack of coking and equilibrium restrictions. However, it faces challenges in olefin selectivity due to over-oxidation reactions that generate significant CO2.
2. The recent discovery of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) acting as an antioxidant and chemically inert catalyst for the ODH process of ethane and propane has opened new avenues for selective CH bond cleavage in alkanes through a metal-free approach.
3. Spectroscopic studies indicate that the active sites in the boron-containing catalyst are BOH groups, which selectively break the CH bond while preventing the over-oxidation of propylene to CO2.
4. The kinetic analysis reveals that the reaction order for oxygen is approximately 0.5, suggesting a key role of oxygen in the catalytic process.
5. The apparent activation energies for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and isobutane are estimated to be 268 kJ/mol, 244 kJ/mol, and 160 kJ/mol, respectively.
