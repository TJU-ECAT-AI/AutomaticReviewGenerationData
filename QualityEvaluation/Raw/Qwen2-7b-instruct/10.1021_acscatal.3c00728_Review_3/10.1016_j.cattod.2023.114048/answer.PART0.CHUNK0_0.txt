[1] "The main bottleneck in the development of commercial ODHP technology is the poor C3H6 selectivity of the ODHP catalysts."
[2] "On conventional ODHP catalysts, such as vanadium- and chromium-based materials, the C3H6 selectivity is typically less than 70 % at C3H8 conversion higher than 10 %."
[3] "Intriguingly, the apparent activation energy increases with the ODHP activity, and exhibits a positive correlation with the apparent propane reaction order."
[4] "The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane."
[5] "The trend in propane reaction order and apparent activation energy on B2O3 can be rationalized by the rate expression derived based on the proposed radical chain mechanism with three distinct pathways of propane activation."

The study highlights the impact of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). It reveals that the formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support. Additionally, the apparent activation energy increases with the ODHP activity, showing a positive correlation with the apparent propane reaction order. The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, influenced by factors such as pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. The observed kinetic behaviors can be explained by the rate expression derived based on the radical chain mechanism with three distinct pathways of propane activation.

研究强调了在不同孔结构的二氧化硅上负载的硼氧化物在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中的空间限制对性能和动力学的影响。研究表明，随着活性硼位点从支撑体的限制程度的增加，丙烯形成速率降低。此外，ODHP活动性与显热能增加成正比，并且与丙烷反应顺序有正相关关系。B2O3/SiO2的显在丙烷顺序范围从1到3不等，受支撑体的孔结构、B2O3负载和丙烷部分压力等因素的影响。根据提出的自由基链机制中丙烷激活的三个不同路径推导的动力学表达式，可以解释观察到的动力学行为。
