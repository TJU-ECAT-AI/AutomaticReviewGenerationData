[1] "The main bottleneck in the development of commercial ODHP technology is the poor C3H6 selectivity of the ODHP catalysts."
[2] "On conventional ODHP catalysts, such as vanadium- and chromium-based materials, the C3H6 selectivity is typically less than 70 % at C3H8 conversion higher than 10 %."
[3] "Intriguingly, the apparent activation energy increases with the ODHP activity, and exhibits a positive correlation with the apparent propane reaction order."
[4] "The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for reactions, allowing for more efficient and uniform distribution of active sites across the material. This feature facilitates faster reaction rates and better control over product selectivity. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through various methods, such as impregnation, co-precipitation, or direct synthesis, depending on the specific material and desired application. Each method has its relative effectiveness; for instance, impregnation might be more suitable for achieving controlled dispersion of B species in the framework, whereas direct synthesis could offer better integration of B functionality within the material's structure, potentially leading to improved stability and reactivity.

3-D分散在多孔框架中的B基材料的结构特征通过提供大量的反应表面来增强催化性能，允许活性位点在材料中更均匀和高效地分布，从而加快反应速率并更好地控制产物选择性。将B活性成分整合到这些结构中的方法通常包括浸渍、共沉淀或直接合成等，具体取决于特定材料及其所需应用。每种方法都有其相对有效性；例如，浸渍可能更适合实现B物种在框架内的精确分散，而直接合成则可能为在材料结构内实现更好的B功能集成提供机会，这可能导致更好的稳定性和活性。
