The study found that the apparent activation energy for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) increases with activity, showing a positive correlation with the apparent propane reaction order. This means that the efficiency of propane conversion varies depending on factors such as the pore structure of the support, the loading of boron oxide (B2O3), and the partial pressure of propane. The researchers were able to explain these kinetic behaviors through a rate expression derived from the radical chain mechanism, which includes three distinct pathways for propane activation.

研究发现，氧化脱氢作用的丙烷（ODHP）的显性活化能随着活性增加而增加，并且与显性丙烷反应顺序呈正相关。这意味着丙烷转化效率会根据支持材料的孔结构、硼氧化物（B2O3）的负载量和丙烷的部分压力等因素而变化。研究人员通过从自由基链机制推导出的速率表达式来解释这些动力学行为，该机制包括丙烷激活的三个不同途径。
