[1] "The main bottleneck in the development of commercial ODHP technology is the poor C3H6 selectivity of the ODHP catalysts."
[2] "On conventional ODHP catalysts, such as vanadium- and chromium-based materials, the C3H6 selectivity is typically less than 70 % at C3H8 conversion higher than 10 %."
[3] "Intriguingly, the apparent activation energy increases with the ODHP activity, and exhibits a positive correlation with the apparent propane reaction order."
[4] "The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane."
[5] "The trend in propane reaction order and apparent activation energy on B2O3 can be rationalized by the rate expression derived based on the proposed radical chain mechanism with three distinct pathways of propane activation."

The study highlights the impact of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). It reveals that the formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support. Additionally, the apparent activation energy increases with the ODHP activity, showing a positive correlation with the apparent propane reaction order. The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, influenced by factors such as pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. The observed kinetic behaviors can be explained by the rate expression derived based on the radical chain mechanism with three distinct pathways of propane activation.

The kinetic behaviors in the study were explained by a rate expression based on a radical chain mechanism. The apparent activation energy rose with ODHP activity, showing a positive link with the apparent propane reaction order. The order of propane reaction on B2O3/SiO2 ranged from 1 to 3, influenced by factors such as the pore structure of the supports, the loading of B2O3, and the partial pressure of propane.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for reactions, allowing for more efficient and uniform distribution of active sites across the material. This feature facilitates faster reaction rates and better control over product selectivity. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through various methods, such as impregnation, co-precipitation, or direct synthesis, depending on the specific material and desired application. Each method has its relative effectiveness; for instance, impregnation might be more suitable for achieving controlled dispersion of B species in the framework, whereas direct synthesis could offer better integration of B functionality within the material's structure, potentially leading to improved stability and reactivity.

1. The main challenge in advancing commercial oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) technology lies in achieving high propylene (C3H6) selectivity, particularly when compared to conventional catalysts like vanadium- and chromium-based materials, which typically offer a C3H6 yield under 70% at propane conversion rates exceeding 10%.

2. The observed increase in apparent activation energy with ODHP activity and its positive correlation with the apparent propane reaction order highlights a complex interplay between reaction kinetics and operational parameters, suggesting that the ODHP process on boron oxide (B2O3) surfaces may involve intricate mechanisms beyond simple adsorption-desorption processes.

3. The apparent propane reaction order for B2O3/SiO2 systems can range from 1 to 3, depending on the specific pore architecture of the support, the loading of B2O3, and the partial pressure of propane. This variability underscores the influence of microstructural factors on the reactivity and efficiency of boron oxide-based catalysts.

4. The observed trends in propane reaction order and apparent activation energy on B2O3 can be explained through a radical chain mechanism that involves three distinct pathways of propane activation, offering a theoretical framework to understand the observed kinetic behaviors and their relationship with the catalyst's properties.

1. 商业氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）技术发展的主要障碍在于其催化剂的丙烯（C3H6）选择性较低，与传统的如钒和铬基材料相比，在丙烷转化率超过10%时，C3H6产率通常低于70%。

2. 观察到的显着激活能随ODHP活性增加，并且与其显着丙烷反应顺序正相关，表明了反应动力学和操作参数之间复杂互动的现象，暗示硼氧化物（B2O3）表面的ODHP过程可能涉及超越简单吸附-脱附过程的复杂机制。

3. B2O3/SiO2系统中的显着丙烷反应顺序可以从1到3变化，具体取决于支持的特定孔结构、B2O3负载和丙烷的部分压力。这种可变性强调了微结构因素对反应性和效率的影响。

4. 观察到的丙烷反应顺序和显着激活能随B2O3的变化趋势可以通过涉及丙烷激活的三个不同路径的自由基链机制来解释，为理解观察到的动力学行为及其与催化剂属性的关系提供理论框架。

The study found that the apparent activation energy for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) increases with activity, showing a positive correlation with the apparent propane reaction order. This means that the efficiency of propane conversion varies depending on factors such as the pore structure of the support, the loading of boron oxide (B2O3), and the partial pressure of propane. The researchers were able to explain these kinetic behaviors through a rate expression derived from the radical chain mechanism, which includes three distinct pathways for propane activation.
