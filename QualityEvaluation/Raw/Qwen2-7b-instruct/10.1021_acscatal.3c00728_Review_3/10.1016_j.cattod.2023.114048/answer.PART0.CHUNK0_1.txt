The kinetic behaviors in the study were explained by a rate expression based on a radical chain mechanism. The apparent activation energy rose with ODHP activity, showing a positive link with the apparent propane reaction order. The order of propane reaction on B2O3/SiO2 ranged from 1 to 3, influenced by factors such as the pore structure of the supports, the loading of B2O3, and the partial pressure of propane.

研究中观察到的动力学行为可以通过基于自由基链机制推导出的速率表达式来解释。显性活化能随着ODHP活性增加而上升，并与显性丙烷反应级数呈正相关。B2O3/SiO2上的丙烷反应级数从1到3变化，受支持物的孔结构、B2O3负载量和丙烷部分压力等因素的影响。
