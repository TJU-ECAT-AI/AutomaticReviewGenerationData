[1] "A series of chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts have been prepared and characterized in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane between 350 and 600 C."
[2] "It is demonstrated that the chromium catalysts supported on MCF exhibit much higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield than literature results obtained over chromium-supported mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41 catalysts during the ODH of propane."
[3] "Enhanced catalytic performance of the chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts has been attributed to the unique three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which allow a much faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane."

The study focuses on the preparation and characterization of chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. These catalysts were found to exhibit significantly higher catalytic activity, as evidenced by increased propane conversion and propylene yield, compared to chromium-supported mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41 catalysts. The enhanced performance is attributed to the unique three-dimensional, continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which facilitate faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane.

该研究集中于制备和表征用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的铬基微细胞二氧化硅泡沫（MCF）催化剂。这些催化剂在丙烷转化率和丙烯产率方面显示出显著更高的催化活性，与支持在SBA-15或MCM-41上的铬催化剂相比。性能增强的原因归因于MCF材料的独特三维、连续、超大的微孔结构，这使得在丙烷的ODH过程中内部分子传输速度更快。
