[1] "A series of chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts have been prepared and characterized in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane between 350 and 600 C."
[2] "It is demonstrated that the chromium catalysts supported on MCF exhibit much higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield than literature results obtained over chromium-supported mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41 catalysts during the ODH of propane."
[3] "Enhanced catalytic performance of the chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts has been attributed to the unique three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which allow a much faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, which enhance catalytic performance, include a unique three-dimensional, continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure. This feature facilitates faster internal molecular transport, leading to improved efficiency in catalytic reactions. The incorporation of B active components into these structures typically involves specific synthesis techniques that ensure uniform dispersion within the porous framework. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application, with some methods proving more effective for certain reactions compared to others.
