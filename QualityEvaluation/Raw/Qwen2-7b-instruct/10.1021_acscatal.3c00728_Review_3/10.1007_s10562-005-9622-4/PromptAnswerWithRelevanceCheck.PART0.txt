[1] "A series of chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts have been prepared and characterized in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane between 350 and 600 C."
[2] "It is demonstrated that the chromium catalysts supported on MCF exhibit much higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield than literature results obtained over chromium-supported mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41 catalysts during the ODH of propane."
[3] "Enhanced catalytic performance of the chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts has been attributed to the unique three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which allow a much faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane."

The study focuses on the preparation and characterization of chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. These catalysts were found to exhibit significantly higher catalytic activity, as evidenced by increased propane conversion and propylene yield, compared to chromium-supported mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41 catalysts. The enhanced performance is attributed to the unique three-dimensional, continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which facilitate faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are exemplified by mesocellular silica foam (MCF). These materials feature a unique three-dimensional, continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure that facilitates faster internal molecular transport. This enhanced transport mechanism significantly boosts catalytic performance, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes, as evidenced by the superior propane conversion and propylene yield achieved with chromium catalysts supported on MCF compared to those supported on SBA-15 or MCM-41.
