[1] "A series of chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts have been prepared and characterized in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane between 350 and 600 C."
[2] "It is demonstrated that the chromium catalysts supported on MCF exhibit much higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield than literature results obtained over chromium-supported mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41 catalysts during the ODH of propane."
[3] "Enhanced catalytic performance of the chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts has been attributed to the unique three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which allow a much faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are exemplified by mesocellular silica foam (MCF). These materials feature a unique three-dimensional, continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure that facilitates faster internal molecular transport. This enhanced transport mechanism significantly boosts catalytic performance, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes, as evidenced by the superior propane conversion and propylene yield achieved with chromium catalysts supported on MCF compared to those supported on SBA-15 or MCM-41.

基于B基材料的3-D分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特征，通过示例可以看出微细胞二氧化硅泡沫（MCF）。这些材料具有独特的三维、连续、超大的介孔结构，能够促进更快的内部分子传输。这种增强的传输机制显著提高了催化性能，尤其是在氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中，通过在MCF上负载铬催化剂所获得的丙烷转化率和丙烯产率明显优于SBA-15或MCM-41上的催化剂。
