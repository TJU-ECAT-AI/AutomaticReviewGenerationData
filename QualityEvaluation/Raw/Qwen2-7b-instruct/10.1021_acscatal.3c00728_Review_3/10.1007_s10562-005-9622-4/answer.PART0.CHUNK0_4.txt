[1] "A series of chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts have been prepared and characterized in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane between 350 and 600 C."
[2] "It is demonstrated that the chromium catalysts supported on MCF exhibit much higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield than literature results obtained over chromium-supported mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41 catalysts during the ODH of propane."
[3] "Enhanced catalytic performance of the chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts has been attributed to the unique three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which allow a much faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane."

The study analyzed the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, demonstrating that the unique three-dimensional, continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of mesocellular silica foam (MCF) materials significantly enhances catalytic performance. This is evidenced by the higher catalytic activity of chromium catalysts supported on MCF compared to those supported on mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41, specifically in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The enhanced performance is attributed to the faster internal molecular transport facilitated by the 3D structure of the MCF materials.

研究分析了基于B材料的具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构，证明了微细胞硅泡沫（MCF）材料独特的三维、连续、超大的微孔结构显著提高了催化性能。这体现在铬催化剂在MCF上的催化活性高于在SBA-15或MCM-41上支持的催化剂，在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中。增强的催化性能归因于MCF材料所促进的分子内部传输速度加快，这是由MCF材料的三维结构所赋予的。
