[1] "A series of chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts have been prepared and characterized in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane between 350 and 600 C."
[2] "It is demonstrated that the chromium catalysts supported on MCF exhibit much higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield than literature results obtained over chromium-supported mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41 catalysts during the ODH of propane."
[3] "Enhanced catalytic performance of the chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts has been attributed to the unique three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which allow a much faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane."

The study focuses on the preparation and characterization of chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. These catalysts show significantly higher catalytic activity compared to those supported on SBA-15 or MCM-41 due to the unique 3D, continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which facilitates faster internal molecular transport during the ODH process.

该研究关注了用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的铬基微细胞硅泡沫（MCF）催化剂的制备和表征。这些催化剂在与支持在SBA-15或MCM-41上的催化剂相比时，显示出显著更高的催化活性。这归因于MCF材料独特的三维（3D），连续的大孔结构，这种结构能够促进丙烷脱氢过程中的分子内部快速传输。
