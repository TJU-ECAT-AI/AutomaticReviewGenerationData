The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a unique environment for active sites, leading to high selectivity towards olefins. These materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes, exhibit exceptional properties, particularly in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propene. The proposed active site, an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<), facilitates the reaction through a radical rebound mechanism, avoiding the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals and suppressing overoxidation. This 1D nature of the edge site contributes to the stabilization of the propyl radical, leading to the observed high olefin selectivity. The incorporation of B active components into these porous frameworks is achieved through various methods, including doping and templating strategies, which have proven effective for different catalytic applications, such as the ODHP reaction. The selectivity and stability of these materials make them promising candidates for industrial applications in the chemical industry.

B基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔框架中的结构特征通过提供独特的环境来增强催化性能，导致烯烃选择性高。这些材料，如六方氮化硼（h-BN）和氮化硼纳米管，表现出独特性质，特别是在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中生产丙烯。提出的活性位点，即BN上的氧终止的臂状边缘（>BOON<），通过一种自由基反弹机制促进反应，避免生成高度活性的丙基自由基并抑制过氧化。这种边界的1D性质有助于稳定丙基自由基，从而导致观察到的高烯烃选择性。将B活性成分引入这些孔框架中是通过各种方法实现的，包括掺杂和模板策略，这些方法对不同的催化应用（如ODHP反应）非常有效。这些材料的选择性和稳定性使它们成为化学工业中潜在的应用候选者。
