Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these features enhance catalytic performance. The document highlights that boron nitride (BN) materials, which are inorganic analogs of graphene, have unique catalytic properties. These properties enable them to exhibit high selectivity for propene production during oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), a process typically challenging due to the overoxidation of propene to CO and CO2. The proposed active site for the ODHP reaction is an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (denoted as >BOON<), which is distinct from conventional catalysts like vanadia on silica (V/SiO2).

The effectiveness of incorporating B active components into these porous frameworks is demonstrated through the use of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs). These materials show exceptional selectivity for propene, with h-BN achieving a selectivity of 79% at 14% propane conversion. This high selectivity is attributed to the unique reaction mechanism involving the oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN, which are proposed to act as active sites for the ODHP reaction. This mechanism is different from that of traditional catalysts, such as V/SiO2, which tend to favor the overoxidation of propene.

Incorporating B active components into porous frameworks allows for the dispersion of active sites in three dimensions, which is crucial for enhancing catalytic performance. The document suggests that the 3-D dispersion of active sites facilitates better control over the reaction pathway, leading to the selective production of propene and other desired olefins. The stability of these materials over long periods of time, as evidenced by the 32-hour stability tests, further underscores their potential for commercial application in the chemical industry.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures involve careful synthesis and characterization to ensure that the materials maintain their unique properties and functionalities. The document emphasizes the importance of understanding the role of impurities in the materials, as they can significantly affect catalytic performance. Through techniques like x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), attenuated total reflectance-infrared (ATR-IR), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), researchers can identify the oxygen-functionalized sites on the BN surfaces that are crucial for the catalytic activity.

In conclusion, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks contribute to their enhanced catalytic performance by enabling selective and efficient conversion of propane to propene. The incorporation of B active components into these materials is facilitated through advanced synthesis and characterization techniques, ensuring that the materials maintain their unique catalytic properties. The proposed oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN serve as active sites for the ODHP reaction, offering a novel approach to the selective production of propene and other valuable olefins.

分析硼基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔框架结构中的结构特性，涉及理解这些特征如何增强催化性能。文档强调了硼氮化物（BN）材料的独特催化性质。这些性质使它们能够在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中表现出对丙烯的高选择性，这是通常具有挑战性的过程，因为丙烯容易被过氧化为CO和CO2。ODHP反应中提议的活性位点是BN的氧终止的臂链边缘（表示为>BOON<），这与传统催化剂如二氧化硅上的钒（V/SiO2）不同。

将B活性成分整合到这些孔结构中的有效方法体现在通过六方BN（h-BN）和BN纳米管（BNNTs）使用。这些材料显示出对丙烯的极高选择性，在h-BN中，丙烯的选择性达到14%时为79%。这种高选择性归因于BN的特殊反应机制，该机制涉及BN的氧终止的臂链边缘作为ODHP反应的活性位点。与传统催化剂如V/SiO2相比，后者倾向于优先氧化丙烯至更稳定的CO和CO2。

在孔框架中分散B活性成分的有效性通过保持活性位点三维分散来实现，这对于增强催化性能至关重要。文档强调了这种三维分散有助于更好地控制反应途径，从而实现丙烯和其他所需烯烃的有选择性生产。

这些材料的长期稳定性，如长达32小时的稳定性测试所证明的，进一步突显了它们在化学工业中的潜在商业应用价值。

用于整合B活性成分的方法包括精心的合成和表征，以确保材料保持其独特的物理和功能属性。通过技术如x射线光电子能谱（XPS）、衰减全反射红外（ATR-IR）和漫反射红外傅里叶变换光谱（DRIFTS），研究人员可以识别BN表面的关键氧气功能化位点，这些位点对于催化活性至关重要。

综上所述，硼基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔框架结构中的结构特性通过允许选择性和高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，从而增强了催化性能。通过先进的合成和表征技术整合B活性成分确保了材料保持其独特的催化性质。BN的氧终止的臂链边缘作为ODHP反应的活性位点提供了一种新颖的方法来选择性地生产丙烯和其他有价值的烯烃。
