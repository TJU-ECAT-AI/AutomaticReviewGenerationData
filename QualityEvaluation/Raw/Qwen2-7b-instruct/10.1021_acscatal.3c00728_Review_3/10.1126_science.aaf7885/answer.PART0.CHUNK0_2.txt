Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these materials' unique architecture enhances catalytic performance. The literature highlights that boron nitride (BN) materials, which are inorganic analogs of graphene, possess intriguing electronic, thermoelectric, and mechanical properties. However, they have not been extensively explored for their catalytic capabilities until recently. The study under discussion demonstrates that BN materials, particularly hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), exhibit exceptional selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propene and ethene.

The active sites for this reaction are proposed to be oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (denoted as >BOON<). These sites are suggested to be responsible for the enhanced selectivity and distinct reaction kinetics observed in comparison to traditional catalysts like supported vanadium oxide (V/SiO2). The structure of these armchair edges enables the stabilization of adsorbed species and the formation of propyl radicals, which is crucial for the observed high olefin selectivity.

The incorporation of B active components into porous frameworks is achieved through various methods. In this study, the researchers utilized hexagonal boron nitride and boron nitride nanotubes as catalysts by loading them onto a quartz tube reactor. The effectiveness of these materials is attributed to their unique 3-D dispersed active sites within the porous framework, which facilitates efficient oxygen activation and promotes selective conversion of propane to propene and ethene.

These findings contribute significantly to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for the production of propene, potentially addressing the current shortage in the market caused by changes in global supply chains. The use of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks represents a promising avenue for enhancing the performance of catalysts in the chemical industry, particularly in the production of high-value organic chemicals like propene and ethene.

分析硼基材料在三维分散活性位点的孔隙框架中的结构特征，涉及理解这些材料的独特架构如何增强催化性能。文献表明，硼氮化物（BN）材料，作为石墨烯的无机类比，具有引人注目的电子、热电和机械性质，但它们的催化能力尚未得到充分探索，直到最近。这项研究揭示了六方硼氮化物（h-BN）和硼氮化物纳米管（BNNTs）在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出极高的选择性，用于生成丙烯和乙烯。

这种反应的活性中心被提议为BN（表示为>BOON<）上的氧终止的臂螺旋边缘。这些位点被认为对观察到的选择性和不同反应动力学至关重要，与传统催化剂如二氧化硅负载的钒氧化物（V/SiO2）相比。臂螺旋边缘的结构允许吸附物种的稳定化和丙基自由基的形成，这是观察到的高烯烃选择性的关键。

这些材料的有效成分B的集成到孔隙框架中是通过各种方法实现的。在这项研究中，研究人员利用六方硼氮化物和硼氮化物纳米管作为催化剂，将其加载到石英管反应器上。这些材料的有效性归因于它们在孔隙框架中独特的三维分散活性位点，这促进了有效氧激活并促进了丙烷向丙烯和乙烯的有选择性转化。

这些发现对提高化学工业中催化剂的性能、特别是丙烯和乙烯生产提供了重大贡献，特别是在当前全球供应链变化导致丙烯短缺的情况下。硼基材料在三维分散活性位点的孔隙框架中的应用代表了一个有前景的途径，以提高催化剂在有机化学品生产中的效率。
