[1] "The combination of the interesting observations outlined in this work (i.e., improved selectivity to olefins and different reaction kinetics) points toward a fundamentally different reaction mechanism in conjunction with a different active site compared with other, previously studied and better understood catalysts for this reaction."
[2] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site."
[3] "The proposed intermediate structures and energies of the overall catalytic cycle are included in fig. S11."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance by providing unique active sites that enable selective reactions. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through various methods, including impregnation, sol-gel processes, and chemical vapor deposition. Each method has its effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application, such as selective oxidation or dehydrogenation reactions. The 3-D dispersion ensures that the active sites are widely distributed, improving the catalyst's efficiency and reducing the risk of local overheating or poisoning by impurities. The high surface area and pore structure of the porous frameworks facilitate the adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products, optimizing the reaction pathways and enhancing the overall catalytic activity. The active sites, such as oxygen-terminated armchair edges of B-based materials, enable the selective formation of olefins by stabilizing radicals and preventing overoxidation, thus achieving high olefin selectivity. The proposed radical rebound mechanism elucidates the detailed steps involved in the catalytic cycle, providing a theoretical basis for understanding the underlying chemistry and guiding the design of more efficient catalysts.
