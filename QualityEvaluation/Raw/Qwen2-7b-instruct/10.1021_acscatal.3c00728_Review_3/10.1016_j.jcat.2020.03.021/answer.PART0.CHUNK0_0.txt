Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals that the incorporation of boron into zeolite structures enhances catalytic performance. The presence of these active sites, specifically the defective trigonal boron structures, facilitates efficient propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene. The use of zeolites as supports benefits from their large internal surface areas, micropores of molecular dimensions, and high thermal stabilities, which are conducive to the reaction kinetics and selectivity. The ability to transform tetrahedral boron into trigonal structures suggests a dynamic reactivity that contributes to the catalytic efficiency. This system provides a valuable platform for exploring the connection between boron coordination environments and the performance of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
