<p>The reported metal oxides catalysts generally cause over-oxidation of propylene to COx, thus hindering the commercialization of ODH processes.</p>
<p>Zeolites are one of the most common catalyst supports, and widely used in industry due to its large internal surface areas, micropores of molecular dimension, and high thermal stabilities.</p>
<p>Noteably, the total selectivity to light olefins can reach 91.6% at 530 C.</p>
<p>The catalytic active sites were attributed to the abundant of defective trigonal boron structures.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that propane conversion increased from 19.9% to 29.8% during reaction period of 1 to 20 h, it can be inferred that the amount of B[3]a and B[3]b species (defective trigonal boron species) may be correlated with the catalytic activity of the catalyst in propane ODH reaction.</p>
<p>To elucidate the origin of active sites, we calculated the TOF of BZEO catalysts at 500 C based on the fraction of B[3]a and B[3]b (Fig. S6, Table S3).</p>
<p>However, the relative amounts of B[4]a+b in the fresh catalysts were much lower (0.2 mgboron species/gcat) compared with that of B[3]a and B[3]b, which significantly increased to 1.88 mgboron species/gcat after 20 h running on stream.</p>

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger internal surface area, micropores that match molecular dimensions, and high thermal stability. This allows for efficient adsorption and reaction of substrates. Boron is incorporated into these structures through hydrothermal synthesis, forming a lamellar precursor that is then calcined and treated with water to remove soluble species. The active sites, identified as defective trigonal boron structures (B[3]a and B[3]b), correlate with the catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of these boron species leads to high propylene selectivity and total light olefin selectivity, reaching 83.6% and 91.2%, respectively, at a propane conversion of 3.9%. The transformation of tetrahedral boron species (B[4]a+b) to trigonal boron species (B[3]a+b) during the reaction process is postulated to be the reason for the enhanced catalytic performance. The use of boron in this manner provides a platform for further investigation into the relationship between boron coordination environment and catalytic performance.

B基材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构的结构特征通过提供较大的内部表面积、与分子尺寸相匹配的微孔以及高热稳定性，增强了催化性能。这允许有效吸附和反应底物。通过水热合成将硼整合到这些结构中，形成层状前体，然后进行煅烧和水处理以去除可溶性物种。作为活性位点的缺陷三硼结构（B[3]a和B[3]b）与氧化脱氢化反应中的催化活性相关。在这些硼物种的存在下，可以实现高达83.6%的丙烯选择性和91.2%的轻烯烃总选择性，当丙烷转化率为3.9%时。反应过程中四面体硼物种（B[4]a+b）向三面体硼物种（B[3]a+b）的转变被认为是增强催化性能的原因。使用这种方式的硼提供了进一步研究硼配位环境与催化性能之间关系的平台。
