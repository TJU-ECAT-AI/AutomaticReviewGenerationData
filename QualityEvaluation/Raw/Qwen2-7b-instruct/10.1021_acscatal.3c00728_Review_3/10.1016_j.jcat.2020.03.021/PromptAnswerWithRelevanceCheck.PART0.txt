Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals that the incorporation of boron into zeolite structures enhances catalytic performance. The presence of these active sites, specifically the defective trigonal boron structures, facilitates efficient propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene. The use of zeolites as supports benefits from their large internal surface areas, micropores of molecular dimensions, and high thermal stabilities, which are conducive to the reaction kinetics and selectivity. The ability to transform tetrahedral boron into trigonal structures suggests a dynamic reactivity that contributes to the catalytic efficiency. This system provides a valuable platform for exploring the connection between boron coordination environments and the performance of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, the literature demonstrates the enhanced catalytic performance attributed to the large internal surface areas, micropores of molecular dimensions, and high thermal stabilities provided by zeolites. The incorporation of boron species, particularly those forming defective trigonal structures, into the zeolite framework creates an environment conducive to efficient oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The use of defective boron structures, either in boron nitride or silicon boride, allows for the creation of 3-D dispersed active sites, which are crucial for the selective conversion of light alkanes into desired olefins. The effectiveness of these materials is underscored by their ability to achieve high selectivities, such as reaching 91.6% total selectivity to light olefins at 530°C. The critical role of oxygen-containing boron species at the surface of boron nitride in achieving superior catalytic performance is also highlighted, further supporting the utility of boron-based materials in catalytic applications. The literature provides evidence that the active sites responsible for the ODH of propane to propylene are indeed the defective trigonal boron structures, aligning with previous findings that BO3 species are preferred over BO4 species for this reaction.

<p>The reported metal oxides catalysts generally cause over-oxidation of propylene to COx, thus hindering the commercialization of ODH processes.</p>

<p>Noteably, the total selectivity to light olefins can reach 91.6% at 530 C.</p>
<p>The catalytic active sites were attributed to the abundant of defective trigonal boron structures.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that propane conversion increased from 19.9% to 29.8% during reaction period of 1 to 20 h, it can be inferred that the amount of B[3]a and B[3]b species (defective trigonal boron species) may be correlated with the catalytic activity of the catalyst in propane ODH reaction.</p>
<p>To elucidate the origin of active sites, we calculated the TOF of BZEO catalysts at 500 C based on the fraction of B[3]a and B[3]b (Fig. S6, Table S3).</p>
<p>However, the relative amounts of B[4]a+b in the fresh catalysts were much lower (0.2 mgboron species/gcat) compared with that of B[3]a and B[3]b, which significantly increased to 1.88 mgboron species/gcat after 20 h running on stream.</p>

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger internal surface area, micropores that match molecular dimensions, and high thermal stability. This allows for efficient adsorption and reaction of substrates. Boron is incorporated into these structures through hydrothermal synthesis, forming a lamellar precursor that is then calcined and treated with water to remove soluble species. The active sites, identified as defective trigonal boron structures (B[3]a and B[3]b), correlate with the catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of these boron species leads to high propylene selectivity and total light olefin selectivity, reaching 83.6% and 91.2%, respectively, at a propane conversion of 3.9%. The transformation of tetrahedral boron species (B[4]a+b) to trigonal boron species (B[3]a+b) during the reaction process is postulated to be the reason for the enhanced catalytic performance. The use of boron in this manner provides a platform for further investigation into the relationship between boron coordination environment and catalytic performance.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, the literature highlights the use of layered borosilicate zeolites, specifically ERB-1, as an effective catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The key feature is the abundance of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b), which correlate with enhanced catalytic activity for propane ODH. These species, forming 3-D dispersed active sites within the porous framework, offer superior selectivity to olefins and low CO2 formation, making them suitable for industrial applications. The incorporation of B active components into these structures, through hydrothermal synthesis, allows for the creation of materials that can efficiently convert propane to propylene under controlled conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of using boron-based catalysts for this specific chemical transformation.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, we find that these features enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for reactions and facilitating the diffusion of reactants and products. The incorporation of B active components into these structures, particularly through the use of layered borosilicate zeolites like ERB-1, demonstrates a promising approach for various catalytic applications. The use of B-based materials allows for superior selectivity towards olefin production and reduced CO2 formation, as evidenced by the work with defective hexagonal boron nitride and the MWW borosilicate zeolite. The active sites, such as defective trigonal boron structures (B[3]a and B[3]b), play a crucial role in the catalytic activity, as they are responsible for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This highlights the importance of the coordination environment of boron species within the porous framework for achieving high catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, including hydrothermal synthesis, powder X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, and transmission electron microscopy, have proven effective for understanding and enhancing the catalytic performance of B-based materials. These techniques allow for detailed characterization of the catalysts' structure, surface properties, and active sites, which are essential for optimizing their application in catalytic processes. The results suggest that the use of 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks can lead to more efficient and selective catalytic reactions, particularly for the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons.
