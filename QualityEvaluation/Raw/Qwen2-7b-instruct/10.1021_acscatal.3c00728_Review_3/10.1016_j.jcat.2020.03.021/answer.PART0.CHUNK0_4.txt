Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, we find that these features enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for reactions and facilitating the diffusion of reactants and products. The incorporation of B active components into these structures, particularly through the use of layered borosilicate zeolites like ERB-1, demonstrates a promising approach for various catalytic applications. The use of B-based materials allows for superior selectivity towards olefin production and reduced CO2 formation, as evidenced by the work with defective hexagonal boron nitride and the MWW borosilicate zeolite. The active sites, such as defective trigonal boron structures (B[3]a and B[3]b), play a crucial role in the catalytic activity, as they are responsible for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This highlights the importance of the coordination environment of boron species within the porous framework for achieving high catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, including hydrothermal synthesis, powder X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, and transmission electron microscopy, have proven effective for understanding and enhancing the catalytic performance of B-based materials. These techniques allow for detailed characterization of the catalysts' structure, surface properties, and active sites, which are essential for optimizing their application in catalytic processes. The results suggest that the use of 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks can lead to more efficient and selective catalytic reactions, particularly for the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons.

分析具有三维分散活性位点的硼基材料在多孔框架中的结构特性，我们发现这些特征通过提供更大的反应表面和促进反应物和产物的扩散来增强催化性能。将硼活性成分整合到这些结构中，特别是通过使用层状硅硼酸盐沸石如ERB-1，为各种催化应用提供了有前景的方法。使用硼基材料允许更高的烯烃选择性和减少二氧化碳排放，如用缺陷六方硼氮化物和层状硅硼酸盐沸石的工作所证明的那样。活性位点，如缺陷三角硼结构（B[3]a和B[3]b），对催化活性起着关键作用，因为它们是丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的关键因素。这强调了在多孔框架内硼物种的配位环境对于实现高催化效率和选择性的重要性。

用于整合硼活性成分到这些结构中的方法，包括水热合成、粉末X射线衍射、氮吸附-脱附等温线、透射电子显微镜，已经证明对于理解和提高硼基材料的催化性能非常有效。这些技术允许对催化剂的结构、表面性质和活性位点进行详细表征，这对于优化其在催化过程中的应用至关重要。结果表明，在多孔框架中使用三维分散的活性位点可以导致更高效和选择性的催化反应，特别是对于碳氢化合物的氧化脱氢。
