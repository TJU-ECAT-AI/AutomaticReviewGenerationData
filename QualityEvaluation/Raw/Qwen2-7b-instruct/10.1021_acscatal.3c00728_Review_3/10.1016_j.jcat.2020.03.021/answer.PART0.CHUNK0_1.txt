[1] "Recently, several catalysts based on defective hexagonal boron nitride for the ODH of light alkanes have been reported."
[2] "Our previous work revealed that oxygen-containing boron species at the surface of boron nitride are critical to their superior catalytic performance."
[3] "Inspired by the previous studies, besides boron nitride, thermally stable silicon boride has also been proved as the active catalyst for ODH."
[4] "Zeolites are one of the most common catalyst supports, and widely used in industry due to its large internal surface areas, micropores of molecular dimension, and high thermal stabilities."
[5] "Noticeably, the total selectivity to light olefins can reach 91.6% at 530 C."
[6] "The catalytic active sites were attributed to the abundant of defective trigonal boron structures."
[7] "The results agreed well that the defective trigonal structures were the active sites, being consistent with the previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species were required for propane ODH to propylene."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, the literature demonstrates the enhanced catalytic performance attributed to the large internal surface areas, micropores of molecular dimensions, and high thermal stabilities provided by zeolites. The incorporation of boron species, particularly those forming defective trigonal structures, into the zeolite framework creates an environment conducive to efficient oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The use of defective boron structures, either in boron nitride or silicon boride, allows for the creation of 3-D dispersed active sites, which are crucial for the selective conversion of light alkanes into desired olefins. The effectiveness of these materials is underscored by their ability to achieve high selectivities, such as reaching 91.6% total selectivity to light olefins at 530°C. The critical role of oxygen-containing boron species at the surface of boron nitride in achieving superior catalytic performance is also highlighted, further supporting the utility of boron-based materials in catalytic applications. The literature provides evidence that the active sites responsible for the ODH of propane to propylene are indeed the defective trigonal boron structures, aligning with previous findings that BO3 species are preferred over BO4 species for this reaction.

分析基于三维分散在多孔框架中的硼基材料的结构特征，文献显示大型内部表面积、分子尺度的微孔和高热稳定性由沸石提供，这些特性促进了催化性能的增强。将硼物种，特别是形成缺陷三棱形结构的硼物种，引入沸石框架中，创造出有利于高效氧化脱氢（ODH）的环境，特别针对轻烷烃转化为所需烯烃。利用缺陷硼结构，在硼氮化物或硅硼化物中创建三维分散活性位点，对于选择性转化轻烷烃具有关键作用。这些材料的有效性通过达到530°C时91.6%的轻烯烃总选择性得到证实。文献强调表面含有氧的硼物种对硼氮化物的重要性，进一步支持硼基材料在催化应用中的实用性。文献提供了证据表明，负责丙烷到丙烯的ODH反应的活性位点确实是缺陷三棱形硼结构，与先前发现的BO3物种相比，BO4物种更适合这一反应保持一致。
