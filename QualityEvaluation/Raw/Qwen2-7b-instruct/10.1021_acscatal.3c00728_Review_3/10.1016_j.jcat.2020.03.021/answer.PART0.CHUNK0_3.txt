<p>Recently, several catalysts based on defective hexagonal boron nitride for the ODH of light alkanes have been reported. This new family of catalysts shows superior selectivity to olefins and low CO2 formation.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that layered borosilicate zeolite (ERB-1, an MWW borosilicate zeolite) was an active and selective catalyst for ODH of propane, showing a propylene selectivity of 80.4% at a propane conversion of 15.6%.</p>
<p>The catalytic active sites were attributed to the abundant of defective trigonal boron structures.</p>
<p>Noticeably, the total selectivity to light olefins can reach 91.6% at 530 C.</p>
<p>Structural characterization revealed that the abundance of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) was responsible for the activity of propane ODH.</p>
<p>The results agreed well that the defective trigonal structures were the active sites, being consistent with the previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species were required for propane ODH to propylene.</p>

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, the literature highlights the use of layered borosilicate zeolites, specifically ERB-1, as an effective catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The key feature is the abundance of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b), which correlate with enhanced catalytic activity for propane ODH. These species, forming 3-D dispersed active sites within the porous framework, offer superior selectivity to olefins and low CO2 formation, making them suitable for industrial applications. The incorporation of B active components into these structures, through hydrothermal synthesis, allows for the creation of materials that can efficiently convert propane to propylene under controlled conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of using boron-based catalysts for this specific chemical transformation.

分析硼基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔性框架中的结构特征，文献中展示了层状硅硼酸盐沸石（具体为ERB-1，一种MWW硅硼酸盐沸石）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的有效催化剂。关键特点是丰富的缺陷三棱形硼物种（B[3]a和B[3]b），这些物种与丙烷ODH的增强催化活性相关。这些物种在孔性框架内形成三维分散的活性位点，提供优异的烯烃选择性和低CO2生成，使其适合工业应用。通过水热合成将B活性成分引入这些结构，可以创造出能够有效将丙烷转化为丙烯的材料，在可控条件下进行，证明了使用硼基催化剂进行这种特定化学转变的有效性。
