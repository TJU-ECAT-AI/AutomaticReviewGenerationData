[1] "N2-BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
[2] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."
[3] "While the sintering effect of the BOx species in O2-treated BN, led to the suppressed catalytic performance (12.4% conversion at 520C)."
[4] "Because N2 plasma could break chemical bonds linked in a controlled manner and abstract N element on the surface of BN, more three-boron center N-defects were formed, which were considered to be favorable sites for generating active species."
[5] "From the performance of H2-BN, although N-H and B-H were generated during the ODH reaction, they may not promote propane conversion."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, these features enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for reactions, allowing for more effective contact between reactants and active sites. The porous framework ensures a high density of these sites, which increases the likelihood of successful reactions. The 3-D dispersion allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, optimizing the catalytic cycle. The active sites are often located on the surface or edges of the particles, where reactions occur more frequently due to the higher energy levels.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures vary in effectiveness depending on the specific application. N2 plasma treatment creates more three-boron center N-defects, which are beneficial for catalytic reactions. This method is effective for enhancing activity by creating favorable sites for reactants to interact with. O2 plasma, on the other hand, introduces BOx species, which can lead to sintering and reduced activity, suggesting that this method may not be as effective for maintaining high catalytic performance. H2 plasma treatment generates N-H and B-H groups, which do not necessarily promote propane conversion, indicating that the type of functional groups created can impact the catalytic activity.

In conclusion, the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into porous frameworks depends on the plasma treatment used, with N2 plasma being particularly advantageous for creating an optimal structure that enhances catalytic performance. The methods must be carefully selected based on the desired outcomes and the specific requirements of the catalytic application.

分析硼基材料中三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特征，这些特征通过提供更大的反应面积来增强催化性能，使得反应物与活性位点的有效接触成为可能。多孔框架确保了高密度的活性位点，从而增加了反应物和产物之间相互作用的可能性。三维分散有助于更好地扩散反应物和产物，优化催化循环。活性位点通常位于颗粒表面或边缘，这些位置的能级更高，更有利于反应发生。

用于将硼活性成分引入这些结构的方法在不同应用中的有效性各不相同。氮气等离子体处理可以产生更多的三硼中心N缺陷，这对催化反应非常有利。这种方法对于增强活性尤其有效，因为它能够创建有利于反应物相互作用的理想位点。氧等离子体引入BOx物种，这可能导致烧结并降低活性，这表明这种方法可能不适合维持高催化性能。氢气等离子体处理会产生N-H和B-H基团，这些基团不一定促进丙烷转化，这表明生成的功能基团类型会影响催化活性。

综上所述，将硼活性成分引入多孔框架的有效性取决于所使用的等离子体处理方法，特别是N2等离子体处理特别有利于创建能够增强催化性能的理想结构。选择方法时必须根据期望的结果和催化应用的具体需求进行仔细考虑。
