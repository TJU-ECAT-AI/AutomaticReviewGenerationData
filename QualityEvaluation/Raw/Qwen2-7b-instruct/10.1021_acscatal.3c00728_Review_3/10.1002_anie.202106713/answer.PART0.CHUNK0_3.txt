The document investigates the impact of plasma treatments on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. Four types of plasmas (N2, O2, H2, Ar) were used to modify the local chemical environment of h-BN. N2 plasma treatment resulted in a catalyst with a remarkable activity, achieving 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity towards olefins at 520°C. This activity was attributed to the creation of three-boron center nitrogen-defects in the catalyst. O2 plasma treatment led to a decrease in the oxidation temperature of BN, but it negatively affected the catalytic performance. The document also explores the formation of N-H and B-H functionalities during the ODH reaction and proposes a model for the generation of N-defects evolving into BOx species during the reaction.

文献研究了等离子体处理对六方硼氮化物（h-BN）氧化脱氢（ODH）丙烷的影响。四种类型的等离子体（N2、O2、H2、Ar）被用来修改h-BN的局部化学环境。N2等离子体处理产生了具有显著活性的催化剂，在520°C时实现了26.0%的丙烷转化率和89.4%的烯烃选择性。这种活性归因于催化剂中形成三个硼中心的氮缺陷。O2等离子体处理降低了BN的氧化温度，但对催化性能产生了负面影响。文献还探讨了ODH反应期间形成N-H和B-H功能的机制，并提出了在反应过程中N缺陷转化为BOx物种的模型。
