The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are enhanced through the incorporation of B active components into these structures. The use of 3-D porous frameworks allows for the creation of a vast surface area, which increases the number of potential active sites for catalysis. This enhances the catalytic performance by increasing the probability of substrate encountering an active site. The dispersion of active sites within the porous framework ensures that they are well-distributed, leading to uniform catalytic activity across the entire material. This is particularly advantageous for applications requiring high throughput and efficient conversion rates.

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include plasma treatments such as N2, O2, H2, and Ar. Plasma treatments can modify the surface properties and composition of the materials by breaking surface chemical bonds and forming new ones. This results in the creation of 3-D dispersed active sites within the porous frameworks. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the type of plasma used. For instance, N2 plasma was found to be particularly effective in enhancing the ODH reaction performance of the material, while O2 plasma had the opposite effect. The ability to tailor the local environment of the B-based materials by selecting appropriate plasma treatments enables the optimization of their catalytic properties for specific applications.

The incorporation of B active components into 3-D porous frameworks with 3-D dispersed active sites is achieved through plasma treatments. These treatments can introduce nitrogen defects, which can evolve into oxygen-containing boron species (BOx) during the ODH reaction of propane. This process is critical for enhancing the catalytic performance of the materials. The evolution of nitrogen defects into BOx species is a key mechanism behind the improved catalytic activity of the B-based materials. The presence of BOx species on the surface of the materials facilitates the conversion of propane to propylene, contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance.

The effectiveness of incorporating B active components into 3-D porous frameworks is evaluated based on the catalytic performance of the materials. Factors such as the type of plasma used, the resulting chemical environment of the materials, and the presence of active sites play crucial roles in determining the catalytic performance. The evaluation of these factors helps in understanding the mechanisms underlying the enhanced catalytic activity and guides the development of optimized B-based materials for specific catalytic applications.

B基于材料在三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构中的结构特征通过将B活性成分整合到这些结构中得到增强。三维多孔框架允许创建大量表面积，从而增加了潜在活性位点的数量，提高了催化性能。这种分布均匀的活性位点确保了整个材料的均匀催化活性，这对于需要高通量和高效转化率的应用特别有利。

用于将B活性成分整合到这些结构中的方法包括N2、O2、H2和Ar等气体的等离子体处理。等离子体处理可以通过破坏表面化学键并形成新的化学键来修改材料的表面性质和组成。这导致在多孔框架内产生三维分散的活性位点。这些方法的有效性根据所使用的等离子体类型而异。例如，N2等离子体被发现特别有效于提高材料的ODH反应性能，而O2等离子体则产生了相反的效果。通过选择适当的等离子体处理来调整B基材料的局部环境的能力使得优化其催化特性以适应特定应用成为可能。

通过等离子体处理将B活性成分整合到三维多孔框架中的过程是通过引入氮缺陷来实现的，这些氮缺陷可以进化成氧含硼物种（BOx）并在丙烷脱氢氧化反应期间催化丙烷转化为丙烯。这是提高材料催化性能的关键机制。氮缺陷向BOx物种的进化是B基材料增强催化性能的重要原因。表面的BOx物种的存在促进了丙烷到丙烯的转换，从而贡献了材料的增强催化性能。

整合B活性成分到三维多孔框架中的有效性基于材料的催化性能进行评估。因素如所使用的等离子体类型、材料的最终化学环境以及存在的活性位点在确定催化性能方面起着关键作用。对这些因素的评估有助于理解增强催化活性的机制，并指导B基材料的开发以适应特定的催化应用。
