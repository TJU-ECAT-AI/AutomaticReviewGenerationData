[1] "Four kinds of plasmas (N2, O2, H2, Ar) were accordingly employed to regulate the local chemical environment of h-BN."
[2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
[3] "While the sintering effect of the BOx species in O2-treated BN, led to the suppressed catalytic performance (12.4% conversion at 520C)."
[4] "Propylene is one of the most essential molecules in modern chemical industry, which has an extensive downstream product chain such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and acetone."
[5] "The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed and shown in Figure6."

The research analyzes the structural characteristics of boron-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, focusing on how these features enhance catalytic performance. The study employs plasma treatment techniques to incorporate boron active components into these structures. N2 plasma is particularly effective, as it creates more three-boron center nitrogen-defects, which are considered favorable for generating active species. The incorporation of boron active components into the porous framework is facilitated by the plasma treatment methods. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For instance, N2 plasma is found to be superior for enhancing the catalytic performance of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions of propane to propylene. This is attributed to the formation of boron-nitrogen defects, which play a crucial role in facilitating the conversion of propane. The sintering effect of oxygen plasma, on the other hand, leads to a suppressed catalytic performance. The study suggests that the generation of nitrogen-defects and their evolution into boron-oxygen species during the ODH reaction contribute significantly to the catalytic activity.

研究分析了具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架中硼基材料的结构特征，着重探讨了这些特性如何增强催化性能。通过等离子体处理技术，将硼活性成分引入这些结构中。N2等离子体尤其有效，因为它可以产生更多的三硼中心氮缺陷，被认为是生成活性物种的关键。向多孔框架中引入硼活性成分是通过等离子体处理方法实现的。这些方法的有效性因特定催化应用的不同而有所差异。例如，在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中，通过N2等离子体增强六方硼氮化物（h-BN）的催化性能，这归功于硼-氮缺陷的形成，它们在促进丙烷转化方面起着关键作用。而氧等离子体会导致催化性能下降。研究表明，ODH反应过程中氮缺陷的产生及其转化为硼-氧物种对催化活性贡献显著。
