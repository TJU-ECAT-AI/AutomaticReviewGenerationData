Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these materials enhance catalytic performance through the creation of numerous active sites that facilitate reactions. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through various methods such as plasma treatment, which allows for the selective construction of boron sites with different local environments. 

The effectiveness of these methods varies based on the specific catalytic application. For instance, N2 plasma treatment was found to be highly effective in creating a catalyst (N2-BN) that exhibited remarkable activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. This catalyst achieved a 26.0% propane conversion rate with a high olefin selectivity of 89.4% at 520°C. The success can be attributed to the controlled breaking of chemical bonds by the N2 plasma, which led to the formation of more three-boron center N-defects, considered favorable sites for generating active species.

Conversely, O2 plasma treatment resulted in the introduction of BOx species, which had a negative impact on the catalytic performance, reducing propane conversion to 12.4% at the same temperature. This suggests that while plasma treatment can introduce boron sites, the type and nature of the introduced species significantly affect the catalytic activity.

Moreover, the generation of N-defects during plasma treatment, particularly under N2 plasma, was found to be advantageous. These N-defects, including three-boron center N-defects, play a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane to propylene. The results highlight the importance of understanding the role of specific boron species and their local environment in enhancing catalytic performance.

In summary, the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks depends on the type of plasma treatment used, the resulting boron species, and their local environment. Plasma treatment offers a feasible way to design functionalized or defects-rich catalysts that can be tailored for different catalytic applications by controlling the boron species and their distribution within the porous framework.

分析B基材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架的结构特征，涉及到理解这些材料如何通过增加大量活性位点来增强催化性能。将B活性成分融入这些结构通常采用多种方法，例如等离子体处理，这种方法允许选择性构建具有不同局部环境的硼位点。

这些方法在特定的催化应用中的有效性各不相同。例如，N2等离子体处理被发现对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应非常有效，生成的催化剂在520°C时实现了26.0%的丙烷转化率和89.4%的烯烃选择性。这种成功可以归因于N2等离子体的可控化学键断裂，导致形成了更多的三硼中心氮缺陷，被认为是产生活性物种的理想位置。

相反，O2等离子体处理引入了BOx物种，这对其催化性能产生了负面影响，使丙烷转化率降至12.4%。这表明虽然等离子体处理可以引入硼位点，但引入的物种类型和性质显著影响催化活性。

此外，等离子体处理期间生成的氮缺陷，尤其是N2等离子体处理期间生成的氮缺陷，被发现是至关重要的。这些氮缺陷，包括三硼中心氮缺陷，在促进丙烷转化为丙烯的反应中发挥了关键作用。结果强调了了解特定硼物种及其局部环境在增强催化性能方面的重要性。

综上所述，将B活性成分融入具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料中的多孔框架的有效性取决于所使用的等离子体处理类型、最终的硼物种以及它们在多孔框架内的分布。等离子体处理提供了一种设计功能化或缺陷丰富的催化剂的可行方法，可以通过控制硼物种及其分布来针对不同的催化应用进行定制。
