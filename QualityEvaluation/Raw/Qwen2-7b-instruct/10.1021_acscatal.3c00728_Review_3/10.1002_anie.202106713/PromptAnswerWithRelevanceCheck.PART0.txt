The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are enhanced through the incorporation of B active components into these structures. The use of 3-D porous frameworks allows for the creation of a vast surface area, which increases the number of potential active sites for catalysis. This enhances the catalytic performance by increasing the probability of substrate encountering an active site. The dispersion of active sites within the porous framework ensures that they are well-distributed, leading to uniform catalytic activity across the entire material. This is particularly advantageous for applications requiring high throughput and efficient conversion rates.

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include plasma treatments such as N2, O2, H2, and Ar. Plasma treatments can modify the surface properties and composition of the materials by breaking surface chemical bonds and forming new ones. This results in the creation of 3-D dispersed active sites within the porous frameworks. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the type of plasma used. For instance, N2 plasma was found to be particularly effective in enhancing the ODH reaction performance of the material, while O2 plasma had the opposite effect. The ability to tailor the local environment of the B-based materials by selecting appropriate plasma treatments enables the optimization of their catalytic properties for specific applications.

The incorporation of B active components into 3-D porous frameworks with 3-D dispersed active sites is achieved through plasma treatments. These treatments can introduce nitrogen defects, which can evolve into oxygen-containing boron species (BOx) during the ODH reaction of propane. This process is critical for enhancing the catalytic performance of the materials. The evolution of nitrogen defects into BOx species is a key mechanism behind the improved catalytic activity of the B-based materials. The presence of BOx species on the surface of the materials facilitates the conversion of propane to propylene, contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance.

The effectiveness of incorporating B active components into 3-D porous frameworks is evaluated based on the catalytic performance of the materials. Factors such as the type of plasma used, the resulting chemical environment of the materials, and the presence of active sites play crucial roles in determining the catalytic performance. The evaluation of these factors helps in understanding the mechanisms underlying the enhanced catalytic activity and guides the development of optimized B-based materials for specific catalytic applications.

B基于材料在三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构中的结构特征通过将B活性成分整合到这些结构中得到增强。三维多孔框架允许创建大量表面积，从而增加了潜在活性位点的数量，提高了催化性能。这种分布均匀的活性位点确保了整个材料的均匀催化活性，这对于需要高通量和高效转化率的应用特别有利。

用于将B活性成分整合到这些结构中的方法包括N2、O2、H2和Ar等气体的等离子体处理。等离子体处理可以通过破坏表面化学键并形成新的化学键来修改材料的表面性质和组成。这导致在多孔框架内产生三维分散的活性位点。这些方法的有效性根据所使用的等离子体类型而异。例如，N2等离子体被发现特别有效于提高材料的ODH反应性能，而O2等离子体则产生了相反的效果。通过选择适当的等离子体处理来调整B基材料的局部环境的能力使得优化其催化特性以适应特定应用成为可能。

通过等离子体处理将B活性成分整合到三维多孔框架中的过程是通过引入氮缺陷来实现的，这些氮缺陷可以进化成氧含硼物种（BOx）并在丙烷脱氢氧化反应期间催化丙烷转化为丙烯。这是提高材料催化性能的关键机制。氮缺陷向BOx物种的进化是B基材料增强催化性能的重要原因。表面的BOx物种的存在促进了丙烷到丙烯的转换，从而贡献了材料的增强催化性能。

整合B活性成分到三维多孔框架中的有效性基于材料的催化性能进行评估。因素如所使用的等离子体类型、材料的最终化学环境以及存在的活性位点在确定催化性能方面起着关键作用。对这些因素的评估有助于理解增强催化活性的机制，并指导B基材料的开发以适应特定的催化应用。

The research analyzes the structural characteristics of boron-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, focusing on how these features enhance catalytic performance. The study employs plasma treatment techniques to incorporate boron active components into these structures. N2 plasma is particularly effective, as it creates more three-boron center nitrogen-defects, which are considered favorable for generating active species. The incorporation of boron active components into the porous framework is facilitated by the plasma treatment methods. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For instance, N2 plasma is found to be superior for enhancing the catalytic performance of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions of propane to propylene. This is attributed to the formation of boron-nitrogen defects, which play a crucial role in facilitating the conversion of propane. The sintering effect of oxygen plasma, on the other hand, leads to a suppressed catalytic performance. The study suggests that the generation of nitrogen-defects and their evolution into boron-oxygen species during the ODH reaction contribute significantly to the catalytic activity.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, these features enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for reactions, allowing for more effective contact between reactants and active sites. The porous framework ensures a high density of these sites, which increases the likelihood of successful reactions. The 3-D dispersion allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, optimizing the catalytic cycle. The active sites are often located on the surface or edges of the particles, where reactions occur more frequently due to the higher energy levels.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures vary in effectiveness depending on the specific application. N2 plasma treatment creates more three-boron center N-defects, which are beneficial for catalytic reactions. This method is effective for enhancing activity by creating favorable sites for reactants to interact with. O2 plasma, on the other hand, introduces BOx species, which can lead to sintering and reduced activity, suggesting that this method may not be as effective for maintaining high catalytic performance. H2 plasma treatment generates N-H and B-H groups, which do not necessarily promote propane conversion, indicating that the type of functional groups created can impact the catalytic activity.

In conclusion, the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into porous frameworks depends on the plasma treatment used, with N2 plasma being particularly advantageous for creating an optimal structure that enhances catalytic performance. The methods must be carefully selected based on the desired outcomes and the specific requirements of the catalytic application.

分析硼基材料中三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特征，这些特征通过提供更大的反应面积来增强催化性能，使得反应物与活性位点的有效接触成为可能。多孔框架确保了高密度的活性位点，从而增加了反应物和产物之间相互作用的可能性。三维分散有助于更好地扩散反应物和产物，优化催化循环。活性位点通常位于颗粒表面或边缘，这些位置的能级更高，更有利于反应发生。

用于将硼活性成分引入这些结构的方法在不同应用中的有效性各不相同。氮气等离子体处理可以产生更多的三硼中心N缺陷，这对催化反应非常有利。这种方法对于增强活性尤其有效，因为它能够创建有利于反应物相互作用的理想位点。氧等离子体引入BOx物种，这可能导致烧结并降低活性，这表明这种方法可能不适合维持高催化性能。氢气等离子体处理会产生N-H和B-H基团，这些基团不一定促进丙烷转化，这表明生成的功能基团类型会影响催化活性。

综上所述，将硼活性成分引入多孔框架的有效性取决于所使用的等离子体处理方法，特别是N2等离子体处理特别有利于创建能够增强催化性能的理想结构。选择方法时必须根据期望的结果和催化应用的具体需求进行仔细考虑。

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these materials enhance catalytic performance through the creation of numerous active sites that facilitate reactions. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through various methods such as plasma treatment, which allows for the selective construction of boron sites with different local environments. 

The effectiveness of these methods varies based on the specific catalytic application. For instance, N2 plasma treatment was found to be highly effective in creating a catalyst (N2-BN) that exhibited remarkable activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. This catalyst achieved a 26.0% propane conversion rate with a high olefin selectivity of 89.4% at 520°C. The success can be attributed to the controlled breaking of chemical bonds by the N2 plasma, which led to the formation of more three-boron center N-defects, considered favorable sites for generating active species.

Conversely, O2 plasma treatment resulted in the introduction of BOx species, which had a negative impact on the catalytic performance, reducing propane conversion to 12.4% at the same temperature. This suggests that while plasma treatment can introduce boron sites, the type and nature of the introduced species significantly affect the catalytic activity.

Moreover, the generation of N-defects during plasma treatment, particularly under N2 plasma, was found to be advantageous. These N-defects, including three-boron center N-defects, play a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane to propylene. The results highlight the importance of understanding the role of specific boron species and their local environment in enhancing catalytic performance.

In summary, the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks depends on the type of plasma treatment used, the resulting boron species, and their local environment. Plasma treatment offers a feasible way to design functionalized or defects-rich catalysts that can be tailored for different catalytic applications by controlling the boron species and their distribution within the porous framework.

分析B基材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架的结构特征，涉及到理解这些材料如何通过增加大量活性位点来增强催化性能。将B活性成分融入这些结构通常采用多种方法，例如等离子体处理，这种方法允许选择性构建具有不同局部环境的硼位点。

这些方法在特定的催化应用中的有效性各不相同。例如，N2等离子体处理被发现对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应非常有效，生成的催化剂在520°C时实现了26.0%的丙烷转化率和89.4%的烯烃选择性。这种成功可以归因于N2等离子体的可控化学键断裂，导致形成了更多的三硼中心氮缺陷，被认为是产生活性物种的理想位置。

相反，O2等离子体处理引入了BOx物种，这对其催化性能产生了负面影响，使丙烷转化率降至12.4%。这表明虽然等离子体处理可以引入硼位点，但引入的物种类型和性质显著影响催化活性。

此外，等离子体处理期间生成的氮缺陷，尤其是N2等离子体处理期间生成的氮缺陷，被发现是至关重要的。这些氮缺陷，包括三硼中心氮缺陷，在促进丙烷转化为丙烯的反应中发挥了关键作用。结果强调了了解特定硼物种及其局部环境在增强催化性能方面的重要性。

综上所述，将B活性成分融入具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料中的多孔框架的有效性取决于所使用的等离子体处理类型、最终的硼物种以及它们在多孔框架内的分布。等离子体处理提供了一种设计功能化或缺陷丰富的催化剂的可行方法，可以通过控制硼物种及其分布来针对不同的催化应用进行定制。
