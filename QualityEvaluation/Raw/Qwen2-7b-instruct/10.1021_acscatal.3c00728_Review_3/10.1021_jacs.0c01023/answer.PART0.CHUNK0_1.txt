The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involve a spherical superstructure derived from boron-containing metalorganic frameworks (MOFs). This superstructure features high porosity and large surface area, which are advantageous for enhancing catalytic performance. The B active components are incorporated into the porous frameworks via a straightforward hydrothermal process. These materials demonstrate enhanced catalytic activity for various reactions because of the 3-D dispersed active sites within the porous structure.
