ABSTRACT
We investigate the structural and vibrational properties of glassy
B
2
O
3
using first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, we determine the boroxol rings fraction
f
for which there is still no consensus in the literature. Two numerical models containing either a low or a high level of boroxol rings are tested against a gamut of experimental probes (static structure factor, Raman,
B
11
and
O
17
NMR data). We show that only the boroxol-rich model (
f
=
75
%
) can reproduce the full set of observables. Total-energy calculations show that at the glass density, boroxol-rich structures are favored by about
6
kcal
/
(

boroxol
)
. Finally, the liquid state is explored in the 2000–4000 K range and a reduction of
f
to 10%–20% is obtained.
