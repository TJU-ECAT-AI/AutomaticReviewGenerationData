Boron and Boron-Containing Catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane
Graphical Abstract
In B major: Multiple boron-containing materials, as well as elemental boron, are active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane reaction as a method to form small olefins.
Abstract
Boron nitride was recently identified as a highly selective catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. In this communication, we report that other boron-containing materials such as boron carbide, titanium boride, nickel boride, cobalt boride, hafnium boride, and tungsten boride, as well as elemental boron itself, show the same exceptional behavior as boron nitride. X-ray photoelectron and infrared spectroscopy suggest oxyfunctionalization of the surface. This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts.
The oxidative dehydrogenation of small alkanes presents a potentially economically attractive method for the production of building-block olefins.1, 2 Indeed, compared to the state-of-the-art dehydrogenation technology, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) requires lower reaction temperatures owing to the exothermicity of the oxidation and eliminates the need for catalyst regeneration.3, 4 However, the key scientific hurdle to translate this chemistry into industrial use is to limit facile overoxidation of the desired olefin product to CO and CO2 (COx).5, 6
We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),7 n-butane, and isobutane8 to form the corresponding olefins selectively. In these works, we provided kinetic and spectroscopic evidence that proved adsorbed oxygen played an essential role in the observed catalysis. Alkane conversion was only realized in the presence of oxygen, and the rate of alkane consumption was dependent on the surface activation of oxygen. As well, the BN surface was functionalized by oxygen (i.e., formation of B−OH and B−O species) only in the presence of both oxygen and alkane. Recent independent studies corroborated these results, agreeing that adsorbed oxygen was necessary for BN to catalyze the ODH of propane9 and ethane10, 11 to form selectively propylene and ethylene, respectively.
In this contribution, we show that the unprecedented selectivity to olefins in ODH reactions is not exclusive to BN materials but can be offered by many different compounds comprising boron. Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions (Figure 1). High selectivity to propylene is achieved by using these B-containing catalysts, and the main byproduct is ethylene, rather than COx. Conversely, a nitrogen-containing catalyst, titanium nitride (TiN), also catalyzes the ODHP reaction, yet it does not result in the same high selectivity to propylene as that seen with B-containing catalysts. Moreover, the main byproduct with the use of TiN is undesired COx. We therefore conclude that boron is the necessary element to achieve high olefin selectivity.

The various B-containing materials differ in their catalytic performance only in the rates of propane consumption (Figure 2). Of the boron-containing catalysts tested, B4C and WB are the most and least reactive, respectively, and they differ in their specific rates of propane consumption per gram of catalyst by a factor of approximately 5. As was previously observed,7 the rate of propane consumption does not scale with the surface area of the boron-containing catalyst (Table 1), and disparities are more likely as a result of differences in the active-site densities and/or the electronic interactions between the catalyst surface and the bulk structure. Parallels can be drawn between the catalysts presented here and supported VOx catalysts for the ODHP, for which in the latter the support has a significant effect upon the observed rate. This effect is attributed to an electronic influence exerted by the support on the structurally identical VO4 active sites present on the surface.12 The identical product selectivity obtained with these electronically and structurally different bulk compounds suggests that each material, regardless of the non-boron constituent element within each compound, contains similar surface active sites that do not directly involve the non-boron constituent element.

To elucidate further the role of boron as the element responsible for the ODH activity and to decouple the influence of the non-boron constituent element within the tested materials, the catalytic activity of elemental boron was also evaluated. Boron is not only active for the ODHP but retains significant propylene selectivity at high alkane conversions (Figure 1). Furthermore, the reactivity of elemental B far exceeds that of other boron-containing materials, and it achieves specific rates approximately 31 times higher than hBN and approximately 19 times higher than B4C. This combination of high reactivity and selectivity leads to an observed propylene productivity of 11.9 kg  kg−1cat h−1 at 9.8 % propane conversion, the highest reported within the ODHP literature to date (Figure 3).

To identify structural similarities between the tested catalysts that lead to the observed activity, spectroscopic characterization was undertaken. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the elemental surface compositions of the fresh and spent catalysts (Table S2 in the Supporting Information). With the exception of fresh hBN, which contains a roughly equivalent ratio of B and N atoms at its surface, it appears that the fresh materials actually contain very little of the non-boron elements at the surface. For example, Ni atoms comprise less than 10 % of the surface atoms of fresh NiB. Instead, the surfaces of all the fresh catalysts are enriched with B and O atoms. Even in the case of elemental B, the surface oxygen content amounts to 17 % prior to the catalytic tests. Upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, surface oxygen concentrations increase, whereas concentrations of non-boron elements decrease. The only exception is HfB2, which sees a marginal increase in the surface Hf content from 2.5 to 3.5 % after the reaction. The substantially lower concentration of surface oxygen in hBN relative to that in the other B-containing catalysts might be explained by its exceptional resistance to oxidation.13 Indeed, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of these B-containing compounds shows that the mass of hBN remains unchanged up to 800 °C under flowing air (Figure S1). In contrast, the other B-containing catalysts show a mass increase owing to their oxidation. Similar changes in the elemental surface compositions of these B-containing catalysts after exposure to the ODHP reaction support the hypothesis that similar active sites are present on these surfaces, which leads to identical product distributions. The increased oxygen contents at the surfaces of the spent catalysts suggest that oxygen is functionalized onto the surfaces of B-containing catalysts during the ODHP reaction to form “BOx” active sites, which play a critical role in the ODHP reaction. Further inspection of the XPS data reveals a systematic shift towards higher binding energies of the B 1s electrons (Figure 4), which indicates changes in the molecular environment of the boron atoms. With the exception of structurally different hBN, all fresh B-containing catalysts show two distinct peaks at different binding energies, one at approximately 194 eV (assigned to B−O coordination)14, 15 and another at <190 eV (assigned to B−B coordination).16 Features <190 eV vary in their binding energies depending on the identities and quantities of the neighboring element, X (X=C, Ti, Ni, etc.), with some B−X coordination also potentially contributing to this feature.16, 17 Upon exposure to the reaction conditions, the existing peak at 194 eV increases in intensity or even shifts to slightly higher binding energies, which evidences the oxidation of the B atoms. Moreover, the features <190 eV disappear in spent B-containing catalysts, which indicates that all of the exposed surface B atoms become coordinated to oxygen after the ODHP reaction. The notable exception is hBN, which maintains its feature at approximately 191 eV (assigned to B−N coordination),16, 18 even after exposure to the ODHP reaction, and only shows a new small feature at approximately 194 eV in the spent material owing to O coordination. This can be explained by the oxidation-resistance properties inherent of hBN detailed above. Notably, the X-ray photoelectron spectral regions of the constituent elements (i.e., C 1s, Ti 2p, Ni 2p, N 1s, Co 2p, Hf 4d, and W 4f) do not show the same shifts toward higher binding energies upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, which suggests oxygen does not coordinate to these elements. These mentioned X-ray photoelectron spectral regions do, however, show the disappearance of a small feature in the spent materials, which can be explained by the disappearance of a small quantity of B−X surface coordination sites once exposed to the ODHP reaction. The Ti 2p XPS region is highlighted in Figure S2 for fresh and spent TiB2 and is representative of the mentioned X-ray photoelectron spectral regions of the B-containing materials in this work.

These data could suggest that the active sites of these B-containing catalysts might be a layer of B2O3 formed on the surface. However, we are able to reject this possibility by considering that the reaction temperature (500 °C) exceeds the melting point of B2O3 (≈450 °C) and, thus, would result in B2O3 gradually leaching off of the B-containing catalysts leading to an observed deactivation. Such a result was previously observed for Al2O3-supported B2O3 catalysts.19 The strong catalytic stability of hBN was already evidenced in separate studies, and it showed stable propane conversion for 3 days7 and 13 days on stream.9 Here, we additionally report that B4C shows a stable propylene yield for approximately 2 days on stream after an initial induction period during the first day on stream (Figure S3). If B2O3 were indeed forming and leaching from the surface, we would not expect to observe stabilization of conversion but rather should see continual deactivation. Moreover, rather than observing a loss in catalyst mass after the ODHP reaction as a result of leaching of B2O3, we report that the masses of these materials actually increase after use in the ODHP reaction (Table S1), likely caused by O functionalization of the surfaces. Use of attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) shows that a B−OH feature (broad spectral feature at ≈3250 cm−1)7, 8, 20 only appears on spent hBN and elemental B (Figure S4). Shi et al. also observed the emergence of the B−OH feature in their hydroxylated hBN material and proposed that the generation of B−OH was required to observe catalysis of the ODHP reaction.9, 10 The presence of the B−OH feature in the B2O3 reference and its absence in all boride catalysts (other than hBN and elemental B) supports our assertion that B2O3 is not significantly formed during the ODHP reaction. Our hypothesis agrees with experimental evidence provided by Huang et al., who did not observe the presence of B−OH under in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurement upon using hBN for the ODH of ethane.11 These observations suggest that B−OH may not be present in significant quantities during the ODH reaction and rather may be formed upon hydration by ambient moisture.
A reason as to why the catalytic activity of boron is increased relative to that of the other boride compounds is unclear at the moment. The increased surface area of elemental boron (12 m2 g−1) is not likely to be the root cause, as Table S1 shows that the areal rate of elemental boron is not the highest amongst the tested catalysts and is comparable to that of Co2B/Co3B and lower than that of NiB. TGA presented in Figure S1 shows that elemental boron can be oxidized to a greater extent than the other boron compounds. Under ODH conditions, for which it was shown that hBN was readily oxidized in the presence of the alkane substrate,7, 8 elemental boron may generate higher quantities of BOx active sites per mass of catalyst upon its oxidation. Along these lines, the extent of the oxidation of the surfaces of these boron materials and, thus, the active-site density may be influenced by the crystal structure of the material (Table S1 shows the crystal structures of the tested boride catalysts). Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), which would thus affect the formation of BOx species during ODH. Investigations to determine the role of the crystal structures on BOx formation are underway.
In conclusion, we revealed that the exceptionally high selectivity to olefins under oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane reaction conditions was not unique to boron nitride (BN) materials but rather included B-containing compounds such as elemental B, B4C, TiB2, NiB, CoB, HfB2, WB, and likely others. These B-containing catalysts were found to have similar surface elemental compositions, primarily composed of B and O atoms, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Boron–oxygen coordination was confirmed for spent B-containing compounds from observed shifts to higher binding energies of the B 1s XPS feature. The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins. The reactivity differences between elemental boron and boron-containing materials may be owing to active-site density and electronic interactions between surface BOx species and the subsurface bulk structure. Efforts to elucidate these effects on reactivity further are currently ongoing.

Upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, surface oxygen concentrations increase, whereas concentrations of non-boron elements decrease. The only exception is HfB2, which sees a marginal increase in the surface Hf content from 2.5 to 3.5 % after the reaction. The substantially lower concentration of surface oxygen in hBN relative to that in the other B-containing catalysts might be explained by its exceptional resistance to oxidation.13 Indeed, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of these B-containing compounds shows that the mass of hBN remains unchanged up to 800 °C under flowing air (Figure S1). In contrast, the other B-containing catalysts show a mass increase owing to their oxidation. Similar changes in the elemental surface compositions of these B-containing catalysts after exposure to the ODHP reaction support the hypothesis that similar active sites are present on these surfaces, which leads to identical product distributions.

Further inspection of the XPS data reveals a systematic shift towards higher binding energies of the B 1s electrons (Figure 4), which indicates changes in the molecular environment of the boron atoms. With the exception of structurally different hBN, all fresh B-containing catalysts show two distinct peaks at different binding energies, one at approximately 194 eV (assigned to B−O coordination)14, 15 and another at <190 eV (assigned to B−B coordination).16 Features <190 eV vary in their binding energies depending on the identities and quantities of the neighboring element, X (X=C, Ti, Ni, etc.), with some B−X coordination also potentially contributing to this feature.16, 17 Upon exposure to the reaction conditions, the existing peak at 194 eV increases in intensity or even shifts to slightly higher binding energies, which evidences the oxidation of the B atoms. Moreover, the features <190 eV disappear in spent B-containing catalysts, which indicates that all of the exposed surface B atoms become coordinated to oxygen after the ODHP reaction. The notable exception is hBN, which maintains its feature at approximately 191 eV (assigned to B−N coordination),16, 18 even after exposure to the ODHP reaction, and only shows a new small feature at approximately 194 eV in the spent material owing to O coordination. This can be explained by the oxidation-resistance properties inherent of hBN detailed above. Notably, the X-ray photoelectron spectral regions of the constituent elements (i.e., C 1s, Ti 2p, Ni 2p, N 1s, Co 2p, Hf 4d, and W 4f) do not show the same shifts toward higher binding energies upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, which suggests oxygen does not coordinate to these elements. These mentioned X-ray photoelectron spectral regions do, however, show the disappearance of a small feature in the spent materials, which can be explained by the disappearance of a small quantity of B−X surface coordination sites once exposed to the ODHP reaction. The Ti 2p XPS region is highlighted in Figure S2 for fresh and spent TiB2 and is representative of the mentioned X-ray photoelectron spectral regions of the B-containing materials in this work.
