Abstract
Boron-containing zeolites have been demonstrated as active catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propene. The challenge is that the origin of the boron active sites remains an unsolved issue. In this study, self-pillared boron-containing MFI zeolite nanosheets with an ultrathin b-axis were synthesized, which exhibited low-temperature activity and stability in the ODHP process. A combination of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform, two-dimensional 11B multiple-quantum MAS NMR, and 11B{1H} dipolar-heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation NMR measurements revealed that the MFI zeolite nanosheets with the characteristics of a high specific surface area and abundant Si–OH groups allowed dynamic self-dispersion of highly mobile boron clusters through condensation with surrounding Si–OH groups. The increased number of stable and dispersed oligomeric boron species was responsible for the enhanced catalytic performance and stability in the ODHP process. The catalysts were active at a temperature as low as 390 °C. Upon raising the temperature to 430 °C, a propane conversion of 14.1% could be achieved together with a selectivity of 80.1% toward all olefins.

Introduction
A series of boron-based heterogeneous catalysts have shown remarkable catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propene, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), metal borides, elemental boron, the loaded B2O3/silica catalyst, and so on. (1−9) Nevertheless, a relatively high reaction temperature, for example, up to 530 °C, was required to achieve efficient conversion of propane over these boron-based catalysts. One of the main reasons is the insufficient exposure of active sites on these catalysts with a low surface area. (10) Zeolites commonly feature a high specific surface area, uniform distribution of active sites, and high thermal stability and are widely used in organic synthesis, petrochemistry, and oil refining. (11−14) Boron-containing zeolites have been proved as the promising catalysts in ODHP, which could maximize the number of accessible active boron species, further promoting the activity and stability of the ODH reaction. (10,15)
The identification of the active boron species in these catalysts has been the subject of many recent studies. (6,10,16−19) Structural analysis of solid-state 11B MAS NMR showed that boron species in the synthesized zeolites were classified into four types, that is, trigonal boroxol ring, framework trigonal B(OSi)xOH3–x (x = 1, 2), B(OSi)3 species without B–OH groups, and little amount of tetra-coordinated species. (7) It has been generally accepted that the tri-coordinated defective boron oligomers on the surface of the zeolite play a key role in the ODH reaction. (10,19−21) However, the boron species were mobile under reaction conditions (∼500 °C), and the catalyst may experience a decrease of the activity in ODHP process because of the loss of the aggregated boron species. (17) Hence, the urgent task is to achieve a boron-containing zeolite catalyst with high dispersion of active and stable boron species.
Likely, zeolite nanosheets could be an ideal choice because the 2D structure indeed endows them with high specific surface areas (∼800 m2/g), large numbers of accessible active sites, and abundant Si–OH group defects on the b-axis plane. (22−25) In the present work, self-pillared boron-containing MFI zeolite nanosheets (BZS) with an ultrathin b-axis were synthesized by using tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) as the structure-directing agent, which were then investigated for the ODHP reaction. The results showed that the BZS catalysts exhibited remarkable low-temperature activity and stability. To our surprise, the initially aggregated boron clusters automatically redispersed into more stable and dispersed oligomeric boron species under the reaction conditions through the condensation of B–OH with Si–OH. Such in situ dynamic structure evolution is responsible for the promoted low-temperature catalytic activity and stability of ODHP.
Results and Discussion
Structure and Property of the Catalysts
Figure S1a–c show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the BZS catalysts. All the prepared BZS catalysts were composed of crystalline spherical particles and had a highly roughened external surface. (26) The sizes of the BZS catalysts became larger with an increase in the molar ratio of B2O3/SiO2 in the gel, varying from 130 nm of BZS-1, 170 nm of BZS-3 to 260 nm of BZS-5. The fine spherical structure was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1a–c). Remarkably, the spherical particles of BZS-1 and BZS-3 were assembled by flat nanosheets with an average size of 2–5 nm along the b-axis. Moreover, the nanosheets arranged perpendicularly to each other and formed the “house-of-cards” structure and abundant mesopores, leading to the enhanced availability of active boron sites in the zeolite structure. (25,27) When the molar ratio of B2O3/SiO2 was further increased to 0.18, the BZS-5 catalyst was composed of ragged and randomly oriented zeolite nanosheets, which showed a limited proportion of mesopore structure compared with BZS-1 and BZS-3 catalysts. Moreover, Figure S1d showed that the CBZ catalyst exhibited typical spherical morphology with an average particle size of 180 nm.

As shown in Figures 1d and S2, the BZS and SPS catalysts showed characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to the plane indices of (101), (200), (501), and (303), which were assigned to the MFI framework. (28,29) The corresponding XRD peaks for the (hkl) crystal plane did not appear, and the diffraction peaks of the (h0l) reflection were widened. This was attributed not only to the small particle size of self-pillared zeolite nanosheets but also to the ultrathin crystal a,c-plane directions. (22,30,31) The crystal growth along the b-axis plane was inhibited because of either repetitive vertical growth of nanosheets or the relatively longer organic alkyl groups of the TBA+ rather than that of TPA+ molecules. (27) The crystallinity of the BZS catalysts exhibited a slight decrease with an increase in the molar ratio of B2O3/SiO2, indicating that the introduction of boron inhibited the crystallization process of boron-containing MFI zeolite. (32) The XRD pattern of the CBZ catalyst (Figure S3) possessed similar diffraction peaks to the bulk MFI zeolite (JCPDS no.: 44-0003). (33,34)Figure 1e shows the FT-IR spectra of the as-synthesized BZS catalysts. One to note, the peak at ca. 1650 cm–1 represented the vibration of physically adsorbed molecular water. (35,36) The vibrational band at 790 cm–1 and the region between 1000 and 1300 cm–1 were assigned to the characteristic of SiO4 tetrahedra. (32) The BZS catalysts exhibited abundant Si–OH groups at 948 cm–1. (36,37) The evidence for the incorporation of boron atoms into the framework of zeolite was the presence of the band at 926 cm–1 that could be attributed to the stretching vibrations of the Si–O–B moiety in the BZS catalysts. (38,39) The band at 1400 cm–1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of tri-coordinated BO3 species. (40,41) The N2 sorption isotherms of the BZS catalysts exhibited a type-IV isotherm with a type-H3 hysteresis loop in the medium-high specific pressure region (P/P0 = 0.70∼0.99), indicating that considerable plate-like mesopores formed through repetitive branching of the zeolite nanosheets (Figure S4). The BZS catalysts exhibited a hierarchical structure with three classes of porosity in one structure: the intrinsic micropores of the zeolite framework together with mesopores around 4 nm because of repetitive branching of nanosheets and some intercrystalline mesopores around 30 nm stemming from the complex intergrown structure (Figure S5). Because of poor crystallinity of BZS-5 compared with the other two BZS catalysts, only a small amount of mesopores existed in it. It was noted that the specific surface areas gradually decreased from 783 m2/g of BZS-1 to 753 m2/g of BZS-3 and 606 m2/g of BZS-5 (Table S1), which corresponded to gradually decreased crystallinity of the BZS catalysts. However, the bulk CBZ catalyst showed a type-I isotherm, featuring predominantly micropores that existed in the CBZ catalyst (Figure S4). The pore size distributions showed the presence of mesopores around 30 nm (Figure S5), derived from the interparticle voids of the uniform-sized nanocrystals. (42) It possessed a much lower specific surface area of 319 m2/g than the BZS catalysts, which could lead to the lack of Si–OH groups and insufficient exposure of boron species. (22) The profiles of NH3 desorption during TPD indicated the presence of one approximate weak acid site in the CBZ and BZS catalysts, whose desorption temperature was about 156 °C (Figure S6). (21) Moreover, the amount of adsorbed NH3 was approximately proportional to the boron content of the catalysts (Table S1).
Catalytic Performance of the Catalysts
The different structures of the catalysts drove us to further explore the influence of the unique zeolite nanosheet structure on the ODHP activity. The outcome demonstrated that the pure-silica SPS catalyst was catalytically inert (∼0.5% propane conversion at 530 °C), indicating the important role of boron species in the ODHP reaction. It was noted that just 3.3% of propane was converted on the bulk MFI-type CBZ catalyst with a spherical morphology at 530 °C, while remarkable conversion of propane was observed on the BZS catalysts with a self-pillared MFI zeolite nanosheet morphology. As shown in Figure 2a, all the BZS catalysts exhibited an approximate evolution time (∼2 h) to reach a steady platform of propane conversion at 500 °C during the induction period of the ODHP process. For example, propane conversion over the BZS-3 catalyst increased from 25.4 to 41.6% during the induction period at 500 °C. Activated catalysts with stable performance were used for all subsequent catalytic tests. The BZS-3 catalyst showed the best catalytic performance (Figure 2b), indicating that the optimum B2O3/SiO2 molar ratio was 0.12. The propane conversion and selectivity toward all olefins of BZS-3 were accordingly 14.1 and 80.1% achieved at 430 °C (Figures S7 and S8). The BZS-1 and BZS-2 catalysts showed a propane conversion lower than 3% while that of BZS-4 and BZS-5 had a reduced value of 6.1 and 5.4% at 430 °C, respectively. The lower specific surface area and larger particle size could be important factors, leading to the decrease in catalytic performance of BZS-4 and BZS-5. In addition, the BZS-4 and BZS-5 catalysts exhibited similar catalytic behavior in the temperature range (400–450 °C) of catalytic tests, which may be due to the compromised effect between the increased boron content and decreased specific surface area (Table S1). (21) The lower catalytic activity of the BZS-1 and BZS-2 catalysts may be due to their lower boron content (Table S1). BZS-3 also showed a high propene formation rate of 14 × 10–3 molC3H6 molB–1 s–1 at 430 °C, which far exceeded the activity of other boron-based catalysts (Table S2), such as h-BN (∼0.3 × 10–3 molC3H6 molB–1 s–1, 530 °C), (1,2) layered borosilicate MWW-type zeolite (∼1.8 × 10–3 molC3H6 molB–1 s–1, 530 °C), (10) and BOS-10 (∼2.8 × 10–3 molC3H6 molB–1 s–1, 450 °C). (19) The corresponding O2 conversion of all BZS catalysts showed a similar trend to propane with the temperature, accompanied by a slightly higher value than that of C3H8 (Figure S9). By operating the catalytic tests at different feed gas (O2/C3H8) ratios, one can conclude that an increase in propane conversion and a decrease in olefins selectivity were obtained as the O2/C3H8 ratio increased by maintaining a constant reaction temperature (Table S3). Moreover, the apparent activation energies of propane over BZS-1, BZS-3, and BZS-5 were estimated to be 172, 181, and 171 kJ/mol, respectively (Figure 2c). These values were quite approximate, indicating that similar reaction processes existed on the BZS catalysts. In addition, BZS-3 was applied for the catalytic stability test (Figure 2d). The result showed that during the 60-h operation at 430 °C, the propane conversion and product selectivity remained almost unchanged (∼80% selectivity of total olefins at 14.1% propane conversion). Furthermore, the boron content of the catalyst after 5-h activation (activated catalyst after the induction period) and after 60-h operation showed approximate values of 0.88 and 0.85 wt%, demonstrating the remarkable stability of BZS-3. More significantly, BZS-3 exhibited a propane conversion of 1.9% even at a temperature as low as 390 °C which was considerably lower than that required by most of the metal-free catalysts. (19) As shown in Figure S10, the kinetic measurements showed that the reaction orders were about 0.47 for oxygen and 1.91 for propane, which suggested that the BZS-3 catalyst had a similar reaction mechanism to h-BN and layered borosilicate MWW-type zeolite of the previous reports. (3,10) Under these considerations, in the following, sample BZS-3 was used for further study.

Identification of the Possible Active Boron Species
An induction period was observed on the BZS-3 catalyst (Figure 2a) which was also found in h-BN-catalyzing ODH reactions. (2,43) To better explore the structure of active boron sites and their corresponding evolution during the induction period, two-dimensional 11B multiple-quantum MAS (2D 11B MQMAS) NMR and 11B MAS NMR spectra were used to identify the boron species over the fresh and spent BZS-3 catalysts. The sliced spectra were extracted from the indirect dimension of 2D 11B MQMAS NMR to determine the 11B isotropic chemical shift (δiso(11B)) and quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ). As shown in Figure 3, five types of boron species were observed on the fresh BZS-3 catalyst with isotropic chemical shifts δiso(11B) at 19.4, 18.8, 16.1, 15.5, and 10.2 ppm. Four types of boron species were observed on the spent BZS-3 catalyst with δiso(11B) at 17.0, 14.0, 13.5, and 11.0 ppm. These peaks were analytically simulated by quadrupolar line shape with a quadrupole coupling constant (CQ) at 2.1–3.0 MHz. Detailed spectral parameters (δiso, δapp, CQ, and η) are listed in Table S4, where δapp represents the apparent chemical shift for direct 11B NMR observations, caused by the effect of the isotropic quadrupolar shift and the second-order quadrupolar broadening. It is worth noting that no tetra-coordinated boron species existed in the zeolite framework. The relative content of each boron species was identified by 11B MAS NMR (Figure 5a,b). Considering the fact that boron content decreased from 1.08 to 0.88 wt% after 5 h operation (Table S1), it could be interpreted as partial leaching of excess unstable boron-rich clusters from the catalyst surface in the form of boric acid may exist during the ODHP process before catalytic activity was stabilized. (15,44)

2D 11B{1H} dipolar-heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation (D-HMQC) NMR spectra could aid in the identification of boron species with B–OH functionality (Figure 6). (45) We noted that four sites (sites A, B, F, and G) were not observed in the 2D 11B{1H} D-HMQC spectra (Figure 6), which may be ascribed to boron species without hydroxyl groups. Thus, they should be fully incorporated into the MFI zeolite framework. Based on well-established knowledge in the literature and the low observed δiso(11B), sites A and F with relatively lower chemical shifts were assigned to B(OSi)3 species, while sites B and G were ascribed to B(OB)(OSi)2 species (Table 1). By comparing the content of boron species from 11B MAS NMR, one can see that both B(OSi)3 and B(OB)(OSi)2 species remained relatively constant during the induction period (Figure 5a,b and Table S4). 2D 11B{1H} D-HMQC spectra displayed intense 1H NMR signals at ca. 3 ppm correlating to 11B NMR signals with δapp(11B) at ca. 8.5, 11.5, and 12.5 ppm (Figure 6). The 1H NMR signal at ca. 3 ppm was assigned to the B–OH group, similar to that observed in B-MWW and BS-1. (15−18) 2D 11B{1H} D-HMQC NMR revealed that there were three unique boron species containing hydroxyl groups with δiso(11B) at ca. 19 ppm (sites D and E), 17 ppm (site I), and 14–16 ppm (sites C and H) over the fresh and spent BZS catalysts. As is known, δiso(11B) decreased when B–O–B groups were replaced with B–O–Si and increased as B–O–B groups were replaced with B–O–H. (46,47) The decrease in the 11B NMR signal at δiso(11B) 14–16 ppm was likely a result of replacing a B–O–B group with B–O–Si, suggesting that this species corresponded to B(OH)(OSi)2 (Table 1). (17,46,48) The 1H NMR signal at ca. 1.9 ppm was assigned to isolated silanol (Si–OH) groups (Figure 6). A 1H-11B correlation between the 11B NMR signals at ca. 8.5 ppm and a 1H NMR signal at ca. 1.9 ppm was observed (sites C and H), corresponding to the strong interactions between B–OH groups of B(OH)(OSi)2 species and isolated silanols. On the basis of the 11B NMR signal with a high δiso(11B) at ca. 19 ppm, we assigned sites D and E to B(OB)x(OH)3–x (x = 1–2) aggregated boron cluster species, exhibiting at least one B–O–H and B–O–B bond (Table 1). (17,49) Furthermore, these aggregated boron cluster species may exist in the form of a boroxol ring or linear chain-type BOx. The correlation between the 11B NMR signals at 12.5 ppm and the 1H NMR signal at ca. 1.9 ppm indicated that boron atoms of sites D and E showed a relatively short 1H-11B internuclear distance to the hydrogen proton of Si–OH groups (Figure 6a), (50) while the correlation between the 11B NMR signals at 11.5 ppm and the 1H NMR signal at ca. 1.9 ppm disappeared after the induction period (Figure 6b), suggesting that there were no Si–OH groups surrounding the boron atoms of site I.

Table 1. Structures of Boron Species Existing in the Fresh and Spent BZS-3 and CBZ Catalysts
Sites D and E totally disappeared after the induction period, accompanied by a dramatically increased quantity of site I. Because the zeolite nanosheets have abundant Si–OH defects, it could be deduced that there was dynamic redispersion and reconstruction of aggregated boron species through the reaction with silanol groups under ODHP conditions. Boron species were highly mobile on the zeolite surface at elevated temperatures in the presence of water. The fresh catalyst may undergo dynamic evolution of the microenvironment of boron atoms on the zeolite catalysts and the breaking of B–O–B bonds via water molecule-generated under ODH conditions attacking the bridging O site of the B–O–B bond. (19) Newly exposed boron species may migrate to neighboring Si–OH groups and dehydrate to form a Si–O–B bond. Hence, site I could be ascribed to B(OX)(OH)(OSi) (X = B or H) oligomeric boron species (Table 1), which possessed a relatively lower degree of polymerization compared with sites D and E.
2D 11B MQMAS NMR and 11B MAS NMR spectra were used to identify the boron species over the fresh and spent CBZ catalysts. As shown in Figure 4, four types of boron species were observed on the fresh and spent CBZ catalysts with isotropic chemical shifts δiso(11B) at around 18.2–18.6, 14.3–14.5, 13.7–13.8, and 9.2–9.3 ppm. The corresponding boron species and detailed spectral parameters (δiso, δapp, CQ, and η) are listed in Tables 1 and S5. It was noted that the majority boron atoms were inserted into the framework of the bulk CBZ catalyst (sites a, b, c, e, f, and g), exhibiting at least two Si–O–B bonds (Table 1). The CBZ catalyst possessed a fraction of polymeric boron species far lower than that of the BZS-3 catalyst (6.1 vs 55.5%), which was considered as the main active center for the low-temperature ODHP reaction. (10,19,51) Consequently, the CBZ catalyst maintained a low propane conversion of 3.3% at 530 °C throughout the initial stage of ODHP (Figure S11). In addition, there were no significant changes of boron species in the CBZ catalyst after 5 h operation (Figure 5c,d and Table S5), being consistent with the absence of the induction period of the CBZ catalyst. This result indicates that the bulk structure of the CBZ catalyst is unfavorable for the formation of polymeric boron species.
In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy coupled with online mass spectroscopy (MS) was used to monitor the structure changes of the fresh BZS-3 catalyst and the products during the induction period (Figure 7). When the feed gas was switched from N2 to C3H8/N2 or O2/N2 atmosphere, no signals of DRIFT difference spectra and MS were detected, indicating the stability of the BZS-3 catalyst structure and the catalytic inertness of boron species under anaerobic conditions (Figure 7a). When the catalyst was purged with C3H8/O2/N2 atmospheres, the consumption of propane and the formation of propene and H2O were observed (Figure 7b,c), confirming that the ODHP process could occur only with cofeeding of propane and oxygen. At the same time, there were two types of sharp characteristic peaks at ∼3740 and ∼3700 cm–1 in the DRIFT difference spectra, which were related to the stretching vibrations of terminal Si–OH and B–OH groups. (46) In addition, a broad and strong alkyl stretching signal around 2965 cm–1 was attributable to the presence of propane in the gas phase. (3,51)
Figure 7

With the increase of reaction time, there was a continuous decrease of the alkyl stretching signal, showing the enhanced specific activity of propane during the induction period (Figure 2a). Meanwhile, the Si–OH signal at 3740 cm–1 gradually decreased combined with the increase of B–OH at 3700 cm–1. These results suggested that there was structure evolution of boron species during the induction period, which leads to higher catalytic activity. Combined with the results of NMR measurements, more dispersed oligomeric boron species (site I) obtained during the induction period could expose more B–OH groups than that of the original boron clusters (sites D and E). Therefore, the increased amount of B–OH groups could be due to the transformation of highly mobile aggregated boron species into more oligomeric ones. The redispersion and reconstruction of the boron species led to the increased exposure of B–OH groups. Through the condensation of B–OH with Si–OH, the boron species could be anchored in the framework of the zeolite nanosheets, which ensured its catalytic stability during the ODHP conditions. Hence, the decreased intensity of Si–OH was observed accompanied by the increased amount of B–OH groups. Previous reports confirmed that B–OH groups at the edge of h-BN could efficiently catalyze the ODHP reaction with superior catalytic performance and selectivity toward propene. (2) Furthermore, the boron sites with more OH groups were easier to dehydrogenate by dioxygen, further triggering the ODH reaction. (19)
For boron-containing zeolites reported in previous studies, boron species usually exhibited the formation of B[3]a species in aggregated form at the cost of B[3]b and B[3]c species during the ODHP reaction. (10,19) However, a new pathway in the formation of boron oligomers was observed over the BZS-3 catalyst with the morphology of 2D MFI zeolite nanosheets. With the characteristics of a large specific surface area and abundant Si–OH groups, the BZS-3 catalyst enabled the redispersion of highly mobile boron clusters and condensation with surrounding Si–OH groups, forming more stable and dispersed oligomeric boron species. Taking into consideration of the increased propane conversion (25.4–41.6%) during the induction period, it could be inferred that the aggregated boron clusters (sites D and E) redispersed into more dispersed oligomeric boron species (site I) on this unique structure of zeolite nanosheets are responsible for the low-temperature catalytic activity and stability of the ODHP process.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the self-pillared boron-containing MFI zeolite nanosheets with an ultrathin b-axis can be prepared as active catalysts for ODHP. Benefiting from the characteristics of a large specific surface area and abundant Si–OH groups, the MFI nanosheets exhibited a new pathway of structure evolution of boron species during the induction period. Combining with a series of structure characterization methods, we supposed that the fresh catalyst allowed the redispersion of highly mobile aggregated boron clusters and the condensation of B–OH with Si–OH. As a consequence, more stable and dispersed oligomeric boron species were strongly anchored in the zeolite framework, promoting the low-temperature catalytic activity and stability during the ODHP process.
Methods
Synthesis of the BZS Catalysts
The self-pillared boron-containing zeolite nanosheet precursor was synthesized hydrothermally according to an earlier report with slight modifications. (27,52) First, 14.323 g TBAOH (Aladdin, 25 wt% in H2O) was dissolved in 0.850 g deionized water with vigorous stirring at 35 °C for 10 min, Then, boric acid (Sinopharm) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. Finally, 9.583 g TEOS (Sinopharm) was added and then the mixture was stirred for 14 h to obtain a gel with a molar composition of 1SiO2:xB2O3:0.3TBAOH:10H2O (x = 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, 0.15, and 0.18). The gel was sealed into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 115 °C under static conditions for 6 days. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was centrifuged, dried, and finally calcined at 550 °C in air for 12 h to remove the templating agent. The obtained self-pillared boron-containing zeolite nanosheets were denoted as BZS-n (where n represents the molar ratio of B2O3/SiO2 in the gel, for example, BZS-1 refers to the B2O3/SiO2 molar ratio of 0.06).
Synthesis of the SPS Catalyst
The synthesis of pure-silica self-pillared MFI zeolite nanosheets was similar to above but without the introduction of boric acid. (27,52) First, 14.323 g TBAOH (Aladdin, 25 wt% in H2O) was dissolved in 0.850 g deionized water with vigorous stirring at 35 °C for 10 min. Then, 9.583 g TEOS (Sinopharm) was added, and finally, the mixture was stirred for 14 h to obtain a gel with a molar composition of 1SiO2:0.3TBAOH: 10H2O. The gel was sealed into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 115 °C under static conditions for 4 days. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was centrifuged, dried, and finally calcined at 550 °C in air for 12 h to remove the templating agent. The obtained self-pillared pure-silica zeolite nanosheet was denoted as SPS.
Synthesis of the CBZ Catalyst
The boron-containing bulk MFI zeolite, which possessed an equal B2O3/SiO2 molar ratio to the BZS-3 catalyst, was prepared using TPAOH as the SDA. (34) First, 7.484 g TPAOH (Guangfu, 25 wt% in H2O) was dissolved in 10.533 g deionized water with vigorous stirring at 50 °C for 30 min. Then, 0.341 g boric acid (Sinopharm) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. Finally, 4.792 g TEOS (Sinopharm) was added, and then the mixture was stirred for 14 h to obtain a gel with a molar composition of 1SiO2: 0.12B2O3: 0.3TPAOH: 10H2O. The gel was sealed into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C under static conditions for 3 days. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was centrifuged, dried, and finally calcined at 550 °C in air for 6 h to remove the templating agent. The obtained bulk boron-containing zeolite was denoted as CBZ.
Material Characterization
The actual boron content of the zeolites before and after the induction period was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on an Optima2000DV. Before measurements, the sample (10 mg) was dissolved in hydrochloric acid (1 mL) and hydrofluoric acid (1 mL) mixed solution in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 150 °C for 1.5 h. After evaporating up the solution that contained hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid, we repeatedly added deionized water into the Teflon container and then collected the solution into a polypropene volumetric flask, and finally fixed the solution volume as 25 mL. XRD patterns were recorded with a Panalytical X’pert Pro Super X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA, λ = 0.15418 nm) with a scanning angle (2θ) of 5–50°. N2 sorption isotherms of all catalysts were measured at 77 K with an ASAP 2020 sorption analyzer (Micromeritics). Prior to the measurement, the sample was degassed by evacuation at 200 °C for 4 h. The SEM investigation was carried out with a Hitachi FESEM SU8220 instrument. TEM images were recorded on a JEM-F200, operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a liquid N2-cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. In situ DRIFT spectra were collected on a Bruker 70 V spectrometer equipped with an in situ reaction cell (HARRICK) and an MCT detector. To observe the real-time evolution of the infrared spectral signals more accurately, we selected a relatively lower temperature (450 °C) for the in situ DRIFT measurement to extend the evolution time of the induction period (Figure S12). The catalyst powder (∼30 mg) was placed in the cell and pretreated at 500 °C for 5 h in an N2 atmosphere to remove water and other physically adsorbed impurities on the catalyst surface. Subsequently, the sample was treated in flowing C3H8/N2, O2/N2, and C3H8/O2/N2 atmosphere at 450 °C, respectively. The infrared spectra of feed gas flowing through the catalyst becoming stable after 3 min were recorded as the baselines of the in situ DRIFT measurement. The evolution was monitored by IR with averaging 256 scans at a resolution of 4 cm–1. The gas composition at the reactor outlet was controlled by online MS (Pfeiffer, OminStarTM). The m/z of 41 and 18 was used to analyze C3H6 and H2O. The contribution of C3H8 for the m/z signal of 41 was deducted.
All the NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance-III 500 MHz spectrometer with an 11.74 T wide-bore magnet with Larmor frequencies of 160.6 and 500.6 MHz for 11B and 1H, respectively. A 1.9 mm MAS NMR probe was used with a spinning rate of 38 kHz. 2D 11B MQMAS NMR spectra with a zero-quantum filter were acquired by averaging 120 transients with a recovery delay of 0.5 s. For the 2D 11B{1H} heteronuclear correlation NMR spectra, 128 scans were collected with a recycle delay of 1 s, using SR412 recoupling and presaturation pulses repeated 10 times. The chemical shifts for 1H and 11B were referenced to adamantane and H3BO3, respectively. Prior to all NMR experiments, the catalysts were fully dehydrated at 450 °C for 24 h and further transferred into ZrO2 MAS rotors in the N2 glovebox. The amount of each species could be obtained for each sample with a given boron content derived from ICP-OES.
Catalytic Reaction
ODHP was studied in a fixed bed reactor (I. D. = 8 mm, length = 42 cm) and measured at 390–530 °C under atmospheric pressure. The feed gas contains C3H8/O2/N2 with a volume ratio of 1:1.5:3.5 at a fixed total flow rate of 48 mL/min. Reactants and products were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (Techcomp, GC 7900) equipped with a GDX-102 and a molecular sieve 5A column. A TCD was used to detect O2, N2, C3H8, C3H6, C2H6, C2H4, CH4, CO, and CO2. Detailed conversion and selectivity, specific activity of propane, and propene formation rate are shown in the Supporting Information.
