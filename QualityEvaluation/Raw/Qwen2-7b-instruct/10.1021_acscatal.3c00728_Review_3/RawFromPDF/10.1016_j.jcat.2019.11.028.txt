Abstract
Supported liquid-phase catalysts (SLPCs) combine the advantages of homogenous liquid-phase catalysts and heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., controllability of active centers and efficient product–catalyst separation). Generally, SLPCs manifest as a liquid-phase catalyst film or droplet adsorbed onto the surface of a porous support, such as ionic liquid-phase catalysts. Here, we extend this idea and develop a solvent-free liquid-phase catalyst supported on hollow spheres. We report sandwich-like B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres synthesized through a one-step template-free method. At reaction temperatures (>450 °C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with an excellent productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat−1 h−1 and a high stability at 550 °C. We also found a phenomenon of tertiary aggregation during the formation of this sandwich-like hollow sphere. Additionally, the kinetic experiments indicate oxygen activation on the B2O3@BPO4 surface and second-order rate dependence with respect to the partial pressure of propane. This work may open a new avenue for the design and construction of metal-free oxides used as high-temperature SLPCs.

1. Introduction
Superior catalytic technology is a goal of general concern, involving ease of processing, high selectivity, productivity, and good robustness. The rapid growth of homogeneous catalysis is mainly due to its selectivity, activity performance, and relatively mild reaction conditions. However, homogeneous catalysts suffer from an obvious problem of separation between catalyst and products. In contrast, although efficient product–catalyst separation is one of the distinctive features of heterogeneous catalysis, active sites such as defects and irregularities of the solid surface remain difficult to control and design for heterogeneous catalysts. Thus, a strategy to “heterogenize” homogeneous catalysts onto solid supports has been attempted to achieve the salient features of both types of catalysis.
Supported liquid-phase catalysts (SLPCs) have been developed over decades to integrate the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis
[1]
,
[2]
. SLPCs feature a liquid-phase catalyst film or droplet adsorbed onto the surface of a porous support, such as an ionic liquid-phase catalysts\. Since the late 1930s, research on SLPC has been formally reported
[1]
. The first example of a metal complex solution in a high-boiling-point organic solvent or aqueous medium as a supported catalyst phase was given in the 1960s
[3]
. In 2002, the concept of supported ionic liquid phase catalysis was proposed, and many examples have been achieved
[4]
,
[5]
,
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
. Schneider and co-workers demonstrated an RhH(CO)2(L)2 ionic liquid film on the surface of porous silica for hydroaminomethylation with very high selectivity by efficient product/catalyst separation
[8]
. The immobilization of ionic liquid and ionic liquid metal triflate catalysts onto a mesoporous MCM-41 surface exhibited efficient activity for the acylation of amines with very high atom economy
[9]
. In spite of the advantages of liquid-phase catalysts, supported ionic liquid-phase catalysts are typically used below 200 °C due to the limited thermal stability of either the dissolved transition metal complex or the liquid organic salt solvent. Very recently, a new type of supported liquid metal catalyst, a gallium-rich Pd–Ga phase, was reported to achieve stable activity in butane dehydrogenation at 445 °C
[10]
. Therefore, high-temperature-stable catalysts are still highly desirable to extend the application of SPLC.
The exploitation of nonmetal catalysts has been emerging as an important research trend because of their low cost and ecofriendly properties as compared with metal-based catalysts. B2O3 is a typical inorganic oxide with a melting point of 450 °C, and the viscosity of its melting phase changes with temperature. B2O3 is also an important catalyst component in hydrocarbon conversions
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
. However, the melting of B2O3 at high temperature is considered a vital problem for B2O3-containing catalysts
[15]
. Interestingly, from another angle, low volatility and high melting point make B2O3 possible for use as a high-temperature SPLC once a suitable support is available.
For traditional supported catalysts, to gain more active sites, hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports
[16]
,
[17]
,
[18]
. Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures
[19]
,
[20]
, but sandwich-like structures are rarely used in hollow-sphere structures due to the difficulty of capsulation at micro-/nanoscale. Moreover, the preparation process is tedious, including the removal of hard or soft templates and the addition of active sites
[21]
,
[22]
. Therefore, it is expected to synthesize hollow sphere structures using a simple approach and make the best use of both sides of hollow spheres.
Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing. The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature. In the process of formation, we found not only two conventional particle aggregations (primary and secondary aggregation) and Ostwald ripening, but also an extra aggregation (denoted as tertiary aggregation). Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 °C).
Propene, one of the important chemical intermediates, has been widely used as a raw material for polypropylene, acrylonitrile, isopropanol, acetone, epoxypropane, etc.
[23]
. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene is regarded as a promising approach to producing propene relative to steam cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation, being coking-free and having no equilibrium limit
[24]
,
[25]
,
[26]
,
[27]
. In this work, a metal-free B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat−1 h−1 and high stability at 550 °C, better than many metal-based catalysts
[28]

[31]
. Furthermore, the reaction follows Eley–Rideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to PC3H8.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of B2O3@BPO4-x sandwich-like hollow spheres
Boron oxide (B2O3) and diammonium hydrogen phosphate ((NH4)2HPO4) were mixed at a 2:1 M ratio and ground in an agate mortar. Then the mixture was put into an Al2O3 boat and heated for 2 h at 800 °C in the ambient atmosphere in a tube furnace. A white particle was obtained through slightly finer grinding and labeled as B2O3@BPO4-800. By changing annealing temperatures, a series of samples prepared at 600, 1000, and 1200°CC were named B2O3@BPO4-x (x = 600, 1000, and 1200, respectively). The annealing time for B2O3@BPO4-800 was also changed to investigate the formation mechanism. The B2O3 mass content of the B2O3@BPO4-800 sample was measured to be 38.1 wt% by comparing the sample weight before and after washing. For comparison, a B2O3/SiO2 sample was prepared by physical mixture of B2O3 and SiO2 with different mass ratios. B2O3 and BPO4 hollow spheres (washed B2O3@BPO4-800) were physically mixed with different mass ratios of B2O3 to total mass and marked as α wt.% B2O3/BPO4-800 (α = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50). FePO4 was synthesized by annealing a mixture of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and (NH4)H2PO4 in a 1:2.6 mass ratio at 800 °C for 2 h. The powder catalysts CeO2, MoO3, Fe2O3, and V2O5 were purchased from Sinopharm Co. Hexagonal boron nitride (BN) came from Sigma-Aldrich Co.
2.2. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. Attenuated total internal reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was studied on a Nicolet IS 50 apparatus. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements were carried out at 77 K on a Micromeritics 3 Flex 3500 instrument. A field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi New Generation SU8100) and a field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM) (TECNAI F30) were used to study the microstructures of samples. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded using a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. Photos of the B2O3 melting process on the surface of the BPO4 tablet were captured by contact angle measurements (Dataphysics OCA20).
2.3. Catalytic activity test
The selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed reactor. The sample (150 mg) was put into a U-type quartz tube (4 mm inner diameter and 6 mm external diameter) between two quartz wools. The as-prepared B2O3@BPO4-x catalysts were sieved to collect particles of 20–40 mesh for the activity test. The catalysts B2O3/SiO2 and B2O3/γ-Al2O3 were compressed using a pellet press and sieved to obtain the particles of 20–40 mesh. The other powder catalysts, including washed B2O3@BPO4-x, were mixed with inert SiO2 (20–40 mesh) for the activity test. Then the tube was placed in a vertical furnace and heated to the target reaction temperature. Each target reaction temperature was maintained for 30 min for the precise analysis of products. A feed gas consisting of nitrogen, oxygen, and propane was controlled by a Sevenstar mass flow meter (flow rate 20 mL/min). The product was analyzed using a Pannatek A90 online gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a nickel reformer. The nickel reformer was used to transfer COx to CH4, which can be detected by FID. Two molecular sieve columns and one HP-PLOT/Q column were used to separate the C1 products (CO, CO2, and CH4) and hydrocarbon products (CH4, C2H4, C3H6, C3H8, etc.), respectively. Furthermore, the concentration of O2 was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) on an Agilent gas chromatograph equipped with a 13X molecular sieve column.
The conversion, selectivity, and carbon balance were calculated as follows,
Propane conversion:

can be obtained from the partial pressure of C3H8 and the total gas flow rate (20 mL/min) as
where

is the molar volume of ideal gas at 298 K.
2.4. Turnover frequency calculation
Turnover frequency (TOF) in terms of exposed surface B atoms of B2O3@BPO4-x was estimated according to the partial molar volume of melted B2O3 (39.69 cm3 mol−1) from Knoche’s report
[32]
and the support’s BET results. For simplification, we choose exposed B atoms as countable active sites in light of the case of metal oxide catalysts and assume that each B2O3 molecule occupies a cubic space and exposes one B atom at the surface. The exposed area per B2O3 molecule (i.e., area per B atom) was calculated to be 0.1632 nm2 from (39.69 cm3/6.02
1023)2/3. Therefore, the total number of exposed B atoms can be written as
Accordingly, (1) for the B2O3@BPO4-x and 40 wt% B2O3/SiO2 samples, the TOF can be obtained using the equation
(2) For 40 wt% B2O3/γ-Al2O3, according to the exposed area of per B2O3 molecule, 90 mg Al2O3 with 113.6 m2/g BET surface area can disperse 1.73
10−4 mol B2O3, molecules, which is more than the loaded 60 mg B2O3 (1.42
10−4 mol). Therefore, all B2O3 molecules were assumed to be exposed. The TOF for 40 wt% B2O3/γ-Al2O3 can be gained using the equation
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Schematic illustration of sample preparation
Fig. 1
schematically describes the synthesis procedure of the B2O3@BPO4 sample. In the initial stage, BPO4 particles are produced in molten B2O3 at 800 °C, exceeding the melting point of B2O3 (450 °C). In the attachment process, the individual BPO4 particles directly merge with their neighboring crystallites to form agglomerations. Then some agglomerated particles are induced to generate BPO4 solid spheres through self-assembly. Once the solid spheres form, an Ostwald ripening process occurs (i.e., the smaller crystallites in the central parts are dissolved and redeposited on the larger crystallites at outer parts), resulting in the formation of BPO4 hollow sphere structures
[33]
. During the cooling process, liquid B2O3 cools down and solidifies into nanowires covering both the inside and outside of the BPO4 hollow sphere, forming sandwich-type B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres.

3.2. Composition and structural characterizations of catalysts
The B2O3@BPO4 samples were synthesized by a one-step template-free method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (
Fig. 2
), attenuated total internal reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) (
Fig. S1
in the
Supplementary Material
), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (
Figs. S2–S3
and Table S1). In
Fig. 2
, the standard PDF cards JCPDS 06-0297 and 34-0132 correspond to B2O3 and BPO4, respectively. The main peaks at 24.5°, 40.0°, 48.8°, and 63.7° are attributed to BPO4 (JCPDS 34-0132). The peaks at 14.6° and 27.8° are ascribed to B2O3 (JCPDS 06-0297). ATR-FTIR patterns exhibit absorption bands at 3193, 1438, 1189, and 715 cm−1, which can be assigned to B2O3
[34]
. The other peaks at 1059, 909, 607, and 544 cm−1 originate from BPO4
[35]
. In the O1s core-level spectrum, two peaks located at 532.7 and 534.1 eV are attributed to BOB and POB bonds from B2O3 and BPO4, respectively
[36]
. In addition, the small peak at 193.4 eV belongs to P2s
[37]
, and the peak at 192.3 eV is ascribed to B1s
[38]
. The peak of the P2p core-level can be decomposed into P2p1/2 (135.0 eV) and P2p3/2 (134.0 eV)
[39]
. The XRD, ATR-FTIR, and XPS results reveal that the as-prepared samples are composed of B2O3 and BPO4, and no impurities were found.

In
Fig. 3
a–b, there are spheres with a shell thickness of ca. 0.35 μm and an average diameter of around 2 μm. Nanowires are observed to cover on both sides of the hollow spheres in the B2O3@BPO4-800 sample (
Figs. 3
b and S4). The nanowires are identified as the B2O3 component according to the elemental mapping (
Fig. S5
). After the B2O3 nanowires are removed from the B2O3@BPO4-800 sample by washing, the SEM images (
Fig. 3
c–d) and ATR-FTIR spectra (
Fig. S6
) of the washed B2O3@BPO4-800 sample demonstrate that the hollow sphere structure consists of BPO4.

3.3. Formation process
The formation of B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres is shown in
Fig. 5
. In general, the formation of BPO4 nanoparticles of ca. 100 nm is defined as primary aggregation (insert picture in
Fig. 5
a). At the initial stage of annealing (ca. 10 min), agglomeration of primary BPO4 nanoparticles proceeds (
Fig. 5
a), which is usually called secondary aggregation. Then some aggregated BPO4 particles form concentric ringlike structures that serve as starting points to attract the surrounding particles in the subsequent crystallization process (
Fig. 5
b). More interestingly, as the annealing proceeds further, centered spheres and their support concaves are observed on the surface of secondary aggregated particles as a result of the centripetal attraction of particles (self-assembly effect) (
Fig. 5
c). This formation of sphere structure based on bulk secondary aggregated particles is novel, and thus we call it tertiary aggregation. Subsequently, a hollowing process resulting from Ostwald ripening occurs, where the smaller crystallites in the central parts tend to be dissolved and redeposited on the outer parts (
Fig. 5
d–5e)
[33]
. While the interior core in the center is consumed completely by the solid evacuation, the sphere shows an absolute hollow sphere structure (
Fig. 5
f). Meanwhile, the crystal size of BPO4 is coarsening with prolonged annealing time.

To investigate the effect of annealing temperature on the morphology of the B2O3@BPO4-x samples, various samples were prepared at different temperatures (600, 800, 1000, and 1200 °C). The sphere structure is only formed at 800 °C (B2O3@BPO4-800) (
Fig. S8
). At lower temperature (600 °C), it fails to form due to the poor mobility of liquid B2O3
[40]
. At higher temperatures (1000 and 1200 °C), the relatively bigger BPO4 particles block their own further aggregation.
3.4. Catalytic performance
The catalytic performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over the samples at 550 °C is shown in
Table 1
. B2O3@BPO4-800 shows the highest conversion of 24.7% with the main product—alkenes, including propene (66.4% Sel.) and ethylene (18.4% Sel.)—in B2O3@BPO4-x samples. The selectivity for ethylene is higher than that of metal-based catalysts
[41]
, which could be caused by the oxidative coupling reaction of methyl over B2O3 active species
[25]
,
[41]
,
[42]
. The other products consist of CH4 (>50%) and trace acrolein, allyl alcohol, and acetone. Moreover, the productivity of propene was calculated (
Table 1
). The productivity of propene for B2O3@BPO4-800 measured 0.79 gC3H6 gcat−1 h−1, which is similar to 0.82 gC3H6 gcat−1 h−1 for 40 wt% B2O3/γ-Al2O3, but 40 wt% B2O3/γ-Al2O3 consumes more C3H8 and O2, revealing the advantage of B2O3@BPO4-800. In contrast, the washed B2O3@BPO4-800 and washed B2O3@BPO4-1000 (i.e., BPO4) exhibit conversion of 5.6% and 5.2%, respectively. The relatively lower activities demonstrate that B2O3 could be the main active species for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
[43]
,
[44]
. Therefore, BPO4 acts not only as a support, but also as a cocatalyst in the reaction. It is worth noting that the reaction temperature 550 °C is suitable not only for oxidative dehydrogenation but also for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane. To confirm the contribution of the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane pathway, the catalytic activity of B2O3@BPO4-800 using propane with N2 only at 550 °C vs. time on stream was estimated to be ca. 1.7% conversion of propane with ca. 57.0% selectivity for propene (
Fig. S9
). This result demonstrates a slight contribution of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane in our system.

Note: Reaction conditions: 150 mg catalyst, 30% C3H8, 15% O2, N2 balance, 550 °C, 20 mL/min.
In addition, to study the effect of B2O3 amount in the B2O3@BPO4-800, B2O3 and BPO4 hollow spheres (washed B2O3@BPO4-800) were physically mixed at different mass ratios (B2O3/BPO4-800). When the content of B2O3 in the composite is more than 30%, the catalytic performance barely changes (
Fig. S10
). Therefore, we believe that the surfaces of BPO4 hollow spheres are completely covered with melted B2O3 when its content exceeds 30%. In our case, the turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated by regarding exposed B atoms in B2O3@BPO4-x as the number of active sites, which can be estimated by combining the BET surface area of BPO4 hollow spheres and the partial molar volume of melted B2O3. As shown in
Table 1
, for B2O3@BPO4-x samples, the TOFs increase from 0.18 to 0.77 s−1 with annealing temperature, which are higher than for B2O3/SiO2 and B2O3/γ-Al2O3. The growing trend of TOFs over B2O3@BPO4-x is due to more rapid decline in the BET surface area than in the activity for B2O3@BPO4-1000 and B2O3@BPO4-1200 (
Tables 1
and
2
). The conversion of 30.5% over 40 wt% B2O3/γ-Al2O3 is higher than that over B2O3@BPO4-800 (24.7%), which could be due to the more active sites on the larger surface area of γ-Al2O3 (
Table 2
). The washed B2O3@BPO4-800 has the highest BET surface area among the washed samples (
Table 2
), demonstrating the advantage of hollow spheres as supports in the reaction, which is consistent with the previous reports

The selectivity to propene against propane conversion over different catalysts was plotted in
Fig. 6
. Obviously, B2O3@BPO4-800 has a higher propene selectivity at the same conversion level than other catalysts, including B2O3/SiO2, B2O3/γ-Al2O3, BN, FePO4, CeO2, MoO3, Fe2O3, and V2O5, which further confirms the role of the BPO4 hollow-sphere structure in the reaction.

Thermal stability is of great importance for SLPCs.
Fig. S11
reveals the liquid state of B2O3 at reaction temperature. B2O3@BPO4-800 exhibits excellent mass and chemical stability at high temperatures (
Table 2
,
Figs. S3 and S12
) and stable catalytic activity for at least 27 h at 550 °C. The stable carbon balance within 100 ± 5% reveals the excellent anti-coke performance of B2O3@BPO4-x catalysts. There is no obvious change in the sandwich-like structure of B2O3@BPO4-800 after a long reaction time (
Figs. 7
a and S13). The kinetics was investigated by changing the reaction temperature and reactant concentration (partial pressure of O2 and C3H8—PO2 and PC3H8, respectively;

b–d). The apparent activation energy (Ea) for B2O3@BPO4-800 was measured to be 198.5 kJ/mol (
Fig. 7
b). This value is higher than that of CNT (117 kJ/mol)
[48]
and of VOx/ZrO2, MoOx/ZrO2, WOx/ZrO2 (48–61 kJ/mol)
[49]
, but it is still lower than that of BN catalyst (ca. 253 kJ/mol)
[25]
. The consumption rate of propane (PO2 constant at 0.15 atm) follows second-order dependence with respect to PC3H8 (
Fig. 7
c). Meanwhile, the reaction follows Eley–Rideal kinetics (
Fig. 7
d), illustrating the occurrence of oxygen adsorption and activation on the surface of B2O3@BPO4-800. Furthermore, the consumption rate equation of C3H8 was obtained and is shown in

d. The rate equation derivation is as follows. There is a good linear correlation between the consumption rate of C3H8 and the square of the C3H8 partial pressure (
Fig. S15
). Therefore, the reaction order with regard to the C3H8 partial pressure follows second-order kinetics and the consumption rate of C3H8 with respect to the C3H8 partial pressure can be described as
where
is the consumption rate for C3H8,
represents the rate constant, and
is the square of the C3H8 partial pressure.

Rates of propane consumption as a function of (c) PC3H8 (PO2 constant at 0.15 atm) and (d) PO2 (PC3H8 constant at 0.3 atm) fit with second-order dependence with respect to PC3H8 and Eley–Rideal kinetics showing O2 adsorption, respectively.
Moreover, the plot of

shows good linear dependence at the given partial pressure of C3H8 (
Fig. S16
). This means that
can be expressed as
where
represents the rate constant and
is the partial pressure of O2. This equation reveals that the equilibrated adsorption of O2 on the catalyst’s surface would participate in the elementary step of over-all reaction paths.
Based on the above discussion, the overall rate equation of C3H8 can be expressed as
where
is the overall rate constant including all elementary steps.
The kinetic behavior of B2O3@BPO4-800 distinctly differs from typical supported vanadia catalysts, which obey a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. The Mars–van Krevelen mechanism describes rate-determining substrate reduction followed by fast reoxidation of the surface by oxygen, which commonly leads to first-order rate dependence with respect to PC3H8 and zero-order rate dependence with respect to PO2
[50]
. This result is consistent with previous reports in which propane did not react with lattice oxygen by pulsing C3H8 over boria–alumina catalysts
[11]
. Interestingly, the kinetic behavior of B2O3@BPO4-800 is the same as that of BN catalyst
[25]
, confirming that B2O3 is the real active species in this BN catalyzed reaction

3.5. Proposed reaction schematic for B2O3@BPO4
A reaction mechanism for catalytically oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over B2O3@BPO4 is proposed and shown in
Fig. 8
. As the temperature goes up, B2O3 nanowires melt into the liquid phase and gather in the cracks on the surface of BPO4 due to nonwetting of melted B2O3 with respect to BPO4 surface (
Fig. S11
). In the reaction, oxygen molecules are absorbed and activated on the melted B2O3 surface to form activated intermediate (O*) according to Eley–Rideal kinetics. Because of the weaker CH bond energy in the sec-C atom of propane
[52]
, the β–H atom is extracted by O* to produce hydroxyl and isopropyl
[28]
,
[53]
. Then the second abstraction of a hydrogen atom from isopropyl by adjacent O* follows the formation of propene. The desorption of water is caused by oxygen addition and then the O* intermediate regenerates

4. Conclusions
In summary, we extend the concept of SLPCs and develop an inorganic oxide (B2O3) used as a high-temperature SLPC. B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were constructed via a one-step template-free method. During the formation of the B2O3@BPO4 composite, we found not only two conventional particle aggregations (primary and secondary aggregation) but also a tertiary aggregation process of particles. At high temperatures (>450 °C), melted B2O3 supported on the surfaces of BPO4 hollow spheres exhibits excellent activity (0.79 gC3H6 gcat−1 h−1 productivity), better than that of many metal-based catalysts, and superior stability for at least 27 h at 550 °C. The reaction follows Eley–Rideal kinetics and shows second-order rate dependence with respect to PC3H8. Moreover, melted B2O3 results in uniform catalytic sites on the surface that provide homogenous steric and electronic properties clearly different from those of common supported solid catalysts. This work develops a new supported liquid metal-free catalyst for a high-temperature reaction and achieves interface control in the field of heterogeneous catalysis.
