The nature of active chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane: New insights by a comprehensive spectroscopic study Abstract Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) was studied over a series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, to gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function. To this end, the catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopyenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEMEDXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS).

At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral ( ) coordination, whilst on γ-Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species. At 5 wt% Cr, SBA-15 is dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, besides a fraction of isolated Cr(VI) species in coordination. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles.

At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 exclusively contains isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination, whereas γ-Al2O3 contains a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) along with isolated species. At 5 wt% Cr, SBA-15 is mainly composed of crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, alongside a fraction of isolated Cr(VI) species in coordination. Surprisingly, γ-Al2O3 predominantly consists of oligomers with varying degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species, without any Cr2O3 particles.
