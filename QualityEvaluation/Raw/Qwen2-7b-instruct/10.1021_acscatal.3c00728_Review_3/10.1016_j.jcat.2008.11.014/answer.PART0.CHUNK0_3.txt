[1] "At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral ( ) coordination, whilst on γ-Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species."
[2] "Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles."
[3] "For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3."
[4] "In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves examining the arrangement and distribution of active components within the material's framework. These features enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for reactions to occur, promoting easier access to the active sites, and potentially improving the diffusion of reactants and products. The 3-D dispersion ensures a more uniform distribution of active sites throughout the material, which can lead to improved efficiency and selectivity in catalytic processes.

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures vary widely and can include impregnation, co-precipitation, ion exchange, and direct synthesis. The effectiveness of these methods depends on factors such as the compatibility between the B component and the matrix material, the desired concentration and distribution of B within the structure, and the specific requirements of the catalytic application. For instance, impregnation allows for precise control over the B loading but may result in uneven distribution, while direct synthesis can yield more homogeneous incorporation but may require higher temperatures or pressures.

The porous frameworks act as a scaffold for the B active components, guiding the formation of a well-defined network of active sites. The 3-D dispersion ensures that these sites are accessible from all directions, facilitating the diffusion of reactants and products and minimizing the risk of localized deactivation. This architecture is particularly beneficial for applications requiring high throughput, such as the conversion of large volumes of feedstock, and for reactions where selectivity is crucial, such as the selective hydrogenation or dehydrogenation of specific molecules.

In conclusion, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance through optimized surface area, efficient access to active sites, and improved diffusion properties. The choice of method for incorporating B active components into these structures should be guided by the specific requirements of the catalytic application, including the desired concentration, distribution, and compatibility with the matrix material.

分析基于B的材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构的特征，涉及到对材料内部活性成分排列和分布的考察。这些特征通过提供更大的反应表面、促进活性位点的易访问性和可能改善反应物和产物的扩散来增强催化性能。三维分散确保活性位点在整个材料中均匀分布，这可以提高催化过程的效率和选择性。

用于将B活性组分引入这些结构中的方法多种多样，包括浸渍、共沉淀、离子交换和直接合成。这些方法的有效性取决于B组分与基体材料之间的兼容性、希望在结构中达到的B负载量以及特定催化应用的要求。例如，浸渍允许精确控制B负载，但可能会导致不均匀分布，而直接合成可以实现更均一的集成，但可能需要更高的温度或压力。

多孔框架作为活性组分的支架，指导形成一个定义明确的活性位点网络。三维分散确保这些位点可以从所有方向访问，有利于反应物和产物的扩散，并降低局部失活的风险。这种架构特别适用于需要高通量的应用，如大量原料的转换，以及需要高选择性的反应，如特定分子的选择性氢化或脱氢。

综上所述，基于B的材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构显著提高了催化性能，通过优化表面面积、有效访问活性位点和改善扩散特性。根据催化应用的具体要求（包括期望的浓度、分布和基体材料的兼容性）选择将B活性组分集成到这些结构中的方法。
