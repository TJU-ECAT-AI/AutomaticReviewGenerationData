[3] "The involvement of Lewis acid sites in the generation of propyl radicals is assumed; olefins and C1C3 oxygenates are formed with high selectivities even in excess of oxygen most probably via secondary reactions of propyl radicals and oxygen in the gas phase."

The document discusses the preparation of boria-containing catalysts, specifically mentioning the B2O3 (30 wt%)/Al2O3 catalyst. This catalyst was created through impregnation of γ-Al2O3 with boric acid dissolved in warm water. The mechanism of propane activation on this type of catalyst involves Lewis acid sites, which generate propyl radicals that desorb into the gas phase. These radicals participate in secondary reactions with oxygen, leading to the formation of olefins and oxygenates with high selectivity. The addition of boria to alumina affects the surface hydrogen, causing the elimination of mobile hydrogen during a hydrogen-deuterium (HD) exchange reaction in C3D8.

本文讨论了硼氧化物基催化剂的制备，特别提到了B2O3（30 wt%）/Al2O3催化剂。该催化剂通过将硼酸溶解在温水中浸渍γ-Al2O3制备而成。这种催化剂上丙烷激活的机制涉及路易斯酸位点，这些位点生成丙基自由基并将其释放到气相中。这些自由基参与与氧气的次级反应，导致形成烯烃和氧代化合物，即使在过量氧气的情况下也能以高选择性形成。向铝水合物中添加硼导致氢去活，在C3D8的氢-氘交换反应中消除了移动氢。
