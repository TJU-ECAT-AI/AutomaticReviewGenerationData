[1] "Boriaalumina catalysts show high propene and oxygenates selectivities even at degrees of propane conversions higher than 20%."
[2] "Formation of borates cannot be considered as an active phase."
[3] "Although this type of catalysts is promising for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, their use in the case of propane is limited due to significant formation of ethylene besides propene."
[4] "As a result, olefins and oxygenates are formed with significant selectivities."
[5] "Results of the HD exchange reaction in C3D8 with surface hydrogen showed that addition of boria to alumina resulted in the elimination of mobile hydrogen. Thus, a decrease in Brnsted acidity was assumed for B2O3/Al2O3 compared to Al2O3."
[6] "The values do not differ much from those reported in [23]."
[7] "As estimated from NH3-TPD measurements, the total number of acid sites, however, increased with boria doping and amounted to 1.8 and 8.3 μmol NH3/m2 for Al2O3 and B2O3 (30 wt%)/Al2O3, respectively."
[8] "The effect of oxygen partial pressure on the space time yields of ethylene and CO2 was less pronounced (cf.Fig. 6)."

The document discusses various types of catalysts for the oxidative conversion of propane. B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for the reaction, which facilitates the adsorption and activation of propane molecules. These materials typically contain boron (B) as the active component, which exhibits both Lewis and Brnsted acidity. The Lewis acidity is crucial for the activation of propane, while the Brnsted acidity helps in the formation of oxygenates and olefins. Incorporating B into these structures can be done through various methods, such as co-precipitation, impregnation, or sol-gel processes. The effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific application and the desired properties of the catalyst. The document highlights that B-based catalysts have high propene and oxygenates selectivities, even at high propane conversions. However, the presence of borates in the material does not contribute significantly to its catalytic activity. While B-based catalysts are promising for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, their use in propane conversion is limited due to the formation of ethylene alongside propene. The selectivities for olefins and oxygenates are influenced by the type of catalyst and the reaction conditions, such as the oxygen partial pressure. The results from the hydrogen exchange reaction indicate that the addition of boron to alumina reduces the Brnsted acidity, suggesting that the B2O3 component might dominate the catalytic activity through Lewis acidity rather than Brnsted acidity.

文档讨论了用于丙烷氧化转换的各种催化剂。三维分散在多孔框架中的基于B的材料通过提供大量的表面积来增强催化性能，这有利于丙烷分子的吸附和激活。这些材料通常包含硼（B）作为活性成分，其表现出Lewis酸性和Brnsted酸性。Lewis酸性对于丙烷的活化至关重要，而Brnsted酸性有助于形成氧代物和烯烃。将B引入这些结构可以通过各种方法完成，例如共沉淀、浸渍或溶胶-凝胶过程。这些方法的有效性取决于具体应用和催化剂所需属性。文档指出，基于B的催化剂具有高丙烯和氧代物选择性，即使在高丙烷转化率下也是如此。然而，材料中存在的硼酸盐对催化剂活性的贡献并不显著。虽然基于B的催化剂有潜力用于乙烷的氧化脱氢，但它们在丙烷转换中的使用受到除丙烯之外形成乙烯的限制。烯烃和氧代物的选择性受催化剂类型和反应条件的影响，如氧气分压。氢交换反应的结果表明，向氧化铝中添加硼减少了Brnsted酸性，这表明B2O3组分可能主要通过Lewis酸性而不是Brnsted酸性主导催化活性。
