Catalysts studied in the present work (V2O5/TiO2, rare-earth oxide-based systems, B2O3/Al2O3) were chosen taking into account the above classification. The aim of the work was to compare the catalytic performance of these systems, which is expected to activate propane in different ways. In each case an attempt has been made to identify the factors determining activity and product distribution.

Oxidation of alkanes via radical chain reactions was assumed for the air oxidation of butane to acetic acid and cyclohexane to adipic acid [21] in the presence of Co compounds. The initiation involves the formation of an alkyl radical which reacts with oxygen forming a peroxy radical. The reaction between the peroxy radical and alkane (CnH2n+1O2+CnH2n+2CnH2n+1O2H+CnH2n+1) is proposed to be the main propagation step. The decomposition of hydroperoxide results in the formation of olefins and oxygenates. A similar mechanism was proposed by Otsuka et al. [22] for the oxidation of propane on BP mixed oxides. No correlation of catalytic performance with solid properties was, however, made.

The mechanism of the oxidative conversion of propane which takes place on boria-containing catalysts differs from those on V- or REO-based catalysts. In this case acidity seems to play a decisive role in the propane activation. A question about the type of acidity arises. No conventional method of IR spectroscopy of adsorbed NH3 or pyridine can be used for B2O3-containing catalyst to distinguish between Lewis and Brnsted acidity because of strong absorption of boria in the range from 1100 to 1700 cm1 masking any adsorbate peaks. Results of the HD exchange reaction in C3D8 with surface hydrogen showed that addition of boria to alumina resulted in the elimination of mobile hydrogen. Thus, a decrease in Brnsted acidity was assumed for B2O3/Al2O3 compared to Al2O3 [20] . As estimated from NH3-TPD measurements, the total number of acid sites, however, increased with boria doping and amounted to 1.8 and 8.3 μmol NH3/m2 for Al2O3 and B2O3 (30 wt%)/Al2O3, respectively. The values do not differ much from those reported in [23] . Thus, the boria/alumina catalyst possesses most likely a Lewis acidity which determines the activation of propane.

For oxidation of butane to acetic [21] , the initiation via the reaction was proposed. If the same initiation takes place in the oxidative conversion of propane on BAlO systems, the catalyst should be able to produce the propyl radicals due to its Lewis acidity via the reaction where Ln+ is the Lewis site.

There is, however, another possibility of propane activation involving homolytic CH-bond splitting with the formation of propyl and hydrogen radicals which both release in the gas phase due to suppressed surface oxidation.

The effect of oxygen partial pressure on product formation over a B2O3 (30 wt%)/Al2O3 catalyst is illustrated in Fig. 6. An increase of oxygen partial pressure resulted in a significant increase of propene and CO space time yields. No predominant formation of CO is, however, observed with increasing oxygen concentration. The effect of oxygen partial pressure on the space time yields of ethylene and CO2 was less pronounced (cf. Fig. 6).

Propene yields amounted to 1420% at 550C. COx selectivities did not exceed 20% even when using a reaction mixture with an excess of oxygen (C3H8/O2=0.8). Ethylene, methane, methanol, formaldehyde, methylformate, formic acid, ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, propionaldehyde, acetone, propanol, propylene glycol, acrolein were also formed depending on reaction conditions. When using a reaction mixture with p(C3H8)=40 kPa and p(O2)=20 kPa propane conversion was 28.4% after 10 h on stream at T=823 K and τ=2 g s/ml; selectivities to olefins and oxygenates amounted to 67.4 and 18.1%, respectively (YC3H6=14.9%; YC2H4=4.2%; Yacr.=2.3%; YCH3OH=0.5%; YCH3CHO=0.3%; YC2H5OH=0.3%; YHCOOH=1.3%; YCH3COCH3=0.2%).

Boriaalumina catalysts show high propene and oxygenates selectivities even at degrees of propane conversions higher than 20%. The unique performance of this catalyst is most probably due to B2O3 being, however, melted under reaction conditions (Tmelt.=450C [25] ). Formation of borates cannot be considered as an active phase [20] . Catalyst stability is an important issue for this type of catalyst. Additional studies regarding the stabilisation of boria, which plays a key role in the propane activation and formation of the selective products are required.

Analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, explaining how these features enhance catalytic performance, and critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, discussing their relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials, particularly the presence of 3-D dispersed active sites within porous frameworks, significantly enhance catalytic performance by facilitating the efficient utilization of the active sites. The porous nature of these materials allows for better accessibility of reactants to the active sites, while the dispersion ensures a more uniform distribution of the active material throughout the catalyst. This leads to an increased surface area for reaction, promoting higher activity and selectivity.

The incorporation of B active components into these structures typically involves several methods, such as impregnation, co-precipitation, or direct deposition onto the support material. Each method has its own advantages and limitations, affecting the distribution, morphology, and reactivity of the B species. For instance, impregnation might lead to a more controlled and localized distribution of B, whereas co-precipitation could potentially result in a more homogeneous dispersion but might also introduce additional phases or impurities.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For instance, in the oxidative conversion of propane, the method chosen might impact the selectivity towards specific products, such as propene, ethylene, or oxygenates. The critical evaluation of these methods should consider factors like the stability of the B species, the ease of synthesis, and the compatibility with the support material.

In summary, the structural characteristics of B-based materials, combined with the proper method of incorporating B active components, enable the design of highly effective catalysts for various applications, including the oxidative conversion of propane. The selection of the appropriate synthesis technique is crucial to achieve optimal performance tailored to the desired catalytic outcome.

B基材料的结构特征，特别是存在于多孔框架中的三维分散活性位点，显著增强了催化性能，通过有效利用活性位点提高了性能。这些多孔材料的特性允许更好地让反应物接近活性位点，而分散则确保活性材料在整个催化剂中均匀分布。这导致了更高的表面面积和反应效率，从而促进更高水平的活性和选择性。

将B活性成分整合到这些结构中通常涉及几种方法，如浸渍、共沉淀或直接沉积到支持材料上。每种方法都有其优点和局限性，影响B物种的分布、形态和反应性。例如，浸渍可能导致更受控且局部分布的B，而共沉淀则可能导致更均匀的分散，但可能也会引入额外的相或杂质。

这些方法的有效性根据具体催化应用的不同而变化。例如，在丙烷氧化转化过程中，所选方法可能会影响特定产品的选择性，如丙烯、乙烯或氧化合物。对这些方法的批判性评估应考虑B物种的稳定性、合成的简便性和与支持材料的兼容性等因素。

综上所述，B基材料的结构特征结合适当的B活性成分整合方法，使设计高效催化剂成为可能，适用于各种应用，包括丙烷氧化转化。选择合适的合成技术对于实现针对所需催化结果的最佳性能至关重要。
