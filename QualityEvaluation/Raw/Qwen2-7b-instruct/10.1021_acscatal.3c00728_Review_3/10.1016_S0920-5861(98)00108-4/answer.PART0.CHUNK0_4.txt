[1] "Oxidation of alkanes via radical chain reactions was assumed for the air oxidation of butane to acetic acid and cyclohexane to adipic acid [21] in the presence of Co compounds. The initiation involves the formation of an alkyl radical which reacts with oxygen forming a peroxy radical. The reaction between the peroxy radical and alkane (CnH2n+1O2+CnH2n+2CnH2n+1O2H+CnH2n+1) is proposed to be the main propagation step. The decomposition of hydroperoxide results in the formation of olefins and oxygenates."
[2] "As reported earlier [20] , the dissociative adsorption of both oxygen and propane is suppressed on B2O3 (30 wt%)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst as confirmed by HD and oxygen isotopic exchange reactions. Also no reaction of propane with lattice oxygen was detected by pulsing C3H8 over boriaalumina catalyst in the TAP reactor in the temperature range from 783 to 853 K. Therefore, propane activation via redox mechanism or by adsorbed oxygen can be excluded on this type of catalyst."

An alkyl radical initiates the oxidation of alkanes in the presence of Co compounds, forming a peroxy radical that reacts with the alkane to create olefins and oxygenates. This process explains the air oxidation of butane to acetic acid and cyclohexane to adipic acid. 

The dissociative adsorption of both oxygen and propane is inhibited on B2O3 (30 wt%)/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, confirming that propane activation through a redox mechanism or by adsorbed oxygen does not occur on this type of catalyst.

烷烃在钴化合物的存在下，通过烷基自由基的氧化作用形成过氧自由基。过氧自由基与烷烃反应生成烯烃和氧化物，这一过程解释了丁烷转化为乙酸和环己烷转化为脂肪酸的过程。
