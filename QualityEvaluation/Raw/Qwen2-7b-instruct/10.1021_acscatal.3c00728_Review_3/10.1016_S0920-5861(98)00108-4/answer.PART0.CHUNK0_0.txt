[1] "Three types of mechanisms were considered based on the character of surface species involved in the alkane activation."
[2] "Along with a redox-mechanism which is widely accepted for transition metal containing catalysts oxygen can participate in propane activation via its adsorbed state."
[3] "The aim of the work was to compare the catalytic performance of these systems, which is expected to activate propane in different ways."
[4] "For the catalytic experiments, a fixed-bed reactor (in=6 or 12 mm) made of quartz, operated at ambient pressure and equipped with on-line gas chromatography was used."
[5] "In the present work, it was shown that mixed oxide catalysts based on REOs are also able to ignite the reaction and sustain the reactions at contact times of the order of 6080 ms."
[6] "Although high olefin yield of 17.5% was obtained at 973 K using a reactor filled with quartz due to non-catalytic oxidation, it was not possible to ignite the reaction mixture in this case."

The study analyzed the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, focusing on how these features enhance catalytic performance. It highlighted the importance of incorporating B active components into these structures for various catalytic applications. The research aimed to compare the catalytic performance of different systems, expecting each to activate propane differently. The experiments utilized a fixed-bed reactor equipped with online gas chromatography for the catalytic tests. The study also demonstrated that mixed oxide catalysts based on rare earth oxides (REOs) could ignite the reaction and sustain it at contact times around 60-80 ms. However, it was noted that achieving ignition and sustaining the reaction was challenging when using a reactor filled with quartz due to non-catalytic oxidation processes.

本研究分析了B基材料在多维分散活性位点孔框架中的结构特征，着重探讨了这些特性如何增强催化性能。它强调了将B活性成分融入这些结构中对于不同催化应用的重要性。研究旨在比较不同系统对丙烷激活的不同性能，期望每个系统都能以不同的方式激活丙烷。实验使用了一种配备在线气相色谱仪的固定床反应器，用于催化测试。研究还表明，基于稀土氧化物（REOs）的混合氧化物催化剂能够点燃反应并维持反应，在接触时间大约为60-80毫秒时。然而，值得注意的是，当使用填充有石英的反应器时，由于非催化氧化过程，实现点火和维持反应变得困难。
