Catalysts studied in the present work (V2O5/TiO2, rare-earth oxide-based systems, B2O3/Al2O3) were chosen taking into account the above classification. The aim of the work was to compare the catalytic performance of these systems, which is expected to activate propane in different ways. In each case an attempt has been made to identify the factors determining activity and product distribution.

Oxidation of alkanes via radical chain reactions was assumed for the air oxidation of butane to acetic acid and cyclohexane to adipic acid [21] in the presence of Co compounds. The initiation involves the formation of an alkyl radical which reacts with oxygen forming a peroxy radical. The reaction between the peroxy radical and alkane (CnH2n+1O2+CnH2n+2CnH2n+1O2H+CnH2n+1) is proposed to be the main propagation step. The decomposition of hydroperoxide results in the formation of olefins and oxygenates. A similar mechanism was proposed by Otsuka et al. [22] for the oxidation of propane on BP mixed oxides. No correlation of catalytic performance with solid properties was, however, made.

The mechanism of the oxidative conversion of propane which takes place on boria-containing catalysts differs from those on V- or REO-based catalysts. In this case acidity seems to play a decisive role in the propane activation. A question about the type of acidity arises. No conventional method of IR spectroscopy of adsorbed NH3 or pyridine can be used for B2O3-containing catalyst to distinguish between Lewis and Brnsted acidity because of strong absorption of boria in the range from 1100 to 1700 cm1 masking any adsorbate peaks. Results of the HD exchange reaction in C3D8 with surface hydrogen showed that addition of boria to alumina resulted in the elimination of mobile hydrogen. Thus, a decrease in Brnsted acidity was assumed for B2O3/Al2O3 compared to Al2O3 [20] . As estimated from NH3-TPD measurements, the total number of acid sites, however, increased with boria doping and amounted to 1.8 and 8.3 μmol NH3/m2 for Al2O3 and B2O3 (30 wt%)/Al2O3, respectively. The values do not differ much from those reported in [23] . Thus, the boria/alumina catalyst possesses most likely a Lewis acidity which determines the activation of propane.

For oxidation of butane to acetic [21] , the initiation via the reaction was proposed. If the same initiation takes place in the oxidative conversion of propane on BAlO systems, the catalyst should be able to produce the propyl radicals due to its Lewis acidity via the reaction where Ln+ is the Lewis site.

There is, however, another possibility of propane activation involving homolytic CH-bond splitting with the formation of propyl and hydrogen radicals which both release in the gas phase due to suppressed surface oxidation.

The effect of oxygen partial pressure on product formation over a B2O3 (30 wt%)/Al2O3 catalyst is illustrated in Fig. 6. An increase of oxygen partial pressure resulted in a significant increase of propene and CO space time yields. No predominant formation of CO is, however, observed with increasing oxygen concentration. The effect of oxygen partial pressure on the space time yields of ethylene and CO2 was less pronounced (cf. Fig. 6).

Propene yields amounted to 1420% at 550C. COx selectivities did not exceed 20% even when using a reaction mixture with an excess of oxygen (C3H8/O2=0.8). Ethylene, methane, methanol, formaldehyde, methylformate, formic acid, ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, propionaldehyde, acetone, propanol, propylene glycol, acrolein were also formed depending on reaction conditions. When using a reaction mixture with p(C3H8)=40 kPa and p(O2)=20 kPa propane conversion was 28.4% after 10 h on stream at T=823 K and τ=2 g s/ml; selectivities to olefins and oxygenates amounted to 67.4 and 18.1%, respectively (YC3H6=14.9%; YC2H4=4.2%; Yacr.=2.3%; YCH3OH=0.5%; YCH3CHO=0.3%; YC2H5OH=0.3%; YHCOOH=1.3%; YCH3COCH3=0.2%).

Boriaalumina catalysts show high propene and oxygenates selectivities even at degrees of propane conversions higher than 20%. The unique performance of this catalyst is most probably due to B2O3 being, however, melted under reaction conditions (Tmelt.=450C [25] ). Formation of borates cannot be considered as an active phase [20] . Catalyst stability is an important issue for this type of catalyst. Additional studies regarding the stabilisation of boria, which plays a key role in the propane activation and formation of the selective products are required.

Analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, explaining how these features enhance catalytic performance, and critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, discussing their relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials, particularly the presence of 3-D dispersed active sites within porous frameworks, significantly enhance catalytic performance by facilitating the efficient utilization of the active sites. The porous nature of these materials allows for better accessibility of reactants to the active sites, while the dispersion ensures a more uniform distribution of the active material throughout the catalyst. This leads to an increased surface area for reaction, promoting higher activity and selectivity.

The incorporation of B active components into these structures typically involves several methods, such as impregnation, co-precipitation, or direct deposition onto the support material. Each method has its own advantages and limitations, affecting the distribution, morphology, and reactivity of the B species. For instance, impregnation might lead to a more controlled and localized distribution of B, whereas co-precipitation could potentially result in a more homogeneous dispersion but might also introduce additional phases or impurities.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For instance, in the oxidative conversion of propane, the method chosen might impact the selectivity towards specific products, such as propene, ethylene, or oxygenates. The critical evaluation of these methods should consider factors like the stability of the B species, the ease of synthesis, and the compatibility with the support material.

In summary, the structural characteristics of B-based materials, combined with the proper method of incorporating B active components, enable the design of highly effective catalysts for various applications, including the oxidative conversion of propane. The selection of the appropriate synthesis technique is crucial to achieve optimal performance tailored to the desired catalytic outcome.

分析B基材料中三维分散活性位点在多孔结构中的特征，解释这些特征如何增强催化性能，并批判性地评估将B活性成分整合到这些结构中的方法，讨论其在不同催化应用中的相对有效性。

B基材料的结构特征，特别是存在于多孔框架中的三维分散活性位点，显著增强了催化性能，通过有效利用活性位点提高了性能。这些多孔材料的特性允许更好地让反应物接近活性位点，而分散则确保活性材料在整个催化剂中均匀分布。这导致了更高的表面面积和反应效率，从而促进更高水平的活性和选择性。

将B活性成分整合到这些结构中通常涉及几种方法，如浸渍、共沉淀或直接沉积到支持材料上。每种方法都有其优点和局限性，影响B物种的分布、形态和反应性。例如，浸渍可能导致更受控且局部分布的B，而共沉淀则可能导致更均匀的分散，但可能也会引入额外的相或杂质。

这些方法的有效性根据具体催化应用的不同而变化。例如，在丙烷氧化转化过程中，所选方法可能会影响特定产品的选择性，如丙烯、乙烯或氧化合物。对这些方法的批判性评估应考虑B物种的稳定性、合成的简便性和与支持材料的兼容性等因素。

综上所述，B基材料的结构特征结合适当的B活性成分整合方法，使设计高效催化剂成为可能，适用于各种应用，包括丙烷氧化转化。选择合适的合成技术对于实现针对所需催化结果的最佳性能至关重要。

The document discusses various types of catalysts for the oxidative conversion of propane. B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for the reaction, which facilitates the adsorption and activation of propane molecules. These materials typically contain boron (B) as the active component, which exhibits both Lewis and Brnsted acidity. The Lewis acidity is crucial for the activation of propane, while the Brnsted acidity helps in the formation of oxygenates and olefins. Incorporating B into these structures can be done through various methods, such as co-precipitation, impregnation, or sol-gel processes. The effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific application and the desired properties of the catalyst. The document highlights that B-based catalysts have high propene and oxygenates selectivities, even at high propane conversions. However, the presence of borates in the material does not contribute significantly to its catalytic activity. While B-based catalysts are promising for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, their use in propane conversion is limited due to the formation of ethylene alongside propene. The selectivities for olefins and oxygenates are influenced by the type of catalyst and the reaction conditions, such as the oxygen partial pressure. The results from the hydrogen exchange reaction indicate that the addition of boron to alumina reduces the Brnsted acidity, suggesting that the B2O3 component might dominate the catalytic activity through Lewis acidity rather than Brnsted acidity.

文档讨论了用于丙烷氧化转换的各种催化剂。三维分散在多孔框架中的基于B的材料通过提供大量的表面积来增强催化性能，这有利于丙烷分子的吸附和激活。这些材料通常包含硼（B）作为活性成分，其表现出Lewis酸性和Brnsted酸性。Lewis酸性对于丙烷的活化至关重要，而Brnsted酸性有助于形成氧代物和烯烃。将B引入这些结构可以通过各种方法完成，例如共沉淀、浸渍或溶胶-凝胶过程。这些方法的有效性取决于具体应用和催化剂所需属性。文档指出，基于B的催化剂具有高丙烯和氧代物选择性，即使在高丙烷转化率下也是如此。然而，材料中存在的硼酸盐对催化剂活性的贡献并不显著。虽然基于B的催化剂有潜力用于乙烷的氧化脱氢，但它们在丙烷转换中的使用受到除丙烯之外形成乙烯的限制。烯烃和氧代物的选择性受催化剂类型和反应条件的影响，如氧气分压。氢交换反应的结果表明，向氧化铝中添加硼减少了Brnsted酸性，这表明B2O3组分可能主要通过Lewis酸性而不是Brnsted酸性主导催化活性。

The document discusses the preparation of boria-containing catalysts, specifically mentioning the B2O3 (30 wt%)/Al2O3 catalyst. This catalyst was created through impregnation of γ-Al2O3 with boric acid dissolved in warm water. The mechanism of propane activation on this type of catalyst involves Lewis acid sites, which generate propyl radicals that desorb into the gas phase. These radicals participate in secondary reactions with oxygen, leading to the formation of olefins and oxygenates with high selectivity. The addition of boria to alumina affects the surface hydrogen, causing the elimination of mobile hydrogen during a hydrogen-deuterium (HD) exchange reaction in C3D8.
