The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for reactions, allowing for more efficient contact between reactants and active sites. The porous framework ensures easy diffusion of reactants into the material while facilitating the removal of products. The use of a template-free method in synthesizing B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres demonstrates an effective technique for incorporating B active components into these structures. This method allows for the creation of a material with dispersed active sites, which is crucial for maintaining high catalytic activity under various conditions. The tertiary aggregation observed in the formation of B2O3@BPO4 indicates the formation of a unique structure that could potentially improve the material's catalytic efficiency. The fact that B2O3@BPO4 exhibits excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability at 550°C suggests that this material is well-suited for high-temperature applications. This finding opens up new possibilities for the development of metal-free oxides as high-temperature supported liquid-phase catalysts (SLPCs), offering a sustainable alternative to traditional metal-based catalysts.
