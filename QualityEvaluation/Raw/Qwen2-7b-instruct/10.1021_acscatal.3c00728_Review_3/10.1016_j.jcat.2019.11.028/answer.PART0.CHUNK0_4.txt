The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are significantly enhanced by the unique sandwich-like hollow sphere structure formed through a one-step template-free method. This structure allows for the direct incorporation of B active components into porous frameworks, creating a vast number of 3-D dispersed active sites. The tertiary aggregation observed during the formation of B2O3@BPO4 ensures a high density of active sites, improving catalytic performance. The melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 acts as an active species, demonstrating excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability even at high temperatures, surpassing many metal-based catalysts. This method effectively integrates B active components into porous frameworks, offering significant potential for various catalytic applications due to the high dispersion of active sites and the stability at elevated temperatures.
