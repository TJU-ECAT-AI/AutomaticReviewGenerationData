This study analyzes the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, emphasizing how these features enhance catalytic performance. It discusses the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, evaluating their effectiveness for different catalytic applications.

In the synthesis of the B2O3@BPO4 samples, the process begins with the production of BPO4 particles in molten B2O3 at 800°C. As the material cools, BPO4 particles merge and self-assemble into hollow spheres, followed by the formation of B2O3 nanowires that cover the spheres. This results in the creation of sandwich-type B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres with 3-D dispersed active sites.

These active sites provide enhanced catalytic performance due to their 3-D dispersion within the porous framework, which increases accessibility and efficiency in reactions. The synthesis method, characterized as a one-step template-free process, allows for the incorporation of B active components into the structures effectively. This method is particularly advantageous for different catalytic applications, as it facilitates the creation of materials with tailored properties for specific reaction conditions.

The evaluation of the methods used to incorporate B active components highlights their relative effectiveness in achieving desired catalytic performance. The ability to create a 3-D dispersed active site configuration within a porous framework enables improved catalytic efficiency and selectivity, making the synthesized B2O3@BPO4 materials valuable for applications requiring high productivity and robustness.

Answering the critical evaluation, the synthesis of B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres through a one-step template-free method demonstrates an innovative approach to creating metal-free supported liquid-phase catalysts. This method overcomes the challenges associated with traditional supported catalysts by offering a sustainable and efficient way to incorporate B active components into the structures.

In summary, the synthesized B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres exhibit excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability at high temperatures, making them promising candidates for various catalytic applications. The method used to incorporate B active components showcases an effective approach for enhancing catalytic performance through the creation of 3-D dispersed active sites within a porous framework.

The findings suggest that the synthesis of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks can significantly improve catalytic performance, offering potential solutions for various industrial processes. The development of such materials provides a valuable contribution to the field of catalysis, highlighting the importance of innovative synthesis methods in achieving superior catalytic properties.
