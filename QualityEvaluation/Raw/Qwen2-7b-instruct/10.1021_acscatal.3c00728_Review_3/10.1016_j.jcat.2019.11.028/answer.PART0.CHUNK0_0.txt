The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involve the incorporation of boron (B) elements into a three-dimensional network of pores. This design enhances catalytic performance by providing a high surface area and uniform distribution of active sites, which facilitates more efficient and faster reactions. The porous framework allows for better diffusion of reactants and products, reducing the possibility of blocking active sites. The 3-D dispersion ensures that the active sites are accessible from multiple directions, improving the reactivity and efficiency of the catalyst.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures are diverse. The document describes a template-free one-step synthesis method for creating B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres. This process involves the direct merging and assembly of boron phosphate (BPO4) particles in molten boron oxide (B2O3), leading to the formation of hollow spheres with embedded boron oxide nanowires. The use of a template-free method simplifies the synthesis process and potentially reduces the risk of contamination or unwanted impurities that might arise from the use of traditional templates. 

This specific method is effective for certain catalytic applications, such as the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, as demonstrated in the document. The high productivity and stability at high temperatures (up to 550°C) indicate that the boron-based catalysts can perform efficiently under industrial conditions. The tertiary aggregation mentioned suggests the formation of a unique microstructure that might contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity and stability.

However, the effectiveness of these methods can vary depending on the specific catalytic application. Different catalyst designs might require tailored synthesis techniques to optimize for specific properties such as selectivity, stability, or reaction conditions. For instance, while the B2O3@BPO4 system works well for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, other applications might necessitate different materials or synthesis routes to achieve optimal performance.

In conclusion, the incorporation of B active components into 3-D porous frameworks through methods like the template-free synthesis of B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres enhances catalytic performance by providing a highly dispersed and accessible set of active sites. The choice of synthesis method should be guided by the specific requirements of the catalytic application, including the desired reaction conditions, product selectivity, and stability.

结构特征涉及将硼（B）元素融入三维孔隙网络中，形成具有分散活性位点的B基材料。这种设计通过提供高比表面积和均匀分布的活性位点来增强催化性能，从而促进更高效和更快的反应。孔隙框架允许更好的反应物和产物扩散，减少了堵塞活性位点的可能性。三维分散确保活性位点可以从多个方向访问，提高催化剂的反应性和效率。

用于将B活性成分引入这些结构的方法多种多样。文献描述了一种模板自由的一步合成方法，用于制备B2O3@BPO4三明治状空心球。该过程涉及在熔融氧化硼（B2O3）中直接合并硼磷酸（BPO4）颗粒，导致形成含有嵌入氧化硼纳米线的空心球。使用模板自由的方法简化了合成过程，并可能降低了传统模板可能带来的污染或不希望的杂质风险。

这种方法对于某些催化应用是有效的，如文献中所示的丙烷选择性氧化脱氢为丙烯。高达550°C的高产率和稳定性表明，硼基催化剂可以在工业条件下高效运行。提及的三级聚合表明形成了独特的微结构，这可能对增强催化活性和稳定性有贡献。

然而，这些方法的有效性可能因特定催化应用而异。不同的催化剂设计可能需要定制的合成技术以优化特定性质，如选择性、稳定性和反应条件。例如，虽然B2O3@BPO4系统适用于丙烷氧化脱氢，但对于其他应用可能需要不同材料或合成途径以实现最佳性能。

总之，通过模板自由合成的B2O3@BPO4空心球等方法，将B活性成分引入三维孔隙框架，通过提供高度分散且可访问的活性位点来增强催化性能。应根据特定催化应用的需求（包括期望的反应条件、产品选择性和稳定性）选择合成方法。
