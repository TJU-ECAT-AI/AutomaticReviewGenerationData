The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involve the creation of hollow spheres through a one-step template-free method. The tertiary aggregation phenomenon observed enhances the dispersion of active sites, contributing to improved catalytic performance. The incorporation of B active components into these porous structures allows for enhanced control over active sites, leading to higher productivity and stability at high temperatures. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application, with the one-step template-free synthesis offering potential for high yields and reduced costs.
