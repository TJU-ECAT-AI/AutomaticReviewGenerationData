[1] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."
[2] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."
[3] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."
[4] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves examining how the isolation of boron species and their connectivity influence catalytic performance. In the case of B-MWW, the presence of isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to silanol groups suggests a unique structural feature. Despite having a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, B-MWW failed to demonstrate any oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) conversion of propane, indicating that the isolated boron sites are not active for this reaction. This finding contrasts with other boron-based catalysts, such as B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride, which exhibit catalytic activity due to the presence of aggregated boron sites that undergo restructuring under reaction conditions. The stability of B-MWW under reaction conditions and its lack of boron site restructuring suggest that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not occur over isolated BO3 sites. Instead, active boron-based catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of boron-boron connectivity.

This study enhances our understanding of the molecular origins of highly selective ODH catalysts by identifying the importance of boron connectivity in achieving catalytic activity. Future research aims to determine the surface mobility of these materials and identify the specific types of boron-boron interactions necessary for forming active ODH catalysts.

分析具有三维分散活性位点的硼基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征，涉及如何隔离硼物种及其连接性影响催化性能。对于B-MWW而言，存在与硅醇基团相邻的孤立B(OSi)3单元表明了一种独特的结构特性。尽管B-MWW具有足够的硼负载以实现催化活性，但在进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）测试时并未显示出任何超过背景水平的转化，这表明孤立的硼位点对于此反应不具活性。这一发现与B/B-MWW、B/SiO2和硼氮化物等其他硼基催化剂形成对比，这些催化剂在反应条件下表现出催化活性，因为它们含有聚合的硼位点并发生重构。B-MWW在反应条件下的稳定性以及其硼原子位点无重构表明，硼催化的ODH过程不会发生在孤立的BO3位点上。相反，活性硼基催化剂可能需要具有一定程度的硼-硼连接性的硼物种。

通过研究，我们对高度选择性ODH催化剂的分子起源有了更深入的理解，认识到硼连接性对于实现催化活性的重要性。未来的研究旨在确定这些材料的表面流动性，并识别形成活性ODH催化剂所需的特定类型的硼-硼相互作用。

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are characterized by boron being fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units. These features enhance catalytic performance by providing a stable, isolated framework for the boron species, which are crucial for the ODH of propane. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures involve hydrothermal synthesis, which allows for the creation of a stable, 3-D dispersed network of boron species. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application; however, the study suggests that for the ODH of propane, the presence of boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity is essential for catalytic activity.

In terms of evaluating the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, hydrothermal synthesis is found to be effective for creating a stable, 3-D dispersed network of boron species.

However, the study concludes that for the ODH of propane, the presence of boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity is crucial for catalytic activity. This highlights the importance of considering the specific requirements of the catalytic mechanism when designing B-based materials.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, we find that boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units in B-MWW. However, despite being fully loaded with boron, B-MWW exhibits no catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propene. In contrast, active boron-based ODH catalysts like B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride materials contain aggregated boron sites that undergo restructuring under reaction conditions. This suggests that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not occur over isolated BO3 sites. Instead, active boron catalysts might require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity for optimal performance.

在分析以孔结构框架中的三维分散活性位点的B基材料的结构特征时，我们发现，在B-MWW中，硼完全被整合到沸石框架中作为三价BO3单元。然而，尽管B-MWW被充分负载了硼，但它对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）转化为丙烯没有任何催化活性。相比之下，活性B基ODH催化剂如B/B-MWW、B/SiO2和硼氮化物材料含有在反应条件下重新排列的聚合硼位点。这表明，硼催化下的丙烷ODH不会在孤立的BO3位点上发生。相反，活性硼催化剂可能需要具有某些程度的B-O-B连接性的硼物种以实现最佳性能。

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the incorporation of boron into these frameworks enhances catalytic performance. The key features include the presence of isolated boron species, such as BO3 units, which are effectively dispersed within the porous structure. These isolated sites contribute to the material's ability to catalyze reactions efficiently, despite being physically separated from each other. The study of these materials often employs advanced spectroscopic techniques, such as solid-state NMR, to visualize and quantify the boron species' spatial distribution and bonding environment within the zeolite framework. The separation of these active sites ensures that they remain functional under various reaction conditions, thereby maintaining the material's catalytic activity.

The methods used to incorporate boron into these structures vary, including hydrothermal synthesis, post-synthetic impregnation, and ion-exchange processes. The effectiveness of these methods depends on factors such as boron loading, the type of framework material, and the desired level of dispersion of the active sites. For different catalytic applications, the choice of method can significantly impact the material's performance. For instance, in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, the stability and reactivity of the boron species within the framework play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's efficiency and selectivity.

分析硼基材料在多维分散活性位点在孔框架中的结构特征，涉及理解如何将硼纳入这些框架中增强催化性能。关键特征包括存在于孔隙结构中的孤立硼物种，如BO3单元，有效地分布在框架内。这些孤立的站点有助于材料在反应条件下高效催化，尽管它们彼此物理上分离。对这些材料的研究通常采用先进的光谱技术，如固体状态NMR，来可视化和量化硼物种的空间分布及其结合环境。这些活跃站点之间的分离确保它们在各种反应条件下保持功能，从而维持材料的催化活性。

用于将硼纳入这些结构的方法各不相同，包括水热合成、后合成浸渍和离子交换过程。这些方法的有效性取决于诸如硼负载、框架材料类型以及期望的活性站点分散程度等因素。对于不同的催化应用，选择的方法可能显著影响材料的性能。例如，在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）到烯烃中，框架中硼物种的稳定性和反应性在确定催化剂效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the incorporation of boron (B) elements into zeolite structures enhances catalytic performance. The B-MWW zeolite serves as a critical case study, demonstrating that the majority of boron species are incorporated into the zeolite framework as isolated BO3 units. This unique feature of having dispersed active sites within the porous framework is crucial for the catalytic activity of B-based materials. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures typically involve hydrothermal synthesis or post-synthetic techniques like impregnation and ion-exchange. These methods are effective for different catalytic applications, especially when aiming for high selectivity and activity in reactions such as the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins.

The B-MWW zeolite's synthesis, characterization, and subsequent catalytic testing highlight the importance of the boron species' dispersion within the zeolite framework for catalytic activity. The fact that B-MWW lacks catalytic activity for ODH of propane, despite having a sufficient boron loading, indicates that isolated BO3 sites are not the active sites in boron-containing ODH catalysts. This observation contrasts with other traditional catalysts, such as vanadium-based catalysts, and provides valuable insights into the mechanistic aspects of boron-catalyzed ODH reactions.

The detailed characterization of B-MWW through multi-dimensional 1H and 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy reveals that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to silanol groups. This finding emphasizes the role of boron's spatial arrangement within the zeolite framework in determining its catalytic efficacy. The stability of B-MWW under reaction conditions, without significant restructuring of boron atoms, suggests that the lack of catalytic activity is due to the presence of predominantly isolated boron sites rather than aggregated ones found in active catalysts like B/B-MWW and B/SiO2 materials.

This study advances our understanding of boron species involved in the propane ODH mechanism, emphasizing the requirement for boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity to form active ODH catalysts. Future research aims to determine the surface mobility and precisely identify the types of boron-boron interactions necessary for the formation of active ODH catalysts, further enhancing our comprehension of highly selective ODH catalysts.

In summary, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as zeolites, are pivotal for catalytic performance. The incorporation of boron into these structures, particularly through hydrothermal synthesis and post-synthetic methods, enables the creation of catalysts with tailored properties suitable for various chemical transformations, including the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Understanding the precise arrangement and connectivity of boron species within the zeolite framework is crucial for developing more efficient and selective catalysts for these reactions.

分析硼基材料在多维分散活性位点中的结构特性，对于理解此类材料在多孔框架中提高催化性能至关重要。B-MWW沸石作为关键案例研究，展示了大部分硼元素以完全融入沸石框架的孤立BO3单元形式存在。这种在多孔框架中分散的活性位点的独特特征对于硼基材料的催化性能至关重要。将硼活性成分整合到这些结构中的方法通常包括水热合成或后合成技术，如浸渍和离子交换。这些方法对于不同催化应用非常有效，特别是旨在实现烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）到烯烃的高选择性和活性。

B-MWW沸石的合成、表征及其后续催化测试强调了硼物种在沸石框架内分散对于催化活性的重要性。尽管B-MWW缺乏丙烷氧化脱氢反应的催化活性，尽管其具有足够的硼载量，这表明孤立的BO3位点不是硼含氧基催化剂中的活性位点。这一观察与传统催化剂如钒基催化剂形成对比，并为了解硼催化ODH反应机制提供了宝贵见解。

通过多维1H和11B固态核磁共振光谱的详细表征显示，硼主要以邻接硅醇基团的孤立B(OSi)3单元形式存在。这一发现强调了硼在沸石框架内排列对于确定其催化效率的作用。B-MWW在反应条件下保持稳定，没有显著重组硼原子，表明缺乏催化活性的原因在于存在大量孤立的硼位点，而不是在活性催化剂如B/B-MWW和B/SiO2材料中发现的聚合位点。

这项研究推进了我们对参与丙烷ODH机制的硼物种的理解，强调了形成有效ODH催化剂所需的硼-硼相互作用的必要性。未来的研究旨在确定表面流动性并精确识别形成活性ODH催化剂所需的硼-硼相互作用类型，进一步加深我们对高度选择性ODH催化剂的理解。

简而言之，硼基材料在多维分散活性位点中的结构特性，特别是在沸石等多孔框架中，对于催化性能至关重要。通过水热合成和后合成方法将硼整合到这些结构中，可以创建具有定制属性的催化剂，适用于各种化学转换，包括烷烃的氧化脱氢。理解硼物种在沸石框架内的精确排列和连接对于开发更高效和选择性的催化剂对于这些反应至关重要。
