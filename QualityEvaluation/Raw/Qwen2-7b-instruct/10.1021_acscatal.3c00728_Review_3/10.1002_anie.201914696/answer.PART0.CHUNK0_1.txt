The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are characterized by boron being fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units. These features enhance catalytic performance by providing a stable, isolated framework for the boron species, which are crucial for the ODH of propane. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures involve hydrothermal synthesis, which allows for the creation of a stable, 3-D dispersed network of boron species. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application; however, the study suggests that for the ODH of propane, the presence of boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity is essential for catalytic activity.

In terms of evaluating the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, hydrothermal synthesis is found to be effective for creating a stable, 3-D dispersed network of boron species. This method ensures that boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework, providing a stable environment for the active sites. However, the study concludes that for the ODH of propane, the presence of boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity is crucial for catalytic activity. This highlights the importance of considering the specific requirements of the catalytic mechanism when designing B-based materials.
