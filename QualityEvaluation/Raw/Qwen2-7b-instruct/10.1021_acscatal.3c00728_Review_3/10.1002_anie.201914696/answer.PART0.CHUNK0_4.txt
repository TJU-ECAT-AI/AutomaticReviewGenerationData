Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the incorporation of boron (B) elements into zeolite structures enhances catalytic performance. The B-MWW zeolite serves as a critical case study, demonstrating that the majority of boron species are incorporated into the zeolite framework as isolated BO3 units. This unique feature of having dispersed active sites within the porous framework is crucial for the catalytic activity of B-based materials. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures typically involve hydrothermal synthesis or post-synthetic techniques like impregnation and ion-exchange. These methods are effective for different catalytic applications, especially when aiming for high selectivity and activity in reactions such as the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins.

The B-MWW zeolite's synthesis, characterization, and subsequent catalytic testing highlight the importance of the boron species' dispersion within the zeolite framework for catalytic activity. The fact that B-MWW lacks catalytic activity for ODH of propane, despite having a sufficient boron loading, indicates that isolated BO3 sites are not the active sites in boron-containing ODH catalysts. This observation contrasts with other traditional catalysts, such as vanadium-based catalysts, and provides valuable insights into the mechanistic aspects of boron-catalyzed ODH reactions.

The detailed characterization of B-MWW through multi-dimensional 1H and 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy reveals that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to silanol groups. This finding emphasizes the role of boron's spatial arrangement within the zeolite framework in determining its catalytic efficacy. The stability of B-MWW under reaction conditions, without significant restructuring of boron atoms, suggests that the lack of catalytic activity is due to the presence of predominantly isolated boron sites rather than aggregated ones found in active catalysts like B/B-MWW and B/SiO2 materials.

This study advances our understanding of boron species involved in the propane ODH mechanism, emphasizing the requirement for boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity to form active ODH catalysts. Future research aims to determine the surface mobility and precisely identify the types of boron-boron interactions necessary for the formation of active ODH catalysts, further enhancing our comprehension of highly selective ODH catalysts.

In summary, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as zeolites, are pivotal for catalytic performance. The incorporation of boron into these structures, particularly through hydrothermal synthesis and post-synthetic methods, enables the creation of catalysts with tailored properties suitable for various chemical transformations, including the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Understanding the precise arrangement and connectivity of boron species within the zeolite framework is crucial for developing more efficient and selective catalysts for these reactions.

分析硼基材料在多维分散活性位点中的结构特性，对于理解此类材料在多孔框架中提高催化性能至关重要。B-MWW沸石作为关键案例研究，展示了大部分硼元素以完全融入沸石框架的孤立BO3单元形式存在。这种在多孔框架中分散的活性位点的独特特征对于硼基材料的催化性能至关重要。将硼活性成分整合到这些结构中的方法通常包括水热合成或后合成技术，如浸渍和离子交换。这些方法对于不同催化应用非常有效，特别是旨在实现烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）到烯烃的高选择性和活性。

B-MWW沸石的合成、表征及其后续催化测试强调了硼物种在沸石框架内分散对于催化活性的重要性。尽管B-MWW缺乏丙烷氧化脱氢反应的催化活性，尽管其具有足够的硼载量，这表明孤立的BO3位点不是硼含氧基催化剂中的活性位点。这一观察与传统催化剂如钒基催化剂形成对比，并为了解硼催化ODH反应机制提供了宝贵见解。

通过多维1H和11B固态核磁共振光谱的详细表征显示，硼主要以邻接硅醇基团的孤立B(OSi)3单元形式存在。这一发现强调了硼在沸石框架内排列对于确定其催化效率的作用。B-MWW在反应条件下保持稳定，没有显著重组硼原子，表明缺乏催化活性的原因在于存在大量孤立的硼位点，而不是在活性催化剂如B/B-MWW和B/SiO2材料中发现的聚合位点。

这项研究推进了我们对参与丙烷ODH机制的硼物种的理解，强调了形成有效ODH催化剂所需的硼-硼相互作用的必要性。未来的研究旨在确定表面流动性并精确识别形成活性ODH催化剂所需的硼-硼相互作用类型，进一步加深我们对高度选择性ODH催化剂的理解。

简而言之，硼基材料在多维分散活性位点中的结构特性，特别是在沸石等多孔框架中，对于催化性能至关重要。通过水热合成和后合成方法将硼整合到这些结构中，可以创建具有定制属性的催化剂，适用于各种化学转换，包括烷烃的氧化脱氢。理解硼物种在沸石框架内的精确排列和连接对于开发更高效和选择性的催化剂对于这些反应至关重要。
