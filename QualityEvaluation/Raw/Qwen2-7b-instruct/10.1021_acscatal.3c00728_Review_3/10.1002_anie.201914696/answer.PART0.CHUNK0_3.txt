[1] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework."
[2] "The SSNMR data also suggests that these sites are well separated (>34Å apart) from one another."
[3] "In the 2D 11B1H DRINEPT spectrum of B-MWW recorded with 2.56ms of recoupling only weak correlations are observed between the B(OSi)2(OH) 1HNMR signal at 3.6ppm and the B(OSi)3 11BNMR signals, suggesting these sites are well separated within the zeolite."
[4] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the incorporation of boron into these frameworks enhances catalytic performance. The key features include the presence of isolated boron species, such as BO3 units, which are effectively dispersed within the porous structure. These isolated sites contribute to the material's ability to catalyze reactions efficiently, despite being physically separated from each other. The study of these materials often employs advanced spectroscopic techniques, such as solid-state NMR, to visualize and quantify the boron species' spatial distribution and bonding environment within the zeolite framework. The separation of these active sites ensures that they remain functional under various reaction conditions, thereby maintaining the material's catalytic activity.

The methods used to incorporate boron into these structures vary, including hydrothermal synthesis, post-synthetic impregnation, and ion-exchange processes. The effectiveness of these methods depends on factors such as boron loading, the type of framework material, and the desired level of dispersion of the active sites. For different catalytic applications, the choice of method can significantly impact the material's performance. For instance, in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, the stability and reactivity of the boron species within the framework play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's efficiency and selectivity.

分析硼基材料在多维分散活性位点在孔框架中的结构特征，涉及理解如何将硼纳入这些框架中增强催化性能。关键特征包括存在于孔隙结构中的孤立硼物种，如BO3单元，有效地分布在框架内。这些孤立的站点有助于材料在反应条件下高效催化，尽管它们彼此物理上分离。对这些材料的研究通常采用先进的光谱技术，如固体状态NMR，来可视化和量化硼物种的空间分布及其结合环境。这些活跃站点之间的分离确保它们在各种反应条件下保持功能，从而维持材料的催化活性。

用于将硼纳入这些结构的方法各不相同，包括水热合成、后合成浸渍和离子交换过程。这些方法的有效性取决于诸如硼负载、框架材料类型以及期望的活性站点分散程度等因素。对于不同的催化应用，选择的方法可能显著影响材料的性能。例如，在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）到烯烃中，框架中硼物种的稳定性和反应性在确定催化剂效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。
