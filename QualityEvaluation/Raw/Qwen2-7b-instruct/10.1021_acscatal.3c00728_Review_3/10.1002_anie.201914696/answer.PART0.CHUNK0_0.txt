[1] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."
[2] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."
[3] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."
[4] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves examining how the isolation of boron species and their connectivity influence catalytic performance. In the case of B-MWW, the presence of isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to silanol groups suggests a unique structural feature. Despite having a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, B-MWW failed to demonstrate any oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) conversion of propane, indicating that the isolated boron sites are not active for this reaction. This finding contrasts with other boron-based catalysts, such as B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride, which exhibit catalytic activity due to the presence of aggregated boron sites that undergo restructuring under reaction conditions. The stability of B-MWW under reaction conditions and its lack of boron site restructuring suggest that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not occur over isolated BO3 sites. Instead, active boron-based catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of boron-boron connectivity.

This study enhances our understanding of the molecular origins of highly selective ODH catalysts by identifying the importance of boron connectivity in achieving catalytic activity. Future research aims to determine the surface mobility of these materials and identify the specific types of boron-boron interactions necessary for forming active ODH catalysts.

分析具有三维分散活性位点的硼基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征，涉及如何隔离硼物种及其连接性影响催化性能。对于B-MWW而言，存在与硅醇基团相邻的孤立B(OSi)3单元表明了一种独特的结构特性。尽管B-MWW具有足够的硼负载以实现催化活性，但在进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）测试时并未显示出任何超过背景水平的转化，这表明孤立的硼位点对于此反应不具活性。这一发现与B/B-MWW、B/SiO2和硼氮化物等其他硼基催化剂形成对比，这些催化剂在反应条件下表现出催化活性，因为它们含有聚合的硼位点并发生重构。B-MWW在反应条件下的稳定性以及其硼原子位点无重构表明，硼催化的ODH过程不会发生在孤立的BO3位点上。相反，活性硼基催化剂可能需要具有一定程度的硼-硼连接性的硼物种。

通过研究，我们对高度选择性ODH催化剂的分子起源有了更深入的理解，认识到硼连接性对于实现催化活性的重要性。未来的研究旨在确定这些材料的表面流动性，并识别形成活性ODH催化剂所需的特定类型的硼-硼相互作用。
