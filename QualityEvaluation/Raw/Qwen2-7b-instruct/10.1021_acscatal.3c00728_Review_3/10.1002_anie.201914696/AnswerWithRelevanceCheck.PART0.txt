          [1] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."
          [2] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."
          [3] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."
          [4] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

          Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the incorporation of boron into these frameworks enhances catalytic performance. The key features include the presence of isolated boron species, such as BO3 units, which are effectively dispersed within the porous structure. These isolated sites contribute to the material's ability to catalyze reactions efficiently, despite being physically separated from each other. The study of these materials often employs advanced spectroscopic techniques, such as solid-state NMR, to visualize and quantify the boron species' spatial distribution and bonding environment within the zeolite framework. The separation of these active sites ensures that they remain functional under various reaction conditions, thereby maintaining the material's catalytic activity.

          分析硼基材料在多维分散活性位点中的结构特性，涉及理解将硼纳入这些框架中如何增强催化性能。关键特征包括存在于孔隙结构中的孤立硼物种，如BO3单元，有效地分布在框架内。这些孤立的站点有助于材料高效催化反应，尽管它们彼此物理上分离。对这些材料的研究通常采用高级光谱技术，如固体状态NMR，来可视化并量化硼物种在沸石框架内的空间分布和结合环境。这些活跃站点之间的分离确保它们在各种反应条件下保持功能，从而维持材料的催化活性。

          [1] "B-MWW Zeolite: The Case Against Single-Site Catalysis Graphical Abstract Solid-state NMR spectroscopy of hydrothermally synthesized B-MWW reveals that boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units."
          [2] "However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."
          [3] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."
          [4] "This study advances the understanding of boron species involved in the propane ODH mechanism and will direct future work in understanding the molecular origins of highly selective ODH catalysts."
