The nc-G prevents structural deformations during chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. The sp3-hybridized edges of nc-G play a crucial role in these processes. The synthesized h-BN thin film is characterized by an ultra-flat surface morphology and is free from structural deformations, such as wrinkles and ripples, which are typical in CVD-grown h-BN thin films. This finding represents a significant advancement in the preparation of high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large scale.\n\nThe analysis of the structural properties of the h-BN thin film revealed that it consists of a long-range-ordered crystalline h-BN region and a short-range-ordered carbon region. The peak at 1357 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of the h-BN thin film is attributed to the superposition of the E2g mode of h-BN and the G mode of graphene. The formation of nc-G is hypothesized to occur due to small amounts of carbon-containing gases in air, particularly methane, under atmospheric pressure conditions. The document also highlights that nc-G acts as a useful seed for growing high-quality h-BN with an atomically flat surface on various substrates, including c-plane sapphire. This is evidenced by the successful synthesis of a wafer-scale, ultraflat h-BN thin film on a bare c-Al2O3 substrate, which contrasts with the inability to form uniformly flat h-BN on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under equivalent growth conditions.\n\nFurthermore, the role of the nc-G sp3 edges in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer is elucidated through calculations of the maximum stabilization energies of h-BN monolayers terminated with B, N, O, and H atoms using the Vienna abinitio simulation package.

The nc-G prevents structural deformations during chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. The sp3-hybridized edges of nc-G play a crucial role in these processes. The synthesized h-BN thin film is characterized by an ultra-flat surface morphology and is free from structural deformations, such as wrinkles and ripples, which are typical in CVD-grown h-BN thin films. This finding represents a significant advancement in the preparation of high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large scale.\n\nThe analysis of the structural properties of the h-BN thin film revealed that it consists of a long-range-ordered crystalline h-BN region and a short-range-ordered carbon region. The peak at 1357 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of the h-BN thin film is attributed to the superposition of the E2g mode of h-BN and the G mode of graphene. The formation of nc-G is hypothesized to occur due to small amounts of carbon-containing gases in air, particularly methane, under atmospheric pressure conditions. The document also highlights that nc-G acts as a useful seed for growing high-quality h-BN with an atomically flat surface on various substrates, including c-plane sapphire. This is evidenced by the successful synthesis of a wafer-scale, ultraflat h-BN thin film on a bare c-Al2O3 substrate, which contrasts with the inability to form uniformly flat h-BN on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under equivalent growth conditions.\n\nFurthermore, the role of the nc-G sp3 edges in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer is elucidated through calculations of the maximum stabilization energies of h-BN monolayers terminated with B, N, O, and H atoms using the Vienna abinitio simulation package.

The nc-G prevents structural deformations during chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. The sp3-hybridized edges of nc-G play a crucial role in these processes. The synthesized h-BN thin film is characterized by an ultra-flat surface morphology and is free from structural deformations, such as wrinkles and ripples, which are typical in CVD-grown h-BN thin films. This finding represents a significant advancement in the preparation of high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large scale.\n\nThe analysis of the structural properties of the h-BN thin film revealed that it consists of a long-range-ordered crystalline h-BN region and a short-range-ordered carbon region. The peak at 1357 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of the h-BN thin film is attributed to the superposition of the E2g mode of h-BN and the G mode of graphene. The formation of nc-G is hypothesized to occur due to small amounts of carbon-containing gases in air, particularly methane, under atmospheric pressure conditions. The document also highlights that nc-G acts as a useful seed for growing high-quality h-BN with an atomically flat surface on various substrates, including c-plane sapphire. This is evidenced by the successful synthesis of a wafer-scale, ultraflat h-BN thin film on a bare c-Al2O3 substrate, which contrasts with the inability to form uniformly flat h-BN on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under equivalent growth conditions.\n\nFurthermore, the role of the nc-G sp3 edges in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer is elucidated through calculations of the maximum stabilization energies of h-BN monolayers terminated with B, N, O, and H atoms using the Vienna abinitio simulation package.
