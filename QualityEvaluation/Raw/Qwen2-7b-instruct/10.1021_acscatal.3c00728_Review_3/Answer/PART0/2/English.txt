In the study presented in the document, the researchers discovered that unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) can serve as an effective seed for synthesizing large-area hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films with atomically flat surfaces, akin to those found in exfoliated single-crystal h-BN. The nc-G prevents structural deformations during chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. The sp3-hybridized edges of nc-G play a crucial role in these processes. The synthesized h-BN thin film is characterized by an ultra-flat surface morphology and is free from structural deformations, such as wrinkles and ripples, which are typical in CVD-grown h-BN thin films. This finding represents a significant advancement in the preparation of high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large scale.

The analysis of the structural properties of the h-BN thin film revealed that it consists of a long-range-ordered crystalline h-BN region and a short-range-ordered carbon region. The peak at 1357 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of the h-BN thin film is attributed to the superposition of the E2g mode of h-BN and the G mode of graphene. The formation of nc-G is hypothesized to occur due to small amounts of carbon-containing gases in air, particularly methane, under atmospheric pressure conditions. The document also highlights that nc-G acts as a useful seed for growing high-quality h-BN with an atomically flat surface on various substrates, including c-plane sapphire. This is evidenced by the successful synthesis of a wafer-scale, ultraflat h-BN thin film on a bare c-Al2O3 substrate, which contrasts with the inability to form uniformly flat h-BN on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under equivalent growth conditions.

Furthermore, the role of the nc-G sp3 edges in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer is elucidated through calculations of the maximum stabilization energies of h-BN monolayers terminated with B, N, O, and H atoms using the Vienna abinitio simulation package.

In the study presented in the document, the researchers discovered that unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) can serve as an effective seed for synthesizing large-area hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films with atomically flat surfaces, akin to those found in exfoliated single-crystal h-BN. The nc-G prevents structural deformations during chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. The sp3-hybridized edges of nc-G play a crucial role in these processes. The synthesized h-BN thin film is characterized by an ultra-flat surface morphology and is free from structural deformations, such as wrinkles and ripples, which are typical in CVD-grown h-BN thin films. This finding represents a significant advancement in the preparation of high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large scale.

The analysis of the structural properties of the h-BN thin film revealed that it consists of a long-range-ordered crystalline h-BN region and a short-range-ordered carbon region. The peak at 1357 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of the h-BN thin film is attributed to the superposition of the E2g mode of h-BN and the G mode of graphene. The formation of nc-G is hypothesized to occur due to small amounts of carbon-containing gases in air, particularly methane, under atmospheric pressure conditions. The document also highlights that nc-G acts as a useful seed for growing high-quality h-BN with an atomically flat surface on various substrates, including c-plane sapphire. This is evidenced by the successful synthesis of a wafer-scale, ultraflat h-BN thin film on a bare c-Al2O3 substrate, which contrasts with the inability to form uniformly flat h-BN on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under equivalent growth conditions.

Furthermore, the role of the nc-G sp3 edges in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer is elucidated through calculations of the maximum stabilization energies of h-BN monolayers terminated with B, N, O, and H atoms using the Vienna abinitio simulation package.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the unique arrangement and coordination of boron species within the zeolite matrix enhance catalytic performance. Borosilicate zeolites, especially those with low crystallinity, exhibit excellent catalytic efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Solid-state NMR, dual-beam FTIR, and in-situ DRIFT measurements confirm that boron species are anchored in open coordination within the zeolite matrix. Surface SiOH groups facilitate hydrogen bonding with BOH in defective boron species, inhibiting boron leaching. Aggregated BOx species with BOH groups hydrogen bonding to adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center for low-temperature ODHP reactions. Homogeneously distributed boron in borosilicate zeolites plays a critical role in determining their catalytic properties, with the micro-environment of boron species being the dominant factor.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of boron-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals several enhancements to catalytic performance. The porous frameworks allow for the efficient distribution of active sites, increasing the likelihood of contact between reactants and catalysts. The 3-D dispersion ensures that these active sites are accessible to reactants throughout the material, improving overall efficiency. The presence of boron atoms, acting as Lewis bases, facilitates the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from alkane molecules, forming alkenes. The oxygen functional groups on the surface of these materials are crucial for the activation of oxygen molecules, which are necessary for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The introduction of boron oxide or boron itself into these structures modifies the surface chemistry, leading to enhanced selectivity and stability. The covalent bonding of boron to the carbon nanotube structure ensures durability under reaction conditions, contributing to the long-term stability of the catalyst. The ability of boron to reduce the formation of non-selective oxygen species, such as peroxide or superoxide, further improves the selectivity of the catalytic process. This combination of features makes boron-based materials particularly effective for catalytic applications involving the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional metal oxides.

The study examined the propane dehydrogenation reaction under atmospheric pressure at 590°C. The initial conversion of propane on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was 48.7% at a space velocity (WHSV) of 9.4 h−1 near equilibrium, with a propylene selectivity of 99.1% after a 24-hour test. In contrast, the PtSn/Al2O3 reference catalyst saw a significant drop in propane conversion, from 43.8% to 28.3% over 24 hours. A first-order deactivation model was employed to assess the catalyst's stability. The PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst demonstrated superior reactivity and stability in the dehydrogenation process, as evidenced by its high yield at a low deactivation rate. The 2D sheet structure may promote diffusion and affect the catalytic behavior in the dehydrogenation reaction. Increased space velocities highlight the importance of mass transfer and diffusion on the reaction rate. The specific activity of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst increased significantly more than that of the PtSn/Al2O3ref. catalyst when the WHSV was raised from 1.9 h−1 to 56.5 h−1. STEM analysis revealed that the size and morphology of Pt-Sn clusters supported on the Al2O3 sheet remained virtually unchanged after 24 hours of dehydrogenation, indicating the catalyst's outstanding sintering resistance. The amount of coke deposited on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet was notably less than on the PtSn/Al2O3ref. catalyst, minimizing coke formation on the metal sites of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet during reactions, thus maintaining high stability under reaction conditions. Our research also confirmed that the sheet construction of the catalyst enhances mass transfer and kinetically controlled diffusion processes during propane dehydrogenation.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the incorporation of boron into these frameworks enhances catalytic performance. The key features include the presence of isolated boron species, such as BO3 units, which are effectively dispersed within the porous structure. These isolated sites contribute to the material's ability to catalyze reactions efficiently, despite being physically separated from each other. The study of these materials often employs advanced spectroscopic techniques, such as solid-state NMR, to visualize and quantify the boron species' spatial distribution and bonding environment within the zeolite framework. The separation of these active sites ensures that they remain functional under various reaction conditions, thereby maintaining the material's catalytic activity.

The PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst demonstrated greater resistance to deactivation compared to the PtSn/Al catalyst. The reduced and spent catalysts showed homogeneous PtSn and Pt3Sn alloys without core-shell structures. The coke transport from metallic sites to the support on PtSn/ZnAlO was found to be more efficient than on the PtSn/Al catalyst. The stability of a PtSn/support catalyst is contingent upon the type of PtSn alloy, which influences the coke transport phenomena.

In the study presented in the document, the researchers discovered that unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) can serve as an effective seed for synthesizing large-area hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films with atomically flat surfaces, akin to those found in exfoliated single-crystal h-BN. The nc-G prevents structural deformations during chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. The sp3-hybridized edges of nc-G play a crucial role in these processes. The synthesized h-BN thin film is characterized by an ultra-flat surface morphology and is free from structural deformations, such as wrinkles and ripples, which are typical in CVD-grown h-BN thin films. This finding represents a significant advancement in the preparation of high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large scale.

The analysis of the structural properties of the h-BN thin film revealed that it consists of a long-range-ordered crystalline h-BN region and a short-range-ordered carbon region. The peak at 1357 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of the h-BN thin film is attributed to the superposition of the E2g mode of h-BN and the G mode of graphene. The formation of nc-G is hypothesized to occur due to small amounts of carbon-containing gases in air, particularly methane, under atmospheric pressure conditions. The document also highlights that nc-G acts as a useful seed for growing high-quality h-BN with an atomically flat surface on various substrates, including c-plane sapphire. This is evidenced by the successful synthesis of a wafer-scale, ultraflat h-BN thin film on a bare c-Al2O3 substrate, which contrasts with the inability to form uniformly flat h-BN on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under equivalent growth conditions.

Furthermore, the role of the nc-G sp3 edges in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer is elucidated through calculations of the maximum stabilization energies of h-BN monolayers terminated with B, N, O, and H atoms using the Vienna abinitio simulation package. These findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the synthesis of high-quality h-BN thin films and provide insights into the potential for tailoring the catalytic performance of these materials based on their structural characteristics.

Boron is primarily found in nature as an oxyanion in minerals. Modern technology has enabled the synthesis of h-BN through various methods such as mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition, and solid-state reactions. The high exothermic nature of ODH reactions leads to the formation of hotspots in the catalyst bed, which can accelerate the undesired over-oxidation of olefins, resulting in low selectivity to olefins. Boron oxide (B2O3) exhibits a low melting point (450°C) and low viscosity (436 Poise at 750°C), commonly found in a glassy state. Earlier studies have prepared supported boron oxide catalysts on metal oxides (Al2O3, MgO, La2O3, ZnO, etc.), demonstrating the best catalytic performance in the partial oxidation of ethane, producing acetaldehyde and ethylene with high selectivity and yield at 550°C. However, this comes at the cost of emitting a significant amount of CO.
