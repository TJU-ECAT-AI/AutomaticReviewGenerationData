The structural characteristics of B-based materials, which feature 3-D dispersed active sites within porous frameworks, significantly boost their catalytic performance. These sites enable the catalysts to promote more efficient and selective reactions. The B active components are integrated into these structures via diverse methodologies, with their efficacy differing based on the particular catalytic use-case.
