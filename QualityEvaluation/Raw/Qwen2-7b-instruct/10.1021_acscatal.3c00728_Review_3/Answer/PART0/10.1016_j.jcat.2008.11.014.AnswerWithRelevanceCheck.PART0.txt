          "The study aims to comprehensively characterize the nature and distribution of chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane using various spectroscopic techniques including N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopyenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEMEDXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS)."
          "Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles."
          "The intrinsic activity of these isolated Cr species is higher than those observed on γ-Al2O3 (1 wt% Cr)."
          "For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3."
          "In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites."
          "It is reasonable to say that active DHP sites are generated during the reaction, the origin of which are Cr(VI) species in coordination reflected by the pre-edge peak in XANES."

          The study aims to comprehensively analyze the nature and distribution of chromium species in catalysts for dehydrogenating propane, employing various spectroscopic techniques such as nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEMEDXS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS). Notably, γ-Al2O3 predominantly contains oligomers with varying degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species, but no Cr2O3 particles. The intrinsic activity of isolated Cr species is higher than those observed on γ-Al2O3 at 1 wt% chromium content. In xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination numbers greater than four are more active, selective, and stable compared to Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. Conversely, oligomeric Cr species on xCrAl2O3 are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites. It is reasonable to suggest that active dehydrogenation sites are generated during the reaction, originating from chromium(VI) species in coordination, as indicated by the pre-edge peak in XANES.

          研究旨在利用包括氮气吸附、X射线衍射（XRD）、紫外拉曼光谱、扫描透射电子显微镜能谱（STEMEDXS）和X射线吸收光谱（XANES和EXAFS）在内的多种光谱技术，全面分析用于脱氢丙烷的催化剂中铬物种的性质和分布。值得注意的是，γ-Al2O3主要包含具有不同核度的寡聚物以及一小部分孤立物种，但没有Cr2O3颗粒。孤立铬物种的内在活性高于γ-Al2O3中1 wt%铬含量的同类物种。在xCrSBA-15中，发现协调数大于四的孤立铬(III)位点比表面的铬2O3颗粒位点更活跃、选择性和稳定。相反，在xCrAl2O3中，发现寡聚型铬物种比孤立铬物种更活跃和选择性。合理推测，反应期间生成的活性脱氢位点来源于在XANES中的预边峰所反映的协调的铬(VI)物种。
