          [1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."
          [2] "The catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited excellent catalytic efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
          [3] "A combination of solid-state NMR, dual-beam FTIR, and in-situ DRIFT measurements reveal that the boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in the form of open coordination."
          [4] "Meanwhile, the ample SiOH groups on the surface facilitate the formation of hydrogen bonds with the BOH in defective boron species and inhibit the excessive leaching of boron."
          [5] "The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."
          [6] "Borosilicate zeolites with homogeneous distribution of boron have been proved as the promising catalyst in ODHP reaction and the micro-environment of boron species is the dominant factor for the catalytic properties."

          Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the unique arrangement and coordination of boron species within the zeolite matrix enhance catalytic performance. Borosilicate zeolites, especially those with low crystallinity, exhibit excellent catalytic efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Solid-state NMR, dual-beam FTIR, and in-situ DRIFT measurements confirm that boron species are anchored in open coordination within the zeolite matrix. Surface SiOH groups facilitate hydrogen bonding with BOH in defective boron species, inhibiting boron leaching. Aggregated BOx species with BOH groups hydrogen bonding to adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center for low-temperature ODHP reactions. Homogeneously distributed boron in borosilicate zeolites plays a critical role in determining their catalytic properties, with the micro-environment of boron species being the dominant factor.

          在多维分散活性位点的孔框架中的B基材料的结构特征分析涉及理解硼物种在沸石骨架内的独特排列和协调如何增强催化性能。硼硅酸盐沸石，尤其是那些低结晶度的，表现出在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的出色催化效率。固体状态核磁共振、双光束傅里叶变换红外光谱和原位DRIFT测量证实，硼物种在沸石骨架中以开放配合物的形式被锚定。表面的SiOH基团有助于与缺陷硼物种中的BOH形成氢键，抑制硼的流失。聚合BOx物种中与相邻SiOH基团通过氢键结合的BOH基团被识别为低温下催化ODHP反应的活性中心。均匀分布的硼在硼硅酸盐沸石中起着关键作用，决定其催化性能，其中硼物种的微观环境是决定催化性能的主要因素。
