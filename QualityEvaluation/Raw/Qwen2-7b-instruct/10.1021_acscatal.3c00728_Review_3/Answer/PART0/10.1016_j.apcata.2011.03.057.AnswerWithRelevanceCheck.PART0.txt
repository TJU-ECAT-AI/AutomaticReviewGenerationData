          [1] "The different PtSn alloy compositions on the catalysts influenced the coke mobility."
          [2] "The addition of Sn as a promoter apparently lessened the coke formation."
          [3] "With the Al2O3 support, the coke contents were 4.1 and 6.1 wt% whereas the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst generated only 2.5 and 4.9 wt% coke."
          [4] "The high catalytic stability of PtSn/ZnAl2O4 originates from the relatively faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support."
          [5] "The amount of coke accumulated on the PtSn/ZnAlO was slightly less than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst, and the transport of the coke from metallic sites to the support on PtSn/ZnAlO became easier than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst."

          The research explored the connection between the stability of PtSn catalysts and the properties of the PtSn bimetallic alloys. Various analytical techniques were employed to investigate the PtSn bimetallic phases with fresh and spent catalysts. The addition of tin as a promoter reduced coke formation. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed superior stability due to its ability to facilitate faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support. This was confirmed by XPS measurements. The PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst accumulated slightly less coke compared to the PtSn/Al catalyst, making the transport of coke from metallic sites to the support easier on PtSn/ZnAlO.

          研究旨在探究铂锡合金体系的稳定性与PtSn双金属相之间的关系。通过多种分析技术，研究人员对带有新鲜和使用过的催化剂的PtSn双金属相进行了研究。添加锡作为促进剂减少了焦炭的生成。PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂由于能够促进金属表面到支撑体的焦炭移动性更快，显示出优越的稳定性。这一结果通过XPS测量得到了证实。与PtSn/Al催化剂相比，PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂积累的焦炭略少，使得从金属位点到支撑体的焦炭运输在PtSn/ZnAlO上变得更加容易。

          [1] "The PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst showed a higher tolerance for deactivation than the PtSn/Al catalyst."
          [2] "The PtSn and Pt3Sn alloy in the reduced and spent catalysts exhibited homogeneity without coreshell structures."
          [3] "The transport of the coke from metallic sites to the support on PtSn/ZnAlO became easier than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst."
          [4] "The stability of a PtSn/support catalyst depends on the type of PtSn alloy, relating to the coke transport phenomena."

          The PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst demonstrated greater resistance to deactivation compared to the PtSn/Al catalyst. The reduced and spent catalysts showed homogeneous PtSn and Pt3Sn alloys without core-shell structures. The coke transport from metallic sites to the support on PtSn/ZnAlO was found to be more efficient than on the PtSn/Al catalyst. The stability of a PtSn/support catalyst is contingent upon the type of PtSn alloy, which influences the coke transport phenomena.

          PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂在抵抗失活方面比PtSn/Al催化剂表现得更好。在还原和使用过的催化剂中，观察到PtSn和Pt3Sn合金具有均一性，没有核心壳结构。从金属位点到支撑体的焦炭运输在PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂上比在PtSn/Al催化剂上更为有效。PtSn/support催化剂的稳定性依赖于PtSn合金的类型，这影响了焦炭运输现象。
