The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks play a critical role in improving catalytic performance. These features enable more efficient and selective reactions. Different methods for integrating B active components into such structures exhibit varying degrees of effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application required.

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit improved catalytic performance thanks to their high surface area and easy access to active sites. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and sol-gel methods are commonly used to incorporate B active components into these structures, offering different levels of control over the structure and composition. The effectiveness of these methods for various catalytic uses relies on aspects such as the targeted size distribution of the active sites, stability under operating conditions, and compatibility with subsequent processing stages.

The document discusses the synthesis of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films using unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a seed layer. The presence of nc-G leads to the formation of an ultraflat h-BN thin film with an atomically flat surface, comparable to exfoliated single-crystal h-BN. This method prevents structural deformations in the chemical vapor deposition process, offering a novel approach for preparing high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large surface. The sp3 carbon edges of nc-G play a crucial role in the lateral growth of h-BN, facilitating the formation of an atomically flat surface. The formation of the h-BN thin film on the nc-G-stacked structure is attributed to the similar negative thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) of nc-G and h-BN, which reduces thermal stress-induced structural deformations. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate that BO and CO bonds are formed, contributing to the growth of h-BN from the edges of nc-G. The optimization of the h-BN thin film results in an electrically insulating surface with minimal electrical conductivity. The use of nc-G as a seed layer allows for the preparation of high-quality two-dimensional materials with controlled surface morphology and enhanced properties, which is beneficial for various applications in electronics and catalysis.
