          [1] "γ-Al2O3 nanosheets rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can nicely disperse and stabilize raft-like Pt-Sn clusters as a result of strong interactions between metal and support."
          [2] "Consequently, there are strong electronic interactions between the Pt and Sn atoms, resulting in an increase in the electron density of the Pt sites."
          [3] "When used in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, this catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity, and superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties."
          [4] "Sheet-like nanoarchitectures are an ideal choice for improving the mass-transfer and diffusion kinetics, which can in principle inhibit the secondary reaction that generates coke."
          [5] "The catalyst support plays a crucial role in modulating the geometric and electronic structure of active metal phases for optimizing the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability."
          [6] "The Al2O3 nanosheet synthesized in this work contains a large percentage (27%) of pentacoordinate Al3+ sites."
          [7] "These results nicely support the conclusion that the clusters on the Al2O3 nanosheet have a raft-like structure and experience strong metalsupport interactions."
          [8] "On the other hand, CO DRIFT spectroscopy of the PtSn/Al2O3ref. catalyst revealed a strong vibration band at 2070cm1 and a small vibration at 2015cm1, suggesting that Pt and Sn only weakly interact in this reference catalyst."
          [9] "This unique structure could account for the formation of the highly dispersed and stabilized Pt-Sn clusters on its surface."
          [10] "Overall, these geometric and electronic features are very attractive for a dehydrogenation catalyst with excellent catalytic reactivity and stability."

          The structural characteristics of γ-Al2O3 nanosheets with pentacoordinate Al3+ ions enable the effective dispersion and stabilization of raft-like Pt-Sn clusters, resulting in enhanced electronic interactions between Pt and Sn atoms that increase the electron density of the Pt sites. The catalyst exhibits exceptional catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, characterized by high propylene formation selectivity (>99%) and robust anti-coking and anti-sintering properties. Sheet-like nanostructures are advantageous for improving mass transfer and diffusion kinetics, potentially preventing the formation of coke. The catalyst support significantly influences the geometric and electronic structure of active metal phases, optimizing catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. The synthesized Al2O3 nanosheet contains a substantial proportion (27%) of pentacoordinate Al3+ sites, contributing to the formation of Pt-Sn clusters with strong interactions. In contrast, the PtSn/Al2O3ref. catalyst shows weak interactions between Pt and Sn, indicating a different structure and possibly accounting for its inferior performance. The combination of unique geometric and electronic features makes this catalyst highly suitable for dehydrogenation reactions with excellent reactivity and stability.

          [1] "The propane dehydrogenation reaction was investigated under atmospheric pressure at 590C."
          [2] "As shown in Figure3A, the initial conversion of propane on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was 48.7% at a space velocity (WHSV) of 9.4h−1 near equilibrium (50%) in a feed of 16.2kPa C3H8, 20.3kPa H2, and N2 balance."
          [3] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity was as high as 99.1% after a 24h test."
          [4] "On the other hand, for the PtSn/Al2O3 reference catalyst, propane conversion dramatically dropped from an initial 43.8% to 28.3% after 24h."
          [5] "A first-order deactivation model was used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
          [6] "As shown in Figure3B, the best yield at a low kd value clearly demonstrates the superior reactivity and stability of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst in the DHP reaction."
          [7] "The 2D sheet structure might promote diffusion and thereby influence the catalytic behavior in the DHP reaction."
          [8] "When higher space velocities are used, the effects of mass transfer and diffusion on the reaction rate will be more obvious."

          [10] "STEM analysis (Figure4A,B) showed that the size and morphology of Pt-Sn clusters supported on the Al2O3 sheet had undergone negligible changes even after a 24h dehydrogenation reaction, which demonstrates the excellent sintering resistance of this catalyst."
          [11] "The amount (3.7%) of coke deposited on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet was much lower than on the PtSn/Al2O3ref. (7.6%) catalyst."
          [12] "This weak interaction minimizes coke formation of the electron-rich C3H6 on the metal sites of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet during reactions, which therefore remain highly stable under the reaction conditions."
          [13] "Our work has also demonstrated that the sheet construction of the catalyst facilitates mass-transfer and kinetically controlled diffusion processes during propane dehydrogenation."

          The study examined the propane dehydrogenation reaction under atmospheric pressure at 590°C. The initial conversion of propane on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was 48.7% at a space velocity (WHSV) of 9.4 h−1 near equilibrium, with a propylene selectivity of 99.1% after a 24-hour test. In contrast, the PtSn/Al2O3 reference catalyst saw a significant drop in propane conversion, from 43.8% to 28.3% over 24 hours. A first-order deactivation model was employed to assess the catalyst's stability. The PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst demonstrated superior reactivity and stability in the dehydrogenation process, as evidenced by its high yield at a low deactivation rate. The 2D sheet structure may promote diffusion and affect the catalytic behavior in the dehydrogenation reaction. Increased space velocities highlight the importance of mass transfer and diffusion on the reaction rate. The specific activity of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst increased significantly more than that of the PtSn/Al2O3ref. catalyst when the WHSV was raised from 1.9 h−1 to 56.5 h−1. STEM analysis revealed that the size and morphology of Pt-Sn clusters supported on the Al2O3 sheet remained virtually unchanged after 24 hours of dehydrogenation, indicating the catalyst's outstanding sintering resistance. The amount of coke deposited on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet was notably less than on the PtSn/Al2O3ref. catalyst, minimizing coke formation on the metal sites of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet during reactions, thus maintaining high stability under reaction conditions. Our research also confirmed that the sheet construction of the catalyst enhances mass transfer and kinetically controlled diffusion processes during propane dehydrogenation.

          研究在590°C的常压下探讨了丙烷脱氢反应。在空间速度（WHSV）为9.4 h−1接近平衡（50%）的情况下，PtSn/Al2O3薄片催化剂对丙烷的初始转化率为48.7%，测试24小时后的丙烯选择性高达99.1%。相比之下，PtSn/Al2O3参考催化剂的丙烷转化率从43.8%急剧下降至28.3%，历时24小时。使用了一阶失活模型来评估催化剂的稳定性。PtSn/Al2O3薄片催化剂在脱氢反应中表现出卓越的活性和稳定性，其低失活率下的高产率证明了这一点。2D层状结构可能促进扩散并影响脱氢反应的催化行为。提高空间速度强调了质量传递和扩散对反应速率的重要影响。当空间速度（WHSV）从1.9 h−1增加至56.5 h−1时，PtSn/Al2O3薄片催化剂的特定活性显著高于PtSn/Al2O3ref.催化剂。扫描透射电子显微镜（STEM）分析显示，即使经过24小时的脱氢反应，支持在Al2O3片上的Pt-Sn簇的大小和形态几乎未发生变化，这表明该催化剂具有出色的结焦抗性。PtSn/Al2O3片上沉积的焦炭量远少于PtSn/Al2O3ref.催化剂，这最小化了电子丰富的C3H6在PtSn/Al2O3片金属位点上的焦炭形成，因此在反应条件下保持了高度稳定性。我们的研究还证实了催化剂的片状结构在丙烷脱氢过程中促进了质量传递和动力学控制的扩散过程。
