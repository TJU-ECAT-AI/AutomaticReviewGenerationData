The literature does not provide specific details about the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, nor does it evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. Additionally, there is no information regarding the relative effectiveness of these materials for different catalytic applications.

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are considered promising candidates for various catalytic applications due to their distinctive structural features. Incorporation of boron (B) active components into these structures usually involves techniques such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), impregnation, and sol-gel methods. These approaches vary in terms of their efficiency and the degree of control they provide over the distribution and size of the active sites. The presence of 3-D dispersed active sites boosts catalytic performance by increasing surface area and providing more accessible reactive sites for reactants. However, the effectiveness of these methods for different catalytic uses is contingent upon factors including the specific catalyst type, reaction conditions, and desired product yield.
