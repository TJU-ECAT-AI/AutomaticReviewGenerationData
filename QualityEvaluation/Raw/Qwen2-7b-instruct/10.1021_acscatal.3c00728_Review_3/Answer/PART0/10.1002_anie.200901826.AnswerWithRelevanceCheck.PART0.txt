          Analyzing the structural characteristics of boron-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the unique features of these materials enhance their catalytic performance. Boron, when incorporated into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through the use of boron oxide, significantly improves the selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction. This is evidenced by the ability of boron-modified CNTs to selectively convert propane into propene with remarkable efficiency, surpassing the performance of conventional metal oxide catalysts. The porous framework of the CNTs, combined with the 3-D dispersion of the active boron sites, creates a high density of catalytically active sites that are accessible to reactants, thereby enhancing the reaction kinetics and selectivity.

          The incorporation of boron active components into these structures is typically achieved through a process called incipient wetness impregnation, where aqueous solutions of boron compounds are added to the carbon material under controlled conditions. This method allows for the precise loading of boron onto the CNTs, ensuring that the boron is evenly distributed across the porous surface. The effectiveness of this method depends on several factors, including the type of boron compound used, the concentration of the solution, and the drying conditions post-application. Different boron compounds, such as boron oxide or boron phosphate, exhibit varying degrees of effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application, with boron oxide often preferred for its ability to suppress the formation of non-selective oxygen species, thereby improving the overall selectivity of the CNT catalysts.

          Critically evaluating the methods used to incorporate boron active components into porous frameworks reveals that while incipient wetness impregnation is effective for achieving uniform loading, the choice of boron compound plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance. For instance, boron oxide modifies the surface properties of the CNTs, enhancing their stability and selectivity towards propene formation in ODH reactions. The detailed mechanisms underlying these enhancements involve the modification of the surface chemistry, which alters the reactivity pathways and reduces the formation of undesired products. Additionally, the use of isotopic tracer experiments, such as switching between 16O2 and 18O2, demonstrates that the oxygen exchange capabilities of boron-modified CNTs are significantly different from those of unmodified CNTs, indicating a reduction in the formation of electrophilic intermediate oxygen species that could lead to low selectivity. The covalent bonding of boron compounds to the CNT structure, as observed through thermal stability tests, further supports the effectiveness of these modifications in enhancing the catalytic properties of the materials.

          In conclusion, the structural characteristics of boron-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are optimized through strategic incorporation of boron active components, which leads to enhanced catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The effectiveness of this approach is underpinned by the ability of boron compounds to modify the surface chemistry of the materials, improve their stability, and suppress the formation of non-selective oxygen species, thereby achieving high selectivity and efficiency in the desired chemical transformations.

          分析硼基材料在三维分散在多孔框架中的结构特征涉及理解这些材料如何通过其独特的特性增强催化性能。通过将硼氧化物引入碳纳米管（CNT），硼显著提高了氧化脱氢（ODH）反应的选择性。硼改性CNT能够选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，效率极高，超过了传统金属氧化物催化剂的性能。多孔CNT结构与活性硼位点的三维分散相结合，创造了一个高密度的催化活性位点，这些位点对反应物具有高可接近性，从而增强反应动力学和选择性。

          将硼活性成分引入这些结构通常通过一种称为浸渍湿法的方法实现，即在控制条件下向碳材料中添加水溶液的硼化合物。这种方法允许精确地将硼加载到CNT上，确保硼均匀分布在多孔表面。不同硼化合物的使用、溶液浓度以及干燥条件后的影响是影响方法有效性的关键因素。不同的硼化合物，如硼氧化物或硼磷酸盐，在特定催化应用中表现出不同的效果，其中硼氧化物常被优选，因为它能抑制非选择性氧物种的形成，从而提高CNT催化剂的整体选择性。

          对将硼活性成分引入多孔框架的评估揭示了浸渍湿法虽然有效实现了均匀加载，但硼化合物的选择对催化性能具有重要影响。例如，硼氧化物通过修改表面化学性质来改变反应路径，减少不期望产物的形成，从而增强了材料的稳定性和丙烯选择性。这些增强背后的详细机制涉及表面化学的修改，这改变了反应途径并减少了不期望产物的形成。此外，通过同位素示踪实验，如切换16O2与18O2，表明硼改性CNT的氧气交换能力与未改性CNT显著不同，这意味着减少了可能导致低选择性的亲电中间氧物种的形成。通过热稳定性测试观察到的硼化合物与CNT结构之间的共价键进一步支持了这些修改对材料催化性能的有效性提升。

          总之，硼基材料在三维分散在多孔框架中的结构特征通过策略性引入硼活性成分得到优化，这导致了氧化脱氢反应中高选择性和效率的催化性能提升。这种方法的有效性基于硼化合物修改表面化学、改善稳定性并抑制非选择性氧物种形成的原理，从而实现了对所需化学转换的高度选择性和效率。

The presence of boron atoms, acting as Lewis bases, facilitates the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from alkane molecules, forming alkenes. The oxygen functional groups on the surface of these materials are crucial for the activation of oxygen molecules, which are necessary for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The introduction of boron oxide or boron itself into these structures modifies the surface chemistry, leading to enhanced selectivity and stability. The covalent bonding of boron to the carbon nanotube structure ensures durability under reaction conditions, contributing to the long-term stability of the catalyst. The ability of boron to reduce the formation of non-selective oxygen species, such as peroxide or superoxide, further improves the selectivity of the catalytic process. This combination of features makes boron-based materials particularly effective for catalytic applications involving the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional metal oxides.
