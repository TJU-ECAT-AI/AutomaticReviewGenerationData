Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1126/science.abe7935], which synthesizes the BS-1 catalyst using a solvent-free crystallization strategy with tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide at 180°C. The catalyst, after calcination to remove organic templates, exhibits a Si/B ratio of 62 and displays typical MFI structure characteristics as identified by XRD patterns and N2 sorption isotherms. It demonstrates active performance for propane conversion, with 23.8% and 41.4% conversions at 540°C and 560°C, respectively.

        The synthesis and characterization of silica-supported boron oxide catalysts exemplify effective incorporation methods, which are critically evaluated for diverse catalytic applications, showcasing the effectiveness of B-based materials with 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks.

        Vapor-phase deposition techniques effectively integrate B into the framework while maintaining the desired 3-D dispersion, contrasting with chemical vapor infiltration which might offer better control over B distribution but may result in less uniform dispersion. This method is particularly effective for incorporating B active components into structures with high catalytic performance.

        DFT calculations further examine the role of boron in propane oxidative dehydrogenation, highlighting the enhanced catalytic performance due to the unique structural characteristics of B-based materials. The effectiveness of incorporation methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and impregnation, is evaluated for various catalytic applications, demonstrating their relative effectiveness.

        Carbon nanotubes modified by boron oxide catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with remarkable selectivity, showcasing the pivotal role of boron-based materials in catalysis. The modified CNTs are much more selective than a variety of supported vanadia catalysts, further affirming the effectiveness of boron incorporation methods in enhancing catalytic performance.

        Borosilicate zeolites, featuring low crystallinity and 3-D dispersed boron sites, excel in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane due to boron's unique coordination within the zeolite matrix. Solid-state NMR, FTIR, and DRIFT confirm boron anchoring in open coordination, while surface SiOH groups facilitate hydrogen bonding with boron species, stabilizing them against leaching. BOH groups hydrogen bonding with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center, catalyzing reactions efficiently at low temperatures.

        Borosilicate zeolites with homogeneous distribution of boron have been proven as promising catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, with the micro-environment of boron species being the dominant factor for catalytic properties. This highlights the importance of understanding the structural underpinnings of B-based materials for optimized catalytic processes.

        The study aims to comprehensively characterize the nature and distribution of chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane using various spectroscopic techniques. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles. Isolated Cr species on γ-Al2O3 have higher intrinsic activity compared to 1 wt% Cr, whereas for xCrSBA-15, Cr(III) sites with coordination numbers greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3.

        In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites. The origin of active dehydrogenation sites is attributed to chromium(VI) species in coordination, as evidenced by the pre-edge peak in XANES. This underscores the importance of chromium species' structure in enhancing catalytic performance.

        Hollow anatase TiO2 nanospheres, synthesized via the Ostwald ripening process, exhibit a large surface area and efficient dispersion of active sites due to their porous framework.

        The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units adjacent to silanol groups. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. As shown in prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms.

        The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity, highlighting the significance of boron's structural arrangement in enhancing catalytic performance.

        Supported boron oxide catalysts for selective and low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of propane exhibit exceptional selectivity for olefins at high conversion rates due to their 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. The use of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is generally considered more effective for achieving uniform dispersion of boron active components compared to impregnation, optimizing catalyst performance.

        Porous frameworks with 3D dispersed active sites, as utilized in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over a high surface area boron nitride catalyst, show exceptional selectivity for olefins at high conversion rates. The presence of 3D dispersed active sites enhances catalytic performance, and boron nitride catalysts stand out due to their high surface area and effectiveness. Various methods for incorporating boron active components into these structures are explored, demonstrating their relative effectiveness across different catalytic applications.

        The different PtSn alloy compositions on the catalysts influence the coke mobility, with the addition of tin as a promoter apparently lessening coke formation. With the Al2O3 support, the coke contents were 4.1 and 6.1 wt%, whereas the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst generated only 2.5 and 4.9 wt% coke. The high catalytic stability of PtSn/ZnAl2O4 originates from the relatively faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support, as confirmed by XPS measurements.

        Large-scale production of high-quality two-dimensional materials suitable for advanced electronic devices was achieved by synthesizing hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films using unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a seed, leveraging its sp3 edges to facilitate atomically flat h-BN formation on a c-Al2O3 substrate. This method enables large-scale production of high-quality two-dimensional materials, offering significant improvements over conventional methods in terms of catalytic performance.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/0926-860X(95)00273-1\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.apcata.2011.03.057\], \[10.1021/acscatal.9b04558\], and \[10.1126/science.abe7935\]. These materials demonstrate enhanced catalytic performance due to their unique structural characteristics, specifically the presence of boron (B) in 3-D dispersed active sites within porous frameworks. The incorporation of B active components into these structures was achieved through various methods, including vapor-phase deposition and chemical vapor infiltration. For different catalytic applications, the effectiveness of these methods varied significantly, highlighting the importance of method selection for optimal performance.

        The different PtSn alloy compositions on the catalysts influenced the coke mobility. The addition of tin (Sn) as a promoter apparently lessened the coke formation. With aluminum oxide (Al2O3) as the support, the coke contents were 4.1 and 6.1 wt%, whereas the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst generated only 2.5 and 4.9 wt% coke. The high catalytic stability of PtSn/ZnAl2O4 originates from the relatively faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support, making coke transport from metallic sites to the support easier on PtSn/ZnAlO compared to PtSn/Al.

        The coordination environment plays a crucial role in determining the activity and stability of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts. Incorporation methods vary in effectiveness, with vapor-phase deposition offering precise 3-D dispersion while chemical vapor infiltration provides better control over B distribution, albeit with less uniformity. The BS-1 catalyst, synthesized via a solvent-free crystallization process, exhibited an MFI structure and showed increasing propane conversion with temperature, reaching 23.8% and 41.4% at 540°C and 560°C, respectively. Post-treatment retained its activity, demonstrating its robustness and versatility.

        The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days. By calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 with an Si/B ratio of 62 was obtained. BS-1 catalyst was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibiting typical characteristics in its MFI structure. It was active for the reaction, giving propane conversion with increasing reaction temperature. For example, 23.8 and 41.4% of propane conversions were realized on the BS-1 catalyst at 540°C and 560°C, respectively.

        Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce 10 vol% water in the gas. The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated investigation of its structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which revealed a strong peak at 3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework. The two-dimensional (2D) 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provided insights into the spatial proximities between B and H species.

        Analyzing boron-based materials with 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances oxidative dehydrogenation selectivity, particularly when boron oxide modifies carbon nanotubes (CNTs), enabling the selective conversion of propane to propene. Incorporation methods, like incipient wetness impregnation, allow for uniform boron loading, with boron oxide proving effective for high selectivity and stability. Comparisons with other catalysts, such as supported vanadia, highlight boron oxide's superior performance in suppressing non-selective oxygen species.

        Borosilicate zeolites, particularly those with low crystallinity, excel in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to their unique boron species anchoring in open coordination within the zeolite matrix. Surface SiOH groups aid in forming hydrogen bonds with BOH in defective boron species, preventing boron leaching. Active boron centers, identified as BOH groups in aggregated BOx species hydrogen-bonded to adjacent SiOH groups, catalyze ODHP efficiently at low temperatures. Homogeneous boron distribution enhances catalytic properties, making borosilicate zeolites promising catalysts.

        The study aims to comprehensively characterize the nature and distribution of chromium species in chromium (Cr)-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane using various spectroscopic techniques. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles.

            The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site.

The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature. Borosilicate zeolites with homogeneous distribution of boron have been proved as the promising catalyst in ODHP reaction and the micro-environment of boron species is the dominant factor for the catalytic properties.

            Analyzing B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals how these features significantly enhance catalytic performance, thanks to their structural characteristics. Incorporating B active components through effective methods is vital for diverse catalytic applications. Quotes affirm the role of BO oligomers or ring species in AlB2 for selectivity in propane oxidative dehydrogenation, underscoring the importance of structural features and incorporation techniques in catalysis.

            Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers. The catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited excellent catalytic efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. A combination of solid-state NMR, dual-beam FTIR, and in-situ DRIFT measurements reveal that the boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in the form of open coordination. Meanwhile, the ample SiOH groups on the surface facilitate the formation of hydrogen bonds with the BOH in defective boron species and inhibit the excessive leaching of boron. The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature. Borosilicate zeolites with homogeneous distribution of boron have been proved as the promising catalyst in ODHP reaction and the micro-environment of boron species is the dominant factor for the catalytic properties.

            B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit unique structural characteristics that significantly enhance catalytic performance by increasing surface area and improving reactant accessibility. Key to this advantage is the 3-D dispersion within the porous structure, which optimizes contact between the catalyst and reactants. Incorporation methods vary depending on the specific catalytic application, emphasizing the adaptability of these materials for diverse industrial processes.
