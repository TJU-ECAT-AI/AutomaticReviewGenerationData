This catalyst's durability and high propane conversion even under conditions producing up to 10 vol% water underscore the importance of structural characteristics in B-based materials for catalytic applications.

            The 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy of the fresh BS-1 catalyst reveals the presence of tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site, providing insights into the spatial relationships between boron and hydrogen species. The two-dimensional (2D) 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 offers further understanding of the spatial proximity between B and H species. The findings suggest that the unique structural characteristics of B-based materials, particularly the 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, significantly contribute to their enhanced catalytic performance.

            Borosilicate zeolites, featuring low crystallinity and 3D dispersed boron sites, excel in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane due to boron's unique coordination within the zeolite matrix. Solid-state NMR, FTIR, and DRIFT confirm boron anchoring in open coordination, with surface SiOH groups facilitating hydrogen bonding with boron species to stabilize them against leaching. Active boron centers, identified as BOH groups hydrogen bonding with SiOH, catalyze reactions efficiently at low temperatures.

            The study of chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane using various spectroscopic techniques reveals that isolated Cr species on γ-Al2O3 have higher intrinsic activity compared to 1 wt% Cr. For xCrSBA-15, Cr(III) sites with coordination numbers over four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites. The origin of active dehydrogenation sites is attributed to chromium(VI) species in coordination, as evidenced by the pre-edge peak in XANES.

            Hollow anatase TiO2 nanospheres, synthesized through the Ostwald ripening process, achieve a large surface area and efficient dispersion of active sites through their porous framework. Boron (B) components are incorporated through a co-precipitation method, and the materials are prepared using a modified sol-gel process, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.

            Detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy shows that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and other boron materials leads to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity.

            Supported boron oxide catalysts for selective and low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of propane exhibit exceptional selectivity for olefins at high conversion rates. The use of 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance due to increased surface area and improved mass transfer properties. Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures are critical for different catalytic applications, with chemical vapor deposition generally considered more effective for achieving uniform dispersion compared to impregnation.
