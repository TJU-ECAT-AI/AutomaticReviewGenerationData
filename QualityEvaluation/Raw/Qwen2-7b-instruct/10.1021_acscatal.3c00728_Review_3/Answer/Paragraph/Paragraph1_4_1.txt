            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/acscatal.2c04889\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1002/anie.200901826\], \[10.1021/acs.oprd.8b00301\], and \[10.1002/anie.201507119\]. The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance, per quote [10.1021/acscatal.2c04889]. Incorporating B active components into these structures, as discussed in quote [10.1002/anie.200901826], is critical for various catalytic applications. This approach, combining structural insights with effective incorporation methods, optimizes catalytic efficiency. B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, by improving selectivity. Incorporating boron into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via incipient wetness impregnation optimizes their surface chemistry, making them highly effective catalysts. Boron oxide, compared to boron phosphate, exhibits superior selectivity in converting propane to propene. This is attributed to its ability to suppress non-selective oxygen species formation, enhancing the overall catalytic properties of the CNTs. The effectiveness of boron incorporation is critical for achieving high selectivity and efficiency in desired chemical transformations. B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit unique structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance through increased surface area and improved reactant accessibility. Key to this is the ability to incorporate B active components effectively for various catalytic applications, as evidenced by the quotes which highlight the benefits of these materials. B-based materials featuring 3-D dispersed active sites within porous frameworks, significantly boosting their catalytic efficiency, as stated in reference \[10.1021/jacsau.1c00542\]. These materials demonstrate enhanced catalytic performance due to their unique structural characteristics, as noted in the quotes. B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit enhanced catalytic performance due to improved active site distribution. Incorporation of B components was achieved through various methods, differing in effectiveness for specific catalytic applications, as highlighted by the study. Hollow anatase TiO2 nanospheres were synthesized through the Ostwald ripening process, achieving a porous framework that provides a supportive structure for the catalysts. Boron (B) active components were incorporated into the TiO2 nanospheres using a co-precipitation method, ensuring the materials' preparation with a modified sol-gel process. The quotes emphasize the synthesis method and hollow structure's achievement, underscoring the significance of these features in catalytic applications. A novel approach to the synthesis of antiexfoliating h-BNIn2O3 catalysts is presented, combining the high-temperature stability of h-BN and the catalytic activity of In2O3. The catalyst exhibits excellent oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) activity towards propane under high-temperature and water-rich conditions. The structure of the catalyst consists of three-dimensional (3D) dispersed active sites embedded within a porous framework, facilitating efficient mass transfer and reaction kinetics. B-based materials with 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance due to their unique structural characteristics, facilitating efficient mass transfer and reaction kinetics. A two-step process, involving the formation of a B-containing precursor followed by thermal treatment, effectively incorporates B active components, demonstrating broad applicability across various catalytic applications. Analyzing boron-based materials with 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals their catalytic superiority, especially in borosilicate zeolites with low crystallinity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Solid-state NMR, dual-beam FTIR, and in-situ DRIFT measurements confirm boron species anchored in open coordination within the zeolite matrix. Surface SiOH groups facilitate hydrogen bonding with BOH in defective boron species, inhibiting boron leaching. Aggregated BOx species with BOH groups hydrogen bonding to adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center for low-temperature ODHP reactions. Homogeneous boron distribution in borosilicate zeolites is critical for catalytic properties, with the micro-environment of boron species dominating catalytic effects. Research analyzed PtSn bimetallic alloys' impact on catalyst stability, highlighting tin's role in reducing coke formation. PtSn/ZnAl2O4 showed superior stability due to faster coke mobility from metal surfaces to the support, confirmed by XPS measurements. The PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst accumulated less coke than PtSn/Al, facilitating easier transport of coke from metallic sites to the support. This study underscores the importance of alloy composition and support choice in enhancing catalytic performance and stability. The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity. BS-1, synthesized via a solvent-free crystallization process involving tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, exhibits typical MFI structure characteristics and shows enhanced catalytic performance, converting propane with increasing temperature. For instance, at 540°C and 560°C, propane conversions of 23.8% and 41.4% were recorded, respectively. The catalyst's durability was confirmed in a continuous oxidative dehydrogenation of propane test, achieving high conversion rates even when producing up to 10 vol% water in the gas. Insights into the spatial relationships between boron and hydrogen species were gained through 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy, identifying a strong peak at 3.9 ppm attributed to tetracoordinated boron at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework. Supported Boron Oxide Catalysts for Selective and Low-Temperature Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane highlights the use of 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhancing the catalytic performance due to increased surface area and improved mass transfer properties. B-based materials have been successfully incorporated into various porous structures through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and impregnation methods. CVD is generally considered more effective for achieving uniform dispersion of boron active components compared to impregnation, thus optimizing catalyst efficiency. DFT calculations on B2O3-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation of propane substantiate the structural analysis and catalytic benefits. Analyzing B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals enhanced catalytic performance due to improved coordination environments. Vapor-phase deposition effectively integrates B while maintaining dispersion, contrasting with chemical vapor infiltration, which offers better control over the B distribution but may result in less uniform dispersion. The synthesis and characterization of silica-supported boron oxide catalysts exemplify effective incorporation methods, with their relative effectiveness critically evaluated for diverse catalytic applications. B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are utilized as high surface area boron nitride catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, showing exceptional selectivity for olefins at high conversion rates. These catalysts feature 3-D dispersed active sites within porous frameworks, enabling efficient catalysis. Various methods for incorporating boron active components into these structures are explored, with their effectiveness evaluated for different catalytic applications, highlighting the materials' versatility and adaptability.
