Surface SiOH groups facilitate hydrogen bonding with BOH in defective boron species, inhibiting boron leaching. Aggregated BOx species with BOH groups hydrogen bonding to adjacent SiOH groups act as the active center for low-temperature ODHP reactions. Homogeneous boron distribution plays a critical role in determining catalytic properties, with the micro-environment of boron species being the dominant factor. Quotes support these findings, emphasizing the importance of boron's role in catalysis and the effectiveness of borosilicate zeolites as catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017"},

The addition of tin as a promoter facilitates faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support, as evidenced by XPS measurements.
