            The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance. These features, such as increased surface area, efficient mass transfer, and optimal reactivity, contribute to the materials' superior catalytic activity. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through various methods, including synthesis, impregnation, and covalent attachment, each with its own relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications.

            For instance, the BS-1 catalyst, synthesized with tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide, exhibits a Si/B ratio of 62 after calcination, displaying typical MFI structure features. It shows active conversion of propane with increasing efficiency, achieving up to 41.4% conversion at 560°C. Further evaluation confirms its durability even under conditions producing up to 10 vol% water. The 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy reveals the presence of tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site, providing insights into the spatial relationships between boron and hydrogen species.

            The study of h-BNIn2O3 catalysts demonstrates the combination of high-temperature stability of h-BN and the catalytic activity of In2O3, showing excellent oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) activity towards propane under challenging conditions. The catalyst's structure consists of 3D dispersed active sites embedded within a porous framework, facilitating efficient mass transfer and reaction kinetics.

            The unique structural characteristics of B-based materials, such as their 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, significantly enhance catalytic performance due to their high surface area, efficient mass transfer, and optimal reactivity. Incorporation methods vary, including impregnation, ion exchange, and covalent attachment, each with its own relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications.

            Different methods were employed to incorporate B active components into various B-based materials, demonstrating broad applicability across different catalytic applications. For example, the synthesis of stable, active h-BNIn2O3 catalysts through a novel approach combining the high-temperature stability of h-BN and the catalytic activity of In2O3 showcases the potential of these materials in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

            The 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks of B-based materials significantly improve catalytic activity, as evidenced by studies highlighting the dynamic self-dispersion of boron clusters on MFI zeolite nanosheets, which indicates the potential of these materials in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

Incorporation methods vary, differing in effectiveness across different catalytic applications. Key insights come from studies confirming the dynamic self-dispersion of boron clusters on MFI zeolite nanosheets, highlighting the potential of these materials in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

            Engineering boron species in boron nitrous nanotubes increases olefins for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is crucial for enhancing catalytic performance. The 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks of B-based materials significantly improve catalytic activity, and various methods for boron component integration exist, each optimized for specific catalytic applications.

            The presence of BOH groups on h-BN and BNNT surfaces enhances catalytic performance in ODH reactions, acting as active sites. Inert intact boron nitrides become active through in situ surface functionalization, correlating catalytic activity with oxygenated species. Structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst reveals numerous accessible edges and lattice relaxations/distortions at the edges, contributing to enhanced catalytic activity. Carbon nanotubes demonstrate improved performance in converting light alkanes, achieving higher yields compared to traditional catalysts.

            The importance of the crystallinity of a carbon-based catalyst in the ODH of light alkanes was further confirmed by employing carbon nanotubes to convert 1-butylene and obtaining a 40% butadiene yield, superior to that of activated carbon and iron oxide. The presence of BOH groups facilitates the dehydrogenation of reactants by O2, generating BNO and HO2 radicals, initiating gas phase radical chemistry.

            γ-Al2O3 nanosheets rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can nicely disperse and stabilize raft-like Pt-Sn clusters as a result of strong interactions between metal and support. Consequently, there are strong electronic interactions between the Pt and Sn atoms, resulting in an increase in the electron density of the Pt sites. When used in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, this catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity, and superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties.

            Sheet-like nanoarchitectures are an ideal choice for improving the mass-transfer and diffusion kinetics, which can in principle inhibit the secondary reaction that generates coke. The catalyst support plays a crucial role in modulating the geometric and electronic structure of active metal phases for optimizing the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. The presence of a large percentage (27%) of pentacoordinate Al3+ sites in the synthesized Al2O3 nanosheet contributes to the formation of highly dispersed and stabilized Pt-Sn clusters on its surface. This unique structure accounts for the formation of the highly dispersed and stabilized Pt-Sn clusters on its surface.

            Overall, these geometric and electronic features are very attractive for a dehydrogenation catalyst with excellent catalytic reactivity and stability. The synthesis and characterization of silica-supported boron oxide catalysts exemplify effective incorporation methods, which are critically evaluated for diverse catalytic applications.

            Analyzing B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals their enhanced catalytic performance due to the coordination environment's role in activity and stability. Vapor-phase deposition effectively integrates B components while preserving desired dispersion, contrasting with chemical vapor infiltration which offers better control over B distribution but may lead to less uniform dispersion.

            The study utilized DFT calculations to examine B2O3's role in propane oxidative dehydrogenation, highlighting the enhanced catalytic performance due to 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks that increase surface area and improve reactant access.

            Borosilicate zeolites, featuring low crystallinity and 3-D dispersed boron sites, excel in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to boron's unique coordination within the zeolite matrix. Solid-state NMR, FTIR, and DRIFT confirm boron anchoring in open coordination. Surface SiOH groups facilitate hydrogen bonding with boron species, stabilizing them against leaching.

            The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature. Borosilicate zeolites with homogeneous distribution of boron have been proved as the promising catalyst in ODHP reaction and the micro-environment of boron species is the dominant factor for the catalytic properties.

            The study of hollow anatase TiO2 nanospheres via Ostwald ripening shows that the incorporation of boron (B) active components into TiO2 nanospheres was accomplished through a co-precipitation method. The hollow structure was achieved due to the Ostwald ripening process, leading to a porous framework. These materials exhibited enhanced catalytic performance due to the large surface area provided by the porous framework and the dispersion of active sites.

            The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels.

            As was shown here and in prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity.

            Supported boron oxide catalysts for selective and low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of propane demonstrate exceptional selectivity for olefins at high conversion rates. Porous frameworks with 3-D dispersed active sites enhance catalytic performance, and boron nitride catalysts stand out due to their high surface area and effectiveness. Various methods for incorporating boron active components into these structures are explored, demonstrating their relative effectiveness across different catalytic applications.

            The use of 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances the catalytic performance of B-based materials due to increased surface area and improved mass transfer properties. B-based materials have been successfully incorporated into various porous structures through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and impregnation methods, with CVD generally considered more effective for achieving uniform dispersion of boron active components compared to impregnation.

            Different PtSn alloy compositions on the catalysts influenced the coke mobility, with the addition of Sn as a promoter apparently lessening the coke formation. The high catalytic stability of PtSn/ZnAl2O4 originates from the relatively faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support. The amount of coke accumulated on the PtSn/ZnAlO was slightly less than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst, and the transport of the coke from metallic sites to the support on PtSn/ZnAlO became easier than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst.

            Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films were synthesized using unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a seed, leveraging its sp3 edges to facilitate atomically flat h-BN formation on a c-Al2O3 substrate. This method enables large-scale production of high-quality two-dimensional materials suitable for advanced electronic devices. The synthesis process, highlighted by the role of nc-G's edges, results in enhanced catalytic performance due to the 3-D dispersed active sites in the porous framework, offering significant improvements over conventional methods.

            The team successfully synthesized B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, significantly boosting their catalytic efficiency. These materials feature 3-D dispersed active sites within porous frameworks, which significantly boost their catalytic efficiency.
