        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/acscatal.2c04889\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\], \[10.1021/acscatal.9b04558\], \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b07429\], and \[10.1016/0926-860X(95)00273-1\]. Remarkably, B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance due to their structural characteristics. Incorporating B active components into these structures through specific methods is critical for optimizing catalytic applications. The coordination environment significantly influences the activity and selectivity of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts, as seen in reference \[10.1021/acscatal.9b04558\]. For instance, vapor-phase deposition techniques can effectively integrate B into the framework while maintaining the desired 3-D dispersion, compared to chemical vapor infiltration, which might offer better control over the B distribution but may result in less uniform dispersion, as discussed in \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\].

        The study highlights the development of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, as evidenced by reference \[10.1016/0926-860X(95)00273-1\]. These materials demonstrate enhanced catalytic performance due to their unique structural characteristics, allowing for better active site distribution and efficiency in catalytic reactions. Incorporation methods vary, differing in effectiveness for different catalytic applications, as noted in \[10.1016/0926-860X(95)00273-1\].

        Analyzing B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals their enhanced catalytic performance due to isolated boron species like BO3 units effectively dispersed within the structure, as elucidated by spectroscopic techniques in reference \[10.1002/anie.201914696\]. The quotes highlight that while B-MWW has sufficient boron for catalysis, it lacks restructuring under reaction conditions, unlike aggregated boron sites in other materials. This suggests that for boron-catalyzed reactions, a degree of B-O-B connectivity might be essential for activity.

        B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit superior catalytic performance due to their ability to efficiently interact with reactants, boosting conversion rates and selectivity, as detailed in reference \[10.1021/acscatal.8b00301\]. Key incorporation methods include impregnation, solvothermal synthesis, and sonochemical methods, with effectiveness varying based on specific applications and desired product properties.

        The team successfully synthesized B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, significantly enhancing catalytic efficiency, as documented in reference \[10.1021/jacsau.1c00542\]. These features boost performance, making them effective for various uses. The structural characteristics play a pivotal role in catalytic efficiency, and the adaptability of B component integration techniques allows for optimization tailored to specific applications.

        The text explores B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, optimized for catalytic applications through DFT calculations. Enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to increased surface area and improved reactant access, as outlined in reference \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c07690\]. Incorporation methods, including chemical vapor deposition and impregnation, are effective for specific applications, impacting the final product's desired properties.

        Engineering boron species in these materials is crucial, and their incorporation through various methods affects catalytic efficiency differently based on specific applications, as highlighted in reference \[10.1021/jacs.1c13563\].
