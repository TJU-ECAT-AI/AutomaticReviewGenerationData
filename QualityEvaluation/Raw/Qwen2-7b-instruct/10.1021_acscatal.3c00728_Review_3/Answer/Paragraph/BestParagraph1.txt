Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1002/anie.200901826], the work [10.1021/jacs.1c13563], and [10.1021/acs.oprd.8b00301]. The synthesized comprehension stemming from these references underscores the pivotal role of boron-based materials with three-dimensional (3D) dispersed active sites in porous frameworks in enhancing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) performance, particularly through boron oxide modification of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This method, involving incipient wetness impregnation, ensures uniform boron loading but varies in effectiveness based on the boron compound used. Boron oxide specifically improves selectivity, making boron-modified CNTs more efficient than conventional catalysts. Key quotes from these references underscore the enhanced selectivity and the mechanism behind boron's effect on the CNT surface chemistry, demonstrating its superiority in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions compared to other catalysts like vanadia. 

        The structural characteristics of these materials, such as their high surface area and efficient mass transfer properties, significantly enhance catalytic performance. They enable efficient interaction between reactants and catalysts, enhancing conversion rates and selectivity of the reactions. The incorporation of boron active components into these structures can be achieved through various methods, including impregnation, solvothermal synthesis, and sonochemical methods. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application and the desired properties of the final product.

        The influence of reactor parameters on the boron nitride-catalyzed ODH of propane is also a crucial aspect, with boron nitride materials showing excellent catalytic performance due to their ability to facilitate efficient reactant-catalyst interactions. The study confirms the potential of these materials in various chemical processes, emphasizing the need for further exploration of their catalytic advantages and the development of new incorporation methods for different applications.
