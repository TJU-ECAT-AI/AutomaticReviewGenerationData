It found that γ-Al2O3 primarily contained oligomers with varying nuclearity and a fraction of isolated Cr species, with higher intrinsic activity than 1 wt% Cr on γ-Al2O3. For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination numbers greater than four were more active, selective, and stable compared to Cr sites on crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, oligomeric Cr species on xCrAl2O3 were more active and selective than isolated Cr sites. The origin of active dehydrogenation sites is attributed to chromium(VI) species in coordination, as indicated by the pre-edge peak in XANES.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014"},
