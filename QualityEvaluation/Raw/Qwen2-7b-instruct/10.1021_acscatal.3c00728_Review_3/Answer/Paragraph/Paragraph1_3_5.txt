        The synthesis and analysis of boron-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks have significantly advanced the field of catalysis, particularly in the context of propane dehydrogenation. These materials showcase enhanced catalytic performance attributed to their structural characteristics, which include a high surface area, efficient mass transfer, and optimal reactivity.

        A prime example is the BS-1 catalyst, synthesized via a solvent-free crystallization process with tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide at 180°C. After calcination in air, it exhibits a Si/B ratio of 62 and displays typical MFI structure features, as characterized by XRD patterns and N2 sorption isotherms. The catalyst is active at higher temperatures, with propane conversion rates reaching up to 41.4% at 560°C. Notably, its durability is maintained even after equivalent treatment, as evidenced by consistent high propane conversion rates in a continuous oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process.

        Further investigation into the structure of the BS-1 catalyst using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy revealed the presence of tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework, providing insights into the spatial relationships between boron and hydrogen species. This finding underscores the catalytic advantages of 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials.

        Another notable study involved the synthesis of stable, active h-BNIn2O3 catalysts, which combine the high-temperature stability of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and the catalytic activity of indium oxide (In2O3). This catalyst exhibits excellent oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) activity towards propane under high-temperature and water-rich conditions. The structure of the catalyst consists of three-dimensional (3D) dispersed active sites embedded within a porous framework, facilitating efficient mass transfer and reaction kinetics.

        The incorporation of boron active components into these structures was achieved through a two-step process, first forming a boron-containing precursor, followed by thermal treatment to convert it into the final catalyst. This method proved effective for incorporating boron active components into various B-based materials, demonstrating broad applicability across different catalytic applications.

        B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks have been shown to significantly enhance catalytic performance due to their unique structural characteristics. Incorporation methods such as impregnation, ion exchange, and covalent attachment vary in effectiveness for different applications, as evidenced by studies on the dynamic self-dispersion of aggregated boron clusters on MFI zeolite nanosheets, highlighting the potential of these materials in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

        Key insights from these studies suggest that the presence of BOH groups on h-BN and boron nitrous nanotubes (BNNT) surfaces enhances catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, acting as active sites. Inert intact boron nitrides become active through in situ surface functionalization, correlating catalytic activity with the presence of oxygenated species. Structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst reveals numerous accessible edges and lattice relaxations/distortions at the edges, contributing to enhanced catalytic activity.

        Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been employed as a catalyst support, demonstrating improved performance in converting light alkanes, achieving higher yields compared to traditional catalysts. The presence of BOH groups facilitates the dehydrogenation of reactants by oxygen, generating BNO and HO2 radicals, initiating gas phase radical chemistry.

        γ-Al2O3 nanosheets rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can nicely disperse and stabilize raft-like Pt-Sn clusters, leading to strong electronic interactions between metal and support. This catalyst displays an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity, along with superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties. Sheet-like nanoarchitectures are ideal for improving mass-transfer and diffusion kinetics, which can inhibit the secondary reaction that generates coke.

        The catalyst support plays a crucial role in modulating the geometric and electronic structure of active metal phases for optimizing catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. The Al2O3 nanosheet synthesized in this work contains a large percentage (27%) of pentacoordinate Al3+ sites, contributing to the formation of highly dispersed and stabilized Pt-Sn clusters on its surface.

        Analyzing silica-supported boron oxide catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane reveals the enhanced catalytic performance due to 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks that increase surface area and improve reactant access. Incorporation methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and impregnation, are effective for various catalytic applications, with their efficacy depending on the specific use and desired product properties.

        DFT calculations have been employed to examine the role of boron oxide (B2O3) in propane oxidative dehydrogenation, highlighting the enhanced catalytic performance due to the 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks that increase surface area and improve reactant access. The coordination environment plays a crucial role in determining the activity and stability of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts, with vapor-phase deposition techniques effectively integrating boron components while maintaining the desired 3-D dispersion.

        In a comparative study of the catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, boron oxide-modified carbon nanotubes (xB-oCNTs) have been shown to have superior selectivity towards propene formation than pristine and oxidized carbon nanotubes. The modified CNTs are much more selective than a variety of supported vanadia catalysts, demonstrating the effectiveness of boron modification in enhancing catalytic performance.

        Borosilicate zeolites, featuring low crystallinity and 3-D dispersed boron sites, excel in oxidative dehydrogenation processes due to boron's unique coordination within the zeolite matrix. Solid-state NMR, FTIR, and DRIFT measurements confirm boron anchoring in open coordination. Surface SiOH groups facilitate hydrogen bonding with boron species, stabilizing them against leaching. Active boron centers, identified as BOH groups hydrogen bonding with SiOH, catalyze reactions efficiently at low temperatures.

        The study aims to comprehensively characterize the nature and distribution of chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane using various spectroscopic techniques. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles. Isolated Cr species on γ-Al2O3 have higher intrinsic activity compared to 1 wt% Cr. For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination numbers greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3.

        Hollow anatase TiO2 nanospheres, synthesized via the Ostwald ripening process, provide a large surface area and efficient dispersion of active sites, enhancing catalytic performance. Boron components are incorporated through a co-precipitation method, and the materials are prepared using a modified sol-gel process. The porous framework and dispersed active sites lead to improved catalytic activity.

        Detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. As shown in prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms.

        Supported boron oxide catalysts for selective and low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of propane have been developed. The use of 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance due to increased surface area and improved mass transfer properties. Various methods for incorporating boron active components into these structures have been explored, demonstrating their relative effectiveness across different catalytic applications.

        B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are used as catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, showing exceptional selectivity for olefins at high conversion rates. The presence of 3-D dispersed active sites enhances catalytic performance, and boron nitride catalysts stand out due to their high surface area and effectiveness. Various methods for incorporating boron active components into these structures are examined, demonstrating their relative effectiveness across different catalytic applications.

        Comparing BO oligomers or ring species in AlB2 for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance. Incorporating boron active components through effective methods optimizes their use.

        The different PtSn alloy compositions on the catalysts influenced the coke mobility, with the addition of tin as a promoter apparently lessening coke formation. The high catalytic stability of PtSn/ZnAl2O4 originates from the relatively faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support. The amount of coke accumulated on the PtSn/ZnAlO was slightly less than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst, and the transport of the coke from metallic sites to the support on PtSn/ZnAlO became easier than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst.

        Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films were synthesized using unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a seed, leveraging its sp3 edges to facilitate atomically flat h-BN formation on a c-Al2O3 substrate. This method enables large-scale production of high-quality two-dimensional materials suitable for advanced electronic devices. The synthesis process, highlighted by the role of nc-G's edges, results in enhanced catalytic performance due to the 3-D dispersed active sites in the porous framework, offering significant improvements over conventional methods.

        A team successfully synthesized B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, showcasing enhanced catalytic efficiency. Their success validates the effectiveness of these materials in catalytic applications, backed by expert research.

        Overall, the integration of boron-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks represents a significant advancement in the field of catalysis, offering enhanced performance in propane dehydrogenation and other catalytic applications. The strategic incorporation of boron components through various methods and the optimization of material structure contribute to the development of highly efficient catalysts for a range of industrial processes.
