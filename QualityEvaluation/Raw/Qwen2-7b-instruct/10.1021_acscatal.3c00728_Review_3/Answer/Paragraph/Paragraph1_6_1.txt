        A study analyzes chromium species in catalysts for propane dehydrogenation using techniques like nitrogen physisorption, XRD, UV-Raman spectroscopy, STEMEDXS, and XAS. It finds that γ-Al2O3 contains oligomers and isolated Cr species, with isolated Cr sites having higher intrinsic activity than those on γ-Al2O3. In xCrSBA-15, Cr(III) sites with coordination numbers >4 show superior activity, selectivity, and stability compared to Cr sites on crystalline Cr2O3. Conversely, oligomeric Cr species on xCrAl2O3 are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites. The study concludes that active dehydrogenation sites likely originate from chromium(VI) species, as indicated by the pre-edge peak in XANES, suggesting the importance of coordination in determining catalytic performance.

        Analyzing B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals enhanced catalytic performance due to their unique structural characteristics. The coordination environment significantly influences the activity and selectivity of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts. Incorporation methods vary, with vapor-phase deposition effectively integrating B while maintaining 3-D dispersion, compared to chemical vapor infiltration, which offers better control over B distribution but may result in less uniform dispersion.

        Silica-supported boron oxide catalysts exemplify effective incorporation methods, evaluated for their relative effectiveness in diverse catalytic applications. Vapor-phase deposition techniques can effectively integrate B into the framework while maintaining the desired 3-D dispersion. Chemical vapor infiltration might offer better control over the B distribution but may result in less uniform dispersion.

        The synthesis and characterization of silica-supported boron oxide catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane highlight the effectiveness of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. Incorporation methods, such as impregnation, solvothermal synthesis, and sonochemical methods, are discussed, with their effectiveness varying significantly for different catalytic applications.

        PtSn catalysts, with tin as a promoter, reduce coke formation, enhancing stability. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst shows superior stability due to faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support. Compared to PtSn/Al, the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst accumulates slightly less coke, making coke transport easier than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst. This highlights the importance of the Al2O3 support in enhancing catalytic performance.

        The development of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals their enhanced catalytic performance due to their unique structural characteristics, allowing for better active site distribution and efficiency in catalytic reactions. Incorporation methods vary, differing in effectiveness for different catalytic applications. Key insights include the study's development of these materials, their demonstrated performance improvements, and the use of various methods to integrate B active components, with effectiveness varying based on specific catalytic needs.

        Detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy shows that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. As shown here and in prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. This suggests that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site but rather requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity.

        B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit superior catalytic performance due to their ability to efficiently interact with reactants, boosting conversion rates and selectivity. Key incorporation methods include impregnation, solvothermal synthesis, and sonochemical methods, with effectiveness varying based on specific applications and desired product properties, as highlighted in 'The Influence of Reactor Parameters on the Boron Nitride-Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane'.

        B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit enhanced catalytic performance due to their high surface area, efficient mass transfer, and optimal reactivity. Methods for incorporating boron active components into these structures vary, including impregnation, solvothermal synthesis, and sonochemical methods, each with its own relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications.

        Supported boron oxide catalysts for selective and low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of propane emphasize the role of 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks in enhancing catalytic performance. Incorporation through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers superior uniform dispersion of boron components compared to impregnation, optimizing catalyst efficiency.

        Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films were synthesized using unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a seed, enabling the creation of atomically flat surfaces comparable to exfoliated single-crystal h-BN. This method facilitates the preparation of high-quality two-dimensional materials suitable for advanced electronic devices.

        B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit unique structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance through increased surface area and better reactant access. Incorporation methods vary, but effective strategies ensure optimal performance tailored to specific catalytic needs.

        Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), providing an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers. The catalysts with low crystallinity exhibit excellent catalytic efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Solid-state NMR, dual-beam FTIR, and in-situ DRIFT measurements reveal that the boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in the form of open coordination. Surface SiOH groups facilitate the formation of hydrogen bonds with BOH in defective boron species and inhibit the excessive leaching of boron. Aggregated BOx species with BOH groups hydrogen bonding to adjacent SiOH groups serve as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature. Homogeneous boron distribution in borosilicate zeolites is critical for catalytic properties, with the micro-environment of boron species being the dominant factor for the catalytic properties.

        γ-Al2O3 nanosheets rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can nicely disperse and stabilize raft-like Pt-Sn clusters as a result of strong interactions between metal and support. Consequently, there are strong electronic interactions between the Pt and Sn atoms, resulting in an increase in the electron density of the Pt sites. When used in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, this catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity, and superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties. Sheet-like nanoarchitectures are an ideal choice for improving the mass-transfer and diffusion kinetics, which can in principle inhibit the secondary reaction that generates coke. The catalyst support plays a crucial role in modulating the geometric and electronic structure of active metal phases for optimizing the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability.

        Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modified by boron oxide catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with remarkable selectivity. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over functionalized CNTs is evaluated with pristine CNTs, oxidized CNTs, and boron oxide modified CNTs. The surface of carbon materials is usually terminated by a variety of oxygen functional groups, which claim an important role in many research areas. Samples with boron oxide and phosphorus oxide have a superior selectivity towards propene formation than pristine CNTs and oCNTs. The modified CNTs are much more selective than a variety of supported vanadia catalysts. The N2 physisorption results show a general rise in surface area and in particular within the <5nm sized pores, indicating a strong impact of the opening of closed carbon nanotubes at their ends by gas-phase oxygen during the ODH reaction. In contrast, B2O3-modified CNTs deactivate to a small extent initially, which may be due to the decomposition or thermal spreading of the deposited B2O3 precursor.

        The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days. By calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 with an Si/B ratio of 62 was obtained. BS-1 catalyst was identified by x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibiting typical characteristics in its MFI structure. The BS-1 catalyst was active for the reaction, giving propane conversion with increasing reaction temperature. For example, 23.8 and 41.4% of propane conversions were realized on the BS-1 catalyst at 540°C and 560°C, respectively. The BS-1 catalyst retained this ability after the equivalent treatment. Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce 10 vol% water in the gas. The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The fresh BS-1 exhibited a strong peak at 3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework. The two-dimensional (2D) 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species.

        A novel approach to the synthesis of antiexfoliating h-BNIn2O3 catalysts is presented, which combines the high-temperature stability of h-BN and the catalytic activity of In2O3. The catalyst exhibits excellent oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) activity towards propane under high-temperature and water-rich conditions. The structure of the catalyst consists of three-dimensional (3D) dispersed active sites embedded within a porous framework, facilitating efficient mass transfer and reaction kinetics. Incorporating B active components into these structures was achieved through a two-step process: first, the formation of a B-containing precursor, followed by its conversion into the final catalyst via thermal treatment. This method proved effective for incorporating B active components into various B-based materials, demonstrating broad applicability across different catalytic applications.

        A high surface area boron nitride catalyst is utilized for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, showcasing exceptional selectivity for olefins at high conversion rates. Its structure comprises 3-D dispersed active sites within porous frameworks, enhancing its catalytic performance. Various methods for incorporating boron components into these structures are explored, with their effectiveness evaluated for diverse catalytic applications.

        The presence of BOH groups was also reported in the study of ODH of propane on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of the materials in their fresh and spent forms by means of advance experimental techniques, e.g. XPS, ATR-IR, and DRIFTS. The hypothetical peroxyl-bridged armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) was proposed to serve as an active site in the ODHP reaction. In the survey of h-BN and BNNT catalytic systems, Lu et al. noticed a low initial activity in ODH of propane prior to reaching their stable performance, which implicated an activation period. This suggested that the intact boron nitrides were inert to the reactants under the ODH reaction conditions, and the high catalytic activity of boron nitrides was the consequence of their in situ surface functionalization. In a detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified a large number of accessible edges generated after functionalization at the edges. This was directly demonstrated in a work that used boron oxides supported on silicon oxide as the catalyst, explicitly correlating the catalytic activity to the percentages of oxygenated species. Based on experimental results and DFT calculations, a mechanism involving radical chemistry was proposed with the essence being that the BOH groups of the BNOH catalyst may be dehydrogenated by O2 and generated BNO and HO2 radicals in ODH of propane and ethane. The importance of the crystallinity of a carbon-based catalyst in the ODH of light alkanes was further confirmed in the study of Su and co-workers who employed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to convert 1-butylene and obtained a 40% butadiene yield, which was superior to that of activated carbon and iron oxide.

        Hollow anatase TiO2 nanospheres were synthesized through a facile method involving Ostwald ripening. The hollow structure was achieved due to the Ostwald ripening process, which led to the formation of a porous framework. The incorporation of boron (B) active components into the TiO2 nanospheres was accomplished through a co-precipitation method. These materials exhibited enhanced catalytic performance due to the large surface area provided by the porous framework and the dispersion of active sites.
