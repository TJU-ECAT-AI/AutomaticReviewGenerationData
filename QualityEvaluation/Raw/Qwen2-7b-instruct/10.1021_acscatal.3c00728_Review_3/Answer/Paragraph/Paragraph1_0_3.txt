            The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance oxidative dehydrogenation performance, particularly through boron oxide modification of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This method, involving incipient wetness impregnation, ensures uniform boron loading but varies in effectiveness based on the boron compound used. Boron oxide specifically improves selectivity, making boron-modified CNTs more efficient than conventional catalysts. Key quotes underscore the enhanced selectivity and the mechanism behind boron's effect on the CNT surface chemistry, demonstrating its superiority in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions compared to other catalysts like vanadia. 

            The 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks of B-based materials significantly improve catalytic activity. Incorporating B active components into these structures is crucial for enhancing catalytic performance, with effectiveness varying across specific applications. Engineering OO species in boron nitrous nanotubes boosts olefins for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, showcasing the catalytic advantage. Different methods for B component incorporation exist, each tailored to optimize performance for diverse catalytic tasks.

            The influence of reactor parameters on the boron nitride-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation of propane confirms the excellent catalytic performance of B-based materials with 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. These features enable efficient interaction between reactants and catalysts, enhancing the conversion rates and selectivity of the reactions. The incorporation of boron active components into these structures can be achieved through various methods, including impregnation, solvothermal synthesis, and sonochemical methods, each with varying effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application and the desired properties of the final product.

            This research explores the catalytic advantages and incorporation methods of PtSn bimetallic catalysts, focusing on the role of tin addition in reducing coke formation and enhancing stability. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst shows superior stability due to faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support, facilitated by the Al2O3 support. Compared to PtSn/Al catalysts, the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst accumulates slightly less coke, making the transport of coke from metallic sites to the support easier than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst. These findings highlight the importance of structural characteristics in B-based materials for enhanced catalytic performance.

            Analyzing B-based materials with 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, we find they significantly enhance catalytic performance. The synthesis of silica-supported boron oxide catalysts exemplifies this. Incorporation methods were discussed, with their effectiveness critically evaluated for various catalytic applications, underlining the importance of these structures in achieving optimized performance.

            Boron nitride catalysts feature a high surface area and a porous framework with 3D dispersed active sites, enabling exceptional selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to olefins. Various methods for incorporating boron components into these structures are explored, emphasizing their effectiveness across different catalytic applications.

            ACS Catalysis reports dynamic self-dispersion of aggregated boron clusters into stable oligomeric boron species on MFI zeolite nanosheets under oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, further supporting the enhanced catalytic performance of B-based materials with 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks.

            γ-Al2O3 nanosheets rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can nicely disperse and stabilize raft-like Pt-Sn clusters as a result of strong interactions between metal and support. Consequently, there are strong electronic interactions between the Pt and Sn atoms, resulting in an increase in the electron density of the Pt sites. When used in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, this catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity, and superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties. Sheet-like nanoarchitectures are an ideal choice for improving the mass-transfer and diffusion kinetics, which can in principle inhibit the secondary reaction that generates coke. The catalyst support plays a crucial role in modulating the geometric and electronic structure of active metal phases for optimizing the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability.

            Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films were synthesized using nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a seed, achieving atomically flat surfaces. This method prevents structural deformations during chemical vapor deposition, enhancing the quality of two-dimensional materials suitable for electronic devices. nc-G's sp3 edges play a pivotal role in initiating and promoting h-BN growth, leading to uniform flat surfaces.

            Borosilicate zeolites, featuring low crystallinity and homogeneously distributed boron, excel in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane due to boron species' open coordination and hydrogen bonding with surface SiOH groups, forming active centers for low-temperature reactions. Solid-state NMR, FTIR, and DRIFT confirm boron's anchoring within the zeolite matrix, with the micro-environment of boron species pivotal for catalytic properties.

            Supported boron oxide catalysts for selective and low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of propane demonstrate enhanced catalytic performance due to increased surface area and improved mass transfer properties. Incorporation methods, including chemical vapor deposition and impregnation, were compared for their effectiveness across different catalytic applications. Key insights were drawn from DFT calculations, confirming the role of structural characteristics in enhancing catalytic performance.

            The study utilizes DFT calculations to examine the B2O3-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, focusing on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. Enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to increased surface area and improved reactant accessibility. Incorporation methods vary, but all aim to optimize these advantageous properties, demonstrating their effectiveness across different catalytic contexts.
