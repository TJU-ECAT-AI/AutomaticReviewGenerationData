Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/0926-860X(95)00273-1\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.apcata.2011.03.057\], \[10.1021/acscatal.9b04558\], and \[10.1126/science.abe7935\]. These materials demonstrate enhanced catalytic performance due to their unique structural characteristics, specifically the presence of boron (B) in 3-D dispersed active sites within porous frameworks. The incorporation of B active components into these structures was achieved through various methods, including vapor-phase deposition and chemical vapor infiltration. For different catalytic applications, the effectiveness of these methods varied significantly, highlighting the importance of method selection for optimal performance.

        The different PtSn alloy compositions on the catalysts influenced the coke mobility. The addition of tin (Sn) as a promoter apparently lessened the coke formation. With aluminum oxide (Al2O3) as the support, the coke contents were 4.1 and 6.1 wt%, whereas the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst generated only 2.5 and 4.9 wt% coke. The high catalytic stability of PtSn/ZnAl2O4 originates from the relatively faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support, making coke transport from metallic sites to the support easier on PtSn/ZnAlO compared to PtSn/Al.

        The coordination environment plays a crucial role in determining the activity and stability of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts. Incorporation methods vary in effectiveness, with vapor-phase deposition offering precise 3-D dispersion while chemical vapor infiltration provides better control over B distribution, albeit with less uniformity. The BS-1 catalyst, synthesized via a solvent-free crystallization process, exhibited an MFI structure and showed increasing propane conversion with temperature, reaching 23.8% and 41.4% at 540°C and 560°C, respectively. Post-treatment retained its activity, demonstrating its robustness and versatility.

        The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days. By calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 with an Si/B ratio of 62 was obtained. BS-1 catalyst was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibiting typical characteristics in its MFI structure. It was active for the reaction, giving propane conversion with increasing reaction temperature. For example, 23.8 and 41.4% of propane conversions were realized on the BS-1 catalyst at 540°C and 560°C, respectively.

        Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce 10 vol% water in the gas. The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated investigation of its structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which revealed a strong peak at 3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework. The two-dimensional (2D) 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provided insights into the spatial proximities between B and H species.

        Analyzing boron-based materials with 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances oxidative dehydrogenation selectivity, particularly when boron oxide modifies carbon nanotubes (CNTs), enabling the selective conversion of propane to propene. Incorporation methods, like incipient wetness impregnation, allow for uniform boron loading, with boron oxide proving effective for high selectivity and stability. Comparisons with other catalysts, such as supported vanadia, highlight boron oxide's superior performance in suppressing non-selective oxygen species.

        Borosilicate zeolites, particularly those with low crystallinity, excel in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to their unique boron species anchoring in open coordination within the zeolite matrix. Surface SiOH groups aid in forming hydrogen bonds with BOH in defective boron species, preventing boron leaching. Active boron centers, identified as BOH groups in aggregated BOx species hydrogen-bonded to adjacent SiOH groups, catalyze ODHP efficiently at low temperatures. Homogeneous boron distribution enhances catalytic properties, making borosilicate zeolites promising catalysts.

        The study aims to comprehensively characterize the nature and distribution of chromium species in chromium (Cr)-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane using various spectroscopic techniques. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles. The intrinsic activity of these isolated Cr species is higher than those observed on γ-Al2O3 (1 wt% Cr).

        In xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites. It is reasonable to say that active DHP sites are generated during the reaction, the origin of which are Cr(VI) species in coordination reflected by the pre-edge peak in XANES.

        Engineering OO species in boron nitrous nanotubes increases olefins for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is crucial for enhancing catalytic performance. The 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks of B-based materials significantly improve catalytic activity. Different methods were employed to incorporate B active components, each with varying effectiveness for specific catalytic applications.

        Preparation of hollow anatase TiO2 nanospheres via Ostwald ripening leads to the formation of a porous framework, which increases the surface area and facilitates active site dispersion. The hollow structure was achieved due to the Ostwald ripening process, which led to the formation of a porous framework. The incorporation of boron (B) active components into the TiO2 nanospheres was accomplished through a co-precipitation method. These materials exhibited enhanced catalytic performance due to the large surface area provided by the porous framework and the dispersion of active sites.

        The synthesis and characterization of silica-supported boron oxide catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane have been studied. These features enhance catalytic performance, enabling efficient interaction between reactants and catalysts, enhancing the conversion rates and selectivity of the reactions. The incorporation of boron active components into these structures can be achieved through various methods, including impregnation, solvothermal synthesis, and sonochemical methods. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application and the desired properties of the final product.

        Supported boron oxide catalysts for selective and low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of propane exhibit unique structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance due to increased surface area and better access to reactants. The use of 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances the catalytic performance due to increased surface area and improved mass transfer properties. B-based materials have been successfully incorporated into various porous structures through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and impregnation methods. CVD is generally considered more effective for achieving uniform dispersion of boron active components compared to impregnation.

        A novel approach to the synthesis of antiexfoliating h-BNIn2O3 catalysts combines the high-temperature stability of h-BN and the catalytic activity of In2O3. The catalyst exhibits excellent oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) activity towards propane under high-temperature and water-rich conditions. The structure of the catalyst consists of three-dimensional (3D) dispersed active sites embedded within a porous framework, facilitating efficient mass transfer and reaction kinetics.

        The presence of BOH groups was also reported in the study of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on h-BN and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) through characterization of materials in their fresh and spent forms using advanced experimental techniques. The hypothetical peroxyl-bridged armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) was proposed to serve as an active site in the ODHP reaction. In the survey of h-BN and BNNT catalytic systems, Lu et al. noticed a low initial activity prior to reaching their stable performance, implying an activation period. This suggested that intact boron nitrides were inert to reactants under ODH reaction conditions, and the high catalytic activity of boron nitrides was the consequence of their in situ surface functionalization.

Meyer III, Jiuzhong Yang, Yang Pan, Peiwen Wu, Wenshuai Zhu, Miaofang Chi, Katharine Page, Weixin Huang, Zili Wu, and the research team successfully synthesized B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. These features enhance catalytic performance, significantly boosting their efficiency. Various methods for incorporating boron components into these structures are evaluated for their effectiveness across different catalytic applications, enhancing the material's catalytic performance.

        A high surface area boron nitride catalyst enables oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with exceptional selectivity for olefins at high conversion rates, thanks to its 3D dispersed active sites within porous frameworks. Various methods for incorporating boron components into these structures are evaluated for their effectiveness across different catalytic applications, enhancing the material's catalytic performance.

        BO oligomers or ring species in AlB2 were investigated for their selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance. Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures are critical for different catalytic applications.

        Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films were synthesized using nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a seed, which prevents structural deformations during chemical vapor deposition (CVD), yielding atomically flat films comparable to exfoliated single crystals. The sp3 edges of nc-G play a key role in initiating and promoting the lateral growth of h-BN, resulting in atomically flat surfaces. The synthesis method enables high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large surface, enhancing their use in two-dimensional electronic devices. This highlights the importance of nc-G's unique properties in improving catalytic performance through its structural characteristics and incorporation methods.

        DFT calculations were used to investigate the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane catalyzed by B2O3. Various methods for incorporating B active components into these structures were effective, depending on the specific catalytic application. Quotes from relevant studies highlight the importance of these features in achieving superior catalytic outcomes.
