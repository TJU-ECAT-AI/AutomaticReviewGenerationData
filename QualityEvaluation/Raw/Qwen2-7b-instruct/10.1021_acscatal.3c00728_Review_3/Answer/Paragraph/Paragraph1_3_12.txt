        B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit unique structural characteristics that significantly enhance catalytic performance, particularly in propane dehydrogenation. These features include increased surface area, efficient mass transfer, and optimal reactivity. The incorporation of boron active components into these structures is typically achieved through methods such as impregnation, solvothermal synthesis, and sonochemical methods. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application and desired product properties.
        
        For instance, the BS-1 catalyst, synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy, demonstrates active performance with increasing reaction temperature, achieving propane conversions of 23.8% and 41.4% at 540°C and 560°C, respectively. The catalyst retains its ability even after equivalent treatment, and high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) is maintained in a continuous operation even under conditions producing up to 10 vol% water.
        
        The 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy reveals the presence of tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site, providing insights into the spatial relationships between boron and hydrogen species. This finding underscores the catalytic advantages of 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials.
        
        Another example involves the synthesis of antiexfoliating h-BNIn2O3 catalysts, which combine the high-temperature stability of h-BN and the catalytic activity of In2O3, exhibiting excellent oxidative dehydrogenation activity towards propane under high-temperature and water-rich conditions. The catalyst's structure consists of 3D dispersed active sites embedded within a porous framework, facilitating efficient mass transfer and reaction kinetics.
        
        The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance due to their high surface area, efficient mass transfer, and optimal reactivity. Incorporation methods vary, including impregnation, ion exchange, and covalent attachment, each with its own relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications.
        
        Different methods for incorporating boron active components into these structures have been explored, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and impregnation. CVD is generally considered more effective for achieving uniform dispersion of boron active components compared to impregnation.
        
        These materials' unique structural characteristics and incorporation methods significantly impact catalytic applications, demonstrating enhanced performance in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
        
        The study highlights the development of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. These materials demonstrate enhanced catalytic performance due to their unique structural characteristics. The incorporation of boron active components into these structures was achieved through various methods, each with varying effectiveness for specific catalytic applications.
        
        The presence of BOH groups on h-BN and BNNT surfaces enhances catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, acting as active sites. Inert intact boron nitrides become active through in situ surface functionalization, correlating catalytic activity with oxygenated species.
        
        In a detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst, lattice relaxations and distortions occur exclusively at the edge of the layer, contributing to enhanced catalytic activity. Carbon nanotubes demonstrate improved performance in converting light alkanes, achieving higher yields compared to traditional catalysts.
        
        Based on experimental results and DFT calculations, a mechanism involving radical chemistry was proposed, with the essence being that the BOH groups of the BNOH catalyst may be dehydrogenated by O2 and generate BNO and HO2 radicals in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane, initiating gas phase radical chemistry.
        
        The importance of the crystallinity of a carbon-based catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes was further confirmed, employing carbon nanotubes to convert 1-butylene and obtaining a 40% butadiene yield, superior to that of activated carbon and iron oxide.
        
        Overall, these findings highlight the pivotal role of structural characteristics, catalytic advantages, and incorporation methods in B-based materials for enhanced catalytic applications.
        
        The synthesis and characterization of silica-supported boron oxide catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane exemplify effective incorporation methods, which are critically evaluated for diverse catalytic applications. The coordination environment plays a crucial role in determining the activity and stability of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts, with vapor-phase deposition techniques effectively integrating boron while maintaining the desired 3-D dispersion.
        
        Borosilicate zeolites, featuring low crystallinity and 3-D dispersed boron sites, excel in oxidative dehydrogenation due to boron's unique coordination within the zeolite matrix. The catalysts with low crystallinity exhibit excellent catalytic efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
        
        The study aims to comprehensively characterize the nature and distribution of chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane using various spectroscopic techniques, revealing that isolated Cr species on γ-Al2O3 have higher intrinsic activity compared to 1 wt% Cr.
        
        Hollow anatase TiO2 nanospheres, synthesized via the Ostwald ripening process, were prepared using a modified sol-gel process, exhibiting enhanced catalytic performance due to the large surface area provided by the porous framework and the dispersion of active sites.
        
        Supported boron oxide catalysts for selective and low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of propane show exceptional selectivity for olefins at high conversion rates, with the presence of 3-D dispersed active sites enhancing catalytic performance.
        
        The team successfully synthesized B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, significantly boosting their catalytic efficiency.
        
        In summary, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance, with boron incorporation methods tailored to specific applications. These materials offer a promising avenue for advanced catalytic applications in the field of propane dehydrogenation.
