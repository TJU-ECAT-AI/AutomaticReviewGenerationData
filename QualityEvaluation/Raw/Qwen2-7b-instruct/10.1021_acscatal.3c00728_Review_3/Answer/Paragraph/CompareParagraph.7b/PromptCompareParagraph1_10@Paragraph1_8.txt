B-based materials, when endowed with three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites embedded within porous frameworks, exhibit exceptional structural characteristics that significantly enhance their catalytic performance. These materials typically feature interconnected pore systems that provide high surface areas, which are crucial for increasing the accessibility of reactants to the catalytically active sites. The 3-D dispersion of these active sites ensures uniform reactivity across the entire material volume, minimizing reaction dead zones and promoting efficient mass transport.

Structurally, B-based materials often possess unique architectures, such as mesoporous or macroporous frameworks, which are finely tuned to optimize both the surface area and the pore size distribution. This design facilitates the accommodation of bulky catalysts or the adsorption of reactants without compromising the overall catalytic efficiency. The porosity also aids in the diffusion of products away from the active sites, reducing product inhibition and enhancing yield.

Catalytically, the incorporation of 3-D dispersed active sites into B-based materials can lead to improved selectivity and activity due to the enhanced exposure of reactive surfaces. The active sites are strategically distributed throughout the porous structure, allowing for a more homogeneous distribution of the catalytic action, which can be particularly advantageous in heterogeneous catalysis. This spatial arrangement also supports the stabilization of the active species, potentially extending the catalyst's lifetime and reducing deactivation rates.

In terms of incorporation methods, various strategies are employed to achieve the desired 3-D dispersion within porous frameworks. These include chemical vapor deposition, solvothermal synthesis, and template-directed methods, each tailored to create the specific pore architecture and active site distribution necessary for optimal catalytic performance. Post-synthesis modifications, such as etching or impregnation, may also be used to further tailor the material properties and enhance its catalytic capabilities.

Overall, the combination of structural characteristics, catalytic advantages, and strategic incorporation methods in B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks represents a promising avenue for advancing catalytic technologies, particularly in sectors requiring high efficiency, selectivity, and stability, such as petrochemical processing, environmental remediation, and energy conversion.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/jacs.1c13563\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acscatal.2c01622\], \[10.1021/acsomega.7b01489\], and \[10.1002/anie.201914696\]. Exceptional selectivity for olefins at high conversion, as highlighted by ACS Catalysis.

            The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms. The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity.

            The coordination environment plays a crucial role in determining the activity and stability of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts. Techniques like vapor-phase deposition effectively integrate B into the framework while maintaining the desired 3-D dispersion, offering superior catalytic performance compared to methods like chemical vapor infiltration, which may provide better control over B distribution but result in less uniform dispersion.

            Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films were synthesized using unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a seed, which prevents structural deformations during the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. This results in atomically flat h-BN films, comparable to exfoliated single-crystal h-BN, enhancing their use in two-dimensional electronic devices. The sp3 edges of nc-G play a key role in initiating and promoting the lateral growth of h-BN, leading to the formation of atomically flat surfaces.

            Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modified by boron oxide catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with remarkable selectivity. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over functionalized CNTs. Surface of carbon materials is usually terminated by a variety of oxygen functional groups, which play an important role in many research areas. Samples with boron oxide and phosphorus oxide have a superior selectivity towards propene formation than pristine CNTs and oCNTs. The only products that were detected were propene, CO, CO2, and H2O. Modified CNTs are much more selective than a variety of supported vanadia catalysts. Regarding the N2 physisorption results, a general rise in surface area, and in particular within the <5nm sized pores, may indicate a strong impact of the opening of closed carbon nanotubes at their ends by gas-phase oxygen during the ODH reaction.

            The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days. By calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 with an Si/B ratio of 62 was obtained. BS-1 catalyst was identified by x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibiting typical characteristics in its MFI structure. The BS-1 catalyst was active for the reaction, giving propane conversion with increasing reaction temperature. For example, 23.8 and 41.4% of propane conversions were realized on the BS-1 catalyst at 540°C and 560°C, respectively. The BS-1 catalyst retained this ability after the equivalent treatment. Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce 10 vol% water in the gas. The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The fresh BS-1 exhibited a strong peak at 3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework. The two-dimensional (2D) 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species.

            A novel approach to the synthesis of antiexfoliating h-BNIn2O3 catalysts is presented, combining the high-temperature stability of h-BN and the catalytic activity of In2O3.
