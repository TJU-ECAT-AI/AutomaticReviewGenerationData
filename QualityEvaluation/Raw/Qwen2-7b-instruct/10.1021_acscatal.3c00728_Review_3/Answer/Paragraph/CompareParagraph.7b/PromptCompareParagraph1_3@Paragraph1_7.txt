Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1126/science.abe7935], which synthesizes the BS-1 catalyst using a solvent-free crystallization strategy with tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide at 180°C. The catalyst, after calcination to remove organic templates, exhibits a Si/B ratio of 62 and displays typical MFI structure characteristics as identified by XRD patterns and N2 sorption isotherms. It demonstrates active performance for propane conversion, with 23.8% and 41.4% conversions at 540°C and 560°C, respectively. Durability tests confirm consistent high propane conversion even under conditions that might produce up to 10 vol% water. The 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy reveals the presence of tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site, providing insights into the spatial relationships between boron and hydrogen species.

        The BS-1 catalyst, with its 3-D dispersed active sites in a porous framework, showcases catalytic advantages due to its unique structural characteristics. Its incorporation was achieved through a two-step process: forming a B-containing precursor followed by thermal treatment to convert it into the final catalyst. This method was effective for incorporating B active components into various B-based materials, demonstrating broad applicability across different catalytic applications.

        B-based materials with 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance due to their high surface area, efficient mass transfer, and optimal reactivity. Incorporation methods, such as impregnation, ion exchange, and covalent attachment, vary in effectiveness for different catalytic applications, as evidenced by the synthesis of stable, active h-BNIn2O3 catalysts showing excellent oxidative dehydrogenation activity towards propane under challenging conditions.

        Engineering boron species on MFI zeolite nanosheets, as demonstrated in studies [10.1021/jacs.2c12136, 10.1021/acscatal.2c01622], highlights the potential of these materials in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Different methods for incorporating boron active components into B-based materials vary in effectiveness, and the dynamic self-dispersion of boron clusters on MFI zeolite nanosheets is a key finding.

        B-based materials with 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit enhanced catalytic performance due to improved active site distribution, increased surface area, optimized mass transfer, and optimal reactivity. Incorporation methods differ in effectiveness across different catalytic applications, as highlighted in studies focusing on the development of B-based materials with unique structural characteristics for enhanced catalytic performance.

        Incorporating boron components into B-based materials through various methods, such as impregnation, ion exchange, and covalent attachment, enhances catalytic performance across different applications. Key insights come from studies demonstrating the role of boron species, like BOH groups, in enhancing the catalytic efficiency of boron nitrous nanotubes for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

        The presence of BOH groups on h-BN and boron nitrous nanotubes surfaces enhances catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, acting as active sites. Inert intact boron nitrides become active through in situ surface functionalization, correlating catalytic activity with oxygenated species. Structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst identifies numerous accessible edges and lattice relaxations/distortions at the edges, contributing to enhanced catalytic activity.

        Carbon nanotubes demonstrate improved performance in converting light alkanes, achieving higher yields compared to traditional catalysts, further confirming the importance of structural characteristics, catalytic advantages, and incorporation methods in B-based materials for enhanced catalytic applications.

        Based on experimental results and DFT calculations, a mechanism involving radical chemistry was proposed, with the essence being that the BOH groups of the BNOH catalyst may be dehydrogenated by O2 and generate BNO and HO2 radicals in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane. This mechanism directly demonstrates the importance of structural characteristics in B-based materials for catalytic performance.

        Overall, the presence of BOH groups facilitates the dehydrogenation of reactants by O2, generating BNO and HO2 radicals, initiating gas phase radical chemistry. This highlights the importance of structural characteristics, catalytic advantages, and incorporation methods in B-based materials for enhanced catalytic applications.

        Sheet-like nanoarchitectures, as employed in the conversion of 1-butylene to butadiene, demonstrate improved performance compared to traditional catalysts, further confirming the role of structural characteristics in enhancing catalytic performance.

        The synthesis and characterization of silica-supported boron oxide catalysts exemplify effective incorporation methods, which are critically evaluated for diverse catalytic applications, showcasing the effectiveness of B-based materials with 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks.

        Vapor-phase deposition techniques effectively integrate B into the framework while maintaining the desired 3-D dispersion, contrasting with chemical vapor infiltration which might offer better control over B distribution but may result in less uniform dispersion. This method is particularly effective for incorporating B active components into structures with high catalytic performance.

        DFT calculations further examine the role of boron in propane oxidative dehydrogenation, highlighting the enhanced catalytic performance due to the unique structural characteristics of B-based materials. The effectiveness of incorporation methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and impregnation, is evaluated for various catalytic applications, demonstrating their relative effectiveness.

        Carbon nanotubes modified by boron oxide catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with remarkable selectivity, showcasing the pivotal role of boron-based materials in catalysis. The modified CNTs are much more selective than a variety of supported vanadia catalysts, further affirming the effectiveness of boron incorporation methods in enhancing catalytic performance.

        Borosilicate zeolites, featuring low crystallinity and 3-D dispersed boron sites, excel in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane due to boron's unique coordination within the zeolite matrix. Solid-state NMR, FTIR, and DRIFT confirm boron anchoring in open coordination, while surface SiOH groups facilitate hydrogen bonding with boron species, stabilizing them against leaching. BOH groups hydrogen bonding with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center, catalyzing reactions efficiently at low temperatures.

        Analyzing B-based materials with 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals their catalytic enhancement through increased surface area and improved mass transfer. Incorporation methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and impregnation, are effective for various applications, as highlighted in studies focusing on the development of B-based materials with unique structural characteristics for enhanced catalytic performance.

        Borosilicate zeolites with homogeneous distribution of boron have been proven as promising catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, with the micro-environment of boron species being the dominant factor for catalytic properties. This highlights the importance of understanding the structural underpinnings of B-based materials for optimized catalytic processes.

        The study aims to comprehensively characterize the nature and distribution of chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane using various spectroscopic techniques. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles. Isolated Cr species on γ-Al2O3 have higher intrinsic activity compared to 1 wt% Cr, whereas for xCrSBA-15, Cr(III) sites with coordination numbers greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3.

        In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites. The origin of active dehydrogenation sites is attributed to chromium(VI) species in coordination, as evidenced by the pre-edge peak in XANES. This underscores the importance of chromium species' structure in enhancing catalytic performance.

        Hollow anatase TiO2 nanospheres, synthesized via the Ostwald ripening process, exhibit a large surface area and efficient dispersion of active sites due to their porous framework. The incorporation of boron (B) active components into these nanospheres is accomplished through a co-precipitation method, leading to B-based materials with enhanced catalytic performance.

        Preparing B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks via a modified sol-gel process reveals their enhanced catalytic performance due to the hollow anatase TiO2 nanospheres created through the Ostwald ripening process. The quotes emphasize the importance of the hollow structure and its impact on performance in enhancing catalytic activity.

        The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units adjacent to silanol groups. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. As shown in prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms.

        The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity, highlighting the significance of boron's structural arrangement in enhancing catalytic performance.

        Supported boron oxide catalysts for selective and low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of propane exhibit exceptional selectivity for olefins at high conversion rates due to their 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. The use of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is generally considered more effective for achieving uniform dispersion of boron active components compared to impregnation, optimizing catalyst performance.

        Porous frameworks with 3D dispersed active sites, as utilized in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over a high surface area boron nitride catalyst, show exceptional selectivity for olefins at high conversion rates. The presence of 3D dispersed active sites enhances catalytic performance, and boron nitride catalysts stand out due to their high surface area and effectiveness. Various methods for incorporating boron active components into these structures are explored, demonstrating their relative effectiveness across different catalytic applications.

        The different PtSn alloy compositions on the catalysts influence the coke mobility, with the addition of tin as a promoter apparently lessening coke formation. With the Al2O3 support, the coke contents were 4.1 and 6.1 wt%, whereas the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst generated only 2.5 and 4.9 wt% coke. The high catalytic stability of PtSn/ZnAl2O4 originates from the relatively faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support, as confirmed by XPS measurements.

        Large-scale production of high-quality two-dimensional materials suitable for advanced electronic devices was achieved by synthesizing hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films using unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a seed, leveraging its sp3 edges to facilitate atomically flat h-BN formation on a c-Al2O3 substrate. This method enables large-scale production of high-quality two-dimensional materials, offering significant improvements over conventional methods in terms of catalytic performance.

        The team successfully synthesized B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, which significantly boost their catalytic efficiency. These features enhance catalytic performance, validating the effectiveness of these materials in catalytic applications.
