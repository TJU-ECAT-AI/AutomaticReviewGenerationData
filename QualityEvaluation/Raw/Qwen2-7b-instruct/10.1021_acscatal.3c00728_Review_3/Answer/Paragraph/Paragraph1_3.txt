It demonstrates active performance for propane conversion, with 23.8% and 41.4% conversions at 540°C and 560°C, respectively. Durability tests confirm consistent high propane conversion even under conditions that might produce up to 10 vol% water. The 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy reveals the presence of tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site, providing insights into the spatial relationships between boron and hydrogen species.

        The BS-1 catalyst, with its 3-D dispersed active sites in a porous framework, showcases catalytic advantages due to its unique structural characteristics.

        The study aims to comprehensively characterize the nature and distribution of chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane using various spectroscopic techniques. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles. Isolated Cr species on γ-Al2O3 have higher intrinsic activity compared to 1 wt% Cr, whereas for xCrSBA-15, Cr(III) sites with coordination numbers greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3.

        In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites. The origin of active dehydrogenation sites is attributed to chromium(VI) species in coordination, as evidenced by the pre-edge peak in XANES. This underscores the importance of chromium species' structure in enhancing catalytic performance.

        The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units adjacent to silanol groups. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. As shown in prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms.

        The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity, highlighting the significance of boron's structural arrangement in enhancing catalytic performance.

        Supported boron oxide catalysts for selective and low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of propane exhibit exceptional selectivity for olefins at high conversion rates due to their 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. The use of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is generally considered more effective for achieving uniform dispersion of boron active components compared to impregnation, optimizing catalyst performance.

        Porous frameworks with 3D dispersed active sites, as utilized in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over a high surface area boron nitride catalyst, show exceptional selectivity for olefins at high conversion rates.

Various methods for incorporating boron active components into these structures are explored, demonstrating their relative effectiveness across different catalytic applications.

        The different PtSn alloy compositions on the catalysts influence the coke mobility, with the addition of tin as a promoter apparently lessening coke formation. With the Al2O3 support, the coke contents were 4.1 and 6.1 wt%, whereas the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst generated only 2.5 and 4.9 wt% coke. The high catalytic stability of PtSn/ZnAl2O4 originates from the relatively faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support, as confirmed by XPS measurements.

        Large-scale production of high-quality two-dimensional materials suitable for advanced electronic devices was achieved by synthesizing hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films using unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a seed, leveraging its sp3 edges to facilitate atomically flat h-BN formation on a c-Al2O3 substrate. This method enables large-scale production of high-quality two-dimensional materials, offering significant improvements over conventional methods in terms of catalytic performance.
