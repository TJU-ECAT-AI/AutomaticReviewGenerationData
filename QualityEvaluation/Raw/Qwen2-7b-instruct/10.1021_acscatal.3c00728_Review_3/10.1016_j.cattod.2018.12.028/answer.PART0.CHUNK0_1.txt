[1] "The typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite with well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guarantee the mass transfer process at high GHSV, achieving a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN1h1 and improving the selectivity towards propylene and ethylene by suppressing secondary reactions of deep oxidation."
[2] "The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder."
[3] "Considering that the cordierite was composed of Al2O3, MgO and SiO2, hydroxyl groups will present on the surface of cordierite. The hydrogen bonds interaction can be formed between the surface OH of cordierite and BOH groups of H3BO3. In addition, CVD process could strength the interaction of boron species with cordierite in the form of BOSi and BOAl, which contributes to the outstanding adhesiveness between h-BN layer and cordierite."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing well-developed straight-channel pathways for gas-phase reactions and short diffusive pathways for efficient mass transfer. This allows for higher propane conversion and selectivity towards propylene and ethylene. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, utilizing boron acid and urea as precursors. The CVD process forms a thin layer of h-BN on the cordierite substrate, which improves the utilization of the B active component and ensures outstanding adhesiveness between the h-BN layer and the cordierite. This method is particularly effective for enhancing the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, as demonstrated by the high space time yields and selectivities achieved with the h-BN/Cordierite monolithic catalyst.

B基材料在多孔框架中3-D分散活性位点的结构特征通过提供发达的直通道路径和短扩散路径，提高了催化性能。这使得丙烷转化率更高，并且选择性向丙烯和乙烯。B活性成分的引入是通过化学气相沉积（CVD）方法实现的，利用硼酸和尿素作为前体。CVD过程在石英岩基底上形成一层薄薄的h-BN层，这改善了B活性组分的利用率，并确保了h-BN层与石英岩之间的出色粘附性。这种方法特别适用于增强氧化脱氢反应的催化性能，如通过h-BN/Cordierite多孔催化剂所展示的高时空产率和选择性证明。
