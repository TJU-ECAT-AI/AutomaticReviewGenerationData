<p>The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder.</p>
<p>In our previous work for ODH of ethane, we proposed that the gas phase free radical reactions play important roles in oxidative of ethane over h-BN.</p>
<p>We found that the edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, generating BO and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals. The BO radical catalyzes hydrogen abstraction of ethane to produce C2H5 radical while the HO2 radical may also be involved in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the gas phase.</p>
<p>Subsequently, dehydrogenation of C2H5 radical in gas phase by O2 or H2O2 produced the primary product C2H4.</p>
<p>Based on the previous work, we speculate that for ODHP reaction over h-BN catalyst, both surface and gas phase reaction play important roles.</p>
<p>The monolithic catalyst with a stone-like morphology shown in Fig. 1 d owned very small specific surface area of 7m2/g.</p>
<p>The EDS mapping of boron and nitrogen showed a highly and uniformly dispersed h-BN over the monolithic catalyst ( Fig. 1 ef).</p>
<p>Considering the loading amount of active phase is a crucial factor for controlling the total reaction rate of a monolithic catalyst, the catalytic properties over h-BN/Cordierite with different h-BN loading were investigated.</p>
<p>With the boron acid concentration increasing from 0.5M to 1M, 1.5M and 2M, h-BN loading amount increased almost linearly from 1.2% to 2.3%, 3.3% and 4.2%.</p>
<p>Further, the catalytic performance of h-BN/Cordierite with different h-BN loading was investigated.</p>
<p>As h-BN loading increased from 1.2% to 2.3%, 3.3% and 4.2%, the C3H8 conversion ( Fig. 4 a) and products distribution ( Fig. 4 b) almost kept identically.</p>
<p>To illustrate the role of the typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite catalyst, a controlled experiment has been performed by using h-BN powder as catalyst.</p>
<p>h-BN powder was diluted with SiO2 to ensure the total bed height (10mm) and the weight of h-BN (20mg) was the same with h-BN/Cordierite.</p>
<p>Under the same reaction conditions, the propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder.</p>
<p>The adherence of the monolithic catalyst layer was evaluated according to a method described in the literature, based on the measurement of the weight loss caused by exposure to ultrasounds.</p>
<p>The weight loss was only 1.5% even after 120min tests.</p>
<p>Combining with the stability test result, we conclude that the mechanical stability is excellent, which was probably attributed to the outstanding adhesiveness between boron-based compounds and cordierite, no extra binders are needed in the wash-coating process.</p>
<p>The effect of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) to catalytic performance was evaluated ( Fig. 7 a).</p>
<p>At a GHSV of 72,000mLgBN1h1, the C3H8 conversion reached 20.8% at 485 , with the products of C3H6 (77.0%), C2H4 (10.5%), CO (11.5%), CO2 (1.0%).</p>
<p>By increasing GHSV to 144,000mLgBN1h1, the C3H8 conversion was remained to 17.3% by increasing the reaction temperature to 505 , with the selectivity towards C3H8 increased to 82.1%, while that of CO and CO2 decreased to 7.4% and 0.4%.</p>
<p>Moreover, further increasing GHSV to 576,000mLgBN1h1, the selectivity towards C3H6 and C2H4 increased to 82.1% and 14.2%, while that of CO decreased to 3.7% and no CO2 was detected, achieving a high space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN1h1.</p>
<p>Both the light olefins selectivity and productivity are higher than the reported h-BN and most of metal oxide catalysts.</p>
<p>According to the abovementioned results, we conclude that the h-BN/Cordierite catalyst can achieve high C3H8 throughput by increasing reaction temperature due to the excellent mass transfer process and highly efficient utilization of the active phase.</p>

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing ample space for gas phase radical reactions. This allows for more efficient use of the active sites and increases the conversion rates of reactants. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods, which are effective for various catalytic applications. The CVD process ensures a uniform dispersion of the active components, leading to high activity and selectivity. The monolithic structure of h-BN/Cordierite catalysts optimizes mass and heat transfer, contributing to the high selectivity and productivity of light olefins. The mechanical stability and adhesiveness between boron-based compounds and cordierite ensure long-term performance. Increasing the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) leads to a high space time yield, minimizing COx formation and maximizing the selectivity towards light olefins. These findings suggest that the h-BN/Cordierite monolithic catalysts are promising for industrial applications in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to produce olefins.
