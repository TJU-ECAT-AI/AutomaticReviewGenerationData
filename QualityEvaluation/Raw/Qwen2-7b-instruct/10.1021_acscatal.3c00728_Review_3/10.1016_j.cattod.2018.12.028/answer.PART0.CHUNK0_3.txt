[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a burgeoning catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with impressive light olefins selectivity, which deserves further study to optimize the heat and mass transfer process with the aim of promoting the potential industrial application since ODHP is a highly exothermic process."
[2] "Monolithic catalysts have attracted great interests in recent years [16] due to their significant advantages such as better mass transfer, lower pressure drop and narrow residence time distribution."
[3] "The monolithic catalyst with a stone-like morphology shown in Fig. 1 d owned very small specific surface area of 7m2/g."
[4] "Considering the loading amount of active phase is a crucial factor for controlling the total reaction rate of a monolithic catalyst, the catalytic properties over h-BN/Cordierite with different h-BN loading were investigated."
[5] "The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder."
[6] "Moreover, a high C3H8 throughput was achieved by improving the GHSV, leading to a high selectivity towards olefin while minimizing COx formation."

The document discusses the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, focusing on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and cordierite monoliths. The h-BN/Cordierite monolithic catalyst exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The h-BN layer, acting as the active component, improves the utilization of the active phase through coating on the surface of cordierite. This thin layer enhances the catalyst's efficiency by optimizing the mass and heat transfer processes. The straight-channel structure of the h-BN/Cordierite monolith provides space for gas-phase radical reactions, which increases the propane conversion rate compared to h-BN powder catalysts. The catalyst's high throughput and selectivity towards olefins, along with minimized COx formation, make it attractive for industrial application in propane-to-olefin production.
