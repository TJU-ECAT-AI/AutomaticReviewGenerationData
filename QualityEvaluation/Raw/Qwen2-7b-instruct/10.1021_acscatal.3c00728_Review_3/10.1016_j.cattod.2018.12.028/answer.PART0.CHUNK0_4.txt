[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a burgeoning catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with impressive light olefins selectivity, which deserves further study to optimize the heat and mass transfer process with the aim of promoting the potential industrial application since ODHP is a highly exothermic process."
[2] "The typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite with well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guarantee the mass transfer process at high GHSV, achieving a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN1h1 and improving the selectivity towards propylene and ethylene by suppressing secondary reactions of deep oxidation."
[3] "The effect of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) to catalytic performance was evaluated ( Fig. 7 a). At a GHSV of 72,000mLgBN1h1, the C3H8 conversion reached 20.8% at 485 , with the products of C3H6 (77.0%), C2H4 (10.5%), CO (11.5%), CO2 (1.0%)."
[4] "Moreover, at high GHSV, the contact time of reactants is short, which reduces the deep oxidation of reactant. Furthermore, increasing the gas-space velocity contributes to solving the serious issue of radial thermal transmission inside the monolith [ 14 ]."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involve the use of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as an active component, which is dispersed throughout the porous structure. This dispersion allows for enhanced catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for reactions and facilitating efficient mass and heat transfer. The use of h-BN in a monolithic structure with a thin layer coating ensures that the active sites are well-distributed, improving the utilization of the active phase. The straight-channel structure of the h-BN layer enables efficient gas-phase reactions, which enhances the conversion of reactants into desired products. The optimization of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) leads to a high throughput of propane, resulting in high selectivity towards olefin products and minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into porous frameworks, particularly in optimizing the mass and heat transfer processes for catalytic applications.
