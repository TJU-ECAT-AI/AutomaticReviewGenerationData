The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by facilitating better mass transfer, lower pressure drop, and narrower residence time distribution. These features allow for more efficient utilization of the active sites, leading to improved reactivity and selectivity. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods using boron acid and urea as precursors. This method is effective for various catalytic applications due to its ability to deposit a thin layer of B-based materials on the surface of the support material, thereby optimizing mass and heat transfer processes. By adjusting the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), the catalytic performance can be further enhanced, leading to high selectivity towards light olefins while minimizing the formation of COx. The monolithic structure ensures a high space time yield, making the B-based catalysts attractive for industrial applications in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to produce olefin.

B基材料在多孔框架中的三维分散活性位点的结构特征通过促进更好的质量传输、更低的压力降和更窄的停留时间分布，提高了催化性能。这些特性允许更有效地利用活性位点，从而提高反应性和选择性。将B活性成分引入这些结构通常通过化学气相沉积（CVD）方法使用硼酸和尿素作为前体实现。这种方法对各种催化应用有效，因为它能够在支撑材料表面沉积一层薄的B基材料，从而优化质量和热传输过程。通过调整气体小时空速（GHSV），可以进一步增强催化性能，导致高选择性向轻烯烃，同时减少COx的形成。多孔结构确保了高空间时间产率，使B基催化剂对工业应用中丙烷氧化脱氢生产烯烃具有吸引力。
