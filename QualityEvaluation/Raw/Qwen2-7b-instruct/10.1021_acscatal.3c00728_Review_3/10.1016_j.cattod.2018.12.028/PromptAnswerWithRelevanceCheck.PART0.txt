The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by facilitating better mass transfer, lower pressure drop, and narrower residence time distribution. These features allow for more efficient utilization of the active sites, leading to improved reactivity and selectivity. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods using boron acid and urea as precursors. This method is effective for various catalytic applications due to its ability to deposit a thin layer of B-based materials on the surface of the support material, thereby optimizing mass and heat transfer processes. By adjusting the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), the catalytic performance can be further enhanced, leading to high selectivity towards light olefins while minimizing the formation of COx. The monolithic structure ensures a high space time yield, making the B-based catalysts attractive for industrial applications in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to produce olefin.

[1] "The typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite with well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guarantee the mass transfer process at high GHSV, achieving a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN1h1 and improving the selectivity towards propylene and ethylene by suppressing secondary reactions of deep oxidation."
[2] "The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder."
[3] "Considering that the cordierite was composed of Al2O3, MgO and SiO2, hydroxyl groups will present on the surface of cordierite. The hydrogen bonds interaction can be formed between the surface OH of cordierite and BOH groups of H3BO3. In addition, CVD process could strength the interaction of boron species with cordierite in the form of BOSi and BOAl, which contributes to the outstanding adhesiveness between h-BN layer and cordierite."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing well-developed straight-channel pathways for gas-phase reactions and short diffusive pathways for efficient mass transfer. This allows for higher propane conversion and selectivity towards propylene and ethylene. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, utilizing boron acid and urea as precursors. The CVD process forms a thin layer of h-BN on the cordierite substrate, which improves the utilization of the B active component and ensures outstanding adhesiveness between the h-BN layer and the cordierite. This method is particularly effective for enhancing the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, as demonstrated by the high space time yields and selectivities achieved with the h-BN/Cordierite monolithic catalyst.

<p>The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder.</p>
<p>In our previous work for ODH of ethane, we proposed that the gas phase free radical reactions play important roles in oxidative of ethane over h-BN.</p>
<p>We found that the edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, generating BO and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals. The BO radical catalyzes hydrogen abstraction of ethane to produce C2H5 radical while the HO2 radical may also be involved in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the gas phase.</p>
<p>Subsequently, dehydrogenation of C2H5 radical in gas phase by O2 or H2O2 produced the primary product C2H4.</p>
<p>Based on the previous work, we speculate that for ODHP reaction over h-BN catalyst, both surface and gas phase reaction play important roles.</p>
<p>The monolithic catalyst with a stone-like morphology shown in Fig. 1 d owned very small specific surface area of 7m2/g.</p>
<p>The EDS mapping of boron and nitrogen showed a highly and uniformly dispersed h-BN over the monolithic catalyst ( Fig. 1 ef).</p>
<p>Considering the loading amount of active phase is a crucial factor for controlling the total reaction rate of a monolithic catalyst, the catalytic properties over h-BN/Cordierite with different h-BN loading were investigated.</p>
<p>With the boron acid concentration increasing from 0.5M to 1M, 1.5M and 2M, h-BN loading amount increased almost linearly from 1.2% to 2.3%, 3.3% and 4.2%.</p>
<p>Further, the catalytic performance of h-BN/Cordierite with different h-BN loading was investigated.</p>
<p>As h-BN loading increased from 1.2% to 2.3%, 3.3% and 4.2%, the C3H8 conversion ( Fig. 4 a) and products distribution ( Fig. 4 b) almost kept identically.</p>
<p>To illustrate the role of the typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite catalyst, a controlled experiment has been performed by using h-BN powder as catalyst.</p>
<p>h-BN powder was diluted with SiO2 to ensure the total bed height (10mm) and the weight of h-BN (20mg) was the same with h-BN/Cordierite.</p>
<p>Under the same reaction conditions, the propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder.</p>
<p>The adherence of the monolithic catalyst layer was evaluated according to a method described in the literature, based on the measurement of the weight loss caused by exposure to ultrasounds.</p>
<p>The weight loss was only 1.5% even after 120min tests.</p>
<p>Combining with the stability test result, we conclude that the mechanical stability is excellent, which was probably attributed to the outstanding adhesiveness between boron-based compounds and cordierite, no extra binders are needed in the wash-coating process.</p>
<p>The effect of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) to catalytic performance was evaluated ( Fig. 7 a).</p>
<p>At a GHSV of 72,000mLgBN1h1, the C3H8 conversion reached 20.8% at 485 , with the products of C3H6 (77.0%), C2H4 (10.5%), CO (11.5%), CO2 (1.0%).</p>
<p>By increasing GHSV to 144,000mLgBN1h1, the C3H8 conversion was remained to 17.3% by increasing the reaction temperature to 505 , with the selectivity towards C3H8 increased to 82.1%, while that of CO and CO2 decreased to 7.4% and 0.4%.</p>
<p>Moreover, further increasing GHSV to 576,000mLgBN1h1, the selectivity towards C3H6 and C2H4 increased to 82.1% and 14.2%, while that of CO decreased to 3.7% and no CO2 was detected, achieving a high space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN1h1.</p>
<p>Both the light olefins selectivity and productivity are higher than the reported h-BN and most of metal oxide catalysts.</p>
<p>According to the abovementioned results, we conclude that the h-BN/Cordierite catalyst can achieve high C3H8 throughput by increasing reaction temperature due to the excellent mass transfer process and highly efficient utilization of the active phase.</p>

The use of h-BN in a monolithic structure with a thin layer coating ensures that the active sites are well-distributed, improving the utilization of the active phase. The straight-channel structure of the h-BN layer enables efficient gas-phase reactions, which enhances the conversion of reactants into desired products. The optimization of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) leads to a high throughput of propane, resulting in high selectivity towards olefin products and minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating B active components into porous frameworks, particularly in optimizing the mass and heat transfer processes for catalytic applications.
