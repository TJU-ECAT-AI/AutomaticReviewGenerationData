[1] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions."
[2] "High selectivity to propylene is achieved by using these B-containing catalysts, and the main byproduct is ethylene, rather than COx."
[3] "The XPS B1s feature of fresh (dotted) and spent (solid) B-containing catalysts."
[4] "The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins."
