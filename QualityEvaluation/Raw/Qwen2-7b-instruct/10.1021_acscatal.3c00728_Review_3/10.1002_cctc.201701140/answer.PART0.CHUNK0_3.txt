[1] "Other boron-containing materials such as boron carbide, titanium boride, nickel boride, cobalt boride, hafnium boride, and tungsten boride, as well as elemental boron itself, show the same exceptional behavior as boron nitride."
[2] "X-ray photoelectron and infrared spectroscopy suggest oxyfunctionalization of the surface."
[3] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions."
[4] "Of the boron-containing catalysts tested, B4C and WB are the most and least reactive, respectively, and they differ in their specific rates of propane consumption per gram of catalyst by a factor of approximately 5."
[5] "These B-containing catalysts were found to have similar surface elemental compositions, primarily composed of B and O atoms, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."
[6] "Boronoxygen coordination was confirmed for spent B-containing compounds from observed shifts to higher binding energies of the B1s XPS feature."

Structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing ample surface area for adsorption and reaction of substrates, while the 3-D dispersion ensures uniform access to reactants across the material's volume. These features facilitate the formation of active sites, which are crucial for efficient catalysis. The incorporation of B active components into porous frameworks often involves chemical synthesis techniques, such as sol-gel processes, impregnation methods, or direct growth on the framework surface. These methods allow for precise control over the B loading and distribution, optimizing the material's catalytic activity. For different catalytic applications, the effectiveness of these methods varies based on factors such as the desired activity, selectivity, and stability requirements of the catalyst. The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks have been shown to be highly selective and active in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, indicating their potential for industrial use in the production of olefins.
