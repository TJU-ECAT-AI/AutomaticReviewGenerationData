[Boronoxygen coordination was confirmed for spent B-containing compounds from observed shifts to higher binding energies of the B1s XPS feature. The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins.]

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance due to the presence of boronoxygen coordination sites (BOx). These sites facilitate the selective reaction pathways leading to the formation of olefins under oxidative dehydrogenation conditions. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through various methods, including chemical vapor deposition, sol-gel processes, and impregnation techniques. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific application, with chemical vapor deposition often providing higher uniformity and control over the active site distribution.

B基于材料在多维分散活性位点中的孔状框架结构中，其结构特征通过硼氧配位点（BOx）增强催化性能。这些位点在氧化脱氢化条件下促进选择性反应途径，形成烯烃。将B活性成分整合到这些结构中的方法包括化学气相沉积、溶胶-凝胶过程和浸渍技术。这些方法的有效性根据具体应用而有所不同，化学气相沉积通常提供更高的均匀性和活性位点分布控制。
