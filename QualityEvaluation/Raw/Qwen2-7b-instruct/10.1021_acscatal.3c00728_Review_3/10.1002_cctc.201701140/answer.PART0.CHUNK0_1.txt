[1] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions."
[2] "Furthermore, the reactivity of elemental B far exceeds that of other boron-containing materials, and it achieves specific rates approximately 31 times higher than hBN and approximately 19 times higher than B4C."
[3] "These B-containing catalysts were found to have similar surface elemental compositions, primarily composed of B and O atoms, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."
[4] "The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins."

Structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for reactions and facilitating easier access to the active sites. The incorporation of B active components into these structures typically involves chemical vapor deposition, impregnation, or co-precipitation methods. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific application, with chemical vapor deposition often being more effective for achieving uniform dispersion and high loading of B active sites.

The enhanced performance of B-based materials can be attributed to the presence of 3-D dispersed active sites, which offer a higher surface area and better accessibility for reactants. This results in improved catalytic activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data confirms the formation of a BOx active site, which plays a critical role in the reaction mechanism, leading to the selective formation of olefins.

The relative effectiveness of incorporating B active components into porous frameworks depends on factors such as the type of material, the method of incorporation, and the specific catalytic application. Chemical vapor deposition tends to provide better dispersion and higher loading of active sites compared to other methods, enhancing the overall catalytic performance.

B基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔框架中的结构特征通过提供更大的反应表面和促进活性位点的更容易访问来增强催化性能。将B活性成分引入这些结构通常涉及化学气相沉积、浸渍或共沉淀方法。这些方法的有效性根据具体应用而有所不同，化学气相沉积方法通常更有利于实现均匀分散和高负载的B活性位点。

B基材料增强性能的原因在于存在多维分散活性位点，这提供了更高的表面积和更好的反应物访问性，从而提高了催化活性和选择性，特别适用于氧化脱氢反应。X射线光电子能谱(XPS)数据证实了形成BOx活性位点，这是反应机制的关键，导致选择性生成烯烃。

将B活性成分引入孔框架的有效性取决于材料类型、引入方法以及特定催化应用等因素。化学气相沉积方法倾向于提供更好的分散性和更高负载的活性位点，从而增强整体催化性能。
