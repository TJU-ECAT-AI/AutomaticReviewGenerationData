Structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for reactions and facilitating easier access to the active sites. The incorporation of B active components into these structures typically involves chemical vapor deposition, impregnation, or co-precipitation methods. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific application, with chemical vapor deposition often being more effective for achieving uniform dispersion and high loading of B active sites.

The enhanced performance of B-based materials can be attributed to the presence of 3-D dispersed active sites, which offer a higher surface area and better accessibility for reactants. This results in improved catalytic activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data confirms the formation of a BOx active site, which plays a critical role in the reaction mechanism, leading to the selective formation of olefins.

The relative effectiveness of incorporating B active components into porous frameworks depends on factors such as the type of material, the method of incorporation, and the specific catalytic application. Chemical vapor deposition tends to provide better dispersion and higher loading of active sites compared to other methods, enhancing the overall catalytic performance.

Boron nitride was recently identified as a highly selective catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. In this communication, we report that other boron-containing materials such as boron carbide, titanium boride, nickel boride, cobalt boride, hafnium boride, and tungsten boride, as well as elemental boron itself, show the same exceptional behavior as boron nitride.
This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts.
The various B-containing materials differ in their catalytic performance only in the rates of propane consumption.
Of the boron-containing catalysts tested, B4C and WB are the most and least reactive, respectively, and they differ in their specific rates of propane consumption per gram of catalyst by a factor of approximately 5.
To identify structural similarities between the tested catalysts that lead to the observed activity, spectroscopic characterization was undertaken.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the elemental surface compositions of the fresh and spent catalysts.
With the exception of fresh hBN, which contains a roughly equivalent ratio of B and N atoms at its surface, it appears that the fresh materials actually contain very little of the non-boron elements at the surface.
For example, Ni atoms comprise less than 10% of the surface atoms of fresh NiB.
Instead, the surfaces of all the fresh catalysts are enriched with B and O atoms.
Even in the case of elemental B, the surface oxygen content amounts to 17% prior to the catalytic tests.
Upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, surface oxygen concentrations increase, whereas concentrations of non-boron elements decrease.
The only exception is HfB2, which sees a marginal increase in the surface Hf content from 2.5 to 3.5% after the reaction.
The substantially lower concentration of surface oxygen in hBN relative to that in the other B-containing catalysts might be explained by its exceptional resistance to oxidation.
Notably, the X-ray photoelectron spectral regions of the constituent elements (i.e., C1s, Ti2p, Ni2p, N1s, Co2p, Hf4d, and W4f) do not show the same shifts toward higher binding energies upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, which suggests oxygen does not coordinate to these elements.
These data could suggest that the active sites of these B-containing catalysts might be a layer of B2O3 formed on the surface.
However, we are able to reject this possibility by considering that the reaction temperature (500C) exceeds the melting point of B2O3 (450C) and, thus, would result in B2O3 gradually leaching off of the B-containing catalysts leading to an observed deactivation.
The strong catalytic stability of hBN was already evidenced in separate studies, and it showed stable propane conversion for 3days and 13days on stream.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these features enhance catalytic performance. The materials discussed include elemental boron, boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (CoB), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB). These materials are characterized by their ability to form surface-stabilized BOx active sites, which are responsible for the selective reaction pathways leading to the formation of olefins during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The presence of boron and oxygen coordination on the surfaces of these materials, as confirmed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), indicates the formation of these active sites. The catalytic performance of these materials varies, with differences in reactivity mainly attributed to variations in the active-site densities and electronic interactions between the surface BOx species and the subsurface bulk structure. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through synthesis methods tailored to create porous frameworks, ensuring optimal distribution of the B active sites. The effectiveness of these methods varies for different catalytic applications, with the most effective ones enabling high selectivity and efficiency in the production of olefins from propane through oxidative dehydrogenation. The results suggest that the structural characteristics of these materials, including their 3-D dispersion and porous nature, contribute significantly to their enhanced catalytic performance.
