2.3. B Active Sites Located in or Bonded to the 3-D Framework of Porous Materials
The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas. (77) The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals. Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process. Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites.

2.3.1. 3-D Supported BN Active Sites
To meet the heat and mass transfer requirements of industrial applications, the 3-D monolith of BN is a potential and promising catalyst that improves the pressure drop of the catalyst bed and enhances its stability. (97)

2.3.2. 3-D Supported BOx Active Sites
When preparing a supported BOx catalyst on a 2-D carrier, because of the volatility and rapid loss of the B precursor, the maximum B loading on SiO2 is 2%, which restricts the improvement of the propene yield. Recently, Lus group (63) reported a novel approach to load boron oxide with a high loading of up to 30%, with the assistance of the 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite to anchor the boron oxide active sites (Figure 5b).

2.3.3. Bulk B-Based Catalysts with 3-D Dispersed Active Site Doped in the Framework of Porous Materials
Zeolites, a family of porous materials with a high specific surface area and uniform and tunable pore structure, are widely used in heterogeneous catalysis. By doping B species into zeolite frameworks, a 3-D dispersion of the B active site can be achieved.

2.3.4. Exploration of Active Sites on 3-D B Materials
The study of active sites on the surface of 2-D materials has shown that the agglomerated tricoordination oxidized B species are responsible for ODHP catalytic performance, which are further explored in 3-D B materials, such as supported boron oxide catalysts, (63,64) boron phosphate catalyst, (104) etc.

2.3. Classification of B-based Catalysts by the Dispersion Dimension of Active Sites
By classifying the reported catalysts from the perspective of the B dispersion dimension, the potential strategies to enhance the catalytic performances are revealed. The increasing active site dispersion dimension from 1-D to 2-D and 3-D significantly increases the density of available centers for the ODHP reaction.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals their ability to enhance catalytic performance through the provision of high specific surface areas and suitable pore volumes. These features facilitate the accommodation of active B species and influence the reaction behavior of radicals. Moreover, the pore structure regulates mass transport during the reaction process. The incorporation of B active components into 3-D porous structures or doping into the 3-D framework of porous materials is an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites. The use of 3-D monoliths of BN materials, for instance, improves heat and mass transfer requirements, reducing pressure drop and enhancing catalyst stability. High B loadings on 2-D carriers, up to 30%, are achieved through the use of 3-D mesoporous structures like SBA-15 zeolite, which anchors the boron oxide active sites, surpassing the limitations of volatile precursors. Zeolites, with their high specific surface area and tunable pore structure, are extensively utilized in heterogeneous catalysis by doping B species to achieve a 3-D dispersion of the active site. The study of active sites on 2-D and 3-D B materials further elucidates the importance of the dispersion dimension in enhancing catalytic performance. The increasing dispersion dimension from 1-D to 2-D and 3-D significantly increases the density of available centers for the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons (ODHP) reaction, offering potential strategies to enhance catalytic performances.
