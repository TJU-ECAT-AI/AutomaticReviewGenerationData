Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, we find that these materials exhibit high specific surface areas and suitable pore volumes, which provide abundant sites for accommodating active B species. The confined space created by these pores influences the reaction behavior of radicals and regulates mass transport behaviors during the reaction process. Incorporating B active components into these structures is achieved through various methods, such as loading them onto the surface of 3-D porous structures or doping them into the 3-D frameworks of porous materials. These methods effectively construct 3-D B active sites.

The SEM results demonstrate that by attaching B active components to the monolith wall, the utilization of B species can be enhanced, forming a thin layer. The well-developed 3-D channel structure allows for gas-phase radical reactions, leading to excellent catalytic performance. The uniform flow distribution and short diffusion paths facilitate the utilization of the active component, alleviating overoxidation. The high density of B-containing active sites prevents undesirable side reactions on bare supports. The structure and physicochemical properties of the 3-D support significantly impact product distribution, affecting mass and heat transport. Homogeneous catalysts are heterogenized using 3-D framework supports, enhancing their catalytic activity.

Doping B species into zeolite frameworks enables a 3-D dispersion of the B active site, maintaining the 3-D pore structure of zeolite, which plays a critical role in propane conversion. The structure of the BS-1 catalyst contains isolated B species with a B[OH···O(H)Si]2 structure, providing high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation. The 3-D structure maintains stability and prevents B leaching during the reaction. Suitable 3D pore structures in catalysts like BPO4(OM) facilitate molecular diffusion and heat transfer, enhancing catalytic performance. The 3-D h-BN bowl foam, with its large surface area and numerous mesopores, demonstrates excellent activity for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, achieving high propane conversion and propene selectivity, along with high productivity.

These findings highlight the importance of 3-D dispersion of active sites in porous frameworks for enhancing catalytic performance in B-based materials, and the effective incorporation of B active components through various methods leads to improved catalysts for different applications.
