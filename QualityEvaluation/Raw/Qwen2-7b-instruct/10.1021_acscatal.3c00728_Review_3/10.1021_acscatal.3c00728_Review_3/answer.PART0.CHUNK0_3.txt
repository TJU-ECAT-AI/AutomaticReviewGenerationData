[1] "The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals."
[2] "Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process."
[3] "Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites."
[4] "The SEM results (Figure 5a) showed that the catalytic film of the h-BN/cordierite catalyst with 4.2% h-BN loading was attached to the monolith wall with a thickness of 3 μm, enhancing the utilization of h-BN by forming a thin layer."
[5] "According to the evaluation and characterization results, the h-BN/cordierite catalyst with 3-D supported BN active species achieved high C3H8 throughput owing to the excellent mass transfer process and highly efficient utilization of the active phase."
[6] "To meet the heat and mass transfer requirements of industrial applications, the 3-D monolith of BN is a potential and promising catalyst that improves the pressure drop of the catalyst bed and enhances its stability."
[7] "The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of h-BN/cordierite also provided space for gas-phase radical reactions; thus, excellent catalytic performance was achieved with a 16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity toward propene, only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2 at 535 C, and a high gas hourly space velocity of 576000 mL gBN1 h1 (Figure 5)."
[8] "Although the aforementioned B2O3-supported catalysts on commercial SiO2 or SBA-15 support show excellent catalytic performance with high activity and olefin selectivity as well as industrialization potential, problems such as a high-pressure drop of the catalyst packing and poor mass transfer in the catalyst pellets may limit their large-scale application."
[9] "However, owing to the loss of surface hydroxyls under high temperature calcination (1400 C) during the cordierite production process, the interaction between bare cordierite and B was insufficient to immobilize the B species."
[10] "Therefore, the cordierite support was modified by an additional silica coating layer that could attach firmly to the cordierite substrate possibly by forming SiOAl, SiOMg, and SiOSi bonds and attach to the boron oxide layer via SiOB bonds."
[11] "With this catalyst system, a high B loading of up to 10 wt % was realized. Moreover, the catalyst achieved excellent olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under a high gas hourly space velocity of 345600 mL·gB2O31·h1."
[12] "In the past few decades, supported liquid-phase catalysts (SLPCs), featuring a liquid-phase catalyst film or droplet adsorbed onto the surface of a 3-D porous support, have been developed to integrate the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis."
[13] "The metal-free 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite exhibited a propane conversion of 24.7% and 84.8% selectivity for total olefin (ethene and propene) with the productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, which is better than several metal-based oxidative dehydrogen catalysts."
[14] "This is because of the decrease of crystallinity of zeolite, as the content of B could be kept constant before and after the reaction."
[15] "During the cooling process, liquid B2O3 cooled and solidified into nanowires covering both the inside and outside of the 3-D BPO4 hollow sphere, forming sandwich-type B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres."
[16] "For the 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite reported by Lus group, (59) a considerable loss of activity occurred after the washing treatment because of the decrease in the defective trigonal B species."
[17] "By contrast, the BS-1 catalyst could maintain the catalytic activity after water treatment. The ICP analysis, N2 sorption, XRD pattern, SEM images, and TEM images verified that the 3-D zeolite structure was maintained and that B leaching was nearly negligible after the reaction."
[18] "To obtain an improved low-temperature ODHP performance of B-containing MFI-type zeolite, Qiu et al. (69) regulated the crystallinity of the zeolite by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions and prepared an incompletely crystallized MFI-type borosilicate zeolite catalyst."
[19] "In the ODHP reaction, the mass transport behaviors play an important role in the enhancement of catalytic performance, which makes the design of suitable 3D pore structures crucial."
[20] "The pore structure of BPO4(OM) was a 3-D cross macropore network, which could effectively improve molecular diffusion and heat transfer."
[21] "This 3-D h-BN bowl foam possessed a large surface area (524 m2 g1) and numerous mesopores, showing excellent activity for the ODHP reaction with ca. 20% propane conversion, 70% propene selectivity, and productivity of 1.75 gC3H6·gcat1·h1."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, these materials are known for their high specific surface area and suitable pore volume, which provide abundant sites to accommodate active B species. The confined space within these structures influences the reaction behavior of radicals, and the pore structure regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process. Incorporating B active components into these structures is achieved through various methods, including loading them onto the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials. These methods effectively construct 3-D B active sites. The 3-D monolith of BN is particularly noted for improving heat and mass transfer requirements, enhancing catalyst stability, and reducing pressure drop in the catalyst bed. The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of the BN/cordierite catalyst provides space for gas-phase radical reactions, leading to excellent catalytic performance. However, challenges exist, such as high pressure drops and poor mass transfer in catalyst pellets, which limit the large-scale application of certain B-supported catalysts. Modifications to the cordierite support, such as an additional silica coating layer, help to overcome these issues by attaching firmly to the substrate and the boron oxide layer. This modification enables a high B loading and achieves excellent olefin selectivity with negligible CO2. In addition, supported liquid-phase catalysts have been developed to integrate the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, demonstrating improved stability and selectivity. The metal-free 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite, for instance, exhibits high stability and selectivity for total olefin production. The structure of zeolites plays a critical role in the conversion of propane, affecting mass and heat transport. The 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite, for example, exhibits excellent catalytic performance due to its surface defect tricoordination B species. The use of solvent-free methods and the adjustment of hydrothermal synthesis conditions can also regulate the crystallinity of the zeolite, enhancing its performance in ODHP. The design of suitable 3D pore structures is crucial for optimizing mass transport behaviors, which in turn enhances catalytic performance. The 3-D cross macropore network of the BPO4(OM) catalyst effectively improves molecular diffusion and heat transfer, demonstrating its potential as a promising catalyst for ODHP. The h-BN bowl foam, with its large surface area and mesopores, exhibits excellent activity in ODHP reactions, achieving high propane conversion and propene selectivity, along with productivity exceeding industrial standards.
