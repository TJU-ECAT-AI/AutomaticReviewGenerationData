2.3. B Active Sites Located in or Bonded to the 3-D Framework of Porous Materials
The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas. (77) The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals. Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process. Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites.

2.3.1. 3-D Supported BN Active Sites
To meet the heat and mass transfer requirements of industrial applications, the 3-D monolith of BN is a potential and promising catalyst that improves the pressure drop of the catalyst bed and enhances its stability. (97)

2.3.2. 3-D Supported BOx Active Sites
When preparing a supported BOx catalyst on a 2-D carrier, because of the volatility and rapid loss of the B precursor, the maximum B loading on SiO2 is 2%, which restricts the improvement of the propene yield. Recently, Lus group (63) reported a novel approach to load boron oxide with a high loading of up to 30%, with the assistance of the 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite to anchor the boron oxide active sites (Figure 5b).

2.3.3. Bulk B-Based Catalysts with 3-D Dispersed Active Site Doped in the Framework of Porous Materials
Zeolites, a family of porous materials with a high specific surface area and uniform and tunable pore structure, are widely used in heterogeneous catalysis. By doping B species into zeolite frameworks, a 3-D dispersion of the B active site can be achieved.

2.3.4. Exploration of Active Sites on 3-D B Materials
The study of active sites on the surface of 2-D materials has shown that the agglomerated tricoordination oxidized B species are responsible for ODHP catalytic performance, which are further explored in 3-D B materials, such as supported boron oxide catalysts, (63,64) boron phosphate catalyst, (104) etc.

2.3. Classification of B-based Catalysts by the Dispersion Dimension of Active Sites
By classifying the reported catalysts from the perspective of the B dispersion dimension, the potential strategies to enhance the catalytic performances are revealed. The increasing active site dispersion dimension from 1-D to 2-D and 3-D significantly increases the density of available centers for the ODHP reaction.

Zeolites, with their high specific surface area and tunable pore structure, are extensively utilized in heterogeneous catalysis by doping B species to achieve a 3-D dispersion of the active site. The study of active sites on 2-D and 3-D B materials further elucidates the importance of the dispersion dimension in enhancing catalytic performance. The increasing dispersion dimension from 1-D to 2-D and 3-D significantly increases the density of available centers for the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons (ODHP) reaction, offering potential strategies to enhance catalytic performances.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involve porous structures and high specific surface areas. These features enhance catalytic performance by providing abundant sites for active B species and influencing the reaction behavior of radicals. The 3-D dispersion of active sites also regulates mass transport behaviors during the reaction process. Different methods are used to incorporate B active components into these structures, such as loading them on the surface of 3-D porous structures or doping them into the 3-D framework of porous materials. These methods are effective for various catalytic applications, offering higher utility of B active sites and constructing confined spaces that influence the reaction behavior of active radical intermediates and mass transport.

These materials are particularly useful for oxygen functionalized B sites and clusters, which achieve high olefin selectivity and low COx selectivity. The increasing dispersion dimension from 1-D to 3-D significantly increases the density of available centers for reactions. However, the interplay between the on-surface and off-surface channels needs to be controlled for catalyst design, considering the confinement's impact on radical termination and diffusion of reactants, intermediates, and products. Understanding and optimizing the spatial interaction of surface-active sites with gas-phase key intermediates can provide opportunities for developing catalysts for industrial applications.

[7] "The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of h-BN/cordierite also provided space for gas-phase radical reactions; thus, excellent catalytic performance was achieved with a 16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity toward propene, only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2 at 535 C, and a high gas hourly space velocity of 576000 mL gBN1 h1 (Figure 5)."
[8] "Although the aforementioned B2O3-supported catalysts on commercial SiO2 or SBA-15 support show excellent catalytic performance with high activity and olefin selectivity as well as industrialization potential, problems such as a high-pressure drop of the catalyst packing and poor mass transfer in the catalyst pellets may limit their large-scale application."
[9] "However, owing to the loss of surface hydroxyls under high temperature calcination (1400 C) during the cordierite production process, the interaction between bare cordierite and B was insufficient to immobilize the B species."
[10] "Therefore, the cordierite support was modified by an additional silica coating layer that could attach firmly to the cordierite substrate possibly by forming SiOAl, SiOMg, and SiOSi bonds and attach to the boron oxide layer via SiOB bonds."
[11] "With this catalyst system, a high B loading of up to 10 wt % was realized. Moreover, the catalyst achieved excellent olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under a high gas hourly space velocity of 345600 mL·gB2O31·h1."

[14] "This is because of the decrease of crystallinity of zeolite, as the content of B could be kept constant before and after the reaction."
[15] "During the cooling process, liquid B2O3 cooled and solidified into nanowires covering both the inside and outside of the 3-D BPO4 hollow sphere, forming sandwich-type B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres."
[16] "For the 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite reported by Lus group, (59) a considerable loss of activity occurred after the washing treatment because of the decrease in the defective trigonal B species."
[17] "By contrast, the BS-1 catalyst could maintain the catalytic activity after water treatment. The ICP analysis, N2 sorption, XRD pattern, SEM images, and TEM images verified that the 3-D zeolite structure was maintained and that B leaching was nearly negligible after the reaction."
[18] "To obtain an improved low-temperature ODHP performance of B-containing MFI-type zeolite, Qiu et al. (69) regulated the crystallinity of the zeolite by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions and prepared an incompletely crystallized MFI-type borosilicate zeolite catalyst."
[19] "In the ODHP reaction, the mass transport behaviors play an important role in the enhancement of catalytic performance, which makes the design of suitable 3D pore structures crucial."
[20] "The pore structure of BPO4(OM) was a 3-D cross macropore network, which could effectively improve molecular diffusion and heat transfer."
[21] "This 3-D h-BN bowl foam possessed a large surface area (524 m2 g1) and numerous mesopores, showing excellent activity for the ODHP reaction with ca. 20% propane conversion, 70% propene selectivity, and productivity of 1.75 gC3H6·gcat1·h1."
