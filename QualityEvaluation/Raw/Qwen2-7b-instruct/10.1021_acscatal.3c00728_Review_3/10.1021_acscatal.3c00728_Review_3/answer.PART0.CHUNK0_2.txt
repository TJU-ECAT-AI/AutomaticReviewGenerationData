Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals their enhanced catalytic performance due to the presence of high specific surface areas and suitable pore volumes. These features provide abundant sites for accommodating active B species and confining radical intermediates, regulating the reaction behavior. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through various methods, including loading on the surface of 3-D porous structures, doping into the 3-D framework, and embedding within the porous materials. Each method has its effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application. For instance, the 3-D monolith of BN offers improved pressure drop and stability, while the use of SBA-15 zeolite for supporting BOx catalysts allows for higher B loading, leading to improved performance at low temperatures. The 3-D dispersion of active sites within the zeolite frameworks further enhances the catalyst's selectivity and stability. The exploration of active sites on 3-D B materials suggests that the structure and arrangement of B species play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Understanding these interactions can guide the rational design of porous B-based catalysts for industrial applications.
