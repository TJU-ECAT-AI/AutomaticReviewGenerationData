[1] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."
[2] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."
[3] "As a result, the BS-1 catalyst is water tolerant, maintaining high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime, and this represents a large step forward in ODHP technology."
[4] "This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (figs. S37 and S38), giving good durability in the reaction process."
[5] "Amorphous boron oxide species with multiple boron nuclei in close proximity (e.g., BOB species) have been proposed as active sites, whereas the isolated boron in zeolite is regarded to be inactive."
[6] "However, we found that BS-1 had high activity, which differs substantially from previous knowledge."
[7] "The BS-1 catalyst had a first-order rate dependence with respect to propane partial pressure, whereas the supported boron and hBN had a second-order rate dependence (fig. S49)."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1), enhance catalytic performance by efficiently activating molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation while hindering full boron hydrolysis during catalysis. This allows the BS-1 catalyst to maintain high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime, demonstrating a significant advancement in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) technology. The active species are provided for the reaction and hinder full hydrolysis and dissolution, ensuring good durability in the reaction process. The isolation of boron species within the framework structure prevents the formation of BOB oligomers, which are commonly proposed as active sites in other catalysts. This unique approach contrasts with previous findings that suggested isolated boron in zeolite to be inactive. The kinetic parameters of the BS-1 catalyst exhibit a first-order rate dependence with respect to propane partial pressure, distinguishing it from generally supported boron and hexagonal carbon nitride (hBN) catalysts, which have a second-order rate dependence. These findings highlight the potential for rational design of efficient dehydrogenation catalysts by incorporating boron sites in a zeolite framework, considering the zeolite structure's role in enhancing both catalytic activity and durability.

在多维分散活性位点的孔框架（如沸石MFI结构）中的B基材料，通过有效地激活分子氧和丙烷以促进脱氢反应，同时阻止催化过程中硼的完全水解，从而提高了催化性能。这使得BS-1催化剂能够在连续测试中保持长时间的高活性和选择性，标志着氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）技术的一大进步。活性物种为反应提供服务，并阻止完全水解和溶解，确保反应过程中的良好耐用性。框架结构中隔离的硼物种防止了形成通常作为其他催化剂活性位点的BOB寡聚物。与之前的研究结果相反，这些结果表明，沸石中的孤立硼被认为可能是不活跃的。BS-1催化剂的反应动力学参数显示了与丙烷分压的一级速率依赖性，这与其他通常支持的硼和六方碳氮化物（hBN）催化剂的二级速率依赖性相区别。这些发现强调了通过在沸石框架中引入硼位点来合理设计高效脱氢催化剂的潜力，考虑到沸石结构在增强催化活性和耐用性方面的作用。
