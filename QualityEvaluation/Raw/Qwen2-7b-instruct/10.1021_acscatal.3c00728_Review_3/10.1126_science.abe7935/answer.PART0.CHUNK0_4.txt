[1] "We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
[2] "As a result, the BS-1 catalyst is water tolerant, maintaining high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime, and this represents a large step forward in ODHP technology."
[3] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180C for 3 days."
[4] "The BS-1 catalyst was active for the reaction, giving propane conversion with increasing reaction temperature."
[5] "For example, 23.8 and 41.4% of propane conversions were realized on the BS-1 catalyst at 540 and 560C, respectively."
[6] "The BS-1 catalyst retained this ability after the equivalent treatment."
[7] "Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce 10 vol% water in the gas."
[8] "The zeolite structure was maintained and boron leaching was almost negligible in the reaction for 208 hours, as confirmed by the ICP analysis, N2 sorption, XRD pattern, SEM images, and TEM images of the used catalyst."
[9] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy."
[10] "In addition, the framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals that the isolation of boron in zeolite enhances catalytic performance by preventing full hydrolysis and dissolution in humid atmospheres. The BS-1 catalyst, synthesized through a solvent-free crystallization process, demonstrates high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). This catalyst maintains its efficiency in continuous testing for a prolonged period, showcasing superior durability. The incorporation of boron into a zeolite framework ensures water tolerance, which is critical for maintaining high activity and selectivity. This method of incorporating boron into porous frameworks represents a significant advancement in ODHP technology, offering potential scalability for industrial applications.
