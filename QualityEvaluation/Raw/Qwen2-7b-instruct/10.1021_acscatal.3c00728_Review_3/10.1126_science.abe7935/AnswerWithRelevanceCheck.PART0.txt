          The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized through a solvent-free crystallization process involving tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days. After calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 was obtained with an Si/B ratio of 62. The catalyst's structure, characterized by XRD patterns and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibited typical MFI characteristics. Active in the reaction, the BS-1 catalyst showed increasing propane conversion with rising reaction temperature. For instance, at 540°C and 560°C, propane conversions of 23.8% and 41.4%, respectively, were achieved. Following equivalent treatment, the BS-1 catalyst maintained its ability. Further durability testing was conducted in a continuous oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%), which could produce up to 10 vol% water in the gas. The unique catalytic performance of BS-1 prompted an investigation into its structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Fresh BS-1 displayed a strong peak at 3.9 ppm, attributed to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework. The two-dimensional 11B1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of dehydrated BS-1 provided insights into the spatial relationships between boron and hydrogen species.

          BS-1 催化剂通过不含溶剂的结晶策略合成，涉及在 180°C 下从合成凝胶中使用四丙基铵（TPA+）氢氧化物，持续 3 天。通过在空气中煅烧去除有机模板，获得了 Si/B 比例为 62 的 BS-1。通过 X 射线衍射（XRD）模式和 N2 吸附等温线对催化剂结构进行表征，其特征符合 MFI 结构。该催化剂在反应中表现出活性，随着反应温度升高，丙烷转化率增加。例如，在 540°C 和 560°C 下，分别实现了 23.8% 和 41.4% 的丙烷转化率。经过等效处理后，BS-1 催化剂保留了其能力。进一步的耐用性测试是在高丙烷转化率（32.9 至 43.7%）的连续氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）测试中进行的，该测试可能会产生高达 10 体积% 的水。BS-1 的独特催化性能促使我们对其结构进行了调查，使用了 11B 魔角自旋（MAS）核磁共振（NMR）光谱。新鲜的 BS-1 显示出位于沸石骨架的 TO4 位置的四配位硼（B[4]）的强峰，其峰位于 3.9 ppm。干燥的 BS-1 的二维 11B1H 异核相关（HETCOR）光谱提供了有关硼和氢物种之间空间关系的见解。
