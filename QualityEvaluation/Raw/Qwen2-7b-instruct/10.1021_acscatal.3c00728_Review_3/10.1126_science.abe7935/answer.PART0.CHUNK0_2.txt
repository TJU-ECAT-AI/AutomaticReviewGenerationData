Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals several enhancements in catalytic performance. These materials typically feature boron species integrated into zeolite frameworks, which not only activate molecular oxygen and propane to facilitate dehydrogenation but also mitigate full boron hydrolysis, thereby improving durability. The incorporation of boron into these frameworks allows for the creation of active sites that can efficiently react with reactants while minimizing the risk of deactivation due to hydrolysis. This approach enhances the material's stability, especially in humid atmospheres and during prolonged reactions. Additionally, the presence of specific boron species, such as B[OHO(H)Si]2, contributes to the catalyst's high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The synergy between boron species and the surrounding zeolite structure optimizes the reaction pathway, reducing energy barriers and enhancing the overall catalytic efficiency.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures vary, but they often involve solvent-free crystallization strategies, impregnation techniques, or synthesis from gels containing specific precursors. The effectiveness of these methods depends on the desired properties of the final material, such as catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability. The document demonstrates the successful integration of boron into zeolite frameworks, showcasing the potential for developing efficient catalysts with enhanced water tolerance. This represents a significant advancement in boron catalysis, offering promising prospects for scalable applications in the production of olefins, particularly propene, from propane.

These findings suggest that by carefully designing the coordination environment around boron species within porous frameworks, it is possible to improve the catalytic performance of B-based materials. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of dehydrogenation reactions but also ensures the catalysts remain stable under challenging conditions, such as exposure to water vapor. The use of boron in zeolite frameworks provides a robust platform for developing new catalysts with tailored properties for specific industrial applications, potentially revolutionizing the production of olefins and other valuable chemical intermediates.
