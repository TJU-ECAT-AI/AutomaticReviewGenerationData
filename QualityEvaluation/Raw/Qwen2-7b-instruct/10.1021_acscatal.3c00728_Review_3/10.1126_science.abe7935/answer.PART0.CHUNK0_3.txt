[1] "We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
[2] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180C for 3 days. By calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 with an Si/B ratio of 62 was obtained."
[3] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."
[4] "The BS-1 catalyst retained this ability after the equivalent treatment (Fig. 1C)."
[5] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2A), where the fresh BS-1 exhibited a strong peak at 3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework (3134)."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, it is evident that the incorporation of boron species into zeolite frameworks enhances catalytic performance. The isolated boron species within the zeolite framework exhibit high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), with the ability to hinder full hydrolysis and dissolution due to the BOSiOx linkage. This feature allows for superior durability during long-term testing. The BS-1 catalyst, synthesized with a specific solvent-free crystallization process, showcases the potential for effective incorporation of boron species into zeolite structures. The unique arrangement of boron within the zeolite framework not only facilitates the activation of both molecular oxygen and propane but also impedes the full hydrolysis of boron species, contributing to the catalyst's remarkable stability and water tolerance.

These findings offer new insights into the rational design of efficient dehydrogenation catalysts by incorporating boron sites within porous frameworks. The utilization of boron in zeolite structures, particularly through the isolation of boron species, presents a promising avenue for enhancing catalytic performance and improving the durability of materials, especially in environments where water resistance is critical. This work represents a significant advancement in boron catalysis, potentially paving the way for scalable applications in the field of catalysis.

分析在多孔框架中具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料的结构特征，可以看出将硼物种引入沸石骨架中可以增强催化性能。在沸石框架中的孤立硼物种展现出高活性和选择性氧化脱氢反应（ODHP），并且能够阻止完整的水解和溶解，这归因于BOSiOx连接。这一特性允许在长期测试期间保持优异的稳定性。BS-1催化剂通过特定的溶剂自由结晶过程合成，展示了有效将硼物种引入沸石结构的潜力。在沸石框架内的硼的独特排列不仅促进分子氧和丙烷的活化，还阻碍了硼物种的完全水解，有助于催化剂的显著稳定性和耐水性。

这些发现为通过在多孔结构中引入硼位点合理设计高效脱氢催化剂提供了新的见解。特别是通过隔离硼物种，在沸石结构中使用硼提供了一种增强催化性能并改善材料耐用性的有前景的方法，特别是在需要防水的环境中。这项工作代表了硼催化领域的重要进展，可能引领规模化应用的道路。
