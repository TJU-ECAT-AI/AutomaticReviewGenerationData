[1] "The amount of coke accumulated on the PtSn/ZnAlO was slightly less than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst, and the transport of the coke from metallic sites to the support on PtSn/ZnAlO became easier than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst."
[2] "This study reveals that the stability of a PtSn/support catalyst depends on the type of PtSn alloy, relating to the coke transport phenomena, as evidenced by XPS."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for reactions and allowing for better diffusion of reactants and products. These features enable more efficient utilization of the active sites and facilitate faster reaction kinetics. The incorporation of B active components into these structures typically involves methods such as impregnation, co-precipitation, and deposition-precipitation. These methods vary in effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application and the desired properties of the final material. For instance, impregnation might be more suitable for achieving uniform dispersion of B across the material, while co-precipitation could be better for controlling the size and morphology of the active sites.
