The study aimed to explore the connection between the stability of PtSn catalysts and the properties of the PtSn bimetallic alloys. Through various analytical techniques, the researchers found that the distinct PtSn alloy compositions on the catalysts influenced the coke mobility. This, in turn, significantly affected the catalyst's stability. The addition of tin as a promoter notably reduced coke formation. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed superior stability compared to the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, primarily due to the enhanced coke mobility from the metal surface to the support, as evidenced by XPS measurements.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for reactions and allowing for better diffusion of reactants and products. These features enable more efficient utilization of the active sites and facilitate faster reaction kinetics. The incorporation of B active components into these structures typically involves methods such as impregnation, co-precipitation, and deposition-precipitation. These methods vary in effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application and the desired properties of the final material. For instance, impregnation might be more suitable for achieving uniform dispersion of B across the material, while co-precipitation could be better for controlling the size and morphology of the active sites.

3.1. Reaction tests
For all of the catalysts, the selectivity decreased gradually with decreasing propane conversion. Under a longer TOS, the propane conversion decreased while the coke deposits on the catalysts were generated through cracking, hydrogenolysis, and pyrolysis, resulting in a small decrease in propylene selectivity.

3.2. Adsorption measurements
The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of Al2O3, PtSn/Al, ZnAl2O4, and PtSn/ZnAlO were irreversible type IV isotherms of mesoporous materials with a well-defined hysteresis loop of type H2.

3.3. XRD measurement
The calcination temperature (550 C) in our experiment was sufficiently high to form the metallic Pt phase. In addition to the metallic Pt phase, the gamma phase of Al2O3 (PDF No.: 00-029-0063) and ZnAl2O4 (PDF No.: 00-005-0669) were also detected in the calcined catalysts.

3.4. HRTEM and EDX measurements
FFT was applied to compute the lattice spacing of the crystallite. The FFT image (inset of Fig. 5 A) exhibits the lattice spacings of 0.14 and 0.23 nm1 that correspond to the (2 0 0) and (1 1 1) reflection planes of the Pt3Sn alloy, respectively.

3.5. XPS measurement
The quantitative results for XPS are shown in Table 2 . On the PtSn/Al catalysts, the Pt/Al and Snal(0)/Al ratio declined, while the SnS/Al ratio increased as the reaction time increased from 0 to 240 min.

The study compared the catalytic performance of PtSn/Al2O3 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed a stronger tolerance for catalytic deactivation. The enhanced stability of PtSn/ZnAl2O4 was attributed to the faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support. The formation of PtSn and Pt3Sn alloys on the catalysts during the reaction varied depending on the support type. On the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, both PtSn and Pt3Sn alloys were observed, while only the PtSn alloy was present on the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst. The Pt3Sn phase was dominant on the spent PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, whereas the PtSn phase remained unchanged on the spent PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst after reactions for 160 and 240 minutes. Different bimetallic alloy formations and phase transitions in the PtSn catalysts led to different coke mobilities.

Catalyst stability depended on the type of PtSn alloy, which influenced the coke transport phenomena. The coke generated in propane dehydrogenation consisted of polyaromatic rings containing sp2 hybridization carbon. The mobility of coke was related to the interactions between metallic sites and coke formed; strong interactions led to weak mobility, and vice versa. Specifically, a high electron density of Pt particles played an important role in weakening Pt-(CC) bonds and repelling coke precursors. The temperature-programmed desorption experiments revealed that desorption of the π-bond molecules on the unsupported PtSn alloy became progressively easier than those on the unsupported Pt3Sn alloy.

The incorporation of B active components into porous frameworks could enhance catalytic performance due to their unique properties, such as high surface area, stability, and ability to create 3-D dispersed active sites. The methods used to incorporate B active components included impregnation, coprecipitation, and deposition-precipitation. The effectiveness of these methods varied depending on the specific catalytic application and the desired properties of the catalyst, such as stability, activity, and selectivity.

The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of Al2O3, PtSn/Al, ZnAl2O4, and PtSn/ZnAlO were irreversible type IV isotherms of mesoporous materials with a well-defined hysteresis loop of type H2. This observation indicated that their pore structure had pores with interconnecting channels or wormholes or sponge-like appearance. The surface area of the Al2O3 support was twice as much as that of ZnAl2O4 support, yet the Pt dispersion measured by CO chemisorption was lower on the PtSn/Al catalysts compared to the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst.

The XRD patterns of calcined PtSn/Al and PtSn/ZnAlO catalysts showed the presence of the Pt metal phase, gamma phase of Al2O3, and ZnAl2O4. Upon reduction, the metallic Pt nearly combined with metallic Sn to form PtSn alloys. The XRD patterns of the reduced catalysts showed the formation of PtSn and Pt3Sn phases on the PtSn/Al catalyst, while PtSn and PtZn phases formed on the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst. The existence of the PtZn alloy phase on the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst indicated a strong interaction between Pt particles and the ZnAl2O4 support.

The HRTEM micrographs and corresponding FFTs of PtSn/Al and PtSn/ZnAlO catalysts revealed the presence of individual particles with clear lattice fringes. The lattice spacings of the crystallites were consistent with the (2 0 0) and (1 1 1) reflection planes of the Pt3Sn alloy on the PtSn/Al catalyst and the (1 1 0), (1 0 1), and (1 0 0) reflection planes of the PtSn alloy on the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst. The elemental compositions of the particles were analyzed by EDX, indicating the presence of Pt and Sn on the PtSn/Al catalyst and the presence of Pt, Sn, and Zn on the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst. The Pt/Sn atomic ratio increased as the reaction time increased from 0 to 240 min on the PtSn/Al catalyst, while the Pt/Sn ratio was too complicated to achieve for the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst due to the difficulty in excluding Zn from the ZnAl2O4 support.

The XPS spectra of Pt 4f and Sn 3d levels for the PtSn/Al and PtSn/ZnAlO catalysts showed that the peak intensity of Pt 4f decreased compared to the peak intensity of Al 2p on the PtSn/Al catalysts, while the peak intensity of Pt 4f increased rapidly with the reaction time on the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst. The quantitative results for XPS indicated that the Pt/Al and Snal(0)/Al ratio declined, while the SnS/Al ratio increased on the PtSn/Al catalysts as the reaction time increased from 0 to 240 min. In contrast, the Pt/Al and Snal(0)/Al ratio increased, while the SnS/Al ratio decreased remarkably during the same reaction time on the PtSn/ZnAlO catalysts.

研究对比了在丙烷脱氢过程中，PtSn/Al2O3和PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂的催化性能。PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂在催化失活方面表现出更强的耐受性。增强PtSn/ZnAl2O4稳定性的原因归因于焦炭从金属表面到支撑物的更快移动性。催化剂上形成的PtSn和Pt3Sn合金在反应期间有所不同，取决于支持类型。在PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上，观察到了PtSn和Pt3Sn两种合金，而在PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂上仅发现了PtSn合金。在反应后160和240分钟，PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上的Pt3Sn相占主导地位，而PtSn相在PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂上保持不变。不同双金属合金形成和相转换导致了不同的焦炭流动性。

催化剂稳定性取决于PtSn合金的类型，这影响了焦炭传输现象。生成的焦炭由聚芳香环组成，包含sp2杂化的碳。焦炭的流动性与金属点和形成焦炭之间的相互作用有关；强相互作用导致弱流动性，反之亦然。特别是，Pt颗粒的高电子密度在削弱Pt-(CC)键并排斥焦炭前体中起着重要作用。温度程序脱附实验揭示了在非支持PtSn合金上脱附的π键分子比在非支持Pt3Sn合金上更容易。

将B活性成分引入孔框架可以增强催化性能，因为它们具有独特的特性，如高表面积、稳定性和能够创建三维分散活性位点的能力。引入B活性成分的方法包括浸渍、共沉淀和沉积-沉淀。这些方法的有效性根据特定催化应用以及催化剂所需特性的不同而变化，如稳定性、活性和选择性。

Al2O3、PtSn/Al、ZnAl2O4和PtSn/ZnAlO的N2吸附-解吸等温线是不可逆的类型IV等温线，具有定义明确的H2型滞后环。这一观察表明其孔结构具有相互连接的通道或蠕虫孔或海绵状外观。Al2O3支持的表面积是ZnAl2O4支持的两倍，但由CO化学吸附测量得到的Pt分布较低，PtSn/Al催化剂低于PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂。

在煅烧的PtSn/Al和PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂的XRD模式中，可以观察到Pt金属相、Al2O3的γ相和ZnAl2O4。在还原后，金属Pt几乎与金属Sn结合形成PtSn合金。在减少的催化剂的XRD模式中，可以观察到PtSn和Pt3Sn相在PtSn/Al催化剂上形成，而PtSn和PtZn相在PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂上形成。存在PtZn合金相在PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂上表明Pt颗粒与ZnAl2O4支持之间存在强烈相互作用。

在PtSn/Al和PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂的HRTEM微图及其相应的FFT中，可以发现清晰的晶格条纹的个体粒子。晶格间距与PtSn合金的（2 0 0）和（1 1 1）反射平面一致。PtSn/Al催化剂上Pt3Sn合金的晶格间距与PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂上（1 1 0）、（1 0 1）和（1 0 0）反射平面一致。通过EDX对粒子的元素组成进行了分析，显示Pt和Sn存在于PtSn/Al催化剂上，而Pt、Sn和Zn存在于PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂上。随着反应时间从0增加到240分钟，PtSn/Al催化剂上的Pt/Sn原子比增加，而PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂上难以实现Pt/Sn原子比，这是由于从ZnAl2O4支持排除Zn的困难。

XPS谱图中的Pt 4f和Sn 3d水平显示，在PtSn/Al催化剂上，Pt 4f峰的强度与Al 2p峰的强度相比降低，而在PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂上，随着反应时间的增加，Pt 4f峰的强度迅速增加。定量结果为XPS表明，随着反应时间从0增加到240分钟，PtSn/Al催化剂上的Pt/Al和Snal(0)/Al比率下降，而SnS/Al比率增加。相比之下，PtSn/ZnAlO催化剂上Pt/Al和Snal(0)/Al比率增加，而SnS/Al比率在相同反应时间内显著下降。

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these features enhance catalytic performance. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through various methods, including impregnation, precipitation, and ion-exchange. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For instance, in the context of propane dehydrogenation, the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed superior tolerance for catalytic deactivation compared to the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. This was attributed to the relatively faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support, which was proven by XPS measurement. The different bimetallic alloy formations and phase transitions in the PtSn catalysts caused different coke mobilities, leading to improved stability of the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials, such as 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, enable enhanced catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for reactions and facilitating more efficient diffusion of reactants and products. The incorporation of B active components into these materials is crucial for achieving optimal catalytic activity and selectivity. The effectiveness of the incorporation methods depends on factors such as the nature of the support material, the desired loading of the active component, and the specific catalytic application.

The study demonstrates that the stability of a PtSn/support catalyst depends on the type of PtSn alloy, which relates to the coke transport phenomena. The dominant Pt3Sn alloy in the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst leads to faster deactivation compared to the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst. This is due to the easier transport of coke from metallic sites to the support on the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst, which facilitates a higher tolerance for catalytic deactivation. This finding underscores the importance of considering the structural characteristics and the type of alloy formed when designing catalysts for specific applications, particularly in terms of their stability and efficiency in handling coke mobility.

分析基于B的材料的三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特性，涉及理解这些特征如何增强催化性能。将B活性成分引入这些结构通常通过多种方法实现，包括浸渍、沉淀和离子交换。这些方法的有效性根据特定的催化应用而有所不同。例如，在丙烷脱氢化过程中，PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂的耐催化失活能力比PtSn/Al2O3催化剂更强，这是通过XPS测量证明的，归因于从金属表面到支撑物的相对更快的焦炭移动性。PtSn催化剂的不同二金属合金形成和相转变导致不同的焦炭移动性，从而提高了PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂的稳定性。

基于B的材料的结构特性，如三维分散在多孔框架中的活性位点，通过提供更大的反应表面和更有效的反应物和产物扩散，增强了催化性能。将B活性成分引入这些材料对于实现最佳催化活性和选择性至关重要。各种方法的有效性取决于支持材料的性质、所需活性成分的负载以及具体催化应用等因素。

研究结果表明，PtSn支持催化剂的稳定性取决于形成的PtSn合金的类型，这与焦炭运输现象有关。在PtSn/Al2O3催化剂中占主导地位的Pt3Sn合金导致与PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂相比更快的失活。这是由于PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂中从金属位点到支撑物的焦炭更容易移动，这促进了对催化失活更强的容忍度。这一发现强调了在设计特定应用（尤其是考虑焦炭移动性和稳定性）时考虑结构特性和形成的合金的重要性。
