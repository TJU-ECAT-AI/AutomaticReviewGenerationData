[1] "Both PtSn/Al and PtSn/ZnAlO catalysts exhibited deactivation with time on the stream; however, the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst showed a higher tolerance for deactivation than the PtSn/Al catalyst."
[2] "The PtSn and Pt3Sn alloy in the reduced and spent catalysts exhibited homogeneity without coreshell structures."
[3] "The amount of coke accumulated on the PtSn/ZnAlO was slightly less than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst, and the transport of the coke from metallic sites to the support on PtSn/ZnAlO became easier than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst."
[4] "Therefore, the stability of a PtSn/support catalyst depends on the type of PtSn alloy, relating to the coke transport phenomena, as evidenced by XPS."

This study demonstrates that the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance. The incorporation of B active components into these structures through various methods allows for optimized catalytic applications. The literature highlights the importance of the PtSn alloy type in determining the stability of a PtSn/support catalyst, with the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst showing superior tolerance for deactivation due to more efficient coke transport from metallic sites to the support. This finding underscores the critical role of alloy structure in catalytic efficiency.
