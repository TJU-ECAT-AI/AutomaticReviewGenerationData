[1] "The primary production method of propylene in the petrochemical industry is naphtha cracking, wherein ethylene is co-produced."
[2] "To better understand the relationship between the catalytic stability and the PtSn bimetallic alloy system, the PtSn bimetallic phases were investigated through CO chemisorption, XRD, XPS, TPR, and HRTEM with fresh and spent catalysts."
[3] "Both PtSn and Pt3Sn alloys were formed on the reduced PtSn/Al2O3, while only the PtSn alloy was observed on the reduced PtSn/ZnAl2O4."
[4] "The formation of the PtSn alloy with various Pt/Sn atomic ratios (0.21.78) on the ZnAl2O4 support was also examined in a previous report, and it is noted that the most stable alloy was PtSn, in addition to a trace amount of Pt2Sn3."
[5] "The mobility of coke is related to interactions between the metallic sites and coke formed; strong interactions lead to weak mobility, and vice versa."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these features enhance catalytic performance. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through various methods, including impregnation, precipitation, and ion-exchange. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For instance, in the context of propane dehydrogenation, the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed superior tolerance for catalytic deactivation compared to the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. This was attributed to the relatively faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support, which was proven by XPS measurement. The different bimetallic alloy formations and phase transitions in the PtSn catalysts caused different coke mobilities, leading to improved stability of the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials, such as 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, enable enhanced catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for reactions and facilitating more efficient diffusion of reactants and products. The incorporation of B active components into these materials is crucial for achieving optimal catalytic activity and selectivity. The effectiveness of the incorporation methods depends on factors such as the nature of the support material, the desired loading of the active component, and the specific catalytic application.

The study demonstrates that the stability of a PtSn/support catalyst depends on the type of PtSn alloy, which relates to the coke transport phenomena. The dominant Pt3Sn alloy in the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst leads to faster deactivation compared to the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst. This is due to the easier transport of coke from metallic sites to the support on the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst, which facilitates a higher tolerance for catalytic deactivation. This finding underscores the importance of considering the structural characteristics and the type of alloy formed when designing catalysts for specific applications, particularly in terms of their stability and efficiency in handling coke mobility.

分析基于B的材料的三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特性，涉及理解这些特征如何增强催化性能。将B活性成分引入这些结构通常通过多种方法实现，包括浸渍、沉淀和离子交换。这些方法的有效性根据特定的催化应用而有所不同。例如，在丙烷脱氢化过程中，PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂的耐催化失活能力比PtSn/Al2O3催化剂更强，这是通过XPS测量证明的，归因于从金属表面到支撑物的相对更快的焦炭移动性。PtSn催化剂的不同二金属合金形成和相转变导致不同的焦炭移动性，从而提高了PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂的稳定性。

基于B的材料的结构特性，如三维分散在多孔框架中的活性位点，通过提供更大的反应表面和更有效的反应物和产物扩散，增强了催化性能。将B活性成分引入这些材料对于实现最佳催化活性和选择性至关重要。各种方法的有效性取决于支持材料的性质、所需活性成分的负载以及具体催化应用等因素。

研究结果表明，PtSn支持催化剂的稳定性取决于形成的PtSn合金的类型，这与焦炭运输现象有关。在PtSn/Al2O3催化剂中占主导地位的Pt3Sn合金导致与PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂相比更快的失活。这是由于PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂中从金属位点到支撑物的焦炭更容易移动，这促进了对催化失活更强的容忍度。这一发现强调了在设计特定应用（尤其是考虑焦炭移动性和稳定性）时考虑结构特性和形成的合金的重要性。
