[1] "To better understand the relationship between the catalytic stability and the PtSn bimetallic alloy system, the PtSn bimetallic phases were investigated through CO chemisorption, XRD, XPS, TPR, and HRTEM with fresh and spent catalysts."
[2] "The different PtSn alloy phases led to differences in the coke mobility over the catalysts and eventually had a strong effect on the catalyst stability."
[3] "The addition of Sn as a promoter apparently lessened the coke generation."
[4] "With the Al2O3 support, the coke contents were 4.1 and 6.1 wt% whereas the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst generated only 2.5 and 4.9 wt% coke."
[5] "This indicates that the high catalytic stability of PtSn/ZnAl2O4 originates from the relatively faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support, which was proven by XPS measurement."

The study aimed to explore the connection between the stability of PtSn catalysts and the properties of the PtSn bimetallic alloys. Through various analytical techniques, the researchers found that the distinct PtSn alloy compositions on the catalysts influenced the coke mobility. This, in turn, significantly affected the catalyst's stability. The addition of tin as a promoter notably reduced coke formation. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed superior stability compared to the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, primarily due to the enhanced coke mobility from the metal surface to the support, as evidenced by XPS measurements.

研究旨在探究铂锡合金体系的稳定性与PtSn双金属相之间的关系。通过多种分析技术，研究人员发现催化剂上的不同PtSn合金组成影响了焦炭的移动性。这最终对催化剂的稳定性产生了重要影响。锡的添加作为促进剂显著减少了焦炭的生成。PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂在稳定性上优于PtSn/Al2O3催化剂，主要原因是焦炭从金属表面向支撑体的移动性增强，这一结果通过XPS测量得到证实。
