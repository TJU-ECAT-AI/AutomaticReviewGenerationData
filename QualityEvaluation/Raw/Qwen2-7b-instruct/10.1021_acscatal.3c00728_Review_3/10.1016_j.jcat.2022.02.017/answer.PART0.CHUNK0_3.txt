[Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers.]

[Borosilicate zeolites with homogeneous distribution of boron have been proved as the promising catalyst in ODHP reaction and the micro-environment of boron species is the dominant factor for the catalytic properties.]

[Our previous work shows that the boroxol ring and the tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species in BOS (B2O3/SBA-15) catalysts are responsible for the low-temperature ODHP reaction and boron sites with more OH groups are easier to dehydrogenate by dioxygen.]

[Lately, the isolated boron (B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate MFI-type zeolite shows superior durability with olefin productivity of 0.2 golefin gcat1 h1, and the hydrogen bond formed between BOH with adjacent SiOH facilitates the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane.]

[While a higher reaction temperature (up to 560 C) is required to achieve substantial olefin productivity over such isolated boron sites.]

[In this work, a series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared, and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction.]

[It turned out to be that the catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature.]

[The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions.]

[The incomplete crystallization could enrich the defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, which were responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts.]

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the unique architecture of these materials enhances catalytic performance. The literature indicates that borosilicate zeolites, which possess a homogeneous distribution of boron, serve as effective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The microenvironment around boron species within these materials plays a crucial role in their catalytic properties, suggesting that the spatial arrangement and coordination of boron atoms significantly influence the reaction kinetics and selectivity.

The incorporation of B active components into these porous frameworks often involves controlling the synthesis conditions, particularly the hydrothermal treatment parameters. By regulating the crystallinity through these conditions, researchers can tailor the structure of the boron-containing catalysts to optimize the presence of defect boron sites, which are found to be essential for catalytic activity in ODHP reactions. These defect sites, characterized by hydrogen bonding interactions with adjacent silanols, contribute to the enhanced catalytic performance observed at lower temperatures.

Furthermore, the literature highlights the importance of boron species having more OH groups, as they facilitate the dehydrogenation process by dioxygen. This finding underscores the design principle that boron-containing catalysts should exhibit well-dispersed and accessible active boron sites, which are crucial for achieving high catalytic efficiency and selectivity in ODHP reactions.

The methods employed to incorporate B active components into porous frameworks vary depending on the specific application. Techniques such as high-temperature steam activation, nano-structural engineering, and synthesis of high surface area catalysts are mentioned as strategies to maximize the number of oxygenated boron species. However, the literature emphasizes that simply increasing boron loading might not necessarily lead to the creation of more active sites due to issues such as agglomeration or leaching.

In summary, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are designed to enhance catalytic performance through the strategic placement and coordination of boron species. The literature demonstrates the effectiveness of controlling synthesis conditions to optimize the presence of defect boron sites, which are crucial for achieving high catalytic efficiency and selectivity in ODHP reactions, particularly at lower temperatures. The incorporation of boron active components into these materials is facilitated through various methods tailored to the desired catalytic application, highlighting the importance of a balanced approach to ensure optimal dispersion and accessibility of active boron sites.

分析硼基材料中三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特征，旨在理解这些独特架构如何增强催化性能。文献表明，硼硅酸盐沸石作为氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）的活性催化剂，提供了一个理想的平台来探索含硼催化剂的催化活性起源以及构建高效硼中心的方法。硼硅酸盐沸石中均匀分布的硼被认为是ODHP反应的有前景的催化剂，而硼物种的微观环境是催化性能的主要决定因素。

含硼成分的整合到这些多孔框架中往往涉及到控制合成条件，特别是水热处理参数。通过调节结晶性，研究人员可以调整硼含量催化剂的结构，以优化缺陷硼位点的存在，发现这些缺陷位点对于在较低温度下进行ODHP反应至关重要。这些缺陷位点通过与相邻硅醇的氢键作用，丰富了氢键相互作用，从而对BMFI催化剂的优越催化活性负责。

此外，文献强调了拥有更多OH基团的硼物种的重要性，因为它们通过氧和丙烷的协同转化促进脱氢过程。这一发现强调了设计原则，即含硼催化剂应展现出均匀分散且易于访问的活性硼位点，这对于实现高催化效率和选择性ODHP反应至关重要。

不同方法用于整合含硼活性成分到多孔框架中，具体取决于特定的应用。高温度蒸汽活化、纳米结构工程和高表面积催化剂合成等策略被提及，作为最大化氧硼物种数量的策略。然而，文献强调，仅仅增加硼载荷可能不一定能产生更多的活性位点，因为可能会出现聚集或泄漏的问题。

总之，硼基材料中三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特征通过战略性地放置和协调硼物种来增强催化性能。文献展示了通过控制合成条件优化缺陷硼位点的存在，从而实现高催化效率和ODHP反应选择性的方法，特别是在较低温度下。整合硼活性成分到这些材料中是根据特定催化应用定制的方法，突出了确保最佳分散性和活性硼位点可访问性的重要性。
