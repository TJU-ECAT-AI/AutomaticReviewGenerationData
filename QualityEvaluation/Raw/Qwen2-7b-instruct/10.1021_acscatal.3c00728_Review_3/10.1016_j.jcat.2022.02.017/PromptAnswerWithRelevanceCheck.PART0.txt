Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the unique distribution of boron species within these frameworks enhances catalytic performance. The document highlights that the presence of oxygenated boron sites at the surfaces of materials like h-BN and other boron-containing catalysts plays a crucial role in catalyzing oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. Strategies aimed at maximizing the number of oxygen-containing boron species, such as Na-assisted high-temperature steam activation, nano-structural engineering, and synthesis of high surface area catalysts, have been explored to improve catalytic performance.

The study of borosilicate zeolites with homogeneous boron distribution reveals that the micro-environment surrounding boron species is a key determinant of their catalytic properties. The document points out that isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are found to be inactive in ODHP reactions. Conversely, defect boron sites are essential for catalyzing ODHP reactions, and aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation compared to isolated species. The incorporation of boron sites with more OH groups has been shown to facilitate dehydrogenation by dioxygen, indicating the importance of hydroxyl-rich environments.

The document further discusses the feasibility of constructing highly active boron centers by anchoring boron species uniformly onto hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrices in an oligomeric form. It explains that the use of hydrothermal synthesis conditions to regulate the crystallinity of zeolite catalysts leads to catalysts with low crystallinity, which exhibit superior activity and higher olefin productivity at lower temperatures. The structural characterization reveals that incomplete crystallization enriches defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, which are responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity of these BMFI catalysts.

To summarize, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance through optimized boron distribution, effective utilization of oxygenated boron sites, and strategic incorporation of boron into hydroxyl-rich environments. The methods employed involve manipulating the crystallinity of zeolite catalysts to enrich defect boron sites and anchor boron species in a manner conducive to catalytic activity.

分析硼基材料中三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特征涉及理解这些框架内硼物种的独特分布如何增强催化性能。文档强调，材料表面的氧化的硼位点，如h-BN和其他含硼催化剂，对于催化氧化脱氢（ODH）反应起着关键作用。为了提高催化性能，探索了诸如Na辅助高温蒸汽活化、纳米结构工程和合成高表面积催化剂等策略。

研究发现，具有均一分布的硼硅酸盐沸石作为ODHP反应的有前景催化剂，微环境中的硼物种是决定其催化性质的关键因素。文档指出，完全包含在沸石框架中的B(OSi)3单体被发现对ODHP反应无活性。相反，缺陷硼位点对于催化ODHP反应至关重要，聚合硼物种比孤立物种更有效地激活CH键。具有更多OH基团的硼站点被证明可以更容易地通过二氧进行脱氢，这表明羟基丰富环境的重要性。

文档进一步讨论了通过将硼物种均匀锚定到富含羟基的MFI型沸石矩阵中来构建高度活性硼中心的可能性。解释了通过调节水热合成条件来调节沸石催化剂结晶性导致低结晶性催化剂的优越活性和低温下更高的烯烃产率。结构表征揭示了不完全结晶化富集了与相邻硅醇键合的缺陷硼位点，这些位点对BMFI催化剂的增强催化活性负责。

综上所述，硼基材料中三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特征通过优化硼分布、有效利用氧化的硼位点以及将硼适当地引入富含羟基环境中来增强催化性能。采用的方法包括调节沸石催化剂的结晶性以丰富缺陷硼位点并锚定硼物种以促进催化活性。

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are highlighted by their ability to anchor boron species to the zeolite matrix through open coordination, facilitated by abundant SiOH groups on the surface. This mechanism enhances catalytic performance by inhibiting excessive boron leaching and allowing dynamic transformation of isolated boron species into aggregated forms, which are more efficient in CH bond activation. The incorporation of boron components into these structures is achieved through hydrothermal synthesis conditions that regulate crystallinity, leading to the enrichment of defect boron sites that are essential for catalytic activity.

The structural characteristics of boron-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as borosilicate zeolites, enhance catalytic performance through the unique arrangement and coordination of boron species within the zeolite matrix. This allows for efficient interaction with reactants like propane during oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP). The use of incomplete crystallization in the synthesis of these materials enriches the defect boron sites, which are essential for catalytic activity. These defect sites are often coordinated with adjacent silanol groups via hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the boron species and preventing excessive leaching. The presence of active boron species, such as BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups, acts as the active center for the ODHP reaction at low temperatures. This configuration facilitates the selective activation of CH bonds in propane, leading to the production of olefins.

The effectiveness of incorporating boron active components into these structures varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For ODHP, the construction of highly active boron centers through the strategic placement of boron species within the zeolite matrix is crucial. The methods used typically involve adjusting the synthesis conditions to control the degree of crystallinity, which influences the distribution and stability of boron species. The use of incomplete crystallization has proven effective in enhancing the catalytic efficiency of boron-containing materials due to its ability to enrich defect boron sites with hydrogen-bonded boron species. These sites are more efficient in catalyzing the ODHP reaction at lower temperatures compared to isolated boron species.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the unique architecture of these materials enhances catalytic performance. The literature indicates that borosilicate zeolites, which possess a homogeneous distribution of boron, serve as effective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The microenvironment around boron species within these materials plays a crucial role in their catalytic properties, suggesting that the spatial arrangement and coordination of boron atoms significantly influence the reaction kinetics and selectivity.

The incorporation of B active components into these porous frameworks often involves controlling the synthesis conditions, particularly the hydrothermal treatment parameters. By regulating the crystallinity through these conditions, researchers can tailor the structure of the boron-containing catalysts to optimize the presence of defect boron sites, which are found to be essential for catalytic activity in ODHP reactions. These defect sites, characterized by hydrogen bonding interactions with adjacent silanols, contribute to the enhanced catalytic performance observed at lower temperatures.

Furthermore, the literature highlights the importance of boron species having more OH groups, as they facilitate the dehydrogenation process by dioxygen. This finding underscores the design principle that boron-containing catalysts should exhibit well-dispersed and accessible active boron sites, which are crucial for achieving high catalytic efficiency and selectivity in ODHP reactions.

The methods employed to incorporate B active components into porous frameworks vary depending on the specific application. Techniques such as high-temperature steam activation, nano-structural engineering, and synthesis of high surface area catalysts are mentioned as strategies to maximize the number of oxygenated boron species. However, the literature emphasizes that simply increasing boron loading might not necessarily lead to the creation of more active sites due to issues such as agglomeration or leaching.

In summary, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are designed to enhance catalytic performance through the strategic placement and coordination of boron species. The literature demonstrates the effectiveness of controlling synthesis conditions to optimize the presence of defect boron sites, which are crucial for achieving high catalytic efficiency and selectivity in ODHP reactions, particularly at lower temperatures. The incorporation of boron active components into these materials is facilitated through various methods tailored to the desired catalytic application, highlighting the importance of a balanced approach to ensure optimal dispersion and accessibility of active boron sites.
