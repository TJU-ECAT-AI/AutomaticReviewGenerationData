[Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers.]
[The catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited excellent catalytic efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.]
[A combination of solid-state NMR, dual-beam FTIR, and in-situ DRIFT measurements reveal that the boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in the form of open coordination.]
[Meanwhile, the ample SiOH groups on the surface facilitate the formation of hydrogen bonds with the BOH in defective boron species and inhibit the excessive leaching of boron.]
[During the ODHP process, the isolated boron species would dynamically transform into aggregated ones, being closely related to the increased catalytic activity.]
[The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature.]

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as borosilicate zeolites, enhance catalytic performance through the unique arrangement of boron species within the zeolite matrix. These materials, especially when incompletely crystallized, exhibit superior activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to the presence of defect boron sites and the ability to anchor boron species in open coordination with the zeolite matrix. This arrangement facilitates the formation of hydrogen bonds with adjacent silanols, inhibiting boron leaching while maintaining its reactivity. The transformation of isolated boron species into aggregated forms during the ODHP process increases catalytic activity. The active centers identified as BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups demonstrate high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reactions at low temperatures.

在多维分散活性位点的孔框架中的B基材料，如硼硅酸盐沸石，通过在其沸石骨架内的硼物种的独特排列来增强催化性能。特别是当这些材料不完全结晶时，在沸石矩阵中锚定硼物种的特性显示出了在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中出色的活性。由于存在缺陷硼位点和硼与沸石矩阵之间形成开放配合物的能力，这种排列促进了与相邻硅醇的氢键形成，同时抑制了硼的流失，从而保持其活性。在ODHP过程中，孤立的硼物种转化为聚合形式，增加了催化活性。识别为聚合BOx物种中与相邻SiOH基团氢键结合的BOH基团作为低温下催化ODHP反应的活性中心，显示出了高效率。
