The structural characteristics of boron-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as borosilicate zeolites, enhance catalytic performance through the unique arrangement and coordination of boron species within the zeolite matrix. This allows for efficient interaction with reactants like propane during oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP). The use of incomplete crystallization in the synthesis of these materials enriches the defect boron sites, which are essential for catalytic activity. These defect sites are often coordinated with adjacent silanol groups via hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the boron species and preventing excessive leaching. The presence of active boron species, such as BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups, acts as the active center for the ODHP reaction at low temperatures. This configuration facilitates the selective activation of CH bonds in propane, leading to the production of olefins.

The effectiveness of incorporating boron active components into these structures varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For ODHP, the construction of highly active boron centers through the strategic placement of boron species within the zeolite matrix is crucial. The methods used typically involve adjusting the synthesis conditions to control the degree of crystallinity, which influences the distribution and stability of boron species. The use of incomplete crystallization has proven effective in enhancing the catalytic efficiency of boron-containing materials due to its ability to enrich defect boron sites with hydrogen-bonded boron species. These sites are more efficient in catalyzing the ODHP reaction at lower temperatures compared to isolated boron species.

硼基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔框架中的结构特征通过在其沸石骨架内的硼物种的独特排列和协调，增强了催化性能。这允许在氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中与反应物如丙烷进行有效交互。通过合成过程中控制结晶度，可以丰富缺陷硼位点，这些位点对于催化剂活性至关重要。这些缺陷位点通常通过氢键与相邻硅醇基团协同作用，稳定硼物种并防止其过度流失。具有活性硼物种（如在聚合BOx物种中与相邻SiOH基团通过氢键相互作用的BOH基团）作为低温下催化ODHP反应的活性中心。这种配置使丙烷中的CH键的有效激活成为可能，从而产生烯烃。

根据不同催化应用的有效性因方法而异。对于ODHP，构建高活性硼中心的关键是通过精确放置硼物种于沸石骨架内。这些方法通常涉及调整合成条件以控制结晶度，这影响了硼物种的分布和稳定性。通过不完全结晶化的方法增强硼含材料的催化效率，由于它能够丰富氢键结合的硼位点。这些位点在低温下催化ODHP反应时比孤立的硼位点更有效。
