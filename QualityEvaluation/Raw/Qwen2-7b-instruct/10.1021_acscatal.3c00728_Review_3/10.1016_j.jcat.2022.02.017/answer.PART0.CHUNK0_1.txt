[1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."
[2] "Herein, we report that the incompletely crystallized MFI-type borosilicate zeolite catalyst displays extraordinary performance in ODHP, exhibiting an olefin productivity of 4.75 golefin gcat1 h1 under low reaction temperature (445 C) and high weight-hour-space-velocity (WHSV, 37.6 gC3H8 gcat1 h1)."
[3] "A combination of solid-state NMR, dual-beam FTIR, and in-situ DRIFT measurements reveal that the boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in the form of open coordination."
[4] "Meanwhile, the ample SiOH groups on the surface facilitate the formation of hydrogen bonds with the BOH in defective boron species and inhibit the excessive leaching of boron."
[5] "During the ODHP process, the isolated boron species would dynamically transform into aggregated ones, being closely related to the increased catalytic activity."
[6] "In the view of the micro-environment of boron species on the zeolite catalysts, enabling boron species to be uniformly anchored to hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix in oligomeric form may be a feasible way to construct highly active boron centers."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are highlighted by their ability to anchor boron species to the zeolite matrix through open coordination, facilitated by abundant SiOH groups on the surface. This mechanism enhances catalytic performance by inhibiting excessive boron leaching and allowing dynamic transformation of isolated boron species into aggregated forms, which are more efficient in CH bond activation. The incorporation of boron components into these structures is achieved through hydrothermal synthesis conditions that regulate crystallinity, leading to the enrichment of defect boron sites that are essential for catalytic activity. The use of incomplete crystallization enriches the defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, resulting in superior catalytic activity.

B基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔框架中的结构特性通过将硼物种锚定到沸石矩阵中，以开放配合物形式，由表面丰富的SiOH基团促进，增强了催化性能。这一机制通过抑制过度的硼流失和使孤立的硼物种动态转化为聚合物形式，从而提高了CH键活化效率。这些结构中硼成分的整合是通过调节水热合成条件来控制结晶性实现的，这导致缺陷硼位点的富集，这些位点对于催化活性至关重要。不完全结晶化可以富集与相邻硅醇键氢键结合的缺陷硼位点，从而产生优越的催化活性。
