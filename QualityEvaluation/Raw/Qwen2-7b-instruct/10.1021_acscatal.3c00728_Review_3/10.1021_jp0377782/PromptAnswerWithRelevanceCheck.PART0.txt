The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are highlighted by their hollow anatase TiO2 nanospheres. These features are advantageous because they offer a large surface area and facilitate the dispersion of active sites throughout the material. The hollow structure is achieved through the Ostwald ripening process, which creates a porous framework. Boron (B) active components are incorporated into the TiO2 nanospheres using a co-precipitation method. The modified sol-gel process ensures the preparation of these materials, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.

B基材料的结构特征体现在具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架中，它们是通过空心锐钛矿TiO2纳米球实现的。这些特点的优势在于提供了大量的表面积，并使活性位点在整个材料中均匀分布。空心结构通过奥斯瓦尔德成核过程实现，形成多孔框架。硼（B）活性成分通过共沉淀法被引入到TiO2纳米球中。通过修改溶胶-凝胶过程制备了这些材料，这导致了催化性能的增强。
