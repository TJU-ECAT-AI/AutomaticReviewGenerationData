Engineering specific boron species within boron nitride nanotubes boosts olefin yield during propane oxidative dehydrogenation. This catalyst demonstrates superior activity and selectivity for olefin production. The addition of boron active elements to these structures significantly improves catalytic performance. The three-dimensional dispersion of active sites in porous frameworks ensures better interaction between reactants and catalysts. The efficiency of integrating boron active components can differ based on the targeted catalytic process.
