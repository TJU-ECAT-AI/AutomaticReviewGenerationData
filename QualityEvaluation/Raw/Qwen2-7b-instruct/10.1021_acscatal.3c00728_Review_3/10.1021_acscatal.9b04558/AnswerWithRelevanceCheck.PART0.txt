          Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals that these features enhance catalytic performance. The coordination environment of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts plays a significant role in their activity and selectivity in the oxygen reduction reaction. Methods for incorporating B active components into these structures show varying effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application. Techniques such as vapor-phase deposition can effectively integrate B into the framework while maintaining the desired 3-D dispersion. In contrast, chemical vapor infiltration might offer better control over the B distribution but may result in less uniform dispersion.
