Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals that these features enhance catalytic performance. The coordination environment of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts plays a significant role in their activity and selectivity in the oxygen reduction reaction. Methods for incorporating B active components into these structures show varying effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application. Techniques such as vapor-phase deposition can effectively integrate B into the framework while maintaining the desired 3-D dispersion. In contrast, chemical vapor infiltration might offer better control over the B distribution but may result in less uniform dispersion.

分析基于B的材料在多维分散活性位点的孔框架结构的结构特性，显示这些特征可以增强催化性能。原子分散的Pt催化剂的配位环境对它们在氧还原反应中的活性和选择性有显著影响。将B活性成分引入这些结构的方法显示出根据特定催化应用的不同有效性。例如，气相沉积技术可以有效地将B整合到框架中，同时保持所需的三维分散。相比之下，化学蒸汽渗透可能提供更好的B分布控制，但可能会导致更不均匀的分散。
