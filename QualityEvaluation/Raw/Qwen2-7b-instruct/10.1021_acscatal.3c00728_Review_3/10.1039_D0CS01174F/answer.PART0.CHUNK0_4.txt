[1] "The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst49 offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues."
[2] "This h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst was fabricated by chemical vapor deposition using boric acid and urea as precursors, and exhibited 82.1% propylene selectivity with only 3.7% CO and no detected CO2 at 16.8% propane conversion in the ODH of propane with high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV, 576000 mL gBN1 h1) (Fig. 4a)."
[3] "The well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guaranteed the mass transfer process at high GHSV, and achieved a high propylene productivity of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN1 h1, both of which are critical indicators for the potential industrial implementation of ODH."
[4] "In an earlier study,196199 mixed oxides of boron and phosphorus were reported to show activity in the partial oxidation of light alkanes (CH4, C2H6, and C3H8), with high conversion of light alkanes and a wide spectrum of oxygenated products."
[5] "It is known that the preparation of BPO4 crystals often requires high temperature and produces bulk solids with low surface areas. This in general disfavors the exposure of active sites and the maximization of surface area."
[6] "Methods developed to tackle this issue include the creation of ordered microporous morphology in the bulk of BPO4200 or loading it onto a support."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, these materials are engineered to have high surface areas and ordered microporous structures. This allows for better exposure of active sites and enhanced mass transfer, crucial for catalytic performance, especially in reactions involving high exothermicity. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through methods like chemical vapor deposition, which can effectively integrate B into the porous framework while maintaining its functionality. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application, with some materials requiring additional steps like loading onto supports to improve stability and activity. The use of ordered microporous BPO4, for instance, can lead to enhanced activity and selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, showcasing the potential of these materials in industrial-scale applications.
