2.4.1 Nature of the active sites Identification of the active sites of boron-based catalysts is crucial to understand the catalytic origin, and to guide the design and evaluation of new boron-based catalysts.

This suggested that the intact boron nitrides were inert to the reactants under the ODH reaction conditions, and the high catalytic activity of boron nitrides was the consequence of their in situ surface functionalization.

Thus, tailoring functional groups of boron nitride would be beneficial for optimal catalytic performance, and help to understand the nature of the active sites and catalytic origin.

The BNOH catalyst offered a good test bed to verify the active sites by a tidy assembly of oxygenated groups at the edges or the defects mainly in the form of >BOH, BOB, which may be easily accessible for substrates.

In a detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified a large number of accessible edges generated after functionalization at the edges (Fig. 10a).

This result suggested that a gradual substitution of nitrogen by oxygen occurred during the functionalization of pristine boron nitride.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and 2D 11B multiple quantum (MQ) magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectrum identified that there were two types of BO groups on the catalyst surface: the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms and the BOH sites (Fig. 10c and d).

Considering the inert nature of pure h-BN, the nascent functional groups (BOB and BOH groups) formed at the edge of BNOH were considered to be responsible for its catalytic activity in the ODH reaction, which was supported by the FTIR spectra that showed that the OH groups interacted with the reactant and incorporated into the reaction network.

The presence of BOH groups was also reported in the study of ODH of propane on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of the materials in their fresh and spent forms by means of advance experimental techniques, e.g. XPS, ATR-IR, and DRIFTS, and the hypothetical peroxyl-bridged armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) was proposed to serve as an active site in the ODHP reaction.

This was different from the abovementioned hypothesis that the oxygenated boron species at the zig-zag edge were the active sites.

In a later work, Hermans and coworkers characterized the structure of h-BN and BNNTs materials in the ODHP reaction by using 11B solid-state NMR, SEM and soft-XAS, and identified the existence of B(OH)xO3x (where x = 03) phase under reaction conditions (Fig. 11a and b).

This study showed that approximately 30% of h-BN and 80% of BNNTs were converted to B(OH)xO3x phase in the spent materials, and confirmed the crucial role of oxygenated boron species at the edges or at the defects.

Recently, Rossini and co-workers identified the existence of boron hydroxide/oxide termination on h-BN edges by means of combined 11B, 14N and 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy and plane-wave DFT calculations.

In the ODH of light alkanes, the governing role of oxygenated boron species has been extended to explain the activity of other boron-based materials, such as B4C, Ti2B, NiB, elemental boron, and silicon boride.

These results implicated that the boron-based catalysts have similar active phases of oxygenated species (BO or BOH) on the catalyst surfaces.

This was directly demonstrated in a work that used boron oxides supported on silicon oxide as the catalyst that explicitly correlated the catalytic activity to the percentages of oxygenated species.

To better understand the structure of the active sites, Lu and coworkers synthesized mesoporous silica-supported boron oxide catalysts (B2O3/SBA-15) and identified four B species by using the 11B NMR technique, two of which on the upfield side (B(3a) and B(3B) in Fig. 7a) were considered as the responsible species for the activity by analyzing their variations before and after the ODHP test.

With the aid of DFT calculations, these species were characterized as the boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species, respectively.

The activity of tricoordinated boron species and the inertness of tetracoordinated species were confirmed in further studies of the boronsilicate zeolite catalytic system.

In the study using a layered borosilicate zeolite (ERB-1, an MWW borosilicate zeolite) with defective trigonal boron species as the catalyst, abundant presence of defective trigonal boron species (OBOH and B(OSi)xOH3x(x=1,2) species) was reported based on the data of FT-IR and 11B MAS NMR, and proposed to be responsible for the activity of propane ODH.

These types of species (Fig. 7c) were also proposed to present in the amorphous silica supported oxidized boron catalytic system during the ODH of propane captured by IR, Raman, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 11c, d and e).

When boron was incorporated into the zeolite framework as isolated BO3 species (equivalent as B(3c) in ref. 44 or isolated BO3 in ref. 138), its activity to catalyze the ODHP reaction was lost.

Note that these incorporated species were considered inactive in the ODH of propane in an earlier work.

Based on experimental results and DFT calculations, a mechanism involving radical chemistry was proposed with the essence being that the BOH groups of the BNOH catalyst may be dehydrogenated by O2 and generated BNO and HO2 radicals in ODH of propane and ethane, which initialized the gas phase radical chemistry.

The BNO radical tended to react with ethane leading to the production of alkane radicals (C3H7 and C2H5), which were then dehydrogenated by O2 or H2O2, and produced C2H4.

This radical-mediated mechanism was supported by later studies of the ODH of propane on supported boron oxide catalysts and on h-BN.

Further support came from a recent direct detection of the gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3) in the ODH of propane by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUP-MS) in which the C3H6 was revealed to mainly form on the h-BN surface while C2 and C1 products were generated from catalyst surfaces and gas-phase pathways.

In the ODH of propane using supported h-BN catalyst, the inactive diluent (SiC) was found to be able to affect the gas-phase chemistry, and the BOx sites of the h-BN were proposed to act as initiators to generate C3H7 radicals, which can decompose to products in the gas phase and, if reacting with O2, generate HO2 and HO radicals.

This radical-mediated selective oxidation mechanism was previously proposed for the Li/MgO and Li/Dy/MgO catalyst systems, which catalyzed selective oxidative cracking of n-butane under O2-lean conditions.

This pattern of selectivity appeared nearly identical as in the h-BN catalytic system, implicating potential similarities in the mechanisms between these catalytic systems.

Other studies also enriched the understanding of the reaction mechanism.

A combined in situ spectroscopy and kinetic analysis study of the ODH of ethane proposed that the C2H6 underwent a nearly direct dehydrogenation to produce C2H4 and H2 with the aid of O2 adsorption at a low temperature (XC2H6 < 10%), and at high temperature (XC2H6 > 10%), the ethane promoted the activation of adsorbed O2, resulting in the formation of BO(H) sites, and completed the reaction cycle over BO sites.

In the studies of the ODH of propane, the selectivity of C2-products was noticed to be much higher than that of C1-products over an h-BN catalyst in ODH of propane, implicating complicated channels leading to these cracking products.

This puzzle was solved in a later study and the C2-products were reported to be formed via oxidative coupling of methyl radicals in addition to the channels of CC breaking of propane, which explained the higher selectivity of C2-products than the C1-products.

This hypothesis offered further support to the radical-mediated mechanism.

The structural characteristics of boron-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are crucial for enhancing catalytic performance. These features enable the materials to have a large surface area, which facilitates the attachment of boron active components. The dispersion of active sites in the 3-D porous frameworks allows for better access to reactants and products, improving the efficiency of the catalytic reactions. The incorporation of boron active components into these structures can be achieved through various methods, such as impregnation, co-precipitation, or by using boron-containing precursors. Each method has its relative effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application. For instance, impregnation can be used to load boron onto the surface of the porous framework, providing a controlled and uniform distribution of active sites. Co-precipitation involves the simultaneous formation of the boron-containing compound and the framework material, leading to a more integrated structure. Using boron-containing precursors ensures that the boron is incorporated during the synthesis of the framework, resulting in a more stable and homogeneous distribution of active sites throughout the material. The effectiveness of these methods depends on factors such as the type of boron precursor, the porosity of the framework, and the reaction conditions during synthesis.
