[1] "The presence of BOH groups was also reported38 in the study of ODH of propane on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of the materials in their fresh and spent forms by means of advance experimental techniques, e.g. XPS, ATR-IR, and DRIFTS, and the hypothetical peroxyl-bridged armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) was proposed to serve as an active site in the ODHP reaction."
[2] "In a detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst,39 aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified a large number of accessible edges generated after functionalization at the edges (Fig. 10a), and showed that lattice relaxations and distortions occurred exclusively at the edge of the layer."
[3] "This study showed that approximately 30% of h-BN and 80% of BNNTs were converted to B(OH)xO3x (where x = 03) phase in the spent materials, and confirmed the crucial role of oxygenated boron species at the edges or at the defects."
[4] "The authors observed active oxygen exchange in dynamic isotope oxygen tracer experiments when using oCNT, which was significantly suppressed when using boron doped oCNT catalysts (Fig. 15a), and concluded that the incorporation of boron could inhibit the generation of peroxide and superoxide species that were responsible for both higher rate of propane conversion and its over-oxidation in the undoped oCNT catalytic system, by which the selectivity of propylene was improved."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance through the following mechanisms:

1. **Enhanced Reactivity**: Active BOH groups on the edges of materials like boron nitride (BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) serve as sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These groups are formed through in situ surface functionalization and contribute to the catalytic activity by interacting with reactants and incorporating into the reaction network.

2. **Improved Stability**: Incorporating boron into carbon-based materials like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can inhibit the generation of electrophilic oxygen species, such as peroxide and superoxide, which are responsible for over-oxidation and high rates of propane conversion. This leads to improved selectivity towards propylene production.

3. **Surface Modification**: Functionalization at the edges of materials, such as through hydroxylation, increases the presence of active BOH groups, enhancing the catalytic activity. This is particularly effective in materials like boron nitride, where the large number of accessible edges after functionalization at the edges provides numerous sites for reaction.

4. **Selective Oxidation**: The structural characteristics allow for selective oxidation pathways, such as oxidative coupling of methyl radicals, which leads to the formation of C2-products with higher selectivity than C1-products. This is facilitated by the presence of active sites on the surfaces of materials like boron nitride, which can undergo reactions that favor specific pathways over others.

These structural features enable a more efficient and selective catalytic process, making boron-based materials promising candidates for industrial applications in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

分析具有三维分散活性位点的硼基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征，通过以下机制增强催化性能：

1. **增强反应性**：硼氢（BOH）组分位于硼氮化物（BN）和硼氮化碳纳米管（BNNT）的边缘上，作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的活性位点。这些组分通过原位表面功能化形成，与反应物相互作用并融入到反应网络中，从而促进催化活性。

2. **提高稳定性**：将硼引入碳基材料如碳纳米管（CNTs）可以抑制过氧化物和超氧物种的生成，这些物种负责高丙烷转化率及其过度氧化。这导致丙烯选择性提高。

3. **表面修饰**：通过在边缘进行功能化，如羟基化，增加活性BOH组分的存在，从而增强催化活性。对于材料如硼氮化物特别有效，因为其边缘上的大量可访问边缘在经过功能化后提供了众多反应位点。

4. **选择性氧化**：结构特征允许选择性氧化途径，如甲基自由基的氧化耦合，导致C2产物的选择性高于C1产物。这得益于材料如硼氮化物表面存在的活性位点，它们可以促进特定路径而非其他路径的反应。

这些结构特性使催化过程更加高效和选择性，使硼基材料成为轻烃氧化脱氢反应工业应用的有前景候选者。
