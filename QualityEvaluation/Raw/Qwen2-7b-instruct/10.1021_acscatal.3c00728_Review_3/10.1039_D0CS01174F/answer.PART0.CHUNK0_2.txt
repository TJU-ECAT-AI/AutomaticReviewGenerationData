[1] "Boron occurred in nature predominantly as an oxyanion in minerals."
[2] "Due to its moderate electronegativity (2.0 in Pauling scale), boron may form borides with metal or nonmetal elements."
[3] "These, denoted as MmBn, are a family of binary compounds constituted by boron and less electronegative metal or nonmetal elements."
[4] "Borides are diverse in their structural morphologies and stoichiometries."
[5] "Generally, most of the borides are extremely hard, chemically inert and involatile, and are usually used in high-temperature reactor vessels, crucibles, pump impellers and thermocouple sheaths."
[6] "This electron-deficient feature results in the complicated and fascinating properties of the compounds containing boron."
[7] "In these oxygenated compounds, boron may adopt two coordination modes, trigonal BO3 and BO4 tetrahedra (B2O6 units), which are generally neighbored to each other via a common vertex or edge to form BxOy polyanion clusters with various configurations."
[8] "Edge BOH groups were identified unambiguously,39,42 which represented a distinct understanding with that reported."
[9] "The presence of hotspots in the catalyst bed is a typical phenomenon in the ODH of light alkanes owing to its highly exothermic nature, which can significantly accelerate the undesired over-oxidation of olefins, leading to a low selectivity to olefins."
[10] "In an industrially relevant reactor with an inner diameter of 60 mm, the h-BN catalyst bed maintained a uniform temperature profile (a temperature gradient as small as 1.5 C), while the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst bed suffered from a temperature gradient of 47 C."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, these features enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for the reaction, facilitating faster diffusion of reactants and products, and allowing for a more uniform distribution of active sites across the material. This increases the likelihood of successful reactions and improves the efficiency of the catalytic process. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through various methods such as impregnation, co-precipitation, or direct synthesis, which can vary in their effectiveness depending on the specific material and catalytic application. Impregnation, for instance, involves soaking the support material in a solution of the B precursor, which can then be dried and calcined to form the active sites. Co-precipitation combines the precursors of the support and B simultaneously, potentially leading to better dispersion of B species. Direct synthesis integrates the B component during the formation of the porous framework, offering precise control over the distribution and concentration of active sites. Each method has its advantages and limitations, and the choice depends on factors such as the desired level of control over the material properties, the complexity of the synthesis, and the specific requirements of the catalytic reaction.
