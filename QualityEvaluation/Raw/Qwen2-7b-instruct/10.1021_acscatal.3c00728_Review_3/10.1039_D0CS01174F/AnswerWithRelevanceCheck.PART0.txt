          [1] "The presence of BOH groups was also reported38 in the study of ODH of propane on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of the materials in their fresh and spent forms by means of advance experimental techniques, e.g. XPS, ATR-IR, and DRIFTS, and the hypothetical peroxyl-bridged armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) was proposed to serve as an active site in the ODHP reaction."
          [2] "In the survey of h-BN and BNNT catalytic systems, Lu et al. noticed81 a low initial activity (<3%) in ODH of propane prior to reaching their stable performance, which implicated an activation period. This suggested that the intact boron nitrides were inert to the reactants under the ODH reaction conditions, and the high catalytic activity of boron nitrides was the consequence of their in situ surface functionalization."
          [3] "In a detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst,39 aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified a large number of accessible edges generated after functionalization at the edges (Fig. 10a), and showed that lattice relaxations and distortions occurred exclusively at the edge of the layer."
          [4] "This was directly demonstrated in a work that used boron oxides supported on silicon oxide as the catalyst that explicitly correlated the catalytic activity to the percentages of oxygenated species."
          [5] "Based on experimental results and DFT calculations, a mechanism involving radical chemistry was proposed42,54 with the essence being that the BOH groups of the BNOH catalyst may be dehydrogenated by O2 and generated BNO and HO2 radicals in ODH of propane and ethane (Fig. 13a), which initialized the gas phase radical chemistry."
          [6] "The importance of the crystallinity of a carbon-based catalyst in the ODH of light alkanes was further confirmed in the study of Su and co-workers who employed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to convert 1-butylene and obtained a 40% butadiene yield, which was superior to that of activated carbon and iron oxide."

          The presence of BOH groups on h-BN and BNNT surfaces enhances their catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, serving as active sites. The intact boron nitrides exhibit inert behavior under ODH conditions until they undergo in situ surface functionalization, leading to high catalytic activity. Structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst reveals numerous accessible edges and lattice relaxations/distortions at the edges, contributing to enhanced catalytic activity. Incorporating B active components into these structures through various methods, such as boron oxides supported on silicon oxide, correlates with the catalytic activity, particularly through the presence of oxygenated species. A mechanism involving radical chemistry explains the dehydrogenation of BOH groups by O2, generating BNO and HO2 radicals, initiating gas phase radical chemistry in ODH reactions. Carbon-based catalysts like carbon nanotubes demonstrate improved performance in converting light alkanes, achieving higher yields compared to traditional catalysts like activated carbon and iron oxide.

          [1] "Boron occurred in nature predominantly as an oxyanion in minerals."
          [2] "With the development of modern technology, h-BN has been synthesized through many methods, such as mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions."
          [3] "The presence of hotspots in the catalyst bed is a typical phenomenon in the ODH of light alkanes owing to its highly exothermic nature, which can significantly accelerate the undesired over-oxidation of olefins, leading to a low selectivity to olefins."
          [4] "Boron oxide (B2O3) with low melting point (450 C) and low viscosity (436 Poise at 750 C) is mainly found in the vitreous form."
          [5] "In earlier studies, supported boron oxide catalysts on metal oxides (Al2O3, MgO, La2O3, ZnO, etc.) were prepared for the partial oxidation of ethane, where the B2O3(30 wt%)/Al2O3 exhibited the best catalytic performance in the production of acetaldehyde (selectivity: 2.7%, yield: 1.03%) and ethylene (selectivity: 58.0%, yield: 14.6%) with an ethane conversion of 38.0% at 550 C, but at the cost of emission of a large amount of CO (selectivity: 31.0%)."

          Boron is primarily found in nature as an oxyanion in minerals. Modern technology has enabled the synthesis of h-BN through various methods such as mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition, and solid-state reactions. The high exothermic nature of ODH reactions leads to the formation of hotspots in the catalyst bed, which can accelerate the undesired over-oxidation of olefins, resulting in low selectivity to olefins. Boron oxide (B2O3) exhibits a low melting point (450°C) and low viscosity (436 Poise at 750°C), commonly found in a glassy state. Earlier studies have prepared supported boron oxide catalysts on metal oxides (Al2O3, MgO, La2O3, ZnO, etc.), demonstrating the best catalytic performance in the partial oxidation of ethane, producing acetaldehyde and ethylene with high selectivity and yield at 550°C. However, this comes at the cost of emitting a significant amount of CO.

          硼主要存在于矿物质中作为氧酸根。现代技术使得通过机械或化学剥离、化学气相沉积和固态反应等多种方法合成h-BN成为可能。ODH反应的高放热特性导致催化剂床中形成热点，这可以加速不希望的烯烃过氧化，导致烯烃选择性的降低。硼氧化物（B2O3）具有较低的熔点（450°C）和较低的粘度（750°C时为436 Poise），通常以玻璃态存在。早期研究已制备了在金属氧化物（Al2O3、MgO、La2O3、ZnO等）上的支持硼氧化物催化剂，在550°C下显示出乙烷部分氧化的最佳催化性能，产生乙醛和乙烯，选择性和产率很高。然而，这伴随着大量CO的排放。
