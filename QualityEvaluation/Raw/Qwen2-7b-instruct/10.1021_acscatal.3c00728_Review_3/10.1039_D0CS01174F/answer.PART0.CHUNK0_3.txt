[1] "Owing to its moderate electronegativity (2.0 in Pauling scale), boron may form borides with metal or nonmetal elements."
[2] "These, denoted as MmBn, are a family of binary compounds constituted by boron and less electronegative metal or nonmetal elements."
[3] "Boron oxide (B2O3) with low melting point (450 C) and low viscosity (436 Poise at 750 C) is mainly found in the vitreous form featuring a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles with a comparatively high fraction of six-membered rings (boroxol rings) and a portion of non-ring BO3/2 units."
[4] "The morphology of the loaded boron oxide may be manipulated by vapor decomposition of B(OEt)3 onto silica gel to produce more active sites and uniformly distributed acidic sites for improved catalytic performance compared to the ordinary impregnation method using H3BO3."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are characterized by their ability to provide a large surface area and a random three-dimensional network of boron-oxygen units. This structure enhances catalytic performance by exposing more active sites for reactions. To incorporate B active components into these structures, various methods are employed, such as vapor decomposition onto silica gel, which allows for the manipulation of morphology and the creation of more active sites. These methods are effective for different catalytic applications due to their ability to control the distribution and concentration of active sites, improving the overall efficiency and selectivity of the catalysts.
