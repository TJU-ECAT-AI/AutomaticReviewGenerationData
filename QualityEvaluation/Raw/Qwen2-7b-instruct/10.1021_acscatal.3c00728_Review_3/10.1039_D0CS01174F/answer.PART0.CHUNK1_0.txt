[1] "The presence of BOH groups was also reported38 in the study of ODH of propane on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of the materials in their fresh and spent forms by means of advance experimental techniques, e.g. XPS, ATR-IR, and DRIFTS, and the hypothetical peroxyl-bridged armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) was proposed to serve as an active site in the ODHP reaction."
[2] "In the survey of h-BN and BNNT catalytic systems, Lu et al. noticed81 a low initial activity (<3%) in ODH of propane prior to reaching their stable performance, which implicated an activation period. This suggested that the intact boron nitrides were inert to the reactants under the ODH reaction conditions, and the high catalytic activity of boron nitrides was the consequence of their in situ surface functionalization."
[3] "In a detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst,39 aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified a large number of accessible edges generated after functionalization at the edges (Fig. 10a), and showed that lattice relaxations and distortions occurred exclusively at the edge of the layer."
[4] "This was directly demonstrated in a work that used boron oxides supported on silicon oxide as the catalyst that explicitly correlated the catalytic activity to the percentages of oxygenated species."
[5] "Based on experimental results and DFT calculations, a mechanism involving radical chemistry was proposed42,54 with the essence being that the BOH groups of the BNOH catalyst may be dehydrogenated by O2 and generated BNO and HO2 radicals in ODH of propane and ethane (Fig. 13a), which initialized the gas phase radical chemistry."
[6] "The importance of the crystallinity of a carbon-based catalyst in the ODH of light alkanes was further confirmed in the study of Su and co-workers who employed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to convert 1-butylene and obtained a 40% butadiene yield, which was superior to that of activated carbon and iron oxide."

Analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, explaining how these features enhance catalytic performance, and critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, discussing their relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involve the presence of BOH groups, which are proposed to serve as active sites in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction. The intact boron nitrides are inert under ODH reaction conditions, but their high catalytic activity is attributed to in situ surface functionalization. The large number of accessible edges, lattice relaxations, and distortions indicate the formation of oxygenated groups, enhancing the catalytic performance. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through various methods, such as surface functionalization and support on other materials, which correlate with the catalytic activity. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application, with methods like surface functionalization and support on silicon oxide showing direct correlation with catalytic activity.

The structural features of these materials contribute to their enhanced catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for active sites, facilitating easier access to reactants, and allowing for the stabilization of reactive intermediates. The presence of 3-D dispersed active sites within porous frameworks ensures uniform distribution and accessibility, which is crucial for efficient catalysis. The incorporation methods, such as surface functionalization and support, enable the precise placement of B active components, optimizing their reactivity and stability. The effectiveness of these methods depends on factors such as the type of material, the nature of the functionalization, and the compatibility with the support material. For instance, using boron oxides supported on silicon oxide as a catalyst demonstrates a direct correlation between the percentage of oxygenated species and catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of functional groups in enhancing catalytic performance.

Critical evaluation of the methods used to incorporate B active components reveals that surface functionalization and support strategies are particularly effective. Surface functionalization allows for the introduction of specific reactive functionalities, such as BOH groups, which are essential for catalytic activity. Supporting B active components on materials like silicon oxide facilitates the stabilization of these components and improves their reactivity under harsh conditions. These methods are adaptable and can be tailored to different catalytic applications, offering a versatile approach to enhancing the performance of B-based materials. The selection of appropriate materials and functionalization strategies is crucial for achieving optimized catalytic performance, making these methods valuable tools in the development of efficient B-based catalysts for various ODH reactions.
