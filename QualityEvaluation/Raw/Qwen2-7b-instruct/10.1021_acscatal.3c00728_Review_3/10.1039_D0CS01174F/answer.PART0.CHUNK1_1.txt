[1] "The presence of BOH groups was also reported38 in the study of ODH of propane on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of the materials in their fresh and spent forms by means of advance experimental techniques, e.g. XPS, ATR-IR, and DRIFTS, and the hypothetical peroxyl-bridged armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) was proposed to serve as an active site in the ODHP reaction."
[2] "This study showed that approximately 30% of h-BN and 80% of BNNTs were converted to B(OH)xO3x phase in the spent materials, and confirmed the crucial role of oxygenated boron species at the edges or at the defects."
[3] "In the ODH of propane using supported h-BN catalyst,91 the inactive diluent (SiC) was found to be able to affect the gas-phase chemistry (Fig. 13b), and the BOx sites of the h-BN were proposed to act as initiators to generate C3H7 radicals, which can decompose to products in the gas phase and, if reacting with O2, generate HO2 and HO radicals."
[4] "A combined in situ spectroscopy and kinetic analysis study of the ODH of ethane41 proposed that the C2H6 underwent a nearly direct dehydrogenation to produce C2H4 and H2 with the aid of O2 adsorption at a low temperature (XC2H6 < 10%), and at high temperature (XC2H6 > 10%), the ethane promoted the activation of adsorbed O2, resulting in the formation of BO(H) sites, and completed the reaction cycle over BO sites."

1. The BOH groups on h-BN and BNNT were found to be crucial active sites for the ODH of propane. They were characterized using advanced experimental techniques like XPS, ATR-IR, and DRIFTS. The peroxyl-bridged armchair edge of BN was hypothesized to serve as an active site in the ODHP reaction.

2. Approximately 30% of h-BN and 80% of BNNTs were converted to B(OH)xO3x phase in spent materials, highlighting the critical role of oxygenated boron species at the edges or defects in the ODH process.

3. The inactive diluent (SiC) influenced the gas-phase chemistry in the ODH of propane using supported h-BN catalysts. The BOx sites of h-BN acted as initiators to generate C3H7 radicals, which decomposed into products in the gas phase. Reacting with O2, these radicals generated HO2 and HO radicals.

4. A combined in situ spectroscopy and kinetic analysis study proposed that at low temperatures (XC2H6 < 10%), C2H6 underwent a nearly direct dehydrogenation to produce C2H4 and H2 with the aid of O2 adsorption. At high temperatures (XC2H6 > 10%), ethane promoted the activation of adsorbed O2, forming BO(H) sites and completing the reaction cycle over BO sites.

1. 在丙烷的ODH反应中，h-BN和BNNT上的BOH组分被发现是关键的活性位点。它们通过先进的实验技术如XPS、ATR-IR和DRIFTS进行了表征。BN的过氧桥接臂状边缘被假定为ODHP反应中的活性位点。

2. 大约30％的h-BN和80％的BNNT在使用后的材料中转化为B(OH)xO3x相，这强调了边缘或缺陷处氧化的硼物种在ODH过程中的关键作用。

3. 在使用支持的h-BN催化剂的丙烷ODH反应中，无活性的稀释剂（SiC）影响了气相化学反应。h-BN的BOx位点作为引发剂生成C3H7自由基，这些自由基在气相中分解成产物。与O2反应时，这些自由基生成HO2和HO自由基。

4. 结合原位光谱分析和动力学分析的研究提出，当XC2H6 < 10％时，在低温下（XC2H6 < 10％），C2H6经过几乎直接脱氢产生C2H4和H2，借助于吸附的O2。当温度较高时（XC2H6 > 10％），乙烷促进了吸附的O2的活化，形成了BO(H)位点，并在BO位点上完成了反应循环。
