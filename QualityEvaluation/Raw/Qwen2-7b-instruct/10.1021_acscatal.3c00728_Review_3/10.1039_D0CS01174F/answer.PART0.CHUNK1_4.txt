[1] "In the survey of h-BN and BNNT catalytic systems, Lu et al. noticed81 a low initial activity (<3%) in ODH of propane prior to reaching their stable performance, which implicated an activation period."
[2] "This suggested that the intact boron nitrides were inert to the reactants under the ODH reaction conditions, and the high catalytic activity of boron nitrides was the consequence of their in situ surface functionalization."
[3] "Tailoring functional groups of boron nitride would be beneficial for optimal catalytic performance, and help to understand the nature of the active sites and catalytic origin."
[4] "Thus, it was hypothesized that the nascent functional groups (BOB and BOH groups) formed at the edge of BNOH were responsible for its catalytic activity in the ODH reaction."
[5] "In a detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst,39 aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified a large number of accessible edges generated after functionalization at the edges."
[6] "Bor K-edge electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM mode showed that the B/N ratio at the edge (1.28) was higher than that of the in-plane (0.95)."
[7] "This result suggested that a gradual substitution of nitrogen by oxygen occurred during the functionalization of pristine boron nitride."
[8] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and 2D 11B multiple quantum (MQ) magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectrum identified that there were two types of BO groups on the catalyst surface: the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms and the BOH sites."
[9] "Considering the inert nature of pure h-BN, the nascent functional groups (BOB and BOH groups) formed at the edge of BNOH were considered to be responsible for its catalytic activity in the ODH reaction."
[10] "The presence of BOH groups was also reported38 in the study of ODH of propane on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of the materials in their fresh and spent forms."
[11] "In a latter density functional theory (DFT) study202 tried to compromise the two hypotheses of Hermans and Lu groups in the O2 activation in the ODH of propane on h-BN, in which the reactivities of armchair, boron-atom-terminated zigzag (zig-B), and nitride-atom-terminated zigzag (zig-N) edges of h-BN were compared."
[12] "This study stressed the important role of the zig-zag edge of h-BN in the ODH of propane, which was consistent with the opinion in earlier work."
[13] "These results implicated that the boron-based catalysts have similar active phases of oxygenated species (BO or BOH) on the catalyst surfaces."
[14] "To better understand the structure of the active sites, Lu and coworkers synthesized mesoporous silica-supported boron oxide catalysts (B2O3/SBA-15) and identified four B species by using the 11B NMR technique."
[15] "These studies also showed that clustered distribution of tricoordinated boron species is necessary."
[16] "When boron was incorporated into the zeolite framework as isolated BO3 species, its activity to catalyze the ODHP reaction was lost."
[17] "Note that these incorporated species were considered inactive in the ODH of propane in an earlier work."
[18] "Based on experimental results and DFT calculations, a mechanism involving radical chemistry was proposed42,54 with the essence being that the BOH groups of the BNOH catalyst may be dehydrogenated by O2 and generated BNO and HO2 radicals in ODH of propane and ethane (Fig. 13a)."
[19] "In the studies of the ODH of propane, the selectivity of C2-products was noticed to be much higher than that of C1-products over an h-BN catalyst in ODH of propane, implicating complicated channels leading to these cracking products."
[20] "This puzzle was solved in a later study207 and the C2-products were reported to be formed via oxidative coupling of methyl radicals in addition to the channels of CC breaking of propane, which explained the higher selectivity of C2-products than the C1-products."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the unique features of these materials enhance catalytic performance. These features include the presence of active sites dispersed in three dimensions within the porous framework, which increases the surface area available for reaction and potentially improves the diffusion of reactants and products. The porous nature allows for controlled access to the active sites, optimizing the reaction environment.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures are varied and tailored to the specific catalytic application. For instance, hydroxylation of boron nitride edges, synthesis of boron nitride with boric acid and dicyanamide, and assembly of two-dimensional boron nitride nanosheets into three-dimensional ordered architectures are effective ways to enhance catalytic activity. These approaches leverage the inherent properties of B-based materials to create a highly active surface with dispersed active sites.

The relative effectiveness of these incorporation methods varies depending on the desired catalytic application. For example, hydroxylation of boron nitride edges might be particularly advantageous for applications requiring high catalytic activity, as it creates the critical oxygenated boron species necessary for the activation of reactants. Similarly, the synthesis of boron nitride with boric acid or dicyanamide could be beneficial for creating materials with a high density of active sites, enhancing the overall catalytic efficiency.

The evaluation of these methods should consider factors such as the stability of the incorporated B active components under operating conditions, the ease of synthesis, and the compatibility with downstream processing. Advanced characterization techniques, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), are employed to assess the structural and chemical properties of the materials, ensuring the presence of the desired active sites and confirming their dispersion within the porous framework.

Critical evaluation of these methods highlights the importance of balancing the creation of an optimal surface chemistry with the preservation of material stability and mechanical integrity. The selection of appropriate synthesis routes and post-synthesis treatments is crucial for achieving the desired catalytic performance while maintaining the material's functionality and durability.

In conclusion, the incorporation of B active components into 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks represents a promising approach for enhancing catalytic performance. The effectiveness of different methods depends on the specific requirements of the catalytic application, necessitating careful consideration of material properties, synthesis strategies, and post-processing techniques to achieve optimal performance.
