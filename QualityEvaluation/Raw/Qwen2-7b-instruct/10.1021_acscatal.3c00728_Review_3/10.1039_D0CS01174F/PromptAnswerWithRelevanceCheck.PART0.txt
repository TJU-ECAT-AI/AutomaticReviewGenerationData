[1] "The presence of BOH groups was also reported38 in the study of ODH of propane on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of the materials in their fresh and spent forms by means of advance experimental techniques, e.g. XPS, ATR-IR, and DRIFTS, and the hypothetical peroxyl-bridged armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) was proposed to serve as an active site in the ODHP reaction."
[2] "In the survey of h-BN and BNNT catalytic systems, Lu et al. noticed81 a low initial activity (<3%) in ODH of propane prior to reaching their stable performance, which implicated an activation period. This suggested that the intact boron nitrides were inert to the reactants under the ODH reaction conditions, and the high catalytic activity of boron nitrides was the consequence of their in situ surface functionalization."
[3] "In a detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst,39 aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified a large number of accessible edges generated after functionalization at the edges (Fig. 10a), and showed that lattice relaxations and distortions occurred exclusively at the edge of the layer."
[4] "This was directly demonstrated in a work that used boron oxides supported on silicon oxide as the catalyst that explicitly correlated the catalytic activity to the percentages of oxygenated species."
[5] "Based on experimental results and DFT calculations, a mechanism involving radical chemistry was proposed42,54 with the essence being that the BOH groups of the BNOH catalyst may be dehydrogenated by O2 and generated BNO and HO2 radicals in ODH of propane and ethane (Fig. 13a), which initialized the gas phase radical chemistry."
[6] "The importance of the crystallinity of a carbon-based catalyst in the ODH of light alkanes was further confirmed in the study of Su and co-workers who employed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to convert 1-butylene and obtained a 40% butadiene yield, which was superior to that of activated carbon and iron oxide."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involve the presence of BOH groups, which are proposed to serve as active sites in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction. The intact boron nitrides are inert under ODH reaction conditions, but their high catalytic activity is attributed to in situ surface functionalization. The large number of accessible edges, lattice relaxations, and distortions indicate the formation of oxygenated groups, enhancing the catalytic performance. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through various methods, such as surface functionalization and support on other materials, which correlate with the catalytic activity. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application, with methods like surface functionalization and support on silicon oxide showing direct correlation with catalytic activity.

The structural features of these materials contribute to their enhanced catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for active sites, facilitating easier access to reactants, and allowing for the stabilization of reactive intermediates. The presence of 3-D dispersed active sites within porous frameworks ensures uniform distribution and accessibility, which is crucial for efficient catalysis. The incorporation methods, such as surface functionalization and support, enable the precise placement of B active components, optimizing their reactivity and stability. The effectiveness of these methods depends on factors such as the type of material, the nature of the functionalization, and the compatibility with the support material. For instance, using boron oxides supported on silicon oxide as a catalyst demonstrates a direct correlation between the percentage of oxygenated species and catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of functional groups in enhancing catalytic performance.

Critical evaluation of the methods used to incorporate B active components reveals that surface functionalization and support strategies are particularly effective. Surface functionalization allows for the introduction of specific reactive functionalities, such as BOH groups, which are essential for catalytic activity. Supporting B active components on materials like silicon oxide facilitates the stabilization of these components and improves their reactivity under harsh conditions. These methods are adaptable and can be tailored to different catalytic applications, offering a versatile approach to enhancing the performance of B-based materials. The selection of appropriate materials and functionalization strategies is crucial for achieving optimized catalytic performance, making these methods valuable tools in the development of efficient B-based catalysts for various ODH reactions.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding the unique properties of boron that enable its incorporation into these complex structures. The literature highlights several methods for incorporating boron active components into these frameworks, including direct combination at high temperatures, reduction of mixed oxides with active metals or boron carbide, and reduction of metal oxide with boron. The dispersion of active sites within the porous framework enhances catalytic performance by maximizing the contact area between reactants and active sites. This allows for more efficient and faster reactions, improving the overall selectivity and yield of desired products.

For instance, the development of h-BN and other boron-based materials through various synthesis methods has enabled their use in catalytic systems for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The ability to create ordered microporous structures in bulk BPO4 materials further improves catalytic performance by providing a robust framework for the dispersion of active sites, which can significantly affect the selectivity and productivity of olefin products.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For example, the use of supported boron oxide catalysts on metal oxides can offer high selectivity and yield for certain reactions, such as the production of acetaldehyde and ethylene from ethane. However, these catalysts also suffer from the emission of a large amount of CO, indicating a trade-off between selectivity and the potential environmental impact. 

The critical evaluation of these methods reveals the importance of balancing the dispersion of active sites within the porous framework with the stability and reactivity of the boron component. Advanced synthesis techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition and vapor phase reactions, have proven effective in creating materials with optimized properties for specific catalytic tasks. Future research should focus on developing more sustainable and efficient methods for incorporating boron into porous frameworks, while also exploring the synergies between these materials and reactor engineering to achieve optimal performance in industrial-scale applications.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these materials' unique architecture enhances catalytic performance. The literature highlights several aspects that contribute to this enhancement:

1. **Electronegativity and Bond Formation**: Boron, with its moderate electronegativity, forms borides with various elements, creating a versatile platform for material design. These borides can adopt different morphologies and stoichiometries, influencing their electronic properties and functionalities.

2. **Surface Modification**: By incorporating boron into materials like boron nitride, boron carbide, and boron oxide, researchers create surfaces with specific active sites. These sites are crucial for catalytic reactions, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes.

3. **High Exothermic Nature**: The high exothermic nature of ODH reactions can lead to the formation of hotspots, which can cause over-oxidation of olefins. The literature discusses strategies to mitigate this issue, such as using materials with high thermal conductivity, like boron nitride, to manage heat effectively.

4. **Microporous Structures**: The use of microporous structures, as seen in layered borosilicate zeolites, allows for optimized transport of gaseous species and the creation of a specific chemical environment, enhancing the performance of B-based catalysts.

Methods for incorporating B active components into these structures include direct synthesis, impregnation, and embedding into porous matrices. Each method has its relative effectiveness depending on the desired application, such as the type of reaction, required stability, and the need for specific site functionality. For instance, supported boron oxide catalysts might be more effective for reactions requiring high Brnsted acidity, while boron nitride might offer superior selectivity in ODH due to its unique surface chemistry.

The effectiveness of these incorporation methods is evaluated based on factors like catalytic activity, selectivity, stability, and the ability to handle reaction heat. The literature showcases the potential of B-based materials in catalysis, especially in the context of ODH of light alkanes, where their unique structural characteristics play a pivotal role in achieving high efficiency and selectivity.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance through the following mechanisms:

1. **Enhanced Reactivity**: Active BOH groups on the edges of materials like boron nitride (BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) serve as sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These groups are formed through in situ surface functionalization and contribute to the catalytic activity by interacting with reactants and incorporating into the reaction network.

2. **Improved Stability**: Incorporating boron into carbon-based materials like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can inhibit the generation of electrophilic oxygen species, such as peroxide and superoxide, which are responsible for over-oxidation and high rates of propane conversion. This leads to improved selectivity towards propylene production.

3. **Surface Modification**: Functionalization at the edges of materials, such as through hydroxylation, increases the presence of active BOH groups, enhancing the catalytic activity. This is particularly effective in materials like boron nitride, where the large number of accessible edges after functionalization at the edges provides numerous sites for reaction.

4. **Selective Oxidation**: The structural characteristics allow for selective oxidation pathways, such as oxidative coupling of methyl radicals, which leads to the formation of C2-products with higher selectivity than C1-products. This is facilitated by the presence of active sites on the surfaces of materials like boron nitride, which can undergo reactions that favor specific pathways over others.

These structural features enable a more efficient and selective catalytic process, making boron-based materials promising candidates for industrial applications in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, these features enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for the reaction, facilitating faster diffusion of reactants and products, and allowing for a more uniform distribution of active sites across the material. This increases the likelihood of successful reactions and improves the efficiency of the catalytic process. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through various methods such as impregnation, co-precipitation, or direct synthesis, which can vary in their effectiveness depending on the specific material and catalytic application. Impregnation, for instance, involves soaking the support material in a solution of the B precursor, which can then be dried and calcined to form the active sites. Co-precipitation combines the precursors of the support and B simultaneously, potentially leading to better dispersion of B species. Direct synthesis integrates the B component during the formation of the porous framework, offering precise control over the distribution and concentration of active sites. Each method has its advantages and limitations, and the choice depends on factors such as the desired level of control over the material properties, the complexity of the synthesis, and the specific requirements of the catalytic reaction.

2.4.1 Nature of the active sites Identification of the active sites of boron-based catalysts is crucial to understand the catalytic origin, and to guide the design and evaluation of new boron-based catalysts.

This suggested that the intact boron nitrides were inert to the reactants under the ODH reaction conditions, and the high catalytic activity of boron nitrides was the consequence of their in situ surface functionalization.

Thus, tailoring functional groups of boron nitride would be beneficial for optimal catalytic performance, and help to understand the nature of the active sites and catalytic origin.

The BNOH catalyst offered a good test bed to verify the active sites by a tidy assembly of oxygenated groups at the edges or the defects mainly in the form of >BOH, BOB, which may be easily accessible for substrates.

In a detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified a large number of accessible edges generated after functionalization at the edges (Fig. 10a).

This result suggested that a gradual substitution of nitrogen by oxygen occurred during the functionalization of pristine boron nitride.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and 2D 11B multiple quantum (MQ) magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectrum identified that there were two types of BO groups on the catalyst surface: the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms and the BOH sites (Fig. 10c and d).

Considering the inert nature of pure h-BN, the nascent functional groups (BOB and BOH groups) formed at the edge of BNOH were considered to be responsible for its catalytic activity in the ODH reaction, which was supported by the FTIR spectra that showed that the OH groups interacted with the reactant and incorporated into the reaction network.

The presence of BOH groups was also reported in the study of ODH of propane on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of the materials in their fresh and spent forms by means of advance experimental techniques, e.g. XPS, ATR-IR, and DRIFTS, and the hypothetical peroxyl-bridged armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) was proposed to serve as an active site in the ODHP reaction.

This was different from the abovementioned hypothesis that the oxygenated boron species at the zig-zag edge were the active sites.

In a later work, Hermans and coworkers characterized the structure of h-BN and BNNTs materials in the ODHP reaction by using 11B solid-state NMR, SEM and soft-XAS, and identified the existence of B(OH)xO3x (where x = 03) phase under reaction conditions (Fig. 11a and b).

This study showed that approximately 30% of h-BN and 80% of BNNTs were converted to B(OH)xO3x phase in the spent materials, and confirmed the crucial role of oxygenated boron species at the edges or at the defects.

Recently, Rossini and co-workers identified the existence of boron hydroxide/oxide termination on h-BN edges by means of combined 11B, 14N and 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy and plane-wave DFT calculations.

In the ODH of light alkanes, the governing role of oxygenated boron species has been extended to explain the activity of other boron-based materials, such as B4C, Ti2B, NiB, elemental boron, and silicon boride.

These results implicated that the boron-based catalysts have similar active phases of oxygenated species (BO or BOH) on the catalyst surfaces.

This was directly demonstrated in a work that used boron oxides supported on silicon oxide as the catalyst that explicitly correlated the catalytic activity to the percentages of oxygenated species.

To better understand the structure of the active sites, Lu and coworkers synthesized mesoporous silica-supported boron oxide catalysts (B2O3/SBA-15) and identified four B species by using the 11B NMR technique, two of which on the upfield side (B(3a) and B(3B) in Fig. 7a) were considered as the responsible species for the activity by analyzing their variations before and after the ODHP test.

With the aid of DFT calculations, these species were characterized as the boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species, respectively.

The activity of tricoordinated boron species and the inertness of tetracoordinated species were confirmed in further studies of the boronsilicate zeolite catalytic system.

In the study using a layered borosilicate zeolite (ERB-1, an MWW borosilicate zeolite) with defective trigonal boron species as the catalyst, abundant presence of defective trigonal boron species (OBOH and B(OSi)xOH3x(x=1,2) species) was reported based on the data of FT-IR and 11B MAS NMR, and proposed to be responsible for the activity of propane ODH.

These types of species (Fig. 7c) were also proposed to present in the amorphous silica supported oxidized boron catalytic system during the ODH of propane captured by IR, Raman, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 11c, d and e).

When boron was incorporated into the zeolite framework as isolated BO3 species (equivalent as B(3c) in ref. 44 or isolated BO3 in ref. 138), its activity to catalyze the ODHP reaction was lost.

Note that these incorporated species were considered inactive in the ODH of propane in an earlier work.

Based on experimental results and DFT calculations, a mechanism involving radical chemistry was proposed with the essence being that the BOH groups of the BNOH catalyst may be dehydrogenated by O2 and generated BNO and HO2 radicals in ODH of propane and ethane, which initialized the gas phase radical chemistry.

The BNO radical tended to react with ethane leading to the production of alkane radicals (C3H7 and C2H5), which were then dehydrogenated by O2 or H2O2, and produced C2H4.

This radical-mediated mechanism was supported by later studies of the ODH of propane on supported boron oxide catalysts and on h-BN.

Further support came from a recent direct detection of the gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3) in the ODH of propane by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUP-MS) in which the C3H6 was revealed to mainly form on the h-BN surface while C2 and C1 products were generated from catalyst surfaces and gas-phase pathways.

In the ODH of propane using supported h-BN catalyst, the inactive diluent (SiC) was found to be able to affect the gas-phase chemistry, and the BOx sites of the h-BN were proposed to act as initiators to generate C3H7 radicals, which can decompose to products in the gas phase and, if reacting with O2, generate HO2 and HO radicals.

This radical-mediated selective oxidation mechanism was previously proposed for the Li/MgO and Li/Dy/MgO catalyst systems, which catalyzed selective oxidative cracking of n-butane under O2-lean conditions.

This pattern of selectivity appeared nearly identical as in the h-BN catalytic system, implicating potential similarities in the mechanisms between these catalytic systems.

Other studies also enriched the understanding of the reaction mechanism.

A combined in situ spectroscopy and kinetic analysis study of the ODH of ethane proposed that the C2H6 underwent a nearly direct dehydrogenation to produce C2H4 and H2 with the aid of O2 adsorption at a low temperature (XC2H6 < 10%), and at high temperature (XC2H6 > 10%), the ethane promoted the activation of adsorbed O2, resulting in the formation of BO(H) sites, and completed the reaction cycle over BO sites.

In the studies of the ODH of propane, the selectivity of C2-products was noticed to be much higher than that of C1-products over an h-BN catalyst in ODH of propane, implicating complicated channels leading to these cracking products.

This puzzle was solved in a later study and the C2-products were reported to be formed via oxidative coupling of methyl radicals in addition to the channels of CC breaking of propane, which explained the higher selectivity of C2-products than the C1-products.

This hypothesis offered further support to the radical-mediated mechanism.

The structural characteristics of boron-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are crucial for enhancing catalytic performance. These features enable the materials to have a large surface area, which facilitates the attachment of boron active components. The dispersion of active sites in the 3-D porous frameworks allows for better access to reactants and products, improving the efficiency of the catalytic reactions. The incorporation of boron active components into these structures can be achieved through various methods, such as impregnation, co-precipitation, or by using boron-containing precursors. Each method has its relative effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application. For instance, impregnation can be used to load boron onto the surface of the porous framework, providing a controlled and uniform distribution of active sites. Co-precipitation involves the simultaneous formation of the boron-containing compound and the framework material, leading to a more integrated structure. Using boron-containing precursors ensures that the boron is incorporated during the synthesis of the framework, resulting in a more stable and homogeneous distribution of active sites throughout the material. The effectiveness of these methods depends on factors such as the type of boron precursor, the porosity of the framework, and the reaction conditions during synthesis.
