The document discusses the structural characteristics of a specific type of catalyst composed of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. These features enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area and allowing for better diffusion of reactants and products. The active sites are dispersed throughout the 3-D porous structure, which increases the likelihood of interactions between the reactants and the catalyst, thereby boosting the efficiency of the catalytic process. The document also evaluates the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, comparing their effectiveness for different catalytic applications. The effectiveness of these methods is assessed based on factors such as the dispersion of B components, the stability of the catalyst, and the yield of desired products. The document further analyzes the structural properties of the catalysts, including the lattice parameters, surface area, pore volume, and pore size, which influence the catalytic activity and selectivity. The document also investigates the regeneration of active sites using CO2, suggesting that Ni plays a crucial role in this process by promoting the dissociation of CO2 and regenerating the active CrOx phase. The document provides insights into the mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) reaction, highlighting the importance of Ni in maintaining the stability of the catalyst and the regeneration of active sites.
