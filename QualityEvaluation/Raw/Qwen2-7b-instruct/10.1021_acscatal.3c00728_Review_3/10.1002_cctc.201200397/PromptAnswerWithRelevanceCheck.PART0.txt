[1] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[2] "Reduced CrOx was easily regenerated by the addition of Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis."
[3] "Exsitu XPS results revealed that Cr3+ was maintained only in the Ni-promoted catalyst whereas Cr3+ was easily reduced to Cr2+ in the non-promoted catalyst during the reaction."
[4] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads). Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The introduction of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si catalyst significantly improves its stability and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) reactions. This enhancement is attributed to the facile regeneration of reduced CrOx by Ni, which facilitates the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated O (O*ads). The activated O*ads then regenerates the reduced CrOx, maintaining the active phase of the catalyst and improving the stability of propylene production.

The research demonstrates that the introduction of 0.5wt% Ni to a 10wt% Cr/Si catalyst significantly enhances its stability and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. This improvement is attributed to the easy regeneration of reduced CrOx by Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis. When Ni is added, new peaks appear at approximately 200 and 500°C, indicating a transformation of the Cr phase. Notably, the active Cr3+ state remains stable during the reaction on the Ni-promoted catalyst, suggesting that Ni maintains the active sites.

The incorporation of nickel (Ni) into a chromium-based catalyst supported on silica (Cr/Si) improves its performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). Specifically, the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to the catalyst maintains its stability and selectivity, allowing for efficient regeneration of the active sites. This is facilitated by Ni's ability to induce the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which then regenerates the reduced chromium oxide (CrOx) to its active form. Consequently, the Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst ensures a stable yield of propylene in the ODHP reaction.

The document discusses the structural characteristics of a specific type of catalyst composed of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. These features enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area and allowing for better diffusion of reactants and products. The active sites are dispersed throughout the 3-D porous structure, which increases the likelihood of interactions between the reactants and the catalyst, thereby boosting the efficiency of the catalytic process. The document also evaluates the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, comparing their effectiveness for different catalytic applications. The effectiveness of these methods is assessed based on factors such as the dispersion of B components, the stability of the catalyst, and the yield of desired products. The document further analyzes the structural properties of the catalysts, including the lattice parameters, surface area, pore volume, and pore size, which influence the catalytic activity and selectivity. The document also investigates the regeneration of active sites using CO2, suggesting that Ni plays a crucial role in this process by promoting the dissociation of CO2 and regenerating the active CrOx phase. The document provides insights into the mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) reaction, highlighting the importance of Ni in maintaining the stability of the catalyst and the regeneration of active sites.
