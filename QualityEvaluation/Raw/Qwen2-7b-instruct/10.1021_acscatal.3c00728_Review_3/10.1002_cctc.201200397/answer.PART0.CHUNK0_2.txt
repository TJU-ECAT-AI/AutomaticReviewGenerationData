[1] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[2] "Reduced CrOx was easily regenerated by the addition of Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis."
[3] "In addition, exsitu XPS results revealed that Cr3+ was maintained only in the Ni-promoted catalyst whereas Cr3+ was easily reduced to Cr2+ in the non-promoted catalyst during the reaction."
[4] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads). Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."
[5] "The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the ODHP reaction."

The incorporation of nickel (Ni) into a chromium-based catalyst supported on silica (Cr/Si) improves its performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). Specifically, the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to the catalyst maintains its stability and selectivity, allowing for efficient regeneration of the active sites. This is facilitated by Ni's ability to induce the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which then regenerates the reduced chromium oxide (CrOx) to its active form. Consequently, the Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst ensures a stable yield of propylene in the ODHP reaction.

添加0.5wt%镍到基于石墨的催化剂上，提高了其在丙烷与二氧化碳氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能。具体来说，这种添加维持了催化剂的稳定性和选择性，使其能够有效地再生活性位点。这是由镍诱导二氧化碳分解为CO和激活氧（O*ads）实现的，然后再生还原的铬氧化物（CrOx）至其活性形式。因此，Ni增强的Cr/Si催化剂确保了ODHP反应中丙烯稳定的产率。
