[1] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[2] "Reduced CrOx was easily regenerated by the addition of Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis."
[3] "In the case of the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst, the intensity of the first TPR peak decreases and new peaks centered at approximately 200 and 500C appear."
[4] "Interestingly, for the Ni-promoted catalyst, the Cr3+ state is well maintained during the catalytic reaction, which indicates that the active sites are still maintained."

The research demonstrates that the introduction of 0.5wt% Ni to a 10wt% Cr/Si catalyst significantly enhances its stability and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. This improvement is attributed to the easy regeneration of reduced CrOx by Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis. When Ni is added, new peaks appear at approximately 200 and 500°C, indicating a transformation of the Cr phase. Notably, the active Cr3+ state remains stable during the reaction on the Ni-promoted catalyst, suggesting that Ni maintains the active sites.

本研究表明，在10wt% Cr/Si催化剂中添加0.5wt% Ni显著提高了其在丙烷与CO2氧化脱氢反应中的稳定性和选择性。这种改进归因于Ni对还原CrOx的容易再生，这一点通过三步H2-温度程序化还原分析得到证实。当添加Ni时，出现新的峰值，大约位于200°C和500°C，这表明Cr相发生了转变。值得注意的是，Ni促动剂催化剂上的活性Cr3+状态在反应过程中保持稳定，这表明Ni维持了活性位点。
