[1] "To investigate the effect of Ni on activating CO2, TPR typically involved three steps."
[2] "The NiO easily reduced to elemental Ni, which played the role of activating CO2 to enable its dissociation to CO and activated O (O*ads) under the ODHP catalytic reaction conditions."
[3] "For the Ni-promoted catalyst, the Cr3+ state is well maintained during the catalytic reaction, which indicates that the active sites are still maintained."
[4] "This allows one to conclude that Ni has superior ability to dissociate CO2 as well as to regenerate the active site in CrOx for the ODHP reaction, which results in a stable yield of propylene."

1. The study involved a three-step temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) method to investigate the impact of Ni on activating CO2.
2. The added Ni facilitated the dissociation of CO2 to CO and the generation of activated oxygen (O*ads), enhancing the catalytic reaction conditions for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP).
3. The Ni-promoted catalyst maintained the Cr3+ state during the catalytic reaction, suggesting that the active sites remained stable.
4. It can be concluded that Ni possesses superior capabilities to dissociate CO2 and regenerate the active sites in CrOx, leading to a stable production of propylene in the ODHP reaction.

1. 研究涉及三步温度程序化还原（TPR）方法，以探讨Ni激活CO2的影响。
2. 添加的Ni促进了CO2的分解为CO和生成活性氧（O*ads），提高了丙烷与CO2（ODHP）氧化脱氢反应的催化条件。
3. Ni促进催化剂在催化反应过程中维持Cr3+状态，表明活性位点保持稳定。
4. 可以得出结论，Ni具有优越的能力来分解CO2并再生CrOx中的活性位点，在ODHP反应中导致稳定的丙烯产量。
