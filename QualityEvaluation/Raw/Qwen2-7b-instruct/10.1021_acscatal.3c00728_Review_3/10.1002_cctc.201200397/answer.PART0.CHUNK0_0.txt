[1] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[2] "Reduced CrOx was easily regenerated by the addition of Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis."
[3] "Exsitu XPS results revealed that Cr3+ was maintained only in the Ni-promoted catalyst whereas Cr3+ was easily reduced to Cr2+ in the non-promoted catalyst during the reaction."
[4] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads). Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."
[5] "The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the ODHP reaction."

The introduction of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si catalyst significantly improves its stability and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) reactions. This enhancement is attributed to the facile regeneration of reduced CrOx by Ni, which facilitates the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated O (O*ads). The activated O*ads then regenerates the reduced CrOx, maintaining the active phase of the catalyst and improving the stability of propylene production.

向10wt% Cr/Si催化剂中添加0.5wt% Ni显著提高了其在丙烷与CO2氧化脱氢反应中的稳定性和选择性。这种增强归因于Ni促进还原CrOx的容易再生，这有助于CO2的分解为CO和激活的O（O*ads）。生成的O*ads随后再生了还原的CrOx，维持催化剂的活性相并提高了丙烯生产的稳定性。
