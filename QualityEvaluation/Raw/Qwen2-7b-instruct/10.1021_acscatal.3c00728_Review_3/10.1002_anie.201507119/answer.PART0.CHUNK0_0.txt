[1] "The propane dehydrogenation reaction was investigated under atmospheric pressure at 590C."
[2] "As shown in Figure3A, the initial conversion of propane on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was 48.7% at a space velocity (WHSV) of 9.4h−1 near equilibrium (50%) in a feed of 16.2kPa C3H8, 20.3kPa H2, and N2 balance."
[3] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity was as high as 99.1% after a 24h test."
[4] "On the other hand, for the PtSn/Al2O3 reference catalyst, propane conversion dramatically dropped from an initial 43.8% to 28.3% after 24h."
[5] "A first-order deactivation model was used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
[6] "As shown in Figure3B, the best yield at a low kd value clearly demonstrates the superior reactivity and stability of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst in the DHP reaction."
[7] "The 2D sheet structure might promote diffusion and thereby influence the catalytic behavior in the DHP reaction."
[8] "When higher space velocities are used, the effects of mass transfer and diffusion on the reaction rate will be more obvious."
[9] "The increase in the specific activity of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was substantially larger than that of the PtSn/Al2O3ref. catalyst when the WHSV was increased from 1.9h−1 to 56.5h−1."
[10] "STEM analysis (Figure4A,B) showed that the size and morphology of Pt-Sn clusters supported on the Al2O3 sheet had undergone negligible changes even after a 24h dehydrogenation reaction, which demonstrates the excellent sintering resistance of this catalyst."
[11] "The amount (3.7%) of coke deposited on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet was much lower than on the PtSn/Al2O3ref. (7.6%) catalyst."
[12] "This weak interaction minimizes coke formation of the electron-rich C3H6 on the metal sites of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet during reactions, which therefore remain highly stable under the reaction conditions."
[13] "Our work has also demonstrated that the sheet construction of the catalyst facilitates mass-transfer and kinetically controlled diffusion processes during propane dehydrogenation."
