<p>During the DHP process, coke formation generally occurs as a result of side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, and isomerization, that are sensitive to the Pt particle size.</p>
<p>When used in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, this catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity, and superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties.</p>
<p>The catalyst support plays a crucial role in modulating the geometric and electronic structure of active metal phases for optimizing the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability.</p>
<p>The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure3A, the initial conversion of propane on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was 48.7% at a space velocity (WHSV) of 9.4h1 near equilibrium (50%) in a feed of 16.2kPa C3H8, 20.3kPa H2, and N2 balance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity was as high as 99.1% after a 24h test.</p>
<p>The amount (3.7%) of coke deposited on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet was much lower than on the PtSn/Al2O3ref. (7.6%) catalyst.</p>

This research discusses the development of a γ-Al2O3 nanosheet-based catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The key structural characteristic of this material involves the presence of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which significantly improves the dispersion and stabilization of Pt-Sn clusters. This results in an increase in the electron density of the Pt sites, enhancing the catalytic performance for the conversion of propane into propylene with high selectivity and minimal coke formation. The catalyst's sheet-like structure also facilitates mass transfer and diffusion, contributing to its high stability and efficiency at high space velocities. The research provides evidence that the nanosheet structure and the unique Al3+ coordination geometry are critical factors in achieving optimal catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for propane dehydrogenation.
