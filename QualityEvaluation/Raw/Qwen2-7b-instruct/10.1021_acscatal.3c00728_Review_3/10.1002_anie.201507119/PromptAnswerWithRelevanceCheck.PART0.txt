Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these materials can enhance catalytic performance through their unique architectures. The presence of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions in γ-Al2O3 nanosheets contributes significantly to the dispersion and stabilization of Pt-Sn clusters, leading to an increase in the electron density of the Pt sites due to strong interactions between the metal and support. This results in enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity, particularly in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, which is a more environmentally friendly process compared to traditional methods.

The effectiveness of incorporating B active components into these structures is closely tied to the method of integration and the resulting impact on the material's overall properties. The γ-Al2O3 nanosheets, rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, serve as an effective support for dispersing and stabilizing Pt-Sn clusters, thereby enhancing the catalyst's performance. The sheet-like morphology of the catalyst facilitates mass transfer and diffusion, inhibiting the secondary reactions that generate coke, which is a significant cause of catalyst deactivation. The lower amount of coke deposited on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet compared to the PtSn/Al2O3ref. catalyst highlights the superiority of the sheet structure in maintaining high activity and stability under reaction conditions.

The electronic interactions between the Pt and Sn atoms, facilitated by the support, lead to an increase in the electron density of the Pt sites, contributing to the catalyst's enhanced performance. The sheet architecture of the catalyst further promotes diffusion and mass transfer, which is beneficial for the kinetic control of the catalytic process. Overall, the structural characteristics of these B-based materials, specifically the γ-Al2O3 nanosheets with pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, are advantageous for catalytic applications due to their ability to disperse active sites effectively, enhance electronic interactions, and promote efficient mass transfer, thereby reducing coke formation and maintaining high stability.
