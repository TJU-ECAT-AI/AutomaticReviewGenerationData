The structural characteristics of the γ-Al2O3 nanosheets with pentacoordinate Al3+ ions enhance catalytic performance by effectively dispersing and stabilizing raft-like Pt-Sn clusters. This results in increased electronic interactions between Pt and Sn atoms, leading to an increase in the electron density of the Pt sites. The support's role is crucial in optimizing the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. The Al2O3 nanosheets' high percentage of pentacoordinate Al3+ sites facilitate the dispersion and stabilization of Pt-Sn clusters. The electronic interactions between the metals and the increased electron density on the Pt sites contribute to the catalyst's superior reactivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation. The nanosheet structure also accelerates mass transfer and diffusion processes, enhancing the catalytic performance. The coke formation and sintering resistance of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst further account for its stability under reaction conditions.
