[1] "γ-Al2O3 nanosheets rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can nicely disperse and stabilize raft-like Pt-Sn clusters as a result of strong interactions between metal and support."
[2] "Consequently, there are strong electronic interactions between the Pt and Sn atoms, resulting in an increase in the electron density of the Pt sites."
[3] "When used in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, this catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity, and superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties."
[4] "Sheet-like nanoarchitectures are an ideal choice for improving the mass-transfer and diffusion kinetics, which can in principle inhibit the secondary reaction that generates coke."
[5] "The Al2O3 nanosheet synthesized in this work contains a large percentage (27%) of pentacoordinate Al3+ sites."
[6] "These results nicely support the conclusion that the clusters on the Al2O3 nanosheet have a raft-like structure and experience strong metalsupport interactions."
[7] "On the other hand, CO DRIFT spectroscopy of the PtSn/Al2O3ref. catalyst revealed a strong vibration band at 2070cm1 and a small vibration at 2015cm1, suggesting that Pt and Sn only weakly interact in this reference catalyst."
[8] "This unique structure could account for the formation of the highly dispersed and stabilized Pt-Sn clusters on its surface."
[9] "A further H2/O2 titration measurement (Supporting Information, TableS1) showed that the dispersity of Pt is close to 100%, suggesting that almost all of the Pt atoms are exposed on the surface."
[10] "These data clearly demonstrate that the dispersion state and the morphology of the Pt-Sn active phase are strongly affected by the interaction with unsaturated Al(V) sites."
[11] "Overall, these geometric and electronic features are very attractive for a dehydrogenation catalyst with excellent catalytic reactivity and stability."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, the document highlights the role of γ-Al2O3 nanosheets rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ ions. These nanosheets effectively disperse and stabilize Pt-Sn clusters due to strong interactions between the metal and support. The strong electronic interactions between Pt and Sn atoms lead to an increase in electron density on the Pt sites. This catalyst displays excellent catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, with high selectivity for propylene formation and resistance against coke formation and sintering processes. The sheet-like construction of the catalyst facilitates mass-transfer and diffusion processes, enhancing its catalytic efficiency. The incorporation of B active components into these structures through the incipient co-impregnation method is effective for improving catalytic performance, particularly in applications requiring high reactivity and stability.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into the porous frameworks involve the incipient co-impregnation technique. This approach ensures uniform dispersion of B across the material, enhancing its catalytic activity. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application, with the γ-Al2O3 nanosheets showing superior performance in propane dehydrogenation due to their unique structure and electronic interactions.

The document emphasizes the importance of geometric and electronic features in B-based materials for achieving high catalytic reactivity and stability. The presence of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions on the γ-Al2O3 nanosheets contributes significantly to the dispersion and stabilization of Pt-Sn clusters, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. The sheet-like construction of the catalyst promotes mass-transfer and diffusion processes, which are critical for efficient propane dehydrogenation. This structure also helps minimize coke formation and sintering, ensuring long-term stability under reaction conditions.
