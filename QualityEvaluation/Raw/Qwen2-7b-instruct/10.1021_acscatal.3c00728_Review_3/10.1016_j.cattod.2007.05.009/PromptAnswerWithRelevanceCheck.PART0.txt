[1] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times."
[2] "Propane ODH turnover rates increase as the energy of the absorption edge in the UV-visible DR spectrum decreases; the electronic transitions responsible for the absorption edge have been found to be mechanistically related to the redox cycles involving lattice oxygens responsible for ODH turnovers of alkanes."
[3] "In the case of propane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%. Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO) and mixed molybdates (Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O and Mo/V/Te/Nb/O)."

1. During steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), the reduction of vanadium (V) is significantly less than the stoichiometric reduction from V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Only a portion of the reduced centers are actively involved in catalytic cycles, while the rest are re-oxidized on time scales longer than the turnover times.

2. The propane ODH turnover rates increase with the decrease in the energy of the absorption edge in the UV-visible diffuse reflectance (DR) spectrum. These electronic transitions are mechanistically linked to the redox cycles involving lattice oxygens in alkanes' ODH.

3. Most catalysts reported for propane ODH provide ethylene yields under 20%. Notably, catalysts with exceptional performance are based on nickel oxide (NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O, NiO-MgO) and mixed molybdates (Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O, Mo/V/Te/Nb/O).

1. 在稳态氧化脱氢反应（ODH）中，钒（V）的还原程度远低于从V5+到V4+或V3+的等摩尔还原。只有部分还原中心在催化循环中起作用，其余部分在比循环时间更长的时间尺度上被重新氧化。

2. 烯丙基ODH的转化率随着可见紫外吸收边谱能量的降低而增加。这些电子跃迁与烷烃ODH过程中涉及晶格氧的还原循环机制相关联。

3. 大多数文献报道的丙烷ODH催化剂提供的乙炔产率为20%以下。值得注意的是，表现出卓越性能的催化剂基于镍氧化物（NiO-Al2O3、Ni/Nb/O、NiO-MgO）和混合钼酸盐（Mo/V/Sb/O、Mo/V/Nb/O、Mo/V/Te/Nb/O）。

Analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, explaining how these features enhance catalytic performance, and critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, discussing their relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications.

To analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, we refer to the document which discusses various catalysts for ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). The document mentions that catalysts based on NiO oxide and mixed molybdates have shown outstanding performance in ethane ODH, with high ethylene yields. In the case of NiO-based catalysts, the interaction between nickel and the alumina support leads to the formation of surface nickel aluminate-like species, enhancing the catalytic performance. For propane ODH, the best yields reported are still lower than 30%, and the main challenge is the consecutive olefin combustion reaction, which decreases the propylene yield.

The document also highlights the use of combinatorial/parallel systems and genetic algorithms for the discovery of new catalytic systems. These approaches have significantly improved the number of catalysts that can be prepared and studied, contributing to the advancement of catalytic technology.

To evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into porous frameworks, we would need to examine the specific details of how boron is integrated into the structures. The effectiveness of these methods would depend on factors such as the stability of the B component, the dispersion of active sites, and the compatibility with the framework material. The document does not provide detailed information on B-based materials, so a thorough analysis of this topic would require additional research and context-specific details.

In conclusion, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks aim to enhance catalytic performance by promoting efficient access to reactants, facilitating the formation of active sites, and ensuring stable and dispersed catalytic activity. The methods used to incorporate B active components should consider the stability of the B component, dispersion of active sites, and compatibility with the framework material. However, the specific details of these methods and their relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications are not provided in the document.

为了分析硼基材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构的结构特征，我们参考了关于乙烷和丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）催化剂的文档。文档提到基于NiO氧化物和混合钼酸盐的催化剂在乙烷ODH中表现出卓越的性能，具有高乙烯产率。对于丙烷ODH，报道的最佳产率为30%以下，主要挑战是连续烯烃燃烧反应，这会迅速降低丙烯产率。

文档还强调了组合/并行系统和遗传算法在发现新催化剂系统方面的应用。这些方法显著提高了可制备和研究的催化剂数量，对催化技术的发展做出了重要贡献。

为了评估将硼活性成分整合到多孔结构中的方法，我们需要了解硼是如何集成到结构中的具体细节。这些方法的有效性取决于硼组件的稳定性、活性位点的分散程度以及与框架材料的兼容性等因素。文档没有提供关于硼基材料的具体信息，因此对这一主题进行深入分析需要额外的研究和特定上下文细节。

综上所述，硼基材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构旨在通过促进反应物的有效接触、促进活性位点的形成和确保稳定且分散的催化活性来增强催化性能。将硼活性成分整合到结构中的方法应考虑硼组件的稳定性、活性位点的分散程度以及与框架材料的兼容性。然而，这些方法的具体细节及其在不同催化应用中的相对有效性在文档中没有提供。

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the architecture of these materials enhances catalytic performance. Typically, such materials feature interconnected pores and channels that facilitate the transport of reactants and products, as well as the dispersion of active B species throughout the material. The 3-D connectivity ensures a high surface area, which is crucial for increasing the number of active sites available for catalysis. The dispersed nature of the active sites minimizes the possibility of local concentration effects, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the catalytic process. Additionally, the framework's pore structure can be tailored to optimize the reaction pathways, directing reactants towards the active sites and facilitating product release.

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include impregnation, sol-gel synthesis, and covalent attachment to the framework's surface. Impregnation involves soaking the porous material in a solution of B precursor, allowing it to infiltrate the pores and create a B-doped material. Sol-gel synthesis involves a chemical process that converts a liquid precursor into a solid framework, during which B can be introduced as a component. Covalent attachment involves bonding B directly to the framework's structure, often through functional groups present on the framework's surface. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific B-based material and the desired catalytic application. For instance, impregnation might be more suitable for materials requiring high surface areas, while sol-gel synthesis might be better for creating materials with controlled pore sizes and shapes. Covalent attachment can offer the advantage of stable B incorporation, which is beneficial for applications requiring long-term stability.

分析基于B的材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构的结构特征，涉及到理解这些材料如何增强催化性能。通常，这类材料具有相互连接的孔隙和通道，能够促进反应物和产物的运输，以及活性B物种在整个材料中的分散。三维连通性确保了高比表面积，这对于增加可用于催化作用的活性位点数量至关重要。分散的活性位点减少了局部浓度效应的可能性，从而提高了催化过程的效率。此外，框架的孔结构可以被调整以优化反应途径，引导反应物向活性位点移动，并促进产物释放。

用于将B活性成分引入这些结构的方法包括浸渍、溶胶-凝胶合成和表面共价连接。浸渍涉及将多孔材料浸泡在B前体溶液中，让其渗透到孔隙中形成含有B掺杂的材料。溶胶-凝胶合成是一种化学过程，可将液体前体转化为固体框架，在此过程中可将B作为组分引入。共价连接涉及直接将B与框架结构结合，通常是通过框架表面存在的功能团。这些方法的有效性根据特定的B基材料及其所需催化应用而有所不同。例如，浸渍可能更适合需要高比表面积的材料，而溶胶-凝胶合成可能更适合创建具有可控孔径和形状的材料。共价连接可提供稳定B掺杂的优势，这对于要求长期稳定的应用来说是有利的。

An analysis of the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals that these features significantly enhance catalytic performance. The 3-D dispersion of active sites allows for better access to reactants, promotes efficient utilization of the active sites, and facilitates the diffusion of products. The porous framework structure increases the surface area, which is crucial for enhancing the contact between the reactants and the catalyst, thus improving the catalytic efficiency.

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include impregnation, deposition, and covalent attachment. Impregnation involves soaking the porous material in a solution containing the B component, allowing it to adsorb onto the surface. Deposition involves the physical or chemical deposition of B particles onto the surface of the porous material. Covalent attachment involves the formation of chemical bonds between the B component and the porous material, ensuring a stable and durable integration. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For instance, impregnation might be more suitable for applications requiring high surface area, while covalent attachment might be preferred for applications requiring high stability and durability.
