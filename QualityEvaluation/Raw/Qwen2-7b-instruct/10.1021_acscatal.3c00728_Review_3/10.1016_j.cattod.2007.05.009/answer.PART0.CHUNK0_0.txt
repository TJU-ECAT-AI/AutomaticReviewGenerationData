[1] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times."
[2] "Propane ODH turnover rates increase as the energy of the absorption edge in the UV-visible DR spectrum decreases; the electronic transitions responsible for the absorption edge have been found to be mechanistically related to the redox cycles involving lattice oxygens responsible for ODH turnovers of alkanes."
[3] "In the case of propane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%. Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO) and mixed molybdates (Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O and Mo/V/Te/Nb/O)."

1. During steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), the reduction of vanadium (V) is significantly less than the stoichiometric reduction from V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Only a portion of the reduced centers are actively involved in catalytic cycles, while the rest are re-oxidized on time scales longer than the turnover times.

2. The propane ODH turnover rates increase with the decrease in the energy of the absorption edge in the UV-visible diffuse reflectance (DR) spectrum. These electronic transitions are mechanistically linked to the redox cycles involving lattice oxygens in alkanes' ODH.

3. Most catalysts reported for propane ODH provide ethylene yields under 20%. Notably, catalysts with exceptional performance are based on nickel oxide (NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O, NiO-MgO) and mixed molybdates (Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O, Mo/V/Te/Nb/O).

1. 在稳态氧化脱氢反应（ODH）中，钒（V）的还原程度远低于从V5+到V4+或V3+的等摩尔还原。只有部分还原中心在催化循环中起作用，其余部分在比循环时间更长的时间尺度上被重新氧化。

2. 烯丙基ODH的转化率随着可见紫外吸收边谱能量的降低而增加。这些电子跃迁与烷烃ODH过程中涉及晶格氧的还原循环机制相关联。

3. 大多数文献报道的丙烷ODH催化剂提供的乙炔产率为20%以下。值得注意的是，表现出卓越性能的催化剂基于镍氧化物（NiO-Al2O3、Ni/Nb/O、NiO-MgO）和混合钼酸盐（Mo/V/Sb/O、Mo/V/Nb/O、Mo/V/Te/Nb/O）。
