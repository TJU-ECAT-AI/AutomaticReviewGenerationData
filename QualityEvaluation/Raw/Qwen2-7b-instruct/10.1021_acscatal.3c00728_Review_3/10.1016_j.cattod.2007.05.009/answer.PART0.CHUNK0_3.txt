[1] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times."
[2] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V, modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide."
[3] "Modification of these properties affects catalytic performance in ODH; in samples where an increase of the concentration of acid sites is observed (due to the increase in the electronegativity of the additive ions), the total activity increases."
[4] "The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties."
[5] "Propane ODH turnover rates decreases monotonically while increasing both the dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide (Cs > K > Li)."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how the architecture of these materials enhances catalytic performance. Typically, such materials feature interconnected pores and channels that facilitate the transport of reactants and products, as well as the dispersion of active B species throughout the material. The 3-D connectivity ensures a high surface area, which is crucial for increasing the number of active sites available for catalysis. The dispersed nature of the active sites minimizes the possibility of local concentration effects, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the catalytic process. Additionally, the framework's pore structure can be tailored to optimize the reaction pathways, directing reactants towards the active sites and facilitating product release.

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include impregnation, sol-gel synthesis, and covalent attachment to the framework's surface. Impregnation involves soaking the porous material in a solution of B precursor, allowing it to infiltrate the pores and create a B-doped material. Sol-gel synthesis involves a chemical process that converts a liquid precursor into a solid framework, during which B can be introduced as a component. Covalent attachment involves bonding B directly to the framework's structure, often through functional groups present on the framework's surface. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific B-based material and the desired catalytic application. For instance, impregnation might be more suitable for materials requiring high surface areas, while sol-gel synthesis might be better for creating materials with controlled pore sizes and shapes. Covalent attachment can offer the advantage of stable B incorporation, which is beneficial for applications requiring long-term stability.

分析基于B的材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构的结构特征，涉及到理解这些材料如何增强催化性能。通常，这类材料具有相互连接的孔隙和通道，能够促进反应物和产物的运输，以及活性B物种在整个材料中的分散。三维连通性确保了高比表面积，这对于增加可用于催化作用的活性位点数量至关重要。分散的活性位点减少了局部浓度效应的可能性，从而提高了催化过程的效率。此外，框架的孔结构可以被调整以优化反应途径，引导反应物向活性位点移动，并促进产物释放。

用于将B活性成分引入这些结构的方法包括浸渍、溶胶-凝胶合成和表面共价连接。浸渍涉及将多孔材料浸泡在B前体溶液中，让其渗透到孔隙中形成含有B掺杂的材料。溶胶-凝胶合成是一种化学过程，可将液体前体转化为固体框架，在此过程中可将B作为组分引入。共价连接涉及直接将B与框架结构结合，通常是通过框架表面存在的功能团。这些方法的有效性根据特定的B基材料及其所需催化应用而有所不同。例如，浸渍可能更适合需要高比表面积的材料，而溶胶-凝胶合成可能更适合创建具有可控孔径和形状的材料。共价连接可提供稳定B掺杂的优势，这对于要求长期稳定的应用来说是有利的。
