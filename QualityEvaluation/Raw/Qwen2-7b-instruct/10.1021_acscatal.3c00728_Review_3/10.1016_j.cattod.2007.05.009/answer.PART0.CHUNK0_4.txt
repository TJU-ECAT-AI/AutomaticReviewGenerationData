[1] "Several studies have explored approaches that minimize O2 concentrations in contact with the catalyst by separating hydrocarbon and oxygen, either temporally or spatially, using cyclic and membrane reactors, respectively."
[2] "In the case of propane ODH, conversely, the use of CMRs and of oxygen distribution, in general, has not brought remarkable improvements if compared to the conventional reactor configurations."

An analysis of the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals that these features significantly enhance catalytic performance. The 3-D dispersion of active sites allows for better access to reactants, promotes efficient utilization of the active sites, and facilitates the diffusion of products. The porous framework structure increases the surface area, which is crucial for enhancing the contact between the reactants and the catalyst, thus improving the catalytic efficiency.

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include impregnation, deposition, and covalent attachment. Impregnation involves soaking the porous material in a solution containing the B component, allowing it to adsorb onto the surface. Deposition involves the physical or chemical deposition of B particles onto the surface of the porous material. Covalent attachment involves the formation of chemical bonds between the B component and the porous material, ensuring a stable and durable integration. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For instance, impregnation might be more suitable for applications requiring high surface area, while covalent attachment might be preferred for applications requiring high stability and durability.

对基于B的材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构的分析揭示了这些特征显著提高了催化性能。三维分散的活性位点允许更好的反应物访问，促进活性位点的有效利用，并且有利于产品的扩散。多孔框架结构增加了表面积，这对于提高反应物与催化剂之间的接触至关重要，从而提高了催化效率。

用于将B活性成分整合到这些结构中的方法包括浸渍、沉积和共价结合。浸渍涉及将多孔材料浸泡在含有B成分的溶液中，使其吸附到表面。沉积涉及物理或化学地将B颗粒沉积到多孔材料的表面。共价结合涉及形成B成分与多孔材料之间的化学键，确保稳定且持久的集成。这些方法的有效性根据具体催化应用而有所不同。例如，浸渍可能更适合需要高表面积的应用，而共价结合可能更适合需要高稳定性和耐用性的应用。
