Answer: The provided scientific literature does not contain any specific details about B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, their structural characteristics, or the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. It focuses on a generalized treatment for a catalyst pellet consisting of a porous solid within which a homogeneous liquid-phase catalyst is dispersed. The literature discusses the theoretical relations governing diffusion and reaction kinetics in such a catalyst, emphasizing the role of liquid loading within the solid and pore size distribution in determining the rate of reaction. However, it does not provide insights into the specific topic you're asking about.

答案：提供的科学文献中没有关于在多孔框架中具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料的具体细节、其结构特征或如何将B活性成分整合到这些结构中的方法。它关注于一个包含多孔固体的催化剂，其中均匀地分散有液相催化剂。文献讨论了此类催化剂的扩散和反应动力学理论关系，强调了固体内的液体负载量和孔径分布对反应速率的影响。然而，它没有提供您所询问主题的详细信息。
