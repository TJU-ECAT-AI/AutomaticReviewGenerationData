[1] "A generalized treatment is formulated for a catalyst pellet consisting of a porous solid within which a homogeneous liquid-phase catalyst is dispersed."
[2] "The rate of reaction depends not only upon the characteristics of the catalyst solution and reactants, but also upon the liquid loading within the solid and the pore size distribution."
[3] "The derivation is also extended to a broader class of catalysts – multiphase catalysts – in which catalytically active species are also present on the surface of the solid phase."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by providing increased surface area for reactions, facilitating easier access to active sites, and allowing for better diffusion of reactants and products. This feature enables more efficient use of the catalyst, leading to higher conversion rates and yield. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through various methods such as impregnation, co-precipitation, and ion exchange. These methods vary in their effectiveness depending on factors such as the specific properties of the B component, the nature of the porous framework, and the desired catalytic application. For instance, impregnation might be more suitable for applications requiring high loading of B active sites, while co-precipitation could be preferred for maintaining the stability of both the B component and the porous framework during synthesis.

B基材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构的结构特征通过提供更大的反应表面、方便活性位点的访问以及促进反应物和产物的扩散，提高了催化性能。这一特性使得催化剂的使用更加高效，从而导致更高的转化率和产率。将B活性成分引入这些结构通常通过多种方法实现，如浸渍、共沉淀和离子交换。这些方法在不同应用中的有效性取决于B成分的具体性质、多孔框架的性质以及所需催化应用等因素。例如，浸渍可能更适合需要高B活性位点负载的应用，而共沉淀则可能更适用于在合成过程中保持B成分和多孔框架稳定性的需求。
