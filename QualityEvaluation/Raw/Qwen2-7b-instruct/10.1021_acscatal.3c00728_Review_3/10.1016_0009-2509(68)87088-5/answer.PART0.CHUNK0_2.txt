[1] "A generalized treatment is formulated for a catalyst pellet consisting of a porous solid within which a homogeneous liquid-phase catalyst is dispersed."
[2] "The rate of reaction depends not only upon the characteristics of the catalyst solution and reactants, but also upon the liquid loading within the solid and the pore size distribution."
[3] "The derivation is also extended to a broader class of catalysts - multiphase catalysts - in which catalytically active species are also present on the surface of the solid phase."

The literature discusses the formulation of a generalized treatment for a catalyst pellet that includes a porous solid with a dispersed homogeneous liquid-phase catalyst. The rate of reaction is influenced by the catalyst solution and reactants' characteristics, as well as the liquid loading within the solid and the pore size distribution. This theory is further extended to multiphase catalysts where catalytically active species are present on the solid phase surface.

文献讨论了一种针对包含多孔固体和分散均匀液相催化剂的催化剂颗粒的通用处理方法。反应速率不仅取决于催化剂溶液和反应物的特性，还取决于固体内部的液体装载量和孔径分布。该理论还扩展到一类更广泛的催化剂——多相催化剂，在这些催化剂中，催化活性物种也存在于固体表面。
