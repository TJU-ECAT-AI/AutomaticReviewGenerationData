Since the provided XML tags seem to indicate an attempt to link to external scientific literature, which did not load correctly, I am unable to extract specific quotes or answer questions based on the content of the document. However, I can still provide guidance on how to structure your response if you were able to provide the content.

For instance, if you had provided a section of scientific literature discussing B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, here’s how you could structure your response:

<quotes>
[1] "B-based materials exhibit unique structural characteristics due to their three-dimensional dispersed active sites within porous frameworks."
[2] "These features enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for reactions, increasing the probability of effective collisions between reactants and catalysts."
[3] "The incorporation of B active components into these structures typically involves chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or impregnation methods, depending on the desired level of dispersion and uniformity."
[4] "For different catalytic applications, the effectiveness of these methods varies; CVD might offer better control over the distribution but requires higher temperatures, while impregnation is simpler but may lead to less uniform coverage."

1. B-based materials feature distinctive structural properties thanks to their three-dimensional dispersed active sites embedded in porous frameworks. These characteristics boost catalytic efficiency by maximizing the surface area available for reactions, thereby enhancing the likelihood of successful molecular interactions.
2. Incorporating B active components into these materials usually entails utilizing chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or impregnation techniques. The choice between these methods depends on the desired level of dispersion and uniformity across the material.
3. The suitability of these methods for different catalytic tasks varies. While CVD provides superior control over distribution but necessitates higher temperatures, impregnation offers a simpler process albeit potentially leading to less consistent coverage.

1.B基材料因其在多孔结构中分散的三维活性位点而展现出独特的结构特性。这些特征通过增加反应表面的面积来增强催化性能，从而提高反应物与催化剂之间有效碰撞的概率。
2.将B活性成分引入这些材料通常涉及采用化学气相沉积（CVD）或浸渍方法。选择这些方法取决于所需的分散性和均匀性水平。
3.这些方法在不同催化任务中的适用性各不相同。虽然CVD提供了更高级的分布控制但需要更高的温度，而浸渍过程更为简单，但可能导致覆盖不均。
