Kinetic investigations of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on boron oxide in confined spaces Highlights • Propane conversion rate is suppressed in confined space, due to quenching of radicals responsible for propane activation. • Apparent propane reaction order varies from 1 to 3, impacted by supports, B2O3 loading, and partial pressure of propane. • Positive correlation between apparent propane reaction order and apparent activation energy is observed. • The observed kinetic behaviors can be rationalized by the rate expression derived based on the radical chain mechanism.
Abstract Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising process for on-purpose propylene production with favorable thermodynamics. Boron-based catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity in ODHP, but the understanding of catalytic mechanism remains incomplete, especially regarding the observed supra-linear reaction order of alkanes. In this work, we studied the impact of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures. The formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support. Intriguingly, the apparent activation energy increases with the ODHP activity, and exhibits a positive correlation with the apparent propane reaction order. The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. The trend in propane reaction order and apparent activation energy on B2O3 can be rationalized by the rate expression derived based on the proposed radical chain mechanism with three distinct pathways of propane activation.

1. Introduction
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been widely commercialized to meet the increasing demand of propylene (C3H6) [1] . However, the unfavorable thermodynamics and rapid catalyst deactivation caused by carbon deposition limit the propane (C3H8) conversion in PDH. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which is free of thermodynamic limitations and carbon deposition, has been regarded as a promising technology for next-generation on-purpose C3H6 production process [2] . The main bottleneck in the development of commercial ODHP technology is the poor C3H6 selectivity of the ODHP catalysts. On conventional ODHP catalysts, such as vanadium- and chromium-based materials, the C3H6 selectivity is typically less than 70 % at C3H8 conversion higher than 10 % [2] .
In 2016, Hermans and co-workers reported high alkene selectivity and mass activity of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotube in ODHP [3] , though the ability of boron-based catalysts to active alkane was reported decades ago [4] ,[5] . A boron oxyhydroxide (B(OH)xO3x) layer was identified on the surface of h-BN after the induction period, indicating that the active sites on h-BN and B2O3 are likely similar in nature [6] . Rather than CO or CO2, ethylene (C2H4) is the main by-product on h-BN, which is distinct from non-boron-based ODHP catalysts [3] . Aside from h-BN and boron oxide, other boron-containing materials, including borosilicate zeolites, metal borides and boron carbide, have also been reported for high alkene selectivity in ODHP [7] ,[8] ,[9] . Another interesting property of most boron-based catalysts is that the ODHP rate is approximately second-order dependence with respect to the partial pressure of C3H8 [3] ,[10] . The supra-linear reaction order of C3H8 is inconsistent with the conventional understanding of alkane activation based on the classic models in heterogeneous catalysis, e.g., Langmuir-Hinshelwood, Eley-Rideal and Mars-van Krevelen mechanisms, implying that surface-mediated mechanisms are unlikely to account for the ODHP activity on boron-based catalysts. Considering the high reaction temperature and the propensity of boron oxide species to form radical species [11] , gas-phase radical reaction could be a key, if not dominant, component in the reaction network on the boron-mediated alkane conversion. Recent experimental and computational results lend support to the importance of gas-phase reactions in the oxidative dehydrogenation catalyzed by boron-based catalysts [10] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] . Venegas et al. found that C3H8 conversion was proportional to the volume of catalyst bed, rather than the mass of h-BN, in the h-BN catalyzed ODHP [12] . Kraus et al. showed that the high alkene selectivity of h-BN was consistent with the gas-phase radical reaction network via microkinetic modeling of gas-phase C3H8-O2 reaction [13] . Our recent kinetic studies on oxidative co-dehydrogenation of ethane and propane on h-BN deconvoluted two roles of alkanes in oxidative dehydrogenation catalyzed by h-BN, i.e., radical generator and substrate [14] . These studies indicate the important contribution of gas-phase radical reactions in ODHP catalyzed by boron-based catalysts.
A key aspect in the gas phase radical mechanism is the termination of radicals, which typically involve the collision or radicals with a quenching agent such as a solid surface. Wall effect refers to the influence of solids on homogeneous radical reactions by enhancing quenching of gas phase radicals via collisions with the solid wall [15] , which has been widely studied in the combustion literature [16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] . Under the reaction conditions of ODHP, the mean free path of gaseous molecules is estimated to be 150 nm (See
