The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are designed to enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for reactions and facilitating the diffusion of reactants and products. These materials typically feature interconnected pores and channels that allow for efficient mass transport, while the dispersed active sites enable localized catalysis. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through various methods such as impregnation, co-precipitation, and sol-gel processes. Each method has its relative effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application, such as the type of reaction, desired product, and operational conditions.

For instance, the BNOH catalyst, which is a metal-free catalyst, efficiently catalyzes the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It demonstrates high selectivity toward propylene (80.2%) at a given propane conversion of 20.6%, with only negligible CO2 formation (0.5%). This performance is attributed to the dynamically generated active BNO. site, which triggers propane dehydrogenation by selectively breaking the CH bond while simultaneously shutting off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2. The stability of the BNOH catalyst is evidenced by its ability to maintain steady conversion and product selectivity over a 300-hour test at 530°C.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures involve treating pristine boron nitride with sodium nitrite solution, followed by steam activation at high temperatures. This process generates BOH groups at the edges of the material, which act as active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The FTIR analysis identifies the roles of BOB and BOH groups under reaction conditions, confirming their involvement in the catalytic process. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES) measurements determine the residual content of sodium in the hydroxylation process, ensuring the purity of the catalyst.

In summary, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are optimized to enhance catalytic performance through enhanced surface area, efficient mass transport, and localized catalysis. The incorporation of B active components is achieved through specific treatment processes that generate active sites capable of selectively catalyzing desired reactions while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

这些B基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔框架结构中具有结构特征，旨在通过提供更大的反应表面并促进反应物和产物的扩散来增强催化性能。这些材料通常具备相互连接的孔隙和通道，这有利于高效的物质传输，而分散的活性位点则允许局部催化作用。将B活性成分整合到这些结构中的方法包括浸渍、共沉淀和溶胶-凝胶过程等。每种方法在特定的催化应用（如反应类型、预期产品和操作条件）中各有其相对有效性。

例如，BNOH催化剂是一种无金属催化剂，高效催化丙烷的氧化脱氢生成丙烯。它在530°C下表现出高达80.2%的丙烯选择性，同时仅产生微量的二氧化碳（0.5%），对应于给定的丙烷转化率20.6%。这种表现归因于动态生成的活性BNO.位点，该位点通过选择性地断裂CH键同时关闭丙烯过氧化生成二氧化碳的途径来触发丙烷脱氢作用。BNOH催化剂的稳定性通过在530°C下进行长达300小时的测试得到证明，在此期间，转化率和产物选择性保持稳定。

用于整合B活性成分的方法包括将纯硼氮化物与硝酸钠溶液处理，随后在高温下进行蒸汽活化。这一过程在材料边缘生成BOH组分，作为氧化脱氢反应的活性位点。FTIR分析确定了反应条件下BOB和BOH组分的作用，证实了它们在催化过程中的参与。电感耦合等离子体光谱分析（ICPOES）测量确定了水解过程中的钠残留量，确保了催化剂的纯度。

总之，B基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔框架结构中的结构特征优化了催化性能，通过增加表面积、促进物质传输和局部催化作用来实现。将B活性成分整合到这些结构中的方法通过特定的处理过程生成活性位点，这些位点能够选择性地催化所需反应，同时最小化不希望的副反应。
