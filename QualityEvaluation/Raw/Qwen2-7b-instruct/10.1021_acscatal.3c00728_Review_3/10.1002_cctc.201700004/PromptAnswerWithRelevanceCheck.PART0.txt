[1] "Recently, Hermans's group reported that boron nitride exhibits a high selectivity to propylene (79%) and ethylene (12%) at 14% conversion in the ODH reaction of propane."
[2] "Nevertheless, in view of activity, selectivity, and stability, there is still room for improvements, and a detailed structural characterization of this novel catalytic system and a better understanding of the structureactivity correlation in the ODH reaction of propane are still needed."
[3] "The BNOH catalyst provided surprisingly high selectivity toward propylene during ODH of propane at 530C. The conversion of propane approached 20.6%, which is equivalent to a reaction rate of 7.74g gcat1h1; the product slate consisted of propylene, ethylene, methane, CO, and CO2."
[4] "Taking the equally important product ethylene into account, the selectivity for light olefins (ethylene+propylene, C23=) was up to 90.9%, which was much higher than the selectivities obtained over the well-developed metal or metal oxide catalysts at a comparable propane conversion level, as well as over carbon and carbonaceous materials."
[5] "Moreover, the selectivity toward propylene can be further promoted by mediating the reaction conditions. For example, propylene selectivity of 97.4% (C23=: 99.1%) was obtained at 510C at a propane conversion level of 6.5%; whereas it approached 59.8% (C23=: 76.3%) at 540C with a propane conversion level of 38.2%."
[6] "The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst in the ODH of propane was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test at 530C, in which no significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity occurred (Figure1b), demonstrating the potential for industrial application."
[7] "The BNOH catalyst inherited a hexagonal layered structure of boron nitride (FigureS3)."
[8] "Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation (Figure2a, FiguresS4 and S5)."
[9] "Boron K-edge electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM mode (Figure2b and FigureS8) showed that the edge possesses a higher π* to σ* ratio (1.27, point2) than that (0.52, point4) of the in-plane, primarily because of the local warp or wrinkle at the edge,9 and the B/N ratio (1.28, point2) at the edge was higher than that (0.95, point4) of the in-plane (Figure2b)."
[10] "There were two types of boron species (Figure2c); one was coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface whereas the other was bonded to oxygen at the edge.10 The chemical environment for the coordination between boron and oxygen was further verified by the 2D 11B multiple quantum (MQ) magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectrum of the BNOH catalyst (Figure2d)."
[11] "During subsequent pulses, the amount of H218O continuously increased while the amount of H216O decreased, further verifying the isotopic exchange between 16O sites at the BNOH edge and gaseous 18O2."
[12] "Initially, the apparent activation energies (Ea) of two reactants, propane and oxygen, were obtained by evaluating the dependence of their converting rates on the reaction temperature."
[13] "This deduction was further verified by measuring the kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) of CH cleavage."
[14] "A Langmuir-type dependence on oxygen concentration corresponds with a reaction mechanism that is controlled by adsorption or activation of molecular oxygen on the catalyst surface."
[15] "Prior to testing, the catalyst was heated to 560C at a rate of 10Cmin1 in 20vol.% O2/N2 and maintained at this temperature for 1h."
[16] "The reaction mixture was C3H8/O2/He with a molar ratio of 1/1.5/3.5 at atmospheric pressure."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves examining the unique properties that enable enhanced catalytic performance. In the context of the literature, boron nitride (BN) exhibits high selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene. The BNOH catalyst, after steam activation, shows remarkable stability and high selectivity, with a conversion of propane approaching 20.6% and a selectivity for propylene reaching 80.2%. The presence of edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BOH) at the edges of the BN structure is crucial for the selective activation of the CH bond in propane, thereby avoiding overoxidation to CO2.

The structural enhancements in the BNOH catalyst include the creation of numerous edges during steam activation, which leads to a higher π* to σ* ratio compared to the in-plane structure, indicating localized distortions or wrinkles. These edges are enriched with boron-nitrogen (B/N) ratios that are higher than those in the plane, and they contain both boron species coordinated with nitrogen and bonded to oxygen. The presence of BOH groups at the edges plays a key role in the selective activation of the CH bond in propane, facilitating the formation of propylene without overoxidation.

To incorporate B active components into these structures effectively, the literature suggests several methods, including hydroxylation, which creates BOH groups that are crucial for the catalytic activity. These methods allow for the enhancement of catalytic performance by providing a 3-D dispersion of active sites within the porous framework of the material. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application, with the BNOH catalyst demonstrating improved selectivity and stability in the ODH of propane.

The literature further discusses the kinetic behavior of the ODH reaction, showing that the cleavage of CH bonds readily occurs after the activation of oxygen on the BNOH catalyst. This supports the conclusion that the BOH groups dynamically generate active sites, triggering the propane dehydrogenation process. The kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) of CH cleavage indicate that the cleavage of CH bonds is facilitated in the BNOH catalytic system, further supporting the enhanced selectivity towards propylene.

The structural characterization of the BNOH catalyst provides insights into the active sites and their interactions with reactants. The use of advanced techniques like electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) reveals the chemical environment around the boron atoms, highlighting the importance of the BOH groups in the reaction network. The ability of these groups to interact with molecular oxygen and undergo dynamic exchange with isotopic oxygen molecules demonstrates their role in the catalytic cycle.

In summary, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as the BNOH catalyst, contribute to enhanced catalytic performance through selective activation of the CH bond in propane, avoidance of overoxidation, and dynamic generation of active sites. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through methods like hydroxylation, which facilitates the creation of edge-hydroxylated boron nitride groups. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated through improved selectivity, stability, and kinetic behavior in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

分析硼基材料中三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特性，涉及到对能够增强催化性能的独特性质的考察。文献中提到，硼氮化物（BN）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）到丙烯中表现出高选择性。在蒸汽激活后，BNOH催化剂显示出出色的稳定性和高选择性，丙烷转化接近20.6%，丙烯选择性达到80.2%。边缘羟基化的硼氮化物（BOH）在BN结构边缘的存在对于选择性活化丙烷中的CH键至关重要，从而避免了向二氧化碳的过氧化。

BNOH催化剂的结构改进包括在蒸汽激活过程中创建大量边缘，导致边缘与平面相比具有更高的π*到σ*比，这表明局部扭曲或皱纹的存在。这些边缘的硼氮（B/N）比率高于平面，且包含与氮协同的硼原子和与边缘氧键合的两种硼物种。边缘BOH组分在选择性活化丙烷中的CH键中起关键作用，通过这种方式促进丙烯的形成，同时避免过氧化为二氧化碳。

为了有效地将B活性成分整合到这些结构中，文献提出了一些方法，包括羟基化，这种方法创造了BOH组分，对催化活性至关重要。这些方法允许在材料的多孔框架中增强催化性能，提供三维分散的活性位点。这些方法的有效性因具体催化应用而异，BNOH催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中显示出改进的选择性和稳定性。

文献进一步讨论了ODH反应的动力学行为，表明在BNOH催化剂上激活氧气后，CH键的断裂可以轻易发生。这支持结论，即BOH组分动态生成活性位点，触发丙烷脱氢过程。同位素效应（KIEs）表明CH键的断裂在BNOH催化系统中得到促进，进一步支持了对丙烯的增强选择性。

BNOH催化剂的结构表征提供了有关活性位点及其与反应物相互作用的见解。使用高级技术如电子能量损失谱（EELS）和核磁共振（NMR）揭示了硼原子周围的化学环境，突出了BOH组分在反应网络中的作用。这些组分能够与分子氧相互作用并进行动态交换与同位素氧分子之间的同位素交换，证明了它们在催化循环中的作用。

综上所述，硼基材料中三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特性，如BNOH催化剂，通过选择性活化丙烷中的CH键、避免过氧化以及动态生成活性位点，贡献了增强的催化性能。通过羟基化等方法整合B活性成分到这些结构中，实现了边缘羟基化的硼氮化物组分的创造。这些方法的有效性通过丙烷氧化脱氢到丙烯过程中的改进选择性、稳定性和动力学行为得到了证明。

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves examining the unique properties that enable enhanced catalytic performance. These materials often feature interconnected pores and channels that facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products, optimizing the surface-to-volume ratio for efficient catalysis. The presence of 3-D dispersed active sites ensures a more uniform distribution of activity throughout the material, which can lead to improved selectivity and activity compared to traditional catalysts with more localized active centers. The use of boron (B) as the active component allows for the creation of stable, high-performance catalysts that can withstand harsh conditions and maintain their activity over extended periods.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures typically involve chemical treatments, such as hydrothermal activation or impregnation, which enable the formation of functional groups (like hydroxyl groups) on the surface or edges of the B-based materials. These functional groups act as catalyst promoters, enhancing the reactivity of the B sites towards specific reactions. For instance, the edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) catalyst reported in the literature demonstrates high selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This is achieved through the dynamic generation of active BNO. sites that selectively cleave the CH bond in propane while suppressing overoxidation to CO2, thus achieving superior selectivity and stability.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For reactions requiring high selectivity, materials with precisely controlled surface chemistry and pore structures are essential. For reactions with more tolerant conditions, simpler methods like impregnation might suffice. The critical evaluation of these methods includes assessing factors such as catalyst stability, activity, and cost-effectiveness, as well as the ease of scale-up for industrial applications.

To critically evaluate the methods used, one must consider the synthesis conditions, the type of B-based material, the nature of the functional groups introduced, and the impact of these modifications on the overall catalytic performance. For example, in the case of BNOH, the steam activation process creates a high density of hydroxyl groups on the edges of the boron nitride framework, which dynamically interact with molecular oxygen to generate active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This approach not only enhances the selectivity towards propylene but also minimizes the formation of undesired byproducts like CO2, showcasing the potential for industrial-scale applications.

分析基于B材料的三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特征，涉及研究这些特性如何增强催化性能。这些材料通常具有相互连接的孔隙和通道，可以优化表面积与体积比，从而提高反应物和产物的扩散效率。三维分散的活性位点确保了活性中心在整个材料中更均匀的分布，这可能导致与传统催化剂相比更高的选择性和活性。将硼（B）作为活性成分允许创建稳定且高性能的催化剂，它们能够承受苛刻条件，并维持其活性长达数小时。

用于将B活性成分整合到这些结构中的方法通常包括化学处理，如水热激活或浸渍，这些处理允许在材料表面或边缘形成功能性基团（如羟基）。这些功能性基团作为催化剂促进剂，增强了B位点对特定反应的活性。例如，报告的边氢化硼氮化物（BNOH）催化剂通过动态生成活性BNO.位点实现了高丙烷氧化脱氢选择性至丙烯，这些位点选择性地断裂丙烷中的CH键，同时抑制丙烯过氧化为CO2，从而实现优越的选择性和稳定性。

根据具体应用的不同，这些方法的有效性也有所不同。对于需要高选择性的反应，必须有精确控制的表面化学和孔结构。对于条件更为宽容的反应，可能仅需简单的浸渍方法就足够了。对这些方法的批判性评价应考虑合成条件、B基材料的类型、引入的功能基团的性质以及这些修改对整体催化性能的影响。例如，在BNOH的情况下，蒸汽活化过程在硼氮化物骨架的边缘上产生了高密度的羟基基团，这些基团动态与分子氧相互作用以生成活性位点进行丙烷氧化脱氢。这种方法不仅提高了向丙烯的选择性，而且最大程度地减少了不希望产生的副产品如CO2的形成，展示了工业规模应用的潜力。

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, the literature highlights several key features that enhance catalytic performance. The edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) catalyst, for instance, exhibits high selectivity for propylene production in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This selectivity is attributed to the dynamic generation of active BNO. sites through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen.

Moreover, the stability of the BNOH catalyst is remarkable, as evidenced by its ability to maintain steady conversion and product selectivity over a 300-hour test at 530°C. The selectivity for propylene increases to 97.4% at a 6.5% conversion level of propane, demonstrating the potential for efficient and selective catalysis.

The incorporation of boron active components into porous frameworks is achieved through various methods, including hydroxylation and activation processes. These methods effectively introduce 3-D dispersed active sites that contribute to enhanced catalytic performance. For different catalytic applications, the effectiveness of these incorporation methods varies based on factors such as the desired selectivity, stability, and reaction conditions. The literature provides insights into the structural analysis of these materials, including the presence of zigzag edges and the chemical environment around boron and oxygen atoms, which are crucial for understanding the catalytic mechanisms and optimizing their performance.

In summary, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as the edge-hydroxylated boron nitride catalyst, enable high selectivity and stability in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The methods used to incorporate boron active components into these structures are effective for achieving desired catalytic properties, although the choice of method depends on the specific application and desired outcomes.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are designed to enhance catalytic performance by providing a larger surface area for reactions and facilitating the diffusion of reactants and products. These materials typically feature interconnected pores and channels that allow for efficient mass transport, while the dispersed active sites enable localized catalysis. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through various methods such as impregnation, co-precipitation, and sol-gel processes. Each method has its relative effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application, such as the type of reaction, desired product, and operational conditions.

For instance, the BNOH catalyst, which is a metal-free catalyst, efficiently catalyzes the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It demonstrates high selectivity toward propylene (80.2%) at a given propane conversion of 20.6%, with only negligible CO2 formation (0.5%). This performance is attributed to the dynamically generated active BNO. site, which triggers propane dehydrogenation by selectively breaking the CH bond while simultaneously shutting off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2. The stability of the BNOH catalyst is evidenced by its ability to maintain steady conversion and product selectivity over a 300-hour test at 530°C.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures involve treating pristine boron nitride with sodium nitrite solution, followed by steam activation at high temperatures. This process generates BOH groups at the edges of the material, which act as active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The FTIR analysis identifies the roles of BOB and BOH groups under reaction conditions, confirming their involvement in the catalytic process. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES) measurements determine the residual content of sodium in the hydroxylation process, ensuring the purity of the catalyst.

In summary, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are optimized to enhance catalytic performance through enhanced surface area, efficient mass transport, and localized catalysis. The incorporation of B active components is achieved through specific treatment processes that generate active sites capable of selectively catalyzing desired reactions while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

用于整合B活性成分的方法包括将纯硼氮化物与硝酸钠溶液处理，随后在高温下进行蒸汽活化。这一过程在材料边缘生成BOH组分，作为氧化脱氢反应的活性位点。FTIR分析确定了反应条件下BOB和BOH组分的作用，证实了它们在催化过程中的参与。电感耦合等离子体光谱分析（ICPOES）测量确定了水解过程中的钠残留量，确保了催化剂的纯度。

总之，B基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔框架结构中的结构特征优化了催化性能，通过增加表面积、促进物质传输和局部催化作用来实现。将B活性成分整合到这些结构中的方法通过特定的处理过程生成活性位点，这些位点能够选择性地催化所需反应，同时最小化不希望的副反应。

BNOH催化剂继承了六边形层状结构的硼氮化物（图S3）。通过正畸校正透射电子显微镜（TEM）分析，发现平面晶格保留了六边形对称性，并且在蒸汽活化过程中产生了大量新的边缘（图2a、图S4和S5）。沿[001]方向的TEM图像揭示了最常暴露的横向终止面是{10 0}、{01 0}和{1 00}，这表明终止配置具有锯齿边缘。在边缘处，发生了晶格松弛和变形（图2a和图S7）。

BNOH催化剂表面存在两种类型的硼物种（图2c）：一种与氮原子共价结合在平坦表面上，另一种则在边缘与氧原子结合。2D 11B多重量子（MQ）魔角旋转（MAS）核磁共振（NMR）谱图及其结构模型（图2d，插图）验证了边缘硼与氧的化学环境。

傅立叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）分析显示了羟基伸缩振动的特征带，位于约3400cm-1（图3a）。在530°C下，C3H8气氛中，羟基振动带的位置保持不变，没有检测到丙烷转化（图3a）。然而，在添加分子氧（O2/C3H8/He）后，羟基振动带逐渐减弱，伴随着丙烯的形成，这表明OH团簇与分子氧相互作用并融入反应网络。蒸汽活化后，羟基振动带的强度完全恢复（图3a和图S9），这表明OH团簇可以迅速再生。

在使用去氘化BNOH（D）催化剂时，将C3H8和O2脉冲注入530°C下，立即形成了HDO和D2O，随后这些物质的量逐渐减少（图3b和图S10）。这表明BNOH（D）催化剂中的H/D原子在反应过程中被抽取。相邻的氧原子也参与了反应过程。如果将BNOH催化剂暴露于含有18O2和C3H8的混合气体中（图3c），则产生了H216O和H218O，这表明16O原子在BOH团簇中参与了H216O分子的形成。随后的脉冲过程中，H218O的量持续增加而H216O的量减少，进一步证实了16O和18O之间的同位素交换发生在BNOH边缘位点上。

密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明两个相邻的BOH团簇可以通过过渡态以四元环的形式脱水，从而形成BOB桥。可逆地，气态H2O可以插入BOB桥来恢复两个相邻的BOH团簇。刚形成的H218O在ODH过程中参与BOB桥的断裂，通过这种方式实现了gaseous 18O和BNOH边缘位点上16O之间的同位素交换，使边缘BOH位点保持其活性状态（图S11）。

在BNOH催化剂上进行的丙烷ODH动力学行为实验支持了原位FTIR和同位素标记实验的结果。首先，获得了两种反应物，丙烷和氧气，转换速率随反应温度变化的激活能（Ea）。发现丙烷转换的Ea为184kJ/mol，低于Hermans等人的报告值。在BNOH催化系统中，氧气激活的Ea估计高于丙烷转换的Ea，这意味着在氧气激活后，CH键的断裂更容易发生。这一结论进一步得到验证，测量了CH键断裂的同位素效应（KIEs）。初级氢抽象（k1,CH/k1,CD=1.4，使用C3H8和CH3CD2CH3作为反应物）和二级氢抽象（k2,CH/k2,CD=1.5，使用CH3CD2CH3和C3D8作为反应物）的低KIEs也表明在我们的BNOH催化系统中，丙烷ODH中CH键的断裂很容易发生，支持了激活能测量结果。

此外，通过测量反应速率随反应物浓度的变化，研究了动力学行为（图4c和图4d）。氧气浓度的Langmuir型依赖对应于分子氧吸附或激活在催化剂表面的反应机制。丙烷浓度的二次依赖表明丙烷直接从气相与表面活性氧物种反应。这种方法不仅为选择性激活烷烃中的CH键打开了新的研究方向，而且作为工业ODH过程的潜在催化剂具有高潜力。

实验部分详细描述了催化剂的制备和表征方法。BNOH催化剂的合成包括高温固相反应、蒸汽活化和钠辅助处理等步骤。通过原位FTIR和同位素标记实验，证明了BNOH催化剂高效催化丙烷氧化脱氢，具有优异的选择性和显著降低的CO2排放。氢原子从BOH团簇由分子氧抽取，动态生成活性位点，触发丙烷脱氢反应。这种新型无金属催化剂系统不仅开辟了选择性激活烷烃中CH键的新研究方向，而且为工业ODH过程提供了高度有潜力的催化剂。

综上所述，B基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔框架结构中，通过其独特的结构特征和活性位点增强了催化性能，实现了选择性激活丙烷中的CH键并避免丙烯过氧化。通过各种方法，如蒸汽活化，有效地整合B活性成分到这些结构中，这些方法根据不同的催化应用具有不同的有效性。这些方法通过创造动态活性位点来增强催化性能，这些活性位点对于高效催化至关重要。这些方法在不同催化应用中的效果各不相同，但它们都共同促进了催化性能的整体提升。
