[1] "Recently, Hermans's group reported that boron nitride exhibits a high selectivity to propylene (79%) and ethylene (12%) at 14% conversion in the ODH reaction of propane."
[2] "Nevertheless, in view of activity, selectivity, and stability, there is still room for improvements, and a detailed structural characterization of this novel catalytic system and a better understanding of the structureactivity correlation in the ODH reaction of propane are still needed."
[3] "The BNOH catalyst provided surprisingly high selectivity toward propylene during ODH of propane at 530C. The conversion of propane approached 20.6%, which is equivalent to a reaction rate of 7.74g gcat1h1; the product slate consisted of propylene, ethylene, methane, CO, and CO2."
[4] "Taking the equally important product ethylene into account, the selectivity for light olefins (ethylene+propylene, C23=) was up to 90.9%, which was much higher than the selectivities obtained over the well-developed metal or metal oxide catalysts at a comparable propane conversion level, as well as over carbon and carbonaceous materials."
[5] "Moreover, the selectivity toward propylene can be further promoted by mediating the reaction conditions. For example, propylene selectivity of 97.4% (C23=: 99.1%) was obtained at 510C at a propane conversion level of 6.5%; whereas it approached 59.8% (C23=: 76.3%) at 540C with a propane conversion level of 38.2%."
[6] "The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst in the ODH of propane was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test at 530C, in which no significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity occurred (Figure1b), demonstrating the potential for industrial application."
[7] "The BNOH catalyst inherited a hexagonal layered structure of boron nitride (FigureS3)."
[8] "Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation (Figure2a, FiguresS4 and S5)."
[9] "Boron K-edge electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM mode (Figure2b and FigureS8) showed that the edge possesses a higher π* to σ* ratio (1.27, point2) than that (0.52, point4) of the in-plane, primarily because of the local warp or wrinkle at the edge,9 and the B/N ratio (1.28, point2) at the edge was higher than that (0.95, point4) of the in-plane (Figure2b)."
[10] "There were two types of boron species (Figure2c); one was coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface whereas the other was bonded to oxygen at the edge.10 The chemical environment for the coordination between boron and oxygen was further verified by the 2D 11B multiple quantum (MQ) magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectrum of the BNOH catalyst (Figure2d)."
[11] "During subsequent pulses, the amount of H218O continuously increased while the amount of H216O decreased, further verifying the isotopic exchange between 16O sites at the BNOH edge and gaseous 18O2."
[12] "Initially, the apparent activation energies (Ea) of two reactants, propane and oxygen, were obtained by evaluating the dependence of their converting rates on the reaction temperature."
[13] "This deduction was further verified by measuring the kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) of CH cleavage."
[14] "A Langmuir-type dependence on oxygen concentration corresponds with a reaction mechanism that is controlled by adsorption or activation of molecular oxygen on the catalyst surface."
[15] "Prior to testing, the catalyst was heated to 560C at a rate of 10Cmin1 in 20vol.% O2/N2 and maintained at this temperature for 1h."
[16] "The reaction mixture was C3H8/O2/He with a molar ratio of 1/1.5/3.5 at atmospheric pressure."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves examining the unique properties that enable enhanced catalytic performance. In the context of the literature, boron nitride (BN) exhibits high selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene. The BNOH catalyst, after steam activation, shows remarkable stability and high selectivity, with a conversion of propane approaching 20.6% and a selectivity for propylene reaching 80.2%. The presence of edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BOH) at the edges of the BN structure is crucial for the selective activation of the CH bond in propane, thereby avoiding overoxidation to CO2.

The structural enhancements in the BNOH catalyst include the creation of numerous edges during steam activation, which leads to a higher π* to σ* ratio compared to the in-plane structure, indicating localized distortions or wrinkles. These edges are enriched with boron-nitrogen (B/N) ratios that are higher than those in the plane, and they contain both boron species coordinated with nitrogen and bonded to oxygen. The presence of BOH groups at the edges plays a key role in the selective activation of the CH bond in propane, facilitating the formation of propylene without overoxidation.

To incorporate B active components into these structures effectively, the literature suggests several methods, including hydroxylation, which creates BOH groups that are crucial for the catalytic activity. These methods allow for the enhancement of catalytic performance by providing a 3-D dispersion of active sites within the porous framework of the material. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application, with the BNOH catalyst demonstrating improved selectivity and stability in the ODH of propane.

The literature further discusses the kinetic behavior of the ODH reaction, showing that the cleavage of CH bonds readily occurs after the activation of oxygen on the BNOH catalyst. This supports the conclusion that the BOH groups dynamically generate active sites, triggering the propane dehydrogenation process. The kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) of CH cleavage indicate that the cleavage of CH bonds is facilitated in the BNOH catalytic system, further supporting the enhanced selectivity towards propylene.

The structural characterization of the BNOH catalyst provides insights into the active sites and their interactions with reactants. The use of advanced techniques like electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) reveals the chemical environment around the boron atoms, highlighting the importance of the BOH groups in the reaction network. The ability of these groups to interact with molecular oxygen and undergo dynamic exchange with isotopic oxygen molecules demonstrates their role in the catalytic cycle.

In summary, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as the BNOH catalyst, contribute to enhanced catalytic performance through selective activation of the CH bond in propane, avoidance of overoxidation, and dynamic generation of active sites. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through methods like hydroxylation, which facilitates the creation of edge-hydroxylated boron nitride groups. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated through improved selectivity, stability, and kinetic behavior in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

分析硼基材料中三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特性，涉及到对能够增强催化性能的独特性质的考察。文献中提到，硼氮化物（BN）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）到丙烯中表现出高选择性。在蒸汽激活后，BNOH催化剂显示出出色的稳定性和高选择性，丙烷转化接近20.6%，丙烯选择性达到80.2%。边缘羟基化的硼氮化物（BOH）在BN结构边缘的存在对于选择性活化丙烷中的CH键至关重要，从而避免了向二氧化碳的过氧化。

BNOH催化剂的结构改进包括在蒸汽激活过程中创建大量边缘，导致边缘与平面相比具有更高的π*到σ*比，这表明局部扭曲或皱纹的存在。这些边缘的硼氮（B/N）比率高于平面，且包含与氮协同的硼原子和与边缘氧键合的两种硼物种。边缘BOH组分在选择性活化丙烷中的CH键中起关键作用，通过这种方式促进丙烯的形成，同时避免过氧化为二氧化碳。

为了有效地将B活性成分整合到这些结构中，文献提出了一些方法，包括羟基化，这种方法创造了BOH组分，对催化活性至关重要。这些方法允许在材料的多孔框架中增强催化性能，提供三维分散的活性位点。这些方法的有效性因具体催化应用而异，BNOH催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中显示出改进的选择性和稳定性。

文献进一步讨论了ODH反应的动力学行为，表明在BNOH催化剂上激活氧气后，CH键的断裂可以轻易发生。这支持结论，即BOH组分动态生成活性位点，触发丙烷脱氢过程。同位素效应（KIEs）表明CH键的断裂在BNOH催化系统中得到促进，进一步支持了对丙烯的增强选择性。

BNOH催化剂的结构表征提供了有关活性位点及其与反应物相互作用的见解。使用高级技术如电子能量损失谱（EELS）和核磁共振（NMR）揭示了硼原子周围的化学环境，突出了BOH组分在反应网络中的作用。这些组分能够与分子氧相互作用并进行动态交换与同位素氧分子之间的同位素交换，证明了它们在催化循环中的作用。

综上所述，硼基材料中三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特性，如BNOH催化剂，通过选择性活化丙烷中的CH键、避免过氧化以及动态生成活性位点，贡献了增强的催化性能。通过羟基化等方法整合B活性成分到这些结构中，实现了边缘羟基化的硼氮化物组分的创造。这些方法的有效性通过丙烷氧化脱氢到丙烯过程中的改进选择性、稳定性和动力学行为得到了证明。
