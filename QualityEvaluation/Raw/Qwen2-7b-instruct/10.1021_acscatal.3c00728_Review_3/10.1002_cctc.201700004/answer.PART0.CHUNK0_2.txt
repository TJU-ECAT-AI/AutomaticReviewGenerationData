Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, the literature highlights several key features that enhance catalytic performance. The edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) catalyst, for instance, exhibits high selectivity for propylene production in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This selectivity is attributed to the dynamic generation of active BNO. sites through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen. These sites selectively break the CH bond in propane without allowing overoxidation of propylene to CO2. Moreover, the stability of the BNOH catalyst is remarkable, as evidenced by its ability to maintain steady conversion and product selectivity over a 300-hour test at 530°C. The selectivity for propylene increases to 97.4% at a 6.5% conversion level of propane, demonstrating the potential for efficient and selective catalysis.

The incorporation of boron active components into porous frameworks is achieved through various methods, including hydroxylation and activation processes. These methods effectively introduce 3-D dispersed active sites that contribute to enhanced catalytic performance. For different catalytic applications, the effectiveness of these incorporation methods varies based on factors such as the desired selectivity, stability, and reaction conditions. The literature provides insights into the structural analysis of these materials, including the presence of zigzag edges and the chemical environment around boron and oxygen atoms, which are crucial for understanding the catalytic mechanisms and optimizing their performance.

In summary, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as the edge-hydroxylated boron nitride catalyst, enable high selectivity and stability in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The methods used to incorporate boron active components into these structures are effective for achieving desired catalytic properties, although the choice of method depends on the specific application and desired outcomes.

分析硼基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔框架结构中的结构特性，文献强调了几种增强催化性能的关键特征。例如，边羟基化硼氮化物（BNOH）催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯过程中表现出高选择性。这种选择性的归因在于分子氧通过氢抽象作用于BOH基团动态生成活性BNO. 站点，这些站点通过选择性断裂CH键而不允许丙烯过氧化为CO2的方式触发丙烷脱氢。此外，BNOH催化剂的稳定性非常显著，其能够维持300小时测试中530°C下的稳定转化率和产品选择性。当丙烷转化率为6.5%时，丙烯的选择性可高达97.4%，这表明了高效和选择性催化的能力。

将硼活性成分引入孔框架结构的方法包括水解和活化过程等，这些方法有效地引入了三维分散的活性位点，从而增强了催化性能。对于不同的催化应用，这些集成方法的有效性会根据所需的选择性、稳定性和反应条件等因素而有所不同。文献提供了对这些材料的结构分析的见解，包括边缘的锯齿形边缘和硼氧原子周围的化学环境，这对于理解催化机制并优化其性能至关重要。

综上所述，硼基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔框架结构中的结构特性，如边羟基化硼氮化物催化剂，能够在氧化脱氢反应中实现高选择性和稳定性。用于集成硼活性成分到这些结构中的方法对于实现所需的催化性质是有效的，但根据特定应用和期望结果，选择方法可能会有所不同。
