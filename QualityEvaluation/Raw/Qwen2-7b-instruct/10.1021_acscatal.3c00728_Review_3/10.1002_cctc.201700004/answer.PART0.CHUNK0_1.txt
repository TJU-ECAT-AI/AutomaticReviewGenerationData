[1] "Recently, Hermans's group reported that boron nitride exhibits a high selectivity to propylene (79%) and ethylene (12%) at 14% conversion in the ODH reaction of propane."
[2] "Nevertheless, in view of activity, selectivity, and stability, there is still room for improvements, and a detailed structural characterization of this novel catalytic system and a better understanding of the structureactivity correlation in the ODH reaction of propane are still needed."
[3] "The BNOH catalyst provided surprisingly high selectivity toward propylene during ODH of propane at 530C."
[4] "In particular, the selectivity was 80.2% for propylene and only 0.5% for CO2."
[5] "Taking the equally important product ethylene into account, the selectivity for light olefins (ethylene+propylene, C23=) was up to 90.9%, which was much higher than the selectivities obtained over the well-developed metal or metal oxide catalysts at a comparable propane conversion level."
[6] "Moreover, the formation of CO2 (0.5%) was considerably lower than for the traditional ODH processes (1060% CO2), demonstrating the excellent performance of the current BNOH catalyst in the selective activation of the CH bond in propane."
[7] "The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst in the ODH of propane was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test at 530C, in which no significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity occurred."
[8] "The characteristic band of hydroxyl stretching vibration was clearly observed at approximately 3400cm−1."
[9] "With the addition of molecular oxygen (O2/C3H8/He), however, the absorption of hydroxyl vibrational stretches gradually weakened, accompanied with the formation of propylene."
[10] "If C3H8 and O2 were pulsed into the deuterated BNOH(D) catalyst at 530C, both HDO and D2O were formed immediately, and their amounts gradually decreased during subsequent pulses."
[11] "This means that the cleavage of CH bonds readily happens after oxygen activation in the BNOH catalytic system for the ODH of propane."
[12] "Moreover, the effect of reactant concentrations on the reaction rate was measured to investigate the kinetic behaviors."
[13] "Consequently, the cleavage of CH bonds readily happens in our BNOH catalytic system for propane ODH."
[14] "Under our typical evaluating conditions, the carbon balance was within 3%."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves examining the unique properties that enable enhanced catalytic performance. These materials often feature interconnected pores and channels that facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products, optimizing the surface-to-volume ratio for efficient catalysis. The presence of 3-D dispersed active sites ensures a more uniform distribution of activity throughout the material, which can lead to improved selectivity and activity compared to traditional catalysts with more localized active centers. The use of boron (B) as the active component allows for the creation of stable, high-performance catalysts that can withstand harsh conditions and maintain their activity over extended periods.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures typically involve chemical treatments, such as hydrothermal activation or impregnation, which enable the formation of functional groups (like hydroxyl groups) on the surface or edges of the B-based materials. These functional groups act as catalyst promoters, enhancing the reactivity of the B sites towards specific reactions. For instance, the edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) catalyst reported in the literature demonstrates high selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This is achieved through the dynamic generation of active BNO. sites that selectively cleave the CH bond in propane while suppressing overoxidation to CO2, thus achieving superior selectivity and stability.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For reactions requiring high selectivity, materials with precisely controlled surface chemistry and pore structures are essential. For reactions with more tolerant conditions, simpler methods like impregnation might suffice. The critical evaluation of these methods includes assessing factors such as catalyst stability, activity, and cost-effectiveness, as well as the ease of scale-up for industrial applications.

To critically evaluate the methods used, one must consider the synthesis conditions, the type of B-based material, the nature of the functional groups introduced, and the impact of these modifications on the overall catalytic performance. For example, in the case of BNOH, the steam activation process creates a high density of hydroxyl groups on the edges of the boron nitride framework, which dynamically interact with molecular oxygen to generate active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This approach not only enhances the selectivity towards propylene but also minimizes the formation of undesired byproducts like CO2, showcasing the potential for industrial-scale applications.

分析基于B材料的三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特征，涉及研究这些特性如何增强催化性能。这些材料通常具有相互连接的孔隙和通道，可以优化表面积与体积比，从而提高反应物和产物的扩散效率。三维分散的活性位点确保了活性中心在整个材料中更均匀的分布，这可能导致与传统催化剂相比更高的选择性和活性。将硼（B）作为活性成分允许创建稳定且高性能的催化剂，它们能够承受苛刻条件，并维持其活性长达数小时。

用于将B活性成分整合到这些结构中的方法通常包括化学处理，如水热激活或浸渍，这些处理允许在材料表面或边缘形成功能性基团（如羟基）。这些功能性基团作为催化剂促进剂，增强了B位点对特定反应的活性。例如，报告的边氢化硼氮化物（BNOH）催化剂通过动态生成活性BNO.位点实现了高丙烷氧化脱氢选择性至丙烯，这些位点选择性地断裂丙烷中的CH键，同时抑制丙烯过氧化为CO2，从而实现优越的选择性和稳定性。

根据具体应用的不同，这些方法的有效性也有所不同。对于需要高选择性的反应，必须有精确控制的表面化学和孔结构。对于条件更为宽容的反应，可能仅需简单的浸渍方法就足够了。对这些方法的批判性评价应考虑合成条件、B基材料的类型、引入的功能基团的性质以及这些修改对整体催化性能的影响。例如，在BNOH的情况下，蒸汽活化过程在硼氮化物骨架的边缘上产生了高密度的羟基基团，这些基团动态与分子氧相互作用以生成活性位点进行丙烷氧化脱氢。这种方法不仅提高了向丙烯的选择性，而且最大程度地减少了不希望产生的副产品如CO2的形成，展示了工业规模应用的潜力。
