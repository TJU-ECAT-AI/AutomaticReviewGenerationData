The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance due to their ability to provide ample exposure of the active center, facilitate mass transfer, and optimize the reaction environment. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through various methods such as the use of organic structure-directing agents (OSDAs) and hydrothermal treatment. These methods are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly in enhancing the selectivity and activity of zeolite-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of 3-D dispersed active sites in the porous framework allows for better interaction with reactants and products, thereby improving the overall catalytic efficiency.
