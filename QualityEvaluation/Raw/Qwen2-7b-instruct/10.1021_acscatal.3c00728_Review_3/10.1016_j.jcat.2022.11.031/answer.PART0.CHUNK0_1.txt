The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance due to increased accessibility and reactivity of the active sites. These features facilitate efficient mass transfer and direct interaction with reactants. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through various methods such as impregnation, co-precipitation, and ion exchange. Each method has its relative effectiveness depending on the specific catalytic application, the desired B loading, and the stability requirements. For instance, impregnation methods are effective for loading B onto existing porous supports, while co-precipitation allows for better control over the B dispersion and structure integration within the support material.
