Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, these materials demonstrate enhanced catalytic performance due to their unique features. The 3-D dispersed active sites within the porous frameworks provide a high surface area for reactant adsorption, facilitating faster reaction kinetics. The porous nature of these frameworks promotes efficient mass transfer and allows for easy diffusion of reactants and products, contributing to increased catalytic efficiency. Moreover, the incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through various methods, including sol-gel processes and impregnation techniques. Each method has its relative effectiveness depending on the desired catalytic application. For instance, the sol-gel process allows for precise control over the boron loading and distribution, making it suitable for applications requiring uniform active site dispersion. Impregnation techniques, on the other hand, are advantageous for modifying existing materials with B additives, enhancing their catalytic properties without altering the base framework significantly. These strategies enable the optimization of B-based materials for various catalytic tasks, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, where the EBZ catalyst showcases improved olefin and propylene selectivity over conventional borosilicate zeolites.
