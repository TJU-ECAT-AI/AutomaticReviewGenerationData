The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance due to the presence of numerous active sites for reactions. These features facilitate efficient mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is typically achieved through methods such as co-precipitation, impregnation, or ion-exchange, depending on the material and application. These methods can be effective for various catalytic applications, including the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, where they contribute to increased selectivity and improved performance.
