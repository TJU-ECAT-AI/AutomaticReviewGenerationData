The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are highlighted in the literature, emphasizing their ability to enhance catalytic performance. The materials feature a diverse and adjustable crystal structure that allows for tuning of activity and selectivity. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is discussed, with a focus on the role of boron sites in open coordination as the active center for catalytic reactions. The literature evaluates various methods for integrating B active components into these structures, noting their effectiveness for different catalytic applications. Key findings include an 20% improvement in propylene selectivity at 21.5% propane conversion, achieved through the use of embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalysts. The presence of H-bonded BOH groups is identified as the active center for the activation of propane and triggering gas-phase reactions. The literature suggests that the strengthened gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, increasing the reaction order from 1.06 to 2.30, thus providing a new insight for boosting propylene selectivity in zeolite-based catalysts.
