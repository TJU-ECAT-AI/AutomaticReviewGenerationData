Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how high surface area and the distribution of boron species within the material contribute to enhanced catalytic performance. Boron nitride (BN) materials, due to their unique properties such as high thermal stability, chemical inertness, and electrical insulation, serve as effective catalyst supports. The incorporation of boron into BN materials through methods like impregnation, co-precipitation, and plasma treatment leads to the creation of 3-D dispersed active sites that facilitate efficient propane conversion to olefins. The high surface area of BN catalysts, in conjunction with the 3-D dispersion of active sites, significantly improves catalytic performance, especially at high conversion rates. Among the methods used to incorporate boron, plasma treatment has been found to offer superior results for certain catalytic applications.
