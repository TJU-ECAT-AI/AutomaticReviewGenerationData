Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1. The study utilized density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore the interaction between on- and off-surface processes during the B2O3-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It was found that B-based materials with three-dimensional dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit enhanced catalytic performance due to an increase in surface area and improved accessibility to reactants.
2. The methods for integrating B active components into these structures included chemical vapor deposition and impregnation techniques. These approaches are effective for different catalytic applications depending on the specific requirements and properties sought in the final product.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>
