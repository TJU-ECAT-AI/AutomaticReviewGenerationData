The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance by facilitating better diffusion of reactants and products within the catalyst. These features enable more efficient conversion of reactants into products during oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through a precise synthesis method, ensuring effective dispersion of B species, which leads to improved catalytic activity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
