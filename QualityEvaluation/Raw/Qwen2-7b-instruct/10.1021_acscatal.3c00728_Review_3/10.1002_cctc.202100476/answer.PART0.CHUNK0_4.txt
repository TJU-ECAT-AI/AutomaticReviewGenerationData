[1] "A novel one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst has been prepared by a feasible and easy-to-use electrospinning method."
[2] "The nanofiber catalysts with different h-BN loading showed excellent catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane due to the one-dimensional structure and evenly dispersion of h-BN in the support, as evidenced by high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity."
[3] "Meanwhile, the olefins productivity over h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was much higher than reported boron nitride-based catalysts."
[4] "The key is to prepare uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN."
[5] "The diameters of the nanofiber catalysts can be tuned in the range of 150-300 nm through h-BN loading change."
[6] "When used in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the obtained nanofibrous catalysts exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1."

The document discusses the fabrication and application of a one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The catalyst, prepared via electrospinning, exhibits high olefins productivity, with 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 achieved at 500°C under a space velocity of 48,000 ml/gcat·h. This is notably higher than previously reported boron nitride-based catalysts. The structure of the nanofibers allows for an even dispersion of h-BN, contributing to high propane conversion and propylene selectivity. The size of the nanofibers can be adjusted by modifying the h-BN loading, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency.

文档讨论了一种一维h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂用于丙烷氧化脱氢的应用。通过静电纺丝制备的催化剂，在500°C下，以48,000 ml/gcat·h的空间速度下，实现了24.9golefinsgBN1h1的高烯烃产率。这明显高于之前报道的硼氮化合物催化剂。纳米纤维的结构使得h-BN均匀分散，从而促进了高丙烷转化和丙烯选择性。可以通过调整h-BN的负载量来改变纳米纤维的尺寸，提高催化剂的效率。
