[1] "The obtained spinning solution was ejected from the needle at a certain rate through a syringe pump. Under the action of electric field force, the charged spinning solution breaks through its surface tension to form the Taylor cone. Then, with the solvent instantly evaporated, the dried h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber was collected on the aluminum foil."
[2] "When used in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the obtained nanofibrous catalysts exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, which is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date."
[3] "This study shines light on the specific one-dimensional fibrous structure containing dispersed h-BN as well as a new strategy of preparing more efficient boron-based catalysts in the ODHP process."
[4] "The carbon balance was checked by comparing the number of moles of carbon in the outlet stream to the number of moles of carbon in the feed. Under our typical evaluating conditions, the carbon balance was within 100%5%."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these features enhance catalytic performance. The literature demonstrates that the incorporation of B active components into porous frameworks, specifically through the use of electrospinning to create one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofibers, significantly improves catalytic efficiency. The presence of 3-D dispersed active sites, like those found in h-BN, facilitates better exposure of the active sites, allowing for higher conversion rates and selectivities in reactions such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

The effectiveness of incorporating B active components into these structures varies depending on the specific application. For instance, the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalysts showed remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, which is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts. This highlights the potential of this strategy for preparing more efficient boron-based catalysts in ODHP processes, offering a new approach to enhance the space utilization of B and the productivity of olefins.

Regarding the carbon balance, the literature confirms that under typical evaluating conditions, the carbon balance is maintained within a tight range of 100% to 5%, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the catalytic performance assessment.

In conclusion, the literature provides insights into the design and performance of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, emphasizing the effectiveness of electrospinning techniques for creating nanofibers that exhibit improved catalytic properties compared to bulk catalysts.

分析硼基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔性框架中的结构特征，涉及理解这些特征如何增强催化性能。文献表明，通过电纺技术将硼活性成分引入孔性框架中，尤其是形成一维的BN/SiO2纳米纤维，显著提高了催化效率。三维分散的活性位点的存在，如在BN中的，促进了活性位点的更好暴露，从而在烷烃氧化脱氢等反应中实现了更高的转化率和选择性。

对于将硼活性成分融入这些结构的有效性，具体取决于特定应用的不同需求。例如，BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂展示了惊人的烯烃产率，为每克BN达到24.9golefinsgBN1h1，这比传统的ODHP催化剂高出5倍以上。这凸显了这一策略在ODHP过程中制备更高效硼基催化剂的潜力，提供了增强B的空间利用率和烯烃产率的新途径。

关于碳平衡，文献证实，在典型评估条件下，碳平衡保持在100%到5%的范围内，确保了催化性能评估的准确性和完整性。

综上所述，文献提供了关于硼基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔性框架设计和性能的见解，强调了电纺技术用于制造具有改进催化性质的纳米纤维的有效性，与传统催化剂相比。
