[1] "Fabrication of h-BN/SiO2 Nanofibers Showing High Olefins Productivity in Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane"
[2] "When used in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the obtained nanofibrous catalysts exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, which is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date."
[3] "This study shines light on the specific one-dimensional fibrous structure containing dispersed h-BN as well as a new strategy of preparing more efficient boron-based catalysts in the ODHP process."
[4] "Meanwhile, there is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability."
[5] "Moreover, the abundant OH groups of SiO2 support can promote the anchoring and dispersity of h-BN."
[6] "The obtained spinning solution was ejected from the needle at a certain rate through a syringe pump. Under the action of electric field force, the charged spinning solution breaks through its surface tension to form the Taylor cone. Then, with the solvent instantly evaporated, the dried h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber was collected on the aluminum foil."
[7] "The TEM and STEM-EDX mapping images of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst (Figure2fh) showed that the h-BN was uniformly dispersed on the dense SiO2 support."
[8] "The presence of h-BN has no effect on the amorphous structure of the SiO2."
[9] "The one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."
[10] "The olefins productivity over h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was much higher than reported boron nitride-based catalysts."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding the unique features of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and silica oxide (SiO2) nanofibers. The electrospinning method, as utilized in this study, enables the preparation of one-dimensional nanofibers that contain dispersed h-BN, enhancing catalytic performance through the promotion of active site exposure and facilitating mass transfer. The incorporation of h-BN into the SiO2 framework is critical for the catalyst's efficiency, as the abundant OH groups of the SiO2 support aid in anchoring and dispersing the h-BN. This results in a catalyst with a high olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, significantly surpassing that of bulk catalysts. The one-dimensional fibrous structure of the catalyst, combined with the dispersion of h-BN, leads to improved activity, selectivity, and stability, providing a new strategy for the preparation of more efficient boron-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The interaction between the nanoparticles and the support ensures the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and long-term stability, which are crucial for practical applications.

The use of the electrospinning method for preparing one-dimensional nanomaterials, such as the h-BN/SiO2 nanofibers, is particularly advantageous due to its ease of use and the ability to adjust the chemical and physical properties of the nanofibers by modifying the conditions of the electrospinning process. This method allows for the tuning of the nanofiber diameter, which impacts the catalyst's performance by affecting the surface area and thus the number of active sites available for catalysis. The successful integration of h-BN into the SiO2 framework through the electrospinning process facilitates the creation of a catalyst with a high density of active sites, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency and productivity.

The structural characteristics of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofibers, including the one-dimensional fibrous structure and the 3-D dispersion of h-BN, are key factors contributing to the superior catalytic performance observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. These features enable efficient mass transfer and expose a large number of active sites, leading to high conversion rates and selectivities towards desired products. The high olefins productivity achieved with this catalyst demonstrates its potential for industrial applications, offering a significant improvement over traditional bulk catalysts. The strategy employed in this study, which combines the use of h-BN and SiO2 in a nanofiber matrix, represents a promising avenue for the development of more efficient boron-based catalysts for various catalytic reactions.
