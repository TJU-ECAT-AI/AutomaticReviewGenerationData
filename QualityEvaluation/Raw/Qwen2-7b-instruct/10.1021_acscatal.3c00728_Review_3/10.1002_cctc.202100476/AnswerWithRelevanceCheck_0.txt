Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves understanding how these features enhance catalytic performance. The literature demonstrates that the incorporation of B active components into porous frameworks, specifically through the use of electrospinning to create one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofibers, significantly improves catalytic efficiency. The presence of 3-D dispersed active sites, like those found in h-BN, facilitates better exposure of the active sites, allowing for higher conversion rates and selectivities in reactions such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

The effectiveness of incorporating B active components into these structures varies depending on the specific application. For instance, the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalysts showed remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, which is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts. This highlights the potential of this strategy for preparing more efficient boron-based catalysts in ODHP processes, offering a new approach to enhance the space utilization of B and the productivity of olefins.

Regarding the carbon balance, the literature confirms that under typical evaluating conditions, the carbon balance is maintained within a tight range of 100% to 5%, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the catalytic performance assessment.

In conclusion, the literature provides insights into the design and performance of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, emphasizing the effectiveness of electrospinning techniques for creating nanofibers that exhibit improved catalytic properties compared to bulk catalysts.
