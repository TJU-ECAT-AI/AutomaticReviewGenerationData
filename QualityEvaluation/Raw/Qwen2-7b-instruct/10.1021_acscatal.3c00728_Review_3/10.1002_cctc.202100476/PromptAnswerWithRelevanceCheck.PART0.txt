Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involves examining the unique properties of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and its incorporation into porous frameworks. The literature highlights that h-BN, as an inorganic nonmetallic catalyst, shows promise in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for propane. The structural features that enhance catalytic performance include the specific one-dimensional fibrous structure containing dispersed h-BN. The ability to tune the diameter of the nanofiber catalysts to a range of 150-300 nm through h-BN loading changes contributes to the efficient utilization of surface area and facilitates mass transfer, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures involve electrospinning, which allows for the preparation of one-dimensional nanomaterials with tunable diameters. The literature demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in preparing nanofibrous catalysts that exhibit improved catalytic performance compared to traditional bulk catalysts. The dispersion of h-BN on a dense silica support (SiO2) ensures a uniform distribution of active sites, which is crucial for optimal catalytic activity.

The literature also emphasizes the importance of the active origin and reaction mechanism of h-BN in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of BOH groups at the edges and defects of h-BN is proposed as the active site for the activation of alkane molecules. This finding aligns with spectroscopic studies that support the role of these functional groups in promoting the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

Furthermore, the literature discusses the comparative effectiveness of incorporating h-BN into porous frameworks versus traditional bulk catalysts. The nanofibrous catalysts show significantly higher olefins productivity, demonstrating the enhanced catalytic efficiency achieved through the strategic design of the material's structure. The specific one-dimensional fibrous structure, combined with the dispersed h-BN, results in a catalyst that outperforms conventional bulk catalysts in terms of propylene selectivity and olefins productivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

Critically evaluating the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures reveals that electrospinning is a versatile and effective technique that allows for precise control over the size and shape of the nanofibers. This controllability is essential for optimizing the catalytic performance of B-based materials. The integration of h-BN into porous frameworks through electrospinning not only enhances the surface area available for reactions but also promotes efficient mass transfer, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity.

In conclusion, the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as the one-dimensional fibrous structure and the uniform dispersion of h-BN, contribute significantly to their enhanced catalytic performance. The effectiveness of incorporating B active components into these structures is demonstrated through the use of electrospinning, which enables the preparation of catalysts with superior properties for oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The findings presented in the literature highlight the potential of these materials for developing more efficient boron-based catalysts in various industrial applications.
