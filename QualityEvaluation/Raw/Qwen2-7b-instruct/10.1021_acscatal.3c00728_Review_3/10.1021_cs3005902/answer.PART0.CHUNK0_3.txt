Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals that these features enhance catalytic performance through improved accessibility of active sites. The incorporation of boron (B) into the titania framework increases surface area and porosity, facilitating better adsorption and diffusion of reactants. Methods for integrating B active components include co-precipitation, impregnation, and ion-exchange techniques, with co-precipitation proving particularly effective for achieving uniform dispersion. These materials demonstrate high activity, selectivity, stability, and recyclability in partial hydrogenation reactions.
