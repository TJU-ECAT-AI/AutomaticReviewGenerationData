Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance by ensuring uniform dispersion and stability of the boron species on the open fiber framework. The open one-dimensional fiber structure facilitates easy diffusion, allowing for high catalytic activity even at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. The porous framework prevents diffusion limitations and maintains high selectivity and stability compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through electrospinning, offering a new approach for the synthesis of highly efficient boron-based catalysts. The methods used to incorporate B active components into porous frameworks are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly in the ODH of alkanes, where the presence of SiOH groups can negatively impact propylene selectivity. Transient analysis and kinetic experiments reveal that the activation of O2 is influenced by alkanes during the ODH reaction, providing insights into the reaction pathway over boron-based catalysts.

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, the literature highlights several key features that enhance catalytic performance. One-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSN) synthesized through electrospinning offer a uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open fiber framework, crucial for optimal catalytic activity. The porous structure facilitates easy diffusion, ensuring high catalytic activity even at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts demonstrate higher olefin selectivity and stability, making them more effective for the ODH of light alkanes. The literature also reveals that the presence of SiOH groups in silica-supported boron catalysts can lead to lower propylene selectivity during ODH reactions. Additionally, the stability of the catalyst structure, including the porous framework and immobilized boron species, contributes to the overall catalytic efficiency. The uniform and stable structure of PBSN materials makes them ideal for understanding the reaction pathways of ODH over boron-based catalysts, offering insights into the role of alkanes in the activation of oxygen molecules.
