Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, the literature highlights several key features that enhance catalytic performance. One-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSN) synthesized through electrospinning offer a uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open fiber framework, crucial for optimal catalytic activity. The porous structure facilitates easy diffusion, ensuring high catalytic activity even at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts demonstrate higher olefin selectivity and stability, making them more effective for the ODH of light alkanes. The literature also reveals that the presence of SiOH groups in silica-supported boron catalysts can lead to lower propylene selectivity during ODH reactions. Additionally, the stability of the catalyst structure, including the porous framework and immobilized boron species, contributes to the overall catalytic efficiency. The uniform and stable structure of PBSN materials makes them ideal for understanding the reaction pathways of ODH over boron-based catalysts, offering insights into the role of alkanes in the activation of oxygen molecules.
