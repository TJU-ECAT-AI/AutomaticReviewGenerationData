The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance. The use of porous frameworks ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species, which leads to high catalytic activity. The one-dimensional fiber structure facilitates easy diffusion, allowing for high activity at high weight hourly space velocities (WHSV) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, the PBSN catalysts demonstrate superior olefin selectivity and stability. The activation of oxygen is influenced by alkanes during the ODH reaction, providing insights into the reaction pathway over boron-based catalysts.

3-D分散在多孔框架中的B基材料的结构特征显著提高了催化性能。使用多孔框架确保了硼物种的均匀分散和稳定性，这导致了高催化活性。一维纤维结构有利于扩散，允许在烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）中在高重量小时空间速度（WHSV）下保持高活性。与其它支持的硼氧化物催化剂相比，PBSN催化剂显示出更高的烯烃选择性和稳定性。氧气的活化受到烷烃的影响，在ODH反应过程中提供了对硼基催化剂的反应途径的见解。
