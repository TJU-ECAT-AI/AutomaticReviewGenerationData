Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks reveals that these features significantly enhance catalytic performance. The porous framework allows for the uniform dispersion and stability of boron species, ensuring easy diffusion and high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitations, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, the PBSN catalysts exhibit higher olefin selectivity and stability. However, the presence of SiOH groups in silica-supported boron catalysts can lead to low propylene selectivity during the ODH reaction. The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures, particularly through electrospinning, demonstrate relative effectiveness for enhancing catalytic performance in different applications.

分析具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架中B基材料的结构特征显示，这些特性显著提高了催化性能。多孔框架允许硼物种均匀分散和稳定性，确保易于扩散和在烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中高重量小时空间速度（WHSV）下的高催化活性。一维纤维的开放孔结构可以防止扩散限制，从而保证高催化活性。与其它支持的硼氧化物催化剂相比，PBSN催化剂表现出更高的烯烃选择性和稳定性。然而，在氧化脱氢反应中，硅醇基团的存在可能导致硼基催化剂的丙烯选择性降低。用于将B活性成分整合到这些结构中的方法，特别是通过静电纺丝，显示出在不同应用中增强催化性能的相对有效性。
