The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance. The open one-dimensional fiber structure of the porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSN) catalyst allows for easy diffusion and maintains high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts demonstrate higher olefin selectivity and stability. The presence of SiOH groups in silica-supported boron catalysts can lead to low propylene selectivity during the ODH reaction. Electrospinning technology is effective in synthesizing these materials, ensuring the high dispersion and stability of boron species on the surface of the open silica nanofiber framework, thereby improving catalytic efficiency for different applications.

3-D分散活性位点在多孔框架中的B基材料的结构特征显著提高了催化性能。多孔二氧化硅纳米纤维（PBSN）催化剂的开放一维纤维结构允许容易扩散，并在烷烃的氧化脱氢反应中保持高重量小时空间速度（WHSV）下的高催化活性。与其它支持的硼氧化物催化剂相比，PBSN催化剂展现出更高的烯烃选择性和稳定性。在氧化脱氢反应中，硅醇基团的存在可能导致硼基催化剂的丙烯选择性降低。通过静电纺丝技术合成这些材料，可以确保硼物种在开放二氧化硅纳米纤维框架表面的高分散性和稳定性，从而提高不同应用中的催化效率。
