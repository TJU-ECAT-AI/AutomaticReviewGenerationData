Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances catalytic performance by ensuring uniform dispersion and stability of the boron species on the open fiber framework. The open one-dimensional fiber structure facilitates easy diffusion, allowing for high catalytic activity even at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. The porous framework prevents diffusion limitations and maintains high selectivity and stability compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through electrospinning, offering a new approach for the synthesis of highly efficient boron-based catalysts. The methods used to incorporate B active components into porous frameworks are effective for different catalytic applications, particularly in the ODH of alkanes, where the presence of SiOH groups can negatively impact propylene selectivity. Transient analysis and kinetic experiments reveal that the activation of O2 is influenced by alkanes during the ODH reaction, providing insights into the reaction pathway over boron-based catalysts.

分析具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构的B基材料的结构特征，通过确保硼物种在开放纤维骨架上的均匀分布和稳定性来增强催化性能。开放的一维纤维结构促进了扩散，即使在高重量小时空速（WHSV）下也能保持高催化活性，在烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中。开放的多孔结构防止了扩散限制，并维持与支持的硼氧化物催化剂相比更高的选择性和稳定性。通过静电纺丝将B活性成分引入这些结构中，提供了一种合成高效硼基催化剂的新方法。用于将B活性成分引入多孔结构的方法适用于不同的催化应用，尤其是在烷烃的ODH过程中，其中SiOH基团的存在可能对丙烯选择性产生负面影响。瞬态分析和动力学实验表明，氧的激活受到烷烃的影响，提供了关于硼基催化剂反应途径的见解。
