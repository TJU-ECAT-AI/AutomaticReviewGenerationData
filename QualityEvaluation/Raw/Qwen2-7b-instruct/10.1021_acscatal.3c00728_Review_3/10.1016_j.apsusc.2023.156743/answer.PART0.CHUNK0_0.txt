[1] "Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space."
[2] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."
[3] "We believe the as-generated h-BN can enhance the gas trapping capacity of liquid B2O3 environment foam to precisely control pressure differential between large and small bubbles and thus favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structure."
[4] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."
[5] "This work provides an extended assembly interface strategy of oriented bowl-like structure materials for different applications."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involve bowl-like structures with large surface areas, porous structures, and buffer hollow spaces. These features enhance catalytic performance by providing extensive contact surfaces and efficient gas trapping. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through a self-assembly strategy at the gas/liquid interface, resulting in oriented bowl-like structures that are beneficial for various catalytic applications, such as oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and organic pollutant removal. The use of an extended assembly interface strategy facilitates the formation of materials with oriented bowl-like structures that exhibit multimodal hierarchically porous structures, further enhancing their performance in different applications.

B-based材料具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构，其特征是碗状结构、大的表面积、多孔结构和缓冲空腔。这些特性通过提供广泛的接触表面和高效的气体捕获，增强了催化性能。通过在气/液界面的自组装策略将B活性成分引入这些结构中，形成了面向特定方向的碗状结构，这有利于各种催化应用，如丙烷氧化脱氢和有机污染物去除。使用扩展装配接口策略促进了形成具有面向特定方向的碗状结构的材料，这些材料表现出多模层次多孔结构，进一步提高了它们在不同应用中的性能。
