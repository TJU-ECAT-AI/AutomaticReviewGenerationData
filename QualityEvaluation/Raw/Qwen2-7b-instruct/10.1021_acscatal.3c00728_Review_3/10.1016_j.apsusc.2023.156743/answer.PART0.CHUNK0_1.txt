[1] "Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space."
[2] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."
[3] "The as-generated h-BN can enhance the gas trapping capacity of liquid B2O3 environment foam to precisely control pressure differential between large and small bubbles and thus favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structure."
[4] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

1. The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space, which contribute to their catalytic performance. These materials are synthesized through a self-assembly strategy at the gas/liquid interface, leading to the formation of oriented bowl-like structures. The orientation of these structures is controlled by adjusting the opening direction during the synthesis process. The bowl-like structures are built from numerous oriented bowl-like blocks, creating a double layer structure with face-to-face openings. This design allows for precise control over the pressure differential between large and small bubbles, enhancing the material's ability to trap gases and orient the bowl-like openings.

2. The incorporation of B active components into these porous frameworks is achieved through a self-supporting monolithic foam synthesis method. This approach enables the creation of materials with oriented bowl-like structures that exhibit multimodal hierarchically porous structures. At higher temperatures, the materials show exceptional performance in catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants. The enhanced gas trapping capacity and precise control over the opening direction of the bowl-like structures facilitate the catalytic reactions, making these materials highly effective for various applications.
