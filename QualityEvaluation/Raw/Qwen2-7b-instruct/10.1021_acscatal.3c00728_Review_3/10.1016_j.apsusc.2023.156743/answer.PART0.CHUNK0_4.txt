1. The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involve bowl-like structures characterized by large surface areas, porous structures, and buffer hollow spaces. These features contribute to enhanced catalytic performance due to increased surface availability for reactions and efficient diffusion pathways.

2. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through a self-assembly strategy that creates a BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structures. This method allows for the precise control of the opening direction of the bowl-like structures, which is beneficial for the production of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN).

3. The effectiveness of these methods for different catalytic applications lies in their ability to tailor the pore structure and orientation of the bowl-like features. The higher temperature preparation process leads to a pure h-BN monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure that exhibits a multimodal hierarchically porous structure. This structure enables superior catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

4. The extended assembly interface strategy presented in this work is designed to facilitate the creation of oriented bowl-like structure materials suitable for various applications, including catalysis, environmental remediation, and energy storage. By leveraging the properties of BN-based materials, this approach aims to optimize their functionality for specific tasks, such as enhancing the efficiency of chemical reactions and improving the treatment of pollutants.

1.B类材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构特征涉及具有大表面积、多孔结构和缓冲空腔的碗状结构。这些特征通过增加反应表面可用性和有效扩散路径，有助于提高催化性能。

2.将B活性成分引入这些结构是通过在液态B2O3环境中泡沫的气/液界面自我组装策略实现的，形成具有定向碗状结构的BN@BPO4自支撑多孔泡沫。这种方法允许精确控制碗状结构的开口方向，有利于六方硼氮化物（h-BN）的生产。

3.这些方法在不同催化应用中的有效性在于它们能够调整孔结构和方向的定向特性。通过高温制备过程得到的纯h-BN多孔泡沫具有定向碗状结构，表现出多模态层次多孔结构，以及在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯和有机污染物去除方面的出色催化性能。

4.本文提出的一种扩展组装界面策略旨在促进定向碗状结构材料的创建，适用于各种应用，包括催化、环境修复和能源存储。通过利用BN基材料的性质，这一方法旨在优化其功能以满足特定任务的需求，如提高化学反应效率并改善污染物处理。
