[1] "Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space."
[2] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."
[3] "The opening size can be adjusted by changing the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives that is beneficial for the production of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)."
[4] "We believe the as-generated h-BN can enhance the gas trapping capacity of liquid B2O3 environment foam to precisely control pressure differential between large and small bubbles and thus favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structure."
[5] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

Analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, these features enhance catalytic performance through increased surface area, enhanced gas trapping capacity, and controlled bubble dynamics. The incorporation of B active components into these structures is achieved through a self-assembly strategy, utilizing Cu(NO3)2 additives to adjust the opening size, which benefits the production of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The h-BN enhances the material's ability to precisely control pressure differentials, leading to the oriented opening of bowl-like structures. The multimodal hierarchically porous structure of the h-BN monolithic foam further improves its performance in catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

分析硼基材料中三维分散活性位点在多孔框架中的结构特征，这些特性通过增加表面积、增强气体捕获能力和控制气泡动力学来提高催化性能。通过自组装策略将B活性成分引入这些结构中，利用Cu(NO3)2添加剂调整开口尺寸，有利于六方氮化硼（h-BN）的生产。h-BN增强了材料精确控制压力差的能力，从而促进碗状结构的定向开口。h-BN多孔泡沫的多模层次结构进一步提高了其催化丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯和有机污染物去除的性能。
