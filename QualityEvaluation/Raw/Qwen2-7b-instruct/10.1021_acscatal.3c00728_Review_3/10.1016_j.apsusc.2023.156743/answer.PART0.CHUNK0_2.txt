[1] "Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space."
[2] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."
[3] "The as-generated h-BN can enhance the gas trapping capacity of liquid B2O3 environment foam to precisely control pressure differential between large and small bubbles and thus favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structure."
[4] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

1. The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks involve bowl-like structures that offer large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space, which are advantageous for catalytic performance in fields such as catalysis, environmental remediation, and energy storage.
2. The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a self-assembly strategy at the gas/liquid interface of liquid B2O3 environment foam, resulting in BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structures. These structures are composed of numerous oriented bowl-like blocks forming a double layer with face-to-face openings.
3. The orientation and size of the bowl-like openings can be controlled by adjusting the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives, which enhances the gas trapping capacity of the liquid B2O3 environment foam. This precise control of pressure differential between large and small bubbles facilitates the oriented opening of the bowl-like structures, contributing to enhanced catalytic performance.
4. At higher temperatures, the pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structures exhibits a multimodal hierarchically porous structure. This structure enables excellent performance in catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

1. B基材料中3D分散活性位点的多孔框架结构具有碗状结构，这些结构提供大的表面积、多孔结构和缓冲空腔空间，对于催化性能在催化、环境修复和能源存储等领域具有巨大潜力。
2. 将B活性成分引入这些结构的方法是通过在液态B2O3环境泡沫的气/液界面进行自组装策略，从而获得具有定向碗状结构的BN@BPO4自支撑多孔泡沫。这些结构由众多定向碗状块组成，形成双层结构并具有面对面开口。
3. 通过调整Cu(NO3)2添加剂的量来控制开口的方向和大小，增强了液态B2O3环境泡沫的气体捕获能力。这种精确控制大和小气泡之间的压力差有助于定向打开碗状结构，从而促进催化性能的提升。
4. 在更高温度下，纯h-BN多孔泡沫与定向碗状结构相结合，表现出多模态分级多孔结构。这种结构使得丙烷氧化脱氢成丙烯以及有机污染物去除具有出色性能。
