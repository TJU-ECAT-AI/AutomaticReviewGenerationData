The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance. This is primarily due to the increased surface area and improved mass transfer properties facilitated by the 3D dispersion. These materials are effectively incorporated into porous structures using techniques such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and impregnation. Among these methods, CVD is often more effective for achieving uniform dispersion of boron active components, thereby optimizing the catalyst's performance.

B基材料在多维分散活性位点的孔性框架中的结构特征显著提高了催化性能。这主要是由于3D分散促进了增加的比表面积和改进的质量传递特性。这些材料可以通过化学气相沉积（CVD）和浸渍等方法有效地融入到孔性结构中。在这两种方法中，CVD通常更有效于实现硼活性成分的均匀分散，从而优化催化剂的性能。
