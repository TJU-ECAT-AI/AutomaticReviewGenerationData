<quotes>
[1] "Supported Boron Oxide Catalysts for Selective and Low-Temperature Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane."
[2] "The use of 3D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhances the catalytic performance due to increased surface area and improved mass transfer properties."
[3] "B-based materials have been successfully incorporated into various porous structures through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and impregnation methods."
[4] "CVD is generally considered more effective for achieving uniform dispersion of boron active components compared to impregnation."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks significantly enhance catalytic performance. This is primarily due to the increased surface area and improved mass transfer properties facilitated by the 3D dispersion. These materials are effectively incorporated into porous structures using techniques such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and impregnation. Among these methods, CVD is often more effective for achieving uniform dispersion of boron active components, thereby optimizing the catalyst's performance.
