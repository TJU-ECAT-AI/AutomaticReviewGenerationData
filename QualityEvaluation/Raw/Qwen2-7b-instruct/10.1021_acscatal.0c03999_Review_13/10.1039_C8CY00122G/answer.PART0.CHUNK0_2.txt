[1] "Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation were investigated over EuOCl and EuOBr, revealing significant differences in activity and especially in the product distribution as a function of the halide type."
[2] "Regardless of the alkane substrate,oxychlorination preferably leads to olefins generation,whereas oxybromination favours the formation of bromocarbons."
[3] "One of the main reasons for this difference relies on the fact that the chlorination of the alkane and subsequent dehydrochlorination occur exclusively on the catalyst surface over EuOCl, whereas the alkane bromination is mainly driven by the reaction in the gas-phase with the generated molecular Br2 followed by a mayor contribution from polyhalogenation, cracking, and combustion pathways in the gas-phase and limited formation of the olefin via catalytic dehydrobromination."
[4] "In particular, the higher decomposition temperatures of alkyl chlorides compared to their brominated analogues might explain the difference in coke formation between the oxychlorination and oxybromination reactions, as reported in Figs. 2 and 3."

The use of EuOCl and EuOBr catalysts in ethane and propane oxyhalogenation shows distinct behaviors based on the halide type. Oxychlorination predominantly results in olefin production, with high selectivity across the entire operational range. Conversely, oxybromination favors the creation of bromocarbons, especially at lower temperatures. The primary reason for these differences lies in the reaction pathways. Chlorination of the alkane and its subsequent dehydrochlorination happen exclusively on the catalyst surface for EuOCl, while alkane bromination occurs mainly in the gas phase with the formation of molecular Br2, leading to polyhalogenation, cracking, and combustion processes. The higher decomposition temperatures of alkyl chlorides compared to alkyl bromides can explain the variation in coke formation between oxychlorination and oxybromination, as evidenced in Figures 2 and 3.

在使用EuOCl和EuOBr催化剂进行乙烷和丙烷氧卤化反应时，基于卤素类型的不同表现出了明显的差异。氯代反应主要导致烯烃生成，且在整个操作范围内具有高选择性。相反，溴代反应倾向于形成溴碳化合物，尤其是在较低温度下。这些差异的主要原因在于反应途径的不同。对于EuOCl，烷基氯化物及其随后的脱氯化反应仅在催化剂表面发生；而对于烷基溴化，则主要在气相中通过生成分子Br2的过程进行，随后在气相中产生多卤化物、裂解和燃烧路径，并有限的通过催化脱溴化形成烯烃。烷基氯化物比烷基溴化物更高的分解温度可以解释在氧氯化和氧溴化反应中焦炭形成的差异，如图2和3所示。
