[1] "Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation were investigated over EuOCl and EuOBr, revealing significant differences in activity and especially in the product distribution as a function of the halide type."
[2] "In the case of HBr oxidation over EuOBr, Br2 generation occurred at much lower temperatures than alkane oxybromination (Figs. 7b, 7d),which explains the presence of Br2 in the low-temperature region of EOB and POB (Figs. 2, 3)."
[3] "The tendency of bromocarbons towards decomposition was also observed over the catalysts, as evidenced by the error in the carbon balance showed by the difference between the conversion of the alkyl bromide and the attained olefin yield, particularly in the case of ethyl bromide (Figs. 8e, 8f)."
[4] "Regardless of the alkane substrate,oxychlorination preferably leads to olefins generation,whereas oxybromination favours the formation of bromocarbons. One of the main reasons for this difference relies on the fact that the chlorination of the alkane and subsequent dehydrochlorination occur exclusively on the catalyst surface over EuOCl, whereas the alkane bromination is mainly driven by the reaction in the gas-phase with the generated molecular Br2 followed by a mayor contribution from polyhalogenation, cracking, and combustion pathways in the gas-phase and limited formation of the olefin via catalytic dehydrobromination."

1. Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation over EuOCl and EuOBr showed differences in activity and product distribution based on the halide type used. 

2. Bromine (Br2) was generated at lower temperatures in the case of HBr oxidation over EuOBr compared to alkane oxybromination, explaining the presence of Br2 in the low-temperature region of ethylene oxybromination (EOB) and propane oxybromination (POB).

3. In the case of ethyl bromide, the carbon balance showed an error due to the alkyl bromide decomposition, particularly evident at high temperatures.

4. The mechanism for alkane oxyhalogenation involves alkane halogenation followed by alkyl halide dehydrohalogenation. Oxychlorination primarily occurs on the catalyst surface, leading to olefin formation, while oxybromination involves gas-phase alkane bromination with Br2, followed by polyhalogenation, cracking, and combustion pathways, resulting in bromocarbon formation. The differences in the stability of alkyl chlorides and bromides explain the selective formation of olefins versus bromocarbons.

1. 使用EuOCl和EuOBr进行乙烷和丙烷的氧卤化反应时，根据所用卤化物类型显示出了活性和产物分布的差异。

2. 在HBr氧化EuOBr的情况下，溴（Br2）的生成温度低于烷基氧溴化，这解释了低温度区间内乙烯氧溴化（EOB）和丙烷氧溴化（POB）中Br2的存在。

3. 对于乙基溴，在碳平衡中出现了误差，由于烷基溴的分解，特别是在高温下特别明显。

4. 烷基氧卤化反应的机制包括烷基卤化和烷基卤化物的脱卤化。氧氯化主要在催化剂表面发生，导致烯烃形成；而氧溴化涉及烷烃与生成的分子Br2的气相反应，随后是气相中的多卤化、裂解和燃烧途径，导致卤代碳化合物形成。烷基氯和溴的稳定性差异解释了选择性形成烯烃而非卤代碳化合物的原因。

The use of EuOCl and EuOBr catalysts in ethane and propane oxyhalogenation shows distinct behaviors based on the halide type. Oxychlorination predominantly results in olefin production, with high selectivity across the entire operational range. Conversely, oxybromination favors the creation of bromocarbons, especially at lower temperatures. The primary reason for these differences lies in the reaction pathways. Chlorination of the alkane and its subsequent dehydrochlorination happen exclusively on the catalyst surface for EuOCl, while alkane bromination occurs mainly in the gas phase with the formation of molecular Br2, leading to polyhalogenation, cracking, and combustion processes. The higher decomposition temperatures of alkyl chlorides compared to alkyl bromides can explain the variation in coke formation between oxychlorination and oxybromination, as evidenced in Figures 2 and 3.

在使用EuOCl和EuOBr催化剂进行乙烷和丙烷氧卤化反应时，基于卤素类型的不同表现出了明显的差异。氯代反应主要导致烯烃生成，且在整个操作范围内具有高选择性。相反，溴代反应倾向于形成溴碳化合物，尤其是在较低温度下。这些差异的主要原因在于反应途径的不同。对于EuOCl，烷基氯化物及其随后的脱氯化反应仅在催化剂表面发生；而对于烷基溴化，则主要在气相中通过生成分子Br2的过程进行，随后在气相中产生多卤化物、裂解和燃烧路径，并有限的通过催化脱溴化形成烯烃。烷基氯化物比烷基溴化物更高的分解温度可以解释在氧氯化和氧溴化反应中焦炭形成的差异，如图2和3所示。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The use of EuOCl and EuOBr as catalysts for ethane and propane oxyhalogenation shows significant differences in activity and product distribution based on the halide type. In oxychlorination, the alkane activation is surface-driven, leading to olefin formation (95% selectivity). In contrast, oxybromination favors bromocarbon formation, especially at lower temperatures. The catalyst surface plays a crucial role in alkane activation in oxychlorination, while gas-phase bromination occurs in oxybromination. Alkyl chlorides tend to undergo dehydrochlorination, while alkyl bromides prefer further bromination in the gas phase. The lower temperature at which Br2 is generated in HBr oxidation over EuOBr explains the Br2 presence in oxybromination. Bromocarbon decomposition was observed over the catalysts, affecting the carbon balance and olefin yield, particularly in ethyl bromide. Regardless of the alkane substrate, oxychlorination leads to olefin generation, whereas oxybromination favors bromocarbon formation.

对于乙烷和丙烷的氧卤化反应，使用EuOCl和EuOBr作为催化剂显示出基于卤化物类型的重大差异。在氧氯化中，烷基激活在催化剂表面进行，导致烯烃生成（选择性95%）。相反，在氧溴化中，有利于溴碳形成，尤其是在较低温度下。催化剂表面在氧氯化中对烷基激活起关键作用，而在氧溴化中则在气相中进行。在氧氯化中，卤代乙基倾向于脱氯化，而卤代乙基溴更倾向于进一步溴化在气相中。在HBr氧化中生成Br2的较低温度解释了氧溴化中的Br2存在。观察到溴碳分解，影响碳平衡和烯烃产率，特别是乙基溴的情况。无论烷基的类型如何，氧氯化都导致烯烃生成，而氧溴化则有利于溴碳形成。

The study investigates the differences in activity and product distribution between ethane and propane oxyhalogenation over EuOCl and EuOBr catalysts, highlighting significant differences depending on the halide type. The selectivity differences are mainly due to the halide-dependent alkane activation pathway, which is surface-driven in oxychlorination, while it occurs predominantly in the gas phase in oxybromination. Alkyl chlorides tend to undergo catalytic dehydrochlorination pathways, while alkyl bromides favor further bromination routes in the gas phase. Detailed characterization of the catalysts shows differences in structural stability related to both the halide type and the alkane substrate.

研究了EuOCl和EuOBr催化剂上乙烷和丙烷氧卤化反应的活性和产物分布差异，强调了不同卤素类型下的显著差异。选择性差异主要源于依赖卤素的烷烃活化途径，在氧氯化中表面驱动，在氧溴化中则主要在气体相中发生。叔丁基氯倾向于经历催化脱氯化途径，而叔丁基溴更倾向于在气体相中进一步溴化。详细表征催化剂显示了与卤素类型和烷烃基团相关的结构稳定性差异。
