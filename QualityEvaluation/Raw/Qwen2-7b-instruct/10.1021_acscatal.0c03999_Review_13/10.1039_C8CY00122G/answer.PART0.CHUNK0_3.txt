[1] "Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation were investigated over EuOCl and EuOBr, revealing significant differences in activity and especially in the product distribution as a function of the halide type."
[2] "The observed selectivity differences primarily originate from (i) the halide-dependent alkane activation path, which is surface-driven in oxychlorination, while it mostly occurs via gas-phase halogenation in oxybromination, along with (ii) the preferred tendency of alkyl chlorides towards catalytic dehydrochlorination pathways opposing alkyl bromides that undergo further bromination routes in the gas phase."
[3] "In the case of HBr oxidation over EuOBr, Br2 generation occurred at much lower temperatures than alkane oxybromination, which explains the presence of Br2 in the low-temperature region of EOB and POB."
[4] "The tendency of bromocarbons towards decomposition was also observed over the catalysts, as evidenced by the error in the carbon balance showed by the difference between the conversion of the alkyl bromide and the attained olefin yield, particularly in the case of ethyl bromide."
[5] "Regardless of the alkane substrate, oxychlorination preferably leads to olefins generation, whereas oxybromination favours the formation of bromocarbons."

The use of EuOCl and EuOBr as catalysts for ethane and propane oxyhalogenation shows significant differences in activity and product distribution based on the halide type. In oxychlorination, the alkane activation is surface-driven, leading to olefin formation (95% selectivity). In contrast, oxybromination favors bromocarbon formation, especially at lower temperatures. The catalyst surface plays a crucial role in alkane activation in oxychlorination, while gas-phase bromination occurs in oxybromination. Alkyl chlorides tend to undergo dehydrochlorination, while alkyl bromides prefer further bromination in the gas phase. The lower temperature at which Br2 is generated in HBr oxidation over EuOBr explains the Br2 presence in oxybromination. Bromocarbon decomposition was observed over the catalysts, affecting the carbon balance and olefin yield, particularly in ethyl bromide. Regardless of the alkane substrate, oxychlorination leads to olefin generation, whereas oxybromination favors bromocarbon formation.

对于乙烷和丙烷的氧卤化反应，使用EuOCl和EuOBr作为催化剂显示出基于卤化物类型的重大差异。在氧氯化中，烷基激活在催化剂表面进行，导致烯烃生成（选择性95%）。相反，在氧溴化中，有利于溴碳形成，尤其是在较低温度下。催化剂表面在氧氯化中对烷基激活起关键作用，而在氧溴化中则在气相中进行。在氧氯化中，卤代乙基倾向于脱氯化，而卤代乙基溴更倾向于进一步溴化在气相中。在HBr氧化中生成Br2的较低温度解释了氧溴化中的Br2存在。观察到溴碳分解，影响碳平衡和烯烃产率，特别是乙基溴的情况。无论烷基的类型如何，氧氯化都导致烯烃生成，而氧溴化则有利于溴碳形成。
