[1] "Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation were investigated over EuOCl and EuOBr, revealing significant differences in activity and especially in the product distribution as a function of the halide type."
[2] "In the case of HBr oxidation over EuOBr, Br2 generation occurred at much lower temperatures than alkane oxybromination (Figs. 7b, 7d),which explains the presence of Br2 in the low-temperature region of EOB and POB (Figs. 2, 3)."
[3] "The tendency of bromocarbons towards decomposition was also observed over the catalysts, as evidenced by the error in the carbon balance showed by the difference between the conversion of the alkyl bromide and the attained olefin yield, particularly in the case of ethyl bromide (Figs. 8e, 8f)."
[4] "Regardless of the alkane substrate,oxychlorination preferably leads to olefins generation,whereas oxybromination favours the formation of bromocarbons. One of the main reasons for this difference relies on the fact that the chlorination of the alkane and subsequent dehydrochlorination occur exclusively on the catalyst surface over EuOCl, whereas the alkane bromination is mainly driven by the reaction in the gas-phase with the generated molecular Br2 followed by a mayor contribution from polyhalogenation, cracking, and combustion pathways in the gas-phase and limited formation of the olefin via catalytic dehydrobromination."

1. Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation over EuOCl and EuOBr showed differences in activity and product distribution based on the halide type used. 

2. Bromine (Br2) was generated at lower temperatures in the case of HBr oxidation over EuOBr compared to alkane oxybromination, explaining the presence of Br2 in the low-temperature region of ethylene oxybromination (EOB) and propane oxybromination (POB).

3. In the case of ethyl bromide, the carbon balance showed an error due to the alkyl bromide decomposition, particularly evident at high temperatures.

4. The mechanism for alkane oxyhalogenation involves alkane halogenation followed by alkyl halide dehydrohalogenation. Oxychlorination primarily occurs on the catalyst surface, leading to olefin formation, while oxybromination involves gas-phase alkane bromination with Br2, followed by polyhalogenation, cracking, and combustion pathways, resulting in bromocarbon formation. The differences in the stability of alkyl chlorides and bromides explain the selective formation of olefins versus bromocarbons.

1. 使用EuOCl和EuOBr进行乙烷和丙烷的氧卤化反应时，根据所用卤化物类型显示出了活性和产物分布的差异。

2. 在HBr氧化EuOBr的情况下，溴（Br2）的生成温度低于烷基氧溴化，这解释了低温度区间内乙烯氧溴化（EOB）和丙烷氧溴化（POB）中Br2的存在。

3. 对于乙基溴，在碳平衡中出现了误差，由于烷基溴的分解，特别是在高温下特别明显。

4. 烷基氧卤化反应的机制包括烷基卤化和烷基卤化物的脱卤化。氧氯化主要在催化剂表面发生，导致烯烃形成；而氧溴化涉及烷烃与生成的分子Br2的气相反应，随后是气相中的多卤化、裂解和燃烧途径，导致卤代碳化合物形成。烷基氯和溴的稳定性差异解释了选择性形成烯烃而非卤代碳化合物的原因。
