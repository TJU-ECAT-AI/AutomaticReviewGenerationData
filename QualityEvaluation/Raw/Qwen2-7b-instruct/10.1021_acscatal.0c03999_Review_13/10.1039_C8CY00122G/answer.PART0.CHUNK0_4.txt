[1] "Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation were investigated over EuOCl and EuOBr, revealing significant differences in activity and especially in the product distribution as a function of the halide type."
[2] "The observed selectivity differences primarily originate from (i) the halide-dependent alkane activation path, which is surface-driven in oxychlorination, while it mostly occurs via gas-phase halogenation in oxybromination, along with (ii) the preferred tendency of alkyl chlorides towards catalytic dehydrochlorination pathways opposing alkyl bromides that undergo further bromination routes in the gas phase."
[3] "Detailed characterisation of the fresh and used catalysts supported the above results and revealed differences in structural stability that are dependent on both the halide type and the alkane substrate."

The study investigates the differences in activity and product distribution between ethane and propane oxyhalogenation over EuOCl and EuOBr catalysts, highlighting significant differences depending on the halide type. The selectivity differences are mainly due to the halide-dependent alkane activation pathway, which is surface-driven in oxychlorination, while it occurs predominantly in the gas phase in oxybromination. Alkyl chlorides tend to undergo catalytic dehydrochlorination pathways, while alkyl bromides favor further bromination routes in the gas phase. Detailed characterization of the catalysts shows differences in structural stability related to both the halide type and the alkane substrate.

研究了EuOCl和EuOBr催化剂上乙烷和丙烷氧卤化反应的活性和产物分布差异，强调了不同卤素类型下的显著差异。选择性差异主要源于依赖卤素的烷烃活化途径，在氧氯化中表面驱动，在氧溴化中则主要在气体相中发生。叔丁基氯倾向于经历催化脱氯化途径，而叔丁基溴更倾向于在气体相中进一步溴化。详细表征催化剂显示了与卤素类型和烷烃基团相关的结构稳定性差异。
