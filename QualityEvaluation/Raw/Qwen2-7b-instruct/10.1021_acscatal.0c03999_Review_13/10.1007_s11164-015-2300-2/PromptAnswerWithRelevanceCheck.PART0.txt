<quotes>
[1] "It was reported that exothermic temperature was minimized by controlling oxygen contents and heater programs."
[2] "It was also presented that oxychlorination induced the formation of oxychloridic platinum compounds and motivated the effective redispersion of platinum during the regeneration of naphtha reforming catalyst."
[3] "Redispersion can reduce the size of metal crystallites and also result in the overall increase of metal surface area."
[4] "The regeneration process includes coke burning to remove the deposits blamed for catalytic deactivation and hydrogen reduction to redisperse sintered Pt (or PtSn) particles in part."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In the context of the document, oxychlorination treatment was found to effectively redisperses Pt (or PtSn) particles, reducing their size and increasing their surface area, which contributes to the catalyst's activity recovery after the regeneration process. This is due to the formation of oxychloridic platinum compounds during oxychlorination, which facilitates the redispersion of platinum. Controlling oxygen contents and heater programs helps minimize exothermic temperature during the coke burning step, ensuring safer and more efficient regeneration of the catalyst.

The study focuses on evaluating the propane dehydrogenation and regeneration of PtSn/h-Al2O3 catalysts using oxychlorination treatment. The authors report that the catalytic activity was not fully recovered after the coke burning followed by hydrogen reduction process due to unsatisfactory Pt sintering recovery. To address this issue, oxychlorination treatment was applied between coke burning and hydrogen reduction. The oxychlorination uses diluted HCl at a range of 625-7000 ppm. The best recovery of catalytic activity was achieved at an HCl concentration of 5000 ppm. The study also examines the effective redispersion of Pt through CO chemisorption, XRD, XPS, CHSN analysis, and STEM techniques.

本研究主要关注通过氧氯化处理对丙烷脱氢和PtSn/h-Al2O3催化剂再生的评估。作者报告，在焦炭燃烧后进行氢还原过程中，催化活性并未完全恢复，原因是铂颗粒烧结恢复不理想。为解决这一问题，研究人员在焦炭燃烧与氢还原之间应用了氧氯化处理。氧氯化使用的是浓度范围为625-7000 ppm的稀盐酸。在盐酸浓度为5000 ppm时，可以获得最佳的催化活性恢复效果。研究还通过CO化学吸附、X射线衍射、X射线光电子能谱、CHSN分析和扫描透射电子显微镜技术，考察了铂的有效重新分散情况。
