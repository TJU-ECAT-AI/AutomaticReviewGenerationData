[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) can produce propylene."
[2] "PDH is an endothermic reaction requiring higher temperature, noble metal or heavy metal catalysts are used to achieve economically attractive conversion."
[3] "It was reported that exothermic temperature was minimized by controlling oxygen contents and heater programs."
[4] "It was also presented that oxychlorination induced the formation of oxychloridic platinum compounds and motivated the effective redispersion of platinum during the regeneration of naphtha reforming catalyst."
[5] "Among the various regeneration processes, it is noticeable that attractive restoration of catalytic activity and selectivity was achieved by either coke burning/ oxychlorination or chloride addition/metals reduction."
