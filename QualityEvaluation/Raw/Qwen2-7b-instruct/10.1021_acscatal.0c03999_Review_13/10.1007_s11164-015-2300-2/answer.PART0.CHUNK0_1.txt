1. The propane dehydrogenation reaction converts propane (C3H8) to propylene (C3H6) along with the release of hydrogen (H2), with a standard enthalpy change of 129 kJ/mol at 298 K.
2. Controlling oxygen contents and heater programs can minimize the exothermic temperature during the regeneration process.
3. The study suggested using oxychlorination to enhance the mobility of platinum (Pt) on the PDH catalyst by adding diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl) in purified air at 500°C. Following the oxychlorination reaction, a hydrogen reduction process was conducted.
4. The optimal HCl concentration for achieving the best recovery of catalytic activity was found to be 5000 ppm.
5. The effectiveness of Pt redispersion was evaluated using techniques such as CO chemisorption, XRD, XPS, CHSN analysis, and STEM.

1. 烯烃脱氢反应将丙烷（C3H8）转化为丙烯（C3H6），同时释放出氢气（H2），标准焓变在298K时为129kJ/mol。
2. 控制氧气含量和加热程序可以降低再生过程中的放热温度。
3. 研究建议通过向净化空气中添加稀释的盐酸（HCl）来提高PDH催化剂上铂（Pt）的流动性。在完成氧化氯化反应后，进行了氢还原过程。
4. 实现最佳催化活性恢复的最佳HCl浓度被发现为5000ppm。
5. Pt的再分散效果通过CO化学吸附、XRD、XPS、CHSN分析和STEM等技术进行了评估。
