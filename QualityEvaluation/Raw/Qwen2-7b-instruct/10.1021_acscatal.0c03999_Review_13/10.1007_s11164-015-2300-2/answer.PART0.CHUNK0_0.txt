[1] "It was reported that exothermic temperature was minimized by controlling oxygen contents and heater programs."
[2] "It was also presented that oxychlorination induced the formation of oxychloridic platinum compounds and motivated the effective redispersion of platinum during the regeneration of naphtha reforming catalyst."
[3] "Redispersion can reduce the size of metal crystallites and also result in the overall increase of metal surface area."
[4] "The regeneration process includes coke burning to remove the deposits blamed for catalytic deactivation and hydrogen reduction to redisperse sintered Pt (or PtSn) particles in part."

In the context of the document, oxychlorination treatment was found to effectively redisperses Pt (or PtSn) particles, reducing their size and increasing their surface area, which contributes to the catalyst's activity recovery after the regeneration process. This is due to the formation of oxychloridic platinum compounds during oxychlorination, which facilitates the redispersion of platinum. Controlling oxygen contents and heater programs helps minimize exothermic temperature during the coke burning step, ensuring safer and more efficient regeneration of the catalyst.

在文档的背景下，氧氯化处理被发现可以有效地重新分散Pt（或PtSn）颗粒，减少它们的尺寸并增加其表面积，这有助于催化剂活性的恢复。这是由于在氧氯化过程中形成氧氯化铂化合物，这促进了铂的重新分散。通过控制氧气含量和加热程序，可以最小化焦炭燃烧步骤中的放热温度，确保更安全、更高效的催化剂再生过程。
