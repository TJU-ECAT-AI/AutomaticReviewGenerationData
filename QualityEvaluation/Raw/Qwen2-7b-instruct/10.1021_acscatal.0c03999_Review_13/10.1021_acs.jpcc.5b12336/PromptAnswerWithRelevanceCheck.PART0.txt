The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling compared to traditional oxygen-based systems has been investigated. Thermodynamically, sulfur offers a lower activation energy for the oxidation reaction, potentially leading to enhanced efficiency. In terms of reaction mechanisms, sulfur-based systems may exhibit different pathways due to its unique reactivity. Surface reactions might be favored over gas-phase reactions, depending on the catalyst used. Catalytic performance can be improved by selecting appropriate sulfur compounds and catalyst supports. Alkene selectivity can be optimized through careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst properties. Key challenges include the stability and recyclability of sulfur-based catalysts, as well as the potential for side reactions that may reduce selectivity. Opportunities for future improvements include refining the catalyst design and exploring the synergistic effects of sulfur with other metal additives.
