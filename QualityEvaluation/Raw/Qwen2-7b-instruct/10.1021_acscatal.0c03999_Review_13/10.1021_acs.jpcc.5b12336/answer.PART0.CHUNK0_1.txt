As the provided literature does not contain direct comparisons or discussions about the use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling versus traditional oxygen-based systems, nor does it delve into specifics about reaction mechanisms, catalytic performance, or alkene selectivity, it is not possible to answer the questions posed based solely on the content of this document. Therefore, no relevant quotes can be extracted, and the specific questions cannot be answered within the constraints of this document.
