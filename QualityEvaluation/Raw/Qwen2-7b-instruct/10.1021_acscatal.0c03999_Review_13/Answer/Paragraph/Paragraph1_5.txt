This comparative review delves into the nuances of sulfur's role as a catalyst in methane oxidative coupling versus conventional oxygen-based systems, drawing insights from specific references \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b12336\], \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b12336\], \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b12336\], and \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b12336\].

            Thermodynamically, sulfur offers a more favorable activation energy for certain reactions compared to oxygen-based systems, as highlighted in \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b12336\]. Reaction mechanisms for sulfur-mediated processes are versatile, encompassing both surface and gas-phase reactions, as noted in \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b12336\]. The catalytic performance of sulfur-based systems varies depending on the specific catalyst used, as detailed in \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b12336\]. Alkene selectivity in sulfur-based systems can be influenced by the choice of sulfur source and reaction conditions, as explained in \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b12336\].

            Key challenges associated with the use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant include the stability and reactivity of sulfur compounds under reaction conditions, as discussed in \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b12336\]. Opportunities for future improvements in this area involve optimizing catalyst design and reaction conditions, as outlined in \[10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b12336\].

            In terms of catalytic performance, sulfur-based systems may offer distinct advantages over traditional oxygen-based systems, particularly in terms of thermodynamics and reaction versatility. However, they also present unique challenges that need to be addressed to enhance their practicality and efficiency.
