            A comprehensive analysis of sulfur's utilization as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling has been conducted, juxtaposing its performance against traditional oxygen-based systems across thermodynamics, reaction mechanisms, catalytic efficacy, and alkene selectivity. Key insights from studies \[1\], \[2\], \[3\], and \[4\] reveal that sulfur introduces several advantageous features over oxygen, notably in terms of thermodynamics, where it often provides a more favorable activation energy for specific reactions. Additionally, sulfur-mediated processes are capable of exhibiting both surface and gas-phase reactions, offering flexibility in reaction pathways. The catalytic performance of sulfur-based systems varies depending on the specific catalyst employed, underscoring the importance of tailored catalyst selection. Moreover, alkene selectivity can be significantly influenced by the choice of sulfur source and the conditions under which the reactions are carried out.

    Challenges in adopting sulfur as an alternative oxidant include maintaining the stability and reactivity of sulfur compounds under reaction conditions, particularly ensuring their longevity and efficiency throughout multiple reaction cycles. Enhancing alkene selectivity remains a significant hurdle, as achieving optimal product purity requires a delicate balance in the reaction conditions and catalyst properties.

    Future improvements in this approach are promising, with opportunities for optimizing catalyst design and reaction conditions being paramount. The exploration of alternative sulfur sources and the development of more stable and active catalysts could significantly enhance the overall performance of sulfur-based systems. Additionally, refining the control over reaction conditions to better tune alkene selectivity holds potential for significant advancements in the field.
