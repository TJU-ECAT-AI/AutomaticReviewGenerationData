        Comparative analysis of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling reveals its distinct advantages over traditional oxygen-based systems in terms of thermodynamics, reaction mechanisms, catalytic performance, and alkene selectivity. Sulfur, when used as an oxidant, demonstrates thermodynamic benefits, offering a more favorable activation energy for certain reactions compared to oxygen. This characteristic is pivotal in enhancing the efficiency of the coupling process. Reaction mechanisms associated with sulfur-mediated oxidative coupling exhibit versatility, encompassing both surface and gas-phase reactions, which broadens the scope of potential applications and optimization strategies.

        Catalytic performance varies across different sulfur-based systems, contingent upon the specific catalyst utilized. The selection of sulfur source and reaction conditions significantly influences alkene selectivity, presenting a critical factor in achieving optimal product distribution. Key challenges in utilizing sulfur as an oxidant include maintaining catalyst stability and recyclability, particularly under the harsh conditions typical of such reactions. Enhancing alkene selectivity remains another significant hurdle, necessitating meticulous control over reaction parameters.

        Future improvements in this approach are anticipated to revolve around optimizing catalyst design and reaction conditions. There is an opportunity to explore the integration of alternative sulfur sources and the development of novel catalysts tailored to sulfur-based oxidative coupling. Additionally, refining the process to improve stability and selectivity could lead to more efficient and sustainable industrial implementations.
