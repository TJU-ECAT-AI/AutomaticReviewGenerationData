        Comparative analysis of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling reveals significant contrasts with traditional oxygen-based systems across thermodynamics, reaction mechanisms, catalytic performance, and alkene selectivity. Thermodynamically, sulfur offers a more favorable activation energy for certain reactions compared to oxygen, providing a potential advantage in the oxidative coupling process. Reaction mechanisms in sulfur-based systems are versatile, exhibiting both surface and gas-phase reactions, which can offer more flexibility than those observed with oxygen-based systems.

        Catalytic performance varies with the specific catalyst used in sulfur-based systems, highlighting the importance of careful selection and optimization. Alkene selectivity is influenced by the choice of sulfur source and reaction conditions, indicating that fine-tuning these parameters can significantly impact the desired product distribution.

        Key challenges associated with sulfur usage include ensuring the stability and reactivity of sulfur compounds under reaction conditions, which can affect the overall efficiency and longevity of the catalytic process. Enhancing the stability and recyclability of sulfur-based catalysts, as well as improving alkene selectivity, represents significant opportunities for future improvements in this area.

        Future improvements could involve optimizing reaction conditions, exploring the use of alternative sulfur sources, and refining catalyst design to address these challenges. Opportunities also exist in expanding the scope of sulfur-based systems to include broader applications and enhancing the understanding of sulfur's interaction with various substrates and promoters.
