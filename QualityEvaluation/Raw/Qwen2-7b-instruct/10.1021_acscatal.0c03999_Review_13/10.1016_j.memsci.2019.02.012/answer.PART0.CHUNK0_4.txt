[1] "Currently, this BBCN catalytic membrane reactor showed the highest C3H6 yield and best long-term stability as compared to other perovskite membrane reactors reported in litera- ture."
[2] "Propane feeding rate should be adjusted to match the oxygen permeation through the membrane thus maintaining the optimum ratio between propane to oxygen; excess oxygen permeation leads to combustion of propylene product and loss of propylene selectivity, while low oxygen permeation leads to low propane conversion."
[3] "Oxygen permeation in this catalytic membrane reactor should be carefully controlled to ensure an optimum trade-offbetween propene selectivity and propane conversion."

The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling compares differently to traditional oxygen-based systems in terms of thermodynamics, reaction mechanisms, catalytic performance, and alkene selectivity. Thermodynamically, sulfur-based systems might offer more favorable conditions for alkene formation due to its stronger oxidizing ability compared to oxygen. Mechanistically, sulfur-based reactions often involve surface reactions rather than gas-phase reactions, leading to potentially higher alkene selectivity. Catalytic performance in sulfur-based systems could be enhanced through the use of specialized catalysts designed to facilitate sulfur activation and alkene formation. Alkene selectivity might be higher in sulfur-based systems due to the more direct pathway for alkene production, reducing unwanted byproducts.

However, sulfur-based systems face significant challenges, including safety concerns related to handling sulfur, potential corrosion of equipment, and the complexity of sulfur management in the process. Opportunities for future improvements include developing safer sulfur delivery methods, designing more robust catalysts that can withstand sulfur environments, and optimizing process conditions to maximize alkene selectivity while minimizing byproduct formation.

硫作为甲烷氧化耦合的替代氧化剂，在热力学、反应机制、催化剂性能和烯烃选择性方面与传统的氧气系统相比有所不同。从热力学角度看，硫基系统可能为烯烃形成提供更有利的条件，因为其氧化能力更强。从反应机制的角度来看，硫基反应往往涉及表面反应而非气相反应，这可能导致更高的烯烃选择性。在硫基系统的催化剂性能方面，通过设计专门用于促进硫活化和烯烃生成的催化剂，可以增强性能。在硫基系统中，由于直接的烯烃生产途径，烯烃选择性可能更高，从而减少副产物的形成。

然而，硫基系统面临一些挑战，包括处理硫的安全问题、设备腐蚀的可能性以及过程条件优化以最大化烯烃选择性并同时最小化副产物形成的机会。未来改进的机会包括开发更安全的硫输送方法、设计更能承受硫环境的催化剂，并优化过程条件。
