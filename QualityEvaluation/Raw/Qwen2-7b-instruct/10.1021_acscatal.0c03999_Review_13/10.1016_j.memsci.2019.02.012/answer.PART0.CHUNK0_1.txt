[1] "Currently, this BBCN catalytic membrane reactor showed the highest C3H6 yield and best long-term stability as compared to other perovskite membrane reactors reported in litera- ture."
[2] "Propane feeding rate should be adjusted to match the oxygen permeation through the membrane thus maintaining the optimum ratio between propane to oxygen; excess oxygen permeation leads to combustion of propylene product and loss of propylene selectivity, while low oxygen permeation leads to low propane conversion."
[3] "High temperature favors oxygen permeation through perovskite membranes but also increases the probability of cracking reaction."
[4] "Therefore, if there is enough oxygen permeation through the membrane, it is preferred to operate this reaction at a lower temperature to increase the selectivity of propylene."
[5] "The catalytic BBCN membrane reactor shows a good stability over 50 h, a marked improvement over conventional packed bed reactor for NPDH reaction."
[6] "To achieve the optimum performance via this catalytic perovskite hollow fiber membrane reactor for OPDH reaction, it is important to maintain the proper propane feed to oxygen permeation ratio."

The catalytic BBCN perovskite hollow fiber membrane reactor demonstrates superior performance in oxidative propane dehydrogenation (OPDH) reactions compared to other perovskite membrane reactors documented in literature. Key factors for achieving optimal performance include adjusting the propane feed rate to match oxygen permeation through the membrane, maintaining a balanced ratio between propane and oxygen. Operating at lower temperatures when sufficient oxygen permeates the membrane helps to increase propylene selectivity. The reactor exhibits enhanced stability over prolonged operation, surpassing conventional packed bed reactors used for non-oxidative dehydrogenation (NPDH). To optimize the reaction, it is crucial to manage the propane feed rate relative to the oxygen permeation rate to prevent combustion of propylene products and minimize loss of propylene selectivity, ensuring a stable and efficient process.

催化BBCN铁氧体空心纤维膜反应器在氧化丙烷脱氢（OPDH）反应中表现出优于其他文献中报道的铁氧体膜反应器的性能。实现最佳性能的关键因素包括调整丙烷的供气速率以匹配通过膜的氧渗透，保持丙烷与氧气之间的平衡比率。当膜中有足够的氧渗透时，在较低温度下操作有助于提高丙烯选择性。该反应器表现出长期运行的良好稳定性，超过用于非氧化脱氢（NPDH）的传统填充床反应器。为了优化反应，管理丙烷供气速率相对于氧渗透率对于防止丙烯产品的燃烧并最小化丙烯选择性的损失至关重要，确保过程稳定且高效。
