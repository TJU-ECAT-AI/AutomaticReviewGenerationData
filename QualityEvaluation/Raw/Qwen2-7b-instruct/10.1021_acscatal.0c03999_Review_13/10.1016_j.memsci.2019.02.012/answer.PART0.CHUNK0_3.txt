[1] "Despite the promising benefits oxygen permeable perovskite membrane reactors can offer, few studies have investigated OPDH reaction via oxygen permeable perovskite membrane reactors [6,7,33,34]."
[2] "To achieve the optimum performance via this catalytic perovskite hollow fiber membrane reactor for OPDH reaction, it is important to maintain the proper propane feed to oxygen permeation ratio."
[3] "In addition, the catalytic membrane reactor shows a good stability over 50 h, a marked improvement over conventional packed bed reactor for NPDH reaction."
[4] "The results show that high C3H6 yield ( 50%) and selectivity ( 74%) can be achieved from the catalytic membrane reactor, which was more than twice the yield and selectivity that was obtained from the conventional co-feed mode reactor."
[5] "Therefore, the development of low temperature oxygen permeable membrane is necessary to further improve the performance of catalytic perovskite membrane reactors for OPDH reaction."

The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling does not have direct comparisons in the provided literature, as it focuses on the application of oxygen permeable perovskite membrane reactors for oxidative propane dehydrogenation (OPDH). The literature discusses the advantages and performance of these reactors, such as high C3H6 yield and selectivity, stability over time, and the importance of maintaining the right propane-to-oxygen permeation ratio. The development of low temperature oxygen permeable membranes is considered crucial for enhancing the performance of these reactors. However, there is no information regarding the use of sulfur or methane oxidative coupling in this context.

硫作为甲烷氧化耦合的替代氧化剂，在提供的文献中没有直接比较，因为文献主要关注氧透过型钙钛矿膜反应器在氧化丙烷脱氢（OPDH）中的应用。文献讨论了这些反应器的优势和性能，如高C3H6产率和选择性、长时间稳定性以及维持丙烷至氧透过比的重要性。开发低温氧透过膜被认为是提高这些反应器性能的关键。然而，关于使用硫或甲烷氧化耦合的信息并未包含在内。
