[1] "Despite the promising benefits oxygen permeable perovskite membrane reactors can offer, few studies have investigated OPDH reaction via oxygen permeable perovskite membrane reactors [6,7,33,34]."
[2] "To achieve the optimum performance via this catalytic perovskite hollow fiber membrane reactor for OPDH reaction, it is important to maintain the proper propane feed to oxygen permeation ratio."
[3] "The catalytic BBCN membrane reactor shows a good stability over 50 h, a marked improvement over conventional packed bed reactor for NPDH reaction."
[4] "The results show that high C3H6 yield ( 50%) and selectivity ( 74%) can be achieved from the catalytic membrane reactor, which was more than twice the yield and selectivity that was obtained from the conventional co-feed mode reactor."
[5] "In addition, the catalytic membrane reactor shows a good stability over 50 h, a marked improvement over conventional packed bed reactor for NPDH reaction."
