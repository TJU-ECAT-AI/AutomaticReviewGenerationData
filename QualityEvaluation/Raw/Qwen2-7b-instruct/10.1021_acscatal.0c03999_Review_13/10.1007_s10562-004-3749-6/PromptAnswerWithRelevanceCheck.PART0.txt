[3] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica supported catalyst."
[4] "More importantly, the yield and selectivity of propene markedly decreased in the presence of carbon dioxide."

The study discusses the impact of different supports on the catalytic activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. It was discovered that the type of support significantly influences the catalytic performance. Specifically, carbon dioxide enhances propene yield over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, whereas it leads to a significant decrease in propene yield and selectivity over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The study highlights that the promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield is only observed on silica-supported catalysts, and the presence of carbon dioxide markedly decreases the yield and selectivity of propene. Additionally, it is noted that the catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly influenced by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support.

研究探讨了不同载体对铬氧化物基催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中CO2的影响。发现支持物的类型显著影响催化性能。具体来说，二氧化碳增强了SiO2负载的催化剂的丙烯产率，而对Al2O3负载的催化剂则导致丙烯产率和选择性显著降低。研究表明，在SiO2载体上，二氧化碳促进丙烯产率的效果仅被观察到，而在二氧化碳存在下，丙烯产率和选择性明显降低。此外，指出支持的铬催化剂的催化性质强烈受到氧化物支持体的酸碱性的影响。

The study investigated the effect of supports on the catalytic activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The nature of the support significantly influenced the catalyst's performance. CO2 enhanced the propene yield over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, whereas it strongly decreased the yield and selectivity of propene over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. Steam negatively impacted the catalytic performance of both types of catalysts, although its effect was reversible on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The authors suggested that the acidic/basic properties of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst were altered during the dehydrogenation process, possibly explaining the catalyst's reduced activity in the presence of CO2.

本研究探讨了支持物对铬氧化物基催化剂在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢活性的影响。支持物的性质显著影响了催化剂的性能。二氧化碳仅在SiO2支持的催化剂上促进了丙烯产率，而在Al2O3支持的催化剂上，二氧化碳的存在强烈降低了丙烯产率和选择性。蒸汽对测试催化剂的催化性能产生了负面影响，但其对Al2O3支持的催化剂的影响是可逆的。作者推测，在CO2作用下，CrOx/Al2O3催化剂表面的酸性/碱性性质发生了改变，这可能解释了催化剂在CO2存在下的活性降低现象。

[1] "In the present work, we have studied the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 over chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on two very different oxide supports (SiO2 and Al2O3)."
[2] "It was found that the nature of support strongly effects on the catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation with CO2. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."
[3] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica supported catalyst."
[4] "However, Nakagawa et al. [16] suggested that in the dehydroge- nation of ethane with CO2, the decrease of the ethene yield over Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is caused by modification of acidity of the catalyst surface with water."
[5] "It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."

The study focused on the effect of supports on the catalytic activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The results showed that the type of support significantly influenced the catalytic performance. On CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, the presence of CO2 enhanced propene yield, whereas over CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, CO2 had a detrimental effect on both propene yield and selectivity. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was specifically noted for silica-supported catalysts. It was hypothesized that CO2 and/or steam formed during the reaction altered the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst.

[2] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

The study discusses the effect of supports on the catalytic activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. It was found that the nature of the support significantly affects the catalytic performance. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, CO2 enhances the propene yield. However, over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, the presence of CO2 leads to a decrease in the yield and selectivity of propene. Additionally, the study shows that the effect of chromium content on the poisoning/promoting effect of CO2 varies between the two types of supports. The ratio of propene yield in Helium to the yield in CO2 increases with an increase in chromium loading on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while the poisoning effect of CO2 decreases over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with higher chromium loading.

研究探讨了在丙烷脱氢过程中，CO2对以铬氧化物为基础的催化剂活性的影响。结果表明，支撑材料的性质显著影响催化性能。在CrOx/SiO2催化剂上，CO2增加了丙烯产率。然而，在CrOx/Al2O3催化剂上，CO2的引入导致了丙烯产率和选择性的显著下降。此外，研究发现，铬含量对CO2的毒害/促进效果在两种支撑材料中的作用不同。在CrOx/SiO2催化剂上，随着铬含量的增加，氦气中丙烯产率与CO2中的比例增加；而在CrOx/Al2O3催化剂上，随着铬含量的提高，CO2的毒害效应减小。
