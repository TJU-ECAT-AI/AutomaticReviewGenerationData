[1] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica supported catalyst."
[2] "Over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst carbon dioxide exerts an adverse effect on the yield and selectivity of propene."
[3] "It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."

The document discusses the effect of different supports on the catalytic activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The nature of the support significantly affects the catalytic performance. Specifically, CO2 enhances the propene yield over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, whereas it decreases the yield and selectivity of propene over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The authors propose that CO2 and/or steam formed during the dehydrogenation process alter the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst.

文献讨论了不同支撑物对铬氧化物基催化剂在丙烷与CO2脱氢中催化活性的影响。支撑物的性质显著影响催化性能。具体来说，CO2增强了CrOx/SiO2催化剂的丙烯产率，而它降低了CrOx/Al2O3催化剂在存在CO2时的丙烯产率和选择性。作者提出，CO2和/或脱氢过程中形成的蒸汽改变了CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的酸碱性。
