The study discusses the impact of different supports on the catalytic activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. It was discovered that the type of support significantly influences the catalytic performance. Specifically, carbon dioxide enhances propene yield over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, whereas it leads to a significant decrease in propene yield and selectivity over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The study highlights that the promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield is only observed on silica-supported catalysts, and the presence of carbon dioxide markedly decreases the yield and selectivity of propene. Additionally, it is noted that the catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly influenced by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support.

研究探讨了不同载体对铬氧化物基催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中CO2的影响。发现支持物的类型显著影响催化性能。具体来说，二氧化碳增强了SiO2负载的催化剂的丙烯产率，而对Al2O3负载的催化剂则导致丙烯产率和选择性显著降低。研究表明，在SiO2载体上，二氧化碳促进丙烯产率的效果仅被观察到，而在二氧化碳存在下，丙烯产率和选择性明显降低。此外，指出支持的铬催化剂的催化性质强烈受到氧化物支持体的酸碱性的影响。
