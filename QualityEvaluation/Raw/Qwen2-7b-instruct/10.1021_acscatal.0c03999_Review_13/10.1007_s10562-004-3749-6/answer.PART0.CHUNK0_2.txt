[1] "In all cases the yield of propene increased with temperature, but the detailed behavior varied with a type of support and the feed composition."
[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica supported catalyst."
[3] "Over the (3.4)CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."
[4] "The effect of steam on catalytic performance of the tested catalysts was also discussed."
[5] "It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."

The study investigated the effect of supports on the catalytic activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The nature of the support significantly influenced the catalyst's performance. CO2 enhanced the propene yield over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, whereas it strongly decreased the yield and selectivity of propene over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. Steam negatively impacted the catalytic performance of both types of catalysts, although its effect was reversible on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The authors suggested that the acidic/basic properties of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst were altered during the dehydrogenation process, possibly explaining the catalyst's reduced activity in the presence of CO2.

本研究探讨了支持物对铬氧化物基催化剂在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢活性的影响。支持物的性质显著影响了催化剂的性能。二氧化碳仅在SiO2支持的催化剂上促进了丙烯产率，而在Al2O3支持的催化剂上，二氧化碳的存在强烈降低了丙烯产率和选择性。蒸汽对测试催化剂的催化性能产生了负面影响，但其对Al2O3支持的催化剂的影响是可逆的。作者推测，在CO2作用下，CrOx/Al2O3催化剂表面的酸性/碱性性质发生了改变，这可能解释了催化剂在CO2存在下的活性降低现象。
