[1] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation."
[2] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

The study discusses the effect of supports on the catalytic activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. It was found that the nature of the support significantly affects the catalytic performance. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, CO2 enhances the propene yield. However, over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, the presence of CO2 leads to a decrease in the yield and selectivity of propene. Additionally, the study shows that the effect of chromium content on the poisoning/promoting effect of CO2 varies between the two types of supports. The ratio of propene yield in Helium to the yield in CO2 increases with an increase in chromium loading on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while the poisoning effect of CO2 decreases over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with higher chromium loading.

研究探讨了在丙烷脱氢过程中，CO2对以铬氧化物为基础的催化剂活性的影响。结果表明，支撑材料的性质显著影响催化性能。在CrOx/SiO2催化剂上，CO2增加了丙烯产率。然而，在CrOx/Al2O3催化剂上，CO2的引入导致了丙烯产率和选择性的显著下降。此外，研究发现，铬含量对CO2的毒害/促进效果在两种支撑材料中的作用不同。在CrOx/SiO2催化剂上，随着铬含量的增加，氦气中丙烯产率与CO2中的比例增加；而在CrOx/Al2O3催化剂上，随着铬含量的提高，CO2的毒害效应减小。
