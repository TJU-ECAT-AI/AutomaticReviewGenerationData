[1] "In the present work, we have studied the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 over chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on two very different oxide supports (SiO2 and Al2O3)."
[2] "It was found that the nature of support strongly effects on the catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation with CO2. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."
[3] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica supported catalyst."
[4] "However, Nakagawa et al. [16] suggested that in the dehydroge- nation of ethane with CO2, the decrease of the ethene yield over Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is caused by modification of acidity of the catalyst surface with water."
[5] "It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."

The study focused on the effect of supports on the catalytic activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The results showed that the type of support significantly influenced the catalytic performance. On CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, the presence of CO2 enhanced propene yield, whereas over CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, CO2 had a detrimental effect on both propene yield and selectivity. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was specifically noted for silica-supported catalysts. It was hypothesized that CO2 and/or steam formed during the reaction altered the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst.

研究集中在通过CO2进行丙烷脱氢过程中，不同载体对铬氧化物基催化剂活性的影响。结果表明，载体类型显著影响催化性能。在CrOx/SiO2催化剂上，CO2提高了丙烯产率，而在CrOx/Al2O3催化剂上，CO2显著降低了丙烯产率和选择性。仅在硅酸盐支持的催化剂上观察到CO2促进丙烯产率的效果。推测CO2和/或脱氢过程中形成的蒸汽改变了CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的酸性/碱性性质。
