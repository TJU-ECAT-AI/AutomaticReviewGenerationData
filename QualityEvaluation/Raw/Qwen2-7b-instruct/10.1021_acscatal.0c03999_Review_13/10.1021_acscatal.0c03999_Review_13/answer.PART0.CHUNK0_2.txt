6.3.1. Sulfides
"Zhu et al. have explored the possibility of sulfur as another less active oxidant for alkane conversion, specifically for methane oxidative coupling."
"The thermodynamic well for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2 is 13.41 eV, whereas for sulfur oxidation to CS2, it is considerably higher in energy at 3.45 eV."
"An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C."
"High temperatures are needed for this process due to both the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on the sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides."
"While the performance of this catalyst is found to be relatively modest and far from practical consideration, it is conceivable that future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening."

6.3.2. Halides
"There has been recent interests in using halogens, such as Cl2 and Br2, as oxidants, particularly in oxyhalogenation reactions, which can be used for alkane to alkene conversion."
"Interestingly, the authors have observed a divergence in the mechanism for ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination, with the former being dominated by surface reactions and the latter being mainly dominated by gas-phase reactions."
"In the proposed mechanism, ethane oxychlorination follows a surface-mediated CH activation (with a barrier of 0.61 eV) to form an ethyl intermediate which then reacts with a surface chloride to form ethyl chloride in a barrierless process."
"By contrast, when Br2 is used, a gas-phase reaction is found to be more favorable where bromine desorbs as radicals which dehydrogenate and polybrominate ethane in a process unselective to ethylene."

The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling compares to traditional oxygen-based systems in terms of thermodynamics, reaction mechanisms, catalytic performance, and alkene selectivity. Sulfur's thermodynamic well for oxidation is significantly higher, leading to a lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation compared to oxygen. Catalysts using sulfur, such as PdS, can achieve up to 18% ethylene selectivity at 1050°C, but the process requires high temperatures due to the high activation barriers on sulfide catalysts. Future studies might identify catalysts with higher conversion rates through theoretical screening. In contrast, halogen usage, particularly in oxyhalogenation reactions, involves divergent mechanisms depending on the halogen used. Ethane oxychlorination is primarily surface-mediated, while oxybromination favors gas-phase reactions. This highlights the importance of the competition between surface and gas-phase reactions in controlling alkene selectivity and how different oxidants shift their relative contributions.

硫作为烷烃转化的另一种较不活跃的氧化剂，在甲烷氧化耦合中与传统的氧基系统相比，其热力学、反应机制、催化性能和烯烃选择性有明显差异。硫的氧化热力学值显著高于氧气，导致过氧化的驱动力较低。使用硫的催化剂（如PdS）在1050°C时可实现高达18%的乙烯选择性，但过程需要高温，因为硫化物催化剂的氢提取能力较差。未来研究可能通过理论筛选识别出具有更高转化率的催化剂。相比之下，卤素的使用，特别是在氧卤化反应中，根据所用卤素的不同涉及不同的反应机制。乙烷的氯氧化主要由表面介导，而溴氧化则倾向于气相反应。这强调了表面和气相反应竞争在控制烯烃选择性和不同氧化剂相对贡献中的重要性。
