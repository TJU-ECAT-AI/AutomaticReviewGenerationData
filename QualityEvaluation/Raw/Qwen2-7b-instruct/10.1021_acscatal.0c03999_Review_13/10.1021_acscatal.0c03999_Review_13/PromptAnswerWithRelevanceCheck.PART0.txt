6.3.1. Sulfides
"Zhu et al. have explored the possibility of sulfur as another less active oxidant for alkane conversion, specifically for methane oxidative coupling."
"An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C."
"High temperatures are needed for this process due to both the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on the sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides."
"MS bond energy to be a good descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers."
6.3.2. Halides
"In the proposed mechanism, ethane oxychlorination follows a surface-mediated CH activation (with a barrier of 0.61 eV) to form an ethyl intermediate which then reacts with a surface chloride to form ethyl chloride in a barrierless process."
"By contrast, when Br2 is used, a gas-phase reaction is found to be more favorable where bromine desorbs as radicals which dehydrogenate and polybrominate ethane in a process unselective to ethylene."

1. The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling compares unfavorably to traditional oxygen-based systems in terms of thermodynamics, as the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation is much lower for sulfur. However, it enables an ethylene selectivity of up to 18% on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C. The performance is modest and not yet practical due to high activation barriers and the fact that sulfide catalysts are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides. Future studies may improve catalyst performance through descriptor-based theoretical screening.

2. For halogen-based systems, particularly in oxyhalogenation reactions, ethane oxychlorination is dominated by surface reactions while oxybromination is mainly driven by gas-phase reactions. The surface-mediated mechanism for oxychlorination involves ethane activation to form an ethyl intermediate, followed by a surface chloride reaction to form ethyl chloride. In contrast, bromine desorbs as radicals, dehydrogenating and polybrominating ethane in a non-selective process for ethylene production. This highlights the importance of the competition between surface and gas-phase reactions in controlling alkene selectivity and how the choice of oxidant influences their relative contributions.

1. 硫作为烷烃转化的另一种较不活跃的氧化剂，在甲烷氧化耦合中的应用与传统基于氧气的系统相比，在热力学方面存在劣势，因为硫的过氧化驱动力较低。然而，它在钯硫催化剂上实现了1050°C时高达18%的乙烯选择性。由于硫化物催化剂的氢提取能力较差，与金属氧化物相比，其性能相对温和且尚未达到实用考虑。未来的研究可以通过基于描述符的理论筛选来改进催化剂性能。

2. 对于卤素基系统，特别是氧卤化反应，乙烷氧氯化主要由表面反应主导，而氧溴化主要由气相反应主导。氧氯化表面介导的机制涉及乙烷激活形成乙基中间体，然后与表面氯化物反应形成乙基氯化物。相比之下，溴脱附为自由基，进行脱氢和多溴化乙烷的过程对乙烯生产不利。这突出了表面和气相反应竞争在控制烯烃选择性和不同氧化剂对它们贡献的相对影响的重要性。

The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling compares unfavorably to traditional oxygen-based systems in terms of thermodynamics and catalytic performance. Thermodynamically, sulfur oxidation to CS2 requires more energy (3.45 eV) compared to oxygen oxidation to CO2 (13.41 eV), leading to a lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation. At high temperatures (1050°C), a PdS catalyst achieves an ethylene selectivity of up to 18%. However, the activation barriers for sulfur catalysts are significantly higher than those for metal oxides, ranging from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2. Despite these challenges, future studies might identify catalysts with higher conversion rates through theoretical screening based on descriptors like MS bond energy, which correlate with both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers.

In comparison to halogen-based oxidants, sulfur introduces a distinct mechanism in alkene selectivity for oxyhalogenation reactions. For ethane oxychlorination, the process is dominated by surface reactions, while oxybromination is characterized by predominantly gas-phase reactions. This highlights the importance of the competition between surface and gas-phase reactions in controlling alkene selectivity, with sulfur species favoring the formation of propylene both kinetically and thermodynamically, as opposed to chlorine or bromine.

Opportunities for future improvements in sulfur-based oxidative coupling include optimizing catalyst design and identifying conditions that enhance catalytic activity and selectivity, potentially through the use of descriptor-based theoretical screening. Additionally, understanding the specific mechanisms underlying sulfur's unique reactivity patterns could lead to the development of more efficient and selective sulfur catalysts for alkane-to-alkene conversions.

硫作为甲烷氧化耦合的替代氧化剂，在热力学和催化剂性能方面与传统的氧基系统相比表现不佳。从热力学角度来看，硫氧化为CS2需要更多的能量（3.45 eV），与氧气氧化为CO2（13.41 eV）相比，这导致了过氧化反应的热力学驱动力较低。在1050°C的高温下，PdS催化剂可以达到高达18%的乙烯选择性。然而，硫催化剂的活化壁垒显著高于金属氧化物，范围从MoS2的1.91 eV到TiS2的2.68 eV。尽管存在这些挑战，未来的研究可以通过基于描述符的理论筛选来识别具有更高转化率的催化剂，例如MS键能，它与CH激活和CC耦合反应壁垒相关联。

与卤素基氧化剂相比，硫在烷烃转化为烯烃的氧卤化反应中引入了一种独特的异丁烯选择性机制。对于乙烷的氯氧加成，过程主要由表面反应主导，而溴氧加成则主要是气相反应为主导。这突显了表面和气相反应之间竞争在控制异丁烯选择性中的重要性，硫物种有利于形成丙烯，无论是从动力学还是热力学角度来看，都优于氯或溴。

未来改进硫基氧化耦合的机会包括优化催化剂设计并确定提高催化活性和选择性的条件，可能通过基于描述符的理论筛选实现。此外，理解硫独特反应模式的具体机制可引导开发更高效和选择性更强的硫催化剂，用于烷烃转化为烯烃的过程。

1. Compared to traditional oxygen-based systems, sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling exhibits lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation. This leads to less efficient conversion processes. However, the use of sulfur catalysts can achieve up to 18% ethylene selectivity under specific conditions. Future studies could potentially identify catalysts with higher conversion rates through theoretical screening. 

2. The use of halogens like Cl2 and Br2 in alkene selectivity for oxyhalogenation reactions shows distinct differences in mechanisms.

6.3.1. Sulfides
Zhu et al. have explored the possibility of sulfur as another less active oxidant for alkane conversion, specifically for methane oxidative coupling. (298)
The thermodynamic well for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2 is 13.41 eV, whereas for sulfur oxidation to CS2, it is considerably higher in energy at 3.45 eV. Therefore, the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation is much lower for the sulfur oxidant.
An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C. High temperatures are needed for this process due to both the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on the sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides.
While the performance of this catalyst is found to be relatively modest and far from practical consideration, it is conceivable that future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening.
In particular, the authors have observed the MS bond energy to be a good descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers.

6.3.2. Halides
There has been recent interests in using halogens, such as Cl2 and Br2, as oxidants, particularly in oxyhalogenation reactions, which can be used for alkane to alkene conversion.
Zichittella et al. have explored the mechanism and factors governing alkene selectivity for oxyhalogenation in a combined theoretical and experimental study of an iron phosphate catalyst.
Interestingly, the authors have observed a divergence in the mechanism for ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination, with the former being dominated by surface reactions and the latter being mainly dominated by gas-phase reactions (Figure 31).
In the proposed mechanism, ethane oxychlorination follows a surface-mediated CH activation (with a barrier of 0.61 eV) to form an ethyl intermediate which then reacts with a surface chloride to form ethyl chloride in a barrierless process.
Ethyl chloride is subsequently dehydrohalogenated (where a hydrogen and halogen are both removed from the alkyl in a concerted step) to ethylene, the desired product, in another surface reaction.
By contrast, when Br2 is used, a gas-phase reaction is found to be more favorable where bromine desorbs as radicals which dehydrogenate and polybrominate ethane in a process unselective to ethylene.
These results highlight the importance of the competition between surface and gas phase reactions that control the selectivity of the alkene and how the different oxidants shift their relative contributions.

Iron phosphate catalysts show distinct mechanisms for ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination, with the former being surface-dominated while the latter favors gas-phase reactions. The surface-mediated activation pathway in ethane oxychlorination leads to the formation of ethylene as the desired product, contrasting with the gas-phase reaction pathway involving bromine that produces less selective products. These findings underscore the influence of reaction conditions and oxidant choice on alkene selectivity and product distribution.
