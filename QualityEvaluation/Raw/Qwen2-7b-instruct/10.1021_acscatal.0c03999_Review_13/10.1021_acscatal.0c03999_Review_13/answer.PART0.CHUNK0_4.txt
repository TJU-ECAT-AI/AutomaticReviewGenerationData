6.3.1. Sulfides
Zhu et al. have explored the possibility of sulfur as another less active oxidant for alkane conversion, specifically for methane oxidative coupling. (298)
The thermodynamic well for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2 is 13.41 eV, whereas for sulfur oxidation to CS2, it is considerably higher in energy at 3.45 eV. Therefore, the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation is much lower for the sulfur oxidant.
An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C. High temperatures are needed for this process due to both the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on the sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides.
While the performance of this catalyst is found to be relatively modest and far from practical consideration, it is conceivable that future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening.
In particular, the authors have observed the MS bond energy to be a good descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers.

6.3.2. Halides
There has been recent interests in using halogens, such as Cl2 and Br2, as oxidants, particularly in oxyhalogenation reactions, which can be used for alkane to alkene conversion.
Zichittella et al. have explored the mechanism and factors governing alkene selectivity for oxyhalogenation in a combined theoretical and experimental study of an iron phosphate catalyst.
Interestingly, the authors have observed a divergence in the mechanism for ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination, with the former being dominated by surface reactions and the latter being mainly dominated by gas-phase reactions (Figure 31).
In the proposed mechanism, ethane oxychlorination follows a surface-mediated CH activation (with a barrier of 0.61 eV) to form an ethyl intermediate which then reacts with a surface chloride to form ethyl chloride in a barrierless process.
Ethyl chloride is subsequently dehydrohalogenated (where a hydrogen and halogen are both removed from the alkyl in a concerted step) to ethylene, the desired product, in another surface reaction.
By contrast, when Br2 is used, a gas-phase reaction is found to be more favorable where bromine desorbs as radicals which dehydrogenate and polybrominate ethane in a process unselective to ethylene.
These results highlight the importance of the competition between surface and gas phase reactions that control the selectivity of the alkene and how the different oxidants shift their relative contributions.

1. Compared to traditional oxygen-based systems, sulfur as an oxidant in methane oxidative coupling offers a lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation, resulting in less efficient conversion. However, catalysts like PdS can achieve an ethylene selectivity of up to 18% at high temperatures (1050°C), indicating potential for improved catalyst development through theoretical screening to enhance conversion rates. Sulfur catalysts are noted for having higher CH activation barriers and being poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides.

2. Halogen oxidants like chlorine (Cl2) and bromine (Br2) are increasingly studied for alkane to alkene conversions, particularly in oxyhalogenation reactions. Iron phosphate catalysts show distinct mechanisms for ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination, with the former being surface-dominated while the latter favors gas-phase reactions. The surface-mediated activation pathway in ethane oxychlorination leads to the formation of ethylene as the desired product, contrasting with the gas-phase reaction pathway involving bromine that produces less selective products. These findings underscore the influence of reaction conditions and oxidant choice on alkene selectivity and product distribution.

1. 相比传统的氧气系统，硫作为甲烷氧化耦合中的氧化剂提供较低的过氧化热力学驱动力，导致转化效率较低。然而，在高温（1050°C）下使用PdS催化剂可以达到高达18%的乙烯选择性，表明通过理论筛选改进催化剂以提高转化率的潜力。硫催化剂因其较高的CH活化壁垒和对金属氧化物较差的氢抽象能力而受到关注。

2. 氯（Cl2）和溴（Br2）等卤素氧化剂在烷烃转化为烯烃，特别是氧卤化反应中受到越来越多的关注。铁磷酸盐催化剂在乙烷氧氯化和氧溴化过程中显示出不同的机制，前者为表面主导，而后者主要为气相反应。乙烷氧氯化过程中的表面介导活化途径导致乙烯作为目标产物的形成，与使用溴时发生的涉及更不选择性产品的气相反应路径形成对比。这些发现强调了反应条件和氧化剂选择对烯烃选择性和产品分布的影响。
