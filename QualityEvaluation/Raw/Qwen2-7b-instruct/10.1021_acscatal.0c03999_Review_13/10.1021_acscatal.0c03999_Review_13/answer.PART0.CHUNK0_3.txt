[1] "The authors note that the thermodynamic well for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2 is 13.41 eV, whereas for sulfur oxidation to CS2, it is considerably higher in energy at 3.45 eV."
[2] "An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C."
[3] "While the performance of this catalyst is found to be relatively modest and far from practical consideration, it is conceivable that future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening."
[4] "Interestingly, the authors have observed a divergence in the mechanism for ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination, with the former being dominated by surface reactions and the latter being mainly dominated by gas-phase reactions."
[5] "Ethane oxychlorination follows a surface-mediated CH activation (with a barrier of 0.61 eV) to form an ethyl intermediate which then reacts with a surface chloride to form ethyl chloride in a barrierless process."
[6] "By contrast, when Br2 is used, a gas-phase reaction is found to be more favorable where bromine desorbs as radicals which dehydrogenate and polybrominate ethane in a process unselective to ethylene."

1. Compared to traditional oxygen-based systems, sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling exhibits lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation. This leads to less efficient conversion processes. However, the use of sulfur catalysts can achieve up to 18% ethylene selectivity under specific conditions. Future studies could potentially identify catalysts with higher conversion rates through theoretical screening. 

2. The use of halogens like Cl2 and Br2 in alkene selectivity for oxyhalogenation reactions shows distinct differences in mechanisms. Ethane oxychlorination is characterized by surface reactions, while oxybromination relies more on gas-phase reactions. This highlights the competition between surface and gas-phase reactions influencing selectivity, with chlorine favoring surface reactions leading to ethylene production, and bromine favoring gas-phase reactions that are less selective towards ethylene.

1. 相比传统的氧基系统，硫作为甲烷氧化耦合中的替代氧化剂，在过氧化反应中表现出更低的热力学驱动力，导致效率较低的转化过程。然而，在特定条件下使用硫催化剂可以实现高达18%的乙烯选择性。未来的研究可以通过理论筛选可能识别出具有更高转化率的催化剂。

2. 使用氯气和溴气在烯烃选择性氧卤化反应中的机制显示出明显的差异。乙烷氧氯化由表面反应主导，而氧溴化主要依赖于气相反应。这强调了表面和气相反应之间的竞争如何影响选择性，氯气倾向于表面反应产生乙烯，而溴气倾向于更不选择性的气相反应，导致较少选择性地生成乙烯。
