6.3.1. Sulfides
"Zhu et al. have explored the possibility of sulfur as another less active oxidant for alkane conversion, specifically for methane oxidative coupling."
"An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C."
"High temperatures are needed for this process due to both the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on the sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides."
"MS bond energy to be a good descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers."
6.3.2. Halides
"In the proposed mechanism, ethane oxychlorination follows a surface-mediated CH activation (with a barrier of 0.61 eV) to form an ethyl intermediate which then reacts with a surface chloride to form ethyl chloride in a barrierless process."
"By contrast, when Br2 is used, a gas-phase reaction is found to be more favorable where bromine desorbs as radicals which dehydrogenate and polybrominate ethane in a process unselective to ethylene."

1. The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling compares unfavorably to traditional oxygen-based systems in terms of thermodynamics, as the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation is much lower for sulfur. However, it enables an ethylene selectivity of up to 18% on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C. The performance is modest and not yet practical due to high activation barriers and the fact that sulfide catalysts are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides. Future studies may improve catalyst performance through descriptor-based theoretical screening.

2. For halogen-based systems, particularly in oxyhalogenation reactions, ethane oxychlorination is dominated by surface reactions while oxybromination is mainly driven by gas-phase reactions. The surface-mediated mechanism for oxychlorination involves ethane activation to form an ethyl intermediate, followed by a surface chloride reaction to form ethyl chloride. In contrast, bromine desorbs as radicals, dehydrogenating and polybrominating ethane in a non-selective process for ethylene production. This highlights the importance of the competition between surface and gas-phase reactions in controlling alkene selectivity and how the choice of oxidant influences their relative contributions.

1. 硫作为烷烃转化的另一种较不活跃的氧化剂，在甲烷氧化耦合中的应用与传统基于氧气的系统相比，在热力学方面存在劣势，因为硫的过氧化驱动力较低。然而，它在钯硫催化剂上实现了1050°C时高达18%的乙烯选择性。由于硫化物催化剂的氢提取能力较差，与金属氧化物相比，其性能相对温和且尚未达到实用考虑。未来的研究可以通过基于描述符的理论筛选来改进催化剂性能。

2. 对于卤素基系统，特别是氧卤化反应，乙烷氧氯化主要由表面反应主导，而氧溴化主要由气相反应主导。氧氯化表面介导的机制涉及乙烷激活形成乙基中间体，然后与表面氯化物反应形成乙基氯化物。相比之下，溴脱附为自由基，进行脱氢和多溴化乙烷的过程对乙烯生产不利。这突出了表面和气相反应竞争在控制烯烃选择性和不同氧化剂对它们贡献的相对影响的重要性。
