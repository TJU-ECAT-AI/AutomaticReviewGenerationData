The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling compares unfavorably to traditional oxygen-based systems in terms of thermodynamics and catalytic performance. Thermodynamically, sulfur oxidation to CS2 requires more energy (3.45 eV) compared to oxygen oxidation to CO2 (13.41 eV), leading to a lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation. At high temperatures (1050°C), a PdS catalyst achieves an ethylene selectivity of up to 18%. However, the activation barriers for sulfur catalysts are significantly higher than those for metal oxides, ranging from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2. Despite these challenges, future studies might identify catalysts with higher conversion rates through theoretical screening based on descriptors like MS bond energy, which correlate with both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers.

In comparison to halogen-based oxidants, sulfur introduces a distinct mechanism in alkene selectivity for oxyhalogenation reactions. For ethane oxychlorination, the process is dominated by surface reactions, while oxybromination is characterized by predominantly gas-phase reactions. This highlights the importance of the competition between surface and gas-phase reactions in controlling alkene selectivity, with sulfur species favoring the formation of propylene both kinetically and thermodynamically, as opposed to chlorine or bromine.

Opportunities for future improvements in sulfur-based oxidative coupling include optimizing catalyst design and identifying conditions that enhance catalytic activity and selectivity, potentially through the use of descriptor-based theoretical screening. Additionally, understanding the specific mechanisms underlying sulfur's unique reactivity patterns could lead to the development of more efficient and selective sulfur catalysts for alkane-to-alkene conversions.

硫作为甲烷氧化耦合的替代氧化剂，在热力学和催化剂性能方面与传统的氧基系统相比表现不佳。从热力学角度来看，硫氧化为CS2需要更多的能量（3.45 eV），与氧气氧化为CO2（13.41 eV）相比，这导致了过氧化反应的热力学驱动力较低。在1050°C的高温下，PdS催化剂可以达到高达18%的乙烯选择性。然而，硫催化剂的活化壁垒显著高于金属氧化物，范围从MoS2的1.91 eV到TiS2的2.68 eV。尽管存在这些挑战，未来的研究可以通过基于描述符的理论筛选来识别具有更高转化率的催化剂，例如MS键能，它与CH激活和CC耦合反应壁垒相关联。

与卤素基氧化剂相比，硫在烷烃转化为烯烃的氧卤化反应中引入了一种独特的异丁烯选择性机制。对于乙烷的氯氧加成，过程主要由表面反应主导，而溴氧加成则主要是气相反应为主导。这突显了表面和气相反应之间竞争在控制异丁烯选择性中的重要性，硫物种有利于形成丙烯，无论是从动力学还是热力学角度来看，都优于氯或溴。

未来改进硫基氧化耦合的机会包括优化催化剂设计并确定提高催化活性和选择性的条件，可能通过基于描述符的理论筛选实现。此外，理解硫独特反应模式的具体机制可引导开发更高效和选择性更强的硫催化剂，用于烷烃转化为烯烃的过程。
