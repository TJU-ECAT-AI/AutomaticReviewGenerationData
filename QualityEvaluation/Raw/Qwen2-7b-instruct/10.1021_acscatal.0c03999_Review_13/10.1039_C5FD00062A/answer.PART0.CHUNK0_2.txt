[1] "In studying the various possibilities to utilise CO2 to convert hydrocarbons using the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy, thermodynamic calculations were carried out for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2 for the process operating in the temperature range of 300-500."
[2] "The results showed that an increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."
[3] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is an attractive catalytic route for C3H6 production."
[4] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 ( ) has been heavily studied over the last decade."
[5] "In this promising reaction, CO2 acts as a mild oxidant to combine the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with a reverse water gas shift (              ), and hence, the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 can be shifted to the product side."

Regarding the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2), studies have focused on utilizing solar thermal energy as a sustainable energy source. Thermodynamic calculations have been performed for this process operating in the temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius. Increasing the partial pressure of propane led to a reduction in its conversion rate, yet simultaneously promoted an advantageous increase in the selectivity of propylene (C3H6) production. This reaction demonstrates the potential of CO2 as a mild oxidant, facilitating a reverse water gas shift, which shifts the equilibrium towards propylene production. Over the past decade, researchers have extensively studied this catalytic route for the production of propylene from propane.

关于丙烷（C3H8）在二氧化碳（CO2）存在的脱氢反应，研究者们着重利用太阳能热能作为可持续能源进行了研究。对这一过程在300-500摄氏度范围内进行的热力学计算显示，提高丙烷的分压会降低其转化率，但同时显著提高了丙烯（C3H6）选择性生成的机会。在该反应中，二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂，能够促进水煤气逆向反应，从而将反应平衡转移到丙烯生产方面。过去十年里，研究人员广泛研究了利用丙烷脱氢制备丙烯的催化途径。
