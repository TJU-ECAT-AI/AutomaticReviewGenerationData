[1] "In studying the various possibilities to utilise CO2 to convert hydrocarbons using the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy, thermodynamic calculations were carried out for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2 for the process operating in the temperature range of 300-500."
[2] "The results showed that an increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."

[4] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 ( ) has been heavily studied over the last decade."
[5] "In this promising reaction, CO2 acts as a mild oxidant to combine the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with a reverse water gas shift (              ), and hence, the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 can be shifted to the product side."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Regarding the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2), studies have focused on utilizing solar thermal energy as a sustainable energy source. Thermodynamic calculations have been performed for this process operating in the temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius. Increasing the partial pressure of propane led to a reduction in its conversion rate, yet simultaneously promoted an advantageous increase in the selectivity of propylene (C3H6) production. This reaction demonstrates the potential of CO2 as a mild oxidant, facilitating a reverse water gas shift, which shifts the equilibrium towards propylene production. Over the past decade, researchers have extensively studied this catalytic route for the production of propylene from propane.

5.2 Discussion on the changes of C3H6 selectivity.
"The conversion of reactants and the mass balances of carbon and oxygen elements are shown in Table 4. In contrast to the high stability of the C3H8 conversion, the CO2 conversions dropped drastically over the first 5 hours. This may be due to the various and different sites for C3H8 and CO2 to be adsorbed on the catalyst surface respectively; C3H8 is usually attached to Cr species while CO2 can be adsorbed at the interface between Cr2O3 dopant and ZrO2 support."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The conversion rates of reactants and the mass balances of carbon and oxygen elements are detailed in Table 4. Contrary to the high stability of the C3H8 conversion, the CO2 conversion dramatically decreased within the first 5 hours. This could be attributed to the varied adsorption sites for C3H8 and CO2 on the catalyst surface, where C3H8 typically binds to Cr species, whereas CO2 adsorbs at the interface between the Cr2O3 dopant and ZrO2 support.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
反应物转化率和碳氧元素的质量平衡显示在表4中。与C3H8转化的高稳定性形成对比，CO2转化在最初的5小时内急剧下降。这可能是由于C3H8和CO2在催化剂表面的吸附位点不同；C3H8通常附着于Cr物种上，而CO2则吸附在Cr2O3掺杂剂与ZrO2支撑体的界面处。

Conclusions
"With the aim of attempting to (ultimately) correlate the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 with the energy source from solar heating technology, thermodynamic calculations were operated for chemical processes operating in the temperature range 300-500. An important outcome is the great potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and also coking resistance across this temperature range."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
With the goal of linking the C3H8 dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 to the energy source from solar heating technology, thermodynamic calculations were performed for chemical processes in the 300-500 temperature range. A significant finding is the superior potential of C3H8 compared to its lighter and heavier isomers (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) in terms of both CO2 activation and coking resistance across this temperature range.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide is a promising catalytic process for producing propylene. Thermodynamic calculations were performed for this process within a temperature range of 300 to 500 degrees Celsius. Increasing the partial pressure of propane led to a decrease in propane conversion but resulted in a significant enhancement of propylene selectivity. The conversion of propane was similarly inhibited by increasing the gas hourly space velocity, but the cracking of propylene could not be controlled in this manner. The catalyst maintained high stability in the conversion of propane, as evidenced by Figure 7. The weight loss observed from 200 degrees Celsius was attributed to the combustion of amorphous carbon in air. The X-ray diffraction pattern revealed that the peak at 2θ=36.18 corresponded to the 1-1-0 phase of chromium oxide with rhombohedral crystal symmetry.

丙烷在二氧化碳存在的条件下脱氢是生产丙烯的有吸引力的催化途径。进行了该过程在300至500摄氏度之间的温度范围内的热力学计算。提高丙烷的分压导致丙烷转化率下降，但丙烯选择性显著增加。通过提高气体小时空间速度同样抑制了丙烷的转化，但无法控制丙烯的裂解。催化剂在丙烷转化中表现出高稳定性，这从第7幅图中可以观察到。从200摄氏度开始观察到的重量损失归因为空气中无定形碳的燃烧。X射线衍射图案显示，2θ=36.18处的峰对应于氧化铬的1-1-0相，其晶胞为等边三角形。
