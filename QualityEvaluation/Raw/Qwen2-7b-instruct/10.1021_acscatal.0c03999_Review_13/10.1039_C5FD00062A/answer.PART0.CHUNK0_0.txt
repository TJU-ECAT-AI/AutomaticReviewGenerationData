[1] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is an attractive catalytic route for C3H6 production."
[2] "The results showed that an increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."
[3] "The shift of the equilibrium state by CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 has been identified from a thermodynamic analysis."
[4] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is recognisably the best alkane to be targeted for a chemical utilisation process for CO2 operating in this temperature range."
[5] "The C3H8 conversion is observed to be significantly affected by the partial pressure of C3H8 within the temperature range of 300-500."

1. The dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) is an appealing method for producing propylene (C3H6). 
2. Increasing the partial pressure of propane led to a decrease in its conversion rate, but concurrently resulted in an advantageous increase in propylene selectivity.
3. CO2 has been shown to shift the equilibrium state in the dehydrogenation of propane according to thermodynamic analysis.
4. Among the hydrocarbons considered, propane is the most suitable feedstock for CO2 utilization processes operating within the temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius.
5. The conversion of propane was notably influenced by its partial pressure within the specified temperature range.
