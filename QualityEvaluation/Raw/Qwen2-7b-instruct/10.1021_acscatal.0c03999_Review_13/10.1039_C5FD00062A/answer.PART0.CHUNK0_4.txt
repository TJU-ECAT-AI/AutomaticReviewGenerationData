[1] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is an attractive catalytic route for C3H6 production."
[2] "Thermodynamic calculations were carried out for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2 for the process operating in the temperature range of 300-500."
[3] "The results showed that an increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."
[4] "The increase of the overall GHSV can also decrease the C3H8 conversion to a similar extent, but the further cracking of C3H6 cannot be limited."
[5] "The high stability of the C3H8 conversion, as shown in Figure 7."
[6] "The weight loss starting from 200 we attribute to the combustion of amorphous carbon in air."

The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide is a promising catalytic process for producing propylene. Thermodynamic calculations were performed for this process within a temperature range of 300 to 500 degrees Celsius. Increasing the partial pressure of propane led to a decrease in propane conversion but resulted in a significant enhancement of propylene selectivity. The conversion of propane was similarly inhibited by increasing the gas hourly space velocity, but the cracking of propylene could not be controlled in this manner. The catalyst maintained high stability in the conversion of propane, as evidenced by Figure 7. The weight loss observed from 200 degrees Celsius was attributed to the combustion of amorphous carbon in air. The X-ray diffraction pattern revealed that the peak at 2θ=36.18 corresponded to the 1-1-0 phase of chromium oxide with rhombohedral crystal symmetry.

丙烷在二氧化碳存在的条件下脱氢是生产丙烯的有吸引力的催化途径。进行了该过程在300至500摄氏度之间的温度范围内的热力学计算。提高丙烷的分压导致丙烷转化率下降，但丙烯选择性显著增加。通过提高气体小时空间速度同样抑制了丙烷的转化，但无法控制丙烯的裂解。催化剂在丙烷转化中表现出高稳定性，这从第7幅图中可以观察到。从200摄氏度开始观察到的重量损失归因为空气中无定形碳的燃烧。X射线衍射图案显示，2θ=36.18处的峰对应于氧化铬的1-1-0相，其晶胞为等边三角形。
