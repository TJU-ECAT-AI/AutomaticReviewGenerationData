3.1 Methods
"In order to fully understand the thermodynamic basis of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2, in connecting also with the solar thermal technology which is normally set close to 500 in the form of high pressure steam, the standard change of reaction in Gibbs free energy ΔG of the dehydrogenation of C2-C4 alkanes with CO2 utilisation ( ) were calculated in the temperature range of 300-500."

3.2 Thermodynamic advantages of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2
"Importantly, ΔG does not keep falling as the carbon number of alkane increases, and to dehydrogenate C3H8 with CO2 appears more feasible than some C4 reactions, for example"

4.3 Catalyst Testing
"The stability test of C3H8 dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 was operated in an M-R-10A micro-reactor (KUNLUN YONGTAI Company, China) over the Cr-based catalyst prepared as above. All tests were operated under atmospheric pressure and 500 for 5 hours, and the C3H8/CO2 mixture, whose mole ratio was kept at C3H8/CO2 =1:2."

5.2 Discussion on the changes of C3H6 selectivity.
"The conversion of reactants and the mass balances of carbon and oxygen elements are shown in Table 4. In contrast to the high stability of the C3H8 conversion, the CO2 conversions dropped drastically over the first 5 hours. This may be due to the various and different sites for C3H8 and CO2 to be adsorbed on the catalyst surface respectively; C3H8 is usually attached to Cr species while CO2 can be adsorbed at the interface between Cr2O3 dopant and ZrO2 support."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The conversion rates of reactants and the mass balances of carbon and oxygen elements are detailed in Table 4. Contrary to the high stability of the C3H8 conversion, the CO2 conversion dramatically decreased within the first 5 hours. This could be attributed to the varied adsorption sites for C3H8 and CO2 on the catalyst surface, where C3H8 typically binds to Cr species, whereas CO2 adsorbs at the interface between the Cr2O3 dopant and ZrO2 support.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
反应物转化率和碳氧元素的质量平衡显示在表4中。与C3H8转化的高稳定性形成对比，CO2转化在最初的5小时内急剧下降。这可能是由于C3H8和CO2在催化剂表面的吸附位点不同；C3H8通常附着于Cr物种上，而CO2则吸附在Cr2O3掺杂剂与ZrO2支撑体的界面处。

Conclusions
"With the aim of attempting to (ultimately) correlate the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 with the energy source from solar heating technology, thermodynamic calculations were operated for chemical processes operating in the temperature range 300-500. An important outcome is the great potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and also coking resistance across this temperature range."
</quotes>

With the goal of linking the C3H8 dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 to the energy source from solar heating technology, thermodynamic calculations were performed for chemical processes in the 300-500 temperature range. A significant finding is the superior potential of C3H8 compared to its lighter and heavier isomers (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) in terms of both CO2 activation and coking resistance across this temperature range.

为了尝试最终将存在CO2的C3H8脱氢与太阳能加热技术的能量源联系起来，对在300-500温度范围运行的化学过程进行了热力学计算。一个重要的结果是，在此温度范围内，从CO2活化和焦炭抗性的角度，C3H8相对于其较轻和较重的同系物（分别为C2H6和C4H10）具有巨大的潜力。
