[1] "Steam cracking remains the most industrially relevant pathway, but other routes for light-olefin production have emerged."
[2] "Although it is the industry standard for ethene production,steam cracking has disadvantages."
[3] "Because of the special role of the ODH of ethane and its potential process applications, we have decided to take a different approach."
[4] "In contrast to these conclusions and the assumption that [Li+O] is the active site, Freund and co-workers concluded that the paramagnetic [Li+O] species did not exist under the reaction conditions."
