[1] "The recurring increase in the price of crude oil and, in partic- ular, the availability of ethane in shale gas, has advanced the interest in alternative processes for ethene production, includ- ing the dehydration of ethanol (thus enabling the utilization of biomass-derived feeds) and the (oxidative) dehydrogenation of ethane."
[2] "Several excellent reviews have broadly addressed ODH reac- tions.[610]"
[3] "The oxidation of ethane, which couples the endothermic dehydration of ethane with the strongly exothermic oxidation of hydrogen, would po- tentially be the most attractive alternative route because it avoids the need for excessive internal heat input, but also con- sumes valuable hydrogen."
[4] "The process operates at very high temperatures with high reactant streams, the requirements on the equip- ment are demanding."
[5] "Per ton of ethene, 11.6 t CO2 are produced through this external heating."

Alternative processes for ethene production, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE), have gained interest due to rising crude oil prices and the availability of ethane in shale gas. ODHE combines the endothermic dehydration of ethane with the exothermic oxidation of hydrogen, offering a potentially attractive route by reducing heat input needs and utilizing valuable hydrogen. However, the high operating temperatures and reactant streams in the process impose significant equipment demands. Producing one ton of ethene through this method generates approximately 11.6 tons of CO2 as an external heating byproduct.

由于原油价格的持续上涨以及页岩气中乙烷的可用性，替代的乙烯生产过程，如乙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHE），引起了人们的兴趣。ODHE将乙烷的吸热脱氢与氢氧化的强烈放热结合在一起，提供了一种潜在有吸引力的途径，通过减少热量输入需求和利用有价值的氢气来降低设备需求。然而，该过程的高操作温度和反应物流体对设备提出了重大要求。通过这种方法生产一吨乙烯会产生约11.6吨二氧化碳作为外部加热副产品。

[1] "It is known that neighboring surface vanadia species lead to enhanced reducibility and, hence, also to increased reactivity."
[2] "The first concept in this chapter is an indirect route to oxida- tive dehydrogenation, which is realized by the halogenation of CH4 followed by radical formation or acid-catalyzed elimination and subsequent CC coupling on LaCl3-based catalysts."
[3] "The cleavage of the first CH bond may occur homolytically or heterolytically."

Neighboring vanadium oxide species on the surface are known to enhance reducibility, leading to increased reactivity. The first concept for achieving oxidative dehydrogenation in this chapter involves an indirect route, which starts with the halogenation of methane. This is followed by radical formation or acid-catalyzed elimination, and then subsequent carbon-carbon (CC) coupling on catalysts based on LaCl3. The first CH bond cleavage can happen either homolytically or heterolytically.

表面相邻的范德华氧化物种已知可以增强可还原性，从而导致活性增加。本章中的第一个概念是实现氧化脱氢的一种间接途径，它始于甲烷的卤化。随后是自由基形成或酸催化消除，然后在基于LaCl3的催化剂上进行后续的碳-碳（CC）耦合。第一个CH键断裂可能以均裂或异裂的方式发生。

[1] "The addition of Cl ions seems to accelerate olefin de- sorption by weakening the interactions with ethene, thus limit- ing its further oxidation."
[2] "The presence of acidic sites close to the redox center favors a fast desorption of the olefin intermediates from the catalyst, thus leading to high selectivity for ethene."
[3] "However, the behavior of acidic sites must not be compared with the influence of acidic sites in vanadia species that are supported on bulk oxides, in which acidic centers on the support favor an unselective conversion of ethane."

The addition of Cl ions accelerates olefin desorption by weakening its interactions with ethene, thus preventing further oxidation. The proximity of acidic sites to the redox center promotes the rapid desorption of olefin intermediates from the catalyst, resulting in high selectivity for ethene. However, the effect of acidic sites cannot be equated with their role in vanadia species supported on bulk oxides, where acidic sites on the support promote an unselective conversion of ethane.

加入Cl离子通过削弱其与乙烯的相互作用加速了烯烃的脱附，从而限制了进一步的氧化。靠近红ox中心的酸性位点有利于烯烃中间体从催化剂的快速脱附，从而导致高乙烯选择性。然而，酸性位点的行为不能与支持在基质氧化物上的范德瓦斯物种中的酸性中心所发挥的作用相比较，在这种情况下，支持上的酸性中心促进了乙烷的非选择性转化。

[1] "The improvement of the catalytic performance of rare-earth oxides can also be achieved by the addition of halides."
[2] "Au and co-workers reported that the addition of 50 mol% BaCl2 to Ho2O3 [141] lowered the reactivity of the oxygen species and, thus, favored the activation of the weaker CH bond in ethane (410 kJmol1) instead of the CH bond in ethene (452 kJmol1)."
[3] "Again, a higher concentration of basic sites, which was induced by the addition of BaCl2, decreased the adsorp- tion of ethene and, thus, the total oxidation of ethane."

Consequently, an increased concentration of basic sites, induced by BaCl2 addition, decreased ethene adsorption, thus reducing the total oxidation of ethane.

提高稀有稀土氧化物的催化性能也可以通过添加卤化物实现。Au及其同事发现向Ho2O3 [141]中添加50摩尔% BaCl2降低了氧物种的活性，从而有利于激活乙烷（410 kJ/mol）中的较弱CH键而不是乙烯（452 kJ/mol）中的CH键。因此，BaCl2添加诱导的较高浓度的基本位点减少了乙烯的吸附，从而减少了乙烷的总氧化。
