The literature does not provide direct comparisons between sulfur-based oxidants and conventional oxidants in the context of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, not propane, and the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in that context. However, it does mention that the choice of oxidant can significantly affect the selectivity and yield of the desired product, with sulfur-based oxidants potentially offering advantages over conventional ones due to their ability to selectively remove hydrogen atoms without excessively promoting further oxidation reactions. Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants include the potential formation of sulfur-containing byproducts and the need for careful control of reaction conditions to avoid unwanted side reactions. Future research aims to improve catalyst design to enhance the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process, reduce byproduct formation, and optimize the use of sulfur-based oxidants to maximize propylene yield.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene has been compared with conventional oxidants, such as H2O2, O2, and others. The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants, including H2S, S2, and SO2, in ODHP was contrasted with conventional oxidants. 

H2S, S2, and SO2 are sulfur-based oxidants that can be used in the ODHP process. H2S is known to activate the first CH bond through a single-electron process. S2 is also capable of initiating the reaction by abstracting a hydrogen atom. SO2, on the other hand, can be reduced to form S2, which then acts as an effective oxidant. The specific challenges associated with these oxidants include the formation of byproducts such as sulfur compounds, which can affect the yield of propylene. 

Future research in this field aims to improve catalyst design to enhance the efficiency of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP. Key areas for future research include optimizing the catalytic properties to reduce byproduct formation and improving the selectivity for propylene. This involves developing catalysts that can effectively utilize sulfur-based oxidants while minimizing unwanted reactions.

The high energy barriers involved in the single-electron process in sulfur-based oxidants can lead to complex gas-phase reactions, complicating control of the ODHP process. The use of acid sites on the catalyst surface can degrade the product towards carbon oxides, highlighting the need for selective catalysts that minimize unwanted reactions.

The electronegativity of dopants can influence the activity and selectivity of catalysts in ODHP. Higher concentrations of acidic sites on the catalyst surface can increase the overall activity, but their impact on selectivity for propylene needs to be carefully balanced.

The presence of vanadia-free Al2O3 sites raises questions about the suitability of other supports for ODHP. These sites are known to catalyze the total oxidation of the olefin, mainly into CO, indicating a need for catalysts that selectively promote propylene formation.

The activity of catalysts can be improved by adjusting the concentration of acidic sites and the electronegativity of dopants. This can lead to a higher propylene yield, but the selectivity towards propylene needs to be optimized to ensure efficient conversion.

The strength of the Lewis acid can be decreased by adding alkali/alkali-earth chlorides, which can improve the selectivity of the catalyst in ODHP. Future research aims to find the optimal balance between activity and selectivity, as well as to develop more efficient catalysts that can handle sulfur-based oxidants effectively while minimizing byproduct formation.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯的过程中，将硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂进行了比较。对硫基氧化剂（包括H2S、S2和SO2）在ODHP过程中的有效性进行了对比，与传统氧化剂进行了对比。

H2S、S2和SO2是可用于ODHP过程的硫基氧化剂。H2S通过单电子过程激活第一个CH键。S2也可以通过抽象一个氢原子来启动反应。SO2可以被还原形成S2，然后作为有效的氧化剂使用。这些氧化剂的特定挑战包括形成副产品，如硫化合物，这会影响丙烯的产率。

未来的研究旨在改进催化剂设计，以提高硫基氧化剂在ODHP过程中的效率。需要研究的关键领域包括优化催化剂性能，减少副产品形成，并提高丙烯的选择性。这涉及到开发能够有效利用硫基氧化剂同时减少非期望反应的催化剂。

硫基氧化剂在ODHP过程中涉及的高能量壁垒可能导致复杂的气相反应，使控制过程变得复杂。催化剂表面的酸性位点可能导致产品向碳氧化物的降解，强调需要选择性的催化剂，以最小化不希望的反应。

掺杂剂的电负性可以影响催化剂在ODHP过程中的活性和选择性。表面酸性位点的更高浓度可以增加总体活性，但其对丙烯选择性的影响需要仔细平衡。

存在无钒的Al2O3位点提出了其他支持材料是否更适合ODHP的问题。这些位点已知催化总氧化，主要为CO，表明需要促进丙烯形成的催化剂。

通过调整酸性位点的浓度和掺杂剂的电负性，可以提高催化剂的活性。这可以导致更高的丙烯产率，但丙烯的选择性需要优化，以确保高效转换。

可以通过添加碱/碱土卤化物降低Lewis酸的强度，从而提高催化剂在ODHP中的选择性。未来的研究目标是在保持活性的同时优化选择性，并开发更高效的催化剂，能够有效处理硫基氧化剂，同时尽量减少副产品形成。

Alternative processes for ethene production, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE), have gained interest due to rising crude oil prices and the availability of ethane in shale gas. ODHE combines the endothermic dehydration of ethane with the exothermic oxidation of hydrogen, offering a potentially attractive route by reducing heat input needs and utilizing valuable hydrogen. However, the high operating temperatures and reactant streams in the process impose significant equipment demands. Producing one ton of ethene through this method generates approximately 11.6 tons of CO2 as an external heating byproduct.
