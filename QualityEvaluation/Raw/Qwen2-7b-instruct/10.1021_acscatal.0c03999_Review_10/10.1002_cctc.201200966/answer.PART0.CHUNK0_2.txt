Compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, discussing their impact on propylene yield, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant (including byproduct formation), and the key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.

The literature does not provide direct comparisons between sulfur-based oxidants and conventional oxidants in the context of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, not propane, and the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in that context. However, it does mention that the choice of oxidant can significantly affect the selectivity and yield of the desired product, with sulfur-based oxidants potentially offering advantages over conventional ones due to their ability to selectively remove hydrogen atoms without excessively promoting further oxidation reactions. Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants include the potential formation of sulfur-containing byproducts and the need for careful control of reaction conditions to avoid unwanted side reactions. Future research aims to improve catalyst design to enhance the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process, reduce byproduct formation, and optimize the use of sulfur-based oxidants to maximize propylene yield.

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is not directly compared with that of conventional oxidants in the provided literature. However, the literature indicates that sulfur-based oxidants can offer advantages over conventional ones in this process due to their ability to selectively remove hydrogen atoms without excessively promoting further oxidation reactions. This leads to a higher yield of propylene. Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants include the potential formation of sulfur-containing byproducts and the need for careful control of reaction conditions to avoid unwanted side reactions. Future research focuses on improving catalyst design to enhance the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process, reducing byproduct formation, and optimizing the use of sulfur-based oxidants to maximize propylene yield.

文献中没有直接比较硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯过程中的有效性。然而，文献表明，硫基氧化剂可以在这一过程中提供优势，因为它们能够选择性地去除氢原子而不过度促进进一步的氧化反应，从而提高丙烯的产率。与硫基氧化剂相关的挑战包括可能形成硫化合物副产品以及需要仔细控制反应条件以避免不必要的副反应。未来的研究集中在改进催化剂设计以提高氧化脱氢过程的效率，减少副产品的形成，并优化硫基氧化剂的使用以最大化丙烯的产率。
