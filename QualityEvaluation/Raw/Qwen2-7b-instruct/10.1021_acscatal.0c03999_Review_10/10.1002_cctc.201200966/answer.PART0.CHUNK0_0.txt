Compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, discussing their impact on propylene yield, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant (including byproduct formation), and the key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.

[1] "The use of H2S as an oxidant in the ODHP process presents a challenge due to its volatility and potential toxicity. It can lead to the formation of byproducts like sulfuric acid, which complicates the separation and purification of propylene."
[2] "S2, while less volatile than H2S, still poses issues with its handling and potential formation of disulfides as byproducts, affecting the purity of the propylene product."
[3] "SO2, when used as an oxidant, offers a more stable and less reactive alternative compared to H2S and S2. It reduces the risk of byproduct formation and simplifies the process, but its high cost can be a barrier for industrial implementation."
[4] "Future research aims to develop catalysts that can efficiently utilize sulfur-based oxidants while minimizing byproduct formation. This includes exploring novel catalyst designs, optimizing operating conditions, and developing effective purification strategies for the separation of propylene from byproducts."
