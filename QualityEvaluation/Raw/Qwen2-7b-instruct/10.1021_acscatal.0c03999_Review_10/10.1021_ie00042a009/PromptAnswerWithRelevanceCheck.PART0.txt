[1] "The CO yield is not a reliable indicator for the coke production."
[2] "A more likely explanation of the increase in the asymptotic coking rate is the participation of SH radicals in termination reactions with the coke macro-radical."
[3] "Direct observations are possible only after some maintenance or catastrophic shutdown."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Comparing the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, we find that sulfur compounds like hydrogen sulfide (H2S), sulfur disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) can impact propylene yield and byproduct formation differently. Each oxidant presents unique challenges:

1. **Impact on Propylene Yield**: The specific sulfur compound used can affect the propylene yield. For instance, hydrogen sulfide might lead to higher propylene yield due to its reactivity in the ODHP process. However, sulfur disulfide or sulfur dioxide might result in a different yield profile due to their distinct chemical properties and reaction mechanisms.

2. **Specific Challenges**: 
   - **Byproduct Formation**: Hydrogen sulfide can produce additional byproducts, including hydrogen sulfide itself, which can complicate the process. Sulfur disulfide might break down into simpler sulfur species, potentially affecting the catalyst life and product purity. Sulfur dioxide can react with the catalyst or product to form undesirable compounds, impacting the overall efficiency and product quality.

3. **Key Areas for Future Research**:
   - **Catalyst Design**: Improving catalysts to better handle the specific sulfur species, enhancing their selectivity for propylene production while minimizing byproduct formation.
   - **Optimizing Reaction Conditions**: Tuning the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, catalyst loading) to maximize propylene yield and minimize byproducts, considering the unique reactivity profiles of each sulfur compound.
   - **Process Integration**: Developing integrated processes that efficiently remove or utilize byproducts, improving overall process economics and environmental sustainability.

Direct observations of the process dynamics are limited to maintenance periods or shutdowns. This necessitates advanced monitoring systems and possibly predictive models to better understand and control the process in real-time, aiming for optimized operation and enhanced yield of propylene.

比较不同硫基氧化剂在丙烷（ODHP）氧化脱氢到丙烯过程中的效果，我们发现硫化合物如氢硫酸（H2S）、硫二硫化物（S2）和二氧化硫（SO2）对丙烯产量和副产品形成的影响各不相同。每种氧化剂都带来了独特的挑战：

1. **对丙烯产量的影响**：所使用的特定硫化合物可能会影响丙烯产量。例如，氢硫酸可能导致更高的丙烯产量，因为其在ODHP过程中的反应活性较高。然而，硫二硫化物或二氧化硫可能会导致不同的产量模式，由于它们的化学特性和反应机制不同。

2. **具体挑战**：
   - **副产品形成**：氢硫酸可能会产生额外的副产品，包括氢硫酸本身，这可能使过程变得复杂。硫二硫化物可能会分解成更简单的硫物种，这可能影响催化剂寿命和产品质量。二氧化硫可以与催化剂或产物反应，形成不利于的化合物，影响整体效率和产品质量。

3. **未来研究的关键领域**：
   - **催化剂设计**：改进催化剂以更好地处理特定的硫物种，提高其选择性，同时减少副产品的生成。
   - **优化反应条件**：调整反应条件（温度、压力、催化剂装载量），以最大化丙烯产量并减少副产品的生成，考虑到每种硫化合物的独特反应特性。
   - **流程集成**：开发集成流程，有效去除或利用副产品，提高整体流程经济性和环境可持续性。

直接观察过程动态仅限于维护期间或停机时间。这需要先进的监控系统和可能的预测模型，以便更好地理解和控制实时过程，旨在实现优化操作和增强丙烯产量。

[1] "A major drawback of sulfur-containing additives is their detrimental effect on the coil material."
[2] "It is reported that the CO yield is thereby reduced, and this is often interpreted as evidence of reduced coking."
[3] "Sulfur clearly acts upon the catalytic gasification of the steam-reforming process, responsible for the CO production."
[4] "The detrimental effect of sulfur on the asymptotic coking rate was also observed for higher sulfur concentrations in the feed."
[5] "The detrimental effect of sulfur compounds may be related to the thermal decomposition of the sulfur compound, leading to hydrogen sulfide."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is discussed in the document. Among these oxidants, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are considered. Each oxidant has specific challenges associated with it, including byproduct formation. The document highlights that sulfur compounds can alter the rate of radical reactions through their interference with hydrogen transfer and termination reactions. The impact on propylene yield varies depending on the oxidant. For instance, hydrogen sulfide can reduce the CO yield, which might be misinterpreted as reduced coking. However, the document clarifies that the CO yield is not a reliable indicator for the coke formation. The thermal stability of sulfur compounds plays a crucial role in their effectiveness. Higher sulfur concentrations can lead to excessive coking, indicating a relationship with the thermal decomposition of sulfur compounds, which could release hydrogen sulfide. Future research aims to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process by addressing these challenges and understanding the mechanisms better.
