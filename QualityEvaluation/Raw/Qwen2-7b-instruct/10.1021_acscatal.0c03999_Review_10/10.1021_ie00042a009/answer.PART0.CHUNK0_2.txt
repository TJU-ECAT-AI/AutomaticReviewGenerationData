[1] "Representative curves of coke vs time and coking rate vs time, determined by the electrobal- ance technique are shown in Figures 3 and 4."
[2] "The CO yields vs time curves behave very much like the coking rate vs time curves."
[3] "For a given concentration of sulfur in the feed, the asymptotic coking rate decreases in the order dimethyl disulfide > carbon disulfide > benzothiophene > thiophene."
[4] "The detrimental effect of sulfur compounds on the coke formation may seem to be in contradiction with current industrial practice."
[5] "What is well established in industrial practice is the reduction of the CO yield by sulfur compounds."

1. Representative graphs depicting the quantity of coke versus time and the coking rate versus time, measured using the electrobalance method, are illustrated in Figures 3 and 4.
2. The patterns of carbon monoxide production over time closely resemble those of the coking rate over time.
3. When sulfur concentration in the feed is considered, the asymptotic coking rate decreases in the sequence of dimethyl disulfide > carbon disulfide > benzothiophene > thiophene.
4. The observed effect of sulfur compounds on coke formation appears to contradict common industrial practices.
5. It is widely recognized that sulfur compounds lower the yield of carbon monoxide.

1. 表示焦炭量与时间、焦化速率与时间的关系，通过电平衡技术测量的结果在图3和图4中展示。
2. 碳一氧化物产量随时间的变化模式与焦化速率随时间的变化模式非常相似。
3. 当考虑硫化合物在原料中的浓度时，焦化的最终速率按以下顺序递减：二甲基二硫化物 > 硫化氢 > 噻吩衍生物 > 噻吩。
4. 硫化合物对焦炭形成的影响似乎与工业实践中的共识相矛盾。
5. 工业实践中普遍认为，硫化合物降低了碳一氧化物的产率。
