[1] "The detrimental effect of sulfur compounds on the coke formation was confirmed by pilot plant experiments in an Incoloy 800H coil."
[2] "For a coil outlet temperature of 805 "C, a steam dilution of 0.3 kg/kg, a residence time of 0.8 s and a propane conversion of 6l%,the CO yield in the absence of carbon disulfide was 6 wt %, while the C yield amounted to 0.018 g of coke1100 g of ethane fed."
[3] "With 50 ppm carbon disulfide in the feed, the CO yield was reduced to 0.3 wt %, while the C yield increased to 0.113 wt %."
[4] "Although Trimm and Turner (1981) observed a decrease in the rate of coke deposition on presulfided foils of stainless steel with a nickel content of 9-11 wt %,on presulfided stainless steel (Fe 53.5, Cr 24.5, Ni 20.5, Mn 1.8, Si 0.55 wt %) with a higher nickel content the situation was found to be more complex."
[5] "For a given concentration of sulfur in the feed the asymptotic coking rate decreases in the order dimethyl disulfide > carbon disulfide > benzothiophene > thiophene."

1. Sulfur compounds significantly impact the coke formation process in the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons, as confirmed by experiments conducted in an Incoloy 800H coil.
2. Without the addition of carbon disulfide, the CO yield for propane cracking at specified conditions was 6 wt %, whereas the coke yield amounted to 0.018 g per 100 g of ethane fed.
3. Adding 50 ppm carbon disulfide to the feed reduced the CO yield to 0.3 wt %, while the coke yield increased to 0.113 wt %.
4. The relationship between sulfur content and coke deposition on stainless steel foils revealed a more intricate scenario when the nickel content was higher than 9-11 wt %.
5. The detrimental effect of sulfur compounds on the coke deposition rate followed a specific order: dimethyl disulfide, carbon disulfide, benzothiophene, and thiophene.

1. 硫化合物对热裂解过程中焦炭沉积过程产生显著影响，这已在Incoloy 800H线圈中进行的实验中得到证实。
2. 在指定条件下，不添加碳二亚砜时，丙烷裂解的CO产率为6%，而每100克乙烷消耗的焦炭产量为0.018克。
3. 添加50 ppm碳二亚砜到流体中将CO产率降低至0.3%，而焦炭产率增加至0.113%。
4. 当不锈钢箔的镍含量高于9-11 wt %时，硫含量与焦炭沉积之间的关系表现出更为复杂的场景。
5. 硫化合物对焦炭沉积速率的影响顺序为：二甲基二硫化物、碳二亚砜、噻吩并二甲苯、噻吩。
