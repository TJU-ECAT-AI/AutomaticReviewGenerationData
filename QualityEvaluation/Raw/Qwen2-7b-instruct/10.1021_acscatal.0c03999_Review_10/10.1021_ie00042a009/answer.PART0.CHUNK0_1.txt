[1] "A major drawback of sulfur-containing additives is their detrimental effect on the coil material."
[2] "It is reported that the CO yield is thereby reduced, and this is often interpreted as evidence of reduced coking."
[3] "Sulfur clearly acts upon the catalytic gasification of the steam-reforming process, responsible for the CO production."
[4] "The detrimental effect of sulfur on the asymptotic coking rate was also observed for higher sulfur concentrations in the feed."
[5] "The detrimental effect of sulfur compounds may be related to the thermal decomposition of the sulfur compound, leading to hydrogen sulfide."

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is discussed in the document. Among these oxidants, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are considered. Each oxidant has specific challenges associated with it, including byproduct formation. The document highlights that sulfur compounds can alter the rate of radical reactions through their interference with hydrogen transfer and termination reactions. The impact on propylene yield varies depending on the oxidant. For instance, hydrogen sulfide can reduce the CO yield, which might be misinterpreted as reduced coking. However, the document clarifies that the CO yield is not a reliable indicator for the coke formation. The thermal stability of sulfur compounds plays a crucial role in their effectiveness. Higher sulfur concentrations can lead to excessive coking, indicating a relationship with the thermal decomposition of sulfur compounds, which could release hydrogen sulfide. Future research aims to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process by addressing these challenges and understanding the mechanisms better.

在文档中讨论了硫基氧化剂在丙烷（ODHP）氧化脱氢为丙烯中的有效性。这些氧化剂包括氢化物（H2S）、二硫化物（S2）和二氧化硫（SO2）。每种氧化剂都有其特定的挑战，包括副产品的形成。文档指出，硫化合物可以改变自由基反应的速度，通过干扰氢转移和终止反应。不同氧化剂对丙烯产率的影响各不相同。例如，氢化物可以减少CO产率，这可能被误认为是焦化减少。然而，文档澄清了CO产率并非衡量焦化形成的有效指标。硫化合物的热稳定性对其有效性起着关键作用。更高的硫浓度可能导致过度结焦，表明与硫化合物的热分解释放氢化物有关。未来研究旨在通过解决这些挑战并更好地理解机制来改进催化剂设计和优化整体过程。
