The document discusses the comparative effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. It highlights that sulfur compounds efficiently reduce the CO yield but promote coke formation. The CO yield is noted not to be a reliable indicator for coke production. Sulfur compounds are said to act upon the catalytic gasification of the steam-reforming process, responsible for CO production. The detrimental effect of sulfur on coke deposition is clearly demonstrated, with sulfur compounds increasing both the initial and asymptotic coking rates. However, the document does not provide specific details on the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants such as H2S, S2, and SO2, nor do they discuss the challenges associated with each oxidant or the impact on propylene yield. Future research areas for improving catalyst design and optimizing the overall process are not outlined in the provided document.

本文讨论了硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯中的相对有效性。它强调，硫化合物能够有效地降低CO产量，但促进焦炭形成。CO产量被指出并非焦炭生成的可靠指标。硫化合物被说成是作用于蒸汽重整过程的催化气体化，负责CO生产。硫化合物对焦炭沉积的负面影响得到了明确的证明，它们增加了初始和渐进的焦炭生成速率。然而，本文没有提供关于H2S、S2和SO2等不同硫基氧化剂的具体效果，也没有讨论每个氧化剂的挑战或对丙烯产量的影响。对于改进催化剂设计和优化整体过程的研究领域，在提供的文档中并未列出。
