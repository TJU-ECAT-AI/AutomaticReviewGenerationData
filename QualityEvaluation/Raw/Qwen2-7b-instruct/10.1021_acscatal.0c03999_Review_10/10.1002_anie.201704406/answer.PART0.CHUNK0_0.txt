<p>More than 30% of the known world's natural gas reserves are located in remote and scattered wells.</p>
<p>This fact precludes their use as a long-lasting feedstock for the manufacture of chemicals and fuels because of prohibitively expensive shipping to centralized megaplants.</p>
<p>Consequently, natural gas emitted from these wells is nowadays flared or vented, wasting approximately 3.5% of global production, which is a fraction worth 13 billion USD.</p>
<p>Among the various routes proposed to overcome the capital intensiveness of conventional syngas-based processes, the bromine-mediated functionalization of methane into methyl bromide (CH3Br), a versatile C1 platform molecule with similar upgrading paths to methanol, has emerged as an attractive technology for the manufacture of readily transportable value-added chemicals and fuels in compact plants amenable to decentralization.</p>
<p>The highly efficient carbon atom utilization enabled by developments in the bromination, reproportionation, and coupling reactions, as well as advances in corrosion resistant construction materials, led to a large-scale demonstration of the bromine-based process for the production of petrochemical-grade aromatics from methane, which is nowadays offered for licensing.</p>
<p>In our quest for a novel catalytically active phase that enables efficient bromine looping, we have investigated the performance of various rare-earth oxides, including La2O3, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, Gd2O3, Tb2O3, and Dy2O3, in HBr oxidation.</p>
<p>Catalysts based on lanthanide metals have been widely applied in numerous reactions, but apart from CeO2, no member of this catalyst family has been investigated in HBr oxidation.</p>
<p>Initial catalytic tests were conducted using an oxygen-rich feed (O2:HBr=2), which favors the reoxidation of the catalyst.</p>
<p>Compared to CeO2, the highest rates of HBr oxidation in the low-temperature window (423-473K) were observed over EuOBr, substantially exceeding those of the benchmark CeO2 and TiO2 catalysts.</p>
<p>The performance of EuOBr remained unaltered upon temperature cycling, which simulates the likely spatial and temporal fluctuations in a reactor.</p>
<p>On the other hand, TiO2, which is the benchmark of the bromination-resistant catalysts, was less active compared to EuOBr.</p>
<p>Given the outstanding performance of EuOBr in HBr oxidation, the material was further evaluated in methane oxybromination (MOB), which is an alternative option that accomplishes continuous bromine looping by integrating HBr oxidation and methane functionalization in a single step.</p>
<p>The selectivity to CH3Br over EuOBr (85-65% at 63-3% single-pass methane conversion) substantially exceeded that of the benchmark (VO)2P2O7 (VPO) and CeO2 catalysts at comparable reaction rates in the broad range of conditions applied.</p>
<p>Moreover, EuOBr exhibited a low formation of carbon oxides (COx), yielding bromine and dibromomethane (CH2Br2) as the dominant byproducts, which can be further upgraded via bromination and reproportionation, respectively.</p>
<p>To study the potential impact of active phase dispersion, EuOBr was supported on three carriers: Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2 (9wt% Eu) yielding catalysts denoted as EuOBr/Al2O3, EuOBr/ZrO2, and EuOBr/SiO2, respectively.</p>
<p>The activities of EuOBr/Al2O3-t and EuOBr/ZrO2-t matched that of the supported systems in powder form and were stable for over 60h of operation under the harsh conditions with no detectable loss of europium.</p>

The document does not provide a direct comparison of sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. It focuses on the use of europium oxybromide catalysts for efficient bromine looping in natural gas valorization. The document highlights the benefits of using europium oxybromide catalysts for HBr oxidation and methane oxybromination, including their ability to enable low-temperature operation under stoichiometric feeds, high selectivity to CH3Br, and resistance to bromination. It also discusses the development of technical catalyst forms based on europium oxybromide supported on carriers like Al2O3 and ZrO2, which show robust performance under harsh conditions. However, the document does not contain information to directly compare sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in the context of ODHP to propylene production.

文献没有提供硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯过程中的直接比较。它专注于使用铕氧溴化物催化剂进行闭路溴循环的天然气增值的应用。文献强调了使用铕氧溴化物催化剂进行HBr氧化和甲烷氧溴化的好处，包括在低温下操作并保持化学计量比喂料的能力、对CH3Br的高选择性以及抵抗进一步溴化的特性。它还讨论了基于铕氧溴化物的催化剂的形式，这些催化剂支持在如Al2O3和ZrO2等载体上，显示出在恶劣条件下长达60小时的稳定性能，且铕元素没有检测到损失。然而，文献中没有包含直接比较硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢到丙烯生产过程中的信息。
