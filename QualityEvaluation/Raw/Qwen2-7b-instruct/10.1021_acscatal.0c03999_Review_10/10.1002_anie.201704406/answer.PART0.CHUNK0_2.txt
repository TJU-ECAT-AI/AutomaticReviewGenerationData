The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is not discussed in the provided literature. However, the literature does compare the effectiveness of europium oxybromide (EuOBr) with conventional oxidants in the bromine looping process for natural gas valorization. 

Europium oxybromide demonstrates superior performance in both HBr oxidation and methane oxybromination (MOB) compared to other materials. It enables low-temperature operation under a stoichiometric feed, which is challenging for existing systems. Additionally, EuOBr provides high selectivity to CH3Br in MOB, surpassing all previously reported catalysts. The literature also highlights the importance of carrier selection in enhancing the utilization of europium and maintaining catalyst performance.

The specific challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP, such as byproduct formation, are not addressed in this context. The focus is on the benefits of using europium oxybromide for bromine looping in natural gas valorization.

硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯中的有效性没有在提供的文献中进行讨论。然而，文献确实比较了铕氧溴化物（EuOBr）与传统氧化剂在溴循环过程中的性能，用于天然气价值化。

铕氧溴化物在氢溴酸氧化和甲烷氧溴化（MOB）方面表现出卓越性能，与现有的材料相比具有显著优势。它能够在低温下操作，并在等摩尔进料条件下实现，这为现有系统所面临的挑战。此外，EuOBr在MOB过程中对CH3Br的选择性非常高，超越了所有以前报道的催化剂。文献还强调了载体选择对于提高铕的利用效率和维持催化剂性能的重要性。

关于硫基氧化剂在ODHP中的具体挑战，如副产物形成，文献中没有涉及这一话题。关注点在于使用铕氧溴化物通过溴循环进行天然气价值化的益处。
