[1] "Catalyst X offers a broad range of possibilities to tune the redox and acid properties that are required to attain the desired activity and selectivity patterns in different types of hydrogen halide oxidation, or alkane and alkene oxyhalogenation, which is unparalleled by any other active phase."
[2] "Strong redox properties of ceria can lead to over-oxidation in these processes, which can be moderated by the degree of halogenation."
[3] "Alternative lanthanide-based catalysts, such as europium oxyhalides could overcome these issues, yet show lower activity than ceria."

Comparing the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, it is noted that ceria-based catalysts offer a broad range of possibilities to tune the redox and acid properties, enabling the attainment of desired activity and selectivity patterns in hydrogen halide oxidation and alkane/alkene oxyhalogenation. Strong redox properties of ceria can lead to over-oxidation, which can be mitigated by adjusting the degree of halogenation. Europium-based catalysts can address these issues, albeit with lower activity compared to ceria. Future research focuses on refining catalyst design and optimizing the ODHP process to improve propylene yield and minimize byproduct formation.

将不同硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯中的有效性进行比较，发现以铈为基础的催化剂提供了一系列调整还原性和酸性的可能性，使达到氢卤化物氧化或烷烃/烯烃氧卤化所需的期望活性和选择性模式成为可能。铈的强还原性可能导致过氧化，这可以通过调整卤化程度来缓解。铕基催化剂可以解决这些问题，但活性低于铈。未来的研究重点是改进催化剂设计和优化整个过程，以提高丙烯产率并减少副产物形成。
