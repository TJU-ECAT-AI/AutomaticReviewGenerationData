[1] "In the field of hydrogen halide oxidation, ceria-based catalysts offer an exciting potential for advances."
[2] "Cerium is the most abundant rare earth element, which is widely used in catalysis in the oxide form CeO2 (ceria)."
[3] "In particular, chlorine production through catalytic HCl oxidation (Deacon reaction) dates back to the 1870s."
[4] "Still, works discussing applications of CeO2 in these fields did not tackle this material as primary focus or were limited to review its use only in the oxidation of halogenated volatile organic compounds."
[5] "Considering that materials such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethanes (PU),and polycarbonates (PC) account for 57% of the overall chlorine production (75 Mton per year)."
[6] "Catalytic HCl oxidation remains the most energy efficient technology."
[7] "After many decades of improving the catalyst stability of the original copper-based catalysts that were originally devised in 1870, several hurdles still hampered the industrial application into todays times."
[8] "In-depth theoretical studies put forward the mechanism of this reaction, which involves the Cl activation in an oxygen vacancy (), followed by its transition on top of a Ce atom (*) and recombination with a neighboring Cl*, finally leading to desorption of molecular Cl2."
[9] "This is evidenced by the appearance of reflections attributed to CeCl3 species in the XRD patterns of catalysts exposed to feed mixtures with low O2:HCl ratios."
[10] "PGAA showed that chlorination of ceria is reversible, and correspondingly restoration of the activity in HCl oxidation is possible by modification of the O2:HCl feed ratios."
[11] "While the activity increased linearly with the Ce loading on Al2O3, CeO2/ZrO2 did not show an increase of activity above a Ce content of 710 wt.%."
[12] "Considering the link between activity and degree of chlorination, evidenced for bulk ceria (vide supra), operando PGAA was used to evaluate the different chlorine uptake of CeO2/ZrO2 and CeO2/Al2O3."
[13] "In comparison to the copper-based catalyst, 200 K higher temperature was necessary to reach the same conversion levels for IrO2 and RuO2, which showed mainly COx formation, attributed to their strong redox properties, while CeO2 exhibited three times higher activity and minimal COx selectivity."
[14] "This was attributed to moderated redox properties, while still preserving the ability to activate HCl."
[15] "Optimization of reaction conditions showed that increased temperature or contact time are beneficial for VCM selectivity but in parallel increase formation of unwanted 1,2-dichloroethene (DCE)."
[16] "On the other hand, HCl rich feeds suppressed COx and enhanced EDC formation, leaving the VCM selectivity unaltered."
[17] "This performance could be rationalized by the unique balance of mild redox and enhanced acid properties of EuOCl compared to CeO2 (Fig. 5e), which suppress over-oxidation and boost EDC dehydrochlorination."
[18] "Strategies to couple the excellent selectivity of EuOCl with the high activity of CeO2 were demonstrated by synthesis of homogeneous europium-cerium mixed oxides, reaching an optimal ratio of Eu:Ce = 0.4:0.6 (EuCeOx in Fig. 5d)."
[19] "This went in a new paragraph of the reaction, leading to possible hot-spot formation in the catalyst bed, results in a high probability for RuO2 to form volatile RuO4 species under oxidative conditions."
[20] "However, one option to better utilize the heat of reaction and allow operation at temperatures higher than 663 K, is to combine the ruthenium-based catalyst with CeO2/ZrO2, which requires higher temperature (Fig. 2b), but also exhibits improved stability under such conditions (Fig. 3d), in staged dual-catalyst bed reactors for adiabatic operation."

Comparison of Effectiveness of Different Sulfur-Based Oxidants in Propane Oxidative Dehydrogenation (ODHP):

1. Ceria-based catalysts offer potential for significant advancements in hydrogen halide oxidation, particularly in the context of polymer production and natural gas valorization. They are versatile in tuning redox and acid properties to achieve desired activity and selectivity in various oxidative processes.

2. Sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 are alternatives to conventional oxidants in the ODHP of propane to propylene. Their impact on propylene yield depends on their ability to efficiently convert propane to propylene without forming excessive byproducts.

3. Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants include specific byproduct formations, which can negatively impact the overall process efficiency and product purity. The formation of byproducts depends on the specific oxidant used and the reaction conditions.

Future Research Areas:

1. Improving catalyst design to optimize sulfur-based oxidants' performance in ODHP, focusing on enhancing propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation.

2. Optimizing the overall process parameters, including temperature, pressure, and reaction conditions, to maximize propylene yield and minimize unwanted byproducts.

3. Investigating the synergistic effects of combining sulfur-based oxidants with ceria or other catalysts to improve the ODHP process efficiency and product quality.

4. Developing advanced analytical techniques to monitor and control the reaction kinetics and product distribution in real-time, enabling more precise process control.

5. Conducting fundamental studies on the reaction mechanisms of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP, including the role of ceria and other catalysts in promoting the desired reactions and inhibiting unwanted side reactions.

6. Exploring the use of alternative sulfur-based oxidants or developing new catalysts that can selectively convert propane to propylene with higher efficiency and fewer byproducts.

7. Enhancing the understanding of the interaction between sulfur-based oxidants and the catalyst surface to design more durable and efficient catalysts for long-term industrial applications.

In summary, the effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants in the ODHP of propane to propylene depends on their ability to promote propylene formation while minimizing byproduct formation. Future research should focus on catalyst design optimization, process parameter tuning, and reaction mechanism understanding to improve the overall efficiency and sustainability of the ODHP process.
