<quotes>
[1] "Cerium is the most abundant rare earth element, which is widely used in catalysis in the oxide form CeO2 (ceria) [1]."
[2] "CeO2-based catalysts offer an exciting potential for advances in hydrogen halide recovery that ena- bles a high efficiency of halogen-based processes for activation of small molecules."
[3] "The inherent instability of cupric chloride systems under harsh reactions conditions remains one of the persisting challenges in the application of these technologies, yet extensive changes in the original catalyst formulation or disruptive decisions to opt for radical new routes are rarely made."
[4] "The manufacture of several polymers, in particular polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethanes (PU), and polycarbonates (PC) releases HCl as by-product (Fig. 2a), which has been typi- cally recycled via oxychlorination in the context of the balanced VCM process (Fig. 2a, left)."
[5] "After many decades of improving the catalyst stability of the original copper-based catalysts that were originally devised in 1870, several hurdles still hampered the industrial application into todays times."
[6] "These included (i) low single pass HCl conversion, (ii) loss of activity due to active phase volatilization, (iii) environmental concerns regarding alternative chromium-based materials, and (iv) corrosion issues due to unreacted HCl in presence of prod- uct H2O."
[7] "In 2012, Amrute et al. [6] first uncovered the high performance of bulk CeO2 in HCl oxidation."
[8] "The transition step is the rate determining step, and requires 2.15 eV (Fig. 2c)."
[9] "Notably, although energetically hindered by 3 eV, progressive subsurface chlorination still occurs at very low O2:HCl ratios due to vacancy diffusion."
[10] "In order to further improve the performance of ceria, investigations of Hf or Zr doped ceria indeed revealed increased activity of the resulting catalysts, while trivalent dopants were found to be detrimental."
[11] "While the activity increased linearly with the Ce loading on Al2O3, CeO2/ZrO2 did not show an increase of activity above a Ce content of 710 wt.% (Fig. 3a)."
[12] "Considering the link between activity and degree of chlorination, evidenced for bulk ceria (vide supra), operando PGAA was used to evaluate the different chlorine uptake of CeO2/ZrO2 and CeO2/Al2O3 (Fig. 3c)."
[13] "Therefore, CeO2/ZrO2 rendered as suitable candidate for upscaling, tested in form of shaped catalyst bodies in a pilot plant and showing stable HCl conversion over 700 h on stream (Fig. 3d)."
[14] "However, one option to better utilize the heat of reaction and allow operation at temperatures higher than 663 K, is to combine the ruthenium-based catalyst with CeO2/ZrO2, which requires higher temperature (Fig. 2b), but also exhibits improved stability under such conditions (Fig. 3d), in staged dual-catalyst bed reactors for adiabatic operation, as shown in Fig. 3e [20,21]."
[15] "In particular, CeO2/ZrO2 exhibited lower chlorination compared to CeO2/Al2O3 over the whole investigated range of conditions, in accordance with the higher activity of the former, further corroborating the importance of chlorination."
[16] "This strategy reduced the number of unit opera- tions by half, while preserving the same productivity, which significantly reduces capital and catalyst cost [6]."
[17] "To date, the catalyst in ethylene oxychlorination comprises cupric chloride (CuCl2) as the active phase, impregnated on a porous support such as alumina, and is promoted by numerous alkali, alkaline-earth, and rare-earth metals to reduce the copper loss and/or improve the activity and selectivity (Fig. 4a)."
[18] "In addition, CeO2 exhibited no structural (Fig. 4c), or morphological changes, and preserved stable performance during ethylene oxychlorination at typical reaction conditions [9]."
[19] "Optimization of reaction conditions (Fig. 4d) showed that increased temperature or contact time are beneficial for VCM selectivity but in parallel increase formation of unwanted 1,2-dichloroethene (DCE)."
[20] "This was attributed to moderated redox properties, while still preserving the ability to activate HCl [9]."
[21] "Therein CeO2 exhibited no structural (Fig. 4c), or morphological changes, and preserved stable performance during ethylene oxychlorination at typical reaction conditions [9]."
[22] "In addition, CeO2 exhibited no structural (Fig. 4c), or morphological changes, and preserved stable performance during ethylene oxychlorination at typical reaction conditions [9]."
[23] "Tuning the surface area of bulk ceria, which also affected the acidity, or engineering of CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides resulted in up to 25% VCM yield, higher than any previously reported sys- tem, which was attributed to enhanced acid properties of the materials, which promote dehydrochlorination of in-situ formed EDC to VCM [9]."
[24] "In ethylene oxychlorination, the catalyst surface contains CeOCl, while the bulk phase remains or evolves to CeO2, regardless of the starting materials CeCl3, CeOCl, or CeO2 [22]."
[25] "In addition, the CeO2(111) surface was found more active than the (100) surface due to stronger chlo- rination of the latter, while the selectivity patterns rendered comparable [22]."
[26] "This performance could be ration- alized by the unique balance of mild redox and enhanced acid properties of EuOCl compared to CeO2 (Fig. 5e), which suppress over-oxidation and boost EDC dehydrochlorination."
[27] "Notably, EDC for- mation requires a chlorinated vacancy and a Cl adsorbed on a Ce center, while EDC dehydrochlorination can, if EDC does not desorb, continue on the just created vacancy, leaving it chlorin- ated in the end and available for further ethylene activation."
[28] "To overcome these intrinsic limitations, other lanthanide materials were investigated, pos- sibly offering different redox and acid properties that still allow EDC formation and dehydrochlorination to VCM, while hinder- ing creation of empty vacancies that might lead to unwanted products [26]."
[29] "In particular, LaOCl was reported to exhibit a high VCM selectivity but low activity [2325], which limits its poten- tial for large-scale implementation [6]."
[30] "The activity in the oxychlorination and oxybromination reactions over these systems was compared to the catalysts reactivity in the oxida- tion of HX to molecular halogen, which were quantified based on the temperature at which 10% conversion of CH4 in oxyhal- ogenation, T10 CH4 oxyhalogenation, and of HX in HX oxidation, T10 HX oxidation, were achieved, respectively (Fig. 8a) [43]."
[31] "The rate of HCl oxidation was significantly higher in comparison to the rate of oxychlorination, which was in turn greater than the rate of CH2Cl2 and CH4 oxidation. From this activity order, it followed that in oxychlorination the chloromethanes are formed at a higher rate than they are consumed in the corresponding oxi- dation reactions, in good agreement with the relatively high selectivity to these products."
[32] "Furthermore, a higher production of dihalomethane (CH2X2) was observed in oxychlorination (selectivity  17%) compared to oxybromination (selectivi- ty  5%)."
[33] "This was attributed to the over-weakened redox properties of the catalyst, which shifts the operating window of oxychlorination to > 100 K higher temperatures compared to oxybromination, where side chloromethanes combustion reactions take place."
[34] "This was rationalized based on the ability of the car- rier to favor HBr adsorption, which resulted into a decreased oxidizing potential of the CeO2/MgO system, ultimately reduc- ing activity in side combustion reactions [50]."
[35] "In particular, CeO2 sup- ported on magnesium oxide (MgO) could achieve a combined selectivity to bromomethanes of 93% in CH4 oxybromination (Fig. 8e)."
[36] "This was elucidated based on the pronounced halogen coverage on the surface of the oxyhalide phase, which in the case of LaV0.5O2.75 is due to the excess of lanthanum compared to sto- chiometric LaVO4, thus generating patches of segregated LaOBr phase within a LaVO4 matrix, which suppresses side combus- tion reactions [51]."
[37] "Still, when its oxychloride counterpart (EuOCl) was assessed in CH4 oxychlorination, a much stronger propensity to COx for- mation (selectivity  22%) was observed, again related to the shifted operating window to high temperatures where chloro- methanes combustion is more prominent as observed for CeO2/MgO [47]."
[38] "This was attributed to the alkane ac- tivation pathway, which occurs in the gas-phase with evolved Br2 and Br• radicals, leaving a halogen-free surface that is prone towards cracking and combustion. On the contrary, alkane ox- ychlorination was shown to occur on a chlorine-rich surface,which results in the observed superior olefin selectivity [58]."

1. Ceria offers significant opportunities for bifunctional catalysis and process intensification due to its ability to combine oxychlorination and dehydrochlorination functions in one surface. However, its strong redox properties can lead to over-oxidation in these processes, which can be mitigated by adjusting the degree of halogenation. The limited stability of the ceria phase at low temperatures or low-to-moderate oxygen excess in the feed is another challenge, particularly in processes involving HBr recycling.

2. The inherent instability of cupric chloride systems under harsh reaction conditions presents challenges for their application, including low single-pass HCl conversion, loss of activity due to active phase volatilization, environmental concerns with alternative chromium-based materials, and corrosion issues due to unreacted HCl in the presence of product H2O.

3. The bulk CeO2 catalyst shows high performance in HCl oxidation, enabling high efficiency in halogen-based processes for activating small molecules. The transition step, requiring 2.15 eV, is rate-determining.

4. Progressive subsurface chlorination still occurs at very low O2:HCl ratios due to vacancy diffusion, despite being energetically hindered. This is evidenced by the appearance of CeCl3 species in XRD patterns of catalysts exposed to low O2:HCl ratios.

5. Doping ceria with Hf or Zr increases activity, while trivalent dopants are detrimental. The activity increases linearly with Ce loading on Al2O3, but CeO2/ZrO2 shows no increase above 710 wt.% Ce content.

6. CeO2/ZrO2 has lower chlorination compared to CeO2/Al2O3, correlating with its higher activity. This further confirms the importance of chlorination in improving catalyst performance.

7. Combining the ruthenium-based catalyst with CeO2/ZrO2 allows for better utilization of the heat of reaction and higher operation temperatures while maintaining the same productivity, reducing capital and catalyst costs.

8. The ethylene oxychlorination catalyst comprises cupric chloride as the active phase, impregnated on alumina, with alkali, alkaline-earth, and rare-earth metals promoting activity and selectivity.

9. CeO2 exhibits no structural or morphological changes during ethylene oxychlorination, preserving stable performance at typical reaction conditions.

10. Increased temperature or contact time enhances VCM selectivity in ethylene oxychlorination but also increases the formation of unwanted 1,2-dichloroethene (DCE).

11. The activity in ethylene oxychlorination correlates with the catalyst's ability to evolve molecular halogen, with a linear relationship between catalyst activity in HCl oxidation and CH4 consumption in oxychlorination.

12. The activity in ethylene oxybromination correlates weakly with the catalyst's ability to evolve Br2, and no dependence is found between the activation energies of the oxybromination and HBr oxidation reactions.

13. The oxyhalogenation of methane proceeds via a cascade reaction involving the catalytic oxidation of HX into X2, followed by its consecutive reaction with methane in the gas phase.

14. The formation of methyl halides in oxyhalogenation is correlated with the formation of methyl radicals, with stronger correlations observed in oxybromination compared to oxychlorination.

15. The oxyhalogenation of methane is influenced by non-catalytic pathways, leading to the formation of polyhalomethanes. The formation of COx is catalyst-dependent, with much more severe formation observed in oxybromination compared to oxychlorination.

16. The oxyhalogenation of ethane and propane can be achieved in a single step, producing ethylene and propylene, respectively, as a result of dehydrochlorination of intermediate alkyl chlorides.

17. Solid solutions of CeO2 and transition metal oxides (MOx) can be prepared to enhance HX adsorption, promoting surface reduction and reducing the formation of COx.

18. The use of lanthanum vanadates (LaVyOz) and lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) enables a combined halomethane selectivity of around 90% in oxychlorination and oxybromination, respectively, due to their pronounced halogen coverage on the surface.

19. Europium oxychloride (EuOCl) shows high activity in alkane oxyhalogenation but low selectivity to bromomethanes, possibly due to its shifted operating window towards higher temperatures.

20. The use of lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) in ethylene oxychlorination leads to a much stronger propensity to COx formation, possibly due to its high operating temperatures.

21. The oxyhalogenation of ethane and propane can be optimized by adjusting the catalyst design to enhance dehydrohalogenation properties and reduce over-oxidizing tendencies.

22. The use of lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) has been demonstrated as a highly efficient catalyst for alkane oxyhalogenation, achieving 97% olefin selectivity and 90% C2H4 yield in ethane oxychlorination, surpassing existing C2H4 generation routes.

23. The use of HBr as a halogen source mainly results in the formation of alkyl bromides or cracking and combustion products in the oxybromination of ethane and propane over ceria and europium oxyhalides, due to the alkane activation pathway occurring in the gas phase with evolved Br2 and Br• radicals.

24. The oxyhalogenation of ethane and propane can be further optimized by using solid solutions of transition metal oxides with ceria to enhance the dehydrochlorination properties and reduce over-oxidizing tendencies.

25. The use of europium oxyhalide (EuOX) in alkane oxyhalogenation can achieve up to 98% selectivity to halomethanes, surpassing any reported system to date, due to its balanced redox properties.

26. The oxyhalogenation of ethane and propane can be optimized by using lanthanum vanadates (LaVyOz) to enable a combined halomethane selectivity of ca. 90% in oxychlorination and oxybromination, respectively, due to the excess lanthanum compared to stoichiometric LaVO4, generating patches of segregated LaOBr phase within a LaVO4 matrix that suppresses side combustion reactions.

27. The use of ceria supports on magnesium oxide (MgO) can achieve a combined selectivity to bromomethanes of 93% in CH4 oxybromination, due to the ability of MgO to favor HBr adsorption, reducing the oxidizing potential of the CeO2/MgO system and decreasing side combustion reactions.

28. The use of ceria supports on magnesium oxide (MgO) results in a significant COx formation in ethylene oxychlorination, due to the over-weakened redox properties of the catalyst shifting the operating window of oxychlorination to > 100 K higher temperatures, where chloromethane combustion is more prominent.

29. The use of lanthanum vanadates (LaVyOz) for ethane oxybromination and lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) for ethane oxychlorination enables a combined halomethane selectivity of ca. 90%, due to the excess lanthanum compared to stoichiometric LaVO4 generating patches of segregated LaOBr phase within a LaVO4 matrix that suppresses side combustion reactions.

30. The use of europium oxyhalide (EuOX) in alkane oxyhalogenation can achieve up to 98% selectivity to halomethanes, surpassing any reported system to date, due to its balanced redox properties.

13. 乙烯氧氯化催化剂的活性与其在盐酸氧化中形成分子卤素的能力有关，该能力与甲烷在氧氯化中的消耗呈线性关系。

14. 乙烯氧溴化催化剂活性与形成溴2的能力相关较弱，且在氧溴化和HBr氧化反应之间未发现依赖关系。

[1] "In the field of hydrogen halide oxidation, ceria-based catalysts offer an exciting potential for advances."
[2] "Cerium is the most abundant rare earth element, which is widely used in catalysis in the oxide form CeO2 (ceria)."
[3] "In particular, chlorine production through catalytic HCl oxidation (Deacon reaction) dates back to the 1870s."
[4] "Still, works discussing applications of CeO2 in these fields did not tackle this material as primary focus or were limited to review its use only in the oxidation of halogenated volatile organic compounds."
[5] "Considering that materials such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethanes (PU),and polycarbonates (PC) account for 57% of the overall chlorine production (75 Mton per year)."
[6] "Catalytic HCl oxidation remains the most energy efficient technology."
[7] "After many decades of improving the catalyst stability of the original copper-based catalysts that were originally devised in 1870, several hurdles still hampered the industrial application into todays times."
[8] "In-depth theoretical studies put forward the mechanism of this reaction, which involves the Cl activation in an oxygen vacancy (), followed by its transition on top of a Ce atom (*) and recombination with a neighboring Cl*, finally leading to desorption of molecular Cl2."
[9] "This is evidenced by the appearance of reflections attributed to CeCl3 species in the XRD patterns of catalysts exposed to feed mixtures with low O2:HCl ratios."
[10] "PGAA showed that chlorination of ceria is reversible, and correspondingly restoration of the activity in HCl oxidation is possible by modification of the O2:HCl feed ratios."
[11] "While the activity increased linearly with the Ce loading on Al2O3, CeO2/ZrO2 did not show an increase of activity above a Ce content of 710 wt.%."
[12] "Considering the link between activity and degree of chlorination, evidenced for bulk ceria (vide supra), operando PGAA was used to evaluate the different chlorine uptake of CeO2/ZrO2 and CeO2/Al2O3."
[13] "In comparison to the copper-based catalyst, 200 K higher temperature was necessary to reach the same conversion levels for IrO2 and RuO2, which showed mainly COx formation, attributed to their strong redox properties, while CeO2 exhibited three times higher activity and minimal COx selectivity."
[14] "This was attributed to moderated redox properties, while still preserving the ability to activate HCl."
[15] "Optimization of reaction conditions showed that increased temperature or contact time are beneficial for VCM selectivity but in parallel increase formation of unwanted 1,2-dichloroethene (DCE)."
[16] "On the other hand, HCl rich feeds suppressed COx and enhanced EDC formation, leaving the VCM selectivity unaltered."
[17] "This performance could be rationalized by the unique balance of mild redox and enhanced acid properties of EuOCl compared to CeO2 (Fig. 5e), which suppress over-oxidation and boost EDC dehydrochlorination."
[18] "Strategies to couple the excellent selectivity of EuOCl with the high activity of CeO2 were demonstrated by synthesis of homogeneous europium-cerium mixed oxides, reaching an optimal ratio of Eu:Ce = 0.4:0.6 (EuCeOx in Fig. 5d)."
[19] "This went in a new paragraph of the reaction, leading to possible hot-spot formation in the catalyst bed, results in a high probability for RuO2 to form volatile RuO4 species under oxidative conditions."
[20] "However, one option to better utilize the heat of reaction and allow operation at temperatures higher than 663 K, is to combine the ruthenium-based catalyst with CeO2/ZrO2, which requires higher temperature (Fig. 2b), but also exhibits improved stability under such conditions (Fig. 3d), in staged dual-catalyst bed reactors for adiabatic operation."
