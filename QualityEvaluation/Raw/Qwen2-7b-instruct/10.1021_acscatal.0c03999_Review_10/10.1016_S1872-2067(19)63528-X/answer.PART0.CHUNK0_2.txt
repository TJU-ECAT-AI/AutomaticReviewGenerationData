[1] "Catalyst performance varies depending on the halogen used. For example, the use of bromine in the oxyhalogenation of alkanes results in higher selectivity to bromomethanes compared to chlorine."
[2] "The activity in the oxychlorination and oxybromination reactions over these systems was compared to the catalysts reactivity in the oxidation of HX to molecular halogen."
[3] "The differences observed were mainly attributed to the proposed distinct rate determining steps, the oxidation of HCl in oxychlorination and the reaction of CH4 with Br2 in oxybromination."
[4] "In order to provide insights into this mechanism, CH4 oxyhalogenation was investigated over a representative catalyst (Pd/SiO2) by oper- ando photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy."
[5] "The rate of HCl oxidation was significantly higher in comparison to the rate of oxychlorination, which was in turn greater than the rate of CH2Cl2 and CH4 oxidation."
[6] "The use of HBr as halogen source mainly resulted in the formation of alkyl bromides, or formation of cracking and combustion products in the oxybromination of ethane and propane over CeO2 and Eu- OBr."

1. The use of bromine in the oxyhalogenation of alkanes leads to higher selectivity for bromomethanes compared to chlorine.
2. The activity of catalysts in oxychlorination and oxybromination was evaluated against their ability to oxidize HX to molecular halogen.
3. The differences in activity between oxychlorination and oxybromination were explained by distinct rate-determining steps in each process.
4. Insights into the oxyhalogenation mechanism were gained by studying a representative catalyst (Pd/SiO2) using operando photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy.
5. The rate of HCl oxidation was notably higher than in oxychlorination, which in turn was greater than the rates of CH2Cl2 and CH4 oxidation.
6. Using HBr as a halogen source mainly led to the formation of alkyl bromides or cracking and combustion products in the oxybromination of ethane and propane.
