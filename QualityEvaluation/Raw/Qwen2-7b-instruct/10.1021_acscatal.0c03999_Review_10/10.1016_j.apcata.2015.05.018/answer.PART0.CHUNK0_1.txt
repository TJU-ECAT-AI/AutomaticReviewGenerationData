The comparative analysis reveals that sulfur-based oxidants such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) have not been extensively studied in the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The document focuses on the use of molecular chlorine as an oxidizing agent. Molecular chlorine is found to be the most advantageous oxidizing agent due to its thermodynamic properties, which simplify the waste-heat utilization process compared to using molecular oxygen. The chlorination of propane leads to the formation of monoclorides, which are easily dechlorinated to produce propylene. The total enthalpy of the reaction is 60.34 kJ/mol, making it energetically favorable. The study aims to investigate the effectiveness of ruthenium oxychloride-based catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using molecular chlorine. Future research should concentrate on optimizing catalyst design and process conditions to enhance propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation.

文档中未详细比较硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯过程中的效果。研究主要关注氯分子作为氧化剂的应用。氯分子因其热力学性质而被视为最有利的氧化剂，这使得利用氧气进行废热利用的过程更为简便，相比使用氧分子而言。氯化丙烷会形成单氯代物，这些单氯代物易于去氯化生成丙烯。反应的总焓为60.34 kJ/mol，使其成为有利的能量反应。研究旨在探讨基于钌酸盐的催化剂在使用氯分子进行丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性。未来的研究应集中在优化催化剂设计和工艺条件上，以提高丙烯产量，同时减少副产品的形成。
