Comparing the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, the literature suggests that molecular chlorine stands out as the most advantageous oxidant according to thermodynamic calculations. The use of sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 presents specific challenges. For instance, H2S requires high temperatures for effective dehydrogenation, which can lead to coke deposition and reduced catalyst lifetime. S2 can potentially lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts such as sulfur compounds, which may require additional purification steps. SO2, while capable of dehydrogenating propane, might not offer the same efficiency or selectivity as molecular chlorine. 

The key challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants include byproduct formation, the requirement for higher operating temperatures, and the complexity in waste heat utilization. For sulfur-based oxidants to be more effective, future research could focus on developing catalysts that enhance the selectivity towards propylene, reducing the formation of byproducts, and improving the energy efficiency of the process. Additionally, exploring ways to recycle or utilize the sulfur compounds formed could also be beneficial.

For conventional oxidants, the literature indicates that the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane faces limitations in achieving high propylene yields, often not exceeding 35%. Achieving higher yields could involve optimizing the catalyst design, reaction conditions, and possibly combining multiple oxidants to leverage their individual strengths. The PtH3PMo12O40 catalyst, for example, demonstrated a high selectivity towards propylene at 94-96% under certain conditions, which is a significant improvement compared to the average yields achieved with conventional oxidants.

Ruthenium-based catalysts show promise in various reactions involving chlorine or its derivatives, including the oxychlorination of methane and ethane. This suggests that similar catalysts could be adapted for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by molecular chlorine, potentially offering higher efficiency and selectivity. The thermodynamic calculations by Pasternak and Vadekar support the use of halogens as mild oxidants for dehydrogenation processes, highlighting the potential of molecular chlorine as a cost-effective and efficient oxidant in this context.

The Deacon reaction, which involves the oxidation of HCl to regenerate Cl2, plays a crucial role in processes utilizing halogen-based oxidants. This reaction is thermodynamically challenging, necessitating the development of catalysts capable of performing the Deacon reaction efficiently at lower temperatures. Recent advancements suggest that a RuO2/TiO2 catalyst enables the execution of the Deacon reaction at temperatures below 300°C, indicating a step forward in overcoming this challenge. Future research in this area could aim to further optimize catalyst properties, enhance the reaction kinetics, and improve the overall economics of the process by addressing the Deacon reaction's limitations.

在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯过程中，与传统氧化剂相比，分子氯作为最有利的氧化剂，根据热力学计算得出结论。硫基氧化剂如H2S、S2和SO2在应用时面临特定挑战。例如，H2S需要高温才能有效进行脱氢，这可能导致焦炭沉积并缩短催化剂寿命。S2可能导致形成不希望的副产品，如硫化合物，可能需要额外的净化步骤。SO2虽然能够脱氢丙烷，但其效率或选择性可能不如分子氯高。

与硫基氧化剂相关的关键挑战包括形成副产品、需要更高的操作温度以及在废热利用上的复杂性。为了使硫基氧化剂更有效，未来研究可以集中在开发增强丙烯选择性、减少副产品形成、提高过程能效的催化剂上。此外，探索回收或利用形成的硫化合物也可能是有益的。

对于传统氧化剂而言，文献表明丙烷氧化脱氢过程在实现高丙烯产率方面存在局限，通常不超过35%。提高产率可通过优化催化剂设计、反应条件或结合多种氧化剂来实现。PtH3PMo12O40催化剂，在约20%转化率下显示出高达94-96%的选择性，这一指标显著优于使用传统氧化剂时的平均产率。

钌基催化剂在涉及氯及其衍生物的各种反应中表现出色，包括甲烷和乙烷的氧氯化。这表明类似的催化剂可以适应通过分子氯进行的丙烷氧化脱氢，可能提供更高的效率和选择性。Pasternak和Vadekar的热力学计算支持将卤素用作脱氢过程中的温和氧化剂，这凸显了分子氯作为成本效益高且高效氧化剂在这一背景下的潜力。

Deacon反应涉及到HCl的氧化再生Cl2，对于使用卤素基氧化剂的过程至关重要。这一反应从热力学角度看具有挑战性，需要开发能够在较低温度下高效执行Deacon反应的催化剂。最近的研究表明，RuO2/TiO2催化剂允许在低于300°C的温度下执行Deacon反应，标志着克服这一挑战的一个进步。未来研究领域可以集中于进一步优化催化剂性能、提高反应动力学和通过解决Deacon反应的局限性来改善过程的整体经济性。
