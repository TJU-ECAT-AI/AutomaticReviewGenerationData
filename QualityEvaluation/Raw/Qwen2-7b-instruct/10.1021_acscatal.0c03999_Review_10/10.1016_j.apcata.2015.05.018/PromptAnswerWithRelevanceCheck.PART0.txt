Comparing the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the sulfur-based oxidants typically lead to lower propylene yields due to the formation of byproducts like hydrogen sulfide and elemental sulfur. For example, sulfur-based oxidants might produce hydrogen sulfide, which could potentially interfere with the catalyst's performance and reduce the yield of propylene. On the other hand, conventional oxidants like molecular oxygen can produce water as a byproduct, which might be easier to manage in terms of waste heat utilization compared to sulfur-based oxidants.

The specific challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants include the formation of byproducts that can poison downstream processes, such as the formation of elemental sulfur and hydrogen sulfide. Elemental sulfur can adhere to catalyst surfaces, leading to deactivation. Hydrogen sulfide can be corrosive and potentially toxic, affecting equipment integrity and worker safety.

Key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process involve developing sulfur-resistant catalysts, improving sulfur removal technologies, and enhancing the selectivity of the process to maximize propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation. Additionally, studies could focus on the development of novel catalysts that can efficiently utilize sulfur-based oxidants without the negative side effects, potentially by incorporating sulfur tolerance into the catalyst structure or by employing advanced sulfur management strategies.

The total enthalpy of the reaction between propane and molecular chlorine is 60.34 kJ/mol, indicating that the process is endothermic, unlike the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by molecular oxygen, which is exothermic.

在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯的过程中，与传统氧化剂相比，基于硫的氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）导致丙烯产量较低，主要是因为它们会导致副产品的形成，如硫化氢和单质硫。例如，基于硫的氧化剂可能会产生硫化氢，这可能会影响催化剂性能并降低丙烯产量。相比之下，传统的氧化剂如分子氧会产生水作为副产品，从热能利用的角度来看，这可能比基于硫的氧化剂更容易管理。

基于硫的氧化剂所面临的特定挑战包括形成可能破坏下游过程的副产品，如单质硫和硫化氢。单质硫可以粘附到催化剂表面，导致活性丧失。硫化氢可能是腐蚀性的，并且具有潜在毒性，影响设备完整性以及工人安全。

未来研究的关键领域涉及开发抗硫催化剂、改进硫去除技术以及优化整个过程以最大化丙烯产量并最小化副产品的形成。此外，研究还可以集中在开发能够高效利用基于硫的氧化剂而无需负面影响的新型催化剂上，可能通过将硫耐受性整合到催化剂结构中或采用先进的硫管理策略来实现。

反应丙烷和分子氯之间的总热能为60.34 kJ/mol，表明该过程是吸热的，不同于由分子氧进行的丙烷氧化脱氢，后者是放热的。

The comparative analysis reveals that sulfur-based oxidants such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) have not been extensively studied in the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The document focuses on the use of molecular chlorine as an oxidizing agent. Molecular chlorine is found to be the most advantageous oxidizing agent due to its thermodynamic properties, which simplify the waste-heat utilization process compared to using molecular oxygen. The chlorination of propane leads to the formation of monoclorides, which are easily dechlorinated to produce propylene. The total enthalpy of the reaction is 60.34 kJ/mol, making it energetically favorable. The study aims to investigate the effectiveness of ruthenium oxychloride-based catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using molecular chlorine. Future research should concentrate on optimizing catalyst design and process conditions to enhance propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation.

文档中未详细比较硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯过程中的效果。研究主要关注氯分子作为氧化剂的应用。氯分子因其热力学性质而被视为最有利的氧化剂，这使得利用氧气进行废热利用的过程更为简便，相比使用氧分子而言。氯化丙烷会形成单氯代物，这些单氯代物易于去氯化生成丙烯。反应的总焓为60.34 kJ/mol，使其成为有利的能量反应。研究旨在探讨基于钌酸盐的催化剂在使用氯分子进行丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性。未来的研究应集中在优化催化剂设计和工艺条件上，以提高丙烯产量，同时减少副产品的形成。

Comparing the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, the literature suggests that molecular chlorine stands out as the most advantageous oxidant according to thermodynamic calculations. The use of sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 presents specific challenges. For instance, H2S requires high temperatures for effective dehydrogenation, which can lead to coke deposition and reduced catalyst lifetime. S2 can potentially lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts such as sulfur compounds, which may require additional purification steps. SO2, while capable of dehydrogenating propane, might not offer the same efficiency or selectivity as molecular chlorine. 

The key challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants include byproduct formation, the requirement for higher operating temperatures, and the complexity in waste heat utilization. For sulfur-based oxidants to be more effective, future research could focus on developing catalysts that enhance the selectivity towards propylene, reducing the formation of byproducts, and improving the energy efficiency of the process. Additionally, exploring ways to recycle or utilize the sulfur compounds formed could also be beneficial.

For conventional oxidants, the literature indicates that the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane faces limitations in achieving high propylene yields, often not exceeding 35%. Achieving higher yields could involve optimizing the catalyst design, reaction conditions, and possibly combining multiple oxidants to leverage their individual strengths. The PtH3PMo12O40 catalyst, for example, demonstrated a high selectivity towards propylene at 94-96% under certain conditions, which is a significant improvement compared to the average yields achieved with conventional oxidants.

Ruthenium-based catalysts show promise in various reactions involving chlorine or its derivatives, including the oxychlorination of methane and ethane. This suggests that similar catalysts could be adapted for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by molecular chlorine, potentially offering higher efficiency and selectivity. The thermodynamic calculations by Pasternak and Vadekar support the use of halogens as mild oxidants for dehydrogenation processes, highlighting the potential of molecular chlorine as a cost-effective and efficient oxidant in this context.

The Deacon reaction, which involves the oxidation of HCl to regenerate Cl2, plays a crucial role in processes utilizing halogen-based oxidants. This reaction is thermodynamically challenging, necessitating the development of catalysts capable of performing the Deacon reaction efficiently at lower temperatures. Recent advancements suggest that a RuO2/TiO2 catalyst enables the execution of the Deacon reaction at temperatures below 300°C, indicating a step forward in overcoming this challenge. Future research in this area could aim to further optimize catalyst properties, enhance the reaction kinetics, and improve the overall economics of the process by addressing the Deacon reaction's limitations.

在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯过程中，与传统氧化剂相比，分子氯作为最有利的氧化剂，根据热力学计算得出结论。硫基氧化剂如H2S、S2和SO2在应用时面临特定挑战。例如，H2S需要高温才能有效进行脱氢，这可能导致焦炭沉积并缩短催化剂寿命。S2可能导致形成不希望的副产品，如硫化合物，可能需要额外的净化步骤。SO2虽然能够脱氢丙烷，但其效率或选择性可能不如分子氯高。

与硫基氧化剂相关的关键挑战包括形成副产品、需要更高的操作温度以及在废热利用上的复杂性。为了使硫基氧化剂更有效，未来研究可以集中在开发增强丙烯选择性、减少副产品形成、提高过程能效的催化剂上。此外，探索回收或利用形成的硫化合物也可能是有益的。

对于传统氧化剂而言，文献表明丙烷氧化脱氢过程在实现高丙烯产率方面存在局限，通常不超过35%。提高产率可通过优化催化剂设计、反应条件或结合多种氧化剂来实现。PtH3PMo12O40催化剂，在约20%转化率下显示出高达94-96%的选择性，这一指标显著优于使用传统氧化剂时的平均产率。

钌基催化剂在涉及氯及其衍生物的各种反应中表现出色，包括甲烷和乙烷的氧氯化。这表明类似的催化剂可以适应通过分子氯进行的丙烷氧化脱氢，可能提供更高的效率和选择性。Pasternak和Vadekar的热力学计算支持将卤素用作脱氢过程中的温和氧化剂，这凸显了分子氯作为成本效益高且高效氧化剂在这一背景下的潜力。

Deacon反应涉及到HCl的氧化再生Cl2，对于使用卤素基氧化剂的过程至关重要。这一反应从热力学角度看具有挑战性，需要开发能够在较低温度下高效执行Deacon反应的催化剂。最近的研究表明，RuO2/TiO2催化剂允许在低于300°C的温度下执行Deacon反应，标志着克服这一挑战的一个进步。未来研究领域可以集中于进一步优化催化剂性能、提高反应动力学和通过解决Deacon反应的局限性来改善过程的整体经济性。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using molecular chlorine was studied in the literature. This method uses high temperatures to increase the olefin equilibrium concentration, but it also produces undesired byproducts such as methyl acetylene, which can poison polymerization catalysts in further polypropylene production. The use of halogens for dehydrogenation has been proposed for over 40 years based on thermodynamic calculations, with molecular chlorine identified as the most advantageous oxidizing agent. The reaction with chlorine results in the formation of HCl, which is proposed to be oxidized back to Cl2 through the Deacon reaction. Monochlorides of propane are easily dechlorinated to form propylene.
