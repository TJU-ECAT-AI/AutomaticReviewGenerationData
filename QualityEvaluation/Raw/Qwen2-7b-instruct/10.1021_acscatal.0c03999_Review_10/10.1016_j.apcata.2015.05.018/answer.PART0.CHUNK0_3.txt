The study aimed to investigate the use of ruthenium oxychloride catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by molecular chlorine. The Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared via the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] demonstrated the highest catalytic activity. At 400°C, the catalyst achieved 95% selectivity towards propylene with 50% propane conversion and complete chlorine conversion. Ruthenium oxychloride was identified as the active component of the catalyst. The formation of HCl was proposed to undergo the Deacon reaction by being oxidized by oxygen back to Cl2. Ruthenium catalysts have been shown to perform well in other reactions involving chlorine or its derivatives, including the oxychlorination of methane and ethane.

研究旨在研究使用钌氧氯化物催化剂在分子氯气氧化脱氢丙烷中的应用。通过浸渍水合氯酸钾溶液制备的Ru/TiO2催化剂显示出最高的催化活性。在400°C下，该催化剂实现了95%的丙烯选择性，丙烷转化率为50%，氯气完全转化。钌氧氯化物被确认为催化剂的活性成分。形成的HCl被提议进行Deacon反应，即由氧气氧化回Cl2。含有钌的催化剂在涉及氯或其衍生物的其他反应中表现出良好的性能，包括甲烷和乙烷的氧氯化。
