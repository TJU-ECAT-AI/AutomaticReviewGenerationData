Comparing the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the sulfur-based oxidants typically lead to lower propylene yields due to the formation of byproducts like hydrogen sulfide and elemental sulfur. For example, sulfur-based oxidants might produce hydrogen sulfide, which could potentially interfere with the catalyst's performance and reduce the yield of propylene. On the other hand, conventional oxidants like molecular oxygen can produce water as a byproduct, which might be easier to manage in terms of waste heat utilization compared to sulfur-based oxidants.

The specific challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants include the formation of byproducts that can poison downstream processes, such as the formation of elemental sulfur and hydrogen sulfide. Elemental sulfur can adhere to catalyst surfaces, leading to deactivation. Hydrogen sulfide can be corrosive and potentially toxic, affecting equipment integrity and worker safety.

Key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process involve developing sulfur-resistant catalysts, improving sulfur removal technologies, and enhancing the selectivity of the process to maximize propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation. Additionally, studies could focus on the development of novel catalysts that can efficiently utilize sulfur-based oxidants without the negative side effects, potentially by incorporating sulfur tolerance into the catalyst structure or by employing advanced sulfur management strategies.

The total enthalpy of the reaction between propane and molecular chlorine is 60.34 kJ/mol, indicating that the process is endothermic, unlike the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by molecular oxygen, which is exothermic.

在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯的过程中，与传统氧化剂相比，基于硫的氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）导致丙烯产量较低，主要是因为它们会导致副产品的形成，如硫化氢和单质硫。例如，基于硫的氧化剂可能会产生硫化氢，这可能会影响催化剂性能并降低丙烯产量。相比之下，传统的氧化剂如分子氧会产生水作为副产品，从热能利用的角度来看，这可能比基于硫的氧化剂更容易管理。

基于硫的氧化剂所面临的特定挑战包括形成可能破坏下游过程的副产品，如单质硫和硫化氢。单质硫可以粘附到催化剂表面，导致活性丧失。硫化氢可能是腐蚀性的，并且具有潜在毒性，影响设备完整性以及工人安全。

未来研究的关键领域涉及开发抗硫催化剂、改进硫去除技术以及优化整个过程以最大化丙烯产量并最小化副产品的形成。此外，研究还可以集中在开发能够高效利用基于硫的氧化剂而无需负面影响的新型催化剂上，可能通过将硫耐受性整合到催化剂结构中或采用先进的硫管理策略来实现。

反应丙烷和分子氯之间的总热能为60.34 kJ/mol，表明该过程是吸热的，不同于由分子氧进行的丙烷氧化脱氢，后者是放热的。
