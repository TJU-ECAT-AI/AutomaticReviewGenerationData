The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using molecular chlorine was studied in the literature. This method uses high temperatures to increase the olefin equilibrium concentration, but it also produces undesired byproducts such as methyl acetylene, which can poison polymerization catalysts in further polypropylene production. The use of halogens for dehydrogenation has been proposed for over 40 years based on thermodynamic calculations, with molecular chlorine identified as the most advantageous oxidizing agent. The reaction with chlorine results in the formation of HCl, which is proposed to be oxidized back to Cl2 through the Deacon reaction. Monochlorides of propane are easily dechlorinated to form propylene. The K4Ru2OCl10/TiO2 catalyst demonstrated higher activity in the Deacon reaction compared to RuO2, surpassing known catalysts for activity and selectivity in the oxychlorination of ethane and methane.

文献中研究了使用分子氯进行丙烷氧化脱氢的方法。这种方法使用高温来提高烯烃平衡浓度，但也会产生如甲乙炔这样的副产品，这可能会毒害进一步聚丙烯生产的催化剂。基于热力学计算，使用卤素进行脱氢的提议已经存在超过40年，而根据这些计算，分子氯被确定为最有利的氧化剂。与氯反应会形成HCl，它被提议通过Deacon反应还原回Cl2。丙烷的单氯化物很容易被氯化氢分解成丙烯。K4Ru2OCl10/TiO2催化剂在Deacon反应中的活性比RuO2更高，并且在乙烯和甲烷的氧氯化反应中，其活性和选择性超过了已知的所有催化剂。
