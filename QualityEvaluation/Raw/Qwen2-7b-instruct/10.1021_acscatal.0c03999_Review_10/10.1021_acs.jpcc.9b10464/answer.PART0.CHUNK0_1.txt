<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Different sulfur-based oxidants were compared for their effectiveness in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfur (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were considered as oxidants. Propylene yield was used as a critical measure for evaluating performance. Byproducts formed during the ODHP process were also analyzed. Each oxidant presented specific challenges, particularly concerning byproduct formation. Future studies focus on enhancing catalyst design and optimizing the overall process.
