1. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 are commonly used. These oxidants can produce byproducts, affecting propylene selectivity and yield.
2. Conventional oxidants, such as air or oxygen, are also applied in ODHP processes. They generally yield less propylene than sulfur-based oxidants due to their greater reactivity with propane.
3. Key difficulties with sulfur-based oxidants involve their toxicity and environmental impacts, requiring more research into safer alternatives.
4. Future studies should concentrate on enhancing catalyst design, increasing energy efficiency, and minimizing byproduct production.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯的过程中，硫基氧化剂如H2S、S2和SO2被广泛使用。这些氧化剂可能会产生副产品，影响丙烯的选择性和产率。
2. 常规氧化剂，如空气或氧气，也被应用于ODHP过程。它们通常导致丙烯产量较低，因为它们与丙烷的反应性更强。
3. 硫基氧化剂的主要挑战包括其毒性及环境问题，需要进一步研究更安全的替代品。
4. 未来的研究方向应集中在催化剂设计的优化、提高能效以及减少副产品生成上。
