[1] "All chromium was present as highly dispersed surface chromate species, and the amount of Cr sites (evaluated in terms of their behaviour as Lewis acid centres towards NH3) was found linearly proportional to the Cr loading."
[2] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."
[3] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."
[4] "The results of the characterization activity reported above (section 3.2) indicated that the speciation of Cr can be considered equivalent for all catalysts."
[5] "The data can be straightforwardly divided in two groups. One is constituted by the spectra of the catalysts used in direct dehydrogenation and in ODH with CO2 as oxidant (curves a and b):both spectra have the edge (evaluated at the maximum of the derivative curve) at 6002 eV, accompanied by an intense and broad pre-edge peak centred around 5996 eV, and by two weak pre-edge peaks at 5988 and 5990 eV."
[6] "The spectrum of the catalyst used for ODH with O2+CO2 as oxidant was characterized, in the white-line region, by a weak, ill resolved doublet at 6008 and 6010 eV, which can result from multiple-scattering contributions of Cr2O3-like particles."

1. Chromium was present as surface chromate species, with the number of Cr sites linearly proportional to the Cr loading. This indicates that higher Cr loading led to more active sites for catalysis. The amount of mesopores decreased with higher Cr content, but this did not hinder the catalytic performance. All catalysts showed stability against irreversible deactivation, achieving high propene yields of up to 40%.

2. The data showed that the oxidation state of Cr sites was +2 when using CO2 as an oxidant in ODH, while it was +3 when using O2. This suggests that the difference in oxidation state might influence the selectivity in propylene and ethene formation, depending on the oxidant used.

3. Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design to enhance propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation. This includes developing more efficient oxidants, improving catalyst stability, and understanding the detailed mechanisms of chromium speciation and its impact on the reaction pathways.

1. 铬以表面铬酸盐物种的形式存在，Cr点的数量与Cr负载成线性关系。这意味着更高的Cr负载导致更多的活性位点。随着Cr含量的增加，介孔的数量减少，但这并未妨碍催化剂的性能。所有催化剂均表现出对不可逆失活的稳定性，并且可以获得高达40%的丙烯产率。

2. 数据表明，在使用CO2作为氧化剂进行ODH时，Cr位点的氧化状态为+2，而在使用O2时，其氧化状态为+3。这表明氧化剂的不同可能会在丙烯和乙烷选择性上产生影响。

3. 未来的研究应集中在优化催化剂设计以提高丙烯产率并减少副产品的形成。这包括开发更高效的氧化剂，改进催化剂稳定性以及理解Cr物种详细机制及其对反应途径的影响。
