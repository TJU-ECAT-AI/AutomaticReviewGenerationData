[1] "All chromium was present as highly dispersed surface chromate species, and the amount of Cr sites (evaluated in terms of their behaviour as Lewis acid centres towards NH3) was found linearly proportional to the Cr loading."
[2] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."
[3] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."
[4] "The results of the characterization activity reported above (section 3.2) indicated that the speciation of Cr can be considered equivalent for all catalysts."
[5] "The data can be straightforwardly divided in two groups. One is constituted by the spectra of the catalysts used in direct dehydrogenation and in ODH with CO2 as oxidant (curves a and b):both spectra have the edge (evaluated at the maximum of the derivative curve) at 6002 eV, accompanied by an intense and broad pre-edge peak centred around 5996 eV, and by two weak pre-edge peaks at 5988 and 5990 eV."
[6] "The spectrum of the catalyst used for ODH with O2+CO2 as oxidant was characterized, in the white-line region, by a weak, ill resolved doublet at 6008 and 6010 eV, which can result from multiple-scattering contributions of Cr2O3-like particles."

1. Chromium was present as surface chromate species, with the number of Cr sites linearly proportional to the Cr loading. This indicates that higher Cr loading led to more active sites for catalysis. The amount of mesopores decreased with higher Cr content, but this did not hinder the catalytic performance. All catalysts showed stability against irreversible deactivation, achieving high propene yields of up to 40%.

2. The data showed that the oxidation state of Cr sites was +2 when using CO2 as an oxidant in ODH, while it was +3 when using O2. This suggests that the difference in oxidation state might influence the selectivity in propylene and ethene formation, depending on the oxidant used.

3. Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design to enhance propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation. This includes developing more efficient oxidants, improving catalyst stability, and understanding the detailed mechanisms of chromium speciation and its impact on the reaction pathways.

1. 铬以表面铬酸盐物种的形式存在，Cr点的数量与Cr负载成线性关系。这意味着更高的Cr负载导致更多的活性位点。随着Cr含量的增加，介孔的数量减少，但这并未妨碍催化剂的性能。所有催化剂均表现出对不可逆失活的稳定性，并且可以获得高达40%的丙烯产率。

2. 数据表明，在使用CO2作为氧化剂进行ODH时，Cr位点的氧化状态为+2，而在使用O2时，其氧化状态为+3。这表明氧化剂的不同可能会在丙烯和乙烷选择性上产生影响。

3. 未来的研究应集中在优化催化剂设计以提高丙烯产率并减少副产品的形成。这包括开发更高效的氧化剂，改进催化剂稳定性以及理解Cr物种详细机制及其对反应途径的影响。

[1] "Among the heterogeneous catalysts tested in processes involving CO2 as oxidant, materials based on chromium supported on silica exhibited the most promising performances."
[2] "However, it must be considered that parallel reactions also contributed to C3H8 conversion. Actually,some H2 (< 0.5 mol%) was found among the products when CO2 alone was used as oxidant, likely resulting for the occurrence to some extent of both propane direct dehydrogenation and water gas shift reaction."
[3] "Moreover, the results of the characterization activity reported above (section 3.2) indicated that the speciation of Cr can be considered equivalent for all catalysts."
[4] "The data can be straightforwardly divided in two groups. One is constituted by the spectra of the catalysts used in direct dehydrogenation and in ODH with CO2 as oxidant (curves a and b):both spectra have the edge (evaluated at the maximum of the derivative curve) at 6002 eV, accompanied by an intense and broad pre-edge peak centred around 5996 eV, and by two weak pre-edge peaks at 5988 and 5990 eV. All these signals witness for the presence of Cr2+ species, as previously discussed for 0.5-Cr/DHS reduced in CO (Fig. 4A, curve b)."
[5] "Conversely, the spectra of the catalyst used for ODH with O2 or O2+CO2 as oxidant (curves c and d) exhibited a double edge at higher energy (5999 and 6003 eV) and two weak pre-edge peaks 5990 and 5993 eV. These three features appeared very similar to those present in the spectrum of Cr2O3 reference compound."

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) in ODHP is not discussed in the literature. The document focuses on the use of CO2 and O2 as oxidants. The literature does not compare sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in terms of propylene yield, byproduct formation, or challenges associated with each oxidant. It primarily discusses the impact of CO2 and O2 on propylene yield, catalyst stability, and the oxidation state of chromium species during the reaction. Future research directions include tuning the O2/CO2 ratio to obtain a desired olefin mixture composition and investigating the possibility of improving catalyst design to enhance propylene yield and selectivity.

硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯中的效果未在文献中进行比较。文献主要关注二氧化碳和氧气作为氧化剂的作用，没有将硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂进行比较，讨论其丙烯产率、副产物形成以及每种氧化剂的挑战。文献主要探讨了使用二氧化碳和氧气对丙烯产率、催化剂稳定性以及反应过程中铬物种的氧化状态的影响。未来的研究方向包括调整氧气与二氧化碳的比例以获得所需的烯烃混合物组成，并研究改进催化剂设计以提高丙烯产率和选择性的问题。

[1] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."
[2] "In all cases the only chromium species found were surface chromates (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy), accompanied by Brnsted acid centres (infra-red spectra of adsorbed NH3)."
[3] "Noticeably, no irreversible deactivation occurred, independently on the dehydrogenation conditions, as indicated by the overlapping of the propane conversion curves obtained for subsequent catalytic runs."
[4] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."
[5] "The most important result is represented by the yield in the two olefins resulting from ODH in the presence of CO2 as oxidant (panel A, curve b): the initial C3H6 yield was of ca. 47% (see also Table 2 and related comment), and remained as high as ca. 40% after 1000 min of reaction."
[6] "However, even higher C3H8 conversion and catalyst stability were attained using the CO2+O2 mixture (curve d)."

Comparing sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the literature does not provide a direct comparison. However, it does highlight the effectiveness of CO2 as an oxidant, achieving high propene yields of up to 40% over a 1000-minute reaction period, which is comparable to performances reported for VOx/SiO2 catalysts. This suggests that CO2 could be a viable alternative to conventional oxidants like O2, especially considering the energy efficiency benefits of using an endothermic process like ODHP. The specific challenges associated with each oxidant, including byproduct formation, are not detailed in the provided literature, but the focus on CO2 indicates its potential advantages in terms of yield and stability. Future research directions could involve optimizing catalyst design to enhance selectivity towards propene, particularly when using O2 as an oxidant, given the potential differences in chromium oxidation state noted in the XANES measurements.

将硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2、SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）至丙烯过程中的性能进行比较，文献中并未提供直接对比。然而，它确实强调了二氧化碳作为氧化剂的有效性，在长达1000分钟的反应期间，丙烯的初始产率高达47%，并且保持在40%左右，这与使用VOx/SiO2催化剂所报告的性能相当。这表明二氧化碳可能是传统氧化剂如氧气的可行替代品，特别是在考虑到ODHP的能效优势时。每种氧化剂的具体挑战，包括副产品的形成，没有在提供的文献中详细说明，但对二氧化碳的关注表明其在提高产率和稳定性方面的潜在优势。未来的研究方向可以集中在优化催化剂设计以增强丙烯选择性上，特别是当使用氧气作为氧化剂时，鉴于XANES测量中关于铬氧化态可能存在的差异。
