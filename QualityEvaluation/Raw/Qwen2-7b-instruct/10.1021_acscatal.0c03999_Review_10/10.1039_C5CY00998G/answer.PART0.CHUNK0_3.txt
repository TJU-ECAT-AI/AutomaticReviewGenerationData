[1] "All chromium was present as highly dispersed surface chromate species, and the amount of Cr sites (evaluated in terms of their behaviour as Lewis acid centres towards NH3) was found linearly proportional to the Cr loading."
[2] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."
[3] "The only chromium species found were surface chromates (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy), accompanied by Brnsted acid centres (infra-red spectra of adsorbed NH3)."
[4] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."
[5] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."

1. Chromium was found as highly dispersed surface chromate species on the catalysts. The number of Cr sites, acting as Lewis acid centers, increased linearly with the Cr loading. 
2. Increasing the Cr content led to a decrease in the extent and regularity of mesopores, yet this did not affect the catalytic performance of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings. 
3. Surface chromates and Brnsted acid centers were identified as the predominant chromium species on the catalysts. 
4. The catalysts demonstrated stability against irreversible deactivation, achieving propene yields of up to 40% even after 900 minutes of operation at a low space velocity.
5. The spectroscopic and catalytic results provided insights into the role of different oxidants in determining the chromium oxidation state and suggested a tentative correlation between the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) and the selectivity for propene.

1. 铬以高度分散的表面铬酸盐形式存在，且Cr位点的数量（作为NH3吸附的Lewis酸中心）与Cr负载呈线性关系。
2. 随着Cr含量的增加，微孔的范围和规律性显著减少，但这并未限制高Cr负载催化剂的催化性能。
3. 表面铬酸盐和Brnsted酸中心被识别为主要的铬物种。
4. 催化剂表现出对不可逆失活的稳定性，在低空间速度下运行900分钟后，丙烯产率高达40%。
5. 光谱学和催化结果揭示了不同氧化剂在决定铬氧化态中的作用，并提出了Cr物种在反应中（Cr2+/Cr3+）氧化态与丙烯选择性的可能关联。
