[1] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."
[2] "In all cases the only chromium species found were surface chromates (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy), accompanied by Brnsted acid centres (infra-red spectra of adsorbed NH3)."
[3] "Noticeably, no irreversible deactivation occurred, independently on the dehydrogenation conditions, as indicated by the overlapping of the propane conversion curves obtained for subsequent catalytic runs."
[4] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."
[5] "The most important result is represented by the yield in the two olefins resulting from ODH in the presence of CO2 as oxidant (panel A, curve b): the initial C3H6 yield was of ca. 47% (see also Table 2 and related comment), and remained as high as ca. 40% after 1000 min of reaction."
[6] "However, even higher C3H8 conversion and catalyst stability were attained using the CO2+O2 mixture (curve d)."

Comparing sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the literature does not provide a direct comparison. However, it does highlight the effectiveness of CO2 as an oxidant, achieving high propene yields of up to 40% over a 1000-minute reaction period, which is comparable to performances reported for VOx/SiO2 catalysts. This suggests that CO2 could be a viable alternative to conventional oxidants like O2, especially considering the energy efficiency benefits of using an endothermic process like ODHP. The specific challenges associated with each oxidant, including byproduct formation, are not detailed in the provided literature, but the focus on CO2 indicates its potential advantages in terms of yield and stability. Future research directions could involve optimizing catalyst design to enhance selectivity towards propene, particularly when using O2 as an oxidant, given the potential differences in chromium oxidation state noted in the XANES measurements.

将硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2、SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）至丙烯过程中的性能进行比较，文献中并未提供直接对比。然而，它确实强调了二氧化碳作为氧化剂的有效性，在长达1000分钟的反应期间，丙烯的初始产率高达47%，并且保持在40%左右，这与使用VOx/SiO2催化剂所报告的性能相当。这表明二氧化碳可能是传统氧化剂如氧气的可行替代品，特别是在考虑到ODHP的能效优势时。每种氧化剂的具体挑战，包括副产品的形成，没有在提供的文献中详细说明，但对二氧化碳的关注表明其在提高产率和稳定性方面的潜在优势。未来的研究方向可以集中在优化催化剂设计以增强丙烯选择性上，特别是当使用氧气作为氧化剂时，鉴于XANES测量中关于铬氧化态可能存在的差异。
