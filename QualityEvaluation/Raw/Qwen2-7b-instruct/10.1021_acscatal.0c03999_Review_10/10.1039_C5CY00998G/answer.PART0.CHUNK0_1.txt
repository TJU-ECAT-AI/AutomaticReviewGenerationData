[1] "Among the heterogeneous catalysts tested in processes involving CO2 as oxidant, materials based on chromium supported on silica exhibited the most promising performances."
[2] "However, it must be considered that parallel reactions also contributed to C3H8 conversion. Actually,some H2 (< 0.5 mol%) was found among the products when CO2 alone was used as oxidant, likely resulting for the occurrence to some extent of both propane direct dehydrogenation and water gas shift reaction."
[3] "Moreover, the results of the characterization activity reported above (section 3.2) indicated that the speciation of Cr can be considered equivalent for all catalysts."
[4] "The data can be straightforwardly divided in two groups. One is constituted by the spectra of the catalysts used in direct dehydrogenation and in ODH with CO2 as oxidant (curves a and b):both spectra have the edge (evaluated at the maximum of the derivative curve) at 6002 eV, accompanied by an intense and broad pre-edge peak centred around 5996 eV, and by two weak pre-edge peaks at 5988 and 5990 eV. All these signals witness for the presence of Cr2+ species, as previously discussed for 0.5-Cr/DHS reduced in CO (Fig. 4A, curve b)."
[5] "Conversely, the spectra of the catalyst used for ODH with O2 or O2+CO2 as oxidant (curves c and d) exhibited a double edge at higher energy (5999 and 6003 eV) and two weak pre-edge peaks 5990 and 5993 eV. These three features appeared very similar to those present in the spectrum of Cr2O3 reference compound."

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) in ODHP is not discussed in the literature. The document focuses on the use of CO2 and O2 as oxidants. The literature does not compare sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in terms of propylene yield, byproduct formation, or challenges associated with each oxidant. It primarily discusses the impact of CO2 and O2 on propylene yield, catalyst stability, and the oxidation state of chromium species during the reaction. Future research directions include tuning the O2/CO2 ratio to obtain a desired olefin mixture composition and investigating the possibility of improving catalyst design to enhance propylene yield and selectivity.

硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯中的效果未在文献中进行比较。文献主要关注二氧化碳和氧气作为氧化剂的作用，没有将硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂进行比较，讨论其丙烯产率、副产物形成以及每种氧化剂的挑战。文献主要探讨了使用二氧化碳和氧气对丙烯产率、催化剂稳定性以及反应过程中铬物种的氧化状态的影响。未来的研究方向包括调整氧气与二氧化碳的比例以获得所需的烯烃混合物组成，并研究改进催化剂设计以提高丙烯产率和选择性的问题。
