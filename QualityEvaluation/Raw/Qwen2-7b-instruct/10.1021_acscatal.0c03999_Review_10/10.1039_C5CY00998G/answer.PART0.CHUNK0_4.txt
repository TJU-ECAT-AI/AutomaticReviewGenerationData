[1] "Among the heterogeneous catalysts tested in processes involving CO2 as oxidant, materials based on chromium supported on silica exhibited the most promising performances."
[2] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."
[3] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."
[4] "When O2 was used for ODH (alone or mixed with CO2) their average oxidation state should be +3."

1. Materials based on chromium supported on silica showed the most promising performances when tested in processes involving CO2 as oxidant.
2. The catalysts were stable, even after a testing period of approximately 900 minutes, achieving high propene yields of up to 40%.
3. The spectroscopic and catalytic results helped explain the role of different oxidants in determining the chromium oxidation state and suggested a tentative correlation between the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) and propene selectivity.
4. The average oxidation state of chromium species changed to +3 when oxygen was used as an oxidant for oxidative dehydrogenation, whether alone or mixed with CO2.

1. 当测试涉及二氧化碳作为氧化剂的过程时，基于铬支持在硅胶上的材料显示出最令人鼓舞的表现。
2. 催化剂表现出稳定性，即使在测试持续约900分钟后，仍能获得高达40%的丙烯产率。
3. 光谱和催化结果帮助解释了不同氧化剂在确定铬氧化状态中的作用，并提出了在反应中（Cr2+/Cr3+）铬物种的氧化状态与丙烯选择性的初步相关性。
4. 当使用氧气作为氧化剂进行氧化脱氢时，无论是单独使用还是与二氧化碳混合使用，铬物种的平均氧化状态应为+3。
