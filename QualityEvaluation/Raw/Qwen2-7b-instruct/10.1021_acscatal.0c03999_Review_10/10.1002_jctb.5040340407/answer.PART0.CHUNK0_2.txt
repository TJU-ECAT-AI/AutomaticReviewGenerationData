[1] "Although different catalysts, mainly metal oxides and sulphides, have been used for the above process, little has been published on the kinetics5 and/or the use of metals as catalysts for this type of reation."
[2] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."
[3] "The presence of COz, among other products, suggests that either the initial propane reaction may be unselective or some of the propylene product may be oxidised to C02 and HzO."

1. Different catalysts, primarily metal oxides and sulfides, have been utilized in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. However, little research focuses on the kinetics and the application of metals as catalysts for this reaction. 
2. Adding sulfur dioxide to the propylene feed increases the overall rate of conversion but significantly decreases the selectivity towards propylene formation.
3. The formation of carbon dioxide in the reaction indicates that the initial propane reaction might lack selectivity or that some propylene product could be oxidized into carbon dioxide and water.

1. 不同催化剂，主要为金属氧化物和硫化物，已被用于氧化脱氢反应。然而，很少有关于该反应中催化剂动力学以及金属催化剂应用的研究。
2. 将二氧化硫添加到丙烯流中会增加总的转化率，但显著降低丙烯选择性。
3. 反应中产生二氧化碳表明，初始丙烷反应可能缺乏选择性，或者部分丙烯产物可能被氧化成二氧化碳和水。
