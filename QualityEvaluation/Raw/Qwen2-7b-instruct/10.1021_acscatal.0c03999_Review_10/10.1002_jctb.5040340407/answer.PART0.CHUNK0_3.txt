[1] "A major development in the field of propane dehydrogenation has been the application of an oxidative process for this reaction, thereby removing the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation."
[2] "Although different catalysts, mainly metal oxides and sulphides, have been used for the above process, little has been published on the kinetics5 and/or the use of metals as catalysts for this type of reation."
[3] "The presence of CO2, among other products, suggests that either the initial propane reaction may be unselective or some of the propylene product may be oxidised to CO2 and H2O."
[4] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."
[5] "For example at 855 K, selectivity to propylene was 20.6% at 19.10% conversion (with 0.0134 mol of sulphur dioxide present in the feed) as compared with 93.1% selectivity at 18.0% conversion in the absence of SO2."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) involves the use of sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2, which remove thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation. Different catalysts, including metal oxides and sulfides, have been employed in this process, but there is limited literature on the kinetics and the utilization of metals as catalysts. The presence of CO2 indicates potential issues with selectivity or oxidation of propylene to CO2 and H2O.

2. In comparison to conventional oxidants, sulfur-based oxidants like SO2 affect the ODHP differently. They increase the overall conversion rate, yet decrease the selectivity to propylene formation. For instance, at 855 K, with 0.0134 mol of SO2 in the feed, the selectivity to propylene dropped to 20.6% at 19.10% conversion, whereas in the absence of SO2, the selectivity reached 93.1% at 18.0% conversion.

1. 烷烃氧化脱氢（ODHP）领域的一大发展是采用氧化过程，从而克服传统脱氢的热力学限制。不同的催化剂，尤其是金属氧化物和硫化物，被用于这一过程，但关于催化剂的热力学以及金属在该反应中的应用，文献记载较少。CO2的存在表明可能存在选择性问题或丙烯氧化为CO2和H2O。

2. 相比于传统氧化剂，硫基氧化剂如SO2对ODHP的影响有所不同。它们提高了整体转化率，却降低了丙烯形成的选择性。例如，在855 K时，当有0.0134 mol的SO2作为原料添加时，在19.10%转化率下，丙烯选择性降至20.6%，而在不添加SO2的情况下，选择性在18.0%转化率时达到了93.1%。
