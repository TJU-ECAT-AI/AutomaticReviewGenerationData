[1] "A major development in the field of propane dehydrogenation has been the application of an oxidative process for this reaction, thereby removing the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation."
[2] "Although different catalysts, mainly metal oxides and sulphides, have been used for the above process, little has been published on the kinetics5 and/or the use of metals as catalysts for this type of reation."
[3] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated in the temperature range 825-884 K."
[4] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."
[5] "In the present experiments, in addition to HzS and H20, the effluent from reaction (1) also contained carbon dioxide."
[6] "It appears from the data obtained that the effect of sulphur dioxide on the mechanism of dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is complex."

1. The oxidative process for propane dehydrogenation has overcome thermodynamic limitations, allowing for more efficient conversion to propylene compared to conventional methods. However, the kinetics and use of metals as catalysts in this process are less explored.
2. When sulfur dioxide is added to the reaction mixture, the rate of conversion increases, but the selectivity for propylene formation decreases significantly. This suggests that sulfur dioxide affects the reaction mechanism in a complex way.
3. Carbon dioxide is a byproduct formed during the reaction, especially at the beginning, indicating that the catalyst is highly active initially.
4. The presence of sulfur dioxide complicates the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation to propylene, as evidenced by the changes in propylene yield and selectivity.

1. 在丙烷脱氢领域，氧化过程的应用已克服了传统脱氢的热力学限制，使得丙烯的转化更加高效。然而，关于使用金属作为催化剂的反应动力学及其应用的研究较少。
2. 当向丙烯流中添加二氧化硫时，转化率显著增加，但丙烯的选择性显著降低。这表明二氧化硫对反应机制的影响复杂。
3. 反应过程中会产生二氧化碳，尤其是在初期，这表明催化剂在初始阶段非常活跃。
4. 二氧化硫的存在使丙烷脱氢到丙烯的过程机制变得复杂，表现为丙烯产量和选择性的变化。
