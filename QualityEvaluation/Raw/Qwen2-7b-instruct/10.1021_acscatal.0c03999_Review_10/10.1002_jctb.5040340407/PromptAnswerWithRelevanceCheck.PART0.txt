[1] "The presence of CO2, among other products, suggests that either the initial propane reaction may be unselective or some of the propylene product may be oxidised to CO2 and H2O."
[2] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."
[3] "The reaction of propane with sulphur dioxide can be written as: 3C3Hg + S02 → 3C3H,+ HZS + 2HzO (1)"
[4] "The effect of propane partial pressure (nitrogen was used as a diluent) on the rate of dehydrogenation to propylene is shown in Figure 2."
[5] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated in the temperature range 825-884 K."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The sulfur-based oxidants, particularly sulfur dioxide (SO2), have been effective in increasing the overall rate of conversion during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. However, they significantly reduce the selectivity towards propylene formation. Byproducts like carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) are produced, indicating potential issues with the selectivity of the initial propane reaction or oxidation of propylene products.

2. The addition of sulfur dioxide to the propylene feed enhances the rate of conversion but decreases the selectivity to propylene formation. This implies that sulfur dioxide accelerates the reaction but complicates the product distribution.

3. The reaction of propane with sulfur dioxide follows the chemical equation 3C3Hg + S02 → 3C3H,+ HZS + 2HzO, indicating the transformation of propane molecules upon interaction with sulfur dioxide.

4. The rate of dehydrogenation of propane to propylene shows a dependency on the propane partial pressure, suggesting that the reaction kinetics are influenced by the concentration of propane in the mixture.

5. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was primarily studied within a specific temperature range of 825-884 K, providing insights into the optimal conditions for this reaction.

1. 硫基氧化剂，特别是二氧化硫（SO2），在丙烷氧化脱氢转化为丙烯的过程中有效提高了总体转化率。然而，它们显著降低了丙烯形成的选择性。生成的副产品如二氧化碳（CO2）和水（H2O），表明可能存在初始丙烷反应的不选择性或丙烯产物的氧化问题。

2. 向丙烯流中添加二氧化硫增加了整体转化率，但大大减少了丙烯形成的选择性。这表明二氧化硫加速了反应，但复杂了产品的分布。

3. 丙烷与二氧化硫的反应遵循化学方程式3C3Hg + S02 → 3C3H,+ HZS + 2HzO，表明在与二氧化硫相互作用时，丙烷分子发生了转变。

4. 丙烷脱氢转化为丙烯的速率显示出对丙烷分压的依赖性，表明反应动力学受到混合物中丙烷浓度的影响。

5. 在825-884 K的特定温度范围内，主要研究了丙烷脱氢的条件，提供了了解此反应的最佳条件的见解。

[1] "A major development in the field of propane dehydrogenation has been the application of an oxidative process for this reaction, thereby removing the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation."
[2] "Although different catalysts, mainly metal oxides and sulphides, have been used for the above process, little has been published on the kinetics5 and/or the use of metals as catalysts for this type of reation."
[3] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."
[4] "In the present experiments, in addition to HzS and H20, the effluent from reaction (1) also contained carbon dioxide. This was formed in large amounts at the early stages of the reaction and then decreased with operating time, suggesting that the catalyst was quite active initially."
[5] "In conclusion it appears from the data obtained that the effect of sulphur dioxide on the mechanism of dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is complex. The presence of COz, among other products, suggests that either the initial propane reaction may be unselective or some of the propylene product may be oxidised to C02 and HzO."

1. The application of oxidative processes in propane dehydrogenation has overcome thermodynamic limitations, offering a significant development in the field. While various catalysts, including metal oxides and sulfides, have been utilized, the study of the kinetics and metal-catalyzed reactions in this context is scarce.

2. The introduction of sulfur dioxide in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane enhances the conversion rate but leads to a notable decline in propylene selectivity. The reaction mechanism remains intricate, implicating potential issues with the initial propane reaction or post-propylene oxidation.

3. The catalyst's performance is characterized by its ability to initiate rapid reactions, indicated by the high production of CO2 at the reaction's onset, which subsequently decreases over time, signifying the catalyst's initial efficiency.

4. The observed complexity in the effect of sulfur dioxide on the propane dehydrogenation process suggests a dual mechanism. This could involve either an unselective initial propane reaction or the oxidation of propylene to CO2 and H2O, highlighting the multifaceted nature of the reaction dynamics.

[5] "For example at 855 K, selectivity to propylene was 20.6% at 19.10% conversion (with 0.0134 mol of sulphur dioxide present in the feed) as compared with 93.1% selectivity at 18.0% conversion in the absence of SO2."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) involves the use of sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2, which remove thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation. Different catalysts, including metal oxides and sulfides, have been employed in this process, but there is limited literature on the kinetics and the utilization of metals as catalysts. The presence of CO2 indicates potential issues with selectivity or oxidation of propylene to CO2 and H2O.

2. In comparison to conventional oxidants, sulfur-based oxidants like SO2 affect the ODHP differently. They increase the overall conversion rate, yet decrease the selectivity to propylene formation. For instance, at 855 K, with 0.0134 mol of SO2 in the feed, the selectivity to propylene dropped to 20.6% at 19.10% conversion, whereas in the absence of SO2, the selectivity reached 93.1% at 18.0% conversion.

1. 烷烃氧化脱氢（ODHP）领域的一大发展是采用氧化过程，从而克服传统脱氢的热力学限制。不同的催化剂，尤其是金属氧化物和硫化物，被用于这一过程，但关于催化剂的热力学以及金属在该反应中的应用，文献记载较少。CO2的存在表明可能存在选择性问题或丙烯氧化为CO2和H2O。

2. 相比于传统氧化剂，硫基氧化剂如SO2对ODHP的影响有所不同。它们提高了整体转化率，却降低了丙烯形成的选择性。例如，在855 K时，当有0.0134 mol的SO2作为原料添加时，在19.10%转化率下，丙烯选择性降至20.6%，而在不添加SO2的情况下，选择性在18.0%转化率时达到了93.1%。
