[1] "The presence of CO2, among other products, suggests that either the initial propane reaction may be unselective or some of the propylene product may be oxidised to CO2 and H2O."
[2] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."
[3] "The reaction of propane with sulphur dioxide can be written as: 3C3Hg + S02 → 3C3H,+ HZS + 2HzO (1)"
[4] "The effect of propane partial pressure (nitrogen was used as a diluent) on the rate of dehydrogenation to propylene is shown in Figure 2."
[5] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated in the temperature range 825-884 K."

1. The sulfur-based oxidants, particularly sulfur dioxide (SO2), have been effective in increasing the overall rate of conversion during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. However, they significantly reduce the selectivity towards propylene formation. Byproducts like carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) are produced, indicating potential issues with the selectivity of the initial propane reaction or oxidation of propylene products.

2. The addition of sulfur dioxide to the propylene feed enhances the rate of conversion but decreases the selectivity to propylene formation. This implies that sulfur dioxide accelerates the reaction but complicates the product distribution.

3. The reaction of propane with sulfur dioxide follows the chemical equation 3C3Hg + S02 → 3C3H,+ HZS + 2HzO, indicating the transformation of propane molecules upon interaction with sulfur dioxide.

4. The rate of dehydrogenation of propane to propylene shows a dependency on the propane partial pressure, suggesting that the reaction kinetics are influenced by the concentration of propane in the mixture.

5. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was primarily studied within a specific temperature range of 825-884 K, providing insights into the optimal conditions for this reaction.

1. 硫基氧化剂，特别是二氧化硫（SO2），在丙烷氧化脱氢转化为丙烯的过程中有效提高了总体转化率。然而，它们显著降低了丙烯形成的选择性。生成的副产品如二氧化碳（CO2）和水（H2O），表明可能存在初始丙烷反应的不选择性或丙烯产物的氧化问题。

2. 向丙烯流中添加二氧化硫增加了整体转化率，但大大减少了丙烯形成的选择性。这表明二氧化硫加速了反应，但复杂了产品的分布。

3. 丙烷与二氧化硫的反应遵循化学方程式3C3Hg + S02 → 3C3H,+ HZS + 2HzO，表明在与二氧化硫相互作用时，丙烷分子发生了转变。

4. 丙烷脱氢转化为丙烯的速率显示出对丙烷分压的依赖性，表明反应动力学受到混合物中丙烷浓度的影响。

5. 在825-884 K的特定温度范围内，主要研究了丙烷脱氢的条件，提供了了解此反应的最佳条件的见解。
