[1] "A major development in the field of propane dehydrogenation has been the application of an oxidative process for this reaction, thereby removing the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation."
[2] "Although different catalysts, mainly metal oxides and sulphides, have been used for the above process, little has been published on the kinetics5 and/or the use of metals as catalysts for this type of reation."
[3] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."
[4] "In the present experiments, in addition to HzS and H20, the effluent from reaction (1) also contained carbon dioxide. This was formed in large amounts at the early stages of the reaction and then decreased with operating time, suggesting that the catalyst was quite active initially."
[5] "In conclusion it appears from the data obtained that the effect of sulphur dioxide on the mechanism of dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is complex. The presence of COz, among other products, suggests that either the initial propane reaction may be unselective or some of the propylene product may be oxidised to C02 and HzO."

1. The application of oxidative processes in propane dehydrogenation has overcome thermodynamic limitations, offering a significant development in the field. While various catalysts, including metal oxides and sulfides, have been utilized, the study of the kinetics and metal-catalyzed reactions in this context is scarce.

2. The introduction of sulfur dioxide in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane enhances the conversion rate but leads to a notable decline in propylene selectivity. The reaction mechanism remains intricate, implicating potential issues with the initial propane reaction or post-propylene oxidation.

3. The catalyst's performance is characterized by its ability to initiate rapid reactions, indicated by the high production of CO2 at the reaction's onset, which subsequently decreases over time, signifying the catalyst's initial efficiency.

4. The observed complexity in the effect of sulfur dioxide on the propane dehydrogenation process suggests a dual mechanism. This could involve either an unselective initial propane reaction or the oxidation of propylene to CO2 and H2O, highlighting the multifaceted nature of the reaction dynamics.

1. 在丙烷脱氢领域，通过应用氧化过程实现了这一反应，从而克服了传统脱氢的热力学限制，这是该领域的重大发展。虽然使用了包括金属氧化物和硫化物在内的多种催化剂，但对于这类反应的热力学研究却很少。

2. 在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中添加二氧化硫可以提高转化率，但导致丙烯选择性显著下降。反应机制复杂，可能涉及初始丙烷反应的选择性问题或丙烯产物的后续氧化。

3. 催化剂表现出在反应初期高效启动的能力，这从反应早期大量产生二氧化碳并随时间减少的现象中可以看出，表明催化剂的初步效能。

4. 二氧化硫对丙烷脱氢过程的影响复杂多变，可能涉及两种机制：一是初始丙烷反应的选择性不足，二是丙烯产物被氧化为二氧化碳和水。
