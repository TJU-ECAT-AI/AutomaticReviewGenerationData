The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene was compared in the study. Among these, sulfur dioxide (SO2) was found to be effective in catalyzing the dehydrogenation process, particularly when it was introduced in pulses. This led to increased formation of propylene compared to pure propane or propane with a weaker oxidizing agent. The study also indicated that sulfur contributed significantly to the catalytic properties of the resulting oxidative condensation products (OCP), enhancing propylene yield. However, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant, such as byproduct formation, were not explicitly detailed in the provided document. For future research, improving catalyst design to optimize the ODHP process and managing potential byproducts are key areas of focus.

1. In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 can be utilized as oxidizing agents. Among these, SO2 was found to be effective, as evidenced by its capability to increase the yield of propylene. This enhancement might be attributed to sulfur entering into the composition of oxidative condensation products (OCP), which are presumed to be catalytically active. The presence of sulfur in the OCP could facilitate the activation of propane and boost the contribution of a stepwise mechanism.

2. The use of conventional oxidants in ODHP presents several challenges, including the formation of byproducts. The specifics of these byproducts and their impacts on the efficiency and selectivity of the process were not detailed in the literature. However, the study suggests that the choice of oxidant can significantly influence propylene yield and the catalytic properties of the oxidative condensation products.

3. Future research directions should focus on optimizing catalyst design and process parameters to mitigate byproduct formation while maximizing propylene yield. Key areas for investigation may include the development of more selective oxidants, enhancing the stability and longevity of the catalysts, and refining the reaction conditions to achieve better control over the reaction pathways and product distribution.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯（ODHP）的过程中，硫基氧化剂如H2S、S2和SO2可以作为氧化剂使用。其中，SO2被发现是有效的，因为它能够提高丙烯的产率。这种增强可能归因于进入OCP（氧化聚合产物）组成的硫，这些OCP被认为具有催化活性。OCP中的硫的存在可能会促进丙烷的活化，并增加步进机制的贡献。

2. 使用传统氧化剂在ODHP过程中存在一些挑战，包括副产品的形成。这些副产品的具体性质及其对过程效率和选择性的影响没有详细说明。然而，研究表明，氧化剂的选择对丙烯产率和OCP的催化性质有显著影响。

3. 未来研究的方向应该集中在优化催化剂设计和工艺参数以减少副产品的形成并最大化丙烯产率。关键的研究领域可能包括开发更选择性的氧化剂、提高催化剂的稳定性和寿命以及调整反应条件以更好地控制反应路径和产品分布。

The literature discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) by sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the presence of carbon. The use of SO2 as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenating hydrocarbons is well-established. For instance, it has been effectively utilized in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. The oxidative condensation products (OCP) formed during the reaction are catalytically active, suggesting that sulfur incorporated into these products enhances the reaction efficiency compared to the initial reactants. The formation of propylene via the concerted mechanism of propane interaction with SO2 is highlighted. Moreover, the literature indicates that the surface area of the catalyst diminishes over time, leading to a decrease in propane conversion. The sulfur concentration in the catalyst sample significantly affects its catalytic properties. The sulfur in OCP plays a role in activating propane and increasing the contribution of the stepwise mechanism, especially as the yield of OCP grows.

文献讨论了在碳存在的条件下，通过二氧化硫（SO2）进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）。已知SO2可以作为脱氢烃类化合物的氧化剂。例如，它已被有效应用于乙基苯的脱氢。在反应过程中形成的氧化缩合产物（OCP）表现出催化活性，这表明硫化物被这些产物吸收后可以增强反应效率，与初始反应物相比。通过SO2与丙烷的协同作用形成丙烯的过程被强调。此外，文献指出催化剂表面面积随时间逐渐减少，导致丙烷转化率降低。催化剂样品中的硫浓度对其催化性能有显著影响。OCP中的硫参与了丙烷的活化，并随着OCP产率的增长增加了步骤机制的贡献。

1. Different sulfur-based oxidants such as H2S, S2, and SO2 can be used as oxidizing agents in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, the effectiveness varies based on the specific challenges associated with each oxidant, including byproduct formation. For instance, SO2 may offer a more efficient pathway for propylene formation due to its higher reactivity compared to H2S and S2. Further research could focus on optimizing catalyst design to enhance selectivity and reduce byproducts.

2. The impact of sulfur concentration on the catalytic properties of the oxide condensation products (OCP) plays a crucial role in the ODHP. Increasing sulfur concentration in OCP leads to an increase in propylene yield, indicating a significant effect on catalytic properties. Future studies should explore how sulfur incorporation into the OCP structure affects the reaction mechanism and catalyst performance.

3. The sulfur concentration in the OCP composition can participate in the activation of propane and increase the contribution of the stepwise mechanism with growing yield of OCP. This phenomenon suggests that sulfur might play a critical role in the reaction pathway. Research should aim to understand the detailed mechanism of sulfur's involvement in the activation process and its effect on the overall efficiency of the ODHP.

4. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an oxidant on carbon catalysts offers potential advantages over conventional oxidants. The presence of sulfur in the OCP enhances the reaction efficiency, leading to increased propylene yield. However, challenges include the management of byproduct formation and the optimization of catalyst properties for better selectivity and activity. Future work should concentrate on refining catalyst design and process conditions to mitigate these issues and maximize the benefits of using sulfur-based oxidants in the ODHP.

Comparing different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the sulfur-containing oxidants showed enhanced catalytic activity. Specifically, sulfur enters into the composition of oxidative condensation products (OCP), which increases their reactivity towards propane. This leads to an increased yield of propylene compared to the initial catalyst state. The oxidant SO2 was found effective as an oxidizing agent for propane dehydrogenation, as it can be used to produce propylene. Pulse experiments demonstrated that after the first pulse of RSO, the yield of propylene was significantly higher than after a pulse of R alone, suggesting the involvement of a concerted mechanism in propane interaction with SO2. The accumulation of OCP on the catalyst surface might explain the increase in propylene formation over time. By analyzing the sulfur concentration in the catalyst samples, researchers observed that higher sulfur concentration led to a rise in propylene yield after an R pulse. These findings suggest that sulfur contributes significantly to enhancing the catalytic properties of OCP. The deposition of sulfur on OCP during the reaction may facilitate the activation of propane and increase the contribution of the stepwise mechanism, which is associated with a growing yield of OCP. Future research could focus on optimizing catalyst design to improve sulfur loading and distribution, which could further enhance the efficiency of the ODHP process.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯的过程中，与传统氧化剂相比，基于硫的氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）表现出增强的催化活性。具体来说，硫进入氧化性缩合产物（OCP）的组成中，这增加了它们对丙烷的反应性。这导致了与初始催化剂状态相比更高的丙烯产率。发现SO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂是有效的，因为它可以用于生产丙烯。脉冲实验表明，在第一次RSO脉冲之后，丙烯的产量显著高于仅进行R脉冲的情况，这表明SO2与丙烷的相互作用涉及协同机制。催化剂表面可能累积的OCP可以解释随着时间的推移丙烯形成量的增加。通过分析催化剂样品中的硫浓度，研究人员观察到，硫浓度越高，R脉冲后产生的丙烯量也越高。这些发现表明，硫对OCP的催化性质有显著影响。反应过程中在OCP上沉积的硫可能会促进丙烷的活化，并随着OCP产量的增长增加步进机制的贡献。未来的研究可以集中在优化催化剂设计以提高硫的负载和分布，从而进一步提高ODHP过程的效率。
