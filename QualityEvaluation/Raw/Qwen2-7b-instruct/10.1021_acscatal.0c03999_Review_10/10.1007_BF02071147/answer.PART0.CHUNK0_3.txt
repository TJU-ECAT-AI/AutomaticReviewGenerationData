1. Different sulfur-based oxidants such as H2S, S2, and SO2 can be used as oxidizing agents in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, the effectiveness varies based on the specific challenges associated with each oxidant, including byproduct formation. For instance, SO2 may offer a more efficient pathway for propylene formation due to its higher reactivity compared to H2S and S2. Further research could focus on optimizing catalyst design to enhance selectivity and reduce byproducts.

2. The impact of sulfur concentration on the catalytic properties of the oxide condensation products (OCP) plays a crucial role in the ODHP. Increasing sulfur concentration in OCP leads to an increase in propylene yield, indicating a significant effect on catalytic properties. Future studies should explore how sulfur incorporation into the OCP structure affects the reaction mechanism and catalyst performance.

3. The sulfur concentration in the OCP composition can participate in the activation of propane and increase the contribution of the stepwise mechanism with growing yield of OCP. This phenomenon suggests that sulfur might play a critical role in the reaction pathway. Research should aim to understand the detailed mechanism of sulfur's involvement in the activation process and its effect on the overall efficiency of the ODHP.

4. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an oxidant on carbon catalysts offers potential advantages over conventional oxidants. The presence of sulfur in the OCP enhances the reaction efficiency, leading to increased propylene yield. However, challenges include the management of byproduct formation and the optimization of catalyst properties for better selectivity and activity. Future work should concentrate on refining catalyst design and process conditions to mitigate these issues and maximize the benefits of using sulfur-based oxidants in the ODHP.

1. 不同的硫基氧化剂，如H2S、S2和SO2，可以用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯的过程。然而，其有效性因与每种氧化剂相关的特定挑战而有所不同，包括副产品的形成。例如，SO2可能提供更高效的丙烯形成途径，因为它比H2S和S2具有更高的反应活性。进一步的研究应该集中在优化催化剂设计以增强选择性和减少副产品上。

2. 硫浓度对氧化物凝胶产物（OCP）的催化性质有重要影响。增加OCP中的硫浓度会导致丙烯产量的增加，表明对催化性能有显著影响。未来研究应探索硫在OCP结构中如何影响反应机制和催化剂性能。

3. 硫进入OCP组成中可以在丙烷活化过程中发挥作用，并随着OCP产率的增长增加步进机制的贡献。这表明硫可能在反应路径中起关键作用。研究应致力于理解硫参与活化过程的详细机制及其对整体ODHP效率的影响。

4. 使用二氧化硫（SO2）作为氧化剂的碳催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的应用具有潜在优势。硫的存在提高了反应效率，导致丙烯产量增加。然而，挑战包括管理副产品的形成以及优化催化剂属性以提高选择性和活性。未来的工作应集中在细化催化剂设计和工艺条件，以解决这些问题并最大化使用硫基氧化剂在ODHP中的利益。
