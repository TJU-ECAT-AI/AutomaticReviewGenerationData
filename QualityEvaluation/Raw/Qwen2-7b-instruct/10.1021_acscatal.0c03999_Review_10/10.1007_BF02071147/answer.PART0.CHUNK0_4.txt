Comparing different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the sulfur-containing oxidants showed enhanced catalytic activity. Specifically, sulfur enters into the composition of oxidative condensation products (OCP), which increases their reactivity towards propane. This leads to an increased yield of propylene compared to the initial catalyst state. The oxidant SO2 was found effective as an oxidizing agent for propane dehydrogenation, as it can be used to produce propylene. Pulse experiments demonstrated that after the first pulse of RSO, the yield of propylene was significantly higher than after a pulse of R alone, suggesting the involvement of a concerted mechanism in propane interaction with SO2. The accumulation of OCP on the catalyst surface might explain the increase in propylene formation over time. By analyzing the sulfur concentration in the catalyst samples, researchers observed that higher sulfur concentration led to a rise in propylene yield after an R pulse. These findings suggest that sulfur contributes significantly to enhancing the catalytic properties of OCP. The deposition of sulfur on OCP during the reaction may facilitate the activation of propane and increase the contribution of the stepwise mechanism, which is associated with a growing yield of OCP. Future research could focus on optimizing catalyst design to improve sulfur loading and distribution, which could further enhance the efficiency of the ODHP process.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯的过程中，与传统氧化剂相比，基于硫的氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）表现出增强的催化活性。具体来说，硫进入氧化性缩合产物（OCP）的组成中，这增加了它们对丙烷的反应性。这导致了与初始催化剂状态相比更高的丙烯产率。发现SO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂是有效的，因为它可以用于生产丙烯。脉冲实验表明，在第一次RSO脉冲之后，丙烯的产量显著高于仅进行R脉冲的情况，这表明SO2与丙烷的相互作用涉及协同机制。催化剂表面可能累积的OCP可以解释随着时间的推移丙烯形成量的增加。通过分析催化剂样品中的硫浓度，研究人员观察到，硫浓度越高，R脉冲后产生的丙烯量也越高。这些发现表明，硫对OCP的催化性质有显著影响。反应过程中在OCP上沉积的硫可能会促进丙烷的活化，并随着OCP产量的增长增加步进机制的贡献。未来的研究可以集中在优化催化剂设计以提高硫的负载和分布，从而进一步提高ODHP过程的效率。
