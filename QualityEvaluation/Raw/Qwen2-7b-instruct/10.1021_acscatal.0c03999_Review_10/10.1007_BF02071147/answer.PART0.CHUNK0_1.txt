[1] "The oxidative condensation products of the title reaction are catalytically active, presumably because sulfur enters into their composition."
[2] "It is known that SO2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]."
[3] "The aim of the present study was to investigate propane dehydrogenation by SO2 on carbon, (SBET=436 m2/g) obtained by ash granulation (the authors thank V.A. Semikolenov for the donation of this catalyst)."
[4] "Experiments were carried out under flow and pulse catalytic conditions."
[5] "To establish the mechanism of participation of the oxidant propylene formation and OCP, pulses of either propane (R), or propane with an oxidizing agent (RSO) or separate pulses of propane and an oxidizing agent (R and SO) were admitted to the catalyst."
[6] "The amount of propylene formed after an RSO pulse is almost 2.5 times higher than after an R pulse and increases with the pulse number."
[7] "It is seen that the difference in the amounts of propylene formed after R and RSO pulses, which was ascribed to the contribution of the concerted mechanism for propylene interaction with SO2, remains unchanged as the amount of OCP rises."
[8] "The results suggest that the sulfur concentration affects significantly the catalytic properties of OCP."

1. In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 can be utilized as oxidizing agents. Among these, SO2 was found to be effective, as evidenced by its capability to increase the yield of propylene. This enhancement might be attributed to sulfur entering into the composition of oxidative condensation products (OCP), which are presumed to be catalytically active. The presence of sulfur in the OCP could facilitate the activation of propane and boost the contribution of a stepwise mechanism.

2. The use of conventional oxidants in ODHP presents several challenges, including the formation of byproducts. The specifics of these byproducts and their impacts on the efficiency and selectivity of the process were not detailed in the literature. However, the study suggests that the choice of oxidant can significantly influence propylene yield and the catalytic properties of the oxidative condensation products.

3. Future research directions should focus on optimizing catalyst design and process parameters to mitigate byproduct formation while maximizing propylene yield. Key areas for investigation may include the development of more selective oxidants, enhancing the stability and longevity of the catalysts, and refining the reaction conditions to achieve better control over the reaction pathways and product distribution.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯（ODHP）的过程中，硫基氧化剂如H2S、S2和SO2可以作为氧化剂使用。其中，SO2被发现是有效的，因为它能够提高丙烯的产率。这种增强可能归因于进入OCP（氧化聚合产物）组成的硫，这些OCP被认为具有催化活性。OCP中的硫的存在可能会促进丙烷的活化，并增加步进机制的贡献。

2. 使用传统氧化剂在ODHP过程中存在一些挑战，包括副产品的形成。这些副产品的具体性质及其对过程效率和选择性的影响没有详细说明。然而，研究表明，氧化剂的选择对丙烯产率和OCP的催化性质有显著影响。

3. 未来研究的方向应该集中在优化催化剂设计和工艺参数以减少副产品的形成并最大化丙烯产率。关键的研究领域可能包括开发更选择性的氧化剂、提高催化剂的稳定性和寿命以及调整反应条件以更好地控制反应路径和产品分布。
