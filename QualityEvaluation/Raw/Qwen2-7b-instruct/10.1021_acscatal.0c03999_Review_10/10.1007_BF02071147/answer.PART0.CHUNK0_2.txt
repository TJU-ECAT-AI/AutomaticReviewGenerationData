The literature discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) by sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the presence of carbon. The use of SO2 as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenating hydrocarbons is well-established. For instance, it has been effectively utilized in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. The oxidative condensation products (OCP) formed during the reaction are catalytically active, suggesting that sulfur incorporated into these products enhances the reaction efficiency compared to the initial reactants. The formation of propylene via the concerted mechanism of propane interaction with SO2 is highlighted. Moreover, the literature indicates that the surface area of the catalyst diminishes over time, leading to a decrease in propane conversion. The sulfur concentration in the catalyst sample significantly affects its catalytic properties. The sulfur in OCP plays a role in activating propane and increasing the contribution of the stepwise mechanism, especially as the yield of OCP grows.

文献讨论了在碳存在的条件下，通过二氧化硫（SO2）进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）。已知SO2可以作为脱氢烃类化合物的氧化剂。例如，它已被有效应用于乙基苯的脱氢。在反应过程中形成的氧化缩合产物（OCP）表现出催化活性，这表明硫化物被这些产物吸收后可以增强反应效率，与初始反应物相比。通过SO2与丙烷的协同作用形成丙烯的过程被强调。此外，文献指出催化剂表面面积随时间逐渐减少，导致丙烷转化率降低。催化剂样品中的硫浓度对其催化性能有显著影响。OCP中的硫参与了丙烷的活化，并随着OCP产率的增长增加了步骤机制的贡献。
