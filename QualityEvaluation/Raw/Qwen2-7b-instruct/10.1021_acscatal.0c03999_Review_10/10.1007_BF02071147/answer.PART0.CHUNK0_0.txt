[4] "The content of propylene formed upon admitting R (Fig. la) is low and varies slightly from pulse to pulse."
[5] "Upon admitting SO after a pulse of R to the catalyst, no propylene is formed, which indicates the weak adsorption of propane."
[6] "The amount of propylene formed in a pulse of R admitted to a carbon pretreated by 50 pulses, is close to that after a pulse of R admitted to a fresh sample."
[7] "Upon admitting RSO pulses (Fig. Ib), the amount of propylene formed after the first pulse is almost 2.5 times higher than after R pulses and increases with the pulse number."
[8] "It is seen that after 100 min of catalyst operation the formation rate of propylene (in mol/s m2) is approximately four times as high as after 3 min."
[9] "Propylene yield was used to determine changes in the dehydrogenation properties of the catalyst (Fig. 3)."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene was compared in the study. Among these, sulfur dioxide (SO2) was found to be effective in catalyzing the dehydrogenation process, particularly when it was introduced in pulses. This led to increased formation of propylene compared to pure propane or propane with a weaker oxidizing agent. The study also indicated that sulfur contributed significantly to the catalytic properties of the resulting oxidative condensation products (OCP), enhancing propylene yield. However, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant, such as byproduct formation, were not explicitly detailed in the provided document. For future research, improving catalyst design to optimize the ODHP process and managing potential byproducts are key areas of focus.

在研究中，不同硫基氧化剂在丙烷（ODHP）氧化脱氢成丙烯的有效性进行了比较。其中，二氧化硫（SO2）被发现能够有效地催化这一过程，特别是在以脉冲形式引入时。这导致了与纯丙烷或丙烷与较弱氧化剂相比，形成更多的丙烯。研究还表明，硫对氧化缩合产物（OCP）的催化性质有显著影响，增强了丙烯的产率。然而，每种氧化剂的具体挑战，如副产品的生成，未在提供的文档中明确阐述。未来研究的关键领域包括改进催化剂设计以优化ODHP过程和管理潜在副产品。
