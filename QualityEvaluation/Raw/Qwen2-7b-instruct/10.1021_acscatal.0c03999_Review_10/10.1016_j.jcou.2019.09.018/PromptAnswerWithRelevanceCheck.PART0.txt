[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion."
[2] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
[3] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
[4] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

The study highlights the use of Beta zeolite as a catalyst for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. The Beta zeolite's three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large surface area are advantageous for high dispersion of chromium species. The dealumination process impacts the catalytic properties of the chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts compared to those supported on silica (SiBeta) and aluminum (AlBeta). The study also indicates that the low acidity of SiBeta supports high selectivity to propene (over 80%), whereas the high acidity of AlBeta leads to propane cracking into lighter hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the research demonstrates that the rate of propene formation increases in the presence of CO2 over the chromium-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, whereas it negatively affects the rate of propene formation over the chromium-containing AlBeta catalyst in a switch operation mode.

研究强调了使用Beta沸石作为二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢过程的催化剂。Beta沸石的三维结构、较大的孔径、高热稳定性和酸稳定性以及大的比表面积对于高铬物种的分散具有优势。去铝化过程影响了含铬Beta沸石催化剂的催化性能，与二氧化硅（SiBeta）和铝（AlBeta）支持的催化剂相比。研究还表明，低酸性SiBeta有利于实现高丙烯选择性（超过80%），而高酸性的AlBeta导致丙烷裂解为更轻的烃类。此外，研究表明，在CO2存在的模式下，丙烯形成速率在含有CO2的条件下增加，超过含铬SiBeta沸石催化剂，而在含有AlBeta催化剂的情况下，则对丙烯形成速率产生负面影响。

This study focuses on the development of active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH) using chromium-containing Beta zeolite. The catalysts are prepared through a two-step post-synthesis preparation procedure involving removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite followed by wet impregnation of chromium into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure. The dealumination of Beta zeolite significantly impacts its catalytic properties, leading to improved performance compared to aluminum-containing Beta zeolite. The study reveals that low acidity of the SiBeta support is advantageous for achieving high propene selectivity (over 80%), whereas higher acidity of the starting AlBeta zeolite promotes propane cracking into lighter hydrocarbons. Furthermore, in a switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation with and without CO2, the formation rate of propene is notably enhanced when using the Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, whereas the Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst exhibits a negative effect on the propene formation rate.

The literature discusses the preparation and evaluation of chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). The dealumination process is highlighted for its significant impact on the catalytic properties, leading to enhanced performance in terms of propene yield and selectivity. Siliceous SiBeta zeolites, after dealumination, exhibit lower acidity, which facilitates high propene selectivity, exceeding 80%. In contrast, aluminum-beta zeolites show higher acidity, promoting the cracking of propane to lighter hydrocarbons. The study also observes that in a switching operation mode between CO2-PDH and PDH without CO2, the rate of propene formation increases specifically over the Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, whereas it decreases over the Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst.

文献讨论了通过在硅基SiBeta沸石中引入铬制备并评估丙烷脱氢在二氧化碳辅助下的活性和选择性催化剂。脱铝化过程对催化性能产生了显著影响，导致丙烯产率和选择性的增强。脱铝后的硅基SiBeta沸石表现出较低的酸度，有利于实现超过80%的高丙烯选择性。相比之下，铝基β沸石具有更高的酸度，促进丙烷裂解为较轻的烃类。研究还发现，在CO2-PDH与不含CO2的PDH模式之间切换时，仅在Cr-含SiBeta沸石催化剂上，丙烯形成速率增加；而在Cr-含AlBeta催化剂上，丙烯形成速率则下降。
