[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion."
[2] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."
[3] "Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity."
[4] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH."

This study focuses on the development of new active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH) using chromium-containing Beta zeolite. The research highlights the importance of dealumination and subsequent chromium dispersion for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. The chromium oxide-based catalysts show high activity and selectivity, with the presence of redox chromium species being crucial for optimal performance.
