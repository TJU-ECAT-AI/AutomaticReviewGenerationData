[1] "New active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH) were prepared by chromium incorporation in siliceous SiBeta."
[2] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
[3] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
[4] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst,while over Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

The literature discusses the preparation and evaluation of chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). The dealumination process is highlighted for its significant impact on the catalytic properties, leading to enhanced performance in terms of propene yield and selectivity. Siliceous SiBeta zeolites, after dealumination, exhibit lower acidity, which facilitates high propene selectivity, exceeding 80%. In contrast, aluminum-beta zeolites show higher acidity, promoting the cracking of propane to lighter hydrocarbons. The study also observes that in a switching operation mode between CO2-PDH and PDH without CO2, the rate of propene formation increases specifically over the Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, whereas it decreases over the Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst.

文献讨论了通过在硅基SiBeta沸石中引入铬制备并评估丙烷脱氢在二氧化碳辅助下的活性和选择性催化剂。脱铝化过程对催化性能产生了显著影响，导致丙烯产率和选择性的增强。脱铝后的硅基SiBeta沸石表现出较低的酸度，有利于实现超过80%的高丙烯选择性。相比之下，铝基β沸石具有更高的酸度，促进丙烷裂解为较轻的烃类。研究还发现，在CO2-PDH与不含CO2的PDH模式之间切换时，仅在Cr-含SiBeta沸石催化剂上，丙烯形成速率增加；而在Cr-含AlBeta催化剂上，丙烯形成速率则下降。
