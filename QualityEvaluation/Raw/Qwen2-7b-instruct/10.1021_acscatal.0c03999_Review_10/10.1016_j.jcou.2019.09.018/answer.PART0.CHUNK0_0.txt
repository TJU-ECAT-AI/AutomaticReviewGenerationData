[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion."
[2] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
[3] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
[4] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

The study highlights the use of Beta zeolite as a catalyst for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. The Beta zeolite's three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large surface area are advantageous for high dispersion of chromium species. The dealumination process impacts the catalytic properties of the chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts compared to those supported on silica (SiBeta) and aluminum (AlBeta). The study also indicates that the low acidity of SiBeta supports high selectivity to propene (over 80%), whereas the high acidity of AlBeta leads to propane cracking into lighter hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the research demonstrates that the rate of propene formation increases in the presence of CO2 over the chromium-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, whereas it negatively affects the rate of propene formation over the chromium-containing AlBeta catalyst in a switch operation mode.

研究强调了使用Beta沸石作为二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢过程的催化剂。Beta沸石的三维结构、较大的孔径、高热稳定性和酸稳定性以及大的比表面积对于高铬物种的分散具有优势。去铝化过程影响了含铬Beta沸石催化剂的催化性能，与二氧化硅（SiBeta）和铝（AlBeta）支持的催化剂相比。研究还表明，低酸性SiBeta有利于实现高丙烯选择性（超过80%），而高酸性的AlBeta导致丙烷裂解为更轻的烃类。此外，研究表明，在CO2存在的模式下，丙烯形成速率在含有CO2的条件下增加，超过含铬SiBeta沸石催化剂，而在含有AlBeta催化剂的情况下，则对丙烯形成速率产生负面影响。
