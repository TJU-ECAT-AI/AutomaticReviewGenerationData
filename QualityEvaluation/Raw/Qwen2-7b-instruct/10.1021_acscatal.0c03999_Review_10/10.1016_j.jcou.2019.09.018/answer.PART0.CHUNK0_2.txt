[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion."
[2] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."
[3] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
[4] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
[5] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

This study focuses on the development of active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH) using chromium-containing Beta zeolite. The catalysts are prepared through a two-step post-synthesis preparation procedure involving removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite followed by wet impregnation of chromium into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure. The dealumination of Beta zeolite significantly impacts its catalytic properties, leading to improved performance compared to aluminum-containing Beta zeolite. The study reveals that low acidity of the SiBeta support is advantageous for achieving high propene selectivity (over 80%), whereas higher acidity of the starting AlBeta zeolite promotes propane cracking into lighter hydrocarbons. Furthermore, in a switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation with and without CO2, the formation rate of propene is notably enhanced when using the Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, whereas the Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst exhibits a negative effect on the propene formation rate.

本研究专注于通过铬含量的β沸石作为催化剂，用于在二氧化碳协助下进行丙烷脱氢制丙烯（CO2-PDH）。催化剂通过去除TEABeta沸石中的铝，然后采用湿浸润法将铬引入硅质SiBeta沸石结构的两步后合成制备过程。Beta沸石的去铝化对其催化性能产生了显著影响，导致与铝含量的Beta沸石相比表现出更好的性能。研究表明，SiBeta支持的低酸性有利于实现高丙烯选择性（超过80%），而起始的AlBeta沸石的高酸性则促进丙烷裂解成轻质烃。此外，在丙烷脱氢操作模式切换为存在或不存在二氧化碳时，使用Cr含SiBeta沸石催化剂时丙烯生成速率明显增加，而Cr含AlBeta催化剂对丙烯生成速率产生负面影响。
