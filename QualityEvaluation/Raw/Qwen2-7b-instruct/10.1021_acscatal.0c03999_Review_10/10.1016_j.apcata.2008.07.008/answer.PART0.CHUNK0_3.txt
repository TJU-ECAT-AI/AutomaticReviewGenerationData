[1] "The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species."
[2] "The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+)."
[3] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene observed over the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts is not only attributed to the direct oxidation of propane (oxidative dehy- drogenation) but also can be related to a facilitation of simple dehydrogenation by its coupling with the RWGS reaction."

Comparing the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the sulfur-based oxidants such as H2S, S2, and SO2 face specific challenges. These include byproduct formation, particularly sulfur compounds which can be difficult to remove and can potentially poison catalysts. The impact on propylene yield varies depending on the oxidant's reactivity and the catalyst's ability to handle sulfur compounds effectively.

For instance, sulfur oxides like SO2 can lead to the formation of sulfuric acid, which can cause corrosion and damage equipment. Sulfur disulfide (S2) might decompose into elemental sulfur, which can deposit on the catalyst surface and reduce its activity. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can also lead to sulfur deposits that deactivate catalysts over time.

To improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process, future research should focus on developing catalysts with higher resistance to sulfur poisoning. This could involve designing catalysts with better sulfur tolerance, incorporating sulfur scavenging mechanisms, or finding ways to recycle sulfur compounds efficiently. Additionally, exploring novel oxidants with fewer byproducts or designing processes that minimize sulfur contamination could enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the ODHP.

The role of chromium oxide supported on MCM-41 as a catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 demonstrates the potential of coupling oxidative dehydrogenation with the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS). The presence of dispersed chromium species on the catalyst surface allows for efficient conversion of propane to propene, facilitated by the CO2, which acts not only as an oxidant but also as a hydrogen sink through the RWGS reaction. This synergy increases propene yield and makes the process more efficient.

Future research in this area could aim to enhance the dispersion of chromium species on the support to maximize catalytic activity. Investigating the interaction between CO2 and chromium oxides to understand the specific redox cycles involved could also provide insights into optimizing the process conditions for better yield and selectivity. Developing more robust catalysts that maintain high activity over multiple cycles would be crucial for practical implementation of this technology.

比较不同硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯（ODHP）过程中的效果，硫基氧化剂如H2S、S2和SO2面临特定挑战。这些挑战包括副产品的形成，特别是可能损坏设备的硫化合物。不同氧化剂对丙烯产率的影响因氧化剂的活性和催化剂处理硫化合物的能力而异。

例如，硫氧化物如SO2可能导致硫酸的形成，这可能导致腐蚀和设备损害。S2可能会分解成元素硫，这可以沉积在催化剂表面并降低其活性。H2S也可能导致硫沉积，随着时间的推移逐渐使催化剂失活。

为了提高催化剂设计和优化整个过程，未来研究应集中在开发具有更高硫中毒抵抗力的催化剂上。这可能涉及设计具有更好硫耐受性的催化剂、引入硫清除机制或找到有效回收硫化合物的方法。探索具有较少副产品的新氧化剂或设计减少硫污染的过程也能够提高ODHP的效率和可持续性。

MCM-41支持的铬氧化物作为丙烷与CO2脱氢催化剂的作用表明，通过氧化脱氢与反水煤气变换反应（RWGS）的耦合，能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。分散在催化剂表面的铬物种允许通过CO2进行有效转换，CO2不仅作为氧化剂，而且通过RWGS反应作为氢气吸收体，这种协同作用增加了丙烯产率，使过程更加高效。

未来的研究可以集中于增强支持物上铬物种的分散以最大化催化活性。深入研究CO2与铬氧化物之间的相互作用，以了解具体还原-氧化周期，将提供优化工艺条件以获得更好产率和选择性的洞察。开发更耐用的催化剂，使其在多周期内保持高活性对于这项技术的实际应用至关重要。
