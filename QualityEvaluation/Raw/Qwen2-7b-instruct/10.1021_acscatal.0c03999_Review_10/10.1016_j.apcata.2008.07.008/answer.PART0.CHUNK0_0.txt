[1] "The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species."
[2] "The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+)."
[3] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene observed over the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts is not only attributed to the direct oxidation of propane (oxidative dehy- drogenation) but also can be related to a facilitation of simple dehydrogenation by its coupling with the RWGS reaction."
[4] "The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene."

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene involves multiple factors including propylene yield, byproduct formation, and challenges associated with each oxidant. In comparison to conventional oxidants, sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 might offer unique advantages or drawbacks depending on their specific interactions with the reaction system. Challenges include managing the formation of unwanted byproducts and optimizing the catalyst design for efficient conversion. Future research aims to improve catalyst design and process optimization to maximize propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation and enhancing overall efficiency.
