[1] "The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species."
[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene observed over the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts is not only attributed to the direct oxidation of propane (oxidative dehy- drogenation) but also can be related to a facilitation of simple dehydrogenation by its coupling with the RWGS reaction."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene varies significantly. H2S, S2, and SO2 each have distinct impacts on propylene yield, specific challenges, and opportunities for future research. H2S tends to produce higher propylene yields due to its strong oxidizing power, but it also forms byproducts like hydrogen sulfide and sulfuric acid, which require careful management. S2 can lead to complex reactions that affect yield and selectivity, requiring advanced catalyst design to mitigate. SO2 offers a balance between yield enhancement and byproduct control, but its usage is limited by environmental concerns and the need for effective sulfur recovery systems. Future research should focus on developing more efficient catalysts, optimizing reaction conditions, and minimizing byproduct formation to improve the overall process efficiency and sustainability.

In the context of the literature, the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts demonstrate high activity in both dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions, thanks to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield is multifaceted, including direct oxidation of propane and facilitation through coupling with the RWGS reaction. This synergy highlights the potential for CO2 utilization in propene production, offering both economic benefits and environmental advantages.

不同硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯过程中的效果差异显著。H2S、S2和SO2各自对丙烯产率的影响、特定挑战以及未来研究的机会各不相同。H2S因其较强的氧化能力，往往能产生较高的丙烯产率，但也容易形成副产物如硫化氢和硫酸，需要精心管理。S2可能导致复杂反应影响产率和选择性，需要高级催化剂设计来缓解。SO2在增强产率和减少副产物形成之间取得平衡，但其使用受限于环境问题和有效的硫回收系统需求。未来研究应专注于开发更高效的催化剂、优化反应条件，并尽量减少副产物生成，以提高整个过程的效率和可持续性。

根据文献，MCM-41支持的铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢和RWGS反应中表现出高活性，得益于表面分散的铬物种的存在。CO2促进丙烯产率的效果是多方面的，包括直接氧化丙烷和通过与RWGS反应耦合促进简单脱氢。这种协同作用突显了CO2在丙烯生产中的利用潜力，既提供了经济效益也带来了环境优势。
