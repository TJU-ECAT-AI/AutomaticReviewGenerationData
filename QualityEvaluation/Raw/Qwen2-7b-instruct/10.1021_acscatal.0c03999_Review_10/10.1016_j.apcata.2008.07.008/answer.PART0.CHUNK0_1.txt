[1] "The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species."
[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene observed over the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts is not only attributed to the direct oxidation of propane (oxidative dehy- drogenation) but also can be related to a facilitation of simple dehydrogenation by its coupling with the RWGS reaction."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene varies significantly. H2S, S2, and SO2 are considered as potential oxidants. H2S is effective in producing propylene but often results in the formation of byproducts such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur compounds. S2, being a stronger oxidant, can lead to higher yields of propylene but also increases the risk of sulfur poisoning in the catalyst. SO2, while less reactive than S2, offers better resistance to sulfur poisoning but still faces issues with byproduct formation. Future research should focus on developing catalyst designs that can efficiently utilize these oxidants while minimizing byproduct formation and enhancing the selectivity to propylene.

不同硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯中的有效性存在显著差异。H2S、S2和SO2被视为潜在的氧化剂。H2S在产生丙烯方面是有效的，但往往伴随着硫化氢和其他硫化合物的副产品形成。S2作为更强的氧化剂，能导致更高的丙烯产率，但也增加了催化剂中毒的风险。SO2虽然比S2反应性低，但在防止硫中毒方面有更好的耐受性，但仍面临副产品形成的挑战。未来的研究应集中在开发能够高效利用这些氧化剂、同时减少副产品形成并增强丙烯选择性的催化剂设计上。

The key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process involve developing more efficient catalysts that can handle sulfur-based oxidants effectively, reducing byproduct formation, and enhancing the selectivity towards propylene. Additionally, understanding the specific mechanisms involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation process and how different oxidants interact with the catalyst will aid in refining the process parameters and catalyst formulations. This includes studying the effects of temperature, pressure, and oxidant concentration on the process efficiency and product yield.
