[1] "The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species."
[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene observed over the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts is not only attributed to the direct oxidation of propane (oxidative dehy- drogenation) but also can be related to a facilitation of simple dehydrogenation by its coupling with the RWGS reaction."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene varies significantly. Among these, sulfur dioxide (SO2) stands out for its ability to facilitate a higher yield of propylene. The challenges associated with these oxidants include the formation of byproducts, which can negatively impact the efficiency of the process. To optimize the overall process and improve catalyst design, future research should focus on developing catalysts that can efficiently utilize these sulfur-based oxidants while minimizing byproduct formation. Key areas for investigation include understanding the reaction mechanisms, improving catalyst stability, and enhancing selectivity towards propylene production.
