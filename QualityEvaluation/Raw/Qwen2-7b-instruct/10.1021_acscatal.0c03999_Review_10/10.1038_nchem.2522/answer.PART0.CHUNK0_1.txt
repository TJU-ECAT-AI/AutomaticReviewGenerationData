[1] "The emerging conventional and non-conventional natural-gas reserves,which contain copious amounts of methane (7599 mol%), but also of ethane (115 mol%) and propane (110 mol%), offer an exciting potential as a feedstock for value- added chemicals and fuels110."
[2] "Among many investigated material families, vanadium phosphate (VPO) is identified as the best oxybromination catalyst, as it provides selectivity for CH3Br up to 95% and stable operation for over 100 hours on stream."
[3] "The key to accomplish this micro-level spatiotemporal management of the complex heterogeneous gas-phase network is to find a catalyst that is able to oxidize HBr, but is inert with respect to the CH bonds of the carbon-containing molecules."
[4] "The estimated experimental errors are indicated in Supplementary Table 1."
[5] "The performance of VPO in the oxybromination of methane,ethane and propane. The alkane conversion (X) as a function of the Tbed shows that the temperature onset of the oxybromination reaction decreases in the order methane > ethane > propane, which is in line with a decrease in the CH bond strength."

The literature does not provide direct comparisons between sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) and conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, it does discuss the use of vanadium phosphate (VPO) as an effective oxybromination catalyst for the functionalization of methane, ethane, and propane. VPO provides high selectivity for CH3Br (up to 95%) and demonstrates stable operation for over 100 hours. The catalyst design strategies aim to achieve optimal synergy between the oxidation of HBr and the gas-phase alkane bromination. The literature also mentions the complexity of the reaction network for higher alkanes and the importance of controlling the spatiotemporal management of the heterogeneous gas-phase network.

The key challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP include the formation of byproducts and the specific challenges in catalyst design and optimization. For instance, the formation of CO and CO2 might be influenced by the activation of the alkane on the catalyst surface. Future research areas may focus on improving catalyst design to reduce unwanted side reactions and enhance the selectivity for propylene.

The literature discusses the performance of VPO in the oxybromination of methane, ethane, and propane, highlighting the temperature onset of the oxybromination reaction decreases in the order of methane > ethane > propane, correlating with the decrease in CH bond strength. This information can be used as a reference point for understanding the relative effectiveness of VPO compared to other oxidants in similar processes.

文献没有直接比较硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯过程中的效果。然而，它确实讨论了范德华磷酸盐（VPO）作为甲烷、乙烷和丙烷功能化过程的有效氧溴化催化剂。VPO提供了高达95%的CH3Br选择性，并且能够稳定运行超过100小时。催化剂设计策略旨在实现HBr氧化和气体相烷基溴化之间的最佳协同作用。文献还提到了更高烷烃反应网络复杂性的关键挑战以及对空间时间管理的重要性。

与硫基氧化剂相关的ODHP特定挑战包括副产品的形成以及催化剂设计和优化的具体挑战。例如，CO和CO2的形成可能受到烷基在催化剂表面激活的影响。未来的研究领域可能集中在改进催化剂设计以减少不希望的副反应并提高丙烯选择性。

文献讨论了VPO在甲烷、乙烷和丙烷氧溴化过程中的性能，强调了氧溴化反应温度起始顺序为甲烷>乙烷>丙烷，与CH键强度降低相吻合。这些信息可以作为参考点来理解与其它氧化剂相比VPO的相对有效性。
