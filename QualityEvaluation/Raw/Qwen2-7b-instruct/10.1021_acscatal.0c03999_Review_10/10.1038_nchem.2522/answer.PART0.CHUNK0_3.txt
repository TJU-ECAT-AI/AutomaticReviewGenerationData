Catalyst-design strategies to provide optimal synergy between these two processes are discussed. Among many investigated material families, vanadium phosphate (VPO) is identified as the best oxybromination catalyst, as it provides selectivity for CH3Br up to 95% and stable operation for over 100 hours on stream.
The emerging conventional and non-conventional natural-gas reserves,which contain copious amounts of methane (7599 mol%), but also of ethane (115 mol%) and propane (110 mol%), offer an exciting potential as a feedstock for value- added chemicals and fuels110.
The present study aims to develop an oxybromination process for the selective functionalization of methane through symbiosis between heterogeneously catalysed HBr oxidation and gas-phase alkane bromination, sustained by radicals continuously supplied from the bromine pool that is, in turn, regenerated on the catalyst surface by molecular oxygen.

The literature does not provide specific comparisons between sulfur-based oxidants and conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It focuses on the development of an oxybromination process for the selective functionalization of methane. However, it discusses the importance of natural gas reserves as a potential feedstock for value-added chemicals and fuels, and the challenges involved in selectively activating CH bonds in alkanes under mild conditions. The study identifies vanadium phosphate (VPO) as the best oxybromination catalyst, offering high selectivity for CH3Br and stable operation over extended periods. The process aims to integrate HBr oxidation and gas-phase alkane bromination, utilizing a bromine pool regenerated on the catalyst surface through molecular oxygen.

文献没有提供关于硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢到丙烯过程中的具体比较。它专注于开发一种用于甲烷选择性功能化的氧溴化过程，通过异相催化HBr氧化和气相烷烃溴化之间的共生作用，由不断从催化剂表面再生的自由基提供。文献讨论了天然气储备作为附加值化学品和燃料潜在原料的重要性，以及在温和条件下选择性激活烷烃中CH键的挑战。研究确定了磷酸钒（VPO）作为最佳氧溴化催化剂，具有高达95%的CH3Br选择性和超过100小时的稳定操作时间。该过程旨在整合HBr氧化和气相烷烃溴化，利用通过分子氧再生的溴池。
