Among many investigated material families, vanadium phosphate (VPO) is identified as the best oxybromination catalyst, as it provides selectivity for CH3Br up to 95% and stable operation for over 100 hours on stream.

The outstanding performance of VPO is rationalized by its high activity in HBr oxidation and low propensity for methane and bromomethane oxidation.

Data on the oxybromination of ethane and propane over VPO suggest that the reaction network for higher alkanes is more complex.

The emerging conventional and non-conventional natural-gas reserves, which contain copious amounts of methane (75-99 mol%), but also of ethane (11-50 mol%) and propane (1-10 mol%), offer an exciting potential as a feedstock for value-added chemicals and fuels.

However, currently less than 10% of the global natural-gas production is used for the manufacture of commodities and the rest is burned for heating, transport, and electricity-generation purposes.

The present study aims to develop an oxybromination process for the selective functionalization of methane through symbiosis between heterogeneously catalyzed HBr oxidation and gas-phase alkane bromination, sustained by radicals continuously supplied from the bromine pool that is, in turn, regenerated on the catalyst surface by molecular oxygen.

Owing to their stability and operational window, which generally coincides with that of the gas-phase alkane bromination, the above-mentioned HBr oxidation catalysts are interesting candidates to investigate in the oxybromination reaction.

The oxybromination tests performed over many phosphates show that, besides the previously reported FePO4 catalyst, Cu3(PO4)2, CrPO4, and VPO are highly active in this reaction.

The estimated experimental errors are indicated in Supplementary Table 1.

Other reaction conditions are provided in Methods.

The estimated experimental errors are indicated in Supplementary Table 1.

The conversion of methane as well as the product distribution remained unchanged over 100 hours on stream.

Nevertheless, NMR spectra demonstrated the presence of a small amount of V5+ even after 40 hours on stream.

An increase in crystallinity over reaction time was observed from XRD, 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analyses and is corroborated by a decrease of the total surface area of the used catalyst samples.

The only exception was CO formation in the latter process.

The addition of molecular oxygen to the bromination mixture did not change the product yields, except that some CO was observed at 745 K, which testifies to the absence of any inhibition by O2.

The functionalized bromomethanes are more prone to oxidize than methane, which leads to COx formation that predominantly occurs on the catalyst surface.

Based on our findings that the gas-phase methane bromination is the principal pathway of methane activation over the VPO catalyst and on the well-known kinetics of the bromination reaction, a methane-rich feed is expected to enhance the selectivity towards CH3Br as it reduces polybromination.

Indeed, an increase of the methane concentration in the inlet feed from about 4.5 to 10 vol% brought an increase of about double the CH3Br productivity and a 10% increase in its selectivity at 753 K.

By decreasing the Tbed to 693 K, the spacetime yield of CH3Br at 10 vol% of CH4 in the inlet feed was similar to that obtained with a 4.5 vol% methane feed content at a temperature 60 K higher.

To verify further the applicability of the VPO under realistic reactant-rich feeds, its performance was evaluated at increasing partial pressures of the reactants with their molar ratio kept constant.

The results for ethane and propane suggest that the reaction network is even more complex than that of methane, probably induced by the higher affinity of higher alkanes and the corresponding bromoalkanes to the catalyst surface.

The reaction network for higher alkanes is more complex due to the higher affinity of higher alkanes and their corresponding bromoalkanes to the catalyst surface, which influences the reaction pathways and product distributions.

The literature does not provide direct comparisons between sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) and conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, it does discuss the use of vanadium phosphate (VPO) as an effective oxybromination catalyst for the functionalization of methane, ethane, and propane. VPO provides high selectivity for CH3Br (up to 95%) and demonstrates stable operation for over 100 hours. The catalyst design strategies aim to achieve optimal synergy between the oxidation of HBr and the gas-phase alkane bromination. The literature also mentions the complexity of the reaction network for higher alkanes and the importance of controlling the spatiotemporal management of the heterogeneous gas-phase network.

The key challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP include the formation of byproducts and the specific challenges in catalyst design and optimization. For instance, the formation of CO and CO2 might be influenced by the activation of the alkane on the catalyst surface. Future research areas may focus on improving catalyst design to reduce unwanted side reactions and enhance the selectivity for propylene.

The literature discusses the performance of VPO in the oxybromination of methane, ethane, and propane, highlighting the temperature onset of the oxybromination reaction decreases in the order of methane > ethane > propane, correlating with the decrease in CH bond strength. This information can be used as a reference point for understanding the relative effectiveness of VPO compared to other oxidants in similar processes.

文献没有直接比较硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯过程中的效果。然而，它确实讨论了范德华磷酸盐（VPO）作为甲烷、乙烷和丙烷功能化过程的有效氧溴化催化剂。VPO提供了高达95%的CH3Br选择性，并且能够稳定运行超过100小时。催化剂设计策略旨在实现HBr氧化和气体相烷基溴化之间的最佳协同作用。文献还提到了更高烷烃反应网络复杂性的关键挑战以及对空间时间管理的重要性。

与硫基氧化剂相关的ODHP特定挑战包括副产品的形成以及催化剂设计和优化的具体挑战。例如，CO和CO2的形成可能受到烷基在催化剂表面激活的影响。未来的研究领域可能集中在改进催化剂设计以减少不希望的副反应并提高丙烯选择性。

文献讨论了VPO在甲烷、乙烷和丙烷氧溴化过程中的性能，强调了氧溴化反应温度起始顺序为甲烷>乙烷>丙烷，与CH键强度降低相吻合。这些信息可以作为参考点来理解与其它氧化剂相比VPO的相对有效性。

The emerging conventional and non-conventional natural-gas reserves, which contain copious amounts of methane (7599 mol%), but also of ethane (115 mol%) and propane (110 mol%), offer an exciting potential as a feedstock for value-added chemicals and fuels.

Different strategies to convert CH2Br2 into methyl bromide and higher hydrocarbons via reproportionation24 or catalytic hydrodebromination reprocesses25, or acetic acid and its derivates15, make this product yet to be utilized.

The estimated experimental errors are indicated in Supplementary Table 1.

The operational window of all the active catalysts, including those that were previously reported to catalyse this reaction, was advantageously shifted to temperatures at least 100 K lower than those in the earlier works on methane oxybromination1519.

The conversion of methane as well as the product distribution remained unchanged over 100 hours on stream (Fig. 3a).

Based on the mechanistic understanding of the reaction that comprises synergetic cooperation between the heterogeneous HBr oxidation and the gas-phase methane bromination, the productivity of CH3Br over a VPO catalyst was enhanced further by optimizing the reaction conditions, whereby a selectivity for CH3Br of above 90% was attained by increasing the feed partial pressure of methane.

The oxybromination of ethane and propane over VPO indicated a more-complex reaction network that comprised dehydropbromination and cracking of the brominated compounds.

The results for ethane and propane suggest that the reaction network is even more complex than that of methane, probably induced by the higher affinity of higher alkanes and the corresponding bromoalkanes to the catalyst surface.
