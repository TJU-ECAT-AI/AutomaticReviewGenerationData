Among many investigated material families, vanadium phosphate (VPO) is identified as the best oxybromination catalyst, as it provides selectivity for CH3Br up to 95% and stable operation for over 100 hours on stream.

The outstanding performance of VPO is rationalized by its high activity in HBr oxidation and low propensity for methane and bromomethane oxidation.

Data on the oxybromination of ethane and propane over VPO suggest that the reaction network for higher alkanes is more complex.

The emerging conventional and non-conventional natural-gas reserves, which contain copious amounts of methane (75-99 mol%), but also of ethane (11-50 mol%) and propane (1-10 mol%), offer an exciting potential as a feedstock for value-added chemicals and fuels.

However, currently less than 10% of the global natural-gas production is used for the manufacture of commodities and the rest is burned for heating, transport, and electricity-generation purposes.

The present study aims to develop an oxybromination process for the selective functionalization of methane through symbiosis between heterogeneously catalyzed HBr oxidation and gas-phase alkane bromination, sustained by radicals continuously supplied from the bromine pool that is, in turn, regenerated on the catalyst surface by molecular oxygen.

Owing to their stability and operational window, which generally coincides with that of the gas-phase alkane bromination, the above-mentioned HBr oxidation catalysts are interesting candidates to investigate in the oxybromination reaction.

The oxybromination tests performed over many phosphates show that, besides the previously reported FePO4 catalyst, Cu3(PO4)2, CrPO4, and VPO are highly active in this reaction.

The estimated experimental errors are indicated in Supplementary Table 1.

The estimated experimental errors are indicated in Supplementary Table 1.

The conversion of methane as well as the product distribution remained unchanged over 100 hours on stream.

Nevertheless, NMR spectra demonstrated the presence of a small amount of V5+ even after 40 hours on stream.

An increase in crystallinity over reaction time was observed from XRD, 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analyses and is corroborated by a decrease of the total surface area of the used catalyst samples.

The only exception was CO formation in the latter process.

The addition of molecular oxygen to the bromination mixture did not change the product yields, except that some CO was observed at 745 K, which testifies to the absence of any inhibition by O2.

The functionalized bromomethanes are more prone to oxidize than methane, which leads to COx formation that predominantly occurs on the catalyst surface.

Based on our findings that the gas-phase methane bromination is the principal pathway of methane activation over the VPO catalyst and on the well-known kinetics of the bromination reaction, a methane-rich feed is expected to enhance the selectivity towards CH3Br as it reduces polybromination.

Indeed, an increase of the methane concentration in the inlet feed from about 4.5 to 10 vol% brought an increase of about double the CH3Br productivity and a 10% increase in its selectivity at 753 K.

By decreasing the Tbed to 693 K, the spacetime yield of CH3Br at 10 vol% of CH4 in the inlet feed was similar to that obtained with a 4.5 vol% methane feed content at a temperature 60 K higher.

To verify further the applicability of the VPO under realistic reactant-rich feeds, its performance was evaluated at increasing partial pressures of the reactants with their molar ratio kept constant.

The results for ethane and propane suggest that the reaction network is even more complex than that of methane, probably induced by the higher affinity of higher alkanes and the corresponding bromoalkanes to the catalyst surface.

The reaction network for higher alkanes is more complex due to the higher affinity of higher alkanes and their corresponding bromoalkanes to the catalyst surface, which influences the reaction pathways and product distributions.
