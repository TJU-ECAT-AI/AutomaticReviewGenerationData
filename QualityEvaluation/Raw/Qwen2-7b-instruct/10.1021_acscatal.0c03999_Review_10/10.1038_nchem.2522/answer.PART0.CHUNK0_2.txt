Among many investigated material families, vanadium phosphate (VPO) is identified as the best oxybromination catalyst, as it provides selectivity for CH3Br up to 95% and stable operation for over 100 hours on stream.

The emerging conventional and non-conventional natural-gas reserves, which contain copious amounts of methane (7599 mol%), but also of ethane (115 mol%) and propane (110 mol%), offer an exciting potential as a feedstock for value-added chemicals and fuels.

Different strategies to convert CH2Br2 into methyl bromide and higher hydrocarbons via reproportionation24 or catalytic hydrodebromination reprocesses25, or acetic acid and its derivates15, make this product yet to be utilized.

The estimated experimental errors are indicated in Supplementary Table 1.

The operational window of all the active catalysts, including those that were previously reported to catalyse this reaction, was advantageously shifted to temperatures at least 100 K lower than those in the earlier works on methane oxybromination1519.

The conversion of methane as well as the product distribution remained unchanged over 100 hours on stream (Fig. 3a).

Based on the mechanistic understanding of the reaction that comprises synergetic cooperation between the heterogeneous HBr oxidation and the gas-phase methane bromination, the productivity of CH3Br over a VPO catalyst was enhanced further by optimizing the reaction conditions, whereby a selectivity for CH3Br of above 90% was attained by increasing the feed partial pressure of methane.

The oxybromination of ethane and propane over VPO indicated a more-complex reaction network that comprised dehydropbromination and cracking of the brominated compounds.

The results for ethane and propane suggest that the reaction network is even more complex than that of methane, probably induced by the higher affinity of higher alkanes and the corresponding bromoalkanes to the catalyst surface.
