Comparing different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, these sulfur-based oxidants showed distinct impacts on propylene yield. Each oxidant had specific challenges related to byproduct formation, which influenced the efficiency of the process. Future research focuses on improving catalyst design and optimizing the overall process by gaining deeper insights into the detailed reaction mechanisms and the effect of various sulfur-based oxidants.
