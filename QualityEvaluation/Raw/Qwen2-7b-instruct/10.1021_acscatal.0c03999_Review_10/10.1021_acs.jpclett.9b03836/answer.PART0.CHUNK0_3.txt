Comparing the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, these sulfur-based oxidants have a significant impact on propylene yield. They influence the formation of intermediates during the activation of propane by catalytic oxyhalogenation, leading to specific challenges such as the formation of sulfur compounds as byproducts. The conventional oxidants also play a crucial role in the process, contributing to the formation of propylene. Future research focuses on improving catalyst design and optimizing the overall process, particularly aiming to enhance selectivity towards propylene production and reduce byproduct formation.
