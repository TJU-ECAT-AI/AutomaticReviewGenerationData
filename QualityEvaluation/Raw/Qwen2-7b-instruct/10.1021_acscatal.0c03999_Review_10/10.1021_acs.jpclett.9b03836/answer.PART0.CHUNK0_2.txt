The study utilized operando photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy to investigate the mechanistic fingerprints of propane activation through catalytic oxyhalogenation. The research team comprised Guido Zichittella, Patrick Hemberger, Fabian Holzmeier, Andras Bodi, and Javier Prez-Ramrez. They focused on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, employing various sulfur-based oxidants such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfur (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Propylene yield served as a critical metric for evaluating the performance of these oxidants. Each oxidant presented specific challenges, notably the formation of byproducts. Future research directions aimed at enhancing catalyst design and optimizing the overall process were outlined.
