1. The catalyst surface area diminishes over time, alongside a noticeable imbalance regarding carbon, suggesting the creation of oxidative condensation products. 

2. The catalytic characteristics of the examined oxides are outlined in Table 1.

3. With identical reaction mixture compositions, the structure of OCP formed remains consistent (Table 2).

4. As propane traverses carbon, propylene is synthesized, with the formation quantity fluctuating minimally from pulse to pulse (Figure 2a).

5. Passing ROS and R pulses in sequence through the catalyst leads to an increased amount of propylene produced in R pulses, getting closer to the amount produced in ROS pulses.

6. The data imply that in selective propane oxidation with SO2, the substances resulting from oxidative condensation, including C, H, O, and elemental sulfur, serve as the active components.

1. 催化剂表面面积随时间减少，并且与碳的比例不平衡，表明氧化凝聚产物的形成。

2. 调查的氧化物的催化性质在表1中给出。

3. 与相同反应混合物组成相匹配，形成的OCP结构也保持相似（表2）。

4. 当丙烷通过碳时，生成丙烯，从脉冲到脉冲之间的生成量略有变化（图2a）。

5. 通过将ROS和R脉冲依次通过催化剂，R脉冲产生的丙烯量增加，接近ROS脉冲产生的量。

6. 数据表明，在选择性丙烷氧化与SO2的情况下，由氧化凝聚作用产生的包括C、H、O以及元素硫在内的物质作为活性成分。
