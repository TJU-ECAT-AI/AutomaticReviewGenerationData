Comparing sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the literature suggests that sulfur dioxide (SO2) is particularly effective. This is based on the fact that oxidative condensation products (OCPs) containing C, H, O, and S formed during reactions over Ga, AJ, Si oxides and carbon are active towards propylene formation. Sulfur dioxide does not enhance the activity when sulfidizing Fe, Bi, and Pb oxides. The mechanism of propylene formation over OCPs is outlined in the document. The study highlights that the catalytic properties of various oxides are presented in Table 1, and the composition of OCPs formed is consistent across identical reaction mixtures (Table 2). Carbon, being the primary component of OCPs, was studied for its catalytic properties. The decrease in catalyst surface area over time and the imbalance regarding carbon indicate the formation of oxidative condensation products. Before experiments, the catalyst was aged for 1 hour in a helium flow at 913 K. The activity of the catalyst was measured by the amount of propylene produced in a single propane pulse. The findings imply that in selective propane oxidation with SO2, the active species are the products of oxidative condensation containing C, H, O, and elemental sulfur.

在丙烷氧化成丙烯的过程中，与传统氧化剂相比，硫化物（H2S、S2和SO2）在氧化脱氢作用下的有效性得到了比较。文献表明，二氧化硫特别有效。这是基于以下事实：在Ga、AJ、Si氧化物和碳上进行反应时形成的氧化缩合产物（OCP），含有C、H、O、S，并且对丙烯形成具有活性。当硫化Fe、Bi、Pb氧化物时，二氧化硫没有增强其活性。文献中概述了不同氧化物的催化性质，并表示在相同的反应混合物下形成的OCP组成是一致的（表2）。碳作为OCP的主要成分，被研究其催化性质。催化剂表面面积随时间减少以及碳的不平衡显示了氧化缩合产物的形成。实验前，催化剂在913 K的氦气流中老化了1小时。催化剂活性通过单个丙烷脉冲产生的丙烯量来衡量。研究结果表明，在选择性丙烷氧化中使用SO2，活性物种是包含C、H、O和元素硫的氧化缩合产物。
