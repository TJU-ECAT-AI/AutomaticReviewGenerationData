[1] "The catalyst surface area decreases with time and disbalance with respect to carbon is observed, which Indicates the formation of oxidative condensation products."
[2] "The result obtained is in agreement with (ref. 3) indicating"
[3] "Since carbon was the main component of OCP, it was of interest to study catalytic properties of a carbon system."
[4] "As propane passes through carbon, propylene is formed, the amount of which changes slightly from pulse to pulse (Fig. 2a)."
[5] "At passing ROS and R pulses in turn through the catalyst the amount of propylene formed in R pulses increases, thus becoming closer to that for ROS pulses."
[6] "Taking into account the observed composition of reaction products and rate dependence, the scheme for propylene formation can be presented as follows:1. 2. 3. 4. 5."
