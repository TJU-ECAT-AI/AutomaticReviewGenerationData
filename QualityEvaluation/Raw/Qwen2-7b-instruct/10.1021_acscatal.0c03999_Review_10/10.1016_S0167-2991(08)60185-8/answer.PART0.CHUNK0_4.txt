1. The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene varies significantly. Among these, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is more effective than hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and elemental sulfur (S) in enhancing propylene yield. SO2 leads to a more pronounced increase in propylene yield, especially when sulfur content on the catalyst surface is increased. 

2. Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP include byproduct formation, such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) which is not desired in the final product. This byproduct can complicate separation processes and affect the overall efficiency of the process. 

3. Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design to minimize byproduct formation while maximizing propylene yield. This includes developing more efficient ways to incorporate sulfur onto the catalyst surface without generating unwanted byproducts. Additionally, studying the mechanisms of sulfur stabilization on the catalyst surface could lead to improvements in the selectivity and activity of the catalysts.

4. The separation of sulfur from the catalyst and reactants is a significant challenge in ODHP. The development of effective and efficient separation techniques, possibly incorporating novel materials or processes, is crucial for the practical implementation of this technology.

5. The role of sulfur stabilized on the surface of oxidative condensation products is pivotal in the propylene formation process. Further investigation into the precise role of this stabilized sulfur in the reaction mechanism could lead to a better understanding of the process and guide the development of improved catalysts.

6. Gas-phase sulfur, produced as a reaction product, can potentially be utilized for dehydrating propane at high temperatures. However, its use requires further investigation into the feasibility and efficiency of this application within the ODHP process.

1. 不同的硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯（ODHP）过程中的有效性存在显著差异。其中，二氧化硫（SO2）比氢硫酸（H2S）和单质硫（S）更有效地提高了丙烯产率。SO2导致丙烯产率增加更为明显，尤其是当催化剂表面的硫含量增加时。

2. 在ODHP过程中与硫基氧化剂相关的挑战包括副产品的形成，如氢硫酸（H2S），这不是最终产品的所需成分。这种副产品会复杂化分离过程并影响整个过程的效率。

3. 未来的研究应集中在优化催化剂设计以最大限度地减少副产物形成的同时提高丙烯产率。这包括开发更有效的方法在催化剂表面上引入硫，同时避免生成不必要的副产品。此外，研究硫稳定在催化剂表面的作用机制可以指导催化剂的改进和发展。

4. 分离硫从催化剂和反应物是ODHP过程中的一个重要挑战。开发有效的且高效的分离技术，可能需要结合新型材料或过程，对于此技术的实用实施至关重要。

5. 催化剂表面的硫稳定在氧化性凝缩产物中的作用在丙烯形成过程中至关重要。进一步研究这种稳定硫在反应机制中的精确作用，可以更好地理解该过程，并指导催化剂的发展。

6. 作为反应产物产生的气相硫有可能用于在高温下脱水丙烷。然而，其在ODHP过程中的应用需要进一步研究其可行性和效率。
