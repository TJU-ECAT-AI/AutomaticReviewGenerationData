Comparing sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the literature suggests that sulfur dioxide (SO2) is particularly effective. This is based on the fact that oxidative condensation products (OCPs) containing C, H, O, and S formed during reactions over Ga, AJ, Si oxides and carbon are active towards propylene formation. Sulfur dioxide does not enhance the activity when sulfidizing Fe, Bi, and Pb oxides. The mechanism of propylene formation over OCPs is outlined in the document. The study highlights that the catalytic properties of various oxides are presented in Table 1, and the composition of OCPs formed is consistent across identical reaction mixtures (Table 2). Carbon, being the primary component of OCPs, was studied for its catalytic properties. The decrease in catalyst surface area over time and the imbalance regarding carbon indicate the formation of oxidative condensation products. Before experiments, the catalyst was aged for 1 hour in a helium flow at 913 K. The activity of the catalyst was measured by the amount of propylene produced in a single propane pulse. The findings imply that in selective propane oxidation with SO2, the active species are the products of oxidative condensation containing C, H, O, and elemental sulfur.

在丙烷氧化成丙烯的过程中，与传统氧化剂相比，硫化物（H2S、S2和SO2）在氧化脱氢作用下的有效性得到了比较。文献表明，二氧化硫特别有效。这是基于以下事实：在Ga、AJ、Si氧化物和碳上进行反应时形成的氧化缩合产物（OCP），含有C、H、O、S，并且对丙烯形成具有活性。当硫化Fe、Bi、Pb氧化物时，二氧化硫没有增强其活性。文献中概述了不同氧化物的催化性质，并表示在相同的反应混合物下形成的OCP组成是一致的（表2）。碳作为OCP的主要成分，被研究其催化性质。催化剂表面面积随时间减少以及碳的不平衡显示了氧化缩合产物的形成。实验前，催化剂在913 K的氦气流中老化了1小时。催化剂活性通过单个丙烷脉冲产生的丙烯量来衡量。研究结果表明，在选择性丙烷氧化中使用SO2，活性物种是包含C、H、O和元素硫的氧化缩合产物。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene varies significantly. Among these, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is more effective than hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and elemental sulfur (S) in enhancing propylene yield. SO2 leads to a more pronounced increase in propylene yield, especially when sulfur content on the catalyst surface is increased. 

2. Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP include byproduct formation, such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) which is not desired in the final product. This byproduct can complicate separation processes and affect the overall efficiency of the process. 

3. Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design to minimize byproduct formation while maximizing propylene yield. This includes developing more efficient ways to incorporate sulfur onto the catalyst surface without generating unwanted byproducts. Additionally, studying the mechanisms of sulfur stabilization on the catalyst surface could lead to improvements in the selectivity and activity of the catalysts.

4. The separation of sulfur from the catalyst and reactants is a significant challenge in ODHP. The development of effective and efficient separation techniques, possibly incorporating novel materials or processes, is crucial for the practical implementation of this technology.

5. The role of sulfur stabilized on the surface of oxidative condensation products is pivotal in the propylene formation process. Further investigation into the precise role of this stabilized sulfur in the reaction mechanism could lead to a better understanding of the process and guide the development of improved catalysts.

6. Gas-phase sulfur, produced as a reaction product, can potentially be utilized for dehydrating propane at high temperatures. However, its use requires further investigation into the feasibility and efficiency of this application within the ODHP process.

1. 不同的硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯（ODHP）过程中的有效性存在显著差异。其中，二氧化硫（SO2）比氢硫酸（H2S）和单质硫（S）更有效地提高了丙烯产率。SO2导致丙烯产率增加更为明显，尤其是当催化剂表面的硫含量增加时。

2. 在ODHP过程中与硫基氧化剂相关的挑战包括副产品的形成，如氢硫酸（H2S），这不是最终产品的所需成分。这种副产品会复杂化分离过程并影响整个过程的效率。

3. 未来的研究应集中在优化催化剂设计以最大限度地减少副产物形成的同时提高丙烯产率。这包括开发更有效的方法在催化剂表面上引入硫，同时避免生成不必要的副产品。此外，研究硫稳定在催化剂表面的作用机制可以指导催化剂的改进和发展。

4. 分离硫从催化剂和反应物是ODHP过程中的一个重要挑战。开发有效的且高效的分离技术，可能需要结合新型材料或过程，对于此技术的实用实施至关重要。

5. 催化剂表面的硫稳定在氧化性凝缩产物中的作用在丙烯形成过程中至关重要。进一步研究这种稳定硫在反应机制中的精确作用，可以更好地理解该过程，并指导催化剂的发展。

6. 作为反应产物产生的气相硫有可能用于在高温下脱水丙烷。然而，其在ODHP过程中的应用需要进一步研究其可行性和效率。
