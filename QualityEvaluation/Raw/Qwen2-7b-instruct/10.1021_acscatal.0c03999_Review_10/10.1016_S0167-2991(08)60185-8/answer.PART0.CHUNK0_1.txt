[1] "In the initial period of reaction CS2 and H2S were formed on a number of catalysts."
[2] "For identical reaction mixture compositions, the composition of OCP formed is also similar (Table 2 )."
[3] "As propane passes through carbon,propylene is formed, the amount of which changes slightly from pulse to pulse (Fig. 2a)."
[4] "At passing ROS and R pulses in turn through the catalyst the amount of propylene formed in R pulses increases,thus becoming closer to that for ROS pulses."
[5] "Independent of treatment conditions,only one state of sulphur corresponding to So elementary sulphur was detected by ESCA."

1. In the initial stages of the reaction, CS2 and H2S were produced on various catalysts.
2. With the same reaction mixture composition, the composition of oxidative condensation products (OCP) generated remains consistent (Table 2).
3. When propane moves through carbon, propylene is synthesized, with the yield varying slightly between pulses (Figure 2a).
4. Passing ROS and R pulses sequentially through the catalyst leads to an increased propylene yield in R pulses, approaching the yield observed in ROS pulses.
5. Regardless of the treatment method, only one state of sulfur, corresponding to elemental sulfur, is detected on the carbon surface (ESCA data).

6. Treating the catalyst with sulfur vapor significantly increases propylene formation rate.
7. There is no hydrogen sulfide in the reaction products.
8. Irrespective of how the catalyst is treated—using sulfur fumes, propane and sulfur dioxide mixture, or sulfur dioxide alone—the XPS method reveals a single state of sulfur corresponding to propylene formation, which is proportional to the sulfur quantity on the surface.
9. Under experimental conditions, there are no gas-phase reactions involving CH38 + 1/2 S + H20.

7. 反应产物中没有氢硫化物。
8. 不论采用何种方式处理催化剂——使用硫蒸气、丙烷与二氧化硫的混合物，还是单独使用二氧化硫——XPS方法显示存在一种与丙烯形成相对应的硫状态，该状态与表面硫量成正比。

Compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, discussing their impact on propylene yield, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant (including byproduct formation), and the key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.
