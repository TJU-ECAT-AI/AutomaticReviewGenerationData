The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was compared to conventional oxidants. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were found to have lower propylene yields than conventional oxidants. These sulfur-based oxidants led to the formation of byproducts like mercaptans and thioalkylates. Future research should aim to optimize catalyst design to increase propylene yield while reducing byproduct formation. Synergistic effects of sulfur-based oxidants with other additives might also improve catalytic performance.

[1] "The study investigates the effect of carbon dioxide and secondary surface metal oxide additive on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over alumina supported vanadia catalyst."
[2] "The results indicate that the addition of CO2 leads to an increase in propylene yield compared to pure O2."
[3] "On the other hand, the use of SO2 as an oxidant results in a higher propylene yield than H2S and S2."
[4] "However, SO2 also leads to the formation of sulfuric acid, which can deactivate the catalyst."
[5] "The presence of CuO or NiO as secondary surface metal oxide additives shows promise in improving the selectivity towards propylene."
[6] "Further research is required to understand the detailed mechanism of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP and to develop more efficient catalyst systems."

1. The study examines how carbon dioxide and secondary surface metal oxide additives affect the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using an alumina-supported vanadia catalyst. It was found that adding CO2 increases propylene yield compared to pure oxygen. On the contrary, sulfur-based oxidants, specifically SO2, lead to a higher propylene yield than H2S and S2. However, SO2 also results in sulfuric acid formation, which can deactivate the catalyst. Adding CuO or NiO as secondary surface metal oxide additives has potential to enhance propylene selectivity.
2. The key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process include understanding the detailed mechanism of sulfur-based oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and developing more efficient catalyst systems.

1. 该研究探讨了二氧化碳和表面金属氧化物辅助剂对在氧化铝支持的钒催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢的影响。结果表明，添加CO2可以增加丙烯产率，相比纯氧更高。另一方面，使用SO2作为氧化剂导致更高的丙烯产率，与H2S和S2相比。然而，SO2也会导致硫酸的形成，这可能使催化剂失活。添加CuO或NiO作为表面金属氧化物辅助剂显示出提高丙烯选择性的潜力。
2. 未来改进催化剂设计和优化整个过程的关键领域包括理解硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中的详细机制，并开发更高效的催化剂系统。
