The study examined the use of alumina-supported vanadia catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Various sulfur-based oxidants such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were incorporated into the catalysts. These oxidants influenced propylene yield, while byproducts were also assessed. Challenges related to each oxidant, particularly concerning catalyst stability and selectivity, were identified. Future research aims to refine catalyst design to improve propylene production efficiency and reduce byproduct formation.
