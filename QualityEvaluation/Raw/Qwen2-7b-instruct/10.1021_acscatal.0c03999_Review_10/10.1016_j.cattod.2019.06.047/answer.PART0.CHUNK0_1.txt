The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was compared to conventional oxidants. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were found to have lower propylene yields than conventional oxidants. These sulfur-based oxidants led to the formation of byproducts like mercaptans and thioalkylates. Future research should aim to optimize catalyst design to increase propylene yield while reducing byproduct formation. Synergistic effects of sulfur-based oxidants with other additives might also improve catalytic performance.

在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）到丙烯的过程中，不同硫基氧化剂与常规氧化剂的有效性进行了比较。发现氢硫酸（H2S）、二硫化物（S2）和二氧化硫（SO2）的丙烯产量低于常规氧化剂。这些硫基氧化剂导致了如硫醇和硫代烷基化合物等副产品的形成。未来的研究应致力于优化催化剂设计以提高丙烯产量并减少副产品的形成。同时，探索硫基氧化剂与其他添加剂的协同作用也可能改善催化性能。
