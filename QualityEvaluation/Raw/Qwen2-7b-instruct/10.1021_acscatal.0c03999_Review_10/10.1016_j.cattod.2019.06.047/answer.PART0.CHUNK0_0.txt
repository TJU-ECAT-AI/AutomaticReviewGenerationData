Comparing sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, this study reveals that these sulfur-based oxidants influence propylene yield differently. Challenges such as byproduct formation accompany their use, necessitating further investigation into catalyst design optimization to enhance the overall process efficiency.
