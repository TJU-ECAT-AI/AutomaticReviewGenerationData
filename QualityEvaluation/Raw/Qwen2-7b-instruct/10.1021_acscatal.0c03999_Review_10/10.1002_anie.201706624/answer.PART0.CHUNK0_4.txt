[1] "Currently, these olefins are produced by steam cracking, fluid-catalytic cracking, and/or catalytic dehydrogenation, all of which are highly capital- and energy-intensive and are unable to close the growing gap between their demand and manufacture."
[2] "EuOCl is able to process mixtures of methane, ethane, and propane to produce the olefins, thereby reducing separation costs of the alkanes in natural gas."
[3] "The performance of EuOCl was rationalized by 1)its balanced redox properties, which allow functionalization of the alkane and avoidance of combustion, and by 2)its unpaired ability to dehydrochlorinate the formed alkyl chloride to yield the olefin, thus enabling the recycling of the halogen source."
[4] "Titanium oxide anatase was identified as the best support for ethylene production, and maintained the outstanding performance for over 150hours on stream at both increased reactant partial pressure and by having a co-feed of water."

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is not directly compared with conventional oxidants in the provided literature. The focus is on the development of a catalyst, EuOCl, for the oxychlorination of ethane and propane to produce olefins. Challenges associated with each oxidant, such as byproduct formation, are not discussed in this context. For future research, the key areas are improving catalyst design and optimizing the overall process, particularly focusing on heat management, products separation, reactor design, and the use of EuOCl in extrudate form with scalable carriers.

In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 are not mentioned as alternatives to conventional oxidants. The literature does not provide specifics on the challenges related to these oxidants or how they compare to conventional ones in terms of propylene yield or byproduct formation. The focus is on the development of a catalyst, EuOCl, for the oxychlorination of ethane and propane, rather than on sulfur-based oxidants in the context of ODHP.

The literature does not provide data on the comparison of sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The focus is on the development and application of a new catalyst, EuOCl, for the oxychlorination process, which involves the reaction of an alkane with hydrogen chloride (HCl) and oxygen, aiming to produce olefins efficiently. The catalyst's performance is attributed to its balanced redox properties and its ability to recycle the halogen source. Future research directions include scaling up the catalyst in extrudate form using widely available carriers, particularly focusing on titanium oxide anatase as the best support for ethylene production.

The key areas for future research are improving catalyst design, optimizing the overall process, addressing heat management, and products separation, particularly in relation to the use of EuOCl in extrudate form with carriers such as titanium oxide anatase. The literature does not provide a direct comparison between sulfur-based oxidants and conventional oxidants in the context of propylene production through oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
