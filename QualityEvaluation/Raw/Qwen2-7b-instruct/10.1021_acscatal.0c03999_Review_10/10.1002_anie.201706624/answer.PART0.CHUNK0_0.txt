[1] "The performance of EuOCl was rationalized by 1)its balanced redox properties, which allow functionalization of the alkane and avoidance of combustion, and by 2)its unpaired ability to dehydrochlorinate the formed alkyl chloride to yield the olefin, thus enabling the recycling of the halogen source."
[2] "Moreover, EuOCl is also able to selectively process mixtures of methane, ethane, and propane to produce ethylene and propylene."
[3] "Finally, we demonstrated the scalability of the EuOCl-based catalyst in extrudate form using widely available carriers. Titanium oxide anatase was identified as the best support for ethylene production, and maintained the outstanding performance for over 150hours on stream at both increased reactant partial pressure and by having a co-feed of water."

The effectiveness of the europium oxychloride (EuOCl) catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) of propane to propylene was compared with other sulfur-based oxidants and conventional oxidants. EuOCl showed exceptional performance, achieving the highest single-pass yields of propylene (40%) among reported technologies. Its performance was attributed to its balanced redox properties, which enable functionalization of the alkane without combustion, and its unique ability to dehydrochlorinate the formed alkyl chloride, allowing for the recycling of the halogen source. Additionally, EuOCl can selectively process mixtures of methane, ethane, and propane to produce ethylene and propylene. Titanium oxide anatase was identified as the best support for ethylene production, maintaining outstanding performance for over 150 hours even under challenging conditions with increased reactant partial pressure and a co-feed of water.

欧铕氧化氯（EuOCl）催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯的有效性与其它硫基氧化剂和常规氧化剂进行了比较。EuOCl表现出极佳的性能，实现了报告技术中最高的单次通过丙烯产率（40%）。其性能归因于其平衡的氧化还原性质，这使得烷烃的功能化而不发生燃烧，并且它具有独特的将形成的烷基氯化物脱氯化的能力，从而允许卤素源的循环利用。此外，EuOCl能够选择性地处理甲烷、乙烷和丙烷的混合物以生产乙烯和丙烯。钛酸氧化铝被确定为最适合作为乙烯生产的支撑体，在增加反应物分压和水共喂养的情况下，维持了超过150小时的出色性能。
