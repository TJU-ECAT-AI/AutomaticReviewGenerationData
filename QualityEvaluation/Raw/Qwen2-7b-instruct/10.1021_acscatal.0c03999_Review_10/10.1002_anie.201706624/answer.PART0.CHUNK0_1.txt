[1] "The performance of EuOCl was rationalized by 1)its balanced redox properties, which allow functionalization of the alkane and avoidance of combustion, and by 2)its unpaired ability to dehydrochlorinate the formed alkyl chloride to yield the olefin, thus enabling the recycling of the halogen source."
[2] "We have assessed the stability of EuOCl, and demonstrated its robustness in preserving the outstanding performance for over 100hours on stream in both EOC and POC (see FigureS3), as well as its bulk structure (see FigureS3), whereas a slight increase in the crystallinity of the sample was evidenced from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and by a small decrease in the total surface area (see FigureS3)."
[3] "Moreover, EuOCl is also able to selectively process mixtures of methane, ethane, and propane to produce ethylene and propylene."
[4] "Titanium oxide anatase was identified as the best support for ethylene production, and maintained the outstanding performance for over 150hours on stream at both increased reactant partial pressure and by having a co-feed of water."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is not directly addressed in the literature. However, the literature discusses the use of sulfur-containing compounds in the oxychlorination process for the production of olefins, focusing on the role of sulfur-containing compounds in the dehydrochlorination step. For the ODHP process, conventional oxidants such as oxygen or air are typically used. The challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants in this context are not specified, nor are they compared to conventional oxidants in terms of propylene yield or byproduct formation. The key areas for future research would involve optimizing the catalyst design to enhance propylene yield while minimizing byproducts and improving the process efficiency and economics.

The literature highlights the effectiveness of the europium oxychloride (EuOCl) catalyst in the oxychlorination of ethane and propane for the production of olefins. It demonstrates that EuOCl enables selective functionalization of the alkane, avoids combustion, and efficiently dehydrochlorinates the formed alkyl chloride to yield the olefin. The catalyst maintains high performance over extended periods under various conditions, including increased reactant partial pressure and co-feeding of water. The use of titanium oxide anatase as a support for the EuOCl catalyst enhances its performance in ethylene production, with the catalyst showing robustness and stability in long-term testing.

In summary, while the literature does not provide a direct comparison between sulfur-based oxidants and conventional oxidants in the ODHP process, it showcases the advantages of using the europium oxychloride catalyst in the oxychlorination of alkanes for olefin production, including enhanced selectivity, stability, and the ability to handle alkane mixtures. Future research could focus on developing more efficient catalysts and process conditions for the ODHP process, particularly concerning the optimization of sulfur-based oxidants and the enhancement of propylene yield and selectivity.

在文献中，并未直接比较不同硫基氧化剂在丙烷脱氢氧化（ODHP）制丙烯过程中的效果，而是讨论了硫化合物在氯化氧过程中生产烯烃的作用，特别是在氯化步骤中的作用。对于ODHP过程，通常使用常规氧化剂如氧气或空气。关于硫基氧化剂在这一背景下的挑战，以及与常规氧化剂相比，在丙烯产率和副产物形成方面的差异并未在文献中提及。未来研究的关键领域将涉及优化催化剂设计以提高丙烯产率，同时减少副产物的产生，并提高工艺效率和经济性。

文献强调了铕氧氯化物（EuOCl）催化剂在乙烷和丙烷的氯化氧反应中生产烯烃的有效性。它证明EuOCl能够选择性地对烷烃进行功能化，避免燃烧，并高效地脱氯化生成的烷基氯化物以生成烯烃。该催化剂在各种条件下保持高性能，包括增加反应物分压和水共喂养。钛酸性氧化物作为EuOCl催化剂的支持物增强了其在乙烯生产的性能，并在长时间测试中显示出稳定性和稳定性。

总之，虽然文献没有提供硫基氧化剂与常规氧化剂在ODHP过程中的直接比较，但它展示了使用铕氧氯化物催化剂在烷烃氯化氧反应中生产烯烃的优势，包括增强的选择性、稳定性和处理烷烃混合物的能力。未来的研究可以集中在优化硫基氧化剂和提高丙烯产率和选择性的ODHP过程方面。
