[1] "The performance of EuOCl was rationalized by 1)its balanced redox properties, which allow functionalization of the alkane and avoidance of combustion, and by 2)its unpaired ability to dehydrochlorinate the formed alkyl chloride to yield the olefin, thus enabling the recycling of the halogen source."
[2] "Moreover, EuOCl is also able to selectively process mixtures of methane, ethane, and propane to produce ethylene and propylene."
[3] "Finally, we demonstrated the scalability of the EuOCl-based catalyst in extrudate form using widely available carriers. Titanium oxide anatase was identified as the best support for ethylene production, and maintained the outstanding performance for over 150hours on stream at both increased reactant partial pressure and by having a co-feed of water."

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is compared with conventional oxidants in the literature. However, the document does not provide a direct comparison between these sulfur-based oxidants and conventional ones in terms of propylene yield, specific challenges, or byproduct formation. It focuses on the development and performance of a europium oxychloride (EuOCl) catalyst for the oxychlorination of ethane and propane to produce ethylene and propylene, highlighting its advantages in terms of balanced redox properties, ability to dehydrochlorinate alkyl chloride, recycling of halogen source, and processing of alkane mixtures. The scalability of the EuOCl-based catalyst in extrudate form using titanium oxide anatase as the best support for ethylene production is also mentioned. Future research directions related to catalyst design and optimization of the overall process are not discussed in this context.

文献中比较了硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯过程中的效果与传统氧化剂，但并未直接比较这些硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烯产率、特定挑战或副产品形成方面的差异。相反，它着重介绍了用于乙烷和丙烷的氧氯化生产乙烯和丙烯的铕氧氯化物（EuOCl）催化剂的有效性，强调其平衡的氧化还原性质、能够脱氯化烷基以生成烯烃的能力、卤素源的回收以及对烷烃混合物的处理能力。此外，还提到了EuOCl基催化剂在使用钛酸态二氧化钛作为最佳乙烯生产载体的挤出形式下的可扩展性，并保持了长达150小时的优异性能，在增加反应物分压和使用水共流的情况下。关于催化剂设计优化和整体过程优化的未来研究方向在此上下文中未被讨论。
