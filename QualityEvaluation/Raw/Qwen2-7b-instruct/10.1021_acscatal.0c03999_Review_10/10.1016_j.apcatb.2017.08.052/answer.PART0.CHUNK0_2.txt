1. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, sulfur-based oxidants, including hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfur disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), were evaluated. H2S was identified as the most effective oxidant in terms of propylene yield, albeit with higher byproduct formation.
2. The study encountered challenges such as byproduct formation, energy consumption, and potential corrosion in the reactor when using sulfur-based oxidants. These challenges were particularly pronounced with H2S, which resulted in higher byproducts compared to S2 and SO2.
3. Future research efforts aim to enhance the ODHP process by improving catalyst design, optimizing the process, and finding ways to minimize byproduct formation and address the other mentioned challenges. The goal is to increase propylene yield while ensuring efficient operation and reducing environmental impact.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯（ODHP）的过程中，研究了硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）作为传统氧化剂的替代品。H2S在产丙烯量方面表现出最佳效果，但同时也带来了较高的副产物形成问题。
2. 使用硫基氧化剂时遇到的挑战包括副产物形成、能源消耗和反应器中的潜在腐蚀问题。H2S的副产物形成特别多，相比之下，S2和SO2的副产物形成较少。
3. 未来的研究致力于通过改进催化剂设计、优化工艺流程，并寻找减少副产物形成的方法来解决上述挑战。目标是在确保高效运行的同时，提高丙烯产率并减少对环境的影响。
