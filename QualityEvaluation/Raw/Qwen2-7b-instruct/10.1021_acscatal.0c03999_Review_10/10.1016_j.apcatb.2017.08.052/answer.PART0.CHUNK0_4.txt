Comparing sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, these sulfur-based oxidants have proven effective. However, they each come with distinct challenges. H2S can lead to hydrogen sulfide byproducts, S2 might produce disulfides, and SO2 can result in sulfur deposition, impacting catalyst activity. The key areas for future research focus on enhancing catalyst design and optimizing the overall process.
