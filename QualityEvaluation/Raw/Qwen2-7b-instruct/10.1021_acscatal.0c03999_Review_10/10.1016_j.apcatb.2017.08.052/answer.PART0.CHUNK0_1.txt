The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene has been explored using sulfur-based oxidants, including hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). These oxidants have demonstrated potential in enhancing propylene yield compared to conventional oxidants. However, each sulfur-based oxidant comes with its own set of challenges. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can cause the formation of elemental sulfur, necessitating extra processing. Disulfide (S2) may decompose during the reaction, leading to reduced yield and increased process complexity. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) might result in sulfuric acid formation, impacting catalyst stability and selectivity. Future research focuses on creating more effective catalyst designs to address these issues and maximize propylene production.

氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）用于生产丙烯，已经使用了硫基氧化剂，包括氢硫酸（H2S）、二硫化物（S2）和二氧化硫（SO2）。这些氧化剂在与传统氧化剂相比时，在提高丙烯产率方面显示出潜力。然而，每一种硫基氧化剂都伴随着自己的挑战。氢硫酸（H2S）可能导致元素硫的形成，需要额外的处理步骤。二硫化物（S2）可能在反应中分解，导致产量降低和过程复杂性增加。二氧化硫（SO2）还可能导致硫酸的形成，影响催化剂的稳定性和选择性。未来的研究集中在开发更有效的催化剂设计，以解决这些问题并最大化丙烯产量。
