[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene has been widely studied due to its potential for producing high-value hydrocarbons with fewer environmental impacts than traditional methods."
[2] "In this study, we investigate the use of sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) in comparison to conventional oxidants in ODHP reactions."
[3] "The presence of sulfur-based oxidants in the reaction mixture led to an increase in propylene yield compared to the use of conventional oxidants."
[4] "However, the use of these sulfur-based oxidants also resulted in the formation of sulfur-containing byproducts, which can pose challenges for downstream processing."
[5] "Future research directions aim to optimize catalyst design to enhance propylene yield while minimizing the formation of byproducts."

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene was investigated in this study. These sulfur-based oxidants were found to increase propylene yield compared to conventional oxidants. However, they also led to the formation of sulfur-containing byproducts, presenting challenges for downstream processing. Future research focuses on optimizing catalyst design to improve propylene yield and minimize byproduct formation.
