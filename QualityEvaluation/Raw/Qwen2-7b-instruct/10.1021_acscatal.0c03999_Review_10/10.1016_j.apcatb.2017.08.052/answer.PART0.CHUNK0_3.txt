The study compared the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) demonstrated the highest propylene yield, while sulfur dioxide (SO2) resulted in substantial sulfuric acid byproduct formation. Sulfur disulfide (S2) had lower propylene yields compared to H2S. Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants include byproduct formation and catalyst instability. Future research focuses on enhancing catalyst design to increase propylene yield and reduce byproducts.

研究比较了不同硫基氧化剂在丙烷（ODHP）氧化脱氢为丙烯中的效果。氢硫酸（H2S）表现出最高的丙烯产率，而二氧化硫（SO2）导致大量硫酸副产品的形成。硫二硫化物（S2）的丙烯产率低于H2S。硫基氧化剂的使用面临由副产品形成和催化剂稳定性问题。未来的研究方向集中在改进催化剂设计，以提高丙烯产率并减少副产品的产生。
