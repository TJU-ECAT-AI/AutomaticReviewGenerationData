The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene has been explored using sulfur-based oxidants, including hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). These oxidants have demonstrated potential in enhancing propylene yield compared to conventional oxidants. However, each sulfur-based oxidant comes with its own set of challenges. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can cause the formation of elemental sulfur, necessitating extra processing. Disulfide (S2) may decompose during the reaction, leading to reduced yield and increased process complexity. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) might result in sulfuric acid formation, impacting catalyst stability and selectivity. Future research focuses on creating more effective catalyst designs to address these issues and maximize propylene production.
