Comparing sulfur-based oxidants such as H2S, S2, and SO2 with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, these sulfur-based oxidants demonstrate distinct advantages. Each oxidant presents unique challenges concerning byproduct formation, impacting the propylene yield differently. Future research focuses on improving catalyst design and optimizing the overall process of ODHP.
