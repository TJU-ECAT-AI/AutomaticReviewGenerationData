The study investigates the use of CO2 as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over Cr/ZrO2 catalysts. The presence of CO2 significantly affects the selectivity towards propylene. Sulfur-based oxidants, including H2S, S2, and SO2, are compared to conventional oxidants in terms of their impact on propylene yield. Among these, SO2 is found to be the most effective sulfur-based oxidant, yielding higher propylene compared to H2S and S2. However, its use results in the formation of more byproducts, indicating a trade-off between propylene yield and product purity. The specific challenges include byproduct formation and potential catalyst poisoning. Future research focuses on improving catalyst design to minimize byproduct formation and enhancing propylene selectivity. Optimizing the overall process involves developing more efficient catalysts and better control strategies for reaction conditions.

研究调查了CO2作为氧化剂在Cr/ZrO2催化剂上进行丙烷氧化脱氢化的情况。CO2的存在显著影响了丙烯的选择性。硫基氧化剂，包括H2S、S2和SO2，与传统氧化剂进行了比较，以评估它们对丙烯产率的影响。其中，SO2被发现是最有效的硫基氧化剂，其产生的丙烯量高于H2S和S2。然而，使用SO2会导致更多的副产品形成，表明了产量和产品质量之间的权衡。具体挑战包括副产品的形成和催化剂中毒的可能性。未来的研究旨在通过改进催化剂设计来减少副产品形成并提高丙烯选择性。优化整体过程涉及开发更高效的催化剂和更好的反应条件控制策略。
