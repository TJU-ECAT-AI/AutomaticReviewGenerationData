The study investigates the use of CO2 as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over Cr/ZrO2 catalysts. The presence of CO2 significantly affects the selectivity towards propylene. Sulfur-based oxidants, including H2S, S2, and SO2, are compared to conventional oxidants in terms of their impact on propylene yield. Among these, SO2 is found to be the most effective sulfur-based oxidant, yielding higher propylene compared to H2S and S2. However, its use results in the formation of more byproducts, indicating a trade-off between propylene yield and product purity. The specific challenges include byproduct formation and potential catalyst poisoning. Future research focuses on improving catalyst design to minimize byproduct formation and enhancing propylene selectivity. Optimizing the overall process involves developing more efficient catalysts and better control strategies for reaction conditions.
