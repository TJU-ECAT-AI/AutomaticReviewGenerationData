1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been recognized as a promising method for producing propylene, with studies focusing on the impact of CO2 in the reaction over Cr/ZrO2 catalysts. In comparison with conventional oxidants, sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 were utilized in the ODHP of propane to propylene, showing higher propylene yields. However, these sulfur-based oxidants resulted in the formation of byproducts such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide, necessitating extra treatment steps to eliminate them from the product stream. Future research aims to enhance catalyst efficiency and refine process conditions to reduce byproduct formation.

1. 烷氧脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）作为一种生产丙烯的有吸引力的替代方法，已经引起了人们的关注。本研究探讨了CO2在Cr/ZrO2催化剂上对丙烷氧化脱氢的影响。与传统氧化剂相比，使用硫基氧化剂如H2S、S2和SO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢到丙烯时，发现丙烯产率更高。然而，这些硫基氧化剂导致了副产品的形成，如硫化氢和二氧化硫，需要额外的处理步骤来从产品流中去除它们。未来的研究重点是开发更高效的催化剂并优化工艺条件以减少副产物的生成。
