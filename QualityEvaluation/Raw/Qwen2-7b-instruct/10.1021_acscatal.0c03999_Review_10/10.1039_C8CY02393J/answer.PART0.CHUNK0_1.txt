[1] "With the addition of 3 ppm H2S in the feed, the propylene selectivity of the catalyst increases from 79% to 96%, the deactivation factor decreases from 33% to 18%, the coke amount deceases from 3.3 wt% to 2.8 wt%, and the activity is only slightly reduced."
[2] "H2S addition can significantly increase the propylene selectivity and stability of Pt/-Al2O3, although a slight activity loss is also observed."
[3] "The coke amount decreases from 3.3 to 2.8 wt% with the increase of H2S concentration from 0 to 3 ppm, indicating the addition of H2S can suppress coke formation reactions."
[4] "The downward shift indicates Pt-CO bond is strengthened while C-O bond is weakened, which is because the electron density over Pt atoms increases and thus more Pt electrons back-donate into the 2π* anti-bonding orbital of CO molecules."
[5] "Since H2S can be easily dissociated to form S atoms on Pt particles, the number of S deposited on Pt particles and the poisoning rate increase with the elevated concentration of H2S in the feed."

Comparing the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, this study highlights the impact of H2S addition on propylene yield, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant, and key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process. The addition of 3 ppm H2S in the feed leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity from 79% to 96%, a reduction in the deactivation factor from 33% to 18%, a decrease in the coke amount from 3.3 wt% to 2.8 wt%, and a slight reduction in activity. H2S addition can significantly increase the selectivity and stability of Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts, despite a minor loss in activity. Challenges associated with H2S include byproduct formation and the potential for sulfur poisoning at higher concentrations. Future research aims to optimize catalyst design and process conditions to maximize propylene yield while minimizing side reactions and byproducts.

The key areas for future research include understanding the specific mechanisms of sulfur species adsorption and their impact on catalyst performance, developing strategies to mitigate byproduct formation and sulfur poisoning, and optimizing the feedstock composition to balance propylene yield and selectivity. The study suggests that sulfur species, particularly H2S, play a crucial role in improving the performance of Pt catalysts for ODHP. However, the research emphasizes the need for further investigation into the precise electronic structure modifications and the role of sulfur species in the dehydrogenation reaction pathways.

比较不同硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯过程中的效果，本文探讨了H2S添加对丙烯产率的影响、各氧化剂的特定挑战（包括副产物形成）、以及改进催化剂设计和优化整体流程的关键领域。在添加3 ppm H2S的情况下，丙烯选择性从79%增加到96%，脱活因素从33%降低到18%，焦炭含量从3.3 wt%减少到2.8 wt%，活性略有下降。H2S添加可以显著提高Pt/-Al2O3催化剂的选择性和稳定性，尽管活性略有损失。与H2S相关的主要挑战包括副产物形成和高浓度下硫中毒的可能性。未来研究的重点在于优化催化剂设计和工艺条件，以最大化丙烯产率并减少副反应和副产品。

未来研究的关键领域包括理解硫物种吸附的具体机制及其对催化剂性能的影响、开发策略以减轻副产物形成和硫中毒、优化原料组成以平衡丙烯产率和选择性。研究表明，硫物种，特别是H2S，在改善Pt催化剂的ODHP性能方面起着关键作用。然而，研究强调了进一步探索精确电子结构修改和硫物种在脱氢反应途径中角色的必要性。
