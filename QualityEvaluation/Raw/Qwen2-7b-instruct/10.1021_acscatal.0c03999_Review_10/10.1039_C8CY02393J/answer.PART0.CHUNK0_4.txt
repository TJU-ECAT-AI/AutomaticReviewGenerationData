The effectiveness of H2S addition in improving the performance of Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) was studied in this work. By adding 3 ppm of H2S to the feed, the propylene selectivity was increased from 79% to 96%. This improvement was partly attributed to the electron transfer from sulfur species to Pt atoms, as evidenced by CO-DRIFTS results. DFT calculations confirmed that H2S is the dominant sulfur species on Pt particles, donating electrons to Pt atoms. Additionally, the repulsion between sulfur species and C3 hydrocarbons contributed to the improved catalytic performance.

在本工作中，研究了H2S添加对Pt催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）中的性能改进效果。通过向流体中添加3 ppm的H2S，丙烯选择性从79%提高到96%。这一改善部分归因于硫物种向铂原子的电子转移，这由CO-DRIFTS结果证实。DFT计算表明，H2S是铂表面的主要硫物种，并向铂原子捐赠电子。此外，硫物种与C3烃类之间的排斥作用也促进了催化剂性能的提升。
