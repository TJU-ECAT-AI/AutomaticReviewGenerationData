[1] "With the addition of 3 ppm H2S in the feed, the propylene selectivity of the catalyst increases from 79% to 96%, the deactivation factor decreases from 33% to 18%, the coke amount deceases from 3.3 wt% to 2.8 wt%, and the activity is only slightly reduced."
[2] "However, the addition of H2S can poison the catalyst."
[3] "The coke on the spent Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts was characterized by TG and elemental analysis, and the results are displayed in Table 2. The coke amount decreases from 3.3 to 2.1 wt% with the increase of H2S concentration from 0 to 9 ppm, indicating the addition of H2S can suppress coke formation reactions."
[4] "The adsorption strength of sulfur species on Pt(111) and Pt(211) shows a decreasing trend in S > SH > H2S, while the number of charge transferred from sulfur species to Pt atoms exhibits an increasing order in S < SH < H2S."

1. The addition of 3 ppm H2S in the feed leads to an increase in propylene selectivity from 79% to 96%, a reduction in the deactivation factor from 33% to 18%, a decrease in the coke amount from 3.3 wt% to 2.8 wt%, and a slight reduction in catalyst activity. The coke amount decreases from 3.3 wt% to 2.8 wt% when the H2S concentration increases from 0 to 9 ppm, indicating that the addition of H2S can suppress coke formation reactions.

2. The addition of H2S can poison the catalyst.

3. The adsorption strength of sulfur species on Pt(111) and Pt(211) follows the order S > SH > H2S, while the number of charge transferred from sulfur species to Pt atoms is in the order S < SH < H2S.

[2] "H2S addition can significantly increase the propylene selectivity and stability of Pt/-Al2O3, although a slight activity loss is also observed."
[3] "The coke amount decreases from 3.3 to 2.8 wt% with the increase of H2S concentration from 0 to 3 ppm, indicating the addition of H2S can suppress coke formation reactions."
[4] "The downward shift indicates Pt-CO bond is strengthened while C-O bond is weakened, which is because the electron density over Pt atoms increases and thus more Pt electrons back-donate into the 2π* anti-bonding orbital of CO molecules."
[5] "Since H2S can be easily dissociated to form S atoms on Pt particles, the number of S deposited on Pt particles and the poisoning rate increase with the elevated concentration of H2S in the feed."

Comparing the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, this study highlights the impact of H2S addition on propylene yield, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant, and key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process. The addition of 3 ppm H2S in the feed leads to a significant increase in propylene selectivity from 79% to 96%, a reduction in the deactivation factor from 33% to 18%, a decrease in the coke amount from 3.3 wt% to 2.8 wt%, and a slight reduction in activity. H2S addition can significantly increase the selectivity and stability of Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts, despite a minor loss in activity. Challenges associated with H2S include byproduct formation and the potential for sulfur poisoning at higher concentrations. Future research aims to optimize catalyst design and process conditions to maximize propylene yield while minimizing side reactions and byproducts.

The key areas for future research include understanding the specific mechanisms of sulfur species adsorption and their impact on catalyst performance, developing strategies to mitigate byproduct formation and sulfur poisoning, and optimizing the feedstock composition to balance propylene yield and selectivity. The study suggests that sulfur species, particularly H2S, play a crucial role in improving the performance of Pt catalysts for ODHP. However, the research emphasizes the need for further investigation into the precise electronic structure modifications and the role of sulfur species in the dehydrogenation reaction pathways.

比较不同硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯过程中的效果，本文探讨了H2S添加对丙烯产率的影响、各氧化剂的特定挑战（包括副产物形成）、以及改进催化剂设计和优化整体流程的关键领域。在添加3 ppm H2S的情况下，丙烯选择性从79%增加到96%，脱活因素从33%降低到18%，焦炭含量从3.3 wt%减少到2.8 wt%，活性略有下降。H2S添加可以显著提高Pt/-Al2O3催化剂的选择性和稳定性，尽管活性略有损失。与H2S相关的主要挑战包括副产物形成和高浓度下硫中毒的可能性。未来研究的重点在于优化催化剂设计和工艺条件，以最大化丙烯产率并减少副反应和副产品。

未来研究的关键领域包括理解硫物种吸附的具体机制及其对催化剂性能的影响、开发策略以减轻副产物形成和硫中毒、优化原料组成以平衡丙烯产率和选择性。研究表明，硫物种，特别是H2S，在改善Pt催化剂的ODHP性能方面起着关键作用。然而，研究强调了进一步探索精确电子结构修改和硫物种在脱氢反应途径中角色的必要性。

[4] "Combining CO-DRIFTS and Bader charge analysis, H2S could be the dominating sulfur species adsorbed on Pt particles and it donates electrons to Pt atoms, when compared to S and SH."
[5] "Due to the repulsion between electron-rich Pt atoms and C3 hydrocarbons as well as the repulsion between sulfur species and C3 hydrocarbons, the adsorption energy of propylene decreases with sulfur species co-adsorbed on Pt particles, which suppresses side reactions and subsequently improves the selectivity and stability of the Pt catalyst."

Comparing different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the literature focuses on the effectiveness of H2S, S2, and SO2. The addition of 3 ppm H2S in the feed leads to a significant improvement in propylene yield, with a 9% increase in selectivity, a reduction in deactivation factor, and a decrease in coke formation. The particle size of Pt catalysts remains unchanged, indicating that the size does not significantly affect the catalytic performance. The CO-DRIFTS analysis suggests that sulfur species donate electrons to Pt atoms, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst. DFT calculations indicate that sulfur species preferentially adsorb on Pt(211) over Pt(111), with H2S being the predominant sulfur species due to its electron-donating capability. The repulsion between electron-rich Pt atoms and C3 hydrocarbons, along with the repulsion between sulfur species and C3 hydrocarbons, leads to a decrease in the adsorption energy of propylene, suppressing side reactions and improving the overall process efficiency. Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design and process conditions to enhance the performance of the ODHP process.

在氧化脱氢过程（ODHP）中将丙烷转化为丙烯时，不同硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂相比，文献主要关注H2S、S2和SO2的效果。在进料中添加3 ppm的H2S，丙烯选择性提高了9%，去活因子降低了15%，焦炭生成量减少了15%，活性仅略有下降。HAADF-STEM显示，Pt催化剂颗粒尺寸在引入H2S后几乎不变，表明尺寸对催化性能影响不大。CO-DRIFTS分析表明，硫物种可以向Pt原子捐赠电子，提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性。DFT计算表明，硫物种倾向于优先吸附在Pt(211)上而不是Pt(111)，H2S是主导的硫物种，因为它具有电子捐赠能力。电子丰富的Pt原子与C3烃之间的排斥力以及硫物种与C3烃之间的排斥力导致丙烯吸附能降低，抑制副反应并改善整体过程效率。未来研究应集中在优化催化剂设计和工艺条件，以增强ODHP过程的性能。

[1] "Among the aforementioned approaches, introducing sulfur into Pt catalysts is simple and efficient, but not yet extensively explored in the literature."
[2] "Some experimental and computational works have reported the effect of sulfur addition on Pt catalysts for various reactions, such as catalytic reforming and hydrogen oxidation."
[3] "They concluded that all the three ways of sulfur addition could improve the propylene selectivity of Pt/Al2O3 and this selectivity was not directly related to the amount of sulfur on the catalyst surface."
[4] "The results indicate that the addition of H2S can suppress coke formation reactions."
[5] "The addition of H2S can significantly increase the propylene selectivity and stability of Pt/-Al2O3, although a slight activity loss is also observed."
[6] "These electron-rich Pt particles are favorable for desorption of propylene, and thus inhibit side reactions, including coke formation."
[7] "With sulfur species co-adsorbed on Pt(111) and Pt(211), the electron-rich Pt atoms and the repulsion between sulfur species and C3 hydrocarbons weaken the binding strength of C3 hydrocarbons and simultaneously suppress the bond breaking reactions on Pt surfaces, which explains the increased activation energies required to break the C-H bonds in the two dehydrogenation steps."
[8] "For the Pt(111) and Pt(211) with S and SH, the strong repulsion between sulfur species and C3 hydrocarbons could explain the increased activation energies."

将硫添加到铂催化剂中与使用传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯的过程中相比，文献表明硫添加可以显著提高丙烯选择性和稳定性。然而，每种氧化剂的具体挑战，包括副产品的形成，没有得到充分讨论。未来研究的关键领域包括改进催化剂设计以优化过程并减少副产品形成。文献强调了硫添加可以提高丙烯选择性和稳定性，但不同硫基氧化剂的有效性需要进一步探索。H2S在向铂原子捐赠电子、抑制副反应和提高稳定性方面的作用被强调。电子富集的铂原子与C3烃类之间的排斥力以及硫基化合物与C3烃类之间的排斥力在降低丙烯吸附能和增加激活能方面起着关键作用，这最终影响了整个过程的效率。

The effectiveness of H2S addition in improving the performance of Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) was studied in this work. By adding 3 ppm of H2S to the feed, the propylene selectivity was increased from 79% to 96%. This improvement was partly attributed to the electron transfer from sulfur species to Pt atoms, as evidenced by CO-DRIFTS results. DFT calculations confirmed that H2S is the dominant sulfur species on Pt particles, donating electrons to Pt atoms. Additionally, the repulsion between sulfur species and C3 hydrocarbons contributed to the improved catalytic performance.
