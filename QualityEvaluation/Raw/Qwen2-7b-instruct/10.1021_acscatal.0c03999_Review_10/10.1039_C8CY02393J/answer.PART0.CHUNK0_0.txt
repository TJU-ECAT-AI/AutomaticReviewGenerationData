[1] "With the addition of 3 ppm H2S in the feed, the propylene selectivity of the catalyst increases from 79% to 96%, the deactivation factor decreases from 33% to 18%, the coke amount deceases from 3.3 wt% to 2.8 wt%, and the activity is only slightly reduced."
[2] "However, the addition of H2S can poison the catalyst."
[3] "The coke on the spent Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts was characterized by TG and elemental analysis, and the results are displayed in Table 2. The coke amount decreases from 3.3 to 2.1 wt% with the increase of H2S concentration from 0 to 9 ppm, indicating the addition of H2S can suppress coke formation reactions."
[4] "The adsorption strength of sulfur species on Pt(111) and Pt(211) shows a decreasing trend in S > SH > H2S, while the number of charge transferred from sulfur species to Pt atoms exhibits an increasing order in S < SH < H2S."

1. The addition of 3 ppm H2S in the feed leads to an increase in propylene selectivity from 79% to 96%, a reduction in the deactivation factor from 33% to 18%, a decrease in the coke amount from 3.3 wt% to 2.8 wt%, and a slight reduction in catalyst activity. The coke amount decreases from 3.3 wt% to 2.8 wt% when the H2S concentration increases from 0 to 9 ppm, indicating that the addition of H2S can suppress coke formation reactions.

2. The addition of H2S can poison the catalyst.

3. The adsorption strength of sulfur species on Pt(111) and Pt(211) follows the order S > SH > H2S, while the number of charge transferred from sulfur species to Pt atoms is in the order S < SH < H2S.

1. 添加3 ppm H2S在流体中，催化剂的丙烯选择性从79%增加到96%，脱活因子从33%减少到18%，焦炭量从3.3 wt%降低到2.8 wt%，并且催化剂活性略有下降。当H2S浓度从0增加到9 ppm时，焦炭量从3.3 wt%降低到2.8 wt%，表明添加H2S可以抑制焦炭形成反应。

2. 添加H2S可以毒害催化剂。

3. 硫化物物种在Pt(111)和Pt(211)上的吸附强度遵循顺序S > SH > H2S，而从硫化物物种转移到Pt原子的电荷数量是S < SH < H2S的顺序。
