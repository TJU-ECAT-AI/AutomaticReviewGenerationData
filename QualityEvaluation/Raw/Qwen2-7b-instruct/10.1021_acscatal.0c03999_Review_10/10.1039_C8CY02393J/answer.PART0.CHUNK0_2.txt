[1] "In this work, integrating experiments and DFT calculations, we provided the mechanistic insights into the effect of H2S addition in the feed on the Pt/-Al2O3 catalyzed propane dehydrogenation (PDH). With the addition of 3 ppm H2S in the feed, the propylene selectivity of the catalyst increases from 79% to 96%, the deactivation factor decreases from 33% to 18%, the coke amount deceases from 3.3 wt% to 2.8 wt%, and the activity is only slightly reduced."
[2] "HAADF-STEM displays that the Pt particle size is almost unchanged with the introduction of H2S in the feed,while CO-DRIFTS analysis indicates sulfur species can donate electrons to Pt atoms."
[3] "DFT calculations reveal that sulfur species prefer to be adsorbed on Pt(211) when compared to Pt(111)."
[4] "Combining CO-DRIFTS and Bader charge analysis, H2S could be the dominating sulfur species adsorbed on Pt particles and it donates electrons to Pt atoms, when compared to S and SH."
[5] "Due to the repulsion between electron-rich Pt atoms and C3 hydrocarbons as well as the repulsion between sulfur species and C3 hydrocarbons, the adsorption energy of propylene decreases with sulfur species co-adsorbed on Pt particles, which suppresses side reactions and subsequently improves the selectivity and stability of the Pt catalyst."

Comparing different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the literature focuses on the effectiveness of H2S, S2, and SO2. The addition of 3 ppm H2S in the feed leads to a significant improvement in propylene yield, with a 9% increase in selectivity, a reduction in deactivation factor, and a decrease in coke formation. The particle size of Pt catalysts remains unchanged, indicating that the size does not significantly affect the catalytic performance. The CO-DRIFTS analysis suggests that sulfur species donate electrons to Pt atoms, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst. DFT calculations indicate that sulfur species preferentially adsorb on Pt(211) over Pt(111), with H2S being the predominant sulfur species due to its electron-donating capability. The repulsion between electron-rich Pt atoms and C3 hydrocarbons, along with the repulsion between sulfur species and C3 hydrocarbons, leads to a decrease in the adsorption energy of propylene, suppressing side reactions and improving the overall process efficiency. Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design and process conditions to enhance the performance of the ODHP process.

在氧化脱氢过程（ODHP）中将丙烷转化为丙烯时，不同硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂相比，文献主要关注H2S、S2和SO2的效果。在进料中添加3 ppm的H2S，丙烯选择性提高了9%，去活因子降低了15%，焦炭生成量减少了15%，活性仅略有下降。HAADF-STEM显示，Pt催化剂颗粒尺寸在引入H2S后几乎不变，表明尺寸对催化性能影响不大。CO-DRIFTS分析表明，硫物种可以向Pt原子捐赠电子，提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性。DFT计算表明，硫物种倾向于优先吸附在Pt(211)上而不是Pt(111)，H2S是主导的硫物种，因为它具有电子捐赠能力。电子丰富的Pt原子与C3烃之间的排斥力以及硫物种与C3烃之间的排斥力导致丙烯吸附能降低，抑制副反应并改善整体过程效率。未来研究应集中在优化催化剂设计和工艺条件，以增强ODHP过程的性能。
