[1] "Among the aforementioned approaches, introducing sulfur into Pt catalysts is simple and efficient, but not yet extensively explored in the literature."
[2] "Some experimental and computational works have reported the effect of sulfur addition on Pt catalysts for various reactions, such as catalytic reforming and hydrogen oxidation."
[3] "They concluded that all the three ways of sulfur addition could improve the propylene selectivity of Pt/Al2O3 and this selectivity was not directly related to the amount of sulfur on the catalyst surface."
[4] "The results indicate that the addition of H2S can suppress coke formation reactions."
[5] "The addition of H2S can significantly increase the propylene selectivity and stability of Pt/-Al2O3, although a slight activity loss is also observed."
[6] "These electron-rich Pt particles are favorable for desorption of propylene, and thus inhibit side reactions, including coke formation."
[7] "With sulfur species co-adsorbed on Pt(111) and Pt(211), the electron-rich Pt atoms and the repulsion between sulfur species and C3 hydrocarbons weaken the binding strength of C3 hydrocarbons and simultaneously suppress the bond breaking reactions on Pt surfaces, which explains the increased activation energies required to break the C-H bonds in the two dehydrogenation steps."
[8] "For the Pt(111) and Pt(211) with S and SH, the strong repulsion between sulfur species and C3 hydrocarbons could explain the increased activation energies."

Comparing different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the literature suggests that sulfur addition can significantly increase propylene selectivity and stability. However, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant, including byproduct formation, are not extensively discussed. The key areas for future research include improving catalyst design to optimize the process and reducing byproducts formation. The literature highlights that sulfur addition can improve propylene selectivity and stability, but it also notes that the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants needs to be further explored. The role of H2S in donating electrons to Pt atoms, thereby inhibiting side reactions and improving stability, is emphasized. The repulsion between electron-rich Pt atoms and C3 hydrocarbons, as well as between sulfur species and C3 hydrocarbons, plays a crucial role in decreasing the adsorption energy of propylene and increasing activation energies, which ultimately affects the overall process efficiency.

将硫添加到铂催化剂中与使用传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯的过程中相比，文献表明硫添加可以显著提高丙烯选择性和稳定性。然而，每种氧化剂的具体挑战，包括副产品的形成，没有得到充分讨论。未来研究的关键领域包括改进催化剂设计以优化过程并减少副产品形成。文献强调了硫添加可以提高丙烯选择性和稳定性，但不同硫基氧化剂的有效性需要进一步探索。H2S在向铂原子捐赠电子、抑制副反应和提高稳定性方面的作用被强调。电子富集的铂原子与C3烃类之间的排斥力以及硫基化合物与C3烃类之间的排斥力在降低丙烯吸附能和增加激活能方面起着关键作用，这最终影响了整个过程的效率。
