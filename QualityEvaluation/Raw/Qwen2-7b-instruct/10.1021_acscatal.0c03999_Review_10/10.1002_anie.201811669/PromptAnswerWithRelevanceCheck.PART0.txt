[1] "The product distribution in direct alkane functionalization by oxyhalogenation strongly depends on the halogen of choice."
[2] "We demonstrate that the superior selectivity to olefins over an iron phosphate catalyst in oxychlorination is the consequence of a surface-confined reaction."
[3] "Surface-coverage analysis of the catalyst and identification of gas-phase radicals in operando mode are correlated to the catalytic performance by a multi-technique approach, which combines kinetic studies with advanced characterization techniques such as prompt-gamma activation analysis and photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy."
[4] "These results provide strategies for unraveling detailed mechanisms within complex reaction networks."
[5] "The sharp selectivity control in oxychlorination is achieved by a purely surface-driven functionalization of ethane into ethyl chloride, which is further dehydrochlorinated to ethylene over a ClFe center."
[6] "In contrast, alkane activation to ethyl bromide in oxybromination occurs in the gas-phase with evolved bromine and bromine radical species, thus leaving a halogen-free surface that is more prone to additional cracking and combustion pathways."

The document discusses the differences in effectiveness between oxychlorination and oxybromination in the context of alkane functionalization. It highlights that oxychlorination, when using iron phosphate catalysts, shows a superior selectivity for olefin production, primarily due to a surface-confined reaction mechanism. This results in a more efficient conversion of ethane into ethyl chloride, followed by dehydrochlorination to ethylene, over a chlorine-containing iron center. On the other hand, oxybromination leads to a mixture of products, including alkyl bromide, cracking, and combustion byproducts, due to gas-phase radical chain mechanisms. The study employs various techniques, including kinetic analysis, operando surface-coverage quantification, and prompt-gamma activation analysis, to correlate the catalytic performance with the selectivity patterns. These findings offer insights into the detailed mechanisms underlying complex reaction networks and provide guidance for catalyst design and optimization in alkane-to-olefin transformations via oxyhalogenation.

文献讨论了在烷烃功能化过程中，氯氧烷化和溴氧烷化之间的效果差异。它强调，在使用磷酸铁催化剂的情况下，氯氧烷化显示出对烯烃选择性的优越性，主要是由于表面限制反应机制的结果。这导致了乙烷向乙基氯的高效转化，随后通过含氯的铁中心进行脱氯化生成乙烯。相比之下，溴氧烷化导致混合产物的生成，包括烷基溴、裂解和燃烧副产品，这是由于气体相自由基链机制的结果。研究采用了多种技术，包括动力学分析、原位表面覆盖量测以及脉冲伽玛激活分析，将催化性能与选择性模式相关联。这些发现提供了复杂反应网络详细机制的见解，并为烷烃至烯烃通过氧卤化转换的催化剂设计和优化提供了指导。

The literature discusses the comparative effectiveness of oxychlorination versus oxybromination for the selective functionalization of light alkanes. It highlights that the superior selectivity of oxychlorination towards olefins over an iron phosphate catalyst is due to a surface-confined reaction mechanism. Advanced techniques such as prompt-gamma activation analysis and photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy correlate the surface coverage of the catalyst and the identification of gas-phase radicals to the catalytic performance. Density functional theory reveals that the molecular level effects of chlorine are crucial in determining the stark selectivity differences between the two reactions. The literature suggests that chlorine-based processes have great potential for one-step olefin production and provides guidelines for catalyst design in alkane-to-olefins transformation via oxyhalogenation.

[1] "The development of novel technologies for the selective functionalization of light alkanes is a critical step to enable the utilization of natural gas as an energy vector in the transition between the oil and the renewables era."
[2] "By contrast, in oxybromination alkane activation follows a gas-phase radical-chain mechanism and yields a mixture of alkyl bromide, cracking, and combustion products."
[3] "These results suggest that ethane oxychlorination could occur via a surface-driven mechanism in which the adsorbed chlorine species might be important for the catalyst performance."
[4] "Interestingly, an increment of the halide feed resulted in an increased olefin yield that correlated with a higher halogen coverage in oxychlorination, while the opposite trend was observed in oxybromination."
[5] "In general, surface oxyhalogenation reactions require an Fe site with a neighboring oxygen and its halogenated counterpart (the latter are more prominent in oxychlorination, as determined by operando PGAA (Figure3)), which are responsible for ethane activation and for ethyl halide dehydrohalogenation, respectively (FigureS14)."

The literature discusses the comparative effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, there are no direct comparisons or discussions of these specific oxidants in the provided literature. The focus is on the mechanisms governing the selectivity in alkane functionalization through oxyhalogenation, particularly the differences between oxychlorination and oxybromination over iron phosphate catalysts. The literature does not provide information on the impact of sulfur-based oxidants or their byproducts in the context of ODHP.

To answer the question regarding sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, one would need a document that specifically addresses the use of H2S, S2, or SO2 as oxidants in this process, detailing their impact on propylene yield, byproduct formation, and catalyst design considerations. The document should also outline key areas for future research aimed at improving the efficiency and selectivity of the process.

文献讨论了轻烷烃选择性功能化的新型技术开发，这一步骤对于在石油和可再生能源时代过渡中利用天然气作为能源载体至关重要。然而，文献中没有直接比较这些特定氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯过程中的效果。重点是通过氧卤化在铁磷酸催化剂上进行烷基化选择性的机制，特别是氯化氧与溴化氧之间的区别。文献并未提供关于硫基氧化剂及其副产品的信息。

对于关于硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢到丙烯过程中的问题，需要一份文档专门讨论使用H2S、S2或SO2作为氧化剂的过程，详细说明它们对丙烯产量的影响、副产品形成以及催化剂设计考虑因素。该文档还应概述未来研究的关键领域，旨在提高过程的效率和选择性。

The document highlights the potential of chlorine-based processes for producing olefins in a single step, offering insights into catalyst design for alkane-to-olefin transformations through oxyhalogenation. In contrast, bromine-based processes involve gas-phase radical chain mechanisms leading to a variety of products, including alkyl bromides, cracking, and combustion byproducts. Density functional theory calculations were conducted on the (102) surface of trigonal FePO4, and operando PEPICO spectroscopy was utilized to correlate the evolution of reaction intermediates with the reaction products. This method revealed the dynamics of bromine and radical species in the oxybromination process.
