[1] "The product distribution in direct alkane functionalization by oxyhalogenation strongly depends on the halogen of choice."
[2] "We demonstrate that the superior selectivity to olefins over an iron phosphate catalyst in oxychlorination is the consequence of a surface-confined reaction."
[3] "Surface-coverage analysis of the catalyst and identification of gas-phase radicals in operando mode are correlated to the catalytic performance by a multi-technique approach, which combines kinetic studies with advanced characterization techniques such as prompt-gamma activation analysis and photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy."
[4] "These results provide strategies for unraveling detailed mechanisms within complex reaction networks."
[5] "The sharp selectivity control in oxychlorination is achieved by a purely surface-driven functionalization of ethane into ethyl chloride, which is further dehydrochlorinated to ethylene over a ClFe center."
[6] "In contrast, alkane activation to ethyl bromide in oxybromination occurs in the gas-phase with evolved bromine and bromine radical species, thus leaving a halogen-free surface that is more prone to additional cracking and combustion pathways."

The document discusses the differences in effectiveness between oxychlorination and oxybromination in the context of alkane functionalization. It highlights that oxychlorination, when using iron phosphate catalysts, shows a superior selectivity for olefin production, primarily due to a surface-confined reaction mechanism. This results in a more efficient conversion of ethane into ethyl chloride, followed by dehydrochlorination to ethylene, over a chlorine-containing iron center. On the other hand, oxybromination leads to a mixture of products, including alkyl bromide, cracking, and combustion byproducts, due to gas-phase radical chain mechanisms. The study employs various techniques, including kinetic analysis, operando surface-coverage quantification, and prompt-gamma activation analysis, to correlate the catalytic performance with the selectivity patterns. These findings offer insights into the detailed mechanisms underlying complex reaction networks and provide guidance for catalyst design and optimization in alkane-to-olefin transformations via oxyhalogenation.

文献讨论了在烷烃功能化过程中，氯氧烷化和溴氧烷化之间的效果差异。它强调，在使用磷酸铁催化剂的情况下，氯氧烷化显示出对烯烃选择性的优越性，主要是由于表面限制反应机制的结果。这导致了乙烷向乙基氯的高效转化，随后通过含氯的铁中心进行脱氯化生成乙烯。相比之下，溴氧烷化导致混合产物的生成，包括烷基溴、裂解和燃烧副产品，这是由于气体相自由基链机制的结果。研究采用了多种技术，包括动力学分析、原位表面覆盖量测以及脉冲伽玛激活分析，将催化性能与选择性模式相关联。这些发现提供了复杂反应网络详细机制的见解，并为烷烃至烯烃通过氧卤化转换的催化剂设计和优化提供了指导。
