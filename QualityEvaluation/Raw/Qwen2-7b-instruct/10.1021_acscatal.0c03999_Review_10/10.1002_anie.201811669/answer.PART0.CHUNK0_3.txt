[1] "The development of novel technologies for the selective functionalization of light alkanes is a critical step to enable the utilization of natural gas as an energy vector in the transition between the oil and the renewables era."
[2] "By contrast, in oxybromination alkane activation follows a gas-phase radical-chain mechanism and yields a mixture of alkyl bromide, cracking, and combustion products."
[3] "These results suggest that ethane oxychlorination could occur via a surface-driven mechanism in which the adsorbed chlorine species might be important for the catalyst performance."
[4] "Interestingly, an increment of the halide feed resulted in an increased olefin yield that correlated with a higher halogen coverage in oxychlorination, while the opposite trend was observed in oxybromination."
[5] "In general, surface oxyhalogenation reactions require an Fe site with a neighboring oxygen and its halogenated counterpart (the latter are more prominent in oxychlorination, as determined by operando PGAA (Figure3)), which are responsible for ethane activation and for ethyl halide dehydrohalogenation, respectively (FigureS14)."

The literature discusses the comparative effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, there are no direct comparisons or discussions of these specific oxidants in the provided literature. The focus is on the mechanisms governing the selectivity in alkane functionalization through oxyhalogenation, particularly the differences between oxychlorination and oxybromination over iron phosphate catalysts. The literature does not provide information on the impact of sulfur-based oxidants or their byproducts in the context of ODHP.

To answer the question regarding sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, one would need a document that specifically addresses the use of H2S, S2, or SO2 as oxidants in this process, detailing their impact on propylene yield, byproduct formation, and catalyst design considerations. The document should also outline key areas for future research aimed at improving the efficiency and selectivity of the process.

文献讨论了轻烷烃选择性功能化的新型技术开发，这一步骤对于在石油和可再生能源时代过渡中利用天然气作为能源载体至关重要。然而，文献中没有直接比较这些特定氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯过程中的效果。重点是通过氧卤化在铁磷酸催化剂上进行烷基化选择性的机制，特别是氯化氧与溴化氧之间的区别。文献并未提供关于硫基氧化剂及其副产品的信息。

对于关于硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢到丙烯过程中的问题，需要一份文档专门讨论使用H2S、S2或SO2作为氧化剂的过程，详细说明它们对丙烯产量的影响、副产品形成以及催化剂设计考虑因素。该文档还应概述未来研究的关键领域，旨在提高过程的效率和选择性。
