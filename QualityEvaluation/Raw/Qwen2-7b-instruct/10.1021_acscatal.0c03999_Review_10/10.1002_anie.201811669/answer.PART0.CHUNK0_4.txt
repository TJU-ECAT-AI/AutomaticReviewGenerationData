[1] "These results demonstrate that chlorine-based processes hold great potential for one-step olefin production in technical scale and provide guidelines for catalyst design for direct alkane-to-olefins transformation via oxyhalogenation."
[2] "By contrast, in oxybromination alkane activation follows a gas-phase radical-chain mechanism and yields a mixture of alkyl bromide, cracking, and combustion products."
[3] "Density functional theory calculations were performed on the experimentally relevant (102) surface of trigonal FePO4 (FigureS1)."
[4] "In particular, the evolution of signals corresponding to reaction intermediates, as a function of temperature, was correlated with that of the reaction products; while the Br2 signal decreased sharply, signals associated with C2H5. and Br. radicals increased along with C2H5Br, until 600K."

The document highlights the potential of chlorine-based processes for producing olefins in a single step, offering insights into catalyst design for alkane-to-olefin transformations through oxyhalogenation. In contrast, bromine-based processes involve gas-phase radical chain mechanisms leading to a variety of products, including alkyl bromides, cracking, and combustion byproducts. Density functional theory calculations were conducted on the (102) surface of trigonal FePO4, and operando PEPICO spectroscopy was utilized to correlate the evolution of reaction intermediates with the reaction products. This method revealed the dynamics of bromine and radical species in the oxybromination process.
