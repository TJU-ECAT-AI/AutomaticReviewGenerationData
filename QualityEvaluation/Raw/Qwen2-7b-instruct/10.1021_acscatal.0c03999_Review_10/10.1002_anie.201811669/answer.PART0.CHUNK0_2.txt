[5] "An iron phosphate catalyst was chosen because of its ability to selectively (97%) generate ethylene and propylene via alkane oxychlorination."
[6] "The sharp selectivity control in oxychlorination is achieved by a purely surface-driven functionalization of ethane into ethyl chloride, which is further dehydrochlorinated to ethylene over a ClFe center."
[7] "In contrast, alkane activation to ethyl bromide in oxybromination occurs in the gas-phase with evolved bromine and bromine radical species, thus leaving a halogen-free surface that is more prone to additional cracking and combustion pathways."
[8] "These results demonstrate that chlorine-based processes hold great potential for one-step olefin production in technical scale and provide guidelines for catalyst design for direct alkane-to-olefins transformation via oxyhalogenation."

The literature discusses the comparative effectiveness of oxychlorination versus oxybromination for the selective functionalization of light alkanes. It highlights that the superior selectivity of oxychlorination towards olefins over an iron phosphate catalyst is due to a surface-confined reaction mechanism. Advanced techniques such as prompt-gamma activation analysis and photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy correlate the surface coverage of the catalyst and the identification of gas-phase radicals to the catalytic performance. Density functional theory reveals that the molecular level effects of chlorine are crucial in determining the stark selectivity differences between the two reactions. The literature suggests that chlorine-based processes have great potential for one-step olefin production and provides guidelines for catalyst design in alkane-to-olefins transformation via oxyhalogenation.
