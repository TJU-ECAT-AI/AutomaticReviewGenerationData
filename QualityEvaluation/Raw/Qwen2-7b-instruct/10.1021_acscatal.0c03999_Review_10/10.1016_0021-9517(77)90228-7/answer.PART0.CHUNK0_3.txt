[1] "The overall reaction for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + so2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."
[2] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."
[3] "The reduced Pd/ALOs is clearly superior to the sulfided catalyst."
[4] "Sulfiding Pd/AlzOs did not,therefore,improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst."
[5] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane ; however,the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed (see Table 1)."
[6] "Although it is premature at this stage to give some insight into the mechanisms of these reactions,however, SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."
[7] "The presence of COZ among the reaction products seems to support this view."

1. The reaction for dehydrogenating propane to propylene using sulfur dioxide involves three propane molecules reacting with one sulfur dioxide molecule to produce three ethene molecules, one hydrogen molecule, and two water molecules.
2. Previous studies demonstrated that this reaction is endothermic and the equilibrium constant (Kp) increases with an increase in temperature.
3. The reduced palladium alumina catalyst showed superior performance compared to the sulfided catalyst in terms of activity.
4. Sulfiding the palladium alumina catalyst did not enhance its activity or selectivity relative to the reduced catalyst.
5. Adding sulfur dioxide to the feed increased the conversion of propane, but the selectivity towards propylene was significantly lower than with pure propane feed.
6. SO2 seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane, leading to the formation of hydrogen sulfide and water.
7. The presence of carbon dioxide in the reaction products supports the view that propylene may be oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide.

1. 烯烃丙烷转化为丙烯的反应涉及三个丙烷分子与一个二氧化硫分子反应生成三个乙烯分子、一个氢分子和两个水分子。
2. 以往的研究表明，该反应是吸热的，并且平衡常数（Kp）随着温度的升高而增加。
3. 还原钯氧化铝催化剂在活性方面优于硫化催化剂。
4. 对钯氧化铝催化剂进行硫化并未提高其活性或选择性，相比还原催化剂没有改善。
5. 向原料中添加二氧化硫增加了丙烷的转化率，但丙烯的选择性远低于纯丙烷原料。
6. 二氧化硫似乎从烷烃中提取氢原子，导致氢化物硫化物和水的形成。
7. 反应产物中的二氧化碳的存在支持了丙烯可能被二氧化硫氧化为水和二氧化碳的观点。
