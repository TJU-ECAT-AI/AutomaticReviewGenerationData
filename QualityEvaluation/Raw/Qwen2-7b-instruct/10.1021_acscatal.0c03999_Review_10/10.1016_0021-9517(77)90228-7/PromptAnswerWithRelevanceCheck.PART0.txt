The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene can be compared based on their impact on propylene yield, specific challenges, and byproduct formation. When sulfur dioxide (SO2) is added to the feed, it increases the conversion of propane, yet the selectivities to propylene are significantly lower compared to using pure propane feed. Sulfiding palladium catalysts do not improve activity or selectivity, whereas the reduced Pd/A1203 catalyst shows advantages over conventional chromium-based catalysts, particularly in high-temperature operations where there is a notable increase in selectivity per pass. Oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 provides an alternative method to overcome the equilibrium limitations of the reaction, with Pd/A1203 showing promise in this context.

硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯（ODHP）中的效果比较，基于它们对丙烯产率的影响、特定挑战以及副产物形成。当向反应物中添加二氧化硫（SO2），可以增加丙烷的转化率，但丙烯的选择性远低于使用纯丙烷作为原料的情况。硫化钯催化剂并未提高活性或选择性，而还原态的Pd/A1203催化剂在高温操作中相对于常规铬基催化剂显示出优势，特别是在每次通过过程中可观察到显著的选择性提升。使用SO2进行氧化脱氢提供了一种克服反应平衡限制的方法，Pd/A1203在这方面表现出希望。

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene was compared with conventional oxidants. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) was found to increase the conversion of propane, albeit with significantly lower selectivity towards propylene compared to pure propane feed. This suggests that while SO2 can enhance the overall conversion, it negatively impacts the selectivity towards propylene. The conventional Crz03-A120rK30 dehydrogenation catalyst showed higher activity and selectivity towards propylene at higher temperatures compared to the Pd/Al203 catalyst, especially in high-temperature operations where significant increases in selectivity per pass were observed. The low selectivity of Pd/Al203 to propylene might be attributed to the oxidation of propylene by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide. Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design to improve the selectivity of sulfur-based oxidants towards propylene in ODHP processes, aiming to mitigate the byproduct formation issues associated with these oxidants.

硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯中的效果与常规氧化剂进行了比较。发现二氧化硫（SO2）可以增加丙烷的转化率，但对丙烯的选择性远低于纯丙烷喂料。这表明，虽然SO2可以增强整体转化率，但它显著降低了向丙烯的选择性。与常规Crz03-A120rK30脱氢催化剂相比，Pd/Al203催化剂在高温操作中显示出更高的活性和丙烯选择性，尤其是在高温操作中，每通过一次过程可以看到显著的增加。低的丙烯选择性可能归因于丙烯被SO2氧化为水和二氧化碳。未来的研究应集中在优化催化剂设计上，以提高硫基氧化剂向丙烯在ODHP过程中选择性，同时试图缓解这些氧化剂相关的副产品形成问题。

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene was compared with conventional oxidants. Among sulfur-based oxidants, sulfur dioxide (SO2) showed potential as an alternative to overcome equilibrium limitations in the reaction. However, the use of SO2 led to lower propylene selectivity compared to using pure propane feed. Palladium on alumina (Pd/Al2O3) in its reduced state was found to offer higher activity and selectivity to propylene at higher temperatures, compared to its sulfided state. This suggests that sulfiding palladium catalysts did not improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst. The study also highlighted the importance of considering the byproducts formed during the reaction, such as hydrogen sulfide and water, when using sulfur-based oxidants. Further research is needed to optimize catalyst design and improve the overall process efficiency in ODHP.

在氧化脱氢反应中，硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷转化为丙烯的效率比较进行了研究。其中，二氧化硫（SO2）显示出作为克服反应平衡限制的替代方案的潜力。然而，使用SO2时，丙烯选择性较低，与纯丙烷进料相比。钯在氧化铝（Pd/Al2O3）的还原状态下表现出更高的活性和丙烯选择性，在较高温度下，这比其硫化状态更好。这表明，硫化钯催化剂的活性或选择性没有改善超过还原催化剂。研究还强调了在使用硫基氧化剂时考虑反应副产物的重要性，如氢硫酸和水。需要进一步的研究来优化催化剂设计并提高整体过程效率。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Sulfur-based oxidants, particularly sulfur dioxide (SO2), showed limited improvement in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene compared to conventional oxidants. While SO2 increased the conversion of propane, it did not significantly enhance propylene selectivity, often falling below the levels achieved with pure propane feed.

2. Sulfiding palladium catalysts did not lead to better activity or selectivity in the ODHP process. This suggests that sulfur-based treatments may not necessarily enhance the performance of palladium catalysts for this specific reaction.

3. The reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst offered distinct benefits over conventional chromium oxide-alumina catalysts, particularly in high-temperature operations. Notably, at higher temperatures, significant increases in propylene selectivity per pass were observed, as evidenced in the table.

4. The production of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a byproduct supports the hypothesis that propylene might be oxidized by sulfur dioxide (SO2) during the ODHP process, leading to its transformation into water and carbon dioxide.

1. 含硫氧化剂，特别是二氧化硫（SO2），在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯过程中与传统氧化剂相比，对丙烯的选择性提升有限。虽然SO2增加了丙烷的转化率，但其对丙烯选择性的提升幅度低于纯丙烷喂料的情况。

2. 硫化钯催化剂并未表现出提高活性或选择性的优势。这表明，使用含硫物质处理可能不会必然改善钯催化剂在此特定反应中的性能。

3. 还原态Pd/Al2O3催化剂相对于常规的铬氧化物-铝酸盐脱氢催化剂，在高温操作中提供了独特的优势，尤其是在每经过一次过程就能显著提高丙烯选择性的情况下。

4. 反应产物中出现的二氧化碳（CO2）支持这样一个观点：在ODHP过程中，丙烯可能被二氧化硫（SO2）氧化，导致其转化为水和二氧化碳。
