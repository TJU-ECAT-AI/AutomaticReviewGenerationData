[1] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane ; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed (see Table 1)."
[2] "First, sulfiding palladium catalyst did not improve activity or selectivity."
[3] "Second, the reduced Pd/A1203 catalyst offers some advantages over the conventional Crz03-A120rK30 dehydrogenation catalyst, especially in high temperature operations in which appreciable increase in selectivity per pass is noticed (see bottom of Table 1)."
[4] "The presence of CO2 among the reaction products seems to support this view."

1. Sulfur-based oxidants, particularly sulfur dioxide (SO2), showed limited improvement in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene compared to conventional oxidants. While SO2 increased the conversion of propane, it did not significantly enhance propylene selectivity, often falling below the levels achieved with pure propane feed.

2. Sulfiding palladium catalysts did not lead to better activity or selectivity in the ODHP process. This suggests that sulfur-based treatments may not necessarily enhance the performance of palladium catalysts for this specific reaction.

3. The reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst offered distinct benefits over conventional chromium oxide-alumina catalysts, particularly in high-temperature operations. Notably, at higher temperatures, significant increases in propylene selectivity per pass were observed, as evidenced in the table.

4. The production of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a byproduct supports the hypothesis that propylene might be oxidized by sulfur dioxide (SO2) during the ODHP process, leading to its transformation into water and carbon dioxide.

1. 含硫氧化剂，特别是二氧化硫（SO2），在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯过程中与传统氧化剂相比，对丙烯的选择性提升有限。虽然SO2增加了丙烷的转化率，但其对丙烯选择性的提升幅度低于纯丙烷喂料的情况。

2. 硫化钯催化剂并未表现出提高活性或选择性的优势。这表明，使用含硫物质处理可能不会必然改善钯催化剂在此特定反应中的性能。

3. 还原态Pd/Al2O3催化剂相对于常规的铬氧化物-铝酸盐脱氢催化剂，在高温操作中提供了独特的优势，尤其是在每经过一次过程就能显著提高丙烯选择性的情况下。

4. 反应产物中出现的二氧化碳（CO2）支持这样一个观点：在ODHP过程中，丙烯可能被二氧化硫（SO2）氧化，导致其转化为水和二氧化碳。
