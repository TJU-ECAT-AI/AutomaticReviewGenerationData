[1] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane."
[2] "However, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed (see Table 1)."
[3] "First, sulfiding palladium catalyst did not improve activity or selectivity."
[4] "Second, the reduced Pd/A1203 catalyst offers some advantages over the conventional Crz03-A120rK30 dehydrogenation catalyst, especially in high temperature operations in which appreciable increase in selectivity per pass is noticed (see bottom of Table 1)."
[5] "The third conclusion is that oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction; Pd/A1,03 offers some hope in this respect."

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene can be compared based on their impact on propylene yield, specific challenges, and byproduct formation. When sulfur dioxide (SO2) is added to the feed, it increases the conversion of propane, yet the selectivities to propylene are significantly lower compared to using pure propane feed. Sulfiding palladium catalysts do not improve activity or selectivity, whereas the reduced Pd/A1203 catalyst shows advantages over conventional chromium-based catalysts, particularly in high-temperature operations where there is a notable increase in selectivity per pass. Oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 provides an alternative method to overcome the equilibrium limitations of the reaction, with Pd/A1203 showing promise in this context.

硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯（ODHP）中的效果比较，基于它们对丙烯产率的影响、特定挑战以及副产物形成。当向反应物中添加二氧化硫（SO2），可以增加丙烷的转化率，但丙烯的选择性远低于使用纯丙烷作为原料的情况。硫化钯催化剂并未提高活性或选择性，而还原态的Pd/A1203催化剂在高温操作中相对于常规铬基催化剂显示出优势，特别是在每次通过过程中可观察到显著的选择性提升。使用SO2进行氧化脱氢提供了一种克服反应平衡限制的方法，Pd/A1203在这方面表现出希望。
