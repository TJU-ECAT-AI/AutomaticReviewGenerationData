[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen- ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + so2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."
[2] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."
[3] "Results given in Table 1 show the per- formance of both catalysts at different temperatures using propane feed at 1 atm pressure and space velocity of 600 hr-."
[4] "The reduced Pd/ALOs is clearly superior to the sulfided catalyst."
[5] "Sulfiding Pd/AlzOs did not,therefore,improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst."
[6] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane ; however,the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed (see Table 1)."
[7] "Sulfiding palladium catalyst did not improve activity or selectivity."
[8] "Although it is premature at this stage to give some insight into the mechanisms of these reactions,however, SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."
[9] "On the other hand,the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide."
[10] "The presence of COZ among the reaction products seems to support this view."

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene was compared with conventional oxidants. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) was found to increase the conversion of propane, albeit with significantly lower selectivity towards propylene compared to pure propane feed. This suggests that while SO2 can enhance the overall conversion, it negatively impacts the selectivity towards propylene. The conventional Crz03-A120rK30 dehydrogenation catalyst showed higher activity and selectivity towards propylene at higher temperatures compared to the Pd/Al203 catalyst, especially in high-temperature operations where significant increases in selectivity per pass were observed. The low selectivity of Pd/Al203 to propylene might be attributed to the oxidation of propylene by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide. Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design to improve the selectivity of sulfur-based oxidants towards propylene in ODHP processes, aiming to mitigate the byproduct formation issues associated with these oxidants.

硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯中的效果与常规氧化剂进行了比较。发现二氧化硫（SO2）可以增加丙烷的转化率，但对丙烯的选择性远低于纯丙烷喂料。这表明，虽然SO2可以增强整体转化率，但它显著降低了向丙烯的选择性。与常规Crz03-A120rK30脱氢催化剂相比，Pd/Al203催化剂在高温操作中显示出更高的活性和丙烯选择性，尤其是在高温操作中，每通过一次过程可以看到显著的增加。低的丙烯选择性可能归因于丙烯被SO2氧化为水和二氧化碳。未来的研究应集中在优化催化剂设计上，以提高硫基氧化剂向丙烯在ODHP过程中选择性，同时试图缓解这些氧化剂相关的副产品形成问题。
