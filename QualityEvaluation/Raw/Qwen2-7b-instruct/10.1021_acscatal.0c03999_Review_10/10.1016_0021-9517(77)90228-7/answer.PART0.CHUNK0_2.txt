[1] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."
[2] "The reduced Pd/ALOs is clearly superior to the sulfided catalyst. It shows a moderate activity as can be seen from conversion data, and high selectivity to propylene at temperatures as high as 611C."
[3] "Sulfiding Pd/AlzOs did not,therefore,improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst."
[4] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane ; however,the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed (see Table 1)."
[5] "On the other hand,sulfided Pd/A1203 catalyst shows poor activity although its selectivity was fairly high (71%)."
[6] "The conclusions which could be drawn from this study are: First,sulfiding palladium catalyst did not improve activity or selectivity."
[7] "Second, the reduced Pd/A1203 catalyst offers some advantages over the conventional Crz03-A120rK30 dehydrogenation catalyst, especially in high temperature operations in which appreciably increase in selectivity per pass is noticed."
[8] "The third conclusion is that oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction; Pd/A1,03 offers some hope in this respect."
[9] "Although it is premature at this stage to give some insight into the mechanisms of these reactions, however, SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."
[10] "On the other hand,the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide."

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene was compared with conventional oxidants. Among sulfur-based oxidants, sulfur dioxide (SO2) showed potential as an alternative to overcome equilibrium limitations in the reaction. However, the use of SO2 led to lower propylene selectivity compared to using pure propane feed. Palladium on alumina (Pd/Al2O3) in its reduced state was found to offer higher activity and selectivity to propylene at higher temperatures, compared to its sulfided state. This suggests that sulfiding palladium catalysts did not improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst. The study also highlighted the importance of considering the byproducts formed during the reaction, such as hydrogen sulfide and water, when using sulfur-based oxidants. Further research is needed to optimize catalyst design and improve the overall process efficiency in ODHP.

在氧化脱氢反应中，硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷转化为丙烯的效率比较进行了研究。其中，二氧化硫（SO2）显示出作为克服反应平衡限制的替代方案的潜力。然而，使用SO2时，丙烯选择性较低，与纯丙烷进料相比。钯在氧化铝（Pd/Al2O3）的还原状态下表现出更高的活性和丙烯选择性，在较高温度下，这比其硫化状态更好。这表明，硫化钯催化剂的活性或选择性没有改善超过还原催化剂。研究还强调了在使用硫基氧化剂时考虑反应副产物的重要性，如氢硫酸和水。需要进一步的研究来优化催化剂设计并提高整体过程效率。
