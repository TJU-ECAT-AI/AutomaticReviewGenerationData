[1] "We have studied the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene over heavily sulfided Ni catalysts at 873 K."
[2] "In the absence of sulfur but in the presence of hydrogen, supported metallic nickel catalyzes the rapid hydrogenolysis of alkanes, resulting in exceedingly poor selectivity toward dehydrogenation products."
[3] "However, the hydrogenolysis activity can be essentially eliminated by proper sulfidation, resulting in high selectivity toward isobutylene production."
[4] "Due to thermodynamic limitations, elevated temperatures are necessary to attain reasonable conversions to isobutylene."
[5] "Under these conditions, the formation of coke is rapid and is the main cause of catalyst deactivation."
[6] "Treatment of nickel catalysts with relatively large mounts of sulfur-containing reagents results not only in dramatically improved selectivity but also in a decreased rate of coke formation."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is compared with conventional oxidants. The sulfur-based oxidants, including H2S, S2, and SO2, are evaluated based on their impact on propylene yield and the challenges they pose, such as byproduct formation. Challenges include managing the byproducts formed during the oxidative process, optimizing the catalyst design to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted reactions, and enhancing the overall efficiency of the ODHP process. Future research aims to improve catalyst design, optimize process parameters, and develop more efficient sulfur-based oxidants to enhance propylene production while mitigating potential byproduct formation and catalyst deactivation.

Answer: There are no specific details provided in the literature regarding the comparative effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The text focuses on the dehydrogenation of isobutane over sulfided nickel catalysts and does not offer a detailed comparison of sulfur-based oxidants used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

Due to thermodynamic limitations, elevated temperatures are nec- essary to attain reasonable conversions to isobutylene. Under these conditions, the formation of coke is rapid and is the main cause of catalyst deactivation. Treatment of nickel catalysts with relatively large mounts of sulfur-containing reagents results not only in dramatically improved selectivity but also in a decreased rate of coke formation. The catalysts exhibited activation periods of sev- eral hours until a maximum was reached when they were placed in the reaction environment at 873 K. This activation period did not depend upon the previous reduction treatment but did depend upon the time on stream. A correlation was found between the increase in activity and the growth of a carbidic phase on the catalyst. This species, characterized by TPO and XPS, reached a saturation value at a C/Ni ratio of unity, which was coincidental with the amount of carbon on the catalyst when it achieved its maximum activity. Two alternative explanations for the activation process are discussed. The first considers the participation of a nickel-earbidic-carbon complex in the reaction scheme. The sec- ond considers the creation of sulfur vacancies during the initial coke deposition period which would increase the exposure of a catalytically active Ni-S moiety.

The study focuses on the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene over sulfided nickel catalysts. It highlights the importance of sulfur in improving selectivity and reducing coke formation, which is a significant cause of catalyst deactivation. The catalysts exhibit an activation period upon placement in the reaction environment, which correlates with the growth of a carbidic phase on the catalyst. The sulfur vacancies created during the initial coke deposition period enhance the exposure of a catalytically active Ni-S moiety, suggesting a role in the activation process.

该研究关注在硫化镍催化剂上进行异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯的过程。它强调了硫在提高选择性和减少焦炭形成方面的重要性，而后者是催化剂失活的主要原因。催化剂在放置于反应环境后会经历一个激活期，这一过程与催化剂表面碳化物相的增长相关。在初始焦炭沉积期间产生的硫空位增加了活性Ni-S基团的暴露，这可能在激活过程中起作用。

Comparing the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the literature does not provide specific data or comparisons regarding these oxidants' impact on propylene yield, byproduct formation, or challenges associated with each oxidant. It focuses on the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene over sulfided nickel catalysts. Therefore, it is not possible to draw conclusions based on the provided information.

Future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process might involve exploring the efficiency, selectivity, and stability of different oxidants in dehydrogenation reactions, especially considering the formation of byproducts and the challenges they pose. The study could also aim to enhance the understanding of the reaction mechanisms involved, particularly in relation to sulfur-based oxidants, to tailor catalysts more effectively for optimal performance.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯的过程中，不同硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂的有效性比较，文献中没有提供关于这些氧化剂对丙烯产率、副产物形成以及每种氧化剂面临的特定挑战的具体数据或比较。它专注于在硫化镍催化剂上进行异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯的研究。因此，无法基于提供的信息得出结论。

未来研究可能需要探索不同氧化剂在脱氢反应中的效率、选择性和稳定性，特别是在考虑副产物形成及其挑战的情况下。研究还可以针对优化整体过程设计催化剂，增强对涉及硫基氧化剂的反应机制的理解，以更有效地定制催化剂以实现最佳性能。
