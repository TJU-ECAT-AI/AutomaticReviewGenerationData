          [1] "We have studied the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene over heavily sulfided Ni catalysts at 873 K."
          [2] "In the absence of sulfur but in the presence of hydrogen, supported metallic nickel catalyzes the rapid hydrogenolysis of alkanes, resulting in exceedingly poor selectivity toward dehydrogenation products."
          [3] "However, the hydrogenolysis activity can be essentially eliminated by proper sulfidation, resulting in high selectivity toward isobutylene production."
          [4] "Due to thermodynamic limitations, elevated temperatures are necessary to attain reasonable conversions to isobutylene."
          [5] "Under these conditions, the formation of coke is rapid and is the main cause of catalyst deactivation."
          [6] "Treatment of nickel catalysts with relatively large mounts of sulfur-containing reagents results not only in dramatically improved selectivity but also in a decreased rate of coke formation."

          The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is compared with conventional oxidants. The sulfur-based oxidants, including H2S, S2, and SO2, are evaluated based on their impact on propylene yield and the challenges they pose, such as byproduct formation. Challenges include managing the byproducts formed during the oxidative process, optimizing the catalyst design to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted reactions, and enhancing the overall efficiency of the ODHP process. Future research aims to improve catalyst design, optimize process parameters, and develop more efficient sulfur-based oxidants to enhance propylene production while mitigating potential byproduct formation and catalyst deactivation.

          在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯的过程中，不同硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂的有效性进行了比较。硫基氧化剂，包括H2S、S2和SO2，根据它们对丙烯产率的影响以及带来的挑战进行评估，如副产物形成。面临的挑战包括管理氧化过程中形成的副产物，优化催化剂设计以最大化丙烯产率同时最小化不必要的反应，以及提高ODHP过程的整体效率。未来的研究旨在改进催化剂设计、优化工艺参数，并开发更高效的硫基氧化剂，以增强丙烯生产并减少潜在的副产物形成和催化剂失活。
