Due to thermodynamic limitations, elevated temperatures are nec- essary to attain reasonable conversions to isobutylene. Under these conditions, the formation of coke is rapid and is the main cause of catalyst deactivation. Treatment of nickel catalysts with relatively large mounts of sulfur-containing reagents results not only in dramatically improved selectivity but also in a decreased rate of coke formation. The catalysts exhibited activation periods of sev- eral hours until a maximum was reached when they were placed in the reaction environment at 873 K. This activation period did not depend upon the previous reduction treatment but did depend upon the time on stream. A correlation was found between the increase in activity and the growth of a carbidic phase on the catalyst. This species, characterized by TPO and XPS, reached a saturation value at a C/Ni ratio of unity, which was coincidental with the amount of carbon on the catalyst when it achieved its maximum activity. Two alternative explanations for the activation process are discussed. The first considers the participation of a nickel-earbidic-carbon complex in the reaction scheme. The sec- ond considers the creation of sulfur vacancies during the initial coke deposition period which would increase the exposure of a catalytically active Ni-S moiety.

The study focuses on the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene over sulfided nickel catalysts. It highlights the importance of sulfur in improving selectivity and reducing coke formation, which is a significant cause of catalyst deactivation. The catalysts exhibit an activation period upon placement in the reaction environment, which correlates with the growth of a carbidic phase on the catalyst. The sulfur vacancies created during the initial coke deposition period enhance the exposure of a catalytically active Ni-S moiety, suggesting a role in the activation process.

该研究关注在硫化镍催化剂上进行异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯的过程。它强调了硫在提高选择性和减少焦炭形成方面的重要性，而后者是催化剂失活的主要原因。催化剂在放置于反应环境后会经历一个激活期，这一过程与催化剂表面碳化物相的增长相关。在初始焦炭沉积期间产生的硫空位增加了活性Ni-S基团的暴露，这可能在激活过程中起作用。
