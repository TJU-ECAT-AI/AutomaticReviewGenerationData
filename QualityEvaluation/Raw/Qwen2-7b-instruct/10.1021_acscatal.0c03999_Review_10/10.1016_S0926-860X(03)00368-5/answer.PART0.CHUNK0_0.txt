1. Several supported chromium oxide catalysts, including Cr2O3/SiO2, were found to exhibit excellent performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. 

2. Takahara et al. observed that carbon dioxide had a promoting effect specifically on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts when dehydrogenating propane.

3. In a study by Nakagawa et al., gallium oxide (Ga2O3) was found to be effective in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2. The ethylene yield was approximately double that in the absence of CO2.

4. The catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is significantly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties. Supported gallium oxides are favored over zeolites in the NOx reduction reaction due to their lesser acidity. Lewis acid sites within gallium oxide are suspected to be active in the ethane dehydrogenation process.

1. 几种支持的铬氧化物催化剂，包括Cr2O3/SiO2，在以二氧化碳为氧化剂的乙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出优异性能。

2. 坂原等人发现，当脱氢丙烷时，二氧化碳仅对二氧化硅支持的Cr2O3催化剂有促进作用。

3. 在Nakagawa等人的一项研究中，他们发现，在二氧化碳存在的条件下，镓氧化物（Ga2O3）能够有效地进行乙烷脱氢。在二氧化碳存在下，乙烯产率大约是其不存在时的两倍。

4. 镓氧化物催化剂的催化活性受到其酸碱性质的影响。在去除氮氧化物反应中，支持的镓氧化物比沸石更受欢迎，因为它们的酸性较弱。镓氧化物中的Lewis酸位点被认为可能在乙烷脱氢过程中起作用。
