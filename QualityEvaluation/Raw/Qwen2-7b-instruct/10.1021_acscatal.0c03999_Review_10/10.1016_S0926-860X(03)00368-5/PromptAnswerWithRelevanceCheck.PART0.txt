<p>Wang et al. [4] investigated several supported chromium oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. They found that the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance.</p>
<p>Similar results were obtained by Takahara et al. [5] for dehydrogenation of propane. They reported that the carbon dioxide exerted promoting effect only on silica supported Cr2O3 catalyst.</p>
<p>Nakagawa et al. [8] studied a series of metal-oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 and found that Ga2O3 was effective. Ethylene yield in the presence of CO2 was approximately twice of that in its absence.</p>
<p>It is well known that the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties. Supported gallium oxides are preferred to zeolites in the de-NOx reaction due to their weaker acidity [12]. On the other hand, the Lewis acid sites are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation [8].</p>

1. Several supported chromium oxide catalysts, including Cr2O3/SiO2, were found to exhibit excellent performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. 

2. Takahara et al. observed that carbon dioxide had a promoting effect specifically on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts when dehydrogenating propane.

3. In a study by Nakagawa et al., gallium oxide (Ga2O3) was found to be effective in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2. The ethylene yield was approximately double that in the absence of CO2.

4. The catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is significantly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties. Supported gallium oxides are favored over zeolites in the NOx reduction reaction due to their lesser acidity. Lewis acid sites within gallium oxide are suspected to be active in the ethane dehydrogenation process.

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants such as H2S, S2, and SO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is not discussed in the provided literature. However, the literature does mention the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a mild oxidant in ODHP, which allows the reaction to occur at relatively low temperatures with high selectivity towards propylene. The key challenge associated with using CO2 is developing a catalyst with desirable selectivity. Additionally, the literature notes that the promoting role of CO2 is only observed in the initial stage of the reaction, and it does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction. Furthermore, the introduction of potassium to gallium oxide leads to a loss of catalytic activity. Future research should focus on improving catalyst design and optimizing the overall process to address these challenges.

1. The document discusses the use of sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, it focuses on the effectiveness of carbon dioxide (CO2) in this context. CO2 offers advantages such as low temperature operation and high selectivity towards propylene. It enhances the initial activity of the gallium oxide catalyst, enabling a higher conversion and selectivity compared to argon under the same conditions. 

2. The document does not compare the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in the ODHP process. It emphasizes the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant, which can achieve a high yield of propene at relatively low temperatures. Challenges associated with CO2 include its consumption of hydrogen, which shifts the equilibrium towards products. However, its role in the initial stages of reaction is limited, and it does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction.

3. Potassium-promoted gallium oxide catalysts exhibit lower catalytic activity compared to unpromoted gallium oxide. This suggests that the reaction proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst, as potassium promotes catalysts do not show high activity. The document does not specify the challenges associated with each sulfur-based oxidant, focusing instead on CO2 as an effective mild oxidant in the ODHP process.

4. Future research directions aim to improve catalyst design and optimize the ODHP process. This includes exploring the development of new catalysts with desirable selectivity, reducing the formation of byproducts, and enhancing the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions. The document does not provide detailed suggestions for these areas of research, emphasizing instead the role of CO2 in improving the initial activity of gallium oxide catalysts in the ODHP process.

1. 文档讨论了在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯过程中硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）的应用，但重点是二氧化碳（CO2）的作用。CO2的优势在于能够在较低温度下实现高选择性地制备丙烯，并且与氧气相比，其可以降低反应温度。文档表明，CO2能够提高初始活性，使得在相同条件下丙烷转化率和选择性更高。

2. 文档没有比较不同硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯过程中的效果。它强调使用CO2作为温和的氧化剂，可以在相对较低温度下以高选择性生成丙烯。CO2的挑战包括消耗氢气，从而将平衡向产物方向移动。然而，在反应初期，CO2的作用有限，并且它不会抑制催化剂在反应过程中的快速失活。

3. 钾促进的镓氧化物催化剂的催化活性低于未促进的镓氧化物。这表明反应可能在催化剂的酸性位点上进行，因为钾促进的镓氧化物催化剂显示出较低的活性。文档没有详细说明每种硫基氧化剂的具体挑战，而是强调了使用CO2作为ODHP过程中的有效温和氧化剂。

4. 将来研究的方向旨在改进催化剂设计并优化ODHP过程。这包括探索开发具有高选择性的新催化剂、减少副产品的形成以及增强催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性。文档没有提供这些研究领域的具体建议，而是着重强调了在ODHP过程中使用CO2提高镓氧化物催化剂初始活性的作用。

[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propene has become very important. Propene is used in chemical industry for the synthesis of cumene, acrylonitrile and high purity polypropylene."
[2] "As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective."
[3] "However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene."
[4] "Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."
[5] "It was found that carbon dioxide enhance the initial activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst."
[6] "Under carbon dioxide atmosphere after reaction period 0.2 h, the propene yield reached 30.6%, while under argon 23.0%."
[7] "In the presence of CO2 and at a molar ratio CO2/C3H8 = 5, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be 50 K lower than that for the dehydrogenation in the presence of inert gas."
[8] "The promoting role of carbon dioxide was only observed in the initial stage of reaction. However, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction."
[9] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity. The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst,since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."

1. Propane to propene dehydrogenation has gained importance due to its applications in the production of cumene, acrylonitrile, and high-purity polypropylene. This process is inherently nonselective but can be optimized by utilizing mild oxidants like carbon dioxide.

2. The dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be nonselective because all CH bonds in propane have equal chances of reacting. However, to achieve high selectivity towards propene, it is crucial to control the reaction conditions and prevent overoxidation.

3. Oxygen-based oxidants are exothermic, posing challenges such as the need to remove heat efficiently to maintain high selectivity towards propene. Carbon dioxide offers an attractive alternative as it can perform the dehydrogenation at lower temperatures with high selectivity.

4. Carbon dioxide significantly enhances the initial activity of gallium oxide catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane. Under carbon dioxide atmosphere, the propene yield can reach up to 30.6% compared to 23.0% under argon.

5. The presence of carbon dioxide lowers the temperature required for dehydrogenation by 50 K compared to reactions with inert gases, showcasing its potential for energy efficiency.

6. While carbon dioxide initially boosts the activity of the catalyst, it does not prevent the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction.

7. The introduction of potassium to gallium oxide catalysts reduces their activity. This suggests that the reaction occurs primarily on the acidic sites of the catalyst, and excessive potassium may block these active sites.

8. Treatment of gallium oxide catalysts with hydrogen leads to a slight decrease in the amount of carbon monoxide, suggesting that hydrogen can interact with the catalyst surface.

9. Carbon dioxide can remove carbon deposits through the Boudouard reaction, indicating its capability to mitigate the deactivation of the catalyst by carbon buildup.

10. XRD analyses confirm that gallium oxide catalysts remain stable during the dehydrogenation process, although the fresh catalyst appears more amorphous compared to the one after reaction.

5. 在二氧化碳与丙烷摩尔比为5的情况下，脱氢温度可降低50 K，与使用惰性气体相比，显示其能效潜力。

6. 虽然二氧化碳在初期提升催化剂活性，但它并不能阻止催化剂在反应期间的快速失活。

7. 向镓氧化物催化剂引入钾会降低其活性。这表明反应主要在催化剂的酸性位点进行，过量钾可能会阻塞这些活性位点。

8. 对镓氧化物催化剂进行氢处理导致碳一氧化合物量略有减少，暗示氢可以与催化剂表面相互作用。

9. 二氧化碳通过布杜瓦德反应去除碳沉积，显示其能够缓解催化剂由碳积累引起的失活能力。
