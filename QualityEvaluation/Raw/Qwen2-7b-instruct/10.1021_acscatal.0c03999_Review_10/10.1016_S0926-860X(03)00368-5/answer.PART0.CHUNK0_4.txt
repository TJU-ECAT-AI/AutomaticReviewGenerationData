<p>It was also calculated that in the presence of CO2 and at a molar ratio CO2/C3H8 = 5, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be 50 K lower than that for the dehydrogenation in the presence of inert gas.</p>
<p>The promoting role of carbon dioxide was only observed in the initial stage of reaction. However, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction.</p>
<p>The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity. The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.</p>

1. The document does not specifically compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. It focuses on the role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process.

2. The document discusses the impact of carbon dioxide on propylene yield, stating that in the presence of carbon dioxide, the equilibrium conversion of propane reaches 92% at a molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 = 5, compared to 75% conversion in the presence of an inert gas under the same conditions. This suggests that carbon dioxide enhances the initial activity of the catalyst, potentially leading to higher propylene yields.

3. The document notes that the introduction of potassium to gallium oxide leads to a loss of catalytic activity. It suggests that the reaction may proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, as potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.

1. 文档没有具体比较和对比不同硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯过程中的有效性。它主要关注二氧化碳在脱氢过程中的作用。

2. 文档讨论了二氧化碳对丙烯产率的影响，指出在二氧化碳的存在下，在碳原子比CO2/C3H8为5时，丙烷的平衡转化率达到92%，而仅在惰性气体存在下的相同条件下为75%。这表明二氧化碳可以增强催化剂的初始活性，可能提高丙烯产率。

3. 文档提到向镓氧化物中引入钾会导致催化活性的损失。它指出反应可能在催化剂的酸性位点上进行，因为钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂没有表现出高活性。
