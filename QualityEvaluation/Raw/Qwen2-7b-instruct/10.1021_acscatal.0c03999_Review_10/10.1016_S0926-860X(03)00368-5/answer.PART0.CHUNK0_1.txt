[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking."
[2] "Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."
[3] "The key problem is the development of a new catalyst with desirable selectivity."
[4] "It was also calculated that in the presence of CO2 and at a molar ratio CO2/C3H8 = 5, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be 50 K lower than that for the dehydrogenation in the presence of inert gas."
[5] "The promoting role of carbon dioxide was only observed in the initial stage of reaction."
[6] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity."

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants such as H2S, S2, and SO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is not discussed in the provided literature. However, the literature does mention the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a mild oxidant in ODHP, which allows the reaction to occur at relatively low temperatures with high selectivity towards propylene. The key challenge associated with using CO2 is developing a catalyst with desirable selectivity. Additionally, the literature notes that the promoting role of CO2 is only observed in the initial stage of the reaction, and it does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction. Furthermore, the introduction of potassium to gallium oxide leads to a loss of catalytic activity. Future research should focus on improving catalyst design and optimizing the overall process to address these challenges.

硫基氧化剂如H2S、S2和SO2在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯中的有效性未在提供的文献中讨论。然而，文献确实提到了使用二氧化碳（CO2）作为温和氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中，允许反应在较低温度下进行，并具有向丙烯的高选择性。与使用CO2相关的主要挑战是开发具有可接受选择性的催化剂。此外，文献指出，CO2的促进作用仅在反应的初始阶段观察到，它不抑制催化剂在反应过程中的快速失活。进一步的研究应集中在改进催化剂设计和优化整个过程以解决这些挑战上。
