[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking."
[2] "Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."
[3] "As was shown by thermodynamic considerations, propane conversion can be improved by coupling the reaction with the water-gas shift."
[4] "Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted towards products."
[5] "The promoting role of carbon dioxide was only observed in the initial stage of reaction."
[6] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity."
[7] "The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."

1. The document discusses the use of sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, it focuses on the effectiveness of carbon dioxide (CO2) in this context. CO2 offers advantages such as low temperature operation and high selectivity towards propylene. It enhances the initial activity of the gallium oxide catalyst, enabling a higher conversion and selectivity compared to argon under the same conditions. 

2. The document does not compare the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in the ODHP process. It emphasizes the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant, which can achieve a high yield of propene at relatively low temperatures. Challenges associated with CO2 include its consumption of hydrogen, which shifts the equilibrium towards products. However, its role in the initial stages of reaction is limited, and it does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction.

3. Potassium-promoted gallium oxide catalysts exhibit lower catalytic activity compared to unpromoted gallium oxide. This suggests that the reaction proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst, as potassium promotes catalysts do not show high activity. The document does not specify the challenges associated with each sulfur-based oxidant, focusing instead on CO2 as an effective mild oxidant in the ODHP process.

4. Future research directions aim to improve catalyst design and optimize the ODHP process. This includes exploring the development of new catalysts with desirable selectivity, reducing the formation of byproducts, and enhancing the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions. The document does not provide detailed suggestions for these areas of research, emphasizing instead the role of CO2 in improving the initial activity of gallium oxide catalysts in the ODHP process.

1. 文档讨论了在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯过程中硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）的应用，但重点是二氧化碳（CO2）的作用。CO2的优势在于能够在较低温度下实现高选择性地制备丙烯，并且与氧气相比，其可以降低反应温度。文档表明，CO2能够提高初始活性，使得在相同条件下丙烷转化率和选择性更高。

2. 文档没有比较不同硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯过程中的效果。它强调使用CO2作为温和的氧化剂，可以在相对较低温度下以高选择性生成丙烯。CO2的挑战包括消耗氢气，从而将平衡向产物方向移动。然而，在反应初期，CO2的作用有限，并且它不会抑制催化剂在反应过程中的快速失活。

3. 钾促进的镓氧化物催化剂的催化活性低于未促进的镓氧化物。这表明反应可能在催化剂的酸性位点上进行，因为钾促进的镓氧化物催化剂显示出较低的活性。文档没有详细说明每种硫基氧化剂的具体挑战，而是强调了使用CO2作为ODHP过程中的有效温和氧化剂。

4. 将来研究的方向旨在改进催化剂设计并优化ODHP过程。这包括探索开发具有高选择性的新催化剂、减少副产品的形成以及增强催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性。文档没有提供这些研究领域的具体建议，而是着重强调了在ODHP过程中使用CO2提高镓氧化物催化剂初始活性的作用。
