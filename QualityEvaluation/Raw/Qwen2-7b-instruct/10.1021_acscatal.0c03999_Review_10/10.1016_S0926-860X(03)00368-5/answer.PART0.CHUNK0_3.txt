[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propene has become very important. Propene is used in chemical industry for the synthesis of cumene, acrylonitrile and high purity polypropylene."
[2] "As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective."
[3] "However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene."
[4] "Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."
[5] "It was found that carbon dioxide enhance the initial activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst."
[6] "Under carbon dioxide atmosphere after reaction period 0.2 h, the propene yield reached 30.6%, while under argon 23.0%."
[7] "In the presence of CO2 and at a molar ratio CO2/C3H8 = 5, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be 50 K lower than that for the dehydrogenation in the presence of inert gas."
[8] "The promoting role of carbon dioxide was only observed in the initial stage of reaction. However, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction."
[9] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity. The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst,since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."
[10] "The amount of CO slightly decreased from 5.4 × 104 to 1.6×104 mmol after treatment of the Ga2O3 catalyst with hydrogen."

1. Propane to propene dehydrogenation has gained importance due to its applications in the production of cumene, acrylonitrile, and high-purity polypropylene. This process is inherently nonselective but can be optimized by utilizing mild oxidants like carbon dioxide.

2. The dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be nonselective because all CH bonds in propane have equal chances of reacting. However, to achieve high selectivity towards propene, it is crucial to control the reaction conditions and prevent overoxidation.

3. Oxygen-based oxidants are exothermic, posing challenges such as the need to remove heat efficiently to maintain high selectivity towards propene. Carbon dioxide offers an attractive alternative as it can perform the dehydrogenation at lower temperatures with high selectivity.

4. Carbon dioxide significantly enhances the initial activity of gallium oxide catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane. Under carbon dioxide atmosphere, the propene yield can reach up to 30.6% compared to 23.0% under argon.

5. The presence of carbon dioxide lowers the temperature required for dehydrogenation by 50 K compared to reactions with inert gases, showcasing its potential for energy efficiency.

6. While carbon dioxide initially boosts the activity of the catalyst, it does not prevent the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction.

7. The introduction of potassium to gallium oxide catalysts reduces their activity. This suggests that the reaction occurs primarily on the acidic sites of the catalyst, and excessive potassium may block these active sites.

8. Treatment of gallium oxide catalysts with hydrogen leads to a slight decrease in the amount of carbon monoxide, suggesting that hydrogen can interact with the catalyst surface.

9. Carbon dioxide can remove carbon deposits through the Boudouard reaction, indicating its capability to mitigate the deactivation of the catalyst by carbon buildup.

10. XRD analyses confirm that gallium oxide catalysts remain stable during the dehydrogenation process, although the fresh catalyst appears more amorphous compared to the one after reaction.

1. 烷烃脱氢制丙烯已成为重要途径，用于合成苯甲醚、丙烯腈和高纯度聚丙烯。这一过程固有非选择性，但可通过利用温和氧化剂如二氧化碳优化。

2. 烷烃脱氢反应因所有丙烷中的CH键具有相等反应机会而预期为非选择性的。然而，为了提高丙烯的选择性，必须控制反应条件并防止过氧化。

3. 氧基氧化剂是放热的，存在挑战，需要有效移除热量以维持高丙烯选择性。二氧化碳提供了吸引人的替代方案，在较低温度下实现高丙烯选择性脱氢。

4. 二氧化碳显著增强了镓氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的初始活性。在二氧化碳气氛下，丙烯产率可达到30.6%，而氩气中仅为23.0%。
