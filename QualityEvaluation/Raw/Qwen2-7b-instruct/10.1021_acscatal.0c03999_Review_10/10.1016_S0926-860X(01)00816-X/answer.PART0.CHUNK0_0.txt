[1] "Early work in this area was conducted by Thorsteinson et al. using a vanadium molybdenum niobium oxide catalyst [30,31], and a number of papers and patents based on that work have been issued by Union Carbide Corp. and other laboratories [3239]. Ethane is thought to react with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can then undergo a beta-elimination process to form ethy- lene."

[2] "In the oxidative coupling of methane, ethane and ethylene are major products, and ethylene has been shown to be derived from ethane [8082]. The dehydrogena- tion or oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene,must occur over these catalysts, and since the overall selectivity is high, the selectivity to ethylene must be good."

[3] "Workers at Phillips Petroleum Company have ex- amined catalysts comprising lithium, titanium, and manganese, and catalysts comprising cobalt, phos- phorous, and at least one promoter selected from a list of elements [51,52]."

[4] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 650800 C is conducted with a variety of materials, most not containing the elements molybdenum and vanadium, which are common in lower-temperature catalysts."

[5] "A variety of catalysts for propane oxydehydrogena- tion have been examined recently at temperatures be- low 700 C [6975]. Particularly, notable for its high selectivity to propylene is a vanadia-silica-zirconia catalyst of Rulkens and Tilley at the University of California, Berkley, CA [75]."

[6] "Alfonso, Julbe, Farrusseng, Men endez, and Santa- mar a at the University of Zaragoza, Spain, and the Laboratoire des Mat eriaux et Proc ed es Membranaires, France, examined the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over V-Al2O3 catalytic membranes which al- low separation of propane and oxygen feeds [78]."

[7] "Creaser et al. at Lulea University of Technol- ogy, Sweden, University of Waterloo, Canada, and Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, exam- ined cyclic operation of the oxidative dehydrogena- tion of propane over a V-Mg-O catalyst [79]."

The literature discusses the comparison of different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. Key points include:

1. **Vanadium Molybdenum Niobium Oxide Catalyst**: This catalyst allows ethane to react with molybdenum or vanadium, forming surface ethoxide which undergoes beta-elimination to produce ethylene. It shows high selectivity for ethylene formation.

2. **Oxidative Coupling of Methane**: The catalysts used here enable the production of ethane and ethylene, with ethylene being derived from ethane. These catalysts are effective for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene.

3. **Lithium, Titanium, and Manganese Catalysts**: These catalysts are examined for their potential in ODHP. They offer a different approach to traditional sulfur-based catalysts.

4. **Sulfur-Free High-Temperature Catalysts**: For ODHP, catalysts not containing common sulfur elements like molybdenum and vanadium are used at higher temperatures.

5. **Vanadia-Silica-Zirconia Catalyst**: This catalyst, developed by Rulkens and Tilley, shows high selectivity for propylene formation at low propane conversions. Zirconium is crucial for retaining high selectivity.

6. **V-Al2O3 Catalytic Membranes**: These membranes allow for the separation of propane and oxygen feeds, enhancing propylene selectivity in ODHP.

7. **Cyclic Operation of V-Mg-O Catalysts**: Creaser et al. examined the use of cyclic operation with V-Mg-O catalysts, showing increased propylene selectivity compared to steady-state operation.

**Challenges and Future Research**:
- **Byproduct Formation**: Sulfur-based oxidants can lead to unwanted byproducts like carbon oxides, requiring careful catalyst design to minimize these.
- **Catalyst Design**: Developing catalysts that can selectively convert propane to propylene without producing byproducts is a key area for future research.
- **Process Optimization**: Improving the overall efficiency of the ODHP process, including optimizing reaction conditions, catalyst loading, and process flow, remains critical.

文献讨论了不同硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯过程中的比较。关键点包括：

1. **钒钼铌氧化物催化剂**：这种催化剂允许乙烷与钼或钒反应，形成表面乙氧基，然后进行β消除以生成乙烯。它显示出高乙烯选择性。

2. **甲烷氧化耦合**：这里使用的催化剂能够产生乙烷和乙烯，其中乙烯是从乙烷产生的。这些催化剂对于乙烷脱氢至乙烯非常有效。

3. **锂、钛和锰催化剂**：这些催化剂被研究用于其在ODHP中的潜力。它们提供了一种不同于传统硫基催化剂的方法。

4. **不含常见硫元素的高温催化剂**：对于ODHP，不含常见硫元素如钼和钒的催化剂在较高温度下使用。

5. **二氧化硅-氧化钇-氧化锆催化剂**：鲁肯斯和蒂利开发的这种催化剂，在低丙烷转化率时显示出高丙烯选择性。氧化钇对于保持高选择性至关重要。
