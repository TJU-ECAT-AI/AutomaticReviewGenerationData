[1] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."
[3] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutylene."
[4] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."

1. The reaction pathways for heavy paraffin dehydrogenation are more complex than those for light paraffin dehydrogenation. Heavy paraffins can form cyclic compounds via dehydrocyclization, whereas light paraffins do not exhibit this behavior.

2. Catalytic dehydrogenation for olefin production has a long history dating back to the late 1930s. During World War II, butanes were dehydrogenated over chromia-alumina catalysts for aviation fuel production. Companies such as UOP, Phillips Petroleum, and Houdry later developed and commercialized various dehydrogenation technologies.

3. The choice of reactor design significantly influences the success of catalytic processes. Factors such as low pressure drop, plug flow, catalyst addition/removal, and heat transfer coefficient vary among different reactor types.

4. Oxydehydrogenation presents challenges including handling explosive paraffin-oxygen mixtures, maintaining safe paraffin-oxygen compositions, and achieving high olefin selectivity. Additionally, the thermodynamic equilibrium constraint on conversion is removed by oxydehydrogenation, but this comes with its own set of challenges.

1. 重正构烷烃脱氢化反应途径比轻正构烷烃脱氢化更复杂。重正构烷烃可以形成环状化合物通过脱氢环化，而轻正构烷烃不表现出这种行为。

2. 脱氢化用于生产烯烃的历史可以追溯到20世纪30年代后期。在第二次世界大战期间，铬氧化铝催化剂用于将丁烷脱氢化以生产航空燃料。后来，UOP、菲利普斯石油公司和Houdry等公司开发并商业化了各种脱氢化技术。

3. 反应器设计的选择对催化过程的成功有重大影响。不同类型的反应器在低压力降、插流流动、催化剂添加/移除以及热传导系数等方面存在差异。

4. 氧化脱氢化面临挑战包括处理爆炸性的正构烷烃-氧气混合物，保持安全的正构烷烃-氧气组成，并实现高烯烃选择性。此外，脱氢化过程中热力学平衡约束上的转化率被氧化脱氢化所去除，但这也带来了一系列自己的挑战。
