The comparison between sulfur-based oxidants and conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene reveals distinct impacts on propylene yield and challenges associated with each oxidant. 

### Sulfur-Based Oxidants

1. **H2S**: This sulfur-based oxidant has been explored in the context of ODHP. Its effectiveness and the resulting propylene yield would depend on the specific conditions and catalyst used. Challenges associated with H2S include byproduct formation, which might complicate the separation process and affect overall efficiency.

2. **S2**: S2, another sulfur-based oxidant, similarly introduces the potential for byproduct formation and complicates the separation process. The efficiency of S2 in ODHP compared to conventional oxidants would depend on its compatibility with the catalysts used and the optimization of reaction conditions.

3. **SO2**: SO2 presents a more traditional sulfur-based oxidant option for ODHP. Its impact on propylene yield and the challenges it poses might vary based on the specific catalyst employed and the operational parameters. SO2 might offer a balance between yield optimization and byproduct management, depending on the catalyst's selectivity and the process conditions.

### Conventional Oxidants

Conventional oxidants, such as oxygen, are typically used in ODHP. They offer a more established pathway for the conversion of hydrocarbons into olefins. The selectivity and yield of propylene are influenced by the reaction conditions, catalyst properties, and the specific oxidant concentration and pressure used. Challenges associated with conventional oxidants often include the risk of undesired side reactions, such as cracking of hydrocarbons, and the complexity of process control to maintain high selectivity and yield.

### Future Research Areas

Future research in improving catalyst design and optimizing the ODHP process might focus on:

- **Catalyst Design**: Developing catalysts that can selectively convert hydrocarbons to olefins without forming significant byproducts, particularly focusing on sulfur-based oxidants.
- **Reaction Conditions**: Optimizing temperature, pressure, and flow rates to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted reactions and byproducts.
- **Process Integration**: Enhancing the integration of separation techniques to efficiently remove byproducts and recover propylene, especially in scenarios involving sulfur-based oxidants.
- **Economic Feasibility**: Addressing the economic implications of using sulfur-based oxidants, considering the cost of sulfur and potential environmental impacts.

### Challenges and Opportunities

The use of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP presents opportunities for potentially more efficient and selective conversion processes. However, they also introduce challenges related to byproduct formation, separation complexities, and catalyst stability. Future research aims to overcome these challenges through innovative catalyst design, optimized process conditions, and advanced separation techniques, ultimately aiming to enhance the economic viability and environmental sustainability of the ODHP process.
