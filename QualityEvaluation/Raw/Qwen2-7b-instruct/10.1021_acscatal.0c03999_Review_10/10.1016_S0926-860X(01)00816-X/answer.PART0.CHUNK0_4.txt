[1] "Though oxydehydrogenation is thermodynamically favored at even ambient conditions, no catalyst has been discovered that can provide such a true oxidative conversion at temperatures below 300 C. Catalysts discovered by Union Carbide that operate at 300400 C [8082],are the best known catalysts for producing ethylene (with co-production of some acetic acid in varying amounts)."
[2] "Under these conditions, it is very difficult to avoid undesirable partial/total oxidation to CO and CO2 via gas phase and surface reactions."
[3] "Therefore, the challenge for oxydehydrogenation catalysis is to develop highly active and selective catalysts for totally selective oxidation of alkanes to alkenes."

1. Conventional oxidants, such as sulfur-based compounds (H2S, S2, SO2), have been used in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene. These oxidants enable a thermodynamically favorable process at ambient conditions, but they face challenges in avoiding unwanted oxidation to CO and CO2. This necessitates the development of catalysts that can selectively convert alkanes to alkenes without generating byproducts.

2. The challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP include the difficulty in preventing partial or total oxidation to CO and CO2 through both gas-phase and surface reactions. This makes the optimization of the process and the design of efficient catalysts a critical area of focus.

3. The key challenge for oxydehydrogenation catalysis is to create highly active and selective catalysts that can selectively oxidize alkanes to alkenes. This is necessary to overcome the issue of undesired oxidation and to maximize propylene yield.

1. 常用的氧化剂，如硫基化合物（H2S、S2、SO2），已被用于丙烷的氧化脱氢制丙烯过程。这些氧化剂允许在环境条件下进行有利的热力学过程，但它们面临避免通过气相和表面反应不希望的CO和CO2氧化的挑战。这需要开发能够选择性地将烷烃转化为烯烃而不产生副产品的催化剂。

2. 硫基氧化剂在ODHP中的挑战包括难以防止通过气相和表面反应产生部分或完全氧化到CO和CO2。这使得优化过程和催化剂设计成为关注的重点领域。

3. 氧化脱氢催化的关键挑战是创建高度活性和选择性的催化剂，以选择性地氧化烷烃为烯烃。这有必要的目的是克服不希望的氧化问题，并最大化丙烯产量。
