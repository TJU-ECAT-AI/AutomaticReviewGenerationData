[1] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
[2] "Since the primary step of interaction of gas-phase O2 with a reduced VOx site should not depend on temperature, it can be safely expected that such species are also formed under true ODH conditions and react even faster with the hydrocarbons."
[3] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions."

Comparing sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the literature focuses on oxygen-based oxidants (O2 and N2O) rather than sulfur-based ones. However, based on the context provided, the effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants in this process can be inferred through their impact on propylene yield, byproduct formation, and catalyst design optimization. 

1. **Propylene Yield**: The presence of highly reactive oxygen species from O2 can lead to increased propene yield due to faster reaction rates. These species are more active, potentially burning propene more efficiently. Conversely, the use of N2O leads to higher propene selectivity because it forms nucleophilic oxide ions that are less reactive.

2. **Challenges with Oxidants**: The literature does not explicitly mention the specific challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2. However, it is likely that these oxidants could introduce sulfur compounds into the product stream as byproducts, affecting purity. This contrasts with the use of oxygen-based oxidants, where sulfur is not introduced into the process.

3. **Future Research**: To improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process, future research should focus on developing catalysts that can effectively utilize sulfur-based oxidants while minimizing byproduct formation. This could involve creating catalysts that selectively remove sulfur compounds or that are inherently resistant to sulfur poisoning. Additionally, studying the interactions between sulfur-based oxidants and catalyst surfaces could provide insights into optimizing reaction conditions and catalyst stability.

在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中，丙烯（propylene）从丙烷（propane）转化为丙烯的效率与基于硫的氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）相比，文献主要关注氧气基氧化剂（O2和N2O）。然而，根据提供的上下文，可以推断出基于硫的氧化剂在这过程中的有效性，特别是在丙烯产率、副产品形成以及催化剂设计优化方面的影响。

1. **丙烯产率**：从氧气（O2）产生的高度活性氧物种可能导致丙烯产率增加，因为反应速率更快。这些物种更为活跃，可能更有效地燃烧丙烯。相比之下，使用N2O可导致更高的丙烯选择性，因为它们形成了核亲性的氧离子，活性较低但选择性更强。

2. **氧化剂的挑战**：文献没有明确提到硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）的具体挑战。然而，可以推测，这些氧化剂可能会引入硫化合物作为副产品进入产品流，影响纯度。这与使用氧气基氧化剂的情况形成对比，后者不会引入硫元素到过程中。

3. **未来研究**：为了改进催化剂设计并优化整体过程，未来的研究应集中在开发能够有效利用硫基氧化剂同时减少副产品形成的催化剂上。这可能涉及创建能够选择性去除硫化合物或本身具有抗硫中毒能力的催化剂。此外，研究硫基氧化剂与催化剂表面的相互作用可以提供优化反应条件和催化剂稳定性的见解。
