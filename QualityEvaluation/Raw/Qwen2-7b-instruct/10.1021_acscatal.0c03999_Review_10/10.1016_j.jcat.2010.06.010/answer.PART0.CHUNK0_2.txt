[1] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."
[2] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions."

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP to propylene compared to conventional oxidants depends on several factors including propylene yield, byproduct formation, and the challenges associated with each oxidant. 

H2S, S2, and SO2 can enhance propylene yield due to their reactivity with hydrocarbons. However, they also form byproducts such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide, which need to be removed from the product stream. Challenges associated with these oxidants include the potential for corrosion in the reactor due to the presence of sulfur compounds and the complexity of the purification process to isolate propylene from the byproducts.

Future research aims to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process by focusing on developing more efficient catalysts that can selectively convert hydrocarbons to propylene while minimizing byproduct formation. This includes studying the interaction of sulfur-based oxidants with different types of catalysts and identifying the optimal operating conditions for maximum propylene yield and minimum byproduct formation.

硫基氧化剂在丙烯脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯的有效性与传统氧化剂相比，取决于几个因素，包括丙烯产量、副产品的形成以及每种氧化剂的挑战。

H2S、S2和SO2可以增强丙烯产量，由于它们与碳氢化合物的反应活性。然而，它们也会形成副产品，如硫化氢和二氧化硫，需要从产品流中去除。这些氧化剂相关的挑战包括由于硫化合物的存在可能导致反应器腐蚀，以及从副产品中隔离丙烯的复杂净化过程。

未来的研究旨在通过改进催化剂设计和优化整个过程来提高其有效性。这包括研究不同类型的催化剂与硫基氧化剂的相互作用，并确定最大丙烯产量和最小副产品形成的最优操作条件。
