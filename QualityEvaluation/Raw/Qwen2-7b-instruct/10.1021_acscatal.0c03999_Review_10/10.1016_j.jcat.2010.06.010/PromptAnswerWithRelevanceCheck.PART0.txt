[1] "By EPR measurements under controlled atmosphere conditions at two different microwave frequencies (X- and Q-band), the formation of a Vn+  O (n = 4, 5) radical anion species has been detected on the surface of a prereduced 2.7 wt.% VOx/MCM-41 catalyst after contact with gas-phase O2 and identified by spectra simulation."
[2] "The previously claimed formation of a molecular Vn+  O2 oxygen radical [27] could not be confirmed."
[3] "The Vn+  O species was found to be surprisingly stable in inert N2 atmosphere, being weakly visible even after 30 min at 348 K."
[4] "However, it reacts to a considerable extent with C3H8 already at room temperature and is completely consumed by C3H6 and CO under the same conditions."
[5] "In contrast, neither such paramagnetic Vn+  O site nor any other EPR-active oxygen radical species could be detected upon reoxidation of the same prereduced VOx/MCM-41 by N2O."
[6] "From the fact that no O is evidenced by EPR, we conclude that transfer of a second electron might be very fast and a diamagnetic O2 oxide ion is formed and incorporated in the catalyst structure."
[7] "The higher activity and lower selectivity observed in the ODH of propane with O2 in comparison with N2O is attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic O species in the former case (which preferentially burn propene), while nucleophilic, less active but more selective O2 ions serve as reactants in ODH of propane with N2O."

1. The study revealed the formation of a Vn+  O (n = 4, 5) radical anion species on a prereduced 2.7 wt.% VOx/MCM-41 catalyst after exposure to gas-phase O2, which was identified through EPR spectral simulations. This species was found to be stable in N2 atmosphere but highly reactive towards hydrocarbons like propane, propene, and CO.

2. The previously proposed formation of a molecular Vn+  O2 oxygen radical was not confirmed in the current research.

3. The detected Vn+  O species was remarkably stable in inert N2 conditions, persisting even after 30 minutes at 348 K. 

4. Upon contact with propane at room temperature, this species reacted significantly, completely consuming it. It also reacted with propene and CO under the same conditions.

5. Contrary to O2, no EPR-active oxygen radical species were detected upon reoxidation of the catalyst with N2O. This implies that the formation of reactive oxygen species is dependent on the oxidant type.

6. The absence of O signals in EPR suggests that the transfer of a second electron to form an O2 oxide ion is swift and occurs within the catalyst structure upon N2O reoxidation.

7. The higher activity but lower selectivity observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with O2 is attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species, which preferentially consume propene. In contrast, N2O forms less reactive but more selective nucleophilic oxygen species.

1. 研究揭示了在暴露于氧气的情况下，一种prereduced 2.7 wt.% VOx/MCM-41催化剂表面形成了一种Vn+  O（n=4, 5）自由基阴离子物种，并通过电子顺磁共振光谱模拟进行了识别。该物种在氮气气氛中表现出惊人的稳定性，在348 K条件下持续30分钟后仍能部分可见。

2. 之前提出的形成分子Vn+  O2氧自由基的说法未得到证实。

3. 在惰性氮气气氛下检测到的Vn+  O物种具有显著稳定性，甚至在348 K条件下持续30分钟后仍能部分可见。

4. 在室温下，这种物种与丙烷反应明显，完全消耗了它。它也与丙烯和CO在相同的条件下反应。

5. 相比之下，当用N2O重新氧化同一prereduced VOx/MCM-41催化剂时，没有检测到任何EPR活性氧自由基物种。这表明氧气物种的形成取决于氧化剂类型。

6. 缺失的O信号表明，在N2O重新氧化过程中，快速形成了一个迅速转移第二个电子并形成O2氧化物离子的催化结构。

7. 在使用氧气进行丙烷氧化脱氢时观察到的较高活性但较低选择性可以归因于高度反应性的亲电氧物种的存在，这些物种优先消耗丙烯。相比之下，N2O形成了反应性较低但更选择性的亲核氧物种。

[1] "Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO."
[2] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."
[3] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions."

Comparing different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the effectiveness is largely determined by their impact on propylene yield, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant (including byproduct formation), and the key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process. 

The document specifically discusses the use of O2 and N2O as oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over a VOx/MCM-41 catalyst. It identifies the formation of a Vn+  O (n = 4, 5) radical anion species upon reoxidation of the catalyst by O2, which is found to be highly reactive with hydrocarbons at room temperature. This leads to lower propene selectivity compared to N2O, where no EPR-active oxygen radical species are detected. The formation of paramagnetic oxygen species from O2 is attributed to the higher activity but lower selectivity observed in ODHP, while nucleophilic oxide ions are suggested to participate in the reaction with N2O, leading to higher propene selectivity.

Future research should focus on understanding the differences in the nature of surface oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O, as well as exploring the effects of catalyst design and optimization to improve the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process. Additionally, investigating the formation and reactivity of oxygen species from sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 could provide insights into alternative methods for enhancing propylene yield and minimizing byproduct formation.

在将丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯（ODHP）的过程中，比较不同的硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂的效果，主要由它们对丙烯产量的影响、每种氧化剂的具体挑战（包括副产物形成），以及未来研究改进催化剂设计和优化整体过程的关键领域决定。

文献特别讨论了氧气（O2）和氮氧化物（N2O）作为ODHP催化剂氧化剂的应用。它识别出在O2重新氧化催化剂时形成的Vn+  O（n=4, 5）自由基物种，并发现这种物种在室温下对烃类高度反应，导致较低的丙烯选择性。与使用N2O时未检测到任何EPR活性氧物种相比，从O2形成的氧物种被归因于在ODHP过程中观察到的更高活性但选择性较低。N2O反应可能通过参与核磷氧离子进行，导致更高的丙烯选择性。

未来的研究应集中在理解从O2和N2O形成的不同表面氧物种的性质差异，以及探索催化剂设计和优化方法，以提高ODHP过程的效率和选择性。此外，研究硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）形成和活性氧物种的形成，可以提供增强丙烯产率和减少副产物形成的替代方法。

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP to propylene compared to conventional oxidants depends on several factors including propylene yield, byproduct formation, and the challenges associated with each oxidant. 

H2S, S2, and SO2 can enhance propylene yield due to their reactivity with hydrocarbons. However, they also form byproducts such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide, which need to be removed from the product stream. Challenges associated with these oxidants include the potential for corrosion in the reactor due to the presence of sulfur compounds and the complexity of the purification process to isolate propylene from the byproducts.

Future research aims to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process by focusing on developing more efficient catalysts that can selectively convert hydrocarbons to propylene while minimizing byproduct formation. This includes studying the interaction of sulfur-based oxidants with different types of catalysts and identifying the optimal operating conditions for maximum propylene yield and minimum byproduct formation.

硫基氧化剂在丙烯脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯的有效性与传统氧化剂相比，取决于几个因素，包括丙烯产量、副产品的形成以及每种氧化剂的挑战。

H2S、S2和SO2可以增强丙烯产量，由于它们与碳氢化合物的反应活性。然而，它们也会形成副产品，如硫化氢和二氧化硫，需要从产品流中去除。这些氧化剂相关的挑战包括由于硫化合物的存在可能导致反应器腐蚀，以及从副产品中隔离丙烯的复杂净化过程。

未来的研究旨在通过改进催化剂设计和优化整个过程来提高其有效性。这包括研究不同类型的催化剂与硫基氧化剂的相互作用，并确定最大丙烯产量和最小副产品形成的最优操作条件。

Comparing sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the literature focuses on oxygen-based oxidants (O2 and N2O) rather than sulfur-based ones. However, based on the context provided, the effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants in this process can be inferred through their impact on propylene yield, byproduct formation, and catalyst design optimization. 

1. **Propylene Yield**: The presence of highly reactive oxygen species from O2 can lead to increased propene yield due to faster reaction rates. These species are more active, potentially burning propene more efficiently. Conversely, the use of N2O leads to higher propene selectivity because it forms nucleophilic oxide ions that are less reactive.

2. **Challenges with Oxidants**: The literature does not explicitly mention the specific challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2. However, it is likely that these oxidants could introduce sulfur compounds into the product stream as byproducts, affecting purity. This contrasts with the use of oxygen-based oxidants, where sulfur is not introduced into the process.

3. **Future Research**: To improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process, future research should focus on developing catalysts that can effectively utilize sulfur-based oxidants while minimizing byproduct formation. This could involve creating catalysts that selectively remove sulfur compounds or that are inherently resistant to sulfur poisoning. Additionally, studying the interactions between sulfur-based oxidants and catalyst surfaces could provide insights into optimizing reaction conditions and catalyst stability.

在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中，丙烯（propylene）从丙烷（propane）转化为丙烯的效率与基于硫的氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）相比，文献主要关注氧气基氧化剂（O2和N2O）。然而，根据提供的上下文，可以推断出基于硫的氧化剂在这过程中的有效性，特别是在丙烯产率、副产品形成以及催化剂设计优化方面的影响。

1. **丙烯产率**：从氧气（O2）产生的高度活性氧物种可能导致丙烯产率增加，因为反应速率更快。这些物种更为活跃，可能更有效地燃烧丙烯。相比之下，使用N2O可导致更高的丙烯选择性，因为它们形成了核亲性的氧离子，活性较低但选择性更强。

2. **氧化剂的挑战**：文献没有明确提到硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）的具体挑战。然而，可以推测，这些氧化剂可能会引入硫化合物作为副产品进入产品流，影响纯度。这与使用氧气基氧化剂的情况形成对比，后者不会引入硫元素到过程中。

3. **未来研究**：为了改进催化剂设计并优化整体过程，未来的研究应集中在开发能够有效利用硫基氧化剂同时减少副产品形成的催化剂上。这可能涉及创建能够选择性去除硫化合物或本身具有抗硫中毒能力的催化剂。此外，研究硫基氧化剂与催化剂表面的相互作用可以提供优化反应条件和催化剂稳定性的见解。

[1] "In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."
[2] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."
[3] "This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene varies significantly. In the context of the provided document, N2O (nitrous oxide) was found to enhance propene selectivity in ODHP over VOx/MCM-41 catalysts compared to O2 (oxygen). The higher propene selectivity with N2O could be attributed to the formation of less reactive, more selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface. These species likely prevent the direct oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, contributing to higher propene yields.

Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design to efficiently utilize sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2. Key areas include understanding the specific challenges posed by each oxidant, such as byproduct formation, and developing strategies to minimize these byproducts. Additionally, improving the stability and activity of catalysts under reaction conditions is crucial for enhancing propylene yields and selectivity. Investigating the interaction mechanisms between sulfur-based oxidants and catalyst surfaces could also provide insights into how to tailor catalyst properties for optimal performance in ODHP processes.

在氧化脱氢反应中，不同硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）对丙烷转化为丙烯的效果存在显著差异。根据提供的文档，在使用VOx/MCM-41催化剂的情况下，与氧气相比，使用N2O（一氧化二氮）在丙烷转化率约为10%时，可以提高丙烯的选择性，达到80%，而使用氧气时仅为50%。N2O提高丙烯选择性的原因可能是催化剂表面形成的较不活泼、更选择性的氧物种。这些物种可能阻止丙烯直接氧化为碳氧化物，从而提高丙烯的产量。

未来的研究应集中在优化催化剂设计以有效利用硫基氧化剂。关键领域包括理解每种氧化剂所面临的特定挑战，如副产物形成，并开发策略来最小化这些副产物。此外，提高在反应条件下催化剂的稳定性和活性对于提高丙烯产量和选择性至关重要。研究硫基氧化剂与催化剂表面的相互作用机制也可能提供有关如何定制催化剂性质以实现最优性能的见解。
