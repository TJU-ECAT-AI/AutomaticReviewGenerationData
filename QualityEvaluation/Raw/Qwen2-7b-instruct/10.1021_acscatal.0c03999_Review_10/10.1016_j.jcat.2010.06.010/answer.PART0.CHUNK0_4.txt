[1] "In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."
[2] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."
[3] "This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene varies significantly. In the context of the provided document, N2O (nitrous oxide) was found to enhance propene selectivity in ODHP over VOx/MCM-41 catalysts compared to O2 (oxygen). The higher propene selectivity with N2O could be attributed to the formation of less reactive, more selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface. These species likely prevent the direct oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, contributing to higher propene yields.

Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design to efficiently utilize sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2. Key areas include understanding the specific challenges posed by each oxidant, such as byproduct formation, and developing strategies to minimize these byproducts. Additionally, improving the stability and activity of catalysts under reaction conditions is crucial for enhancing propylene yields and selectivity. Investigating the interaction mechanisms between sulfur-based oxidants and catalyst surfaces could also provide insights into how to tailor catalyst properties for optimal performance in ODHP processes.

在氧化脱氢反应中，不同硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）对丙烷转化为丙烯的效果存在显著差异。根据提供的文档，在使用VOx/MCM-41催化剂的情况下，与氧气相比，使用N2O（一氧化二氮）在丙烷转化率约为10%时，可以提高丙烯的选择性，达到80%，而使用氧气时仅为50%。N2O提高丙烯选择性的原因可能是催化剂表面形成的较不活泼、更选择性的氧物种。这些物种可能阻止丙烯直接氧化为碳氧化物，从而提高丙烯的产量。

未来的研究应集中在优化催化剂设计以有效利用硫基氧化剂。关键领域包括理解每种氧化剂所面临的特定挑战，如副产物形成，并开发策略来最小化这些副产物。此外，提高在反应条件下催化剂的稳定性和活性对于提高丙烯产量和选择性至关重要。研究硫基氧化剂与催化剂表面的相互作用机制也可能提供有关如何定制催化剂性质以实现最优性能的见解。
