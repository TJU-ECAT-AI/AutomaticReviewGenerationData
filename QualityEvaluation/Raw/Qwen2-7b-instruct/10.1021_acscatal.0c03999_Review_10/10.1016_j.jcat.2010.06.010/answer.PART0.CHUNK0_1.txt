[1] "Since several of the previously postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO."
[2] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."
[3] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions."

Comparing different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the effectiveness is largely determined by their impact on propylene yield, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant (including byproduct formation), and the key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process. 

The document specifically discusses the use of O2 and N2O as oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over a VOx/MCM-41 catalyst. It identifies the formation of a Vn+  O (n = 4, 5) radical anion species upon reoxidation of the catalyst by O2, which is found to be highly reactive with hydrocarbons at room temperature. This leads to lower propene selectivity compared to N2O, where no EPR-active oxygen radical species are detected. The formation of paramagnetic oxygen species from O2 is attributed to the higher activity but lower selectivity observed in ODHP, while nucleophilic oxide ions are suggested to participate in the reaction with N2O, leading to higher propene selectivity.

Future research should focus on understanding the differences in the nature of surface oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O, as well as exploring the effects of catalyst design and optimization to improve the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process. Additionally, investigating the formation and reactivity of oxygen species from sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 could provide insights into alternative methods for enhancing propylene yield and minimizing byproduct formation.

在将丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯（ODHP）的过程中，比较不同的硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂的效果，主要由它们对丙烯产量的影响、每种氧化剂的具体挑战（包括副产物形成），以及未来研究改进催化剂设计和优化整体过程的关键领域决定。

文献特别讨论了氧气（O2）和氮氧化物（N2O）作为ODHP催化剂氧化剂的应用。它识别出在O2重新氧化催化剂时形成的Vn+  O（n=4, 5）自由基物种，并发现这种物种在室温下对烃类高度反应，导致较低的丙烯选择性。与使用N2O时未检测到任何EPR活性氧物种相比，从O2形成的氧物种被归因于在ODHP过程中观察到的更高活性但选择性较低。N2O反应可能通过参与核磷氧离子进行，导致更高的丙烯选择性。

未来的研究应集中在理解从O2和N2O形成的不同表面氧物种的性质差异，以及探索催化剂设计和优化方法，以提高ODHP过程的效率和选择性。此外，研究硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）形成和活性氧物种的形成，可以提供增强丙烯产率和减少副产物形成的替代方法。
