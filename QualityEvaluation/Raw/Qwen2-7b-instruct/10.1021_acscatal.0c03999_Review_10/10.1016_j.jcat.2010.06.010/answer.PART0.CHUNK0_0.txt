[1] "By EPR measurements under controlled atmosphere conditions at two different microwave frequencies (X- and Q-band), the formation of a Vn+  O (n = 4, 5) radical anion species has been detected on the surface of a prereduced 2.7 wt.% VOx/MCM-41 catalyst after contact with gas-phase O2 and identified by spectra simulation."
[2] "The previously claimed formation of a molecular Vn+  O2 oxygen radical [27] could not be confirmed."
[3] "The Vn+  O species was found to be surprisingly stable in inert N2 atmosphere, being weakly visible even after 30 min at 348 K."
[4] "However, it reacts to a considerable extent with C3H8 already at room temperature and is completely consumed by C3H6 and CO under the same conditions."
[5] "In contrast, neither such paramagnetic Vn+  O site nor any other EPR-active oxygen radical species could be detected upon reoxidation of the same prereduced VOx/MCM-41 by N2O."
[6] "From the fact that no O is evidenced by EPR, we conclude that transfer of a second electron might be very fast and a diamagnetic O2 oxide ion is formed and incorporated in the catalyst structure."
[7] "The higher activity and lower selectivity observed in the ODH of propane with O2 in comparison with N2O is attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic O species in the former case (which preferentially burn propene), while nucleophilic, less active but more selective O2 ions serve as reactants in ODH of propane with N2O."

1. The study revealed the formation of a Vn+  O (n = 4, 5) radical anion species on a prereduced 2.7 wt.% VOx/MCM-41 catalyst after exposure to gas-phase O2, which was identified through EPR spectral simulations. This species was found to be stable in N2 atmosphere but highly reactive towards hydrocarbons like propane, propene, and CO.

2. The previously proposed formation of a molecular Vn+  O2 oxygen radical was not confirmed in the current research.

3. The detected Vn+  O species was remarkably stable in inert N2 conditions, persisting even after 30 minutes at 348 K. 

4. Upon contact with propane at room temperature, this species reacted significantly, completely consuming it. It also reacted with propene and CO under the same conditions.

5. Contrary to O2, no EPR-active oxygen radical species were detected upon reoxidation of the catalyst with N2O. This implies that the formation of reactive oxygen species is dependent on the oxidant type.

6. The absence of O signals in EPR suggests that the transfer of a second electron to form an O2 oxide ion is swift and occurs within the catalyst structure upon N2O reoxidation.

7. The higher activity but lower selectivity observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with O2 is attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species, which preferentially consume propene. In contrast, N2O forms less reactive but more selective nucleophilic oxygen species.

1. 研究揭示了在暴露于氧气的情况下，一种prereduced 2.7 wt.% VOx/MCM-41催化剂表面形成了一种Vn+  O（n=4, 5）自由基阴离子物种，并通过电子顺磁共振光谱模拟进行了识别。该物种在氮气气氛中表现出惊人的稳定性，在348 K条件下持续30分钟后仍能部分可见。

2. 之前提出的形成分子Vn+  O2氧自由基的说法未得到证实。

3. 在惰性氮气气氛下检测到的Vn+  O物种具有显著稳定性，甚至在348 K条件下持续30分钟后仍能部分可见。

4. 在室温下，这种物种与丙烷反应明显，完全消耗了它。它也与丙烯和CO在相同的条件下反应。

5. 相比之下，当用N2O重新氧化同一prereduced VOx/MCM-41催化剂时，没有检测到任何EPR活性氧自由基物种。这表明氧气物种的形成取决于氧化剂类型。

6. 缺失的O信号表明，在N2O重新氧化过程中，快速形成了一个迅速转移第二个电子并形成O2氧化物离子的催化结构。

7. 在使用氧气进行丙烷氧化脱氢时观察到的较高活性但较低选择性可以归因于高度反应性的亲电氧物种的存在，这些物种优先消耗丙烯。相比之下，N2O形成了反应性较低但更选择性的亲核氧物种。
