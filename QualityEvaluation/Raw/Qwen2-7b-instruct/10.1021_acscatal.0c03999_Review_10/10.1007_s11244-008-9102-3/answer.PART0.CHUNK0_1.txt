[1] "The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD [ Li-Na-MD [ Li-MD [ K-MD [ Na-MD."
[2] "The maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is obtained above the temperature, at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts staying nearly constant thereafter."
[3] "Catalysts having molten alkali metal chloride phases under reaction conditions show much higher olefin selectivities than solid chloride containing catalysts."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is compared against conventional oxidants. The key aspects include the impact on propylene yield, specific challenges associated with each oxidant (such as byproduct formation), and the areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.

While the provided document focuses on the use of supported molten alkali metal chlorides as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, it does not directly compare sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in the ODHP process. The document emphasizes the importance of the melting state of the alkali metal chloride phase in achieving high olefin selectivities, with the selectivity increasing with decreasing melting point of the chloride overlayer. Future research could explore how sulfur-based oxidants, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, might interact with molten alkali metal chlorides to enhance propylene yield or to mitigate byproduct formation. Additionally, studies could aim to tailor the catalyst design to optimize the use of these oxidants, considering their unique properties and reactivities.

文档重点讨论了在乙烷和丙烷氧化脱氢反应中使用熔融碱金属氯化物作为催化剂的有效性。关键方面包括不同硫基氧化剂对丙烯产率的影响，每种氧化剂的具体挑战（如副产品的形成），以及改进催化剂设计和优化整体过程的研究领域。

然而，提供的文档并未直接比较硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的效果。文档强调了氯化物过层处于熔融状态时催化剂的高选择性的重要性，随着氯化物熔点的降低，选择性会增加。未来研究可以探索硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）如何与熔融碱金属氯化物相互作用以增强丙烯产率或减少副产品的形成。此外，研究还可以旨在根据这些氧化剂的独特特性和活性来定制催化剂设计，以优化它们的应用。
