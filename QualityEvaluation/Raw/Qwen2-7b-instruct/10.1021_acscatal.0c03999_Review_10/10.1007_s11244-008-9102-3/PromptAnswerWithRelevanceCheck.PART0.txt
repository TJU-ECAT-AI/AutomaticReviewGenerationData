[1] "The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD [ Li-Na-MD [ Li-MD [ K-MD [ Na-MD."
[2] "With increasing temperature, the selectivity to olefin increases, while the formation of COx decreases in parallel."
[3] "The maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is obtained above the temperature, at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts staying nearly constant thereafter."
[4] "The melt provides a dynamic surface that minimizes un- saturation of cations and anions minimizing interaction with highly reactive products."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene can be compared with conventional oxidants in terms of propylene yield, specific challenges, and byproduct formation. The literature does not directly compare sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) with conventional oxidants for ODHP. However, it discusses the use of molten alkali metal chlorides as effective catalysts for ODHP of both ethane and propane, highlighting the role of the dynamic surface provided by the melt in minimizing interactions with reactive products.

The challenges associated with each oxidant in ODHP would depend on their specific reactivity, selectivity, and byproduct formation characteristics. For instance, sulfur-based oxidants might introduce additional sulfur compounds into the product stream, complicating purification processes. The literature suggests that the use of molten alkali metal chlorides can offer improved selectivity to olefins, such as ethene and propene, compared to solid chloride containing catalysts.

Key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process might include:
1. Investigating the comparative performance of sulfur-based oxidants versus molten alkali metal chlorides in ODHP of propane to propylene.
2. Understanding the mechanism of propene formation in the presence of sulfur-based oxidants and optimizing conditions to minimize byproducts.
3. Designing more efficient and selective catalysts that can handle sulfur-based oxidants effectively while maintaining high propylene yields.

硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯中的有效性可以与传统氧化剂进行比较，从丙烯产量、特定挑战和副产品形成的角度考虑。文献没有直接将硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2、SO2）与ODHP中的传统氧化剂进行比较。然而，它讨论了作为乙烷和丙烷ODHP的有效催化剂的熔融碱金属氯化物的作用，并强调了熔融表面在最小化与活性产物相互作用方面的作用。

与每个氧化剂相关的ODHP挑战将取决于它们的具体反应性、选择性和副产品形成特性。例如，硫基氧化剂可能引入额外的硫化合物进入产品流中，从而复杂化精炼过程。文献表明，使用熔融碱金属氯化物可以提供与固体氯化物催化剂相比更高的烯烃选择性，如乙烯和丙烯。

未来研究以提高催化剂设计和优化整个过程的关键领域可能包括：
1. 研究硫基氧化剂与熔融碱金属氯化物在丙烷ODHP中的相对性能。
2. 了解在存在硫基氧化剂时丙烯形成机制，并优化条件以减少副产品的生成。
3. 设计更高效和选择性的催化剂，能够有效地处理硫基氧化剂，同时保持高丙烯产率。

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is compared against conventional oxidants. The key aspects include the impact on propylene yield, specific challenges associated with each oxidant (such as byproduct formation), and the areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.

While the provided document focuses on the use of supported molten alkali metal chlorides as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, it does not directly compare sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in the ODHP process. The document emphasizes the importance of the melting state of the alkali metal chloride phase in achieving high olefin selectivities, with the selectivity increasing with decreasing melting point of the chloride overlayer. Future research could explore how sulfur-based oxidants, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, might interact with molten alkali metal chlorides to enhance propylene yield or to mitigate byproduct formation. Additionally, studies could aim to tailor the catalyst design to optimize the use of these oxidants, considering their unique properties and reactivities.

文档重点讨论了在乙烷和丙烷氧化脱氢反应中使用熔融碱金属氯化物作为催化剂的有效性。关键方面包括不同硫基氧化剂对丙烯产率的影响，每种氧化剂的具体挑战（如副产品的形成），以及改进催化剂设计和优化整体过程的研究领域。

然而，提供的文档并未直接比较硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的效果。文档强调了氯化物过层处于熔融状态时催化剂的高选择性的重要性，随着氯化物熔点的降低，选择性会增加。未来研究可以探索硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）如何与熔融碱金属氯化物相互作用以增强丙烯产率或减少副产品的形成。此外，研究还可以旨在根据这些氧化剂的独特特性和活性来定制催化剂设计，以优化它们的应用。

Comparing sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the literature does not provide specific data or contrasts regarding their effectiveness, impact on propylene yield, challenges associated with each oxidant, or key areas for future research. It focuses on the use of alkali metal chlorides, not sulfur-based oxidants, in the context of oxidative dehydrogenation.

[1] "The effect of temperature on the selectivity to olefins (propene and ethene) is shown in Fig. 9. Li-K-MD had a much higher selectivity to propene in comparison to Na-Li- MD and Li-MD. For Li-K-MD the selectivity to propene decreased, while with Li-Na-MD and Li-MD, it passed through a slight maximum at 798 and 848 K with increasing temperature."
[2] "The concentration of CO and CO2 on the other hand was always equal or higher than the concentration of ethene. This suggests that a significant part of the methyl groups/radicals formed in the cracking process has reacted further. In all cases, the concentrations of CO and CO2 suggest that also larger fragments have been fully oxidized."
[3] "The presence of Na and K reduces the ability to activate the CH groups at the primary carbon atom."
</quotes>

1. The study reveals that the Li-K-MD catalyst exhibited superior selectivity for propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane compared to the Li-Na-MD and Li-MD catalysts. The selectivity to propene for Li-K-MD decreased with increasing temperature, while it peaked at around 798 and 848 K for Li-Na-MD and Li-MD, respectively, with temperature increase. 

2. Observations indicated that the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) was consistently higher than the concentration of ethene across all tested catalysts. This finding suggests that a substantial portion of the methyl groups or radicals generated during the cracking process underwent further reactions. Additionally, the study suggests that larger molecules were fully oxidized in all cases.

3. The research notes that the presence of sodium (Na) and potassium (K) ions diminishes the capability to activate the carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds at the primary carbon atoms in propane.

1. 研究表明，Li-K-MD 催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中对丙烯的选择性优于Li-Na-MD和Li-MD催化剂。Li-K-MD 催化剂的丙烯选择性随温度升高而降低，而Li-Na-MD和Li-MD催化剂在温度升高时其丙烯选择性分别在约798和848 K时达到峰值。

2. 观察发现，二氧化碳（CO2）和一氧化碳（CO）的浓度始终高于乙炔（ethene）。这表明，在所有测试的催化剂中，形成的大部分甲基团或自由基都进一步反应。此外，研究指出，所有情况下较大分子都被完全氧化。

3. 研究指出，钠（Na）和钾（K）离子的存在减少了在主碳原子上激活碳-氢（CH）键的能力。

Comparing different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the effectiveness is evaluated based on propylene yield, challenges, and byproduct formation. H2S, S2, and SO2 may face specific difficulties like byproduct formation, which contrasts with conventional oxidants that might offer more predictable outcomes. Future research focuses on optimizing catalyst design and enhancing process efficiency, particularly in managing byproducts and achieving higher propylene yields through spatial isolation of active sites and minimizing interactions with reactive products.

比较不同硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯（ODHP）中的效果，主要基于丙烯产率、挑战以及副产品形成进行评估。H2S、S2和SO2可能面临特定困难，如副产品的形成，这与提供更可预测结果的传统氧化剂形成对比。未来研究集中在优化催化剂设计并提高过程效率，特别是在管理副产品和通过空间隔离活性位点以及减少与高度反应性产物的相互作用，以实现更高丙烯产率方面。
