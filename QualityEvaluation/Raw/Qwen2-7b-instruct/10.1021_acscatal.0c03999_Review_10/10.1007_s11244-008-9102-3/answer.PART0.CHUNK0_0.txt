[1] "The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD [ Li-Na-MD [ Li-MD [ K-MD [ Na-MD."
[2] "With increasing temperature, the selectivity to olefin increases, while the formation of COx decreases in parallel."
[3] "The maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is obtained above the temperature, at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts staying nearly constant thereafter."
[4] "The melt provides a dynamic surface that minimizes un- saturation of cations and anions minimizing interaction with highly reactive products."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene can be compared with conventional oxidants in terms of propylene yield, specific challenges, and byproduct formation. The literature does not directly compare sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) with conventional oxidants for ODHP. However, it discusses the use of molten alkali metal chlorides as effective catalysts for ODHP of both ethane and propane, highlighting the role of the dynamic surface provided by the melt in minimizing interactions with reactive products.

The challenges associated with each oxidant in ODHP would depend on their specific reactivity, selectivity, and byproduct formation characteristics. For instance, sulfur-based oxidants might introduce additional sulfur compounds into the product stream, complicating purification processes. The literature suggests that the use of molten alkali metal chlorides can offer improved selectivity to olefins, such as ethene and propene, compared to solid chloride containing catalysts.

Key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process might include:
1. Investigating the comparative performance of sulfur-based oxidants versus molten alkali metal chlorides in ODHP of propane to propylene.
2. Understanding the mechanism of propene formation in the presence of sulfur-based oxidants and optimizing conditions to minimize byproducts.
3. Designing more efficient and selective catalysts that can handle sulfur-based oxidants effectively while maintaining high propylene yields.

硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯中的有效性可以与传统氧化剂进行比较，从丙烯产量、特定挑战和副产品形成的角度考虑。文献没有直接将硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2、SO2）与ODHP中的传统氧化剂进行比较。然而，它讨论了作为乙烷和丙烷ODHP的有效催化剂的熔融碱金属氯化物的作用，并强调了熔融表面在最小化与活性产物相互作用方面的作用。

与每个氧化剂相关的ODHP挑战将取决于它们的具体反应性、选择性和副产品形成特性。例如，硫基氧化剂可能引入额外的硫化合物进入产品流中，从而复杂化精炼过程。文献表明，使用熔融碱金属氯化物可以提供与固体氯化物催化剂相比更高的烯烃选择性，如乙烯和丙烯。

未来研究以提高催化剂设计和优化整个过程的关键领域可能包括：
1. 研究硫基氧化剂与熔融碱金属氯化物在丙烷ODHP中的相对性能。
2. 了解在存在硫基氧化剂时丙烯形成机制，并优化条件以减少副产品的生成。
3. 设计更高效和选择性的催化剂，能够有效地处理硫基氧化剂，同时保持高丙烯产率。
