[1] "The effect of temperature on the selectivity to olefins (propene and ethene) is shown in Fig. 9. Li-K-MD had a much higher selectivity to propene in comparison to Na-Li- MD and Li-MD. For Li-K-MD the selectivity to propene decreased, while with Li-Na-MD and Li-MD, it passed through a slight maximum at 798 and 848 K with increasing temperature."
[2] "The concentration of CO and CO2 on the other hand was always equal or higher than the concentration of ethene. This suggests that a significant part of the methyl groups/radicals formed in the cracking process has reacted further. In all cases, the concentrations of CO and CO2 suggest that also larger fragments have been fully oxidized."
[3] "The presence of Na and K reduces the ability to activate the CH groups at the primary carbon atom."

1. The study reveals that the Li-K-MD catalyst exhibited superior selectivity for propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane compared to the Li-Na-MD and Li-MD catalysts. The selectivity to propene for Li-K-MD decreased with increasing temperature, while it peaked at around 798 and 848 K for Li-Na-MD and Li-MD, respectively, with temperature increase. 

2. Observations indicated that the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) was consistently higher than the concentration of ethene across all tested catalysts. This finding suggests that a substantial portion of the methyl groups or radicals generated during the cracking process underwent further reactions. Additionally, the study suggests that larger molecules were fully oxidized in all cases.

3. The research notes that the presence of sodium (Na) and potassium (K) ions diminishes the capability to activate the carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds at the primary carbon atoms in propane.

1. 研究表明，Li-K-MD 催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中对丙烯的选择性优于Li-Na-MD和Li-MD催化剂。Li-K-MD 催化剂的丙烯选择性随温度升高而降低，而Li-Na-MD和Li-MD催化剂在温度升高时其丙烯选择性分别在约798和848 K时达到峰值。

2. 观察发现，二氧化碳（CO2）和一氧化碳（CO）的浓度始终高于乙炔（ethene）。这表明，在所有测试的催化剂中，形成的大部分甲基团或自由基都进一步反应。此外，研究指出，所有情况下较大分子都被完全氧化。

3. 研究指出，钠（Na）和钾（K）离子的存在减少了在主碳原子上激活碳-氢（CH）键的能力。
