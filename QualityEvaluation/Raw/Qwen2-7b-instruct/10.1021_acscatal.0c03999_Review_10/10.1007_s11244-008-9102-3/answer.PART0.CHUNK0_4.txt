[1] "The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD [ Li-Na-MD [ Li-MD [ K-MD [ Na-MD."
[2] "With increasing temperature, the selectivity to olefin increases, while the formation of COx decreases in parallel."
[3] "This indicates less pronounced re-adsorption of alkenes under these conditions."

Comparing different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the effectiveness is evaluated based on propylene yield, challenges, and byproduct formation. H2S, S2, and SO2 may face specific difficulties like byproduct formation, which contrasts with conventional oxidants that might offer more predictable outcomes. Future research focuses on optimizing catalyst design and enhancing process efficiency, particularly in managing byproducts and achieving higher propylene yields through spatial isolation of active sites and minimizing interactions with reactive products.

比较不同硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯（ODHP）中的效果，主要基于丙烯产率、挑战以及副产品形成进行评估。H2S、S2和SO2可能面临特定困难，如副产品的形成，这与提供更可预测结果的传统氧化剂形成对比。未来研究集中在优化催化剂设计并提高过程效率，特别是在管理副产品和通过空间隔离活性位点以及减少与高度反应性产物的相互作用，以实现更高丙烯产率方面。
