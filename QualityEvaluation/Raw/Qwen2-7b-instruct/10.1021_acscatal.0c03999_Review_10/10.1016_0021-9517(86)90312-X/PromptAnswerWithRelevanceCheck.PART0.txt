[1] "Under these conditions, dehydrogenation could be carried out for extended periods at these temperatures and the catalyst oxidatively regenerated, without loss of catalytic activity and with no significant change in platinum dispersion."
[2] "With addition of 200 ppm sulfur as H2S, for example, propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene was maintained over six 24-h reaction cycles at 600C."
[3] "Sulfur addition eventually led to loss of catalyst activity, however, which was not observed in dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles in its absence."
[4] "Significantly, Pt/AI,O, run in hydrogen at 600C with 125 ppm sulfur as H2S has little effect on platinum on the other supports."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants, specifically hydrogen sulfide (H2S), in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is demonstrated to enhance propylene yield with a high selectivity. For instance, adding 200 ppm of sulfur as H2S allows for maintaining propane conversion exceeding 28 mol% with a propylene selectivity of 92-94% over six 24-hour reaction cycles at 600°C. However, sulfur addition eventually causes a loss of catalyst activity, unlike conditions without sulfur.

2. The comparison reveals that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a sulfur-based oxidant is effective in ODHP, enabling higher propylene yields and selectivities compared to conventional oxidants. It also suggests that different sulfur compounds (like H2S) might exhibit varying impacts on propylene yield, depending on their concentration and the reaction conditions.

3. Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants include potential byproduct formation, which might affect the overall process efficiency. The literature indicates that sulfur addition leads to a loss of catalyst activity, suggesting that byproducts could interfere with the reaction pathway, impacting the propylene yield and selectivity.

4. Future research in optimizing the ODHP process could focus on developing catalyst designs that mitigate the negative impacts of sulfur compounds, such as byproduct formation and catalyst deactivation. Additionally, exploring the precise mechanisms by which sulfur compounds interact with catalyst surfaces to enhance propylene yields and understanding how to control these interactions could lead to improved process efficiencies.

1. 硫化物氧化剂，特别是氢硫酸（H2S），在丙烷脱氢（ODHP）中表现出提高丙烯产量和高选择性的能力。例如，添加200 ppm的硫作为H2S，可以在600°C下维持六次24小时反应周期的丙烷转化率超过28摩尔%，丙烯选择性为92-94%。然而，添加硫最终会导致催化剂活性丧失，而这是在不存在硫的情况下未观察到的现象。

2. 比较表明，氢硫酸（H2S）作为硫化物氧化剂，在ODHP中是有效的，能够实现更高的丙烯产量和选择性，与传统氧化剂相比。这还暗示不同硫化合物（如H2S）可能对丙烯产量产生不同的影响，这取决于其浓度和反应条件。

3. 与硫化物氧化剂相关的挑战包括潜在的副产品形成，这可能会影响整个过程的效率。文献指出，硫的添加会导致催化剂活性的丧失，这表明副产品可能会干扰反应途径，影响丙烯产量和选择性。

4. 优化ODHP过程的研究方向可以集中在开发能够减轻硫化合物负面影响的催化剂设计上，比如通过控制副产品的形成和催化剂失活。此外，探索硫化合物如何与催化剂表面相互作用以增强丙烯产量的精确机制，并理解如何控制这些相互作用，可以导致过程效率的改进。

1. The addition of sulfur, specifically as H2S, significantly improved the propylene yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It allowed for high conversion rates exceeding 28 mol% with a selectivity of 92-94% over multiple reaction cycles at 600°C. However, the use of sulfur eventually led to a loss of catalyst activity, a phenomenon not observed when sulfur was not included in the reaction. 

2. Sulfur, when added at concentrations ranging from 25 to 500 ppm, notably enhanced the selectivity towards olefin formation and suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation, particularly over platinum supported on magnesium aluminate. This resulted in a high and sustained conversion rate throughout the reaction period.

3. The introduction of sulfur enabled the maintenance of a high level of conversion, ensuring a stable performance of the catalyst across the duration of the reaction.

4. Notably, the addition of sulfur in the form of H2S had minimal impact on the activity of platinum supported on alumina, contrasting with its effect on the magnesium aluminate-supported platinum catalyst.

5. The sulfur-containing gases, including H2S, S2, and SO2, were thermodynamically favorable under the experimental conditions. These gases were observed to undergo reactions on the surface of the catalyst, contributing to the observed improvements in propylene yield.

6. The sulfur retained by the platinum surface could potentially disrupt the bonding between the platinum and the support material, especially if it is situated near the platinum crystallites, leading to catalytic degradation over time.

7. The proposed mechanism involves the formation of surface sulfate species, which, upon hydrogen treatment, could reduce and thereby potentially poison the surface of the platinum, affecting its catalytic efficiency.

1. 添加硫，尤其是以H2S的形式，显著提高了丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的产率。它允许在600°C下进行多次反应周期时，转化率超过28摩尔%，选择性达到92-94%。然而，使用硫最终导致催化剂活性的丧失，这一现象在硫未加入反应中时并未观察到。

2. 在25至500 ppm的范围内添加硫（作为H#或噻吩），显著提高了烯烃的选择性，并抑制了氢解和焦炭形成，特别是在镁铝酸盐支持的铂催化剂上。这导致了在整个反应期间高且稳定的转化率。

[1] "In the case of Pt/MgAl,O3, as little as 25 ppm sulfur increased propylene selectivity from 47 to 84%."
[2] "In the presence of sulfur, no change in activity was observed after the catalyst had been subjected to five regenerations at 500C in flowing air."
[3] "In order to determine which part of the overall reaction-regeneration sequence was responsible for platinum sintering, a series of PtMgAl,O3 catalysts was run in a variety of environments and examined by electron microscopy."
[4] "Significantly, Pt/AI,O, run in hydrogen at 600C with 125 ppm sulfur as H2S has little effect on platinum on the other supports."
[5] "When the same catalyst was treated with a HIS/H2 mixture followed by air, a similar weight gain was observed, showing that oxidation of adsorbed H2S will lead to sulfate formation on the spine1 support."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene varies significantly. H2S has been shown to enhance propylene yield and selectivity, increasing propylene selectivity from 47 to 84% when added to the feed at 25 ppm. However, the addition of sulfur leads to eventual catalyst activity loss due to platinum sintering. 

The challenges associated with each oxidant include byproduct formation, particularly methane and coke formation in the absence of sulfur. Sulfur addition can suppress hydrogenolysis and coke formation, improving selectivity to propylene. Yet, this improvement is not permanent, and sulfur's presence can eventually cause catalyst deactivation through platinum sintering.

Future research areas focus on optimizing catalyst design to retain sulfur without causing sintering. Studies have shown that sulfur can form surface sulfate species on the catalyst support, which can disrupt the bonding between platinum and the support. Understanding how to manage these surface reactions to prevent sintering and retain sulfur's benefits is crucial. Researchers aim to develop catalysts that can effectively utilize sulfur additives while maintaining high propylene yield and selectivity over multiple regeneration cycles.

In summary, sulfur-based oxidants can significantly improve propylene yield in ODHP, but they pose challenges related to catalyst deactivation through platinum sintering. Future research aims to develop strategies to mitigate these issues, potentially through improved catalyst design and enhanced understanding of the sulfur-catalyst interactions.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯的过程中，不同硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）的有效性存在显著差异。H2S的添加可以提高丙烯选择性，当在进料中加入25 ppm的硫时，丙烯选择性从47增加到84%。然而，硫的添加会导致催化剂活性最终丧失，这是由于铂颗粒聚集造成的。

与每种氧化剂相关的挑战包括副产物形成，特别是没有硫的情况下，会产生甲烷和焦炭。硫的添加可以抑制氢化和焦炭形成，从而提高丙烯选择性。然而，这种改善不是永久性的，并且硫的存在最终会导致催化剂失活，通过铂颗粒聚集。

未来的研究领域集中在优化催化剂设计以保留硫而不引起聚集。研究表明，硫可以在催化剂支持上形成表面硫酸盐物种，这可能破坏铂和支撑之间的结合。理解如何管理这些表面反应以防止聚集并保持硫的益处是至关重要的。研究人员旨在开发既能有效利用硫添加剂又能保持高丙烯产率和选择性的催化剂。

简而言之，硫基氧化剂可以在ODHP过程中显著提高丙烯产率，但它们面临着通过铂颗粒聚集导致催化剂失活的挑战。未来研究的目标是通过改进催化剂设计和增强对硫-催化剂相互作用的理解来解决这些问题。

[2] "In propane dehydrogenation,temperatures of 600C or higher must be employed in order to obtain reasonable yields of propylene."
[3] "The addition of sulfur in concentrations as low as 25 ppm changed the nature of the reaction. The exothermic hydrogenolysis reaction was suppressed and the overall reaction became endothermic."
[4] "Yields of propylene increased dramatically and olefin selectivities of 90 mol% were obtained."
[5] "Sulfur also decreased coke formation, as before, and reaction could be carried out for up to 10 days before regeneration became necessary."
[6] "This result demonstrates the formation and reduction of surface sulfate species in Pt/A1203 exposed to hydrogen sulfide, and the retention of sulfur by platinum, when the catalyst is reduced."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The literature highlights that the addition of sulfur, specifically in the form of H2S, can significantly enhance the ODHP process by maintaining high propane conversion rates and propylene selectivity over multiple reaction cycles at 600°C. This is due to the suppression of hydrogenolysis and coke formation, leading to improved propylene yields and selectivity.

2. For the ODHP of propane to achieve reasonable yields of propylene, temperatures of 600°C or higher are essential. This emphasizes the importance of high-temperature conditions in the process.

3. The introduction of sulfur into the reaction medium transforms the hydrogenolysis reaction, which is usually exothermic, into an endothermic process. This shift in reaction thermodynamics facilitates the production of propylene by inhibiting the hydrogenolysis reaction, which typically consumes hydrogen and produces methane and coke.

4. The use of sulfur results in a substantial increase in propylene yields and olefin selectivities reaching up to 90 mol%. This indicates a significant improvement in the efficiency of the ODHP process, especially when sulfur is present in the feedstock.

5. One of the key benefits of using sulfur in the ODHP is its ability to reduce coke formation. This allows for longer reaction periods without the need for frequent regeneration, thereby improving operational efficiency and reducing maintenance costs.

6. The literature also discusses the retention of sulfur by platinum during the reduction process. This retention might play a role in disrupting the bonding between platinum and the support material, potentially affecting the catalyst's performance and longevity. Future research could explore strategies to mitigate this issue while maintaining the benefits of sulfur addition.

2. 对于丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的过程，为了获得合理的丙烯产率，必须使用600°C或更高的温度。这强调了高温条件在该过程中至关重要。

3. 硫的引入将通常为放热的氢解离反应转变为吸热反应。这一反应动力学的转变促进了丙烯的生产，通过抑制氢解离反应，后者通常消耗氢气并产生甲烷和焦炭。

4. 使用硫的结果是丙烯产率大幅增加，烯烃选择性达到90摩尔%，这意味着ODHP过程的效率得到了显著提高，尤其是当硫存在于原料中时。

5. 使用硫的一个关键益处是其能减少焦炭形成。这使得在不需要频繁再生的情况下进行更长时间的反应成为可能，从而提高了操作效率并降低了维护成本。

6. 文献还讨论了铂在还原过程中的硫保留。这种保留可能会破坏铂与支撑材料之间的结合，可能会影响催化剂的性能和使用寿命。未来的研究可以探索在保持硫添加优势的同时，减轻这一问题的策略。
