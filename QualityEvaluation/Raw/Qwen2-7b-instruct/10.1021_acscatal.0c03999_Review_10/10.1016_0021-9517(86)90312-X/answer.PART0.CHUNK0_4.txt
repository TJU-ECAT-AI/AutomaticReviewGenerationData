1. The addition of 200 ppm sulfur as H2S maintained propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with a selectivity of 92-94% over six 24-hour reaction cycles at 600°C. However, sulfur addition eventually led to a loss of catalyst activity that was not observed when sulfur was absent. 

2. After the seventh regeneration, the catalyst activity decreased, and it continued to decline after each subsequent regeneration.

3. Adding 125 ppm sulfur as H2S to Pt/AI,O, did not affect the platinum on other supports significantly.

4. The strong pattern of platinum metal on the reduced catalyst after the experiment indicated extensive platinum sintering.

5. There was no direct evidence of sulfur retention in the reduced PtMgAl,O, prior to coke burn-off.

6. The sulfur content of samples reduced at 600°C before coke oxidation was below the detection limit of combustion methods.

1. 当添加200 ppm的硫化氢时，丙烷转化率超过28摩尔%，丙烯选择性达到92-94%，在600°C下维持了六个24小时的反应周期。然而，当添加硫时，催化剂活性最终会降低，而没有硫时不会观察到这种情况。

2. 在第七次再生后，催化剂活性下降，并且在每次后续再生后继续下降。

3. 将125 ppm的硫化氢添加到Pt/AI,O,中，并未对其他支持上的铂产生显著影响。

4. 减少后的催化剂显示出强烈的铂金属模式，表明存在广泛的铂晶粒合并。

5. 在600°C之前进行焦炭氧化之前，样品中的硫含量低于燃烧方法的检测极限。

6. 在600°C之前减少样品之前，焦炭氧化前的催化剂中的硫含量低于燃烧方法的检测极限。
