[1] "Under these conditions, dehydrogenation could be carried out for extended periods at these temperatures and the catalyst oxidatively regenerated, without loss of catalytic activity and with no significant change in platinum dispersion."
[2] "With addition of 200 ppm sulfur as H2S, for example, propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene was maintained over six 24-h reaction cycles at 600C."
[3] "Sulfur addition eventually led to loss of catalyst activity, however, which was not observed in dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles in its absence."
[4] "Significantly, Pt/AI,O, run in hydrogen at 600C with 125 ppm sulfur as H2S has little effect on platinum on the other supports."

1. The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants, specifically hydrogen sulfide (H2S), in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is demonstrated to enhance propylene yield with a high selectivity. For instance, adding 200 ppm of sulfur as H2S allows for maintaining propane conversion exceeding 28 mol% with a propylene selectivity of 92-94% over six 24-hour reaction cycles at 600°C. However, sulfur addition eventually causes a loss of catalyst activity, unlike conditions without sulfur.

2. The comparison reveals that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a sulfur-based oxidant is effective in ODHP, enabling higher propylene yields and selectivities compared to conventional oxidants. It also suggests that different sulfur compounds (like H2S) might exhibit varying impacts on propylene yield, depending on their concentration and the reaction conditions.

3. Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants include potential byproduct formation, which might affect the overall process efficiency. The literature indicates that sulfur addition leads to a loss of catalyst activity, suggesting that byproducts could interfere with the reaction pathway, impacting the propylene yield and selectivity.

4. Future research in optimizing the ODHP process could focus on developing catalyst designs that mitigate the negative impacts of sulfur compounds, such as byproduct formation and catalyst deactivation. Additionally, exploring the precise mechanisms by which sulfur compounds interact with catalyst surfaces to enhance propylene yields and understanding how to control these interactions could lead to improved process efficiencies.

1. 硫化物氧化剂，特别是氢硫酸（H2S），在丙烷脱氢（ODHP）中表现出提高丙烯产量和高选择性的能力。例如，添加200 ppm的硫作为H2S，可以在600°C下维持六次24小时反应周期的丙烷转化率超过28摩尔%，丙烯选择性为92-94%。然而，添加硫最终会导致催化剂活性丧失，而这是在不存在硫的情况下未观察到的现象。

2. 比较表明，氢硫酸（H2S）作为硫化物氧化剂，在ODHP中是有效的，能够实现更高的丙烯产量和选择性，与传统氧化剂相比。这还暗示不同硫化合物（如H2S）可能对丙烯产量产生不同的影响，这取决于其浓度和反应条件。

3. 与硫化物氧化剂相关的挑战包括潜在的副产品形成，这可能会影响整个过程的效率。文献指出，硫的添加会导致催化剂活性的丧失，这表明副产品可能会干扰反应途径，影响丙烯产量和选择性。

4. 优化ODHP过程的研究方向可以集中在开发能够减轻硫化合物负面影响的催化剂设计上，比如通过控制副产品的形成和催化剂失活。此外，探索硫化合物如何与催化剂表面相互作用以增强丙烯产量的精确机制，并理解如何控制这些相互作用，可以导致过程效率的改进。
