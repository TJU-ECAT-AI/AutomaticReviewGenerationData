[1] "With addition of 200 ppm sulfur as H2S, for example, propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene was maintained over six 24-h reaction cycles at 600C."
[2] "In propane dehydrogenation,temperatures of 600C or higher must be employed in order to obtain reasonable yields of propylene."
[3] "The addition of sulfur in concentrations as low as 25 ppm changed the nature of the reaction. The exothermic hydrogenolysis reaction was suppressed and the overall reaction became endothermic."
[4] "Yields of propylene increased dramatically and olefin selectivities of 90 mol% were obtained."
[5] "Sulfur also decreased coke formation, as before, and reaction could be carried out for up to 10 days before regeneration became necessary."
[6] "This result demonstrates the formation and reduction of surface sulfate species in Pt/A1203 exposed to hydrogen sulfide, and the retention of sulfur by platinum, when the catalyst is reduced."

1. The literature highlights that the addition of sulfur, specifically in the form of H2S, can significantly enhance the ODHP process by maintaining high propane conversion rates and propylene selectivity over multiple reaction cycles at 600°C. This is due to the suppression of hydrogenolysis and coke formation, leading to improved propylene yields and selectivity.

2. For the ODHP of propane to achieve reasonable yields of propylene, temperatures of 600°C or higher are essential. This emphasizes the importance of high-temperature conditions in the process.

3. The introduction of sulfur into the reaction medium transforms the hydrogenolysis reaction, which is usually exothermic, into an endothermic process. This shift in reaction thermodynamics facilitates the production of propylene by inhibiting the hydrogenolysis reaction, which typically consumes hydrogen and produces methane and coke.

4. The use of sulfur results in a substantial increase in propylene yields and olefin selectivities reaching up to 90 mol%. This indicates a significant improvement in the efficiency of the ODHP process, especially when sulfur is present in the feedstock.

5. One of the key benefits of using sulfur in the ODHP is its ability to reduce coke formation. This allows for longer reaction periods without the need for frequent regeneration, thereby improving operational efficiency and reducing maintenance costs.

6. The literature also discusses the retention of sulfur by platinum during the reduction process. This retention might play a role in disrupting the bonding between platinum and the support material, potentially affecting the catalyst's performance and longevity. Future research could explore strategies to mitigate this issue while maintaining the benefits of sulfur addition.

1. 文献表明，通过在H2S形式下添加硫，可以显著增强丙烷脱氢生成丙烯（ODHP）过程，维持多次反应周期内超过28摩尔%的丙烷转化率和高达92%-94%的丙烯选择性，这得益于氢解离和焦炭形成被抑制，从而提高了丙烯产量和选择性。

2. 对于丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的过程，为了获得合理的丙烯产率，必须使用600°C或更高的温度。这强调了高温条件在该过程中至关重要。

3. 硫的引入将通常为放热的氢解离反应转变为吸热反应。这一反应动力学的转变促进了丙烯的生产，通过抑制氢解离反应，后者通常消耗氢气并产生甲烷和焦炭。

4. 使用硫的结果是丙烯产率大幅增加，烯烃选择性达到90摩尔%，这意味着ODHP过程的效率得到了显著提高，尤其是当硫存在于原料中时。

5. 使用硫的一个关键益处是其能减少焦炭形成。这使得在不需要频繁再生的情况下进行更长时间的反应成为可能，从而提高了操作效率并降低了维护成本。

6. 文献还讨论了铂在还原过程中的硫保留。这种保留可能会破坏铂与支撑材料之间的结合，可能会影响催化剂的性能和使用寿命。未来的研究可以探索在保持硫添加优势的同时，减轻这一问题的策略。
