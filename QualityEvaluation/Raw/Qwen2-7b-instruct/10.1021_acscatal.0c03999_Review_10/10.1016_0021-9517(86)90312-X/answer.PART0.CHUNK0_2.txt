[1] "In the case of Pt/MgAl,O3, as little as 25 ppm sulfur increased propylene selectivity from 47 to 84%."
[2] "In the presence of sulfur, no change in activity was observed after the catalyst had been subjected to five regenerations at 500C in flowing air."
[3] "In order to determine which part of the overall reaction-regeneration sequence was responsible for platinum sintering, a series of PtMgAl,O3 catalysts was run in a variety of environments and examined by electron microscopy."
[4] "Significantly, Pt/AI,O, run in hydrogen at 600C with 125 ppm sulfur as H2S has little effect on platinum on the other supports."
[5] "When the same catalyst was treated with a HIS/H2 mixture followed by air, a similar weight gain was observed, showing that oxidation of adsorbed H2S will lead to sulfate formation on the spine1 support."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene varies significantly. H2S has been shown to enhance propylene yield and selectivity, increasing propylene selectivity from 47 to 84% when added to the feed at 25 ppm. However, the addition of sulfur leads to eventual catalyst activity loss due to platinum sintering. 

The challenges associated with each oxidant include byproduct formation, particularly methane and coke formation in the absence of sulfur. Sulfur addition can suppress hydrogenolysis and coke formation, improving selectivity to propylene. Yet, this improvement is not permanent, and sulfur's presence can eventually cause catalyst deactivation through platinum sintering.

Future research areas focus on optimizing catalyst design to retain sulfur without causing sintering. Studies have shown that sulfur can form surface sulfate species on the catalyst support, which can disrupt the bonding between platinum and the support. Understanding how to manage these surface reactions to prevent sintering and retain sulfur's benefits is crucial. Researchers aim to develop catalysts that can effectively utilize sulfur additives while maintaining high propylene yield and selectivity over multiple regeneration cycles.

In summary, sulfur-based oxidants can significantly improve propylene yield in ODHP, but they pose challenges related to catalyst deactivation through platinum sintering. Future research aims to develop strategies to mitigate these issues, potentially through improved catalyst design and enhanced understanding of the sulfur-catalyst interactions.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯的过程中，不同硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）的有效性存在显著差异。H2S的添加可以提高丙烯选择性，当在进料中加入25 ppm的硫时，丙烯选择性从47增加到84%。然而，硫的添加会导致催化剂活性最终丧失，这是由于铂颗粒聚集造成的。

与每种氧化剂相关的挑战包括副产物形成，特别是没有硫的情况下，会产生甲烷和焦炭。硫的添加可以抑制氢化和焦炭形成，从而提高丙烯选择性。然而，这种改善不是永久性的，并且硫的存在最终会导致催化剂失活，通过铂颗粒聚集。

未来的研究领域集中在优化催化剂设计以保留硫而不引起聚集。研究表明，硫可以在催化剂支持上形成表面硫酸盐物种，这可能破坏铂和支撑之间的结合。理解如何管理这些表面反应以防止聚集并保持硫的益处是至关重要的。研究人员旨在开发既能有效利用硫添加剂又能保持高丙烯产率和选择性的催化剂。

简而言之，硫基氧化剂可以在ODHP过程中显著提高丙烯产率，但它们面临着通过铂颗粒聚集导致催化剂失活的挑战。未来研究的目标是通过改进催化剂设计和增强对硫-催化剂相互作用的理解来解决这些问题。
