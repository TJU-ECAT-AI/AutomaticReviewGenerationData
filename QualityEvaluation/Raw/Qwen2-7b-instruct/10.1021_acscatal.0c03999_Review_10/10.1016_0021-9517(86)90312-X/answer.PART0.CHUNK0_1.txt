[1] "With addition of 200 ppm sulfur as H2S, for example, propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene was maintained over six 24-h reaction cycles at 600C."

1. The addition of sulfur, specifically as H2S, significantly improved the propylene yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It allowed for high conversion rates exceeding 28 mol% with a selectivity of 92-94% over multiple reaction cycles at 600°C. However, the use of sulfur eventually led to a loss of catalyst activity, a phenomenon not observed when sulfur was not included in the reaction. 

2. Sulfur, when added at concentrations ranging from 25 to 500 ppm, notably enhanced the selectivity towards olefin formation and suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation, particularly over platinum supported on magnesium aluminate. This resulted in a high and sustained conversion rate throughout the reaction period.

3. The introduction of sulfur enabled the maintenance of a high level of conversion, ensuring a stable performance of the catalyst across the duration of the reaction.

4. Notably, the addition of sulfur in the form of H2S had minimal impact on the activity of platinum supported on alumina, contrasting with its effect on the magnesium aluminate-supported platinum catalyst.

5. The sulfur-containing gases, including H2S, S2, and SO2, were thermodynamically favorable under the experimental conditions. These gases were observed to undergo reactions on the surface of the catalyst, contributing to the observed improvements in propylene yield.

6. The sulfur retained by the platinum surface could potentially disrupt the bonding between the platinum and the support material, especially if it is situated near the platinum crystallites, leading to catalytic degradation over time.

7. The proposed mechanism involves the formation of surface sulfate species, which, upon hydrogen treatment, could reduce and thereby potentially poison the surface of the platinum, affecting its catalytic efficiency.

1. 添加硫，尤其是以H2S的形式，显著提高了丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的产率。它允许在600°C下进行多次反应周期时，转化率超过28摩尔%，选择性达到92-94%。然而，使用硫最终导致催化剂活性的丧失，这一现象在硫未加入反应中时并未观察到。

2. 在25至500 ppm的范围内添加硫（作为H#或噻吩），显著提高了烯烃的选择性，并抑制了氢解和焦炭形成，特别是在镁铝酸盐支持的铂催化剂上。这导致了在整个反应期间高且稳定的转化率。

3. 引入硫使转化率保持在一个高水平，确保了催化剂在整个反应过程中的稳定性能。

4. 显著地，以H2S形式添加的硫对支持在氧化铝上的铂催化剂的影响较小，与对镁铝酸盐支持的铂催化剂的影响形成对比。

5. 硫化物气体，包括H2S、S2和SO2，在实验条件下是热力学上有利的。这些气体被观察到在催化剂表面发生反应，从而促进了所观察到的丙烯产率提高。

6. 催化剂表面保留的硫可能破坏铂和支撑材料之间的结合，尤其是在铂晶粒附近，导致催化剂性能随时间逐渐下降。

7. 提议的机制涉及表面硫酸盐物种的形成，这些物种在氢处理后可以减少并潜在地毒害铂表面，影响其催化效率。
