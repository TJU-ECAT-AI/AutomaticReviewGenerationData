The catalytic oxidation of a range of compounds, using sulfur dioxide as the oxidant, 
over a variety of catalysts has been examined. Metal sulfides and metal phosphates were 
the best of the catalysts examined. The oxidative dehydrogenation of olefins to diolefins 
proceeds very well, giving much higher yields from the higher olefins than for the cor- 
responding oxidation with oxygen. Interesting 
reactions of paraffins are isobutane to 
isobutylene, butane and isopentane to the corresponding thiopheaes, hexane to benzene, 
and 3-methylpentane 
to vinylthiophene. 
When cyclization to thiophenes or aromatics is 
possible, large yields of olefins or dienes cannot be obtained from paraffins. Mesityl oxide 
is cyclized to 2,4-dimethylfuran 
quite well but no furan is made from crotonaldehyde. 
The catalytic 
oxidation 
of hydrocarbons 
is quite successful with a number of mate- 
rials, such as ethylene, propylene, butylene, 
benzene, and alkyl aromatics, but there are 
a number of systems, which include desired 
products as well as desired feeds, where the 
selectivity 
of the reaction is either low or 
practically 
nonexistent 
(1). As an example, 
consider the oxidation 
over bismuth molyb- 
date 
of 2-butene 
and 2-methyl-2-butene 
(9). Production 
of butadiene from butylene 
is a very clean reaction, while the selectiv- 
ity 
of oxidation 
of isoamylene 
to isoprene 
is low, especially at high conversion levels.

The 
reduced 
selectivity 
for 
this 
second 
reaction is chiefly due to the rapid complete 
oxidation 
of the isoprene formed. We have 
screened 60 catalysts 
for the oxygen oxi- 
dation 
of isoamylene. 
A large number 
of 
these were quite similar in their performance, 
among which bismuth 
molybdate 
was typ- 
ical. This is just anot,her example indicating 
that 
catalyst 
variation, 
at least for some 
selected 
reactions, 
has been moderately 
well explored. 
However, 
of the three 
components 
of 
catalytic 
oxidation 
(reductant, 
catalyst, 
and oxidant), 
variations 
of the oxidant 
have 
been examined 
but 
little, 
mainly 
because air or oxygen is cheap and readily 
available 
and other oxidants 
often lead to 
undesirable 
by-products 
or handling 
dif- 
ficulties. 
Nevertheless, 
substantial 
gains in 
process efficiency may easily warrant 
con- 
sideration of more unconventional 
oxidants. 
Of these oxidants, sulfur dioxide is perhaps 
the most common and easiest handled. The 
patent 
literature 
discloses a number 
of 
cases where it is used for oxidative dehydro- 
genation. 
Rosen (3) used chromia-alumina 
catalyst and SO2 to make isobutylene 
from 
isobutane while Stone and Korpi 
(4) used 
a supported 
copper catalyst 
and SOZ to 
form butadiene 
from butene. Danforth 
(5) 
dehydrogenated 
naphthenes with activated 
carbon and SOz. Murray 
(8) claims a de- 
hydrogenat,ion 
process in which 
feed and 
SO2 
are passed over an oxide of molybdenum, 
cobalt, 
or tungsten 
until 
the catalyst 
is 
sulfided, 
then 
the catalyst 
is reoxidized 
back to the oxide. Stringer 
et al. (7) have

I. 
97 
claimed high yields of benzene from hexane 
using SOZ and a calcium-nickel 
phosphate 
catalyst. 
Another 
advantage 
of using 
SOZ for 
osidative 
dehydrogenation 
is that 
the re- 
action is actually endothermic. The following 
thermodynamic 
data have been calculated 
(8) for Z-methyl-2-butene: 
C’5Hlo + ;SO, + CbHs + +H,S + $H,O; 
AH07000~ 
= 13 kcal 
(1) 
As will 
be seen later, the only major by- 
product 
is 3-methyhhiophene, 
formation 
of which is highly 
endot,hermic 
(‘SH,,, + SOz + CjH,& + 2H20; 
AH07000~

(2) 
The 
slightly 
endothermic 
nature 
of the 
oxidative 
dehydrogenation 
of isoamylene 
with 
SO* allows 
considerable 
freedom in 
reactor 
design. 
Large 
adiabatic 
reactors 
would 
be feasible. 
iYo explosive 
hazards 
are involved 
so that 
no rest r&ions 
are 
imposed on feed composition.

of reaction

pressure. Normally 
liquid feeds were fed by 
bubbling helium through the liquid thermo- 
stated for the desired vapor pressure. The 
vapor effluent from t,he reactor, at 2OO”C, 
was monitored 
with 
a mass spectrometer. 
Ident’ification 
of compounds 
and analyses 
were done mainly by mass spectrometry and 
sometimes 
by gas liquid 
chromatography 
(GLC). 
Confirmation 
of identification 
was 
most often done by comparison with authen- 
tic samples. When these were not available, 
the compounds were isolated by GLC, mass 
spectra were obtained and any other meas- 
urements 
(NMR, 
IR, 
etc.) necessary for 
identification 
were made. 
In the tables of data, GHSV refers to the 
total feed gas hourly 
space velocity 
(vol- 
umes of feed per volume 
of catalyst 
per 
hour), including 
oxidant and diluents; 
it is 
calculat,ed at 0°C and 760 mm Hg. Conver- 
sion is percentage of a feed species converted 
to other materials. 
Selectivity 
is the per- 
centage of carbon atoms in a given product 
relat’ive t,o carbon atoms in all products. In 
some of the tables of t,his paper, not all of 
the minor product,s are listed. This accounts

We have found that reaction (1) proceeds 
with good selectivity 
at high conversion, in 
marked 
contrast 
to the 
oxidation 
with 
oxygen. We have investigated 
a number of 
catalytic 
reaction 
systems 
using 
sulfur 
dioxide 
as oxidizing 
agent’. This 
report 
summarizes 
the work 
on olefins and par- 
affins, together with some oxygen-containing 
compounds. 
Most 
of the systems studied 
have involved individual 
reactions but a suf- 
ficient 
number 
have been investigated 
to 
give a fairly 
general treatment. 
Individual 
reactions 
will 
be treated 
separately 
in 
detail 
and general statements 
will 
be left 
for the discussion at the end. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Apparatus 
and techniques 
were similar 
to those used earlier (9). The glass reactor 
in the continuous 
flow system contained a 
small amount of catalyst 
(usually 
2-10 cc, 
lo-20 
mesh) and operated at, atmospheric 
for the sum of the select,ivities listed not 
always being 100%. 
Cat,alyst 
activity 
was usually 
not con- 
stant, decreasing substant,ially 
in a period 
of hours, due to coke formation. 
Complete 
regeneration 
occurred 
easily with 
oxygen 
but not with sulfur dioxide. 
Sulfur balance errors in these runs were 
erratic 
and both 
positive 
and negative. 
Large 
errors 
appeared 
after 
changes of 
conditions, 
apparently 
due 
to 
dynamic 
exchanges of oxygen and sulfur 
with 
the 
solid. These errors usually 
decreased with 
time, indicating 
approach to a steady state 
condition. 
That t’he overall reactions occur 
according to Eqs. (1) and (2) are shown by 
the following 
data obt’ained on a sulfided 
bismuth molybdate, 
after running 
for some 
period of time. Under conditions 
in which 
84y0 of the isoamylene and 54y0 of the SO2 
were converted, 
for every 
100 moles of 
hydrocarbon 
reacted 66 moles of isoprene 
98 
C. R. 
ADAMS 
were produced along with 28 moles of meth- 
ylthiophene, 
while 24 moles of H& and 128 
moles of Hz0 were made. Equations 
(1) and 
(2) indicate 22 moles of H2S and 100 moles 
of Hz0 would be formed from the production 
of the isoprene and methylthiophene. 
The 
6 moles of isoamylene 
converted 
to minor 
by-products 
lvould account for some of the 
additional 
H2S and Hz0 obsemed. 
RESULTS 
Isoamylene 
Since bismuth 
molybdate 
has been most 
extensively 
explored for oxidative 
dehydro- 
genation 
with 
oxygen, 
this 
catalyst 
was 
examined in some detail for oxidation 
wibh 
SOz. When bismut’h molybdate 
is used in 
the oxide form with SOZ, its initial 
behavior 
is tery 
similar 
to that 
with 
oxygen. The 
selectivity 
is low (essentially 
identical 
to 
that obtained with oxygen), other oxygen- 
ated 
products 
(C$HsO and 
CsH60) 
are 
formed, 
and large amounts 
of COZ are 
formed. 
In 
experiments 
with 
2-methyl-2- 
butene and SOz (C&/SO2 = 0.8, GHSV = 
600, 55O”C), the activity 
of the catalyst 
went 
down 
markedly 
with 
time 
(hydro- 
carbon conversion 
dropped 
from 86% to 
27%, in the first hour). This was probably 
due to sulfiding 
of the catalyst, 
since prac- 
tically 
no H2S came off the catalyst at first. 
A 
rough 
calculation 
based on retained 
sulfur 
indicated 
that 
about 
5% 
of the 
oxygen in the catalyst 
had been replaced 
by sulfur after 1 hr under the above condi- 
tions. Since these data indicated 
that the 
steady state condition 
of the catalyst is the 
sulfide form, a portion was pretreated with 
H&3 for 2 hr at 500°C. Gain in weight indi- 
cated that about one-half of the bulk oxygen 
had been replaced with sulfur. Retreating 
of 
this catalyst with 2-methyl-2-butene 
showed 
that selectivity 
is markedly 
improved 
over 
that of the oxide form; isoprene plus meth- 
ylthiophene 
are about 90%. Practically 
no 
oxygenated 
compounds 
were formed, 
not 
even COz. The activity, 
although 
low, 
W&S 
fairly steady, compared to the rapid decline 
for the oxide form (conversion dropped from 
26% to 23y0 in 45 min). 
More extensive data for another sulfided 
bismuth 
molybdate 
are shown in Fig. 1. 
These data were obtained under a variety of 
conditions 
but they form a consistent pat- 
bern. This catalyst 
contained more molyb- 
denum 
(Bi, 
2Mo) 
than 
the 
one above 
(Bi, MO). The line without 
points represents 
oxidation 
with oxygen over bismuth molyb- 
date at 460°C. Use of sulfur dioxide instead 
of oxygen results in much better selectivity 
to isoprene. Selectivity 
is bett,er than 80% 
at 40y0 conversion 
and is 65% at 85% 
conversion. 
Methylthiophene 
is the only 
major by-product. 
It is undoubtedly 
pro- 
duced as a subsequent reaction of the iso- 
prene formed since methylthiophene 
selec- 
tivity 
increases markedly 
with 
increasing 
conversion. 
The selectivity 
of a given con- 
version did not appear to vary in the tem- 
perature range 500-600°C. A small amount 
of oxygen was added to the feed in the hope 
of increasing 
the activity 
or reducing 
the 
met’hylthiophene 
selectivity 
with the results 
in the following 
table.

Methylthiophene 
was reduced somewhat, 
but isoprene selectivity 
was also reduced 
due to increase in CO2 and CO. There was 
no increase in activity 
even after 5 hr oper- 
ation. In other tests with 
other catalysts, 
large amounts 
of oxygen 
only 
produced 
larger amounts of Cog, with 
no beneficial 
effects. 
The 
bismuth 
molybdate 
catalysts 
dis- 
cussed above have low surface areas, a few 
square meters per gram, and their activity 
in the sulfided form is low. A catalyst which 
should have had a larger active surface was 
examined in an att’empt to obtain increased 
activity. 
This catalyst 
was made by 
pre- 
treating 
with 
hydrogen 
sulfide a bismuth 
phosphomolybdate 
(12Bi,

12Mo) 
on 
silica catalyst 
which 
had a surface area,

catalyst was no more active than the unsup- 
ported catalysts. 
Figure 2 shows how the 
activity 
of this catalyst 
changes with time. 
There is a slow steady decline in activity, 
due to coke buildup 
on the catalyst. 
At- 
tempts to regenerate the catalyst with SO2 
were unsuccessful. The coke can be burned 
off with oxygen, care being taken to prevent 
overoxidation 
of the sulfide to the oxide, and 
the activity 
restored to normal, as shown in 
Fig. 2. (The lower conversion for the regener- 
ated catalyst’ in Fig. 2 is due t’o the in- 
creased space velocit,y.) 
Att’empts 
at re- 
ducing the coke buildup 
by adding oxygen 
t,o the feed have not been successful, as 
shown in Fig. 2. The amount, of oxygen 
added in Fig. 2 was sufficient 
to lower the 
isoprene selectivity 
by about 2% without 
affecting 
t’he decline in act’ivity. 
Increased 
amounts of oxygen merely result,ed in further 
burnup. 
These results are typical 
of the 
various 
catalysts 
examined 
in this work. 
Although 
not, all 
of t,he catalysts 
have 
shown the simple decline curves of Fig. 2, 
activities 
have sometimes been erratic and 
hard to reproduce. 
In 
our screening work 
here we have been more concerned with 
selectivity 
at a given conversion and have 
not investigated 
activity 
stability 
for all 
t,he cata1yst.s examined. 
Bismuth 
phosphotungstat,e 
differs 
from 
bismuth molybdate in one respect: its sele::- 
tivit,y behavior in the oxide form. Figure 1 
shows a conversion 
selectivit,y 
plot for a 
high phosphorus bismuth phosphot’ungst’ate 
(30Bi, 13P, 12W) used in the oxide form lvith 
SO,. Selectivity 
is t’he same as for presulfided 
bismuth 
molybdate. 
The phosphotungst#atc 
makes only a small amount (l-87,) 
of COr 
compared 
to the molybdat,e. 
This 
would 
indicate 
low bulk oxygen mobility 
for t’he 
phosphotungstate. 
When large amounts of 
oxygen are added to the feed for t’he phos- 
photungstate, 
CO2 increases markedly 
(177, 
selectivity 
t,o CO2 when 
O&O* 
= 0.3).

photungstate 
was somewhat erratic, followed 
by a steady decline. To separate the effects 
of sulfiding and coking, a bismuth tungstate 
was presulfided 
by calcining 
in H2S and 
examined for oxidation 
with SOz. Activity 
declined 
steadily 
with 
the catalyst, 
some- 
what faster than that for sulfided bismuth 
molybdate 
in Fig. 2. The behavior 
of bis- 
muth tungstate 
is very similar to bismuth 
molybdate 
in selectivity 
when 
both 
are 
sulfided. The tungstate 
is more selective in 
the oxide form and declines faster in activity 
when in the sulfide form. 
When bismuth 
molybdate 
or tungstate 
is sulfided 
there is no assurance that the 
resulting 
solid is not a mixture 
of single 
metal 
sulfides 
We, 
therefore, 
examined 
bismuth sulfide, molybdenum 
sulfide, tung- 
sten sulfide, and nickel sulfide as oxidation 
catalysts. Bismuth 
sulfide was quite active 
and selective except that methylthiophene 
selectivity 
was high 
at 500” and 550°C. 
However, 
at 600°C selectivity 
to isoprene 
was 76% at 75% conversion. 
With 
the 
molybdenum 
sulfide extensive amounts 
of 
methylthiophene 
were also produced 
at 
5OO”C, but at 600°C isoprene was made with 
selectivity 
equal to that obtained with the 
sulfided bismuth 
molybdenum 
or tungsten 
catalysts 
(75% selectivity 
at 69% conver- 
sion). Furthermore, 
the activity 
was quite 
high, due either to a higher surface area or 
to a higher 
intrinsic 
activity. 
Tungsten 
sulfide and nickel sulfide are slightly 
less 
selective but quite active. 
A number 
of other 
catalysts 
were ex- 
amined, 
and examples of the results ob- 
tained are listed in Table 1. Quite a few of 
these were only slightly 
less selective than 
those 
discussed 
above. 
Calcium 
nickel 
phosphate 
was quite 
good, especially 
at 
600°C. Metal 
phosphates in general were 
good and required 
no presulfiding. 
A his 
muth-tin-iron-tungstate.molybdate 
and 
a 
bismuth 
phosphate 
gave selectivities 
to 
isoprene of about 80% at 30400/,

Silver

Indium

However, 
4-87& selectivity 
to isopentane was found, along with 
sub- 
st#antial amounts of butylene 
and methane. 
Activity, 
although 
low, was substantially 
above “thermal” 
(quartz 
chips, Table 1). 
Furthermore, 
quartz chips did not produce 
the isopentane found with the indium phos- 
phate. Chromia on alumina produced large 
amounts of methylthiophene, 
especially at 
lower temperatures. 
At 325”C, selectivity 
to methylthiophene 
was 86% at isoamylene 
conversion of 81%.

Fresh ironcalcium 
phosphat’e gave com- 
plete combu&on 
of t,his olefin. After 
the 
catalyst 
became sulfided, 
reaction 
ceased. 
Practically 
no reaction was obtained 
with 
molybdenum 
sulfide at 450-550”; the small 
amount 
of products 
formed 
consisted 
of 
oxides and sulfides of carbon. 
Propane 
Reaction 
of this compound is T-ery slow 
and not selective; 
the main products 
are 
those of complet,e combustion. 
Propylene 
was the only noncombustion 
product found. 
With 
calcium-nickel 
phosphate 
(GHSV = 
90) at 55O”C, selectivity 
to propylene was 
only 14y0 at 31y0 propane conversion. With 
molybdenum 
sulfide 
(GHSV = 370 after 
100 min and 60 min, respectively) 
at. 5OO”C, 
selectivity 
to propylene 
was 54yo at 11% 
conversion 
and 30$& at 16y0 conversion. 
These results may occur in t,wo ways: the 
initial 
propane reaction may be unselect.ive 
or the propylene 
product 
may 
be very 
suspectible 
to combustion. 
The following 
results tend to eliminate 
the latter. 
Cal- 
cium-nickel 
phosphate is a good and active 
catalyst 
for forming 
isothiazole 
from pro- 
pylene, ammonia, and sulfur dioxide. 
Am- 
monia 
added 
t’o propane-SO2 
over 
this 
phosphate 
catalyst 
should 
scavenge 
t’he 
propylene 
formed 
and prevent 
its corn- 
bustion. Such a reaction \vas tried over both 
calcium-nickel 
phosphate and molybdenum 
sulfide and in no case was the combustion 
diminished. 
It thus appears that the intial 
reaction of the propane itself is not select’ive. 
n-Butane 
Several catalysts 
were examined for the 
oxidation 
of butane 
with 
sulfur 
dioxide. 
Desired reactions were oxidative 
dehydro- 
genation 
to butylene 
or butadiene 
and 
cyclization 
to thiophene. 
Unfortunately, 
no 
catalyst tested was highly selective. Highest 
yield 
of butylene 
plus butadiene 
was ob- 
tained 
with 
a bismuth-iron 
phosphate 
catalyst 
(38oj, selectivity 
to but’ylene plus 
butadiene 
at 86% conversion of butane at’ 
600°C and 240 GHSV, 
22% selectivity 
to 
thiophene). 
Highest selectivity 
to butylene 
plus butadiene 
was obtained 
wit’h nickel 
molybdate 
(48% selectivit’y at 52% conver- 
sion at, 550°C and 200 GHSV, 22% sele&iv- 
ity 
to thiophene). 
The highest 
yield 
of 
thiophene 
was obtained nit,h molybdenum 
sulfide (64y0 selectivity 
at, 71% conversion 
at 550°C and 90 GHST:, 37, selectivity 
to 
butylene 
plus 
butadiene). 
The 
following 
catalyst,s were fairly 
selective to butylene 
and 
butadiene: 
bismuth-iron 
phosphate 
nickel molybdate, 
calcium-iron 
phosphate, 
calcium~nickel 
phosphate, 
calcium-iroil- 
nickel 
phosphate, 
indium 
phosphate, 
bis- 
mut,h phosphate, 
indium 
molybdate, 
and 
molybdenum 
sulfide. The following catalysts 
were moderat,ely 
selective 
to thiophenc: 
molybdenum 
sulfide, tungsten sulfide, nickel 
sulfide, calcium-nickel 
phosphat’e, bismuth 
phosphate, vanadium 
pemoxide-potassium 
sulfate, 
and iridium 
molybdat’e. 
Catalysts 
showing activity 
but poor selectivity 
were 
cahromia on alumina, 
cobalt 
molybdate, 
bismut’h titanate, and a platinum~palladium 
alloy on hlundum. 
Inact,ive catalysts mere 
silver 
phosphate, 
platinum 
on 
Alundum, 
copper oxide (es mirror) 
on ~&mdum, 
and 
quartz rhips. 
The main feature preventing 
high conver- 
sion t.o olefin 
is the furt,her 
reaction 
to 
thiophene. But’ane was oxidized over several 
catalysts 
(bismuth-ion 
phosphat’e, bismuth 
phosphate, nickel molybdate, indium molyb- 
date, phosphomolybdic 
acid; GHSV = 90- 
480, 410-640°C) 
with 
oxygen 
instead 
of 
sulfur 
dioxide 
to prevent 
this further 
re- 
action. h comparison of these results with 
104 
C. R. 
ADAMS 
those with sulfur dioxide shows that in all 
cases the selectivity 
to unsaturated 
hydro- 
carbons was less with the oxygen than with 
the sulfur dioxide. 
Isobutane 
This paraffin 
with 
its tertiary 
hydrogen 
should react more easily than propane or 
butane. Furthermore, 
thiophene 
formation 
cannot occur. Isobutane 
was oxidized over 
molybdenum 
sulfide at 500” and 600°C. No 
effect of temperature was noted. The results 
are given in Table 3. Isobutylene 
was formed

in moderate selectivity 
(70yo at 26yo con- 
version and 61% at 50y0 conversion). 
The 
other 
carbon-containing 
products 
were 
oxides and sulfides of carbon. 
Isopentane 
This compound was oxidized with sulfur 
dioxide 
over two catalysts 
at 450-550°C. 
Iron-calcium 
phosphate initially 
gave high 
conversions 
to COZ, but became substan- 
tially 
more 
selective 
upon 
partial 
self- 
sulfidation. 
A selectivity 
to methylthiophene 
of 55%, with 7yo selectivity 
to isoamylene 
and isoprene at 28% isopentane conversion 
was obtained at 500°C. Molybdenum 
sulfide 
was more 
selective: 
61% 
selectivity 
to 
methylthiophene 
and 28% 
selectivity 
to 
isoamylene and isoprene at 48yo conversion 
was obtained 
at 550°C. Other conditions 
were examined 
for increased dehydrogen- 
ation 
without 
cyclization 
but 
methyl- 
thiophene 
was always 
predominant. 
This 
paraffin can be oxidized quite selectively 
to 
olefin and diolefin but thiophene 
formation 
is so fast that high selectivity 
to the former 
cannot be obtained. 
n-Hexane 
A patent 
to Stringer, 
Kimberlin, 
and 
McQuaid 
(7) has claimed high conversions 
and selectivities 
of n-hexane, 
cyclohexane, 
and n-heptane 
to aromatics 
using sulfur 
dioxide 
with 
a calcium-nickel 
phosphate 
catalyst. 
We have 
verified 
these claims 
and have 
found 
other 
catalysts 
equally 
good or better. 
A summary of the best results obtained 
with the various catalysts is given in Table 
4. The major product 
other than benzene 
is hexene, which could be recycled or con- 
verted in situ with additional 
sulfur dioxide 
and longer 
residence time. 
Diolefin 
and 
triene occur in only minor amounts, 
pre- 
sumably 
due to their 
high reactivity 
for 
cyclization. 
Thiophene 
formation 
also is 
usually small as is combustion. Temperature 
in the range 450-600°C has little 
effect on 
selectivity. 
It is surprising 
that selectivity

to olefin was roughly 
independent 
of con- 
version. 
The highest 
selectivity 
to benzene with 
calcium-nickel 
phosphate catalyst was 58%. 
Indium 
phosphate gave 74% and bismuth- 
iron phosphate 
67%. Several of the other 
catalysts 
are only marginally 
less seIective 
when hexene is also considered. 
Methylcyclopentane 
This 
compound 
was examined 
for two 
purposes: behavior 
of the Cs ring in this 
system and the possibility 
of ring expansion. 
Oxidations 
with sulfur dioxide were carried 
out over a sulfided bismuth-iron 
phosphate 
catalyst 
at 450”-600°C. 
No compounds of 
interest 
were 
made to 
any 
appreciable 
extent. At 550°C and GHSV = 400, about 
75yo of the hydrocarbon 
was converted; 
of the amount converted, about 70y0 did not 
come out of the reactor and presumably 
went to coke on the catalyst. Selectivity 
to 
Cs unsaturated 
compounds was about 4yo 
with the remainder being combustion prod- 
ucts. Thus, 
there was no ring expansion 
and the Cg ring system went to coke, a 
typical 
behavior 
for this 
structure 
type. 
2-Methylpentane 
In analogy with isopentane and 3-methyl- 
pentane 
below, 
it 
was anticipated 
that 
2-methylpentane 
should produce 2,4-dimeth- 
ylthiophene 
(C6H8S) in high yields, since it 
has the branched 
structure 
for reactivity 
and can cyclize to only one product. 
Such 
was not the result. Data are given in Table 5 
for two catalysts. With molybdenum 
sulfide, 
a surprising amount of combustion occurred, 
with 
the best selectivity 
to dimethylthio- 
phene being 33% at 19% conversion. With 
calcium-nickel 
phosphate, 
combustion 
was 
only 
moderate 
but 
dealkylation 
became 
important. 
The best selectivity 
to dimethyl- 
thiophene was 24% at 51yo conversion. In 
comparison with isopentane and 3-methyl- 
pentane, 
2-methylpentane 
is less react.ive 
and less selective than expected. 
3-Xethylpentane 
A subst,antial 
effort 
was spent on the 
sulfur dioxide oxidation 
of this compound 
in attempts to prepare vinylt8hiophene 
as an 
analog of styrene for polymers 
(10). The 
relative complexity 
of such a reaction may 
be visualized 
from the following 
scheme, 
all steps of which appear to be significant:

FIG. 4. Formation of vinylthiophene 
from 3-methylpentane;

Further 
complications 
are caused by general 
combustion 
and dealkylation 
of the sub- 
stituted 
thiophene 
products. 
Thiophthene 
is an analog of naphthalene, 
consisting 
of 
two fused thiophene rings. 
Several catalysts 
were tried for this re- 
action 
and the best was calcium-nickel 
phosphate. Optimum 
temperature 
appeared 
to be about 550°C. Conversion-selectivity 
data at this temperature 
are shown in Fig. 4 
where the circles give conventional 
values 
based on the amount of paraffin converted. 
These results are typical for a material made 
from 
an intermediate 
product 
and also 
susceptible 
to further 
reaction. 
A broad 
maximum 
in selectivity 
(at slightly 
above 
40%) occurs between 50% and 70y0 paraffin 
conversion. 
Some 
of 
the 
products 
are 
precursors 
to 
vinylthiophene 
and 
when 
these (olefin, diene, triene, 
and ethylthio- 
phene) are considered 
to be recycle feed 
material, 
the maximum 
selectivity 
to vinyl- 
t#hiophene is slightly 
over SO%, as shown by 
the 
triangles 
of Fig. 4. Figure 
5 shows 
smoothed curves for conversion-selectivity 
for the various 
products 
formed. Unsatu- 
rated 
hydrocarbons, 
mostly 
olefin, 
are 
formed at first, followed by vinylthiophene 
formation. 
This 
compound 
then 
forms 
thiophthene. 
Combustion 
and dealkylation 
are moderately 
constant. 
For such an as- 
sembly of competing 
and consecutive 
re- 
actions, 
selectivity 
to a particular 
inter- 
mediate is quite sensitive 
to catalyst 
and 
conditions. 
Catalyst 
activity 
is not 
constant, 
as 
shown in Fig. 
6. Activity 
is moderately 
constant 
for an hour or two, followed 
by 
a steady decline in activity. 
Maximum 
SO2 
conversions 
in Fig. 
6 were SO%, so the 
initially 
constant activity 
is not caused by 
oxidant 
depletion. 
This 
loss in 
activity 
is presumably 
due to coke formation 
since 
regeneration 
with oxygen, in which carbon 
dioxide 
is produced, 
restores the activity. 
Attempts at regeneration with sulfur dioxide 
were not successful.

other

FIG. 6. Calcium-nickel 
phosphate activity 
with time. 
S-Methyl-l-pentene 
The results obtained above indicate that 
olefin is an intermediate 
in the formation 
of vinylthiophene 
from 
3-methylpentane. 
3-Methyl-l-pentene 
was oxidized with sulfur 
dioxide over several catalysts. As with the 
paraffin, 
calcium-nickel 
phosphate was the 
best catalyst. 
At 
550°C and 490 GHSV, 
olefin conversion was 83%. 
Although 
data at low conversions 
were 
not obtained, 
the olefin does not appear 
to be more reactive 
than 
the 
paraffin. 
Smoothed 
conversion-selectivity 
data 
for 
the olefin over calcium-nickel 
phosphate at 
550°C are given in Fig. 7. The major prod- 
uct is diolefin until very high conversion is 
reached. Highest 
selectivity 
to vinylthio- 
phene was 37y0 at 95% olefin conversion. 
Figure 
7 indicates 
that 
this 
selectivity 
cannot go too much higher since the amounts 
of vinylthiophene 
precursors are becoming 
quite low. A major source of selectivity 
loss 
is the 
formation 
of 
dimethylthiophene, 
presumably 
through 
cyclization 
of 
the 
diene. 
Although 
3-methyl-1-pentene 
may 
not be entirely 
representative 
of the olefin 
intermediates 
in the oxidation of the paraffin 
the major 
selectivity 
differences 
(in the 
olefin vs. paraffin feed) may be due to the 
much higher concentration 
of diene inter- 
mediate when olefin is fed. If this is true, 
the kinetics for the various consecutive and 
parallel reactions must be different. Various 
amounts of oxygen were added to the feed 
in some of these experiments, 
primarily 
to 
decrease the rate of catalyst decline due to 
coking, 
but this oxygen went 
quickly 
to 
complete 
combustion 
and 
even massive 
amounts 
failed to stabilize 
activity, 
while 
increasing 
selectivity 
to combustion 
prod- 
ucts substantially. 
&Ethyl-I-pentene 
In analogy with other results, this com- 
pound 
should 
form 
2-methyl-3-vinylthio- 
phene in good selectivity.

compound 
would 
involve 
attack 
at the 
quite 
unreactive 
4-position. 
3-Ethyl-l- 
pentene was oxidized 
with 
SO2 over three 
catalysts 
in the range 450-550°C. 
In all 
cases activity 
declined very rapidly. 
Also 
very large losses, either to coke or polymer, 
occurred 
whenever 
the 
conversion 
was 
high. 
One of the 
major 
products 
was 
a surprise: 
toluene 
with 
calcium-nickel 
phosphate 
and olefin 
conversion 
of 47%, 
the selectivity 
to diolefin was 34oj,, toluene 
30y0, methylethylthiophene 
15$&, methyl- 
vinylthiophene 
IS%, and carbon disulfide 
3y0. No evidence for appreciable 
amounts 
of the bicyclic C,H& 
compound was found 
in any of these experiments. 
Bismuth-iron 
phosphate, 
at 33y0 conversion, 
gave selec- 
tivity 
to diolefin 
of 55%,, toluene 
30%,, 
methylethylthiophene 
7y0 
methylvinyl- 
thiophene 
6%, and carbon disulfide 
2%. 
Molybdenum 
sulfide gave comparable prod- 
uct 
distribution 
but 
losses were much 
greater. 
The formation 
of toluene and the large 
losses may be expected if cyclic C& inter- 
mediates are postulated, 
but this type of 
reaction 
has not 
been evident 
in other 
studies in this system. 3-Methyl-1-pentene 
did not show large losses or formation 
of 
benzene, nor was toluene noted in the oxi- 
dation 
of 3-ethyl-1-pentene 
over bismuth 
molybdate with oxygen (a). This is another 
illustration 
of the complexity 
of the catalytic 
oxidation 
of hydrocarbons 
with SOZ. 
n-Dodecane 
This compound was examined to extend 
paraffin 
oxidation 
into the large molecule 
range. Homocyclic 
aromatization 
and thio- 
phene formation 
are likely 
reactions 
of 
long-chain 
molecules. 
Dodecane 
was oxi- 
dized with sulfur dioxide over two catalysts 
at 500-600°C. Surprisingly, 
very little thio- 
phene or combustion 
occurred. 
However, 
olefins were not made in high selectivity. 
With 
calcium-nickel 
phosphate 
at 55O”C, 
GHSV = 1100 and paraffin 
conversion 
of 
36y0, the selectivity 
to olefins was 31y0,, 
13oJ, to diolefins, 
29% to aromatics, 
and 
28y0 to cracked products. With molybdenum 
sulfide at 6OO”C, GHSV = 1100 and paraffin 
conversion of 48%, the selectivity 
to olefins 
was 24%, 34y0 to diolefins, 
26% to aro- 
matics, and 24% to cracked products. The 
aromatics 
are lower with 
dodecane than 
with 
smaller chain length 
but still 
quite 
appreciable. 
Cracking 
is also substantial.

Crotonaldehyde 
The 
oxidative 
cyclization 
of crotonal- 
dehyde to furan 
with 
oxygen as oxidant 
proceeds with 
fair 
selectivity 
(11). This 
reaction 
was also examined 
with 
sulfur 
dioxide as oxidant 
to see if this selectivity 
could 
be improved. 
Molybdenum 
sulfide 
had very little 
activity 
at 450-550°C. 
No 
furan, 
thiophene, 
or 
other 
four-carbon 
compounds were formed; the main products 
were carbon monoxide and propylene. Fresh 
iron-calcium 
phosphate gave complete com- 
bustion to COZ, presumably 
due to oxygen 
on the catalyst,. The catalyst was still active 
after 
sulfiding, 
giving 
mainly 
oxides and 
and sulfides of carbon, very little propylene 
and no evidence of four-carbon 
compounds. 
Mesityl 
oxide 
The 
oxidative 
cyclization 
of 
mesityl 
oxide to 2,kdimethylfuran 
proceeds with 
good selectivity 
with oxygen over bismuth 
molybdate 
(10,11) (77% selectivity 
at 37’% 
conversion or 61% selectivity 
at 61% con- 
version). 
The sulfur 
dioxide 
oxidation 
of 
mesityl 
oxide was examined to see if this 
selectivity 
could be improved 
and also to 
ascertain to what extent sulfur enters the 
molecule instead of oxygen. 
Results with 
molybdenum 
sulfide catalyst 
are given in 
Table 7. Very little dimethylthiophene 
was 
formed: the selectivity 
to this material was 
only l-27$ at 500-600°C. Dimethylfuran 
was 
t’he major product formed with 79% selec- 
tivity 
at 47% conversion 
at 550°C. Other 
products were oxides and sulfides of carbon. 
The use of sulfur dioxide instead of oxygen 
results in a selectivity 
increase of about 5%. 
A disadvantage 
of the sulfur dioxide system 
is that 
the catalyst 
requires 
periodic 
air 
regeneration. 
DISCUSSION 
A brief summary of results for the various 
paraffins 
and olefins is given in Table 
8. 
Reaction rates and product selectivities 
are 
very dependent on hydrocarbon 
feed struc- 
ture. Branching 
and increasing chain length 
increase reactivity 
substantially. 
Dehydro- 
genation appears to be the first reaction in all 
cases. Olefins are dehydrogenated 
selectively 
to dienes, but at high 
conversions 
these 
dienes 
are convert’ed 
to 
thiophenes. 
If 
there is a linear Cd or Cg chain, thiophenes 
are produced so fast that it is difficult 
to 
obtain large yields of olefin or diene inter- 
mediate from paraffins. 
If there is a Cg or 
longer chain, aromatization 
becomes very 
rapid and thiophene formation is quite low. 
Cyclic Cg rings go to coke. Certain reactions 
stand out as interest,ing: 
olefins to dienes, 
dienes to thiophenes, 
cyclization 
of mesityl 
oxide, isobutane to isobutylene, 
butane and 
isopentane to the corresponding t.hiophenes, 
hexane to benzene, and 3-methylpent’ane 
to 
vinylthiophene. 
Certain suprises also occur- 
red: very poor selectivity 
for propane to pro- 
pylene presumably 
due to low propane re- 
activity, 
large amount of dealkylation 
and 
combustion 
for 2-methylpentane, 
and large 
amounts of coke and t*oluene from 3-ethyl-l- 
pentene.

certainly 
holds promise for certain reactions 
but the behavior of various hydrocarbons 
is 
quite 
dependent’ 
on individual 
structure. 
The nature of the catalyst surface is not 
known, but in a number of cases it would 
appear to be predominantly 
in the sulfide 
form. The oxygen that is in the sulfur di- 
oxide ends up in the form of water and may 
go through 
a surface oxide stage. The in- 
creased selectivity 
of isoamylene oxidat,ion 
over 
sulfided 
bismuth 
molybdate 
with 
sulfur dioxide 
instead of oxygen is clearly 
due to a chemical modification 
of the surface, 
because an oxide surface will 
give large 
amounts of carbon dioxide and other oxy- 
genated compounds 
even when sulfur 
di- 
oxide is fed. The coke buildup 
and lower 
activity 
of the sulfide 
catalysts 
are also 
significant,. 
It is not at all clear how these catalyst,s 
work. Metal phosphates and sulfides are gen- 
erally good for oxidation with sulfur dioxide, 
with 
the phosphates being perferred since 
they do not have a tendency to absorb excess 
oxygen, 
which 
leads to combustion. 
The 
reac+on 
is clearly an oxidation 
intimat’ely 
involving 
the sulfur dioxide, since react,ion 
of the hydrocarbon 
essentially ceases when 
the sulfur dioxide is removed from the feed. 
Thus the reaction is not a simple dehydro- 
genation followed by reaction of the hydro- 
gen produced with the sulfur dioxide to give 
hydrogen 
sulfide and water. The reactions 
appear to start with relatively 
simple hydro- 
gen atom 
abstractions. 
It, is not known 
whether 
this abstraction 
is done by the 
catalyst 
or by an adsorbed species formed 
from the sulfur dioxide in analogy with the 
bismuth 
molybdatttoxygen 
system where 
the hydrogen 
atom abstractions 
are per- 
formed by adsorbed oxygen atoms (2). 
For many feeds, the sulfur dioxide oxi- 
dation system offers substantial 
selectivity 
advantages 
over the oxygen system. This 
is due mainly to a much lower susceptibility 
t,o combustion 
and a lack of direct incorpo- 
ration of heteroatoms 
in the feed molecule.
