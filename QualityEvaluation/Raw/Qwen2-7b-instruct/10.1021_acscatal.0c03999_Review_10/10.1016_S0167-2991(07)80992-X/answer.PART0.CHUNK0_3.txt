[1] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes."
[2] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
[3] "The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

The study focused on comparing the catalytic performance of zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite, and SAPO-34 in the cracking of C4-olefin to produce propylene. Among the tested samples, H-ZSM-5 zeolite was found to be the most effective catalyst for this purpose. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with a smaller crystal size demonstrated superior stability compared to its larger crystal size counterpart over an extended period of operation.
