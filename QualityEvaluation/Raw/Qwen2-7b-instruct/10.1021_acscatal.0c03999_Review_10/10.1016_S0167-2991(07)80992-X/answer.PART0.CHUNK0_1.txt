"Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34"
"Zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as directing agents, respectively."
"It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite."
"Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
"The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

The study compared the effectiveness of different zeolites (H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34) in catalytic cracking of C4-olefins to produce propylene. The results indicated that H-ZSM-5 was the most suitable catalyst among the three due to its high resistance to deactivation and high propylene yield. Moreover, smaller crystal size of H-ZSM-5 exhibited better stability over a prolonged period.

研究比较了三种沸石（H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34）在C4烯烃催化裂解制丙烯中的效果。结果表明，H-ZSM-5是最合适的催化剂，因为它具有高抗失活性和高丙烯产率。此外，H-ZSM-5的小晶粒尺寸表现出更好的长期稳定性。
