[1] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes [9-11]."
[2] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
[3] "The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

The study focuses on the catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefins over zeolites including H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34. These zeolites were synthesized hydrothermally using different directing agents. The research aimed to investigate their performance in cracking C4-olefins to produce propylene. The findings indicate that the acid strength of the samples follows the order of H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite, while their stability in the catalytic test follows the order of H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite. Among the samples, H-ZSM-5 zeolite is found to be the most suitable catalyst for cracking C4-olefins to generate propylene, especially when used in its smaller crystal size form which exhibits higher stability over a longer period of use.

本研究主要关注了C4-烯烃在H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34等沸石上的催化裂解反应。这些沸石通过使用不同的导向剂进行水热合成。研究旨在调查它们在裂解C4-烯烃以产生丙烯的性能。发现样品的酸强度顺序为H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite，而其在催化测试中的稳定性顺序为H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite。在样本中，H-ZSM-5沸石被发现是最适合用于裂解C4-烯烃产生丙烯的催化剂，尤其是在其较小晶粒尺寸形式下，表现出更高的长期稳定性。
