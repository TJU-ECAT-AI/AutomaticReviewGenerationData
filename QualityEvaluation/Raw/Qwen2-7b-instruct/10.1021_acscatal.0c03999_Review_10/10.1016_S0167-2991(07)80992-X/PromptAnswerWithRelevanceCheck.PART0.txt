This study investigated the use of zeolites, specifically H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34, for catalytic cracking of C4-olefins. The results showed that H-ZSM-5 was the most effective catalyst for producing propylene among the tested zeolites. Additionally, smaller crystal sizes of H-ZSM-5 demonstrated higher stability over longer periods of operation compared to larger crystal sizes.

The study compared the effectiveness of different zeolites (H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34) in catalytic cracking of C4-olefins to produce propylene. The results indicated that H-ZSM-5 was the most suitable catalyst among the three due to its high resistance to deactivation and high propylene yield. Moreover, smaller crystal size of H-ZSM-5 exhibited better stability over a prolonged period.

[Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34]
Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene.
The traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory. For example, the naphtha steam cracking process, which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost.
Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low.
And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock.
One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins.
Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes.
In this paper, we explored the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus C4-olefin over three typical catalysts, namely H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34.
Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield.

The document discusses the use of zeolites as catalysts for the catalytic cracking of C4-olefins to produce propylene. Among the three zeolites tested—H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5, and H-SAPO-34—the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was found to be the most effective catalyst for this purpose. This is due to its high stability and high propylene yield compared to the other two zeolites.

The study focuses on the catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefins over zeolites including H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34. These zeolites were synthesized hydrothermally using different directing agents. The research aimed to investigate their performance in cracking C4-olefins to produce propylene. The findings indicate that the acid strength of the samples follows the order of H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite, while their stability in the catalytic test follows the order of H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite. Among the samples, H-ZSM-5 zeolite is found to be the most suitable catalyst for cracking C4-olefins to generate propylene, especially when used in its smaller crystal size form which exhibits higher stability over a longer period of use.
