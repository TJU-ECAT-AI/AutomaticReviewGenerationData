[1] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes [9-11]."
[2] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
[3] "The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

This study investigated the use of zeolites, specifically H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34, for catalytic cracking of C4-olefins. The results showed that H-ZSM-5 was the most effective catalyst for producing propylene among the tested zeolites. Additionally, smaller crystal sizes of H-ZSM-5 demonstrated higher stability over longer periods of operation compared to larger crystal sizes.
