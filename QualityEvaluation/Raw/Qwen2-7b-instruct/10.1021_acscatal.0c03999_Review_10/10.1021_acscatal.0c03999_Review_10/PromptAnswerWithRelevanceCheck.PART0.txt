Comparing different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, we find that sulfur compounds like H2S, S2, and SO2 can improve propylene yield by selectively inhibiting overoxidation and hydrogenolysis. S2 is noted to be particularly effective at reducing overoxidation over ZrO2. However, the formation of byproducts like CS2 poses a significant challenge in optimizing catalyst efficiency for S2ODHP. Developing a structureactivity relationship is crucial for rational catalyst design. In terms of specific challenges, H2S can inhibit the conversion of propane at high concentrations, demonstrating its dual role as both an inhibitor and promoter. Halogen-mediated pathways, such as oxychlorination chemistry over CeO2, EuOX, and metal phosphate-based catalysts, also show promise in achieving selective activation of C3H8. 

The use of sulfur-based additives, such as DMDS and H2S, during thermal cracking enhances selectivity and reduces hydrogenolysis and coke formation. Sulfur is found to suppress cracking reactions on metal catalysts. In studies of sulfur's impact on catalytic propane dehydrogenation, sulfur is typically introduced through in situ sulfidation, a mixture of H2S + O2, SO2, or S2. 

Adding H2S to the reactant stream during uncatalyzed propane dehydrogenation can double the yield of C3H6 to 31% at 815 C. When co-fed with H2S, the selectivity of C3H6 on Pt/MgAl2O4 increases significantly from 47% to 95% without altering its activity. However, at higher H2S concentrations (around 850 ppm), the conversion of propylene is inhibited, showcasing the dual nature of H2S as both a promoter and inhibitor. Sulfur compounds like S2 and H2S have been utilized as cocatalysts to reduce overoxidation during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Research indicates that the addition of H2S can achieve a C3H6 yield of 30.4% at 700 C using γ-Al2O3 and 13% V/Al2O3 catalysts. H2S-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation over LiCl/KCl/MnCl2 molten salt at 705 C can yield up to 60% C3H6. Sulfur in the diatomic state acts as an active species capable of abstracting H species from an alkane. Utilizing sulfur vapor as an oxidant for oxidative propane dehydrogenation at 600950 C over bulk Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3 catalysts has been explored, revealing that the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with a lower metalsulfur bond strength, indicating a more active sulfur species. This leads to sulfur vacancy, which is replenished by gas phase S2, further enhancing the reaction dynamics.

比较不同的硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯中的作用，我们发现，如H2S、S2和SO2等硫化合物能够通过选择性抑制过氧化和氢解来提高丙烯产量。S2特别有效于减少ZrO2上的过氧化。然而，在设计S2ODHP高效催化剂时，CS2等副产品的形成是一个重大挑战。发展结构活性关系对于催化设计至关重要。具体挑战方面，H2S在高浓度下可以抑制丙烷的转化，表明其作为抑制剂和促进剂的双重角色。通过卤素介导的路径，如CeO2、EuOX和金属磷酸盐基催化剂的氯氧化反应，也显示出在选择性激活C3H8方面的潜力。

在热裂解过程中添加硫基添加剂（如DMDS和H2S）可以增强选择性并降低氢解和焦炭生成。研究表明，硫可以抑制金属催化剂上的裂解反应。关于硫对催化丙烷脱氢的影响的研究表明，硫通常通过原位硫化（在存在H2S的情况下）、混合H2S + O2或SO2或S2引入。

将H2S加入未催化的丙烷脱氢反应物流中，可以在815°C时将C3H6的产率提高到31%。当与H2S共喂入时，Pt/MgAl2O4上的C3H6选择性显著增加，从47%提高到95%，而无需改变其活性。然而，在850 ppm以上的高H2S浓度下，丙烯的转化受到抑制，这表明H2S具有双重性质，既是促进剂又是抑制剂。S2和H2S等硫化合物已被用作协同催化剂，以减少氧化脱氢反应期间的过氧化。

研究显示，γ-Al2O3和13% V/Al2O3催化剂上添加H2S可以在700°C时实现C3H6产率为30.4%。在705°C下，通过LiCl/KCl/MnCl2熔融盐进行H2S促进的氧化脱氢可以获得高达60%的C3H6产率。在烷烃中充当活性物种的硫状态可以抽象出H物种。使用硫蒸汽作为氧化剂进行氧化丙烷脱氢，在600至950°C的温度范围内对铁氧化物、镁氧化物和铬氧化物催化剂进行了探索，揭示了金属硫键强度较低时，丙烯形成显着降低的显在活化势垒，表明更活泼的硫物种。这导致硫空位，气体相S2补充这些硫空位，进一步增强了反应动力学。

5. Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane with Sulfur-/Halogen-Containing Compounds

Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2.

In the future, developing a structureactivity relationship will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field.

Selective activation of C3H8 can also be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways, such as (i) dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), (ii) oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), (iii) propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and (iv) molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2).

Typically, the effect of sulfur on the catalytic propane dehydrogenation has been studied in one of the following categories (Figure 20), namely, (i) in situ catalyst sulfidation (in the presence of H2S) but in the absence of O2, (ii) mixture of H2S + O2 or (iii) SO2, and (iv) S2.

H2S can inhibit the conversion and adversely affect the selectivity of propylene at higher concentrations (about 850 ppm) over Pt/Al2O3 underlining the dual role of H2S as an inhibitor and promoter depending on H2S concentration in the feed.

Recently, oxidative propane dehydrogenation utilizing sulfur vapor (S2: C3H8 = 1: 0.3) as an oxidant has been investigated at 600950 C over bulk Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3 catalysts that are activated in a mixture of S2/H2S.

The effect of sulfation has been studied via either synthesizing MeSO4 (Me = Co, Fe, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Mn) or the introduction of SO2 as an oxidant in the co-feed.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 have shown potential in improving propylene yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane compared to conventional oxidants. Soft oxidants like S2 can reduce overoxidation of propane over catalysts like ZrO2, while SO2 can be utilized effectively for this process. However, challenges include the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts when using SO2 as an oxidant. The use of S2 as an oxidant can reduce overoxidation, but the design of efficient catalysts to kinetically inhibit byproduct formation remains a challenge.

2. Halogen-mediated pathways offer alternative methods for dehydrogenating propane to propylene. These pathways involve dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2). Oxychlorination chemistry over catalysts like CeO2, EuOX, and metal phosphates has shown high selectivity and conversion rates, but olefin selectivity is limited due to the formation of COx and polyhalogenation products.

3. Sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can act as promoters for enhancing the dehydrogenation performance of catalysts like Fe, Ni, Cu, Co, Zn, Mn, Mo, etc. This is particularly true for thermal cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes where sulfur-based additives like DMDS and H2S are added as co-feeds. Sulfur can suppress cracking reactivity, making it a beneficial promoter for dehydrogenation.

4. Studies have shown that sulfur-based additives can significantly improve the performance of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the addition of H2S can double the C3H6 yield to 31% at 815°C. Moreover, sulfur compounds like S2 and H2S have been used as cocatalysts to reduce overoxidation of alkanes and olefins during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

5. The dual role of sulfur as both an inhibitor and promoter of propane dehydrogenation depends on the concentration in the feed. At lower concentrations, sulfur enhances the dehydrogenation performance, while at higher concentrations, it can inhibit the conversion and negatively impact propylene selectivity.

6. Research on developing a structure-activity relationship is crucial for rational catalyst design in the field of sulfur-based dehydrogenation processes. Efforts are being made to optimize the design of catalysts that can effectively inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, while maintaining high propylene yield.

7. The use of sulfur vapor (S2) as an oxidant for oxidative propane dehydrogenation at temperatures ranging from 600 to 950°C has been explored. The presence of sulfur vapor improves the C3H6 yield and selectivity compared to conventional oxidants, but the conversion rate is not significantly affected, highlighting the dominance of gas-phase reactions.

8. The introduction of sulfur as a soft oxidant in the form of metal sulfates (MeSO4) or the addition of SO2 as an oxidant can enhance the activity and stability of catalysts like FeOx, Co/Al2O3, and others in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The mechanism involves the electron-withdrawing effect of sulfate species from metal ions, which facilitates the cleavage of the CH bond over the metal-oxygen pair.

9. The use of SO2 as an oxidant in propane dehydrogenation has been investigated, showing that it can increase the conversion of propane; however, the selectivity towards propylene decreases significantly. The low selectivity might be due to the formation of undesired combustion products (COx) rather than C3H6. Additionally, the use of ammonia in the reaction mixture did not change the selectivity much, suggesting that the initial reaction of SO2 with propane might lead to the formation of COx compounds instead of C3H6.

10. The role of activated carbon in selective catalytic oxidation of propane in the presence of SO2 has been explored, showing that improved C3H6 formation can be obtained over catalysts like γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and Ga2O3 due to the in situ generation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) or activated coke. In contrast, Fe2O3, Bi2O3, and PbO-based bulk catalysts undergo sulfidation, leading to decreases in the C3H6 yield under similar reaction conditions.

11. The effect of pore size on the catalytic performance of SO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation over SiO2Al2O3 catalysts has been studied. Pores smaller than 10 nm lead to oxidation or coke products, whereas pores between 10 and 100 nm are optimal for C3H6 formation. The formation of OCP over silica is accompanied by an improved C3H6 yield, but the exact nature of the active sites remains elusive due to the lack of structure-activity relationship and characterization studies using advanced techniques.

Future research directions aim to develop a structure-activity relationship for rational catalyst design, optimize the use of sulfur-based oxidants, and address the challenges of byproduct formation and catalyst stability in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

1. 硫基氧化剂，如H2S、S2和SO2，在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯过程中表现出提高丙烯产率的潜力，与传统氧化剂相比。软氧化剂如S2可以减少在ZrO2催化剂上过氧化反应，而使用SO2作为氧化剂可能是利用SO2的有效方式。然而，挑战包括在使用SO2作为氧化剂时，在金属氧化物催化剂上形成COx产品的低丙烯产量。使用S2作为氧化剂可以减少过氧化，但设计能够抑制副产品形成的高效催化剂仍然是一个挑战。

2. 卤素介导途径为丙烷脱氢到丙烯提供了替代方法。这些途径包括使用分子卤素（X2）进行脱氢、卤素（X2 + O2）存在的氧化脱氢、通过卤化物（HX + O2）进行丙烷氧卤化以及锂卤化盐辅助ODHP（LiX + O2）。CeO2、EuOX和金属磷酸盐（如CrPO4）等催化剂的氧氯化化学显示出高达95%的选择性和高达70%的转化率（在500°C时），与常规ODHP相比。然而，由于形成COx和多卤化产物，烯烃选择性受限。

3. 含硫化合物，如H2S、S2和SO2，可以作为促进剂增强Fe、Ni、Cu、Co、Zn、Mn、Mo等催化剂的脱氢性能。这特别适用于热裂解和流化催化裂解过程，其中添加硫基添加剂如DMDS和H2S作为共喂料。硫可以抑制有机分子在金属催化剂上的裂解活性，使其成为脱氢性能提升的有益促进剂。

4. 研究表明，硫基添加剂可以在丙烷脱氢反应中显著改善催化剂的性能。例如，在815°C下添加H2S可以使C3H6产率翻倍至31%。此外，硫化合物如S2和H2S已被用作氧化脱氢反应中的共催化剂，以减少烷烃和烯烃的过氧化。

5. 硫在丙烷脱氢过程中作为抑制剂和促进剂的双重作用取决于进料中的浓度。在较低浓度下，硫增强脱氢性能；而在较高浓度下，它会抑制转化并负面影响丙烯选择性。

6. 开发结构-活性关系对于在硫基脱氢过程领域进行理性的催化剂设计至关重要。正在进行的努力旨在优化设计能够有效抑制副产品形成，同时保持高丙烯产率的催化剂。

7. 使用硫蒸汽（S2）作为氧化剂进行氧化丙烷脱氢，在600至950°C的温度范围内进行了探索。硫蒸汽的存在提高了C3H6产率和选择性，与传统氧化剂相比。然而，转化率几乎没有受到影响，强调了气相反应的主导地位。

8. 将硫作为软氧化剂的形式引入金属硫酸盐（MeSO4）或添加SO2作为氧化剂可以增强FeOx、Co/Al2O3等催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的活动性和稳定性。机制涉及金属离子上硫酸物种的电子吸引效应，这促进了金属-氧对上CH键的断裂。

9. 在丙烷脱氢过程中使用SO2作为氧化剂的研究显示，它可以增加丙烷的转化率；然而，丙烯选择性显著降低。低选择性可能归因于形成COx化合物而不是C3H6的燃烧产物。此外，氨在反应混合物中的加入并未改变选择性，暗示SO2与丙烷的初始反应可能导致COx化合物的形成，而不是C3H6。

10. 活性炭在SO2存在下选择性催化氧化丙烷的作用被研究，发现由于原位生成氧化缩合产物（OCP）或活化焦炭，γ-Al2O3、SiO2和Ga2O3等催化剂上可以获得改善的C3H6产率。相比之下，Fe2O3、Bi2O3和PbO等基于块状催化剂的硫化导致C3H6产率下降。

11. 对于SiO2Al2O3催化剂而言，孔径大小对SO2辅助氧化脱氢的催化性能有影响。孔径小于10nm会导致氧化或焦炭产物的产生，而孔径在10至100nm之间的孔是C3H6形成的最佳选择。二氧化硅上形成的OCP伴随着C3H6产率的改善，但活性位点的确切性质仍然难以确定，因为缺乏结构-活性关系和使用高级技术的表征研究。

未来的研究方向旨在开发结构-活性关系，优化硫基氧化剂的使用，并解决在氧化脱氢丙烷过程中由副产品形成和催化剂稳定性带来的挑战。

Comparing sulfur-based oxidants to conventional ones in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, we find that sulfur compounds such as H2S, S2, and SO2 can enhance propylene yield. SO2 is noted as an effective oxidant for utilizing SO2, which is an acidic gas, but it tends to produce COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts, limiting propylene formation. S2, a 'soft' oxidant, reduces overoxidation of propane over ZrO2. The challenge lies in inhibiting the formation of byproducts like CS2, which is a significant hurdle in catalyst design for S2ODHP. Developing a structureactivity relationship is crucial for rational catalyst design. 

Halogen-mediated pathways, particularly oxychlorination chemistry over catalysts like CeO2, EuOX, and CrPO4, show high selectivity and conversion rates compared to conventional ODHP. However, olefin selectivity is limited due to COx and polyhalogenation product formation. Efforts are ongoing to optimize propane oxyhalogenation catalysts that exhibit moderate redox properties to prevent alkane overoxidation, combustion, and evolution of Cl2, while ensuring fast dehydrochlorination kinetics.

In the presence of sulfur-based feed, sulfur compounds like DMDS and H2S are added as co-feeds during thermal cracking of hydrocarbons to improve selectivity by suppressing hydrogenolysis or coke formation. Sulfur has been found to inhibit cracking reactions on metal catalysts. Its effect on catalytic propane dehydrogenation is typically studied through in situ sulfidation, mixture of H2S + O2, SO2, or S2. Adding H2S during uncatalyzed propane dehydrogenation can double the C3H6 yield, with selectivity improvements on catalysts like Pt/MgAl2O4. However, H2S can act as both an inhibitor and promoter, depending on its concentration in the feed. Exposure to sulfur feed can lead to the formation of metal sulfides, which modify the active phase of the catalyst, improving dehydrogenation performance. Catalyst precursors containing metal oxides, sulfides, or oxysulfides are activated with sulfur-containing compounds like S2, H2S, SO2, or COS. Utilizing sulfur vapor as an oxidant in the presence of other sulfur compounds can achieve high C3H6 yields at temperatures between 600°C and 950°C over catalysts like Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3. Lower metal-sulfur bond strengths decrease the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation, indicating a more active sulfur species.

对比硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯中的作用，我们发现硫化合物如H2S、S2和SO2可以提高丙烯产量。SO2作为利用SO2的有效氧化剂，但会产生COx产物，限制丙烯形成。S2作为一种“温和”的氧化剂，能减少ZrO2上的丙烷过氧化。抑制CS2等副产品的形成是设计高效催化剂的关键挑战。发展结构活性关系对于这一领域的合理催化剂设计至关重要。

通过铈O2、EuOX和CrPO4等催化剂的氧氯化反应，显示出与常规ODHP相比高选择性和转化率。然而，由于形成了COx和多卤化物产物，烯烃选择性受限。继续努力优化具有适度还原性的丙烷氧氯化催化剂，以防止烷基过氧化、燃烧和氯气的产生，同时确保快速去氢氯化动力学。

在硫基燃料的存在下，在热裂解碳氢化合物过程中添加硫化合物如DMDS和H2S作为共喂料来提高选择性，通过抑制氢解或焦炭形成。硫已被发现抑制金属催化剂上的裂解反应。硫对其催化丙烷脱氢的作用通常是在存在H2S的情况下进行原位硫化，混合H2S + O2或SO2，或S2。在未催化丙烷脱氢中添加H2S可以使C3H6产量翻倍，Pt/MgAl2O4催化剂上的选择性从47%显著提高至95%，而无需改变其活性。然而，H2S在高浓度（约850 ppm）下可能抑制转化并影响丙烯选择性，表明H2S在不同硫含量下的双重作用。暴露于硫燃料中后，金属氧化物可形成相应的金属硫化物（或表面硫化物），并报告提高了异丁烷脱氢产率，表明硫在修改催化剂活性相方面发挥关键作用。催化剂前体可能包含金属氧化物、硫化物或氧化硫化物，并且在存在一个或多个硫含物质如S2、H2S、SO2、COS的情况下激活。利用硫蒸汽作为氧化剂，在Fe2O3、MgO和Cr2O3等催化剂上，通过S2/H2S混合物激活，可以在600°C到950°C的温度范围内获得高C3H6产率。较低的金属-硫键强度降低了丙烯形成所需的显着活化壁垒，表明更活跃的硫物种。

[1] "For example, co-feeding sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can improve propylene yield."
[2] "Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2."
[3] "Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP."
[4] "In the future, developing a structureactivity relationship will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field."
[5] "Specifically, oxychlorination chemistry over CeO2, EuOX, and metal phosphate-based, such as CrPO4, catalysts have shown good selectivity (up to 95%) and conversion (up to 70% at 500 C) in comparison to conventional ODHP."
[6] "Typically, the effect of sulfur on the catalytic propane dehydrogenation has been studied in one of the following categories (Figure 20), namely, (i) in situ catalyst sulfidation (in the presence of H2S) but in the absence of O2, (ii) mixture of H2S + O2 or (iii) SO2, and (iv) S2."
[7] "Of note, H2S can inhibit the conversion and adversely affect the selectivity of propylene at higher concentrations (about 850 ppm) over Pt/Al2O3 underlining the dual role of H2S as an inhibitor and promoter depending on H2S concentration in the feed."
[8] "The authors argued that higher selectivity is due to the preferential activation of CH bonds over CC bonds on metalsulfur ensembles, coupled with facile olefin desorption, thus, effectively reducing the possibility of side reactions and coke generation."
[9] "Recently, oxidative propane dehydrogenation utilizing sulfur vapor (S2: C3H8 = 1: 0.3) as an oxidant has been investigated at 600950 C over bulk Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3 catalysts that are activated in a mixture of S2/H2S."
[10] "They found that the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with lower metalsulfur bond strength, indicating a more active sulfur species."
[11] "In contrast, Fe2O3, Bi2O3, and PbO-based bulk catalysts undergo sulfidation, which leads to decreases in the C3H6 yield under similar reaction conditions (Table 13)."

Comparing sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) to conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, H2S and S2 show promise in improving propylene yield. S2, being a soft oxidant, can reduce overoxidation of propane over ZrO2. Kinetic inhibition of byproduct formation, particularly CS2, is a significant challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP. Developing a structureactivity relationship is crucial for rational catalyst design in this field. 

Oxidative dehydrogenation pathways involving halogen-mediated activation, such as oxychlorination over CeO2, EuOX, and metal phosphates, demonstrate high selectivity and conversion rates compared to conventional ODHP methods. Sulfur compounds, when used as additives in the feed, can enhance dehydrogenation performance by promoting selectivity and reducing coke formation, though their role as both inhibitors and promoters depends on the concentration in the feed. 

Sulfur vapor (S2) has been utilized as an oxidant in oxidative propane dehydrogenation, showing improved propylene yield and selectivity over bulk Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3 catalysts activated in a mixture of S2/H2S. Lower metal-sulfur bond strength indicates a more active sulfur species, leading to a decrease in the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation. However, Fe2O3, Bi2O3, and PbO-based catalysts undergo sulfidation, resulting in reduced C3H6 yield under similar reaction conditions.

Future research focuses on optimizing catalyst design and understanding the structureactivity relationship to enhance selectivity and efficiency in sulfur-based oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

比较含硫氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯过程中的作用，H2S和S2表现出提高丙烯产率的潜力。S2作为软氧化剂，可以减少ZrO2上的丙烷过氧化。抑制副产品的形成，尤其是CS2，是设计高效S2ODHP催化剂的关键挑战。开发结构活性关系对于该领域合理催化剂设计至关重要。

通过卤素介导激活的氧化脱氢路径，如使用CeO2、EuOX和金属磷酸盐的氧氯化反应，显示与常规ODHP方法相比具有高选择性和转化率。在催化剂中添加硫化合物可以增强脱氢性能，促进选择性并减少焦炭生成，但它们作为抑制剂和促进剂的作用取决于喂料中的硫浓度。 

已使用硫蒸汽（S2）作为氧化剂进行氧化丙烷脱氢，显示出在混合S2/H2S激活的Fe2O3、MgO和Cr2O3催化剂上改善丙烯产率和选择性的潜力。较低的金属-硫键强度表明更活跃的硫物种，导致丙烯形成显着降低的活化势垒。然而，Fe2O3、Bi2O3和PbO基催化剂发生硫化，导致相似条件下C3H6产率降低。

未来研究集中在优化催化剂设计和理解结构活性关系，以提高硫基氧化脱氢过程的选择性和效率。
