5. Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane with Sulfur-/Halogen-Containing Compounds

Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2.

In the future, developing a structureactivity relationship will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field.

Selective activation of C3H8 can also be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways, such as (i) dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), (ii) oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), (iii) propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and (iv) molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2).

Typically, the effect of sulfur on the catalytic propane dehydrogenation has been studied in one of the following categories (Figure 20), namely, (i) in situ catalyst sulfidation (in the presence of H2S) but in the absence of O2, (ii) mixture of H2S + O2 or (iii) SO2, and (iv) S2.

H2S can inhibit the conversion and adversely affect the selectivity of propylene at higher concentrations (about 850 ppm) over Pt/Al2O3 underlining the dual role of H2S as an inhibitor and promoter depending on H2S concentration in the feed.

Recently, oxidative propane dehydrogenation utilizing sulfur vapor (S2: C3H8 = 1: 0.3) as an oxidant has been investigated at 600950 C over bulk Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3 catalysts that are activated in a mixture of S2/H2S.

The effect of sulfation has been studied via either synthesizing MeSO4 (Me = Co, Fe, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Mn) or the introduction of SO2 as an oxidant in the co-feed.

1. Sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 have shown potential in improving propylene yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane compared to conventional oxidants. Soft oxidants like S2 can reduce overoxidation of propane over catalysts like ZrO2, while SO2 can be utilized effectively for this process. However, challenges include the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts when using SO2 as an oxidant. The use of S2 as an oxidant can reduce overoxidation, but the design of efficient catalysts to kinetically inhibit byproduct formation remains a challenge.

2. Halogen-mediated pathways offer alternative methods for dehydrogenating propane to propylene. These pathways involve dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2). Oxychlorination chemistry over catalysts like CeO2, EuOX, and metal phosphates has shown high selectivity and conversion rates, but olefin selectivity is limited due to the formation of COx and polyhalogenation products.

3. Sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can act as promoters for enhancing the dehydrogenation performance of catalysts like Fe, Ni, Cu, Co, Zn, Mn, Mo, etc. This is particularly true for thermal cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes where sulfur-based additives like DMDS and H2S are added as co-feeds. Sulfur can suppress cracking reactivity, making it a beneficial promoter for dehydrogenation.

4. Studies have shown that sulfur-based additives can significantly improve the performance of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the addition of H2S can double the C3H6 yield to 31% at 815°C. Moreover, sulfur compounds like S2 and H2S have been used as cocatalysts to reduce overoxidation of alkanes and olefins during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

5. The dual role of sulfur as both an inhibitor and promoter of propane dehydrogenation depends on the concentration in the feed. At lower concentrations, sulfur enhances the dehydrogenation performance, while at higher concentrations, it can inhibit the conversion and negatively impact propylene selectivity.

6. Research on developing a structure-activity relationship is crucial for rational catalyst design in the field of sulfur-based dehydrogenation processes. Efforts are being made to optimize the design of catalysts that can effectively inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, while maintaining high propylene yield.

7. The use of sulfur vapor (S2) as an oxidant for oxidative propane dehydrogenation at temperatures ranging from 600 to 950°C has been explored. The presence of sulfur vapor improves the C3H6 yield and selectivity compared to conventional oxidants, but the conversion rate is not significantly affected, highlighting the dominance of gas-phase reactions.

8. The introduction of sulfur as a soft oxidant in the form of metal sulfates (MeSO4) or the addition of SO2 as an oxidant can enhance the activity and stability of catalysts like FeOx, Co/Al2O3, and others in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The mechanism involves the electron-withdrawing effect of sulfate species from metal ions, which facilitates the cleavage of the CH bond over the metal-oxygen pair.

9. The use of SO2 as an oxidant in propane dehydrogenation has been investigated, showing that it can increase the conversion of propane; however, the selectivity towards propylene decreases significantly. The low selectivity might be due to the formation of undesired combustion products (COx) rather than C3H6. Additionally, the use of ammonia in the reaction mixture did not change the selectivity much, suggesting that the initial reaction of SO2 with propane might lead to the formation of COx compounds instead of C3H6.

10. The role of activated carbon in selective catalytic oxidation of propane in the presence of SO2 has been explored, showing that improved C3H6 formation can be obtained over catalysts like γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and Ga2O3 due to the in situ generation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) or activated coke. In contrast, Fe2O3, Bi2O3, and PbO-based bulk catalysts undergo sulfidation, leading to decreases in the C3H6 yield under similar reaction conditions.

11. The effect of pore size on the catalytic performance of SO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation over SiO2Al2O3 catalysts has been studied. Pores smaller than 10 nm lead to oxidation or coke products, whereas pores between 10 and 100 nm are optimal for C3H6 formation. The formation of OCP over silica is accompanied by an improved C3H6 yield, but the exact nature of the active sites remains elusive due to the lack of structure-activity relationship and characterization studies using advanced techniques.

Future research directions aim to develop a structure-activity relationship for rational catalyst design, optimize the use of sulfur-based oxidants, and address the challenges of byproduct formation and catalyst stability in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

8. 将硫作为软氧化剂的形式引入金属硫酸盐（MeSO4）或添加SO2作为氧化剂可以增强FeOx、Co/Al2O3等催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的活动性和稳定性。机制涉及金属离子上硫酸物种的电子吸引效应，这促进了金属-氧对上CH键的断裂。

9. 在丙烷脱氢过程中使用SO2作为氧化剂的研究显示，它可以增加丙烷的转化率；然而，丙烯选择性显著降低。低选择性可能归因于形成COx化合物而不是C3H6的燃烧产物。此外，氨在反应混合物中的加入并未改变选择性，暗示SO2与丙烷的初始反应可能导致COx化合物的形成，而不是C3H6。

10. 活性炭在SO2存在下选择性催化氧化丙烷的作用被研究，发现由于原位生成氧化缩合产物（OCP）或活化焦炭，γ-Al2O3、SiO2和Ga2O3等催化剂上可以获得改善的C3H6产率。相比之下，Fe2O3、Bi2O3和PbO等基于块状催化剂的硫化导致C3H6产率下降。

11. 对于SiO2Al2O3催化剂而言，孔径大小对SO2辅助氧化脱氢的催化性能有影响。孔径小于10nm会导致氧化或焦炭产物的产生，而孔径在10至100nm之间的孔是C3H6形成的最佳选择。二氧化硅上形成的OCP伴随着C3H6产率的改善，但活性位点的确切性质仍然难以确定，因为缺乏结构-活性关系和使用高级技术的表征研究。

未来的研究方向旨在开发结构-活性关系，优化硫基氧化剂的使用，并解决在氧化脱氢丙烷过程中由副产品形成和催化剂稳定性带来的挑战。
