[1] "For example, co-feeding sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can improve propylene yield."
[2] "Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2."
[3] "Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP."
[4] "In the future, developing a structureactivity relationship will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field."
[5] "Specifically, oxychlorination chemistry over CeO2, EuOX, and metal phosphate-based, such as CrPO4, catalysts have shown good selectivity (up to 95%) and conversion (up to 70% at 500 C) in comparison to conventional ODHP."
[6] "Typically, the effect of sulfur on the catalytic propane dehydrogenation has been studied in one of the following categories (Figure 20), namely, (i) in situ catalyst sulfidation (in the presence of H2S) but in the absence of O2, (ii) mixture of H2S + O2 or (iii) SO2, and (iv) S2."
[7] "Of note, H2S can inhibit the conversion and adversely affect the selectivity of propylene at higher concentrations (about 850 ppm) over Pt/Al2O3 underlining the dual role of H2S as an inhibitor and promoter depending on H2S concentration in the feed."
[8] "The authors argued that higher selectivity is due to the preferential activation of CH bonds over CC bonds on metalsulfur ensembles, coupled with facile olefin desorption, thus, effectively reducing the possibility of side reactions and coke generation."
[9] "Recently, oxidative propane dehydrogenation utilizing sulfur vapor (S2: C3H8 = 1: 0.3) as an oxidant has been investigated at 600950 C over bulk Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3 catalysts that are activated in a mixture of S2/H2S."
[10] "They found that the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with lower metalsulfur bond strength, indicating a more active sulfur species."
[11] "In contrast, Fe2O3, Bi2O3, and PbO-based bulk catalysts undergo sulfidation, which leads to decreases in the C3H6 yield under similar reaction conditions (Table 13)."

Comparing sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) to conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, H2S and S2 show promise in improving propylene yield. S2, being a soft oxidant, can reduce overoxidation of propane over ZrO2. Kinetic inhibition of byproduct formation, particularly CS2, is a significant challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP. Developing a structureactivity relationship is crucial for rational catalyst design in this field. 

Oxidative dehydrogenation pathways involving halogen-mediated activation, such as oxychlorination over CeO2, EuOX, and metal phosphates, demonstrate high selectivity and conversion rates compared to conventional ODHP methods. Sulfur compounds, when used as additives in the feed, can enhance dehydrogenation performance by promoting selectivity and reducing coke formation, though their role as both inhibitors and promoters depends on the concentration in the feed. 

Sulfur vapor (S2) has been utilized as an oxidant in oxidative propane dehydrogenation, showing improved propylene yield and selectivity over bulk Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3 catalysts activated in a mixture of S2/H2S. Lower metal-sulfur bond strength indicates a more active sulfur species, leading to a decrease in the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation. However, Fe2O3, Bi2O3, and PbO-based catalysts undergo sulfidation, resulting in reduced C3H6 yield under similar reaction conditions.

Future research focuses on optimizing catalyst design and understanding the structureactivity relationship to enhance selectivity and efficiency in sulfur-based oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

比较含硫氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯过程中的作用，H2S和S2表现出提高丙烯产率的潜力。S2作为软氧化剂，可以减少ZrO2上的丙烷过氧化。抑制副产品的形成，尤其是CS2，是设计高效S2ODHP催化剂的关键挑战。开发结构活性关系对于该领域合理催化剂设计至关重要。

通过卤素介导激活的氧化脱氢路径，如使用CeO2、EuOX和金属磷酸盐的氧氯化反应，显示与常规ODHP方法相比具有高选择性和转化率。在催化剂中添加硫化合物可以增强脱氢性能，促进选择性并减少焦炭生成，但它们作为抑制剂和促进剂的作用取决于喂料中的硫浓度。 

已使用硫蒸汽（S2）作为氧化剂进行氧化丙烷脱氢，显示出在混合S2/H2S激活的Fe2O3、MgO和Cr2O3催化剂上改善丙烯产率和选择性的潜力。较低的金属-硫键强度表明更活跃的硫物种，导致丙烯形成显着降低的活化势垒。然而，Fe2O3、Bi2O3和PbO基催化剂发生硫化，导致相似条件下C3H6产率降低。

未来研究集中在优化催化剂设计和理解结构活性关系，以提高硫基氧化脱氢过程的选择性和效率。
