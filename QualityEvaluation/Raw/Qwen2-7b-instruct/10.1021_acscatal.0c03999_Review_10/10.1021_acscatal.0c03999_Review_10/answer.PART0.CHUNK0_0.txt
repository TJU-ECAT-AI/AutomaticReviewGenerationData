[1] "Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2."
[2] "Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP."
[3] "The role of sulfur as a promoter or inhibitor is well studied in the literature for hydrogenation reactions."
[4] "Typically, the effect of sulfur on the catalytic propane dehydrogenation has been studied in one of the following categories (Figure 20), namely, (i) in situ catalyst sulfidation (in the presence of H2S) but in the absence of O2, (ii) mixture of H2S + O2 or (iii) SO2, and (iv) S2."
[5] "The addition of H2S in the reactant stream doubles the C3H6 yield to 31% at 815 C."
[6] "Of note, H2S can inhibit the conversion and adversely affect the selectivity of propylene at higher concentrations (about 850 ppm) over Pt/Al2O3 underlining the dual role of H2S as an inhibitor and promoter depending on H2S concentration in the feed."
[7] "Recently, oxidative propane dehydrogenation utilizing sulfur vapor (S2: C3H8 = 1: 0.3) as an oxidant has been investigated at 600950 C over bulk Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3 catalysts that are activated in a mixture of S2/H2S."
[8] "They found that the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with lower metalsulfur bond strength, indicating a more active sulfur species."

1. Soft oxidants like S2 can reduce overoxidation of propane over ZrO2. Designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP faces the challenge of inhibiting byproduct formation, specifically CS2. 
2. Sulfur acts both as a promoter and inhibitor in hydrogenation reactions, depending on its concentration in the feed.
3. Sulfur's impact on catalytic propane dehydrogenation has been studied through in situ sulfidation, mixtures of H2S and O2, SO2, and S2.
4. Adding H2S to the reactant stream can significantly increase C3H6 yield, especially at high temperatures. However, at higher concentrations, it can inhibit conversion and negatively affect propylene selectivity.
5. Sulfur vapor (S2) can be utilized as an oxidant for oxidative propane dehydrogenation at various temperatures over specific catalysts.
6. Lower metal-sulfur bond strength in catalysts leads to a decrease in the activation barrier for propylene formation, indicating a more active sulfur species.

1. 软氧化剂如S2可以减少ZrO2上的丙烷过氧化。设计高效的S2ODHP催化剂面临抑制副产品形成的主要挑战，尤其是CS2。
2. 硫在氢化反应中既作为促进剂又作为抑制剂，具体取决于其在流体中的浓度。
3. 对于催化丙烷脱氢作用，硫的影响已通过原位硫化、H2S和O2的混合、SO2和S2进行了研究。
4. 向反应物流中添加H2S可以显著提高C3H6的产率，尤其是在高温下。然而，在更高浓度下，它可能抑制转化并负面影响丙烯选择性。
5. 在特定催化剂上，硫蒸汽（S2）可以用作氧化剂进行氧化丙烷脱氢作用，温度范围为600至950摄氏度。
6. 催化剂中金属-硫键强度较低会导致丙烯形成活化能降低，表明更活跃的硫物种。
