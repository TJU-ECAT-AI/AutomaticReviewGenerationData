Comparing different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, we find that sulfur compounds like H2S, S2, and SO2 can improve propylene yield by selectively inhibiting overoxidation and hydrogenolysis. S2 is noted to be particularly effective at reducing overoxidation over ZrO2. However, the formation of byproducts like CS2 poses a significant challenge in optimizing catalyst efficiency for S2ODHP. Developing a structureactivity relationship is crucial for rational catalyst design. In terms of specific challenges, H2S can inhibit the conversion of propane at high concentrations, demonstrating its dual role as both an inhibitor and promoter. Halogen-mediated pathways, such as oxychlorination chemistry over CeO2, EuOX, and metal phosphate-based catalysts, also show promise in achieving selective activation of C3H8. 

The use of sulfur-based additives, such as DMDS and H2S, during thermal cracking enhances selectivity and reduces hydrogenolysis and coke formation. Sulfur is found to suppress cracking reactions on metal catalysts. In studies of sulfur's impact on catalytic propane dehydrogenation, sulfur is typically introduced through in situ sulfidation, a mixture of H2S + O2, SO2, or S2. 

Adding H2S to the reactant stream during uncatalyzed propane dehydrogenation can double the yield of C3H6 to 31% at 815 C. When co-fed with H2S, the selectivity of C3H6 on Pt/MgAl2O4 increases significantly from 47% to 95% without altering its activity. However, at higher H2S concentrations (around 850 ppm), the conversion of propylene is inhibited, showcasing the dual nature of H2S as both a promoter and inhibitor. Sulfur compounds like S2 and H2S have been utilized as cocatalysts to reduce overoxidation during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Research indicates that the addition of H2S can achieve a C3H6 yield of 30.4% at 700 C using γ-Al2O3 and 13% V/Al2O3 catalysts. H2S-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation over LiCl/KCl/MnCl2 molten salt at 705 C can yield up to 60% C3H6. Sulfur in the diatomic state acts as an active species capable of abstracting H species from an alkane. Utilizing sulfur vapor as an oxidant for oxidative propane dehydrogenation at 600950 C over bulk Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3 catalysts has been explored, revealing that the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with a lower metalsulfur bond strength, indicating a more active sulfur species. This leads to sulfur vacancy, which is replenished by gas phase S2, further enhancing the reaction dynamics.

比较不同的硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯中的作用，我们发现，如H2S、S2和SO2等硫化合物能够通过选择性抑制过氧化和氢解来提高丙烯产量。S2特别有效于减少ZrO2上的过氧化。然而，在设计S2ODHP高效催化剂时，CS2等副产品的形成是一个重大挑战。发展结构活性关系对于催化设计至关重要。具体挑战方面，H2S在高浓度下可以抑制丙烷的转化，表明其作为抑制剂和促进剂的双重角色。通过卤素介导的路径，如CeO2、EuOX和金属磷酸盐基催化剂的氯氧化反应，也显示出在选择性激活C3H8方面的潜力。

在热裂解过程中添加硫基添加剂（如DMDS和H2S）可以增强选择性并降低氢解和焦炭生成。研究表明，硫可以抑制金属催化剂上的裂解反应。关于硫对催化丙烷脱氢的影响的研究表明，硫通常通过原位硫化（在存在H2S的情况下）、混合H2S + O2或SO2或S2引入。

将H2S加入未催化的丙烷脱氢反应物流中，可以在815°C时将C3H6的产率提高到31%。当与H2S共喂入时，Pt/MgAl2O4上的C3H6选择性显著增加，从47%提高到95%，而无需改变其活性。然而，在850 ppm以上的高H2S浓度下，丙烯的转化受到抑制，这表明H2S具有双重性质，既是促进剂又是抑制剂。S2和H2S等硫化合物已被用作协同催化剂，以减少氧化脱氢反应期间的过氧化。

研究显示，γ-Al2O3和13% V/Al2O3催化剂上添加H2S可以在700°C时实现C3H6产率为30.4%。在705°C下，通过LiCl/KCl/MnCl2熔融盐进行H2S促进的氧化脱氢可以获得高达60%的C3H6产率。在烷烃中充当活性物种的硫状态可以抽象出H物种。使用硫蒸汽作为氧化剂进行氧化丙烷脱氢，在600至950°C的温度范围内对铁氧化物、镁氧化物和铬氧化物催化剂进行了探索，揭示了金属硫键强度较低时，丙烯形成显着降低的显在活化势垒，表明更活泼的硫物种。这导致硫空位，气体相S2补充这些硫空位，进一步增强了反应动力学。
