[2] "Using SO2 as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize SO2, which is an acidic gas."
[3] "Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2."

[6] "Specifically, oxychlorination chemistry over CeO2, EuOX, and metal phosphate-based, such as CrPO4, catalysts have shown good selectivity (up to 95%) and conversion (up to 70% at 500 C) in comparison to conventional ODHP."
[7] "Still, the olefin selectivity is limited because of the formation of COx and polyhalogenation products."
[8] "Thermal (or steam) cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of hydrocarbons are the most important processes in the production of olefins, the building blocks of the chemical industry."
[9] "To improve selectivity (i.e., reduce hydrogenolysis or coke formation), sulfur-based additives, such as dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and H2S, are often added as a dilute co-feed during the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons."

Comparing sulfur-based oxidants to conventional ones in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, we find that sulfur compounds such as H2S, S2, and SO2 can enhance propylene yield. SO2 is noted as an effective oxidant for utilizing SO2, which is an acidic gas, but it tends to produce COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts, limiting propylene formation. S2, a 'soft' oxidant, reduces overoxidation of propane over ZrO2. The challenge lies in inhibiting the formation of byproducts like CS2, which is a significant hurdle in catalyst design for S2ODHP. Developing a structureactivity relationship is crucial for rational catalyst design. 

Halogen-mediated pathways, particularly oxychlorination chemistry over catalysts like CeO2, EuOX, and CrPO4, show high selectivity and conversion rates compared to conventional ODHP. However, olefin selectivity is limited due to COx and polyhalogenation product formation. Efforts are ongoing to optimize propane oxyhalogenation catalysts that exhibit moderate redox properties to prevent alkane overoxidation, combustion, and evolution of Cl2, while ensuring fast dehydrochlorination kinetics.

In the presence of sulfur-based feed, sulfur compounds like DMDS and H2S are added as co-feeds during thermal cracking of hydrocarbons to improve selectivity by suppressing hydrogenolysis or coke formation. Sulfur has been found to inhibit cracking reactions on metal catalysts. Its effect on catalytic propane dehydrogenation is typically studied through in situ sulfidation, mixture of H2S + O2, SO2, or S2. Adding H2S during uncatalyzed propane dehydrogenation can double the C3H6 yield, with selectivity improvements on catalysts like Pt/MgAl2O4. However, H2S can act as both an inhibitor and promoter, depending on its concentration in the feed. Exposure to sulfur feed can lead to the formation of metal sulfides, which modify the active phase of the catalyst, improving dehydrogenation performance. Catalyst precursors containing metal oxides, sulfides, or oxysulfides are activated with sulfur-containing compounds like S2, H2S, SO2, or COS. Utilizing sulfur vapor as an oxidant in the presence of other sulfur compounds can achieve high C3H6 yields at temperatures between 600°C and 950°C over catalysts like Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3. Lower metal-sulfur bond strengths decrease the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation, indicating a more active sulfur species.

对比硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯中的作用，我们发现硫化合物如H2S、S2和SO2可以提高丙烯产量。SO2作为利用SO2的有效氧化剂，但会产生COx产物，限制丙烯形成。S2作为一种“温和”的氧化剂，能减少ZrO2上的丙烷过氧化。抑制CS2等副产品的形成是设计高效催化剂的关键挑战。发展结构活性关系对于这一领域的合理催化剂设计至关重要。

通过铈O2、EuOX和CrPO4等催化剂的氧氯化反应，显示出与常规ODHP相比高选择性和转化率。然而，由于形成了COx和多卤化物产物，烯烃选择性受限。继续努力优化具有适度还原性的丙烷氧氯化催化剂，以防止烷基过氧化、燃烧和氯气的产生，同时确保快速去氢氯化动力学。

在硫基燃料的存在下，在热裂解碳氢化合物过程中添加硫化合物如DMDS和H2S作为共喂料来提高选择性，通过抑制氢解或焦炭形成。硫已被发现抑制金属催化剂上的裂解反应。硫对其催化丙烷脱氢的作用通常是在存在H2S的情况下进行原位硫化，混合H2S + O2或SO2，或S2。在未催化丙烷脱氢中添加H2S可以使C3H6产量翻倍，Pt/MgAl2O4催化剂上的选择性从47%显著提高至95%，而无需改变其活性。然而，H2S在高浓度（约850 ppm）下可能抑制转化并影响丙烯选择性，表明H2S在不同硫含量下的双重作用。暴露于硫燃料中后，金属氧化物可形成相应的金属硫化物（或表面硫化物），并报告提高了异丁烷脱氢产率，表明硫在修改催化剂活性相方面发挥关键作用。催化剂前体可能包含金属氧化物、硫化物或氧化硫化物，并且在存在一个或多个硫含物质如S2、H2S、SO2、COS的情况下激活。利用硫蒸汽作为氧化剂，在Fe2O3、MgO和Cr2O3等催化剂上，通过S2/H2S混合物激活，可以在600°C到950°C的温度范围内获得高C3H6产率。较低的金属-硫键强度降低了丙烯形成所需的显着活化壁垒，表明更活跃的硫物种。
