[1] "The CO2 reforming of methane (dry reforming) to produce synthesis gas, reaction (1), has gained renewed interest in recent years.
CH4  CO2 ! 2CO  2H2
(1)"

[2] "This reaction plays a potentially important role in the industry as well as the steam reforming reaction, especially due to the generation of synthesis gas with a low H2/CO ratio that can be preferentially used for the production of liquid hydrocarbons in the Fischer Tropsch synthesis network."

[3] "Due to its availability and low cost, nickel is the most appropriate catalyst for the reaction."

[4] "The dry reforming reaction is accompanied by several side reactions, of which the reverse watergas shift reaction (2), the methane cracking reaction (3) and the Boudouard reaction (4) appears to be the most important."
  
[5] "Nickel is the most appropriate catalyst for the reaction. However, the Ni-based catalysts are readily deactivated by the deposition of carbon on the active centers."

[6] "The effect of alkali promoters (Na, Li, K) on Ni/MgO was studied by Arena et al. [14], who reported that alkali promoters affect the reducibility, the morphology, the active surface area and the electronic properties of the catalyst."

[7] "The addition of Mn produced a noticeable reduction in carbon deposition, with a small decrease in catalytic activity."

[8] "Compared to the unmodified catalyst,only Co, Cu and Zr showed a slight improvement in activity, while the rest of the additives reduced the activity in dry reforming."

[9] "The unmodified catalyst showed its effectiveness in the dry reforming reaction of methane with low carbon deposition and high and constant catalytic activity during over 30 h of operation."

[10] "The introduction of 0.5 wt.% of the above mentioned metals showed, for the case of the K-modified catalyst, compared to the original catalyst, constant but slightly less activity, and a lower carbon deposition after the same operation period."

Comparing sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the literature indicates that sulfur-based oxidants may offer distinct advantages in terms of propylene yield, despite the specific challenges they pose. Challenges associated with each sulfur-based oxidant include byproduct formation, which can complicate the distillation and separation processes. The literature suggests that byproduct formation is a particular concern with H2S and S2, whereas SO2 may introduce sulfur compounds that require careful handling to avoid corrosion and environmental concerns.

Future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the ODHP process should focus on enhancing selectivity towards propylene, reducing byproduct formation, and mitigating the environmental impacts associated with sulfur-based oxidants. This might involve developing novel catalyst materials with improved sulfur tolerance, refining the reaction conditions to minimize byproducts, and exploring post-treatment techniques to remove or recycle unwanted sulfur compounds.

In summary, while sulfur-based oxidants can potentially boost propylene yield in ODHP, significant challenges remain in managing byproduct formation and environmental implications. Future work aims to refine catalyst design and operational strategies to maximize propylene production while minimizing adverse effects.

对比含硫氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）制丙烯过程中的应用，文献表明含硫氧化剂可能在提高丙烯产率方面具有独特优势，尽管它们带来了特定的挑战。含硫氧化剂相关的具体挑战包括副产品的形成，这会复杂化分馏和分离过程。文献指出，H2S和S2的副产品形成是特别关注的问题，而SO2可能引入的硫化合物需要仔细处理以避免腐蚀和环境问题。

未来的研究应集中在增强催化剂选择性、减少副产品形成以及缓解含硫氧化剂相关环境影响上，以优化ODHP过程。这可能涉及开发具有更好硫耐受性的新型催化剂材料、调整反应条件以最小化副产品的形成，以及探索后处理技术以去除或回收不希望的硫化合物。

简而言之，虽然含硫氧化剂可以潜在地提高ODHP过程中的丙烯产率，但仍存在管理副产品形成和环境影响的重大挑战。未来的工作旨在改进催化剂设计和操作策略，以最大化丙烯产量，同时尽量减少不利影响。
