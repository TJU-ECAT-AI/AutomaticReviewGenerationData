[1] "This reaction plays a potentially important role in the industry as well as the steam reforming reaction, especially due to the generation of synthesis gas with a low H2/CO ratio that can be preferentially used for the production of liquid hydrocarbons in the Fischer Tropsch synthesis network."
[2] "The dry reforming reaction is accompanied by several side reactions, of which the reverse watergas shift reaction (2), the methane cracking reaction (3) and the Boudouard reaction (4) appears to be the most important."
[3] "Small amounts of Ca increase the catalyst activity and stability. Ca improves Ni diffusion, strengthens Ni-Al2O3 interaction and delays Ni sintering."
[4] "In all cases, a metal charge of 0.5 wt.% was used. The impregnated samples were dried overnight at 110 °C and calcined in air at 850 °C for 12 h, as well as the unmodified catalyst."
[5] "Compared with the unmodified catalyst, it showed a slight activity decrease of less than 4% in methane conversion and more than 17% reduction in carbon deposition."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene can vary significantly. Each oxidant may face specific challenges and impact the propylene yield differently. For instance, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) might introduce sulfur compounds into the product, which could require additional purification steps. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) could lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts, complicating the process further. Sulfur trioxide (S2) might offer better selectivity but could also result in complex byproduct formation. Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design to minimize byproduct formation, enhance propylene yield, and improve the overall efficiency of the ODHP process. Key areas include developing more selective catalysts, understanding the reaction mechanisms at a molecular level, and refining process conditions to tailor the reaction towards propylene production.

在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯（ODHP）过程中，不同硫基氧化剂的有效性可能差异显著。每种氧化剂都可能面临特定挑战，并以不同的方式影响丙烯产率。例如，氢硫酸（H2S）可能会引入硫化合物到产品中，这可能需要额外的净化步骤。二氧化硫（SO2）可能导致形成难以处理的副产物，进一步复杂化过程。硫化二硫（S2）可能提供更好的选择性，但也可能导致复杂的副产品形成。未来的研究应集中在优化催化剂设计，以最小化副产品的形成、提高丙烯产率并提高整体过程效率。关键领域包括开发更选择性的催化剂、从分子水平上理解反应机制，并调整过程条件以针对丙烯生产定制反应。

Comparing sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the literature indicates that sulfur-based oxidants may offer distinct advantages in terms of propylene yield, despite the specific challenges they pose. Challenges associated with each sulfur-based oxidant include byproduct formation, which can complicate the distillation and separation processes. The literature suggests that byproduct formation is a particular concern with H2S and S2, whereas SO2 may introduce sulfur compounds that require careful handling to avoid corrosion and environmental concerns.

Future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the ODHP process should focus on enhancing selectivity towards propylene, reducing byproduct formation, and mitigating the environmental impacts associated with sulfur-based oxidants. This might involve developing novel catalyst materials with improved sulfur tolerance, refining the reaction conditions to minimize byproducts, and exploring post-treatment techniques to remove or recycle unwanted sulfur compounds.

In summary, while sulfur-based oxidants can potentially boost propylene yield in ODHP, significant challenges remain in managing byproduct formation and environmental implications. Future work aims to refine catalyst design and operational strategies to maximize propylene production while minimizing adverse effects.

对比含硫氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）制丙烯过程中的应用，文献表明含硫氧化剂可能在提高丙烯产率方面具有独特优势，尽管它们带来了特定的挑战。含硫氧化剂相关的具体挑战包括副产品的形成，这会复杂化分馏和分离过程。文献指出，H2S和S2的副产品形成是特别关注的问题，而SO2可能引入的硫化合物需要仔细处理以避免腐蚀和环境问题。

未来的研究应集中在增强催化剂选择性、减少副产品形成以及缓解含硫氧化剂相关环境影响上，以优化ODHP过程。这可能涉及开发具有更好硫耐受性的新型催化剂材料、调整反应条件以最小化副产品的形成，以及探索后处理技术以去除或回收不希望的硫化合物。

简而言之，虽然含硫氧化剂可以潜在地提高ODHP过程中的丙烯产率，但仍存在管理副产品形成和环境影响的重大挑战。未来的工作旨在改进催化剂设计和操作策略，以最大化丙烯产量，同时尽量减少不利影响。

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene varies significantly. Among the oxidants considered—H2S, S2, and SO2—each presents unique challenges and impacts on propylene yield. While H2S and S2 might offer advantages in terms of propylene yield due to their reactivity, they can also lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts such as hydrogen sulfide and elemental sulfur. On the other hand, SO2 requires higher temperatures and pressures for its effective use, which could increase operational costs. 

The literature suggests that sulfur-based oxidants generally face difficulties in achieving high propylene yields and maintaining selectivity over competing pathways, especially when compared to conventional oxidants like oxygen. The specific challenges include the formation of byproducts and the need for optimized reaction conditions to ensure efficient propylene formation. The literature also highlights the importance of catalyst design in overcoming these challenges, with the goal being to develop catalysts that can handle sulfur-based oxidants efficiently while minimizing byproduct formation and maximizing propylene yield.

Future research directions aim to improve catalyst design for sulfur-based oxidant processes. Key areas of focus include understanding the reaction mechanisms at the catalyst surface, optimizing the catalyst composition and structure to better interact with sulfur-based oxidants, and developing strategies to control byproduct formation. Additionally, enhancing the stability and longevity of catalysts under operating conditions, improving process efficiency, and exploring ways to integrate sulfur-based oxidants into existing industrial processes are critical for advancing the technology.

The introduction of potassium (K) as a modifier in the Ni-Al2O3 catalyst for the methane dry reforming process showed significant benefits. The K-modified catalyst demonstrated a slight decrease in methane conversion activity but maintained high stability in catalytic activity over a 30-hour operation period. This suggests that the incorporation of potassium hinders the accumulation of carbon on the catalyst surface, increases the reducibility, and modifies the metal-support interaction without altering the size or structure of the nickel particles. This finding highlights the potential of potassium as an effective modifier in improving the overall performance of the catalyst in the presence of sulfur-based oxidants, thus enhancing the efficiency of the ODHP process.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯过程中，不同硫基氧化剂的效果存在显著差异。考虑到H2S、S2和SO2等氧化剂，每种氧化剂都有其独特的挑战和对丙烯产率的影响。虽然H2S和S2可能在提高丙烯产率方面具有优势，由于它们的反应性，也可能导致不希望的副产品如硫化氢和单质硫的形成。另一方面，SO2需要更高的温度和压力才能有效使用，这可能会增加运营成本。

文献表明，硫基氧化剂通常难以实现高丙烯产率和维持选择性，与传统氧化剂（如氧气）相比尤其如此。特定的挑战包括形成副产品和确保高效丙烯形成的需要优化的操作条件。文献还强调了催化剂设计在克服这些挑战中的重要性，目标是开发能够高效处理硫基氧化剂的催化剂，同时最小化副产品形成并最大化丙烯产率。

未来研究方向旨在改进硫基氧化剂过程的催化剂设计。重点关注的领域包括理解催化剂表面的反应机制，优化催化剂组成和结构以更好地与硫基氧化剂相互作用，并开发控制副产品形成的方法。此外，增强催化剂在操作条件下的稳定性和持久性、提高过程效率以及探索将硫基氧化剂集成到现有工业流程中的方式对于推动该技术的发展至关重要。

钾（K）引入Ni-Al2O3催化剂中作为改性剂，在甲烷干重整过程中显示出了显著的优势。K改性催化剂表现出轻微降低甲烷转化活性但保持了催化活性的高稳定性长达30小时运行周期。这表明钾的引入可以抑制催化剂表面上碳的积累，提高还原性，并修改金属-支撑相互作用，而无需改变镍颗粒的大小或结构。这一发现突显了钾作为有效改性剂的潜力，在硫基氧化剂的存在下提高催化剂的整体性能，从而增强ODHP过程的效率。
