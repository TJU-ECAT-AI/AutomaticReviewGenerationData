The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene varies significantly. Among the oxidants considered—H2S, S2, and SO2—each presents unique challenges and impacts on propylene yield. While H2S and S2 might offer advantages in terms of propylene yield due to their reactivity, they can also lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts such as hydrogen sulfide and elemental sulfur. On the other hand, SO2 requires higher temperatures and pressures for its effective use, which could increase operational costs. 

The literature suggests that sulfur-based oxidants generally face difficulties in achieving high propylene yields and maintaining selectivity over competing pathways, especially when compared to conventional oxidants like oxygen. The specific challenges include the formation of byproducts and the need for optimized reaction conditions to ensure efficient propylene formation. The literature also highlights the importance of catalyst design in overcoming these challenges, with the goal being to develop catalysts that can handle sulfur-based oxidants efficiently while minimizing byproduct formation and maximizing propylene yield.

Future research directions aim to improve catalyst design for sulfur-based oxidant processes. Key areas of focus include understanding the reaction mechanisms at the catalyst surface, optimizing the catalyst composition and structure to better interact with sulfur-based oxidants, and developing strategies to control byproduct formation. Additionally, enhancing the stability and longevity of catalysts under operating conditions, improving process efficiency, and exploring ways to integrate sulfur-based oxidants into existing industrial processes are critical for advancing the technology.

The introduction of potassium (K) as a modifier in the Ni-Al2O3 catalyst for the methane dry reforming process showed significant benefits. The K-modified catalyst demonstrated a slight decrease in methane conversion activity but maintained high stability in catalytic activity over a 30-hour operation period. This suggests that the incorporation of potassium hinders the accumulation of carbon on the catalyst surface, increases the reducibility, and modifies the metal-support interaction without altering the size or structure of the nickel particles. This finding highlights the potential of potassium as an effective modifier in improving the overall performance of the catalyst in the presence of sulfur-based oxidants, thus enhancing the efficiency of the ODHP process.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯过程中，不同硫基氧化剂的效果存在显著差异。考虑到H2S、S2和SO2等氧化剂，每种氧化剂都有其独特的挑战和对丙烯产率的影响。虽然H2S和S2可能在提高丙烯产率方面具有优势，由于它们的反应性，也可能导致不希望的副产品如硫化氢和单质硫的形成。另一方面，SO2需要更高的温度和压力才能有效使用，这可能会增加运营成本。

文献表明，硫基氧化剂通常难以实现高丙烯产率和维持选择性，与传统氧化剂（如氧气）相比尤其如此。特定的挑战包括形成副产品和确保高效丙烯形成的需要优化的操作条件。文献还强调了催化剂设计在克服这些挑战中的重要性，目标是开发能够高效处理硫基氧化剂的催化剂，同时最小化副产品形成并最大化丙烯产率。

未来研究方向旨在改进硫基氧化剂过程的催化剂设计。重点关注的领域包括理解催化剂表面的反应机制，优化催化剂组成和结构以更好地与硫基氧化剂相互作用，并开发控制副产品形成的方法。此外，增强催化剂在操作条件下的稳定性和持久性、提高过程效率以及探索将硫基氧化剂集成到现有工业流程中的方式对于推动该技术的发展至关重要。

钾（K）引入Ni-Al2O3催化剂中作为改性剂，在甲烷干重整过程中显示出了显著的优势。K改性催化剂表现出轻微降低甲烷转化活性但保持了催化活性的高稳定性长达30小时运行周期。这表明钾的引入可以抑制催化剂表面上碳的积累，提高还原性，并修改金属-支撑相互作用，而无需改变镍颗粒的大小或结构。这一发现突显了钾作为有效改性剂的潜力，在硫基氧化剂的存在下提高催化剂的整体性能，从而增强ODHP过程的效率。
