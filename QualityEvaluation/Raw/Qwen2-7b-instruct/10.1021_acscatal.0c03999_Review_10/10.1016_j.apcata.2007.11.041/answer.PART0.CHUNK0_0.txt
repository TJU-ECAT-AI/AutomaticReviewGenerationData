[1] "This reaction plays a potentially important role in the industry as well as the steam reforming reaction, especially due to the generation of synthesis gas with a low H2/CO ratio that can be preferentially used for the production of liquid hydrocarbons in the Fischer Tropsch synthesis network."
[2] "The dry reforming reaction is accompanied by several side reactions, of which the reverse watergas shift reaction (2), the methane cracking reaction (3) and the Boudouard reaction (4) appears to be the most important."
[3] "Small amounts of Ca increase the catalyst activity and stability. Ca improves Ni diffusion, strengthens Ni-Al2O3 interaction and delays Ni sintering."
[4] "In all cases, a metal charge of 0.5 wt.% was used. The impregnated samples were dried overnight at 110 °C and calcined in air at 850 °C for 12 h, as well as the unmodified catalyst."
[5] "Compared with the unmodified catalyst, it showed a slight activity decrease of less than 4% in methane conversion and more than 17% reduction in carbon deposition."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene can vary significantly. Each oxidant may face specific challenges and impact the propylene yield differently. For instance, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) might introduce sulfur compounds into the product, which could require additional purification steps. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) could lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts, complicating the process further. Sulfur trioxide (S2) might offer better selectivity but could also result in complex byproduct formation. Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design to minimize byproduct formation, enhance propylene yield, and improve the overall efficiency of the ODHP process. Key areas include developing more selective catalysts, understanding the reaction mechanisms at a molecular level, and refining process conditions to tailor the reaction towards propylene production.

在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯（ODHP）过程中，不同硫基氧化剂的有效性可能差异显著。每种氧化剂都可能面临特定挑战，并以不同的方式影响丙烯产率。例如，氢硫酸（H2S）可能会引入硫化合物到产品中，这可能需要额外的净化步骤。二氧化硫（SO2）可能导致形成难以处理的副产物，进一步复杂化过程。硫化二硫（S2）可能提供更好的选择性，但也可能导致复杂的副产品形成。未来的研究应集中在优化催化剂设计，以最小化副产品的形成、提高丙烯产率并提高整体过程效率。关键领域包括开发更选择性的催化剂、从分子水平上理解反应机制，并调整过程条件以针对丙烯生产定制反应。
