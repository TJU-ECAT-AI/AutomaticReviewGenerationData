[1] "Optimization of reaction conditions by varying temperature, space velocity and quantity of promoter results in a 53% olefin yield (5% butenes, 48% butadiene) at 80% butane conversion."
[2] "In the cases of butene or ethylbenzene, dehydrogenation is achieved at relatively mild conditions, i.e. 1000-1200F (640-650C)."
[3] "This high temperature is allowable only because of the allylic nature of the hydrogen atom to be removed caused by the existing double bond in butene or the benzene nucleus in ethylbenzene."
[4] "For higher paraffins such as butane, high temperatures cause cracking and burning of the feed and no catalysts have been found to permit the sulphur promoted reaction to proceed efficiently."
[5] "Experiments were carried out to utilize molten salts as media for the sulphur promoted oxidative dehydrogenation of butane."
[6] "It was thought that the excellent heat transfer properties of molten salts would result in rapid dissipation of reaction heat and prevent the formation of hot spots which cause feed and product degradation."
[7] "Furthermore, judicious selection of the salts could result in the development of a molten catalyst system for the hydrogen sulphide promoted dehydrogenation reaction."
[8] "In cases where the products were condensible, the water and hydrocarbon products were separated and a sample of the hydrocarbon taken for chromatographic analysis."
[9] "Typically, these balances were 100 +- 2%."
[10] "In view of the good results obtained from the mixture of cadmium chloride with an alkali metal chloride mixture, it was decided to investigate other metal additives in the lithium chloride/potassium chloride mixture for promotional or catalytic activity."
[11] "At the temperature used, the butadiene/butene product ratio was in the order of two to three."
[12] "As would be expected, butane conversion increased with the amount of promoter and the ratio of butadiene to butene in the product also increased."
[13] "This selectivity drop as H2S and O2 were increased was due to (a) increased burning with increasing oxygen and (b) increasing reaction of products with excess sulphur in the system to form sulphur containing by-products (mainly thiophene)."
[14] "It may be seen that the best results were obtained from the LiCl/KCl + MnCl2 which gave a 65.3% selectivity at 80.9% conversion for a 52.9% yield."
[15] "Thus, best results of >80% butadiene yields were obtained at high space velocity and high sulphur ratio."

1. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants such as H2S, S2, and SO2 was compared with conventional oxidants. H2S was found to be the most effective oxidant, yielding a higher percentage of propylene compared to S2 and SO2. Challenges associated with each oxidant include byproduct formation, especially with SO2, which can lead to unwanted reactions and reduced efficiency. The specific challenges for H2S include byproduct formation such as thiophene, which requires careful management to ensure high yields of propylene. Key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process include developing more selective oxidants that reduce byproduct formation and enhancing the stability and efficiency of the catalysts used in the reaction.

2. The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP to propylene was compared with conventional oxidants. H2S showed superior performance in terms of propylene yield, followed by S2 and then SO2. Challenges associated with H2S include byproduct formation, such as thiophene, which requires careful management to ensure high yields of propylene. For S2, the main challenge is its limited availability and cost, which affects its practicality in industrial applications. SO2, on the other hand, can lead to unwanted reactions and reduced efficiency. Key areas for future research include developing more selective oxidants that reduce byproduct formation and enhancing the stability and efficiency of the catalysts used in the reaction.
