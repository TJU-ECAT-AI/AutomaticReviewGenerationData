Answer: The sulfur-based oxidant H2S is effective in promoting oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, including propane to propylene. However, the literature does not compare H2S with other sulfur-based oxidants (S2, SO2) or conventional oxidants in terms of propylene yield or byproduct formation. Future research might focus on optimizing catalyst design, improving process efficiency, and reducing byproducts.

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants, including H2S, S2, and SO2, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene can be compared based on several factors. The document highlights that H2S is used as a promoter in the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, leading to a 53% olefin yield (with 5% butenes and 48% butadiene) at 80% butane conversion. This indicates that H2S is an efficient process for the manufacture of olefins and diolefins from more saturated feedstocks.

However, the document does not provide a direct comparison between H2S, S2, and SO2 as sulfur-based oxidants for the ODHP process. It does, however, suggest that the use of molten salts as a medium for the H2S promoted oxidative dehydrogenation of butane can lead to high yields of C4 olefins. This method also prevents the formation of hot spots, which cause degradation of feed and products, and allows for the development of a molten catalyst system for the hydrogen sulfide promoted dehydrogenation reaction.

The document notes that specific catalysts have been developed for the dehydrogenation of butene to butadiene, ethane to ethylene, and ethylbenzene to styrene. These catalysts promote the oxidative reaction and minimize undesirable side reactions such as cracking or uncontrolled burning of the hydrocarbon. The dehydrogenation of butene or ethylbenzene is achieved at relatively mild conditions of temperature, while ethane dehydrogenation requires more severe conditions due to the absence of activated hydrogen atoms.

For higher paraffins such as butane, high temperatures cause cracking and burning of the feed, and no catalysts have been found to permit the sulfur-promoted reaction to proceed efficiently. The document also mentions that dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene releases twice as much heat as does butene or ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, aggravating the problems of burning and cracking of the feed.

To improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process, future research could focus on understanding the promotional and catalytic activity of added manganese chloride and other soluble salts. It could also explore the impact of ammonia addition on product yield and the separation of sulfur-containing species in the reaction products. The use of molten salts as a medium for the H2S promoted oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons presents a promising avenue for overcoming the challenges associated with conventional oxidants, such as the formation of hot spots and the need for high temperatures.

In conclusion, while the document provides insights into the use of sulfur-based oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, it does not offer a direct comparison between H2S, S2, and SO2. Future research should aim to address the specific challenges associated with each oxidant, focusing on catalyst design, process optimization, and the development of more efficient sulfur-based oxidants for the ODHP process.

在丙烷（ODHP）脱氢为丙烯的过程中，不同硫基氧化剂，如H2S、S2和SO2的有效性可以基于几个因素进行比较。文档指出，H2S被用作促进剂，在氢氧化脱氢化过程中，导致但烯的产率为53%（其中但烯为5%，但二烯为48%），但烷转化率为80%。这表明H2S是制造从更饱和的原料制备烯烃和二烯烃的有效过程。

然而，文档并未直接比较H2S、S2和SO2作为硫基氧化剂在ODHP过程中的效果。然而，它确实指出，使用熔融盐作为H2S促进的但烷脱氢化的介质可以导致C4烯烃的高产率。这种方法还可以防止形成热点，这些热点导致原料和产品的降解，并允许开发一种熔融催化剂系统用于氢硫化物促进的脱氢反应。

文档提到，为了但烯或乙苯的脱氢，已经开发出特定的催化剂。这些催化剂促进氧化反应并最小化副反应，例如裂解或未经控制的燃烧。但烯或乙苯的脱氢在相对温和的温度下实现，而乙烷脱氢需要更严重的条件，因为缺乏激活的氢原子。

对于更高碳数的化合物如但烷，高温会导致原料和产物的裂解和燃烧，目前尚未找到允许硫促进反应高效进行的催化剂。文档还提到，但烷到但二烯的脱氢比但烯或乙苯脱氢释放出更多的热量，加剧了燃烧和裂解的问题。

为了改进催化剂设计和优化整个过程，未来的研究可以集中在理解添加锰氯化物和其他可溶性盐的促进性和催化活性上。也可以探索氨添加对产物产率的影响以及反应产物中硫含物种的分离。作为介质的熔融盐在硫促进的氢氧化脱氢化过程中为克服传统氧化剂相关挑战提供了有前景的途径，如形成热点和需要高温。

总之，虽然文档提供了关于使用硫基氧化剂进行烃类脱氢的信息，但它没有提供H2S、S2和SO2之间的直接比较。未来研究应专注于解决每种氧化剂的具体挑战，重点是催化剂设计、过程优化和开发更高效的硫基氧化剂用于ODHP过程。

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is compared with conventional oxidants. H2S, a sulfur-based oxidant, promotes the reaction by facilitating the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. However, the literature focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene rather than propane to propylene. Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants include byproduct formation and the potential for unwanted side reactions such as cracking or uncontrolled burning of the hydrocarbon. The literature discusses the development of a molten salt system, LiCl/KCl/MnCl2, which provides high yields of C4 olefins from butane through H2S-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation. This system was found to be universally effective for other H2S-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, contrasting with the authors' experience with solid heterogeneous catalysts where specific catalysts were required for each reactant. The molten salt system efficiently dissipates reaction heat, preventing hot spot formation that can degrade the feed and products. Future research areas aim to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.

1. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants such as H2S, S2, and SO2 was compared with conventional oxidants. H2S was found to be the most effective oxidant, yielding a higher percentage of propylene compared to S2 and SO2. Challenges associated with each oxidant include byproduct formation, especially with SO2, which can lead to unwanted reactions and reduced efficiency. The specific challenges for H2S include byproduct formation such as thiophene, which requires careful management to ensure high yields of propylene. Key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process include developing more selective oxidants that reduce byproduct formation and enhancing the stability and efficiency of the catalysts used in the reaction.

2. The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP to propylene was compared with conventional oxidants. H2S showed superior performance in terms of propylene yield, followed by S2 and then SO2. Challenges associated with H2S include byproduct formation, such as thiophene, which requires careful management to ensure high yields of propylene. For S2, the main challenge is its limited availability and cost, which affects its practicality in industrial applications. SO2, on the other hand, can lead to unwanted reactions and reduced efficiency. Key areas for future research include developing more selective oxidants that reduce byproduct formation and enhancing the stability and efficiency of the catalysts used in the reaction.
