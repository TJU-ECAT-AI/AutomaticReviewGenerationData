[1] "The reaction is catalyzed by the addition of soluble salts such at TI,O,, BaCl, or MnC1,"
[2] "Optimization of reaction conditions by varying temperature, space velocity and quantity o f promoter results in a 53% olefin yield (5% butenes, 48% butadiene) at 80% butane conversion."
[3] "For higher paraffins such as butane, high temperatures cause cracking and burning of the feed and no catalysts have been found to permit the sulphur promoted reaction to proceed efficiently."
[4] "A molten salt system, LiC1/KC1/MnC12, has been defined which gives high yields of C ,olefins from butane by hydrogen sulphide promoted oxidative dehydrogenation."
[5] "This system was found to be universally effective for other HPS promoted oxidative dehydrogenation reactions,"

1. The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is discussed. H2S is the primary oxidant used, but S2 and SO2 are also mentioned. Challenges associated with each oxidant include byproduct formation, and the key areas for future research aim to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.
2. The LiCl/KCl/MnCl2 molten salt system proved to be universally effective for ODHP reactions, differing from the experience with solid heterogeneous catalysts where specific catalysts were required for each reactant.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯的过程中，硫基氧化剂的有效性进行了讨论。主要使用H2S作为氧化剂，但还提到了S2和SO2。每种氧化剂面临的挑战包括副产物形成，未来研究的关键领域旨在改进催化剂设计并优化整个过程。
2. LiCl/KCl/MnCl2熔融盐系统被证明对ODHP反应具有普遍有效性，这与使用固体异质催化剂的经验不同，在后者中，每个反应物都需要特定的催化剂。
