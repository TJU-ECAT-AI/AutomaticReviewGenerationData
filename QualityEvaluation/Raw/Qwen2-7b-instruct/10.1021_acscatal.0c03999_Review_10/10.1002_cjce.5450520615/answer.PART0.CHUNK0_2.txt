[I n an effort to overcome these problems, experi- ments were carried out to utilize molten salts as media for the sulphur promoted oxidative dehydrogenation of butane.]
[Oxidative dehydrogenation has been carried out in molten salts by Phillips Petroleum Co. on C4 and higher paraffins, but in their work an unpromoted system was used and very low yields of olefinic products were obtained.]
[It was thought that the excellent heat transfer properties of molten salts would result in rapid dissipation of reaction heat and prevent the formation of hot spots which cause feed and product degradation.]
[In view of the good results obtained from the mix- ture of cadmium chloride with an alkali metal chloride mixture, it was decided to investigate other metal additives in the lithium chloride/potassium chloride mixture for promotional or catalytic activity.]
[The best melts from the screening program - LiCl/KCl alone and promoted with MnCL and BaCL - were therefore tested at this higher H2S level with the results shown in Table 5.]

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is compared with conventional oxidants. H2S, a sulfur-based oxidant, promotes the reaction by facilitating the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. However, the literature focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene rather than propane to propylene. Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants include byproduct formation and the potential for unwanted side reactions such as cracking or uncontrolled burning of the hydrocarbon. The literature discusses the development of a molten salt system, LiCl/KCl/MnCl2, which provides high yields of C4 olefins from butane through H2S-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation. This system was found to be universally effective for other H2S-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, contrasting with the authors' experience with solid heterogeneous catalysts where specific catalysts were required for each reactant. The molten salt system efficiently dissipates reaction heat, preventing hot spot formation that can degrade the feed and products. Future research areas aim to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.

The molten salt system, LiCl/KCl/MnCl2, has been defined for high yields of C4 olefins from butane through H2S-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation. This system was found to be universally effective for other H2S-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The molten salt medium efficiently dissipates reaction heat, preventing hot spot formation that can degrade the feed and products. The literature does not directly address the specific challenges associated with H2S, S2, and SO2 as oxidants in ODHP to propylene, but it does highlight the advantages of using molten salts over conventional methods in terms of heat dissipation and reaction control.

硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）在丙烷（ODHP）脱氢为丙烯中的有效性与传统氧化剂进行了比较。H2S作为硫基氧化剂，通过促进丙烷脱氢为丙烯来促进反应。然而，文献主要关注的是丁烷到丁二烯的氧化脱氢，而不是丙烷到丙烯的转化。硫基氧化剂面临的挑战包括副产品的形成以及可能的烃类裂解或失控燃烧等副作用。文献讨论了LiCl/KCl/MnCl2熔融盐系统的开发，该系统能够从丁烷提供高产率的C4烯烃通过H2S促动的氧化脱氢。该系统被发现对于其他H2S促动的氧化脱氢反应是普遍有效的，与作者使用固体异质催化剂的经验形成对比，在后者的特定催化剂用于每个反应物。熔融盐介质能够有效地散发反应热，防止形成导致原料和产物降解的热点。未来的研究领域旨在改进催化剂设计并优化整体过程。
