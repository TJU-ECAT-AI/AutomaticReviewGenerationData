Answer: The sulfur-based oxidant H2S is effective in promoting oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, including propane to propylene. However, the literature does not compare H2S with other sulfur-based oxidants (S2, SO2) or conventional oxidants in terms of propylene yield or byproduct formation. Future research might focus on optimizing catalyst design, improving process efficiency, and reducing byproducts.

硫化氢（H2S）在促进丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的过程中表现出高效性。然而，文献中并未将H2S与其他基于硫的氧化剂（S2、SO2）或传统氧化剂进行比较，以评估丙烯产率和副产物形成情况。未来的研究可能集中在催化剂设计的优化、提高工艺效率以及减少副产物方面。
