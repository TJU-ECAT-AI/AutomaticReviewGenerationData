Different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) have been studied in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). These oxidants resulted in higher propene yields compared to conventional oxidants. However, they also led to the formation of unwanted byproducts. For example, H2S formation could affect catalyst stability, while S2 might cause sulfur compound production inhibiting the reaction. SO2 can produce sulfuric acid, potentially damaging the catalyst. Future research aims to improve catalyst design to minimize byproduct formation and optimize reaction conditions to enhance propene yield while reducing byproducts.

不同的硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2、SO2）已经在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中进行了研究。这些氧化剂导致了与传统氧化剂相比更高的丙烯产率。然而，它们也带来了副产品的形成。例如，H2S的产生可能会影响催化剂稳定性，而S2可能导致抑制反应的硫化物产物的产生。SO2可以产生硫酸，这可能损害催化剂。未来的研究旨在改进催化剂设计以减少副产品的形成，并优化反应条件以提高丙烯产率并减少副产品的生成。
