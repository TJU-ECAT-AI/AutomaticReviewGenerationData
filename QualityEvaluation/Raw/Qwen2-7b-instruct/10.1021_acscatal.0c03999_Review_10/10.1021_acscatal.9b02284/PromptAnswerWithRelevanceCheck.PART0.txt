[1] "In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of various sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene."
[2] "The results showed that the use of sulfur-based oxidants significantly improved the selectivity and efficiency of the ODHP process."
[3] "However, the presence of byproducts was also observed, which varied depending on the specific oxidant used."
[4] "Among the sulfur-based oxidants tested, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) produced the highest propylene yield, followed by disulfide (S2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2)."
[5] "The challenge with using H2S as an oxidant lies in its high reactivity, leading to potential over-oxidation and the formation of undesirable byproducts."
[6] "Disulfide (S2) exhibited lower reactivity compared to H2S, resulting in fewer byproducts but a slightly lower propylene yield."
[7] "Sulfur dioxide (SO2) was found to have the least reactivity among the sulfur-based oxidants, offering a balance between propylene yield and byproduct formation."
[8] "Future research efforts should focus on optimizing catalyst design to enhance selectivity and reduce byproduct formation."
[9] "Additionally, exploring alternative oxidants and synergistic combinations could lead to more efficient and environmentally friendly ODHP processes."
