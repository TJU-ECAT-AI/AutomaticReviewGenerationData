The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was compared with conventional oxidants. These sulfur-based oxidants were found to be effective, offering higher propylene yields than conventional oxidants. However, they also resulted in the formation of specific byproducts, such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur, which could negatively impact process efficiency and selectivity. Future research focuses on optimizing catalyst design to minimize byproduct formation and enhance propylene yield. Efforts are also directed towards developing more environmentally friendly and sustainable sulfur-based oxidants.

在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）中，不同类型的硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2、SO2）与常规氧化剂相比，其效果进行了比较。这些硫基氧化剂被发现是有效的，提供的丙烯产量高于常规氧化剂。然而，它们也导致了特定副产品的形成，如硫化氢和硫，这可能会影响过程的效率和选择性。未来的研究集中在优化催化剂设计以减少副产品形成并提高丙烯产量。此外，研究也可能集中在开发更环保和可持续的硫基氧化剂上。
