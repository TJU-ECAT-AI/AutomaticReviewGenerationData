Different sulfur-based oxidants, including hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), have been studied for their effects on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene. These oxidants notably impact propylene yield but also introduce challenges through the formation of byproducts, which can decrease process efficiency. Future studies should concentrate on enhancing catalyst design and refining the ODHP process to mitigate these issues.
