[1] "In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of various sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene."
[2] "The results showed that the use of sulfur-based oxidants significantly improved the selectivity and efficiency of the ODHP process."
[3] "However, the presence of byproducts was also observed, which varied depending on the specific oxidant used."
[4] "Among the sulfur-based oxidants tested, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) produced the highest propylene yield, followed by disulfide (S2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2)."
[5] "The challenge with using H2S as an oxidant lies in its high reactivity, leading to potential over-oxidation and the formation of undesirable byproducts."
[6] "Disulfide (S2) exhibited lower reactivity compared to H2S, resulting in fewer byproducts but a slightly lower propylene yield."
[7] "Sulfur dioxide (SO2) was found to have the least reactivity among the sulfur-based oxidants, offering a balance between propylene yield and byproduct formation."
[8] "Future research efforts should focus on optimizing catalyst design to enhance selectivity and reduce byproduct formation."
[9] "Additionally, exploring alternative oxidants and synergistic combinations could lead to more efficient and environmentally friendly ODHP processes."

1. This study aimed to examine the effects of various sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, finding that sulfur-based oxidants notably improved the process's selectivity and efficiency.
2. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) generated the highest propylene yield among the sulfur-based oxidants tested, outperforming disulfide (S2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2).
3. The use of H2S as an oxidant presents challenges due to its high reactivity, potentially leading to over-oxidation and the formation of unwanted byproducts.
4. Disulfide (S2) had lower reactivity than H2S, resulting in less byproduct formation but a slightly lower propylene yield.
5. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) displayed the least reactivity among the sulfur-based oxidants, offering a favorable balance between propylene yield and byproduct formation.
6. Future research should concentrate on refining catalyst design to boost selectivity and minimize byproduct generation.
7. Investigating alternative oxidants and synergistic combinations could pave the way for more efficient and environmentally sustainable oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
