Comparing sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is found to offer substantial selectivity advantages. This is primarily due to a significantly lower propensity for combustion and a lack of direct incorporation of heteroatoms into the feed molecule. The presence of sulfur dioxide enables a more controlled oxidation process, leading to higher propylene yields compared to conventional oxidants. Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants include byproduct formation, particularly when sulfur dioxide reacts with other components in the feed or the catalyst surface, potentially leading to unwanted products such as sulfur compounds or carbon compounds. For future research, key areas of focus should include optimizing catalyst design to enhance the selectivity towards propylene while minimizing byproduct formation. Additionally, developing methods to efficiently regenerate the catalysts, especially to combat the accumulation of coke, which reduces activity over time, is crucial. The role of the sulfur dioxide in the reaction mechanism, whether it is directly involved in hydrogen abstraction or indirectly through surface modifications, is also an area requiring further investigation to fully understand the catalytic process.

对比硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯（ODHP）过程中的应用，发现二氧化硫（SO2）提供了显著的选择性优势。这主要归因于其较低的燃烧倾向和不直接将杂原子引入到原料分子中。二氧化硫的存在使得氧化过程更加可控，从而能够获得比传统氧化剂更高的丙烯产率。硫基氧化剂相关的挑战包括产物形成，特别是当二氧化硫与原料或催化剂表面的其他成分反应时，可能会产生不需要的产品，如硫化合物或碳化合物。未来研究的关键领域应集中在优化催化剂设计以增强丙烯选择性的同时减少副产品的生成。此外，开发有效再生催化剂的方法，尤其是应对催化剂活性随时间下降而积累的焦炭积累，对于提高效率至关重要。需要进一步研究二氧化硫在反应机制中的作用，无论是直接参与氢原子抽取还是通过表面修饰间接作用，以完全理解催化过程。
