[1] "In the tables of this paper, not all of the minor products are listed. This accounts for the discrepancy in the total conversion."
[2] "When these data indicated that the steady state condition of the catalyst is the sulfide form, a portion was pretreated with H2S for 2 hr at 500C."
[3] "The thermodynamics of reaction (1) are favorable at about 300C and higher."
[4] "The main feature preventing high conversion to olefin is the further reaction to thiophene."
[5] "The sulfur dioxide oxidation system offers substantial selectivity advantages over the oxygen system."
[6] "The nature of the catalyst surface is not known, but in a number of cases it would appear to be predominantly in the sulfide form."

1. In the tables of the paper, not all minor products are listed, which might explain the difference in total conversion figures.
2. The catalyst was treated with H2S at 500°C for 2 hours after the data showed that the steady state of the catalyst was in the sulfide form.
3. The thermodynamics of reaction (1) are favorable at temperatures around 300°C and above.
4. The main obstacle to achieving high conversion of paraffins to olefins is the quick conversion of dienes to thiophenes.
5. The sulfur dioxide oxidation system provides significant selectivity benefits compared to the oxygen system.
6. The exact nature of the catalyst surface is unknown, but in many cases, it seems to predominantly exist in the sulfide form.

1. 在该论文的表格中，并非所有次要产物都被列出，这可能是导致总转化率差异的原因。
2. 数据显示催化剂处于硫化状态时，部分催化剂在500°C下用H2S处理了2小时。
3. 反应（1）的热力学在约300°C及更高温度下有利。
4. 阻碍高转化率的主因是双烯快速转化为噻吩。
5. 硫氧化物氧化系统相比氧气系统提供了显著的选择性优势。
6. 催化剂表面的确切性质未知，但在许多情况下，其主要形式似乎是硫化态。
