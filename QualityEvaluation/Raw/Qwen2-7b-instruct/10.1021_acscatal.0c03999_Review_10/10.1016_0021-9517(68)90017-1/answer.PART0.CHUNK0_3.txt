[1] "When cyclization to thiophenes or aromatics is possible, large yields of olefins or dienes cannot be obtained from paraffins."
[2] "Mesityl oxide is cyclized to 2,4-dimethylfuran quite well but no furan is made from crotonaldehyde."
[3] "The catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons is quite successful with a number of materials, such as ethylene, propylene, butylene,benzene, and alkyl aromatics, but there are a number of systems, which include desired products as well as desired feeds, where the selectivity of the reaction is either low or practically nonexistent."
[4] "The use of sulfur dioxide instead of oxygen results in a selectivity increase of about 5%."
[5] "In our screening work here we have been more concerned with selectivity at a given conversion and have not investigated activity stability for all the catalysts examined."

1. The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is compared with conventional oxidants. While sulfur dioxide (SO2) offers substantial selectivity advantages over oxygen, the specifics of its impact on propylene yield and the challenges associated with each oxidant, including byproduct formation, are discussed. Future research focuses on improving catalyst design and optimizing the overall process.

2. Challenges in the ODHP process include low propylene yields from paraffins when cyclization to thiophenes or aromatics is possible. For instance, mesityl oxide cyclizes to 2,4-dimethylfuran efficiently but does not produce furan from crotonaldehyde. 

3. The oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is successful with various materials, including ethylene, propylene, butylene, benzene, and alkyl aromatics. However, the selectivity of the reaction varies across different systems, often being low or nonexistent. 

4. Using sulfur dioxide (SO2) as the oxidant in the ODHP process results in a slight increase of about 5% in selectivity compared to using oxygen. 

5. The research conducted has prioritized understanding the selectivity of reactions at a given conversion level, rather than examining the stability of activity across all catalysts used in the study.

1. 在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）到丙烯的过程中，硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂的效果进行比较。虽然二氧化硫（SO2）在选择性方面提供了显著的优势，但对其对丙烯产率的影响以及每种氧化剂的具体挑战，包括副产品的形成，进行了讨论。未来的研究集中在改进催化剂设计和优化整个过程。

2. ODHP过程中的挑战包括当环化生成噻吩或芳香族化合物时，从烷烃中获得低丙烯产量。例如，mesityl氧化物高效地环化生成2,4-二甲基呋喃，但不能从crotonaldehyde生成呋喃。

3. 氧化脱氢烷烃在乙烯、丙烯、丁烯、苯和烷基芳烃等多种材料上是成功的。然而，反应的选择性在不同的系统中各不相同，经常表现为较低甚至不存在。

4. 将二氧化硫（SO2）作为氧化剂在ODHP过程中使用，相对于使用氧气，其选择性增加了大约5%。

5. 进行的研究已经优先考虑在给定转化率下反应的选择性，而不是检查所有在研究中使用的催化剂的活性稳定性。
