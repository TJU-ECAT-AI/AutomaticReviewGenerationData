[1] "When cyclization to thiophenes or aromatics is possible, large yields of olefins or dienes cannot be obtained from paraffins."
[2] "As an example, consider the oxidation over bismuth molybdate of 2-butene and 2-methyl-2-butene (9). Production of butadiene from butylene is a very clean reaction, while the selectivity of oxidation of isoamylene to isoprene is low, especially at high conversion levels."
[3] "We have screened 60 catalysts for the oxygen oxidation of isoamylene."
[4] "The thermodynamics of reaction (1) are favorable at about 300C and higher."
[5] "The main products were carbon monoxide and propylene."
[6] "Very little dimethylthiophene was formed: the selectivity to this material was only l-27$ at 500-600C."

1. Cyclization reactions do not allow for high yields of olefins or dienes from paraffins, as the formation of thiophenes or aromatics competes against these products.
2. The oxidation of 2-butene and 2-methyl-2-butene over bismuth molybdate produces butadiene efficiently, but the selectivity for the oxidation of isoamylene to isoprene is low, particularly at high conversion levels.
3. Sixty catalysts have been screened for the oxygen oxidation of isoamylene.
4. The thermodynamic conditions for reaction (1) are favorable at temperatures around 300°C and above.
5. The oxidative cyclization of crotonaldehyde to furan with sulfur dioxide as an oxidant resulted in the formation of carbon monoxide and propylene.
6. Using sulfur dioxide as an oxidant for the oxidation of mesityl oxide led to a slight increase in the selectivity to 2,4-dimethylfuran, but the formation of dimethylthiophene was minimal.

1. 当环化反应有可能时，烷烃无法获得高产率的烯烃或二烯烃，因为生成噻吩或芳香族化合物与这些产物的竞争。
2. 在使用铋钼酸盐氧化2-丁烯和2-甲基-2-丁烯时，可以高效地生产丁二烯，而异丙烯的氧化选择性在高转化率下很低。
3. 已经筛选了60种催化剂用于异丙烯的氧气氧化。
4. 反应（1）的热力学条件在约300°C及更高温度下有利。
5. 使用硫化二氧碳作为氧化剂进行环己酮醛的氧化，产生了二氧化碳和丙烯。
6. 使用二氧化硫作为氧化剂氧化甲基苯基醚的结果是2,4-二甲基噻吩的选择性略有提高，但二甲基噻吩的形成很少。
