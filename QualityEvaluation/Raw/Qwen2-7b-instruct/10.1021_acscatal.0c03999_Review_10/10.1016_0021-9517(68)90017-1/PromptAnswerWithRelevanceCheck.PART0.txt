Comparing and contrasting sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the sulfur dioxide (SO2) system demonstrates several advantages and disadvantages. 

SO2 enables the reaction to be endothermic, offering a unique opportunity for process design, particularly when dealing with reactions that require heat input. The system is less prone to combustion and avoids the introduction of heteroatoms into the feed molecule, which can be advantageous for product purity. However, the sulfur dioxide oxidation system presents challenges in terms of selectivity and product formation. For instance, in the case of propane, it undergoes incomplete conversion, mainly forming combustion products rather than propylene.

Conventional oxidants like H2S, S2, and others might offer different properties and selectivities depending on the specific reaction conditions and the nature of the feedstock. Their effectiveness would depend on factors such as the rate of reaction, energy consumption, and the potential formation of byproducts that could complicate downstream processing.

To improve the overall process, future research could focus on optimizing catalyst design to enhance selectivity towards propylene, developing methods to reduce byproduct formation, and exploring conditions that maximize propylene yield. Understanding the reaction mechanisms, such as hydrogen atom abstraction pathways, could also provide insights into tailoring catalysts to better facilitate the desired reaction pathways.

The key areas for improvement might include:
1. Enhancing catalyst stability and activity specifically for the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons with SO2.
2. Reducing the formation of unwanted byproducts like carbon dioxide and sulfur-containing compounds.
3. Optimizing reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the ratio of reactants, to achieve high propylene yields with minimal side reactions.
4. Investigating alternative oxidants that might offer superior selectivity or efficiency for propylene production from propane.
5. Developing new analytical techniques to monitor reaction progress and identify intermediate products, aiding in the optimization of the process.

By addressing these areas, researchers could potentially unlock the full potential of sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, leading to more efficient and sustainable processes for producing valuable petrochemicals.

比较和对比硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烷（ODHP）脱氢到丙烯中的应用，二氧化硫（SO2）系统表现出一些优势和劣势。

SO2使得反应成为吸热的，提供了独特的过程设计机会，特别是对于需要热输入的反应。该系统较少受到燃烧的影响，并避免向产物中引入杂原子，这在保持产品纯度方面具有优势。然而，二氧化硫氧化系统的挑战在于选择性和产物形成。例如，在丙烷的情况下，它经历不完全转化，主要形成燃烧产物，而不是丙烯。

传统氧化剂如H2S、S2和其他物质可能根据特定反应条件和原料性质的不同，展现出不同的特性和选择性。它们的有效性取决于诸如反应速率、能量消耗以及可能形成的副产品的复杂程度等因素。

为了改善总体流程，未来研究可以集中在优化催化剂设计以增强丙烯选择性，开发减少副产品形成的方法，并探索最大化丙烯产率的条件。理解反应机制，如氢原子抽象途径，也可能提供定制催化剂以更好地促进所需反应路径的见解。

关键的研究领域可能包括：
1. 提高针对硫化氢氧化脱氢化氢的催化剂稳定性和活性。
2. 减少形成不需要的副产品，如二氧化碳和硫化合物。
3. 优化反应条件，包括温度、压力和反应物的比例，以实现高丙烯产率并减少副反应。
4. 探索可能提供更优选择性或效率的其他氧化剂，用于从丙烷生产有价值的石油化工产品。
5. 开发新的分析技术来监测反应进程并识别中间产物，有助于优化流程。

通过解决这些领域的问题，研究人员有可能全面发挥硫基氧化剂在脱氢化氢中的潜力，导致更高效、更可持续的流程，用于生产有价值的石油化工产品。

Comparing sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is found to offer substantial selectivity advantages. This is primarily due to a significantly lower propensity for combustion and a lack of direct incorporation of heteroatoms into the feed molecule. The presence of sulfur dioxide enables a more controlled oxidation process, leading to higher propylene yields compared to conventional oxidants. Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants include byproduct formation, particularly when sulfur dioxide reacts with other components in the feed or the catalyst surface, potentially leading to unwanted products such as sulfur compounds or carbon compounds. For future research, key areas of focus should include optimizing catalyst design to enhance the selectivity towards propylene while minimizing byproduct formation. Additionally, developing methods to efficiently regenerate the catalysts, especially to combat the accumulation of coke, which reduces activity over time, is crucial. The role of the sulfur dioxide in the reaction mechanism, whether it is directly involved in hydrogen abstraction or indirectly through surface modifications, is also an area requiring further investigation to fully understand the catalytic process.

对比硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯（ODHP）过程中的应用，发现二氧化硫（SO2）提供了显著的选择性优势。这主要归因于其较低的燃烧倾向和不直接将杂原子引入到原料分子中。二氧化硫的存在使得氧化过程更加可控，从而能够获得比传统氧化剂更高的丙烯产率。硫基氧化剂相关的挑战包括产物形成，特别是当二氧化硫与原料或催化剂表面的其他成分反应时，可能会产生不需要的产品，如硫化合物或碳化合物。未来研究的关键领域应集中在优化催化剂设计以增强丙烯选择性的同时减少副产品的生成。此外，开发有效再生催化剂的方法，尤其是应对催化剂活性随时间下降而积累的焦炭积累，对于提高效率至关重要。需要进一步研究二氧化硫在反应机制中的作用，无论是直接参与氢原子抽取还是通过表面修饰间接作用，以完全理解催化过程。
