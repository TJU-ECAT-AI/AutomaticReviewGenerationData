[1] "In recent years oxidative processing of hydrocarbons has 
I
assoincd great importancc in the pctrochcmical industry. A brief survey of literature indicates that oxidative processes such as: (a) ainnioxidation of propylcnc to acrylonitrile, (b) oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide, and C c ) ethylene oxidation (via the Wacker process) to acetaldehyde and vinyl acetate have been dewloped into major commercial processes (1). Much attention has also hcen given to the selective, oxidative de- hydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers."
[2] "However, when oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the prcscnce of different catalysts, low product yiclds are ohrained due to the occrrence of uncontrolled corn- bustion rcactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."
[3] "This paper examines the theory and chemistry behind the halogcn promoted dehydrogenation process and indicates that it should be possible to replace iodine and bromine wholly or partially with sulphur."
[4] "Table 1 shows the reactions which are thought to occur i n halogen promoted oxidative dehydrogenation."
[5] "Halogen atoms obtained by the dissociation of molecular halogen X 2  (reaction 7) abstract a
hydrocarbon to produce a hydro- carbon radical and hydrogen halide, H X ,  (reaction 8)."
[6] "Thus although it may appear that thermodynamically chlorine should be the mos, efficient and iodine the least cfficienr promoter for oxidative dehydrogenation o f hydrocarbons, in practice, the reverse is found to be true."
[7] "An attempt has been made in Table 3 to explain the above (soincrimes called "synergistic") effect by indicating the two additional reactions which probably occur when a mixed halogen system (Clz + I2 for example) is used in the oxydehydrogena- tion reaction."
[8] "An attempt has been made in the above discussion to explain the effectiveness of halogens in general and iodine in particular as oxidative dehydrogenation promoters (when used singly or in conjunction with each other) without reference to catalysts."
[9] "However, when the above materials are suitably impregnated with transition metal oxides and rare earth oxides, good catalysts are achieved ( 4 * 6 ) , As indicated earlier even thouah iodine is the best promoter for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, its high cost (approx. $l.OO/lb) and the difficulty in recovering it completely for recycle makes its use in a commercial process risky from an economic point of view."
[10] "Oxidation of hydrogen sulphide to recover sulphur by the Clause Reaction is well known (Iz), Kinetics of H2S oxidation by explosion techniques and other methods has been studied ex- tensively (I3) and it has been shown that species such as Sz,
SH,
S+*, are formed as transient intermediates during the eventual formation of elemental sulphur in s 8 rings."
[11] "Thus it would seem logical to take advantage of the HZS oxidation reaction to supply,insitu, the reactive sulphur species needed to replace the halo- gens in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."
[12] "This is so provided suitable catalysts can be defined to ensure a rapid reaction between S:! and the hydrocarbon feed while simultaneously minimizing the polymerization o f the Sz species to the inactive s 8 form."
[13] "Assuming iodine (M.W. = 253.8) is valued at $l.OO/lb, bromine (M.W. = 159.8) at 30 centsjlb, chlorine (M.W. = 70.9) at 3 cents/lb and sulphur (A.W. = 32.1) at 2 cents/lb, then it can be shown that I mole of sulphur costs
64.2 cents and is equivalent in cost to 0.30 mole CI? or 0.013
mole Brz or 0.0025 mole I?."

1. In the petrochemical industry, oxidative processing of hydrocarbons has gained significant importance. Various oxidative processes, such as the oxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile, ethylene to ethylene oxide, and ethylene oxidation to acetaldehyde and vinyl acetate, have been developed into major commercial processes. Much attention has also been given to the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers. However, when oxygen is used as the hydrogen abstractor, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. This paper examines the theory and chemistry behind the halogen-promoted dehydrogenation process and indicates that it should be possible to replace iodine and bromine wholly or partially with sulfur.

2. Table 1 outlines the reactions that occur in halogen-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation. Halogen atoms obtained from the dissociation of molecular halogen X2 abstract a hydrocarbon to produce a hydrocarbon radical and hydrogen halide (HX).

3. Although thermodynamically chlorine appears to be the most efficient and iodine the least efficient promoter for oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, in practice, the reverse is true. The paper explains the effectiveness of halogens in general and iodine in particular as oxidative dehydrogenation promoters without referring to catalysts.

4. When a mixed halogen system (Clz + I2, for example) is used in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, additional reactions occur, which explain the synergistic effect observed in Table 3. These reactions involve the oxidation of HI to iodine by oxygen in the feed, which further speeds up the HI oxidation reaction and ensures that iodine remains available for reaction with the hydrocarbon feed.

5. The paper discusses the challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. It highlights the specific challenges, including byproduct formation and the difficulties in optimizing the overall process.

6. Future research focuses on improving catalyst design and optimizing the overall process for sulfur-based oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation. This includes finding suitable catalysts that ensure a rapid reaction between S! and the hydrocarbon feed while minimizing the polymerization of the Sz species to the inactive s8 form.

7. The paper suggests that the replacement of iodine and bromine with sulfur in a halogen-promoted system could have significant economic benefits, especially if promoter losses are high due to the formation of undesirable by-products. The cost comparison between sulfur and other halogens indicates that sulfur could potentially reduce promoter costs considerably.

8. The oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to recover sulfur through the Claus reaction is a well-known process. Extensive studies on the kinetics of H2S oxidation by explosion techniques and other methods have shown that various species, such as Sz, SH, and S+, are formed as transient intermediates during the formation of elemental sulfur in eight-membered rings. To utilize this reaction effectively, it is proposed to supply the reactive sulfur species needed for the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction in situ.
