1. The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants compared to conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene varies. H2S, S2, and SO2 can be utilized as oxidants, though they face distinct challenges. H2S requires high temperatures to convert to reactive diradical species, S2, which is necessary for efficient dehydrogenation. S2 is known to exist only at very high temperatures, above 3000°F. SO2 is less explored in this context. Challenges include byproduct formation, which can affect yield and purity of propylene. Key areas for future research involve optimizing catalyst design for better interaction with sulfur species and minimizing unwanted side reactions.

2. Conventional oxidants, such as O2, are more straightforward to use in dehydrogenation reactions, typically not requiring high temperatures for sulfur species conversion. They can achieve high product yields under suitable conditions, with minimal byproducts. However, they might require higher catalyst costs or energy inputs.

3. Iodine is identified as the most effective promoter in sub-stoichiometric proportions, primarily because of its ease in being converted back to its active form (atomic iodine) through the oxidation of hydrogen iodide (HI). Chlorine, despite being less costly, faces unfavourable thermodynamics for the oxidation of hydrogen chloride (HCl).

4. Sulphur, while cheaper than iodine, faces challenges in its molecular structure and conversion to reactive forms at the operational temperatures of dehydrogenation reactions. Its potential for replacing iodine and bromine in halogen-promoted systems suggests it could offer cost savings in commercial processes. However, the development of suitable catalysts that efficiently handle the interaction between sulfur species and hydrocarbon feeds while preventing polymerization of sulfur species remains a focus area.

5. The cost-effectiveness of substituting iodine and bromine with sulfur is quantified, showing that a mole of sulfur is equivalent to a fraction of moles of these halogens in terms of cost. This opens opportunities for reducing promoter costs significantly, especially in scenarios with high promoter losses. Future research aims to develop catalysts that can effectively utilize sulfur in a halogen-promoted system while maintaining high product yields.

1. 硫基氧化剂在丙烷脱氢制丙烯（ODHP）中的有效性与传统氧化剂相比有所不同。H2S、S2和SO2可以作为氧化剂使用，但它们面临各自独特的挑战。H2S需要高温才能转化为活性二原子硫（S2），这是高效脱氢所必需的。S2仅在高于3000°F的温度下存在。SO2在此上下文中较少被研究。挑战包括副产品的形成，这可能会影响丙烯的产率和纯度。未来研究的关键领域包括优化催化剂设计以更好地与硫物种相互作用，并最小化不希望的副反应。

2. 传统的氧化剂，如O2，在脱氢反应中通常更直接且无需将硫物种转化为高反应性形式即可实现高产品产率，同时产生的副产物较少。然而，它们可能需要更高的催化剂成本或能量输入。

3. 在亚化学计量比例下，碘被确定为最有效的促进剂，主要因为其易于通过氢碘酸（HI）的氧化将其转换回其活性形式（原子碘）。氯，尽管成本较低，但对于氢氯酸（HCl）的氧化具有不利的热力学特性。

4. 硫虽然比碘便宜，但在操作温度下的分子结构和转化成活性形式面临挑战。其在卤素促进系统中取代碘和溴的潜力表明，它有可能在商业过程中显著降低促动成本。然而，开发能够有效利用硫与碳氢化合物流体相互作用并防止硫物种聚合的催化剂仍然是一个重点研究领域。

5. 将碘和溴用作硫的成本效益分析显示，一摩尔硫相当于这些卤族元素的几分之一摩尔在成本上的等价物。这为在有高促动剂损失的情况下显著降低促动成本提供了机会。未来的研究旨在开发能够在卤素促进系统中有效利用硫的催化剂，同时保持高产品产率。
