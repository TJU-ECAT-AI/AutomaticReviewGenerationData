1. The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants compared to conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene varies. H2S, S2, and SO2 can be utilized as oxidants, though they face distinct challenges. H2S requires high temperatures to convert to reactive diradical species, S2, which is necessary for efficient dehydrogenation. S2 is known to exist only at very high temperatures, above 3000°F. SO2 is less explored in this context. Challenges include byproduct formation, which can affect yield and purity of propylene. Key areas for future research involve optimizing catalyst design for better interaction with sulfur species and minimizing unwanted side reactions.

2. Conventional oxidants, such as O2, are more straightforward to use in dehydrogenation reactions, typically not requiring high temperatures for sulfur species conversion. They can achieve high product yields under suitable conditions, with minimal byproducts. However, they might require higher catalyst costs or energy inputs.

3. Iodine is identified as the most effective promoter in sub-stoichiometric proportions, primarily because of its ease in being converted back to its active form (atomic iodine) through the oxidation of hydrogen iodide (HI). Chlorine, despite being less costly, faces unfavourable thermodynamics for the oxidation of hydrogen chloride (HCl).

4. Sulphur, while cheaper than iodine, faces challenges in its molecular structure and conversion to reactive forms at the operational temperatures of dehydrogenation reactions. Its potential for replacing iodine and bromine in halogen-promoted systems suggests it could offer cost savings in commercial processes. However, the development of suitable catalysts that efficiently handle the interaction between sulfur species and hydrocarbon feeds while preventing polymerization of sulfur species remains a focus area.

5. The cost-effectiveness of substituting iodine and bromine with sulfur is quantified, showing that a mole of sulfur is equivalent to a fraction of moles of these halogens in terms of cost. This opens opportunities for reducing promoter costs significantly, especially in scenarios with high promoter losses. Future research aims to develop catalysts that can effectively utilize sulfur in a halogen-promoted system while maintaining high product yields.

1. 硫基氧化剂在丙烷脱氢制丙烯（ODHP）中的有效性与传统氧化剂相比有所不同。H2S、S2和SO2可以作为氧化剂使用，但它们面临各自独特的挑战。H2S需要高温才能转化为活性二原子硫（S2），这是高效脱氢所必需的。S2仅在高于3000°F的温度下存在。SO2在此上下文中较少被研究。挑战包括副产品的形成，这可能会影响丙烯的产率和纯度。未来研究的关键领域包括优化催化剂设计以更好地与硫物种相互作用，并最小化不希望的副反应。

2. 传统的氧化剂，如O2，在脱氢反应中通常更直接且无需将硫物种转化为高反应性形式即可实现高产品产率，同时产生的副产物较少。然而，它们可能需要更高的催化剂成本或能量输入。

3. 在亚化学计量比例下，碘被确定为最有效的促进剂，主要因为其易于通过氢碘酸（HI）的氧化将其转换回其活性形式（原子碘）。氯，尽管成本较低，但对于氢氯酸（HCl）的氧化具有不利的热力学特性。

4. 硫虽然比碘便宜，但在操作温度下的分子结构和转化成活性形式面临挑战。其在卤素促进系统中取代碘和溴的潜力表明，它有可能在商业过程中显著降低促动成本。然而，开发能够有效利用硫与碳氢化合物流体相互作用并防止硫物种聚合的催化剂仍然是一个重点研究领域。

5. 将碘和溴用作硫的成本效益分析显示，一摩尔硫相当于这些卤族元素的几分之一摩尔在成本上的等价物。这为在有高促动剂损失的情况下显著降低促动成本提供了机会。未来的研究旨在开发能够在卤素促进系统中有效利用硫的催化剂，同时保持高产品产率。

The document discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and the role of sulfur-based oxidants compared to conventional oxidants. It mentions that sulfur, especially in combination with other halogens like chlorine and bromine, can potentially replace iodine as an effective promoter in this process. This substitution could lead to significant economic benefits, particularly in reducing costs related to promoter usage. The document also outlines the mechanisms involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation process, including the formation of hydrogen halides and their subsequent reactions with oxygen to produce olefinic products. It highlights the differences in the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) compared to conventional oxidants, considering factors like propylene yield, byproduct formation, and the challenges associated with each oxidant. Future research is directed towards improving catalyst design and optimizing the overall process for better performance and efficiency.

The document suggests that the use of sulfur vapor for dehydrogenation faces practical challenges due to the molecular structure of sulfur at the required temperatures, which could lead to thermal cracking reactions instead of dehydrogenation. It proposes utilizing the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to recover sulfur as a method to supply reactive sulfur species for replacement in halogen-promoted systems. The thermodynamic comparison of H2S and HI regeneration reactions indicates the potential for replacing HI in halogen/sulfur promoted systems while maintaining high product yields. The document concludes that the replacement of iodine and bromine with sulfur in halogen-promoted systems could lead to considerable cost reductions, depending on the quantity of sulfur used and the efficiency of the catalysts employed.

Future research in this area could focus on developing catalysts that efficiently convert sulfur vapor into reactive species suitable for dehydrogenation, minimizing byproduct formation, and optimizing the reaction conditions to enhance the yield of olefinic products. Additionally, exploring the synergistic effects of sulfur with other halogens or sulfur itself in promoting oxidative dehydrogenation could lead to more effective and economically viable processes.

文献讨论了烃氧化脱氢过程和硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在该过程中所起的作用。它提到，硫，尤其是与氯、溴等其他卤素结合时，可以作为碘的替代品，有效促进此过程。这种替换可能会带来显著的经济优势，尤其是在降低促动剂使用成本方面。文献还概述了氧化脱氢过程的机制，包括氢卤化物的形成及其随后与氧气反应生成烯烃产物的过程。它强调了不同硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂相比的有效性差异，考虑了丙烯产量、副产品形成以及每种氧化剂面临的挑战。未来研究的方向是改进催化剂设计和优化整体流程以提高性能和效率。

文献指出，使用硫蒸汽进行脱氢面临实践挑战，因为所需温度下硫的分子结构可能导致热裂解反应而非脱氢。它提出利用氢硫化物（H2S）的氧化回收硫的方法，作为一种方法来提供替代卤素系统的活性硫物种。H2S和HI再生反应的热力学比较表明，在卤素/硫系统中用H2S替换HI的可能性，同时仍能实现高产率的产品。结论指出，通过在卤素促进系统中用大量硫取代碘和溴，可能会导致显著的成本降低，这取决于使用的硫量和催化剂的效率。

未来研究领域的探索可以集中在开发能够高效将硫蒸汽转化为适合脱氢的活性物种的催化剂上，最小化副产品的形成，并优化反应条件以增强烯烃产品的产率。此外，探索硫与其他卤素或自身在促进氧化脱氢中的协同作用，可能引领更有效且经济可行的工艺的发展。

1. In the petrochemical industry, oxidative processing of hydrocarbons has gained significant importance. Various oxidative processes, such as the oxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile, ethylene to ethylene oxide, and ethylene oxidation to acetaldehyde and vinyl acetate, have been developed into major commercial processes. Much attention has also been given to the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers. However, when oxygen is used as the hydrogen abstractor, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. This paper examines the theory and chemistry behind the halogen-promoted dehydrogenation process and indicates that it should be possible to replace iodine and bromine wholly or partially with sulfur.

2. Table 1 outlines the reactions that occur in halogen-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation. Halogen atoms obtained from the dissociation of molecular halogen X2 abstract a hydrocarbon to produce a hydrocarbon radical and hydrogen halide (HX).

3. Although thermodynamically chlorine appears to be the most efficient and iodine the least efficient promoter for oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, in practice, the reverse is true. The paper explains the effectiveness of halogens in general and iodine in particular as oxidative dehydrogenation promoters without referring to catalysts.

4. When a mixed halogen system (Clz + I2, for example) is used in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, additional reactions occur, which explain the synergistic effect observed in Table 3. These reactions involve the oxidation of HI to iodine by oxygen in the feed, which further speeds up the HI oxidation reaction and ensures that iodine remains available for reaction with the hydrocarbon feed.

5. The paper discusses the challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. It highlights the specific challenges, including byproduct formation and the difficulties in optimizing the overall process.

6. Future research focuses on improving catalyst design and optimizing the overall process for sulfur-based oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation. This includes finding suitable catalysts that ensure a rapid reaction between S! and the hydrocarbon feed while minimizing the polymerization of the Sz species to the inactive s8 form.

7. The paper suggests that the replacement of iodine and bromine with sulfur in a halogen-promoted system could have significant economic benefits, especially if promoter losses are high due to the formation of undesirable by-products. The cost comparison between sulfur and other halogens indicates that sulfur could potentially reduce promoter costs considerably.

8. The oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to recover sulfur through the Claus reaction is a well-known process. Extensive studies on the kinetics of H2S oxidation by explosion techniques and other methods have shown that various species, such as Sz, SH, and S+, are formed as transient intermediates during the formation of elemental sulfur in eight-membered rings. To utilize this reaction effectively, it is proposed to supply the reactive sulfur species needed for the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction in situ.

3. 尽管从热力学角度来看，氯似乎是氧化脱氢碳氢化合物中最有效且碘是最不有效的促进剂，但在实践中，情况正好相反。文章解释了卤素（包括碘）作为氧化脱氢催化剂的效率，没有涉及催化剂的影响。

4. 当使用混合卤素系统（如Clz + I2）进行氧化脱氢反应时，会发生额外的反应，这些反应解释了表3中观察到的协同效应。这些反应包括氧在卤素氧化反应中的参与，加速了HI的氧化反应，并确保碘始终可用以与碳氢化合物反应。

5. 文章讨论了硫化物氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）在丙烷（ODHP）氧化为丙烯过程中的挑战，包括副产品的形成和优化整个过程的困难。

6. 未来的研究重点是改进硫化物氧化剂的催化剂设计和优化整个氧化脱氢过程。这包括找到能够快速反应的催化剂，同时最小化Sz物种的聚合，使其保持活性形式。

7. 文章建议通过在卤素促进系统中用硫替换碘和溴，可以显著降低经济成本，特别是如果促进剂损失高，导致形成不可接受的副产品的情况下。硫与其它卤素的成本比较表明，硫有可能大幅度降低促进剂成本。

8. 硫化氢（H2S）的氧化回收硫通过克劳斯反应是一个广为人知的过程。通过爆炸技术和其他方法对H2S氧化的动态学研究显示，各种物种，如Sz、SH和S+，作为中间体在形成八元环元素硫期间形成。为了有效地利用这一反应，提出在氧化脱氢反应中就地提供所需的活性硫物种。

Comparing the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the literature suggests several key points:

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation process is not equilibrium limited, unlike conventional thermal dehydrogenation, because it results in the formation of a thermodynamically stable product (water) alongside olefinic products.

2. Halogen-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation reactions involve a series of steps including halogen abstraction from the hydrocarbon, halogen oxidation, and dehydrohalogenation to form olefins. These reactions are typically carried out under conditions between 950-1250°F, at atmospheric pressure, with suitable catalysts.

3. When sulfur is used as a promoter, it can replace iodine and other halogens to some extent, leading to higher product yields. The literature discusses the challenges associated with using sulfur vapor, such as obtaining reactive sulfur species at high enough concentrations and avoiding thermal cracking reactions.

4. The effectiveness of sulfur in the oxidative dehydrogenation process depends on its ability to form reactive sulfur species efficiently and its compatibility with catalysts used in the process. The sulfur must be impregnated with transition metal oxides and rare earth oxides to achieve good catalytic activity.

5. The use of sulfur vapor poses significant challenges due to the high temperatures required to obtain reactive sulfur species, which can lead to thermal cracking of hydrocarbons rather than dehydrogenation to olefins.

6. The recovery of sulfur through oxidation reactions, such as the Claus process, can provide a sustainable and cost-effective source of sulfur for use in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design to enhance sulfur's reactivity and compatibility with the oxidative dehydrogenation process, reducing promoter losses, and minimizing the formation of undesirable by-products. Additionally, improving the efficiency of sulfur vapor utilization and exploring alternative methods for sulfur recovery could contribute to the overall optimization of the process.

在丙烷（ODHP）氧化脱氢生成丙烯的过程中，不同硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂相比，文献提出了一些关键点：

1. 氧化脱氢过程不受平衡限制，因为它会形成热力学稳定的产物（水），同时生成烯烃产品。

2. 褐铁矿促进的氧化脱氢反应涉及一系列步骤，包括卤素从烃的抽取、卤素氧化和脱卤化，以形成烯烃。这些反应通常在950-1250°F之间进行，大气压力下，使用合适的催化剂。

3. 当使用硫作为促进剂时，它可以部分替代碘和其他卤素，导致更高的产品产率。文献讨论了使用硫蒸气的挑战，如获得足够浓度的活性硫物种，并避免烃的热裂解反应。

4. 硫在氧化脱氢过程中是否有效取决于其形成活性硫物种的能力及其与过程中使用的催化剂的兼容性。硫必须被过渡金属氧化物和稀土氧化物浸渍，以实现良好的催化活性。

5. 使用硫蒸气面临重大挑战，因为需要高温度来获得活性硫物种，这可能导致烃的热裂解而不是脱氢为烯烃。

6. 通过氧化反应回收硫（如克劳斯过程）可以提供一个可持续且成本效益高的硫来源用于氧化脱氢过程。

未来研究应集中在优化催化剂设计，增强硫的活性和与氧化脱氢过程的兼容性，减少促进剂损失，并最小化不希望的副产品的形成。此外，提高硫蒸气的有效利用效率和探索硫回收的替代方法可以有助于整个过程的优化。

Answer: 
1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, including the amidoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile, the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide, and ethylene oxidation to acetaldehyde and vinyl acetate through the Wacker process, have been developed into significant commercial processes. However, using oxygen alone as a hydrogen abstractor leads to low product yields due to uncontrolled combustion reactions forming carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.

2. Incorporating sulfur alongside halogens like bromine and chlorine in the oxidative dehydrogenation process presents an even more promising option. This combination allows for the replacement of costly halogens with inexpensive sulfur, potentially reducing promoter costs significantly.
