[1] "Oxidative processes such as: (a) amidoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile, (b) oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide, and (c) ethylene oxidation (via the Wacker process) to acetaldehyde and vinyl acetate have been developed into major commercial processes."
[2] "However, when oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."
[3] "An even more attractive process can be visualized if sulphur is also used in admixture with the above halogens, particularly bromine and chlorine."
[4] "In practice it is found that the above reactions do not proceed well in the gas phase or even in the presence of inert surfaces such as porcelain beads, silica or tabular aluminas."
[5] "However, when the above materials are suitably impregnated with transition metal oxides and rare earth oxides, good catalysts are achieved."
[6] "Assuming iodine (M.W. = 253.8) is valued at $1.00/lb, bromine (M.W. = 159.8) at 30 cents/lb, chlorine (M.W. = 70.9) at 3 cents/lb and sulphur (A.W. = 32.1) at 2 cents/lb, then it can be shown that 1 mole of sulphur costs 64.2 cents and is equivalent in cost to 0.30 mole CI2 or 0.013 mole Br2 or 0.0025 mole I2."

Answer: 
1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, including the amidoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile, the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide, and ethylene oxidation to acetaldehyde and vinyl acetate through the Wacker process, have been developed into significant commercial processes. However, using oxygen alone as a hydrogen abstractor leads to low product yields due to uncontrolled combustion reactions forming carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.

2. Incorporating sulfur alongside halogens like bromine and chlorine in the oxidative dehydrogenation process presents an even more promising option. This combination allows for the replacement of costly halogens with inexpensive sulfur, potentially reducing promoter costs significantly.

Answer: 
1. 在氧化脱氢过程中，如丙烯的酰胺氧化为丙烯腈、乙烯氧化为乙二醇以及通过瓦克尔过程将乙烯氧化为乙醛和醋酸乙烯酯等过程已被开发成主要的商业过程。然而，仅使用氧气作为氢抽象剂，并在不同的催化剂存在下，由于失控的燃烧反应形成一氧化碳和二氧化碳，导致低产品产率。

2. 如果将硫与上述卤素（尤其是溴和氯）混合使用，则可以想象出一个更吸引人的过程。这种组合允许昂贵的卤素被廉价的硫替换，从而有可能大幅降低促进剂成本。
