Comparing the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the literature suggests several key points:

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation process is not equilibrium limited, unlike conventional thermal dehydrogenation, because it results in the formation of a thermodynamically stable product (water) alongside olefinic products.

2. Halogen-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation reactions involve a series of steps including halogen abstraction from the hydrocarbon, halogen oxidation, and dehydrohalogenation to form olefins. These reactions are typically carried out under conditions between 950-1250°F, at atmospheric pressure, with suitable catalysts.

3. When sulfur is used as a promoter, it can replace iodine and other halogens to some extent, leading to higher product yields. The literature discusses the challenges associated with using sulfur vapor, such as obtaining reactive sulfur species at high enough concentrations and avoiding thermal cracking reactions.

4. The effectiveness of sulfur in the oxidative dehydrogenation process depends on its ability to form reactive sulfur species efficiently and its compatibility with catalysts used in the process. The sulfur must be impregnated with transition metal oxides and rare earth oxides to achieve good catalytic activity.

5. The use of sulfur vapor poses significant challenges due to the high temperatures required to obtain reactive sulfur species, which can lead to thermal cracking of hydrocarbons rather than dehydrogenation to olefins.

6. The recovery of sulfur through oxidation reactions, such as the Claus process, can provide a sustainable and cost-effective source of sulfur for use in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design to enhance sulfur's reactivity and compatibility with the oxidative dehydrogenation process, reducing promoter losses, and minimizing the formation of undesirable by-products. Additionally, improving the efficiency of sulfur vapor utilization and exploring alternative methods for sulfur recovery could contribute to the overall optimization of the process.

在丙烷（ODHP）氧化脱氢生成丙烯的过程中，不同硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂相比，文献提出了一些关键点：

1. 氧化脱氢过程不受平衡限制，因为它会形成热力学稳定的产物（水），同时生成烯烃产品。

2. 褐铁矿促进的氧化脱氢反应涉及一系列步骤，包括卤素从烃的抽取、卤素氧化和脱卤化，以形成烯烃。这些反应通常在950-1250°F之间进行，大气压力下，使用合适的催化剂。

3. 当使用硫作为促进剂时，它可以部分替代碘和其他卤素，导致更高的产品产率。文献讨论了使用硫蒸气的挑战，如获得足够浓度的活性硫物种，并避免烃的热裂解反应。

4. 硫在氧化脱氢过程中是否有效取决于其形成活性硫物种的能力及其与过程中使用的催化剂的兼容性。硫必须被过渡金属氧化物和稀土氧化物浸渍，以实现良好的催化活性。

5. 使用硫蒸气面临重大挑战，因为需要高温度来获得活性硫物种，这可能导致烃的热裂解而不是脱氢为烯烃。

6. 通过氧化反应回收硫（如克劳斯过程）可以提供一个可持续且成本效益高的硫来源用于氧化脱氢过程。

未来研究应集中在优化催化剂设计，增强硫的活性和与氧化脱氢过程的兼容性，减少促进剂损失，并最小化不希望的副产品的形成。此外，提高硫蒸气的有效利用效率和探索硫回收的替代方法可以有助于整个过程的优化。
