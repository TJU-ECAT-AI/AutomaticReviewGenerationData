The document discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and the role of sulfur-based oxidants compared to conventional oxidants. It mentions that sulfur, especially in combination with other halogens like chlorine and bromine, can potentially replace iodine as an effective promoter in this process. This substitution could lead to significant economic benefits, particularly in reducing costs related to promoter usage. The document also outlines the mechanisms involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation process, including the formation of hydrogen halides and their subsequent reactions with oxygen to produce olefinic products. It highlights the differences in the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) compared to conventional oxidants, considering factors like propylene yield, byproduct formation, and the challenges associated with each oxidant. Future research is directed towards improving catalyst design and optimizing the overall process for better performance and efficiency.

The document suggests that the use of sulfur vapor for dehydrogenation faces practical challenges due to the molecular structure of sulfur at the required temperatures, which could lead to thermal cracking reactions instead of dehydrogenation. It proposes utilizing the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to recover sulfur as a method to supply reactive sulfur species for replacement in halogen-promoted systems. The thermodynamic comparison of H2S and HI regeneration reactions indicates the potential for replacing HI in halogen/sulfur promoted systems while maintaining high product yields. The document concludes that the replacement of iodine and bromine with sulfur in halogen-promoted systems could lead to considerable cost reductions, depending on the quantity of sulfur used and the efficiency of the catalysts employed.

Future research in this area could focus on developing catalysts that efficiently convert sulfur vapor into reactive species suitable for dehydrogenation, minimizing byproduct formation, and optimizing the reaction conditions to enhance the yield of olefinic products. Additionally, exploring the synergistic effects of sulfur with other halogens or sulfur itself in promoting oxidative dehydrogenation could lead to more effective and economically viable processes.

文献讨论了烃氧化脱氢过程和硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在该过程中所起的作用。它提到，硫，尤其是与氯、溴等其他卤素结合时，可以作为碘的替代品，有效促进此过程。这种替换可能会带来显著的经济优势，尤其是在降低促动剂使用成本方面。文献还概述了氧化脱氢过程的机制，包括氢卤化物的形成及其随后与氧气反应生成烯烃产物的过程。它强调了不同硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂相比的有效性差异，考虑了丙烯产量、副产品形成以及每种氧化剂面临的挑战。未来研究的方向是改进催化剂设计和优化整体流程以提高性能和效率。

文献指出，使用硫蒸汽进行脱氢面临实践挑战，因为所需温度下硫的分子结构可能导致热裂解反应而非脱氢。它提出利用氢硫化物（H2S）的氧化回收硫的方法，作为一种方法来提供替代卤素系统的活性硫物种。H2S和HI再生反应的热力学比较表明，在卤素/硫系统中用H2S替换HI的可能性，同时仍能实现高产率的产品。结论指出，通过在卤素促进系统中用大量硫取代碘和溴，可能会导致显著的成本降低，这取决于使用的硫量和催化剂的效率。

未来研究领域的探索可以集中在开发能够高效将硫蒸汽转化为适合脱氢的活性物种的催化剂上，最小化副产品的形成，并优化反应条件以增强烯烃产品的产率。此外，探索硫与其他卤素或自身在促进氧化脱氢中的协同作用，可能引领更有效且经济可行的工艺的发展。
