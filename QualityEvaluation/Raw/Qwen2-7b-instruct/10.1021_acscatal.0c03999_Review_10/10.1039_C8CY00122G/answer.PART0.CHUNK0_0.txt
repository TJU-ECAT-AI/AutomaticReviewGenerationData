[1] "Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation were investigated over EuOCl and EuOBr, revealing significant differences in activity and especially in the product distribution as a function of the halide type."
[2] "The catalysts were virtually inactive in ODH reactions in the temperature window of oxyhalogenation, and the products detected were mainly carbon oxides with selectivity values ranging from 60% to 100%."
[3] "In the case of HBr oxidation over EuOBr, Br2 generation occurred at much lower temperatures than alkane oxybromination."
[4] "First, the yield of olefin formation was much higher than the one attained over quartz in all cases, which demonstrates that the dehydrohalogenation step is catalysed by europium oxyhalides."
[5] "On the other hand, the differences in olefin formation at high temperature between oxybromination and gas-phase bromination of propane and, especially ethane, are due to the fact that the alkyl bromide generated in the gas-phase is catalytically dehydrobrominated to the corresponding olefin in oxybromination, while this step is limited in alkane bromination due to the absence of the catalyst."
[6] "Regardless of the alkane substrate,oxychlorination preferably leads to olefins generation, whereas oxybromination favours the formation of bromocarbons."

1. The investigation of ethane and propane oxyhalogenation over EuOCl and EuOBr highlighted significant differences in activity and product distribution based on the halide type. 
2. Catalysts were nearly inactive in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions within the oxyhalogenation temperature range, producing mainly carbon oxides with selectivity from 60% to 100%. 
3. During hydrogen bromide oxidation over EuOBr, bromine (Br2) was produced at much lower temperatures than in alkane oxybromination. 
4. The yield of olefin formation was notably greater than when using quartz catalysts, indicating that the dehydrohalogenation process is catalyzed by europium oxyhalides. 
5. The contrast in olefin formation between oxybromination and gas-phase bromination of propane and, especially ethane, is due to the alkyl bromide's catalytic dehydrobromination in oxybromination, which is limited in alkane bromination without the catalyst.
6. Regardless of the alkane substrate, oxychlorination predominantly produces olefins, while oxybromination favors the creation of bromocarbons.

1. 对乙烷和丙烷的氧卤化作用在EuOCl和EuOBr上的研究揭示了基于卤化剂类型活动和产物分布的重要差异。
2. 在氧卤化作用温度范围内，催化剂在氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中基本无效，主要产生碳氧化物，选择性从60%到100%。
3. 在EuOBr上进行氢溴酸氧化时，溴（Br2）的生成温度远低于烷基氧溴化作用。 
4. 老化过程形成的烯烃产量明显高于使用石英催化剂的情况，表明这一步骤是由铕氧卤化物催化进行的。
5. 烷基溴化作用与烷基溴化作用和丙烷的气体相溴化之间的对比，在于气体相溴化作用中产生的烷基溴化物在氧溴化作用中通过催化剂催化脱溴化作用形成相应的烯烃，而在没有催化剂的情况下，烷基溴化作用步骤受限。
6. 不管是哪种烷基，氧氯化作用主要产生烯烃，而氧溴化作用则倾向于生成溴化碳。
