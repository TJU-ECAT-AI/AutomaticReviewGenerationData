    "Summary": "Both review articles effectively address the topic of sulfur-based alternative oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane for propylene production. They offer comparable content quality, structure and organization, academic standards, innovation and contribution, methodology assessment, timeliness and cutting-edge nature, writing quality, and practicality and application value. However, neither review surpasses the other in any significant aspect. Both could benefit from more detailed methodological descriptions, deeper exploration of interdisciplinary perspectives, and a more refined writing style. The main difference lies in the depth of analysis and foresight proposed for new research directions, where Review B edges slightly ahead."
