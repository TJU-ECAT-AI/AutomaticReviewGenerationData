5. Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane with Sulfur-/Halogen-Containing Compounds
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Alternate oxidants, such as sulfur or halogen-based oxidants, have shown promising results to selectively dehydrogenate propane to propylene. For example, co-feeding sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can improve propylene yield. Using SO2 as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize SO2, which is an acidic gas. However, the SO2&ndash;ODHP pathway results in low propylene because of the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts. Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2. (213) Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2&ndash;ODHP. (213) In the future, developing a structure&ndash;activity relationship will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field.
Selective activation of C3H8 can also be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways, such as (i) dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), (ii) oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), (iii) propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and (iv) molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2). Specifically, oxychlorination chemistry over CeO2, EuOX, and metal phosphate-based, such as CrPO4, catalysts have shown good selectivity (up to 95%) and conversion (up to 70% at 500 °C) in comparison to conventional ODHP. (48−50) Still, the olefin selectivity is limited because of the formation of COx and polyhalogenation products. Continuous efforts have been put forth to obtain an optimal propane oxyhalogenation catalyst, which should exhibit moderate redox properties so that it enables alkane activation but does not favor alkane overoxidation, combustion, and evolution of Cl2, while possessing fast dehydrochlorination kinetics.
5.1. Propane Dehydrogenation in the Presence of Sulfur-Based Feed
Thermal (or steam) cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of hydrocarbons are the most important processes in the production of olefins, the building blocks of the chemical industry. To improve selectivity (i.e., reduce hydrogenolysis or coke formation), sulfur-based additives, such as dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and H2S, are often added as a dilute co-feed during the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons. (214−216) The role of sulfur as a promoter or inhibitor is well studied in the literature for hydrogenation reactions. (217−219) In particular, sulfur has been found to suppress the cracking of organic molecules on metal catalysts. Assuming the ability of sulfur to suppress the cracking reactivity is stronger than its ability to poison the dehydrogenation reactivity of metallic (or metal oxide) catalysts (Fe, Ni, Cu, Co, Zn Mn, Mo), sulfur compounds can be good promoters for enhancing the dehydrogenation performance. (220−222) Typically, the effect of sulfur on the catalytic propane dehydrogenation has been studied in one of the following categories (Figure 20), namely, (i) in situ catalyst sulfidation (in the presence of H2S) but in the absence of O2, (ii) mixture of H2S + O2 or (iii) SO2, and (iv) S2. (39,40,44,220−234)

5.1.1. H2S-Catalyzed DHP/ODHP
Several patents highlight the merits of adding H2S during the uncatalyzed propane dehydrogenation. (235,236) For example, the addition of H2S in the reactant stream doubles the C3H6 yield to 31% at 815 °C. (235) Further, Resasco et al. demonstrate that the Ni/Al2O3, treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), exhibits improved selectivity and decreased coke formation during isobutane dehydrogenation. (237) Similarly, the selectivity of C3H6 on Pt/MgAl2O4 is significantly improved from 47% to 95% without changing its activity when H2S (425 ppm) is co-fed, thus establishing a promoting effect. (238) On the basis of CO-chemisorption and Bader charge analysis, Wang et al. explain that the improved selectivity in the presence of H2S is due to the electron transfer from adsorbed sulfur species to Pt atoms, thereby resulting in weaker Pt&ndash;C3H6 interactions. (239) Of note, H2S can inhibit the conversion and adversely affect the selectivity of propylene at higher concentrations (about 850 ppm) over Pt/Al2O3 underlining the dual role of H2S as an inhibitor and promoter depending on H2S concentration in the feed. (238) Subsequently, Shan et al. show that the exposure of metal oxides to sulfur feed can lead to the formation of corresponding metal sulfides (or surface sulfur species) and reported improved isobutane dehydrogenation yield, suggesting that the sulfur can play a key role in modifying the active phase of the catalyst. (220−222) The authors argued that higher selectivity is due to the preferential activation of C&ndash;H bonds over C&ndash;C bonds on metal&ndash;sulfur ensembles, coupled with facile olefin desorption, thus, effectively reducing the possibility of side reactions and coke generation. (220−222) In summary, the resulting metal sulfides formed due to exposure to H2S, show improved dehydrogenation performance over their parent metals or metal oxides, presenting a unique opportunity to design new catalysts with enhanced oxidative or nonoxidative dehydrogenation capability with improved selectivity and stability. (220−223)
Sulfur compounds, such as S2 and H2S, have been used as cocatalysts to reduce overoxidation of alkanes and olefins during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions (ODH). (40,42,44,240) Clark et al. have investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using γ-Al2O3 and 13% V/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of H2S + O2 at short residence times (t = 5 ms) and achieved a C3H6 yield of ∼30.4% at 700 °C. (40) The C3H6 selectivity increases at residence times below 0.5 s, indicating that shorter residence times are required to suppress the cracking reaction. (40) Gasper et al. demonstrate that C3H6 yields of up to 60% can be obtained for H2S-promoted ODH over LiCl/KCl/MnCl2 molten salt at 705 °C. (39) As postulated, sulfur in the diatomic state (active species) may abstract H species from an alkane. Of particular note is that significantly higher C3H6 yield (i.e., 60%) is evident in the presence of molten salt for H2S-assisted ODH than is obtained with the catalyst (i.e., 30%) or in gas-phase reactions (i.e., 20%) at 700 °C. (39,40,44)
The addition of gaseous sulfur, either S2/COS/SO2/H2S or combinations of sulfur compounds over Al2O3, (Co, Mo, Fe, W, Ni-mono or bimetallic) metals supported either on Al2O3 or SiO2 demonstrates excellent performance (up to 98% C3H8 conversion, C3H6 selectivity = 95%, and CS2 selectivity = 1%) in the temperature range of 400&ndash;750 °C, which is summarized in Table 13. (42,229−233) In these studies, the catalyst precursor, which may be metal oxides/metal sulfides/metal oxysulfides, is typically activated in the presence of one or more sulfur-containing compounds, such as S2, H2S, SO2, COS. Recently, oxidative propane dehydrogenation utilizing sulfur vapor (S2: C3H8 = 1: 0.3) as an oxidant has been investigated at 600&ndash;950 °C over bulk Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3 catalysts that are activated in a mixture of S2/H2S. (234) The study reveals that the C3H6 yield and selectivity improve in the presence of S2; however, the conversion (C3H8 conversion = 10% and C3H6 selectivity = 73%, at 650 °C) is barely affected by the catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions. DFT calculations on the H2S-assisted gas-phase ODH reaction reveal that the in situ generated sulfur intermediate (S2) can abstract the hydrogen from the alkane, leading to the formation of olefin products (see section 6.3 for details). (44) It highlights that the sulfur is participating in the reaction as a catalyst. The formation of sulfur-based byproducts, such as CS2, 1- and 2-propyl thiol mercaptan, and sulfur (S8), is also observed in the reactor effluent. (229−234) Recently, Marks and co-workers have evaluated the role of sulfur as a soft oxidant for propane dehydrogenation (S2&ndash;ODHP) over transition metal oxide (ZrO2, TiO2, Cr2O3) and sulfide (PdS, MoS2) at milder reaction temperature (T = 470&ndash;550 °C). (213) They found that the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with lower metal&ndash;sulfur bond strength, indicating a more active sulfur species. The authors proposed that C&ndash;H activation (RDS) proceeds by a surface sulfur species based on first order dependence on propane. Consequently, propylene and H2S formation leads to sulfur vacancy, and gas phase S2 replenishes these sulfur vacant sites.

5.1.2. Metal Sulfate- and SO2-Assisted DHP/ODHP
The effect of sulfation has been studied via either synthesizing Me&ndash;SO4 (Me = Co, Fe, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Mn) or the introduction of SO2 as an oxidant in the co-feed. In the former case, sulfate-promoted FeOx and Co/Al2O3 catalytic systems show excellent activity in C3H8 dehydrogenation accompanied by relatively better stability than the nonsulfated catalyst. (225−228) The improved performance of the catalyst is attributed to the electron-withdrawing effect of sulfate species from the metal ion, as illustrated in Figure 21. The strong interaction of SO42&ndash; species with the support and Fe results in C3H8 polarization, followed by cleaving of the C&ndash;H bond over the Feδ+ and Oδ− pair. The loss of sulfate groups via in situ generation of SO2 or FeSx over prolonged reaction times induces coke formation and results in a loss of activity. The loss in activity with TOS has motivated Sun et al. to introduce SO2 into the reactant stream over sulfated 20% Fe/Al2O3, which results in stable performance for up to 15 h with 20% C3H6 yield at 560 °C. (227) Further tests are carried out over 20% Fe anchored on different supports including ZrO2, SiO2, and γ-Al2O3. Among them, γ-Al2O3 has the best performance, which is probably due to the formation of stable sulfate species.

Additionally, propane dehydrogenation has been performed with the introduction of SO2 as an oxidant. (37,38,241−245) Ashmawy has investigated the reaction of propane with SO2 over a 0.5% Pd&ndash;Al2O3 catalyst. (37,38) The addition of SO2 (i.e., C3H8: SO2 of 6: 1) to the co-feed increases the C3H8 conversion; however, the selectivity decreases markedly (i.e., 93.1% to ∼20%) with increasing SO2 partial pressure in the co-feed. As suggested, SO2 can abstract a H atom from C3H8, and the low selectivity may be caused by oxidation of C3H8 or C3H6 to form water and COx species. Adams et al. further investigate C3H8 oxidation with SO2 using a calcium&ndash;nickel phosphate catalyst and reported 14% selectivity toward C3H6, along with 31% C3H8 conversion at 550 °C and GHSV = 90 h&ndash;1. (241) To investigate the factors behind the low C3H6 selectivity, the same group has conducted additional experiments in which ammonia is added to the C3H8 and SO2 mixture. It was hypothesized that, in the presence of ammonia, the calcium&ndash;nickel phosphate catalyst would scavenge the C3H6 molecule formed under reaction conditions via the formation of isothiazole and prevents its oxidation to COx compounds. However, the selectivity barely changes with ammonia addition, indicating that the initial reaction of SO2 with C3H8 can be related to the formation of undesired combustion products (COx) rather than C3H6.
Sokolovskii et al. have investigated the role of activated carbon in selective catalytic oxidation of propane in the presence of SO2. (242) Improved C3H6 formation can be obtained over γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and Ga2O3 because of the in situ generation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) or activated coke. (243) In contrast, Fe2O3, Bi2O3, and PbO-based bulk catalysts undergo sulfidation, which leads to decreases in the C3H6 yield under similar reaction conditions (Table 13). Danilova and Ivanova have investigated the effect of pore size (textural properties) on the catalytic performance of SO2-assisted ODHP over SiO2&ndash;Al2O3 catalysts at 640 °C with an SO2 co-feed of 10 mol %. (244) Pores that are smaller than 10 nm lead to oxidation or coke products, whereas pores between 10 and 100 nm are optimal for C3H6 formation. Similar to Sokolovskii’s observation, the accrual of OCP over silica is accompanied by the improved C3H6 yield from 3.4 to 46 mol % at 640 °C with a C3H8: SO2: He ratio of 10: 10: 80 mol %. It is important to note that, because of the formation of OCP, the carbon balance is reported to vary between 60% and 100%. Danilova et al. have studied the effect of OCP accumulation (0&ndash;40 wt %) on catalytic performance over SiO2 via various ex situ techniques. (245) DRIFTS spectra reveal that the OCP system is composed of a polycyclic aromatic structures consisting of C, O, H, and S atoms with the spectral signature of carbonyl, carboxylic acid, and lactone groups. However, the exact nature of the active sites remain elusive because of the lack of structure&ndash;activity relationship and characterization studies using state-of-the-art, in situ/operando techniques.
