Sulfur-based alternative oxidants represent a promising avenue in the field of catalysis, particularly for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene. This process is crucial in the petrochemical industry due to propylene's wide range of applications in plastics, synthetic fibers, and solvents. The use of sulfur-based oxidants offers several advantages over traditional oxygen-based methods, including enhanced selectivity and reduced environmental impact. However, this approach is not without its challenges.

One of the primary benefits of sulfur-based oxidants is their ability to improve the selectivity towards propylene, potentially leading to higher yields and lower byproduct formation compared to conventional oxygen-based oxidation. Additionally, sulfur-based oxidants can facilitate more efficient reactions under milder conditions, which could lead to lower energy consumption and reduced operational costs. Furthermore, they offer a more sustainable solution as sulfur dioxide emissions can be captured and recycled or converted into valuable sulfuric acid, aligning with global efforts to reduce carbon footprints and promote circular economy principles.

Despite these potential benefits, there are significant challenges that need to be addressed for sulfur-based oxidants to reach their full potential in ODHP. One major hurdle is the stability of sulfur-based oxidants under high temperatures and pressures, which are typical conditions in industrial processes. Sulfur compounds can decompose or lose their effectiveness, necessitating the development of robust catalysts that maintain their performance over extended periods. Another challenge lies in the selectivity of the reaction; while sulfur-based oxidants may enhance propylene formation, they also risk increasing the formation of unwanted byproducts such as carbon monoxide or sulfur-containing compounds, which require further purification steps.

Future directions for catalyst design optimization should focus on enhancing the stability and selectivity of sulfur-based oxidants. Researchers are exploring the use of novel materials and structures, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), layered double hydroxides (LDHs), and supported catalysts, to improve the efficiency of sulfur-based oxidants. Additionally, understanding the reaction mechanisms at the molecular level is crucial for developing strategies to control product distribution and maximize propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation. Collaborative efforts between academia, industry, and governmental bodies are essential to overcome these challenges and pave the way for the successful commercial implementation of sulfur-based oxidants in the ODHP process.
