Comparing the effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) with conventional oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene, the study found that sulfur-based oxidants had varying impacts on propylene yield. Challenges associated with these oxidants included the formation of byproducts. Future research focuses on enhancing catalyst design and optimizing the process efficiency.
