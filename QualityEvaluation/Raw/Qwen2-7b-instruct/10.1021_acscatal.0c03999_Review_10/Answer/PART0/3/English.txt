The study examined the use of alumina-supported vanadia catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Various sulfur-based oxidants such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were incorporated into the catalysts. These oxidants influenced propylene yield, while byproducts were also assessed. Challenges related to each oxidant, particularly concerning catalyst stability and selectivity, were identified. Future research aims to refine catalyst design to improve propylene production efficiency and reduce byproduct formation.

Using V2O5/A12O3 catalysts at short contact times for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene saw remarkable enhancement with the addition of H2S to the feed mixture. It has also been shown that the addition of mild oxidants like CO2 and N2O can effectively boost propene selectivity. However, adding H2S to the feed gas has not been explored in this context. Both parameters play a critical role in the current study's reaction conditions. Notably, significant amounts of S2 were observed in the product mix, suggesting a higher reaction rate of O2 with H2S compared to hydrocarbons. This indicates that S2 can function as an active species similar to O2, enabling selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, as proposed in scheme 1, where H2S is recovered and COx products are significantly reduced.
