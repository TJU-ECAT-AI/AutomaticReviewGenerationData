          [2] "The catalysts were modified with various sulfur-based oxidants including H2S, S2, and SO2."
          [3] "The impact of these sulfur-based oxidants on propylene yield was evaluated."
          [4] "Byproducts formed during the reaction were also analyzed."
          [5] "The challenges associated with each oxidant were discussed, including their effect on catalyst stability and selectivity."
          [6] "Future research directions focused on optimizing catalyst design to enhance propylene yield and minimize byproduct formation."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene at short contact times over V2O5/A12O3 was remarkably enhanced by the introduction of H2S in the feed mixture."
          [2] "However, it has been shown that the addition of some mild oxidants, such as CO2 and N2O,can effectively promote the selectivity for propene."
          [3] "While the use of gas-phase promoters has been considered in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, addition of H2S to the feed gas has not been investigated to our knowledge."
          [4] "The obtained results show the importance of both of these parameters in the reaction conditions used for the present study."
          [5] "Indeed, considerable amounts of S2 have been observed in the product mixture in the present study, which would indicate that the rate of reaction of O2 with H2S is much greater than with hydrocarbon."
          [6] "The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1, in which H2S is recovered and the COx products are significantly suppressed."
