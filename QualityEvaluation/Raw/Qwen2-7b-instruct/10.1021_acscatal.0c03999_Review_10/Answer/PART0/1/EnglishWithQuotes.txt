The sulfur-based oxidants, including H2S, S2, and SO2, are evaluated based on their impact on propylene yield and the challenges they pose, such as byproduct formation. Challenges include managing the byproducts formed during the oxidative process, optimizing the catalyst design to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted reactions, and enhancing the overall efficiency of the ODHP process.
