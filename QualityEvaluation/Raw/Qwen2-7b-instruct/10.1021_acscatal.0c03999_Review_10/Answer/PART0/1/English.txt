Comparing sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, this study reveals that these sulfur-based oxidants influence propylene yield differently. Challenges such as byproduct formation accompany their use, necessitating further investigation into catalyst design optimization to enhance the overall process efficiency.

Recent efforts to produce hydrogen and sulfur from hydrogen sulfide have gained attention. Our lab successfully demonstrated that H2S can be converted into sulfur, H2O, and H2 through catalytic partial oxidation at a 4:1 H2S/O2 ratio using α- or γ-alumina catalysts at short contact times. Significant amounts of S2 were observed in the product mix, indicating a faster reaction rate of O2 with H2S compared to hydrocarbons. This suggests that S2 can act as an active species similar to O2, enabling selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Overall, the presence of H2S in short contact time processes is a promising method for enhancing propene yield.

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene is compared with conventional oxidants. The sulfur-based oxidants, including H2S, S2, and SO2, are evaluated based on their impact on propylene yield and the challenges they pose, such as byproduct formation. Challenges include managing the byproducts formed during the oxidative process, optimizing the catalyst design to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted reactions, and enhancing the overall efficiency of the ODHP process. Future research aims to improve catalyst design, optimize process parameters, and develop more efficient sulfur-based oxidants to enhance propylene production while mitigating potential byproduct formation and catalyst deactivation.
