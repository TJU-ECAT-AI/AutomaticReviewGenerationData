[1] "In recent years, attempts to produce both hydrogen and sulfur from hydrogen sulfide have received considerable attention."
          [2] "Work in our laboratory has further successfully demonstrated that H2S can be effectively converted into a mixture of sulfur, H2O and H2 by catalytic partial oxidation at a 4:l H2S/O2 ratio using either α- or γ - alumina catalysts at short contact times."
          [3] "Indeed, considerable amounts of S2 have been observed in the product mixture in the present study, which would indicate that the rate of reaction of O2 with H2S is much greater than with hydrocarbon."
          [4] "The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1."
          [5] "In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact time is a highly promising route for improving propene yield."

[1] "We have studied the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene over heavily sulfided Ni catalysts at 873 K."
          [2] "In the absence of sulfur but in the presence of hydrogen, supported metallic nickel catalyzes the rapid hydrogenolysis of alkanes, resulting in exceedingly poor selectivity toward dehydrogenation products."
          [3] "However, the hydrogenolysis activity can be essentially eliminated by proper sulfidation, resulting in high selectivity toward isobutylene production."
          [4] "Due to thermodynamic limitations, elevated temperatures are necessary to attain reasonable conversions to isobutylene."
          [5] "Under these conditions, the formation of coke is rapid and is the main cause of catalyst deactivation."
          [6] "Treatment of nickel catalysts with relatively large mounts of sulfur-containing reagents results not only in dramatically improved selectivity but also in a decreased rate of coke formation."
