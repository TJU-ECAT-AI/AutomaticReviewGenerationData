          [1] "In this study, we investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over alumina-supported vanadia catalysts."
          [2] "The results showed that the addition of carbon dioxide (CO2) and secondary surface metal oxide additives significantly improved the propylene yield."
          [3] "However, the use of sulfur-based oxidants such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) resulted in lower propylene yields compared to conventional oxidants."
          [4] "The formation of byproducts, including mercaptans and thioalkylates, was also observed with sulfur-based oxidants."
          [5] "For future research, the focus should be on optimizing the catalyst design to enhance propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation."

          The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was compared to conventional oxidants. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were found to have lower propylene yields than conventional oxidants. These sulfur-based oxidants led to the formation of byproducts like mercaptans and thioalkylates. Future research should aim to optimize catalyst design to increase propylene yield while reducing byproduct formation.
