          [2] "The results showed that the addition of carbon dioxide (CO2) and secondary surface metal oxide additives significantly improved the propylene yield."
          [3] "However, the use of sulfur-based oxidants such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) resulted in lower propylene yields compared to conventional oxidants."
          [4] "The formation of byproducts, including mercaptans and thioalkylates, was also observed with sulfur-based oxidants."
          [5] "For future research, the focus should be on optimizing the catalyst design to enhance propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation."

[1] "Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30%."
          [2] "However, most of these studies are based on noble metal Pt catalyst systems,with little work having been done on vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts."
          [3] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly."
          [4] "With H2S in the feed mixture, up to 70% selectivity to propene could be achieved with a conversion of 28.1% propane at 700 C."
          [5] "Overall the yield of propene was noted to increase (dashed line in figure 1B) with an increase in the temperature, although the selectivity to propene declined significantly."
