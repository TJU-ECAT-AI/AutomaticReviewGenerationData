The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was compared to conventional oxidants. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), disulfide (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were found to have lower propylene yields than conventional oxidants. These sulfur-based oxidants led to the formation of byproducts like mercaptans and thioalkylates. Future research should aim to optimize catalyst design to increase propylene yield while reducing byproduct formation.

In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, there are significant selectivity losses with increased conversion, primarily due to the re-adsorption of propene and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides, leading to a typical propene yield below 30%. Most existing studies rely on noble metal catalysts, particularly platinum, with limited exploration into vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts. Adding H2S to the feed mixture notably reduced the formation of COx, C2H4, and CH4, enhancing propene selectivity and yield. Achieving up to 70% selectivity for propene with 28.1% propane conversion at 700°C was possible with H2S. Although propene yield increased with temperature (as indicated by the dashed line in Figure 1B), propene selectivity significantly decreased.

This study focuses on understanding the catalytic mechanisms of alkane oxychlorination through the perspective of energy levels. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 are frequently used. These oxidants might lead to the formation of byproducts that can influence propylene selectivity and yield. Future research should concentrate on enhancing catalyst design, increasing energy efficiency, and minimizing byproduct production.
