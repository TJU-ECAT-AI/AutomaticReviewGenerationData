Most existing studies rely on noble metal catalysts, particularly platinum, with limited exploration into vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts. Adding H2S to the feed mixture notably reduced the formation of COx, C2H4, and CH4, enhancing propene selectivity and yield. Achieving up to 70% selectivity for propene with 28.1% propane conversion at 700°C was possible with H2S. Although propene yield increased with temperature (as indicated by the dashed line in Figure 1B), propene selectivity significantly decreased.", "Chinese": "在丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的过程中，随着转化率的增加，选择性损失显著，主要是由于丙烯的再吸附及其随后氧化为二氧化碳，导致丙烯产率通常低于30%。大多数现有研究依赖于贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，对钒或钼基氧化物催化剂的研究较少。将H2S加入到反应气体中显著减少了COx、C2H4和CH4的生成，提高了丙烯的选择性和产率。即使在28.1%的丙烷转化率和700°C下，H2S的存在也有可能实现高达70%的丙烯选择性。尽管随着温度的升高（如图1B中的虚线所示），丙烯产率有所增加，但丙烯选择性显著下降。", "Doi": "10.1080/17415990412331327909"},
