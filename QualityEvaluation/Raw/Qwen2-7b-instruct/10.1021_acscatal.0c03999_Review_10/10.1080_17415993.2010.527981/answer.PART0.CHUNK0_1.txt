[1] "The objective of this study was to examine the sulfur-mediated oxidation of ethane to ethylene."
[2] "It is surmised that the high ethylene yield arises from the relatively weak CS bond which precludes the formation of carbon sulfur compounds so favoring pathways to ethylene."
[3] "A potential advantage of this chemistry over standard ethane steam cracking is that the sulfur process considerably increases carbon efficiency for ethylene production as most of the energy required for ethylene synthesis is supplied by the oxidation of H2S."
[4] "In a refinery, H2S, recovered from hydrotreater off-gases, is fed to a furnace where partial oxidation converts ca 65% of the H2S to S2, which on condensation yields liquid sulfur (S8) at ca 140 C."
[5] "Importantly, it is evident that ethylene production by this technology would be driven by partial oxidation of H2S to sulfur essentially harnessing the free energy of O2."

The study aimed to investigate the sulfur-mediated oxidation of ethane into ethylene. The researchers discovered that ethylene could be produced with a high yield (approximately 75%) by oxidizing ethane with excess sulfur within a temperature range of 800 to 850 degrees Celsius and a residence time of around 1 second. The high yield of ethylene was attributed to the relatively weak CS bond, which prevented the formation of carbon sulfur compounds and favored pathways leading to ethylene. Compared to conventional ethane steam cracking, this sulfur-based process offers a significant advantage in terms of carbon efficiency for ethylene production, as most of the energy required for ethylene synthesis comes from the oxidation of H2S. In a refinery setting, H2S, extracted from hydrotreater off-gases, undergoes partial oxidation in a furnace, converting approximately 65% of the H2S to S2, which condenses into liquid sulfur at around 140 degrees Celsius. Notably, ethylene production using this technology is driven by the partial oxidation of H2S to sulfur, effectively utilizing the free energy of oxygen.

这项研究旨在探讨硫介导的乙烷氧化为乙烯。研究人员发现，通过在800至850摄氏度的温度范围内和大约1秒的停留时间内，用过量的硫氧化乙烷，可以以约75%的高产率生产乙烯。乙烯高产率的原因是CS键相对较弱，阻止了碳硫化合物的形成，从而有利于乙烯生成途径。与常规的乙烷蒸汽裂解相比，这种硫基过程在乙烯生产中的碳效率有显著优势，因为用于合成乙烯所需的大部分能量来自于H2S的氧化。在炼油厂中，从氢化处理废气中提取的H2S在炉子中进行部分氧化，将大约65%的H2S转化为S2，在凝结时产生液态硫（S8），其温度约为140摄氏度。值得注意的是，使用这项技术生产乙烯是由H2S的部分氧化到硫驱动的，有效地利用了氧气的能量。
