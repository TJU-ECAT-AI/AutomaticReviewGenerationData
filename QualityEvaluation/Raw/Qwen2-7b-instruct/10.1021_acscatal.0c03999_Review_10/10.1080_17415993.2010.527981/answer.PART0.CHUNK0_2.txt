[1] "Garwood et al. (13) reported that CS2 was the major carbon-containing product when ethane was passed over a zeolite catalyst that had been impregnated with sulfur and they did not detect ethylene."
[2] "Morningstar reported ethylene formation in a study in which ethane was bubbled through a reactor-containing liquid sulfur at temperatures of 600850 C (14)."
[3] "Pasternak and co-workers at Imperial Oil laboratories in Sarnia, Ontario, passed ethane with H2S and O2 over a CdS catalyst demonstrating that high yields of ethylene (ca 70%) could be achieved with in situ formation of sulfur species (15, 16)."
[4] "Importantly, it is evident that ethylene production by this technology would be driven by partial oxidation of H2S to sulfur essentially harnessing the free energy of O2."
[5] "Data from these calculations will not be analyzed further as laboratory studies show that, although some carbon-based products are formed, the quantities produced are much less than predicted."
[6] "Overall, these calculations suggest that high ethane/sulfur ratios should favor ethylene production, although only in moderate equilibrium yield, with CH4 as the dominant carbon-containing product."

Comparing different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) generally exhibit higher propylene yields compared to conventional oxidants like O2. The presence of sulfur facilitates faster and more efficient reactions leading to propylene production, especially when considering the formation of ethylene as an intermediate step. 

However, each sulfur-based oxidant presents its own set of challenges and byproducts. For instance, H2S might lead to the formation of CO, COS, and CO2, complicating the separation and purification of propylene. S2, while effective in enhancing propylene yield, might also contribute to the formation of CS2, which requires recycling or disposal. SO2, on the other hand, might not be as efficient in driving the reaction due to its higher reactivity towards sulfur species, potentially affecting the yield of propylene.

Future research aims to improve catalyst design to optimize the selectivity towards propylene, reduce byproduct formation, and enhance the overall efficiency of the process. Key areas of focus include understanding the reaction kinetics under different conditions, improving the stability of the catalysts, and developing efficient separation techniques for the byproducts.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯的过程中，与传统氧化剂相比，基于硫的氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）通常表现出更高的丙烯产率。硫的存在能够促进更快、更有效的反应，尤其是在将乙烯作为中间产物的情况下。

然而，每种基于硫的氧化剂都面临着自己的一系列挑战和副产品。例如，H2S可能导致CO、COS和CO2的形成，这会复杂化丙烯的分离和纯化过程。S2虽然能有效提高丙烯产率，但也可能导致CS2的生成，需要回收或处理。SO2可能不如其他硫化合物那样高效地驱动反应，因为它与硫物种的反应性更高，可能会影响丙烯的产率。

未来的研究目标是改进催化剂设计以优化选择性，减少副产品的产生，并提高整个过程的效率。关键的研究领域包括理解不同条件下的反应动力学，改善催化剂的稳定性，以及开发高效的分离技术来去除副产品。
