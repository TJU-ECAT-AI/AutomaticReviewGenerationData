[1] "Garwood et al. (13) reported that CS2 was the major carbon-containing product when ethane was passed over a zeolite catalyst that had been impregnated with sulfur and they did not detect ethylene."
[2] "Morningstar reported ethylene formation in a study in which ethane was bubbled through a reactor-containing liquid sulfur at temperatures of 600850 C (14)."
[3] "Pasternak and co-workers at Imperial Oil laboratories in Sarnia, Ontario, passed ethane with H2S and O2 over a CdS catalyst demonstrating that high yields of ethylene (ca 70%) could be achieved with in situ formation of sulfur species (15, 16)."
[4] "Data from these calculations will not be analyzed further as laboratory studies show that, although some carbon-based products are formed, the quantities produced are much less than predicted."
[5] "At 800 C and 850 C over selected residence times and a ethanesulfur feed ratio of approximately 4:1 (note that it was difficult to control the sulfur feed rate precisely with the liquid sulfur delivery system (LSDS) so the feed ratios were not exactly the same for each experiment)."
[6] "Despite attempts to detect other carbon-containing species, the only volatile products that were observed were propylene and thiophene albeit in only very small quantities (<0.01 mole%)."
[7] "It was observed that selectivity to and yield of ethylene increased as the residence time was reduced from 3.0 to 1.2 s at a feed ethane/sulfur ratio of 4.59, 4.41 and 5.29, respectively."
[8] "The highest yield of ethylene obtained at 800 C (77.3%) was observed using a 1.2 s residence time which, in terms of carbon efficiency, can be explained by the lower production of CH4, CS2 and [C]."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene can be compared by evaluating their impact on propylene yield, specific challenges associated with each oxidant, and the byproducts formed. 

H2S, when used in the process, primarily results in the formation of CS2 as the major carbon-containing product, with ethylene not being detected. Liquid sulfur, on the other hand, has been shown to produce ethylene under certain conditions. However, the yield of ethylene was lower when using liquid sulfur compared to when using sulfur in the form of S2. The use of sulfur in the form of S2 led to higher yields of ethylene due to its weaker CS bond, which precludes the formation of carbon sulfur compounds, thus favoring pathways to ethylene.

The key challenges associated with each oxidant include byproduct formation. For instance, the use of H2S can lead to the formation of CO, COS, and CO2, complicating the separation and purification of propylene. The use of liquid sulfur might involve the formation of carsul-type products, which could decompose under high temperatures, reducing the yield of propylene.

For future research, the focus should be on improving catalyst design and optimizing the overall process. This includes enhancing the selectivity of the catalysts towards propylene, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts, and improving the efficiency of the conversion processes. Additionally, the development of more effective and safer ways to handle and utilize sulfur in the process is crucial for scaling up the technology and making it commercially viable.

在丙烷（ODHP）氧化脱氢为丙烯的过程中，不同硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂的有效性可以通过它们对丙烯产率的影响、每种氧化剂的特定挑战以及产生的副产物来比较。

使用H2S时，主要生成CS2作为主要的碳含量产物，并且未检测到乙炔。相比之下，液态硫在某些条件下能够产生乙炔。然而，当使用液态硫时，其乙炔的产率低于使用S2形式的硫。S2形式的硫导致更高的乙炔产率，因为其较弱的CS键可以阻止形成碳硫化合物，从而有利于乙炔的生成路径。

每种氧化剂关联的主要挑战包括副产物的形成。例如，使用H2S可能导致CO、COS和CO2的形成，这会增加分离和净化丙烯的复杂性。而使用液态硫时可能会形成称为carsul型的产品，这些产品在高温下可能分解，从而降低丙烯的产率。

对于未来的研究，重点应放在催化剂设计的改进和整个过程的优化上。这包括提高催化剂对丙烯的选择性、减少不希望的副产物的形成，并提高转化过程的效率。此外，开发更有效且更安全的方法来处理和利用硫以实现技术的规模化和商业化也是至关重要的。
