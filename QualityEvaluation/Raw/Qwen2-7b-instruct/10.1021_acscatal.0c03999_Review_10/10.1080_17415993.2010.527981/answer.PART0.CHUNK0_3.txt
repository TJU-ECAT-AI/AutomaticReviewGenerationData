[1] "The objective of this study was to examine the sulfur-mediated oxidation of ethane to ethylene."
[2] "In summary, it has been found that ethylene can be produced in high yield (ca 75%) by the oxidation of ethane with excess sulfur in the 800-850 C temperature range using a residence time of about 1 s."
[3] "It is surmised that the high ethylene yield arises from the relatively weak CS bond which precludes the formation of carbon sulfur compounds so favoring pathways to ethylene."
[4] "Most of the world's ethylene arises from steam cracking of ethane and more complex hydrocarbon mixtures, although it can also be recovered from off-gases from refinery catalytic cracking and coking units."
[5] "In a refinery, H2S, recovered from hydrotreater off-gases, is fed to a furnace where partial oxidation converts ca 65% of the H2S to S2, which on condensation yields liquid sulfur (S8) at ca 140 C."
[6] "The primary condensation of sulfur from the combustion stage then acts as the air separation equivalent."
[7] "Clearly, excess heat energy is produced from H2S oxidation for the conversion, although it should also be noted that pre-heat of the ethane and sulfur feeds will also be required, with heat recovery from the product stream necessary to maintain heat balance for the overall process."
[8] "As an aid to the experimental design, equilibrium calculations were conducted allowing for the absence or presence of solid carbon as a product (Table 1)."
[9] "Importantly, it is evident that ethylene production by this technology would be driven by partial oxidation of H2S to sulfur essentially harnessing the free energy of O2."

The study aimed to investigate the sulfur-mediated oxidation of ethane to ethylene. It was discovered that ethylene could be produced in a high yield (approximately 75%) by oxidizing ethane with excess sulfur within the 800-850°C temperature range, utilizing a residence time of around 1 second. The high yield of ethylene is attributed to the relatively weak CS bond, which prevents the formation of carbon sulfur compounds, thus favoring pathways leading to ethylene. Ethylene production via this method harnesses the free energy of oxygen, particularly through the partial oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to sulfur. This process also benefits from the heat energy produced from the oxidation of H2S, which is utilized for the conversion, requiring additional preheating of ethane and sulfur feeds. Moreover, heat recovery from the product stream is essential for maintaining heat balance throughout the entire process.

本研究旨在探讨硫介导的乙烷氧化为乙烯。发现通过在800-850°C的温度范围内使用约1秒的停留时间，以过量的硫氧化乙烷可以产生高产率（大约75%）的乙烯。乙烯产率高的原因是相对较弱的CS键阻止了碳硫化合物的形成，从而有利于乙烯的生成途径。通过这种方法生产乙烯，特别是通过氢化物硫（H2S）的氧化至硫来获取氧气的自由能量。此过程还从H2S的氧化中产生热量，用于转化，并需要对乙烷和硫的进料进行额外预热。此外，产品流的热量回收对于整个过程的热平衡至关重要。
