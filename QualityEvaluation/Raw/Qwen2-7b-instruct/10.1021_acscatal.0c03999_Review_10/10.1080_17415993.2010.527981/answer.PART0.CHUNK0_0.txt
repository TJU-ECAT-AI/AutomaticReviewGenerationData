[1] "The objective of this study was to examine the sulfur-mediated oxidation of ethane to ethylene."
[2] "It has been found that ethylene can be produced in high yield (ca 75%) by the oxidation of ethane with excess sulfur in the 800850 C temperature range using a residence time of about 1 s."
[3] "A potential advantage of this chemistry over standard ethane steam cracking is that the sulfur process considerably increases carbon efficiency for ethylene production as most of the energy required for ethylene synthesis is supplied by the oxidation of H2S."
[4] "In summary, it is concluded that ethylene formation occurs rapidly with further reaction of the product ethylene yielding methane, more complex carbon products [C] and CS2 at longer contact times."
[5] "Note, however, that the reference experiments were conducted using a 0.5 s residence time compared with 1.2 s for the sulfur-promoted reaction."

The study aimed to investigate the sulfur-mediated oxidation of ethane to ethylene. High yields of ethylene (approximately 75%) were observed when ethane was oxidized with excess sulfur at temperatures between 800 and 850°C and a residence time of around 1 second. The sulfur process offers an advantage over traditional ethane steam cracking by increasing carbon efficiency for ethylene production, as most of the energy needed for ethylene synthesis comes from the oxidation of H2S. It was concluded that ethylene formation occurs quickly, leading to further reactions that produce methane, more complex carbon compounds, and CS2 at longer contact times. The reference experiments, which used a shorter residence time of 0.5 seconds, yielded lower ethylene percentages compared to the sulfur-promoted reaction with a 1.2-second residence time.

本研究旨在探讨硫介导的乙烷氧化为乙烯。在800至850°C的温度范围内和约1秒的停留时间内，通过过量硫氧化乙烷，可以产生高比例的乙烯（大约75%）。与传统的乙烷蒸汽裂解相比，硫过程提高了乙烯生产的碳效率，因为合成乙烯所需的大部分能量来自于H2S的氧化。研究发现，乙烯形成迅速，导致在更长接触时间下进一步反应产生甲烷、更复杂的碳化合物和CS2。参考实验使用较短的停留时间为0.5秒，其乙烯产量低于使用1.2秒停留时间的硫促进反应。
