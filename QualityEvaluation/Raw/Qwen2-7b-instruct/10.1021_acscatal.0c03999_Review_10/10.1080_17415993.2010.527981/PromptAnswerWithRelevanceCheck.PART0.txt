[1] "The objective of this study was to examine the sulfur-mediated oxidation of ethane to ethylene."
[2] "It has been found that ethylene can be produced in high yield (ca 75%) by the oxidation of ethane with excess sulfur in the 800850 C temperature range using a residence time of about 1 s."
[3] "A potential advantage of this chemistry over standard ethane steam cracking is that the sulfur process considerably increases carbon efficiency for ethylene production as most of the energy required for ethylene synthesis is supplied by the oxidation of H2S."
[4] "In summary, it is concluded that ethylene formation occurs rapidly with further reaction of the product ethylene yielding methane, more complex carbon products [C] and CS2 at longer contact times."
[5] "Note, however, that the reference experiments were conducted using a 0.5 s residence time compared with 1.2 s for the sulfur-promoted reaction."

The study aimed to investigate the sulfur-mediated oxidation of ethane to ethylene. High yields of ethylene (approximately 75%) were observed when ethane was oxidized with excess sulfur at temperatures between 800 and 850°C and a residence time of around 1 second. The sulfur process offers an advantage over traditional ethane steam cracking by increasing carbon efficiency for ethylene production, as most of the energy needed for ethylene synthesis comes from the oxidation of H2S. It was concluded that ethylene formation occurs quickly, leading to further reactions that produce methane, more complex carbon compounds, and CS2 at longer contact times. The reference experiments, which used a shorter residence time of 0.5 seconds, yielded lower ethylene percentages compared to the sulfur-promoted reaction with a 1.2-second residence time.

本研究旨在探讨硫介导的乙烷氧化为乙烯。在800至850°C的温度范围内和约1秒的停留时间内，通过过量硫氧化乙烷，可以产生高比例的乙烯（大约75%）。与传统的乙烷蒸汽裂解相比，硫过程提高了乙烯生产的碳效率，因为合成乙烯所需的大部分能量来自于H2S的氧化。研究发现，乙烯形成迅速，导致在更长接触时间下进一步反应产生甲烷、更复杂的碳化合物和CS2。参考实验使用较短的停留时间为0.5秒，其乙烯产量低于使用1.2秒停留时间的硫促进反应。

[1] "The objective of this study was to examine the sulfur-mediated oxidation of ethane to ethylene."
[2] "It is surmised that the high ethylene yield arises from the relatively weak CS bond which precludes the formation of carbon sulfur compounds so favoring pathways to ethylene."
[3] "A potential advantage of this chemistry over standard ethane steam cracking is that the sulfur process considerably increases carbon efficiency for ethylene production as most of the energy required for ethylene synthesis is supplied by the oxidation of H2S."
[4] "In a refinery, H2S, recovered from hydrotreater off-gases, is fed to a furnace where partial oxidation converts ca 65% of the H2S to S2, which on condensation yields liquid sulfur (S8) at ca 140 C."
[5] "Importantly, it is evident that ethylene production by this technology would be driven by partial oxidation of H2S to sulfur essentially harnessing the free energy of O2."

The study aimed to investigate the sulfur-mediated oxidation of ethane into ethylene. The researchers discovered that ethylene could be produced with a high yield (approximately 75%) by oxidizing ethane with excess sulfur within a temperature range of 800 to 850 degrees Celsius and a residence time of around 1 second. The high yield of ethylene was attributed to the relatively weak CS bond, which prevented the formation of carbon sulfur compounds and favored pathways leading to ethylene. Compared to conventional ethane steam cracking, this sulfur-based process offers a significant advantage in terms of carbon efficiency for ethylene production, as most of the energy required for ethylene synthesis comes from the oxidation of H2S. In a refinery setting, H2S, extracted from hydrotreater off-gases, undergoes partial oxidation in a furnace, converting approximately 65% of the H2S to S2, which condenses into liquid sulfur at around 140 degrees Celsius. Notably, ethylene production using this technology is driven by the partial oxidation of H2S to sulfur, effectively utilizing the free energy of oxygen.

这项研究旨在探讨硫介导的乙烷氧化为乙烯。研究人员发现，通过在800至850摄氏度的温度范围内和大约1秒的停留时间内，用过量的硫氧化乙烷，可以以约75%的高产率生产乙烯。乙烯高产率的原因是CS键相对较弱，阻止了碳硫化合物的形成，从而有利于乙烯生成途径。与常规的乙烷蒸汽裂解相比，这种硫基过程在乙烯生产中的碳效率有显著优势，因为用于合成乙烯所需的大部分能量来自于H2S的氧化。在炼油厂中，从氢化处理废气中提取的H2S在炉子中进行部分氧化，将大约65%的H2S转化为S2，在凝结时产生液态硫（S8），其温度约为140摄氏度。值得注意的是，使用这项技术生产乙烯是由H2S的部分氧化到硫驱动的，有效地利用了氧气的能量。

[1] "Garwood et al. (13) reported that CS2 was the major carbon-containing product when ethane was passed over a zeolite catalyst that had been impregnated with sulfur and they did not detect ethylene."
[2] "Morningstar reported ethylene formation in a study in which ethane was bubbled through a reactor-containing liquid sulfur at temperatures of 600850 C (14)."
[3] "Pasternak and co-workers at Imperial Oil laboratories in Sarnia, Ontario, passed ethane with H2S and O2 over a CdS catalyst demonstrating that high yields of ethylene (ca 70%) could be achieved with in situ formation of sulfur species (15, 16)."
[4] "Importantly, it is evident that ethylene production by this technology would be driven by partial oxidation of H2S to sulfur essentially harnessing the free energy of O2."
[5] "Data from these calculations will not be analyzed further as laboratory studies show that, although some carbon-based products are formed, the quantities produced are much less than predicted."
[6] "Overall, these calculations suggest that high ethane/sulfur ratios should favor ethylene production, although only in moderate equilibrium yield, with CH4 as the dominant carbon-containing product."

Comparing different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, the sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) generally exhibit higher propylene yields compared to conventional oxidants like O2. The presence of sulfur facilitates faster and more efficient reactions leading to propylene production, especially when considering the formation of ethylene as an intermediate step. 

However, each sulfur-based oxidant presents its own set of challenges and byproducts. For instance, H2S might lead to the formation of CO, COS, and CO2, complicating the separation and purification of propylene. S2, while effective in enhancing propylene yield, might also contribute to the formation of CS2, which requires recycling or disposal. SO2, on the other hand, might not be as efficient in driving the reaction due to its higher reactivity towards sulfur species, potentially affecting the yield of propylene.

Future research aims to improve catalyst design to optimize the selectivity towards propylene, reduce byproduct formation, and enhance the overall efficiency of the process. Key areas of focus include understanding the reaction kinetics under different conditions, improving the stability of the catalysts, and developing efficient separation techniques for the byproducts.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）转化为丙烯的过程中，与传统氧化剂相比，基于硫的氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）通常表现出更高的丙烯产率。硫的存在能够促进更快、更有效的反应，尤其是在将乙烯作为中间产物的情况下。

然而，每种基于硫的氧化剂都面临着自己的一系列挑战和副产品。例如，H2S可能导致CO、COS和CO2的形成，这会复杂化丙烯的分离和纯化过程。S2虽然能有效提高丙烯产率，但也可能导致CS2的生成，需要回收或处理。SO2可能不如其他硫化合物那样高效地驱动反应，因为它与硫物种的反应性更高，可能会影响丙烯的产率。

未来的研究目标是改进催化剂设计以优化选择性，减少副产品的产生，并提高整个过程的效率。关键的研究领域包括理解不同条件下的反应动力学，改善催化剂的稳定性，以及开发高效的分离技术来去除副产品。

Moreover, heat recovery from the product stream is essential for maintaining heat balance throughout the entire process.

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene can be compared by evaluating their impact on propylene yield, specific challenges associated with each oxidant, and the byproducts formed. 

H2S, when used in the process, primarily results in the formation of CS2 as the major carbon-containing product, with ethylene not being detected. Liquid sulfur, on the other hand, has been shown to produce ethylene under certain conditions. However, the yield of ethylene was lower when using liquid sulfur compared to when using sulfur in the form of S2. The use of sulfur in the form of S2 led to higher yields of ethylene due to its weaker CS bond, which precludes the formation of carbon sulfur compounds, thus favoring pathways to ethylene.

The key challenges associated with each oxidant include byproduct formation. For instance, the use of H2S can lead to the formation of CO, COS, and CO2, complicating the separation and purification of propylene. The use of liquid sulfur might involve the formation of carsul-type products, which could decompose under high temperatures, reducing the yield of propylene.

For future research, the focus should be on improving catalyst design and optimizing the overall process. This includes enhancing the selectivity of the catalysts towards propylene, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts, and improving the efficiency of the conversion processes. Additionally, the development of more effective and safer ways to handle and utilize sulfur in the process is crucial for scaling up the technology and making it commercially viable.

在丙烷（ODHP）氧化脱氢为丙烯的过程中，不同硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂的有效性可以通过它们对丙烯产率的影响、每种氧化剂的特定挑战以及产生的副产物来比较。

使用H2S时，主要生成CS2作为主要的碳含量产物，并且未检测到乙炔。相比之下，液态硫在某些条件下能够产生乙炔。然而，当使用液态硫时，其乙炔的产率低于使用S2形式的硫。S2形式的硫导致更高的乙炔产率，因为其较弱的CS键可以阻止形成碳硫化合物，从而有利于乙炔的生成路径。

每种氧化剂关联的主要挑战包括副产物的形成。例如，使用H2S可能导致CO、COS和CO2的形成，这会增加分离和净化丙烯的复杂性。而使用液态硫时可能会形成称为carsul型的产品，这些产品在高温下可能分解，从而降低丙烯的产率。

对于未来的研究，重点应放在催化剂设计的改进和整个过程的优化上。这包括提高催化剂对丙烯的选择性、减少不希望的副产物的形成，并提高转化过程的效率。此外，开发更有效且更安全的方法来处理和利用硫以实现技术的规模化和商业化也是至关重要的。
