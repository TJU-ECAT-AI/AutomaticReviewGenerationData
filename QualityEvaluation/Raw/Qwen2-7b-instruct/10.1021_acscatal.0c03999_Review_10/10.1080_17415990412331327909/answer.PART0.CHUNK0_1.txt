<p>It has been demonstrated that the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact time is a highly promising route for improving propene yield.</p>
<p>Thus, an appropriate combination of both H2S in the feed and a short contact time can afford high yields of propene.</p>
<p>The obtained results show the importance of both of these parameters in the reaction conditions used for the present study.</p>
<p>The best propene yield achieved in this work was 30.4% over V2O5/A12O3 catalyst in the presence of H2S in the feed at 0.005 s contact time and 700 C.</p>
<p>In recent years attempts to produce both hydrogen and sulfur from hydrogen sulfide have received considerable attention.</p>
<p>Work in our laboratory has further successfully demonstrated that H2S can be effectively converted into a mixture of sulfur, H2O, and H2 by catalytic partial oxidation at a 4:1 H2S/O2 ratio using either α- or γ-alumina catalysts at short contact times.</p>
<p>In particular over the V2O5/A12O3 catalyst, it can be seen that the selectivity to COx when H2S is present in the feed gas was much lower than without H2S.</p>
<p>The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S suggests that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1.</p>
<p>The selectivity to COx when H2S is present in the feed gas was much lower than without H2S (table 2).</p>

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact time can significantly enhance propene yield. An appropriate combination of H2S in the feed and short contact time allows for high propene yields.

2. H2S, along with short contact times, is crucial for optimizing the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. This combination enables a high yield of propene.

3. The best propene yield obtained in this study was 30.4%, achieved over a V2O5/A12O3 catalyst with H2S in the feed at 0.005 seconds contact time and 700 degrees Celsius.

4. Efforts to produce hydrogen and sulfur from hydrogen sulfide have garnered significant attention recently. Our lab has successfully demonstrated that H2S can be converted into sulfur, water, and hydrogen through catalytic partial oxidation using either α- or γ-alumina catalysts at short contact times.

5. Over the V2O5/A12O3 catalyst, the presence of H2S in the feed gas significantly reduces the selectivity to COx, demonstrating its potential as an active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

6. The presence of H2S in the feed gas leads to a lower selectivity to COx compared to situations without H2S.

1. 在短停留时间下，通过在丙烷氧化脱氢化过程中加入H2S，可以显著提高丙烯产率。适当的H2S投料和短停留时间组合允许高丙烯产率。

2. H2S与短停留时间对于优化丙烷氧化脱氢化至丙烯至关重要。这种组合能够实现高丙烯产率。

3. 在本研究中获得的最佳丙烯产率为30.4%，在0.005秒停留时间和700摄氏度下，通过向V2O5/A12O3催化剂中添加H2S实现。

4. 近年来，从氢硫酸中制备氢气和硫磺的努力已经引起了广泛关注。我们的实验室成功地证明，通过使用α-或γ氧化铝催化剂在短停留时间内进行部分氧化，可以将H2S有效地转化为硫、水和氢。

5. 对于V2O5/A12O3催化剂，在含H2S的气体中，丙烯选择性显著降低，表明其有潜力作为丙烷氧化脱氢化至丙烯的活性物种。

6. 含有H2S的气体导致COx的选择性降低，与不含有H2S的情况相比。
