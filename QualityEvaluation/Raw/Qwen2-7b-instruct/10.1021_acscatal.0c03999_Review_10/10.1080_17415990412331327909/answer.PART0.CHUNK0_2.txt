<p>Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30% [36].</p>
<p>Therefore, it is still very challenging to be able to carry out the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with a high propene yield.</p>
<p>The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly.</p>
<p>As can be seen from table 2, nearly 50% selectivity to propene with 75.6% conversion of propane was obtained at 0.01s residence time, giving the highest propene yield of 37.6%.</p>
<p>In contrast, V2O5/A12O3 catalyst was found to be selective for the formation of COx, but not propene, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane without H2S at 700 C.</p>
<p>Indeed, when ethylene is taken into account with propene, it is notable that the V2O5/A12O3 catalyst offers an olefin selectivity of up to 81% at a high propane conversion.</p>
<p>Work in our laboratory has further successfully demonstrated that H2S can be effectively converted in to a mixture of sulfur, H2O and H2 by catalytic partial oxidation at a 4:l H2S/O2 ratio using either α- or γ - alumina catalysts at short contact times [16].</p>
<p>The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1, in which H2S is recovered and the COx products are significantly suppressed.</p>

1. In oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, propene yield typically drops below 30% due to extensive selectivity losses with increasing conversion, mainly caused by propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to CO and CO2. H2S in the feed gas significantly reduces COx, C2H4, and CH4, enhancing propene yield.

2. Catalyst V2O5/A12O3 without H2S showed selectivity for COx rather than propene during propane oxidative dehydrogenation at 700°C. 

3. When considering ethylene alongside propene, the V2O5/A12O3 catalyst offers a high olefin selectivity of up to 81% at high propane conversion.

4. Laboratory work demonstrates that H2S can be effectively converted into sulfur, H2O, and H2 via catalytic partial oxidation at a 4:1 H2S/O2 ratio using α- or γ-alumina catalysts at short contact times.

5. The presence of H2S in the reaction system allows for the recovery of H2S and significantly suppresses COx products, suggesting it acts as an active species similar to O2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯的过程中，随着转化率的增加，丙烯的产率通常会降至30%以下，主要原因是丙烯的再吸附及其随后氧化为CO和CO2导致选择性损失。在进料气体中添加H2S显著减少了COx、C2H4和CH4的生成，从而提高了丙烯的产率。

2. 在700°C下进行丙烷氧化脱氢反应时，催化剂V2O5/A12O3在没有H2S的情况下对COx的选择性较高，而非丙烯。

3. 当考虑与丙烯一起的乙烯时，V2O5/A12O3催化剂在高丙烷转化率下的烯烃选择性高达81%。

4. 实验室研究表明，通过使用α-或γ-氧化铝催化剂，在4:1的H2S/O2比例下进行催化部分氧化，可以在短接触时间内有效将H2S转化为硫、H2O和H2。

5. 反应系统中的H2S的存在允许回收H2S并显著抑制COx产品的生成，这表明它在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯过程中作为活性物种类似于O2起作用。
