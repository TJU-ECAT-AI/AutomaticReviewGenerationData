[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene at short contact times over V2O5/A12O3 was remarkably enhanced by the introduction of H2S in the feed mixture."
[2] "However, it has been shown that the addition of some mild oxidants, such as CO2 and N2O,can effectively promote the selectivity for propene."
[3] "While the use of gas-phase promoters has been considered in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, addition of H2S to the feed gas has not been investigated to our knowledge."
[4] "The obtained results show the importance of both of these parameters in the reaction conditions used for the present study."
[5] "Indeed, considerable amounts of S2 have been observed in the product mixture in the present study, which would indicate that the rate of reaction of O2 with H2S is much greater than with hydrocarbon."
[6] "The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1, in which H2S is recovered and the COx products are significantly suppressed."

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene varies significantly. H2S notably enhances propylene yield, particularly when added to the feed mixture, resulting in a higher selectivity for propene with a significant reduction in side products like COx, C2H4, and CH4. Compared to conventional oxidants, H2S introduces benefits such as improved propylene selectivity and yield at shorter contact times. S2, generated from the reaction of O2 with H2S, acts similarly to O2, facilitating the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, the challenge lies in managing the formation of byproducts, which requires further research to develop catalysts that can efficiently suppress unwanted reactions. Future research aims to improve catalyst design, optimize reaction conditions, and potentially explore other sulfur-based oxidants to enhance propylene yield and selectivity in ODHP processes.

不同硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯（ODHP）过程中的效果存在显著差异。硫化氢（H2S）的引入特别能显著提高丙烯的产率，特别是在添加到反应物混合气体中时，可以显著提升丙烯的选择性，并大幅减少副产物如COx、C2H4和CH4的生成。与传统氧化剂相比，H2S带来的优势包括在较短接触时间内获得更高的丙烯选择性和产率。产生的S2作为类似氧气的活性物种，能促进选择性氧化脱氢反应，有助于丙烷转化为丙烯，同时显著抑制COx等副产品的生成。然而，管理副产物的形成仍然是一个挑战，需要进一步研究开发能够高效抑制非期望反应的催化剂。未来的研究目标是改进催化剂设计、优化反应条件，并有可能探索其他硫基氧化剂，以增强ODHP过程中的丙烯产率和选择性。
