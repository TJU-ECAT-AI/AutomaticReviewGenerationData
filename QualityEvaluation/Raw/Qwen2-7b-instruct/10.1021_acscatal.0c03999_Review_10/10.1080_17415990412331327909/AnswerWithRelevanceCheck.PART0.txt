          [1] "In recent years, attempts to produce both hydrogen and sulfur from hydrogen sulfide have received considerable attention."
          [2] "Work in our laboratory has further successfully demonstrated that H2S can be effectively converted into a mixture of sulfur, H2O and H2 by catalytic partial oxidation at a 4:l H2S/O2 ratio using either α- or γ - alumina catalysts at short contact times."
          [3] "Indeed, considerable amounts of S2 have been observed in the product mixture in the present study, which would indicate that the rate of reaction of O2 with H2S is much greater than with hydrocarbon."
          [4] "The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1."
          [5] "In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact time is a highly promising route for improving propene yield."

          Recent efforts to produce hydrogen and sulfur from hydrogen sulfide have gained attention. Our lab successfully demonstrated that H2S can be converted into sulfur, H2O, and H2 through catalytic partial oxidation at a 4:1 H2S/O2 ratio using α- or γ-alumina catalysts at short contact times. Significant amounts of S2 were observed in the product mix, indicating a faster reaction rate of O2 with H2S compared to hydrocarbons. This suggests that S2 can act as an active species similar to O2, enabling selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Overall, the presence of H2S in short contact time processes is a promising method for enhancing propene yield.

          近年来，从氢硫酸中生产氢气和硫磺的努力引起了关注。我们的实验室成功展示了，通过使用α-或γ氧化铝催化剂，在短接触时间内，以4:1的H2S/O2比例进行部分催化氧化，H2S可以转化为硫、H2O和H2。在当前研究中观察到了大量S2，这表明氧气与H2S的反应速率远大于与碳氢化合物的反应速率。这表明S2可以作为一个类似于氧气的活性物种，用于执行选择性的丙烷氧化脱氢反应，将丙烷转化为丙烯。总的来说，短接触时间过程中H2S的存在是一种提高丙烯产率的有前景的方法。

          [1] "Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30%."
          [2] "However, most of these studies are based on noble metal Pt catalyst systems,with little work having been done on vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts."
          [3] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly."
          [4] "With H2S in the feed mixture, up to 70% selectivity to propene could be achieved with a conversion of 28.1% propane at 700 C."
          [5] "Overall the yield of propene was noted to increase (dashed line in figure 1B) with an increase in the temperature, although the selectivity to propene declined significantly."

          In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, there are significant selectivity losses with increased conversion, primarily due to the re-adsorption of propene and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides, leading to a typical propene yield below 30%. Most existing studies rely on noble metal catalysts, particularly platinum, with limited exploration into vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts. Adding H2S to the feed mixture notably reduced the formation of COx, C2H4, and CH4, enhancing propene selectivity and yield. Achieving up to 70% selectivity for propene with 28.1% propane conversion at 700°C was possible with H2S. Although propene yield increased with temperature (as indicated by the dashed line in Figure 1B), propene selectivity significantly decreased.

          在丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的过程中，随着转化率的增加，选择性损失显著，主要是由于丙烯的再吸附及其随后氧化为二氧化碳，导致丙烯产率通常低于30%。大多数现有研究依赖于贵金属催化剂，特别是铂，对钒或钼基氧化物催化剂的研究较少。将H2S加入到反应气体中显著减少了COx、C2H4和CH4的生成，提高了丙烯的选择性和产率。即使在28.1%的丙烷转化率和700°C下，H2S的存在也有可能实现高达70%的丙烯选择性。尽管随着温度的升高（如图1B中的虚线所示），丙烯产率有所增加，但丙烯选择性显著下降。

          [1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene at short contact times over V2O5/A12O3 was remarkably enhanced by the introduction of H2S in the feed mixture."
          [2] "However, it has been shown that the addition of some mild oxidants, such as CO2 and N2O,can effectively promote the selectivity for propene."
          [3] "While the use of gas-phase promoters has been considered in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, addition of H2S to the feed gas has not been investigated to our knowledge."
          [4] "The obtained results show the importance of both of these parameters in the reaction conditions used for the present study."
          [5] "Indeed, considerable amounts of S2 have been observed in the product mixture in the present study, which would indicate that the rate of reaction of O2 with H2S is much greater than with hydrocarbon."
          [6] "The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1, in which H2S is recovered and the COx products are significantly suppressed."

          Using V2O5/A12O3 catalysts at short contact times for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene saw remarkable enhancement with the addition of H2S to the feed mixture. It has also been shown that the addition of mild oxidants like CO2 and N2O can effectively boost propene selectivity. However, adding H2S to the feed gas has not been explored in this context. Both parameters play a critical role in the current study's reaction conditions. Notably, significant amounts of S2 were observed in the product mix, suggesting a higher reaction rate of O2 with H2S compared to hydrocarbons. This indicates that S2 can function as an active species similar to O2, enabling selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, as proposed in scheme 1, where H2S is recovered and COx products are significantly reduced.

          使用V2O5/A12O3催化剂在短接触时间下进行丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯，通过在反应气体中添加H2S，取得了显著的增强效果。已证实添加轻度氧化剂，如CO2和N2O，可以有效提升丙烯的选择性。然而，将H2S加入到反应气体中在这一背景下尚未进行过研究。这两个参数在当前研究的反应条件下都起着关键作用。值得注意的是，在产品混合物中观察到了大量S2，这表明氧气与H2S的反应速率远大于与碳氢化合物的反应速率。这表明S2可以作为一个类似于氧气的活性物种，用于执行选择性的丙烷氧化脱氢反应，将丙烷转化为丙烯，正如在方案1中所建议的，其中H2S被回收，COx产物得到了显著的抑制。
