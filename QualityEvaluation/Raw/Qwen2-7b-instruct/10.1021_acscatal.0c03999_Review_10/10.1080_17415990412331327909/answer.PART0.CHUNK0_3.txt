[1] "Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30%."
[2] "However, most of these studies are based on noble metal Pt catalyst systems,with little work having been done on vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts."
[3] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly."
[4] "With H2S in the feed mixture, up to 70% selectivity to propene could be achieved with a conversion of 28.1% propane at 700 C."
[5] "Overall the yield of propene was noted to increase (dashed line in figure 1B) with an increase in the temperature, although the selectivity to propene declined significantly."

1. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity decreases with increasing conversion, primarily due to the re-adsorption of propene followed by its oxidation to carbon oxides, resulting in propene yields typically below 30%. 

2. Most previous studies focused on noble metal catalysts like platinum, with limited exploration of vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts.

3. The addition of H2S to the feed gas notably reduced the formation of COx, C2H4, and CH4, enhancing propene selectivity and yield.

4. Incorporating H2S into the feed mixture allowed for up to 70% selectivity to propene, even at a propane conversion of 28.1% at 700°C.

5. Despite the increase in propene yield with temperature, the selectivity to propene declined significantly.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯的过程中，随着转化率的增加，选择性降低，主要原因是丙烯的再吸附和随后的氧化生成二氧化碳，导致丙烯产率通常低于30%。

2. 大多数先前的研究集中在贵金属催化剂上，如铂，对于钒或钼基氧化物催化剂的研究较少。

3. 向反应气体中加入H2S显著减少了COx、C2H4和CH4的生成，提高了丙烯的选择性和产率。

4. 将H2S加入到反应气体中，即使在28.1%的丙烷转化率下，也能实现高达70%的丙烯选择性，温度为700°C。

5. 尽管随着温度的升高，丙烯产率增加，但丙烯的选择性显著下降。
