[1] "In recent years, attempts to produce both hydrogen and sulfur from hydrogen sulfide have received considerable attention."
[2] "Work in our laboratory has further successfully demonstrated that H2S can be effectively converted into a mixture of sulfur, H2O and H2 by catalytic partial oxidation at a 4:l H2S/O2 ratio using either α- or γ - alumina catalysts at short contact times."
[3] "Indeed, considerable amounts of S2 have been observed in the product mixture in the present study, which would indicate that the rate of reaction of O2 with H2S is much greater than with hydrocarbon."
[4] "The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1."
[5] "In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact time is a highly promising route for improving propene yield."

1. The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene varies significantly. H2S notably enhances propylene yield, suppresses over-oxidation, and recycles itself through reactions, making it a promising promoter. S2, as a product of H2S oxidation, acts similarly to O2 in facilitating propylene formation. SO2, though potentially reactive, is not mentioned in this context. Challenges include managing byproduct formation and optimizing catalyst design for efficient sulfur utilization.

2. Key challenges for sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP include byproduct formation, such as COx, which requires suppression. S2, an active species, helps in selective propylene formation, but its management is crucial. Future research aims to improve catalyst design for better sulfur utilization and byproduct control.

3. Future research directions focus on identifying more active and selective catalysts for ODHP in the presence of H2S. Efforts aim to enhance propene yield while minimizing byproducts. Understanding the precise role of H2S in propylene formation through catalytic reactions is essential.

4. The effectiveness of H2S in ODHP lies in its ability to enhance propylene yield, suppress over-oxidation, and recycle through reactions. Key areas for improvement involve catalyst optimization, byproduct management, and enhancing the efficiency of sulfur utilization in the process.

5. The presence of H2S in the feed mixture significantly improves the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene at short contact times, offering a promising route for enhancing propene yield. This finding underscores the potential of sulfur-based oxidants in this chemical process, with implications for improving overall efficiency and sustainability.

1. 近年来，从氢硫酸中生产氢和硫的方法引起了广泛关注。我们的实验室成功展示了，在短接触时间内，通过催化部分氧化，利用α-或γ-氧化铝催化剂将氢硫酸转化为硫、水和氢的混合物。大量S2在产品混合物中被观察到，表明氧气与氢硫酸的反应速率远高于与碳氢化合物的反应速率。因此，近全部氧气被氢硫酸消耗，这表明S2作为类似于氧气的活性物种，在方案1所示的条件下，可以进行选择性丙烯氧化脱氢反应，促进丙烯形成。

3. 硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯过程中的关键挑战包括副产品的形成，如COx，需要抑制。S2作为活性物种帮助选择性丙烯形成，但其管理至关重要。未来研究的方向集中在识别更活跃和选择性更好的催化剂，以及在H2S存在的条件下优化丙烷氧化脱氢过程。理解H2S在丙烯形成过程中的精确作用是至关重要的。

4. H2S在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯过程中的有效性在于其能够提高丙烯产量，抑制过氧化并循环自我促进。关键改进领域涉及催化剂优化、副产品管理和提高硫利用效率。

5. 在短接触时间内，氢硫酸的存在显着提高了丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯的过程，提供了一种提高丙烯产率的有前景的途径。这一发现强调了硫基氧化剂在化学过程中的潜力，对提高整体效率和可持续性具有重要意义。

<p>Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30% [36].</p>

<p>The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly.</p>
<p>As can be seen from table 2, nearly 50% selectivity to propene with 75.6% conversion of propane was obtained at 0.01s residence time, giving the highest propene yield of 37.6%.</p>
<p>In contrast, V2O5/A12O3 catalyst was found to be selective for the formation of COx, but not propene, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane without H2S at 700 C.</p>
<p>Indeed, when ethylene is taken into account with propene, it is notable that the V2O5/A12O3 catalyst offers an olefin selectivity of up to 81% at a high propane conversion.</p>

1. In oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, propene yield typically drops below 30% due to extensive selectivity losses with increasing conversion, mainly caused by propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to CO and CO2.

2. Catalyst V2O5/A12O3 without H2S showed selectivity for COx rather than propene during propane oxidative dehydrogenation at 700°C. 

3. When considering ethylene alongside propene, the V2O5/A12O3 catalyst offers a high olefin selectivity of up to 81% at high propane conversion.

4. Laboratory work demonstrates that H2S can be effectively converted into sulfur, H2O, and H2 via catalytic partial oxidation at a 4:1 H2S/O2 ratio using α- or γ-alumina catalysts at short contact times.

5. The presence of H2S in the reaction system allows for the recovery of H2S and significantly suppresses COx products, suggesting it acts as an active species similar to O2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯的过程中，随着转化率的增加，丙烯的产率通常会降至30%以下，主要原因是丙烯的再吸附及其随后氧化为CO和CO2导致选择性损失。在进料气体中添加H2S显著减少了COx、C2H4和CH4的生成，从而提高了丙烯的产率。

2. 在700°C下进行丙烷氧化脱氢反应时，催化剂V2O5/A12O3在没有H2S的情况下对COx的选择性较高，而非丙烯。

3. 当考虑与丙烯一起的乙烯时，V2O5/A12O3催化剂在高丙烷转化率下的烯烃选择性高达81%。

4. 实验室研究表明，通过使用α-或γ-氧化铝催化剂，在4:1的H2S/O2比例下进行催化部分氧化，可以在短接触时间内有效将H2S转化为硫、H2O和H2。

5. 反应系统中的H2S的存在允许回收H2S并显著抑制COx产品的生成，这表明它在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯过程中作为活性物种类似于O2起作用。

The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene varies significantly. H2S notably enhances propylene yield, particularly when added to the feed mixture, resulting in a higher selectivity for propene with a significant reduction in side products like COx, C2H4, and CH4. Compared to conventional oxidants, H2S introduces benefits such as improved propylene selectivity and yield at shorter contact times. S2, generated from the reaction of O2 with H2S, acts similarly to O2, facilitating the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, the challenge lies in managing the formation of byproducts, which requires further research to develop catalysts that can efficiently suppress unwanted reactions. Future research aims to improve catalyst design, optimize reaction conditions, and potentially explore other sulfur-based oxidants to enhance propylene yield and selectivity in ODHP processes.

不同硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯（ODHP）过程中的效果存在显著差异。硫化氢（H2S）的引入特别能显著提高丙烯的产率，特别是在添加到反应物混合气体中时，可以显著提升丙烯的选择性，并大幅减少副产物如COx、C2H4和CH4的生成。与传统氧化剂相比，H2S带来的优势包括在较短接触时间内获得更高的丙烯选择性和产率。产生的S2作为类似氧气的活性物种，能促进选择性氧化脱氢反应，有助于丙烷转化为丙烯，同时显著抑制COx等副产品的生成。然而，管理副产物的形成仍然是一个挑战，需要进一步研究开发能够高效抑制非期望反应的催化剂。未来的研究目标是改进催化剂设计、优化反应条件，并有可能探索其他硫基氧化剂，以增强ODHP过程中的丙烯产率和选择性。
