[1] "In recent years, attempts to produce both hydrogen and sulfur from hydrogen sulfide have received considerable attention."
[2] "Work in our laboratory has further successfully demonstrated that H2S can be effectively converted into a mixture of sulfur, H2O and H2 by catalytic partial oxidation at a 4:l H2S/O2 ratio using either α- or γ - alumina catalysts at short contact times."
[3] "Indeed, considerable amounts of S2 have been observed in the product mixture in the present study, which would indicate that the rate of reaction of O2 with H2S is much greater than with hydrocarbon."
[4] "The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1."
[5] "In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact time is a highly promising route for improving propene yield."

1. The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene varies significantly. H2S notably enhances propylene yield, suppresses over-oxidation, and recycles itself through reactions, making it a promising promoter. S2, as a product of H2S oxidation, acts similarly to O2 in facilitating propylene formation. SO2, though potentially reactive, is not mentioned in this context. Challenges include managing byproduct formation and optimizing catalyst design for efficient sulfur utilization.

2. Key challenges for sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP include byproduct formation, such as COx, which requires suppression. S2, an active species, helps in selective propylene formation, but its management is crucial. Future research aims to improve catalyst design for better sulfur utilization and byproduct control.

3. Future research directions focus on identifying more active and selective catalysts for ODHP in the presence of H2S. Efforts aim to enhance propene yield while minimizing byproducts. Understanding the precise role of H2S in propylene formation through catalytic reactions is essential.

4. The effectiveness of H2S in ODHP lies in its ability to enhance propylene yield, suppress over-oxidation, and recycle through reactions. Key areas for improvement involve catalyst optimization, byproduct management, and enhancing the efficiency of sulfur utilization in the process.

5. The presence of H2S in the feed mixture significantly improves the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene at short contact times, offering a promising route for enhancing propene yield. This finding underscores the potential of sulfur-based oxidants in this chemical process, with implications for improving overall efficiency and sustainability.

1. 近年来，从氢硫酸中生产氢和硫的方法引起了广泛关注。我们的实验室成功展示了，在短接触时间内，通过催化部分氧化，利用α-或γ-氧化铝催化剂将氢硫酸转化为硫、水和氢的混合物。大量S2在产品混合物中被观察到，表明氧气与氢硫酸的反应速率远高于与碳氢化合物的反应速率。因此，近全部氧气被氢硫酸消耗，这表明S2作为类似于氧气的活性物种，在方案1所示的条件下，可以进行选择性丙烯氧化脱氢反应，促进丙烯形成。

2. 在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯过程中使用硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）的有效性存在显著差异。H2S特别能提高丙烯产量，抑制过氧化，并通过循环自我促进丙烯形成，显示出极大的潜力。S2作为H2S氧化的产物，类似于氧气执行选择性丙烯形成的作用。SO2虽然可能具有反应性，但在本研究中未提及。挑战包括管理副产品的形成，优化催化剂设计以实现高效的硫利用。

3. 硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯过程中的关键挑战包括副产品的形成，如COx，需要抑制。S2作为活性物种帮助选择性丙烯形成，但其管理至关重要。未来研究的方向集中在识别更活跃和选择性更好的催化剂，以及在H2S存在的条件下优化丙烷氧化脱氢过程。理解H2S在丙烯形成过程中的精确作用是至关重要的。

4. H2S在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯过程中的有效性在于其能够提高丙烯产量，抑制过氧化并循环自我促进。关键改进领域涉及催化剂优化、副产品管理和提高硫利用效率。
