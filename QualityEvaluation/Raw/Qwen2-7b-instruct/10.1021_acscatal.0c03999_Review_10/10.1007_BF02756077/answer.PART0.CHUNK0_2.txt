[1] "It is known [1, 2] that, in the process of propane oxi- dative dehydrogenation by sulfur dioxide on carbon, the formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) containing C, H, O, and S is observed."
[2] "The properties OCP depend on the nature of oxide: OCP/A1203 is more active toward propane conversion than OCP/SiO2, but the latter are more selective toward propylene [1]."
[3] "The apparent rate of propy- lene formation increases with an increase in the pore volume with radii between 10 and 100 nm."
[4] "Propane is transformed into propylene more selectively on the catalyst where the pores with radii of 10-100 nm dominate;narrower pores (< 10 nm) are favorable for the formation of coke and complete oxidation products."

The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants (SO2) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene compared to conventional oxidants is discussed in the document. SO2 facilitates the formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) containing C, H, O, and S. OCP/A1203 is more effective in converting propane, while OCP/SiO2 exhibits higher selectivity towards propylene production. The rate of propylene formation increases with the pore volume having radii between 10 and 100 nm. Narrower pores (< 10 nm) are conducive to the formation of coke and complete oxidation products.

在文档中讨论了硫基氧化剂（SO2）在丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）到丙烯的有效性与常规氧化剂之间的比较。SO2促进形成含C、H、O和S的氧化聚合物（OCP）。OCP/A1203在丙烷转化方面更为有效，而OCP/SiO2表现出更高的丙烯选择性。丙烯形成速率随具有10至100nm半径的孔体积增加而增加。直径小于10nm的更细小的孔有利于焦炭和完全氧化产物的形成。

[1] "The goal of this work is the study of the effects of the preparation procedure, component ratio, and the aluminum-silicon catalyst treatment temperature on the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation to pro- pylene in the presence of sulfur dioxide."
[2] "It is shown that the samples contain individual silicon and aluminum oxides. The product of their interaction (mullite) is formed only at 1550 °C."
[3] "It is found that the porous structure of the catalyst plays a key role in the process of the oxi- dative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of sulfur dioxide at 600-700 °C."
[4] "The apparent rate of propy- lene formation increases with an increase in the pore volume with radii between 10 and 100 nm."

This study focuses on examining how the preparation process, component ratio, and aluminum-silicon catalyst treatment temperature influence the propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene in the presence of sulfur dioxide. It reveals that the catalysts consist of individual silicon and aluminum oxides, with mullite formed only at 1550°C. The porous structure of the catalyst is crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at 600-700°C. The apparent rate of propylene formation rises with an increase in the pore volume ranging from 10 to 100 nm.
