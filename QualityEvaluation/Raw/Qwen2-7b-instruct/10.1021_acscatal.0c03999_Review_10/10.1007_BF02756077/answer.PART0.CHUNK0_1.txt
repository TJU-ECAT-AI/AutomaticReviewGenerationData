The effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene varies significantly based on their molecular structure and impact on the reaction pathway. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), elemental sulfur (S2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are common sulfur-based oxidants used in ODHP processes. 

Among these, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is typically the most effective oxidant for propylene production. This is because SO2 enables a more selective transformation of propane into propylene, especially in pores with radii ranging from 10 to 100 nm. The reason lies in the enhanced chemical transformation in the gas phase as the temperature increases, facilitating the selective formation of propylene. Finer pores (< 10 nm) tend to favor the formation of coke and oxidation products, thus indicating the importance of pore size in determining the efficiency of the reaction.

However, sulfur-based oxidants can also lead to the formation of byproducts such as carbon oxides, methane, ethylene, and sulfur compounds. These byproducts can reduce the overall efficiency of the process and require additional steps for their removal or conversion to valuable products. For instance, elemental sulfur (S2) might result in more complex byproducts compared to H2S or SO2 due to its higher reactivity and potential for side reactions.

Key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process include:

1. **Tailoring Catalyst Porosity**: Designing catalysts with specific pore size distributions that enhance propylene selectivity while minimizing byproduct formation. This could involve creating catalysts with predominant pores in the range of 10-100 nm for propylene formation and ensuring that byproduct pathways are blocked through the use of finer pores.

2. **Enhancing Reactor Design**: Incorporating advanced reactor designs that facilitate efficient gas diffusion and minimize the risk of byproduct formation. This could include the use of multi-scale reactors that combine macroscopic and microscopic diffusion mechanisms to optimize the reaction environment.

3. **Catalyst Stability and Durability**: Developing catalyst materials that maintain high activity and selectivity over long periods of operation. This involves understanding the degradation mechanisms of catalysts under different operating conditions and designing materials that can withstand high temperatures, pressures, and exposure to sulfur-based oxidants.

4. **Byproduct Management**: Implementing post-reaction treatments or recycling systems that efficiently convert byproducts back into valuable chemicals or energy sources. This could include the development of secondary reactions or the integration of byproduct management systems within the overall process flow.

5. **Process Optimization**: Conducting detailed kinetic studies and thermodynamic analyses to better understand the reaction mechanisms and optimize process parameters. This includes identifying the optimal operating conditions (temperature, pressure, reactant ratios, etc.) that maximize propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation.

Addressing these areas of research could lead to significant improvements in the efficiency, sustainability, and economic viability of sulfur-based oxidative dehydrogenation processes for propane to propylene conversion.

硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）到丙烯的过程中的有效性存在显著差异，基于它们的分子结构以及对反应途径的影响。常见的硫基氧化剂包括氢化物硫（H2S）、元素硫（S2）和二氧化硫（SO2）。

在这些氧化剂中，二氧化硫（SO2）通常是最有效的丙烯生产氧化剂。这是因为SO2能够更选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，尤其是在孔径范围为10至100纳米的孔内。原因在于随着温度的增加，气体相中的化学转化增强，促进丙烯的更选择性形成。小于10纳米的更细孔则倾向于有利于焦油和氧化产物的形成，这表明孔径大小对于确定反应效率的重要性。

然而，硫基氧化剂也可能导致副产品的形成，如碳氧化物、甲烷、乙烯和硫化合物。这些副产品会降低过程的整体效率，并需要额外步骤进行去除或转换成有价值的产品。例如，元素硫（S2）可能会由于其更高的活性和潜在的副反应而产生更复杂的副产品。

未来研究的关键领域以改进催化剂设计并优化整体过程包括：

1. **调整催化剂孔隙度**：设计具有特定孔径分布的催化剂，以提高丙烯选择性并减少副产品形成。这可能涉及创建主要孔径在10至100纳米范围内用于丙烯形成且通过使用更细的孔来阻止副产品路径的催化剂。

2. **增强反应器设计**：采用先进的反应器设计，以促进高效气体扩散并最小化副产品形成的风险。这可能包括使用结合宏观和微观扩散机制的多尺度反应器来优化反应环境。

3. **催化剂稳定性和耐用性**：开发能够维持高活性和选择性多年运行的催化剂材料。这涉及到理解在不同操作条件下催化剂的降解机制，并设计能够承受高温、高压和暴露于硫基氧化剂的材料。

4. **副产品管理**：实施有效处理或循环系统，以高效地将副产品转化为有价值的化学品或能源来源。这可能包括发展二级反应或在整体流程流中集成副产品管理系统。

5. **过程优化**：进行详细的动力学研究和热力学分析，以更好地理解反应机制并优化操作参数。这包括识别在最大化丙烯产率的同时最小化副产品形成的最优操作条件（温度、压力、反应物比例等）。

通过解决这些研究领域的挑战，可以显著提高硫基氧化性脱氢过程的效率、可持续性和经济可行性，用于丙烷到丙烯转换。
