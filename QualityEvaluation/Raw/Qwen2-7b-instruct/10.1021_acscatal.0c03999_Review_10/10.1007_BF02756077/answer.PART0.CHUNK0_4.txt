[1] "It is known [1, 2] that, in the process of propane oxi- dative dehydrogenation by sulfur dioxide on carbon, the formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) containing C, H, O, and S is observed."
[2] "The properties OCP depend on the nature of oxide: OCP/A1203 is more active toward propane conversion than OCP/SiO2, but the latter are more selective toward propylene [1]."
[3] "The apparent rate of propy- lene formation increases with an increase in the pore volume with radii between 10 and 100 nm."
[4] "Propane is transformed into propylene more selectively on the catalyst where the pores with radii of 10-100 nm dominate;narrower pores (< 10 nm) are favorable for the formation of coke and complete oxidation products."

The document discusses the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The primary oxidant considered is sulfur dioxide (SO2). The document notes that sulfur dioxide leads to the formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP), which can either enhance or hinder the formation of propylene depending on their composition. OCP derived from alumina (A1203) tends to be more active in converting propane compared to those derived from silica (SiO2), but the latter are more selective towards propylene production. The rate of propylene formation increases with the pore volume of the catalyst material, particularly within the range of 10 to 100 nm. Narrower pores (less than 10 nm) favor the formation of coke and complete oxidation products rather than propylene. This indicates that the pore structure of the catalyst plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of propylene production under the conditions described.

文档讨论了不同硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯（ODHP）过程中的效果。主要考虑的氧化剂是二氧化硫（SO2）。文档指出，二氧化硫导致形成氧化缩合产物（OCP），其组成可能会影响丙烯的生成效率。从氧化铝（A1203）产生的OCP比从二氧化硅（SiO2）产生的更有利于促进丙烷转化，但后者对丙烯选择性更高。在催化剂材料中，孔体积的增加会导致丙烯生成率提高，特别是当孔径在10到100纳米之间时。直径小于10纳米的窄孔更有利于形成焦炭和完全氧化产物，而不是丙烯。这表明催化剂的孔结构在确定在描述条件下丙烯生产效率方面起着关键作用。
