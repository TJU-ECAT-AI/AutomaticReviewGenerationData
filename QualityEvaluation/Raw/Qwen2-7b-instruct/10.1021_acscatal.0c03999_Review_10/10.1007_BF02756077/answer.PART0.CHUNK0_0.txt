Phase composition. According to X-ray phase analysis data described in Table 1, silica-alumina samples contain alumina and silica, as well as the product of their interaction, mullite. The amounts of these phases are determined by the nature of aluminum-containing starting material, component ratio, and treat-ment temperature (Ttreat).

Textural characteristics of samples. Together with phase transformations, samples change their specific surface areas and pore structures. The specific surface area decreases with an increase in the treatment temperatures and with the replacement of aluminum hydroxide (series I) by alumina (series IV) (Table 2).

Catalytic properties of samples. It is known that at high temperatures, the oxidation of propane can occur via heterogeneous, heterogeneous-homogeneous, and homogeneous mechanisms, depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst nature. Changes in the volume of the reaction zone and the catalyst-free volume of the reactor [5] allowed us to determine conditions at which the contribution of the homogeneous process is minimal. Table 3 shows that the propane conversion x is very small in the absence of the catalyst even if the conditions are optimal. Therefore, we neglected the homogeneous component of the process.

Propane oxidative dehydrogenation by sulfur dioxide at 600-700 over the catalysts under study occurs via a complicated heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism. This reaction is accompanied by the formation of a series of products: C3H8 transforms into C3H6, C2H6, C2H4, CH4, CO, CO2, and coke; SO2 transforms into H2S, H2O, and S.

The study focuses on the effects of preparation procedures, component ratios, and aluminum-silicon catalyst treatments on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with sulfur dioxide. It demonstrates that the pore structure of the catalyst significantly influences the process. The textural characteristics of the catalysts, including their specific surface areas and pore volumes, vary with the preparation conditions and treatment temperatures. The specific activity of the samples is inversely proportional to the total surface area, aligning with the expected behavior in heterogeneous-homogeneous reactions. The reaction involves multiple products, including propylene, ethylene, methane, carbon oxides, and coke, indicating a complex heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism.

The catalysts with mesoporous structures (pores with radii between 10 and 100 nm) exhibit the highest apparent rate of propylene formation compared to catalysts with narrower pores or larger pores. Finer pores (<10 nm) favor coke formation and complete oxidation products, while wider pores (10-100 nm) promote the selective formation of propylene. The study concludes that the pore structure plays a crucial role in determining the direction of the reaction at different temperatures, supporting the idea that the heterogeneous-homogeneous reaction mechanism dominates at higher temperatures.

Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design to enhance selectivity and efficiency in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Potential areas of investigation might include the development of catalysts with finely tuned pore structures, modifications to the synthesis methods to control the phase composition and textural properties, and the exploration of alternative oxidants that could potentially offer improved performance or reduced byproduct formation.

研究集中在准备过程、组分比例和铝硅催化剂处理温度对丙烷氧化脱氢作用于二氧化硫的影响。研究表明，催化剂的孔结构在过程中起着关键作用。催化剂的结构性质，包括其表面积和孔体积，随着准备条件和处理温度的变化而变化。样品的特定活性与总表面积成反比，符合异相-均相反应的预期行为。在不同温度下，反应涉及一系列产物，包括丙烯、乙烯、甲烷、碳氧化物和焦炭，表明存在复杂的异相-均相机制。

具有介孔结构（直径在10至100纳米之间的孔）的催化剂表现出最高的丙烯形成率，与具有更窄或更大孔径的催化剂相比。小于10纳米的细孔有利于焦炭形成和完全氧化产物，而10至100纳米的较大孔径促进丙烯的高选择性形成。研究结论指出，孔结构决定了不同温度下反应的方向，支持异相-均相反应机制在较高温度下的主导地位。

未来的研究应专注于优化催化剂设计以提高丙烷氧化脱氢的效率和选择性。潜在的研究领域可能包括开发具有精确调整孔结构的催化剂、通过合成方法控制相组成和文本性质的修改，以及探索可能提供改进性能或减少副产品形成的替代氧化剂。
