[1] "In recent years atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as an effective technology to synthesize catalytic materials at atomic scale precision."
[2] "The ALD process produces high-density ZnO sites on the support; this brings about excellent catalytic activity but may also facilitate generation of coke species and crystallization of catalytic phases, which will lead to accelerated deactivation of the catalyst."

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by depositing them layer by layer on the surface of the material. This method allows for precise control over the thickness and uniformity of the metal compound layer, enhancing metal-support interactions. The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions are significant, as ALD can lead to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. However, the high density of active sites created by ALD can also lead to accelerated deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation, sintering or crystallization of the catalytic phase, and evaporation of metal species.

原子层沉积（ALD）通过在材料表面逐层沉积，实现了对活性金属化合物在晶体材料中进行精确控制性的引入。这种方法允许对于金属化合物层的厚度和均匀性进行精确控制，从而增强金属-载体之间的相互作用。对于增强金属-载体相互作用而言，ALD具有重要意义，因为它可以促进在固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性的改善。然而，由ALD产生的高活性位点也可能导致催化剂加速失活，原因包括焦炭形成、催化相的聚集或结晶以及金属物种的蒸发。
