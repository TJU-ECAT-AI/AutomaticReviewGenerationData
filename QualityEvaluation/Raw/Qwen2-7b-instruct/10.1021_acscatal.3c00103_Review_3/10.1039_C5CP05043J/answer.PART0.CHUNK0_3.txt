[1] "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as an effective technology to synthesize catalytic materials at atomic scale precision."
[2] "The ALD process produces high-density ZnO sites on the support; this brings about excellent catalytic activity but may also facilitate generation of coke species and crystallization of catalytic phases, which will lead to accelerated deactivation of the catalyst."

The hydroxyl anchoring method in atomic layer deposition (ALD) facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by alternating the application of metal precursor and a reagent that generates surface hydroxyl groups. This method ensures precise control over the deposition of metal compounds, allowing for the creation of high-density active sites within the material. The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions are significant, as it allows for the creation of strong bonds between the metal and the support, improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. However, the method can also lead to accelerated deactivation of the catalyst due to the generation of coke species and the crystallization of catalytic phases, which might block active sites and reduce the material's effectiveness over time.

氢氧基锚定方法在原子层沉积（ALD）中通过交替应用金属前驱体和产生表面氢氧基的试剂，促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这种方法允许精确控制金属化合物的沉积，从而在材料中创建高密度活性位点。这对于增强金属与支撑物之间的相互作用具有重要意义，因为它允许创建强键，提高固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。然而，该方法也可能导致催化剂加速失效，由于生成焦炭物种和催化相结晶，这可能会堵塞活性位点并降低材料的有效性。
