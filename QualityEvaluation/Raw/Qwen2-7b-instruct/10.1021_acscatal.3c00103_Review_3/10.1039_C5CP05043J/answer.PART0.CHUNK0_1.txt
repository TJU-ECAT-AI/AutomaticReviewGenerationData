[1] "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as an effective technology to synthesize catalytic materials at atomic scale precision."
[2] "Instead of higher temperature reduction or oxidation, water vapor is introduced to convert surface ethyl groups into hydroxyl groups during the second half reaction of ZnO ALD, which also generates reaction sites for the next cycle of deposition."
[3] "The ALD process produces high-density ZnO sites on the support; this brings about excellent catalytic activity but may also facilitate generation of coke species and crystallization of catalytic phases, which will lead to accelerated deactivation of the catalyst."

The hydroxyl anchoring method in atomic layer deposition (ALD) facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the unique deposition pattern of ALD. This method alternately pulses two gaseous precursors, allowing each to react with the surface functional groups generated during the previous pulse. This ensures that metal compounds are anchored through hydroxyl groups, leading to high-density sites on the support. This approach enhances metal-support interactions, potentially improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. However, the method also introduces risks, such as the generation of coke species and the crystallization of catalytic phases, which can accelerate catalyst deactivation.

在原子层沉积（ALD）中，通过利用ALD的独特沉积模式，氢氧基锚定方法实现了活性金属化合物在晶材料中的可控掺入。这种方法交替脉冲两种气体前驱体，使得每个前驱体可以与上一脉冲产生的表面功能团反应。这确保了金属化合物通过氢氧基被锚定，从而在支持物上形成高密度点。这一过程增强了金属-支持相互作用，可能提高了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。然而，该方法也引入了风险，如生成焦炭物种和催化相结晶，这些可能导致催化剂加速失活。
