[1] "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as an effective technology to synthesize catalytic materials at atomic scale precision."
[2] "Instead of higher temperature reduction or oxidation, water vapor is introduced to convert surface ethyl groups into hydroxyl groups during the second half reaction of ZnO ALD, which also generates reaction sites for the next cycle of deposition."
[3] "As revealed by multiple characterization techniques such as weight gain analysis, N2 physisorption, XRD, SEM, XPS, TPR, isolated Zn(OH)+ species are predominantly formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD."
[4] "For both zeolites the catalyst fabricated by only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD performs better than those fabricated by multiple cycles of ALD, indicating that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics."
[5] "Despite their impressive initial catalytic performances, deactivations are rather fast for these ALD ZnO modified zeolites. Coke formation is the primary reason for the deactivation of the ZSM-5 supported ALD ZnO catalyst."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by enabling precise placement of metal species on the surface of the substrate. This is achieved through the use of alternating gas pulses in an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, which allows for the sequential deposition of metal precursors and the formation of hydroxyl groups on the surface. The hydroxyl anchoring ensures strong interactions between the metal and the support, enhancing the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The method enables the introduction of metals at the atomic scale, providing a high density of active sites that are well-dispersed and precisely positioned. This leads to improved catalytic performance due to the optimized metal-support interactions and the creation of specific sites conducive to desired reaction pathways.

Coke formation is the primary reason for the rapid deactivation of the ALD ZnO modified zeolites, particularly affecting the ZSM-5 supported catalyst. The method of incorporating ZnO through ALD involves the formation of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. However, the use of multiple ALD cycles leads to the formation of larger clusters of ZnO, which can lead to deactivation due to sintering or crystallization of the catalytic phase, evaporation of ZnO species, and the formation of coke on the surface of the zeolite. The deactivations are faster for these ALD ZnO modified zeolites compared to other metal oxide catalysts supported on zeolites for propane conversion, which can be attributed to the high loading of ZnO facilitated by the saturated ALD surface reaction. Future work aims to improve the stabilities of these ALD ZnO modified zeolites by addressing the factors contributing to their deactivation.

氢氧基锚定方法通过在原子层沉积（ALD）过程中交替气体脉冲，使金属前体精确放置在晶材料表面上，从而促进活性金属化合物的可控集成。这确保了金属与支撑物之间强大的相互作用，增强了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。该方法允许在原子尺度上引入金属，提供高度分散且精确定位的活性位点，从而优化金属-支撑交互并创建有利的反应途径。这种方法提供了高密度的活性位点，提高了催化性能。

焦炭形成是ALD ZnO改性沸石催化剂快速失活的主要原因，尤其是对ZSM-5支持的催化剂。ALD过程中的ZnO集成涉及形成孤立的Zn(OH)+物种，这些物种对于丙烷转化为丙烯和芳香烃有效。然而，使用多个ALD周期会导致较大的ZnO簇形成，这可能导致失活，由于催化相的凝聚或结晶、ZnO物种的蒸发以及在沸石表面形成焦炭。与用于丙烷转化的其他金属氧化物催化剂相比，这些ALD ZnO改性沸石催化剂的失活速度更快，这可以归因于饱和ALD表面反应导致的高负载ZnO。未来的工作旨在通过解决导致这些ALD ZnO改性沸石催化剂失活的因素来提高它们的稳定性。
