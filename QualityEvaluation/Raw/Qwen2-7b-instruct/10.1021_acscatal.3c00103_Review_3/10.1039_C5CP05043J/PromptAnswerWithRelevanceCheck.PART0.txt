[1] "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as an effective technology to synthesize catalytic materials at atomic scale precision."
[2] "Instead of higher temperature reduction or oxidation, water vapor is introduced to convert surface ethyl groups into hydroxyl groups during the second half reaction of ZnO ALD, which also generates reaction sites for the next cycle of deposition."
[3] "As revealed by multiple characterization techniques such as weight gain analysis, N2 physisorption, XRD, SEM, XPS, TPR, isolated Zn(OH)+ species are predominantly formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD."
[4] "For both zeolites the catalyst fabricated by only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD performs better than those fabricated by multiple cycles of ALD, indicating that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics."
[5] "Despite their impressive initial catalytic performances, deactivations are rather fast for these ALD ZnO modified zeolites. Coke formation is the primary reason for the deactivation of the ZSM-5 supported ALD ZnO catalyst."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by enabling precise placement of metal species on the surface of the substrate. This is achieved through the use of alternating gas pulses in an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, which allows for the sequential deposition of metal precursors and the formation of hydroxyl groups on the surface. The hydroxyl anchoring ensures strong interactions between the metal and the support, enhancing the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The method enables the introduction of metals at the atomic scale, providing a high density of active sites that are well-dispersed and precisely positioned. This leads to improved catalytic performance due to the optimized metal-support interactions and the creation of specific sites conducive to desired reaction pathways.

Coke formation is the primary reason for the rapid deactivation of the ALD ZnO modified zeolites, particularly affecting the ZSM-5 supported catalyst. The method of incorporating ZnO through ALD involves the formation of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. However, the use of multiple ALD cycles leads to the formation of larger clusters of ZnO, which can lead to deactivation due to sintering or crystallization of the catalytic phase, evaporation of ZnO species, and the formation of coke on the surface of the zeolite. The deactivations are faster for these ALD ZnO modified zeolites compared to other metal oxide catalysts supported on zeolites for propane conversion, which can be attributed to the high loading of ZnO facilitated by the saturated ALD surface reaction. Future work aims to improve the stabilities of these ALD ZnO modified zeolites by addressing the factors contributing to their deactivation.

氢氧基锚定方法通过在原子层沉积（ALD）过程中交替气体脉冲，使金属前体精确放置在晶材料表面上，从而促进活性金属化合物的可控集成。这确保了金属与支撑物之间强大的相互作用，增强了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。该方法允许在原子尺度上引入金属，提供高度分散且精确定位的活性位点，从而优化金属-支撑交互并创建有利的反应途径。这种方法提供了高密度的活性位点，提高了催化性能。

焦炭形成是ALD ZnO改性沸石催化剂快速失活的主要原因，尤其是对ZSM-5支持的催化剂。ALD过程中的ZnO集成涉及形成孤立的Zn(OH)+物种，这些物种对于丙烷转化为丙烯和芳香烃有效。然而，使用多个ALD周期会导致较大的ZnO簇形成，这可能导致失活，由于催化相的凝聚或结晶、ZnO物种的蒸发以及在沸石表面形成焦炭。与用于丙烷转化的其他金属氧化物催化剂相比，这些ALD ZnO改性沸石催化剂的失活速度更快，这可以归因于饱和ALD表面反应导致的高负载ZnO。未来的工作旨在通过解决导致这些ALD ZnO改性沸石催化剂失活的因素来提高它们的稳定性。

The hydroxyl anchoring method in atomic layer deposition (ALD) facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the unique deposition pattern of ALD. This method alternately pulses two gaseous precursors, allowing each to react with the surface functional groups generated during the previous pulse. This ensures that metal compounds are anchored through hydroxyl groups, leading to high-density sites on the support. This approach enhances metal-support interactions, potentially improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. However, the method also introduces risks, such as the generation of coke species and the crystallization of catalytic phases, which can accelerate catalyst deactivation.

[1] "In recent years atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as an effective technology to synthesize catalytic materials at atomic scale precision."
[2] "In an ALD process, two gaseous precursors are pulsed alternatively such that each reacts with the surface functional groups generated during the previous pulse to produce a deposition cycle."
[3] "The first half reaction of ZnO ALD on zeolites will proceed in a similar manner as the CVD with DMZ. Instead of higher temperature reduction or oxidation, water vapor is introduced to convert surface ethyl groups into hydroxyl groups during the second half reaction of ZnO ALD, which also generates reaction sites for the next cycle of deposition."
[4] "As a consequence highest positive shifts of the BE should be observed on the zeolites fabricated by only 1 cycle of ZnO ALD."

1. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by enabling precise deposition cycles of two gaseous precursors that react with surface functional groups, resulting in atomic-scale precision. This method allows for the creation of highly dispersed metal species within crystal structures.

2. ALD works by alternating pulses of two gaseous precursors, allowing each to react with the surface functional groups produced during the previous pulse, thus forming a deposition cycle.

3. In the ALD process for zinc oxide (ZnO) on zeolites, the first half-reaction is similar to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using dimethyl zinc (DMZ). Instead of high-temperature reduction or oxidation, water vapor is introduced during the second half-reaction to convert surface ethyl groups into hydroxyl groups. This process generates reaction sites for the next cycle of deposition.

4. After only one cycle of ALD, the binding energy (BE) of the Zn species shows the highest positive shift, indicating the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species anchored to the support via lattice oxygen.

5. The rapid deactivation of ALD ZnO modified zeolites is primarily attributed to coke formation, which leads to the loss of active sites and blocks the micropores, affecting the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability.

1.ALD通过允许精确沉积循环来促进活性金属化合物在晶态材料中的精确引入，每个循环由两种气体前驱体交替脉冲完成，每个前驱体与前一次脉冲产生的表面功能团反应，从而实现原子尺度精度。这种方法允许在晶体内创建高度分散的金属物种。

2.ALD通过交替脉冲两种气体前驱体工作，允许每个前驱体与上一次脉冲产生的表面功能团反应，从而形成沉积循环。

3.ZnO ALD在沸石上的第一半反应类似于使用DMZ的CVD。相反，在第二半反应中，通过引入水蒸气将表面乙基转化为羟基，而不是进行高温还原或氧化。这一过程在生成下一个沉积循环的反应位点的同时也产生反应位点。

4.仅经过一个ALD循环后，Zn物种的结合能（BE）显示出最高的正偏移，表明存在通过晶格氧锚定到支持物上的孤立Zn(OH)+物种。

5. ALD ZnO改性沸石催化剂的快速失活主要归因于焦炭的形成，这导致活性位点的损失并堵塞微孔，影响催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
