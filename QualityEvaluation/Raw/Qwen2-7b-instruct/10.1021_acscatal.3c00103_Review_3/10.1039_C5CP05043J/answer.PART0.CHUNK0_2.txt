[1] "In recent years atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as an effective technology to synthesize catalytic materials at atomic scale precision."
[2] "In an ALD process, two gaseous precursors are pulsed alternatively such that each reacts with the surface functional groups generated during the previous pulse to produce a deposition cycle."
[3] "The first half reaction of ZnO ALD on zeolites will proceed in a similar manner as the CVD with DMZ. Instead of higher temperature reduction or oxidation, water vapor is introduced to convert surface ethyl groups into hydroxyl groups during the second half reaction of ZnO ALD, which also generates reaction sites for the next cycle of deposition."
[4] "As a consequence highest positive shifts of the BE should be observed on the zeolites fabricated by only 1 cycle of ZnO ALD."
[5] "Despite their impressive initial catalytic performances, deactivations are rather fast for these ALD ZnO modified zeolites. Coke formation is the primary reason for the deactivation of the ZSM-5 supported ALD ZnO catalyst."

1. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by enabling precise deposition cycles of two gaseous precursors that react with surface functional groups, resulting in atomic-scale precision. This method allows for the creation of highly dispersed metal species within crystal structures.

2. ALD works by alternating pulses of two gaseous precursors, allowing each to react with the surface functional groups produced during the previous pulse, thus forming a deposition cycle.

3. In the ALD process for zinc oxide (ZnO) on zeolites, the first half-reaction is similar to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using dimethyl zinc (DMZ). Instead of high-temperature reduction or oxidation, water vapor is introduced during the second half-reaction to convert surface ethyl groups into hydroxyl groups. This process generates reaction sites for the next cycle of deposition.

4. After only one cycle of ALD, the binding energy (BE) of the Zn species shows the highest positive shift, indicating the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species anchored to the support via lattice oxygen.

5. The rapid deactivation of ALD ZnO modified zeolites is primarily attributed to coke formation, which leads to the loss of active sites and blocks the micropores, affecting the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability.

1.ALD通过允许精确沉积循环来促进活性金属化合物在晶态材料中的精确引入，每个循环由两种气体前驱体交替脉冲完成，每个前驱体与前一次脉冲产生的表面功能团反应，从而实现原子尺度精度。这种方法允许在晶体内创建高度分散的金属物种。

2.ALD通过交替脉冲两种气体前驱体工作，允许每个前驱体与上一次脉冲产生的表面功能团反应，从而形成沉积循环。

3.ZnO ALD在沸石上的第一半反应类似于使用DMZ的CVD。相反，在第二半反应中，通过引入水蒸气将表面乙基转化为羟基，而不是进行高温还原或氧化。这一过程在生成下一个沉积循环的反应位点的同时也产生反应位点。

4.仅经过一个ALD循环后，Zn物种的结合能（BE）显示出最高的正偏移，表明存在通过晶格氧锚定到支持物上的孤立Zn(OH)+物种。

5. ALD ZnO改性沸石催化剂的快速失活主要归因于焦炭的形成，这导致活性位点的损失并堵塞微孔，影响催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
