[1] "Recently, heterogeneous Lewis acid materials, e.g. Ti-, Sn-, and Zr-Beta zeolites, have found widespread applications in sustainable chemistry and green chemical transformations."
[2] "The strategy developed here can be extended to the preparation of other mesoporous zeolites with incorporated transition metal ions."
[3] "Zr species in the BEA framework are evidenced to be optimized active components with moderate Lewis acidity for the aminolysis of epoxides, in comparison with Sn and Zr-silicate analogues."
[4] "The mesopores generated by alkaline treatment enable better accessibility of reactant molecules to the active sites and more facile diffusion of products outside the pores, resulting in an enhanced catalytic activity."
[5] "Meso-Zr-Beta, prepared by post-synthesis procedures, is demonstrated to be a robust catalyst in the ring-opening aminolysis of epoxides with good recyclability."
