          The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials, enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. It allows for precise placement of metals at specific sites within the crystal lattice, optimizing their catalytic properties. Mesoporous metal ion-containing Beta zeolites, specifically Meso-Zr-Beta, Meso-Sn-Beta, and Meso-Ti-Beta, are used as catalysts in the ring-opening reaction of styrene oxide with aniline, producing β-amino alcohols selectively. Tetrahedrally coordinated Zr(iv) species in the Beta framework are identified as optimized active components for the aminolysis of epoxides, offering moderate Lewis acidity, surpassing Sn and Zr-silicate analogues. Alkaline treatment introduces mesopores that facilitate better accessibility of reactant molecules to active sites and easier diffusion of products, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity. Meso-Zr-Beta, prepared by post-synthesis procedures, demonstrates robust catalytic performance in the ring-opening aminolysis of epoxides with good recyclability.

          Heterogeneous Lewis acid materials, including Ti-, Sn-, and Zr-Beta zeolites, are extensively utilized in sustainable chemistry and green chemical transformations. The developed methodology can be expanded for synthesizing other mesoporous zeolites containing transition metals. Zr species within the Beta framework are identified as optimal active components with moderate Lewis acidity for the aminolysis of epoxides, surpassing Sn and Zr-silicate analogues. The introduction of mesopores through alkaline treatment facilitates better accessibility of reactant molecules to active sites and easier diffusion of products, thereby enhancing catalytic activity. Meso-Zr-Beta, prepared using post-synthesis procedures, exhibits robust catalytic performance in the ring-opening aminolysis of epoxides with good recyclability.
