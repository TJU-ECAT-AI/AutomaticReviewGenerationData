[2] "Despite the attractive catalytic performance achieved, the exclusive presence of small micropores (typically 0.51 nm) in these microporous crystalline frameworks often imposes limited access and slow intra-crystalline diffusion of reactants and products, especially when dealing with bulky molecules in the liquid phase."
[3] "Hierarchical/mesoporous metallosilicates, which integrate the intrinsic microporosity with secondary inter- or intra-crystalline mesopores and accordingly increase the external surface area effectively."
[4] "Meanwhile, the auxiliary pore structure brings about enhanced accessibility due to the enlarged pore mouths and shortened diffusion path in the micropores."
[5] "The use of a hierarchical/mesoporous zeolite instead of a conventional microporous zeolite may effectively improve the catalytic activity and reduce the catalyst deactivation."
[6] "Mesoporous Ti-zeolites and Sn-zeolites have been successfully prepared via bottom-up strategies and applied as catalysts in the epoxidation of olefins and Baeyer-Villiger oxidation reaction."
