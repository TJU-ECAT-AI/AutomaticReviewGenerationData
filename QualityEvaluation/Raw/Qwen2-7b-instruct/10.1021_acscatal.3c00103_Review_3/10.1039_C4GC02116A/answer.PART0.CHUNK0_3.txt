1. BEA-type mesoporous zirconosilicate, stannosilicate, and titanosilicate are synthesized using a post-synthesis strategy that involves dealumination, desilication, and the incorporation of Lewis acid sites. These materials are utilized as catalysts for the ring-opening reaction of epoxides with amines to produce β-amino alcohols under ambient conditions without the need for a solvent.
2. Mesoporous Zr-Beta zeolites demonstrate exceptional catalytic activity and regioselectivity in epoxide aminolysis, with the presence of mesopores significantly enhancing the activity through improved mass transfer.
3. Tetrahedrally coordinated Zr species within the BEA framework are identified as the most effective active components for epoxide aminolysis, compared to Sn and Zr-silicate analogues.
4. The introduction of mesopores through an alkaline treatment process facilitates better access of reactant molecules to the active sites and enables easier diffusion of products, thereby increasing the catalytic activity.
5. Meso-Zr-Beta, synthesized through a post-synthesis procedure, is proven to be a durable catalyst for the ring-opening aminolysis of epoxides, exhibiting good recyclability.
