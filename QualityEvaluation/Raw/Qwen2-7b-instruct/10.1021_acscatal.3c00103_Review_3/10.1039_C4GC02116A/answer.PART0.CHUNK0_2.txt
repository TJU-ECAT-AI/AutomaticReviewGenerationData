[1] "Recently, heterogeneous Lewis acid materials, e.g. Ti-, Sn-, and Zr-Beta zeolites, have found widespread applications in sustainable chemistry and green chemical transformations."
[2] "Despite the attractive catalytic performance achieved, the exclusive presence of small micropores (typically 0.51 nm) in these microporous crystalline frameworks often imposes limited access and slow intra-crystalline diffusion of reactants and products, especially when dealing with bulky molecules in the liquid phase."
[3] "Hierarchical/mesoporous metallosilicates, which integrate the intrinsic microporosity with secondary inter- or intra-crystalline mesopores and accordingly increase the external surface area effectively."
[4] "Meanwhile, the auxiliary pore structure brings about enhanced accessibility due to the enlarged pore mouths and shortened diffusion path in the micropores."
[5] "The use of a hierarchical/mesoporous zeolite instead of a conventional microporous zeolite may effectively improve the catalytic activity and reduce the catalyst deactivation."
[6] "Mesoporous Ti-zeolites and Sn-zeolites have been successfully prepared via bottom-up strategies and applied as catalysts in the epoxidation of olefins and Baeyer-Villiger oxidation reaction."
[7] "Alternatively, post-synthetic modification offers an effective and versatile approach to many hierarchically structured zeolites."
[8] "Zeolite materials"
[9] "Commercial H-Beta with an nSi/nAl ratio of 16.7 (Nankai University) was used as the starting material for preparing Zr(iv)-containing Beta catalysts with or without mesopores."
[10] "These results suggest that a large amount of mesopores is presumably generated in intra-crystal spaces, as clearly disclosed by TEM (vide infra, Fig. 3)."
[11] "The as-prepared solid Lewis acids are studied as catalysts in the ring-opening reaction of styrene oxide with aniline, in which two regio-isomer β-amino alcohol products, i.e. 2-phenyl-2-(phenylamino)ethanol and 1-phenyl-2-(phenylamino)ethanol, could be obtained (Scheme 2)."
[12] "The observed low activity of conventional Beta catalysts should be ascribed to their microporous structures with relatively small pores."
[13] "With a hierarchical pore structure, mesoporous Beta materials possess larger surface areas and mesopore volumes (Table 1)."
[14] "The mesopores obtained from alkaline treatment are connected to the outer surface of the crystals and might be interconnected with the micropores as well."
[15] "This unique structure provides a better accessibility of the reactant molecules to the active sites inside the pores and a facile diffusion of product molecules through mesopores, leading to an enhanced catalytic activity."
[16] "The mesopores generated by alkaline treatment enable better accessibility of reactant molecules to the active sites and more facile diffusion of products outside the pores, resulting in an enhanced catalytic activity."
[17] "Through aminolysis of epoxides, a series of β-amino alcohols can be successfully synthesized by varying the epoxides and amines."
[18] "Meso-Zr-Beta, prepared by post-synthesis procedures, is demonstrated to be a robust catalyst in the ring-opening aminolysis of epoxides with good recyclability."

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by creating specific sites or defects in the crystal framework that the metal ions can bind to. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

2. The implications of this method for enhancing metal-support interactions are significant, as it allows for precise control over the location and orientation of metal species within the crystal structure. This can optimize the catalytic sites for specific reactions, thereby improving the overall performance of the catalyst.

3. The method improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions by providing a means to tailor the surface chemistry and electronic properties of the support material.
