[1] "For the development of advanced dehydrogenation technologies, catalyst design, and new chemistry in catalytic propane dehydrogenation reactions, the scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges."
[2] "The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those shaped and single atom catalysts."
[3] "Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH. However, the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction especially under PDH conditions."
[4] "Developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation."
[5] "Novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts."
