[1] "For industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the roles of different Sn species as well as the coking behaviors are still undiscovered."
[2] "For metal oxide-based catalysts, various species exist on their surfaces. For example, there are various kinds of Cr species (such as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, Cr2+, isolated Cr, oligomeric Crn+, and crystalline Cr2O3) and Ga species (such as Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and polymorphs of gallium oxides) that exist on CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which makes it difficult to identify the actual active sites, especially under PDH reaction conditions."

Research on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts remains a great challenge. Metal oxides such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts have been widely developed with the expectation that they could be superior alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts. However, their dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared with the industrial catalysts. In addition, the types of supports, promoters and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures. Therefore, developing novel efficient methods to further improve their dehydrogenation performance is highly desired.

研究替代传统的金属和金属氧化物基催化剂仍然是一个巨大的挑战。例如，VOx-和GaOx基催化剂已经被广泛开发，期望它们可以作为CrOx基和Pt基催化剂的更优替代品。然而，它们的脱氢性能仍然无法与工业催化剂相媲美。此外，支持物、促进剂和制备方法对催化剂结构有显著影响。因此，开发新型高效方法进一步提高它们的脱氢性能是十分必要的。
