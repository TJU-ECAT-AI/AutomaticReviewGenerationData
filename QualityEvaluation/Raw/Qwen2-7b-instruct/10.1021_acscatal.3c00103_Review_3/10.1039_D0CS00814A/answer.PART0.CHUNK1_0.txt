(1) The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by exploiting the anchoring force of hydroxyl groups on the crystal surface. This method allows for the precise placement of metal compounds in the crystal lattice, thereby enhancing metal-support interactions. This leads to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions, as the metal compounds are more effectively anchored and less prone to leaching or sintering.

(2) The roles of different Sn species as well as the coking behaviors on metal oxide-based catalysts, specifically in the context of propane dehydrogenation, are still not fully understood. This lack of knowledge hinders the optimization of catalyst performance and the development of strategies to mitigate coke formation.

(3) The types of supports, promoters, and preparation methods significantly influence the structure and performance of metal oxide-based catalysts. Tailoring these factors can lead to the development of catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. However, the optimization of these parameters requires a deep understanding of their impact on catalyst properties.

(4) Operando/in situ characterization techniques, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM), are essential for elucidating the dynamic behavior of catalysts under reaction conditions. These techniques enable researchers to monitor the evolution of catalyst structures and properties in real-time, providing insights into the mechanisms of catalytic reactions and the factors affecting catalyst performance.

(5) Establishing a universal relationship between catalyst structure and activity is a pressing challenge. This requires a systematic investigation of how different structural features correlate with catalytic performance, allowing for the rational design of catalysts with optimized properties.

(6) The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures, such as single atom catalysts, presents significant technical challenges. These catalysts require precise control over the synthesis process to achieve the desired structure, which is crucial for their performance in solid-gas reactions. The development of new synthesis methods and materials science techniques is needed to overcome these challenges and facilitate the scale-up of production.
