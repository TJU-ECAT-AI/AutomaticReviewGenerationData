[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by anchoring the metal species onto the crystal surface through hydroxyl groups. This method ensures a precise and stable connection between the metal and the support, thereby enhancing metal-support interactions."
[2] "This enhanced interaction leads to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The hydroxyl anchoring method offers better control over the catalyst's structure and composition, contributing to more efficient and selective catalytic processes."
