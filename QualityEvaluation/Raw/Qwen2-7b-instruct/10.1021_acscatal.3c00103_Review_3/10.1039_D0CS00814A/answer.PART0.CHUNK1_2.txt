[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by anchoring them to hydroxyl groups present on the crystal surface. This method allows for precise control over the location and concentration of the metal species on the support."
[2] "This approach significantly improves metal-support interactions by creating strong chemical bonds between the metal and the support. It enables the preparation of heterogeneous catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability due to the optimized distribution and interaction of the active metal species."

The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for the precise incorporation of active metal compounds into crystal materials by attaching them to hydroxyl groups on the crystal surface. This method leads to enhanced metal-support interactions, which are crucial for preparing heterogeneous catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability in solid-gas reactions.
