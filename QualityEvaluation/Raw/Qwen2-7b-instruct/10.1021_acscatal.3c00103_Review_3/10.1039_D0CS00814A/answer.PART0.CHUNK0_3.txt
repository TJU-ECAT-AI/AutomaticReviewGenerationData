The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the hydroxyl groups from the crystal support. These hydroxyl groups act as anchors, enabling precise placement of metal compounds within the crystal lattice. This approach enhances metal-support interactions by creating strong binding sites for the metal species, which in turn improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The precise control over the incorporation ensures optimal positioning of active sites, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.
