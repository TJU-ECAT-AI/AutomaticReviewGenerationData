[1] "In this review, we have summarized current understandings of catalyst development, new chemistry, and emerging technologies in catalytic propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "However, steps will need to be taken to overcome drawbacks of this reaction and improve the energy efficiency, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
[3] "Additionally, great efforts have been made to improve the performances of CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts by using various strategies. However, further improvements with lower noble metal loadings and deactivation rates are highly desired."
[4] "Moreover, advanced characterization and deeper discussion of active sites and reaction mechanisms under reaction conditions are still inadequate."
[5] "Although grand opportunities exist, several major challenges in the aspects of dehydrogenation technologies, catalyst development and characterization as well as theoretical stimulation methods should be considered."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by exploiting the unique properties of hydroxyl groups on the crystal surface. These hydroxyl groups can serve as strong anchoring sites for metal ions, leading to the formation of well-defined metal clusters or nanoparticles with precise sizes and compositions. This method allows for the precise control of metal-support interactions, which can significantly enhance the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By tuning the properties of the hydroxyl groups, such as their concentration, distribution, and functionalization, the catalytic performance can be further optimized. This technique offers a powerful tool for the development of advanced catalysts with tailored properties for various industrial applications, including but not limited to, catalytic conversions, environmental remediation, and energy-related processes.

在这一综述中，我们总结了催化丙烷脱氢反应中催化剂开发、新化学和新兴技术的当前理解。然而，仍需要采取步骤来克服该反应的缺点并提高能源效率，即有限的平衡转化率和高温下普遍存在副反应的问题。此外，已经对CrOx-和Pt基催化剂进行了大量努力以通过使用各种策略改进其性能。然而，进一步改进具有较低贵金属负载和脱活率是高度期望的。同时，高级表征和深入讨论反应条件下的活性位点和反应机制仍然是不足的。尽管存在巨大的机会，但在脱氢技术、催化剂开发和表征以及理论刺激方法方面仍然存在几个重大挑战。

羟基锚定方法通过利用晶体表面独特性质，为活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺杂提供途径。这些羟基可以作为强大的锚定点，促进金属离子的形成，从而得到精确尺寸和组成的小簇或纳米颗粒。这种方法允许对金属-支持相互作用进行精确控制，显著增强异质催化剂在固-气反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。通过调整羟基的性质，如浓度、分布和功能化，催化性能可以进一步优化。这项技术为各种工业应用中开发具有特定位点的先进催化剂提供了强有力的工具，包括但不限于催化转换、环境修复和能源相关过程。
