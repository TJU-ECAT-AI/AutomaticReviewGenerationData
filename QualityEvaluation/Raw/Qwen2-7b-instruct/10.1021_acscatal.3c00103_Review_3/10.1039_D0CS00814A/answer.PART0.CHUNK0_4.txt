1. In the past few decades, various heterogeneous catalysts such as metal-based catalysts, metal oxide-based catalysts, and non-oxide-based catalysts (including Pt, CrOx, VOx, GaOx, ZrO2, carbides, nitrides, and carbon materials) have been used in direct PDH reactions due to their affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and low CC cleavage activity, exhibiting high performance.

2. Chromium oxide is more complex in nature compared to platinum, making it difficult to explain the reaction and deactivation mechanisms. Fresh chromium oxide catalysts contain various chromium ions with different valence states (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+) that play distinct roles in the PDH process.

3. Particle size and crystalline phase alterations can significantly adjust the concentration of Zrcus cations. Techniques such as doping and pretreatment with a reductive atmosphere are effective in generating Zrcus cations, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance.

1. 在过去的几十年里，包括铂、铬氧化物、氧钒、镓氧化物、锆氧化物、碳化物、氮化物和碳材料在内的多种异质催化剂由于它们对烷基碳氢键的亲和力以及对CC键断裂的低活性，在直接PDH反应中得到了应用，并表现出高效率。

2. 铬氧化物的复杂性比铂要大，因此很难解释其反应和失活机制。新鲜的铬氧化物催化剂中含有不同价态的铬离子（Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+、和Cr2+），这些离子在PDH过程中扮演着不同的角色。

3. 粒子大小和晶相的改变可以显著调节Zrcus离子的浓度。通过掺杂或在还原性气氛下预处理等方法生成Zrcus离子是提高催化性能的有效途径。
