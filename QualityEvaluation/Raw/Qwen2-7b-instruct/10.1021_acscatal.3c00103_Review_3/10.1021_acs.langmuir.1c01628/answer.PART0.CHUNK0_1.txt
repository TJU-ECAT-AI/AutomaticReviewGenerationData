[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through the formation of strong interaction between hydroxyl groups on the crystal surface and the metal centers."
[2] "This method enhances metal-support interactions by creating a stable interface, which improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."

The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for the precise addition of active metal components into crystal structures by exploiting the strong bond between hydroxyl groups on the crystal's surface and the metal centers. This technique strengthens the interaction between metals and supports, thereby boosting the efficiency, specificity, and durability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
