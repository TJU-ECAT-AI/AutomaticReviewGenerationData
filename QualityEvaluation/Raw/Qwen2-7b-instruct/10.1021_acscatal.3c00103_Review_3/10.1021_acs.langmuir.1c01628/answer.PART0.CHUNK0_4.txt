The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a facile strategy that enables precise integration of these compounds into the crystal lattice. This leads to strong interactions between the metal species and the support material, enhancing metal-support interactions. As a result, this method contributes to improved catalytic performance, specifically by increasing activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
