[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a strong interaction between the metal species and the surface of the crystal."
[2] "This method enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."
