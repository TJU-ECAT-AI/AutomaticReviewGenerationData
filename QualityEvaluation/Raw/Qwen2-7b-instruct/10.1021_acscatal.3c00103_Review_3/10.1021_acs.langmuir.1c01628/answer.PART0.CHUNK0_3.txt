[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a stable and selective attachment site."
[2] "This leads to enhanced metal-support interactions due to the strong bonding between hydroxyl groups on the support and metal ions."
[3] "The improved metal-support interactions result in better activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."

The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the precise addition of active metal components to crystal materials by offering a secure and targeted attachment point. This results in strengthened interactions between the metal and the support surface, thanks to the potent bond formed between hydroxyl groups on the support and metal ions. Consequently, these enhanced interactions contribute to increased efficiency, selectivity, and durability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
