          [1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials."
          [2] "This facilitates enhanced metal-support interactions."
          [3] "As a result, it improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
          The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the precise integration of active metal components within crystal structures by creating robust coordination bonds between hydroxyl groups and metal nuclei. This results in strengthened interactions between metals and supports, which in turn enhances the performance of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions, specifically boosting their activity, selectivity, and durability.
