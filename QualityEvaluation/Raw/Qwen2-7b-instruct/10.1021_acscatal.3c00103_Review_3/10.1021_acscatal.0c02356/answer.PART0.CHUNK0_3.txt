<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by enabling precise control over their integration. This precision leads to the formation of strong interactions between metals and supports, which in turn enhances the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
