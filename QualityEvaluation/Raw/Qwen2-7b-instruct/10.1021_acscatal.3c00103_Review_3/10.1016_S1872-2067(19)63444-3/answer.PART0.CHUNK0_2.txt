The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by enabling precise placement within these materials. This leads to the formation of strong interactions between the metals and the support material, optimizing their accessibility to reactants and products. As a consequence, this enhances the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
