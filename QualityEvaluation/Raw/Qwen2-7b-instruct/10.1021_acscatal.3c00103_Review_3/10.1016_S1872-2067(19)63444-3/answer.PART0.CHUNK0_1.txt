<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing precise control over their integration. This method improves metal-support interactions, which in turn enhances the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
