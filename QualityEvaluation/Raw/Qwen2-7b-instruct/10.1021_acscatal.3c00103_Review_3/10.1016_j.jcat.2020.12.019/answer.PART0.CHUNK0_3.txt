<p>Recently, the propane dehydrogenation over single-site catalysts has received considerable interest, and the well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway [18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] . Loading metal species onto metal oxide, such as SiO2 and Al2O3, is a common way for the fabrication of single-site catalysts, and the obtained isolated metal oxide species deliver high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction [21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[27] . A high selectivity to propylene above 95% can be achieved in the silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst for propane dehydrogenation reaction, and in-situ characterization studies reveal that single-site Zn(II) ions located in the strained three-membered siloxane rings on the amorphous silica surface are the active site for propane dehydrogenation reaction [22] ,[25] . The single-site Co2+ on SiO2 with a tetrahedral coordination also exhibits high selectivity > 95% at 550 C with stable activity over 24 h for propane dehydrogenation. Calculations with hybrid density functional theory suggests a non-redox mechanism for activation of C-H and H-H bonds by Co2+ similar to the pathway of single-site Zn2+/SiO2 [27] . The mononuclear alumina-supported single-site Ga sites show much higher activity in propane dehydrogenation than their dinuclear silica-supported counterparts, and the propane dehydrogenation reaction requires the presence of Al-O-Ga bonds to promote heterolytic C-H bond activation [23] ,[24] .</p>
<p>The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst [26] ,[28] , and the isolated metal species in zeolite display enhanced stability due to the strong anchoring effect of the framework structure. The iron-silicate zeolites show high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction, and a redox catalytic cycle occurring over the isolated or single-site Fe framework sites in Fe-zeolites for the formation of propane radical cations is suggested to the reaction mechanism in propane dehydrogenation [28] . The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization [30] ,[31] . As a matter of fact, the Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report [32] . Nevertheless, the Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component [32] ,[33] ,[34] . Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation.</p>

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the strong anchoring effect of the zeolite framework structure. This method ensures that metal species, such as Sn, are isomorphously substituted into the zeolite lattice, leading to the formation of isolated metal species. These isolated metal species exhibit enhanced stability and strong interactions with the zeolite framework, which contributes to improved activity, selectivity, and stability in heterogeneous catalysts for solid-gas reactions. The presence of hydroxyl groups in the zeolite framework provides a suitable environment for the anchoring of metal ions, creating active sites that are responsible for the desired catalytic transformations. In the case of Sn-Beta zeolite, the single-site Sn atoms are anchored in the BEA framework, enabling high performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions with excellent selectivity and stability.

在晶态材料中可控地引入活性金属化合物的方法是通过利用沸石框架结构的强锚定作用。这种方法确保金属物种，如Sn，以等同置换的方式插入到沸石晶体中，从而形成孤立的金属物种。这些孤立的金属物种由于与沸石框架的强相互作用而表现出增强的稳定性。这有助于提高异质催化剂在固相气体反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。沸石框架中羟基的存在为金属离子提供了合适的环境，从而形成负责所需催化转化的活性位点。对于Sn-Beta沸石而言，单个Sn原子被锚定在BEA框架中，这使得其在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出高活性、高选择性和优异的稳定性。
