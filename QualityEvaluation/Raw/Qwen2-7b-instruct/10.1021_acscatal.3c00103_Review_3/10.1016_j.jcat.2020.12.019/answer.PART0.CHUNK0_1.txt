[1] "A series of Sn-Beta catalysts with a unique single-site Sn structure are developed for propane dehydrogenation reaction to produce propylene."
[2] "The incorporation of Sn species into Beta zeolite structure has no evident effect on its structure."
[3] "The amount of coke deposition in these two catalysts can be quantified by the thermogravimetric (TG) analysis ( Figure S11 )."
[4] "Based on the propane transformation over H-Beta and Sn-Beta zeolites, it is reasonable to propose that the Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction."
[5] "These efficient Na-Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts for the production of propylene."
[6] "Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise placement of metal species within the crystal lattice. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The method ensures that metals are anchored within the framework structure, providing a stable environment that optimizes their catalytic properties.

2. The implications of using the hydroxyl anchoring method for enhancing metal-support interactions include achieving higher activity and selectivity in catalytic processes due to optimized metal positioning within the crystal matrix. Additionally, the method contributes to catalyst stability by reducing the risk of metal migration or agglomeration, which are common issues in heterogeneous catalysis. This results in more efficient and robust catalysts suitable for various industrial applications requiring solid-gas reactions.
