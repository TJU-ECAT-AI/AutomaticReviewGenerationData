<p>The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst.</p>
<p>The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing the metals to be anchored within the zeolite structure, leading to enhanced metal-support interactions.</p>
<p>This method improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions by ensuring the metals are precisely positioned within the zeolite framework, which can optimize their reactivity and prevent leaching during catalytic processes.</p>

The hydroxyl anchoring method helps incorporate active metal compounds into crystal materials by embedding them within the zeolite structure, thereby strengthening the interactions between the metals and the support. This leads to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability in heterogeneous catalysts for solid-gas reactions, as the precise positioning of metals within the zeolite framework optimizes their reactivity and reduces the risk of leaching during the catalytic process.
