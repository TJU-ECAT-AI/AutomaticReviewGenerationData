<p>The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst.</p>
<p>The well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway.</p>
<p>Loading metal species onto metal oxide, such as SiO2 and Al2O3, is a common way for the fabrication of single-site catalysts, and the obtained isolated metal oxide species deliver high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report.</p>
<p>Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.</p>

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by embedding them within the zeolite framework. This method enhances metal-support interactions by ensuring the metals are anchored in the zeolite's porous structure. As a result, the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are improved. The Sn-Beta zeolite serves as a prime example where single-site Sn atoms are introduced into the framework, leading to high-performance catalysts in processes like propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations further suggest that the dehydrogenation reaction occurs specifically on the Lewis acid sites originating from the single-site Sn atoms, highlighting the importance of the hydroxyl anchoring method in optimizing catalytic performance.

水合锚定方法通过将活性金属化合物嵌入晶体制剂中，实现了对晶体材料中活性金属化合物的可控引入。这种方法通过确保金属被锚定在沸石的多孔结构中，增强了金属-支撑之间的相互作用。因此，它提高了在固态气体反应中的异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。Sn-Beta沸石是一个典型的例子，其中单个Sn原子被引入到框架中，导致在如丙烷脱氢等过程中的高性能催化剂。理论计算进一步表明，脱氢反应发生在单个Sn原子产生的Lewis酸位点上，这突出了水合锚定方法在优化催化性能方面的关键作用。
