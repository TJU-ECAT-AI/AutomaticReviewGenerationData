The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by embedding them within the zeolite lattice or framework. This method enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By creating isolated metal single atoms within the zeolite structure, the catalysts can selectively activate specific chemical bonds, such as the C-H bond in propane, leading to efficient dehydrogenation processes. Theoretical calculations support that the dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites derived from the single-site metal atoms, specifically in this case, the single-site Sn atoms in the zeolitic framework.

通过将活性金属化合物嵌入到沸石晶格或框架中，羟基锚定方法实现了对晶体材料中活性金属化合物的可控掺杂。这种方法增强了金属支持相互作用，从而提高了在固态气体反应中的异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。通过在沸石结构内形成孤立的金属单原子，可以实现催化剂对特定化学键的选择性活化，如丙烷中的C-H键，进而实现高效的脱氢过程。理论计算表明，脱氢发生在源自沸石框架中单个金属原子的Lewis酸位点上，具体而言是在沸石中单个Sn原子形成的Lewis酸位点上。
