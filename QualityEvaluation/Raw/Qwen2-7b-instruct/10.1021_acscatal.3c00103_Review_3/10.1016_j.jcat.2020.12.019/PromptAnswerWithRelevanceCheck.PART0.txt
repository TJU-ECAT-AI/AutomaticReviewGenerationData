The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by embedding them within the zeolite lattice or framework. This method enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By creating isolated metal single atoms within the zeolite structure, the catalysts can selectively activate specific chemical bonds, such as the C-H bond in propane, leading to efficient dehydrogenation processes. Theoretical calculations support that the dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites derived from the single-site metal atoms, specifically in this case, the single-site Sn atoms in the zeolitic framework.

通过将活性金属化合物嵌入到沸石晶格或框架中，羟基锚定方法实现了对晶体材料中活性金属化合物的可控掺杂。这种方法增强了金属支持相互作用，从而提高了在固态气体反应中的异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。通过在沸石结构内形成孤立的金属单原子，可以实现催化剂对特定化学键的选择性活化，如丙烷中的C-H键，进而实现高效的脱氢过程。理论计算表明，脱氢发生在源自沸石框架中单个金属原子的Lewis酸位点上，具体而言是在沸石中单个Sn原子形成的Lewis酸位点上。

[1] "A series of Sn-Beta catalysts with a unique single-site Sn structure are developed for propane dehydrogenation reaction to produce propylene."
[2] "The incorporation of Sn species into Beta zeolite structure has no evident effect on its structure."
[3] "The amount of coke deposition in these two catalysts can be quantified by the thermogravimetric (TG) analysis ( Figure S11 )."
[4] "Based on the propane transformation over H-Beta and Sn-Beta zeolites, it is reasonable to propose that the Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction."
[5] "These efficient Na-Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts for the production of propylene."
[6] "Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise placement of metal species within the crystal lattice. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The method ensures that metals are anchored within the framework structure, providing a stable environment that optimizes their catalytic properties.

2. The implications of using the hydroxyl anchoring method for enhancing metal-support interactions include achieving higher activity and selectivity in catalytic processes due to optimized metal positioning within the crystal matrix. Additionally, the method contributes to catalyst stability by reducing the risk of metal migration or agglomeration, which are common issues in heterogeneous catalysis. This results in more efficient and robust catalysts suitable for various industrial applications requiring solid-gas reactions.

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by embedding them within the zeolite framework. This method enhances metal-support interactions by ensuring the metals are anchored in the zeolite's porous structure. As a result, the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are improved. The Sn-Beta zeolite serves as a prime example where single-site Sn atoms are introduced into the framework, leading to high-performance catalysts in processes like propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations further suggest that the dehydrogenation reaction occurs specifically on the Lewis acid sites originating from the single-site Sn atoms, highlighting the importance of the hydroxyl anchoring method in optimizing catalytic performance.

<p>Recently, the propane dehydrogenation over single-site catalysts has received considerable interest, and the well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway [18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] . Loading metal species onto metal oxide, such as SiO2 and Al2O3, is a common way for the fabrication of single-site catalysts, and the obtained isolated metal oxide species deliver high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction [21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[27] . A high selectivity to propylene above 95% can be achieved in the silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst for propane dehydrogenation reaction, and in-situ characterization studies reveal that single-site Zn(II) ions located in the strained three-membered siloxane rings on the amorphous silica surface are the active site for propane dehydrogenation reaction [22] ,[25] . The single-site Co2+ on SiO2 with a tetrahedral coordination also exhibits high selectivity > 95% at 550 C with stable activity over 24 h for propane dehydrogenation. Calculations with hybrid density functional theory suggests a non-redox mechanism for activation of C-H and H-H bonds by Co2+ similar to the pathway of single-site Zn2+/SiO2 [27] . The mononuclear alumina-supported single-site Ga sites show much higher activity in propane dehydrogenation than their dinuclear silica-supported counterparts, and the propane dehydrogenation reaction requires the presence of Al-O-Ga bonds to promote heterolytic C-H bond activation [23] ,[24] .</p>
<p>The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst [26] ,[28] , and the isolated metal species in zeolite display enhanced stability due to the strong anchoring effect of the framework structure. The iron-silicate zeolites show high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction, and a redox catalytic cycle occurring over the isolated or single-site Fe framework sites in Fe-zeolites for the formation of propane radical cations is suggested to the reaction mechanism in propane dehydrogenation [28] . The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization [30] ,[31] . As a matter of fact, the Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report [32] . Nevertheless, the Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component [32] ,[33] ,[34] . Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation.</p>

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the strong anchoring effect of the zeolite framework structure. This method ensures that metal species, such as Sn, are isomorphously substituted into the zeolite lattice, leading to the formation of isolated metal species. These isolated metal species exhibit enhanced stability and strong interactions with the zeolite framework, which contributes to improved activity, selectivity, and stability in heterogeneous catalysts for solid-gas reactions. The presence of hydroxyl groups in the zeolite framework provides a suitable environment for the anchoring of metal ions, creating active sites that are responsible for the desired catalytic transformations. In the case of Sn-Beta zeolite, the single-site Sn atoms are anchored in the BEA framework, enabling high performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions with excellent selectivity and stability.

在晶态材料中可控地引入活性金属化合物的方法是通过利用沸石框架结构的强锚定作用。这种方法确保金属物种，如Sn，以等同置换的方式插入到沸石晶体中，从而形成孤立的金属物种。这些孤立的金属物种由于与沸石框架的强相互作用而表现出增强的稳定性。这有助于提高异质催化剂在固相气体反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。沸石框架中羟基的存在为金属离子提供了合适的环境，从而形成负责所需催化转化的活性位点。对于Sn-Beta沸石而言，单个Sn原子被锚定在BEA框架中，这使得其在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出高活性、高选择性和优异的稳定性。
