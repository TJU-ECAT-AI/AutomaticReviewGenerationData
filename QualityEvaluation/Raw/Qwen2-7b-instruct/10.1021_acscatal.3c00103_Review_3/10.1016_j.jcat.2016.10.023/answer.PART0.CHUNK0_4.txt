[1] "Coke formation is ubiquitous in catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons and plays a decisive role in determining catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity."
[2] "In addition to their industrial relevance, these catalysts provide a convenient model for characterizing chemically-homogeneous carbon deposits."
[3] "Unlike previous reports focusing primarily on fully-formed graphene deposits, this study also characterizes the initial stages of carbon deposition and burning in order to elucidate the mobility of surface species in more detail."

The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the controlled addition of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing hydroxyl groups to anchor the metal compounds. This enhances metal-support interactions, thereby improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The method facilitates precise control over the incorporation of metals, which is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance. By controlling the metal-support interactions, the hydroxyl anchoring method ensures efficient and selective catalysis, making it a valuable tool in the design and synthesis of advanced catalysts.
