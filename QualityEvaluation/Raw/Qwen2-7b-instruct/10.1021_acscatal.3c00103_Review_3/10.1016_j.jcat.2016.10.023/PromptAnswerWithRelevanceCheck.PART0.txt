[1] "Coke deposition was characterized on a 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox dehydrogenation catalyst upon its exposure to C3H8 at 923 K in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments and low-pressure transient TAP experiments."
[2] "Time-resolved TAP experiments with a variable time delay between successive sequences of C3H8 pulses revealed that the most active non-selective Pt sites deactivated by C3H8 are spontaneously uncovered in vacuum within minutes."
[3] "DFT calculations support the assignment of these observations to a combination of (i) C3-to-C1 conversion followed by the migration of coke precursors from dehydrogenation sites toward the sites of graphene assembly and (ii) restructuring of Pt nanoparticles under the influence of carbon deposits, which leads to the formation of new Pt sites."
[4] "According to TEM, the morphology of mature carbonaceous deposits obtained in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments corresponds to extended graphene sheets which originate on small (1.52 nm) Pt nanoparticles and continuously shift onto the support."

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the controlled introduction of active metal compounds into crystal materials by exploiting the specific interactions between hydroxyl groups and metal ions. This facilitates the precise positioning and orientation of metals, thereby enhancing their interaction with the support matrix. Such enhanced interactions lead to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

2. The TAP experiments revealed that the most active, non-selective platinum sites on the catalyst, which are responsible for hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation of propane, are spontaneously uncovered within minutes when the propane exposure is paused. This spontaneous uncovering suggests a dynamic process of carbon precursors migrating from the dehydrogenation sites towards the sites of graphene assembly, along with surface restructuring of the platinum nanoparticles influenced by carbon deposits.

3. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations support the findings from the TAP experiments by explaining the uncovered Pt sites through a combination of two processes: the conversion of propane fragments into simpler compounds (C1 species) and the migration of these precursors towards the graphene assembly sites. Additionally, the restructuring of the platinum nanoparticles under the influence of carbon deposits leads to the creation of new active sites on the surface.

4. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed that the mature carbon deposits formed on the catalyst have an extended graphene structure. These graphene sheets originate from small (1.52 nm) platinum nanoparticles and extend onto the support surface, causing deformations and entanglements in the graphene layers due to the support's basic properties.

1. 氢氧基锚定方法通过利用氢氧基团与金属离子之间的特定相互作用，实现了活性金属化合物在晶态材料中的可控引入。这促进了金属与载体矩阵之间精确定位和定向的能力，从而增强了它们的相互作用。这种增强的相互作用导致了异质催化剂在固相气体反应中表现出改进的活性、选择性和稳定性。

2. TAP实验揭示了在暂停丙烷暴露时，由丙烷活化产生的最活跃的非选择性铂位点在几分钟内自发恢复活性。这一自发恢复表明了一个动态过程，其中碳前体从脱氢化位点迁移到石墨烯组装位点，同时铂纳米粒子表面发生重构，受碳沉积的影响。

3. 密度泛函理论（DFT）计算支持了TAP实验的结果，通过两种过程解释了暴露在碳前体中的铂位点的恢复：丙烷碎片转化为更简单的化合物（C1物种），以及这些前体向石墨烯组装位点的迁移。此外，在碳沉积影响下，铂纳米粒子表面的重构导致了新活性位点的形成。

4. 透射电子显微镜（TEM）分析显示了催化剂上形成的成熟碳沉积物具有扩展的石墨烯结构。这些石墨烯层起源于直径为1.52 nm的小型铂纳米颗粒，并延伸至支持表面，导致石墨烯层发生变形和缠结，这是由于支持的碱性性质。

<p>However, the fact that multiple TPO peaks are also observed on the inert and basic supports suggests that multiplicity of TPO peaks can result from other factors such as the mobility of the surface species that participate in coke formation and oxidation.</p>

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a stable and uniform anchoring site for the metal ions. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The implications of this method are significant, as it enables the precise control over the metal-support interface, which is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance. By ensuring a strong and consistent bond between the metal and the support, the hydroxyl anchoring method can lead to catalysts with enhanced efficiency and longevity in various industrial applications.
