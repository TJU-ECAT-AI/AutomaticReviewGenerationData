[1] "Coke deposition was characterized on a 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox dehydrogenation catalyst upon its exposure to C3H8 at 923 K in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments and low-pressure transient TAP experiments."
[2] "Time-resolved TAP experiments with a variable time delay between successive sequences of C3H8 pulses revealed that the most active non-selective Pt sites deactivated by C3H8 are spontaneously uncovered in vacuum within minutes."
[3] "DFT calculations support the assignment of these observations to a combination of (i) C3-to-C1 conversion followed by the migration of coke precursors from dehydrogenation sites toward the sites of graphene assembly and (ii) restructuring of Pt nanoparticles under the influence of carbon deposits, which leads to the formation of new Pt sites."
[4] "According to TEM, the morphology of mature carbonaceous deposits obtained in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments corresponds to extended graphene sheets which originate on small (1.52 nm) Pt nanoparticles and continuously shift onto the support."

1. Coke deposition was studied on a 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst exposed to C3H8 at 923 K using atmospheric-pressure flow experiments and low-pressure transient TAP experiments.
2. Time-resolved TAP experiments showed that the most active non-selective Pt sites deactivated by C3H8 are spontaneously uncovered in vacuum within minutes.
3. DFT calculations support the idea that the uncovered sites are due to C3-to-C1 conversion, migration of coke precursors towards graphene assembly sites, and restructuring of Pt nanoparticles influenced by carbon deposits.
4. TEM images revealed that the mature carbon deposits on the catalyst have the form of extended graphene sheets originating from small Pt nanoparticles and spreading onto the support.

1. 在923 K下使用大气压力流动实验和低压力瞬态TAP实验对0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox催化剂上的焦炭沉积进行了研究。
2. 时间分辨的TAP实验表明，被C3H8活性化的非选择性Pt位点在真空环境中在几分钟内自发暴露出来。
3. DFT计算支持以下观点：暴露的位点是由于C3到C1的转换、焦炭前体向石墨烯组装位点迁移以及受碳沉积影响的Pt纳米粒子重构。
4. 透射电子显微镜图像显示，催化剂上的成熟碳沉积物呈扩展的石墨烯片状结构，起源于小的Pt纳米颗粒并向支撑扩散。
