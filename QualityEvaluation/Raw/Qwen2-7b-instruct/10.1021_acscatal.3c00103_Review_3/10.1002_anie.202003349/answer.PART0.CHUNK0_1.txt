<p>Significantly, the introduction of Zn species coupled with subnanometer Pt clusters remarkably improved the propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. The initial propylene selectivity was improved with increasing Zn content due to the formation of more bimetallic Pt-Zn alloys, and the initial propylene selectivity of PtZn4@S-1-H reached 93.2%, much higher than that of Pt@S-1-H (79.0%).</p>
<p>The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst retained high propane conversion (44.8%) and high propylene selectivity (98.9%) after 1200min on stream. To further illustrate the influence of the Zn content in PtZn@S-1-H sample on catalytic performance, PtZn8@S-1-H with a Zn/Pt ratio of 7.56 (determined by ICP measurement) was prepared and the TEM images of PtZn8@S-1-H are shown in FigureS22. Catalytic test revealed that as compared PtZn4@S-1-H, the PtZn8@S-1-H possessed higher initial propylene selectivity up to 97.7% at 550C with a WHSV of 3.6h1.</p>
<p>Moreover, the PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst demonstrated an extremely high specific activity of propylene formation (65.5mol gPt1h1) with a WHSV of 108h1 and propylene selectivity (99.3%, WHSV=3.654h1) at 550C. No obvious deactivation was observed even after 13000 min on stream without co-feeding H2 (WHSV=3.6h1), representing the highest stability among all state-of-the-art Pt-based heterogeneous catalysts for the PDH reaction.</p>

1. The introduction of zinc species notably enhanced the propylene selectivity and catalytic stability of the platinum clusters. The initial propylene selectivity increased with higher zinc content due to the creation of more platinum-zinc binary alloys. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst maintained high propane conversion (44.8%) and high propylene selectivity (98.9%) after 1200 minutes of operation. By comparing PtZn4@S-1-H with PtZn8@S-1-H, which had a zinc-to-platinum ratio of 7.56, the latter displayed a higher initial propylene selectivity up to 97.7% at 550°C with a WHSV of 3.6h1.

2. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited an exceptionally high specific activity of propylene formation (65.5 mol/gPt/h) with a WHSV of 108h1 and a propylene selectivity of 99.3% at 3.654h1. No noticeable deactivation occurred even after 13000 minutes of operation without co-supplying hydrogen (WHSV=3.6h1), surpassing the stability of other state-of-the-art Pt-based heterogeneous catalysts for PDH reactions.

3. The introduction of Cs+ ions led to improved catalyst regeneration performance, and the catalytic activity remained consistent after four successive regeneration cycles.

1. 随着锌含量的增加，由于形成了更多的铂-锌二元合金，引入锌物种显著提高了丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。与铂@S-1-H相比，PtZn8@S-1-H在550°C和WHSV为3.6h1时，初始丙烯选择性达到了97.7%，比PtZn4@S-1-H高。

2. 在13000分钟的操作时间内，没有补充氢气（WHSV=3.6h1），PtZn4@S-1-H催化剂表现出极高的丙烯生成特定活性（65.5 mol/gPt/h）和丙烯选择性（99.3%）在3.654h1下。这是迄今为止所有先进钯基异质催化剂在PDH反应中表现出的最高稳定性。

3. 引入Cs+离子显著提高了催化剂的再生性能，并且在四个连续再生周期后，催化活性保持稳定。
