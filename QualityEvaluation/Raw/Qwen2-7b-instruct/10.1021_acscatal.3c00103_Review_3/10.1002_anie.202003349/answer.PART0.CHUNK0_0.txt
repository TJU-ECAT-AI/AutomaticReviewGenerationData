<p>Significantly, the introduction of Zn species coupled with subnanometer Pt clusters remarkably improved the propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. The initial propylene selectivity was improved with increasing Zn content due to the formation of more bimetallic Pt-Zn alloys, and the initial propylene selectivity of PtZn4@S-1-H reached 93.2%, much higher than that of Pt@S-1-H (79.0%). The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst retained high propane conversion (44.8%) and high propylene selectivity (98.9%) after 1200min on stream.</p>
<p>Moreover, under high WHSV of 27h1, a propane conversion of 21.8% with 99.3% selectivity for propylene over PtZn4@S-1-H was achieved after 6300min on stream.</p>
<p>All of the above results demonstrate that bimetallic PtZn4@S-1-H possesses extremely high long-term stability, far superior to that of monometallic Pt@S-1-H.</p>
<p>Note that the propane conversion over PtZn4/Al2O3 decreased remarkably from 32.3% to 8.8% within 400min on stream, giving a deactivation constant of 0.2h1, which indicated that the deactivation rate of PtZn4/Al2O3 is 200times faster than that of PtZn4@S-1-H under the same condition.</p>
<p>The above results indicate that encaging metal species inside the zeolites can significantly inhibit the generation of coke deposits and prolong the lifetime of catalysts.</p>
<p>Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions can remarkably improve the regeneration stability of PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst.</p>
<p>The regeneration activity of PtZn4@S-1-H catalysts was also examined. The PtZn4@S-1-H was first treated with air flow (10mLmin1) at 550C for 1h followed by a reduction process under an H2 flow. After two regeneration cycles, approximately 72% of an initial propane conversion can be kept while maintaining high propylene selectivity (99.4%) (FiguresS47 and S48).</p>

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by directly reducing metal compounds within the zeolite structure under hydrogen atmosphere. This approach leads to the formation of subnanometer-sized metal clusters, which enhances metal-support interactions. The introduction of Zn species promotes the formation of Pt-Zn alloy clusters, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst, for instance, exhibits a high propylene selectivity of 99.3% and a specific activity of 65.5 mol gPt-1h-1 at 550°C. The absence of obvious deactivation even after 13,000 minutes on stream demonstrates the catalyst's exceptional stability. Moreover, the presence of Cs+ ions significantly improves the regeneration stability, allowing the catalyst to maintain its activity after four successive regeneration cycles. This method provides a promising strategy for preparing high-performance catalysts for solid-gas reactions by encapsulating subnanometer PtZn clusters inside purely siliceous zeolites.

该羟基锚定方法通过在氢气气氛下直接在沸石结构内部还原活性金属化合物，从而实现对晶材料中活性金属组分的可控掺入。这导致形成纳米级大小的金属簇，增强了金属与载体之间的相互作用。引入Zn物种可以促进Pt-Zn合金簇的形成，进而提高催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。例如，PtZn4@S-1-H催化剂在550°C时表现出99.3%的丙烯选择性和每克铂每小时65.5摩尔的特定丙烯生成活性。即使在长达13,000分钟的连续运行后，催化剂也未表现出明显的失活现象，证明其具有出色的稳定性。此外，引入Cs+离子显著提高了再生稳定性，使得催化剂在经过四次连续再生循环后仍能保持其活性。这种方法为通过将亚纳米级的PtZn簇封装在纯硅沸石中来制备高效固体-气体反应催化剂提供了一种有前景的策略。
