<p>Significantly, the introduction of Zn species coupled with subnanometer Pt clusters remarkably improved the propylene selectivity and catalytic stability.</p>
<p>The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst retained high propane conversion (44.8%) and high propylene selectivity (98.9%) after 1200min on stream.</p>
<p>No obvious deactivation was observed even after 13000 on stream without co-feeding H2 (WHSV=3.6h1).</p>
<p>We also found that the introduction of Cs+ ions can significantly improve the regeneration performance and the catalytic activity remained stable after four successive regeneration cycles.</p>

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by using ligands to protect and encapsulate the metals within the zeolite framework. This method leads to enhanced metal-support interactions, improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By introducing zinc species alongside subnanometer platinum clusters, the propylene selectivity and catalytic stability are significantly improved. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst maintains high propane conversion and propylene selectivity after extensive use, indicating superior long-term stability. Additionally, the incorporation of cesium ions enhances the catalyst's regeneration stability, allowing it to retain its activity even after multiple regeneration cycles.
