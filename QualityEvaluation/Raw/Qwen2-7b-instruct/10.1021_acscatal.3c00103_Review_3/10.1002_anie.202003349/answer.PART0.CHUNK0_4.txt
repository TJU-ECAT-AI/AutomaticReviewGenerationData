<p>Significantly, the introduction of Zn species coupled with subnanometer Pt clusters remarkably improved the propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. The initial propylene selectivity was improved with increasing Zn content due to the formation of more bimetallic Pt-Zn alloys, and the initial propylene selectivity of PtZn4@S-1-H reached 93.2%, much higher than that of Pt@S-1-H (79.0%). The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst retained high propane conversion (44.8%) and high propylene selectivity (98.9%) after 1200min on stream. To further illustrate the influence of the Zn content in PtZn@S-1-H sample on catalytic performance, PtZn8@S-1-H with a Zn/Pt ratio of 7.56 (determined by ICP measurement) was prepared and the TEM images of PtZn8@S-1-H are shown in FigureS22. Catalytic test revealed that as compared PtZn4@S-1-H, the PtZn8@S-1-H possessed higher initial propylene selectivity up to 97.7% at 550C with a WHSV of 3.6h1 (FigureS23).</p>

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise placement and orientation of the metals within the zeolite structure. This is achieved through a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method, which effectively encapsulates subnanometer bimetallic PtZn clusters inside silicalite-1 zeolites. The introduction of Zn species notably enhances the stability and propylene selectivity of the Pt clusters, leading to improved catalytic performance. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibits exceptional activity, with a specific activity of propylene formation of 65.5mol gPt1h1 and a propylene selectivity of 99.3% at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.654h1. No significant deactivation was observed even after 13000 minutes on stream without co-feeding hydrogen (WHSV=3.6h1), demonstrating the catalyst's remarkable stability compared to other state-of-the-art Pt-based heterogeneous catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Additionally, the incorporation of Cs+ ions into the zeolite matrix improves the catalyst's regeneration stability, maintaining high activity even after four successive regeneration cycles.

该羟基锚定方法通过允许在沸石材料中精确放置和定向活性金属化合物，从而促进其在晶态材料中的可控掺入。这通过一种配体保护直接氢还原方法实现，有效地将亚纳米双金属PtZn簇封装在硅铝酸盐-1沸石中。引入Zn物种显著提高了Pt簇的稳定性和丙烯选择性，进而提升了催化性能。PtZn4@S-1-H催化剂表现出出色的活性，具有丙烯生成的特定活性为65.5mol gPt1h1和丙烯选择性为99.3%，在重量小时空速（WHSV）为3.654h1时。即使在不共喂氢气的情况下，在流下13000分钟（WHSV=3.6h1）后也未观察到明显的失活现象，这表明与当前最先进的基于铂的异质催化剂相比，该催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的稳定性极为出色。此外，向沸石晶格中引入Cs+离子可以显著提高催化剂的再生稳定性，即使经过四次连续再生周期，催化剂的活性仍保持不变。
