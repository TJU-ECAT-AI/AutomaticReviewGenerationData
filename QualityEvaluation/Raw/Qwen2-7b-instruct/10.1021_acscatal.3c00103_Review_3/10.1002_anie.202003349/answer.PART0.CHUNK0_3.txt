[1] "Herein we develop a ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method for encaging subnanometer PtZn clusters into silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) subject to direct hydrothermal crystallization; such an approach could effectively prevent from sintering of metal nanoclusters during the conventional calcination-reduction process, thus producing subnanometer metal clusters."
[2] "Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability, and the catalytic activity of the catalyst kept unchanged after four continuous cycles."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing ligands to protect and encapsulate metals within zeolite structures. This approach prevents sintering of metal nanoclusters during conventional calcination-reduction processes, enabling the formation of subnanometer metal clusters. The introduction of Cs+ ions further enhances the regeneration stability of the catalyst, allowing the activity to remain stable after multiple regeneration cycles.

羟基锚定方法通过利用配体来保护并封装在晶体材料中的活性金属化合物，从而实现对活性金属化合物的可控掺入。这种方法能够在常规煅烧还原过程中防止金属纳米团簇的聚集，从而产生亚纳米尺度的金属簇。引入Cs+离子进一步提高了催化剂的再生稳定性，使得在多次再生循环后催化剂的活性保持不变。
