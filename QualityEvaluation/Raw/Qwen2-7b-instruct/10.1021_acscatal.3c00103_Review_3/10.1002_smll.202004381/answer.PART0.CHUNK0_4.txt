[1] "The anchoring point(s), ligand body, and functional group(s) of the protecting ligands are all important considerations in improving the stability of Au NCs in solution."
[2] "The covalent bonds formed by the anchoring point of the ligands and the Au atoms on the NC surface are the key for their good stability in solution."
[3] "The good stability of NHC-protected Au NCs can be attributed to the stronger Au-carbene bond than Au-phosphine bond (0.9 eV increase in bonding strength) and Au-thiolate bond (25 kJ mol−1 increase in bonding energy)."

1. The anchoring point(s), ligand body, and functional group(s) of the protecting ligands are all crucial factors in enhancing the stability of Au NCs in solution.
2. The covalent bonds between the anchoring points and the Au atoms on the NC surface play a pivotal role in maintaining the stability of Au NCs in solution.
3. The superior stability of NHC-protected Au NCs is due to the enhanced bonding strength between the Au atoms and the NHC ligands, specifically a 0.9 eV increase in the Au-carbene bond and a 25 kJ mol−1 increase in the bonding energy compared to Au-thiolate bonds.

1. 定位点、配体主体和功能基团是保护配体在提高Au NC溶液稳定性方面的重要考虑因素。
2. 锚定点与Au原子之间的共价键在保持Au NC溶液稳定性中起着关键作用。
3. NHC保护的Au NC稳定性优越的原因在于Au原子与NHC配体之间增强的结合强度，具体表现为Au-碳烯键能增加0.9 eV以及与硫醇酯键相比，其结合能量增加了25 kJ mol−1。
