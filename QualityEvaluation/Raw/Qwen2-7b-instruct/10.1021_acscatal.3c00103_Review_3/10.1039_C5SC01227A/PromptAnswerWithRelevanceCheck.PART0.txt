The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a specific binding site on the crystal surface through the formation of a hydroxyl group. This method allows for precise placement and orientation of metal compounds, enhancing metal-support interactions. By improving these interactions, the method can lead to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for the precise placement of active metal compounds within the structure of crystal materials. This is achieved through the formation of strong interactions between hydroxyl groups on the crystal surface and the metal ions, leading to a more uniform and controlled distribution of the active sites across the catalyst surface. This method not only enhances the metal-support interactions by providing a stable anchoring point but also improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The improved stability ensures that the catalyst can withstand harsh reaction conditions, while the enhanced activity and selectivity are attributed to the optimized distribution and accessibility of the active sites, leading to more efficient conversion of reactants into desired products.
