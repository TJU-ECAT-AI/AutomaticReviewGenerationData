The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a specific binding site on the crystal surface through the formation of a hydroxyl group. This method allows for precise placement and orientation of metal compounds, enhancing metal-support interactions. By improving these interactions, the method can lead to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the systematic inclusion of active metal components within crystalline materials by creating a targeted attachment point via hydroxyl groups. This technique ensures the accurate positioning and alignment of metal components, thereby strengthening the bond between the metal and the support material. This enhancement in bond strength contributes to improved catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability in solid-gas reaction processes.
