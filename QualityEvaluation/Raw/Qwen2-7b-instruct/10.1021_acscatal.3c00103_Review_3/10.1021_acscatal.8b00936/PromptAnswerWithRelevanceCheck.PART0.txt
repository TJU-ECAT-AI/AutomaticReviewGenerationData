1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise attachment of metal precursors onto the surface of the support material. This leads to enhanced metal-support interactions due to the strong coordination of hydroxyl groups on the support with metal ions, resulting in improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
