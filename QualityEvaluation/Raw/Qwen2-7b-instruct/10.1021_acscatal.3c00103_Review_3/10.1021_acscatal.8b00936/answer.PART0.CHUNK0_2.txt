<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the precise integration of active metal components within crystalline materials, thereby strengthening their interaction with the support matrix. This results in enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability for heterogeneous catalysts involved in solid-gas reactions.
