Improved postsynthesis strategies have been devised for Sn-beta zeolites acting as Lewis acid catalysts in the ring-opening hydration of epoxides. The hydroxyl anchoring method enables precise integration of active metal components within crystalline materials. This technique boosts the interactions between metals and supports, consequently enhancing the activity, selectivity, and durability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
