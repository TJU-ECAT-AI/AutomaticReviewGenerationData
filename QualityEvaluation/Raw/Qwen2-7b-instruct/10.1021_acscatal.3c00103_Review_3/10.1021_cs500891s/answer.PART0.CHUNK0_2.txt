The hydroxyl anchoring method enhances the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials, thereby facilitating metal-support interactions. This improvement leads to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions, specifically for the ring-opening hydration of epoxides.
