[1] "An improved postsynthesis strategy to Sn-beta zeolites as Lewis acid catalysts for the ring-opening hydration of epoxides has been developed."
[2] "This method involves the hydroxyl anchoring technique, which facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials."
[3] "The hydroxyl anchoring method enhances metal-support interactions, thereby improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."
