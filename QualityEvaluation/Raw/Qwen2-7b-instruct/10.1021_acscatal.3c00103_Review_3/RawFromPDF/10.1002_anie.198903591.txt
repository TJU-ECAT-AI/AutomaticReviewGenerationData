† The generous financial support of the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada's Operating and Strategic Programmes, Union Carbide, Tarrytown, NY, USA, and Alcan, Canada, is greatefully appreciated, A. S. is deeply indebted to NSERC for a science graduate scholarship. Preprints of manuscripts from Professors Tom Mallouk and Thomas Bein assisted us greatly in the writing of this review paper. We also thank all our coworkers at the University of Toronto for many enlightening suggestions and discussions during the course of our research in advanced zeolite materials science.
