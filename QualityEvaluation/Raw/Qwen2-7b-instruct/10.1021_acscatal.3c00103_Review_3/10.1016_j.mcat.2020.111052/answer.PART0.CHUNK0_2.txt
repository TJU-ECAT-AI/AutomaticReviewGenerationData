[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method involves the introduction of hydroxyl groups onto the surface of the support material."
[2] "These hydroxyl groups serve as strong anchoring sites for metal ions, facilitating their incorporation into the crystal lattice."
[3] "By controlling the density and distribution of hydroxyl groups, one can precisely regulate the amount and location of metal compounds within the crystal structure."
[4] "This results in enhanced metal-support interactions, which are crucial for the performance of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."
[5] "The improved interactions lead to increased activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts, making them more efficient in converting reactants to products."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through the introduction of hydroxyl groups onto the support material's surface. These hydroxyl groups act as strong anchoring sites for metal ions, enabling precise regulation of metal compound amounts and locations within the crystal structure. This leads to enhanced metal-support interactions, boosting the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability in solid-gas reactions.
