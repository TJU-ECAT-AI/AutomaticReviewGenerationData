Hydroxyl anchoring is a technique that enables the controlled addition of active metal components into crystal structures. It promotes robust interactions between metals and support materials, thereby boosting the effectiveness of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By managing the distribution and amount of metal species, this method leads to enhanced activity, selectivity, and durability of these catalysts.
