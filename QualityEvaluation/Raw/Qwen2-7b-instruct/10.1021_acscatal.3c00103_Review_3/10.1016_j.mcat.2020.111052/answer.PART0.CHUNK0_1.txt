[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through the formation of strong metal-oxygen bonds."
[2] "This method enhances metal-support interactions by creating a stable interface between the metal and the support material."
[3] "The enhanced interaction leads to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for the precise integration of active metal compounds into crystal materials by forming robust metal-oxygen bonds. This technique strengthens the connection between the metal and the support material, resulting in more effective, selective, and durable heterogeneous catalysts for solid-gas reactions.
