The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by enabling precise integration through chemical reactions. This results in enhanced metal-support interactions due to strong coordination between hydroxyl groups and metal ions. By managing the amount and distribution of these active metals, the method significantly boosts the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
