<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the controlled addition of active metal components into the crystal lattice of supporting materials. This leads to potent metal-support bonds, which in turn enhances the catalytic performance of heterogeneous catalysts by boosting their activity, selectivity, and durability during solid-gas reactions.
