          The hydroxyl anchoring method enables precise control over the addition of active metal components into crystalline materials, utilizing the hydroxyl groups on the support material's surface as anchor points. This method strengthens the interaction between metals and supports, leading to enhanced catalytic performance in solid-gas reactions. By ensuring effective anchoring, it optimizes reactivity and durability, resulting in improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts.
