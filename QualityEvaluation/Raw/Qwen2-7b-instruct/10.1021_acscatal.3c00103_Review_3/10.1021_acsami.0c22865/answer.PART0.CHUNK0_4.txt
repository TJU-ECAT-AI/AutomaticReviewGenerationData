<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by creating specific binding sites on the surface of the material. This enhances metal-support interactions through strong electrostatic and hydrogen bonding, which leads to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
