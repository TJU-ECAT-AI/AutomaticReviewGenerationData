<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for the controlled integration of active metal compounds within crystal materials, thereby enhancing the interactions between metals and supports. This improvement leads to better activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
