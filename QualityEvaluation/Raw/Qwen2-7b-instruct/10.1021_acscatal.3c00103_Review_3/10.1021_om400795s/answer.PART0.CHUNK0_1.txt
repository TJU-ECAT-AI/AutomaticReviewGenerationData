[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through a strong interaction with the surface of the support material."
[2] "This interaction leads to enhanced metal-support interactions, thereby improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."

The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for the precise integration of active metal compounds within crystal materials by establishing a robust connection with the support material's surface. This strong interaction significantly enhances the metal-support bonds, which in turn boosts the catalyst's performance in solid-gas reactions, manifesting as improved activity, selectivity, and durability.
