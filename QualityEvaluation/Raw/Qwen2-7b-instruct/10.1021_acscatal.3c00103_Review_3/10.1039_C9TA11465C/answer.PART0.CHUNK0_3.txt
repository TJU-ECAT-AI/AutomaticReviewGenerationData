<p>The recent research results of our group showed that the formation of secondary porosity is directly related to the intrinsic structural properties of zeolites.812 Namely, the dissolution behavior of zeolites is preset by zeolite synthesis history.</p>
<p>Another proof of the removal of framework Al and the resultant formation of framework vacancies as a result of acid leaching comes from the 27Al and 29Si MAS NMR results (Fig. 3).</p>
<p>The crystalline characteristics and micropore volume of the zeolite are retained (Table 1 and Fig. 1).</p>
<p>There is little increase in the fraction of narrow mesopores (Fig. 2).</p>
<p>The treatment of MOR using NH4F does not change the zeolite acidity. Both MOR and MOR-AF show similar Brnsted and Lewis acidity (Table 2).</p>
<p>The leaching of MOR using oxalic acid decreases the total number of acid sites substantially, in agreement with the decrease of the aluminum content (Table 1).</p>
<p>After reaching a collidine pressure of 1 torr at RT, the sample was heated at 200 C in the collidine atmosphere until reaching a steady adsorption state.</p>
<p>Noticeably, even the acid sites inside the side pockets of MOR-A-AF are accessible to collidine.</p>
<p>The interface between intergrowths is a place for fast dissolution that leads to separated crystals or inter-particle mesopore formation, revealing the intrinsic hidden mosaic structures of zeolite crystals.</p>
<p>The set of experimental data reveals that the extrinsic defects, induced by chemical leaching in oxalic acid, generate a different type of mesoporosity and can be used to control zeolite accessibility and activity at the nanoscale.</p>

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by creating specific binding sites for the metals. This enhances metal-support interactions, which in turn improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The method allows for precise placement of metals within the crystal lattice, optimizing their proximity to the reaction sites and maximizing their catalytic efficiency.
2. The research indicates that the dissolution behavior of zeolites is influenced by their synthesis history, leading to the formation of secondary porosity based on their intrinsic structural properties. Oxalic acid leaching creates defects and vacancies in the zeolite framework, which can be utilized for the controlled introduction of mesopores. The treatment with ammonium fluoride (NH4F) etching enhances the dissolution process, particularly at defect sites, leading to the creation of additional mesopores. This method enables the enhancement of zeolite accessibility and activity at the nanoscale, resulting in superior catalytic performance for processing bulky molecules.

1. 氢氧基锚定方法通过创建特定的金属结合位点来促进晶材料中活性金属化合物的可控集成。这增强了金属支持相互作用，从而提高了固体气体反应中的催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。该方法允许精确放置金属在晶格中，优化它们与反应位点的距离，最大限度地提高其催化效率。
2. 研究表明，沸石的溶解行为受到其合成历史的影响，导致根据其内在结构属性形成二次孔隙。草酸处理在沸石框架中产生了缺陷和空位，这些可以用于控制引入介孔。氨水氟化（NH4F）蚀刻增强溶解过程，特别是针对缺陷点，导致额外介孔的形成。这种方法能够增强纳尺度下沸石的可接近性和活性，从而获得对大分子进行处理的卓越催化性能。
