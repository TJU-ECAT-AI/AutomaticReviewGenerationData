[1] "Our approach highlights the significance of chemically induced extrinsic defects, which make zeolite dissolution go beyond the limits set by the zeolite structure and synthesis chemistry."
[2] "The interface between intergrowths is a place for fast dissolution that leads to separated crystals or inter-particle mesopore formation, revealing the intrinsic hidden mosaic structures of zeolite crystals."
[3] "The set of experimental data reveals that the extrinsic defects, induced by chemical leaching in oxalic acid, generate a different type of mesoporosity and can be used to control zeolite accessibility and activity at the nanoscale."
[4] "More precisely, the contribution of the extrinsic defects is twofold. First, they improve the intra-particle diffusion and adsorption of chemicals substantially. Second, the defects themselves serve as the initial points for the preferential dissolution of a zeolite framework."
[5] "The resultant hierarchical zeolite shows superior mesoporosity in terms of mesopore distribution and available mesopore volume and thus substantially improved accessibility to the active sites located inside the micropores."

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by enabling precise placement of metals within the crystal lattice, thereby enhancing metal-support interactions. This results in improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

2. The dissolution behavior of zeolite crystals is influenced by the formation of extrinsic defects, which occur during the treatment with oxalic acid. These defects enable the controlled release of framework atoms, leading to the creation of inter- and intra-particle mesopores. This process reveals the inherent mosaic structure of zeolite crystals.

3. The hydroxyl anchoring method can be utilized to enhance the accessibility and activity of zeolite materials by generating extrinsic defects through chemical leaching processes. This approach leads to a tailored mesoporosity that can significantly improve the performance of zeolites in catalytic applications.

4. The presence of extrinsic defects in zeolite crystals has dual benefits: they improve the intra-particle diffusion and adsorption of chemicals, facilitating more efficient access to active sites. Additionally, these defects act as initial dissolution points, promoting a more efficient and uniform breakdown of the zeolite framework.

5. The hierarchical zeolite produced through the use of extrinsic defects demonstrates superior mesoporosity, characterized by enhanced mesopore distribution and volume. This characteristic leads to an increased accessibility of the active sites located within the micropores, resulting in outstanding catalytic performance for the processing of bulky molecules.
