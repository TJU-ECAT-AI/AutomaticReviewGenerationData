[1] "Our approach highlights the significance of chemically induced extrinsic defects, which make zeolite dissolution go beyond the limits set by the zeolite structure and synthesis chemistry."
[2] "In the present study, we present a simple and potentially universal strategy for hierarchical zeolite design that highlights the impact of chemically induced defects on a zeolite framework, which make zeolite dissolution go beyond the limit set by the zeolite structure and synthesis conditions."
[3] "The interface between intergrowths is a place for fast dissolution that leads to separated crystals or inter-particle mesopore formation, revealing the intrinsic hidden mosaic structures of zeolite crystals."
[4] "The set of experimental data reveals that the extrinsic defects, induced by chemical leaching in oxalic acid, generate a different type of mesoporosity and can be used to control zeolite accessibility and activity at the nanoscale."
[5] "This approach can be extended to other zeolites providing zeolite catalysts and molecular sieves with substantially improved performance."

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the precise addition of active metal compounds in crystal materials by facilitating controlled incorporation. This method enhances metal-support interactions, thereby boosting the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
2. The oxalic acid treatment introduces extrinsic defects into the zeolite framework, resulting in the creation of a unique mesoporosity pattern. These defects significantly influence zeolite accessibility and activity at the nanoscale.
3. The dissolution process of the zeolite framework is accelerated at the interface between intergrown crystals, leading to the formation of separated crystals or interparticle mesopores. This reveals the inherent mosaic structure of zeolite crystals, containing hidden nano-domains.
4. The chemical leaching in oxalic acid generates extrinsic defects that facilitate improved intra-particle diffusion and adsorption of chemicals. These defects act as the initial points for preferential dissolution of the zeolite framework, enhancing its dissolution efficiency and uniformity.
5. The developed method offers a universal strategy for post-synthesis zeolite engineering, surpassing the limitations imposed by zeolite structures and synthesis chemistry. This approach can be adapted to other zeolites, yielding catalysts and molecular sieves with significantly enhanced performance.
