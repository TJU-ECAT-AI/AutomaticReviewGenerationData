[1] "Our approach highlights the significance of chemically induced extrinsic defects, which make zeolite dissolution go beyond the limits set by the zeolite structure and synthesis chemistry."
[2] "The interface between intergrowths is a place for fast dissolution that leads to separated crystals or inter-particle mesopore formation, revealing the intrinsic hidden mosaic structures of zeolite crystals."
[3] "These intrinsic defects allow the engineering of zeolite crystals at the meso scale and fragmentation of zeolite aggregates of their component parts."
[4] "The set of experimental data reveals that the extrinsic defects, induced by chemical leaching in oxalic acid, generate a different type of mesoporosity and can be used to control zeolite accessibility and activity at the nanoscale."
[5] "Second, the defects themselves serve as the initial points for the preferential dissolution of a zeolite framework."
[6] "As a result, the dissolution of the defect-containing framework is more efficient and uniform."
[7] "Derived catalysts show outstanding catalytic performance in the catalytic conversion of bulky molecules, as exemplified in the dealkylation of 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene."

1. The chemical induction of extrinsic defects through oxalic acid treatment allows for enhanced zeolite dissolution beyond the limitations imposed by the zeolite's structure and synthesis chemistry, facilitating better control over the material's properties.

2. The dissolution process, influenced by these defects, leads to the creation of inter-particle mesopores, revealing the inherent mosaic architecture of zeolite crystals.

3. The existence of these intrinsic defects enables the manipulation of zeolite crystals at a mesoscopic scale, contributing to the breakdown of aggregate structures.

4. The chemical leaching of oxalic acid introduces extrinsic defects that result in a unique type of mesoporosity, enabling precise control over zeolite accessibility and activity at the nanoscale level.

5. These extrinsic defects act as initial points for the preferential dissolution of the zeolite framework, making the dissolution process more efficient and uniform.

6. The resulting hierarchical zeolite displays superior mesoporosity, significantly enhancing the accessibility to active sites within the micropores.

7. The utilization of these engineered zeolites in catalytic processes, such as the dealkylation of bulky molecules like 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene, demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance.
