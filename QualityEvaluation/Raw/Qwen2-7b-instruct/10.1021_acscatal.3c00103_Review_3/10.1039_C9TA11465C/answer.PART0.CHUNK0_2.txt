[1] "Our strategy includes the generation of point defects in zeolite crystals by preliminary etching with oxalic acid, followed by the development of these defects by NH4F etching."
[2] "Several experimental techniques were used to measure and visualize the zeolite framework dissolution as a function of intrinsic and induced defects."
[3] "It is revealed that the intrinsic defects lead to the extraction of misoriented nano domains, while those introduced by oxalic acid treatment lead further to the formation of small irregular mesopores."
[4] "The resultant hierarchical zeolite shows substantially improved mesoporosity, in terms of mesopore volume and spatial distribution, and outstanding micropore acid site accessibility."
[5] "These samples show superior catalytic performance in the dealkylation of a bulky molecule, 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene."
[6] "Our approach highlights the significance of chemically induced extrinsic defects, which make zeolite dissolution go beyond the limits set by the zeolite structure and synthesis chemistry."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by generating point defects through preliminary etching with oxalic acid. These defects are further developed by NH4F etching. The method allows for the creation of hierarchical zeolite structures that exhibit improved mesoporosity and enhanced accessibility to micropore acid sites. This leads to superior catalytic performance, especially in the dealkylation of bulky molecules like 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene. The approach emphasizes the importance of chemically induced extrinsic defects in controlling and improving zeolite dissolution, surpassing the limitations set by the zeolite structure and synthesis chemistry.

氢氧基锚定方法通过用草酸预蚀刻生成晶态材料中的点缺陷，随后通过NH4F蚀刻发展这些缺陷。这种方法允许在晶体材料中实现对活性金属化合物的可控掺杂。通过生成的缺陷，可以创建具有改善介孔结构和微孔酸性位点可及性的分级沸石结构。这导致了优越的催化性能，特别是在处理像1,3,5-三异丙基苯这样的大分子时。该方法强调了化学诱导外延缺陷在控制和改进沸石溶解过程中的重要性，超越了由沸石结构和合成化学设定的限制。
