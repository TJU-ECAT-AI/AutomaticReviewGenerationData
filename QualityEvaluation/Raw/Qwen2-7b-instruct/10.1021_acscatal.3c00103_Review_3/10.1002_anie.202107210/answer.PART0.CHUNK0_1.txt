[1] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
[2] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
[3] "The effects of these modifications were synergistic and remarkably improved the catalytic stability in PDH."
[4] "The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibited much superior stability to those of reported PDH catalysts (month-long stability, even at 600C) was achieved."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by depositing Pb on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles and placing Ca around the nanoparticles. This method leads to the creation of an electron-enriched Pt1 site, enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The synergy between Pb and Ca decorations resulted in a catalyst with exceptional stability, achieving month-long stability even at 600°C, surpassing the performance of previously reported PDH catalysts.

羟基锚定方法通过在Pt3位点上沉积Pb和将Ca放置在纳米颗粒周围，实现了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺杂。这种方法通过增强金属支持作用，提高了固体气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。Pb和Ca的双修饰策略产生了具有卓越稳定性的催化剂，即使在600°C下也能实现长达一个月的稳定性，超越了之前报道的PDH催化剂的性能。
