[1] "High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of PtGaCa and its particle size distribution are shown in FigureS1."
[2] "The synthesis of the doubly decorated intermetallic compound catalyst, in which the electron-enriched Pt1 active sites are present according to the rational catalyst design (Scheme1)."
[3] "The effects of these modifications were synergistic and remarkably improved the catalytic stability in PDH. The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibited much superior stability to those of reported PDH catalysts (month-long stability, even at 600C) was achieved."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by depositing metal ions onto the surface of the support material through a chemical reaction. This method enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By strategically placing metals on the support, the method ensures optimal catalytic performance under various reaction conditions.
