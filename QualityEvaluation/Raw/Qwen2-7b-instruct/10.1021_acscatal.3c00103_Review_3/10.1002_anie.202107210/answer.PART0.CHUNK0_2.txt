[1] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
[2] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
[3] "Thus, PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600C (kd=0.00033h−1, τ=3067h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1 month for the first time."
[4] "The effects of these modifications were synergistic and remarkably improved the catalytic stability in PDH."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by depositing lead (Pb) on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, and placing calcium (Ca) around the nanoparticles to impart them with an electron-enriched Pt1 site. This method improves metal-support interactions and enhances the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions through the synergistic effects of these modifications.

羟基锚定方法通过在Pt3位点上沉积铅（Pb）来阻塞纳米颗粒中的PtGa，同时在纳米颗粒周围放置钙（Ca）以赋予它们富电子的Pt1位点，从而在晶体材料中实现活性金属化合物的可控掺杂。这种方法通过这些修改的协同作用改善了金属-支撑相互作用，并提高了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
