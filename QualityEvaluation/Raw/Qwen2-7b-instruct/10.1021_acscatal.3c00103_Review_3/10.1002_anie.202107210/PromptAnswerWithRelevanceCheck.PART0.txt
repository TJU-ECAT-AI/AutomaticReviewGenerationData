[1] "Pb remains at the surface of PtGa and is not diffused into the PtGa bulk, even at a high temperature, because of its large atomic size and the high thermal stability of PtGa."
[2] "The electron donation from Ca to Pt upon Ca decoration."
[3] "Pb deposition, as well as the Ca decoration, enhanced the stability of the catalyst."
[4] "The combination of Pb and Ca exerted a synergistic effect on the stability of the catalyst."
[5] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited much superior stability to those of reported PDH catalysts (month-long stability, even at 600C) was achieved."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by depositing metals on the surface of the material rather than diffusing them into the bulk, which maintains the high thermal stability of the material. This method enhances metal-support interactions by creating a strong bond between the metal and the support, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The synergistic effect of lead (Pb) and calcium (Ca) deposition on the stability of the catalyst is a result of their complementary roles: Pb blocks the Pt3 sites, while Ca enriches the electron density at the Pt1 site, creating an optimal active site for propane dehydrogenation. The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst, with its unique design, achieved unprecedented stability, lasting for months even at a high temperature of 600°C, surpassing the performance of previously reported PDH catalysts.

羟基锚定方法通过在材料表面沉积金属而不是使其扩散到内部，从而实现活性金属化合物在晶态材料中的可控掺杂。这种方法通过在金属和支撑之间建立牢固的连接，增强了金属-支撑相互作用，进而提高了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。铅（Pb）和钙（Ca）沉积对催化剂稳定性的协同效应源于它们互补的作用：Pb阻止了Pt3位点，而Ca增加了Pt1位点的电子密度，形成了适合丙烷脱氢的理想活性位点。PtGaCaPb/SiO2催化剂的独特设计实现了前所未有的稳定性，在600°C的高温下持续数月，远超过以往报道的PDH催化剂性能，展示了在不同条件下丙烷脱氢过程中催化剂稳定性的新水平。

[1] "The novel catalyst design concept, the double decoration of intermetallics where PtGa was modified with Pb and Ca, enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1 month at 600°C."
[2] "Pb remains at the surface of PtGa and is not diffused into the PtGa bulk, even at a high temperature, because of its large atomic size and the high thermal stability of PtGa."
[3] "Therefore, the double modification of PtGa to synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects can be a promising catalyst design concept to construct an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH."
[4] "The combination of Pb and Ca exerted a synergistic effect on the stability of the catalyst. The mean catalyst lifetime (reciprocal deactivation constant: kd = τ = 233 h) of PtGaCaPb was much longer than that of PtGaPb (τ = 149 h), thus highlighting the further enhancement of the catalytic stability via the double decoration by CaPb, which afforded the electron-enriched Pt1."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by depositing metals on the surface of the material, specifically on the three-fold Pt (and Ga) sites of the PtGa nanoparticles. This method enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The synergy between the geometric modification by Pb and the electronic modification by Ca leads to an outstandingly high catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 600°C, achieving a mean catalyst lifetime of 233 hours for the PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst. This is significantly longer than that of the PtGaPb catalyst (149 hours), highlighting the further enhancement of the catalytic stability through the dual decoration of Pb and Ca. The combination of Pb and Ca on the PtGa catalyst not only blocks the Pt3 sites but also exposes electron-enriched Pt1 sites, which are highly selective for PDH.

羟基锚定方法通过在材料表面沉积金属，特别是在Pt（和Ga）三元组位点上，实现了活性金属化合物在晶态材料中的可控掺入。这种方法增强了金属-支撑相互作用，从而提高了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。通过Pb在几何上的修改和Ca在电子上的修改之间的协同效应，首次实现了PDH在600°C下长达1个月的超稳定催化性能，PtGaCaPb/SiO2催化剂的平均催化剂寿命达到了233小时。这远超过PtGaPb催化剂（149小时）的寿命，强调了Pb和Ca双重修饰对催化剂稳定性的进一步增强。Pb和Ca的组合不仅阻止了Pt3位点，还暴露了富含电子的Pt1位点，这些位点对于PDH具有高度选择性。
