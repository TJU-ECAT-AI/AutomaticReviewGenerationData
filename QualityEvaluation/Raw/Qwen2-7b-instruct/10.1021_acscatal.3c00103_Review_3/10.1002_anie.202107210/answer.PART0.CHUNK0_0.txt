[1] "Pb remains at the surface of PtGa and is not diffused into the PtGa bulk, even at a high temperature, because of its large atomic size and the high thermal stability of PtGa."
[2] "The electron donation from Ca to Pt upon Ca decoration."
[3] "Pb deposition, as well as the Ca decoration, enhanced the stability of the catalyst."
[4] "The combination of Pb and Ca exerted a synergistic effect on the stability of the catalyst."
[5] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited much superior stability to those of reported PDH catalysts (month-long stability, even at 600C) was achieved."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by depositing metals on the surface of the material rather than diffusing them into the bulk, which maintains the high thermal stability of the material. This method enhances metal-support interactions by creating a strong bond between the metal and the support, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The synergistic effect of lead (Pb) and calcium (Ca) deposition on the stability of the catalyst is a result of their complementary roles: Pb blocks the Pt3 sites, while Ca enriches the electron density at the Pt1 site, creating an optimal active site for propane dehydrogenation. The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst, with its unique design, achieved unprecedented stability, lasting for months even at a high temperature of 600°C, surpassing the performance of previously reported PDH catalysts.

羟基锚定方法通过在材料表面沉积金属而不是使其扩散到内部，从而实现活性金属化合物在晶态材料中的可控掺杂。这种方法通过在金属和支撑之间建立牢固的连接，增强了金属-支撑相互作用，进而提高了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。铅（Pb）和钙（Ca）沉积对催化剂稳定性的协同效应源于它们互补的作用：Pb阻止了Pt3位点，而Ca增加了Pt1位点的电子密度，形成了适合丙烷脱氢的理想活性位点。PtGaCaPb/SiO2催化剂的独特设计实现了前所未有的稳定性，在600°C的高温下持续数月，远超过以往报道的PDH催化剂性能，展示了在不同条件下丙烷脱氢过程中催化剂稳定性的新水平。
