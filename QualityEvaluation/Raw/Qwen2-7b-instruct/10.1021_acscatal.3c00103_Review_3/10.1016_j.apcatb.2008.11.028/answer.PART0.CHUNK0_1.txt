[1] "The Co0.8SiBEA and Co11SiBEA zeolites with 0.8 and 11 Co wt% are prepared by a two-step postsynthesis method. It allows to incorporate cobalt in BEA zeolite mainly as isolated lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species for Co0.8SiBEA and as extra-lattice octahedral Co(II) species for Co11SiBEA."
[2] "The state of cobalt species is characterised by DR UVvis and XAS. The combined use of these techniques allows to show that for low Co content (0.8 wt%) the cobalt is present as the distorted tetrahedral Co(II) species."
[3] "Zeolite with lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species is active in SCR of NO by ethanol with selectivity towards N2 exceeding 85% for NO conversion from 30 to 70%."
[4] "When additional extra-lattice octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides appear, the full oxidation of ethanol and NO by dioxygen to CO2 and NO2 respectively, are the main reaction pathways."

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise placement of metals in specific lattice sites. This method enhances metal-support interactions, improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions through optimized metal distribution and coordination.

2. For Co0.8SiBEA, the incorporation of cobalt is primarily as isolated lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species, which are responsible for the enhanced activity in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ethanol. These species enable a high selectivity towards N2 production.

3. The use of DR UVvis and XAS techniques demonstrates that for low cobalt content (0.8 wt%), the cobalt is present as distorted tetrahedral Co(II) species. These species are crucial for the observed high activity in SCR of NO.

4. In contrast, the presence of additional extra-lattice octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides in Co11SiBEA leads to full oxidation reactions, such as the complete oxidation of ethanol and NO by dioxygen to CO2 and NO2, rather than selective reduction of NO to N2.

1. 氢氧锚定方法通过允许精确放置金属在特定晶格点，从而促进活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控集成。这种方法通过优化金属分布和配位，增强异质催化剂在固相气体反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。

2. 对于Co0.8SiBEA，钴的集成主要作为隔离晶格四面体Co(II)物种，这些物种对由乙醇选择性催化还原NO具有增强作用。这些物种使N2生成具有高选择性。

3. DR UVvis和XAS技术表明，对于低钴含量（0.8 wt%），钴主要以扭曲的四面体Co(II)物种存在。这些物种是观察到的高活性在选择性催化还原NO的关键。

4. 相比之下，在Co11SiBEA中，额外的额外晶格八面体Co(II)物种和/或钴氧化物的存在导致完全氧化反应，例如乙醇和NO由氧气完全氧化为CO2和NO2，而不是选择性还原NO。
