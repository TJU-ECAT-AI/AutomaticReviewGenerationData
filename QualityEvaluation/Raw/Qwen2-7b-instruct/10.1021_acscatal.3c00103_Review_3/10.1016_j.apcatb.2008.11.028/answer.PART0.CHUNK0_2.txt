[1] "The Co0.8SiBEA and Co11SiBEA zeolites with 0.8 and 11 Co wt% are prepared by a two-step postsynthesis method."
[2] "The incorporation of Co ions in vacant T-sites and their reaction with silanol groups are evidenced by XRD and FTIR respectively."
[3] "It does not generate acidic Brnsted sites as shown by FTIR of adsorbed pyridine."
[4] "The state of cobalt species is characterized by DR UVvis and XAS."
[5] "Zeolite with lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species is active in SCR of NO with selectivity towards N2 exceeding 85%."
[6] "When extra-lattice octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides appear, the full oxidation of ethanol and NO by dioxygen to CO2 and NO2 respectively, are the main reaction pathways."

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing the precise placement of metals in specific lattice positions through a two-step postsynthesis process. This method enhances metal-support interactions, thereby improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
