The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing the precise placement of metals in specific lattice sites, such as T-sites in zeolites. This method ensures strong interactions between the metal and the support, which enhances the overall activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. For instance, the CoSiBEA zeolites prepared through this method exhibit high activity and selectivity in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO due to the presence of isolated lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species. The controlled incorporation of these metal species enables efficient catalytic reactions, such as the reduction of NO into N2, with high selectivity across a wide temperature range.

羟基锚定方法通过允许在特定晶格位点，如沸石中的T位点，精确放置活性金属化合物来促进晶态材料中活性金属化合物的可控掺杂。这种方法确保了金属与支撑之间的强烈相互作用，从而增强了异质催化剂在固-气反应中的整体活性、选择性和稳定性。例如，通过这种方法制备的CoSiBEA沸石显示出在宽温度范围内对NO进行选择性催化还原（SCR）的高活性和选择性，由于其中存在孤立的晶格四面体Co(II)物种。对这些金属物种的精确掺入使得可以有效地进行催化反应，例如将NO还原为N2，具有高的选择性。
