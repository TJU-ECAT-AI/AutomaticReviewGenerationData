[1] "The Co0.8SiBEA and Co11SiBEA zeolites with 0.8 and 11 Co wt% are prepared by a two-step postsynthesis method. It allows to incorporate cobalt in BEA zeolite mainly as isolated lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species for Co0.8SiBEA and as extra-lattice octahedral Co(II) species for Co11SiBEA."
[2] "The state of cobalt species is characterised by DR UVvis and XAS. The combined use of these techniques allows to show that for low Co content (0.8 wt%) the cobalt is present as the distorted tetrahedral Co(II) species."
[3] "Zeolite with lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species is active in SCR of NO by ethanol with selectivity towards N2 exceeding 85% for NO conversion from 30 to 70%."
[4] "When additional extra-lattice octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides appear, the full oxidation of ethanol and NO by dioxygen to CO2 and NO2 respectively, are the main reaction pathways."

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing the precise placement of metals within the crystal lattice. This method enhances metal-support interactions, thereby improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

2. The implications of using this method are significant improvements in the performance of catalysts. By controlling the type and distribution of metal species within the crystal structure, researchers can optimize catalytic activity, ensuring that the desired chemical reactions occur efficiently and selectively.

3. The use of CoSiBEA zeolites prepared through the hydroxyl anchoring method demonstrates that catalysts with lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species exhibit superior selectivity in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ethanol. The selectivity towards N2 exceeds 85% across the NO conversion range from 30 to 70%.

4. In contrast, catalysts with extra-lattice octahedral Co(II) species or cobalt oxides display reduced selectivity towards N2 and enhanced reactivity in the full oxidation of ethanol and NO by dioxygen to CO2 and NO2, respectively.

1. 羟基锚定方法通过允许精确放置金属化合物在晶体材料中，促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控集成。这种方法增强了金属支持相互作用，从而提高了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。

2. 使用此方法的含义在于显著改善催化剂的性能。通过控制晶体内金属物种的类型和分布，研究人员可以优化催化活性，确保所需化学反应高效且选择性地发生。

3. 通过使用通过羟基锚定方法制备的CoSiBEA沸石，显示了含有晶格四面体Co(II)物种的催化剂在由乙醇选择性催化还原NO中表现出优越的选择性。氮气的选择性超过85%，在NO转化范围从30到70%。

4. 相反，含有额外晶格外八面体Co(II)物种或钴氧化物的催化剂显示出降低的氮气选择性和增强的乙醇和NO由氧气完全氧化至二氧化碳和NO2的主要反应途径。
