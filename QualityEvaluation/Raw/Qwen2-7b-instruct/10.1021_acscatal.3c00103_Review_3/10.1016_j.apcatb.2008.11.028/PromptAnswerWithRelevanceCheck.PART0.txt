1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise placement of metals within the crystal lattice, specifically in T-sites, through reactions with silanol groups. This method enhances metal-support interactions, improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

2. The implications of this method are significant for enhancing the efficiency of catalysts by ensuring that the active metal species are optimally positioned within the crystal structure. This positioning is crucial for maximizing catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability, thereby enabling better performance in industrial processes involving solid-gas reactions.

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise placement of metals in specific lattice sites. This method enhances metal-support interactions, improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions through optimized metal distribution and coordination.

2. For Co0.8SiBEA, the incorporation of cobalt is primarily as isolated lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species, which are responsible for the enhanced activity in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ethanol. These species enable a high selectivity towards N2 production.

3. The use of DR UVvis and XAS techniques demonstrates that for low cobalt content (0.8 wt%), the cobalt is present as distorted tetrahedral Co(II) species. These species are crucial for the observed high activity in SCR of NO.

4. In contrast, the presence of additional extra-lattice octahedral Co(II) species and/or cobalt oxides in Co11SiBEA leads to full oxidation reactions, such as the complete oxidation of ethanol and NO by dioxygen to CO2 and NO2, rather than selective reduction of NO to N2.

1. 氢氧锚定方法通过允许精确放置金属在特定晶格点，从而促进活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控集成。这种方法通过优化金属分布和配位，增强异质催化剂在固相气体反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。

2. 对于Co0.8SiBEA，钴的集成主要作为隔离晶格四面体Co(II)物种，这些物种对由乙醇选择性催化还原NO具有增强作用。这些物种使N2生成具有高选择性。

3. DR UVvis和XAS技术表明，对于低钴含量（0.8 wt%），钴主要以扭曲的四面体Co(II)物种存在。这些物种是观察到的高活性在选择性催化还原NO的关键。

4. 相比之下，在Co11SiBEA中，额外的额外晶格八面体Co(II)物种和/或钴氧化物的存在导致完全氧化反应，例如乙醇和NO由氧气完全氧化为CO2和NO2，而不是选择性还原NO。

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing the precise placement of metals in specific lattice sites, such as T-sites in zeolites. This method ensures strong interactions between the metal and the support, which enhances the overall activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. For instance, the CoSiBEA zeolites prepared through this method exhibit high activity and selectivity in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO due to the presence of isolated lattice tetrahedral Co(II) species. The controlled incorporation of these metal species enables efficient catalytic reactions, such as the reduction of NO into N2, with high selectivity across a wide temperature range.

羟基锚定方法通过允许在特定晶格位点，如沸石中的T位点，精确放置活性金属化合物来促进晶态材料中活性金属化合物的可控掺杂。这种方法确保了金属与支撑之间的强烈相互作用，从而增强了异质催化剂在固-气反应中的整体活性、选择性和稳定性。例如，通过这种方法制备的CoSiBEA沸石显示出在宽温度范围内对NO进行选择性催化还原（SCR）的高活性和选择性，由于其中存在孤立的晶格四面体Co(II)物种。对这些金属物种的精确掺入使得可以有效地进行催化反应，例如将NO还原为N2，具有高的选择性。
