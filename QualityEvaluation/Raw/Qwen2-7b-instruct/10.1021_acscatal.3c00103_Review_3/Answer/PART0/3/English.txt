The hydroxyl anchoring method improves the controlled addition of active metal compounds to crystalline materials through the use of the polar properties of hydroxyl groups, which strengthens the interaction between metals and supports. This improvement leads to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
