          The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for the precise incorporation of active metal compounds within crystal structures, providing a stable interface for metal-support interactions. This method significantly improves the stability of catalysts, as it ensures that the active metal is securely anchored within the crystal lattice, preventing leaching or migration during reaction conditions. By facilitating controlled incorporation, the hydroxyl anchoring method enables the enhancement of metal-support interactions, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity. The implications of this method are profound, as it not only increases the stability of the catalyst but also optimizes the distribution of active sites, thereby boosting the overall efficiency of solid-gas reactions.
