Active metal compounds are precisely positioned within crystal materials by taking advantage of the polar characteristics of hydroxyl groups, which strengthens the interactions between metals and supports. This enhancement leads to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
