          [1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by using hydroxyl groups to anchor the metal compounds onto the surface of the crystal. This method enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."
          [2] "The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the systematic addition of active metal components to crystal structures by leveraging hydroxyl groups to attach these metals to the crystal surface. This technique strengthens the interaction between metals and supports, thereby enhancing the performance of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions by boosting their activity, selectivity, and durability."
          [3] "This method enhances metal-support interactions, which can lead to improvements in the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."
          [4] "The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for the controlled addition of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the hydroxyl groups as attachment points. This technique strengthens the interaction between the metal and the support, potentially boosting the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability in solid-gas reactions."
          [5] "The main techniques used to characterize defects in zeolites are X-ray diffraction, UV-Vis, FTIR, and NMR, and DFT."

          The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the precise integration of active metal components into crystal matrices by establishing robust metal-oxygen bonds, thereby strengthening the interaction between the metal and the support. This enhancement in interaction boosts the activity, selectivity, and durability of heterogeneous catalysts involved in solid-gas reactions.
