The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for the precise addition of active metal components into crystal structures by exploiting the strong bond between hydroxyl groups on the crystal's surface and the metal centers. This technique strengthens the interaction between metals and supports, thereby boosting the efficiency, specificity, and durability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

A series of molecular gallium(iii) model compounds with varying ligands were synthesized and their XANES spectra analyzed to understand the species responsible for the observed XANES spectra. These findings pertain to gallium-modified zeolite catalysts and silica-supported single-site gallium catalysts, demonstrating activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation. The significance of ligand effects on XANES edge energy was demonstrated by contrasting the properties of gallium(iii) compounds (4) and Ga(acac)3, which exhibit a substantial difference in edge energy despite both being in the +3 oxidation state. Comparative analysis of the XANES spectra of GaSiO2 and GaH-BEA catalysts treated with hydrogen at high temperature against molecular reference compounds suggests that these catalysts might consist of three-coordinate Ga3+ dihydride species rather than Ga+.

Heterogeneous Lewis acid materials, including Ti-, Sn-, and Zr-Beta zeolites, are extensively utilized in sustainable chemistry and green chemical transformations. The developed methodology can be expanded for synthesizing other mesoporous zeolites containing transition metals. Zr species within the Beta framework are identified as optimal active components with moderate Lewis acidity for the aminolysis of epoxides, surpassing Sn and Zr-silicate analogues. The introduction of mesopores through alkaline treatment facilitates better accessibility of reactant molecules to active sites and easier diffusion of products, thereby enhancing catalytic activity. Meso-Zr-Beta, prepared using post-synthesis procedures, exhibits robust catalytic performance in the ring-opening aminolysis of epoxides with good recyclability.
