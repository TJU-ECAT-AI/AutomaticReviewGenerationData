A series of molecular model compounds were synthesized, and surface organometallic gallium species were grafted. Their XANES spectra were compared to those of gallium-based catalysts under reducing conditions. A conventional gallium-based alkane aromatization catalyst was prepared by impregnating an acidic zeolite with an aqueous solution of gallium nitrate and then calcined in air. The catalytic activity of GaSiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation was shown at 500°C, with nearly constant propylene production rates within the first 30 minutes and maintained for at least 6 hours. It was also demonstrated that reductions in edge energy under reducing conditions arise from the sequential formation of at least two distinct species.
