They effectively utilize interdisciplinary knowledge and adhere to academic standards. However, neither stands out distinctly in terms of innovation, contribution, methodology assessment, or writing quality. Both offer insightful analyses and feasible suggestions, but lack a clear demonstration of superiority in any single aspect. Consequently, they receive identical scores and cannot be conclusively rated as superior over the other."
