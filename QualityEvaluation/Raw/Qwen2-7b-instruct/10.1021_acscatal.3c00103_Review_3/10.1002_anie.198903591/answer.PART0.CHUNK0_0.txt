The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the systematic integration of active metal compounds into crystal materials by precisely positioning them within the crystal lattice structure. This enhancement of metal-support interactions leads to increased activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
