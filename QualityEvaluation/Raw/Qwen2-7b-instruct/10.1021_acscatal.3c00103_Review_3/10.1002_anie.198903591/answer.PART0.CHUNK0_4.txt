<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by creating specific binding sites for metals. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By precisely positioning the metal compounds within the zeolite framework, the method ensures optimal conditions for catalytic processes.
