3.2.1. Hydroxyl Anchoring Method
"Controllable incorporation of active compounds on the support can be accomplished by using a hydroxyl anchoring approach (grafting or confining active sites on isolated hydroxyls and/or hydroxyl nests)."

3.2.1. Hydroxyl Anchoring Method
"A precise molecular approach, surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), can make use of the organic groups (usually hydroxyl groups) on the support and graft metal active sites on the support by the formation of strong covalent MO bonds."

3.2.1. Hydroxyl Anchoring Method
"Through the selective reaction of hydroxyl groups on tailored supports with specific thermolytic molecular precursors (TMPs), such as metal hydrocarbyls, siloxides, and alkoxides, under high temperatures, highly dispersed metal oxide species can be generated."

3.2.1. Hydroxyl Anchoring Method
"Surface CrOx species usually exist in the form of different valence states (+6, +5, +4, +3, +2), among which low-valent CrOx species are identified as active and selective sites for propane dehydrogenation."

3.2.2. Encapsulation
"Physically encapsulating metal or metal oxide assemblies is one of the hottest themes in the construction of stable PDH catalysts, showing advantages in size control, site adjustment, and spatial segmentation."

3.2.2. Encapsulation
"Although the direct encapsulation route may exist in many catalytic systems, encapsulation with zeolites is more representative because of their highly ordered porous structure, high surface area, and unique chemical internal ambiance."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing hydroxyl groups on the support. This method employs a precise molecular approach, surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), to graft metal active sites onto the support through the formation of strong covalent bonds. By selectively reacting hydroxyl groups on tailored supports with thermolytic molecular precursors under high temperatures, highly dispersed metal oxide species are generated. These species, particularly those with low valence states, serve as active and selective sites for propane dehydrogenation, enhancing the metal-support interactions. Encapsulation techniques, specifically using zeolites, offer advantages in size control, site adjustment, and spatial segmentation, contributing to the stability, activity, and selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
