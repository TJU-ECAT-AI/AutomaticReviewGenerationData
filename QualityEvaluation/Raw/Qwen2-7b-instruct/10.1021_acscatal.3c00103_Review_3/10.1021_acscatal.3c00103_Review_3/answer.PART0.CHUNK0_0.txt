3.2.1. Hydroxyl Anchoring Method
"Controllable incorporation of active compounds on the support can be accomplished by using a hydroxyl anchoring approach (grafting or confining active sites on isolated hydroxyls and/or hydroxyl nests)."
"A precise molecular approach, surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), can make use of the organic groups (usually hydroxyl groups) on the support and graft metal active sites on the support by the formation of strong covalent MO bonds."
"Through the selective reaction of hydroxyl groups on tailored supports with specific thermolytic molecular precursors (TMPs), such as metal hydrocarbyls, siloxides, and alkoxides, under high temperatures, highly dispersed metal oxide species can be generated."
"The SOMC approach can also achieve the precise adjustment of metal-supported catalysts at an atomic level."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by using hydroxyl groups as anchors. This is achieved through a precise molecular approach called surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), which uses the hydroxyl groups on the support to graft metal active sites. By selectively reacting hydroxyl groups with thermolytic molecular precursors, highly dispersed metal oxide species can be generated. This method enables the precise adjustment of metal-supported catalysts at the atomic level, enhancing metal-support interactions. As a result, it improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

羟基锚定方法通过使用羟基作为锚点，在晶体材料中实现活性金属化合物的可控掺入。这主要通过精确分子方法表面有机金属化学（SOMC）来实现，利用支持上的羟基来接枝金属活性位点。通过选择性地与热解分子前体反应，可以生成高度分散的金属氧化物种。这种方法能够实现金属支持催化剂在原子水平上的精确调整，增强金属-支撑相互作用。因此，它提高了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
