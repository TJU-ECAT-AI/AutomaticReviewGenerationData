The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing hydroxyl groups on the support surface. This is achieved through grafting or confining active sites onto isolated hydroxyls or hydroxyl nests. The method employs selective reactions with thermolytic molecular precursors (TMPs) that contain metal hydrocarbyls, siloxides, and alkoxides. These reactions take place under high temperatures, leading to the formation of highly dispersed metal oxide species. A precise molecular approach called surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) utilizes the hydroxyl groups on the support to graft metal active sites through strong covalent bonding. Zeolites serve as ideal supports for the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction due to their advantageous properties, such as large surface area, ordered channels, and adjustable framework. Processes involving grafting thermolytic molecular precursors onto tailored supports followed by reduction treatments under high temperatures enable the preparation of supported metal catalysts with narrowly distributed metallic nanoparticles. These steps collectively enhance metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability in heterogeneous catalysts for solid-gas reactions.

羟基锚定方法通过利用支撑材料表面的羟基，实现了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这通过在孤立的羟基或羟基巢上进行接枝或限制活性位点来实现。这种方法使用了与热解分子前体（TMP）的选择性反应，这些前体包含金属烃、硅氧烷和醇类。这些反应在高温下进行，导致高度分散的金属氧化物种的生成。精确的分子方法，表面有机金属化学（SOMC），利用支持材料上的羟基通过强共价键将金属活性位点接枝到支持材料上。沸石是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的理想支持材料，因为它们具有许多有利的特性，如大的表面积、有序的通道和可调的框架。通过将热解分子前体接枝到定制的支持材料上，然后在高温下进行还原处理的过程，可以制备具有窄分布的金属纳米颗粒的负载金属催化剂。这些步骤共同增强了金属-支撑相互作用，从而提高了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
