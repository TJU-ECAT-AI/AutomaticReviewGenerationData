3.2. Hydroxyl Anchoring Method
Crystal materials with abundant hydroxyl groups can provide a subtle ambiance to graft metal sites or anchor metal compounds, providing a feasible pathway to fabricate well-tuned materials with various catalytic properties. (117)
A precise molecular approach, surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), can make use of the organic groups (usually hydroxyl groups) on the support and graft metal active sites on the support by the formation of strong covalent MO bonds. (118)
Significantly, zeolites are ideal supports for the PDH reaction with plenty of marvelous traits, including but not limited to their large surface area, ordered channels, and adjustable framework. The formation of hydroxyls on zeolites can result from various synthetic methodologies, including controlling the nature and purity of the used reagents and postsynthesis treatments. (126,127)
Post-treatment of peculiar zeolites, dealumination for instance, can help with the generation of hydroxyl nests with infrangibleness typical of the zeolite framework but only a little reduction of the crystal crystallinity due to the formation of vacant T sites in particular orientations. (131)

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by leveraging the presence of hydroxyl groups on the support. This enables the fabrication of well-tuned materials with various catalytic properties through the precise molecular approach of surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC). Zeolites serve as ideal supports for the PDH reaction due to their large surface area, ordered channels, and adjustable framework. The generation of hydroxyl nests through post-treatment techniques, such as dealumination, enhances the anchoring effect, contributing to the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

羟基锚定方法通过利用支撑材料上的大量羟基，为在晶体材料中精确引入活性金属化合物提供了一种可行途径。这使得通过表面有机金属化学（SOMC）精确分子方法制造具有各种催化性能的精细调谐材料成为可能。沸石是PDH反应的理想支持体，因为它们具有大的表面积、有序的通道和可调整的框架结构。通过后处理技术，如去铝化，可以生成具有类似沸石框架特性的羟基巢穴，同时仅减少晶体结晶性的一小部分，从而增强锚定效果，对固体-气体反应中的异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性做出贡献。
