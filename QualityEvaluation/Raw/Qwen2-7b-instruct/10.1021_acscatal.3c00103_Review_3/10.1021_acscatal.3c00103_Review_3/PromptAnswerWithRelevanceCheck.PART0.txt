3.2.1. Hydroxyl Anchoring Method
"Controllable incorporation of active compounds on the support can be accomplished by using a hydroxyl anchoring approach (grafting or confining active sites on isolated hydroxyls and/or hydroxyl nests)."
"A precise molecular approach, surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), can make use of the organic groups (usually hydroxyl groups) on the support and graft metal active sites on the support by the formation of strong covalent MO bonds."
"Through the selective reaction of hydroxyl groups on tailored supports with specific thermolytic molecular precursors (TMPs), such as metal hydrocarbyls, siloxides, and alkoxides, under high temperatures, highly dispersed metal oxide species can be generated."
"The SOMC approach can also achieve the precise adjustment of metal-supported catalysts at an atomic level."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by using hydroxyl groups as anchors. This is achieved through a precise molecular approach called surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), which uses the hydroxyl groups on the support to graft metal active sites. By selectively reacting hydroxyl groups with thermolytic molecular precursors, highly dispersed metal oxide species can be generated. This method enables the precise adjustment of metal-supported catalysts at the atomic level, enhancing metal-support interactions. As a result, it improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing hydroxyl groups on the support. This method employs a precise molecular approach, surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), to graft metal active sites onto the support through the formation of strong covalent bonds. By selectively reacting hydroxyl groups on tailored supports with thermolytic molecular precursors under high temperatures, highly dispersed metal oxide species are generated. These species, particularly those with low valence states, serve as active and selective sites for propane dehydrogenation, enhancing the metal-support interactions. Encapsulation techniques, specifically using zeolites, offer advantages in size control, site adjustment, and spatial segmentation, contributing to the stability, activity, and selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the organic groups, particularly hydroxyl groups, on the support surfaces. This method enables the anchoring of active sites either through grafting onto isolated hydroxyls or hydroxyl nests, or through confining within hydroxyl nests. The surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) approach plays a crucial role in this process, allowing the formation of strong covalent bonds between metal active sites and the support's hydroxyl groups. This leads to the realization of strong metal-support interactions, which are essential for enhancing the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The hydroxyl anchoring method is particularly advantageous in the synthesis of zeolite-based catalysts, as the presence of hydroxyl groups on the zeolite framework promotes the anchoring of active compounds and inhibits catalytic deactivation. Moreover, the hydroxyl anchoring method can achieve precise adjustment of metal-supported catalysts at the atomic level, contributing to the development of highly active and stable catalysts for various applications, including propane dehydrogenation.

3.2. Hydroxyl Anchoring Method
Crystal materials with abundant hydroxyl groups can provide a subtle ambiance to graft metal sites or anchor metal compounds, providing a feasible pathway to fabricate well-tuned materials with various catalytic properties. (117)
A precise molecular approach, surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), can make use of the organic groups (usually hydroxyl groups) on the support and graft metal active sites on the support by the formation of strong covalent MO bonds. (118)
Significantly, zeolites are ideal supports for the PDH reaction with plenty of marvelous traits, including but not limited to their large surface area, ordered channels, and adjustable framework. The formation of hydroxyls on zeolites can result from various synthetic methodologies, including controlling the nature and purity of the used reagents and postsynthesis treatments. (126,127)
Post-treatment of peculiar zeolites, dealumination for instance, can help with the generation of hydroxyl nests with infrangibleness typical of the zeolite framework but only a little reduction of the crystal crystallinity due to the formation of vacant T sites in particular orientations. (131)
