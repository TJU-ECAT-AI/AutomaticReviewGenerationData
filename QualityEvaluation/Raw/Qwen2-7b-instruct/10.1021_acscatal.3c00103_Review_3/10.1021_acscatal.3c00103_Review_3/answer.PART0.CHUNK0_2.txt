[1] "Controllable incorporation of active compounds on the support can be accomplished by using a hydroxyl anchoring approach (grafting or confining active sites on isolated hydroxyls and/or hydroxyl nests)."
[2] "The SOMC approach can make use of the organic groups (usually hydroxyl groups) on the support and graft metal active sites on the support by the formation of strong covalent MO bonds."
[3] "Strong metalsupport interactions can be realized in both chemical and physical ways (Table 2). For the former, stable chemical bonds are usually established, while the latter adopts physical encapsulation to fix the active compounds."
[4] "The FeS-1 catalyst exhibiting superior durability in olefin dehydrogenation was synthesized by incorporating Fe atoms into the MFI zeolite framework during the zeolite synthesis process."
[5] "In parallel to V, a Co/SiBeta catalyst with highly dispersed Co species was prepared via the wet impregnation method."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the organic groups, particularly hydroxyl groups, on the support surfaces. This method enables the anchoring of active sites either through grafting onto isolated hydroxyls or hydroxyl nests, or through confining within hydroxyl nests. The surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) approach plays a crucial role in this process, allowing the formation of strong covalent bonds between metal active sites and the support's hydroxyl groups. This leads to the realization of strong metal-support interactions, which are essential for enhancing the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The hydroxyl anchoring method is particularly advantageous in the synthesis of zeolite-based catalysts, as the presence of hydroxyl groups on the zeolite framework promotes the anchoring of active compounds and inhibits catalytic deactivation. Moreover, the hydroxyl anchoring method can achieve precise adjustment of metal-supported catalysts at the atomic level, contributing to the development of highly active and stable catalysts for various applications, including propane dehydrogenation.

水合物锚定方法通过利用支撑材料表面的有机团，特别是羟基团，实现了活性金属化合物在晶态材料中的可控整合。这种方法可以通过将活性位点锚定在孤立的羟基或羟基巢上，或者将它们限制在羟基巢内，实现这一目的。表面有机金属化学（SOMC）方法在这一过程中扮演着关键角色，它允许金属活性位点与支撑材料的羟基团形成牢固的共价键。这导致了强金属-支撑相互作用的实现，这对增强固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性至关重要。水合物锚定方法特别适用于基于沸石的催化剂的合成，因为沸石框架上的羟基群促进了活性化合物的锚定并抑制了催化失活。此外，水合物锚定方法能够实现金属支持催化剂在原子层面上的精确调整，为各种应用，包括丙烷脱氢，发展出高度活性和稳定的催化剂做出了贡献。
