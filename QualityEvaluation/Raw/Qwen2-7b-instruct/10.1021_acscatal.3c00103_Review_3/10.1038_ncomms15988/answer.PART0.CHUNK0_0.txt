[1] "Our developed theory introduces thermodynamic descriptors that are dependent on the detailed structural characteristics of the NCs."
[2] "In Fig. 2, we plot the calculated shell-to-core binding energy (BE) versus the cohesive energy (CE) of the metal cores."
[3] "This trend highlights a unique physicochemical feature of the experimentally synthesized Aun(SR)m NCs: in order for a thiolate-protected Au NC to be thermodynamically stable, there is a fine balance between the CE of the core and the BE of the shell to the core."
[4] "To develop a quantitative boundary between synthesizable and non-synthesizable NCs we performed a linear regression on all the experimentally synthesized NCs with 95% confidence and superimposed the prediction bands."
[5] "Interestingly, the shell-to-core BE was also found to scale linearly with nc1/3, with almost identical behaviour (see linear fits) as the CE."
[6] "The shell-to-core BE and the core CN scale linearly with the shell nAunS1 ratio."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a stable interface for metal deposition and attachment. This method enhances metal-support interactions through the formation of strong chemical bonds between the metal and the support material. By improving these interactions, it leads to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The method ensures that the active metal compounds are uniformly distributed across the crystal surface, optimizing their accessibility and reactivity with reactants and products. This results in catalysts with superior performance, making them more efficient in various industrial processes, including but not limited to, hydrogenation, oxidation, and reforming reactions.
