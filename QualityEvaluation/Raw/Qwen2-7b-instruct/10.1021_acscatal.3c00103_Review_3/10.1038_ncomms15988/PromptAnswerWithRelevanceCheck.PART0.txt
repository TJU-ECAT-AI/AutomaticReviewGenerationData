[1] "Our developed theory introduces thermodynamic descriptors that are dependent on the detailed structural characteristics of the NCs."
[2] "In Fig. 2, we plot the calculated shell-to-core binding energy (BE) versus the cohesive energy (CE) of the metal cores."
[3] "This trend highlights a unique physicochemical feature of the experimentally synthesized Aun(SR)m NCs: in order for a thiolate-protected Au NC to be thermodynamically stable, there is a fine balance between the CE of the core and the BE of the shell to the core."
[4] "To develop a quantitative boundary between synthesizable and non-synthesizable NCs we performed a linear regression on all the experimentally synthesized NCs with 95% confidence and superimposed the prediction bands."
[5] "Interestingly, the shell-to-core BE was also found to scale linearly with nc1/3, with almost identical behaviour (see linear fits) as the CE."
[6] "The shell-to-core BE and the core CN scale linearly with the shell nAunS1 ratio."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a stable interface for metal deposition and attachment. This method enhances metal-support interactions through the formation of strong chemical bonds between the metal and the support material. By improving these interactions, it leads to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The method ensures that the active metal compounds are uniformly distributed across the crystal surface, optimizing their accessibility and reactivity with reactants and products. This results in catalysts with superior performance, making them more efficient in various industrial processes, including but not limited to, hydrogenation, oxidation, and reforming reactions.

[1] "Interestingly, we reveal a near-perfect match between the shell-to-core BE and the CE of the metal cores."
[2] "Thus, a stability criterion has been elucidated connecting the cores with the shells of the NCs."
[3] "In addition, the two structures which would not be identified as stable by the superatom theory, Au20SR16 and the Au36SR24, are shown as stable here by the thermodynamic stability theory."
[4] "We believe that other magic-number thiolated Au NC cores will fall directly on the black line."

This study introduces a thermodynamic stability theory based on first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explain the stabilization of colloidal metal nanoclusters (NCs) protected by thiolate molecules. The theory identifies a unique physicochemical feature of the NCs, where there is a fine balance between the cohesive energy (CE) of the metal core and the shell-to-core binding energy (BE). This balance is crucial for the stability of both neutral and charged NCs across different metals. The theory also extends to other metals, demonstrating its applicability beyond gold. It provides a criterion for discovering stable, atomically precise, colloidal metal NC architectures that can be synthesized in the laboratory. Furthermore, it offers a quantitative boundary between synthesizable and non-synthesizable NCs through linear regression analysis.

这项研究提出了一种基于第一原理密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的热力学稳定性理论，用于解释由硫醇盐分子保护的金属纳米团簇（NC）的稳定化。该理论揭示了NCs的独特物理化学特征，即金属核心的凝聚能（CE）与壳层到核心的结合能（BE）之间存在完美的平衡关系，这是NC稳定性的关键因素。这一平衡适用于不同金属的中性和带电NC。该理论还扩展到了其他金属，证明其适用性超越了金。它提供了一种在实验室合成稳定的、原子精确的、可合成的金属NC架构的标准。此外，通过线性回归分析，它提供了区分可合成和不可合成NC的定量界限。

[1] "Our developed theory introduces thermodynamic descriptors that are dependent on the detailed structural characteristics of the NCs. Moreover, our theory introduces new pathways for discovering in silico atomic-precise metal NC architectures that are thermodynamically stable and synthesizable in the lab."
[2] "In addition, the in silico structural prediction of stable NCs is currently computationally intractable for NC sizes larger than a couple of hundred atoms (treated with first-principles methods)."
[3] "To develop a quantitative boundary between synthesizable and non-synthesizable NCs we performed a linear regression on all the experimentally synthesized NCs with 95% confidence and superimposed the prediction bands (Supplementary Fig. 4)."
[4] "We have thus shown (using the relations derived from Fig. 3) that the core morphology largely dictates the overall NC characteristics."
[5] "Our theory reveals that for every thermodynamically isolated, experimentally synthesized thiolate-protected NC, there is a perfect energy balance between the adsorption strength of the ligand-shell to the metal-core and the CE of the core."

1. The developed theory provides thermodynamic descriptors that rely on the specific structural features of NCs. It also offers new strategies for creating in silico metal NC designs that are both thermodynamically stable and feasible to synthesize in a laboratory setting.

2. The computational prediction of stable NCs becomes increasingly difficult for sizes larger than a few hundred atoms, making it currently impractical to use first-principles methods for larger NCs.

3. A statistical model was constructed using a linear regression on all experimentally synthesized NCs with a 95% confidence interval, and prediction bands were overlaid to distinguish between stable and unstable NCs.

4. The core structure's morphology plays a significant role in determining the overall properties of the NC.

5. For every experimentally isolated, thiolate-protected NC that is thermodynamically stable, there is an optimal energy balance between the ligand-shell's binding strength to the metal-core and the core's cohesive energy.

2. 对于大小超过几百个原子的NC，使用第一原理方法进行计算预测变得越来越困难，目前对于更大的NC来说，这种预测变得不切实际。

3. 我们通过线性回归构建了一个模型，对所有实验合成的NC进行了统计分析，并且以95%的置信度，叠加了预测区间，以区分稳定和不稳定NC。

4. 核心结构的形态在很大程度上决定了整体NC特性。

5. 对于每一个实验上隔离、由硫醇保护的热力学稳定的NC，都有一个最优的能量平衡，其中结合到金属核心的配体壳层的强度与核心的凝聚能相关。
