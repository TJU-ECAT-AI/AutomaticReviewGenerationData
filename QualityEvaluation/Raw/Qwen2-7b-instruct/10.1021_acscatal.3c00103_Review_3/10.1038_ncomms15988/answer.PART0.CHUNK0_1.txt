[1] "Interestingly, we reveal a near-perfect match between the shell-to-core BE and the CE of the metal cores."
[2] "Thus, a stability criterion has been elucidated connecting the cores with the shells of the NCs."
[3] "In addition, the two structures which would not be identified as stable by the superatom theory, Au20SR16 and the Au36SR24, are shown as stable here by the thermodynamic stability theory."
[4] "We believe that other magic-number thiolated Au NC cores will fall directly on the black line."

This study introduces a thermodynamic stability theory based on first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explain the stabilization of colloidal metal nanoclusters (NCs) protected by thiolate molecules. The theory identifies a unique physicochemical feature of the NCs, where there is a fine balance between the cohesive energy (CE) of the metal core and the shell-to-core binding energy (BE). This balance is crucial for the stability of both neutral and charged NCs across different metals. The theory also extends to other metals, demonstrating its applicability beyond gold. It provides a criterion for discovering stable, atomically precise, colloidal metal NC architectures that can be synthesized in the laboratory. Furthermore, it offers a quantitative boundary between synthesizable and non-synthesizable NCs through linear regression analysis.

这项研究提出了一种基于第一原理密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的热力学稳定性理论，用于解释由硫醇盐分子保护的金属纳米团簇（NC）的稳定化。该理论揭示了NCs的独特物理化学特征，即金属核心的凝聚能（CE）与壳层到核心的结合能（BE）之间存在完美的平衡关系，这是NC稳定性的关键因素。这一平衡适用于不同金属的中性和带电NC。该理论还扩展到了其他金属，证明其适用性超越了金。它提供了一种在实验室合成稳定的、原子精确的、可合成的金属NC架构的标准。此外，通过线性回归分析，它提供了区分可合成和不可合成NC的定量界限。
