1. The developed theory provides thermodynamic descriptors that rely on the specific structural features of NCs. It also offers new strategies for creating in silico metal NC designs that are both thermodynamically stable and feasible to synthesize in a laboratory setting.

2. The computational prediction of stable NCs becomes increasingly difficult for sizes larger than a few hundred atoms, making it currently impractical to use first-principles methods for larger NCs.

3. A statistical model was constructed using a linear regression on all experimentally synthesized NCs with a 95% confidence interval, and prediction bands were overlaid to distinguish between stable and unstable NCs.

4. The core structure's morphology plays a significant role in determining the overall properties of the NC.

5. For every experimentally isolated, thiolate-protected NC that is thermodynamically stable, there is an optimal energy balance between the ligand-shell's binding strength to the metal-core and the core's cohesive energy.

1. 我们开发的理论提供了依赖于NC结构特征的热力学描述符。它还提供了一种新的途径，在实验室中合成热力学稳定的硅信息金属NC设计。

2. 对于大小超过几百个原子的NC，使用第一原理方法进行计算预测变得越来越困难，目前对于更大的NC来说，这种预测变得不切实际。

3. 我们通过线性回归构建了一个模型，对所有实验合成的NC进行了统计分析，并且以95%的置信度，叠加了预测区间，以区分稳定和不稳定NC。

4. 核心结构的形态在很大程度上决定了整体NC特性。

5. 对于每一个实验上隔离、由硫醇保护的热力学稳定的NC，都有一个最优的能量平衡，其中结合到金属核心的配体壳层的强度与核心的凝聚能相关。
