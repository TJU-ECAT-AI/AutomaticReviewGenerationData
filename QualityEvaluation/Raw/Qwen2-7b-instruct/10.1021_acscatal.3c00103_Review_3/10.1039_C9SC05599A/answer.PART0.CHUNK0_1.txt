[1] "In that context, the combination of surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) and a thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) approach is used to prepare bimetallic subnanometric and narrowly distributed PtZn alloyed particles supported on silica via grafting of a Pt precursor on surface OH groups present in a Zn single-site containing material followed by a H2 reduction treatment."
[2] "This study demonstrates how SOMC can provide access to highly efficient and tailored catalysts through the stepwise introduction of specific elements via grafting to generate small, homogeneously and narrowly distributed supported alloyed nanoparticles at controlled interfaces."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by enabling a stepwise introduction of specific elements through grafting. This process involves anchoring a Pt precursor on the surface OH groups present in a Zn single-site containing material, followed by a hydrogen reduction treatment. This method allows for the creation of small, homogeneously and narrowly distributed supported alloyed nanoparticles at controlled interfaces, leading to highly efficient and tailored catalysts. By precisely controlling the incorporation of metals, the method enhances metal-support interactions, improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

在这一背景下，通过表面有机金属化学（SOMC）和热解分子前体（TMP）方法的结合，利用在含锌单晶材料上的表面OH基团上接枝Pt前体，然后进行氢气还原处理，来制备分布均匀、粒径小于纳米级别的双金属PtZn合金粒子，支持在硅酸盐上。这种方法通过分步引入特定元素，实现了通过接枝生成小型、均一且粒径分布窄的支撑合金纳米颗粒在控制界面，从而为高效和定制催化剂提供途径。通过精确控制金属的引入，该方法增强了金属-载体间的相互作用，提高了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
