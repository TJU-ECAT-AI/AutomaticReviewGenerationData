[1] "In order to develop more controlled preparation methods, surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)1315 in combination with the thermolytic molecular precursor approach (TMP)16,17 has emerged as a powerful preparation technique."
[2] "This material, that exhibits a Zn to Pt molar ratio of 3:2 in the form of alloyed PtZn particles with a 0.2 to 0.4 fraction of the overall Zn amount remaining as ZnII sites on the silica surface, catalyzes propane dehydrogenation (PDH) with high productivity (703 gC3H6 gPt1 h1 to 375 gC3H6 gPt1 h1) and very low deactivation rates (kd = 0.027 h1) over 30 h at high WHSV (75 h1)."
[3] "The results are summed up in Table 1. The Pt 4f7/2 binding energy in Pt0Znδ+/SiO2 is 71.6 eV which is shifted by +0.3 eV compared to Pt0/SiO2, likely due to the restructuring of the Pt 4f states upon alloying with Zn."
[4] "Furthermore, the metal based productivity and the stability of the reported system also surpass these of the recently published PtGa based system (661 (357 after 20 h) gC3H6 gPt1 h1; kd = 0.041 h1) prepared via the same SOMC/TMP approach."

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by first generating hydroxyl groups on the surface of the material. These hydroxyl groups act as anchor points for grafting metal precursors, enabling precise control over the placement and orientation of the metal atoms or clusters on the support surface. This method enhances metal-support interactions by creating strong chemical bonds between the metal and the support, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

2. The implications of this method for enhancing catalyst performance include the ability to create narrowly distributed, subnanometric particles with high metal dispersion. This high dispersion, combined with the formation of alloyed particles, leads to increased catalytic activity and stability. The presence of remaining Lewis acidic sites on the catalyst surface may contribute to preventing sintering and maintaining catalyst integrity under reaction conditions.

3. The binding energy shift observed in the Pt 4f7/2 spectrum of the alloyed material (Pt0Znδ+/SiO2) compared to pure Pt supports the formation of an alloyed structure. The shift of +0.3 eV is attributed to the restructuring of the Pt 4f states upon alloying with Zn, which affects the electronic properties of the metal.

4. The reported system demonstrates superior stability and activity compared to other PtZn systems and even a recently published PtGa system. Its metal-based productivity and stability surpass those of the PtGa system, highlighting the effectiveness of the hydroxyl anchoring method and the SOMC/TMP approach in synthesizing high-performance catalysts.

1. 羟基锚定方法通过首先在材料表面生成羟基团，为活性金属化合物的精确插入提供了锚定点。这些羟基团作为金属前体的附着点，使得金属原子或簇能够在支持表面上以精确控制的方式进行定位和定向。这种方法通过在金属与支持之间形成强化学键来增强金属-支持相互作用，从而提高固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。

2. 这种方法对催化剂性能的提升影响包括能够制造分布狭窄、亚纳米级的颗粒，并且具有高金属分散度。这种高分散度结合合金颗粒的形成，导致催化活性和稳定性的增加。催化剂表面剩余的Lewis酸性位点的存在可能有助于防止烧结并保持催化剂在反应条件下的完整性。

3. 观察到的合金材料（Pt0Znδ+/SiO2）中Pt 4f7/2光谱的能级偏移+0.3 eV与纯Pt相比，支持了合金结构的形成。这种能级偏移归因于Zn与Pt的合金化导致的Pt 4f状态重构，这影响了金属的电子性质。

4. 报道的系统在稳定性与活性方面表现出优于其他PtZn系统以及最近发布的PtGa系统的特性。其基于金属的产率和稳定性超过了PtGa系统，这表明使用羟基锚定方法和SOMC/TMP途径合成高性能催化剂的有效性。
