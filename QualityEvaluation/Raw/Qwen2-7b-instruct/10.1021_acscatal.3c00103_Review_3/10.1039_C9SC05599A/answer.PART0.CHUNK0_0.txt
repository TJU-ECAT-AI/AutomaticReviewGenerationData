[1] "A combination of surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) and a thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) approach is used to prepare bimetallic subnanometric and narrowly distributed PtZn alloyed particles supported on silica via grafting of a Pt precursor on surface OH groups present in a Zn single-site containing material followed by a H2 reduction treatment."
[2] "This study demonstrates how SOMC can provide access to highly efficient and tailored catalysts through the stepwise introduction of specific elements via grafting to generate small, homogeneously and narrowly distributed supported alloyed nanoparticles at controlled interfaces."
[3] "The materials were then tested in the PDH reaction at 550 C under flow conditions (50 ml min1; 20% C3H8 in Ar) in a stainless-steel tubular reactor where negligible mass and heat transfer limitations occur."
[4] "Comparison of Pt0Znδ+/SiO2 to the monometallic Pt0/SiO2 shows a dramatic improvement in the productivity of the bimetallic system by more than one order of magnitude."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) and a thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) approach. It allows for the grafting of a Pt precursor onto surface OH groups present in a Zn single-site containing material, followed by hydrogen reduction treatment. This results in the formation of bimetallic subnanometric and narrowly distributed PtZn alloyed particles supported on silica. The implications of this method include enhanced metal-support interactions, improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions, as demonstrated by the dramatic improvement in productivity of the PtZn system compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

在晶体材料中精确地整合活性金属化合物的方法通过利用表面有机金属化学（SOMC）和热解分子前体（TMP）方法得以实现。这种方法允许将铂前体嫁接到含有单个锌位点的材料的表面羟基集团上，并随后进行氢化还原处理，从而在控制界面形成尺寸小、分布均匀且狭义分布的铂锌合金纳米颗粒，支持在硅酸盐上。这种方法对催化剂性能的影响包括增强金属-载体相互作用、提高固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性，如通过与单一铂催化剂相比，铂锌系统显著提高了生产力。
