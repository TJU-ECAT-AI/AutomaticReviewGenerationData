[1] "In that context, the combination of surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) and a thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) approach is used to prepare bimetallic subnanometric and narrowly distributed PtZn alloyed particles supported on silica via grafting of a Pt precursor on surface OH groups present in a Zn single-site containing material followed by a H2 reduction treatment."
[2] "These silica-supported PtZn nanoparticles were characterized by a multi-technique approach (CO and pyridine adsorption FTIR as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies); they show high productivity (703 gC3H6/(gPt1 h1)), high selectivity (95%) and an outstanding stability (kd = 0.027) at high WHSV compared to other PtZn based systems for PDH at 550 C."
[3] "This improved performance is attributed to the formation of subnanometric and narrowly distributed alloyed particles supported on ZnII modified silica that likely plays a role in stabilizing these particles under PDH reaction conditions."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by first generating hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support material. In the case of the study, Zn single-site containing material was used. Then, a Pt precursor is grafted onto these hydroxyl groups. This method allows for precise control over the placement and concentration of the metal compounds on the support. After grafting, a hydrogen reduction treatment is applied to convert the metal compounds into their metallic form. This process ensures that the metal compounds are stably anchored to the support, enhancing metal-support interactions. As a result, the heterogenous catalysts exhibit improved activity, selectivity, and stability in solid-gas reactions. The formation of subnanometric and narrowly distributed alloyed particles, particularly those supported on ZnII modified silica, is a key factor in stabilizing the catalyst under PDH reaction conditions.

该氢氧基锚定方法通过首先在支撑材料表面生成氢氧基来促进活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的精确掺入。在这种情况下，使用含Zn单原子的材料。然后将Pt前体嫁接到这些氢氧基上。这种方法允许对金属化合物在支持物上的放置和浓度进行精确控制。之后，通过氢还原处理将金属化合物转化为其金属形式。这一过程确保了金属化合物稳定地附着在支撑物上，从而增强金属-支撑相互作用。因此，异质催化剂在固体气体反应中表现出改进的活性、选择性和稳定性。在PDH反应条件下稳定催化剂的关键因素是形成亚纳米级和狭窄分布的合金颗粒，尤其是那些支持在ZnII修饰的二氧化硅上的颗粒。
