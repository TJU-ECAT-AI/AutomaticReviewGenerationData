[1] "In order to develop more controlled preparation methods, surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)1315 in combination with the thermolytic molecular precursor approach (TMP)16,17 has emerged as a powerful preparation technique."
[2] "These silica-supported PtZn nanoparticles were characterized by a multi-technique approach (CO and pyridine adsorption FTIR as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies); they show high productivity (703 gC3H6/(gPt1 h1)), high selectivity (95%) and an outstanding stability (kd = 0.027) at high WHSV compared to other PtZn based systems for PDH at 550 C."
[3] "Comparison of Pt0Znδ+/SiO2 to the monometallic Pt0/SiO2 shows a dramatic improvement in the productivity of the bimetallic system by more than one order of magnitude."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by first generating hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support material. This method allows for the anchoring of metal precursors through surface hydroxyl groups, enabling the creation of supported nanoparticles with controlled interfaces. The implications of this technique for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are profound. By creating narrowly distributed bimetallic PtZn subnanometric particles supported on SiO2, the method leads to high productivity, stability, and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Moreover, the presence of remaining Lewis acidic ZnII sites on the material's surface likely plays a significant role in stabilizing the catalyst against sintering, thus contributing to its long-term performance.
