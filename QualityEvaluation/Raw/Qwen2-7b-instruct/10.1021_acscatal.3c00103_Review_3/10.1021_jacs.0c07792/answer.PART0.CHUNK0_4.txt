The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for the targeted inclusion of active metal compounds within crystal materials, leading to enhanced metal-support interactions. This results in improved catalytic performance. By incorporating siliceous zeolites, a coking-resistant iron catalyst is achieved, which shows significant improvements in activity, selectivity, and stability during solid-gas reactions.
