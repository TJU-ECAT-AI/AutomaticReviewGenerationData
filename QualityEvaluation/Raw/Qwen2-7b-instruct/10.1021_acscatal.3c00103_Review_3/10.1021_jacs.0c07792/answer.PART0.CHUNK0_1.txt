The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled insertion of active metal compounds within crystal structures, thereby strengthening the bond between metals and their support. This technique results in enhanced catalytic performance, higher selectivity, and better durability for heterogeneous catalysts involved in solid-gas reactions. Through the modulation of siliceous zeolite, a coking-resistant iron catalyst was successfully developed for ethane dehydrogenation.
