<p>The Ga was introduced to immobilize the Pt active sites in the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst as a promoter.</p>
<p>Controlled experiment shows that γ-Al2O3 support is not active for the PDH reaction under the same experimental condition.</p>
<p>In comparison, PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst shows notably enhanced catalytic performance with 17.4% initial propane conversion, which is 1.7 times higher than that of Pt/Al2O3 catalyst under identical conditions.</p>
<p>Although the initial activity of the catalyst has been greatly improved over PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst, the stability of the catalyst is still poor due to the unstable Pt active sites.</p>
<p>It has been reported that the presence of Al-O-Ga sites may promote heterolysis C-H bond activation.</p>

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by introducing specific functional groups, such as hydroxyl, onto the support surface. This method enhances metal-support interactions through the formation of strong bonds between the metal and the support. By doing so, it improves the stability of the active sites, leading to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. In the context of this research, the addition of Ga as a co-catalyst to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts resulted in the immobilization of Pt active sites, which led to a notable improvement in the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation. However, despite the initial enhancement in activity, the stability of the catalyst remained a challenge due to the instability of the Pt active sites.

水合锚定方法通过在支撑表面引入特定的功能基团，如羟基，来实现活性金属化合物在晶态材料中的可控掺杂。这种方法通过形成金属与支撑之间强烈的结合，增强金属-支撑相互作用。这样做可以提高活性位点的稳定性，从而改善异相催化剂在固-气反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。在此研究中，向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加Ga作为助催化剂，导致了Pt活性位点的固定化，这显著提高了丙烷脱氢的催化性能。然而，尽管初始活性有所提升，催化剂的稳定性仍然是一个挑战，原因在于Pt活性位点的不稳定。
