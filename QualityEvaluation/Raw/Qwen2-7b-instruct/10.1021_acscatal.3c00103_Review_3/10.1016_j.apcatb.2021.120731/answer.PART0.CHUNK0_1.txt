[1] "The as-prepared 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst shows outstanding catalytic activity (propylene productivity rate 0.5 mol/gcat.·h) close to its equilibrium conversion (24.5%) with much better stability (deactivation constant: 0.007 h−1) at 450 C."
[2] "This work demonstrates a new method to harnessing the metal-support interaction in catalysis."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by creating a physical barrier through the deposition of inorganic oxide shells, such as silica layers, on the catalyst surface. This method improves metal-support interactions by stabilizing the active metal sites, preventing their sintering and aggregation during catalytic processes. As a result, it enhances the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The silica layer acts as a protective layer that maintains the dispersion of metal species, thus ensuring their effective participation in catalytic reactions.

羟基锚定方法通过在催化剂表面沉积无机氧化物壳层，如二氧化硅层，实现了活性金属化合物的可控掺杂。这种方法通过在金属和氧化物支持之间创建物理屏障来改善金属支持相互作用。它通过稳定活性金属位点并防止它们在催化过程中的聚集和团聚，从而提高了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。二氧化硅层作为保护层，维持金属物种的分散，确保其有效参与催化反应。
