[1] "The as-prepared 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst shows outstanding catalytic activity (propylene productivity rate 0.5 mol/gcat.·h) close to its equilibrium conversion (24.5%) with much better stability (deactivation constant: 0.007 h−1) at 450 C."
[2] "Moreover, the electronic state of Pt is also influenced by the silica coating layers."
[3] "This work demonstrates a new method to harnessing the metal-support interaction in catalysis."
[4] "The interface between catalyst and silica coating changes the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) to immobilize the Ga oxide clusters, further tightly anchoring the Pt catalytic sites for PDH process."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by creating a stable interface between the metal and the support. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By adjusting the electronic structure of the active metals and immobilizing metal clusters, the method ensures that the catalyst remains active even under harsh reaction conditions. This approach is demonstrated to be effective in stabilizing Pt sites on PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts, enabling high activity and stability at low temperatures for propane dehydrogenation.

水合锚定方法通过在金属和支撑材料之间创建稳定的界面，实现了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这增强了金属与支撑材料之间的相互作用，从而提高了异质催化剂在固相-气相反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。通过调整活性金属的电子结构并固定金属簇，该方法确保催化剂即使在苛刻的反应条件下也能保持活性。这一方法在稳定Pt位点于PtGa/Al2O3催化剂上并使其在低温下进行丙烷脱氢反应时表现出高活性和稳定性方面得到了证明。
