[1] "A series of catalysts with different silica coating amount by introducing controlled silica amount on the catalysts surface (as shown in Scheme 1 ). The 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 has shown the most stable catalytic activity for PDH at 450 C."
[2] "The enhanced catalytic stability is attributed to the stable Pt active sites anchored by the Ga clusters as well as silica layers on the catalyst surface."
[3] "The textural properties of the catalysts were investigated by the N2 adsorption via BET method ( Table 1 and Fig. S1 )."
[4] "The surface area of mesopores is slightly increased from 126.3 to 156.3m2/g with the decline of micropores volume when Pt and Ga were loaded on Al2O3."
[5] "This work explores alkane catalytic conversion at lower temperature and demonstrates a new method to improve thermal stability of catalyst."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by introducing a layer of silica around the metal sites. This method enhances metal-support interactions by immobilizing the active sites within the silica layer, which in turn improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By adjusting the amount of silica coating, researchers can tailor the electronic structure of the active metals, leading to better stabilization of the active sites and improved catalytic performance at lower temperatures. This approach not only increases the stability of the catalysts but also optimizes their performance in alkane conversion reactions, particularly in the context of propane dehydrogenation.

水合醇锚定方法通过在金属位点周围引入一层二氧化硅，实现了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺杂。这种方法通过将活性位点固定在二氧化硅层内增强了金属-载体相互作用，进而提高了在固相-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。通过调整二氧化硅涂层的量，研究人员可以调整活性金属的电子结构，从而更好地稳定活性位点并提高在低温下的催化性能。这种方法不仅增加了催化剂的稳定性，还优化了烷烃转化反应，特别是在丙烷脱氢反应中的应用。
