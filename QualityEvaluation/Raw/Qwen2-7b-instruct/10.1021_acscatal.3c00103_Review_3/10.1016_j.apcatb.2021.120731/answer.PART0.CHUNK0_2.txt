<p>Lu et al. reported that the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst surface can be well regulated through depositing controllable Al2O3 overcoating. The anti-sintering ability of Pd particles is greatly improved and the adsorption affinity of product molecules on Pd species is weakened due to the confinement effect of Al2O3 atomic layers.</p>
<p>In this work, we report that the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst coated with silica overlayer shows excellent catalytic performance and stability for the PDH reaction at low temperature (450 C).</p>
<p>The enhanced catalytic stability is attributed to the stable Pt active sites anchored by the Ga clusters as well as silica layers on the catalyst surface.</p>

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a stable interface between the metal and the support. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By immobilizing the active metal compounds, the method prevents their sintering and ensures their effective use in catalytic processes.

2. The silica coating on the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst improves its catalytic stability by anchoring the Pt active sites through the Ga clusters and silica layers on the catalyst surface. This prevents the sintering of Pt and maintains its dispersion, thus enhancing the catalyst's activity and stability at low temperatures.

1. 水合锚定方法通过提供金属和载体之间的稳定界面，促进活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺杂。这增强了金属载体间的相互作用，从而提高了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。通过固定活性金属化合物，该方法防止了它们的聚集，并确保了其在催化过程中的有效使用。

2. 硅酸涂层在铂镓/氧化铝催化剂上的应用通过镓簇和催化剂表面的硅酸层锚定了铂活性位点，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性。这防止了铂的聚集并维持了其分散性，从而增强了催化剂在低温下的活性和稳定性。
