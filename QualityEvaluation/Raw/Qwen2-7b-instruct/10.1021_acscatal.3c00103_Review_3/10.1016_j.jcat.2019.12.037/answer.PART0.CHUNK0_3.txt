[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
[2] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
[3] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92% at 600 C."
[4] "The nature of active cobalt species and the cause of catalyst deactivation in PDH are discussed."
[5] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity."
[6] "The 57% propane conversion and 96% propylene selectivity were achieved over the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst after prereduction treatment at 600 C."
[7] "It was found that confined CoOx could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which is responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment."
[8] "This work not only affords a green and very promising nonprecious dehydrogenation catalyst but gives new insight into the active Co phase for the PDH reaction."

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by confining the metal species within the T-sites (silanols) of the zeolite support. This method enhances metal-support interactions, improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions by creating a favorable environment for the metal species.

2. The implications of this method are that it enables the development of green and nonprecious catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions. The controlled incorporation of active metal compounds within the zeolite support allows for the realization of high propane conversion and extremely high propylene selectivity, matching the performance of commercial precious metal catalysts. The ability to reduce the metal species to metallic particles during the reaction provides insights into the active phase of cobalt catalysts in PDH, highlighting the importance of particle size in determining reactivity.
