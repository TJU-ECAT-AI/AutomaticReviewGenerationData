<p>Continuous global oil depletion provokes the urgent demand to find an alternative way to produce propylene. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is thus of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene.</p>
<p>Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] .</p>
<p>Alternatively, several transition metals, void of shortcomings typical of CrOx and Pt catalysts, have been investigated for the PDH reaction [3] . Unfortunately, they achieved much lower catalytic activity or propylene selectivity for PDH [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] .</p>
<p>The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH [9] ,[10] .</p>
<p>Iglesia et al. found that alkane dehydrogenation over Co-ZSM-5 catalysts had reactivity similar to that over Ga-ZSM-5 [11] .</p>
<p>Hu et al. reported that silica-supported single-site Co2+ was highly selective toward propylene [12] and proposed a nonredox mechanism involving heterolytic CH bond cleavage over single-site Co2+ sites in tetrahedral coordination.</p>
<p>Afterward, they put forward that the tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 were also active sites in the PDH reaction [13] , which could not be reduced during the reaction procedure at 550 C. They did not explain the presence of an induction period or the cause of catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>Sun et al. similarly reported that the surface Co spinel derived from tetracoordinated Co(II) on Al2O3 support under reaction conditions accounted for catalyzing the PDH reaction at a low Co loading [14] , and large Co3O4 crystallites formed at high Co loadings were easily reduced to metallic Co particles in favor of cracking reactions.</p>
<p>Sulfate addition could lead to improved catalytic performance by dispersing cobalt species well and restraining the reduction to metallic Co [15] .</p>
<p>Tetrahedral Co2+ ions are widely recognized to be the active phases in spite of the varied coordination environments. Metallic Co was considered as the active site for cracking and coking reactions, which are responsible for catalyst deactivation. However, the above reports showing the catalytic ability of Co2+ lacked contrasting experiments with reduced Co catalysts.</p>
<p>Recently Lis group gave new insight into the active phase of Co/Al2O3 catalyst in the PDH reaction [16] . The Co/Al2O3 catalyst treated through a reductionreoxidization procedure showed high catalytic activity, indicating that small metallic Co particles were the active sites. This inspires us to reexamine the active phases of cobalt catalysts in PDH.</p>

This passage discusses the challenges faced by traditional PDH catalysts such as CrOx and Pt, which suffer from high cost, environmental issues, and rapid deactivation. Transition metals like Co have been explored as alternatives, showing varying degrees of catalytic activity. The paper highlights the importance of Co due to its abundance and potential catalytic capability. The text also mentions studies on the role of tetrahedral Co2+ species and metallic Co particles in PDH, noting their involvement in cracking and coking reactions that can lead to catalyst deactivation. The recent work by the Lis group suggests that small metallic Co particles are the active sites in PDH reactions, offering new insights for the development of more effective and sustainable Co-based catalysts.

<p>The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species is directly related to the support types, while general SiO2 and Al2O3 supports have inferior structures leading to ill-defined surface-active species. To expose more active sites, metal catalysts are generally downsized into nanoparticulate form and stabilized onto certain substrates.</p>
<p>Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts.</p>
<p>We prepared cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH. After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%.</p>
<p>The 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments likely contained single cobalt species, as detected by a series of techniques of XRD, N2 sorption, DRIFT, DR UVvis, NH3 TPD, H2 TPR, XPS, TEM, and EDS mapping.</p>
<p>The nature of active cobalt species and the cause of catalyst deactivation in PDH are discussed. A sequence of CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.</p>
<p>To further figure out the correlation of catalyst activity and structure, the characterizations and catalytic performance of the CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were compared. The XRD patterns of CoSiBeta catalysts with different Co loadings are presented in Fig. 7 a. All CoSiBeta catalysts show the typical BEA structures of Beta zeolite. The intensities of these diffraction peaks become weaker with the increase of Co loading.</p>
<p>The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments at 600 C for 1 h is very similar, in spite of the induction period, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction.</p>
<p>Considering that in situ dynamic transformation of cobalt species can occur under reaction conditions, the real active species in the PDH reaction may not be any of the starting materials, which is a probable reason for the similar catalytic performance of the 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts.</p>
<p>The reusability of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst was tested, and it was found that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h<sup>-1</sup> for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports.</p>

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by creating a network of hydroxyl groups (silanols) within the zeolite structure. These silanols act as attachment points for metal species, allowing for precise control over their location and orientation within the crystal lattice. This method enhances metal-support interactions, which in turn improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The implication is that catalysts made using this method can exhibit superior performance, especially in terms of achieving high conversion rates and selectivities, while maintaining stability over multiple reaction cycles.

Answer: The hydroxyl anchoring method enhances metal-support interactions by providing a stable and controlled attachment point for metal species within the zeolite structure. This leads to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by confining them in the silanols of the support material, specifically in the T-sites of SiBeta zeolite. This method enhances metal-support interactions by providing a stable anchoring site for the metal species, thereby improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites allows for their easy reduction to metallic Co particles, which are the active sites for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This process ensures a similar catalytic performance for CoSiBeta catalysts, whether they undergo prereduction or not. The presence of metallic Co particles, rather than larger Co3O4 or bulk Co, is responsible for the high propylene selectivity and activity of the catalysts. The controlled reduction of CoOx species during the reaction provides a pathway for achieving high catalytic performance with desirable product selectivity.

该羟基锚定方法通过将活性金属化合物限制在支持材料的硅烷醇中，特别是在SiBeta沸石的T位点中，促进了晶态材料中活性金属化合物的可控掺入。这种方法通过提供一个稳定的锚定位点来增强金属-支持相互作用，从而改善固体-气体反应中的异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。在T位点的限制下，CoOx物种易于还原为金属Co颗粒，这是直接脱氢丙烷到丙烯反应的高效催化剂。此过程确保了CoSiBeta催化剂无论是否经过预还原，其催化性能相似。金属Co颗粒的存在，而不是较大的Co3O4或块状Co，是催化剂高活性和可接受产物选择性的原因。在反应过程中对CoOx物种的可控还原提供了实现高催化性能和理想产物选择性的途径。
