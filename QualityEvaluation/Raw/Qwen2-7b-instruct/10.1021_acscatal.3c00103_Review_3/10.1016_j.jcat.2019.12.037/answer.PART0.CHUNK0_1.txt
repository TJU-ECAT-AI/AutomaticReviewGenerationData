<p>The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species is directly related to the support types, while general SiO2 and Al2O3 supports have inferior structures leading to ill-defined surface-active species. To expose more active sites, metal catalysts are generally downsized into nanoparticulate form and stabilized onto certain substrates.</p>
<p>Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts.</p>
<p>We prepared cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH. After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%.</p>
<p>The 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments likely contained single cobalt species, as detected by a series of techniques of XRD, N2 sorption, DRIFT, DR UVvis, NH3 TPD, H2 TPR, XPS, TEM, and EDS mapping.</p>
<p>The nature of active cobalt species and the cause of catalyst deactivation in PDH are discussed. A sequence of CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.</p>
<p>To further figure out the correlation of catalyst activity and structure, the characterizations and catalytic performance of the CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were compared. The XRD patterns of CoSiBeta catalysts with different Co loadings are presented in Fig. 7 a. All CoSiBeta catalysts show the typical BEA structures of Beta zeolite. The intensities of these diffraction peaks become weaker with the increase of Co loading.</p>
<p>The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments at 600 C for 1 h is very similar, in spite of the induction period, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction.</p>
<p>Considering that in situ dynamic transformation of cobalt species can occur under reaction conditions, the real active species in the PDH reaction may not be any of the starting materials, which is a probable reason for the similar catalytic performance of the 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts.</p>
<p>The reusability of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst was tested, and it was found that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h<sup>-1</sup> for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports.</p>

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by creating a network of hydroxyl groups (silanols) within the zeolite structure. These silanols act as attachment points for metal species, allowing for precise control over their location and orientation within the crystal lattice. This method enhances metal-support interactions, which in turn improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The implication is that catalysts made using this method can exhibit superior performance, especially in terms of achieving high conversion rates and selectivities, while maintaining stability over multiple reaction cycles.

Answer: The hydroxyl anchoring method enhances metal-support interactions by providing a stable and controlled attachment point for metal species within the zeolite structure. This leads to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
