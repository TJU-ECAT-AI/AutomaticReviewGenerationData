<p>The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by creating T-sites (silanols) in the support zeolite. These T-sites provide good conditions for confining the cobalt species.</p>
<p>This method leads to improved metal-support interactions, as evidenced by the presence of confined CoOx species in the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The confinement of CoOx species enhances the catalytic performance for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.</p>
<p>The implications for enhancing activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are significant. By controlling the location and structure of metal compounds, the method allows for the optimization of catalytic sites, leading to enhanced selectivity towards desired products and improved stability under reaction conditions.</p>
