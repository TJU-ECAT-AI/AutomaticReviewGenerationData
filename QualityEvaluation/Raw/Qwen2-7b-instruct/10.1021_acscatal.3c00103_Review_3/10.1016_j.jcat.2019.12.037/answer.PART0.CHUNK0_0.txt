<p>Continuous global oil depletion provokes the urgent demand to find an alternative way to produce propylene. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is thus of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene.</p>
<p>Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] .</p>
<p>Alternatively, several transition metals, void of shortcomings typical of CrOx and Pt catalysts, have been investigated for the PDH reaction [3] . Unfortunately, they achieved much lower catalytic activity or propylene selectivity for PDH [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] .</p>
<p>The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH [9] ,[10] .</p>
<p>Iglesia et al. found that alkane dehydrogenation over Co-ZSM-5 catalysts had reactivity similar to that over Ga-ZSM-5 [11] .</p>
<p>Hu et al. reported that silica-supported single-site Co2+ was highly selective toward propylene [12] and proposed a nonredox mechanism involving heterolytic CH bond cleavage over single-site Co2+ sites in tetrahedral coordination.</p>
<p>Afterward, they put forward that the tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 were also active sites in the PDH reaction [13] , which could not be reduced during the reaction procedure at 550 C. They did not explain the presence of an induction period or the cause of catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>Sun et al. similarly reported that the surface Co spinel derived from tetracoordinated Co(II) on Al2O3 support under reaction conditions accounted for catalyzing the PDH reaction at a low Co loading [14] , and large Co3O4 crystallites formed at high Co loadings were easily reduced to metallic Co particles in favor of cracking reactions.</p>
<p>Sulfate addition could lead to improved catalytic performance by dispersing cobalt species well and restraining the reduction to metallic Co [15] .</p>
<p>Tetrahedral Co2+ ions are widely recognized to be the active phases in spite of the varied coordination environments. Metallic Co was considered as the active site for cracking and coking reactions, which are responsible for catalyst deactivation. However, the above reports showing the catalytic ability of Co2+ lacked contrasting experiments with reduced Co catalysts.</p>
<p>Recently Lis group gave new insight into the active phase of Co/Al2O3 catalyst in the PDH reaction [16] . The Co/Al2O3 catalyst treated through a reductionreoxidization procedure showed high catalytic activity, indicating that small metallic Co particles were the active sites. This inspires us to reexamine the active phases of cobalt catalysts in PDH.</p>

This passage discusses the challenges faced by traditional PDH catalysts such as CrOx and Pt, which suffer from high cost, environmental issues, and rapid deactivation. Transition metals like Co have been explored as alternatives, showing varying degrees of catalytic activity. The paper highlights the importance of Co due to its abundance and potential catalytic capability. The text also mentions studies on the role of tetrahedral Co2+ species and metallic Co particles in PDH, noting their involvement in cracking and coking reactions that can lead to catalyst deactivation. The recent work by the Lis group suggests that small metallic Co particles are the active sites in PDH reactions, offering new insights for the development of more effective and sustainable Co-based catalysts.

这段文字讨论了传统PDH催化剂如CrOx和Pt面临的挑战，包括高昂的成本、环境问题以及快速失活。过渡金属如Co由于其丰富的资源和潜在的催化能力被探索作为替代品。文章强调了Co的重要性，因为它的丰富性。文本还提到了四面体Co2+物种和金属Co颗粒在PDH中的作用，注意到它们参与裂解和结焦反应，这些反应可能导致催化剂失活。Lis小组的近期工作表明，小尺寸的金属Co颗粒是PDH反应中的活性位点，为开发更有效和可持续的Co基催化剂提供了新的见解。
