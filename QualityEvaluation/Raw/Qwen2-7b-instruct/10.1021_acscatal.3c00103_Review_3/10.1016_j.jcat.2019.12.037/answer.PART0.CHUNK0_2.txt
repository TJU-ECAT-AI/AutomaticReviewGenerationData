• "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
• "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
• "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
• "The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst."
• "It was found that confined CoOx could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which is responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by confining them in the silanols of the support material, specifically in the T-sites of SiBeta zeolite. This method enhances metal-support interactions by providing a stable anchoring site for the metal species, thereby improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites allows for their easy reduction to metallic Co particles, which are the active sites for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This process ensures a similar catalytic performance for CoSiBeta catalysts, whether they undergo prereduction or not. The presence of metallic Co particles, rather than larger Co3O4 or bulk Co, is responsible for the high propylene selectivity and activity of the catalysts. The controlled reduction of CoOx species during the reaction provides a pathway for achieving high catalytic performance with desirable product selectivity.

该羟基锚定方法通过将活性金属化合物限制在支持材料的硅烷醇中，特别是在SiBeta沸石的T位点中，促进了晶态材料中活性金属化合物的可控掺入。这种方法通过提供一个稳定的锚定位点来增强金属-支持相互作用，从而改善固体-气体反应中的异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。在T位点的限制下，CoOx物种易于还原为金属Co颗粒，这是直接脱氢丙烷到丙烯反应的高效催化剂。此过程确保了CoSiBeta催化剂无论是否经过预还原，其催化性能相似。金属Co颗粒的存在，而不是较大的Co3O4或块状Co，是催化剂高活性和可接受产物选择性的原因。在反应过程中对CoOx物种的可控还原提供了实现高催化性能和理想产物选择性的途径。
