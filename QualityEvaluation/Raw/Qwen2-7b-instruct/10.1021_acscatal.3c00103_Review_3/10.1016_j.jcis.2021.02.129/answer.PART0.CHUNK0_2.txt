[1] "Notably, the restriction of the zeolite can enhance the regeneration stability of the catalyst, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four consecutive cycles."
[2] "The confined GaPt alloy nanoclusters are the active sites for PDH reaction, and their high electron density could boost the desorption of products, resulting in a high propene selectivity of 92.1% and propene formation rate of 20.5 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
[3] "Moreover, no obvious deactivation was observed over GaPt@S-1 catalyst even after 24 h on stream at 600 C, affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.0068 h1, which is much lower than that of the conventional Ga-based catalysts."
[4] "The electronic effect in GaPt@S-1 catalyst hinders the adsorption of products on metal surfaces, and contributes to the migration of coke precursors from active sites to external channels, thus this catalyst achieves excellent PDH performance."
[5] "Zeolites with well-defined microporous channel structures and excellent thermal stability are considered as ideal supports for stabilizing metal species."
[6] "The resulting GaPt@S-1 catalyst displays excellent catalytic performance and high stability during PDH."

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the hydroxyl groups in the zeolite framework to stabilize the metal species. This enhances metal-support interactions through strong electrostatic interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The confinement effect of zeolites plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and functionality of the metal species, ensuring their effectiveness in catalytic processes.
