[1] "Platinum-based materials are well-known for exceptional performance in PDH process because of their superior activation of CH bonds."
[2] "Most significantly, introducing trace platinum into the non-expensive metal can modify the electronic structure of the catalyst by alloying, thus weakening the adsorption of π-bonded alkenes and decreasing the cracking of CC bonds."
[3] "In addition, the electronic effects of the alloys are also driven by changes in the valence electron energy of the metal surface, which can effectively decrease the metal-adsorbate bond energy and boost the desorption of products."
[4] "However, the surface Pt species of this catalyst usually suffer from poor recyclability and inferior stability during high-temperature reactions."
[5] "Zeolites with well-defined microporous channel structures and excellent thermal stability are considered as ideal supports for stabilizing metal species."
[6] "The resulting GaPt@S-1 catalyst displays excellent catalytic performance and high stability during PDH."
[7] "Furthermore, the active sites of GaPt@S-1 for PDH were verified by a series of techniques of XRD, DR UVvis, XPS and the calculation of turnover rate (TOR)."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by creating strong interactions between the metal compounds and the crystal lattice. This method improves metal-support interactions, leading to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By incorporating metals into zeolite matrices, the method ensures that the active sites are confined within the zeolite framework, which contributes to the high stability of the catalyst. The confined active sites, along with the electronic effects of the Ga-Pt bimetallic alloy, enable efficient activation of CH bonds and desorption of products, resulting in improved catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation.
