1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by anchoring the metal compounds onto the surface of the crystal through hydroxyl groups. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
2. The confined GaPt alloy nanoclusters within the silicalite-1 zeolite act as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction. Their high electron density boosts the desorption of products, contributing to the high propene selectivity and formation rate at 600 °C.
3. The restriction of the zeolite enhances the regeneration stability of the GaPt@S-1 catalyst, allowing the catalytic activity to remain unchanged after four consecutive cycles.
4. The surface Pt species of the catalyst often exhibit poor recyclability and inferior stability during high-temperature reactions, which is an issue that needs to be addressed.
5. The GaPt@S-1 catalyst consists of confined ultra-small GaPt alloy nanoclusters and a portion of isolated tetrahedral coordination of Ga species.

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by creating strong interactions between the metal compounds and the crystal lattice. This method improves metal-support interactions, leading to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By incorporating metals into zeolite matrices, the method ensures that the active sites are confined within the zeolite framework, which contributes to the high stability of the catalyst. The confined active sites, along with the electronic effects of the Ga-Pt bimetallic alloy, enable efficient activation of CH bonds and desorption of products, resulting in improved catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation.
