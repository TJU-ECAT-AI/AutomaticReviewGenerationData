<p>Platinum-based materials are well-known for exceptional performance in PDH process because of their superior activation of CH bonds.</p>
<p>Most significantly, introducing trace platinum into the non-expensive metal can modify the electronic structure of the catalyst by alloying, thus weakening the adsorption of π-bonded alkenes and decreasing the cracking of CC bonds.</p>
<p>The electronic effects of the alloys are also driven by changes in the valence electron energy of the metal surface, which can effectively decrease the metal-adsorbate bond energy and boost the desorption of products.</p>
<p>Zeolites with well-defined microporous channel structures and excellent thermal stability are considered as ideal supports for stabilizing metal species.</p>
<p>Noteably, the resulting GaPt@S-1 catalyst displays excellent catalytic performance and high stability during PDH.</p>
<p>The electronic effect of GaPt alloy as well as the influence of electronic effect on the desorption of products were investigated in detail.</p>
<p>Moreover, no obvious deactivation was observed over GaPt@S-1 catalyst even after 24 h on stream at 600 C, affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.0068 h-1, which is much lower than that of the conventional Ga-based catalysts.</p>

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the hydroxyl groups of the support material to anchor and stabilize the metal species. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By confining the metal species within the zeolite framework, the catalyst maintains its performance even under harsh conditions, exhibiting low deactivation constants and prolonged stability. The electronic effect of the Ga-Pt alloy plays a crucial role in modulating the adsorption of alkenes and the desorption of products, contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance of the GaPt@S-1 catalyst.

水合物锚定方法通过利用支持材料中的羟基基团来锚定和稳定金属组分，从而实现对晶体材料中活性金属化合物的可控掺杂。这增强了金属-支撑材料之间的相互作用，提高了在固体-气体反应中的异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。通过将金属物种限制在沸石骨架内，催化剂即使在恶劣条件下也能保持其性能，表现出极低的失活常数和长期稳定性。Ga-Pt合金的电子效应在调节烯烃吸附和产物脱附方面起着关键作用，有助于GaPt@S-1催化剂的增强催化性能。
